Plans for the Establishment of the Cuban Provisional Governmetn.

Droller and Napoli met with Varona on Feb 17. On same day they had a

meeting with both Varona and Ray. Droller presented list of 29 names

from which they were to chose 10 for provisional govt. Ray got mad.

Algo gave them a T point program as discussed with the Chief of the

Western Hemisphere Division.

Agreed that Varona, Ray, Artime; Carrillo, Chibas and Pazos would meet?

in NY on 26 Feb. in order to examine list of 29 names and make decision

and Ray and Varona would retrun to Washington on or about I March with

their findings. Droller's Comment: .... "We believe that Varona will

play ball one way or another, but we are not convinced that Ray will

accept our list. We have the impression that he might want to substitude

his own list; of course, we must see whate he comes up with. In any case it

is our view that we should not rush matters unduly if there is real State

Department interest in hving Mr. Ray and company play a role in the pro-

visional government. Should the decision be made to write Ray off, we believe t

the Assembly could be convolked without too much ado, substituting Miro

Cardona for Ray. It should be noted that the above is only the gist of a

long conversation session which, by the way, was recorded and took place in

the Shoreham hotel...."

assured me that I was his friend and that th e proof of this was that I was

in his home, which was 'my home.'....He said that after the events of the

week of 17 April and upon the request of V and AMJAG he had called a meeting

Of AMBUD, at which AMDIPI had requested in an insolent manner and a loud

voice that I be replaced in the work I have been doing. The reason given

by AMDIPl and upheld completely by AMJAG was that I had not told AMBUDt

the day, hour,

and place of landing of the Army of Liberation, and therefore

AMBUD should withdraw its confidence in me. AMBUD-1 explained to me that

at this time of confusion, and thinking of what was best for Cuba, he thought

that he ought to accede to the request of AMDIP-1 and AMJAG.
