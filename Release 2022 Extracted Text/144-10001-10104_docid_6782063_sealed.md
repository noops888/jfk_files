SYRIANS CLAIM ZIONISTS. RESPONSIBLE FOR DEATH OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY

29. Nov 63

Msg Nr:

413

The Syrian regime, always"in search of new anti-Zionist

arguments, has found; in the murder of President KENNEDY;

material for a rather unorthodox interpretation of the lamentable

event.

According to the Ba'thist organ, the murder of the

(B val President) must be attributed to Zionism, which is really

responsible and which is now, trying to cover up the misdeed.

The pro-government daily paper Al: Thawra also asserts that

Zionism had a principal role in 'the event in Dallas.
