Purpose :

KDAFGHAN’ is a support project which provides the Mexico
City Station with fixed photographic and physical surveillance
of the Cuban Embassy and Consulate in Mexico City. The
objectives of the project are to furnish photographie coverage
of the Cuban installation during daylight hours; ‘to ‘assist
the Station in compiling dossiers on officials of the
installation and to fulfill various requirements in support
of other Station Cuban operations.

Description '

The KDAFGHAN Project continues to encompass two assets,
KDAFGHAN-1 and KDAFGHAN-2, who have been associated with the
project since 1962. Both agents continue to furnish information
on a timely basis on the personalities and activities of the
Cuban target. A description of the individual assets is set

-Anstallation of a-TV monitor/robot camern combination ‘during
October 1970, the month designated as “Cuban month.” ; This
added coverage contributed to the compilation of target
Studies on several Cuban officials, Piess studies will be
used as a starting point for future operations, namely the
recruitment/defection of these officials, :

Accomplishuents i : .

1. The main value of the production ‘of the KDAFGHAN
Project has been in establisning the pattern of various Cuban
Embassy employees, The monitoring has also revealed which
Automobiles: the various employees usually drive, Photographic
say rake of the visitors to the main gate of the Cuban Embassy
and logs of the movement 6f Cuban Embassy personnei have proved
very useful in identifying now Cuban PCS employees in Mexico,
Normally the’ Station has been able to mateh Movements of new
and old employees during the initial period when duties and
contacts were being turned over to the new employees and so
identify their duties.’ KDAFGHAN has provided current photographs
of TDY and transiting Cuban officials and Headquarters! has
often provided positive identifications of these persons,
Norberto Hornandez, a DGI headquarters of ficer
visiting Mexico, was identificd in this way, :

2. The Station utilizes KDAPGHAN photographic coverage
and logs to verify the visits of Station assets to the Cuban
Embassy,

3. KDAFGHAN also provides coverage of what appears to
be American visitors to the Cuban Embassy main gate. In the
case of Americans who arrive in automobiles beari x USS,
license plates, the license Plate number, car di ription,
and sterile copics of photographs are given to the FSI for
identification, A Significant result of the KDAFGHAN operation
included a photographic of a specific individual - an old FBI
target - who had been seen visiting the Cuban installation, 7

4, KDAFGHAN also provided useful coverage for the :
KDACOUSTIC-3 operation, an operation aimed at the recruitment
or defection of a DGI officer, This coverage enabled the
"Station to determine KDACOUSTIC-3's movements, an inportant
factor in timing the calls and visits of our access agents,
This use of the operation should prove extremely valuable during
the coming year since a more aggressive recruitment Frogram
against the Cuban target is Planned, H

No agent control or operational problems have been
reported. “Neither were there any security problems eicountered
during ‘the period.’ Gerald D, FAHLANGER continues to be the

charged. in compliance with normal operational security,
Meetings are generally héld once a week, ‘More frequent
contact can be made. by telephone, In an emergency, anyone
can call KDAFGHAN-1 at his home. and say they are a friend
of "Pepe Simon." KDAFGHAN-1 will reply "I haven't seen him
since last Christmas." KDAFGHAN-1 speaks English,

Coordination:
The Ambassador is aware of our efforts against the |
Cuban target in general, He has not been specifically briefed

on this operation,

Future Plans:

1

The Station 1s constantly examining the possibility of
an audio installation at the main gate of the Cuban Embassy.
A successful audio device would serve, in most cases, to
identify the individuals who are photographed by KDARGHAN-1
since they normally identify themselves to the gate house
attendant. There are a few Station assets who have occasional
access to the gate house, and it is conccivable that one of
them could place a quick plant device, provided security
conditions are favorable, The Station currently has under
consideration a recruitment effort against a lower level
employee of thé Cuban Embassy who would be of tremendous
help in such an operation,

Purpose:

The LIONION Project provides the Mexico City Station
with fixed, selective photographic and physical surveillance
of the Cuban Emhassy and Cuban Consulate itn Mexico City. It
is designed to provide information in support of Priority A,
paragraphs 2 and 4 of the current Operating Directive, that
is, the Cuban target present in Mexico and the support
rendered by Cubans in Mexico to exile and other leftist
wroups in Mexico.

Description:

1. The LIONION Project currently encompasses two agents,
LIONION/1 and LIONION/2, 2.basehouse directly across from the
Cuban compound, and a safchouse for mectings with Station Case
Officers. The two agents furnish photographic coverage during
daylight hours of the main entrance to the Cuban Embassy. In
addition, on a spot basis, photographic coverage ‘and visual
surveillance of the Cuban Consulate entrance is possible.
agents also act as dispatchers for the unilateral LIEMBRACE
Surveillance team when the LIEMSBRACE team is being :used
against Cuban target individuals. A description of the
individual assets is set forth below,

‘provide financial backs toppin; LIONION/1 received. his
timmigrado” (permanent immigrant) status in 1965 and. now
has a good deal of ,immunity from harassment from Mexican
immigration authorities. All photographic coverage of the
main Embassy gate through final printing, cropping, and
mounting “is processed by LIONION/1. LIONION/L and LIONION/2
: maintain a log ‘which indicates when a photograph was taken,
a3 “and pertinent. identifying data. License numbers of cars
used by! various Cuban Embassy personnel are recorded aa woll
as license numbers of cars of unidentified Persons visiting

the Cuban Embassy.

3. LIONION/2 (201-305604): Mother of LIONION/1. Her
cover is that of a-dependent mother, As with LIONION/1, she
has "imnigrado” status and has heen associated with the

mies -\ LIONION Project since 1962, LIONION/2 acts as LIONION/1's
assistant and £4ll-in wheneverhe is away from tho LIONION

basehouse,

Changes:

During the project year, the pulse camera coverage of
‘the Cuban Consulate entrance was discontinued, Little or no
use was being made of the product from this camera. One
reason for limited use was that there was no real way to
readily fix the time--or the day~- a particular photo was
taken. There were no other significant changes in the
project during FY 1970.

Accomplishments:

1. The LIONION production for FY 1970 consisted almost
entirely of photographic coverage of visitors to the Cuban
Enbassy main entrance and of logs of the movement of Cuban
Embassy personnel and visitors. This proved very useful in
identifying new Cuban Embassy PCS cmployees in Mexico. The
monitoring also revealed which cars the various employees

usually drove.

2. LIONION also tock photographs of what appeared to .~
be American visitors to the Cuban Embassy front gate. In
the case of Americans -who arrived in automobiles bearing
U.S. license plates, the license plate numbers, car
descriptions, and sterile copies of photographs were given

to LNERGO tor identification.


-3-

tek tee H 7 3.. Tho Statioh also used the LIONION photographic
7 i coverage and log. to. check on the reports of Mexican and
7 other JKLANCE assets who claimed to have visited the Cuban
‘ ances -.brabassy, In the case’ of some assets, LIONION/1 was given
7 W photograph of the.agent and told to be particularly alert
? at certain times’of certain days to confirm the agent's
ste entry and exit. This proved particularly useful in checking
a i *  AVDIME/L's story of contact with the Cubans. It also con-
H . firmed LIRELIC/1's visit to the Cuban Embassy at an early
: Stage in Station recontact with LIRELIC/1.

i Provloms ;

1. No agent control or operational problems have been
reported, Noither were there any security problems
encountered during the period. LIONION/1 was mot in a
safvhouso on an average of once por week by Andrew E.
PELLEMENT, in alias, “Following PELLEMENT's departure in
date May, Gerald-D, FAHLANGER took over the responsibility
for thy LIONION Project. FAHLANGER, in alias, miects LIONION/1
approximatcly once per week. In January 1970, the Station
had LIONION/1 change the safehouse used for meotings with
Station officers, He-signed a one-year lease on the new
apartmont, in alias.” LIONION/1 uses the apartment on weekends
and ovonings to lend credence to the cover story he used in
ronting; i.e., that he lives out-of-town and maintains this
small apartment in Mexico City for use during his frequent

visits

2. Station visits to the LIONION baschouse were limited
to throu during the reporting period. These were made during
non-daylight- hours. LIONION/1 picked up the Station officer
away from the LIONION basehouse arca and drove the officer
to the baséhouse in LIONION/1's own car. The basehouse hag
a driveway off the street cntrance-way which facilitates
entry during non-daylight hours,

3. During the Project Year, the pulse camera and the
electronic equipment used with the LISAMPAN operations were
removed from the baschouse, thus reducing the amount of
compromising equipment in the baschouse.



Coordination:

7 The Ambassador is aware of our efforts against the
Cuban target in general, He has not been specifically
briefed on this operation, ar

Future Plans

= i. The ation is re-examining the various points of
viow which the LIONION baschouse provides of the Cuban
Embassy complex in ordor to determine what steps can be
taken to improve tho usefulness of the LIONION product.

For instance, from tho window in the room where the pulse
camera proviously was installed, an excellent view can be
had‘of the Cuban Embassy garden and the walkways between
the three Cuban Embassy buildings--as well as the Consulate.

‘The Station plans’'to have LIONION/1, on a spot-check basis,

observe the garden area, In -this way, ‘the Station hopes to
update its information ow-the location of the various
officers! officés, the general pattern of movement and
activity, etc. This area will “also be observed during the
night to sco 1f it-can be determined which areas are being
used for living quarters or oftices.

2. It is also planned to assess LIONION/1's ability
to observe and draw appropriate conclusions from his obser-
vations, and to write these un f the Statio:

3. Depending on the need for Consulate coverage, the
installation of closed circuit -TV coverage of the Consulate
entrance is boing considered.

4. The Station is being queried as to emergency contact
arrangements with LIONION/1. .

Costs:
1. General: This renewal request is for the period
1 July 1970 through 30 June 197). (FY 1971), in the amount
of $11,094,
2. Source of Funds: Project LIONION is included in

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Western Hemisphere Division

SUBJECT : LIONION Project Renewal Request

1. Approval is requested of the LIONION Project for the
poriod 1 July 1969 through 30 June 1970 (FY 1970) for $11,994.
Funds are available.

2. Project LIONION is a support project which “provides
the Mexico City Station with fixed photographic and physical
surveillance’of ‘the Cuban Embassy and Consulate in Mexico City.
The surveillance is conducted by two indigenous agents: located
din a basehouse directly across from the Cuban compound. At
times the principal agent aiso acts as a dispatcher for the
LIEMBRACE surveillance team. Information is radioed to the
team concerning the departure of Cuban officials, thus allowing
the team to remain a more discreet distance from the target.

: 3. As reflected in the attached Project Renewal, an
Audio device pianted in the gatehouse of the compound could

be monitored at the LIONION basehouse, aiding greatly in
identifying visitors. Since the time the Station submitted
the renewal, however, this device ceased to function along
with the rest of the LISAMPAN devices. This’ installation

Was monitored through carrier current from the LISAMPAN/
LISASH baschouse, also situated in front of the compound.
Since the connection between the two basehouses was by carrier
current only, and since the agents in each baschoutse are un-
Qware of the other's activity, a possible compromise of the
LISAMPAN/LISASH activity should not affect LIONION security.

: 4. Although the LIONION Project does not produce dis-
Geminable positive intelligence, it is considered by the
Station as essential to its Cuban operations. The 4.100 or
more selective individual photographs produced annually



Couplod with the visual observations, were effective in
Providing timely operational information. In addition, over
8,000 .foct of pulse camera film is produced annually, recording

“the image of cach visitor to the Consulate. “The years of
experience of the principal agent have given him intimate
Knowlodyo of the target personalities. ‘ie often brings matters
tothe immediate attention. of the Station withoat having been
levied tho’ specific requirement to do so. Ass result, the
Station is aided greatly in keeping abreast of the day to j
day activities of the Cuban compound.

5. in recent months, the LIONION Project was useful to |
the Station in checking out statements made by ESMARROW-1,

6. In March 1969, the Project Provided photos-of three
U.S. citizens who visited the Cuban Embassy and were suspected
of being draft dodgers. The photos were passed to the FBI
within three hours of the request for information,

7. Other than the loss of the audio device in gatehouse,
there have been no changes. The Operation continues to run
smoothly.

8. Approval 1s recommended.

LIONION FROJECT RENEWAL

A. Objectives

. Project LIONION, 8 long-term rupport project designed to
providé fixed photographic, teciinical, and physical surveillance

of the PBUMEI Embeesy and Conanlete in Mexicu City, has the

following specific objectivea:

a. To furnish photographic coverago during daylight
houre of the main entrances to the torget inctellation.

b. To operate as a listening post in support of
7 technical operations agninst this target to complement the
photogrephic coverage.

ce. To radio dispatch physical eurveillance teans
ageinst pereons useoclated with the target.

! 4. To aoaist the Station in compilin; information for :
individual dossiers on officials of the target installation,

e. To fulfill various requirements in support of other
Station PRRUMEN operations.

2. The nbove-cited objectives are in agrecment with the
over-all objectives of Station Kexico City.

B. Changes

Oliver D. CIMOCH assumed administrative and operational
rasconsibility for Project LICNION in December 1967 and
: continued ‘thia responsibility until his deperture in Decerber
1968. Pending arrival of CIiOCH's revlacement, the Project was
handled by Station Officer Gerald D. FANLANGEX and Station WOACRE
representative, Walter W. CORMBURY. On 28 February 1969, LIONLON-1
E. PELLEMEKY, who assumed Project ;

responsibility effective that date.

C. Intelligence Production

As an operational suprort project, Project LI0iION does not
produce disseminable positive intelligence. Quantitatively,
during. CY 1968, the Project provided over 4,000 selective individual
photographs of persons and/or vehicles entering the target
installation and over 8,0CO feet of pulse camera film, There hes

been no formal audio product frem Project LIchI0Ok since July
1968 when the tranacription of the LISAMPAN/DM: traffic was
terminated. As reported extensively in HMMA. 36553, 19°...
February 1969, the Station has teen unable to activate LISALPAN/
KL eince 16 January 1969. A qualitative analysis of the
TON product is discussed ‘in paragraph ) telow. The Station
is unable to evaluate the worth of the pulse cewera operation
vince’ the bulk film, undeveloped, is pouched directly to
Headquarters. The. cost: of this portion of the operation is
tinimal,. however, since it is.limited to the cost of the film.
and development at Eeadquarters. The camera works autovatically _

. aud requires only minimal maintenance.

D. Effectiveness

1. Project LIOUION is considered by Station Mexico City as
essential to its PBRULEN operations, It has consistently proven
highly effective and responsive to Station reaquirezents of both
long and short renge neture. LIOiI0N-1, the Project's only full
time agent, continues to furnish on a timely basis, information
on the personalities and ectivities of the target personnel.
TIONIOW-2 continues to backstop LIONIOH-1 end substitute for hin
when he is away from his post. At the age of 70, she is not
able to man the LIOFICK base full time, and her sight is
failing. She is atle to photogreph. visitors, however, and live

PAK/DOG traffic. LIONION-2's.role as a
Ok-l insures continuous coverage of the target
during daylight hours, five days a week, LIOFION-l's more than
six years of experience working on the same target continue to
produce an increasingly complete and accurate identification of
the staf and visitors to LINING. These years of experience have
developed an agent knowledgeable of WOFIRM operational and
security requirements who will often bring to the Stetion's
attention those matters which he feels are of immediaté interest
without having special requirements levied.vpon hia and without
waiting for the next regularly scheduled meeting with his
Station contact. He has on numerous occasions notified the
Station of the presence of suspect PRRULEM security types. He
has also frequently passed along operational leads of use’ to
the Station in other aspects of ite PEKUMEK operations.

2. The addition of LISAXPAr/DOG to the LIONION besenouse
has noticeably increased LIONION-l1's esbility to identify new
visitors to the target and at timee, determine tne nature of
their tusinese. The LISAMPAN/DOG product was channeled to the
LIONION bssehouse by carrier current from Liga‘ ion
10 April 1968. Since its primary value is a aid to LIOhioN-1
in identifying LIRING visitors, its product has not beer recorded

or transcrited since July 1968, LIONICK-1 live monitors the
treffic from his baschouse. LIGA! PAN-1 whe wans the LISASH
base has teen told nothing of the LICHIOX base and LIONION-1

- wes offered no explanation concerning the manner in which
LISAMPAN/DOG. production is channeled to him. ‘Thus a possible
compromise of the LISASI basehouse, linked directly to LIRIKG,
would not corpromise the LIcL1Uk basehousé which has no direct

link with the target.

3. Project LIONION was of direct assistance to the Station
on-two separate occasione in recent months:

a. As aresult of information received on a priority
basis (the same day as requested) from LIONION=1, the
Station was able to verify certain statements wade by
ESWARROW=1 concerning the locetion of LINING officials at
specific times. LIOMIOK-1 reported the times at which
these officials ceme in ard out of the LIKING compound and
provided a description of the clothes they re weering at
the time. LIGNION-l's information raised the possibility
that ESKAPROV-1 might at least tave been corfused in his
reporting of the times at wrich he met LIPRING personnel,

etc.
bh. In Karch 1969, LIé ti-l was able to provide

pictures of three ‘OLADY males, who, although unidentified,
fitted the general description and time frame furnished by

I GO. The latter suspected that two or three WOLADY
draft dodgers might visit LIRING to orrange trevel.to
PBRUMEN. The Station was able to furnish LNERCO.with
pictures of the three together with a report of their
arrival and departure from LIRING within three hours of
its request fur information, A Lionel infor ion was
promptly forwarded to Ii GO eas it tecame available from
LIOWICu=1. :

4. During the past year, LidhI0-1 acted as a dispatcher
for the LIE CE surveillence team on a number of occesions.
Ry utilizing. his ventaze point in the area of the target, ne is
atle to redio information to the L ERACE teag on the arrival
end departure of L1IRING officials thus allowing the team to
regain at a distsrce from the target unseen ty possible, counter.
surveillence from the target. The Station plens to use. LIONIOh-1
in this role rere extensively in the coming yeer whenever
surveillance of LIRINs personnel entails the teen's sence
rear the Lin compound. Such utilization of LIC {[Gi-1 should
lessen the risk of exposure of the team to the PHRUI. IS.

tents continues. to te cost gratifying. © prompt in
submitting both operational end administrative reports to the
Station. He is rcaéy, at a woments notice, te change personal
plans when a need fer his services es. After five years
without a substentiel vacation, LIcricn-l rlans a three week
trip from’ 4 = 25-Fay to Europe (Itsly, Greece, France) and the
U.S.Ae He originally requested five weeks to tske this trip
for which he has long saved his toney, but quite willingly ~
shortened the trip to three weeks at the Ststion's request and
added that he would postpone the entire trir it the Station
thought his services were more needed at hi « In order to

help defray the cost of making a second trip to Surope to
complete his original itinerary, the Station will give LICNTOk=1
a gift of $250 on 1 Say 1969 and will tell hin that consideration
will be given in 1970 to providing en equel szount, but no
decision can be made on that second gift until mid-1970.

E. Problems

1. LIsa As renorted in WMA 36553, 19 February
1969, LISALPAK/BAb was turned off for security reasons on
16 January 1969 at 1345 hours. All sutsequent attempts to
reactiva'e it heve been unsuccessful. arters was requested
to review ell availeble Station informaticn on this to decide
whether BAKER's abrupt end was the result of a compromise or
whether it was somehow connected with the installation of
‘ELEX equipment at LIFING.

2. In order to check the LISAMPAN/DOG take for items of

I. Costs

1. For the past project year, 1 January 1968 through
40 June 1969, it ts estimated that the total project cost will
be about £16,250. It is approved for $16,632.

2. For the renewal period of 1 July 1969 through

17 January 1968

HMMA-33841,

The AMOTs have received and reviewed a number of tho
prints from the LIONION operation and report that it
is a time-consuming and largely unproductive effort

The practical results of such a review, 1.e., the
identification of the greatest number of visitors to
LIRING, can be realized best through the widest cir-
culation of the prints among the AMOT staffers, con~
tacts, and informants. This practice would result
in wide knowledge of the existence mf the operation,
and in the expenditure of many.man-hours which, it
appears, could be more productively spent in other

pursuits.

The AMOT organization currently does not have either
the qualified personnel or available space and equip-
ment to process the film as suggested in paragraph
three of reference. Until they move into new quarters,
Uns hopefiLly! mid-1968, the single AMOT photographer
will be working in very tight quarters.

It would appear from JMWAVE's experience with AMOT exploitation

PROJECT LIONION RENEWAL REQUEST

A. Objectives:

1. Project LIONION is a long-term.support project designed
to provide fixed photographic, technical, and physical surveillance
of the PARUMEN Embassy and Consulate in Mexico City. The specific
objectives are:

“a. To furnish photographic coverage during the
daylight hours of the main ontrances to the target
installations,

b: ‘Yo matntain in readiness a listening post to
support technical operations against. the targets.

¢. To radio dispatch physical survelllance teams
against persons associated with the targets.

d. To provide for a mechanism which can fulfi11
various miscellaneous PBKUMEN support requirements.

2. The above-cited objéctives are in agreement Shc the over-
all objectives of Station Mexico City

B. Changes:

In late January 1967 the operational and administrative
responsibilities for Project LIONION were transferred from Howard A.
TRECKLEK to Cornelius L. PEUVION. No-agent handling, control, or
administrative problems were encountered during the past year.

C. Intelligence Production;

As noted in Section A above, Project LION{ON is an operational
support project and does not produce disseminable positive
intelligence. During the past year this project did provide over
5000 individual photographs of persons and/or vehicles entering
or leaving the target installations, aS well as approximately 8000
feet of pulse camera film. Information on the comings and goings
of target personnel and visitors to the installations, which
LI Y-1 provides in daily logs, has been incorporated into Station
files and on occasion made available to other stations or LNHARP
agencies, i.e., LNERGO. LION{ON has been particularly useful in
spotting new employees whose photos are then passed to LITAMIL=7
for identification.



teen

D. Effectiveness:

: 1. ...Project ‘LIONION is ‘considered by the Station to ve highly
effective and essential. In addition to providing the valuable
photographic covcrage cited above, LIONION-1 continues to provide
interesting observations on the personalities and activities of

thé personnel working in the targets. LIONION-1 reporting is

being incorporated into the recruitment operations targeted against

“LIRING=2 ‘atid LIRING-16,

In early July LIONION-1 obtained and furnished a new safe
Apartment which is being used for sensitive or lengthly meetings
with LIRESORT-1 as well as ‘LIONION-1. The safe site has been
Stocked with a sufficicnt supply of food so as to allow two persons
to live there for at least three days in the event the Station
ever needs a cooling-off site for an agent or defector.

3. Throughout the past project year ‘LIONION-1 continued to
function effectively as the radio ispatcher for the LIEMBRACE
Surveillance Team. Much of this effort was expended in estimating
the movement/habit pattern of LIRING-2, a prerequisite for his

pending recruitment.

E, Problems:

1. On 27 June LIONTON-1 was hospitalized for emergency
Surgery to treat a perforated ulcer. Since LIONION-2's presence
was required at the hospital during the operation and also through-
out the postoperative convalescence period, photographic coverage

was suspended until 10 July.
2. Other than a temporary postoperative morale slump on the

part of LIONION-1, there have been no significant personnel,

security, or administrative problems.

F. Liaison:
Not applicable to Project LIONION.

G. Interagency Coordination: :
Not applicable to Project LIONION.

H. Plans:

1. The Station plans to continue to exploit LIONION-1's
experience, training, and location to provide the photographic
coverage cited above. In addition, the Station plans to make more
extensive use of the operational lox books and personality
observations provided by LIONION-1 in support of an intensive

physical penetration program,



2. During the ensuing period, the Station plans to utilize
LIONION-2 and LIONION-2 as LP operators for a portion of the
i a LISAMPAN technical penetration operation. It is anticipated that
5 this additional tank will not be levied on LIONION-1 and LIONION-2

until after 1 January 1968.

I. Costs:

1. For the past project year, 1 January through 31 December
1967, it is estimated that the total Project cost will be about
39,000. It is approved for $11,666.

2. For the renewal period of 1 January through 31 December
1968, it is requested that $11,258 be approved. This is broken
down as follows:

The loan, which was placed in an escrow-type
fecount, was withdrawn in monthly: increments by LIONION-1 and
incorporated into his revolving fund. A detailed accounting was

coe eae dg cach month by LIONION-1, a practice which will be continued
during the ensuing project year.

comment on the desireability of continuing the photography

of persons entering and leaving the PBRUMEN Consulate. As
the station is aware this film is no longer reviewed at
JHWAVB: and there are no present plans to resume this practice
since in the past’ it proved unproductive and costly. The
film haa néver’ been reviewed on a regular basis at Head-

» MEMORANDUM FOR : Chief, WH Division

SUBJECT. . .? Renewal of Project LIONION
(Photographic/Technical Coverage
of Cuban Embassy in Mexico)

Benes r
ACTION REQUIRED: Approvals Requested Paragraphs One
and Four

1. Approval is requested to renew Project
LIONION for the period 1 January through 3t December
1967 at an annual expenditure of $11,666.00, including
$5,574.00 for FY 1967 and $6,092.00 for FY 1988, WH
Division programmed $12,000.00 for this activity for
FY 1967 and funds are available. The Project cost
has been increased by $668.00 over thé previous year,
occasioned by a small monthly raise for the Principal
Agent and a new provision for miscellaneous operational

expenditures,

2. Although this two-man Project does not
produce positive intelligence, it contributes. sub=
stantially and directly to the coverage of the Cuban
Embassy and Consulate in Mexico, producing photographs
in bulk of personnel und visitors as well as intorma-
tion on patterns of activity and personal associations,
and supporting recruitment attempts. It is contemplated
that the Project will afford support to the extensive
technical penetration of the Cuban Embassy (LISAMPAN)
currently scheduled for installation in mid-January
1967. One of these penetrations is scheduled for the
Embassy gatehouse where visitors would normally
identify ‘themselves upon entering. Information from
the gatehouse is to be transmitted securely to the
LIONION baSeliouse as well as to the LISAMPAN listening
Post. By collating this and other LISAMPAN intormation
with the photography, it is hoped to be able to identify
photographically many of the visitors to the Embassy.



3. The. physical security of the photo-basehouse
has been -improved and the overall security of the
Project“ is considered to be satisfactory, i

“4. It) will be noted that in February 1966 the
Station assisted LIONION-2, a Cuban citizen, to
: qualify for Mexican immigrant status with a’ loan of
$4,800.00, which was reduced to $27640.00 as of
31 December 1966 at a repayment rate of $240.00 per
month. Thisloan is being protected by an appropriate
Memorandum of Trust. Approval is requested to
continue this: arrangement until LIONION-2's immigra
tion status is settled, estimated to occur by :

30 November 1967,

*“ LIONION PROJECT RENEWAL

Ay Current Objectives:

There have been no changes in the objectives of the LIONION Project ao
© forth in the reneval requent of last year.

B. Changear

A imed the duties of Case Officer for LIONION since
the departure of Lawrence F,. BARKER in August 1966. TRECKLER is known to LIONION-1
and 2 as "Jose" or "Joe". TRECKLER meets with LIONION-1 at least once each

week and sees LIONION-2 only if he visits the LIONION basehouse, with the
departure of Hugh T,’PRANCOTTE (P) in Auguot 1966, Wulter W. CORNDURY (P)

assumed the duties of technical consultanc for the project, CORNBURY is known

to LIONION@1 and 2-8 "Jack". LIONION“1 is being given a pay increase of

$8.00 (U.S.) per month effective 1 January 1967, There are no other changes

contemplated for the coming year,

cHowdtd A, TRECKLER hao a

C. Intelligence Production;

The intelligence production is the sase as that reported in the renewal
request for last year, It is difficult to estimate the intelligence value ta
numbers of reports as there are so few positive reports made from this type of
production on the photographic end of the project. But this photographic
coverage is of inestimable operational intelligence value in coverage of the
PBRUMEN target. Should the LISAHPAN operation become active, part of LIONION’s
time will be used in support of that operation,

D, Effectiveness:

The Station's estimate of the value of this project has not changed from
that expressed in the renewal request of last year. LIONION has further es=
tablished his importance to the Station's operational activitics by demonstrating

his ability to spot surveillance targets at LIRING from only a physical descrip-
tion provided by the Case Officer. If the planned LISAMPAN activity gets underway,

LIONION observations and insight into activities of LIRING will be increased

greatly.
The apartment spotted by LIONION~1 and obtained by the Station across from

LIRING that was mentioned in last year's renewal request is scheduled to be

utilized in the LISAMPAN operation, The location of LIONION*1 across from the

target and hie background ‘knovledge built up over the years are invaluable essete
to the Station's coverage of the prioary target of the Related Mission Directive.

E. Problems;

ts There were no major problems during the-past year, One security problea
involved the claimed spotting of some of the photogrphic equipment from the
street by David M, WILSTED'(P), A thorough check of the basehouse by LIONION*1
and the Case Office failed to reveal any such equipuent as being visible from
he street, However, additional security measures were taken by darkening the
. background inthe room:béhind: the equipment through hanging of heavier drapes
‘on the. window," drapesoa the wall, and putting up a portable screen behind
the equipment... This also: serve: @ security check against the prying eyes
of the housetiold servant’ as LIONION-1 can now open the door ‘fully to the room :
when the servant pages him and she.cannot see the equipment. The other problea t
48 the obtaining of inmigrado status for LIONION-2. This involves the depositing
of funds to a bank account and is discussed under paragraph I,

F. Liaison:

There is no liaison involved in the project.
G. Interagency Coordination:
Not applicable, :

He Plans:

It is planned to have LIONION-1 keep spectal logs on the activities of
selected targets in LIRING as he has done over the past year, With the case
officer handling LIONION-1 directly on a weekly basis, it is planned to continue
picking his brains for additional details on the LIRING target. ilopefully :
LIONION-1 and 2 will be utilized for assistance in covering the proposed take

from the LISAMPAN operation,
i, Costs:

For Calendar Year 1966:

1, In the period 1 January through 30 June 1966, $4,500,00 was expended,
The projected expenditure for July 1966 through 31 December 1966 is $5,000,
Thie total project year expenditure is-approximately $1,000.00 under that
approved by Headquarters, However, this amount is probably due to having
drawn film and other supplics from overall Station: support without their
having been charged off againet the Project

provision has been made-for miscellaneous operational expenditures as there
rm@ay be-a recurrefice of ‘same as in the past project year for which no provision
was made,’ Provision is being made for charging of funda for supplies to the
LIONION Project which was not done iast yeac fo order that more accurate

bookkeeping may be followed,

In addition, the Station has had to make 9 loan to LIONION-2 for gaining status
to qualify for inmigrado'status in Mexico, This loan is held in a savings
‘account in a Mexican bank to prove to the Mexican authorities that LIONION-2
can support herself, Funds are withdrawn from this account mathly, sometimes
with interest, and deposited to a checking account where LIONION*1 withdraws
the funds and they are applied to the revolving account for financing the
operation, ‘The initial balance-deposited to the acco:nt in February 1966 was
$4,800.00, Withdravals have been made at the rate’ of $240.00 per month and

es of 30 October 1966, the total account had been reduced by $1,680.00, leaving
a. balance in the account’ of $3,120.00 which should carry the account through
November 1967. ”.A séparate dispatch follows with the Memorandum of Trust and
Recessary details on the account. Approval is requested for continuance of
this account in order that LIONION-2 may obtain her inmigrado status,

2. Dispatch physical survetllance.teams against persons
associated with the target.

3. Keep in readinéss @ Sstening post (LP) for the monitoring
and recording of techiteal penetrations of the target.

Assist the Station in building up individual dossiers on
officials of the target installation,

5, ‘Monitor Station activities involving direct contact with
the target, and furnish an observation post (OP) for

other Station assets.

Objectives 4 and 5 are additions tu those objectives set forth in the
original project outline.

B. Changes. There have been no changes in personnel and none are contem=
plated Ja the coming year, It 19 betng proposed in separate correspondence that
Pome of the.work lond now on LIONION-1 be shifted to Headquarters, specifically

the development of film,

LIONION-1"e pay was tncreased 40 dollara 2 aonth effective 15 March 1965.

H. Elens, Ie 1s planned to wake better use of LIOXION“1'@ observations and
operational los books during the coming year rather than settle for his excellent
photographs alone, It has been found that he can often supply valuable additional
information tecause of his "feel" for those persons who ace under constant obaer-
vation from the LIONION tse. LIONION=1 can read significance into activity which
might go unnoticed or be misinterpreted by observers with lesa experience,

LIONION PROJECT RENEWAL

A. Current Objectives: This Project is a technical, currently

primarily photographic, surveillance operation against the Cuban’
Embassy and Consulate in Mexico City. Its original objectives,
still current, include furnishing photographic coverage during
daylight hours of the Embassy and Consulate entrances; furnishing
a control point for. dispatching physical surveillance teams
against persons associated with the target; and furnishing
a listening post (LP) in readiness to monitor and record
~technical audio penetrations of the target. Two new cbjectives
added during the Project year include assisting Station Mexico
City to build up individual dossiers on target offictals; and
affording an observation post for Station activities involving
direct contact with the target. These new objectives are in
consonance with Priority A, Objective 1 of the current Related
Mission Directive for Station Mexico City.

B, Changes: There have been no chinges in personnel and none
are conterplated during the coming year, Headquarters is
assuming the task of developing some of the film exposed

under this Project. LIONION-1's pay was increased $40 per
month effective 15 March 1965,

C, Intelligence Production: The Project is not designed to
produce disscminable information. It produced thousands of
excellent photographs during the year which were shared with
Headquarters and Station JMWAVE. Information on the comings
and goings of target personnel and visitors to the target have
been incorporated into many Station files, principally. the
dossier files. No precise statistics are available, but at
least 100 exposures are made daily during target working hours,

D, Effectiveness: The Project is considered highly successful
and essential by the Staton, In addition to the excellent photo-
graphic coverage provided, LIONION-1, the Principal Agent, has
developed into a first-class asset for other operational duties,
The Project Basehouse was essential to mounting and monitoring
the Station's attempt at recruitment and subscquent harassment
of a sensitive target employee. The Case Officer in charge of
the attempt sat with LIONION-1 for several woeks observing the
movement pattern of the targét employee, LIONION-1 manned one
of the radio dispatch posts used to control the physical

_ surveillance of the target employee while near the Baschouse.


/
|

Without the Baschouse and LIONION-1's expert knowledge of the
target personnel and activities, such an operation could not

have been mounted. The operation itself. was an attempt to
Satisfy the t6p priority requirement laid-on Station Mexico City
by Headquarters. “It is expected that future similar. operations
ill depend to’a’ large extent on the facilities provided by

this Project, F

Another very effective performance by LIONION-1 was his
obtaining, by sharp observation and quick, intelligent and
secure action, an apartsent in a building directly across
the street from the target. The Station had been sccking
an apartment in this building for many years,

E.. Problems: The only problem currently besetting the Project
is the excessive work load on the Principal Agent. To alleviate
this, Headquarters is assuming the task of developing some of
the film produced by the Project.

Cover for LIONION-1 has ceased to be a problem. He has
received his permanent immigrant status and now has a good deal
ot immunity from harassment from Mexican immigration authorities.
He was able to get his translator cover backstopped directly
eut of the Office of, the President of Mexico and thus has a
strong protective security factor built into it,

F, Liaison: The Project has’ no liaison connection, LIONION-1's
cover backstop with the Office of the President of Mexico is non-
operational,

G. Interagency Coordination: Not applicable.

H. Plans: It is planned to make better use of LIONION-l's
observations and operational logbooks during the ouming year
rather than to.settle for his excellent photographs alone.
It has been found that he can often supply valuable additional
information because of his "feel" for those persons who are
under constant observation from the Basehouse, He can- read
Significance into activity which might go unnoticed or be
misinterpreted by observers with less experience. He will
also be called upon fér assistance in future recruitment
operations similar to: the case mentioned in paragraph D
above, Several such operations are being contemplated for”
calendar year 1966, the period for which the Project renewal
is being requested,

I. Costs: For calendar year 1965:



“In the period 1 January through’ 31 October 1965,
$7,218.20 has been expended, At this rate, some $9,200.00 will be
expended by the end of the calendar year 1965,

MEMORANDUM FOR: wi/efo
SUBJECT :  LIONION Project

1. LIONION 1s a new project which ig submitted in the
rveillance opera-
tion targetted against the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City. Two
agents are involved; LIONION-1, a young Cuban lawyer: in exile,
and LIONION-2, his mother. The agents act a» ubservers and
photographers. LIONION-1 is also used as a dispatcher for the
LIEMBRACE surveillance team, from which he 1s compartmented,
to cover individuals associated with this target. These agents
were previously used in connection with the unilateral tele.
phone tap operation against the Cuban Emba The current
photographic operation began in the Jatter part of 1962,
and was previously. funded under Cuban FI funds, The operation
has provided’ valuable data tor the identification of Cuban
Embassy personnel and visitors, and on their patterns of
action and personal associations

: The security of this operation, particularly the
agent's cover for status and the communications arrangements,
appear reasonably sound, Both agents know that they are
working for AIS, and LIONION-1 was successfully FLUITERED

in October 1963. However, LUTAMIL-7 and LITAMIL-9, who are
Penctrations of thé Cuban Embassy, are aware of this
activity, as they are used to help identify individuals
photographed.

3. Approval for the LIONION Project is recommended,
It is requested that, in order to assist Headquarters!
evaluation, project reporting include details of CI/CE data

furnished, and examples of leads developed from such information.
