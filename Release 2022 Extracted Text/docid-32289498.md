by the Miami Office relative to Cafe D'Artist, 732 Biscayne

that operators of such establishment

vere possibly former contacts of the subject in Havana.

relative to information furnished by NY 3368-C-TE on 4/2/62

that subject source believed TRAFFICANTE operates Local 136

TAMPA DIVISION

AT TAMPA, FLORIDA

Will maintain contact with informants and

confidential sources to report activities of the subject.

Will continue to explore employment of highly

confidential Bureau techniques on subject's close

associates.

ADMINISTRATIVE:

Bureau letter to Tampa dated 4/26/62 pointed out

that even though the subject maintained an apartment and

spends a great deal of time at Miami, Florida, office of

origin should not be changed in this investigation at this

time. The Bureau noted it was felt that the subject continues

to exercise substantial control of hoodlum activites in the

Tampa area and is his original base of operation. The

Bureau noted Tampa should continue its efforts to penetrate

the TRAFFICANTE operations and that every effort should be

made to establish highly confidential sources rèlative to

subject's operations so as to be in a position to accurately

report all his present operations and Interests.

The Bureau accepted reports should be submitted

at intervals no longer than 30 days and that Miami and Tampa

should submit weekly airtel summaries rather than daily

teletypes and rather than 15-day reports. The Bureau further

noted that these instructions should in no way be construed:

as a lessening of investigative endeavors.

On 4/16/62, MIKE LISMAN, Corporal, New York State

Troopers, Liberty, New York, confidentially advised SA

JORN A. AKERN that JERRY GREITZER, presently incarcerated at

Jenny charg

Sing Sing Prison, Ossining, New York, had information on

SANTO TRAFFICANTE and had given a statement to the New York

State Police

concerning him. LISMAN requested the New York

State Police not be identified as the original source of this

information as it would point to him, and under his regulations,

he is required to forward his information up the chain of

command, and the decision of whether or not to disseminate

The New York Office advised JERRY GREITZER was a

former symbol informant of the New York Office, NY 3081-C.

He was discontinued 1/10/61 when incarcerated at the

police barracks, Ellenville, New York.

An FD-302

reflecting GREITZER's interview is maintained in his

New York Office 137 file. There is no indication in

his 137 file that he has furnished anything but reliable

information. New York further noted that GREITZER

stated that he hoped the information furnished would be

forwarded to the Attorney General of the United States so

that someone could get him out of jail early and he could

go to work in Tampa for TRAFFICANTE and at the same time

furnish information to the FBI. He was advised that

this was not possible.

New York further noted that it was felt that

FREITZER was capable of taking facts which are essentially

true and relating them by fabrication to captioned

investigation, realizing the importance of information

concerning TRAFFICANTE and believing such information might

result in his early release..

JOHN JOSEPH VITAL, a racket figure from st. Louis;

missourt, subject of st. Louis

file 92-158, accompanied by

SAM ROTH of St. Louts, arrived Tampa International Airport

AM, 5/8/62 to, according to St. Louls source, look into the

tomato business in conjunction with produce business VITALE

had in St. Louis.

Fisur of JOHN JOSEPH VITALE and ROTH was conducted

by Tampa agents and VITALE was not observed during fisur

to be in contact with SANTO TRAFFICANTE, JR. They were

observed, however, to have been in contact with FRANK and

ANTONIO DIECIDUE, FRANK DIECIDUE, subject of Tampa file

92-22, Bufile 92-4636, who are associates of SANTO TRAFFICANTE.

Fisur established VITALE didvisit tomato outlets

in the greater Tampa area and contact with TP 75-C* failed

to establish VITALE mentioning subject of this case.

J. C. VALENTI, owner of J. C. Valenti and Company,

Farmer's Market, Tampa,

Florida,

contacted in the recent past by a JOHN and a SAM from St. Louls,

Missouri relative to purchasing tomatoes for subsequent

distribution at St. Louis. He had met them on one occasion

only and was introduced to them by ANTONIO DIECIDUE, who is

also in the tomato market.

VALENTI stated he had p eviously

been contacted, a short period of time prior to the above,

by two other individuals from St. Louis, one of whom he

recalled was named LOPICCOLO and another unknown white male

(ANTHONY GIORDANO), whom he stated were interested in the

banana business in

Tampa for subsequent distribution in

st. Louis.

He said these individuals were met by him on

one occasion only, not having ever know them before and

that they were introduced to him by ANTONIO DIECIDUE.

subject is reported missing from Miami and his car was

located on 5/11/62 at Miami International Airport and the

possibility had existed he may have been in contact with

such:individuals while they were in Tampa
