20. (Confidential - LJK) LIAISON Met with James Fellenbaum,

Senate Appropriations Committee staff, to discuss the FX78 budget.

Fellenbaum indicated that the Senate Appropriations Committee

would have to treat the issue of intelligence-related costs due to

the fact that the House Appropriations Committee has shown

such interest in this matter. I informed him that the House

Appropriations Committee is scheduling a hearing on intelligence-

related costs on 8 March 1977.

Fellenbaum also said that it appears Senator William W.

Proxmire (D., Wis.) and Senator Clifford P. Case (R., N.J.)

will join the Intelligence Subcommittee of Senate Appropriations

Committee.

21. (Unclassified - LLM) LIAISON Advised Art Kuhl,

Senate Foreign Relations Committee staff, of the number of Agency

employees covered by the upcoming foreign service list to be submitted

to the Senate.

The information was supplied by Tom Carney, CCS.

22. (Unclassified - LLM) LIAISON Spoke with Paul Daly, FBI,

on the present state of affairs with respect to the House Select Committee

on Assassinations.

Daly advised that at the requests charmal tenry B.

Gonzalez (D., Texas) to the Attorney General the Committee staffers will

no longer be provided access to the unclassified material they have been

reviewing within the Department of Justice.

Daly is hopeful that Chairman Gonzalez will approve the security

clearance stardards and once this is in motion the first clearances should

start coming through in about 30 days. I asked Daly to keep us advised as

to the progress on the clearances matter to pave the way for our next

coordinated step within the Executive Branch to seek Chairman Gonzalez's

and Representative Samuel L. Devine's (R., Ohio) agreement on procedures

for access to classified information.
