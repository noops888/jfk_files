March Movement, and became the aide of Major Rolando CUBELA =
Secades at the Escambray mountains. Upon the overthrow of

of Captain of the Revolutionary Army. In May 1960, he was
assigned Chief of the Transportation Repair Shop. Zone H-7;
Institute of Agrarian Reforn (INRA), located in San Jose de
Las Lajas, Havana. In January 1961, he was apprehanded by the
Cuban authorities, and charged of cooperating with a counter—
revolutionary movement headed by ex-Cuban Major Cesar PAEZ.
Though Source indeed sent weapons to Paez, he denied it, and
the Cuban authorities could not prove Gonzalez connection: with
the Paez movement. He was released from jail in May 1961 and
he was reassigned to INRA, San Jose de Las Lajas, but was not
appointed to a specific job. In: August 1961. he was approached
by Major Enrique OROPEZA who offered him a job with the State
Security Department (DSE). His first assignment was to infil-
trate a suspected counterrevolutionary organization being
formed by personnel of the Transportation Repair Shop, INRA
Zone H-7. Oroveza said that he was ideal for the assignment
because he has just been released from prison, and the counter-
revolutionaries would have confidence in him. Source did not
accept Oropeza's Proposition, and in turn warned the members
of the Transportation Repair Shop. From August 1961 to April
1962, he was Chief of discipline of Hermano Gomez Technical
School (former Belen College), Havana. In December 1961, he
was discharged from the Revolutionary Army, but continued to

his wife Zenaida ARCE Fernandez who is living at 35-25 164th St.,
Flushing, New York, and whom he resmarried by proxy on 6 April
1969. Upon divorcing ARCE, Source moved to Cubela's home,

38 Street, Havana (exact address unknown), where he lived until
Cubelats arrest by theCuban authorities for plotting to kill
Fidel CASTRO. on the day in which Cube $

drinks during carnivals) at a Carnaval in Havana. and did not
sleep at Cubela's house. When he returned to Cubela's house
he learned from Cubela's mother, Virginia SECADES, that Cubela
had been arrested and that the house had been searc
Cuban police, Other persons which were apprehended for Plotting,
with Cubela, against the regime, were Ramon GUIN,: Alberto Blanco,
(FNU) GALLARRETA, and two unidentified Cubans. (Source denied
having any knowledge of the Plot, though he suspected that some—
thing was going on). Source was never interrogated by the
Police on Cubela's Plot, but noted that he was being followed

by DSE agents. Prior to Cubela's arrest Major Faure CHOMON

and Efigenio ALMEJEIRA, two or three times a week, visited

Cubela and engaged in private talks. Source never Participated ~

the private talks between Chomon, Almejeira and Cubela.
The last time he talked to Chomon was on 24 December 1965, when
Source made a social visit to Chomon at his house in El Vedado
(address unknown), accompanying Cubela and Guin. Politics was
not discussed during the occasion. Gonzalez attended Cubela's
trial accompanying Cubela's mother. Source could not provide
details of the proceedings other than saying that “the Cuban
authorities knew everything about the plot: Cubela made
about a one-hour long speech on his behalf; in his speech he
admitted he had had

( fou) a Cuban exile, Alberto Blanco, and ROBENO (fnu),
Was not going to be pursued. Cubela also admitted having a

unknown). About four months after Cubela's trial, Gonzalez
visited Major Victor DREKE at his home, near Havana Zoo.
(Source has met Dreke in 1957,

ia EL Escambray). He told Dreke that he wa:
by DSE agents. Dreke told Gonzalez that he wa:
the matter with Jose ABRAHANTES, Chief of the DSE. Since
Gonzalez visit to Dreke, Source did not notice being surveilled,

Gonzalez thought of an opportunity of leaving Cuba with the
help of Peyrot. He married Peyrot two or three munths after
they first met. Peyrot made an attempt to get an Uruguayan
visa for Gonzalez, and in her attempt she made a long distance
telephone call, to Uruguay, to an Uruguayan doctor named Carmen
(lnu), who Peyrot claimed was the personal doctor of the Uruguayan
Minister of Interior. Peyrot also told Source that Carmen was
the one who got ‘her into accepting the Cuban contract. Failing
to get an Uruguayan visa for Gonzalez, Peyrot opted for paying
Gonzalez airplane fare to Madrid. Source had limited knowledge
of Peyrot's background. She had been in Cuba from 1963 to 1964.
Gonzalez became suspicious that Peyrot was cither working for
the Cuban intelligence or the CIA, when'she began asking him
captious questions about himself. In public, openly and unafraid,
she expressed disaffection toward the Cuban regime. At an
occasion, she suggested to Gonzalez, that once he arrived in

. Spain, to contact Robeno "El Mago", in Barcelona, and to join
him in working for.the CIA. .Six months. prior to her departure
from Cuba Peyrot visited, two or. three times a week, an office
of an alleged Brazilian dentist, that was located in a building
in front of El Hotel Capri, 21st Street, Havana. Source never
met the Brazilian dentist. In November 1968, Peyrot supposed
to have left Cuba for Uruguay via Mexico. Source, and other (am
unidentified friends, who went to the airport to say good-by #
to Péyrot the day she left Cuba, did not see.her.taking the
Mexico airplane flight, though the passengers were easily.
distinguished when they were entering the airplane. Shortly
after Peyrot left Cuba (date unknown), Gonzalez divorced her
on the grounds of default. (Field Comment: Source had a
difficult time remembering the dates in reference to his

_ personal history. He seemed to be anxious’ to cooperate, and

. Baid that he was going to write to his ‘sent wife (now in
the U.S.), and ask her to send him a copy.of his divorce papers,
in order to confirm some of the dates. which he was not sure of.
It is interesting to note that a Myrta TEIJEIRO, an Uruguayan
doctor was mentioned by Julio RIVAS Delgado (see Memorandum for
the Record to CAS, Madrid, dated 20 November 1968, paragraph 22),
where Rivas stated that she has visited the Cuban Embassy in
Madrid at approximately the same period Mirtha PEYROT left Cuba.
Though it may be coincidental, it is probable. that Mirtha Peyrot
and Myrta Teijeiro are the same person. ‘Source did not divulge
any information on his past associations with Mirtha’ Peyrot in
his initial interrogation at the Cuban Reception Office (ORC),
because he was afraid of discussing sensitive matters with the
ORC interrogator. He stated that he has a seven-year old son
4m Cuba, and is afraid that the Cuban authorities may take
repraisals by not letting his son exit Cuba if they, the Cuban
authorities, would find out that he has brought the subject of
Peyrot to the attention of the Cuban inturrogator at. the ORC.
Source stated that he is willing.to cooperate in any wiy: possible
