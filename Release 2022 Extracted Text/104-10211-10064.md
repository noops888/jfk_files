9 August 1965
SUBJECT: Report of Interrogation of 6 August 1965

1. Today's session was from 1000 to 1200 and from
13085 to 1410. As planned, ( started the session by sum-
marizing for Subject the results of the first six sessions,
listing for him approximately twenty points on which he had
failed badly. (Summary list attached.) At first Subject
attempted to contest the points as I cited them, for exam-
ple, on the variations in the KOBULOV story, and on the
location of ROZHENKO's office, but when I gave him the
facts he did not challenge them and he listened to most of
the litany in silence. I told Stbject that the resulte of
t sessions had confirmed further the previous findings.
I asked him why he continued to cling to his legend, and
reminded him that he bad turned down the opportunity
spring to change his mind while ve
teps to preserve his operational useful-
ness. I said that this opportunity was now past, but that
I did not want to conceal from him the fact that he still
had knowledge and information which could be useful to us.
However, there was atime limit even to this. I reminded
hin tuee he had been out of circulation for a long time
and t! many things had happened in the world and especially
in the Soviet Union during this time; for example, KHRU-
SECHEV wes no longer in power (Subject's comment, a5 ex-
pected, was "Thank God!"). Otber changes had taken place.
If Bubject did not make up his mind to tell the truth, his
490 days could easily turn into 4000, and he would not be
of interest to anyone. I told Subject again, that he had
nothing to fear, no matter what he had done in the past,
that we vould not prosecute him for any past crimes, no
matter how bad. If he were worried about reprisal from
Soviet security organs, I told him that we were just as
capable of keeping his confession secret as we were of keep-
ing secret the fact that we knew he @ provocateur for
@ year and a half before his defection. I promised hin

SECiel



that he would be given normal living conditions ss soon -
as he started to cooperate by telling the real truth. (A
complete transcript of this part of the session is being
done for the record.)

2. As expected, Subject'’s only response to all this
was that he had told the fruth--with allowances for mis-
tal on minor points of detail owing to forgetfulnet
and that he would continue to tell nothing but. He
that despite his grievances over his treatzent he con-
tinued to be willing to serve American Intelligence in any
way he could, short of returning to the USSR, of course.
He complained that I denied and contradicted everything
Be said, great and small, and said that be could see by
many remarks that I had made that I thought thet he had
never served in the KGB as a staff officer but had perhaps
been an agent for the KGB. This, he said, was completely
excluded, and X should know that it ia not possible for
the KGB to recruit the son of a minister as an agent. I
replied simpiy that ! hase of several cases ehere not only
children of ministers but even more important people had
served in this capacity.

S. Another interesting remark that Subject made was
that be fully appreciated the fact that his knowledge was
rapidly getting dated. He mentioned that this applied not.
only to his knowledge. of the KGB, but also to what he
knew about prominent moabers of the Central Committee of
the CPSU. I said that he had not provided snything of
interest on this subject, and he replied that there had mot
been an opportunity, implying that there was much that he
bad to offer in this field. It is planned to explore his
knowledge on this next week. 7

4. Subject complained that we had not checked his
story sufficiently and pointed. that thousands of boys
had studied in the sane schools he had and that we
should be able to get confirmation somewhere. Here he made
an interesting remark as follows: ‘Incidentally, when I
first came here I understocd from something that Mr. Peter
Bagley waid that you hi operational contact with a Spar-

‘ jak KAZAKOV. Be was also in the Baku Naval Preparatory
Beboot with me."

5. Subject was questioned in sowe detail shout hia .
duties as a SCD officer on the big public holidays. Sub- E
Ject's description was generally accurate, and even quite
good as long as he kept his answers general. When forced
to be more specific he made 2 nusber of mistakes about the
procedures involved, such as insisting that instructions r
for the holiday were iseued by the chief of the department H
without the participation of a 9th Directorate officer, >
about the preparation of the duty and guest lists for '
passes, which lead ne to conclude that he did not stand = |

duty there as o KGB officer. He was unable to remember as
Single delegation that he had been assigned to watch, al-
though be maintained that he had pulled such duty every
year since 1957. However, on the basis of his otherwise
very good familiarity with Red Square and the procedures
of parades there, I would conclude that he has attended
pete than one such event as a guest, or perhaps with his
‘ather.

6. After the luncheon break, I started to question
Subject os his first marriage. As before, Subject was
wneble op unwilling to remember any of the data that would
enable us to pin this story down. He does not resexber
exactly when he set Telegina, the date of Telegin's arrest,
the date of the marriage, the location of the ZAGS office
where the marriage was registered, or even the year of
birth of iis wife (1928 or 1929). Subject siaply made no
effort to answer these questions, and for this reason the
questioning proceeded to Subject's first passport.

7. Asked where and when he received bis first internal
passport, Subject said that he thought it was in Moscow in
early 1944 befose leaving for Leningrad. Reminded that this
was a change from his previous story that he had gotten
bis first passport in Leningrad, Subject replied that he
hadn't remembered it, and that in any case he also got a
passport in Leningrad. Asked to describe the purpose of
the internal passport system;-Subject's answer would enbar-
rasa any real SCD officer. He insists that all Soviet
citizens over the age of 16, except those on active military
service and prisoners, have passports.

S. Asked to describe the surroundings of Ul Narodnaya,
where be lived from 1956 to his departure, Subject'’s answer

ves in general quite good. As before, he vas unable to
name correctly the city rayon in which bis reridence vas
located.

9. Asked to describe his entry into the Naval Pre-
paratory School in Leningrad in 1944, Subject at first
geve a vague and unsatisfactory anaver, and when pressed
for details he became irritated and said that his father
had arranged it all po blatu. The session was ended on
this note.
