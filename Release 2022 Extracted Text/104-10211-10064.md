SUBJECT:

Roport 0f Interrogation of 6 August 1965

1.

Today's session was fron 1000 to 1200 and fros

1305 во 1410.

As planned, ( started the session by sun-

marIzing for subject the results of the first six sessions.

liating for him approximatoly twenty points on which so had

fallod badly.

(Sunnary 118t attachod.)

At first Subject

atteuptod to contest the points as l cited then, for exams-

ple,

on the variations in the KOBULOV story,

and on the

JOCAtIOn OS ROZHANKO's OffiCo, but when I

gave his the

facts he did not challenge then and ho listened to most of

the litany in silonco.

I told

subjoct that the results of

these sessions had confirmed furtber the previous Ilndinga.

I asked hin why he continued to cling to bis legend, and

reminded hin that he bad turned down the opportunity

offered to bin last spring to chango hia mind ubilo no

still could take: stops to preservo hia operational uselul

negs. I sald that this opportunity was now past, but that

I did not vant to conceal fron him the fact that be still

had knowlodge and infornation thich.could be useful to us.

However,

thore vas aitino linit even to this.

I realoded

him that be had been out of circulation for a long t1ne

and that sany things had happened in the world and especially

In the soviet Unlon during this time; for example, XHRU-

BICHNY URs nO lOnger in power (Subject's comment, as ex-

pocted, vas "Thauk God!").

Otber changes had taken place.

If Subjoct did not make up his mind to tell the truth, bla

490 days could easily turn into 4000, and he rould not be

of interest to anyone.

I told Subjoct again, that ho bad

nothing to fear, no matter what he had done in the past.

that ve would not prosecute hin for any past crines, no

matter boy bad.

If be were worried about reprisal fron

Soviet security organs, I told hin that ve vero just as

capablo of Keeping his COnfessiOn secret as te were ul keep-

1ng socret tho fact that no know he was a provocatour for

a yoar and a hall before his defoction.

I promised bla

tatos on minor points of detall oving to jorgetiulness-

and that he rould continue to tell nothing but. Ho sair

that despito his grievances over his treatment he con

to be willira to serve American Intelligence in any

way ho could, short of returning to the USSR, of course.

Ho complained that l denlod and contradicted everything

Bo sald, great and saall, and said that be could see by

many rewarks that I had nade that I thought that he had

nover served In the KGB an a stall officer but had perhaps

boes an agent for the KGB.

This, ho sald, was completely

excluded,

and I should know that

it 1a not poseille 10r

the IGB to recruit the son of a ainiater as an agent.

repiiri sippiy tünt I lner i sororal cages there sot saly

children of ainistera but even sore important people had

servod in this capacity.

Another interesting renark that Subject wade was

that ho fully approciated the lact that his knomledgo ras

rapidly gettine dated.

he nentioned that this applied not

only to his knowledge of the KGB, but also to vhat be

knes about prominont moabers of the Central Committee of

the epsu.

I sald that he had not provided anythiag of

Interest on this subject, and he replied that there had sot

been an opportualty,

implying that there was such that be

bad to offer in this flold.

It is planned to exploro his

knowlodge on this next reek.

Subject complained that we had not checked his

story sufflclently and pointed out that thousands of boya

had studled in the sane schools as he had and that re

should be able to goi confirnation soneuhere.

Here be nade

an Interesting remark as jollows:

'Incidentally, when I

I1rst cano here I understood fron sonething that Mr. Poter

Eagley sald that you have oporational contact vith a Spar-

taX KAZAKOY. He was also In the Baku Naval Preparatary

School with ne."

joct's description vas generally accurate, and even quIto

good as long as he kept lils ansters general.

"hes forced

to Do sOro spACIlle he sade a number of mistakes about the

procedures involved, such as inglsting that instructions

for the hollday vero laaued by the chlel of the department

althout the participation of a 9th Directorato officor.

about the preparation of the duty and quest lists for

passes, which lead se to conclude that be did not stand

duty there as a KGB officer.

He was unablo to remember a

tingle delegation that ho had boan assigned to watch, al-

though he maintained that he had pulled such duty every

pear sInCe 1957.

However, on the basis of his othermine

Very good lanillarity vlth dod square and the procedures

of parades there, I would conclude that he has attended

nore than one such event as a quest, or perhaps with bis

fathor.

B. After the luncheon break, I started to questlon

Subject os his f1rst aarriage.

As before, Subject was

unable on unilling to reneuber any of the data that mould

Eubject slaply nado so

offort to ansuer these questions; and for this roason ¿bo

questioning proceeded to Subject's firet passport.

asked whore and when he received bla tirst 1nterral

passport, Subject said that he thought it was 1n Moscor 1D

carly 1844 before leaving for Lenlagrad. Benindod that tale

vas a change fron his previous story that ha had gotten

Dis first passport In Lenlagrad, Subject replied that ho

hadn't resombered 1t, and that in any case he also got a

passport 1n Leningrad.
