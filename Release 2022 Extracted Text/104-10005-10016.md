1. Peraconversation this AM with Martin, he has no information
on Soviet: hunting clubs. He never belonged to one, and had been
hunting oniy once in his life. His opinion was that it was not worth
my trouble to come see him in person and that anything else he might
say on the subject would be a "poor guess."

2. Bob Steele called about :1445 to say that KAZNACHEYEV had been
hit on the subject of hunting clubs, and could contribute nothing.
At the age of 1 he had known a hunter, but that was the extent of his
knowledge of the sport. According to Bob, he added nothing further
except to express the opinion that a hunting club would not be connected
directly to a factory.

3. The manual of library acquisitions was reviewed and the only Nove
periodical relating to hunting ebsexved was "Okhota i Okhotnich'ye
Khozyaystvo" which is published monthly. The July 196 copy was acquired
from the Library Periodicals section. A Soviet book listing al1(?)
periodicals was checked and no publications were observed under the
