MEMORANDUM FOR: Chairman, GS-13 Evaluation Board
SUBJECT : Recommendation for Promotion to GS-14 -—_——--

Charlotte Bustos-Videla

1, It is recommended that Charlotte Bustos-Videla be promoted
from GS-13 to GS-14,

2, The performance of this officer has been characterized for
many years by all of her supervisors as consistently strong to out-
standing, She has been able to establish herself as indispeusable in
each Headquarters Branch or Field Station asd gnment, usually
functioning as the backbone of the unit to which assigned, Since return
to Headquarters in September 1972 from her field assignment in Mexico,
her performance has been entirely congruent with the thrust of the
Field Station's enthusiasm over her ability, performance, attitude and
growth potential, She is currently chief of-the Cuban and CA Section
of her branch, and has established once again her mastery over her
pai duties, She is the kind of sound, dependable, yet
ne greatly appreciated by her supervisors, In
short, she is a true professional who performs beyond her geade level,

3. In regard to her potential, she has served in the Agency
since 1951, starting as a secretary/stenographer, and adyancing
brilliantly with,each new challenge offered, She achieved professional
Status in 1958 and has spent the bulk of her time since then specializing
in Latin Americah affairs, demonstrating total flexibility in assignments,
a voracious appetite for work and a penchant for exceptionally precise
and thorough production, A review of her carcer to date can lead to the
conclusion that she has always risen successfully to each new
professional challenge, and is still far from reaching her maximum
capacities, While she has had little supervisory experience in the
field, her supervisor was of the-ophion that she is a "natural leader",
This has been borne out in her'perfermance in her current capacity
asa Branch Section Chief, in which she has demonstrated exemplary
supervisory ability, Notwithstanding her drive, aggressiveness and
professional aplomb, She is a popular co-worker, ts receptive to guidance
and sensitive and responsive to the needs of her subordinates,

4, This employee has utilized her fluency in the Spanish language
to maximum advantage in her work, Formal testing recently confirmed 1
her high proficiency in that language, Coupled with a comprehensive
training record and her Invaluable experiences over a twenty year
period, she has become particularly effective in Latin American
operations and operational support, demonstrating excellence in each ‘
of several recognized specializations, including CI operations,
functfonal support, reports and requirements, area support and varied

covert action activities, a : :

5, The officer's adaptability, high intelligence and mastery over
her trade was of inestimable value to Mexico City Station, and over a
five year period from 1967 to 1972, she functioned as the Station's
internal trgubleshooter, Her duties included the maintenance of

target analysis, reperts writing, operational support,
har agents, and special assignments as the

Chief of Sanon'e Executive Assistant,

6, The employce is occasionally called upon by the Office of
Training to administer specialized training, and she was chosen
recently to attend the Mid-Career Course ending In December 1972,
Meanwhile, her absence from her new job ts felt sorely by the
Branch, ff is expected that her current assignment will last about,

two years,

7, Wi summary, we have here an exceptional officer who has

been performing at the level of a GS-14 for some years; it is now
time to promote her fo that grade commensurate with her performance

and which she so justly deserves,

-}-depth -knowledge of the targets this section 1:

In reviewing my previous fitness report and
those of my esses on this fine officer, I find myself hard put
not to repeat what has been said so often before. She has been the back-|
bone of this section and of those where she has worked previously. Her
work has always shown exce!lent judgement and ingenuity. A self-starter
with tremendous drive and discipline, the amount of work she has produ
has been prodigious. ._An_excellent team worker, she has never shirked wh
@s so often happens ~- she is asked to take on additional work or work ca
a matter outside of her regular field. While forceful, she is diplomatis
and tactful and is able to present suggestions and criticisms in a plea~
gant manner. She is one of the most dedicated persons I have met in the
Organization, and exceptionally dependable. While, as a'woman and a
Specialist, she has had little opportunity to handle agents she has done
very well with those we have given her to handle. She has showed great
ability in the training of two transcribers and in the debriefing of two |

female agents and their husbands. This is in large part due to her in~ |
ne “The past few

working on.
months have boen difficult, requiring the complete reorganization of this
Section and the termination of the majority of our assets. - Under this
stress, she has performed in her usual outstanding amanner. Perhaps,
even a little better. Her handling of a great deal of file work has bee!
excellent, probably in part because she was the one who set it up and has|

maintained it in its present very good state. (continued)

The one criticism of this Officer's work that I and others
have made in the past still stands. She tries to do everything

and somethings in this business just don't deserve the attention

Although in my opinion there is an excessive uso of "outstanding"
by the vaiing officer, I’am in accord with his narrative comments.
Subject is definitely more than an IA and has performed as such whon
the station has required an individual with in-depth knowledge of
station procedures, operational awareness combined with an ability to
propare studies in a short period of timo. She's thorough, concise ~
and vapid. One of our hardest workors and most dependable employees.

Three rather personalized comments might add meaning
to this fitness report. Anyone, particularly a female,
fitting the above description of efficiency and achievement
can be, and often is a little overbearing and difficult to
work with as a person. Subject, withall, is a pleasant
Porsonality who knows how to make her contributions and
comments in a forthright but tactful manner. Secondly, and
this one is a littlo hard to say, Subject in her voracious
appetite for.all kinds of facts can at times put undue
emphasis on them including factual minutiac as against
equally important but more clusive subjective factors.

Thirdly, this rating officer has personally observed Subject -
only working on station premises at an office job, and
frankly has no idoa how she might function in outside
operational work (cultivating poople, | ]

fa the vs
Section sae r
In July 1969 Subject was transferred from fhe iGuby Sectibn to the
Station froat office to serve as an executive assistant to the COS with
special, responsibility for ensuring that the paper flow of the Station
remainéed-under effective control during the period of transition re-
sulting from the assignment here of several senior officers. This
transition period necessitated or gave rise to a number of changes in
the management and adninistrative areas of the Station. Subject's
performance in this assignment under these circumstances was clearly,
outstanding. Her sound judgement, imagination and sesponsiveness to
guidance not only contributod to muintaining the stability and momentum
of the Station but also made possible an early effozt to come to grips
with many of the problems which an inflated Registry and a highly dis-
tinctive record; system created for the new Station management tean.
During the.ensuing six month period, Subject has recommended and
implemented a nunber of changes which have prodiced a more offective
and less costly records system. Papor holdings have been redaced 3ub- |
stantially, input has beon vedaced and sow conforms to basic CS pro-
cedures and requiremonts. Personnel savings have been effected and
supervisory responsibilities more clearly delincated.
To sun up, Subject has made and continues to ‘make a major contribu-
tion In a singularly unsonsational area of Station activity. Her aivic

Subject's performance continued during the period under review
to deserve high praise. Her enormous appetite for work, her
attention to detail, her ability to absorb and digest enormous files.

entrusted to her really deserve the rating of outstanding. Subject
speaks good Spanish, has considerable initiative, much experience
in analytic work and a genuine talent for administrative work.

In wiew of her past performance, her record at the Station and
her potential, Subject who was recommended for promotion to the GS-ly
level, should be promoted as soon as possible. .

NARRATIVE COMMENTS -~

Subject's performance during the period of over one year under
review continued to deserve the rating of Outstanding. lier major
contributions during that period were in the fieldS of operational
research and exploitation of information obtained through technical
means. She was, during this period, given full responsibility for
the handling of two full time senior transcribers including adminis-
trative matters. In view of the difficulty of recruiting target
personnel the task of fully exploiting information obtained from
technical sources is of great importance. Subject handled this task
with her usual enormous capability for work, displaying initiative
and great professionalism. She continued, in addition, to handle the
other tasks listed in this report together with sensative reporting
sent by a’ separate channel, altogether a much heavier workload than
is usually carried by one person. She was helped in this by her
good knowledge of Spanish, a talent for administrative work, con=
siderable analytic experience and great devotion to her work.
Subject should be considered for promotion to the grade of GS~14 at

the first opportune momont,

This officer is the person chicfly responsidle for the Mexico Desk‘s
deserved reputation for excellence and efficiency. The complicated and
never-ending tasks of project proccasing, clearances, tracing, and coordination
are handled by her with blinding speed and unerring perfection. Procedural
problems ore there to be solved, and the solutions come vith amzing rapidity.
Operational probleas are worked out thoroughly and conscientiously. Tio
corners are cut and no principles are compromised.

Never at a loss for an ansver, this officer never shrinks from any
assignnent and instinctively wants to take over any vexing problem which 1s
holding up progress. She is complete mistress of file ond record resources
end answers all queries within minutes. The most complex budgetary and
planning projects are handled by her with deceptive ease.

These qualities of. rare efficiency and speed are coupled with an even
rarer degree of amiability and cooperativeness. ‘The vork which proceeds
under her at such a break-neck pace nonetheless goes on in an air of placidity
and good humor. The large office staff is run without a trace of tension,
Jealousy, or friction. All of this is traceable to this officer's fine
example and catalytic effect on her colleagues.

Finely-educated, handling the Spanish language vith fluency, and keeping
up with current events in her area, this officer is a unique asset to
