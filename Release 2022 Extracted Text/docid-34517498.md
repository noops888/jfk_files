1. Clemard Joseph Charles vas rearrested at 1600 hours 11 May 68.
His present whereabouts ere not known to me.

2. It became clear, during the period between 3 May 68 and 16 May 68
that Charles would not be able to raise the ransom sum of US$605
thousand. His release from prison, vhich took place on 25 Apr 68,
vas apparently contingent on his sbility to produce that eum.

Towing his release, Charles at Oo érest foreign

- Charles holds a receipt from the Banque Natiomnle de la Repb-

ligque Q'BHaitt (BNRH) in the emount of US$300 thousand dated
1966, and claima from the BRA another personal credit of
US$100 thousand, dated 1965. He does not, hovever, hold copy
of any receipt for the latter sum. Charles apparently camot
utilize these sums, or his credit for them, to pay off the
us$605 thousand ransom.

4. Charles’ current visible cach assets consist of US$100

First National City Bank, both of Hew York City. He originally  ~
had US$110 thousand in these two banks. When he was first

imprisoned in 1967, the Haitian authorities (no additional date
available) compelled him to sign a mmber of blank checks of

Haitian authorities then sbandoned their attempts to lay their
hands on the rest of the money.

It 48 possible that President Duvalier might settle with Charles
for the US$100 thousand on deposit in New York, when, as and

may therefore have utilized the opportunity to deposit sone of
his own money outside of Haiti.

If Charles did in fect deposit mmey of his am in Svitzerland
or eome other locality outside of Haiti, President Duvalier my
