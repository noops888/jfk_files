MEHORANDUM

Mand, ISay 8, 196l.

A situation of unrest and dissatisfaction which appeared within the IC

before the invasion has apparently come to a head.

It originated when four rembers of the six Executives of the F.R.D. united

under the Generational Tesis. This provoked a crisis within the FRD and all

of it's components organizations.

It appeared at the time that Rasco would be substituted by the Executive

Committee within Cuba. The Islami Committee of the MDC backed Rasco. This s1-

tuation was solved at the time by a trip here to Miend, taken by lucas, the

Coordinator of the MIC In Cuba, and at the sane time, General Coordinator of

the FRD.

in a personal conversation with lucas, he inforned ne that they were not

satisfied with Rasco, but that he agreed that 1t was not the time for a subs-

tituilon within the MDC with detriment to this organization, the FRD and the

general Revolutionary effort. At this time lucas mentioned Fermin Poinado and

Malchor Gaston as possiblo substitutes.

The son Inclusion of an MC nember in the Revolutionary Council, produced

a further discontent within this organization, not withstanding the Inference

of tir√≥ Cardons of amplifying the Council within Cube, which Implied that lucas,

the DC Coordinator, would be a nember of the Council.

in the last feu days several maneuvers have taken place within the DC and

although at first 1t annanred thet Malchor Gaetea sould cubstituto Faavo,

coy mens that Fermin Peinado has the majority of the rotos, within the Execi-

tive of the DC. An Ireoutive meeting of the MC 1a soheduled for today at

I'ire and a General Assembly to-nito at 8 o'clock and e decision should be pro-

duord In the General Assembly.

It should be noted that this in leing done in the flanl Executive that

had previously backed Rasco, vith the apparent consent of the Hoverent within

Cuba.

The Jesult Society, which originally created the 1DC In Cuba, has not

Interfered In this development, but apparently prefera Melchor Gaston to

Permin Peinado.

Rasco has been critized within his organization for appearing in the

neuspapers with a "beard".
