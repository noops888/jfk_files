Miami jay 68,1961,

A situation of unrest and diseatisfaction vhich appeared vithin the 106
before the invasion has apparently cone to a head.

It originated when four members of the six Executives of the F.R.D. united
water the Generational T-esie, This provoked a ertets within the FRD and all
of it's components organizations.

Tt appeared at the tine that Raseo would be substituted by the Executive

: Committee within Cuba. The Mlami Committee of the MDC backed Rasco. This si~

tuation vas so}ved at the tine by a trip here to Mami, teken by Incas, the
Goordinator of the MDC in Cuba, and at the same time, General Coordinator of
the FRD.

In a personal conversation with Lucas, he informed me that they vere not.
satisfied with Rasco, but that he agreed that it was not the time for « subs-
tituiion within the MDC with detriment to this organization, the FRD and the

general Revolutionary effort, At thie time Lucas mentioned Fermin Peinado and
Melchor Gaston es possible: substitutes.

The non inclusion of an MDC manber in the Revolutionary Council, produced
@ further discontent within this organization, not withstanding the inference
of Hiré Cardona of amplifying the Council within Cuba, which implied that Lucas,
the MDC Coordinator, would be a member of the Council.

in the last few days several maneuvers have taken place within the HDC and
although at first 1t annesred thet Melcher Gaston-vould tubstituts Rasooy s+
now weems that Fermin Peinado has the majority of the voter, within the Execu-—
tive of the MOC, An Executive meeting of the MDC 1s scheduled for today at
five and a Generel Asserbly to-nite at 8 o'clock ant # decision. should be pro-
Guosd in the Genoral Assenbly,

Tb should be noted that this is being done in the Mami Executive that

had previously backed Rasco, with the apparent consent of the Movenent within
Cuba,

‘The Jesuit Society, which originally created the MDC in Cuba, has not

t
{ t
| interfered in this development, but apperently prefers Melchor Gaston to H cated
Fermin Feinado,

Rasco has been critized within his organization for appearing in the di :
newspapers with a "beard".
