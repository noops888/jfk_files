Talking Points for Files Briefing
for 12 February 1997

Per list submitted by Jeremy Gunn and pursuant to discussion on 5 February 1997 between Gunn
the following topics are requested for coverage in the “records briefing

juled for 12 February 1997. More specifics were identified than covered in the Memorandum
for the Record dated 8 January 1997 by Harrelson(Wukitch: Itis NOT meant that the detail of the
question is the detail of the briefing expected, that is, the questions are for the purpose of
identifying the types of files that may exist versus the expectation of a complete answer NOW.

The topics are not to be considered to be in any order of importance. Primarily the time frame of
concern is 1958-63. In some cases, it may mean proving evidence of “no records.”

Gunn further queried whether notes could be taken.
