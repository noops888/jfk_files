4, “hen questioned about the identitios of followers
of hajor GAUETAS, A/l stated that it would be hotter to
refer to H, as he (A/1) could only give information that
was three yeara old and hence not very accurate. We did not
press the question, nor suggest names, ag it was evident
that he felt that his answers would simply not give a true,
current picture. 7

6. In addition to the above information, tl
undersigned discussed various aspects of the AMLASIL .
and in partioular, questioned A/) about AMLASH's frane of
mind and future plana which he may have revealed to A/l .
after Ontrich departed the scene. A/) wade several. points,
which basically boiled down to the fact that AMLASH was
still not pleased with the support he was getting from the
USG side, The visit with DAINOLD, who acted in the capacity
of a representative of high levels of the Govt concerned
with the Cuban problem, satisfied AMLASH as far as poltoyy
was concerned , but he was not af all happy with the fact
that he still was not given the technical assistance for
the operational plan as he saw it, A/1l said that AMLASH
dwelt constantly on this point. He could not understand
why he denied certain small pieces of equipment which
promis 4 final solution to the problem, while, on the
other hand, the USG gave much equipment and money to exile
groups for their inoffective excursions against Cuban
coastal targets, According to A/1, AMLASH feols strongly
on this poiut, and {if he does not get advice and materials

frow USG technician, he will probably become fed-up again,
and we will lose whatever progress we have made to date.
A/\ stated that AMLASN now has hia feet wet vis-a-vis
cooperating with USG and has accepted the fact that he will
work profitably and securely with it. It is thie that we
stand to lose with our procrastination. AMLASH also —
talked about going to- the French terrorist group, the QAS,
in order to get the ratertals and guidance he needs. It
is bolieved. that he was talked out of this idea, after the

dangers involved were discussed with AMLASII.

7. With regara to the radio gear, AMLASII stated
that he did not feel that he wanted to take one in with
hin, particularly in view of the recent arrests in Cuba
of agents carrying concealed radios. fe was not opposed,
however, at this timc to havingza radio cached for hia,
to be recovered by him later,

8. According to AMMHIP, 1f there is any interest
in having AMLASI link up with other trusted assets in
Cuba, these naues would have to bo Given to him beyore he
returned; otherwise he would not trust any other means
pei later inside to get hiv to initiate or respond to such
contacts, 5

,
9. A/l stated that AMASH talked about getting
aid frou, or at 1 t discussing his position, with
Maaolo RAY. i er, ho stated that he questioned whether
this was the b idea, since if RAY came to Paris while
he (LASH) was t! » people would. conclude. that there was-
sowething botwoen the two, Another apot wouid be better,
thought AMLASK.

10. At the time of A/l's departure, AMLASH
said that he would contact "Jack" (Red Stent, Paris
staffer) upon his return to Paris. (This he subsequently
did on the 15th of November, according to info received
from Paris-somewhat belatedly).

»

11. When AMLASH, A/1, and VENEGAS were together
in Rowe and Italy, VENEGAS told AMLASH that people were

betting that LASII would not return to Cuba, Sone had also
questioned his mother on this point. AMLASH reportedly
told VENEGAS to cover all the hets he could as he would
be a rich man. (It was at this time, according to A/1,
that AMLASH ceoided that he had better return to Havana

12, AMLASK talked about the two possibilities
of re-taking Cuba -~ eithor thru invasion by US troops, or
bis way. He also realized, however, that t{nvaston was
hot to be considered sertously at this tine. “ Also, AMLASII
talked about his ability to take sone men into the hills
of Las Villas Province and taking the small toms of
Trinidad and Topes de Collantes. Ie sata that he and hig
men could last no more than 15 days in the hills as the
anti-guerrilla fighters now employed by the Regime were

and thereby invite and gain US support, By the way A/1
talked, 1t 16 fairly certain that AMLASH realized that

thie was not the kind of a Plan which could even remotely
be expected to receive USG aid. It ts hoped that he

does realize that Jlavana must first be taken... or failing
that, a trucly stable piece af id (say, almost an '
entire province) which could be rue rallying point and —
staging ground mnder complece Rebel control, from which fH
the rest of the island could be wrested from the Fidelistas
and the Communists,

13. In summary, the talks with A/1 led the
ig) to believe that AMLASIt is again entering
one of his skeptical woods, one which our actions have
done little to G@ispel. Too little and too late.......
