The visit with DAINOLD, who acted in the capaolty

of a representative of high levels of the Gout concerned

with the Cuban probles, satlafled AMLASH as far as pOlloyy

Of re-Eaking

He also realizod, however, that Invaston ras

not to bo considered serioualy at chla tiuo.

Also the Soviet equipment mado the govt

apparently was discussing these idoas with the impression

that this was the way to sot up a provislonal rebel gout

and thereby Invite and gain US support.

salked, It 1s fairly cortain that AMASH realized that

this was not the kind of a plan which could oven remotely

be expected to receive US ald. It is hoped that he
