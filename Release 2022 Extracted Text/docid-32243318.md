Assassination Records Review Board
Final Determination Notification

AGENCY : HSCA
RECORD NUMBER : 180-10068-10352
RECORD SERIES : STAFF PAYROLL RECORDS
AGENCY FILE NUMBER :

December 8, 1995
Status of Document: Postponed in Part

Number of releases of previously postponed information: 13

Reason for Board Action: The Review Board's decision was premised on several factors
including: (a) the significant historical interest in the document in question; (b) the
absence of evidence that the release of the information would cause harm to the United
States or to any individual.

Number of Postponements: 7

Postponements: All the postponements in this document represent Social Security numbers.

Reason for Board Action: The text is redacted because the public disclosure of the redaction could
reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, and that invasion of
privacy would be so substantial that it outweighs the public interest.

Substitute Language: SSN

Date of Next Review: 2017

Dear Mr. Sprague:

When we talked the other week, you asked that I write
to you to state formally my interest in working on the
staff of the House Select Committee on Assassinations,
and to tell you when I would be ready to go to work.

| As I told you during the interview, I am extremely
interested in working as a member of the committee's
staff. I look forward with enthusiasm to such an
opportunity.

I spoke with Judge Higginbotham last week, and it appears

| that my duties in connection with my appointment as a
special master will be essentially over within the next

two weeks. I have also inquired about living arrangements
in Washington, D.C. While nothing is definite yet, I

am confident that I can find a room in one of the Jesuit
communities there--most probably at Georgetown University—-
within the next two weeks as well. As a result, I can
assure you that I will be ready to go to work in
Washington, D.C., on Monday, December 13, 1976.

One last item--in accordance with your suggestion, I
have been doing some background reading on the scope of
the investigatory powers of Congressional committees.

Thanks again for taking time out of your busy schedule
to see me. With every best wish, I am

Sincerely yours,
=
[ome Ban 64.
