1. Reference is made

Cunningham of your Staff.. Mr. Cunningham stated that an

inquiry had been made by the FEI relative to subjects' con-

tinued availability to official U.s. agencies for purposes

of giving testimony on Conmunist Party activities within the

jurisdiction of such agencies.

?. As you know,:

subject has signed a contract with this

Division for a two year tour of duty in the field.

It is not

the desire of the Western Hemisphere Division to recommend the

complete withdrawal of his services from other official interests,

although it is of course preferable that such instances be held

to an absolute minimum. He do recommend however, that the FBI

be officially advised that future requests for subject's neces-

sary services or testimony be made only through CIA channels,

and that this Division be requested to make him available for

such purposes.

It is felt that subject's cover is sufficient

to withstand the scrutiny which could reasonably be expected to

result from sublicity incident to such activities.
