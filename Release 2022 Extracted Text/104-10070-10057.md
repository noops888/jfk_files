MEXORANDUM TOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Brieging of Victor D. BALSAMELLO (P) Regurd+
ing Project ALMWIDE

1. ‘On 8 October occompanied by George Powell, Central
Cover Staff, Covert Tax Unit, we met with Victor D. BALSAU-
ELLO (P) at the Holiday Inn in Rosslyn for the purpose of
briefing him regarding his tax and cover status. Upon arri~
val we discovered he was just’ being shown his contract by the
ease officer and\a representative of WH Personnel.. After o
cursory review of his contract, :BALSANELLO (P) siated that be
refused to. commit: himself. for:a period of. more thanone year
fiinasmuch og this was o .losing proposition for him financially.
After a brief discussion, it was. agreed thot the contract
could be amended to cover a period of thirteen months under
which he et4ll maanteine the sane benefits which were set
forth dn the original sgreenent. He then voiced objections to
the use of his sssigned pseudonym and gave the general impres-
sion or relunctance to. becone associated under any terms of
agreement.

2. He advised that he had been invited to Florida in
August and hed a resulting medical problem consisting of
fungus which developed on this trip. He stated that at noon
on 9 October, he was to receive the resulta of tests run by
two independent doctors whem be hod consulted and therefore
was in no position to morally commit hinself to this contract
under any terms. Fortunately Powell and I were introduced in
alias and at this point. we departed from the meeting.

3. We later learned that the subject had been given the
true name of the AXMHM proprietary curing the above-mentioncd
visit in Florida. AMuUyDE -

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD ‘

SUBJECT: Meeting with John Thomas Duncan: Project AMWIDE Candidate
(1145 - 1515 hours, 8 October 1968; Reaslyn, Virginia) :

O35
1, Gonald Winters and I met briefly with "Tom" Duncan in the lobby

of the Holiday Inn, Rosslyn, Virginia, after which Duncan and I bad lunch

at the Orleans House. The purpose of the meeting was to discuss any prob-

lem areas or questions which Duncan may have had incident to his coming
! - “on board," Further, I was to remain with Duncan until such time as he would
i be intreduced to(goka Mertin that efternoon, (NOTE: The latter ecsrica was
arranged for the purpase of having Duncan sign the contract which had been
prepared for him, and to explain his cover arrongement and other pertinent
administrative details. )

: 3

| 2, During the earller discussion, Gantere) Duncan and I chatted for
i nearly thirty minutes; though Duncan mentioned (4) the skin fungus which ho

: had contracted during en earMer visit to Florida; and (2) kis desire to confer
i by telerhone with his
Duncan cid net give e zt
which he had been selected,”
cused himcolf at about 1230 hours on 13 Duncan that he heped they might
have en opportunity to cot together prior te Duncan's departure.

3. Subsequently, Duncan and I lunched together, during which time the 2 i
H conversation turned to Duncan's récent travels and his several visits to univer- Sue
| “sity campuses while enroute to Washington. He mentioned that he had found § te
the doctoral program at the University of Minnesota particularly attractive, =*
He did not say that he intended to enroll at that institution, but he severaltimes § ©1/
 S..) alluded to "picling up the doctorate" at some future date. With reference to =
hoo the aforementioned AMWEDE position, Duncan stated that he could not do aay- es
{ &

thing -- (While in the Agency's employ) -- which might run counter to his

“principles"tor set of values. 1 assured him that it was extremely unlikely

that he would expertence any difficulty in that regard, and I recalled at that
time how casual he ecemed throughout our brief discussicn of his forthcoming
affiliation with the Agency. If retrospect, it ceems quite clear that Duncan

was net really interested in being reassured; his decicion to refuco the Agency's
offer of employment hed Mkely been reached days before.

9;
3

4, During the course of the afternoon mecting with Gsartip, and later
with George Powel} and Richard Biladeau, it was my imprescion that neither
the terma of the contract nor the ascizmment of a pseudonym was of para-
mount concern, Rather, Duncan's expressed misgivings were only suporficlal
excuses for backing out of a relationship which he bad come to view as untenable,
Doubtless, his ekin condition was a factor, however, had Duncan been sufficicatly
enthusiastic about joining the AMWIDE project, it is my feeling that he would
have done so despite his malsay, (NOTE: The doctors reportedly told Duncan
that many people Living in Flozida had the same preblem, and that Duncan "could
live with it. "')

5. In sum, it is my opinion that Duncan was unwilling to accept the job
regardless of the terms which hs might be able to exact, e.g., thiztcoa months
28 opposed to two-ycars, etc, It is conceivable that had it net for Duncen’s
desire to visit relatives in the Washington, D.C., area, he may not have pree
sented himeclf at all, Why Dencan agreed to meet with Gtartin) Powell and
Biledcou remains something of a mystery tome, He tay have felt come obligntion
to (Wintera)=> for whem he expressed high regard, or he may have dono co elz
out of curiogity.

6. Security Implications: Known to Duncan are the true name and address
of AMWIDE's production faciity, and the true name of Cedric D. BARTILUCCI.
Though it is not belicved thet Duncan will cause this information to become
known, Station JMCOBRA has been alerted to the possibility. ,

By memo datod Novembor 1967, VOMACE requested LNERGO
to procure a liot of toll callo made from the office of Panther
Publications in Boulder, Colorado, and a similar list of toll
calla made from tho home of Robert K, Brown, This requect
was made as a reoult of Brown's harrassment of JKLANCE

OPERATIONS CONTACT REPORT

SUBJECT: Mecting with IDEN and Wife

DATE AND PLACE: 23 July 1068, 1000 - 2000 Hours, Albuquerque,
New Mexico .

1. Clyde B. MEGENNITY first met IDEN alone during the morning
of 23 July; the meeting was held tn MEGENNITY's bstel room, MEGENNITY
introduced himeclf es a representative of LNHARP, indicating te IDEN that
he was involved in worl of a confidential nature for LNEARP. IDEN was
then given the brozd outline af the AMWIDE job. This included location in
the JMOOERA erca, workesa producer/cerint writer, pessible travel
throsghout the Caribbean, anda general calary bracket around $10, 000.
IDEN was also teld that LNEARP would pay his trancportetion and moving
costa to the JMCOBRA area.

that ho had elready intended to submit (on 2 August)
oa notice from hia currest fod at tho University of
dia, He indiested that he end bia wife planned to go
crimately six m dag and travelling.

f 98 and operations in
cates come regret vor the pessibility of having to
cancel thesa plans, however acknowledged the career job opportunities
that the AMWIDE cHer would afford him.

3. In answering additional questions about the job itself, IDEN was
told thet he would be. working ostensibly for a commercial company en-
gaged in the preparation of program) materials for the Latin American
audience. IDEN was advised that these programs would be of social/
economic nature, designed to be progreesive and reformist in tone,
IDEN seemed most interested in the concept and, according to several
remarks he made throughout the day, the nature of the broadcasts fits
in quite well with his own political thinking concerning the Latin America
area. :

4. At noon time MEGENNITY met LDEN's wife. She is an intelli-
gent and vivactavs person who obviously would be very much interested
in, and involved in, anything her bueband would be doing. She was given
more or less the same cover run down concerning the AMWIDE job. She
expressad great interest and asked if there was any role she could do in
this venture.

5. During the afternoon IDEN and hts wife drove MEGENNITY
throughout the Albuquerque and Santa Fe area showing him several sights,
but also discuseing the overall job considerations and ramificattons.

6. IDEN indicated to MEGENNITY that his Spanish was adequate for
handling virtually all situations. “He feels completely at ease verbally
with the language and indicated he could conduct Spanish interviews and
peraonal reporting jobs for AMWIDE.. It did not seem appropriate to test
iis Spanish capabibty. is wife haa little or no Spanish. Neither IDEN
nor bia wife bas travelled or lived in the eastern United States. The idea
ef going to the JMCOBRA area obvicusly ts new to them and they approach-
ed ft with come reeervations. MEGENNITY indicated that tf a chort visit
to ths JMCOBRA area ht catiety their curiosity, and aceict them in
making a decision cenc g the ceceptance of the AMWIDE job, that
such a visit could probably be arranged.

7. itis MEGENNITY's opinion that both these individuals are
highly eutted for the AMWEDE job. They are curious intellectually, have
a@ very pre: cutlesss an polttical matters, are mest enthuctastic
about things which interest them, and scem lite a fine team asset to have
at tho AMWIDE Facility. MEGENNITY feels, wherever possible, we
ehould make inducements to insure that IDEN and his wife decide fevorably
in acceptance of the AMWIDE job. MEGUNIGTY urged them to call him at ©
any time they had questions and couaiderations and, above all, not to make os
any final decieion (particularly negative) without discussing it with MEGE- 2
NNITY. (what MECENNITY bad fn wind here, was the flextbility to suggest 2; a
that they might go to Europe for «.s long as three. months and then return &
to start at the AMWIDE job around 1 December).

without roots - either family or professionally -.and who are alseady
giving up their current jobs, indicates that the problem of recruiting
