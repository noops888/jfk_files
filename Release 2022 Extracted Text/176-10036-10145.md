1. SUMMARY. TRAN KIM TUYEN, EXILED WITHOUT HIS FAMILY TO A CONSULATE

POST IN CAIRO, CLAIMED ON 17 SEPTEMBER 1963 THAT IF THE DIEM REGIME IN SOUTH
VIETNAM CONTINUED FOR SIX MORE MONTHS, “ALL WOULD BE LOST; THEN NOT-EVEN A COUP
D'ETAT COULD SAVE VIETNAM. IF A NEW REGIME.IS INSTALLED FAIRLY SOON, HOWEVER,

IT MIGHT HAVE A: FIGHTING CHANCE, BUT WITH NGO DINH NHU'S SKILLFUL DIVIDE AND
CONQUER TACTICS FRAGMENTING THE OPPOSITION, IT Is UNLIKELY. TUYEN CLAIMED THAT

NEU IS NOW TRYING TO DELUDE AMERICAN AMBASSADOR HENRY CABOT LODGE, JR., INTO
BELIEVING THAT THE REGIME PLANS REAL REFORMS AND THAT ITS FAULTS HAVE BEEN
EXAGGERATED BY I'TS ENEMIES AMONG THE AMERICAN OFFICIALS IN SAIGON. TUYEN'S FRIENDS,

LEAD TO RETALIATION SY LOYALISTS AGAINST AMERICANS AND TO HOPELESS
CIVIL WAR,

2. UP TO THE TIME OF DR TUYEN'S HURRIED DEPARTURE ON 12 SEPTEMBER,
THE GOVERNMENT OF VIETNAM .(GVN) WAS TRYING TO RESTORE APPEARANCES OF
NORMALCY AND TO PORTRAY ITSELF AS LABORING UNDER DIFFICULTY OF
COMMUNIST PLOTS AMONG STUDENTS AND BUDDHISTS, UNDER NGO TRONG HIEU,":
KNOWN NOW AMONG THE. SAIGON POPULACE AS "THE POPE OF THE FALSE

°BONZES", THE GVN HAS PLACED DOCILE BUDDHIST PRIESTS AND MONKS IN =
ALL. PAGODAS. HIS TALK OF RELEASING ARRESTED STUDENTS AND LIFTING MARTTAL
LAW HOWEVER IMPRESSED MANY WESTERNERS. THE LIFTING OF MARTIAL LAW

© 1S PURELY NOMINAL; MANY OF THE ALLEGEDLY. "COMMUNIST STUDENT PLOTTERS"
MANHANDLED AND ARRESTED WERE YOUNGER BROTHERS AND SONS OF PROMINENT
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS..AND MILITARY OFFICERS; GVN REPRESSION AND
BRUTALITY HAS ACTUALLY DRIVEN MANY EMBITTERED STUDENTS WHO WERE

NOT COMMUNISTS TO FLEE TO THE COUNTRYSIDE,,TO SEEK THE COMMUNISTS
AS THE LESSER OF TWO-EVILS; MOST BUDDHISTS, REPUDIATE THE GVN'S

BONZES, AND ATTENDANCE AT PAGODAS HAS DWINDLED. WITH THE CLOSING

“AND ANTI =REGIME SUBVERS | VE USES OF ‘THE BUDDHISTS AND. STUDENTS.

NHU'S. CHARGES OF AMERICAN PLOTTING WERE SET WITH DERISION BY VIETNAMESE
_ BUT AMERICANS HAVE LOST MUCH FACE WITH MANY SINCERE NATIONALISTS
BECAUSE THEY TAKE THESE, ACCUSATIONS AND YET “ARE NoT GUILTY. OF BLAME
WHEN MANY VIETNAMESE WISH THEY WERE,

AL THE VIETNAMESE ARMY HAS SUFFERED MOST FROM THE CURRENT
STALEMATE, BOTH IN MORALE AND IN REPUTATION, THE GENERALS WHO

ARMY LEADERS ANY MORE. THE VOA ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THE. ARMY WAS NOT

RESPONSIBLE FOR ORDERING THE 21 AUGUST ATTACKS ON THE PAGODAS TEMPORARILY
SAVED THE ARMY'S REPUTATION BUT GENERAL DINH'S IMMEDIATE DENIAL SQUELCHED
THIS, FORTUNATELY FOR NHU, DUONG VAN MINH HOWEVER DISCONTENT STILL
ABIDES BY ‘HIS OFFICER'S OATH: OF LOYALTY .AND- SHUNS POLITICS. HE

DOES SO NOT OUT OF ‘STUPIDITY, AS NHU. OFTEN CHARGED IN DENIGRAT ING HIM,

(FIELD COMMENT. TUYEN RECALLED. BITTERLY HIS OWN PAST. SUPPORT OF NHU
IN PUBLICIZING THIS PICTURE OF MINH. ) NGUYEN KHANH, THE MAN

WHOM TUYEN CONSIDERS NEXT TO HIMSELF AS MOST ABLE ‘TO PLAN A SUCCESSFUL
COUP, IS HAMPERED AS IS TUYEN BY, DISTRUST AS A PROVOCATEUR ARISING ~
CHIEFLY FROM VIGOROUS SUPPORT BOTH GAVE THE REGIME IN 1968. NHU'S
AGENTS HAVE FURTHERED THIS IMAGE OF KHANH AND TUYEN AMONG OTHER
SUSPECT MALCONTENTS TO - PRESENT eal COAL LT10N AGA INST THE REGIME,

/5. THE REGIME HAS THE ABILITY ‘To KEEP THE ARMY IN LINE BY
THREATS OF COMMUNIST ADVANTAGE BY CONSTANT SURVEILLANCE OF SUSPECT
ELEMENTS AND LIMITATION OF THEIR COMMAND AUTHORITY AND. BY
RUINING .THE REPUTATION OF HIS ENEMEIES AND OF WELL=MEANING
COMPROM! SERS. LIKE DON, THERE 1s NEVERTHELESS: A STRONG CURRENT -UNDER

THE SURFACE IN THE ARMED SERVICES, CIVILTAN BUREAUCRACY, POLICE,
AND PROFESSIONAL CLASSES, PEOPLE LESS: KNOWN THAN THE TOP FIGURES
SUSPECTED BY THE GVN'S SPIES UNDER LE QUANG TUNG AND DUONG VAN HIEU,
THESE PERSONS ‘HOPE FOR A COUP WITHIN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS AS VIETNAM'S
ONLY SALVATION. NOT ALL OF THEM ARE WILLING TO RISK IT, THOUGH

THEY WOULD WELCOME IT; THE BIG PROBLEM IS UNITY AND TRUST OF EACH
OTHER IN AN ATMOSPHERE ABOUND ING WITH PROVOCATEURS AND RUMOR MONGERS.
IF |THE STALEMATE CONTINUES ANOTHER SLX MONTHS, THE REGIME WILL LAST

AS LONG AS VIETNAM DOES, BUT THAT with NOT BE LONG SINCE NO ONE WILL
HAVE THE WILL TO FIGHT, IF A WELL=PLANNED COUP COMES SOON, IT

MIGHT SUCCEED AND UNDER TREMENDOUS HANDICAPS COULD STILL SAVE VIETNAM.”

ITS SURVIVAL POTENTIAL DECREASES AS TIME GOES BY, . NHU KNOWS ‘THAT
HIS MAIN STRENGTH IS THE RELUCTANCE OF HIS PATRIOTIC OPPONENTS
“AND OF THE AMERICANS “TO GIVE THE VC A SUDDEN ADVANTAGE BY PRECIPITIOUS™ -
ACTION AGAINST THE REGIME WHICH MIGHT. EVOLVE INTO A PROTRACTED
CONFLICT, HE IS SKILFULLY PLAYING AGAINST THAT AND TURNING
ONE ENEMY AGAINST ANOTHER, ao
6. THIS POLICY MAY. FRUSTRATE A COUP, THERE IS A GROWING NUMBER
OF JUNIOR OFFICERS, ESPECIALLY MAJORS AND CAPTAINS, WHO WILL NOT COUNT
THE COST OF DESPERATE ACTION IF THEIR SUPERIORS DO NOT MOVE.
EVEN THEY MAY TURN AWAY FROM THE INCREASING HIGH RISKS.OF A COUP '
> TO THE RELATIVELY SIMPLE DESPERATION MOVE. OF ASSASSINATION, - NHU HAS
ALREADY MADE IT CLEAR THROUGH THE SA!GON UNDERGROUND WHERE
PROVOCATEURS AND PLOTTERS MEET THAT THE REGIME 1S PREPARED TO RETALIATE™
WITH COUNTER ASSASSINATIONS OF NUMEROUS PERSONNEL ALREADY
EARMARKED ie ‘COLONEL TUNG FOR SUCH A DIRE EVENTUALITY, INCLUDING
AMERICANS, “ON WHOM ANY ASSASSINATION PLOT WILL’ BE BLAMED, THE
ONLY FURTHER RESULT WOULD BE_A HOPELESS THREE-CORNERED CIVIL WAR.
