Re: Autobiography of Mr. E. Howard Hunt, Jr.

Dear Mr. Morrison:

I'm writing at your request to confirm our several telephone

calls of yesterday.

Following discussions on Saturday, September 28, I went to

New York yesterday to inform Mr. Edward Chase, Vice President of

G. P. Putnam's Sons, Mr. Hunt's publisher, of the several changes

which you had requested and to which Mr. Hunt had agreed. As you

know, the publisher was quite unhappy about making these changes:

For one thing, he feels that certain matters of principle litigated in the

first Marchetti case should be reopened in the courts. For this reason,

I chose to place my primary emphasis in talking to the publisher on the

fact that Howard had agreed to these changes for reasons such as

decency and patriotism which seemed good to him, rather than that

the Agency had requested or demanded them. I'm happy to report that

following long discussion this approach met with success.

The following four changes required by you under the first

Marchetti decision have been made:

Page 73-74 (78): The phrase 'a Chinese newspaper" has been

substituted for "the English language(Shanghai Post). Thereafter, where

the name of the Shanghai Post appears, the words "local paper" have been

substituted. Also, the phrase "agent-journalists" has been changed to

"friendly journalists".

On pages 80-81 (87-88): The phrase "one Communist embassy"

has been substituted for 'the Guatemalan embassy. Corresponding

changes have been made thereafter, such as the substitution of "the

Communists" for "the Guatemalans".

On page 115 (125): The phrase "clandestine facilities" has been

substituted for "clandestine listening posts". Further along, the phrase

"what we could do in our coyerage of local targets" has been substituted

for "that we were monitoring 42 telephone lineg".

The above represent all of the changes which you absolutely

required under the Marchetti decision. There were also a few other

changes which you suggested and to which Howard agreed, and which

have now been changed in the book:

On page 57(60): The words "other members" have been

substituted for "Henry Pleasants.

substituted for page a Hole one phrase "an OPC chief" has been

On page 220 (239): The words "once was" have been

substituted for "had been" with reference to the alias documentation

which the C. I. A. had provided. Incidentally, we decided at the

publisher's strong urging, to leave the phrase "alias documentation"

intact, rather than changing it to "old documentation".

Mr. Hunt's manuscript is now in what is called the blue-copy

phase, which apparently is the penultimate step prior to publication.

The pagination of the blue copy is slightly different from that of the

bound galleys, because of the insertion of photographs and footnotes

in their proper place. The blue-copy page numbers appear in paren-

thesis above.

Although I came away from my meeting with the publisher

feeling satisfied, you understand that I cannot vouch for the fact that the

changes which they promised to make will in fact be made in the final

version of the book. However, Mr. Chase's demeanor, and the air of

urgency which he conveyed, lead me to believe that the changes

mentioned above to which the publisher has acquiesced will in fact be

made.

I want to take this opportunity to thank you for the

reasonable and fair-minded attitude which you and your colleague have

brought to this task, which I am

sure is an unwelcome one for you.

Sincerely yours,

Nation: 1?
