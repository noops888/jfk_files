WES POLKESLED 3D Pik MEEK IGA (Corie

Statement of Raymond H. Rosing regarding audit of Sidney Morris
@ Peck based on telephone interview 8/13/75.
tee (eed Made nesaaacestasent

In the summer of 1968 I was the Assistant Chief of the Audit Division
in the Cleveland District. Irecall some of the circumstances
surrounding the audit of Sidney Morris Peck, though I would like

to review the audit file (which has not yet been received from the
Federal Records Center) before giving any formal testimony on the

subject if any should be necessary.

My best recollection is.that the return was of a type which would
iv ss : ‘@
sbentiyfrt by The Cerprtn 29 baw hit pA Ord +
not normally be_setected-termerdit. The information’on the return

phew Thy
was-not of the kind which the computer would normally seleet for

@ audit under the IRS DIF scoring method. There was no routine
are

ete
procedure in effect at that time for“manual screening of returns
for questionable deductions. Therefore, without some impetus
from outside the normal, routine system, Mr. Feck's return

faarfretdivn on Quoandll
would in all probability not have been selected for review.

My best recollection is that at the time of the demonstrations

by the SDS in Chicago in 1968, or shortly thereafter, we received

in Cleveland a transmission from the National Office with regard
to pulling Mr. Peck's tax return. My impression (though Iam
by no means certain) is that Mr. Peck was one of a number of

8 people on a National Office list of persons associated with the SDS,

HW 50955 DocId:32423538 Page 16


AW 50955

Hore

and that the transmission was the impetus for our pulling Mr.
Peck's return for review. Ido not now recall whether there
were other names of other persons associated with SDS on the
transmission to the Cleveland District or whether Mr. Peck

was the only one.

Ihave been advised that Inspector Samuel Gardner has indicated
he orally transmitted to the Audit Department some information
regarding improper deductions by Mr. Peck which he obtained
from the FBI. Ihave no recollection of this event, though it
could very easily have occurred as Inspection frequently :
supplies information to Audit.

Upon manual review of Mr. Peck's tax return, it was noticed
that there were a number of deductions which were not self-
explanatory and which required audit, so an audit was conducted.

Thave no recollection that there was any special urgency about

the audit, or that Mr. Peck was treated differently from any
other taxpayer. In fact, I was quite certain the audit was conducted

in an entirely routine manner.

@ 15 August 1975

Mr. Frederick A. O. Schwartz, Jr.

General Counsel

United States Senate

Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations
with Respect to Intelligence Activities
Washington, D.C. 20510

Dear Mr. Schwartz:

As requested in your letter of 6 August 1975, and passed by
telephone to Mr. Gregory Treverton this date, the following
replies are provided:

1. During the period September 15 to November 3, 1970, I was
serving as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
Were you aware at this time that President Nixon had
requested the CIA to conduct certain activities in Chile
directed toward preventing Salvadore Allende from assuming
the Presidency? :

Answer: My knowledge concerning the CIA activities in
Chile was restricted to that information that was discussed
a) in formal meetings of the 40 Committee. The main thrust of
these meetings was pointed toward various financial actions
aimed at assisting the established political opposition to
Allende. I did not attend the last staff meeting in the
White House on the subject of Chile but was represented by
Lt. Gen. Richard Knowles, U.S. Army: Neither did I attend
the National Security Council meeting on the subject in
Noverber 1970. In this case I was represented by General & mereeessiters
William Westmoreland, U.S. Amy. oe =

2. Were you aware that these activities included an attempt by
CIA and DIA officers in Chile to promote a military coup
d'etat by opponents of Salvadore Allende?

Answer: I was not aware that an active effort was underway
to promote a military coup by opponents of Salvadore

Allende. Speculation as to the possibility of independent
action on thesgart of the Chilean military forces, who were
known to be strict constitutionalists, was of course raised sees
from time to time during discussions of the rapidly :
developing Allende episode. As I recall, I was advised’



THOMAS H. MOORER
ADMIRAL U.S. NAVY (RET.)

by General Bennett, Director of the Defense Intelligence
Agency, on one occasion that the DIA was in touch with our
attaches in Chile with a view toward determining the
courses of action, if any, which might be under considera-
tion by the Chilean military. This was prior to Allende's
inauguration. General Bennett noted that the contacts
and friendships developed by the attaches with the
Chilean officers while assigned to the Inter-American
Defense College and the Inter-American Defense Board

were expected to be of assistance.

Did you hear during this time any reference to a two-track
policy aimed at preventing Allende's accession to office?
Specifically, did you ever hear of a so-called Track II?

Answer: I did not hear any’ reference to a ''Two-Track" policy

aimed at preventing Allende's accession to office at that

time (1970). I learned of the so-called "Track II" policy

only a few days ago (1975). Scesduasbeeneoetsetieneoe

Did you know at the time that any weapons had been passed
to Chilean conspirators by the Central Intelligence Agency
during the September to October 1970 period?

Answer:: I was: not aware at that time that weapons were being
passed to: Chilean conspirators by the CIA.

Were you aware of any activities being conducted in Chile
during this time that had not been taken up by the 40 Com-
mittee, either for informational or approval purposes?

Answer: As stated before, the answer is ''No."

Did you ever learn,subsequent to November 3, 1970, of U.S.
efforts to promote a coup d'etat in Chile, a two-track

policy regarding Chile, weapons passed to Chilean conspirators,
or activities being conducted in Chile during this period

that were not reported to or approved by the 40 Committee?

If so, when did you learn of these activities? Through what
source did you léatn of these activities? What specifically
did you learn of these activities?

Answer: As stated before, I learned of subject activities
only a few days ago when I was advised that considerable
information had been requested of the Secretary of Defense



THOMAS H. MOORER
ADMIRAL U.S. NAVY (RET.)

@ by the "Select Committee," and that a thorough search of the
files of the Joint Staff was being. conducted concerning the
subject of Chile. I was given this information by General
George Brown, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who did
discuss the matter with the Secretary of Defense following
Dr. Schlesinger's telephone conversation with Chairman Frank
Church. With respect to the activities generated by the
"Two-Track"" policy, I was advised at this time that there
was in fact a "Two-Track" policy and that communications
were passed between Washington and Santiago with respect to
action by Chilean military officers aimed at preventing
Allende from seizing power prior to the time he was actually
inaugurated. In this connection I should report that so far
as I know there are no references in the Joint Chiefs' files
to the 'Two-Track" policy and I havé personally never seen
any messages, incoming or outgoing, ‘dealing with "Track II."
Hence, I have no knowledge of the details of the events
alleged to have occurred by the New ‘York Times article you
supplied. |

While the above sets forth my best recollection concerning
the Allende episode, I will of course be happy to answer further
questions if you so desire. :

to your request dated 31 July 1975 (Covert Action, Laos,

It is possible that the so-called review was an. up- !
dating of the manual listed as Item 18 in referenced i
request, "CA/PMG paper on Covert Disruptive Action -

In any event, if the Committee staff could provide

Select Committee ... Intelligence A tivities
United States Senate ot
Washington,D.C.

Dear Bill:

Re your letter of July 30th, I am hard pressed just
now and can only be summary: mt

1. The National Security Council is an agency
ereated by “ongress, and it has‘only the powers delegated
to it by Congress. The Act of 1947 does not authorize
use of force or hostile acts.

2. The Executive has no independent authority
to authorize hostile acts. My views on that were
compressed in an article in the N.Y.Times re Mayaguez,
which you will find in Cong. Rec., June 2,1975,
E2772.

3..There is no inherent authority over foreign
affairs. Madison made clear that such authority had
to be "given", and except for authority to receive
ambassadors it wzs made subject to advice and consent
of the Senate. You will find a full length discussion
of this in Chapter V of my Executive Privilge.

4. Congress must come to grips with the fact that, as
President Buchanan said, the President can not fire a
hostile shot, even for the protection of Americans, without
congressional authorization.

All good wishes,

Yours in haste

Dear Mr, Schwarz:

Mr. Lawrence Devlin has asked us to transmit the
following message to you:

"TI regret my delay in replying to your message of
4 August, but as noted in my interim reply, I was forced
to work out some prior commitment before suggesting a
definitive date. If it meets with your approval, I can
be in Washington on Tuesday, 20 August. In view of other
businéss commitments, I would hope to complete my tes-
timony by Saturday, 23 August.

"Please advise me if the dates suggested would be
convenient for the Select Committee. Also, I hope that
it will be possible to review in advance the questions
which you or the Committee may wish to put to me in
order that my testimony may be as precise as possible.
As you will realize, the period in question is almost
fifteen years ago.

"I look forward to as early a reply as possible."

This will confirm our telephone conversation today
and we are advising Mr. Devlin that the dates he pro-
poses are acceptable to you.

Dear Bill:

In reference to the Committee request of 16 July 1975, I noted
that item D. 6. (1960 DCI-BOB Defense Study of Intelligence) was '
previously requested. This document is, and has been since early

) May, located in your study area here at CIA Headquarters. Its full
title is Joint Study Group Report on Foreign Intelligence Activities. "'

The clearance that we obtained from the White House concerning
this document specified that it was to be made available for review
here. If you are now requesting delivery to your offices, then it
would be best if you went directly to the White House since the DCI does
not have authority to transmit it. I hope that you will find the existing
access satisfactory, however.

Select Committee ... Intelligence A tivities

Washington,D.C.

Dear Bill:

Re your letter of July 30th, I am hard pressed just
now and can only be summary:

1. The National Security Council is an agency
ereated by “ongress, and it has only the powers delegated
to it by Congress. The Act of 1947 does not authorize
use of force or hostile acts.

2. The Executive has no independent authority
to authorize hostile acts. My views on that were
compressed in an article in the N.¥.Times re Mayaguez,
which you will find in Cong. ete June 2,1975,

“E2772.

3. There is no inherent authority over foreign
affairs. Madison made clear that such authority had

_ to be "given", and except for authority to receive

ambassadors it wzs made subject to advice and consent
of the Senate. You will find a full length discussion
of this in Chapter V of my Executive Privilge.

4. Congress must come to grips with the fact that, as
President Buchanan said, the President can not fire a
hostile shot, even for the protection of Americans, without
congressional authorization.

All good wishes,

‘Yours in haste

Dear Mr. Schwarz:

We are in receipt of your letter dated July 30, 1975 wherein you
request the cooperation of the City of Miami Police Department

in your investigation of the relationships between federal agencies
and local public departments throughout the United States.

While we welcome the opportunity to cooperate with your committee,
it is our feeling that your request covers an extremely broad
range of information, too broad in fact for our department to
adequately fulfill without incurring a prohibitive amount of
expense. Our legal advisors have been consulted with reference
to your request and they also have some reservations about
approving the release of much of this information in light of

the recently enacted Federal Privacy Regulations (see Federal
Register Vol..40, No. 98 - Tuesday, May 20, 1975).

We would appreciate more specific guidelines with reference to
the information you have requested and would suggest that you
coordinate your work through our legal advisors Ms. Loraine Strait
and Mr. Thomas Connors.

United States Senate : J

Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations
With Respect to Intelligence Activities

Washington, D.C. 20510

Gentlemen:

I have your inquiry of July 30 pertaining to constitutional
issues regarding foreign covert. action operations. As I told
Robert Kelley of your staff on/the telephone, I unfortunately
cannot take time now to pursue jat length the interesting and
important questions you raise.; Permit me simply to sketch my
conclusions.

i

You raise two broad questions of special interest to me:
first, the President's authority to permit the conduct of
foreign covert actions in the absence of statutory authoriza-
tion; second, congressional power to regulate the conduct of
covert actions in view of the President's constitutional powers.

|

It seems to me that the first of these questions is the
more complex but also the less; important of the two. Arguments
may be made, as you know, that; in the absence of statutory
authorization, the President has some authority derived from
his concerns with foreign affairs and military matters. I
believe that the maximum executive authority in this regard is
best viewed in accordance with the three-part division suggested
by Justice Jackson's concurring opinion in the Steel Seizure
Case, 343 U.S. 579 (1952). Justice Jackson's second category
in his Steel Seizure analysis seems especially relevant here:
there may be situations where a President may be able to act
because of “a zone of twilight" -- an area in which there is room
for initiative by either branch, and in which the executive may
act in the absence of contrary congressional directions. I
believe that presidential authority in the foreign covert intel-
ligence area stems largely from congressional inaction or perhaps
implied authorization rather than from any inherent, congres-
sionally untouchable variety of presidential power.

Lag

HW 50955 DocId:32423538 Page 73


But it seems to me that pursuit of the question of the per-
missible range of executive authority in the absence of congres-
sional action is relevant largély to matters of hindsight, and
that the more important question pertains to the future. The
latter question ~- the question of whether Congress has power to
act, to set guidelines, impose restrictions, and exercise over-
sight -- seems to me the simpler as well as the more important
one. Congressional power to enact the kind of measures proposed
in recent discussions seems to me clear -- even clearer, for
example, than the authority to adopt the War Powers Resolution
of 1973. Congress, it should be recalled, not only has autho-
rity to adopt measures necessary and proper to implement consti-
tutionally granted legislative powers, but also, under the quite
explicit terms of the Necessary and Proper Clause, may "make
all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into
execution" "all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the
Government of the United States, or in any Department or Office
thereof." In short, even if the executive branch can assert a
“twilight zone" authority to conduct covert foreign intelligence
operations in the absence of congressional action, any execu-
tive authority in that area is subject to the congressional
oversight and guidelines founded on Art. I, §8, cl. 18 of, the
Constitution.

In short, I would think that the major congressional focus
in the. important task that you are presently undertaking should
be on the question of what measures are appropriate by way of
congressional control. That, I recognize, is a difficult task;
but it is a task which can and'should be undertaken with very
great confidence that Congress ‘has the authority to enact what-
ever it may ultimately find to be appropriate as a matter of
wise national policy.

With high regard, |
Faithfully yours,

iene (Sten

Dear Mr. Miller and Mr. Schwartz:

Thank you very ‘much for writing to me and
affording me the opportunity to express my views with
respect to the legal authority/of United States ‘intel-
ligence agencies for the conduct of foreign covert

i :

operations. “ I

I understand from Mr. Robert Kelly that you
are presently interested in having me consider the
legality of’ these operations under international law.

I agree that this question merits the most careful
consideration by your Committee, but I regret to say that
I am not in a position at thid time to prepare a paper

on this subject.

SELECT COMMITTEE gh New York, New York, 70927

WFELLCehc scnoies alan

Dear Mr. Miller:

Your letter of July 30 invites my views as to the constitutional
authority of the President to conduct "covert action operations."

Since the Constitution does not speak to this subject, and the
Supreme Court has given no opinion on it, I cannot, of course, be highly
confident in my views, but:the following is my considered opinion in brief
outline:

1. Although the Constitution does not expressly confer
the power to conduct covert operations on the Federal
Government, I have no doubt that, as a matter of
Constitutional Law, the Federal Government has the
authority to conduct such operations equally with
other soverign nations. Compare U.S.. Curtiss-Wright
Export Corp., 299 U.S. 304 (1936). Clearly, then,
the President may carry out such operations when
authorized by Congress.

2. If Congress has not forbidden or otherwise reg-
ulated the conduct of such operations, the President,
it can respectably be argued, may conduct such opera-
tions on his own authority. By international practice
such operations, like espionage, appear to be an
accepted facet of the conduct of foreign relations
which is the President's responsibility under his
"Foreign Affairs Powers". If so, he can carry them out
by all means available to him, including the use of
military personnel under his command, in ways short

of war. See Henkin, Foreign Affairs and the Constitution
(1972) «pp. 45-54 and corresponding notes. That such
activities may violate international law, or treaties
to which the United States is party, would be consti-
tutionally immaterial: the Constitution does not
forbid the President (or Congress) to violate our
international obligations, and the President may do
what is within his constitutional authority even if
what he does violates international law.

HW 50955 DocId:32423538 Page 81


3. I am, however, disposed to the view that Congress
can forbid, regulate, oversee or scrutinize, such
Executive actions, at least when gross intervention

in the affairs of other nations, especially with the
use of troops, might invite war, since decisions about,
or close to, war-and-peace are for Congress to make.
If so, Congress can regulate such activities either ~
directly by legislation, or by denying or limiting
appropriations for such purposes.

Need I say that nothing above implies my support or approval for
such activities as a citizen, whether conducted with or without Congressional
authorization?

Sincerely yours,

ae Be

I was on the point of pleading prior commitments for the month of
August in responde to your letter of 30th July regarding the legal authority
of United States intelligence agencies when Mr. Kelly of your staff phoned
me and reassured me about the scope of what I was called upon to do. He
informed me that I could confine myself to the international law aspects of
the questicns put and that a comparatively short statement would suffice.

You may accordingly count on me for a statement in response to your
letter. It should be in your hands by 25th August.

Yours sincerely,

Gentlemen:

This is in reference to the letter of August 5, 1975,
from Me. John’ Elliff of your Committee staff to Departmental
Special Counsel Michael E.. Shaheen, Jr., to which was attached
an additional’ series of requests for FBI materials and submitted
pursuant to the procedures agreed upon by the Committee and the
Department on July 24, 1975. !

An initial review of the Committee's nearly 100 requests
has been made and it is our expectation that both the Department
and the Bureau will be able to camply:with the designated deadlines
with the following exceptions: :

Vv. C. and D. These requests seek specific materials with
respect to surreptitious entries carried out by the FBI. Because
the Committee's requests concern-matters that are extraordinarily
sensitive in nature and involve, in several instances, peculiarly
sensitive foreign intelligence sources. or peculiarly sensitive
ongoing foreign intelligence operations, access to the materials
should be governed by the requirement for special procedures to
be agreed upon, following consideration by the Committee and
discussion at the staff level and with the Department's Special
Counsel.

Dear Mr. Schwarz:

Your request for information about the gathering of
intelligence at a local level, including the names of
individuals who engage in gathering of intelligence,

is incredible! I think that the elected politicians

in Washington who are supposed to represent their states
are doing a pretty good job of raping the FBI, the CIA,
and the DEA. This, however, involves incest because
they are federal agencies.-I suppose if members of
Congress decide to destroy the effectiveness of the
FBI, the CIA, the DEA, and the military that this is
one prerogative as long as their constituents hold
still. :

The attempt to penetrate the appropriate criminal
intelligence mechanisms of local government by federal
lawmakers is an absolute violation of the Tenth Amend-
ment of the Constitution. -It will be a cold day in
hell when I provide you with the information you have
requested.

If I didn't gather necessary intelligence information
on criminal activity in my city to assist me in apply-
ing my resources at the right place at the right time,
this city would be in the same shape as many others.

We are proud of the fact that when crime went up
nationally 26 percent between 1970 and 1974, crime went
down in this city almost five percent. One of the
prime reasons is appropriate intelligence operations

We are proud of the fact that this is the only major
city in the country relatively free of any oraanized
crime influence--that is because of appropriate :
intelligence gathering functions. We are proud of the
fact that terrorists don't intimidate the citizens of
our city--that is largely due to appropriate intelli-
gence gathering processes.

Our intelligence gathering is in absolute conformance
with California law and is done under quidelines set

forth by our civilian Board of Police Commissioners.

I would suggest that you stick your nose back in your
own tent.

Very truly yours,

Deayv Mr. Schwarz:

This is to acknowledge receipt of your letter ad-
dressed to Commissioner Pomerleau, Police Commissioner of {
Baltimore City, dated July 30, 1975, requesting information }
regarding intelligence activities of the Baltimore City Policg
Department between federal agencies and other information ei
related thereto. I am, by special designation, specially
appointed counsel to the Police Department. of Baltimore City
as a result of a declared conflict of interest of the Attorney
General of Maryland. The Baltimore City Police Department,
while funded by the City of Baltimore, is a State agency.

This is one of many unique features of this agency.

Your Committee should be informed that- federal monies
have not been used by the Baltimore City Police Department in
any way to support intelligence gathering activities. This
means that no federal money has been used for the payment of
personnel involved in the gathering of intelligence information,
for the purchase of equipment related to intelligence gathering,
ox payment to sources for information related to intelligence

The Baltimore City Police Department has been inves-

an extensive and all inclusive investigation by two Baltimore
City Grand Juries in which the Department fully cooperated
without the requirement of subpoena, and after this investi-

against the Police Department. These Grand Juries concluded

Baltimore City Police Department."

We have been investigated by the Justice Department
through its agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation. We
have been investigated by the State Senate of Maryland and
have suffered irreparable injury by irresponsible statements
emanating from secret hearings illegally held by that State
Senate, said statements having been reported in the June 23,
1975, edition of the U. S. NEWS & WORLD REPORT. The United
States District Court for the District of Maryland entertained

zl and assumed jurisdiction in a civil action filed by the Polics
Department against the State Senate Investigating Committee,
and on July 3, 1975, crystalizing the issues as being:

a. Does the State Senate Committee have
authority to be other than a legislative
body? i.e., Does it have inguisitorial
or accusatorial powers?

b. Is the Committee conducting its investiga-
tion in a manner required by the enabling
legislation Article 40 Section 72 et. seq.
of the Annotated Code of Maryland that
there should be a fair and impartial hear-
ing consistent with the constitutional
rights with those who are involved and
consistent with the public interest?

Dear Mr. Schwarz:

This is to acknowledge receipt of your letter ad-
dressed to Commissioner Pomerleau, Police Commissioner of
Baltimore City, dated July 30, 1975, requesting information i
regarding intelligence activities of the Baltimore City Polic
Department between federal agencies and other information
related thereto. I am, by special designation, specially
appointed counsel to the Police Department of Baltimore City

Ete as a result of a declared conflict of interest of the Attorney
General of Maryland. The Baltimore City Police Department,
while funded by the City of Baltimore, is a State agency.

This is one of many unique features of this agency.

Your Committee should be informed that federal monies
have not been used by the Baltimore City Police Department in
any way to support intelligence gathering activities. This
means that no federal money has been used for the payment of
personnel involved in the gathering of intelligence information,
for the purchase of equipment related to intelligence gathering,
or payment to sources for information related to intelligence
matters,

The Baltimore City Police Department has been inves-
tigated by.almost every agency in government, except your Com-
mittee. By way of illustration, it was the subject matter of
an extensive and all inclusive investigation by two Baltimore
City Grand Juries in which the Department fully cooperated
without the requirement of subpoena, and after this: investi-
gation which, in my judgment, was conducted in part by indi~
viduals who were something less than neutral in their bias

Dear Mr. Miller:

I was delighted to learn that you will be able to speak at The
National War College on Thursday, 18 September, at 1:30 p.n.,

to those of our students taking the elective course "Intelligence
and National Security," addressing the topic "Intelligence Con-
straints in a Democratic Society: The Congressional Perspective."

This seminar, the opening session for the second bloc of the course,
will be the students’ principal exposure to the ethical and legal
limits for intelligence activities of our democracy. As background,
the students will have read the summary of the Rockefeller Commission
Report and will have been encouraged to keep abreast of developments
in the press. Beyond this, we would benefit in particular from your
insights on impending or likely legislation, the key themes of the
ongoing hearings, and the quality of the public debate. The session
following yours will provide an opportunity for intelligence
collectors to discuss many of the same basic issues from their
perspective.

Perhaps you would lead off with 40-50 minutes of initial remarks.
Following a short break, the group will reconvene for questions
and answers for the balance of the two hours.

The National War College has a well-established policy of holding
all remarks in presentations such as yours in strictest confidence.
This, we believe, permits the speaker to discuss his subject freely
and with complete candor.

In the event you desire additional information, please do not 5
hesitate to call on any of us here at the College. Mr. David W.

Overton, the course director, is our faculty member most familiar

with the scope and purpose of your topic. He may be reached at

693-8493.

Within a few days you will receive a letter from the College
Secretary regarding the administrative arrangements for your visit.

We look forward to welcoming you to The National War College on
18 September.

SSC-CIA PROCEDURES

Procedures for the continuing investigation of the

Agency by the Senate Select Committee are agreed along
the following lines:

1. The Director reaffirms his responsibility to
protect sensitive sources and methods. As a general
practice, Agency files will be screened before the SSC
is granted access.. The primary purpose is to protect
sensitive names and methods.

2. The SSC reaffirms. its need to have access to complete
unscreened files. In practice, the SSC staff has the
right to protest our removal of information. CIA

must be precise when material is removed and explain

why., The SSC staff in‘ appealing, must state precisely
why they think they must have the sensitive detail.

Once the SSC appeals, negotiations would begin at once

aimed at reaching agreement along the following lines:

(When it is agreed that the SSC will have access to
sensitive detail.)

1. A designated SSC staff member will read certain
unscreened files. His notes would be subject to
Agency sanitization.

2. In more sensitive situations, senior SSC staff
menbers will read certain unscreened files. Their
notes would be subject to Agency sanitization.

(When it is not agreed that the SSC staff will have
access to sensitive detail, the following will occur:

1. The Director will take the sensitive detail to
higher authority in the NSC for decision and if the
decision is not to make the material available to the
staff the sensitive detail will be taken directly to the
Chairman and Vice Chairman of the SSC for final
resolution. REC

immediately to ensure that requests are understood. Where
appropriate the Agency may present contextual statements
=5 the Committee or to the staff, orally or in writing.
The Agency will to the maximum extent possible provide
responsive data as soon as it is available and will not
hold up a response until all materials requested have been
compiled. Where documents are withheld because clearance
is being sought from another agency or because it may be
deemed subject to Executive Privilege, the SSC will be

given.

The SSC will summarize and assign priorities ina

SELECT pony, 2

: I MTELLIGENCE AC,
August 1, 1975

Dear Mr. Chairman

and Mr. Vice Chairman: j
i

This is in response to your letter of this date concerning
the request of the Select Committee for certain materials
contained among the "Presidential materials of the Nixon
Administration." |

I appreciate your views on the interpretation to be given
to the Order of the United Statés District Court for the
District of Columbia in Nixon v!/ Sampson, et al. However,
I have been advised by the Department Of Justice, which
represents mé as a named defendant in this litigation, that —
the Order, as it currently stands, prohibits. compliance
with this request until counselfor Mr. Nixon consents to
our undertaking the necessary search and review of Nixon
Presidential materials. Otherwise, I would be construing
the Order differently from the way Mr. Nixon does and
would be doing so at my peril. '-For this reason, we are
unable to comply with your request at this time. -In fact,
I thought Mr. Schwarz agreed with me that only a further
clarifying order by the Court would enable me to conduct
a unilateral search. {i

As you are aware, it is the policy of this Administration
to cooperate fully with the investigations of the Select
Committee. However, under the Order of the District Court,
we lack the unqualified authority to review unilaterally
the documents on the basis of your request. Until these ’
materials have been reviewéd, we cannot address the
question of the handling of any of these materials by this

RW 50955 DoclId:32423538 Page 130


Administration. I can assure you that this is in no =
way intended to reflect any change in our desire to
cooperate fully with the investigation.

I trust that you understand our position in this

Dear Senator:

As you know, the Department of Justice has under-
taken an investigation into various intelligence
operations of the Central Intelligence Agency to
ascertain. whether such activities might constitute
prosecutable violations of Federal criminal law. It
is noted that, in furtherance of its responsibilities
in the area of intelligence activities, your Committee
has also instituted its own inquiries into CIA intel-
ligence operations.

It is requested that this Department be afforded
access to any information maintained by your Committee,
supplemental to that contained in the Rockefeller
Commission files, including any transcripts of testi-
mony which may have been taken in either open or executive
sessions, that may have a bearing on the investigation
currently being conducted by this Department.
