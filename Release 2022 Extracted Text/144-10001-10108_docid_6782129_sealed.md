WESTERN ARMY TOLD TO STAND BY FOR ALERT IN REACTION TO DEATH

OF KENNEDY

Information not previously available. reveals that lst Div

Hq, Bahia Honda, was advised to keep personnel of its command

respons

message; intercepted from (C val 4th) Army Corps Hq, Pinar

del Rio, also prohibited statements pro or .con with regard

to the death of the President.

Bahia Honda replied that steps had already been taken in

compliance with these orders.

COMMENT:

Units of the Eastern Naval District were placed on alert,

presumably due to

the proximity of Guantanamo, Naval Base, after

the KENNEDY assassination, as were unidentified army coastal

observation posts in the First Army area (2/01 R58-63). There

is no indication, however, that Western Army units were formally

put on a state of alert.
