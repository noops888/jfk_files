WESTERN ARMY TOLD TO STAND BY FOR ALERT IN REACTION TO DEATH |
OF EEMNEDE

Per eearion not previously ¢ available: reveals that lst Div

Hq, Bahia Honda,~was advised to keep persgnnel of its command
available in case a state of alert were declared in, response
to-events following the death of President: KENNEDY... The
message, intercepted from (C val 4th) Army: Corps Hq, Pinar
del Rio, also’ prohibited statements pro or teon with regard
to the death of the President.

- Bahia Honda replied that steps had already been taken in
compliance with these orders.

COMMENT:

Units of the Eastern Naval District were placed on alert,
presumably due to the proximity of Guantamam, Naval Base, after
the KENNEDY assassination, as were unidentified army coastal
observation posts in the First Army area (2/0[_\R58-63). There
is no indication, however, that Western Army units were formally
put on a state of alert.
