4k. Conclusicas.

Results of this review of Subfect's file do not support ste
allegations -ade ty DIAZ Lanz. Although the two mafor areas of éoust
recain scevhat unresolved, the weight of evidence would seem to te
in the Scbject's favor.

a. Agency and Bureac fYles contain no identifiable resord
of Scbject's father.

b. ARTI hinsel? volunteered information corcerning bots

the cited areas cpen to poss‘ble question. he Stb/ect
had evexy reason to belfers that the infoszation
volunteered (i.e. that his father’s exsuis‘on from tte
Party was reported in Eo7, ard that the IV2A meeting
was covered by a reporter from Pevalucio=) could be
easily verified, arceeeereerrern

©. The rece:d of AXTIM3's polygraph examination stated
that strong polyezarh evidence had been c:
Subject was 2 bona Zide anvi-Castro and anti—Commaiss
defector; that INGA had heid a xeeting around the
middle of Cctoter at which Stbject was present; and
that the letter of resigaticn addressed to Fidel vas
written ty hin and that it wes generally accurate in
reporting the DGA meeting.

d. There has been no evidence in FI/D that A27DR is
other than what he clains to be.

5. Comment.

Dave Morales, SMHATE/CI, has addttionatty comented that here
4s no love lest betvren AXCIMS ard DIAZ Lanz and that the latter's
allegations against the former are probably false. In view of DIAT
Lanz! feelings against ARIDG, it is not uilixely that he is encearor-.
ing to build hixself up in the eyes of his case officer by discrediting
