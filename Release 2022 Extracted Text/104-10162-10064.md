1. Corclusions.

Results of this rerien of Sablect's file do sot support ie

allegations nade by DIll Lanz. Iltionga the tro sajor areas of crico

rerain

screwbat unresolred, tice reight of evidence would seem to te

in the Sabject's lavor.

a. Agency and Bureau Mles contain no identifiable resavi

of Sabject's father.

b. l'TINZ hissel? volmteered Inioration corcering bos

the cited areas opes to possible questior. he Scbieei

had etery reason to beliere that the information le

valunteered (i.e. tat zis father's expuision fros tie

Party has reported in Fol, ad that the Is reetieg

was covered by a reporter iron Perolucioz) could be

easily verified.

C.

The reccid of All's polygraph erzination stated

that strong polygraçà ericance cad been cotaineá that

Subject was a bona side arsi-Castro and anti-lommis:

defector; that ITA hai heid a reeting around the

midale of October at mich Subject was present; and

that the lotter o? resignation addressed to fidel as

written iy hin ard tcat it ras gereraliy ascarate in

reporting the DEd meeting.

do There has been no eridence in FI/D that ARMR is

Is Do joTe lost betiren AKI ard DIAZ Lanz and that the latter's

allegations against the fornet are probably false. In ried of DIlI

Lanz' feelings against dizat, it is noi unlisely tat he is enceator-.

ing to badld hirself up in the ejes of his case officer by discrediting
