Forward undeveloped LIONION pulse camera film to
Headquarters :

I, Station Mexico City may begin immediately to forward
undeveloped LIONION pulse camera film to Headquarters for
proc. ing. Headquartors plans to forward a positive and a
negative copy of the developed film to Station JMWAVE for
reading and possible printing use respectively. Tho original
negative will be retained in Headquarters for record purposes.

2, As a result of discussion with Lawrence F. BARKER,
Station Mexico City case officer, during his recent TDY at
Headquarters, it was decided not to send any copies of the
pulse camera film to tho Station for the time being. Should
the Station desire, Hoadquarters will forward copies ag
requested. .

3. To insure most expeditious handling, the Station
should send the films directly to the desk since KURIOT does
not hamile bulk jobs of this nature.
