1. AMENBER-1 calli me to tell m that le had had lunch
“, with Luis SOMOSA, He said Somosa's apparent purpose in arranging
the luncheon, for it had been-upor Somosa's initiative that they
had gotten together, was to discuss certain Cuban refugees who
seem to be gearing up for action in regard to the question of
Cuban liberation. I asked after nanes and Sudfect cited Veciana,
Batista Falla, and AMSIDDY-1, stating that these were che names
Somosa had thrown out during discussion, I asked Subject.to. tell
me xhat he had said in regard to eacn am attetpted to elicit
~SSrosa' sown: views on: each of these personalities, Pertinent for
the record is the fact tnat Sudject declared to Somosa tnat
ANBIDDY-1 was, in his ova view, a very questionable fellow for
two reasons: the first, he was overly. cncky and inordinately
ambitious and, secondly, he comes fron a pro-coormnist farily.
In an attezpt to deterzine Soma: views on AMSIDDY-1, I requested
that Subject define more precisely wnat he meant by commnist family, H
but wes unable to obtain a meaning‘ul response. I asked Subject if !
dn the lest instance it sizply didn't boil down to the fact that he Darien |
ust didn't like MMBIDDY and he agreed that tois right well be the
case, Along the line Subject stated that Scmsa had sirply been '
+) thinking of taking up sone sort of contact with AMBIDDi-l. I did
. not press for further details in view of my presumption that there
was probably eome special sort of relationship between Somosa and
AMBIDDY-1, the nature of which it wo: be umealthy for Subject , ta
