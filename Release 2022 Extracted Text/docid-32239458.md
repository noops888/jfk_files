absence of evidence that the release of the information would cause harm to the United
States or to any individual.

Age: 32

Birthplace: Washington, D.C.

Marital Status: Legally separated (no children)

Skills: Shorthand 120 wpm Typing 65 wpm

EDUCATION: High school graduate; graduate of the Washington
School for Secretaries.

EXPERIENCE: May 27, 1962 ~— Present - Office of Congressman
Thomas N. Downing, First District of Virginia.

My entire working experience has been in Congress-
man Downing's office and has fallen into two
major categories:

April 1969 - Present - Caseworker - Duties include
dealing with all constituents' problems relating

to military service, retired military and veterans;
requires a thorough knowledge of all military per-
sonnel procedures. Primary emphasis is personal
counseling for constituents who have problems which
they feel they are unable to resolve through normal
channels. This position demands a strong, unemotional
and patient disposition and the ability to impose
reality upon constituents who are undergoing problems
ranging from fairly routine ones to severe mental and
emotional conditions. This counseling is primarily
telephonic but often personal interviews are required.
Also, handle U.S. Military Academy appointments; requires
selecting all Congressman's nominees to the four major
service academies. Compose all correspondence required
to execute the functions of this position.

May 27, 1962 — April 1969 - Composed correspondence
dealing with numerous facets of constituent inquiries
concerning legislation, federal agencies, government
publications, casework and academies. General office
duties including dictation, typing and filing. Acquired

a thorough working knowledge of all aspects of a Congres-
sional office.

TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:

As you probably know, I am retiring at the end
of the 94th Congress after spending eighteen years
in the House. For the entire period of my service I
have been blessed by having a wonderful staff to assist
me. I am making whatever effort I can to assist them
in obtaining employment on the Hill.

One of the finest people on my staff is Nancy S.
Jenkins. She has been with me continuously for the
past fourteen years. She now handles all military and
veterans casework and makes my nominations to the U.S.
Military Academies, but she has such a varied experience
that she can handle almost any matter that comes up in
a Congressional office. I have no hesitancy whatsoever
in enthusiastically endorsing her for your consideration
if you should have a vacancy in your office. She is an
outstanding young lady whose intelligence, dedication

and loyalty are unquestioned. Nancy is extremely congenial,

affable and has the ability to promote and foster constit—
uent appeal for her Congressman.

If you or your assistant should decide to interview
her, please call my office, x54261; and if you desire any
further information about her, please do not hesitate to

- contact me. My home number in Newport News, Virginia is

804 596-2188.

Sincerely,
