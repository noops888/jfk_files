1992 (44 USC 2107 Note]. Case#:NW

B8261 Date: 09-01-2022

December 8, 1995

Status of Document:

Postponed in Part

Number of releases of previously postponed information: 9

Reason for Board Action: The Review Board's decision was premised on several factors

including: (a) the significant historical interest in the document in question; (b) the

absence of evidence that the release of the information would cause harm to the United

States or to any individual.

Number of Postponements: 3

Postponements: All the postponements in this document represent Social Security numbers.

Reason for Board Action: The text is redacted because the public disclosure of the redaction could

reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, and that invasion of

privacy would be so substantial that it outweighs the public interest.

EXPERIENCE: May 27, 1962 - Present - Office of Congressman

Thomas N. Downing, First District of Virginia.

My entire working experience has been in Congress-

man Downing's office and has fallen into two

major categories:

April 1969 - Present - Caseworker - Duties include

dealing with all constituents' problems relating

to military service, retired military and veterans;

requires a thorough knowledge of all military per-

sonnel procedures. Primary emphasis is personal

counseling for constituents who have problems which

they feel they are unable to resolve through normal

channels. This position demands a strong, unemotional

and patient disposition and the ability to impose

reality upon constituents who are undergoing problems

ranging from fairly routine ones to severe mental and

emotional conditions.

This counseling is primarily

telephonic but often personal interviews are required.

Also, handle U.S. Military Academy appointments; requires

selecting all Congressman's nominees to the four major

service academies.

Compose all correspondence required

to execute the functions of this position.

May 27, 1962 - April 1969 - Composed correspondence

dealing with numerous facets of constituent inquiries

concerning legislation, federal agencies, government
