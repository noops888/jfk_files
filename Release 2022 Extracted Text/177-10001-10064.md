PEDRO MARTINEZ PIREZ, CHARGE OF THE CUBAN EMBASSY IN SANTIAGO, THAT KENNEDY HAD

WOULD START. HE SAID THINGS ARE VERY CLEAR AND THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THEY

HAVE ASSASS INATED HIM, THE CONTRADICTIONS ARE WELL DEFINED AND THE MOMENT WAS

VERY SPECIAL, LIKE THAT OF THE MAINE. MARTINEZ SAID THE UNITED STATES IS NOW

IN THE MOST DIFFICULT POSITION OF THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS IN LATIN AMERICA,.

THE WORLD, GOULART, ARGENTINE PETROLEUM,. PERUVIAN LANDS, CHILEAN MINES AND IN

GENERAL ALL OVER LATIN AMERICA. TOHA SAID HE WAS VERY WORRIED AFTER READING

THE CABLE TRAFFIC. MARTINEZ ADDED THAT IF THE USA IS THINKING OF INVADING

CUBA THEN THEY MUST HAVE EVERYTHING ALL PREPARED AND ALL THE STRATEGY READY AND

THEREFORE THE ALARM MUST BE GIVEN SO THAT CUBA CAN BE PREPARED.

Bo THE CUBAN CONSUL AT VALPARAISO CALLED THE CUBAN EMBASSY IN SANTIAGO TO

DETERMINE POLICY IN THE MATTER OF FLYING THE FLAG AT HALF MAST. THE REPLY WAS.

THAT THERE ARE NO DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH THE USA AND THAT NO OFFICIAL WORD

HAD YET BEEN RECEIVED FROM CUBA, SO THEREFORE NOTHING SHOULD BE DONE. (FIELD

COMMENT: THIS IS AGAINST PROTOCOL BECAUSE THE CHILEAN GOVERNMENT HAS DECREED

OFFICIAL MOURNING INCLUDING FLYING FLAGS AT HALF MAST.)

C. MARTINEZ REFUSED TO MAKE FURTHER STATEMENTS PREFERRING TO WAIT FOR

OFFICIAL WORD FROM HABANA. SEVERAL TIMES HE DENIED THAT THE ASSASS IN WAS

INVOLVED IN THE FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTEE INSIST ING THAT THIS PERSON IS ONLY:

A SUSPECT AND THAT EXTREME RIGHT ISIS OR SEGREGATIONISTS ARE TO BLAME. MARTINEZ

SAID HE BELIEVED THAT THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT WOULD TRY TO PUT THE BLAME

ON CUBA®
