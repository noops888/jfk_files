Operattonal Ples for Continuing

Operstions Agrinst Cube

I.: Actlon: Thie menorandus 19 foX. your laformatlou

and pursiant to jour roguest. Reconsendationa for sotlon tre

conteined 1a Peragraph V bolor. The purpore of this menciruru,

18 to dolinento an operational plan for the

action taict wr

bol1eve should be taken by CIA against Cubr for the predictable

suture. In sunnary the plan provides for enatinuine, even

Intons1ly106, the intalligenco effort ageinst Cuba and for

the roarientation of the curront effort into i long teri

denied aros typo of oporation of the highest prlority.

I. ASSUMPTIONS:

A. The United States Government will five fublic

assurances that, provided no nuclear or offenalve weapore ser

present or re-latroduced into Cuba, and provided Cubri dees

not tele action to threaten

the ponce and security of the

western lenisphere, the Unlted states does not Intand to

B. These assurances will preclude any meaningful CIA

action on a

phased basis to provoke a revolt inside Cubr, since

unless there are major changes in operational and internal con-

dItlone 1a Cuba, such a revolt 1f provoked would be totally.

destrojed by Cuban counteraction In a matter of hours or, at

Fe most

a few daye unless

ine supported by a major Unlted Btates

MilItary commitnent. In additlon, the non-Invasion assurAnces

as a practical matter will preclude invading Cuba on the pretext

of a contrived provocation such as an attack on Guantanano.

C. CIA operations involving a high nolse level and !

distinot glement of attributability, particularly paranilitary,

guerI1llã, and connando type operations will be unacceptable

as a matter of policy.

D. The Castro-communist regime will remain in power for

¡the indefinite future with its security and control apparatus

relatively Intaot and with the capability not only of crushlug

unsupported resistance activity, but of making operational

conditions 1n Cuba Increasingly difficult. While it ig

possible that recent and future developments including the

Soviet action in

renoving the offensive weapons from Cuba mey

serve to weaken and discredit Castro, there ls as yet no hard

indication that the control of the Castro-communist regine over

Cuba has been substantially weakenod.

The United States assurances of no Invasion and no

support olian Invasion will, in effect, constitute giving to

Castro and his regime a certain degree of sonctuary. This will

severely image the norale and notivation of anti-rogine Cubane

both Inside sod outalde o1 Cube, which w1l1 make it Incrensingly

d1f11cult for un to recrult agents, unintain agents already

rocrulted, and continue or intenally our intelligence and other

eIforte against Cuba and the Castro-communiat rogino.

I. Despite the sbove lectors, Higher Authority probably

w1ll continue heavy prensure on the CIA for a meximun olfort

against Cuba and my ever continue to contend that the ultimate.

objective 1s the overthrow of the Castro-communist regine.

This 1o an unreallatle objective, however, except. on a very

Long-tora baglo as the Valtod Statos Government, we bollove,

will be unwilling to the Immediato luture to commit troops

to support such an overthron. The Unlted Statos Government

in 1ts overt dealinga with the Cuban extles probably will not

express the rbove factors to then in the context or with the

bluntnoss statod here.

C. In vien of these factors, the so-enlled "Track two"

course of action, 1.0., unlialted support ol Cuban exiles

and exile groups with no real control or objoctive purposes

In the hope that these groups will be sble to shake the

Castro regine will, although unrealistic, becove increasinly

attractive at various levels in the United States Government.

H. As a matter of policy, polltical pressures and

economie pressures short of blockede, taids, and aggressive

sabotage against Cuba will be continued.

## Page 5

In vien of the above rasumptions paramilitary, commando

and sabotago operations, except in rare selective instances

w1l1 serve little purpose; alao they will be counter-productive

sInce, 1l undertaken, they will anke the collection of Intolli-

gence more difficult and should only be undertrisen in those very

fow lantances. where an unusually high returs can be demonstrated.

Regardless of what other pressures are placed on CIA for

action against Cube, It would appesr clear that Higher Autlinrity

WIll innist on! continued, even intensifled, Intelligence

coverago ot cuba.

In vlor of the pollcy lactors, in lucreased use of

Incilitien, real estate and bastas outalde the United States,

particularly In' latin Anorics, will be both nocessary and

destrable.

I. Adequate serial reconnalaaance of Cuba will continue.

II. OBJECTIVES:

Based on the above assumptions, the following objectiven

appear to be proper for continuing CIA operations agalnst

Cuba:

A. Take all fensible clandestine action to 1solnte

and asslat in Isolatlng tho Castro-communist regime in Cula

tron the rest of the lestern Bemisphere ind the rest of the

Free forid.

Bo: To the maximum extent possible, discredit the Castro-

communist regine in Cuba and 1n the lestern Fenisphere and the

rest of the world.

XXI. OPEBATIONAL PLAN:

A. Espionage and Intelligence Colloction - All ferelble

effort should be undertoken to continue and intensify intolll...

gence collection concerning Cubs. The statua of, our Intelll

sance collection and related operational actlulty at the

premont iime and its development during the past air montha

serve as the basis for the il's report on this particular

matter to the President's Board of Consultants on Forelgn

intelligence.

You will note that this lengthy document

bresks dowa under numerous sub-beadings the intelligence

coverage which has been devoloped. by the Clandestine Service.

Set out below aro speclfios of operational action 1t 18

proposod to tako to continue and, as possible, incroase In-

telligence coverage of cuba.

1. Intelligence Exploitation of Refugees: As you

know, with the quarantine and the cessation of air

travel the heavy flon of Cuban refugees has dwindled

almost to nothing. In vle of this and 1n connection

with the contlugoncy planning for supporting any possible

mflItary sotlon in Cuba, the Opa-Locke Interrogation

Center as such was dismutled, although the personnel

of the Center have been retained Intact. In order to

re-establlsh. the flow of intelligence fron refugees,

It 1s proposed that Pan Anerloan Always and Kll be

Induced to coinstitute their regular 1l1ghts Iron

Havana to Miaml, Thla should be done as soon as

possible nitor the settlement of the current negotintlong

and UN dlscusBlons.: Colncident with this, the Ope-locka

refugee interrogation conter will bo re-established

Mith the sano personnel.

2. Resident Agents in Cuba: Every effort will be

made: to continue to exploit, to the fullest, preserve the

vlabillty of and, there necesenty, re-ostablish communten-

tons: with the 131 recrulted agonts now resident in Cubr.

To an exterit, the spood and effectiveness of this effort

M1ll of course depend upon the stringency of future

Cuban security and control action, which it is imposalble

as yot to accuratoly forecast.

3. Third Country Oporations: The priority on te-

crutting agents in third countries for dispatch to Cuba

will be reiterated and strengthened and every effort

will be nade to iacrease this coverage, both through

the development of additional resident agents in Cubs

and through the dovelopment of additioul legal travellers.

1. TielBony Operations: We will continue to press

the Finison services ho are issisting us in the effort

agninst Cuba for additional coverage, Ineluding the

recrulting of agents within their own rrens for Joint

dispatch to Cuba. The services most effectively co-

operating at this point in this cousection are the

In addition, we will re-survey all other lialson services:

with which ve are in contsct and reiterate to those

appearing to have any assets usable against Cuba our

extrone interest in maximus coverage of this problem.

In connection with the linison problem generally, we will

endeavor to induce all of the Jatson services to male

creater use of their national assets, both inside and

outside of Cuba. Porticular attention will bo given to

possible utilization of the

priticularly Cuban seanen, to incresne the twenty

officers and crew members aboard six Cubin vessels we sro

now running as controlled agents.

G. Penetration of Cuban Installations Abroßd: At

the present time ve are running 12 Cuben diplomats

stationed outside Cube no controlled agents and have viable

operations ained at an additional 20 Cuban diplonate.

le propose to continue and intensily the current progrem

of attempting to recruit or defect every Cuben official

concerning whom we have any reason to belleve a

susceptibility to approach exists. These additional

penetrations will be attempted both through unllaterI

operations and where appropriate in conjunction with

9. Cosmunist Party Operations: A complete survey

has been nade world-wide of all Communist Party

penetration operations and wherever any such penetration

can be directed egainst Cuba either by dispatching the

sgent to cuba or by pointing the agent agsinst Cubin

targets, this will be done, except in those cuses whorn

such action would result in unacceptableprejudice to

the operations 1n the area where the agent is now baser.

It is bolleved that the nost lucrative fleld for the

redirection of such operations to the Cuban targot will

be Litin America where there are 65 penetrations of

varlous communist parties. Of this 65, the survey

we have conducted indicates that 23 have some direct

pertinent access to Cuban targete. All oi these 2? w111

10. Illegally Infiltrated Agents: The two

succonsful black intiltrated teams (COBRA nad ANTORRID)

which have produced substantial intelligence will be

continued, resupplied, and roinforced but pointed

pitnarily at continued intelligence collection and nt

the recrultuent for intelligence collection purposes of

othor Cubans who aiready are logally resident in Cuba

In the aroas where the terms are operating (Pluar del

Rio and Oriente). In nadition, on the most carefully.

selected basis, where 1t appeare feasible, aúditional

agents and teans will be luffltrated black tato Cuba

1n an effort to duplicato the performance of the COBRA

and ANTORRID teans and particularly to rocrult and, te

posstble, tIals additional agents legally resident in

cuba..

11.. Exfiltration: As Persible, agente and potentiri

recruita now 1n Cuba will bo exfiltrated for

• training, Indoctrinstion, supplying ulth communications,

and motivation. They will then be re-infiltrated into

Cuba, primarily on Intolligence slealous, Where ponsible,

this will be done through legal travel channels, but

where this 1s not possible, it will be done wherever

feasiblo through our black infiltration-exfiltration

Incillties, Drinarily our uritine asseta.

B. Much of the above affort as noted vill be primarily

directed tovards developing all posaible evidencen of streas

or strain within the reglme and between the reglue and other

antions, particularly the Bloc.

An intensive program will

be continued to take advantage of any possible opportunity

to weaken, subvert, or splft the regine in any possible.

fashlon:, This 15 baalcally a long torn effort. A grest deal

of work already has gone into this and the current

status of this progran and the proposed lurther expiotation

of the numerous 1asds no have developed 1s being nade, in

the interests of brovity in this senorandum, the subject bf

acte of sabotage 1nsido Cuba Mould appear to serve 11ttl0

D, Param111tarze Conmando, and Guerrille Type Oporattonin:

Given the assumptions 1a PRIEgIaph I abovo, no "ide scale

program of such actlvity should be undertaien. However, te

propose to maintain in being our present facilitles and

the erpabllity of undertaking such operatins in order to

-fully exploit sny substantial chango in Intornal Cuban con..

ditlong or any substantial revolt or uprising which night recur.

E.

Economie Herfare:. It ls proposod to continue sud

Intensily the progran already undertaken to deny through

clandestine and covert means critical materials to the Cuben

«сохошу....

This consists primarily of denlal operations, possibly

sOme preclusive buying and Inducing friendly U.S. and nilled

Iirms and governients to prevent the ahipmenta of strategic

materials to Cuba.

I. Counterintelligence: The current counterintelligence

sad counterespionage progran agalnst the Cuban G-2 and

related services will be continued end as possible intenalfied.

This program has developed substantially and it should be

possible althin the coming months to increase its effoctiveness

considerably ta countering not only Cubra but Bloc Intelll-

gence operatlung sounted against Unlted States Interests

from Cuba.
