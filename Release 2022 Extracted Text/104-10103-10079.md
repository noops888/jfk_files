SUBJECT: Operational Pien for Continuing
: Operstions Against Cube

— aa

1, . Actaon: This memorandua ig for. your information
and pursuant to your request. - Recemmendationa for action rre

contained in Paregraph V below. The purpose of this nenoreory ,
is to delineate an operational plnn for the action which we

' believe whould be taken by CIA ngsinst Cube for the predictabls

ada
‘

_ future. In’ summary the plan provides for ccotinuing, even
” tntensitying, the intelligence effort sgeinst Cuba and for
the reorientation of the current effort into * long tern

* ‘dented area type of operation of the highest pricrity.

-I. ASSUMPTIONS:
‘A. The United States Government will give public
. assurances that, provided ao nuclesr or offeusive weapore ¢re ;
present or re-introduced into Cuba, end provided Cubs dces
; se nat teke aetion to threaten the peace ond security of the -

= BECRET - SENSITIVE] PAPER GO.



B, These assurances will preclude any meaningful CIA
action ton a phased basis to provoke a revolt inside Cube, Since
unless there are major changes in operational and internal con-
ditions in Cuba, such a revolt if provoked would be totally
destroyed by Cuban counteraction in. a.matter of hours or, ot

: ‘of: a contrived provocation such es an attack on Guantanano.

: Oe, CIA. operations. involving a. high noise level and a

; dip: aot: elenient of, ‘attributability, particularly paramilitary,
“ querrtiis, « and comzando type operations will be unacceptable

as a matter of. ‘policy.

.D. The Castro-communist regime will remain in power for

ithe indefinite future with its security and control apparatus

atc.

: relatively intact and with the capability not only of erushing
unsupported resistance activity, “but of making operational

: conditions io Cuba increasingly difficult. While it is
possible that recent and future developments including the
Soviet action in removing the offensive weapons from Cub mry
serve to weaken and discredit, Castro, there is as yet no hard
indication that the:control of the Castro-communist regime over

Cuba has been substantially weakenod.

Be. ‘The United States assurances ‘of. no invasion and no

support oft an invasion will, in effect, constitute giving to

Castro and his regime a certain degree of senctuary, This wilt

both inside end outside of Cuba,’ which will make it “Incrensingiy

- dittieult for us to. recruit agents, maintain agents already

recruited, and continue or intensify our intelligence and other

efforts ageinst Cuba and the Castro-communist regime.

on Despite the above factoss er Authority - probably

“This, As an Lemhecneepehoated objective, however, except. on a very

to Support such, an overthrow. The United Statos Government
in Ats overt. dealings with the Cuban exiles probably will not
the sbove factors to then in hae context or with the

bluntness

‘ ated here.
Ge. In view of these factors, the so-called "Irack Tro",

- course of action, 1.6., unlimited support of Cuban exiles
and_exile groups with no real control ‘or objective purposes

= in ‘the hope that these groups will be able to shake the
Castro regine will, although unrealistic, become _incress ingly
attractive st various levels in the United Ststes Government.
_H. As 8 matter of policy, political pressures sand

sabotage ‘againat Cuba will be continued.



i i : T. In view of the above aggumptions prramilitary, conimando
end sabotage. ‘operations, except in rare selective ‘instsnces
will serve little purpose; also they will be counter-procuct tye
since, it underteken, they will make the collection of intolli-
gence more ‘ategioult and should only be undertrken in those very

’ few instances. where an unusually “high return crn be demonstrrted.
Regardless of What other pressures are placed on CIA for ;
action against Cube, it would tppesr clear that Higher Authority

3. In view of the policy fectora, an iocreased use of
‘tactlities, ’x real estate ond "pasing outside the United States,

* particularly in? Latin Anerics, will be both necessary snd
desirable.

* "al onsecrives:
Based on the above assumptions, the following objectives

appear to be proper for continuing CIA operations against
Cuba: ,

: A. Take all feasible clandestine action to isolate
and aggist in isolating the Castro-conmunist regime in Cubs
from the rest of the Western Bemisphere snd the rest of the
Free World. . :

"B To. the maxinum extent possible, discredit the Castro-
communist regime in Cuba ond in the Kestern Hemisphere and the
rest of the world.

Intelligence. ‘You will note that this lengthy docusent
bresks down under numerous sub-beadings the intelligence
coverage which has been developed. by the Clandestine Service.
Set out below sro specifics of operational sction it is
proposed to take to continue and, as possible, increase in-
telligence peerea of Cuba. i
1. Intelligence Exploitation of Refugees: As you

know, with the quarantine and the cessation of air

ravel: athe heavy’ flow of Cuban refugees has dwindled

“aleost “to nothing. In view of this ahd in connection
-~6—


with the contingency Pplenning for supporting any possible
mjlitary action _ Cuba, the Opa-Locke Interrogation 7
Canter as such was dismantled, ‘although. the personnel
‘of the ‘Center have been retained intect. In order to
_re-establish. the flow of intelligence from refugees,
it 4 proposed . that Pan American Alrweys and KL be
: induced’ to reinstitute their, regular: flights from
Havana to Miami. This should be done 88 soon ag :
possible after the settlement of. the current negotintions
and UN Gigcussions. - Coincident with this, _ the Opa~Locka
vefugee interrogation center will be re-established

with the same personnel.
“Resident Agents in Cuba: Every effort will be
— to continue to exploit to the fullest, preserve the
i viability of and, where necessary, re-establish conmunica-
fans “tions: with the 131 recruited agents now resident in Cubn,
* “No an extent, the speed and effectiveness of this effort
" will of course depend upon the stringency of future
Cuban security snd control action, which it is impossible
as yet to accurately forecast.
3. Third Country Operations: The priority on re=
cruiting agents in third countries for digpatch to Cuba
fiat will be reiterated. snd strengthened and every effort
will be made to increase this coverage, both’ through
“the... jevelopment of additional resident agents in ‘Cubs

end threugh the development of additionnl legal travellers.

4 :
4. ‘deigany Operations: We will continue to press
the Unison services who are sssisting us in the effort

agninst Cuba for additional coverage, including the
recruiting of agents within their own erens for joint
dispstch to Cuba. The Services>most effectively co-

operating at this potaot in this connection ere the

Direct
approaches to several of these Services) either by you
personally or in your name, ps you prefer, ere
being separately recommended. Personal ropresentation

by you to the servicespunderlined pbove would be useful.

In addition, we will re-survey all other Ifaison sarvices =
with which we are in contact and reiterate to those
appearing to have any assets usable sgainst Cuba our
extreme interest in maximum coverage of this problem.

In connection with the Timisopy problem generally, we wilt
endesvor to induce ell of the Waison services) to make
ereator use of their fiational assets, both inside and

outside cf Cuba. Perticular attention will be given to

possible utilizetion of the eee,

i. 5. Maritime Operations: In eddition to increasing
efforts to get at serman agents end other aaritime
essets through Gaison services; we will continue our
unilateral third country efforts to recruit seamen anc

8


prrticularly Cubon seamen, to increase the twenty
officers and crew members aboard six Cuban vessels we sre
now running eas controlled agents.

6. Penetration of Cuban Installations Abrosd: At
the present time we are running 12 Cuben diplomats
stationed outside Cube as controlled agents end have vinhle
operations aimed st an additional 20 Cuban diplomats.
We propose to continue and intensify the current progren
of attempting te recruit or defect every Cuben officin}
represeutstive ebroad to whom we can gein access end
concerning whom we have eny reason to believe a

susceptibility to approach exists. These additions!

penetrations will be attempted both through Umtlatere! —

operations end where eppropriate in cenjunction with
services. —/

7. Audio Penetrations of Cuban Installations
Abroad: At the present time we have sudio and/or
telephone tap coverege of Cuban officirl installations
in é : ie

Ko

mejor expansion of this coverage is presently
contemplated, but we will continue to survey edditionrt
targets of opportunity and wherever possible instolt

coverage in those cases where the additional intelli~

gence from this type of source over and above whet we
f

ere now receiving would esppeer to make such installrtion

worthwhile,

- 1sthere. ere overriding reasons .to, the contrary, The

fo. Gommunicetions Intelligence: We will continue
our present CIA Close Support coverage from the KOLA

station in fiomD at the seme level end will continue
to press NSA for cdditionsl coverage of Cuban comaunicr
tions. As the current situstion “nermelizes" it should
be possible for NSA to reinstitute end perhaps even
increase their seaborne intercept coversge of Cuban
communicetions. ot
9. Communist Party Operations: 4 complete survey
has been made world-wide of a11 Communist Party
penetration operations ond wherever any such penetration
can be directed egainst Cuba either by dispatching the
sgent to Cuba or by pointing the agent agsinst Cubrn
targets, this will be done, except in those cnses where
such action would result in unacceptablgprejudice te
the operations in the sren where the agent is now based.
It is believed that the most lucrative fleld for the
redirection of such operations to the Cuban target wil!
be Latin America where there sre 65 penetrations of
verious communist perties. Of this 65, the survey
we bave conducted indicates that 23 have some direct
pertinent access to Cuban targets. All of these 22 wil!

be directed against these targets unless in any cose

aoe 10. I1Jegelly Infiltrated Agents: The two

q _ silecousful black infiltrated teams (COBRA and AMTORRID)
i Which have produced substantial intelligence wild be
, : continued, resupplied, pnd reinforced but pointed
“primarily at continued intelligence collection and rt
: E the recruituent for intelligence collection purposes of
4 : ‘other Cubans, who already are legally ‘resident in Cuba
eee : , in the areas where the tenns are operating (Piner del
foe Rio and Oriente). In addition, on the most careful ly.
selected basis, where it appears feasible, ‘additional
agents and teens will be infiltrated black into Cuba
: in an effort to duplicate the performance of the COBRA
_8nd AMTORRID teams and particularly to. recruit and, eB
possible, train additional agents legally resident in
{ Guba. i

11. Exfiltration: As feasible, sgents and potentirl
recruits now in Cuba will be exfiltrated for
- training, Andoctrination, supplying with communications,
and motivation. They will then be re-infiltrated inte
. Cube, primorily on intelligence missions. Where possible,
this will be done through legal trave) channels, but
where this is not possible, it will be done wherever
feasible through our black infiltration-exfiltration
fecilitien, primarily ‘our maritine assets,


to weaken, subvert, or.

B, Much of the above effort as noted will be primarily
directed towards developing 211 possible evidences of stress ~
or strain within the regime ond between the regine and, other

_antions, particularly the Bloc, An intensive program wi}l

be continued to teke advantage of any possible opportunity

Lit the. xegine in any ible.

“fashion, , This is basically: a Jong‘tern effort. A great deal

of work. already has gone into this and the current
status of this program and the proposed further expldtation

of the numerous’ leads wo have developed is being. made, 4n

the. interests of brevity in thia menorandum, the subject of
a separate ‘compilation. The effectiveness of sasets aimed rt
actually splitting the regine, 1.e., 8 palrce revolt, will of

course depend, to an extent, on the willingness of the United

+ States Government to support them and it is entirely possible
that® any: gueh effort might -f241 unless supported with militery

forces ‘which on ‘the basis of the. assumptions in Paragraph I
above would appear unlikely.

C. Sabotage: On the basis of the sssumptions set out.
above, comagndo type sabotage, minor sabotage, and other
acts of sabotage inside Cuba would appear to serve little
purpose end should not be undertaken except in the rare

instances where an opportunity ig presented with acceptable

do} major ‘damage to the. Cuban @conony. It. is proposed
to continue. searching for such limited opportunities, but

no. active or wide scale program ig contemplated.

Given the assumptions in Paragraph I above, no wide scale
program ef such activity should be undertaken. However, we
: prepese to maintain in being our present facilities and
the cipebility of undertaking such operaticns in order to
“fully exploit any substantial change in internal Cuban con.
ditions or any substantial revolt or uprising which might oceny.

“intensify the program Slready undertaken to deny through
‘elandeastine and covert neans eriticsl materials to the Cuban

: some preclusive buying and inducing friedly U.8. and allied
firms and governuents to prevent the shipnenta of strategic
-materials to Guba,

F. Sounterintelligence: The current counterintelligence

” and sounterespionage program against the Cuban G-2 and
related services will be continued snd as possible intensified,
This program has developed substantially and it should be
possible within the coming months to increase its effectiveness
considerably in countering not only Cuban but Bloc intell{-

from Cuba.

H, Exploitation of Exile Groups: We will continue

the eleidestine exploitation of exile groups for intelligence
collectinn, psychological warfare and other approved missions,
4s feesihle, we will act to mount es much of this effort es

possible from areas outside the continental United States, rnd

_ Particularly from Latin America, If Higher Authority decides

“on a “Track Two" concept or on any, Similar concept which
.contemplates heavy uncontrolled and only generally directed
action operations of Cuban groups egainst Cubs, it is believed
that, efforts should be made to transfer as much #8 possible

« of the responsibility, for this non-clandestine, non-intelligence

“type. operation into the political field, which is the province
:of the Department of State, In this connection, it is believed
