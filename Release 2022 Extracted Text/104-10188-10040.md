contained a thorough review of the LIFEAT project for the entire project year
through May 1963, most of the items of interest to the project were included in
the’ review through that'date, The following report contains those items not
fully reported or not inaluded in that review plus items of interest occuring
-during June 1963," Except for the abcve noted period, LIFEAT progress reports
‘generally W111 be forwarded on a monthly rather than a quarterly basis.

2, The following report is submitted in accordance with CSFIH-F 52-6-1,
seotion V, paragraph 2 (d) (1).

A. EXPLOITATION OF LEADS

@ LIFEAT/Soviet = During the reporting period LIFEAT has
continued its daily coverage of the home phones of two known
Soviet intelligence officers, Information and leads from this
coverage provide the interested Station Officer with a valuable
oheck on the Soviet contacts of several KUBARK controlled
double agents, There is also provided the type of information
on daily activities of Soviet personnel without whieh the plan-
ning for and successful completion of the technical survei}lence
operation against one of these Soviets would have been impossible,
Station believes that LIFEAT contribution to the success of this
operation deserves particular mention,

DISPATCH

() LAFEAT/Poltsn - LIFEAT support to the BEKNAVE/SECHICK operation
in recent months has been particularly noteworthy in providing
travel piansof BEKNAVE, During the intensified efforts against
EKNAVE in the “coming month plans for periodic live-monitoring
by LIFEAT have been réupletot and should provide a valuable support
yo this operation,

(3) LIFEAT/Yugislav - Of continued Interest to the Station has been

Yugoslav inlssion-for a new embascy, Station plenning for a technical
operation in this area has depended héavily on LIFEAT leads,

. a LIFEAT/Cuban.- LIFEAT coverage in the AMSTRUT case provides a
“\ Wiindéw..to the ‘operation Witch 1s of interest to WAVE and Headquarters,
(Transéripts from these two lines are forwarded semi-weekly. to ‘the in-
terésted“Headquarters component’and- WAVE.) LIFEAT coverage of the
fomhe-“of-a Cuban’ Coniercial Attache provides information of. interest.
concerning Cuban 6 erotal Gantacts and purchases.

(5) LIFEAT/Exiie - Liveat ecverage of ESIARD-1 has been must rewarding in

-terms.of his contacts, travel, and future plans, This information
Ss has been of interest to Headquarters, LIFEAT has exerted every effort

to provide continuing coverage of this target even when ESLARD-1
resided in a hotel under ‘an alias and following his move to new
quarters, Coverage by-LIFEAT was especially difficult during E-l'e
stay at the hotel since the technical problems were considerable and
‘the processing of all calls to and from the hotel in order to extract
E-1's calls was a heavy burden on the LIFEAT processor/translator
staff, “It is noted that in Station's opinion the LIFEAT complex
showed up particularly well in this assignment,

LIFEAT coverage of Judith FERRETO Segura nas been especially
fruitful conceriing thé travel and contacts of Costa Rican Communists,
including their travel to Cuba, It has also provided some leads
concerning ZRKNICK operation,

(6) LIFEAT/American Communist Group in Hexico (ACGM) - During the reporting!
period local ODENVY requested that LIFEAT coverage be initiated on
David DRUCKER, prominent member of the ACOM, Product from this |
coverage, in conjunction with that coverage already being provided
on Charles SMALL (aka SMOLIKOFF), 13 velvable to ODENY ‘n providing
data_on U.S, Communists who travel to Kexico and contact the xembers
of the ACM, Information 1s also srovided on the daily activities
and contacts of members of the ACCH, :

(7) LIFEAT/Miscellaneous - Coverage of a former SNOTH agent at the
request of Headquarters resulted in the knowledge that this forner
agent was in contact vith a number of Soviet Satellite personalities
and was exercing a strong influence on a friend of his, a PAPRIME *
eitizen employed as the local representative of a well known PBPRIE
news media, It became apparent that the PBPRIME citizen, through
his connection with the news media, was veing encouraged by the forser
SMOTH agent in an attempt to “destroy” the senior QDACID official ~
in Mexico, Early warning to this official resulted in action which
greatly diminished the effect ‘of this effort, Coverage of both the |
former SMOTH agent and the PEPRIME citizen is being continued,

LIFEAT coverage was also placed on the private office of a
Mextc was the contact of
former who was guiding
a number of Mexican aruy officers of troop comand rank who would. sup-
| in eny show of force, LIFEAT coverage, however, pro-.
vided no information of value and wes discontinued;

Due to the heavy workload chared by the present LIFEAT processor/
translater staff. it was decided that an additionalagent was needed

* for these duties, Station review of a numver o1 agent candidates to
fill this position was unvertaxen and one individual was’ selected.
See paracraph 2 C below,

Cc, Pmsoost,

“‘Provistonsl operational approval was requested on LIFEUD-28 on 29 May
1963 to fill the need noted in paragraph 2 B above, Recruitment will
be undertaxen when such approval is received,

“yey. OAS Sh “1_was called into the ‘offices of
the | and told that since’ he has
passed the retirenent age (LIFEUD-1 is 63 years old) "room mst be
made for younger men". A retirement payment was agreed upon which, when
all benefits are included, equals to approximately 70 to 8 percent of
LIFEWD-1's base salary, After the retirement plan wes agreed upon,
the in a private conversation, asked LIFEUD-1
to accept a special comission as part-time investigator conzerned
with acrinistrative personnel at 1,000 pesos per month, LIFEUD-1
accepted this ccamission,

‘The above action will reduce LIFEUD-1's access to th
[ }where most LIFEAT tap| were made, The extent o: Ss
reduction can only be determined after LIFEUD-1 works his special
conmisston for a period of time. As 2 preliminary opinion, end not
@ final decision, it 1s believed that LIFEUD-2's knowiedge of and contacts
in the coupled with his new position as personnel
investigator, continue to make hts contribution to the LIFEAT
Project valuable and possibly unique, (See paragraph 2 E below re
security aspects of LIFEUD-1's retirement),

D, LIAO:

In late Fay 1963 local ODENVY requested coverage be instituted on

David SUCKER, OQDEAVY is to process the take as on other ACG coverages.
This coverace was installed 2 June 1963, No other change from that
noted in reference (b).

E, SECURITY

@) In tie security area the rettrerent of LIFEUD-1 and the events

surrounding it have produced two dangers to the operation which
effect bove security and efficiency, The first of these involves
the reduction of LIFEAT access to the Formerly
LIFEND-1 could, by call:

for LIFHD-16 to ente and
there emtablish a tap on a LIFFAT target line, Tapping
throug: a_i not always possible, but has become the standard
method used in LIFFAT operations, It 1s ccnsidered less time con-
suing and somewhat more secure than tapping throush

[___] Secondly, LIFEUD-1, prior to retirement, could backstop th
presence of the LIFEAT (LIFEUD-2 and LIFEUD-3) in areas of the
city outside their normal work areas while these agents worked on the
see LIFEUD-1's retiresent dirinishes
LIFEAT eccess to the [land removes the “protection” LIFEUD-1
provided to tre SSS

In a related incident during a discussion of his retirement
with LIFECD-2, it becaze apparent that ie believed that LICGACH wes
providing backup protection to the entire LIFEAT complex, LIFEUD-1
based this assumption on the fact that at one time he had discussed
Froviding LigSAT with high level protection with a former LIFEAT Case
Officer eod later learned that this Case Officer had visited LICOACH
on a mrber of occasions, From this LISEWD-1 deduced that LICOACH _

{ was in contact with the former LIFEAT Case Officer in order to
LIFEUD-1 hirself never

had any dealings with LICOACH other than during sume investigations
which LIFFUD-1 conducted for the | approximately
nine years ago. At no time has LIFSUD-1 mentioned LIFSAT operatious
to LICOACH. Since LICOACH returned to his-native Western European
country 1 June 1963, LIFEUD-1 will not be told that LICOACH was not
\ in LIFEAT employ, Howwver, LIFEUD-1 has been reminded never to
speak with anyone about LIFEAT without first discussing it with
ie WIISTED, :

PF, TECHNICAL

The change to making. which was the
original LIFEAT tap method, is the most obvious change on the operational
horizon, Technically there is no difficulty to be overcome and in some
ways this system of tapping is a simpler method of doing the Job, The
increase in security risk was noted in paragraph 2 E above,
