ning for and suocessful completion of the technioal surveillance

(5) LIFEAT/ELle - LUFEAT Coverage of ESLARD-1 has been must rewarding in

has been of interest to Headquarters.

LIFEAT has exerted every effort

to provide continuing coverage of this target even when ESLARD-1

resided in a hotel under 'an allas and following his move to new

quarters.

Coverage by LIFEAT was especially difficult during E-l'e

stay at the hotel stnoe the technical problems were considerable and

the

processing of all calls to and from the hotel in order to extract

E-I's calls was a heavy burden on the LIFEAT processor/translator

staff:

It is noted that in Station's opinion the LIFEAT complex

showed up particularly well in this assignment.

LIFEAT coverage of Judith FerRaTO Segura nas been especially

fruitful concerning the travel and contacts of Costa Rican Cormunists,

Including their travel to Cuba. It has also provided some leads

(6) LIFEAT/American Communist Group In Mexico (ACGM) - During the reporting

period local ODENVY requested that LIFEAT coverage be initlated on

David DRUCKER, prominert member of the ACGM. Product from this

coverage, in conjunction with that coverage

already being provided

on Charles SMALL (aka SMOLIKOFF), is valuable to ODENVY in providing

data on U.S. Communists who travel to Mexico and contact the nembers

of the ACCM.

Information 1s also provided on the dally activities i

and contacts of members of the ACCH.

(7) LIFEAT/Miscellaneous - Coverage of a lormer SNOTH agent at the

request of Headquarters resulted in the knowledge that this former

agent was in contact "ith a number of Soviet Satellite personalitles

and was exercing a strong influence on a friend of his, a PAPRIME

cittzen employed as the local representative of a well known PBPRIME

news media.

It became apparent that the PBPRIME citizen, through

his connection with the news modia, was being encouraged by the forger

SwolH agent in an attempt to

"destroy" the senior ODACID official

1n Mexico.

Early warning to this official resulted In action which

greatly diminished the effect of this effort.

Coverage of both the

former SMOIll agent and the PAPRIME citizen is being continued.

• LIFEAT coverage was also placed on the private office of a

Mexican, erni General based' on i lead that he was the contact of

former

who was guiding

a number of Mexican aruy officers of troop command rank who would sup-

Provisional operational approval was requested on WFEJD-28 on 29 May

A retirement payment was agreed upon which, when

all berefits are included, equals to approximately 70 to 80 percent of

LIFEND-I's base salary. After the retirement plan wes agreed upon,

In a private conversation, asked LIFSUD-1

to accept a special commission as part-time investigator conserned

on a maber of occasions.

TECHNICAL

The change to making
