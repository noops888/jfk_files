Within 43 hours after AL EXANDRIA talked with
COBB ebout Mr. DANIELS, COBB advised that
she was contacted by ALEXANDRIA who said,
"You know my friend - I never mentioned his
name to anyone, not even to you, ” And COBB
agreed that ALEXANDRIA had net mentioned her
friend's name. ALEXANDHIA went on to say,
“But he.is very concerned. Someone called

him from Washington and said that someore
reported him to-his superiors and he asked me -
(ALEXANDRIA) to whom IT had mentioned his
name." COBB advised that ALEXANDRIA svated
that she could not believe that she] had mentioned -
his name to anyone.”

ALEXANDRIA also advised COBB that ker friend
in CIA had obtained a position fer her in Tom
Dooley's organization, Medico.

5. The above informaticn and chronolvgical ordar of
events would appear to have definitely established the fact in
ALEXANDPIA's mind that June COBB is in contact with personnel
of CIA. It was definitely confirmed in COBB's mind that the

- undersigned end her-case officer, Lirs. Pearson, were CIA.

. 6 Mr. DANIELS advised that he had first met Diana
ALEXANDRIA in May 1960 as the result of a confidential FBI
lead, inasmuch as Mr. DANIELS was attemptiny to develop
informstion regarding Fidel Castr2's life.

7. Mr. DANIELS confirmed that he has been in regular
contact with ALEXANDRIA since May 1960. He has asserted
that he advised ALEXANDRIA only that June CCBB was "clean"
and this reference to ALIKXANDRIA meant onty, as far as he
wes concerned, that COEB wes physicslly a clean person and”
that she would te a good roommate for ALEXANDRIA,

8. Mr. DANTELS advised that he did question ALEXANDRIA
as to whether or not she’ had mentioned his naree ic anyone.

9, Tt, therefore, appears that the events which have
taken place have been corfirmed. The degree of security implication
cannot be presently determined. In other wards. ALEXANDRIA's
discussions with personalities unknown reaarding June CCBB
is a big question, The possibilities of ALEXANDRIA's discussions
with Cubsn nationals is most likely since she is in contact with
raany of them in the New York area.

10, Mr. DANIELS further advised that ALEXANDRIA

expects to depart New York City for San Diego during the week —~ ..-.-

of 24 Cctober. ‘Ik appears that she plans to make a permanent

he did obtain employment for ALEXANDRIA in Medico but that

she had resigned from this position during the week 17 October.
