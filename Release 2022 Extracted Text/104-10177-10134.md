The Little Man Of The Chimes

‘Once upon a time there was a Vers Old Lady who lived by hencit
tn a sonait brown house, She hail a rocking Mair, a thick storybook, and
a cock that chimed. Every day the Very O'd Undy sat in hee rocking
chale beside the window. Slowly she ricked tack and forth apt read
stories trom the thick. book. There was a story about a whitestonped
movuta'n in Japan, one about a gray castle in Snain with a thou
‘and rooms. And one was 9 story of a gélden horse'in Africa that could
fun faster than the wind.

At the end of each-honr, 28 the Very Old Lady read feom the
thick story book, the clock played Is chimirs. ‘They were as sweet as the
fong of a bird in Springtime, as scet as a babbling bevok rippling
over the nebhies, as siteet.as a taby cooing to Ite mother.

‘The Yers Old Lady was fapny, for she loved the clock and her
thick loFstovk and her rocking cba'r.

“Put one day when the Very Old Lady nat reading, the chimes In
the clock sounded tired, Every hove. 98 they rang ovt, the notes
came more sows. Finally. at s'x ofc'ock, the chimes dld not cling at
all, The on'y sound from the clock wan Hs soft tlehtock,

‘The Very Old Lady opened the g’acs door that corered the face

of the clock. She took down a key and wo-nd the sprine.’She tanped
the clock very gently. Then ske sat down In the rocking chalr to
walt”
‘The hands of. the clock told the Very Old Lady that it was seven
o'clock. Bit again no chimes sounted. Only the ulet ticktock of the
clock could be hrard. ‘The Very O'd Lady walted for another hove.
Biot at eight o'clock the eklmes d'd not play. At nine the Very Old
Lady put away the thick storybook, turned out the light, and went
to bed. She thought and thought about the chimes and wondered
what could have hanpened to them, She wondered whether’ they
would ever play again,

The Very Old Laily was a'mest asleep when
heard a onece somnd tn the room. It sas cose to her'ear. Sho sat up
tn bed and Ilrhted the lam, She got up ard tooved tn all the corners
of the room. There was no one there, She leoked bebind the door.
‘There was no one there, :

. ‘Ht must have brea the wind a the irces” said the Very Old
fady. And she (ined out the Tiahl ard went bark to bea,
