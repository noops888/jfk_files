Guard, C Team, 66th USK Artillery Detachment, Datteln (108421), Federal
Republic of Germany (FRG), APO New York 09078, was interviewed at his place
of duty regarding an incident of possible Counter—Intelligence interest,
and stared substantially as follows:

(7) At 1200 hours on 3 February 1972, Creed received a telephone call
at the unit from John the Dee Jay. John began the conversation by asking
Source his last name, saying that he had a difficult time getting a hold of
Source knowing only his first name Bob. Source told John his last name and
then was asked to spelliit. Source spelled his last name while John repeated
it slowly as if he were writing it down. John asked Source if he could meet
him at the Lord Nelson Bar, Datteln, that evening. Source replied that he
could and asked John if he wanted him to return the Air Force parka he had
borrowed from him the previous evening. John said that it was not necessary
to return the jacket and that Source could hold on to it for a while if he
wished. John said "You didn't have a chance to get to the man at the photo
shop yet, have you?" Source said that he had not. John said thet it did not
matter, it could be done later. John asked Source if he could meet him at
the Lord Nelson at 2000 hours, to which Source replied that he could. The
conversation ended.

Source met John the Dee Jay at 2000 hours, 3 February 1972,
in the Lord Nelson, Datteln. John was very interested in the Military
Police that were in Datteln, wanting to know why they were in town. John
stated that he knew they had come from Westkirchen (MC3549), FRG, and wanted
to know where they were going next. John was extremely interested in the
Military Policemen, John was interested in the jeeps that the Military Police
had with them, two of which were parked in the parking lot near the lord
Nelson, John wanted to know what the numbers written in chalk on the jeeps
meant, Were they call numbers or code numbers as to the point of origin of
‘the jeeps, John mentioned that the radios in the jeeps were nothing, that
he knew where he could get a radio that could reach Brazil. John mentioned
Julius and said something about Julius having some military photographs.
John was not clear on this point and Source was unable to determine exactly
what John had meant. John said that he was going to have his photograph
taken at the Althoff Photo Shop, Datteln, which was acress the street from
the Western Bar, where John resided. John asked Source to bring him some
war and Army books. John said all he wanted were some war stories, nothing
about NORAD or SANRAS (Special Ammunitions Recognition and Authentication
System). Source was not positive that John had said SANRAS because John
had said it quickly, but Source was fairly sure. John offered to pay for
all Source's drinks if Source did not have any money. Source returned
the borrowed Air Force parka to John who was very suspicious about it and

wanted to know where it had been the last couple of days. Source told John
that it had been in his room at the unit, but John was still quite nervous
about the parka. John stated that he did not tell anyone about what Source

some members of the Military Police thet had just entered the Lord Nelson,
John talked only to members of the convoy from that time on. Although Source
remained in the Lord Nelson for two more hours, John did not approach him
again. Source was suppose to meet John again at 1700 hours on 5 February
1972, at the Stadtschaenke Bar, Datteln, but told John that he had duty
