Subject:

FOI Request Regarding List of West to East

Defectors, Including Lee H. OSWALD.

1. Paul a. Hoch, who has previously requested

information on Lee H. OSWALD and on the Assassination

Ho OS ALD

of President kennedy, has now submitted a request to

the National Archives for the release of a 1960

memorandum fron the Department of State to CIA.

Attached to the memorandum was a list of 12 US defectors

to Communist countries.

2. The Department of State has reviewed the

docunent and has

made its decision as follows:

The menrandun can be declassified,

but CIA should be involved in the decision because the

memorandum contains mention of DCID 4/2 and one of its

provisions.

b. The list attached to the memorandum

should not be released to the public donain because it

contains subjective judgenents regarding US citizens

and thus could constitute an invasion of privacy. The

Department lists three excoptions to this point:

Willian MARTIN, Bernon MITCHELL, and Lee H. OSWALD.

3.

We suggest that ClA concur with the departmen

of state, except as follows:

a. The menorandun should be released,

sxcept for the sentence beginning with "Using the defi-

nitions of DCID 4/2".
