Albers keeps commenting about the meaning of the word “appointment”
ay (he gay te correcting Rojas on the message froz Joe Digo for A:a ricio)
Alterc says: Don't forget that, because the word "appointment" is used
: very frequently.

Apaticfo comments: Then there's "date" -- "engagenent" 1s used in
~ another sense, but not for going to eat.

Alber says to leave that and start working on something more importent.
Aparicto dictates to Rojas:
"Conpatiero" Editor -- I acknowledge your kind note Ro. 2 83,
of March 23rd last, inforaing that you have not received
the magazine "Siempre", at the Casa da las Americas,
which had a subscription and the remittance of which
magazine was taken care of by Compafiera Teresa Proenza.
In this connection I transcribe below reply frou Compafiero
Raul Aparicio, Cultural Advisor: ....the magazine "Siempre"
wag .elways remitted to Compafiera Marta "Tzeta" (way it sounded)
ty Spita. Neus Hxpresotti (or something lika that) of the._
Publishing House "Erano" (way it sounded) but she stopped
sending it in view that the books they sold to Cuba havo
never been paidy in spite of the fact that they accepted |
payment in Cuban currency which did not involve any exchange i
charges, This coincided with the discharge of Hiss Proenza

from her job.

Some man interrupts Aparicio'a dictation and tells Aparicio peed |
about theatrical activities which vere carried on in Cuban before 1961,

i and that afterwards they did not do anything nore. Aparicio remarks that
they sust have had a premonition of what was coning...(evidently refer-
Ting to Communism). Hear laughter. (Thoy keep talking but in lower voice |
and cannot understand). i

Man is heard remarking: This alreedy was the participation of the 0.6.
in the Vonezuele affair.

Apsrieto continues dictating to Rojass Since last week wo have
sent the remittances of this magazine to the Casa do les
Americas to Srita Marta . « and also copies have been

of the program as well as of the conferences,
and to which a very selected public attended,
resulting 1n a success for the Institute,
The speakers gave a beavtiful and positive
"Viston of Cuba" (This was the title of the
conference), During a conversation hed yesterday
with Fernando Benites....

Alteru interrupts snd asks Aparieig about some film which ts
going to be shown and whether he can come to the Enbassy ot
Aight, Aparicio says he's very busy.

Aparicio continues dictation:

“@ long article on Cuba and which was going to
be putlished within 8 days. ‘This article on Cuba

illustrations wera delivered by Aparicio incediately
upon its receipt from the Casa de las Americas,
The speakers went to Cuba invited by the Casa de
las Americas to participate as jurors in the Latin
American literary contest organized by said Cass de
las Americas."

Hear woman's votce which sounds like Apericio's wife, Aparicio
‘tells Rojas he has to go out but that he's coming back,
Apericto's wife tells bim a man celled hin at the house the day
before and she gave him his office telephone number, Aparicto
says: Oh, Mondragon. .

Hear Rojas talking to someone far avay, Liche ceils Rojas on the
interphone and says: Teall Aparicto thera is a Mr. Carlos Lopez here
