Defense Department and the Select Committee that all requests
for information from elements of Defense will be directed
to the Special Assistant to.the Secretary and Deputy
Secretary of Defense, Mr. John G. Kester. -I am therefore
taking the liberty of forwarding your letter to Mr. Kester

M/R: The above response is consistent with a letter of
understanding, dated 5 April 1978, between John G. Kester,

and G. Robert Blakey. The letter essentially defines the

ground rules under which the House Select Committee on
Assassinations will be provided information obtained from
intelligence sources; that is, requests for information "...will
be stated as specifically as possible with respect to dates and
subject matter and will be directed to the Department of Defense
rather than any Defense intelligence agency...." Coordinated
