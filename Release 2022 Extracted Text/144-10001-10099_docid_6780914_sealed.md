TEXT OF CUBAN LETTER OF PROTEST TO MEXICO

FR Havana: ROA ' 29 Nov 63

Msg Nr: 7549

The following transcription is the text of the note presented
on Tuesday night to the Mexican Embassy for the maltreatment of
the employee of the Cuban Consulate in Mexico City, SILVIA DURAN,
in relation to the request for a transit visa made by LEE HARVEY
OSWALD.

Regards,

I have the honor of addressing myself to Your Excellency
in order to expound the following:

Our embassy in the Republic of Mexico has informed this
Ministry that the employee of our consulate in Mexico City,
Mrs. SILVIA DURAN, of Mexican nationality, was detained by
agents of the Federal Police of your country, and also her
husband, on-the night of Saturday,-23 November, and that,
furthermore, her home was violated, a search having been made
of it. She was kept in prison until approximately midnight
and during her detention she was submitted to a violent and
coercive interrogation in relation to the request for a transit
visa made to our consulate in the month of September by .
the United States citizen, LEE HARVEY OSWALD, accused? of the
assassination of President KENNEDY.

Mrs, SILVIA DURAN told the aforesaid agents all she knew,
adhering strictly to the truth; in spite of which she was the
object of censurable treatment, going as for as to make
despicable insinuations and asking her about supposed personal

relations; even intimate, with Mr. OSWALD, Furthermore, she was
physically mistreated by the agents of the Federal Police of
your country; as a consequence of which, she bears bruises on
her arms,

The Revolutionary Government feels that the gross, illegal
and unjustifiable manner in which the police arrested and
maltreated Mrs. DURAN corresponds to the plan of the reactionaries
that, in the United States, planned the assassination of KENNEDY
to promote a policy of retrogression and was continued on
infamous accusations against Cuba and other countries.

The gravity implicated by the conduct of the aforementioned
police agents cannot be dismissed by the Government of Cuba,
which considers this act a flagrant complicity of the members
of the Mexican Police with those who treacherously tried to
involve our country in the filthy: crime,

The dispicabilities, coercious and physical aggressions
of which an employee of our consulate in Mexico City has been
the victim, constitute not only a criminal act which challenges
the judicial authorities of your country, but also the ignoring of
the minimal guarantees to which are accredited all the officials
and employees of a consular office. The transpired events are,
besides, totally unfriendly toward Cuba,

Therefore, the Revolutionary Government of Cuba feels
itself in the right and with the duty of presenting before
the Government of the United States of Mexico this protest
and stating to your illustrous government that the perpetration
of these acts damage the friendly relations between both
Governments, the maintenances of which have been of profound
and demonstrated interest to the people and the Revolutionary
Government of Cuba.

I take this opportunity to reiterate to Your Excellency
my highest esteem.

RAUL ROA, Minister of Public Relations,
Republic of Cuba
