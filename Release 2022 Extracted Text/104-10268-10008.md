Mexico Station Coverage of Soviet and Cuban Embassies (1963)

:.:

1. Unilateral Coverage:

From the time the Mexico Station was opened in April 1947 until

the arrival of Mr. Win Scott as Chief of Station in 1955, the Station had

developed a support apparatus to exploit leads from the Soviet Embassy in

Mexico City. This umbrella type project (LIPSTICK

phone taps, three photographic sites, a mobili

mail intercept operation.

telephone company who

adied by a Station case officer. The number

of lines tapped wa

imited only by the availability of a listening post

nearby and the availability of langauge (English, Spanish, Soviet, Polish,

Czech, etc.) transcribers. Generally, these were Mexican or Mexican-

American recruited agents.

Three photographic sites were handled by a Station case officer

assisted by technicians on TDY from Headquarters who advised the Station

on the best types of cameras, films, and concealment devices. These

operations had sub-crypts under project LIPSTICK (namely: LIMITED, LILYRIC

and LICALLA). LIMITED was a fixed site directly opposite the Soviet Em-

bassy (across the street) which had both a vehicle and a pedestrian en-

trance. The gate to the Soviet Embassy was on the northwest corner of the

•Soviet compound and the LIMITED site was diagonally

across a double laned

street on the southeast corner of that block. (See attached diagram).

LIMITED was the first photo base and operated strictly on an experimental

basis in the early stages. This base, however, was closed when the Sta-

tion received word that the photograph of the "unidentified man" was

being released by the Warren Commission. LILYRIC was an alternate photo-

graphic base. It was located in an upper story of an apartment building

on the same side of the street as the LIMITED site bu

e middle of

the block south. It had a planted view of the

gate of the Soviet

Embassy. LICALLA, the third photograph

site

was located in one of a

row of four houses on the south aid

gE the Soviet Embassy compound.

This site overlooked the.

arden of the Soviet Embassy compound. The

purpose of this operat

Gnawas to get good identification photographs of

Soviet personnel. The three photographic sites were managed by a re-

cruited agent who was a Mexican citizen, the son of an American mother

and Mexican father (deceased). This agent collected the film from the

LIMITED and LILYRIC sites three times a week. The film was then de-

veloped and printed into 8 x 10 contact print strips.

LICALLA film was

originally processed in the Station but in early 1959, due to the resig-

nation of a technician, this film like that of LIMITED and LILYRIC was

processed on the outside by a recruited agent.

Mobile surveillance was conducted by two American staff officers.

These two officers organized a surveillance team of six recruited agents

which used late model cars and a panel truck for surveillance. The team

could be activated by radio from the LIMITED site whenever someone of

interest left the gate of the Soviet Embassy. These agents were aware of

the LIMITED site since they had been issued LIMITED photographs for

identification purposes.

The Station also conducted a unilateral

LIENVOY, was run by a Mexican officer. The listening post had 30 lines

connected at one time. The transcription room was staffed by Mexican

Army officers. In 1961, because of mismanagement by the Mexican prin-

cipals, the Station chief, himself, became the project case officer. A

Station officer assisted him in the daily supervision of the listening

post, and in picking up the transcripts and the tapes. There was also

an American technician inside the listening post.

3. Oswald Coverage:

In mid-1962, the Mexican officer in charge of LIENVOY (the

joint tap operation) asked the American officer at the buenor listening

post for the telephone numbers of the soviet, cunni arelsite En-

conversations of interest which were then included in a daily resume

for the Chief of Station. Later, when a reel was completely recorded,

full transcripts were typed and passed to the Station; however, there

was usually a time lag of a day or two. Reels which contained Russian

equipment using a pulse camera which frequently developed mechanical dif-

There was some delay because Station personnel waited to compare the

ex arizental basis in tie early stages.

I trink the l'exi Station bought

one storey

this property (a/Spanish Colorial stone house) through LINOUSIE (check to

be sure). Later this house began to fall apart. This base was closed when

the Station got word that the photo of "uniden man" was being

releasea to the

public by

the Warren Connission. The photo operators were moved to another apt

nearby. The property vas sold (under an operational agreement with LIlOUSINE

for a long term lease on the top floor of a new apartment blding to be built

on this site). LILYRIC was planned as an alternate photo base to LIMITED.

It was in an upper storey (3rd floor -check) on the sare side of the street

as LI-ITED but in the middle of the block South. It had a slanted view of

the front gate of the Soviet Erbassy. The agents in LIMITED and LILYRIC (both

Vexican fazilies) as far as we knew, were not acquainted with each other.

LILYRIC was a rented apartment. LICALIA, the third photo site,

• This site overlooked the back garden of

the Soviet Embassy complotd.

The purpose of this operation was to get good

identification photographs of the Soviet personnel (uno at thet time were largely

unidentified in Mexico Station records). The three photo sites were handled by

Ramon Alvarez (Mexican citizen of U.S. mother who taught elerentary level at

the American School). Ranon collected the filn alienseestherethm from LITTED

and LILYRIC three times a week. His sister's husband, Carlos (Mexican doctor)

developed and printed the film into Sxa0 contact print strips. The master plan

tuit

was

for LIGALLA film to ie processed inside, TSD man from 1957 to 1959 (Harper

Holt - resigned) could not handle the volume and as the

unprocessed film began

to accumulate, the inside CO (lahoney) became disgusted and took the filn out

for Ramon's brother-in-law to process (probaily early 1959). Thus Ramon became

the handler for all three photo bases.

About nid 1962 (crack date) Limoy outside lexi rept asked

for the telephone numers of the Soviet, Cuban, and Satellite Ebassies.

With this forevarning, LIFEAT (unilateral coverage) was disconnected. However,

as I recall, the Mexicans connected 5 Cuban lines, 5 Soviet lines, 3 Czech,

2 Polish, and I lugoslav line. The basehouse listening

post had a live

monitor wro made

short sunnaries of interesting conversations for a daily

resume which was received each day arourd 8 a.I. (passed by Flick to Goodcasture

to get to Scott before 9.a.., Later (when the reel was completely recorded)

full transcripts were typed ard passed to the station in the same way, however,

there was usually a time lag of a day or

so. Those transcripts which rad

Russian or another language besides Spanish or English went out of the listening

post the day after the transcript (of other conversations.ou

the

reel) was

2273

typed. These reels were taken to another location vière

they

were translated

and typed. In the case of the Russian transt

stions, Boris Tarasoff usually ran

about a week behind the date af

Engagversation because of the volume of

Russian conversations an

de embers of the Soviet Eubassy. During this

period (fall of 1963) the reels were probably being brought into the station

and carried to Boris by one of the people from the Soviet Section or they may

have been carried to him by Flick but I think I brought the reel in and gave

it to Herbert Manell to take to Boris. Herbert lanell and his wife Barbara

handled all of the processi:g of Soviet transcripts. ly job involved screening

the photographs. as soon as we learned that the man calling hinself Oswald was

probably an Anerican.

However, here again there was a backlag because the

photos were ricked up three tines a week but the ones picked up were usually

for dates a few days previously because the doctor proceased the film on a

night time basis. Photographs were made usually until one roll vas used but

later we got it changed to one day coverage on each roll - in other words the

operators cleared the camera each day wretcer there was anilines a full

roll of film exposed. Instructions were to cover office hours, photograph each

The Cuban

embassy coverage had more sophisticated equipient (a pulse ca:era) but it

frequently develored rechanical difficulties. Bob Zarbarnardi and Scatkar

(I think) handled this film - pick up and delivery. Lorna lackay screeted

the film inside the station.

I am certain that the Oswald call came to our attention from the

Soviet line.. It was picked u; and taken to Boris for a translation because

the caller was trying to speak Russian. Any delay was caused by waiting to

compare the photographs with the typed transcript. There were no copies of

the Consul is not there.

The unidentified man asked what is needed

to get visas to go to Odessa.

He is told to call back at 1130 hours.

Item 137, page 2

At 1235 hours a man named ALATRISTE (not a Soviet) from inside the

Soviet Embassy Consulate calls out to number 45-37-72 (Colonial

America, probably a pension or hotel but number not listed in the

telephone directory) and speaks with a man named SAN ROMAN.

ALATRISTE says that he is in the Russian Embassy and they need to

know what day the boat "KALONIA" will arrive in Odessa, that the

Soviets will also need copies of the passenger manifest....

(One concludes that ALATRISTE and SAN ROMAN are shipping+ representatives

for the boat

"KALONIA"', and needed routine visa information, First

a call was made to the first listing for the Soviet Embassy

in the

Mexican telephone directory (which turned outato be the Military Attache).

They got the phone number for the Consulate and the address.

After

making a call to the Consulate and learning that it would not be open

until 1130 hours, ALATRISTE went to the address to get the needed

information.)

• Item 395, pages 7 and 8

Just after 1600 hours,

the Soviet Consulate received a call from the

cuban Consulate (Svivia DURAN) who said she had

there a U.S. citizen

who had requested a transit visa to Cuba because he is going to the

USSR. DURAN wants to know with whom he spoke at the Soviet Embassy

because she sent him over to them telling him that if the Soviets

approved the visa then the Cubans would give him one without anything

more, advising the (Department of) Immigration in Cuba. She wants

to know with whom he spoke because he says that he doesn't know

either with what person and who told him that certainly there would

be no problem.

The Soviet asks DURAN to wait a minute.

After a

short wait DURAN explains the same thing to another

Soviet.

This

Soviet tells her to leave her telephone (number) and her name and

someone will return the

call.

DURAN gives her name

and telephone

number 11-28-47 then says as

a personal thing,

she has moved and

has not advised them of a change of address so will not receive their

Bulletin and can give it to them now.

The Soviet asks her to call

KOUKHARENKO in order to change that address and asks for the name

of the (Cuban) Cultural Attache.

DURAN says it is Teresa PROENZA

whose number is 14-13-26.

The Soviet thanks her.

OSWALD WAS IN MEXICO CITY IN LATE SEPTENT AND"EARLY OCTOBER TO

GET A SOVIET VISA AND A CUBAM TRANSVE VISA, DID HE VANT TO TRAVEL

TO CUBA RIGHT AWAY, ALONE, OR HAVE HIS WIFE JOIN HIM THERE AND

THEN LEAVE FOR CUBA, OR DID HE PLAN TO RETURN TO THE STATES FIRST

AND THEN LEAVE LATER. ALTHOUGH IT APPEARS THAT HE WAS THEN THINKING

ONLY ABOUT A PEACEFUL CHANGE OF RESIDENCE TO THE SOVIET UNION,

IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT HE WAS GETTING DOCUMENTED TO MAKE A QUICK

ESCAPE AFTER ASSASSINATING THE PRESIDENT.

DEPARTMENT OF STATE

THE DIRECTOR OF INTELLIGENCE AND RESEARCH

WASHINGTON

SECRET

OCT 25 1960

Dear Dick:

Our efforts to answer recent informal inquiries, including some

from the White House Staff, have revealed that,

though CIA and the

FBI have detailed records concerning Americans who have been recruited

as Intelligence agents by Bloc

countries, there does not appear to be

a complete listing of those Americans now living in Bloc çountries

who might be called "defectors".

Using the definitions of DODD 4/2,

these porsons might be described as those who have either been

capable of provicing useful intelligence to the Bloc or those whose

desire to resettle in Bloc countries has been significantly exploited

for communist propaganda purposes.

This would mean that no attention

need be paid to Americans whose resettlement within the Bloc had no

counter-intelligence implications or had attracted no particular

attention; for instance, this definition would not cover individual

US citizens of East European or Chinese origin who returned to the

"homeland" because they had never been completely assimilated into

the American society.

There is attached a list of such persons, covering the last 18

months, and it would be appreciated if the Agency could verify and

possibly expand this list for the use of interested Bureaus of, the

Department.

Sincerely yours,

Hugh S. Cummings JI.

Mr. Papich was advised that the Bureau is working on a matter of any

that there are all kinds of reports coming in

from all kiads of sources - "everybody except tbe North Pole." He felt

that all of us have to keep our feet on the ground. He mentioned that a

The wife is being interrogated. I don't kaow if that took place yesterds

or is still going on. You are getting a teletype answer on that. I am

With regard to that, Nicaraguaa's, allegations that the man was in the

Cuban Enoassy on 18 September, I understand we do have information that

he applied for a tourist card about the 15th of Segtemker. There

1s a

record showing entry into Mexico on Septenber 26. On aboit the 15th he

applied in New Orleans for a tourist caft.

We do know he was 11 -

He was last seen by the landlady

then.

Now we have immigration records showing bin

entering Mexico on the 26th which very strongly suggests that be was not in Mexico

on the l8th. What we are trying to find out is where he was every single day -

the 25th, 24th, and all the way back. I think the Nicaraguan story is fabricated
