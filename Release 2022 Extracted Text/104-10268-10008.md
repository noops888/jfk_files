name Lee OSWALD. It was discussed in Dave Phillips book a a
case of laziness on the part of the Soviet case officer (which i
in wy view was unjust and unnecessary and indicates that Dave i

Mexico Station Coverage of Soviet and Cuban Embassies (1963) |

1. Unilateral Coverage:
From the time the Mexico Station was opened in April 1947 until
the arrival of Mr. Win Scott as Chief of Station in 1955, the Station had

developed a support apparatus to exploit leads from the Soviet Embassy in
Mexico City. This umbrella type project carer of multiline
. Phone taps, three photographic sites, a mobs apet ‘ance team and a |
mail intercept operation.

. SN oe
6 Telephone taps (L AGN sc by an employee of the local H

telephone company wi dfed by a Station case officer. The number
S

of lines tapped wa! ited only by the availability of a listening post
nearby and the availability of langauge (English, Spanish, Soviet, Polish,

. Czech, etc.) transcribers. Generally, these were Mexican or Mexican-

- American recruited agents.

Three photographic sites were handled by a Station case officer

+ assisted by technicians on TDY from Headquarters who advised the Station
on the best types of cameras, films, and concealment devices... These
operations had sub-crypts under project LIPSTICK (namely: LIMITED, LILYRIC
and LICALLA). LIMITED was a fixed site directly opposite the Soviet Em-
bassy (across the street) which’ had both a vehicle and.a pedestrian en-

trance. The gate to the Soviet Embassy was on the northwest corner of the

Soviet compound and the LIMITED site was diagonally across a double laned
street on the southeast corner of that block. (See attached diagram).

LIMITED was the first photo base and operated strictly on an experimental
basis in the early stages. This base, however, was closed when the Sta-

tion received word that the photograph of the “unidentified man" was

being released by the Warren Commission. LILYRIC was an alternate photo-
“graphic base. It was located in an upper story of an apartment building
‘on the same side of the street as the LIMITED site Nd middle of ©

= the block south. It had a Planted view of ae fate of the Soviet :

Embassy. LICALLA, the third ea jas located in one of a

row of four houses on the “ag fe Soviet Embassy compound. i
i
This site overlooked the, len of the Soviet Embassy compound. The

purpose of this oper’ was to get good identification photographs of

Soviet personnel +, The three photographic sites were managed bya re-
cruited agent who was a Mexican citizen, the son of an American mother
and Mexican father (deceased). This agent collected the film from the
LIMITED and LILYRIC sites three times a week. The film was then de-
veloped and printed into 8 x 10 contact print strips. LICALLA film was
originally processed in the Station but in early 1959, due to the resig-
nation of a technician, this film like that of LIMITED and LILYRIC was

processed on the outside by.a recruited agent. a

Mobile surveillance was conducted by two American staff officers.
These two officers organized a surveillance team of six recruited agents
which used Tate model cars and a panel truck for surveillance. The team
could be activated by radio from the LIMITED site whenever. someone of
interest left the gate of the Soviet Embassy. These agents were aware of
the LIMITED site since they had been issued LIMITED photographs for
jdentification purposes.

The Station also conducted a unilateral aN sept operation,

2. Liaison Covera: gh
Liaison cone Se unreliable and insecure as characterized by

the nature of the Mexican services at that time. The Mexican Direction

of Federal Security (DFS), with which we conducted liaison, was a hip-
pocket group run out of the Mexican Ministry of Government. This-Ministry
was principally occupied with political investigations and control of
foreigners. their agents were viele, and corrupt. A Station
officer trained a number of them in name tracing and travel control. In
1958, at the instigation of a Mexican official, a Joint telephone tap

operation came into existence. The operation, which became known as

LIENVOY, was run by a Mexican officer. The listening post had 30 lines
connected at one time. The transcription room was staffed by Mexican

Army officers. In 1961, because of mismanagement by the Mexican prin-
cipals, the Station chief, himself, became the project case officer. A H
Station officer assisted him in the daily supervision of the listening
post, and in picking up the transcripts and the tapes. There was also
an American technician inside the listening post. |

3. Oswald Coverage:
In mid-1962, the Mexican officer in charge of LIENVOY (the . |

Joint tap operation) asked the American officer at x ERY listening
post for the telephone numbers of the Soviet, Cul satellite Em-

bassies in anticipation of possible “arr Station immediately

taps on these Embassies so

that they would not be disc;
taps. The Mexicans aS ter connected five Cuban lines, five
Soviet lines, three Czeth lines, two Polish lines, and one Yugoslav

line. At the listening post, a live monitor made short summaries of

the Mexicans hooked up their

conversations of interest which were then included in a daily resume
for the Chief of Station. Later, when a reel was completely recorded,
full transcripts were typed and passed to the Station; however, there

was usually a time lag of a day or two. Reels which contained Russian.

their activities and recruitirg agents right and left anong Cuban netionals in

Item 295, page 3

At 1626 hours, A Soviet calls from the Soviet Embassy Chancery
to the Cuban Consulate and asks for Sylvia DURAN. He asks

DURAN if the american has been there.

DURAN: Yes, he is still here.

SOVIET: According to the letters that he showed them from the (Soviet)
Consulate in Washington, he wants’ to go to the USSR to stay
a long time with his wife who is Russian, but also the
answer had not been received (by him) regarding his problem.
That accordingly these transactions take 4 or 5 months but
without prior approval from the USSR, they have to request
and even then, they could not issue the visa heze “(in Mexico
City) without asking Washington. Yet accordingly this man
(the American), ~: showed him a letter imWwhich*he~(the
American) is a member of an organizatighinfavor of Cuba
and said that the Cubans could not pive*hint the visa without

the Russian visa and now the ee Macsn's know what to do
with him, because he has rr sre answer from
Washington. a

ith them also, bes roblem with him (the American)

that he doesn. e in Cuba and in that case it

is very diffi ve him a visa, because he was

thinking of sing his visa, because he knew it was

going to take w™iong time waiting for the Russian visa in
Cuba, and then go on to the USSR.

SOVIET: ..that the thing is that if his (the American) wife were

~" now in Washington (and) going to receive the visa right now

or the permission from the USSR to retum to her country, (if)
she is going to receive her visa in Washington, then having
this visa, she can-commmicate to whatever place, this
permission, for example, here or in any other place (he) can
receive it, but right now they do not have them.

DURAN: ..certainly and neither can (the Cubans) give him a letter
because they do not know if the visa will be approved.

SOVIET: They can only give the visa according to instructions.

DURAN: Then that is what she will put on his application.

SOVIET: Neither can I give him any letter of recommendation because
I don't know him and pardon me for bothering you.

DURAN: It was no bother, thank you very much.

‘An unidentified man (speaking Spanish) calls the Soviet Enbassy
Consulate at 1037 hours and asks for the Consul. He is told that
the Consul is not there. The unidentified man asked what is needed
to get visas to go to Odessa. He is told to call back at 1130 hours.

Item 137, page 2

At 1235 hours 4 man named ALATRISTE (not a Soviet) from inside the
Soviet Embassy Consulate calls out to number 45-37-72 (Colonial
America, probably a pension or hotel but number not listed in the
telephone directory) and speaks with a man named SAN ROMAN.
ALATRISTE says that he is in the Russian Enbassy and they need to
Imow what day the boat "KALONIA" will arrive in Odessa, that the
Soviets will also need copies of the passenger manifest...

(One concludes that ALATRISTE and SAN ROMAN are shipping-tepresentatives
for the boat '"KALONIA", and needed routine visa infomation. First

a call was made to the first listing for the Soyiet. Embassy in the
Mexican telephone directory (which turned out=to ‘be the Military Attache).
They got the phone number for the Consulate andthe address. After
making a call to the Consulate and that it would not be open
until 1130 hours, ALATRISTE went. t@>théiaddress to get the needed
information.) 7

Just after 1600 hours, 4 Soviet Consulate received a call from the
Cuban Consulate (Sylvia DURAN) who said she had there a U.S. citizen
who had requested a transit visa to Cuba because he is going to the
USSR. DURAN wants to know with whom he spoke at the Soviet Embassy
because she sent him over to them telling him that if the Soviets
approved the visa then the Cubans would give him one without anything
more, advising the (Department of) Immigration in Cuba.' She wants

to know with whom he spoke because he says that he doesn't know
either with what person and who told him that certainly there would
be no problem.. The Soviet asks DURAN to wait a minute. After a
short wait DURAN explains the same thing to another Soviet. This
Soviet tells her to leave her telephone (number) and her name and
someone will return the call. DURAN gives her name and telephone
number 11-28-47 then says as a personal thing, she has moved and

has not advised them of a change of address so will not receive their
Bulletin and can give it to them now. The Soviet asks her to call
KOUKHARENKO in order to change that address and asks for the name

of the (Cuban) Cultural Attache. DURAN says it is Teresa PROENZA
whose number is 14-13-26. The Soviet thanks her.
