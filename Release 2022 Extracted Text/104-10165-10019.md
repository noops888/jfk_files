10 May 1965
MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD :
SUBJECT: Rogelio CISNEROS
1. Subject was called at his Miami home on 7 May 1965, ;

by the undersigned using the alias Albert Antonelli.
CISNEROS had attempted to contact his former case officer, : r
Alfonso Rodriguez, the day before, but failed.

2. Briefly, for the readers not familiar with bis
name, Rogelio CISNEROS was a forrer leader in the Junta
Revolucionaria (JURE), organized and directed by Manuel
RAY Rivero, In September 1964, in difference to RAY's
leadership and organizational qualities, CISNEROS resigned
from the JURE. i

3. In an effort to keep him out of our hair, as he's
been on “UBARK's payroll since 1960, we proposed “that he a
prepare a study on the Cuban secondary education systen- :
before and after Fidel Castro. Ail arrangement for payment i
were made through a third party. He was paid a sum of :
$1200 for eight-typewritten pages - double spaced, a
project any non-Cuban could have written in less time
and expense.

4. In November 1964 CISNEROS asked for an additional

$650 for the study so that he could enroll at the :
University of Michigan's intensive zaglish language course. : i

He was denied the additional sum, but went to the University

arfway. He began the course in January 1965. : :

5. CISNEROS has now completed the course and has
returned to his home and family in Miami, He feels that
with this new ability to speak and understand English,
he is better equipped to continue the anti-Castro effort.

6. CISNEROS stated that while at the University he
became acquainted with some young Dominicans and reportedly
he developed a good rapport with the men. He wondered out
loud if any use could be made of the friendship in view of
the activities in Santo Domingo. The undersigned listened
attentively, but made no effort to edvce further information

on this subject.

7. CISNEROS, as a recent "graduate", is interested in
a job and implied that he would like to work for KUBARK.
The undersipned indicated to him that jobs vere scarce. but
that his interest in employment will be passed along to
“my superiors". The undersigned closed the conversation by
promising that. he would call during the week of 10 May and
convey any message received from “upstairs".

8. RECOMMENDATION: Unless the readers feel there may be
some value to CISNEROS' Dominican contacts, this writer opines
that we should not get involved with CISNEROS again,and that
he should be told there is no work available for him at the
present, but should something open-up in the future we will
certainly keep him in mind, Reason: After bis resignation
in September 1964 CISNEROS wanted Al Burt, Miami Herald
reporter; to do a news story on RAY pointing up the following

facts:

a. That RAY was a tool of the U. S. State oe
Department and received $25,000 per month from the :
U.S. Government. | (CISNEROS reportedly said that he :
could dougment all facets of RAY's funding.) i

b. That RAY knows his failure to infiltrate ‘
Cuba embarrassed his State Department friends, but i
State will continue to back him as their betrayed
revolution thesis can be tied only to RAY's star i
and as this theme has been sold to the United
States Government at policy levels, despite the
objection of KUBARK, State has no alternative but to

back RAY,
CISNEROS did not go through with this plan, but he will always’
use this as a peg to blackmail. We have no obligation to i

place CISNEROS on the KUBARK payrolls, either directly or
indirectly. He is undoubtedly witting of KUBARK's financial
role in RAY's aborted attempts to infiltrate Cuba, but
payments to RAY are untraceable, It is doubtfulY that an



ig "SECRET

+
: expose on t*< RUPANE,/RAY relationship would enlighten anyone,

as many reporters have speculated that RAY was being assisted
by KUBARK or som “other agency of the United States Government.

i 9. Should it be warranted, this writer is willing to
¥ debrief CISNEROS further on his Dominican friends.
