1. On 3 January 1963 Quinton N. OUSLER tumed-over the
responsibilities of inside Station control of the LIMDTOR Project
to Marvin A. CASOT during @ meeting held with the outside Staff
Agent for the LIMOIOR Project, Seyrour D. TRONICR, What folios
is the first in a series of Progress Feports which it is hoped
vdll not only serve to keep Headquarters advised of just what
is foing on in the LIMOTOR Project but will also serve to apprise
Neadquarters in preater detail of the performance of the LIMOTOR
Staff Agent on the outside under student cover. During the
period under review TRINNICH's replacement, Natalie S, MICHOFP
arrived to take over the outside responsibilities for LIMOTOR,
In the future repular Prorress Reports on LIFOTOR will be
submitted on a quarterly basis,

predetermined tire and ultimately picks—up TRINNICH in his QP
vehicle. ‘These meetings are then held in CAR0Ts car, Tho

3. AS can be sean fron the number of meetings held in a
seven Ponth period, they were wsually held once a week, TRINNICH's
mectings with the other LIADTOR assets were so arrengad to allow
for a sinicum passage of tire between the field asents seetings
and tha meting with CAST. The TRINNICH-CADO? seetines usually
last, on the averam, txo fours. Speeifie remitrozents wre
passed ond administrative matters were ettended to. Usi
TRIRMICH reviewed with CABJT each report received from the LIMOTOR
agente end irsediste guidance is civin where possitie, Since
these seetings were THUMIICH's only contact with the Station,
deliberate efforts were ends to keop him abreast of general
Station develoreznts as well as KORARK develoresnts, ‘This has
provon to be a distinct advantage from the stendroint of the
Otaide Staffor's morale, ming him fcel much core part of the
Station and what it is trying to accomplish,

‘TRINNICH beran preparetion of contact reports uith each of his
agents. In turn LINOICA-14 was instructed to prepare a short
Feport an each of his meetings with LIEBNOIL-2.

OPERATIONAL

Se Since Jarmary 1963, the Station ms atterpted, throush
its regular contact with Seymor D,. THINCCH, to pain fcther
insigtt into Just what poes on at the UNAM uhich is of Interest
to the Station, and at the same tire to exvene the LIMOTOR
assets and their cxpabilities in ters of the UM. The LIPCIOR
project is, as stated in tte Project Renewal, an important
Station “eyes and ears® mechanism at tho VIAN, Eased a a look
at LIMCIGA for the period under review the Station mtes the
following: :

& Wile the Froject 1s producing it tas received
little in the wy of mildence from the Station or Head-
quarters on infcymation which it should collect. A re-
exavination of sceess was also necessary.

db. There ws ; insuffloient ecortination with Station
WUCADE, ectivities at the uM,

@. While it did prodmoc, little of the product ws
emaidered of value for forcal disserinition.

4. Thsre ws little or no play-teck into the LIVOTOR
Project. Tist te to say that utile the Project itself,
primarily in tho person of TRINOUCH displayed initiative
ond gonsreted activity, it often ended just at that paint.
This contriisted to low wrale, particularly as it emoermed



CONTINUATION OF
CISPATCH

6. && the becinning of the period under review, the LIMCTOR
stable consioted of the following asseter

LIPCTOR-14 (who maintained contact with LIAROIL-?
and LIKAYAY-63 the letter served as a
ecntact to LINMMROII.'s 3 and 8)
LIMOTOR-19

LINcTOr-22

At an early stage in the THINNICI-CAMOT relationship, te.
the 28 Jenury moctinz, steps were initiated via Lacror-if to
.Sccosplish the termination of LIXATAK-6 end LIEYANOIL's 3 and
3 for lack of protuction, This ves finally ccppleted affective
the end of March 1963, Althourh @ tid for dre or teruination
pay was rede, it ens refected. in orver to provide LIFAYAK-6
with a ewans of ecntact tould acrothineg of ieportence develop
in the future, LU-OTOP-14 was instructed to acquire a Post
Office Box, which he did, It sas taren out in the alias wed
by LIPOPOR-18 with CIKAYAK-G (Pedro MORAN) and also the alias
woed by LINIOR-218 sith LIDGAOIL-2 ("uro de le Torre) as an
exergoncy ceans of contact (using a telerram).

7. Asa matter of operational teckzroundé, Seysour D. TRIICH
was Wow to LDUTOR's 1%, 19, and 22 under his true ners, They
also new his how telephone meter which wes used for comantestions
free thes to him, LIMOTOR-1% wao unaware of the extatence of
LIPOICR's 19 and 22. He knew OJSLER under hts true nicimare,
Although LIHOPCR's 19 anJ 22 new each other sli¢ntly socially,
they were unnare of each cthors clandestine relationship with
TRINNICH, LIMOICFA19 knew Paineas F. SLINSAMD through their
@lese cooperation on the BECIOCK/EKWVE operation (under true
mame). LIMOIOR15 also knew OUSLER under true first nam,

ry With parecraph 7 in mind, there Yellow a brief reeme
Of each of the LIMOTOR agents:

A. LIBYSACIL-2. For the eurrent period this arent
has teen a ley writer for oe of the leading UUAK
Rewepapera, Nevoluciomrio, He is well-versed in WAY

interest to us, particularly tecmise tte latter was considered
ane of the tirsst at UNAM tut because it was aleo financed
