1. Time-Place-Purnose

AMHIP/I was wet on 2S April in New York City for the purpose

on his recent trip to Europe. The undersigned wet AMIlIP/l at his

2. Details of the meeting

A majority of the items covered during the meeting have been

the subject of previous cables from the field. However, for

greater clarity, a number of these were reviewed with A'MIP/1 and

additional information and comments obtained.

a. Cuban Government efforts to obtain foreign exchange

through the Florida lotteries.

(1) ANNHIP/I stated that he had been approached in

Madrid by Rafael Garcia-Bonge Dirube (see @adrid)31SG-IN 24295)

and related traffic) who anted him to act as a contact tan with

Santos Trafficante who is presently living In Miami. According

to GB, he had been told by(UNSNAFU/19 (U/19). that DsE Chief

Pineiro had. okayed the following operation involving the Cuban

lotteries played illegally in Florida. The Cuban Governient was

prepared to give throughcho three winning numbers per week for

Trafficante to use in profiting on the Cuban lotteries played: in

Florida Trafficante was to pay $50,000 upon receipt of the numbers

rrow(u/i9 and an additional $50,000 after the win. This money,

which would have been a free source of income to the Cuban Government,

would then be either banked in Europe byCU/19 on behalf of the.

Cuban Government or sent to llavana according to instructions he

received. GB had found out that AMHIP/l knew Trafficante in

Miami and, had contacted him to act as a messenger to Trafficante.

AMWIIP/1 was also offered, but declined, sum of money for his

participation in this operation. As a matter of interest this

ploy for illegal winning from the lottery was

first conceived in

1959 by GB and Trafficante but it did not materialize as Pineiro

and

perhaps other govt officials would not play ball at that time.

It is interesting to note that, for the price of $100,000 a week

in foreign exchange, the Cubal Government is now willing to enter

into a conspiracy of this level with well-known gangster elements.

other people in the Florida

area who will probably be affected by

this action are Amlato Batisti (former

owner

of the Seville

Bilture Hotel in Havana) and one. FNU Santos

Accoring to AMpyl, Jampa is the center for this activity.

AMlIpl stated that if we manted to take any action in this

matter, it would have to be done soon as GB would expect hia to

react regarding the contact with Trufficante in the very near future.

Estreme caution should be used in any action in this fleld as any

leak might readily finger to AIWHIP/1. It is interesting to note

that in an interview

with a Madrid Station officer (cited Para 5.

(Madria) 1396), GiB stated that he hud turned down a DSE request to

work for them overseas.

He had however offered to become involved

in Illegal business deal& abroad on behalf of DSE. He never received

a reply to this offer. It is also noted that, according to ANTIP/?,

(/19 is not witting that he (ASWHIP/1) has this opportunity tò

act us a go-between with GB and Trafficante on this matter.

b. Luis Blanca Fernandez, Vice Ninister of Communicationg.

(1) In response to the question Alp/l stated that he

knew Blanca slightly but had no significant assessment to give on

the man. He did know that he was an old DR member and that the

best sources of information on him would be AMLASH/1, /2 and /3.

c. ANNIP/

(1) In discussing the general situation in Madrid and

Europe, A'MHIP/l again deplored the use by kUBARk of ANNIP/l

in operations against the Castro Cubans. He stated that he didn't

know him personally but that many people had told him that A'NIP/1

was no good and a person in whom one could have obsolutely no

confidence.

He cited for an example how ANNIP/l had told the

mother of Diaz-Argueles that he had been

he had noticed was advertising trips to cuba. AMMEP/l had

upon with his leadquarters case officer. His itinerary was as

follows: New York to Paris, Madrid, Paris, Rome, Milan, Madrid,

Miami.

B. Jorge Modull Rivas, Vice Minister for Foreign Commerce

(1) AMWHIP/l stated that Jorge MEDAN has a brother now

Ilving in Miami, Ricardo MEDAN Rivas, who would be an excellent

entre to the former. ANIlP/l reported on Ricardo in @aris) 0190

(IN 35169). ANWHIP/I stated that Ricardo was a trustworthy man

tho

knows ANCRUMB/1 well, plus a great many people who are still

In the Cuban Government today. (Writer's note:

in (paris) 0253 (IN 37116). AWHIP/1 repeated his feelings as

basically reported In the aforementioned cable. He stated that

CUNENAFt/19 in discussing the incident actually was very fair to

CUNSNATU/s and bed stated that he was trily sorry to have had to

dismiss (SMFT/9. He said however that sisNAFU/s's pugilistio

attitude and threats to higself as Cuban Ambassador to France

could simply not be tolerated. He stated that had this Mare-up

by (UNSNAFT/S taken place in Havana, then it might häve been

dealt with as a man-to-man matter rather than as an employer-

to-employee matter. He also said that he hated to firéCUNSNAFU/9

due to the latter's friendship with AlIP/l and AMWHIP/1. As a

result ofCibFU/g's being fired, his wife also lost her job with

the Cuban representation to UNESCO in Paris. She has since

however found another job in UNESCO working for the delegation of

another country.

i. (ia's recent trip to lavana

(1) Because of the interest in the "coincidental"

02

trip to Harana of both UNFU/ 19 and ANCASH/3 shortly after

having receired the "planted" information of the MISPAWN operation,

we queried LWHIP/1 regarding(W/1p's trip. A'MIP/I stated that,

to the best of his knowledge, (V/19 went home because of the

precarious condition of his mother's health. Uple was called by

Foreign Minister Roa in Yadrid and advised that he should return.

Cuyl9 carried certain medicines with him for his mother. AMlIP/s

did not know the nature of the mother's illness, but apparently it

came on rather suddenly (if possible, the medical history of U/19's

mother should be traced). WilliP/l stated that WASH/?,

Garcia-Banga, and Gallerreta all confirued(U/19's mother's

illness. Carrillos left for Havanu on about the 29th of March.

J. for the record ANNHlP/1, in discussing the CUNSNAFU/9-

CUNsNArU/19 affair, stated that only(uf19 and his family and the

code clerk (Clavista) and his family now are living in the Embassy

building itself. The living quarters for a number of the other

Cuban mission employees are now looated in the Consular. (Check

this)

K. AMLASH 3 returned to Havana

(1) "Cucu DeLeon told A'WHIP/I three or four days ago

in Miami that AMLASI/3 had called from Madrid very recently and

stated that he was going to return to lavana. .L'SHIP/1 had no.

other details on AMLASH/3's return or shether in fact he had

actually done so.

1. AMIASH/2

(1) AMHIP/I stated that AMLASHl/2 and 3 were indeed

disillusioned with the Americans to date. AMLASH,3 still believed

that it had been through the office of the American Government

that he had been refused a visa to the Dominican Republic. (It

will be recalled that AMLASHl/3 had complained of this before to

AMNHIP/1, and AMHIP/I had been instructed to suggest to AMLASH/3

that it was his own known employment by the Government of Cuba in

a legitimate capacity which was

probably reason enough in itself

for

the Dominican Government to refuse him a visa.) ANMIIP/1

stated that he had used this argument with A'ISH'3, but that

AMLASI,3 remained convinced that there ras more behind the refusal

than this.

AMLASH/3 stated, in

discussing his dissatisfaction with

## Page 7

14-00000

the Americans, that he was generally displeased because Americans

would use people like A'NIP/I and then did not wish to talk to,

let alone deal with, people like himself and AYLASH/2. He did

not probe into the discussions in Madrid between AIWHIP/1, AMLASH/2, /3,

and @USPORT. AMHIP/l did say that there was no point in trying

to argue with these people at that time, or to defend the possible

American positions vis-a-vis them, because they were in fact so

convinced in their own minds that there rould be little use at

that time in trying to change their viers (this point at a

subsequent fuller review of these discussions should be conducted

in Spanish by Swenson at an appropriate

time in the near future).!

m. MISPAIN Queration

(1) 117IP/l did not have much additional information

to contribute concerning his MISPANN talks with /19 bejond that

reported in Paris)0355 (IN 41111), He did say, however, that he

had actually given the name and address of Mr. Collado to

Carrillos

who included this in his cable about the matter directly

to Celio Sanchez

to Havana. AWHIP/l stated that he digressed

slightly from the story as given him in the hriefing because he

felt that if he pin-pointed fidel as the one leader who must go,

CP/19 would possibly then not have taken such quick action on the

matter, and in fact, may not have

reported it at all. AwhiP/l

relt that Carrillos undoubtedly will discuss

the MISPAWN information

on his current trip

to Harina. 117H1P,/1, is stated in above

rible, side done he offered to try to ese more information from

Mr. Callado ill/ly so desired. Cold stated that he would await

comment from lina. before decinding on any further notion. AMliP/l

that he was willing to go further with this operation if so

desired by KÜBARK. Caution!

orCUY 19.

to travel to Havana on ? May with a french theatrical group in

order to examine additional paintings, gews, and other loot taken

from Cuban refugees and now offered for sale by the Cuban Government

to ubtain sorely needed foreign exchange, ASlIP/I stated that he

would need an

-swer on this natter fairly soon. (It will be noted

that we told (Paris in DIR 90721 that there was interest in this

offer and that we were secking a suitable candidate). Since

Headquarters has not had a suitable candidate for this trip and

did not have prospects of developing one who could make the trip

securely, we asked AMlIP/l if he had someone in mind who could

make the trip. AMMIlf/l stated that he thought an "experienced"

person of our choosing would be able to get more useful information

for us.

He stated that perhaps it rould be best not to involve

an agent witting of AMliP/l's true relationship with kuBARk in

the event that the agent was arrested and forced to talk. We told

1W111P/1 that as a safer, but obriously less desirable, alternative

we might have an unwitting person go in, because much of the

information that he rould normally get as a result of a legitimate

business interest in the loot will be in fact of use to lillalk.

and we were willing to forego i maximum "take" for the trip in the

interest of scrurity.

Alle/l then said, "In that case. pertips.

no business partuer in Milan, Oreste Corletto, would be willing

to wile the trip for me." ANIll/l did not have details on

Corletto at his fingertips but said that he would either send

•. shes or telephone them to "Harry Wills" the follfoing days.

2WHIP/I stated however that Corletto, who is about it years old

and born in Milan, is very pro-American and defends the American

position in the world at the drop. of a hat with anyone who takes

issue. AWHIP/l stated that Corletto had just returned from a

pleasure trip to Moscow and that if anything, was even more pro-

Nest and pro-American after this experience. (Follow up soonest)

0. (UNSANFT/19 Gas-Light Club Membership

(1) It has suggested previously that 190HIP/1 buy

5Z

GDStAFT/19 a membership in the Paris Gas-Light Club as a gesture

of friendship and good will. GiNFUlD, according to AwlIp/s,

enjoys the Gas-Light Club and its attractively dressed (or

undressed, as the case may be) hostesses. It is noted for the

record that lester Sanchez Originally had had the idea that it

In other words, the Cubans in the interest of economy are prepared

to saerifice a degrce of security. AMHIP/I stated that if ve

had a girl who could handle this assignuent, he would be willing to

propose her employment to (vûbtFt/19. (This me should follow up

soonest).

This lead also was received by cable according to

(arry Webster) subsequent to the undersigned's leaving WH/Cuba.

3. Security

There were no instances of a security nature to be reported.

However, it is the recommendation of the undersigned that the

ror case officer/s conduct their weetings with ASHIP/l away from

his office as much as possible. There was no reason to believe

that any of AMMlIP/l's employees have overheard any conversations

in the past, but they probably are vell aware that the undersigned

is not always calling on AMMIIP/l to discuss strictly commercial

matters. Since there may be a change in the complexion of the

AMIASH/1 operation and an increased operational use of AiIIP/1

in Europe, it would be well to vary the pattern of meetings with

1MH1P/1. There

is probably no danger in calling on him at his

office occasionally, but prolonged conversations and too frequent

meetings with the new case officer on the premises should be

avoided.
