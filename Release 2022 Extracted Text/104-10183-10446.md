2, Details of the meeting

A majority of the items covered during the meeting have been

the subject of previous cables from the field. However, for

greater clarity, a number of these were reviewed with AMWHIP/1 and

additional information and comments obtained. =

a. Cuban Government efforts to obtain foreign exchange

ida lotteries.

Madrid by Rafael Garcia-Bonge Dirube (see Giadrid B486-1N 24295)

and related traffic) ‘who wanted hia to act as a contact wi

cante who is presently living in Miami. According

Santos
to GB, he had been ‘told py(UNSNAFU/19 ys} that DSE Chief
Pineiro had. okayed ‘the folowing operation involving the Cuban

lotteries played illegally in Florida. The Cuban Govérnivont.#as
prepared to give throught three winning nuabers hi week for
Trafticante to use 4s -prefittag onthe Cuban lotteries played: in
Florida, Trafficante was to pay $50, 000 upon receipt of the numbers
sroa(a7i9 and an additional $50,000 after the win. This money,
which would have been a free source ‘of income to the Cuban Governuent,

would then be either banked in Europe vy@yi9 on behalf of the,
Cuban Government or sent to Havana according to instructions he
received. GB had found out that AMVHIP/1 knew Trafficante in
Miami and, had contacted him to act as a messenger to Trafficante.
AMVIIIP/1 was also offered, but declined, sum of money for his
participation in this operation. Asa matter of interest this
ploy for illegal winning from the lottery was first conceived in
1959 by GB and Trafficante but it did not materialize as Pineiro
und perhaps other govt officials would not play ball at that time,
It is interesting to note that, for the price of $100,000 a week
in foreign exchange, the Cuban Government is now willing to enter
into a conspiracy of this level with well-known gangster elements.
Other people in the Florida area who will probably be affected by
this action are Amlato Batisti (former owner of the Sevil}e
Biltwmre Hotel in Havana) and one, FNU Santos both of whom are also

involved as king pins in the lottery racket, in Florida.

Accoring to AMMEPY4, Tapa is the center for this activity:
AMMIIIP/1L stated that if we wanted to take any action in this

matter, it would have to be done soon as GB would expect hia to fae,
react regarding the contact with Trafficante in the very near future.
Extreme caution should be used in any action in this’ field “as any
leuk might readily finger to ANITILE/1. it is interesting to note
hares in an interview with a Gers ‘Seation officer (cited Para 5-
Giadrid) 4386), GB stated that he had turned down a DSE request to
work for them overseas. He had however offered to become involved

jm illegal business deals abread.on behalf of DSE. He never, received
a reply to this offer. It is also noted that, aceording to AMMHIP/1,

Cis is not witting that he (AMWHIP/1) has this opportunity to :
act as a go-between with GB and Trafficante on this matter.

b. Luis Blanca Fernandez, Vice Minister of Communications.

(1) In response to the question AMWIIP/1 stated that he
knew Blanca slightly but had no significant assessment to give on

the man, Ie did know that he was an old DR member and that the

best sources of information on him would be AMLASH/1, /2 and /3,
ec. AMNIP/L :

(1) In discussing the general situation in Madrid and
Europe, AMWHIP/1 again deplored the use by KUBARK of AMNIP/21
in operations against the Castro Cubans, He stated that he didn't
know him personally but that many people had told him that AMNIP/I
was no good and a person in whom one could have obsolutely no
confidence. He cited for an example how AMNIP/1 had told the
mother of Diaz-Argueles that he had been sent from AMLASH/3, a

(2) AMMHIP/1 mentioned this ‘man may in fact have a

brother, Enrique ZAYAS Bazan, who is syupathetico ant
working at the parking lot at the Miami Adrport. He had found
nothing to add on this lead other than that provided in _

f. AMMIITP/1' 5 itinerary in Europe.

(1) For the record, AMWIIP/1 varied his itinerary
during his last trip in Europe to some degree from that agreed
upon with his Headquarters case officer. His {tinerary was as

follows: New York to Paris, Madrid, Paris, Rome, Milan, Madrid,

Miami.

who knows AMCRUMB/1 well, plus a great many people who are still

in the Cuban Government today. (Writer's note: This lead should

in (Paria) 0253 (IN 37416). AMWHIP/1 repeated his feelings as

basically reported: if the aforcuentiotied cable. He stated that |
Colbsare/r0 in Aiscussing the incident actually was very fair to
Gaistart/s aad. had -stated-that bp was trifly sary to have had to
dtemtss(OQNare/9. He said however that G:RSNAFU/9's pugilistic
attitude and threats to hiuself as Cuban Ambassador to France
could simply not be tolerated. He stated that had this flare-up
by (sikinrv/s taken plave in Havana, then it wight have been
dealt with as a man-to-man matter rather than as an ie a fl
to-employee matter. He also said that he hated to eureCudsaaru/9
due to the latter's friendship with AMNIP/1 and AMWIIP/1, As a
result or@yekiru/o's being fired, his wife also lost her job with
the Cuban representation to UNESCO in Paris. She has since
however found another job in UNESCO working for the delegation of
another country.
i. es 19's recent trip to Havana 7
(1) Because of the interest in the "coincidental"
trip to Havana of poth @Skaru/19 and AMCASH/3 shortly after
having received the "planted" information of the MISPAWN operation,
we queried AMWIIP/1 regarding( 19's trip. AMWHIP/1 stated that,
to the best of his knowledge, Givi went home because of the
precarious condition of his mother's health. (pio was called by
Foreign Minister Roa in Madrid and advised that he should return.
cyio carried certain medicines with nim for his mother. AMWILIP/1
did not know the nature of the mother's illness, but apparently it

came on rather suddenly (if possible, the medical history of(UY19's

SEG


mother should be traced). AMNIIP/1 stated wet AMLASH/2,
3
Garcia-Bunga, and Gallerreta all confirmed(UY19"s mother's

illine: Carrillos left for Havana on about the 29th of March.

“Jz + for the record ANWIIP/1, in discussing the (UNSKAFU/9-
Gsnaru/19 affair, stated that only(iyi9 and his family and the

code clerk (Clavista) and his family now are living in the Embassy
building itself. The living quarters for a number of the other __

Cuban mission employees are now located in the Consular, (Check

Kk. AMLASH/3 returned to Havana

(1) "Cucu DeLeon told AMWHIP/1 three or four days ago

in Miami that AMLASH/3 had called from Madrid very recently and
stated that he was going to return to Havana. A‘MHIP/} had no.

other details on AMLASH/3's return or whether in fact he had

actually done so.

1. AMLASH/2

(1) AMWHIP/1 stated that AMLASH/2 and 3 were indeed
disillusioned with the Americans to date. AMLASH/3 still believed
that it had been through the office of the-Awerican Government
that he had been refused a visa to the Dominican Republic. (It
will be recalled that AMLASH/3 had complained of this before to
AMVHIP/1, and AMWHIP/1 had Ueen instructed to suggest to AMLASH/3
that. it was his own known employment by the Government of Cuba in

a legitimate capacity which was probably reason enough in itself
)  AMMHIP/1

for the Dominican Governuent to refuse him a vi

the Americans, that he was generally displeased because Americans |

would use people like AMNIP/1 and then did not wish to talk to,
let alone deal with, people like himself and AMLASH/2. He did
not ee into the discussions in Madrid between AMWHIP/1, AMLASH/2, EX
and Q@ipront/1. AMNHIP/1 did say that there was no point in trying”

to argue with these people at that tine, or to defend the possible
American positions vis-a-vis them, because they were in fact so,
convinced in their own minds that there would be little use at

that time in trying to change their views (this poiat at a

subsequent fuller review of these discussions should be conducted;

in Spanish by Swenson at an appropriate time in the near future).'
a. MISPAWN Operation
(1) AMWuP/1 did not have much addi tonal information
to contribute concerning his MISPAWN talks witn@yio beyond that
reported in Paris>oass (IN 41111), He did say, however, that he
had actually given the name and address of Mr.-(Collado to :
Carrillos who included this in his cable about the matter directly
to Celio Sanchez to Havana. AMWHIP/1 stated that he digressed
slightly from the story as given him in the briefing because he
felt that if he pin-pointed Fidel as the one leader who must go,
GiYt9 would possibly then not have taken such quick action on the
matter, and in fact, may not have reported it at all. AMWIIP/L
felt that Carrillos undoubtedly will discuss the MISPAWN information
on his current trip to Havana, AMWIIP/1, as stated in above
edible, said that he

(1) Regarding(Uy19's offer for AMMHIP/1 or AMWHIP/2

to travel to Havana on 7 May with a french theatrical group in
order to examine: additional paintings, gems, and other loot taken
from Cuban refugees and now offered for sale by the Cuban Governuent
to obtain sorely needed foreign exchange, AMMIIP/1 stated that he
would need an answer on this matter fairly soon. (It will be noted
that we told(Paris) in DIR 99724 that there was interest in this
offer and that we were secking a suitable candidate). Since
Headquarters has not had a suitable candidate for this trip and
did not have prospects of developing one who could make the trip
securely, we asked AMMHIP/1 if he had someone in mind who could
make the trip. AMWIIP/1 stated that he thought an “experienced”
person of our choosing would be able to get more useful information
for us. We stated that perhaps it would be best not to involve
an agent witting of AMWIIP/1's true relationship with KUBARK in
the event that the agent was arrested and forced to talk. We told
AMVHIP/1 that as a safer, but obviously less desirable, alternative

we might have an unwitting person go in, because much of the

information that he would normality get as a result of a legitimate
BARK ,

business interest in the loot will be in fact of use to

and we were willing to forego :

interest of security, AMMIIP/L then said, "In that case, perhaps

wy business partner in Milan, Oreste Corletto, would be willing
to wake the trip for me." AMWITP/1 did not have details on
Corletto at his fingertips but said that he would either send
thea or teléphone them to “Harry Wills" the follWoing days.
AMWHIP/1 stated however that Corletto, who is about 44 years old
arid born in-Milan, is very pro-American and defends the American
position in the world at the drop of a hat with-anyone who takes
issue. AMWHIP/1 stated that Corletto had just returned from a
pleasure trip to Moscow and that if anything, was even more pro
West and pro-American after this experience. (Follow up soonest)

In other words, the Cubans in the interest of economy are prepared
to saerifice a degrce of security. AMWHIP/] stated that if we
had a girl who could handle this Assignment, he would be willing to
propose her employment to(vdiarc/re. (This we should follow up
soonest). This lead also was received by cable according to
(larry Wetster> subsequent to the undersigned’s leaving WH/Cuba.
3. Security

There were no instances of a security nature to be reported.
However, it is the recommendation of the undersigned that the
me case officer/s conduct their meetings with AMWIIP/1 away from
his office as much as possible. There was nu reason to believe
that any of AMWIIP/1's employees have overheard any conversations
in the past, but they probably are well aware that the undersigned
is not always calling on AMMIIP/1 to discuss strictly commercial
matters, Sinee there may be a change in the complexion of the
AMLASH/1 operation and an increased operational use of AMWHIP/L
in Europe, it would be well to vary the pattern of meetings with
AMVIIP/L, There is probably no danger in calling on him at his
office occasionally, but prolonged conversations and too frequent

meetings with the new case officer on the premises should be

avoided,
