"Source advised that on 6/9/61, a sales conference was held

at Beacon Press in Boston, Mass., by Edward Darling.

At the sales

meeting, darling stated that they were going to publish a book on Cuba,

by Waldo Frank.

Source stated he then questioned Darling as to whether

or not the book was pro-Castro. Darling stated it was slightly

ro-castro, but it went much deeper than that. Source said an argument

ensued as

to whether or not the book should be published and although

the majority of the sales force was opposed to publishing the book,

Darling was going to go through with the publication.

Source stated he then, through various publishing firms in

NYC, determined that the book had been turned down by Carleton Beals,

who

had returned the book to Frank without even reading it, with the

statement that he would not even read paid propaganda no less publish it

Beals advised Source he should see Richard Gibson and Lyle

Stewart, both of whom could collaborate that Raul Roa had made a grant

of $7,000 to Frank to go to Cuba to write the book.

Source advised he sought out Gibson, the secretary of the

FPCC, who testified before a Congressional Committee and when asked

the color of his politics stated it was the same as the color of his

skin, black. Gibson told Source to avoid Frank and not to have anythin

to do with Frank's book, as it had been bought and paid for by Castro

Source advised that when he contacted Stewart, Stewart

confirmed the fact that he told Gibson to stay away from the book,

and

crank, because Raul Roa had purchased frank, and the book was nothing

but propaganda paid for by Castro X (U)

Carrico advised that the source of the information was

Felix Morrow, a personal friend, who had attended the American Book

Seller's Convention in Washington, D.C. and who contacted Carrico for

the purpose off seeking assistance in keeping the book from being

Richard Gibson of NYC. A(U)

This meeting, according to the informant, was

conducted

in an informal manner and consisted mainly of a discussion led by

Gibson, who pointed out it was his belief that although the FPCC was

rather

unpopular with the public at that time, things were getting

better, especially since the aborted invasion

of Cuba. Gibson stated

people were beginning to realize that charges made by the FPCC that the

CIA and the US Government were involved in the invasion were

true.

that on 1/27/62 Richard Gibson,

Acting National Executive Secretary of the FPCC, had stated that "a

couple of days ago" there had been an article in the "NY Times"

stating that Robert Taber, National Executive Secretary of the FPCC,

was planning to return to

the US from Cuba. Gibson, according to the

informant,

stated that Taber was very homesick. He further stated

that should Taber return to the US, undoubtedly (Senator) Lastland

would

subpoena him to testify before his Senate Committee almost

immediately.

Informant said that Gibson was of the opinion that if Taber

came back to the US, he,

Gibson, would be "off the hook" for all FFCC

activities, even those which took place while Taber was in Cuba.

Gibson's reasoning was that Taber would be responsible for the

would bette

consequences of any FPCC activities because he held a higher office

in the organization than Gibson. & (U)

Informant advised that Gibson had also stated that Taber's

wife and others advised against such a return

by Taber but Taber felt

that he could return to the US quietly. Xf(U)
