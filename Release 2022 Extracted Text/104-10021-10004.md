ANNEX 2

CUBAN IN DALLAS TEXAS, U:S.A....

MIGUEL CASAS SAEZ,

22 or 23 years of age,

Cuba,

• son of Joaquin CASAS (Alias) "Quintello"

don in Ren tamily as called,

by everyone "Los Quintellos") and of Georgina SAEZ Lopez,

known as "la

With thy l, vet the sald cate hume do he le dario have his

background before the revolution, maybe because he was so young, but

after it, he became an ardent revolutionary, follower of Raul castro.

He went through the Department of Constructions of, the Ministry oI

Later he was transferred to the State Security Department (G-2), which

was no secret to anyone because of the way he behaved.

From time to

time he was gone from the city of Remedios, a thing that didn't amaze

of bothered anyone because of the quality of the person.

His aunt, Lucia LOPEZ MARRIED TO MR. WILFREDO RUISSCH, a former

shoemaker in Camajuani, head-town of the municipality next to Remedios;

this couple live on the Andres Cuevas St. #54 at the mentioned tow

of Camajuani, L.V. Now this Ruissch is in charge of the Trust of Leathe

which takes care of the distribution of Unit #402 of the Shoemaker$ o1

Camajaani; she (Lucia Lopez), upon a visit to the dentist, whom I have

known for many years as a responsible and serious person,

she expressed

herself in the following manner:-=--=-=-

"My nephew "Miguelito"

Tave chroen the front to garado ready very he an ee.

he was in Dallas

brought him to Cuba

she continued to say.

"you know that he is one

of Raul's men (refexing to Raul Castro); Miguelito is very brave,

very brave!"

The informant,

complexion, dark brown hair, brown eyes, crazy about

says he knows the so caller

He had

firing practice while in the militias and the doctor considers this

man capable of doing anything.

Immediately I called two of my best men in Camajuani, one of them a

shoemaker who knows Wilfredo Russch very well and I

gave him instructions

but I didn't tell them too much of what I knew;

cat a sor gay chat they chu insins to be safirms what was

"M.C.S. was a poor person, poorly dressed, and after he was missing

from Remedios for several

weeks but this was not strange due to his

condition of militiaman and indoctrinated revolutionary, but now he

dresses weld, has a lot of money, owns large amounts of

I-shirts,

jackets and

shoes, all american made.

The rumors, are that he has given

some pairs of shoes to some of his friends.

"They were in a bar near

him and were able to observe that the shoes they were wearing were

American made" •

It seems that he departed from Dallas Texas with two friends, and the

Dentist believes he is following the tracks of one of them. li d have

had any means of transmitting this message, you would have known about

it at least ten days ago, but we have no other means to do it.
