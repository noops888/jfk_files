tLitanson, at Yr. Anderton's suggestion, asked

Amwhizel Le covrevt on ste feasibiliry of having AMIASH@1 core out to

gee us for orlefing purposes, This was done within the past 10 days,
AMWHIP-1 Gaia that the sorent was not good since Mre, Cubela had just
moe’. recently given cirtn, AMAHIP should be aaked whether he cade any

cell vo Havens, sent eny sessage of eny sort to Cubela, directly or

tadirectly, within the last 10 days. vr. Anderson wishes to point ont

that AMWHIF-1 could, if he were @ Castro agent, have informed the

Suuans 6f our desire to see LASH again. WHIPts porscnal frieniship ant
loyalty to LASH should be considered azainst this ~ to my thinking,

2) WTRIK-9, ouppooedly boing used by ACSI, reportedly
vont inte Cubs in Decentor 196 Ha we @ direct contact of ANTRUMED,.uho
Wa srreate with LASH-1, If TRUNK-9 were arrested (and even rolesesd =
or im still held) he would have been o lead to TRUNK-#2 AMLASH-1 has
repeatedly wrned us thet THUNK=10 vas nervous, feeling commily, ant
would likely ‘aix if arrested, If TRUYE-10 bad been arrested first,
if he télked, it would lesd to LASH, If arrested on TRUNK~9%3 talk,

At would etill lesd to LASH.

3} AMLASH-2 and Faure Choron (Minister of Transport) aro
both old DR Lesders, They had @ recent, serious, argument which ws
reported by “jor Alberto KORA Becerrs, Mora said that

& consequence,
ALASH-1 would either be arrested or have to leave the country, (This
information me undoubtedly reported to Raul Castro.) If Faure Choma
Wanted revenge on AMIASH=] (who called hin aneng other things a * sue
during the 1958 righting) he wuld bave seen to it that Raul decane =
inferred, if Paure Choren did not seek revenge on AMIASH-1 (for vhom



he has exerved hicsolf in the past few years ~ even to having @ traffic tivist
fined in 1964) Paul Castro and PIDEL hirself, umy see the fight between the

two ase wey to pay off both, Faure Chosoa and Rolando Cubela were the two

iss
DR leacers whe refused to turn over the palace to Castro on i mary hs. 7
In addition, Raul and AMLASH-1 have long been at odds = Raul threatening
hin previously for wearing « Commndanteta uniform while not participating

a aeelitatd &

in military activities, LASR’e blunt and “rotten” answer te Raul, et cetere,

Furthermore, Paure embarrassed Fidel greatly at the Marcos Rodrigues trina) ~

Gnt Fidel hag been waiting to "get even”, This is 8 good moment to etrike :
did not and *

st Faure, if PaureAmild net have barnsd aac. It would be awioard fer Hf
between then,

Poure to help defend LaSH now, in view of Ral known quarrel, without

involving hiraelf in the charge, Pidel could easily read into any
defense ty Paure of AMLASH now a further attompt to interfere with
his om "sustice™,

4) Raul Castro recently said that purge of the rilitary weald

be necessary. What better wy to begin? It also etrikes at the DR =
nd Paure, Castro and Company have long known of LASie distaste Li - ARTEE |
ther - hets told the: to their faces. Theytve also long imewn of hig

cocpiled by Raul
Conspirecy, ASH is on a list/of persons to be arrested immediately

Af coxething happens to Pidel, Pineiro also knows of LASH"s discent with Tel
the regine,

‘Loe este

5) After having told IASH what ws would provide (and Ganging oor
Poaition - due parsinlly to JPK¥s death) one should recognise the fact

thet ANLASH my not want to protect us, due to his disappointaent ab oar
refusal to extent a "moral recognition” of bis plan. On the other hand, -
he {9 undoubtedly wall ecare that Castrots "nerey” docs not extend to
“confessor” - witness Marcos Rodrigues ant Eloy Cutierres Hensyo - the

recently suffered a severe beating in prison, (Althe it might have been
the other Erle wee beat, elena At seers unlixely dur report.) 5
