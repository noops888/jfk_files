‘L..:On_ansroximately § March 1972, a Station asset, CIFENCE-b,
had occasion to detain and question
‘one Ricardo MORALES Navarrete, a Cuban resident of Miani.

2. Norales N. told CIFENCE-4 that he, Morales, is employed by.
LNERGO from whoa he receives a salary'cf US$700 per month. Morales said
that “he was en routé:-to Colobia on a drug case at the tine. During the
Conversation Morales. admitted to CIFENCE-b having been responsible for a
killing in Florida. :

Acatestesseet 1 “CIFENCS-4 reported to the Station the above, as well as stating
‘that ‘Morales has an extremély poor reputation in the Cubnh community,

where he is prone to tell nearly anyone willing to listen of his affiliation

with LNERGO, with the implication that his employer sanctions his

activities. 7

4, Morales also told CIFENCE-4 that a Cuban (true name of CIGOAL-5)
who works with SIFA in Caracas is an agent of BKTRUST.

5. Attached is a copy of the recntry permit of Morales, as vell es
a clipping fren the Miami press relating to the killing which Morales
allegedly confessed to having committed.

. 6. The esbove is for the information of Station Wil/Miomi and further
action as deemed appropriate. No coordination with LNERGO in Caracas has

EGRET -

TO . : WH/3 20 November 1971
FROM 2 Interrogation Research Division

SUBJECT: CIFFNCE/4 | IRD? 72601
BACKGROUND;

Subject, CIFENCE/4, is a 48-year-old, male, citizen of IDEN A
who has been of continuing interest to JKLANCE since initial contact,
He has permanent resident alien status in WOCORK as does his wife.

-He was last SGSWIRLed on 23 May 1968 with favorable results. Subject

claimed that during service with IDFN E and previous service with
JKLANCE, he had been SGSWIRLed and estimated the total number of
SGSWIRLs he ‘has had at twelve to fifteen,

PROCEDURE:

On 3 November 1971, CIFFNCE/4 was given a SGSWIRL at a covert
site in IDEN C. Both the English and Spanish languages were utilizéd in
discussing the SGSWIRL and the Case Cfficer, Edgar B. MARTEGANI,

served as interpreter. During the SGSW! nguage was
used. The undersigned was introduced as from WOCORK.
PURPOSF:

The SGSWIRL was requested by Fdgar B. MARTEGANI to determine
whether Subject knows if any member of IDEN D and specifically if IDEN E
is aware or suspects his current JKLANCE connections; if he has been
requested to work against LNLUTE; if since May 1968 he has been in con-
tact with or heard about IDEN F or IDEN G; if since May 1968 Subject has
been invived in illegal arms smuggling. Specific questions utilized during
the SCSWIRL are given later in this report.

CONCLUSION:

There were no unresolved reactions indicative of deception. It
is the opinion of the undersigned that Subject answered all ete ee t

SECRET [



~ SECRET

29 ‘November levi

fully. Apparently Subject-is unaware of any compromise cf his LNLUTF
connections; has been truthful in his reports to JKLANCE; has not been
involved in any illegal arms dealings other than Smug¢ling weapons into
IDEN A for his personal use and the personal use of other members of
IDEN D and related organizations; has not been asked to work againat
LNLUTE and has received no infermation from or about IDFN F or IDEN G,

DETAILS;

Subjéct was co-operative throughout the SGSWIRL and did not
hesitate to assist in rephrasing questions and explaining his responses,
He seemed open and frank in response to all queries. Subject exhibited
@ response to the question concerning IDEN F and IDFNG. Discussion
of the issue elicited the information that Subject had received some inform-
ation concerning a son of one of these Individuals. He also mentioned
that on a trip to IDFN H a few years ago he had spoken by telephone to
IDEN I but no mention had been made of IDEN F or IDFNG, Subject
also showed a response to the question concerning {llegal arms dealing.
He explained that when he travelled outside of the country he brought
back pistcls, rifles, and on one occasion a shotgun, These weapons
were for his personal use or were purchased for friends such as IDEN E
or members of IDFN D. He stated that the weapons were brought in
legally and that even possession of the rifles (which were for his own
use) was illegal. Specific questions concerning these arms dealings
were asked, Based on the sessions results, it appears that while Sub-
ject has smuggled arms Into IDFN A and possesses illegal arms, he has

** not been involved in smuggling large amounts of arms for personal profit
or engaged since May 1968 in smuggling weapons of war into IDEN A.

Specific questions utilized during the SGSWIRL were as follows:

Were you born inIDEN J? Yes

Did you reside in WOCORK* Yes.

Had you concealing the identity of anyone who knows you work for JKLANCE?

~CEFLUTE/CIPENCE :
( Possible Future Contact with CIFENCE-4 :
scr er, eR Say >
REY: HYCA-17611, 14 May 1970
Paragraphs 2 and 3 below

1, ~% appreciate Caracas’ offer for possible future contact
with CIFENCE-4.in the event of another emergency situation in
Trinidnd; @ possibility which should not be totally ruled out.

I was avare that four or five Venezuelan officials had arrived
in ‘Port of:Spain shortly after the declaration of a state of
‘but I had no contact with any of these individuals

emergency
during their stay here.

2, 1 agree with CIFENCE-4 that it vould have been to the
station's advantage to have had contact with him during the
period of the Regiment mutiny. To this end, I propose the
following contact arrangements. When CIFENCE-4 has arrived in
Port of Spain and has gotten himself set up, he should call
Identity A on Identity B during normal office hours (0800-1700).
One hour after telephonic contact has-been made with Identity A,
CIFENCE-4 will be picked up in Identity C at Identity D. In
order to establish bona fides, the case officer will ask of
CIFENCE-4 "Aro you a friend of Pedro's?". CIFENCE-4 should
respond "Yes, and of Tomas aleo.". Recognition signals having
-, ‘been exchanged and authenticated, I would feel free to ask

CIFENCE-4 to Keep me informed of developments from hia side as

they occurred,
3. Please provide a physical description of CIFENCE-4.

ATTENTION : Mr. John Rooney ‘

SUBJECT ; +Iais Clemente POSADA Carriles (201-300985)
REFERENCE : Caracas 4018 (IN 87480) copy attached

1. Caracas Station has requested Headquarters
stance in resolving as quickly possible a citizes-
ship question concerning Subject. In view of Subject's
operational importance to the Station we would appreciate
any effort your office could make to obtain a favorable
decision in this matter. :

3. Since Subject actually obtained his own job
through a friend in DISIP and made, his own travel arrange-
ments, the file does not reflect what type of d umentation
he has other that an expired reentry permit mentioned in
the reference. A biographic data sheet is attached which
gives the main points in Subject's background including
his U.S. military service.

4. The primary concera at this point is whether accepting
Venezuelan citizenship for operational reasons will destroy
or jeopardize in any way, Subject's plans to become a U.S.



citizen? It will be appreciated if your office could make ©

a determination on this question as soon as possible,
e@uphasizing to the appropriate authoritie our concern for.
Subject and. his operational importance to the U.S. intelligence

Attached ere four copies of an amendment to Subject's

Moc reflecting a raise in salary from Bs. 1,000 to Bs. 1,500

Per month, Station feels that AMCLEVE-15's operational
activities and intelligence disseminetions over the past six
. Months more than justify this modest raise in salary.

DISPATCH | s=cmc=

PROLEONE ATION

1, The attached outline was taken from a confessed
guerrilla, recently arrested by CIRASH in the city of

Barquisimeto, Venezuela. When interrogated by AMCLEVE-15
“and others; the arrestee said he did not know where the -

outline came from what language it wes inj and, in fact,

. said it-did not Belong to him,

2, . Various Station officers and assets have studied
. the outline, and the ccnsensus of opinion is that it is
probably Turkish or a middle-eastern language.

3. It is requested that Headquarters contact the
appropriate offices in an attempt to ascertain what language
the outline is written in, together with a translation of
its contents. Although Station personnel contacted felt
it unlikely, the possibility exists that the outline is in

leggy fe

code.

‘Seances, and to the Station's ntwledge, the test vas favorable
although an. official Hes :‘port hae not been received. A

would be appreciated if the Desk wouid contact the appropriate 1
Headquarters officials and advise the » Station of ANCLEVE-15'6_ .
official statis. We assume that he will bé filly cleared and that

a POA will be iasued followed by an OA after the Station submits

PRQ Part II. :

3. Noedquarters recently inquired as to Station thoughts on
including 4MCLEVE-15 in the CIFLUTE Project rather than making
SACLEVE a seperate project. The Station 4s completely in accord
with this idea although. it will probably necessitate funds being
shifted from CIGUSTY to CIFLUTE. Hovever, a separate dispatch will

be prepared on this subject.

4. The Station realizes that ANCIEVE-15's clearance has been
a thorny problem to the Desk and hopes that we can now clear it up

once and for all. 4 ,
