SUEJECT: CIFENCE/&

29 November 1972

IRD# 72501

BACKGROUND:

Subject, CIFENCE/4, Is a 49-year-old, male, citizen of IDEN A

who has been of continuing interest to JKLANCE since initial contact.

He has permanent resident alien status in WOCORK as does his wife.

He was last SGSWIRLed on 23 May 1968 with lavorable results. Subject

claimed that during service with IDEN E and previous service with

JKLANCE, he had been SGSWIRLed and estimated the total number of

SGSWIRLs he has had at twelve to fifteen.

PROCEDURE:

On 3 November 1971, CIFENCE/4 was given a SGSWIRL at a covert

site in IDEN C. Both the English and Spanish languages were utilized in

discussing the SGSWIRL and the Case Cfficer, Edgar B. MARTEGANI,

served as interpreter. During the SGSWIRL. the English language was

used. The undersigned was introduced as

from WOCORK.

PURPOSE:

The SGSWIRL was requested by Fdgar E. MARTEGANI to determine

whether Subject knows if any member of IDEN D and specifically 1 IDEN E

Is aware or suspects his current JKLANCE connections; if he has been

requested to work against LNLUTE; if since May 1968 he has been in con-

tact with or heard about IDEN F or IDEN G; If since May 1968 Subject has

been involved in illegal arms smuggling. Specific questions utliized during

the SCSWIRL are given later in this report.

CONCLUSION:

there were no unresolved reactions indicative of deception. It

Is the opinion of the undersigned that Subject answered all questions truth-

fully. Apparently Subject is unaware of any compromise if his LNLUTE

connections; has been truthful In his reports to JKLANCE; has not been

involved in any illegal arms dealings other than smuggling weapons into

IDEN A for his personal use and the personal use of other members of

IDEN D and related organizations; has not been asked to work against

LNLUTE and has received no information from or about IDEN F OF IDEN G.

DETAILS;

Subject was co-operative throughout the SGSWIRL and did not

hesitate to assist in rephrasing questions and explaining his responses.

He seemed open and frank in response to all queries. Subject exhibited

& response to the question concerning IDEN F and IDEN G. Discussion

of the Issue elicited the information that Subject had received some Inform-

ation concerring a son of one of these individuals.

He also mentioned

that on a trip to IDEN H a few years ago he had spoken by telephone to

IDEN I but no mention had been made of IDEN F or IDFN G. Subject

also showed a response to the question concerning illegal arms dealing.

He explained that when he travelled outside of the country he brought

back pistols, rifles, and on one occasion a shotgun. These weapons

were for his personal use or were purchased for friends such as IDEN E

or members of IDEN D. He stated that the weapons were brought in

illegally and that even possession of the rifles (which were for his own

use) was illegal. Specifle questions concerning these arms dealings

were asked. Based on the sessions results, it appears that while sub-

ject has smuggled arins into IDEN A and possesses illegal arms, he has

not been involved in smuggling large amounts of arms for personal profit

or engaged since May 1968 in smuggling weapons of war into IDEN A.

Specific questions utilized during the SGSWIRL were as follows:

Were you born in IDEN J? Yes

Did you reside in WOCORK: Yes

Are you concealing the identity of anyone who knows you work for JKI ANCE?

Chief, Alien Affairs Staff

Luis Clemente POSADA Carriles (A 12 $19 708)

1. Reference is made to previous correspondence concerning

this case.

•2.

The Immigration and Naturalization Service, by letter

dated 16 April 1970, has granted the benefits of Section 316(b) of

the Immigration and Nationality Act to cover the subject's absence

from the United States from 20 March 1970, to an indefinite period,

thereafter, and so long as he remains absent on behalf of the United

States Government, with the understanding that he will prove to the

satisfaction of the Naturalization Court when he files a Petition for.

United States Citizenship, five years after entry for permanent

residence, that he has been absent during this period for that pur-

pose.

The benefits of this Section of the Act also permit subject

to count the period of his absence toward both the residence and

physical presence requirements for naturalization, provided that,

since becoming a permanent resident of the United States and be-

fore applying for naturalization, he has completed an uninterrupted

period of one year of physical presence in the United States.

3. The letter is being retained in the files of this Office and it

is requested you so advise Luis Clemente POSADA Carriles.
