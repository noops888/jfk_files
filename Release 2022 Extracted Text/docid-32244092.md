ENS ERT ‘asett Nw 68261 Date:

December 8, 1995

Status of Document: Postponed in Part

Number of releases of previously postponed information: 9

Reason for Board Action: The Review Board's decision was premised on several factors
including: (a) the significant historical interest in the document in question; (b) the
absence of evidence that the release of the information would cause harm to the United
States or to any individual.

Number of Postponements: 4

Postponements: All the postponements in this document represent Social Security numbers.

Reason for Board Action: The text is redacted because the public disclosure of the redaction could
reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, and that invasion of
privacy would be so substantial that it outweighs the public interest.

While the attached resume of Ms. Miriam Rudder does !
not reflect experience related to office duties, I

know her well and certainly trust her. Therefore,

I strongly recommend that she be hired for me to

train as a mail clerk working along with

Patricia Price. Again, as I indicated above, the

most important thing to me in this instance is that i

I have the utmost trust in Miriam. i

Your consideration in this matter is greatly appreciated.
