1. Lee Harvey Oswald's 201 file was first opened
under the name of Lee Henry Oswald on 9 December 1960
as a result of his "defection" to the USSR on 31 October
1959 and renewed interest in Oswald brought about by his
queries concerning possible reentry into the United States. °

2. The file contains two Federal Bureau of
Investigation reports, dated 25 May 1960 and 3 July 1961,
respectively, which contain interviews of Oswald's mother
and brother concerning the possible return to the United
States of Oswald and of his loyalty. The American Embassy
in Moscow also sent two telegrams in May and October 1961
conveying Oswald's wish to return to the United States
and five of Oswald's letters asking for compliance with
his request. The file also cqntains an Oswald letter sent
to the Marine Corps disputing the Marine Corps discharge
classification 6f him as undesirable. It is believed that
the above documents were also circulated among the FBI,
State Department, Immigration and Naturalization Service
as well as Naval Intelligence.

from Win Scott, COS Mexico City to the United States
Ambassador there concerning Oswald's visit to Mexico

City cables in October 1963 also concerned with Oswald's
visit to Mexico City, as well as his visits to the Soviet
and Cuban Embassies. These cables were passed on
the FBI, State Department and Naval Intelligence while
