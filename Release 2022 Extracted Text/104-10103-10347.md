The Implications to the Power Alignments of Escalante's
Purge:
1. The purge of Anibal Escalante Dellunde, Executive
Secretary of the PSP from the position of —
in the ORI did not create a "split"
between "new" and "old" communists.
2. Castro's reasons for purging Escalante ‘were Almost
Certainly Aimed at:
-r Be Reassuring those 26th of July leaders who
had fought for the revolution but not for

communism,



‘+. b, Putting the brakes on the PSP's grab
for power. i
‘c. Castigating Escalante for personal
"sectarianism",
E. A New View on Splitting the Regime:

1. Castro's purge of Escalante surfaced his

elements of the 26th of July Movement and the
"unaligned" government leader and the PSP - "old"
and "new",
2. To split Castro from the PSP would be difficult
and of questionable value: .
a. The PSP to gain its final objective would
take any insult and turn the other cheek.

Z “It had embraced Fidel and would not let go
under any circumstances. To rise against
Castro now would not be opportune, and
would probably be fatal.

b, Fidel was now totally dependent on the
Soviet Union

c. The only hope was not to split Fidel from
PSP but to identify, at every opportunity,

of the government could effectively be -

dad. This. conclusion did not preclude the Task
Force from attempts to create suspicion,
hostility and friction between Castro and
the PSP.

so The Direction of Task Foreé Efforts to Split the Regime:
A. To identify those members of the 26th of July Movement

and other "unaligned" government leaders who were for
the revolution but against communism. To date, there
is reasonably good évidence indicating that the
following individuals do not approve of the communist
direction of the Cuban revolution and may in fact

be conspiring against the regime.

Major Pedro: Miret Prieto, commanding artillery unit
Ambassador Gustavo Arcos y. Bergnes

Commander Sebastian Arcos, brother of Gustavo rnd
a commander in the Cuban havy. Hns been in Prague
for some time on a training mission

important member of this group of potential .con-

effort to ore him in @eussers, Tespite our :

contact with TFW sources,

Conspiring in Cuba today is dengerous business.
These are fearful men and neither easily identified
or easily contacted within Cuba.

Each of the above men’remain as high priority targets
within, Our main efforts to contact them take tro
directions: (1) The identification of suitable
intermediaries to them, and (2) the eventual use
of internal assets now in place.
