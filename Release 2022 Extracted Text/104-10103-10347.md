D. The Implications

to.

the Power Alignments of Escalante's

Purge:

1. The purge of Anibal Escalante Dellunde, Executive

Secretary of the PSP from the position of -

in the ORI did not create a "split"

between "new" and "old" communists.

2. Castro's reasons for purging Escalante were Almost

Certainly Aimed at:

Reassuring those 26th of July leaders who

had fought for the revolution but not for

communism.

b. Putting the brakes on the PSP's grab

for power.

c. Castigating Escalante for personal

"sectarianism".

E.

A New View on Splitting the Regime:

1. Castro's purge of Escalante surfaced his

concern for the balance between the non-communist

elements of the 26th of July Movement and the

"unaligned" government leader and the PSP - "old"

and "new".

z..

To split Castro from the PSP would be difficult

and of questionable value:.

a. The PSP to gain its final objective would

take any Insult and turn the other cheek.

It had embraced Fidel and would not let go

under any circumstances. To rise against

Castro now

would not be opportune, and

would probably be fatal.

b.

Fidel was now totally dependent on the

Soviet Union

The only hope was not to split Fidel from

PSP but to identify, at every opportunity,

him and his government with communism, for

only the non-communist element of the 26th

of July Movement and the "unalighed leaders

of the government could effectively be

split from the government.

d.

This conclusion did not preclude the Task

Force from attempts to create suspicion,

hostility and friction between Castro and

the PSP.

• II.

The Direction of Task Force Efforts to Split the Regime:

A. To identify those members of the 26th of July Movement

and other "unaligned" government leaders who were for

the revolution but against communisn. To date, there

18

reasonably good evidence indicating that the

following individuals do not approve of the communist

direction of the Cuban revolution and may in fact

be conspiring against the regime.

1. Major Pedro Miret Prieto, commanding artillery unit

2. Ambassador Gustavo Arcos y Bergnes

3. Commander Sebastian Arcos, brother

of Gustavo rnd

a commander in the Cuban havy. Has been in Prigue

for some time on a training mission

4. Orlando Ventura Reyes

5. Manuel Carbonell Duque

6. Major Faustino Perez, former minister charged with

the recovery of stolen properties

7. Ouar Fernandez Canizares, Minister of Transportr

tion.

NOTE: Ambassador Gustavo Arcos is undoubtedly an

important member of this group of potential con-

spirators.

TEW has made an unsuccessful but sustained

effort to recruit him in russels.

Trespite our

failure

to date, Arcos remains In close and friendly

contact with TFW sources.

Conspiring in Cuba today is dangerous business.

These are fearful men and neither

easily identified

or easily contacted within Cuba.

Each of the above men remain as high priority targets

within. Our main efforts to contact them take tur

directions: (1)

The identification of suitable

intermediaries to them, and (2) the eventual use

of internal assets now

in place.
