In response to Mr. Fenn's letter of 14 November 1975 to
Mr. Frank Foster which posed a number of questions on matters
related to President Kennedy's assassination, the following
information is provided:

NSA has identified some four foreign communications which
mention Lee Harvey Oswald, but has not identified any messages
to or from him. The four identified messages are Cuban diplomatic
and contain official Cuban comments regarding press items which
discuss Oswald's activity in late September 19@ to obtain a
Cuban visa to travel to Moscow and also comments on the assina-
tion itself. The messages are dated in the last week of
November 1963. i

NSA has not identified any communications to, from or
mentioning Marina Oswald, Jack Ruby or Earl Ruby.

.

The specific questions asked and responses follow:

1. Were any of the above names put on a watch list and,
if so, by which agency or individual of the Government?

ANSWER: The name of Oswald was used in searching our data
base immediately following the assassination. Records from that
time period are virtually non-existent and it is not clear which
agency or individual of the Government requested the search to
be made.

2. Was product or information concerning the individuals
cited above ever requested by any agency or individual of the
Government or of the Warren Commission? If so, what information
and by whom?

ANSWER: NSA has no record or recollection of such requests.

3. Was product or information concerning the individuals
cited above ever disseminated to any agency or individual of the
Government or of the Warren Commission? If so, what information
and to whom?

ANSWER: The four Cuban diplomatic messages cited above were
disseminated to CIA, DIA, STATE and elements of the Army, Navy
and Air Force.

the Soviet Union? If so, to which agencies was this information

warranted dissemination.

5. Were there ever any requests to monitor specific links
for information pertaining to the individuals cited above? Who
made these requests, and when? Did these include links between
