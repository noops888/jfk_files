He stated that he terminated his affiliation in about 1946. He also

stated that he had no knowledge of the present RAS activity. ONICK advised that he

was in contact with members of the Soviet Consulate, San Francisco, in connection

with the delivery of clothing to U.S.S.R and that he attended Soviet-sponsored social

functions. He had no indication of espionage activity by Soviet personnel and was

unable to recall Andrei R. Orlov.

Onick stated that his son, SUBJECT, was a loyal YS>

citizen; never has been

of a subversive organization; and that he had no

knowledge or organizational affiliations of SUBJECT's wife, Valentina. Onick stated

that he has never been sympathetic to the CP or the Communist Government of Soviet

He advised that prior to World War II he had subscribed to the Daily Peoples

World (DW) for one or two years, but that he never was impressed with the publication.

e. FBI report dated 25 May 1956, revealed the following: On 30 April 1956,

Valentina nick, SUBJECT's present wife, was interviewed and verified previous back

ground concerning herself and confirmed her employment with the Office of the Commer

cial Counselor (Soviet Government) in Vancouver, B. C., Canada from about May 1946

to February 1947. She claimed to have no knowledge of espionage activity by the

Soviet personnel, or any of their Canadian contacts whom she cannot now recall. Mrs.

Onick said she was a member of the National Council for Canadian-Soviet Friendship

Society during 1943-1944 (According to a confidential source abroad, this organiza

tion came under Communist control about 1947. She admitted being a member of the

Federation of Russian Canadians and said that her parents were also members of this

organization.

She stated that her brother, Walter Belobrodski, was a member of the

Polish Democratic Association. Mrs. Onick declared that she and her parents engaged

in the activities of the above organizations for social reasons.

She asserted that

she has never engaged in espionage or disloyal activities, and she knew of no such

activity on the part of her husband or relatives. She also stated that she and her

husband are not interested in politics other than being loyal to the country of their

choice, and that she has applied to become a U. S. citizen.

fo A complaint investigation was conducted by the 115th CIC Detachment;

commenced 5 March 1956 and was completed 25 July 1956. This investigation revealed

the following:

(1) SUBJECT and his present wife had contact with Irving Isidore

August at a party given by them for the ARC personnel in seattle area in approximately

march 15o, and SUbuill is reported to be sympathetic toward August. (This head-

quarters recommended that August not be granted an appointment in the USAR, on the

grounds that such appointment would not be clearly consistent with the interests of

national security.)

(2)

Reviews of the previously summarized FBI reports were included

in the investigation.

(3) Two sources described SUBJECT's relationship with his father as

closer than that usually experienced between father and son, and two sources stated

that SUBJECT regards his father as a "pal." Eight sources variously indicated that

SUBJECT was not unduly influenced or dominated by either parent. Four sources

variously believed that SUBJECT was not influenced by his former spouse, Vera Orloff.

Three sources believed that SUBJECT would dominate his wife, Valentina, in any

decision pertaining to politics.

Two sources believed SUBJECT to be a

Democrat, two

believed him to support one of the two major political parties, and three sources

indicated that he was not interested in politics. Iwenty six sources believed

SUBJECT to be loyal to the United States Government, and eighteen of these recommended

him for a position of trust and confidence with the government. Eight declined for

various reasons.

(4) National and Local Agency Checks on SUBJECT, his wife, his family,

and character references failed to reveal any pertinent derogatory information.

There is no indication of SUBJECT's membership in any cited organization.

3. DISCUSSION:

The extent of the derogatory information in this case consists of SUBJECT'S

affiliation with the Ras in 1945 and his association with individuals who in the past

have had connections with subversive organizations. There is no evidence that SUBJECT's

father has had any contact with subversive organizations since 1947, at which time,

he dropped out of the RAS.

SUBJECT has had no contact with his former wife, Vera, or

any of the members of her family. The investigation has also failed to establish any

activity on the part of valentina nick in connection with her employment and contact

with Sergei G. Lukianov. On the other hand, her family has a history of connection

with subversive organizations in Canada and her brother, Walter Belobrodske, was the

secretary of the Polish Democratic Association, which has been described as

Communist

controlled. SUBJECT has stated that he is not interested in politics and this has

been backed up by several persons who are acquainted with him. It is an interesting

in 1945, when in an interview under oath on 12 December 1955, he freely admitted these

associations.

This fact cannot be explained. From the statement SUBJECT made on

12 December 1955, it seems as though he has a "I couldn't-care-less" attitude toward

Conmunism and the security of our country, although this is not an indication of

disloyalty. On the basis of the facts that have been presented through the extensive

investigation it is impossible to state that SUBJECT is now connected with or sympathetic

toward Communism or any subversive organizations. It is therefore impossible to

consider SUBJECT's retention or promotion in the USAR to be not clearly consistent

with the interests of national security®

40 CONCLUSION:

- It is therefore concluded that based on the lack of evidence of present

membership, affiliation, or association with a subversive organization, and the

lack of evidence of sympathy with such organizations or Communism, SUBJECT is not

a security risk.

5. RECOMMENDATION:

It is recommended that this case be forwarded to ACSI, DA, with a favorable
