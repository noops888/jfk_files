\

Valentina QOnick, SUBJECT's present wife, was interviewed and verified prévious back— i
ground concerning herself and confirmed her employment with the Office of the Commer—
cial Counselor (Soviet Government) in Vancouver, B, C., Canada from about May 1946
to February 1947. She claimed to have no knowledge of espionage activity by the
Soviet personnel, or any of their Canadian contacts whom she cannot now recall. Mrs. ls i
Onick said she was a member of the National Council for Canadian-Soviet Friendship

tion came under Communist control about 1947.) She admitted being a member of the i
Federation of Russian Canadians and said that her parents were also members of this
organization, She stated that her brother, Walter Belobrodski, was a member of the
Polish Democratic Association, Mrs. Onick declared that she and her parents engaged

(1) SUBJECT and his present wife had contact with Irving Isidore
August at a party given by them for the ARC personnel in Seattle area in approximately
March 1956, and SUBJECT is reported to be sympathetic toward August. (This head-

national security.) -

(3) Two sources described SUBJECT's relationship with his. father as
closer than that usually experienced between father and son, and two sources stated
that SUBJECT regards his father as a "pal." Eight sources variously indicated that
SUBJECT was not unduly influenced or dominated by either parent. Four sources
variously believed that SUBJECT was not influenced by his former spouse, Vera Orloff.
Three sources believed that SUBJECT would dominate his wife, Valentina, in any
decision pertaining to politics. Two sources believed SUBJECT to be a Democrat, two
believed him to support one of the two major political parties, and three sources
indicated that he was not interested in politics, Twenty-six sources believed
SUBJECT to be loyal to the United States Government, and eighteen of these recommended
him for a position of trust and confidence with the government. Eight declined for
various reasons.

(4) National and Local Agency Checks on SUBJECT, his wife, his family, =
and character references failed to reveal any pertinent derogatory information.
There is no indication of SUBJECT's membership in any cited organization.

32 DISCUSSION:

The extent of the derogatory information in this case consists of SUBJECT's
affiliation with the RAS in 1945 and his association with individuals who in the past
have had connections with subversive organizations, There is no evidence that SUBJECT's |
father has had any contact with subversive organizations since 1947, at which time, |
he dropped out of the RAS, SUBJECT has had no contact with his former wife, Vera, or i
any of the members of her family. The investigation has also failed to establish any
activity on the part of Valentina Onick in connection with her employment and contact
with Sergei Ge Lukianov, On the other hand, her family has a history of connection
with subversive organizations in Canada and her brother, Walter Belobrodske, was the 4
secretary of the Polish Denocratic Association, which has been described as Communist
controlled. SUBJECT has stated that he is not interested in polities and this has
been backed up by several persons who are acquainted with him, It is an interesting
note that SUBJECT in executing DD Form 398 on 25 March 1956, failed to list his
association with a member of a subversive organization or his contact with the RAS
in 1945, when in an interview under oath on 12 December 1955, he freely admitted these
associations. This fact cannot be explained. From the statement SUBJECT made on
12 December 1955, it seems as though he has a "I couldn't-care-less" attitude toward
Communism and the security of our country, although this. is not an indication of
disloyalty. On the basis of the facts that have been presented through the extensive i
investigation it is impossible to state that SUBJECT is now connected with or sympathetic |
toward Communism or any subversive organizations, It is therefore impossible to
consider SUBJECT's retention or promotion in the USAR to be not clearly consistent
with the interests of national security.

4- CONCLUSION:

“ It is therefore concluded that based on the lack of evidence of present x
membership, affiliation, or association with a subversive organization, and the

lack of evidence of sympathy with such organizations or Communism, SUBJECT is not

a security risk.

5. RECOMMENDATION: .

It is recommended that this case be forwarded to ACSI, DA, with a favorable
