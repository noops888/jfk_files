ILEANA AMELIA RODES GONZALEZ

IS - CUBA

DATE:

8-20-64

ReBulet to Miami, 7-29-64.

Relet pointed out that although interview

of the subject was reported in Miami report 7-15-64,

that interview was conducted in the course of another

investigation and was not directed specifically toward

resolving allegations made against subject, in particular,

allegations that subject is anti-American in her feelings.

UACB, the Miami Office will not reinterview

the subject inasmuch as she has denied allegations that

she ever cooperated with Cuban intelligence

and also

claimed she is opposed to the CASTRO regime. It is

unlikely that she would admit to un-American and anti-

United

States sentiment which she was interpreted to

roster, according to FRANCISCO RODRIGUEZ TAMAYO and

PSI MARGO PENA.

It is the belief of the Miami Office

that nothing would be gained by reinterview of subject

concerning any anti-American feelings particularly as

no information has been received that subject is

presently active in any Cuban organizations in the Miami

area or in any pro or anti-CASTRO activity.
