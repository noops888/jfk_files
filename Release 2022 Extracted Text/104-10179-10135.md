MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Manolo RAY

1, I did not have the oppoitunity to discuss many Cuban
problems with Manolo RAY during the period 4-13 June in both
Sun Juan and Paris, Our meetings were largely devoted to the
effort of contacting and attempting to recruit or cause the
: defection of Carlos FRANQUI, The following, however, are the
conclusions of ny brief effort to discuss the general situation

with RAY,

2, Manolo RaY's Attitude Towards KUBARK: It has become
obvious to me on this second meeting with Manolo RAY that:

a. RAY is convinced that the Agency had in the past
purposely and actively attempted to destroy him as a
political leader, In this connection, RAY feels that the
: Agency, following the Bay of Pigs invasion, was partially
responsible for the break up of the MRP clandestine net-
work and resistance potential in and out of Cuba, RAY
stated that he has proof of the participation of at least
one KUBARK officer in a plot with certain MRP officials to
remove him from the MRP as a condition for KUBARK's
i assistance to that organization, RAY added that the
officer in question has been fired. He either did not
know or could not recall the individual's name or pre-
ferred not to mention it,

b. On the strength and position of the State White

Paper on Cuba prior to the Bay of Pigs, RAY's MRP joined
7 the FRD (ater the CRC), While his organization was a
menbor of the FRD,‘tho attention >f KUBARK and the U. 8,
Government was cafled time and time again. by the FRD
and by the MRP to the infiltration and uséief notorious

c. ‘fhe JURE represents a group of men of unquestioned
integrity, intelligence, organizational ability, or general
competence to run a free Cuba in the tradition of the

revolution.

d, The JURE has a seuse of timing, the patience that
must go with this, and an appreciation of the need to
create a truly Cuba "mistique" in a movement to fight for
the liberation of Cuba. (In this connection, it is
important to note that RAY did not, and would not, expose
himself to an effort against FRANQUI without some assurance
of success. He stated openly that it would ill-become
him to associate himself with failure.)

. @. The JURE, when they have the logistical support in
place and ready for use, will have the personne] ready.
This was clearly implied but not actually stated. RAY
stated that no purpose would be served, except to expose
those who will assist them, by engaging in clandestine
activities that do not have the necessary material and

logistical support.

5. While we covered various aspects of the above ground
different angles and I reiterated again the fact that

cooperation is a two-way street which RAY acknowledged in

that

6. Recommendation for Future Relations with RAY (JURE):

a. BaY cannot be overlooked in the struggle for Cuban
freedom; of all the Cubans I havé met, he is the most
purneseful, methodical, as wel} as the most experienced
Clandestine operator. I think-he does Know a sure way of

one year. In return for our assistance, RAY is to provide
KUBARE with all manner of intell:gence derived from JURE
operations inside Cuba.

d. The'assistance to RAY and coatact with him should
produce enough informatioa to judge his true effectivenss
and make possible his neutralization when and if this
should become necessary,

7. Conciusions:

a. Because the cables sent in to Hqs both from San
Juan and Paris are an accurate, if condensed, version of |
my relations with RAY in his operational efforts against

-Carlos FRANQUI, Enrique CABRERA Infante and Gustavo ARCOS,

& separate mcmorandum for the record will not be prepared
unless s0 desired by the Chicf, SAS.

b. RAY has known ne as Alfredo Fernandez, but
because of operational limitarions. (false identity
documents, reservations in true name) it became necessary
for him to call] me in my true name. He was not, however,
told that this. latter name was in fact true. In all our
personal meetings he continued to call me “Fernandez.”

ec. RAY recognized and remembered having met |Earl
Williamson )(Growery-P) in Cuba years ago.
