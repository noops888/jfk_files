Information gained from this source has

led to a successful recruitment in the Yugoslav babassy during

the past year.

Examples of some important non-disseminable information

obtained through LIENVOY during the past year are:

During May, through LIENVOY, the Station uncovered

a harrassment oporation directed against

the U.S. Embassy by the

use of forged routine forms to embarrass the Ambussy and known

anti-Comaunists.

As a result they took immediato action

to PBPRIME by making appropriate arrests, conducting

interrogations, rejecting a Cuban Embassy protest note, and

In December 1963, a KUBARK oficial traveled to Mexico with

visual presentation concerning the Cuban arms cache in Venezuela.

There he gave a special briefing to LITENSOR, pointing out the

authenticity of the Cuban origin of those arms, and thus contri

outing signiticantly to a reaction by the mexican Government on

this important inter-American matter favorable to UDYOKE.

In connection with a trip made by LITENSOR to several East

and West European countries

in March and April 1963, the Station

was provided several briefing papers on these countries,

by KUMONK and KUWOLF, for passage to LITENSOR.

LITENSOR'S

official party was also provided contact with

a KUBARK official

in each West European city so that he might send classified

certain trusted Mexican vificials through KUBARK

channels if

he so wished.

Inter-Agency Coordination:

No formal inter-Agency co-

ordination is required in this Project.

The Chief, PBSWING, Mexico,

is the only ODYOKE representative in Mexico outside KUBARK who is

aware of this project

and its provision for a special channel to

matters as the special briefing on the arms cache

in Venezuela were discussed in detail with him.

Plans: No significant operational changes are planned

the coming Project year.

In December 1964 LITENSOR will

probably be replaced by LITEMPO-2.
