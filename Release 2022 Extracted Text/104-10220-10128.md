COMMENTS RE DEROGATORY TRACES ~
ATTACHMENT TO FORM 772

1, A-POA was requested on Subject in January 1968 for his

-usa_as_a penetration of
Cancellation yas requested in February 1968 because

of indications that Subject was involved in "clandestine sabotage
activity and suspicions that Subject failed to report his activi- ‘
tics to CIA, Thereafter, Subject was treated as a "hostile".

In the ensuing months Bubjoct was describod as "an extromely
valuable penctration™ because of his important and accurate
intelligence information and operational reports, Subject was
given a polygraph examination to clear up questions about pos-
sible affiliation with Cuban intelligence, unreported associa- .
tion with gangster elements, etc, His responses showed no
Aintormation which would prevent CIA using him for ops purposes,
Request for POA was again requested on 7 Soptomber 1968. This
POA request was turned down on 15 Octobex duo to Subject being

an “agent of a foreign powor."

2, Sinco that time Subject has continued to provide verbal
and written information reports concerning Communist and subver-
sive elements, guerrilla activities, Soviet activities, sabotage,
etc, Subject continues to report accurately and often and has
a vory pro-U.S, attitude. Subject was again polygraphed on
29 November 1971 (a copy of which is contained in Subject's
CI/0A folder), His responses indicated no deception concern-
ing truthfulness of reporting to CIA, no compromise of his
U.8, Government connections, non-involvement in illegal arms

dealings, etc.

MEMORANDUM FOR! Director of Training fe of!
Attention: Chief, Covert Training OS/TR aC
Preis
SUBJECT 1 Covert Training Requirement for Station a u ye"
Caracas, Projoct CI7LUTE p
REFERENCE 1 CSI No, 2545

1. With regard to previous discussions between WH/3/
Venezuela and Chief, Covert Training Zranch, it is hereby
requonted that two instructors be assigned on TLY status to
Station Caracas for the pur)

ina for selected members of
and the Central Documentation Service (SDC). Names
of tl training candidates are included on a separate sheet

attached to this memorandum. .

2, This training program has een initiated at the direct
request of senior Venezuclan liaison officers associated with
Station Caracas. A general, descripticn of the situation, cub-
ject matter and identification of pozzibie problem arcas has
boon forwarded to you in the form of HYCA-16550, 9 May 1969.

a

3. Project CIFLUTE, under which this training will be
conducted, was approved on 8 Match 1963 and covors all lfaison
conducted by Station Caracas with the Yenezuclan security

services.

4 In thie trzining program, we hope to attain sevecal
First, through training selected members of

ne: SDC we wish to present rvusd operational methods
and Eechniques which will impress the trainees and secve as a
guide to them in ampcoving their operations, Secondly, it is
desired to improve Station Caracas’ gon relationship with
these services by presenting a highly professional training
progcam, Third, we hope that through this good will, the Station
will be able to develop potential unilateral agent recruits
who will become perictrations of the Yenezuclan services.

5. at of the trainea candidates (ace attached Liat) are

members of nd SDC, The first four individuals listed
have extensi intelligence backyrourds and are experienced

ai



operations personnel, ‘The remaining six trainees may be
ansumed to have moderate experience = inore in the field of law
enforcement and police investigations rather than intelligence
operations, 201 files aro available at the desk on each indivi-~
dual and wo will make these £1les available to the instructors
to give them an idea of cach individuals background.

6. Trainees will be available on a full time basis, A
secure building haa been obtained by the liaison services for
exclusive use by instructors during the training cycles. Train-
ing will have to be conducted in Spanish,

7. Although evaluations on all trainecs are desired, the
last six individuals listed will require more attention since
our relationship with these men is new and less is known about
them, Station Caracas will provide guidanco in this area. An
additional point of intorest would be any individual among this
group who might have potential as an instructor.

8. Follow-up training and/or technical training will be

based on instructor and Station recommendations, At this time
we have no information on what, if any, technical skills the

trainees have.

5 September 1968

MEMORANDUM FOR: CI/OA
SUBJECT 4 AMCLEVE-15 (201-300985)  ~ i

1. Subject, a Cuban now living in Caracas, Venezuela,
enetration of the Venezuelan General
and asmaller,

somewhat autonomous unit| I was requested
on Subject on 25 January » to use Subject as stated above.
On 1 February 1967, WH/3/V requested cancellation of the POA
request because. of indications that Subject was involved in
Clandestine sabotage activity and there were s at
he had failed to report his activities to CIA

Station Caracas was directed to handle Subject as a “hostile”,
The Station was advised that they could maintain ot th
Subfect as a source of information on activities en
and but that.no requirements w

lev: ation was advised that they could make
spot payments for information received from Subject. CI/OPS
co-ordinated on these directions to Station Caracas.

2. The Station acknowl cdyed their instructions but
demurred on Headquarters' interpretation of ANCLEVE-15's
activities, The Station stated, in effect, that assets are
often unsavory individuals, who are never under complete con~
trol and who scidom disclose the complete range of their
activities to their supervisors. The Station added that they
were interested in Subject because on as a “trusted
confidant" of certain highly placed ecurity officials.

3. In the ensuing months the Station came to describe
Subject as “an extremely valuable penetration" because of the
intelligence information and operational reports he furnished
For example, he reported on the involvenent of tha]
military in a Cuban exile plan to attack Cuba. And, he also
reported on a plan of Cuban exiles to ship arms from|

-2-

as part of an infiltration scheme. He has reported such
operational information as a description of the capabilities,
Layout and equipment’ joperations.
Included in this information was his report that, at least on
paper, the U.S. Embassy was a target for bperations. He
has also reported on the personalities and workings of the
organizations with Which he is associated. At the same time
the Station had an independent report that Subject was involved
in a scheme to obtain "curare poison for approximately forty
hypodermic necdles". To avoid exposing the source of their
information the Station did not query AMCLEVE-15 about the
matter. The Station said that they disapproved of his involve-
ment in wild Cuban exile schemes but that Headquarters restric-
tiong in February 1968 prevented the Station from discussing this

“involvement with him. .

4. In May 1968, the Station informed Headquarters that
they believed that Subject was collaborating fully with CIA and,
further, they believed that he would not expose, inform, or
work against CIA. They added that Subject was still capable of
engaging in independent Cuban exile activity without informing —
hi

! The Station also requested a polygraph exam-
tiation for Subject.

5. Subject was-given a polygraph examination to resolve
specifically his bona fides, possible affiliation with Cuban
Intelligence through relatives, unreported association with
gangster elements, thefts from WOFIRM and other questions
involving possible derogatory information on Subject. Subject's
responses, deecribed as substantially truthful by the examiners,
appear to contain no information which would prevent CIA's
operational use of Subject. On only one question, that involv-
ing Subject's association with an alleged racketeer,Lefty Rosenthal
did sensitivity persist. The examiner commented, ",..In fairness
to Subject this sensitivity is believed generated by genuine un~

certainty over the amount of Para military items which he had
been instrumental in getting for Rosenthal from Cuban exile

arms supplies, "

6. Station Caracas has requested that they be allcwed to
cease treating AMCLEVE-15 as a “hostile” and that he be pro-
cessed for POA/OA to permit more effective utilization of this
well placed penetration agent. Wil
request.

3. Significant information in Subject's file concerns
hig two brothers who are currently in Cuba and his relations
with a well known Miami gangster. One brother, Roberto
POSADA Carriles, a suspect DSE official, is the Cuban
