; 1. As per: reference D Heddquarters concurs in this program and has offered
i to forward requirements if JMWAVE so desires. Since this approval wes obtained

7 from Headquarters, I have taken the following steps: (A) requested and obtained
: some requirements from IS to be uscd: in this program and (B) through PASSAVOY
have requested some basic informatton as to specific facilities for use in this
program. AMBUD-1 is to advise us on the following matters: if the Hotel Monroe,
for which AMBUD receives approximately $600 per month, has space available for
the establishment of an interrogation center; if AMBUD. has individuals now,9g its
payroll who could be used in this program as interrogators and translators; t£
AMBUD-1 has, as requested, advised the group members of AMBUD to each appoint
an individual as "Jefe de Informacton"x in such cases vhere one does not already

exist. 7

2. My primary purposesin setting up this collection program ts/to obtain
useful information and to make AMBUD a useful organization with a purpose in mind--
a purpose with # practical gad visible ends. AMBUD is a large organizetion couposed
of a numbérggf,exayps and individuals which also has effilfates who are rot actual
members. Thelgefeonnel avaibbh to it is undoubtedly unequailed in the WAVE Area.
From this vast reserve of manpower, there is every reason to believe competent
interrogators can be found, although most of them would naturally need training in
intérrogation and reporting techniques, which factor can be surmounted. In addition
to the AMBUD personnel supply, there is also a vast, untouched number of sources tu
of information in the WAVE area. For example, part of each plane load whke uf exiles
which arrives from Clba is released by Imnigration; the remainder (about 2/3) are
sent to CAC. Of that number all are screened at CAC and about § are ectually
interrogated at CAC due to the lack of personnel to nandle any more cases. In wthex’
yaxdx addition, no women arriving from Cuba are interrogated at CAC. Therefore,
the number of persons who are potential sources of information available to AMBUD
would be approximately 2/3 of all teose arriving from Cuba, plus all the women.

3. I think we should approcah this information collection program with ao

+ several Folite Inspectors and

As a result, I plan to make up a chart,or table of organization,of an pie 1
interrogation center for this purpose, In addition, I will make an estimal
of any additonal expenses which might be involved in the near future. Since I
have had actual KUBARK ‘expdricnce in an interrogation center, I believe I am
at least somewhat. qualified to make certain suggestions. (FYI: in the joiat
xu] Interrogation Center created for the interrogation of
Fepatriates from the USSR, I was chief of the CE Section, In additéon, 1'trained

Officers in interrogation techniques,
Also, I was head of a five-man interrogation teem.)

4. An interrogation ceater of the type I havé in mind, after dertous consideration

‘of the personnel,facilities and sources available to AMBUD, ‘shoulé put AMBUD on

the operational uap, so to speak, and should also do credit to JMWAVE. This centerk
would uot be in opposition tc, or in competition with CAC, since the sources tapped
would be those they are’not physically able to handle and the vomen ho new ace’
under no one's jurisdiction for such mattaxex purposes. |
5. At your conventence ‘I woulg,1tke the opportunity to discuss thie program |
with you and to also talk about thefrequirements for passing to AMBUD.
