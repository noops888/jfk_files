Republic of Germany (FRG), was interviewed at his place of duty regarding

an incident of possible Counter-Intelligence interest, and stated substantiälly

as follows:

Source was approached by a man who identified himself as John the

Dee Jay on 31 January 1972, in the Lord Nelson, a bar in Datteln. John

the Dee Jay was the Disc Jockey at the Lord Nelson.

John sat down with

Source and began a normal conversation.

The conversation soon turned to

John asked about CPT FNU Myers and CPT FNU Jackson,

who supposedly had been assigned to the unit at one time. John mentioned

that he had taken pictures of Myers and his family. John asked Source about

radar and other military subjects.

Sergeants, phone numbers and personnel that were formerly at the unit.

John stated that he knew the last Security Sergeant of C Team, and was

interested in knowing who was now the Security Sergeant. At 2330 hours,

Source left the Lord Nelson and proceeded to the Western Bar, Datteln.

At the Western, Source met a man, name unknown, who owned the photography

Shop across the street from the Western, whom Source described as a "drinking

buddy". Source and the unidentified man (UIM) left the Western about 0100

hours and proceeded to the Lord Nelson.

At the Lord Nelson, Source and UIM

were joined at their table by John the Dee Jay. Upon learning that UIM

was a Photographer, John asked him if he had ever taken pictures of a military

installation.

been an American stationed in Datteln with the US Army. The UIM became

nervous because of John's questioning, excused himself, and left the bar.

Source did not see UIM anymore that evening. Source and John remained

at the Lord Nelson.

The conversation between Source and John returned to

military subjects. John spoke about military subjects with authority and

Source had no knowledge of. Source was unable to recall any of the specifics

and at one time asked John if he knew about the XR-71. John became very

interested and asked Source what was the XR-71. Source replied that he was

happened in 1906. Source did not mention the discrepaney to John. John

stated that he had also veen kicked off two or three kasernes in the South,

and that his name was on record. John mentioned being caught and interrogated

on a site in Southern IRG. Source was unable to recall the exact identi-

fication of the agency John claimed to have been interrogated by, but

mentioned that it was something like MA, MD, MI, MAD, MAI.

John said he

had been released after the interrogation and followed, but that he had

managed to lose the people who were following him. John mentioned that

he had paced off Haard Kaserne and knew exactly where and how to get on to

the kaserne without being detected. Source and John left the Lord Nelson

at 0300 hours and went to another bar in Datteln.

Source thought the name of

the bar was the Kessin (PHONETIC), but was not sure.

Upon arriving at the

Kessin, John said that he had to pick up his pay check from the owner of the

bar and left Source.

John and the owner of the bar went into a private office

for about five minutes before John returned.

The owner of the Kessin also

owned the lord Nelson and Western.

Source and John left the Kessin at 430

hours and proceeded by taxi to John's apartment, which was located above the

Western. John stated that if Source did not believe everything that he had

said, that Source could contact an Air Force Security Sergeant and confirm

everything. John gave source a slip of paper (EXHIBIT, on which was the

name of the security Sergeant, his job title, station, and telephone numbers.

John stated that if source mentioned or showed the paper to anyone that it

would get the Security Sergeant into trouble. John also hinted that bodily

harm might result to source it the paper got into the wrong hands. John

gave Source an old US Air Force parka to wear back to the kaserne because it

was cold and Source's own jacket was light weight. In the pockets of the

parka were four beer coasters, (EXHIBITS_

Source for 1700 hours, 5 February 1972, at the Stadtschaenke Bar, Datteln.

John gave a slip of paper (EXHIBIT) to Source with the information for the

next meeting. John asked Source to obtain any information on Julius mentioned

by UIM, that he could. John mentioned that he had known Cristobal Pimentel-

Davilla and asked Source to obtain some C-Rations for him.

Source then left

John and returned to his unit.

Source did not believe that he had supplied

any official information to John, but felt that it was possible that he might

have as he was quite drunk before

the evening ended. Source described

John as follows: Six to six feet one inch tall, weighing 180-190 pounds,

slight build, black hair with long sideburns, and wore a red shirt with a

navy blue coat and tie, black shoes, long black overcoat and black fur hat.
