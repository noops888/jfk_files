clear.

According to the informant, FAUGNO had apparently

talked to MARTIN SCHINDLER, who is operating the Cabana Club,

and was advised that the club is $25,000 in debt and SARUBBI,

who holds the original lease, is threatening to foreclose.

According to NK 2381-C-TE, ZICARELLI personally guaranteed

the $185,000 debt.

Informant further stated that FAUGNO

wanted KONIGSBERG

"hit" in the jail now.

ZICARELLI has also

threatened to have KONIGSBERG "hit," but does not want him "hit"

at the present time.

On 11/5/64, NK 2381-C-TE advised that AL BRAWER

contacted ARMAND FAUGNO at FAUGNO's headquarters located

behind the Duncan Truck Stop, 376 Duncan Avenue, Jersey City,

N.J.

According to informant,

FAUGNO told BRAWER that he had

$285, 000 invested in the Cabana Club and had two partners

in this venture. He fuither stated that in addition to the

$25,000 in debts that ZICARELLI had been told existed, there was

an additional $19,000 in liens, withholding taxes and other

debts that had to

be paid off.

N.J

The informant advised that HAROLD KONIGSBERG

recently wrote a letter to JOSEPH ARTHUR ZICARELLI in which

he stated that TONY PROVENZANd and his brother, as well as a

man named LALA, had an interest in the Cabana Club.

TONY PROVENZANO is probably identical to ANTHONY

X PROVENZAND, President of Local 560, International Brotherhood

of Teamsters (IBT).

• "LALA" IS probably Identical to RALPH

SPINETIA, who has been described as a top Leutenant in

FAUGNO's numbers shylocking operation.

Records of the Critani Savings and Loan Association,

3ut Main Street, Hackensack, N.J., were made available to SA BRYAN
