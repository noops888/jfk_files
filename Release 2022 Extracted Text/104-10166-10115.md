aboard the M/V TEJANA.

A POA was requested on

6.

From the time he cane to the U.S. in 1960 until he was ar-

rested by the Cuban Government, CUESTA was associated with the MRR,

UR, Alpha 66 and Commando L organizations.

The hit and run raids made

by these groups were well-known to all government agencies and, in

fact,

openly known in Miami because of the propensity

of the Cubans

to talk.

There were a number of discussions at the highest level

(President) concerning what should be done about such raids.

They

were not sponsored

by or connected with the U.S. Government.

TwO

of these unauthorized raids are the ones referred to (attempts 21

and 22) in the article attached to Mrs. CUESTA's letter.

the DGI expert on illegal operations against the U.S.!

Mrs. CUESTA legally travelled to Cuba from

via Mexico City, in April 1967 for a two week

risit with her husband.

In June 1967 the FBI advised

JMNAVE Station that she was recruited by the CUIS while

in Cuba and to hold this knowledge to a minimum because

they intended to operate her as a double agent.

She

said the pitch was made on behalf of the DSE and would

benefit both her and her husband.

She was told if she

successfully reported on anti-Castro activities in Miami,

especially Commando L activities,

for a period of six

months, they would release her husband from custody and

after

three years of reporting permit him to leave Cuba.

Her contact in the U.S. was to be Chafik tomero SAKER

be met at the airport in Havana by two cars because of

the excess baggage.

While in Cuba she saw her husband

8.

This case was coordinated with the FBI representative,

via Ops Liaison, on 12 September who asked that we hold up

& re.

sponse

to her letter until he could check out the status uf the case.

It was recognized that Mrs. CUESTA could be acting in behalf of the

DGI.

On 16 September the FBI representative advised that FBI opera-

tional interest in Mrs: CUESTA was terminated circa December 1974

and that 1t would not be recesgary for us to coordinate our responso

to Mrs. CUESTA's letter with the Bureau.
