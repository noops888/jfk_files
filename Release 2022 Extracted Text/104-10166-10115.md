MEMORANDUM FOR: C/LA/COG

SUBJECT : Letter from Mrs. Lourdes CUESTA, Ex-wife of
Antonio CUESTA Valle, Formerly of Interest to
JMWAVE Station

1, Lourdes CUESTA, ex-wife of Antonio CUFRSTA Valle, currently
imprisoned in Cuba, wrote to the Director of CIA on 4 August 1975.
She requested that the Agency “give her some kind of verification
that her ex-husband was not connected nor the CIA had any knowledge
that he was preparing the raids mentioned in Attempts No. 21 and 22"
cited in a 31 July 1975 Miami Herald newspaper article following
Senator McGovern's recent trip to Visit Fidel CASTRO. ;

2. <A carefully worded reply was prepared for signature by an -
assistant to the DCI; however, per instruction of the DC/LAD (from
the DDO) it was requested that the letter not be sent, but rather
that a DCD representative in Miami handle the matter with Mrs.
CUESTA personally.

3. a DCD representative in Miami contacted Mrs. CUESTA and
told her that the Agency preferred that the matter be handled with
@ personal touch rather than by letter, Mra, CUESTA did not accept
this and has subsequently phoned the DCD representative sevoral
times requesting .a written reply. Mrs. CUESTA said that she plans
to send a copy of the reply to Fidel CASTRO and one to Senator
McGovern. According to the DCD representative Mrs. CUESTA (a nat-
uralized U.S. citizen of Spanish birth) works for a lawyer (name
unknown) and perhaps is following legal.counael, Cieseanaess

4. On 11 September 1975 the AC/LA/COG phoned the DC/LAD and
advised him of the foregoing. ‘oilowing the conversation it was
decided that we would check out applicable maritime records in
Archives, in addition to CUBSTA's 201 file, and if we still un-
covered no evidence that CUESTA was involved with CIA in the cited
infiltration operations, draft a very brief lotter of. acknowledge-
ment to Mrs, CUESTA and resubmit it for approval.

S. Antonio CUESTA came to the U.S. from Cuba on 31 May 1960
as a refugee. According to his 201 file, he has had the following 4
U.S. Government association: eo. od
a. As, of February 1961 he was cited as a crewman ¥
aboard the M/V TEJANA, A POA was requested on 15 March a ? .
1961 for his use in PM maritime ops as a ‘crewman on the ”
vessel TEJANA under Project JMATE. Due. to cessation of + ¢
JMATE activities, processing of the clearance was sus- 4
ended on 1 May 1961 until ne. interest was apparent. can i
} IAVE Station advised the Army of CIA operational inter- , ‘ .
i est in CUESTA on 26 May 1962. JMWAVE advised Headquarters i
i on $ June 1962 that CUESTA was not then being used and t \
| requested the basis of other Agency interest. There is : acai
H no indication in pertinent maritime files or his 201 file feuaie A
H that ne was ever used on an operational mission by CIA.

6. From the time he came to the U.S. in 1960 until he was ar-

' rested by the Cuban Government, CUESTA was associated with the MRR,
UR, Alpha 66 and Commando L organizations. The hit and run raids made
by these groups were well-known to all government agencies and, in
fact, openly known in Miami because of the propensity of the Cubans
to talk. There were a number of discussions at the highest level
(President) concerning what should be done about such raids. They
were not sponsored by or connected with the U.S. Government. Two
of these unauthorized raids are the ones referred to (attempts 21
and 22) in the article attached to Mrs. CUESTA's letter.

~ 9, Mrs. CUBSTA was born 21 May 1936. in Madrid, Spain. As of
30 March 1963 she was married to Antonio CUESTA, had one small son,
and reportedly resided with Antonio in Miami, Florida. She current-
ly refers to him as her ex-husband, but particulars of a separation
or divorce are unknown. She is also known as Mrs. Maria Viza CUESTA,
Maria Luise Viza Blanco and Mrs. Vincente CISTA. Following are
items of interest: if

b. Mrs. CUESTA told the FII in 1969 that she ar-

rived in the U.S. 9 June 1963 at Miami, florida.
c. ACSI sdvised JMWAVE Sta a

that she had been in contact (date unknown
Hiomero SAKER Zenni of the New York Cuba UN Missio

The FEY was advised of this and monitored her activities. .
{SAKER is a known long-time DGI officer PNG'd from the
U.S. in 67/68 for support to Black Panther and SDS ac-
tivities. He was DGI Chief cf Center in Mexico City
from 70-73, one of the founding fathers of the DGI and : 7
the DGI expert on illegal operations against the U.S.) 1 :

d. Mrs. CUESTA legally travelled to Cuba from
Miami, via Mexico City, in April 1967 for a two week
visit with her husbend. In June 1967 the FBI advised
JMWAVE Station that she was recruited by the CUIS while
in Cuba and to hold this knowledge to a minimum because’
they intended to opesate her as a double agent. She
said the pitch was made on behalf of the DSE and would
benefit both her and her husband. She was told if she
successfully reported on anti-Castro activities in Miami,
especially Commanco L activities, for a period of six
months, they would release her husband from custody and
after three years of reporting permit him to leave Cuba.
Her contact in the U.S. was to be Chafik Homero SAKER
Zenni.

e. Mrs. CUESTA travelled to Cuba from Miami via
Mexico City again on 9 February 1968 taking nine suit-
cases. She called Havana from Mexico City and asked to
be met at the airport in Havana by two cars because of
the excess baggage. While in Cuba she saw her husband
Pevent times. She returned to Mexico City on 4 March

&. This case was coordinated with the FBI representative,

via Ops Liaison, on 12 September who asked that we hold up a re-
sponse to her letter until he could check out the status uf the case.
ft was recognized that Mrs. CUESTA could be acting in behalf of the
DGI. On 16 September the FBI representative advised that FBI opera
tional interest in Mrs. CUESTA was terminated circa December 1974
wand that 1t «ould not be necessery for us toe coordinate our response
ta Mrs. CUESTA's letter with the Bureau. Details of the FBI opera-
ti oval handling of Mrs. CUESTA are unknown, The FBI representative
