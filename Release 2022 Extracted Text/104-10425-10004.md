dated 15 March 1985.

Enclosure:

First CIA Release to Lesar,

F81-0351 (I) (U)

B .

Memorandum, dated 22 July 1985,

from E. Page Moffett.

The writer of the memorandum (see reference B)

states in

paragraph 2 that Lesar called the former's attention to a

document listed in three places in the enclosure to reference

Lesar claimed that much more of

this document had been released previously to Robert e.

Borosage.

2.

The document in question, handwritten, undated,

the title "Project ZRRIFLE" had been released previously in

sanitized form as. JFK Exhibit F-522 in Volune IV (pages 197-

203) of the HSCA Final Report (1979). The sanitization of the

03471, conformed

when this sanitization was made (in late 1978 or early 1979)

it was not known

that the ZRRIFLE document was one of several

documents (81 to be exact) that were the subject of a litiga-

tion involving Robert L. Borosage and the Agency. (U)

To confirm the validity

of Lesar's claim, the undersigned

reviewed the Robert L. Borosage Case No. F75-0676.

The Agency's

file did indeed contain a copy of the 9-page ZRRIFLE document

(number 42).

The undersigned then reviewed the computer run

describing the contents of the Borosage case file.

The entry

for document no. 42 gives no date and no subject. It describes

the document only as a manuscript.

Inasmuch as the document had

been inadequately

identified in the computer system, it did not

turn up in response to a querry to the computer for any previous

releases of the ZRRIFLE document. (U)

4. The undersigned compared the "Borosage release" with the

document sanitized for the HSCA.

There is a great deal of dif-

not all of it to the Agency's advantage.

The sanitization

of the "Borosage

release" was done in a slipshod

manner, e.g., on

page 6 of the document as released to Borosage

The undersigned has. sanitized a copy of the ZRRIFLE document

as it was released to Robert L. Borosage and has included any

information released to the HSCA that was deleted in the Borosage

release. The attached ZRRIFLE document may be passed to Lesar.
