We have assembled all the material Immedately available at headquarters

that fulfills the request contained in the reference wader Identities B and C.

list of the material is forwarded as Separate Cover Attachment 1 to this dispatch

and the material Itself as Separate Cover Attachment 2.

2. We have broken Separate Cover Attachment 1 down Into categories (1) and

You will note in going over the items that we have not been too successful

In f1lling your Identity C request, especially In category (1).

We found several

items in category (2) from PBPRIME sources and we have hopes of obtaining

some

from English and French sources. However, it has been explained to fus that cate-

gory (1) just does not provide a large enough market to make worthwhile the type of

promotional material you wish to pass to INDEVOUI-3.

We wish to call your attention, however, to a company in Suisse that con-

piles material of the type you want, on any subject, to order.. The compary 1s well

known and is used by institutions and Inulviduals throughout the world, including

KUBARK. SInce INDEVOUT-3 could have heard of this company from any number of

sources, you may wish to pass the name to him and lét him place an order that will

fill the gaps in the material we are sending you. The name and address of the com-

pany 18 forwarded as Separate Cover Attachment 3.
