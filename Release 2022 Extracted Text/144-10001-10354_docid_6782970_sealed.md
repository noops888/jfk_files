President JOHN F. KENNEDY fell in the performance of his

distinguished duties in the service of the most noble causes.

He was a remarkable promoter of tha friendship which unites

peoples in devotion to and the defense of liberty, in their

will for co-operation and peace, and in the pursuit of their

joint aims. In the belief that history will pay him this

homage, I beg you, Me. President, to accept the deeply felt

condolences which

I offer in the name of the Provisional

Government and in my own name and to extend them to the United

States Govemment and the American people, with whom we have

a profound faeling of solidarity in this tragedy.
