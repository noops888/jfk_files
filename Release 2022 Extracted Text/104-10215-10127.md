between 0800 =. 0945 hours, During. Subject's entire stay ‘in Mexico,
he woe seen most often in the company of Subject of 201-261813,
Per AEMIDRIFF information, coupled with information available in
Btation files, it is believed that Subject of .201-261813 possibly
functions. as one of the Deputy Rezidents of the AEGRIP Residentura
in Mexico City. It is probable that Subject of 201-261813 was the
,Moxico City AEGRIP cago officer in this particular case, Subject's

“other contacts were. Subjects of. 201-850177 and 201-844388, both
identified by AEMIDRIFF as AEGRIP officers, and possibly could have
boon involved in the case as Support officers. Subject was also
in contact with Subject of 201-814235, who is an. AEGRIP officer,

3. Subject was not seen‘at the Soviet Embassy on 14 March,
which was the originally echeduled meeting date with: the LNEASE
agont. On Buoday, 15 March, LILYRIC reported that Subject entered
the Soviet Embassy at 1143 hours and was seen leaving, alone, at

32 hours. There was no LIEMPTY source coverage on 28 March 1970,
which was supposed to be the alternate meeting date with the agent,

1. Forwarded under separate cover are copies of several
momoranda prepared by Station officers who have more than superficial
. Contact with Soviets in Mexico City. By virtue of joining various 7
organizations such as ANCOSAD (association of diplomata below the
prank of Ambassador) and the Consular -Corps Association (or by
being invited to functions sponsored ‘by the latter group), half a
‘dozen Station officers have. had a wide range of contacts with
MHHARSHers.” In many inati such contacts have been one-time
affairs, but in eome cas: th some promise of a continuing
relationship whicb could be of Lt in the Station's ope-ational
Program, Most of these contacts are in the early stages, and most
will remain at a fairly quiet level, In. sone cases, however,

- contacts are with MHHARSHers who are
or who might soon find themselves on
AEJALISCO, AEPOLYP, and 201305870.
these targets are encouraged to keep

on our priority target list,

Case officers in touch with
the relationship alive as ‘part

-ofthe overall strategy planned against each target. And, in the
case of those who are. not targeta, an existing relationship with
one of them might be parlayed into a relationship with one of the
targets,

This conscious effort to make contact with’ MHHARSHers was -

a snag, however, in the wake of the AcMIDRIFF defection, and
pessibly also due to the operation. against AESHASICK: : In most
cases, our MHHARSH friends have suddenly hecome: inaccessible.
There wore three functions of. the Consular Corps, including the
annual election of officers, within about two weeks of ALMIDRIFF's
defection and subsequent press conference (which, took some cracks

at the members of the MHHARSH consular: section, indicating that.
they spent 90 percent of their time. doing intelligence work and

very little time issuing visas). The MHJIARSH representation in the
Consular Corps Association had always been a strong one, and one o%
their-people was oormally an officer (formerly AEDIHHARD, more
recently 201-305870). However, none of them attended any of these;
functions, including the elections,. 201 05870, a consular officer,
bad ab invitation to the. home of Dexter XOSTEDT on 13.March,

Not only did he not show up, ROSTEDT was never able to get hina _
the phone to confirm'the invitation: A January volleyball match
between the MHHARSH Mabassy and LNPURE was supposed to have been
followed by return engagements. °201-305870 was in charge of this,
and he has. suddenly. lost interest ‘in the follow-up. ‘On the other
hand, the MHHARSHere who belong to ANCOSAD have behaved more normally,
AEJALISCO, the MHHARSH representative on the ANCOSAD board of
directors, took part. in an excursion to Baja California: 28 February
{no LNPUHE.orticers went) and was present with a half-dozen of his
colleagues at the AMCOSAD annual election lunch on 19 March,

(At.the 19 March affair, AEJALISCO was uncharacteristically nervous,
‘ but. would not say what was bothering him, It will be*noted that

the AESEASICK operation reached its denouement the night before.)

3. In support of the evidence above. that tho MRHARSHers. have
Bone into their shell; at least to sone extent, as a result of.
AEMIDRIFF's defection, LIBACON-1 has reported that a TDY technician
with whom he had been working as a translator, told him that it
Was .now much more difficult to get avay to go out on the town with
.LIBACON-1. When asked why, he said it-was due to AEMIDRIFF, "who :
really s--- on us, even we [TDYers} are being watched." In general, ;
the line given out by MHMRSHers.asked about AEMIDRIFF's defection
sticks to the story that. she was just.a dumb secretary. who fell
in love with a Mexican. She aot only knows nothing, she will
probably be very sorry she ever had anything to do with that Latin
Lover, i: ; + :

4 It. is probable that the. MHHARSHers will. slowly come out

of their shells and will begin to circulate once more. - If so, the
Station's policy of supplementing the SB operational program with
Personal contacts will continue, and, as stated, will concentrate

on obtaining this type of contact with the selected targets. In

thie way, our meat and knowledge of the target. can be supplement-
ed by @ case of. 8 expert assessment. Headquarters will be

kept advised of d lopments.

5. This dispatch was in preparation. when Reference B arrived.
The assessuents of AEJALISCO and: 201-305870, requested in Reference
B, are included in tho attachment. PCQs have been filled out in
ain instances, and a batch on AEJALISCO will be forwarded
shortly, The Spanish-language PCQ's-promised in Reference B will

SUBJECT; Vincent P, RIZZUTO's Soviet Contacts

Largely through the medium of AMCOSAD, RIZZUTO has met a
number of Soviets, With many it is little more than a nodding
acquaintance, but with some it is a little deeper than that,
The latter are discussed below, It should be pointed out, that each
of these Soviets is very likely aware of .RIZZUTO'’s RVROCK affiliation,

ALT Valentin V._BAKULIN (2O1=25 TTS y - RIZZUTO has known
‘him for over two years. BAKULIN is. a smooth-talking, smooth~appearing
diplomat, He speaks excellent Spanish, but has never been known to
italk about anything more controversial than the weather, the landscape,
or his family. His wife is a pleasant wuman, but she rarely
accompanies him on excursions, He has.a teen-aged son of whom he
is very proud, -The son visited him in the summer of 1969, and the
gon exhibited a pretty. good working knowledge of. English, which he
had been stu:lying in school in Moscow. BAKULIN appears to be a
bit of a hypochondriac. He complains often of stomach ailments,
and for this reason rarely takes a. drink (at least. in public).
In spite of his good Spanish and his very presentable appearance,
he does not seem to mix much with non-Soviets, In common with
most of’his colleagues (notably excepting Boris A. CHMYKHOV and

“Boris A. KAZANTSEV), BAKULIN seems to prefer the company of his

sn people, and does not go out of his way to talk to others.
“When he is approached, he is very aftable, He never talks about his.
‘job (he is one of the First Secretaries but does not appear to have
‘any overt job), but did say once that he and CHMYKHOV could not. go
on home leave at the same time because one had to cover foy the
other. AMCOSAD functions appear to provide theonly occasion for.

* BAKULIN to appear in public, When'RIZZUTO has been to functions at

the Soviet Rnbassy, BAKULIN has always been the proper host -- polite

and hospitable, The real BAKULIN never shows through. Since he is
a neighbor (same floor of same apartment building) as well as
frequent companion of CHNYKHOV, he is undoubtedly aware of the
relationship between RIZZUTO and CHMYKNMOV, and he stays out of it,
i heterrkta on purpose, ° .

B. Yuriy CHERNYSH (201-825743) - RIZZUTO has met CHERRYSH

only three times, the firs two meetings being well over a year apart.

However, oll meetings resulted in relatively lengthy cenversations.
CHERNYSH ade no bones about getting, RIZZUTO's name correctly
(most Soviets do not seem to bother and usually act as if they do
mot remember the name), He will talk, intelligently, about almost
any topic, controversial or not. He is very intense, as if he is
working hard to. remember everything that was said, and every quirk

DAT@ OF MEETING : 27 February 1969

~1. In response to a phone call from Subject, I met
him from 1515 to 1545 qt his hotel... - - —- oe
2, Subject told me that he's on. the verge of bankruptcy
and that this time He's not kidding. He has been unable to

pay his employees their full wages and, recently, the news-
papers have begun attacking him as a foreigner, exploiter

of workers, etc, He seemed exceptionally cheery in spite of
the gloomy prospects and I indicated that I feel sure He'll
figure a way out of his problems, His one possibility is to

“get the money he needs from "Baby" but the price is too ——
high: him. "Baby" would like Subject’to divorce his wife
which he refuses to do, :

3. ‘The main thing on Subject'ts mind was that he had
a visit from Valentin BAKULIN (P- G OS ) on Saturday,

22 February, at the factory. BAKULIN brought Subject a
bottle of vodka and he bought about $600 (pesos) worth of
“Subject's products to send back to the USSR. He apparently

_ sent some previously and. he said they went. over so well

“+ that he wanted more, BAKULIN’came with his wifé and with

couldn't understand why the quality 4s so bad considering

had mentioned once before, i.e., Subject's interest in seeing

some of Subject 's grandfather's music presented in Mexico.
