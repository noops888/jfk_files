is-a long-time cohort of Frank Anthony STURGIS (SF#353 459),

aka: Frank FIORINI, of Watergate notoriety who also has a
long-time’ record of falsely claiming Agency affiliation. In

the late 1950's HEMMING and STURGIS, both former U.S. Marines,
joined Fidel CASTRO in Cuba but returned shortly thereafter
tlaiming disillusionment with the CASTRO cause. Soon thereafter,
STURGIS organized a group of mercenaries for Caribbean and
Central American activities which he named the International

(the backers of whom have never been fully established) was
named the Intercontinental Penetration Force, headed by Gerald
Patrick HEMMING.

9, For an appreciation of the possible: ramifications of

publicity in 1967 when New Orleans District Attorney "Jim"
GARRISON alleged that HALL (and the Intercontinental Penetration
Force) was involved in the assassination of President KENNEDY
sand that. members of this unit were connected with CIA, GARRISON
shortly thereafter dropped his interest in HALL, but it is
