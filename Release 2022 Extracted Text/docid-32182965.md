OSWALD prior to the assassination of President JOUN I. KENNEDY.

reside or

pay any visits to the northern border area of Souor. around

Cananea.

to the Presidential candidate teared he would encounter a large

amount of opposition and even violence in Cananes and they so

advised him to cancel his visit.

He said that this was bad

advice on their part because wthing of this sort would have

happened in the Cananea area.

NICOMEDES GARCIA GOMEZ

The informant avised that be has never heard of

anyone by this name and could furnish no information con.

cerning such an individual.
