Arrangements have been rscently completed allowing certain :
. Independent contractors of this organization to obtain sucial security : a
. credits by covering such individuals under the social security tax i
provisions applicable to employees. These arraagemente also include 3
“a provision for retroactive applicability to the beginning of the caaea }
1965 tax year. This can be done only for reasons of security since A
the procedure results in reducing the social security tax fromthe ==. i
lies self-employed rate to the employee rate. For example, in January
of 1965 the tax rates were 5. 4h and 5-5/8h respectively.

av

Ae @ consequence thereof, exid contract is amended by deleting
. all reference to cocial security and by adding the following paragraph:

° “Effective ! December 1964, social security taxes will be
“ - deducted by this organization from your compensation th the same
manner and to the same extent as would be done If you were a Govern-
ment employee. Security reasons make this procedure necessary. Its
implementation doee not imply in any manner the actual creation of an-
“ employee-employer relationship, Your legal etatus under thie agree-
ment continues to be that of an independant contractor.”

If you receive or expect to receive full or partial social security.
credits from overt scurces you will so notify this organization and an

adjustmant will be made or| \iscontinued, depending
upon the circumstances. Further, if you should subsequently receive
overt social security credits, evidence thereof will be submitted to this
