MEMORANDUM

in1s reconstruction of Agency Involvement in plans to

assassinate Fidel Castro 1s at best an imperfect history. Because

of the extreme sensitivity of the operations being discussed or

attempted, as a natter of principle no official records were kept

of plarning, of approvals, or of Implementation. The few written

records thai do exist are either largely tangential to the main

events or were put on paper from memory years afterward. William

Harvey bas retained skeletal notes of his activities during the

years in question, and they are our best source of dates.. Dr.

Edward Gunn, Of the Office of Medical Services, has a record of

whon he set and when and cryptic references to the subjects discussed.

Ray Treichler, of TSD, has a record of two or three dates that are

pertinent. Gunn and Treichler were Involved 11 only the technical

aspects of operational planning, and their participations were short-

Ired. Although fragmentary, their records are a help in establishing

critical time frames. Operational files are useful in some instances,

because they give dates of meetings, the substances of which may be

Inferred fron collateral Information.

For the most part, though, we have had to rely on inforation

given to us orally by people whose memories are fogged by time.

Their recollections of dates are particularly hazy, and soue of then

are no longer able

to keep the details of one plan separate from shore

of another. He intervieved everyone whon we could identlfy as likely

to be knowledgeable, with the exceptions of Mr. Dulles and General

Cabell. A complete list is attached at Tab A. He did not go on

fishing expeditions among the mere possibles. To have done so would

have risked making witting a number of employees who were previously

unwitting and, in our estimate, would have added little to the details

avallable fron those directly involved. There are inconsistencies

among the varlous accounts, but most of them can be resolved by

collating the information furnished by all of the identifiable

participants in a perticuler plan and by then checking It against

specific dates that can be fixed with fair certainty. We telleve

that this reconstruction of what happened and of the thinking

associated with it 1s reasonably sound. If there are significant

Inaccuracies in the report, they are nost likely to occur in faulty

ordering of the sequence of events. People still remember much of

what happened, but they can no longer recall precisely when.

It became clear very early in our investigation that the vigor

with which schemes were pursued within the Agency to eliminate Castro

personally varied with the intensity of the U.S. Goverment's efforts

to overtbrow the Castro regime. We can identify five separate phases

In Agency assassination planning, although the transitions from one

to another are not always sbarply defined. Each phase is a reflection

of the then prevalling Goverment attitude tovard the Cucan regime.

a.. Irlor to Auzust 1950: All of the Identiflable schemes

prior to about August 1960, with ose possible exception, vere

sined only at discrediting Castro personally by influencing

his behaviour or by alterine his appearance.

b. August 1960 to April 1961: The plots that were hatched

In iate 1960 and early 19ó1 vere aggressively pursued and vere

rieved by at least sone of the participants as being merely one

aspect of the over-all active effort to overthrow the regime

that culminated in the Bay of Pigs.

.c. April 1961 to late 1961: A major schene that was

begun in August 1960 was called off after the Bay of Pl§s and

rewalned dormant for several months, as did most other Agency

operational activity related to Cuba.

d. Late 1961 to late 1902: Tuat particular scheme was

reactivated in eariy 1952 and vas again pushed vigorously in the

era of Project MONGOOSE and in the climate of intense admini-

stration pressure on CIA to do something about Castro and his.

though, that they are pertinent to the story. Elinination of the

personally rather than to the goverment as a body, vill not

necessarily cause the downfall of the goverament. This polat vas

stressed with respect to Castro and Cuba in an Internal CIA draft

paper of October 1961, bich vas initiated in response to General

Maxwell Taylor's desire for a contirgency plan. The paper took the

position that the demise of Fidel Castro, from whatever cause, would

offer little opportunity for the liberation of Cuba fran Communist

and Soviet Bloc control. The second point, which 1s more specifically

relevant to our lavestigation, 1s that bringing about the downfall of

a goverment necessarily requires the removal of 1t6 leaders fron

1n Secretary Russ's conference room on 10 August 1962 at which

Secretary Mchanara broached the subject of liquidation of

Cuban leaders. The discussion resulted in a Project MONGOOSE

Miscellaneous Schemes Prior to August 1960

We find evidence of at least three, and perhaps four; scheres

that were under consideration.well before the Bay of Pigs, but ve

can fix the time frame only speculatively. Those who have some

knowledge of the episodes guessed at dates ranglog from 1959 through

ultness on general timing.. He may not bave been privy to the

precise details of any of the plans, but he seems at least to

have known of all of them. He is no longer able to keep the

of this sort would have progressed to the point of consideration

of neans until after U.S. policy concerning luca vas decided

upon about March 1960. By about the end of the third quarter

of 1960, the total energies of the tase force were concentrated

on the main-thrust effort, and there would have been no interest

1n nor time for pursuinz such wills-o'-the-visp as these.

He are unable to establish even a tentative sequence among the schemes;

they may, in fact, have been under consideration simultaneously. We.

find no evidence that any of these schemes was approved at any

level higher than division, 1f that. He think 1t most Ilkely that

no higher-level approvals vere sought, because none of the schemes

progressed to the point where approval to launch would bave been

needed.

Aerosol Attack on Radio Station

Ray Treichler, of ISD, remembers discussion of a scheme to

conteminate the air of the radio studio bere Castro broadcast his

speeches with an aerosol spray of a chemical that produces reactions

similar to those of ljjergic acid (ISD). Nothing came of the 1dea.

Treichler said he had discouraged the scheme, because the chemical

could not be relied upon to be effective. Henry Bortner, also of ISD,

fall out. He then said that his cigars might have been associated

witis that plan. Esterline fleally said that, although it was

cigars, he was positive they were not lethal. The cigars were never

the officer, then assigned to Ha/CA, who approached him with the

scheme. Although there may well have been such a plot, the officer

Gottlleb named was then assigned in India and has never worked in

Wi Division nor had anything to do vith Cuba operations. Gottlleb

remembers the scheme as being one that was talked about frequently

but not widely and as being concerned with killing, not nerely with

Influencing behaviour. As far as Gottlieb knows, this idea never

got beyond the talking stage. ISD nay bare gone ahead and prepared

the cigars just in case, but Gottlieb 15 certain that be did not get

the DD/p's (Richard Bissell) personal approval to release them, as vould

have been done 11 the operation had gone thet far. We are unable to

discover whether Esterline and Gottlieb are speaking of e single

cigar episode or of two unrelated schemes. We found no one else with

fim recollections of lethal cigars being considered prior to August

1960.

SECRET-EYES ONLY

Depilator!

Ray Freichler recalle a scheme involving thallium salts, a

chemical used by women as a depilatory--the thought being to destroy

Castro's inage as "The Beardl" by causing the beard to fall out.

The chemical may be administered either orally or by absorption

through the skin. The right dosage causes depilation; too much

produces paralysis. Treichler belleves that the Idea originated in

connection with a trip Castro was to have made outside of Cuba. The

1dea 'i38 to dust thallium powder into Castro's shoes when they were

put out at night to be shined. The schene progressed as far as

procuring tbe chemical and testing it on animels. Treichler's

recollection 1s that Castro did not make the Intendeú trip, and

the scheme fell through. Henry Burtner remembers consideration

being given to use of thallium salts (perbaps against Castro) and

sonething having to do with boots or shoes. Treichler does not

remember with vhom he dealt on this plot. We lound no one else

with firm knowledge of 1t.
