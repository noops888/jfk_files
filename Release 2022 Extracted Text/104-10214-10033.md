Ss. Government's efforts

to overthrow the Castro regime. We can identify five separate phases

in Agency assassination Planning, although the transitions from one .

_ SECRETS pay Sees

orrcncmnrrenssine



to another are not always sharply iefined. Each phase is a reflection

of the then prevailing Government attitude toward the Cuban regime. ©

a. Prior to August 1960: All of the identifiable schenes
prior to about August 1960, with one possible exception, were
aimed only at discrediting Castro personally by influencing
his behaviour or by altering his appearance.

b. August 1960 to April 1961: Tee plots that were hatched
in inte 1960 and early 1961 were aggressively pursued and vere

viewed by at least some of the participants as being merely one

aepect of the over-all active effort to overthrow the regine

that culminated in the Bay of Pigs.

c. April 1961 to late 1961: A major scheme that vas

, begun in August 1960 was called off after the Bey of Pigs and

-_ yemained dormant for several months, as did most other Agency

operational activity related to Cuba.

a. Jate 1961 to late 1962: That particular scheme was
reactivated in early 1952 and vas again pushed vigorously in the
era of Project MONGOOSE and in the climate of intense admini-

stration pressure on CIA to do something about Castro and his .

. Cuba.

e. Late 1962 until well into 1953: After the Cuban missile

erisis of October 1962 and the collapse of Project MONGOOSE, the,



aggressive scheme that vas begun in August 1960.and revived in
April i962 vas finally terminated in early 1963... Two other

“'*plots were originated in 1963, but both vere impracticable
and nothing ever came of them.
-We: cannot overemphasize the extent to vhich recponsible Agency
: ne:
‘officers felt themselves subject to the/administration's severe

; Pressures to do something about Castro and his regime. The fruitless :

“and, in retrospect, often unrealistic plotting should be vieved in
“that light. :

Many-of those’ we interviewed stressed two points that are so

c

‘obvious that recording them here may be superfluous. We believe,
Gu though, that they are pertinent to the story. Elimination of the
‘dominant figure in a goverment, even vhen loyalties are held to him
i \ personally rather than to the goverment as a body, vill not
necessarily cause the downfall of the government. ‘This point was

stressed with respect to Castro and Cuba in an internal CIA draft

paper of October 1961, which was initiated in response to General

Maxwell Taylor's desire for a contingency plan. The paper took the

position that the demise of Fidel Castro, from vhatever cause, would

offer little opportunity for the Liberation of Cubs fram Ccammist
end Soviet Bloc control. The second point, which is more specifically
relevant to our investigation, is that bringing about the downfall of

@ goverment necessarily requires the removal of its leaders from

cause_cne-to.cverlook the killings of a-Diem or of-a Trujillo by
forces encouraged. but not controlled by- the- U.S. Government.

| There 18 a third point, which was not directly made by any of §
those we intervieved, but vhich emerges clearly from the interviews

end from review of files. The point is thet of frequent resort to
synecdoche--the mention of a part vhen the vhole. is to be understood,

or vice versa. Thus, we encounter repeated references to phrases such

a8 "disposing of Castro," vhich may be read in the narrov, literal

sense of assassinating him, vhen it is iniended that it be read in
the broader, figurative sense of dislodging the Castro regine.
Reversing the coin, we find people speaking vaguely of "doing sone-
‘thing about, Castro” vhen 1t 18 clear that what they have specifically

not have actually meant vhat they seemed to say or may not have said aes h,

what they actually meant, they should not be surprised if their oral

shorthand is interpreted differently than vas intended.

~ The suggestion was made to us that operations aimed at the

@ssassination of Castro may have been generated in an atmosphere of

stress in intelligence publications on the possibility of Castrot¢ 22s:



* SECREY-EieS OLY

. @emise and on the reordering of the political structure that would

follov. We reviewed intelligence publications from 1960 through
1966, including ~sionn Intelligence Estimates, Special National
Intelligence Estimates, Intelligence Memorandums, and Memoranduss
for the Director. The NIE's on "The Situation and:Prospects in Cube”
“for 1960, 1963, and 1964 have brief paragraphs on likely successor

governnents if Castro were to depart the scene. We also find similar

short references in a SNIE of March 1950 and in an Intelligence

Memorandua of May 1965. In each case the treaiment is no more nor

‘ Jess than one vould expect to find in comprehensive round-ups euch

fas these. We conclude that there. 1s no reason to believe that the
Cc operators vere unduly influenced by the content of intelligence
publications.
oe a Drev Pearson's column of 7 March 1967 refers toa reported CIA
Plan in 1963 to assassinate Cuba's Fidel Castro. Pearson also has

information, as yet unpublished, to the effect that there vas a

meeting at the State Department at vhich assassination of Castro
“vas @iscussed and that,a team actually landed in Cuba vith pills to
be used in an assassination attempt. There is basis in fact for each

Bad : a. A‘CIA officer passed en assassination weapon to an

b. There was a meeting of the Special Group (Augnented) e é ’

Secretary McNamara broached the subject of liquidation of

Cuban leaders. The discucsion resulted in a Project MONGOOSE ieee ie

into perspective; and reveals, tat while the events described by

Drew. Pearson did occur and are subject to being patched together ~~ “*

as though one complete story, the implication of a direct, causative acre |
relationship among them is unfounded.



“March to August’ 1960

We find evidence of at least three, and perhaps four, schenes

that vere under consideration well before’ the Bay of Pigs, but ve

“ean fix the time frame only speculatively. Those who have some ; 3

knovledge of the episodes guessed at dates ranging from 1959 through :
1962. The March-to-August span ve have fixed may be too narrow, but
it best. fits the limited evidence ve have.

eee iateerres eutuSteDter a. None of those ve interviewed vho was first assigned to

the Cuba task force after the Bay of Pigs knovs of any of these
{ schemes. ;
i ; a a. ae _ bs J.D. (Jake) Esterline, vho vas head of the Cuba tack
: force in pre-Bay of Pigs days, is probably the most reliable :
Witness on general tining. He may not have been privy to the
“precise details of any of the plans, but he seems at least to

ave known of all of them. He is no longer able to keep the

@etails of one plan separase from those of another, but each of the

facets he recalis fits somevhere into one of the schemes. Bence,

: . we conclude that ell of these schenes vere under consideration

while Esterline had direct responsibility for Cuba operations.

c. Esterline himself furnishes the best clue as to the

SFURET-EVES HUY



pocsible tine span. He thinks it unlikely that any planning

of this sort would have progressed to the point of consideration
of means until after U.S. policy concerning Cuta wus decided
upon about March 1960. By about the end of the third quarter
of 1960, the total energies of the tase force vere concentrated
on the main-thrust effort, and there would have been no, interest
i 4n nor time for pursuing such wills-o'-the-visp as these.
We are unable to establish even a tentative sequence among the schenes;

++. they may, in fact, have been under consideration simultaneously. We.
Ty _ find no evidence that any of these schemes vas spproved at any
level higher than division, if that. We think it most likely that

~ mo higher-level approvals vere sought, because none of the schemes

progressed to the point vhere approval to launch vould have been H

needed.

Aerosol Attack on Radio Station : E

{ . Ray Treichler, of TSD, remembers discussion of a scheme to

contaminate the air of the radio studio vhere Castro broadcast his : i

speeches with an aerosol spray of a chemical that produces reactions i

similar to those of 1,sergic acid (LSD). Nothing came of the idea.

Treichler said he had discouraged the scheme, because the chemical

could not be relied upon to be effective. Henry Bortner, also of TSD,

of this plot, with the possible exception of Jake Esterline vho

may have it confused with other schemes.
Contaminated Cigars

i Jake Esterline claims to have had in his Possession in pre-Bay

7 of Piga days a box of cigars that had been treated with some sort
of chemical. In our first interview with him, his recollection vas
that. the chemical vas intended to produce temporary personality

@isorientation. The thought was to somehow contrive to have Castro -
‘moke one before making a speech and then to make a public spectacle

of himcelf. Esterline distinctly recalis having had the cigars in
J - his personal safe until he left WH/% and that they definitely were

intended for Castro. He does not remember how they came into his

possession, but he thinks they must have been prepared by Ray Treichler.

In a second interview with Esterline, ve mentioned that ve had leamed

since first speaking with him of a scheme to cause Castro's beard to
fall out. He then said that his cigars might have been associated

“with that plan. Esterline finally said that, although it vas

evident that he no longer remembered the intended effect of the

cigars, he was positive they were not lethal. The cigars were never

: E used, according to Ecterline, because WH/% coula not figure oiit how
ees to deliver then without danger of blovback on the Agency. He says’

“he destroyed them before leaving WH/% in June 1961.
Sidney Gottlie, of TSD, claims to renember distinctly a plot
involving cigars. To emphasize the clarity of his memory, he named

‘the officer, then assigned to WH/CA, vho approached him vith the

scheme. Although there may well have been such a plot, the officer

Gottlieb named was then assigned in India and has never vorked in

WH Division nor had anything to do with Cuba operations. Gottlieb

emembers the scheme as being one that was talked about frequently

: C but not videly and as being concerned with killing, not merely vith
Z influencing behaviour. As far as Gottlieb knovs, this {dca never

got beyond th talking stage. SD may have gone ahead and prepared

the cigars just in case, but Gottlieb is certain that be afd not get
