Information Bulletin Nr. 51, 26 November 1963.

I. Washington, 24 November

After JOHNSON's first meeting with members, of government and congress an

even more general opinion [25-50M] internal will be continued by him in

principle, although by different methods. .It is believed that the role of

RUSK and the State Department will grow greater. JOHNSON is to assure

MIKOYAN that he will follow KENNEDY's line.

MIKOYAN's presence [at the funeral]

is evaluated as KhRUShchEV's gesture of good will and his intention to follow

the same policy toward the USA [25-50M] DE GAULLE:

the wish. to take advan-

tage of JOHNSON's inexperience to play the role of a man of providence and

solidarity with the USA.

B. JOHNSON will concentrate on consolidating his position in the party

and country. He assumes that he will be a candidate in the elections. In

both parties [25-50M] is expected. The Republicans believe that their chances

have improved.

II. New York, 25 November. (Information received from

The struggle on the political implication of the assassination continues

between the right and groups close to KENNEDY. It will probably pass to the

foreign and domestic policies of the new president. Even though the right

was unable to raise anti-Communist feelings in the nation and thus force

JOHNSON's immediate abandonment of the KENNEDY line, it is, however, widening

its influences. Its. representatives in Congress began an open attack of

KENNEDI's policy of looking for agreements with the Soviet Union, and thus

emphasized the hope that 'JOHNSON will not be such a "green politician."

Western European and Scandiravian delegations with whom we talked avoided all

speculations on the outcome of the meetings with MIKOYAN, DE GAULLE and ERHARD.

III. Berlin, 24 November.

According to United States Armed Forces Radio in Berlin, a state of full

alert of the Bundeswehr was announced in the FRG on 23 November after KENNEDY's

assassination.

The tone of the FRG propaganda was sad, and in a form not

offensive to the right emphasized that KENNEDY's pólicy was favorable to the

The massive funeral displays were organized only in West Berlin and not

in the FRG.

This discounted KENNEDY's attitude towards West Berlin and is an

attempt "to fall in line with KENNEDY's successor."

Va Rio, 23 November.

According to the embassy the change in the USA shocked political

circles who now expect USA policy towards Latin America to take a turn to the

right.

Bo The domestic situatión is tense. Fear of a crisis with violent

outcomes exists.

The talks were of a probing nature. The differences of opinion: According to

the reverse is desired. ERHARD believed that USA-USSR dialogue was useful

(by maintaining certain borders and concessions from the USSR).

According to

DE GAULLE," the dialogue was not necessary and gave no results.

ERHARD raised

the importance of trade with Socialist countries.

VII. Baghdad, 25 November.

Before the formation of the government, three groups appeared in the

officer corps:

Ao The Nationalists [who] demanded liquidation of the Ba'ath,'

B. [a group which] agreed against the inclusion of the Ba'ath in the

government but without its liquidation,

C. [one which] demanded the inclusion of the Ba'ath in the government.

ARIF announced a non-partisan goverment whose aim is the consolidation of

the nation.

The officers gave him an ultimatum:

Complete the consolidation

in eight weeks or resign, the government will not represent any party, allow

the Ba'athist to take part, release all political prisoners. Ba'ath supporters

defeated the liquidation of the national guard which is only disarmed, the

cadres (20-40M] the nationalists [25-50M]

VIII. Damascus, 23 November.

According to the embassy, HAFEZ's conciliatory tone towards ARIF and his

justification of the events in Iraa is due to his desire to save the Ba'athists

in Irad.

A break with Iraq would indicate a breakdown of. the policy [25-50M]

Syria as well as bringing ARIF closer to NASSBR. From this stem the compli-

to ARIF and strong attacks on NASSER.
