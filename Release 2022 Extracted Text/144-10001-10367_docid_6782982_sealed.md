After JOHNSON's first meeting with members, vf government iand congress an
even more general opinion [25-5¢M] internal will be continued by him in
principle, although by different methods. ,It is believed that the role of
RUSK and the State Department will grow greater. JOHNSON is ‘to assure
MIKOYAN that he will follow KHVNEDY's line. MIKOYAN's presence [at the funeral]
is evaluated as KhRUShchEV's gesture of good will and his intention to follow
the same policy toward the USA [25-5¥M] DE GAULLE: the wish, to take advan-
tage of JOHNSON's inexperience to-play the role of a man of providence and
solidarity with the USA. oe .

Be JOHNSON will coptcentrate on consolidating his position in the party
and country. He assumes that he will be a candidate in the elections. In

foreign and doméstic policies of the new president. Even though the right

was unable té-raise anti-Communist feelings in the nation and thus force
JOHNSON's inmediate abandonment of the KENNEDY line, it is, however, widening
its influences. Its. representatives in Congress began an open attack of
KENNEDY's policy of loeking for agreements with the Soviet Union, and thus
emphasized the hope that ‘JOHNSON will not be such a "green politician."
Western European and Scandinavian delegations with whom we talked avoided all
speculations on the outcome off the meetings with MIKOYAN, DE GAULLE and ERHARD.

III. Berlin, 24 November. ce

According to United States Armed Foreds Radio in Bevin, a state of full
alert of the Bundeswehr was announced in the FRG on 23 November after KENNEDY's
assassination. The tone of the FRG propaganda wag sad, and in a form not
offensive to the right emphasized that KENNEDY's policy was favorable to the
FRG. The massive funeral displays were organized only in West Berlin and not
in the FRG. This discounted KENNEDY's ettitude towards West Berlin and is an
attempt ‘to fall in line with KENNEDY's successor."

DE GAULLE, the dialogue was not necessary and gave no results. ERHARD raised
the importarice of trade with Socialist countries.

According to the embassy, HAFEZ's conciliatory téne towards ARIF and his
justification of the events in Iraq is due to his desife to save the Ba'athists

in Iraq. A break with Iraq vould indicate a breakdown of, the policy [25-50M]
Syria as wel] es bringing ARIF closer to NASSZR. From thi’s stem the compli-
ments to ARIF and strong attacks on NASSER. .
