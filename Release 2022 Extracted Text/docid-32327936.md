Corporation accepted the proposal, At this point, KREITSEK
advised LEVINE that he and GRANELLO would have to furnish a
"Completion Bond" prior to the Sheraton Hotel Corporation signing
any lease to occupy the hotel, LEVINE questioned KREITSEK ‘as to
the identity of possible indiyiduals who would post such a bond,
KREITSEK stated that one JOIpAKETLLY of Jamaica, Queens, NY, had
recently wrote an "Abandonmérit Bona" for the HAiTtenechetr-wren

thousand dollars, According to KREITSEK, LEVINE furnished a

commitment" to issue the bond from Gédoy»Sayan Insurance Co.,

the letter, LEVINE gave KEELLY $40,000,00 at the Waldorf-Astoria
Hotel in NYC and the later furnished LEVINE with.a "letter of
receipt" written on the stationery of the Godoy-Sayan Insuraneé

introduced KEILLY, KRELTSEK told LEVINE to "drop dead",

the fact that he was unable to furnish any information of a
prosecutable nature concerning GRANELLO, this information is not
being included in the details of this report, KREITSEX is in
contact with GRAZIANO on an average of 2 or 3 times a week,
GRAZIANO is known. to be very close to GRANELLO and it is felt
that any disclosure of the aforementioned information, outside
