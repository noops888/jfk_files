Letter from Chairman Stokes of HSCA on

Direct Access to Former Agent in Mexico

SUBJECT

66 JUN 1978

1. Action Requested: That you approve the reconmendation

at paragraph 8, supporting the decision of the DDCI to not

provide the HSCA with direct access to a former clandestine

agent in Mexico, and that you renew to Chairman Stokes the

DDCI's offer to obtain answers to written HSCA questions

addressed to the man.

Background: The letter from Mr. Stokes refers to

two agents; we are aware of only one at issue. Prior to the

visit of the ASCA investigators to Mexico City, they were

advised at the Headquarters Building that CIA could not

assist them in locating or contacting a former agent. The

investigators would be injurious to that responsibility.

He

offered to accept questions for the agent, and stated that he

would personally vouch for the procedures by which the answers

are obtained. Fie emphasized that as a Presidential appointee,

confirmed by

the Congress, he should be trusted in this action,

especially given the nature of the problem. MI. Blakey did

not reiect that offer at that time;

the silence of Chairman

Stokes' letter on the point may indicate that it may not have

been reported to him.

The Chairman's letter discusses commitments by the

Agency, citing its agreement to arrange access to current and

former employees.

There is no explicit commitment to make

agents available to the Committee.

The letter also emphasizes

the Committee's solicitude for the Agency's sensitivities,

contrary to Chairman Stokes' letter, the DCI did not say that.

HSCA investigators could not interview cl agents, but

expressed his strong objections to their doing so, noting that

we could not assist them in this respect.. It may be that

inability to locate the agent in Mexico was as much a consideration

for his not being interviewed as concern for the Agency's

sensitivities.

o. Conclusions: The basic problem of providing direct

access to a clandestine agent goes to the heart of CIA's

relationships with its agents.

7. The DDCI's act involved two considerations. It served

to protect an intelligence source, and at the same time provided

a procedure whereby the information desired by the Committee

can be obtained.

the matter should be presented to Chairman

Stokes in these terms, seeking his agreement to a procedure

based on trust of the personal commitment of Mr. Carlucci to

ensure the integrity of the procedure by which the answers

are obtained.
