2 Mr. Elder. That is correct. He made one extensive trip

) in the accompaniment of Mr. Dulles to visit not only Chiefs

4 || of Station in Europe but also to visit with the heads of

5 I friendly liaison services. He made a trip to the Far East.
6 || The principal point of it was a meeting of the Chiefs of Station
| from the Far East area Seresaseon where, of course, he was

8 briefed extensively.

: $ Mr. Elder. I believe the Far Eastern trip lasted about

E 7 1 10 days. The trip to Europe was about two weeks. They
5 i travelled together. They were not necessarily quartered together.
6 | But they were together for the full working day ana there
? | were usually evening business sessions.
a | Mr. Kirbow. Do you of your own knowledge know if they visite

stations during that

9 | both the Gaerne

il Mr. Elder. No, I do not know that precisely. !

12 Mr. Kirbow. Do you have any reason to think that they

would have avoided those two stations?

WARD & PAUL
P
to

14 Mr. Elder. I can think of no reason to avoid those

is two stations except that they are not major stations.

16 Mr. Kirbow. Were there any records in Mr. McCone's

17 files of the details of the briefings or of other meetings

18 of importance on either of these trips?

19 Mr.‘ Elder. There are records but they are skimpy because
20 he felt that he had no official capacity and no official

21 need for those records.

22 Mr. Kirbow. Would you give us some idea about how deep

23 within the structure at headquarters agency he contacted

410 First Street, S.E., Washington, D.C. 20003,

24 people for any material briefings? }

25 Mr. Elder. He contacted all the deputy directors and
