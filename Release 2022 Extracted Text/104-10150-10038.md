2. Ey 5 July 1956, the fourth fligat, the USSR was aware

of tice purpose of the missions and were taking counter action.

One positive action was the standaow of civil flights mile the

mission aircraft was over the USSR, and a second action which is

believed related is the moving of MIG-19 aircraft inio Erst

Germany and Poland on 7 July 1955. Also MIG-19's were noved

into Hungary at about this time.

3. The perfomance oi the Soviet system on the 5 July mission,

was indeed curious.

While the action evident Inca COMIT 2 U

Soriets had coacluded the essential facts concerning the missions,

I.e., that they were for reconnaissance, that they flew above

*24

feet, and that a penetration as deep as loscow was possible.

procably surmised that the 5 July mission was headed for Moscow when

the track appeared on a northeasterly heading.

The loss of the

target when it entered Soviet territory was probably deliberate and

"red herring" track returning to the west was either a doägo

or a convenience to avoid brosicasting a track for all the system

to see that a "hostile or intruder" as coming over loscow with no

means available to stop it.

This idea is supported by the use

oi a raid nunder assigned in the region just beyona the yoint

In addition, the track mes not

The reporting of the track when it did

By 9 July 1956, in addition to the evident recognition of

the great height of the mission flights, tracking as better and

in gezeral the performance of the warning systen was much improved.

The next day. 10 July 1956, the Soviet air defense warning

systen closed a 3000 mile track with only two short periods oi

confusion or track loss. Altitude reporting was over

with one plot passed

which was only 100 feet off target.

The first eight missions proved that the air defense warning

This was evident fro both the continuity

of track and nost forcefully fron the ELITT date collecied. Some

intercepts of Soviet Bloc radars opsrating in the 3000 Ic/s band were

ostined by project ErIll as follows:
