Subject entered into a variety of short-term business activities, most

of which were characterized by his unorthodox business practices.

looked upon with strong suspicion by several Government agencies,

including the Bureau of Customs and the Federal Bureau of Investigation

for alleged arms smuggling in a number of South American countries,

and Castro assassination schemes. Office of Security records disclose

that Subject is generally categorized as a con man, unscrupulous, a

wheeler-dealer and a promoter of grandiose schemes.

3. In July 1959 Subject apparently volunteered his services to

the Western Hemisphere Diviaion and was seriously considered for

use as an informant on revolutionary activities in Cuba and the

Dominican Republic. During the period that Subject's Operational

October 1959, WH Division decided to drop all operational interest

in the Subject since they became convinced that his real aim in working

for CIA was to use Agency funds to promote his personal interests.
