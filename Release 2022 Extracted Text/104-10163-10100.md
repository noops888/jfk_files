1. As a follow up to conversations between Robert K, TROUCHARD, Terence S.
GRABAMAC and the Office of General Counsél concerning present attenpts to
regain for AMCLATTER-1 hie lost American citizenship, TROUCHARD met
AMCLATTER-1 on 2+ August, TROUCHARD explained that ve vere seeking a bess
for an administrative type of review of his case and needed any recoris vhich
he might nave, such as notices from ODACID concerning his loss of citizen-
ship, notices from his attorneys in his attempts to regain citizenship

end copies of any pertinent correspondence, ‘The objective is to determine if
his citizenship can be restored without his heving to leave the country,
return in en immigrant status, and vait for a period of five years,

2, AMCLATTER-1 stated that he had nothing in writing since he hed to leave
FBRUMEM surreptitiously, He eould only add the following commentary to those
records which were already in ODACID or ODURGE files: According to his
recollection, the paragraph of the Nationality Act (he believes it to be
Section 5) by which he was separated from his citizenship status stated that
before procedure can be taken to remove anyone's citizenship he must have
Prior notification that quch procedure is being contempiated and be allowed
‘to express his side of the question, AMOLATTER-1 states that he vas never
called in to be questioned, but received an after-the-fact notification in
Writing that ‘ce was no longer en American citizen. At this same tise, hove
ever, he states that he vas a constant visitor at ODACID vhere he had worked
in close cooperation with the ODENVY office and his address was 02 record
with ODACID so that he could be reached easily at any tine.

3. The efforts of tue office of General Counsel and ODURGE representatives
in this matter are greatly appreciated.
