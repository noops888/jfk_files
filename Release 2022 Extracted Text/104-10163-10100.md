ABSTRACT

MICROFILM

Restoration of citizenship for AMCLATTER-1

Action Required: For information of office of General Counsel

1.

As a follow up to conversations between Robert K. TROUCHARD, Terence 8.

CRABANAC and the Office of General Counsel concerning present attenpts to

regain for AMCLATTER-1 his lost American citizenship, TROUCHARD met

ANCLATTER-1 on 24 August. TROUCHARD explained that we were seeking a babis

for an administrative type of review of his case and needed any records which

he might nave, such as notices from ODACID concerning his loss of citizen-

Bhip, notices

from his attorneys in his attempts to regain citizenship

and copies of any pertinent correspondence.

Ine objective is to deteraine 11

his citizenship can be restored ulthout his having to leave the country,

return in an lumigrant status, aid valt for a period of five years.

2.

ANCIATTER-I stated that he had nothing in uriting since he bed to leave

PRRUMEN surreptliously. He could only add the folloving commentary to those

records which were already in ODACID or ODURGE files:

recollection, the paragraph of the Nationality Act (he belleves 1t to be

section 5) by which he was separated fron his citizenship status stated that

before procedure can be taken to renove anyone's citizenabip he nist have

prior notification that such procedure in being contemplated and be all red

to express his side of the question.

AMCLATTER-1 states that he vas never

called 1n to be questioned, but received an after-the-fact notification in

volting that lie vus no longer an American citizen. At this same thoe, hou-

ever, he states that he vas a constant visitor at ODACID there he had vorked

1n close cooperation vith the ODENVX office and his address was on record

with ODACID so that he could be reached easily at any time.

The efforts of tize office of General Counsel and ODURGE representatives

1n this matter are greatly appreciated.
