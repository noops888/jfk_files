Subject; PROPOSED MEETING WITH CONGRESSMAN JOHN ROWLAND (R-CT)
MEMBER HOUSE PERMANENT SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE
(HPSCI) ety
7 Ves,

PURPOSE: To advise of a tentatively scheduled meeting with
Congressman ROWLAND and to seek the DIRECTOR's approval for the
meeting.

DETAILS: On 8/10/89, Congressman ROWLAND, who was appointed to
HPSCI in January, 1989, visited the New York Office to learn more of
the FBI's effort in counterintelligence, counterterrorism, and drug
enforcement. During that visit, legislative initiatives were
discussed. There was not, however, sufficient time to discuss
counterintelligence legislative proposals. Congressman ROWLAND thus
asked the Congressional Affairs Office (CAO) representative if a
follow-up meeting could be scheduled to discuss the FBI's counter-
intelligence legislative needs in September, 1989.

A briefing has tentatively been scheduled for 9/20/89 at
11 a.m. in Room H405 - Capitol.

Memorandum from Mr. J. M. Sturgis

to Mr. W. 0. Cregar

Re: Report on Allegations Appearing in
October 14 - 15, 1979, Editions of
The Chicago Sun-Times Newspaper

DETAILS:

On 1/3/80, SAs Emil Moschella, Legal Counsel
Division, and Jim Sturgis, Intelligence Division, met with
Thomas Lattemer, Staff Director, House Permanent Committee
on Intelligence, at his request, regarding the recent FBI
submission to the Committee of a review on analysis of the
case captioned "Report on Allegations Appearing in the
October 14, 15, 1979, Editions of the Chicago ‘Sun-Times'
Newspaper; Review of Pending Federal Bureau of Investigation
(FBI) Double Agent Operations, October 1, 1977, to the
President,.'' It is noted that the Committee had taken
testimony on the matter of this double agent on October 16,
1979, and the Committee made several requests for information
in the area. (S)

Mr. Lattemer advised that it was the opinion of
one of the members that a piece of requested information
had not been directly addressed in our response and he
therefore made a request for the specific item. Mr. Lattemer
said that the item appears on pages 34 - 35 of the hearing
transcript and that the requested analysis should compare all
of the items passed by the double agent over the term of his
operation with the information received by the FBI from the
double agent so that one may be weighed against the other
in a kind of "cost/benefit ratio." (Ss)

Mr. Lattemer requested that the analysis be in his

hands prior to the first Committee meeting which is scheduled
for 1/23/80. (C)

MEMORANDUM TO MESSRS. ADAMS
MC DERMOTT
ou

Prior to the closed session meeting of the House — .-
Iatelligence Committee at 3:30 p.m. this afternoon I advised
the Attorney General that, as a result of the recent
inspeggion of the New York Office, we had discovered that
some , wiretap records were not kept in accordance with regula-
tions with the result that the indices may have been in-
complete at the time that affidavits were submitted on the
question of whether various individuals had or had not been
overheard during such taps. I told him that our tentative
assessment was that we would find very few additional names
but that it would take considerable effort to nail it down.

fhis prompted the Attorney General to tell me that

he understood Mr. LaPrade had testified or been interviewed
on the Hill regarding his foreign counterintelligence concerns
and at that time described a procedure which worried him. He -—
stated that in making,€aps on Telex lines the company (RCA)
would not cooperate and it was therefore necessary for the (.
Special Agent to run tests on various lines until he found ~—
the Telex. Judge Bell drew the inference that the Agents
necessarily had to overhear conversations or messages on other
Lines during this testing process, ,Z understand from you that
this may not be the case. We  suould ascertain exactly what
the practice is and what the problems are. . ’ ,

15 inches in diameter. Available FBI seals are either 9 inches or
21 inches in diameter. In order to furnish a 15-inch wooden FBI
seal to the HSCI, you are requested to determine whether a carved
seal can be procured in the Philippines for $50 or less. If so,
arrange to have one seal carved. You may loan the 21-inch seal in
your office to the woodcarvers temporarily for this purpose.

If you are able to obtain the desired seal, forward it to

PURPOSE: fh: aye 1
¢g

To confirm Director’ s authorization to prepare hand-painted
FBI seal suitable for mounting on wall of the hearing room (H-405) of
the HSCI.

DETAILS:

During testimony befgre the HSCI on 1/19/78, the Committee
Chairman, Rep. Edward P. Boland, requested that I arrange for an FBI
seal to be placed on the wall together with the seals of the other five
members of the Intelligence Community which are already there.

The seals of the other agencies are all 15" in diameter.
Available FBI seals are either 9" (all gold) or 21" (full color) in diameter. / 5
The Director orally authorized the hand painting of a 9" seal to be mounted vo
on a 15" wooden base appropriately finished. The Special Projects Section,
Laboratory Division, has observed seals now in the hearing room and can
prepare a suitable FBI seal and base.

y \ To obtain a 15" seal presenting an appearance more comparable ~
Bed to the other seals through regular channels would be prohibitively expensive.
“Z Making a mold, alone, would cost about $1,000. However, a hand-carved

2 .~ 15 seal can be made in the Philippines through Legat, Manila. The cost
“ ® would probably run less than $50. The time to obtain would run 60-90 days
~~ and itis, therefore, not a viable alternative to installing, initially, the

9" seal on 15" base but offers a better long-range solution to the HSCI
rf Chairman's request. %

The purpose of this memorandum is to advise that’
Congressman Charles E, Bennett (Florida) submitted House Resolution 82
(copy attached) on 1/4/77,

DETAILS: 2)

On 1/4/77, -Congréssman Charles E, Bennett (Florida) submitted
House Resolution 82, the purpose being to establish a new select committee
of the House to be known as the|Select Committee on Intelligence, to oversee
and make studies of intelligence activities and programs of the United States
Government. This Resolution is similar in nature to Senate Resolution 400,
94th Congress, Second Session, which created the Senate Select Committee
on Intelligence. If created by the House, this Committee would obtain
annual reports from.the Director of the CIA, the Secretary of State, Setre-
tary of Defense, and the Director of the FBI concerning intelligence activities,
This Committee would also submit to the Committee on the Budget views

and estimates regarding matters within the jurisdiction of this Select Committee,

This Select Committee would also require the head of each
@epartment and agency of the United States to keep the Select Committee
fully and currently informed with respect to intelligence activities, including
any significant anticipated activity, provided that it did not constitute a

condition precedent to the implementation of any such anticipated intelligence
tivity.

Legal Counsel to the Associate Director Memo
RE: HOUSE RESOLUTION 82
95TH CONGRESS, FIRST SESSION

Page 9, line 1, of this Resolution provides '"that the head of
any department or agency of the United States involved in any intelligence
activities should furnish any information or document in the possession,
custody, or control of the department or agency, or person paid by such
department or agency whenever requested by the select committee with
respect to any matter within such committee's jurisdiction." It should be
noted that Senate Resolution 400, 94th Congress, Second Session, was
silent regarding this type of access. This Select Committee would also
look into the desirability of establishing a standing committee of the House
on Intelligence Activities, the desirability of establishing a joint committee
of the Senate and the House of Representatives on intelligence activities, or
of establishing procedures under which separate committee on intelligence
activities of the two Houses of Congress would receive joint briefings by
the intelligence agencies and coordinate their policies with respect to
safeguarding of sensitive intelligence information,

This Resolution was referred to the Committee on Rules for
consideration,

RECOMMENDATION:
That the Office of Congressional Affairs, Legal Counsel Division,

will follow the deliberations concerning the creation of the House Select
Committee on intelligence.

Houstudy is the code word assigned to the Biecren seat
ontrol file containing communications pertaining to

‘requests made by the House Select Committee on Intelligence
Activities.

By memorandum 6/11/75, which was approved, it was
recommended that, for purposes of sensitivity and urgency in
handling, the Bureau file relating to the captioned matter be
maintained in the work area of personnel assigned to the
Houstudy Project; presently room 3859. It is noted that the
above arrangement must be reevaluated and recommendations
submitted on a semiannual basis. The approval was thus
updated by memoranda dated 12/4/75 and 6/1/76.

For reasons cited above, maintenance of the above
file as indicated has proven to be of invaluable assistance
to personnel assigned to the Project and to others having
frequent need for review of the file. Therefore, it is
recommended that the above arrangment be continued for an
additional 6-month period or until such time as the need no
longer exists.

PURPOSE: To advise of CIA request for permission ‘to son

Report leak to newsman Daniel Schorr; and our response to CIA
that we prefer they do not volunteer such information.

DETAILS: House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct
Ethics Committee) has been’conducting public hearings to
determine source of leak which resulted in Daniel Schorr, CBS
news commentator, providing "The Village Voice," New York City
tabloid, information from House Intelligence Committee (Pike
Committee) Report. On 7/21/76, Steve Hunt, CIA, telephonically
advised S. F. Phillips, HOUSTUDY Project, that Seymour Bolten of
CIA Review Staff and Mitchell Rogovin, formerly Special Counsel
for Director, Central Intelligence, are to testify week of
7/25/76 at public hearings of Ethics Committee.

55

From questions already asked 6f other witnesses, it-
is anticipated Bolten and Rogovin will be asked if CIA investi-
gated the leak to Schorr. They intend to reply that CIA did
not as it is not provided for in its charter; but would like to
add a statement to the effect that the FBI has conducted such
investigation. Hunt sought Bureau approval for this. On 7/23/76,
Bolten telephoned Phillips and expanded request by stating that
the question which may be put to him or to Rogovin, may be of a
general nature, such as "Did anyone in the Executive Branch
investigate this matter?"; or, "Do you know of anyone who {)

investigated this matter? i In answer to such a general question
Bolten desired to be able to respond to the effect that the FBI)
has conducted dayesipgation in this matter.

Memorandum to Mr. T. W. Leavitt
Re: HOUSTUDY

Pursuant to Department letter 2/13/76, “Disclosure
and Publication of Allegedly Classified Information by "The
Village Voice,* on or about 2/11/76," we have been conducting
a preliminary inquiry in this matter along lines specified by
the Department. After conferring with Messrs. J. B. Adams and
J. A. Mintz, it was decided that CIA be told that we would
prefer that mention of FBI not be volunteered by Bolten or
Rogovin. However, if questioned specifically as to any FBI
investigation or if asked such general questions as indicated
above, we would have no objection to the following reply: "It
is our understanding that the FBI, at the instructions of the
Department of Justice, initiated a preliminary inquiry into
this matter in February, 1976."

The foregoing was telephonically passed by Phillips
to Hunt, in Bolten's absence, on 7/23/76. The desired reply in
quotes immediately above was read to Hunt who reread it back
for accuracy. He expressed agreement with the handling of the
matter in this manner and expressed appreciation for our
cooperation,

Memorandum to Mr. T. W. Leavitt
Re: Houstudy
62-116464

DETAILS:

— On 5/18/76 Mr, August Fipp, investigator for the Standards of
Official Conduct Committee of the House, interviewed you and me in your
office concerning the Bureau's handling of the first version of the final draft
report of the HSC, which version was received by INTD on 1/20/76.

Mr. Fipp was furnished the following information, which to the
best of my recollection was the way in which this was handled by INTD.

At approximately 5 p.m. on 1/20/76 SA Dalseg received from
Douglas Marvin, Special Assistant to the Attorney General, two copies of
the draft report. SA Dalseg furnished these two copies to then Assistant
Director Wannall who in turn appointed me to coordinate the review of the
report, which consisted of approximately 340 pages, for classified material
and any errors concerning information furnished by the Bureau to the HSC.
This review was to be accomplished by 9 p.m. 1/20/76 and the results
furnished to Mr. Mitch Rogovin at CIA. Based on Mr. Wannall's instructions,
each Section Chief, INTD, was assigned approximately 50 pages to review.
SA Ryan was assigned the task of reviewing the Cointelpro portions of the
report and, as the report contained considerable information concerning the
U. S. Recording Company, the Inspection Division was requested to review
that portion of the report. Tom Hardy, a former informant handled by
General Investigative Division, had been interviewed by the Committee.
Accordingly, General Investigative Division was requested to review that
portion of the report. As former SA Arthur Murtagh had testified before
the Committee and made a number of allegations concerning the Bureau, a
portion of the report was referred to the Finance and Personnel Division
for review.

With the short deadline imposed, five Xerox copies of the report
were made making a total of seven copies of the report in the possession of
the INTD::.. These copies were handled as follows: one copy to Mr. Adams,
one copy to Mr. Wannall; one copy to you; one copy to IS-3, INTD; one copy
to Mr. Ryan; one copy split up for review by appropriate Sections of INTD;
and one copy split up for review by Inspection, General Investigative, and
Finance and Personnel Divisions.

Memorandum to Mr. T. W. Leavitt
Re: Houstudy
62-116464

With regard to the disposition of the seven copies, the following
is set forth: on receipt of instructions from the Department on 2/17/76
that copies of this report were to be returned to the CIA, a canvass of all
Sections and Front Office of INTD was made by SA Thomas J. McNiff, who
located three such copies. These copies were the ones furnished to Mr. Adams,
Mr. Wannall and yourself. Memorandum §. F, Phillips to Mr. Leavitt,
dated 3/1/76, captioned '"Houstudy 75," contains the notation that on 3/5/76
Liaison Agent Weimar returned three copies to Mr. Rogovin's office at CIA.

At the request of Mr. Douglas Marvin of the Attorney General's
Office, we had previously furnished to him the IS-3 Section copy of the report.

SA Ryan has advised that the copy utilized by him to accomplish
the review for classification and errors was destroyed.

It is the recollection of both myself and SA R. H. Ross, IS-3 Section,
who assisted me in coordinating this matter, that the working copies broken
up and distributed to the various Sections of INTD and the other Divisions were
destroyed.

PURPOSE: To advise that on 4/29/76 Mr. Norman McDaniels Ditector ii
(former SA) » amember of the investigating staff looking into the

leak of the House Select Committee Intelligence Report, telephonically
contacted Deputy Associate Director Adams for the purpose of ob- Me *
taining information regarding the Bureau's knowledge of the drafts of

the House Select Committee Intelligence report. a

DETAILS: On 4/29/76 Mr. Norman McDaniels (former SA), a member
of the investigating staff looking into the leak . of the House Select Com-
mittee Intelligence Report, telephonically contacted Deputy Associate
Director Adams indicating he desired to meet with representatives of the
Bureau in an effort to determine what knowledge the Bureau had regarding
the disposition of the reports of the House Select Intelligence Committee ti

After conferring with Assistant Director Mintz it was Agreed
that Deputy Assistant Director Cregar would contact McDaniels telephoni-
cally and advise him that his request should be submitted in writing to the
Attorney General over the signature of the Chairman of the Committee
looking into this matter. This was done on the afternoon of 4/29/76
and McDaniels said that he would definitely be contacting the Attorney
General's Office but probably would do so by telephone rather than in
writing. Cregar advised McDaniels that the Bureau would take no further
action in this matter pending advice from the Attorney General's Office.
McDaniels agreed with this arrangement. ‘

It will be recalled that on the morning of Saturday, 1/24/76,
the secretary of Mitchell Rogovin, the attorney hired by William Colby,
then Director of Central Intelligence Agency, telephonically contacted
Cregar in an effort to arrange delivery of the "final report of the House
Select Intelligence Committee to the Attorney General." The secretary
indicated that the Attorney General needed the report inasmuch as the
report % WAS to be discussed at the White House the following day and the
ee General's presence had been meanegG® we that time Rogovin's

Memorandum to Mr. T. W. Leavitt
Re: Houstudy 75

secretary indicated that this was an "informal" copy of the final report and that
its availability should be restricted.

Prior to calling McDaniels Cregar cleared with Mr.
Seymour Bolten, the official of CIA handling the House Select Intelligence
Committee matter for that agency. Bolten advised Cregar that
McDaniels had contacted him and arrangements had been made for
McDaniels to interview Bolten at CIA Headquarters on 5/4/76. Bolten
also advised that McDaniels was aware of the fact that Mitchell
Rogovin had gotten informal copies of the final draft of the House
Select Committee Intelligence Report and in fact knew the identity
of the person from whom Rogovin obtained this informal copy. Bolten
advised that CIA interposed no objection to the Bureau's furnishing
to McDaniels the precise sequence of events leading up to the FBI's
obtaining a copy of the final draft of the House Select Committee Intelligence
Report through Rogovin's office.

In the event McDaniels does obtain the Attorney General's
approval and we are notified by the Attorney General's Office that we
should cooperate with McDaniels, Cregar will meet with McDaniels
to respond to any questions he might have regarding the Bureau's. receipt
and handling of the draft of the House Select Committee Intelligence Report.

As a matter of information, Bolten advised that Mitchell
Rogovin, who has been completely cooperative with the Bureau while
representing CIA, suffered a mild heart attack approximately two weeks
ago and is currently hospitalized in Georgetown Hospital, Washington, D.C.

dated March 20, 1976, from the Director of the Central
Intelligence Agency to the Attorney General, concerning
an alleged unauthorized disclosure of three Top Secret
CIA documents. The CIA requests that an investigation
be-initiated to determine the extent of the disclosure
of the three Top Secret documents, as well as the individuals
responsible.

In order to determine whether any action by the Depart-.
ment of Justice is necessary, you are requested to conduct
a preliminary inquiry along the following lines:

1. Whether the documents were properly classified.

2. The origin of the documents and the name of the
individual responsible for the security of the
classified data.

3. The extent of official dissemination of the data.

4, Whether the data has been the subject of prior ca
official releases.

5. Whether prior clearance for publication or
release of the information was sought from
proper authorities.

6. Whether the material or portions thereof or
enough background data has been published
officially or in the press to make an educated
speculation on the matter possible.

7. Whether the data can be declassified for the
purpose of prosecution and, if so, the name
of the person competent to testify concerning
the classification.

8. Whether declassification had been decided upon
prior to the publication or release of the data.

9. What effect the disclosure of the classified
data could have on the national defense.

In addition to the above questions, you should, through
appropriate liaison channels, determine the particulars of
any agreement among the White House, the CIA, and the House
Select Committee on Intelligence Activities with regard to
the use and disposition of classified materials furnished
by the Executive Branch to the Committee. Please obtain
copies of any written agreements and conduct necessary
interviews of persons having knowledge of any such agreement
in order that the Department may have complete information
regarding its terms.

This limited inquiry should be handled expeditiously
and the results furnished promptly to this Division.

‘MEMORANDUM FOR: The Honorable Edward H. Levi =

oH FROM George Bush :
SUBJECT 2 Unauthorized Release of Agency
aces Classified Documents

I. On 4 February 1976 this Agency learned that a t
package of Agency documents, three of which are classified 1
Top Secret and contain codeword indicators, are in the
possession of Mr. Fred Land, Document Control Officer, R&D
_ Associates, 4640 Admiralty Way, Marina del Rey (Los Angeles
‘“- area), California. This package of documents was placed in 7 4
the. custody of Mr. Land by Mr. Roland Herbst, an executive
. o£ R§D Associates. Mr. Herbst apparently received the package
from one Dr. Albert Wohlstetter who may have received the
documents from an unknown media representative.

“2, Copies of all of the documents in the package were 1
provided by the Agency to the House Select Committee on Hl
Intelligence Activities between.15 November and 12 December
1975.. One of the three Top Secret documents was sent directly ee
to the White House by this Agency for release to the House
Select Committee in response to the subpoena levied by the ° H
House Select Committee against the White House. This partic- . H
ular document, considered the most sensitive of the three, is
an extract from the National Intelligence Daily of 5 July 1974. |
Ail of. the documents in the package pertain to SALT. :

3. Apparently, some of the unclassified documents in -
* the package were released to the press by the House Select
Committee on 17 December 1975. A review of press coverage
of this release would Suggest that the Top Secret documents
were not generally included in this distribution. This Agency

did not authorize the release of these three classified :
documents. —

a. You are requested to initiate an investigation
designed to identify the extent of exposure of the three Top.
Secret documents as well as those individuals responsible.
This Agency would appreciate receiving the investigative
results, which should be directed, Attention: ‘Director of

Memorandum to Mr. T. W. Leavitt
Re: HOUSTUDY
62116464.

Earlier discontent with Field had been expressed
by HSC staff aide James Oliphant to SA Paul V. Daly, Legal
Counsel Division, in that Field was thought to have furnished
the "New York Times" with a copy of the HSC report (see
memorandum Legal Counsel to J. B. Adams, captioned "HOUSTUDY,"
dated 2/24/7869.

The only known FBI changes in the HSC report occurred
as a result of FBI write-ups which were furnished to the
Committee. As background, at the request of the Attorney
General's staff on 1/20/76, INID reviewed the first draft of
the HSC report, and prepared requested comments concerning
inaccuracies and classified data in the report. The comments
were furnished to the Attorney General and Mr. Mitchell Rogovin,
Special Counsel to the Director of Central Intelligence.
Rogovin had been designated spokesman for the intelligence
community in negotiating changes in the HSC report. He met
with the HSC staff on 1/22/76, to negotiate such changes,
utilizing the Bureau write-ups. The final HSC report printed
in "The Village Voice" varied from the first draft in that
some of the changes set out in the FBI write-ups had been
incorporated. No FBI representative was present at the
1/22/76, negotiations. The write-ups furnished to Rogovin
were the only changes suggested by the Bureau prior to the
release of the final HSC report.

1 Member from Public Works and Transportation.
1 Member from Government Operations.

1 Member from Interstate and Foreign Commerce.
A Chairman to be nominated by the Speaker.

b. The candidates for membership on the standing Committee on
Intelligence shall be nominated by resolution from the above listed
committees, supplying the number of members designated above.
Nominees shall then be confirmed by the Democratic caucus or the Re-
publican conference by means of a secret ballot. Vacancies shall be filled
by like action.

ce. Candidate selection for service on the standing Committee on
Intelligence shall be based on individual qualifications and technical
expertise, rather than party affiliation, except that, the total member-
ship of the standing Gommittee on Intelligence must always have no
less than one-third of its total members from each of the major parties.

should the occasion arise when a Major Party does not have one-third
of its members represented on the committée, the Speaker shall desig-
nate to the nominating committee or. committees the necessary number
of partisan candidates to be selected.

B. RELEASE OF INFORMATION

1. I recommend that the standing Committee on Intelligence, or
any member of the committee, shall not directly or indirectly release
any information, documents or data bearing a security classification
unless and until the following sequential procedures have been
completed:

(a) The committee passes a resolution expressing the need and
reason for declassification.

(b) The appropriate administrative agency has been allowed
reasonable time to agree with the declassification or to present
reasons for opposition.

(ce) A House Leadership Committee, consisting of the Speaker,
the Majority Leader, the Minority Leader, the Majority and
Minority Whips and the chairmen of the committees from which
the: Intelligence Committee Membership has been selected (a
majority of the total being present), shall approve or disapprove
of the declassification and release.

(d) Notwithstanding the committee’s approval or disapproval,
any committee member who disagrees shall have a right to peti-
tion individual members of the Leadership Committee. If three or
more members of the Leadership Committee shall concur, said
member shall have a right to be heard by the full Leadership
Committee.

(e) Any Intelligence Committee member who shall release any
materials, documents, or data bearing a security classification,
without complying with the above provisions shall be subject to
expulsion from the House of Representatives and shall be subject
to appropriate criminal or civil action, notwithstanding legislative
immunity.

2. a, Any member of the House having knowledge of classified
materials, documents or data who shall release such material, doc-
uments or data without obtaining the approval of a majority of the

members of the Leadership Committee shall be subject to expulsion
from the House of Representatives and shall be subject to any appro-
priate criminal or civil actions, notwithstanding legislative immunity.

0. PENALTIES FOR IMPROPER RELEASE OF CLASSIFIED INFORMATION

I recommend that the United States Code be amended to provide
criminal sanctions against any person who shall disclose or reveal
properly classified information, documents, data, or plans concerning
the national security of the United States, such sanctions to apply
regardless of intent to harm the United States or to aid a foreign na-
tion, notwithstanding legislative immunity.
Dare Mirrorp.

Recommenparion or How. Morcaw F. Moreny

In light of the investigation by the House Select Committee on In-
telligence, I recommend that Congress enact legislation or amend exist-
ing legislation to protect the confidentiality of tax records of American
citizens.

Section 61038 of the Internal Revenue Code refers to tax returns as
“public records” but specifies that they be “open to inspection only
upon order of the President and under rules and regulations pre-
scribed by the Secretary or his delegate and approved by the
President.”

Public use and abuse of the records, however, have been more the
rule than the exception in the recent past. There has been little em-
phasis on the need for protecting the confidentiality of tax records.

I recommend a, shift in emphasis back to the basic right of taxpayers
to privacy regarding their tax affairs. We must do more than limit dis-
closures to certain agencies, individuals, congressional committees, and
States. We must require the entity seeking tax information to prove
that such information is essential to the entity’s function and further,
that the tax information cannot otherwise be acquired. I suggest that
House and Senate committees with jurisdiction act with all deliberate
speed to finalize their work on legislation to better ensure the privacy
of tax records. .

Morgan F. Munrry.

ApprmonaL Recommenpation or Hon. Jams V. Sranron

I would go beyond recommendation N of the select committee, which
proposes that the Assistant to the President for National Security
Affairs be prohibited from holding any Cabinet-level position, by rec-
ommending the enactment of legislation which (1) states that the
individual who holds this position cannot hold any other office in the
Federal Government, nor may he be a member of the Armed Forces,
(2) requires Senate confirmation of this position, and (3) in order to
achieve these purposes, establishes statutorily the position of Special
Assistant to the President for National Security -A fairs, I have intro-
duced a bill, H.R. 10754, which embodies these provisions.

James V. Sranron.

Aurernarive Recommenpations or Hon. Rosmrr McCrory

I support the recommendations contained in the majority report
under headings: D, F, G, 1, J, L, N, O, Q, R, and S (with the exception
of section 1). I do not approve of the other recommendations and I
offer the following alternative recommendations in those areas in which
L believe reform is necessary and appropriate.

Aurernastvn Recomstinpations or Hon. Rosrrr McCory

I recommend that there be established a permanent standing Com-
mittee on Intelligence of the House of Representatives.

1, The committee shall consist of five members composed of one
member from each of the following committees: (a) Appropriationss

b) Aamed Services, (c) International Relations, (a) ‘udiciary, and
(3) Government Operations; no more than three of whom shall be
members of the same political party. The committee membershi
should reflect & broad representation of political and philosophica!
views. .

2. No member of the committee may serve more than 3 consecutive
terms on the committee, and no member of the staff may serve more
than 6 consecutive years. .

3. Any past or current member of the committee staff who shall re-
lease, without authorization of the committee, materials or informa-
tion obtained by the committee shall be immediately terminated from
employment and shall be fully subject to criminal and civil lability,
notwithstanding legislative immunity. a

4, The committee’s jurisdiction shall include all legislative and
oversight functions relating to all U.S. agencies and departments en-
gaged in foreign or domestic intelligence activities. The committee
shail have exclusive jurisdiction for budget authorization for all in-
telligence activities and exclusive jurisdiction for all covert action op-
erations. All remaining oversight functions may be concurrent with
other committees of the House. .

5. The committee shall be vested with subpoena power, and the
rules of the House should be amended to give the committee the right
to enforce its subpoenas through a civil contempt proceeding in the
U.S. District Court for the District of: Columbia without specific
authorization from the full House.

B. RELEASE OF INFORMATION

_L. I recommend that the House Committee on Intelligence have the
right to release any classified information or documents in its posses-
sion or control only if the following procedures are adhered to:

(a) the committee shall havé the duty to consult with other
agencies of the Government within the intelligence community
or the executive branch with respect to the public disclosure of
any classified information before any formal committee vote on
release.

_ (0) After such consultation, the committee may, by an affizma-
tive vote-of a majority of the members, submit the material pro-
posed to be released to the President.

(¢) If within a reasonable period of time the President certi-
fies in writing that the disclosure of the material would be deteri-

a

these projects involved illegalities and abuses by the intelligence divi-
sion of IRS in my own State of Florida.

I would only comment here that our system is grossly misused when
Federal agencies violate the law in‘their attempts to enforce it. To
adopt the methods of criminals is to become indistinguishable from

em,

RECOMMENDATIONS

I strongly support the committee’s recommendation that no mem-
ber of the House serve on the new oversight committee we propose for
more than 6 years. Such a limitation will help to ensure that the com-
mittee’s members retain their objectivity and not come to look on the
intelligence community as their own private preserve.

A similar limitation should be imposed on the Directors of the CLA
and FBI, so that neither is allowed to serve for so many years that he
can no longer distinguish between himself and his job. _

One of the committee’s recommendations would require the FBI
agents or informants have a judicial warrant before attempting to in-
filtrate any domestic group or association. I agree that this require-
ment is necessary to protect the rights of American citizens, but, in
light of recent tragedies perpetrated by international terrorists groups,
I feel that such a restriction should not be imposed when the group
or association is wholly or partly made up of aliens.

SUMMARY

In comparison with other intelligence agencies, and, indeed, with
Government agencies in general, I find the CIA to be highly profes-
sional and very dedicated. Despite past lack of accountability, the
CIA. is doing a high level, cost effective job, particularly in its intelli-
gence gathering function,

However, there are-serious deficiencies in the operation of the CIA.
Much constructive rebuilding must be done if American intelligence
activities are to be conducted with responsibility and integrity—and
without undermining the spirit of our democratic society.

Buu Lowsan.

Recomaenpations or Hon. Date Maurorp

A. A HOUSE COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE

1. I recommend that there be formed a standing Committee on In-
telligence of the House of Representatives, and that committee shall
consist of members who hold the respect and confidence of the general
membership of the House. .

a. The membership of the standing Committee on Intelligence shall
be selected from sitting members of the following House committees:

2 Members from Armed Services.

2 Members from Internal Relations.

1 Member from Science and Technology.
1 Member from Banking and Currency.
1 Member from Judiciary.



12

our tradition of an open society, as well as this Nation’s moral position
throughout the world. For, if this Nation does not maintain that moral
Position, there is now no other country in the world who can take our
place.

If I were CIA Director, I would be happy to see a strong congres-
sional oversight committee, because it would be the most effective safe-
guard against wrongly conceived and wrongly motivated covert ac-
tions originating in the executive branch.

Despite allegations to the contrary, congressional investigations
have not prevented the Agency from doing an effective job. Past per-
formance bears this out; in fact, the failure of the CIA and other in-
telligence agencies to give adequate warning of several international
crises may simply indicate the limited ability of intelligence to safe-
guard our national security,

There was, for example, the October 1978, Mideast war, where there
was more than enough information available to warn of the impend-
ing Arab attack. There were other failures ag well: the 1974 coup in
‘Cyprus and the subsequent Turkish invasion; the Indian nuclear ex-
plosion; the Soviet invasion of ‘Czechoslovakia; the Tet offensive in
Vietnam ; and the leftist coup in Portugal. All of these “failures” oc-
curred long before any congressional committee was directed to in-
vestigate the intelligence community.

The intelligence community has operated in the past with a virtual
blank check budget. This not only removes any incentive to curtail
wasteful programs, but, through the very availability of funds, leads
to both foolish and dangerous covert operations.

Yet, I am concerned by the committee’s recommendation that a line-
item figure for the CIA appear in the budget. Is it really possible to
get a true and accurate figure? In the event that one of the branches
of the armed services details a vessel to the CIA, is the cost of that
vessel a part of the costs of intelligence? In my view, a line-item fig-
ure for the Agency must conform to principles of sound accounting
practice. Only then will it have any meaning at all.

THE FBI

The committee hearings on the FBI documented the problem of in-
formants turned agents-provocateur. Informants are necessary; the
pse of provocateurs is totally contrary to principles of decency and
honesty.

One of these agents-provocateur was William Lemmer, who worked
in, Florida as an informant for the Bureau. Lemmer infiltrated the
Vietnam Veterans Against the War and became one of the most active
members of the chapter. As such, he allegedly suggested violent means
of expressing VVAW disagreement ‘vith the country’s Vietnam war
policy. This kind of activity, directed by the Nation’s foremost law
enforcement agency, is plainly and starkly wrong.

THE IRS

IRS projects such as “Operation Leprechaun”, “Operation Trade
Winds”, and “Operation Haven”, clearly demonstrate that the IRS
has gone far beyond its prescribed role in tax enforcement. Each of

mental to the national security of the United States, the material
would not be disclosed or released. Failing any such Presidential
certification, the committee would be able to release the material.

(d) In the event of such a certification by the President, the
committee shall be given standing to sue and the U.S. District
Court for the District of Columbia shall be given jurisdiction
over such disputes, so that the matter can be submitted to the
courts for judicial determination.

C. COVERT ACTION

1. I recommend that all activities involving direct or indirect at-
tempts to assassinate any individual be prohibited by law except in
time of war. . coo. .

2. I recommend that appropriate legislation be enacted to require
prior approval by the House Committee on Intelligence for all mili-
tary and paramilitary covert actions proposed by the U.S. Govern-
ment, including those actions in which arms or funds for arms would
be provided covertly. . —

3. I recommend that, as to all other covert actions of a significant
size or involving significant risk, the Director of Central Intelligence
be required, within 48 hours of initial implementation, to notify
the committee in writing and in detail of the nature, extent, purpose,
risk and costs of the operation.

D. IMPROVED SECURITY FOR CLASSIFIED INFORMATION IN THE HOUSE

1. I recommend that the Rules of the House be revised to provide
that any member who violates the confidentiality of any executive
session of any House committee may be censured or expelled by a two-
thirds vote of the House.

2. I recommend that the miles of the House be amended to provide
that any committee of the House which has access to classified infor-
mation has the authority to discipline any member which it reason-
ably believes has disclosed or publicized such information in violation
of the rules of confidentiality duly adopted by such committee. These
committees ought to be delegated authority by the full House to take
appropriate disciplinary action against such a member to ensure com-
pliance with the rules of confidentiality. Appropriate disciplinary
action could be taken only after a vote of a majority of the majority
members and a majority of the minority members of the committee;
and any member against whom such disciplinary action is taken shall
have a right of appeal to the full House.

BE. GAO AUDIT AUTHORITY

I xecommend that the General Accounting Office be empowered to
conduct full and complete financial audits of all intelligence agencies.
There should not be any limitation on GAO access in the performance
of these functions by any classification system, and the financial audit
function of GAO should specifically apply to those funds which cur-
rently may be expended on certification of a Director of an agency
alone.

I. DETAILEES

I recommend that intelligence agencies disclose the affiliation of
their employees on detail to other Government agencies or depart-
ments to the heads of such agencies; and that detailees not be placed
in any position in which an actual or apparent conflict of interest
might exist. ‘

(To the Recommendations of the House Select Committee on
Intelligence)

The following are my specific recommendations (on the subjects
which they concern) which may differ, vary or coincide with recom-
mendations on similar subjects by the majority. The absence of any
recommendation on a subject covered by the majority is not to be
construed as concurrence or nonconeurrence with the majority
recommendation.

Recommendation No. 1: Joint Oversight Committee

I recommend that there be established a Joint Congressional Com-
mittee on Foreign Intelligence which committee shall have oversight
and legislative authority with respect to all foreign intelligence
activities.

(a) The joint committee shall consist of no more than 14 mem-
bers, equally divided between the House and Senate. The com-
mittees of the House and ‘Senate having jurisdiction over inter-
national affairs, armed services, and defense appropriations shall
each be entitled to representation on the joint committee by at
Jeast one member of those committees.

(6) Membership on the joint committee shall be limited to a
period of 6 years and, beginning with the fifth year, at least one-
third of the committee membership shall consist of new members.

(c) Any past or current member of the joint committee staff
who shall release, without proper authorization, materials or in-
formation obtained by the joint committee shall be immediately
terminated from employment and shall be fully subject to crimi--
nal and civil action, not withstanding any plea of legislative
immunity.

(d) The joint committee shall be vested with subpoena power,
and the rules of the House shall be amended to give the joint
committee the right to enforce its subpoenas through 2. civil con-
tempt proceeeding in the U.S. District Court for the District of
Columbia without specific authorization from the full House.

Recommendation No. 2: Obligations of the Executive Branch

I recommend that the executive branch be required to keep the
joint committee promptly and fully informed as to all intelligence
activities, including covert actions, and including full disclosure of
allocations wherever they may be in the budget with regard to foreign
intelligence and all expenditures of funds by all departments and

justify continued covert action on grounds that we foster and develop
democracy around the world.

If covert action isn’t banned, the committee’s recommendations on
covert action should be strengthened and it should be required that
the Oversight Committee have preknowledge of all major covert
activities. -

The nature of covert actions and espionage subtract from the main
xesponsibility of the CLA—to serve as an independent central research
and analysis facility. Since active involvement in clandestine opera-
tions can force analysis to be silenced for policy needs, certain present
functions of the CIA should be divided and a separate espionage
(human intelligence) /clandestine operations agency be formed.

In his testimony, Dr. Ray S. Cline called for a central research and
analysis facility to provide objective assessments of national security
data to Congress and the National Security Council. I agree, and I
believe this ought to be a separate organization, not linked to any
policymaker other than the President and as free from other institu-
tional bias as possible. Actually, research and analysis are the original
functions of the CLA and are functions that the Central Intelligence
Agency apparently does better than any other agency in the intelli-
gence community. Its research and analysis functions should be
facilitated. :

I recommend that the Central Intelligence Agency be split into two.
agencies—an intelligence research and analysis agency and a second
agency to conduct whatever espionage and covert action functions are
authorized.

In addition, I recommend that both the new intelligence research
and analysis agency and the new espionage and covert agency be inde-
pendent agencies subject to all controls recommended by this.

ommittec.

Possible violations of law by intelligence agency employees or agents:
should be investigated and, if required, prosecuted by the Department.
of Justice. No agency should have the right or capability to bar in-
vestigation or prosecution. In addition to criminal penalties there must
be provision for civil liability for abuses of authority. Legislation
should provide for jurisdiction, justiciability and standing, discovery,
and relief. .

Several other recommendations are included in my supplemento]
views to the report of the House Select Committee on Intelligence.
Every member and the public must have access to that report.

It is imperative that the House of Representatives now consider
these issues and pass legislation based on these recommendations.

Apprrionan Recosrenpations or Hox. Winiraa Leawan

There is no question in my mind that the United States must have
a strong, effective, professional intelligence service. Our national se-
curity depends on it.

Yet that intelligence service is but part of our Government. And,
like all parts, it must be balanced against a continuing need for and



10

It seems to me that whatever action this country takes in a world
that is becoming this small and this interdependent ought to be overt
action. The United States ought to begin to play an aggressive role as
an advocate of peace in the world, as an advocate of humanitarian
concerns, and frankly I believe that the level of secrecy that we have
been exposed to as members of this committee flies in the face of
democratic principle. .

Many people conveniently wrap themselves quite fully in the flag,
but when pressed to the wall on whether or not they are willing
seriously to support democratic principles, I find that they are willing
to sidestep principle.

Democracy is based on a notion of the development of a consensus.
In my estimation covert action dees not provide for that consensus.
It does not provide for debate needed to achieve consensus. Instead,
covert actions are recommended and approved by a small select group
of people. The actions can at some point be extremely expensive, at
some point extraordinarily risky and at some point fly in the face of
open debate on any given question..I think that detrimental to the
democratic process.

I am willing to try democracy. My concern is that our democracy
has been, for the most part, a charade or merely symbolic, and I am
not sure that many of us truly believe in the concept of majority rule.

I am concerned. about secretly providing arms and aid to other
countries, presidents able to sit down with other presidents and making
deals. Yet these things are issues we found that are part of the range
of covert actions utilized by this country.

I think our world is much too complicated to continue to function
effectively in this manner. The more we get involved in covert action,
the more we become accused of covert actions in places where we may
not be involved at all.

So, the question is, does it really assist this country’s role in the
world to continue these kind of activities. My answer is no. Indeed,
I think we do much more harm continuing to function covertly.

Many of these operations are well-known except to the people of the
States and/or their representatives. So where does the covert rationale
ply ? It keeps people who are part of this society out of the decision,
and. it comes at a level which keeps representatives of the people out
of those decisions.
I see no justification for covert operations. If we want to assist,
hen why not do it in the open and let the debate deal with the ques-
tion of what our role “ought” to be somewhere in the world. On the
basis of a consensus publicly made, then we can assist. But why do we
have to play games? Why do we have to get involved ?

Another related question is where have covert operations taken us?
Are the nations that we have been involved with free democratic
societies where the masses of people have benefits of democracy, or are
hose nations for the most part, military dictators, right-wing juntas,
Qt regimes with extraordinary wealth and. power in the hands of a few
itists ?

If the latter holds, it totally contradicts stated principles of this
country. If we have been involved in covert actions which generated
democracy, freedom and justice around the world, maybe we might
arrive at some different conclusion. But I don’t think anyone can

agencies of the executive branch for foreign intelligence and covert
activities.

Recommendation No. 3: Access to and Release of Classified Infor-
mation
I recommend that the rules of the House and Senate, where neces-
sary, be conformed to accommodate the following recommendations,
and that, where necessary, legislation be enacted im aid thereof:

(a) Access to information and materials furnished to the joint
committee in executive session or classified secret by the execu-
tive branch shall not be accessible to other members of Congress
except upon a resolution permitting such access adopted by a
two-thirds vote of the membership of both the House and Senate
Members, voting in person and not by proxy.

(b) Prior to any action to permit access of such information to
other Members of Congress, the executive branch shall be given
reasonable opportunity to testify and present evidence in execu-
tive session regarding the proposed action.

(c). Materials and information received from the executive
branch in executive session of the joint committee or otherwise
classified secret by the executive branch may be publicly released
only upon adoption of the resolution specified m subparagraph
(a) above and upon the adoption of a resolution permitting pub-
lic disclosure adopted by a two-thirds vote of the membership of
both the House and Senate, the debate on which shall be conducted
in secret session, and the vote on which shall be in open session by
recorded vote, :

d) Any Member of Congress who reveals any information in
violation of the foregoing procedures may be censured or ex-
pelled by a two-third vote of the House or the Senate, as the case
may be.

Recommendation No. 4: Agreements for the Handling of Classified
Information

I recommend that any information furnished to the joint committee
by the executive branch under an agreement with the joint committee
for the handling of such information shall be binding in accordance
with the terms of that agreement on the joint committee, on the House
and Senate, and on each Member of Congress. Violation of the terms
of the agreement shall be grounds for censure or expulsion by a two-
thirds vote of the House or Senate, as the case may be. .

Recommendation No. 5: Director of Central Intelligence

I recommend that a Director of Central Intelligence shall be estab-
lished, separate from any of the operating intelligence agencies, for
the purpose of coordinating and overseeing the foreign intelligence
community. His purpose shall be to eliminate duplication in collection
and promote competition in analysis. ‘ . . .

(a) The DCI shall be appointed by the President with the advice
and consent of the Senate.

(b) The DCI shall be the chief foreign intelligencé officer of the
United States, and shall be responsible for the supervision and control
of all agencies of the United Btates engaged in foreign intelligence.

(c) The DCI shall be a member of the National Security Council.



20

(&) The DCI may not hold any other position, office or title in the
U.S. Government. :

(e) The DCI shall, along with such other duties, constitute an office
of Inspector General for all of the foreign intelligence agencies, in-
cluding all agencies of Government which have foreign intelligence
functions. Such agency shall have the obligation to report all allega-
tions of misconduct and/or unlawful activities to the DCI.

(£) The DCI shall be responsible for the national intelligence esti-
mates and daily briefings of the President.

(g) The DCI shall be responsible for reporting to the Joint Com-
mittee on Intelligence and other appropriate committees of Congress.

(bh) All budget requests which include funds for foreign intelligence
or covert activities shall, insofar as such funds are concerned, be pre-
pared in consultation with the DCI. Although the funds for foreign
intelligence activities will continue to be budgeted in the respective
agency budgets, the DCI shall be responsible to the joint committee for
full reporting on the foreign intelligence and covert activities funding
set forth in all agency budgets.

(i) The DCT shall coordinate the functions of all foreign intelli-
gence agencies under his jurisdiction, shall eliminate unnecessary
duplication, conduct periodic evaluation of the performance and
efficiency of' the agencies, and report to Congress on the foregoing at
least annually.

Recommendation No. 6 : Disclosures to Congress

I recommend that existing law (Sec. 102(d)8 of the National Secu-
rity Act of 1947) which restricts officials of the executive branch from
providing information be amended to specifically exclude from any
such prohibition all committees of Congress having appropriate juris-

iction.

Recommendation No. 7: Assistant for National Security Affairs

I recommend that the Assistant to the President for National Secu-

,vity Affairs be prohibited from holding any other position, office or

title in the U.S. Government.
Recommendation No. 8: News Media and Publications

(1) I recommend that U.S. foreign intelligence agencies be pro-
hibited from covertly providing money or other valuable consideration
to employees or full-time representatives of any journal or electronic
media with general circulation in the United States, and prohibited
from utilizing such individuals-for purposes. of cover ; except that such
prohibition shall not apply to the occasional or casual furnisher of
news stories or articles tothe news media. es

-(2) I recommend: that the U.S. intelligence agencies be prohibited
from the covert publication of books, articles or stories in any journals
or ele¢tronic media with general circulation in the United States. --
Recommendation No. 9: Classification ; :

_ I recommend that the classification and declassification of itiforma-
tion be the subject of specific legislation by the Congress.
Recommendation No. 10: Director of the FBF

I recommend that the Director of the FBI have a term of office of
5 years.and that mo: director serve more than two 5-year terms.

NW 68486 Docld:32989711 Page 73

_ These recommendations should stimulate extremely important and
timely discussion, debate and consensus about such vital and basic
questions as: ;
(1) Is secrecy compatible vith principles of democracy osten-
sibly embodied in our constitutional form of government?

ts Tf and where is secrecy necessary? .
: 3) How much: secrecy is required and what forms should it
take

4) What safeguards against abuse are required? :
: What, if any, are our legitimate and necessary intelligence
needs?

(6) How much change, restructuring, and/or elimination of
organizations are required to meet on the one hand the “legiti-
mate” intelligence needs of our Nation, and on the other hand
safeguard against abuse of people, power, and the Constitution?

. ) As our world continues its rapid changes and shifts, what
level of our already limited resources do we perceive as necessary
to meet our intelligence needs? .

These and other questions must be discussed and debated within an
atmosphere of reason. To resolve these questions and reach some con-
sensus, it will demand the best within each of us as representatives of
the people. The issues both implicitly and explicitly raised by the
committee recommendations are of extreme importance and must be
addressed within that context. .

I oppose the committee’s recommendation regarding: (A) A House
Committee on Intelligence, insofar as, “. .. The committee shall have
exclusive jurisdiction .. . for all covert action operations.” I believe
that this information should be more widely shared. Discerning over-
sight is facilitated by involving.several relevant committees, and I
think jurisdiction over covert action operations should be shared with:
those committees-presently involved.

I am opposed to that part of the recommendation regarding: (B)
Release of information (4) “The select committee recommends that
the rules of the House be revised to provide that any member who
reveals any classified information which jeopardizes the national se-
curity of the United States may be censored or expelled by'a two-
thirds vote of the House.” -

“National security” is now an‘infamous phrase, one open to mis-
chievous interpretation. There is a great danger in constructing a
chilling system which allows demagogues the easy opportunity of
injuring a member by making reckless charges. .

The committee’s recommendation on covert action is not satisfac-
tory. The committee recommendations say, “1. The select committee
recommends that all activities involving direct or indirect attempts to
assassinate any individual and all paramilitary activities shall be pro-
hibited except in time of war.” . . :

We should prohibit all covert action.

We live in a world becoming increasingly smaller and interde-
pendent, a world.in which secrecy and cloak and dagger methods, in
my estimation, are anachronisms from the past. They should have no
place today in the world we will continue to live in.

proval. I have proposed that a standing committee be informed of
covert operations before they are approved by the President. The
standing committee or committees should not have veto power, but
the committees, or their members individually, should have the oppor-
tunity to make their views known to the President.

No doubt a number of members would simply write out a list of
reservations to cover themselves in case an operation went wrong. But
is that bad? It is a good idea to have advice reaching the President
from a few people who have a bias for negativism. There is too much
me-tooism in the executive branch already.

Furthermore, if the members of the new 40 Committee knew that
Congress was part of the consultative process, they would be likely to
move with greater care and discretion than has been true in the past.
Prior notification of Congress is one more governor on the intelligence
vehicle which could inhibit the kind of reckless driving the committee
uncovered in its investigations.

‘The committee, in a number of its recommendations, has sought to
provide a framework for improvement. But we have left the CIA

i igh and dry organizationally. I believe that the CIA should be di-
vided into two separate agencies—one devoted only to analysis and
the other responsible for clandestine collection and covert operations.

Splitting the CIA is the key to attracting the kinds of young men
and women we need in intelligence analysis. ‘The hostility the CLA has
aroused is bound to discourage many good people from applying.
Furthermore, the analysts need interchanges with academia, and these
ties have been strained by the public perceptions that anyone con-
nected with the CIA has blood. on his hands.

‘We have also seen, as in the Bay of Pigs, that proximity breeds bias.
One side of the ord planned the Bay of Pigs, The other side of the
CLA was not in a position to analyze it independently and critically.

‘Critics say it is impossible to separate covert collection from covert
operations, that many of the same people are used for the two pur-
poses. This is quite true. However, my proposal leaves covert collec-
tion and covert operations in the same organization and simply splits
them off from the analytical function. :

No improvements will result if proposals for reform are consigned
to the archives like the report of this committee. Our intelligence serv-
ices have been ignored by Congress in the past—and we have seen the
consequences of that inattention. Congress now has a second chance to
decide if it wishes to play Pontius Pilate and wash its hands of an

_ unpleasant business or confront the issue headon. I hope the Congress
will not abdicate its responsibilities any more. a

Recommendation No. 11: Infiltration of Groups or Associations
T recommend that judicial warrant must issue, on probable cause,
before an informant or any other agent of the FBI may infiltrate any
domestic group or association, when (1) investigation of such group
or association or its members is based solely on title 18 U.S.C. sec.

Avrerwative Recosarenpations or Hon. Rosurr W. Kasran, Jr.
INTRODUCTION

Although I wholeheartedly support many of the recommendations
proposed by-the committee’s majority; the majority proposals collec-
tively do not accurately reflect my judgments concerning the reforms
and improvements which should be made in the U.S. intelligence
community. ' . .

To indicate specific points of agreement and disagreement, I have
reproduced below the majority recommendations together with my
own alternative or additional Proposals Language in the majority
report with which I disagree has been stricken out; my alternative
or additional language has. been underscored.* In several instances, I
have also added brief comments in brackets following thé. recom-
mendation to which the comments refer. a

A. A HOUSE COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE |

“L. The select comriittee recommends that there be formed.e [stand-
ing] Joint Committee on Intelligence of the House of Representatives.
and the Senate.

* GPO style, set in italic type.



22

a. The committee membership should reflect a, broad representation
of political and philosophical views.

b. The committee should consist of not more than 18 or less than
nine members, designated by the President pro tem of the Senate and
the Speaker of the Elouse in consultation with the minority leader of
each House. The majority shall have one more than one-half of the
members ppointed from either House. . .

c. No Member of the committee may serve more than 8 consecutive
terms on the commitiee, and no member of the staff may serve more
than 6 years.

d. Any past or current member of the committee staff who shall re-
lease, without authorization of the committee, materials or information
obtained by the committee shall be immediately terminated from em-
ployment and shall be fully subject to criminal and civil action, not-
withstanding legislative immunity.

e. The committee shall be vested with subpoena power and shall
have the right to enforce by a proceeding for. civil contempt its sub-
poenas in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or any
other court of competent jurisdiction, [without authorization] zf au-
thorized [from the House, provided the committee has so designated]
by resolution. The committee staff shall be given statutory standing to
tepresent the committee in any proceeding arising from the issuance
of a subpoena. .

_£ The committee’s jurisdiction shall include all legislative and over-

sight functions relating to all U.S. agencies and departments engaged
in foreign or domestic intelligence. The committee shall have exclu-
sive jurisdiction for budget authorization for all intelligence activities
and exclusive jurisdiction for all covert action operations. All remain-
ing oversight functions may be concurrent with other committees.
* [Nore: Iam opposed to the creation of two oversight committees on
intelligence: one in the House and one in the Senate. I favor instead
the creation of a joint committee because it will reduce the burden on
the DCI and intelligence officials of repeating testimony before com-
mittees with similar jurisdiction and also reduce the burden of Con-
gress by having many members assigned to tasks which are duplicative.
In addition, concentration of oversight in one joint committee would
reduce the possibility of unauthorized disclosure of information and
more importantly would help assure that problems would not “fall
between two chairs” and be addressed by neither committee. The fact
that each appropriations committee in reviewing the budget of the
intelligence-gathering agencies would have an oversight function re-
duces the possibility that one joint committee would be co-opted by
the intelligency agency.]

B. RELEASE OF INFORMATION

1, The select committee recommends that rule XI.2 (e) (2) of the
House Rules is amended to read as follows: . :
_ “Each committee shall keep a complete record of all committee ac-
tion which shall include a copy of all reports, statements, and testi-
mony of witnesses whether received in open or in exécutive session.”

doctiments in its possession or control by a vote of a majority of the

T. DOMESTIC

1. The select committee recommends that judicial warrant must
issue, on probable cause, before an informant or any other agent of the
FBI may infiltrate any domestic group or association, when investi-

ation of such group or association or its members is based solely on,
fitle 18 U.S.C. §$ 9383, 2384, 2385. ;

2. The select committee recommends that the Director of the FBI
have a term of office no longer than 2 presidential terms. .

8. The select committee recommends that the Internal Security
Branch of the Intelligence Division be abolished and that the counter-
intelligence branch be reorganized to constitute a full division named

‘the Counter-Intelligence Division; that the mission of this Division

be limited to investigating and countering the efforts of foreign di-
rected groups and individuals against the United States. . .

4, The salect committee recommends the transfer of all investiga-
tions of alleged criminal activity by domestic groups or individual
members thereof tothe General Investigative Division,

5. The select committee recommends that regulations be promul-
gated that tie the investigation of activities of terrorist groups closely
to specific violations of criminal law within the investigative juris-
diction of the FBI and that charge the Department of Justice with
determining when a domestic political action group may be appropri-
ately targeted for investigation of terrorist activities.

ApprrronaL Recomarenpations or Hon. Las Asrix

All the hearings, all the hassles and all the headlines should have
underscored the fact that the Select Committee really faced three
challenges: .

how to banish abuses from the intelligence system ;

how to control covert operations; and .

how to improve the intelligence product, the analyses for which
we spend so much money. . a . .

The committee has approved a number of recommendations which
goto the heart of these problems. * . .

The establishment of an Independent Inspector General for Intelli-
gence will provide an office designed exclusively to hawkeye the in-
telligence community and see that itis adhering to the law.

The institutionalization of a successor to the 40 Committee will pro-
vide systematic direction of covert operations by the executive branch
for the first time. . ;

And creation of a more powerful director of central intelligence will
for the first time give one man the authority to whip the many in-
éelligence fiefdoms into line and eliminate the duplication and waste
that the committee found to be rife. - . vo

I think that there is more that we. could have done and I have two
additional proposals. . yor - ,

The select committee suggested that a standing committee be in-
formed of an approved covert operation within 48 hours after its ap-

1. ‘The select committee recommends the establishment of an inde-
pendent Office of the Inspector General for Intelligence, ‘who hall
have full authority to investigate any possible or potential misconduct
on-the part of the various intelligence agencies or the personnel therein.

intelligence committees or other appropriate oversight committees as
he may choose or the committees may direct.

Cr. pomesrric]

[1. The Select Committee recommends that judicial warrant must
issue, on probable cause, before an informant or any other agent of
the FBI may infiltrate any domestic group or association, when in-
vestigation of such group or association or its members is based solely
on title 18 U.S.C. § 2383, 2384, 2385. ;

[2. The select. committee recommends that the Director of the FBI
have a term of office no longer than 2 presidential terms. .

[8. The select committee recommends that the Internal Security
Branch of the Intelligence Division be abolished and that the Counter-
Intelligence Branch be reorganized to constitute a full division named
the Counter-Intelligence Division ; that the mission of this division be
limited to investigating and countering the efforts of foreign directed
groups and individuals against the United States.

[4. The select committee recommends the transfer of all investiga-
tions of alleged criminal activity by domestic groups or individual
members thereof to the General Investigative Division.

5. The select committee recommends that. regulations be promul-
gated that tie the investigation of activities of terrorist groups closely
to specific violations of criminal law within the investigative juris-
diction of the FBI and that charge the Department of Justice with
determining when a domestic political action group may be appropri-
ately targeted for investigation of terrorist activities.]

CONCLUSION

As these recommendations indicate, my service on the-select commit-
tee has convinced me that reforms are necessary to improve the. orga-
nization, performance, and control of the U.S. intelligence commu-
nity. At the same time, the experience of the past-months has again
confirmed my understanding of how important an effective intelligence
capability is to the future security of the American people. Intelli-
gence officials can and must operate in a manner consistent with the

- individual rights and liberties guaranteed by the Constitution. These

protections must be guaranteed, but so must the right of the American
people to live in security and peace. It is both possible-and essential
for the intelligence agencies to perform their responsibilities effec-
tively, and by means which protect both individual rights and national
security.

At a minimum, the intelligence community must regain the trust
and confidence of the people whom it serves. It is tragic that it was
necessary to establish this committee to inquire into the activities of
agencies on which we depend so heayily for our security. But it would
be even more tragic if the results of our investigation were now to be
ignored. Implementing the recommendations i have proposed_ will
contribute significantly to ensuring that there will be no need for
another such committee to be established in the future. Both Congress
and the American people must recognize the need to complete the task
which we have only begun.

Memorandum to Mr. T. W. Leavitt
Re: Houstudy 75
Disposition of House Select
Committee (HSC) Records
62-116464

DETAILS :

On 2/11/76, Captain John Matheny, supra,
telephonically advised Senstudy 75 Project that on that
date a hasty agreement had been reached between the
executive branch and HSC concerning the interim disposition
of the HSC's documents. Captain Matheny stated the agreement
was reached in pegotiations between CIA and Representative
Otis G, Pike, Chairman of the HSC, and HSC Staff. Captain
Matheny stated the details of this agreement, other than
the fact documents would be going to CIA under seal, were

“as yet unclear; however, he would immediately advise when

same were « known.

On the p.m, of 2/12/76, Captain Matheny tele-
phonically advised Senstudy 75 Project details of the
agreement were as follows:

(1) ALL documents furnished to the HSC by
executive branch departments or agencies on an “on loan”
basis would be returned to the originating department or
agency.

(2) All items or materials received from the
National Security Council would be returned thereto.

(3) All transcripts of hearings, public and
executive, and interviews conducted by the HSC and all
materials received unsolicited or otherwise generated by
the HSC would be placed in safekeeping with the National
Archives,

Re: Houstudy 75

(4) All other material received from executive
branch departments or agencies would be placed for safekeeping
with CIA in sealed cartons which are not to be disturbed,
opened or their contents examined except on further author-
ization from the House of Representatives or the Speaker
of the House,

Captain Matheny stated it had been decided that
the material going to CIA under seal would be first segregated
as to originating department or agency and thereafter placed
in separate cartons, sealed and the originator identified
thereon.

He further stated that Mr, Antonin Scalia,
Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel, Department
of Justice, had agreed to the above arrangements on behalf
of the Department of Justice and its agencies,

He advised that Bureau representatives should be
present beginning on 2/13/76 in order to oversee the
segregation of documents and to account for and seal material
provided by the Bureau, -

On 2/13/76, and again on 2/17 and 2/20/76, Special
Agents Andrew J, Duffin and Sammy J, Miller of the Senstudy 75
Project were physically present at the HSC offices, along
with representatives of several other departments and
agencies, It is noted the HSC's resolution had expired as
of 1/31/76 and present on behalf of the HSC during this
particular period were only Ms. Jacqueline Hess, HSC Security
Officer, several unidentified HSC Staff Members involved in
extraneous and personal matters not connected with this
project, and a uniformed guard,

Memorandum to Mr, T. W. Leavitt
Re: Houstudy 75

Disposition of House

Select Committee (HSC) Records
62-116464

It was stated by Ms, Hess that there was some
urgency involved with the segregation and transportation
of the HSC documents to CIA as the physical protection
being provided to the HSC premises by the security guard
would cease as of 2/20/76.

It should be noted it was immediately obvious
that chaotic conditions had existed at the HSC, particularly
evident in the complete disarray of their records and
materials, All materials, irrespective of originating
department or agency, were haphazardly commingled and
the elementary records management system attempted by
the HSC, by Ms. Hess' admission, had failed. She stated
HSC Staff Members, in their haste to depart, had returned
documents which had been in their personal possession
en massé, including numerous reproductive copies of various
and sundry documents, as well as personal notes, memoranda
and memorabilia.

At the outset, it was determined the material
furnished by the FBI was accounted for by the HSC upon
receipt only by filing the FBI transmittal LHM adjacent
to a copy of the pertinent HSC request letter in a loose-leaf
binder, (This binder is sealed in carton at CIA marked
"HSC Transmittal Books.”’) Ms. Hess stated that this was
not done in every instance and, in fact, particularly if
the FBI LHM contained pertinent information, it more often
than not was furnished directly to the HSC Staff Member
who had initiated the request, In cases such as this,
the LHM may or may not have ultimately been incorporated
in her notebook.

Memorandum to Mr, T. W. Leavitt
Re: Houstudy 75
Disposition of House Select
Committee (HSC) Records
62-116464

Initially, Ms. Hess had extracted some portions
of the FBI material and had it ready for inventory.
Thereafter, in her search through various filing cabinet
drawers, she would come upon different batches of material
and would make these available. For the most part, these
included not only material originating with the FBI but
from various other departments and agencies, Due to the
enormity of the task, the constraints of time and the
existing working conditions, it was impossible to log in
or itemize each and every FBI document on hand, Therefore,
the inventory undertaken was in the form of accounting
for each FBI response made to HSC requests by locating
each particular responsive LHM and matching it with its
enclosures, if amy. In the absence of the LHM, documents,
which were obviously enclosures, were generically described
and at a later date, through Senstudy 75 Project records
available at FBIHQ, identified with specific HSC requests
and FBI responses, and thereby accounted for.

FBI material inventoried and sealed amounted to
approximately 6 % cardboard cartons which were sealed with
Scotch-brand filament tape and identified on the ends
with the markings "HSC/FBI" followed by an arabic number
for the carton, It is noted that box number 7, in addition
to FBI materials, also contains materials from State, DEA,
Civil Service, OMB, Treasury/IRS and IC. This was done
to limit the number of boxes involved as none of the above
had sufficient material to fill an additional box.

As FBI material was accounted for and sealed,
a Xerox copy of the generic inventory maintained was
provided to Ms, Hess as well as to Ms. Libby Moran, CIA
Review Staff Representative, who was overseeing this entire

matter for CIA. At a subsequent time at FBIHQ, this
generic inventory was reconciled with Senstudy 75 Project
Unit records and an additional inventory was compiled
setting forth in date order HSC requests, noting date of
FBI response, as well as the box number location of the
material involved. Upon completion of this detailed
reconciliation, it was determined that 13 original FBI
LHMs which were sent to the HSC in response to requests,
12 of which had no enclosures, are unaccounted for and,
at this point, they are presumed, by Ms. Hess, destroyed.
(The Snclosures transmitted with the two- were accounted
for.) This presumption is made because Ms, Hess reiterated
many times that LHMs which contained information of
interest to the HSC were often not logged by her and
were forwarded directly to interested HSC Staff Members,
She noted that, during the waning days of the Committee,
much material the Staff Members considered expendable was
destroyed by shredding. Specifically, concerning FBI LHMs,
she stated it was the HSC's position that they, if they
transmitted enclosures, were nothing more than letters

of transmittal requiring no accountability, If they
contained information without enclosures, they were
considered to be Committee, not FBI, property and could
be disposed of at the Committee's pleasure,

In addition, it was determined that two LHMs,
both with enclosures, were unaccounted for and their
disposition is unknown. By way of description, these
documents concern: (1) FBI 9/14/75 response to an 8/19/75
request which transmitted to the HSC four generic lists
regarding tax reports filed by the FBI with the IRS
setting forth deductions made from informant payments
covering calendar years 1970, 1971, 1972 and 1973, These

lists do not identify informants and:‘only set forth amount
of taxes withheld; and (2) FBI 11/11/75 response to a
9/30/75 request which transmitted numerous documents setting
forth the various criteria which have been utilized to
include an individual's name on the ADEX, a chart portraying
a statistical breakdown of the ADEX, authority for
maintaining the ADEX and documents pertaining to its
predecessor, the Security Index.

With the above exceptions, all other FBI responses
were accounted for, it being emphasized again, that not
each and every document was logged. Further, there is no
way of aecounting for the multiple copies of documents
reproduced by the HSC Staff from those made available by
the Bureau, other than to the extent that extra copies
located during the above inventory were personally shredded
by Bureau personnel.

The original generic inventory, as well as the
detailed reconciliation, is being maintained with the
Senstudy 75 Project files.

There.-is attached a 2/27/76 CIA memorandum for
executive branch departments and agencies in which CIA,
as custodian of the documents, asks interested parties to
advise Captain John Matheny, Office of the Assistant to
the President fof National Security Affairs, whether any
documents are missing, Captain Matheny will prepare and
maintain a consolidated list of executive branch documents
which are reported as missing should same be needed for

‘Dear Chairman Pike:

I hereby acknowledge “and accept the tems set forth i in your
letter of February 20 for safekeeping of the three categories of —
sensitive classified documents furnished to or "generated by the. -
House Select Comittee on Intelligence.

“As to the first category, pursuant to ‘your foes the "on -
joan” material which-was loaned to the Select Comittee by the

_ Executive branch hes been received by the CIA and such material
has been retumed to the originating departments and agencies.

With regard to the second category of materials, the trans-~
cripts of testimony taken from current and former Federal officials
in executive sessions of the Select Committee, it is my understanding
that these documents will be placed in the National Archives building
for safekeeping in the custody of the Archivist of the United States,
and that no one is to be given access to these materials pending .

further instructions from the House of Representatives or Speaker of .-_

the House. As you indicated in your letter of Februaxy 20 to the

’ Archivist, highly sensitive classified information is contained in
these transcripts, and they should be treated accordingly by the |
Archivist. I am also concerned about any future plans for the dis-°
position of these transcripts. This material includes information -
involving sensitive sources and methods which I ati charged by law . ~
to protect from unauthorized disclosure.. I would, therefore, :

. appreciate it if you would bring this concern to the attention of
the Speaker of the House and request that I be involved in any :
decision regarding the future disposition of this material. :

‘Finally, with respect to the third category of materials re~ - ;

ceived by the CIA from the Select Committee for storage at CIA

of CIA documents are missing. - The’ materials transterre
Headquarters. for Storage Were initially inventoried arid sealed in -
cartons by’ Executive branch representatives on the premises of the
Select Committee in the presence of Committee staff members during
_ the period of February 18-20. Because a number of documents were
unaccounted for, it was agreed with your staff representative that
certain cartons should be inventoried again to determine whether
the missing doaments might be in those cartons. Thus, a thorough
second inventory of certain sealed cartons was conducted at CIA on
February 21 with your concurrence and in the presence of Ms, Jacqueline
- Hess of the Select Committee staff.’ While a few of the’ missing
documents were found in the second inventory, a remeau of documents |
[ are still aaeebeng

As soon as a complete list of the missing materials is pre-
pared, my representatives will seek an early meeting with you to
determine what measures can be taken to account for or locate the
missing documents. Other Federal agencies are also checking their
records and inventories to determine whether any of their documents.

are missing. : ; a

The foregoing pertains only to the missing materials as we

documents reprocuced by the Select Committee staff from originals
made available by the CIA and other Executive departments and

This is to set forth our suggested response to a request
by the Criminal Division of the Department for detailed information
relating to classified F831 information disclosed by "The Village Voice"
in its 2/16/76 supplement which incorporated portions of the House
Select Committee on Intelligence Activities (HSC) suppressed report.

By memorandum dated 2/13/76, Assistant Attorney
General Richard L. Thornburg, Criminal Division, made reference
to the publication by "The Village Voice" of the HSC suppressed
report, Thornburg, in his memorandum, requested this Bureau solicit
other agencies and to furnish information relating to FBI classified
material that was disclosed in "The Village Voice." He indicated
this inquiry was necessary to determine if any action by the Depart-
xaent of Justice is necessary,

idemorandum from vir. Cassidy to Mr. Wannall dated
1/21/76, captioned "Houstudy,"' advised that appropriate components
of FBIHG had been solicited and only one instance was determined
where classified material appeared in the Draft Final Report of the
HSC, This occurred in the identification of three of our foreign
counterintelligence programs by title, it being noted the names af
these programs had been classified "Secret" by the Attorney General.

Voice," on or about February 11, 1976

3. Whether the classified data disclosed is accurate.

The identities (titles) of these three foreign counter-
intelligence programs as published are accurate.

4, Whether the data came froxa a specific document and,
if so, the origin of the document and the name of the individual
responsible for the security of the classified data disclosed.

As indicated in "The Village Voice" article, the existence
of the three classified counterintelligence programs above was
revealed to staff investigators of the House Select Committee on
Intelligence (HSC) at a briefing held at the Intelligence Division of the
FBI on August 22, 1975. At this time the HSC members were advised
the titles of the three foreign counterintelligence programs had been
classified "Secret" by the Attorney General.

Information relating to the three classified counterintel-
ligence programs was initially set forth by the Attorney General in
letters directed to Senator Frank Church, with a copy to Senator John
Tower; Senator James 0. Eastland, with a copy to Senator Roman L.
Hruska; and to Congressman Don Edwards, with a copy furnished to
Congressman IM. Caldwell Butler, all dated May 17, 1975, and all
classified "Secret.'' This letter states it is classified "Secret"
"because we have been advised that disclosure of references to the
ifexican, Puerto Rican, Yugoslavian and Cuban opergtions could
damage our relations in those areas." Subsequently, on May 23,
1975, the Attorney General issued 2 press release describing five
newly-discovered FBI counterintelligence programs. This release
described "Three foreign intelligence programs classified, ‘Secret, *"
without mentioning the programs by title, :

SECRET

Disclosure and Publieation of Allegedly
Classified Information by "The Village
Voice," on or about February 11, 1976

5. The extent of official dissemination of the data.

The identities of the three programs have not been pub-
licized to date, Dissemination has been made by the FSI to the
Department of Justice and, to our knowledge, by the Department of
Justice only as noted above. The identities of the three programs
were furnished to Central Intelligence Agency in January, 1976.

6. Whether the data has been the subject of prior official
releases.

As indicated, the identities of these three programs have
not been publicized although they have been referred to in a press
release dated May 23, 1975, only as "three foreign intelligence
programs."

% Whether prior clearance for publication or release
of the information was sought from proper authorities.

The FBI réceived no request for prior clearance for
publication or release of the classified titles of the three programs.

8. Whether the material or portions thereof or enough
background data has been published officially or in the press to. make
an educated speculation on the matter possible.

We have no knowledge of any information published
officially or appearing in the press which would make an educated

speculation regarding the identity of the three foreign counterintel-
ligence programs possible.

to members of Congress dated wlay 17, 1973, indicated the informa-
tion was classified "pecause we have been advised that disclosure of
the Liexican, Cuban, Yugoslavian and Puerto Tiean operations could
dazaage our relations in those areas. "

oe Hon. Frank Church
U.S. Senate
Washington, L.C.

Y Dear Sen. Church:

By way of beckground, I served honorably with both the Federal Bureay of Invest.

igstion and the Central Intelligence Agency for 8 combined total of over 33

years. I am proud of my service with each agency and I feel that my activities

were quite worthwhile and in the national interest. I om » graduste of George
7 Washington University Law School and a member of the bar, 1 em now retired.

As an interested and intellectually curious citizen, 1 have been reeding
accounts in the public press concerning the ectivities of the committee which
you happen to chair and of the House Committee which Kep. Otis Pike heppens to
shair, both dealing with the U.S. investigative and intelligence progrems.brief-

ly stated, 1 om totally nauseeted by the irresponsible wey in which both of you
demand highly sensitive ond clessified deta which seems to be publicized soon
after you get it, It is my opinion and thet of many friends thet your committees
are effectively destroying the credibility of these agencies and making impos-
sible their effective performance in the future,

Before going further, let me state thet I do not condone irregulerities, im-
proprieties or illegalities by either agency in their normal,routine activities
but I do see the justificetion,in serious security or Mefia like criminal scti-
vities,for certain Yextracurriculsr" activities to echieve needed ends and I
think that the Congress should quietly recognize such,with reesonable controls.
You should_be proud end complimentary,for instence in my opinion,sbout the
highly publicized end often misrepresented mail intercept progrem when you
stop to realize that it wes confinec to mail to and from Russia and,insofer 4s

q I read, the results were given appropriate ssfeguards.

I have no objection to having some type of scrutiny and supervision of these
agencies by some well qualified and impartial panel and I do not object to
‘ having appropriate edministretive action teken against offending employees end
"i officiels,if their rights are protected, het I do strongly object to is the
s pathetically inept snd horrendously damaging procedures whereby your inguiries
on sensitive matters are regularly reported,sometimes incompletely en
apparent politics] reasons, It just seems to me thet someone connected with your
. committees is efflicted with political "diarrhea of the mouth" which impels.
them to bebble without regard to common sense or the welfere of our intelligence
progrems end, as I read the press, you two gentlemen both have this weakness.

I am sure thet the intelligence organizations of all major nations meke some
mistakes,But have you ever seen the British,the French,the Kussians,the
Germans,the Isreeli or the Japanese governments conduct such a "three ring

t circus" on sensitive matters as you men are doing to your everlasting discredit?
I am sure also thet we are the leughing stock of 211 the above enumereted
nétions. What foreign official will entrust sensitive and confidential date to
U.S, intelligence agents in the foreseesble future when he knows thet he may soon
see his dsta publicized because of some misguided Congressional activity? 1 very
sincerely feel thet strong administrative and/or criminel action should be teken

‘ in any cases where either or both of your committees and/or their personnel heve
been the vehicle for embarrassing or damaging the U.S. by actions which resulted
in confidential data being reported.

1 In order thet there be no misunderstanding,this letter represents nothing
more then my very sincere conviction of great personal contempt and disgust with
the way in which you and your committees have done a great disservice to the
United States by sedly mishandling your responsibilities to these egencies and
to our nation.

Sincerely,
ec: Rep. Otis G. Pike

POisagreement among House subcommittee
embers over guidelines proposed for domestic
\ intelligence activities of the FBI underscores the
- challenge legislators face in making rules that
+ Meet all free society demands without so handi-
capping the bureau that it cannot éffectively do
the job expected of it.
* On the one hand are congressmen like Rep.
Badillo of New York, who argues for tougher
_. guidelines than those suggested. They would pro-
1 hibit ‘instigation or commission by the FBI of
criminal acts, prohibit incitement of violence,
and the dissemination of information to discredit
individuals or groups. On the other hand are
congressmen like Rep. Edwards of California,
who thinks Atty. Gen. Levi has done a good job

- drafting the guidelines. . poe

: {In the middle of the picture is FBI Director '
Clarence Kelley, who appeared before the sub- —

Y committee to warn of the dangers of overly ,

| restrictive guidelines. Box the FBI in too much,
Mr. Kelley was saying in effect, and it will lose its
capability to handle such threats to the public
safety as those -posed by terrorist groups.

Reaction to disclosures of such domestic sur-
yeillance programs as Cointelpro has tilted opin-
ion in the direction of demands for assurance of
greater protection of individual rights and liber-
ties. And, indeed, those rights must be guaran-

lj, teed. In, the matter of curbs on FBI activities,
: however, the familiar pattern of response and _
| over-response is’ showing. The need is to strike ,
1a neat balance.

THE CURRENT CONGRES-
SIONAL investigations into ‘
United Statés intelligence op-
erations are an excellent ex- {
ample of how far this nation
has strayed from its underly-
ing responsibilities. 7

We are genuinely delighted
that Congress at last is trying
to regain some of the balance
+ and authority granted it in the
« Constitution, but really isn’t it |
time the American people,
t themselves regained control of
| the eritire governmental pro-
: cess, including Legislative,:
; Administrative and Judicial |
: branches? l

Many times lately we can.

: believe that the folks in Wash-
ington have so isolated them-
selves from the realities of
: our lives — and those of the
international‘ community —
that we can never fully regain
istoric foundations of repre-
sentative government provid-
d wisely by our forefathers

* 200 years ago. 7

It is all the more tragic that
in this Bicentennial year, the
heart of federal government
‘ has so deteriorated as today to
' represent the largest and
most ominous single threat to
human rights and freedoms
outside the covetous totalitari-
anism from: without.

We certainly would not ad-
vise extreme pessimism as to
, the future. Hu
. However, we would sharply
+ warn that most of the trends
, of not only federal but state
! and in some instances local,
+ governments these days are '
© approaching an irreversible ,
mpoint from which recovery.
“will be impossible. :

It is the beginning of Worle"

man spies and saboteurs, a
feat unparalleled in modern |
times and which would have

underground action by agen- |

’ been impossible without secre-

cy, plus extraordinary extra-
legal surveillance and force
beforehand.

The necessity for keeping
governmental covenants in
such extreme situations is
fairly obvious.

Not so obvious apparently to
many in these seemingly less
perilous times is the necessity
ever to keep at least similar
vigils both at home and

Due to the fact that this matter is being handled in Records Section 7
through normal mail processing procedures, it is most difficult to determine
which specific individual(s) may have typed a certain card or abstract, searched
aparticular name, reviewed a particular file, etc. Therefore, names of
individuals have not been given. In some instances, a specific number of r
individuals involved may be known and, where applicable, this has been shown.

But in some units it is impossible to know even how many persons performed
the work relative to a specific subject. All that can be given in some cases is
the estimated number of hours in a particular grade or level based on production
figures relating to this matter.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Mitchell Rogovin
: SC/DCIL

SUBJECT — : Handling of HSC and SSC Investigative Materials

Representatives of the Department of State, Department of
Defense, Department of Justice, the National Security Council
Staff, end the Central Intelligence Agency have considered al-
ternative ways for storing and handling the materials gathered

_ by the Senate and House Select Committees in their, current study
of the intelligence activities of the government.

The key objectives were those of physically secure storage,
with proper controls over access to the materials, the ultimate
decision on norifal declassification remaining with the depart-

“ments, agencies or organizations that originated the materials.

‘two main alternatives were developed for where the materials
should be stored. These were the National Security Agency (NSA)
and the National Archives and Records Service (NARS), the pre-
ference being for the former. The NSC Staff, in preferring storage
at NSA, specified additional handling provisions for its materials.

Attached are alternative draft resolutions, providing for
* storage at NSA or at NARS. Also attached is the NSC staff pro-
posal for modification of the proposal for storage at NSA, providing
for special handling there of NSC materials. These are intended to
provide a basis for discussions with SSC and HSC personnel.

It is requested that this report be submitted to the ICG. It
is noted that time has become an essential consideration, in view
of the inminent conclusion ‘of the HSC investigation.

andi as pertinent information pertaining to all such deductions
became available, this Bureau would submit to Internal Revenue
Service (IRS) a coded list of informants with tax deductions
withheld for eath, along with a bank check made out to IRS
for the total amcunt withheld. At no time did this Bureau
file any individual tax retuxns for informants. -

Xe should he noted ‘that because IRS records are
now computerized, making it impossible for IRS to provide ~
proper security: for continuance of the above procedure, and
te effect, for this Evreau, a considerable monetary savings
in clerical and agent salaries required te maintain extensive
. vecords in thisi resard, this Bureau, effective August 19, 1975,
diseontinued the practice of besarte tax deductions made
from informant payments,

In sebponse to request Number 2 above, there are
. enelosed tax reports filed by this Bureau with the IRS
' veflecting tax deductions made from informant payments
eovering the calendar years 1970, 1971, 1972 and 1973. A

Authority for maintaining the ADEX stems from the

During the initial period of establishing the ae

_ o£ those individuals who had been maintained on the former

manner on the new ADEX, as cases were reviewsd under our then
existing reporting procedures, each case was to be reviewed
on its own merits utilizing the then current criteria for AREX
to determine whether continued inclusion on the ADEX wag
warranted, If not, the individuai's name.was deleted. As
previously indicated, during 1972 the ADEX wag evaluated and
revised and as a result, the number of individuals who were
.dneluded onthe ADEX began to decline and thus the high number
o£ cancelled cards.: In accordance with Bureau policy, which
was instituted during the SI program, these cancelled cards
are maintained at FBIHG for a period of three years and

thera is no way to reconstruct a former SI or ADEX list for a
particular time period ky reviewing these cancelled cards.
Rhese cards, however, will reflect the identity of those

NOTE:

As previously stated, we neither believe it

“necessary nor desirable to. release copies of the ADEX list
-' due to the sensitive nature of this list. Any release of

information concerning the identity of individuals maintained
on the list could be detrimental to ongoing Bureau investi-
gations, particularly with respect to the identity of those
individuals maintained on the espionage section of the ADEX.

7 Per Thomas D. J. Brooks and James Nolan of the CI~-1 Section,

the espionage section of the ADEX should be classified "Top
Secret" inasmuch as disclosure of certain names on the list
could adversely affect sensitive sources of this Bureau.

. Edward P. Grigalus, Unit Chief, IS-2 Section, should

contact representatives of the CI-1 Section to coordinate

. the clasification of this section of the ADEX.

INTERVIEW OF ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR NICHOLAS F, CALLARAN
BY TIMOTHY OLIPHANT AND RICHARD VERMEIRE OF THE HOUSE
COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE CONCERNING U, S, RECORDING
COMPANY

On December 17, 1975, I was interviewed by Timothy Oliphant and
Richard Vermecire, Investigators from captioned Committee. it had been
indicated to me that the purpose of this interview was to inquire into my
participation at poker games at the Blue Ridge Club sponsored by Joe Tait,
\ President of U. S, Recerdiag Company,

Mr, Oliphant stated the purpose of the interview was as: indicated above
and also asked if they could inquire into my knowledge and/or participation in
connection with the purchase of equipment from the U. 8. Recording Company.

Upon inquiry, Mr, Oliphant was informed that I had participated in a
poker party at the Blue Ridge Club on two or three orcasions but not on any
occasion within the last six or so years. He was also informed that ur, Mohr
was present on these oceasicns and served as a collector for the fee for the cost
of lodgitig and food on the aceasions I attended. He was informed that Mr, Tait
and Mr, Cberdick were probably present; however, n0 business of any kind
was discussed, it belng purely a social event with the primary purpose of getting
away from shop and shop-talk, He was further advised on the occasions that I
was in attendance former Assistant Director Donald Parsons wag the host member
of the Blue Ridge Club, In response to an inquiry as to why I had not attended
in more recent years, he was informed that I did not do so after my youngest
son married and left home as I did uct care to leave the Mrs. alone for the
Assoc. or, RAGE in our residence,

by Timothy Olighant and Richard Vermeire of the House
Corontittee on Intelligence Concerning U. S, Recording
Company

hiv, Tait had a summer place on the Delaware Coast in the area where I likewise
had one and on a few occasions he has ridden by to say hello but hag not visited
extensively nor was any business discussed during these visits,

Messrs, Oliphant and Vermeiro inquired as to the origin of the
rolationship with U. 5S, Recording Company and at what level was the price for
the equipment purchased from U, 8, Recording determined to be satisfactory,

T informed them that my rocollection of the relationship with the U. S. Recording
Corapany dated back to the late 30's or carly 46's and the procedure of purchasing
eonfidential types of equipment was an ongoing procedure at the time I became in-
volved in the Administrative Division, I stated there was no fixed procedure for
ascertaining the precise price or any markup relative thereto inasxauch as the
nature of the items purchased was such that primary reHance was left to the
technicians of our Laboratory who had shopped the industry for the equipment
needed and that any detailed discussion regarding price would normally go through
the procurement officer of the Administrative Division and the tcchnicians in the
Laboratory to see that a reasonable price was being paid but not an exorbitant or
unreasonable price, It was pointed out that procuxement procedures in effect
would require any questionable price to be taken up with higher authority either

in the Laboratory or the Administrative Division to adjudicate such a question and
fo my recollection there had been no orcasions when this had occurred,

Mr, Vermeire inquired as to Mr. Mohr's relationship with the Laboratory
in conection with his position as Assistant to the Direetor and I pointed out that
there were times when the Laboratory was one of the Divisions under his juris-
diction =“ i was sure that the organizational charts they had would ccem to
indicate this,

They inquired if I was aware of the fact that the Blue Ridge Club had
suffered 2 fire and I advised them i had read it in the newspaper, They advised
they first became aware of it on a newscast while on their way to visit the club,

Mx, Vermeire inquired as to whether there was any inquiry being made
into the Burcau's dealings with the U, & Recording Company and he was informed
Director Kelley had instructed an inquiry to be made into the matter right after
the testimony of Mr, Kaiser before the Committee for which they work, Upon

inguiry whether there was any information available as to developments to date
with regard to this matter, thoy were informed since this was an engoing inquiry
it would be inappropriate at this time to discuss such with them. When asked
when the inquiry would be completed, they were informed it would be concluded
very soon as the Director was just as anxious as the Committee was to have the
full picture with regard to this situation. Ovring this discussion Vermeiro
alluded as to the volume of the purchases made in 1971 which information had
been previously furnished te the Committes and it was pointed out that these
purehases resulted from the break-in of our Resident Agency in Media,
Pennsylvania, and the use of U. 8. Recording was two~fold: one, to preserve
the confidentiality of the type of equipment being installed throughout the
country in our Resident Agencies and two, to obtain expedite delivery in con~
nection with such equipment.

ialeo advised Messrs. Cliphant and Vermeire that purchases other
than those of a confidential nature wero made from U. 8, Recording Company
of items on which he was the supplier under the GSA general supply schedule
and where purchases on a competitive bid basis were made by soliciting bids
for items of equipment under this latter procedure he being on the bidder's
moadling list aleng with other manufacturers and supplicra. I pointed out that
procurement of ail equipment adheres to the Federal Procurement Regulations
preseribed by the General Services Administration.

Legal Counsel to Adams Memo
Re: HOUSTUDY |

Section 869 states the following: "No corporation
shall be created, organizéd, or acquired on or after
December 6, 1945, by any officer or agency of the Federal
Government or by any Government corporation for the purpose
of acting as an agency or instrumentality of the United
States, except by Act of Congress or pursuant to an Act of
Congress specifically authorizing such action.

"No wholly owned Government corporation created
by or under the laws of any State, Territory, or possession
of the United States or any political subdivision thereof,
or under the laws of the District of Columbia, shall con-
tinue after June 30, 1948, as an agency or instrumentality
of the United States, and no funds of, or obtained from,
the United States or any agency. thereof, including corpora-
tions, shall be invested in or employed by any such corpora-
tion after that date, except for purposes of liquidation.
The proper corporate authority of every such corporation
shall take the necessary steps to institute dissolution
or liquidation proceedings on or before that date:
Provided, That prior thereto any such corporation may be
reincorporated by Act of Congress for such purposes and
term of existence and with such powers, privileges, and
duties as authorized by such Act, including the power to
take over the assets and assume the liabilities of its re-
spective predecessor corporation. (Dec. 6, 1945, c.557,
Title III, Section 304, 59 Stat. 602.)"

The Act states that its purpose is to solve the
problems of financial control and to provide annual scru-
tiny and current financial control by the Congress of the
financial transactions and operations of Government corpora-
tions through the regular fiscal agencies of the Government.
It prohibits the creation of any Government corporation to
act as an agency or instrumentality of the United States
except by or pursuant to action of Congress.

corporations as proprietaries for undercover purposes.

Legal Counsel to Adams Memo
Re: HOUSTUDY |

The legislative history of the Act heavily em-
phasizes budgetary control of Government corporations. When
the Act was being considered there were estimated to be about
100 separate Government corporations with thousands of
employees and controlling billions of dollars of Government
funds. The corporations engaged in a variety of businesses,
including insurance and finance, as well as Government opera-
tions such as subsidies and flood control. With the increase
and importance of Government corporations, there was increased
recognition by both the legislative and executive branches
that some means be found to coordinate the financial programs
of the corporations with that of the Government as a whole.

FBI proprietaries are under the budgetary control
lof the FBI and do not present the fiscal or budgetary problems
lenvisioned by the Act. The FBI budget, in turn, is prepared
in accordance with Office of Management and Budget Circular
No. A-11 and is subject to extensive review and approval by
the Deparmtment of Justice, the Office of Management and
Budget, the House Appropriations Subcommittee, and the
Senate Appropriations Subcommittee. Therefore, the intent
of the Act is being carried out.

Section 869 prohibits creation of a corporation
"for purposes of acting as an agency or instrumentality of
the. United States Government." A proprietary does not hold
itself out to the public to be an agency or instrumentality
of the Government, and therefore not in conflict with the
statute. It is an investigative method used by the FBI in
furtherance of its duly authorized and assigned task of
investigating. violations of the laws of the United States.
A proprietary is. not a profit-oriented corporation.

Attached Departmental letter of January 23, 1976,
noted above, cites United States!v. MacDaniel, 7 Peters
(32. U.S.) 1, 13-14 (1883), for the proposition that execu-
tive agencies have reasonable latitude for accomplishing
their prescribed responsibilities and do not need specific
statutory authorization for each act done. In that case, the

(3)



Legal Counsel to Adams Memo
Re: HOUSTUDY —

court said, "A practical knowledge of the actions of any one
of the great departments of the government, must convince
every person, that the head of a department, in the distri-
butions of its duties and responsibilities, is often compelled
to exercise his discretion. He is limited in the exercise of
his powers by the law; but it does not follow that he must
show statutory provision for everything he does. No govern-
ment could be administered on such principles. To attempt

to regulate, by law, the minute movements of every part of
the complicated machinery of government, would evince a most
unpardonable ignorance on the subject. Whilst the great out-
lines of its movements may be marked out, and limitation
imposed on the exercise of its. powers, there are numberless
things which must be done, that can neither be anticipated nor
defined and which are essential to the proper action of

_ government."

It is concluded that Title 31, United States Code,
Section 869, should not be interpreted as applying to FBI
proprietaries because it is manifest from the statutory
history that Congress never. contemplated its use in this
type of situation.

Proprietarics

The House Select Committee has requested in-
formally that the Department give its opinion as to
whether the FBI's creation of corporations as pro~
prietaries contravenes the prohibitions set out in
31 U.S.C. 869. Attached is a very rough draft of a
HSC Report which addresses this question. (This draft
was written by a non-lawyer staff member of the BSC
who asked that we not attribute it to him av the HSC).

We would appreciate your preparing an answer to
the HSC's question. John Mintz, Assistant Director
of the FBI is familiar with this matter and may be able
to provide additional useful information concerning it.

_- 4 ; : a ;
A ‘major issue rad by the committce at th@ ime our in-
: yd by

i
vestigation was started was addressed to each of the military

-services. This issue was "what is your justification for

establishing a proprietary, normally a corporation, as a

front for carrying out an intelligence mission?"

The committee raised this question because section 869 of Title

Bl, U.S. Code (1970) states in part as follows:



"(a) No corporation shall be created, organized
ex acquired on or after December 6, 1945, by any
officer or agency of the Federal Government or by
any Government corporation for the purpos of acting
as an agency or instrumentality of the United
States, except by Act of Congress specifically
authorizing such action. :

"(b) No wholly owned Government corporation created
by or under the laws of any State, Territory or 7
possession of the United States or any political sub- !:
division thereof, or under the laws of the District
of columbia, shall continue after June 30, 1948, as
an agency or instrumentality of the United States,
and no funds of, or obtained from, the United States
or any agency thereof, including corporations,

shall be invested in or employed by any such
corporation after that date except for the purposes
of liquidation, ***"

The General Accounting Office in a letter to the Committee
Chairman dated December 10,- 1975 (B-179296) which discussed
the applicability of section 869 to the authority for CIA

to establish -proprietaries stated in reference to the

legislative history of the act stated “we have found no

indication in the legislative history that Congress considered

the formation of corporations for clandestine purposes."

“While it is recognized that the purpose of proprietaries
is to conceal the role of the government in clandestine
activities, the lack of legislative history concerning
formation of clandestine corporations must be accepted. Thus,
section 869 precludes the formation of proprietary corporations

except by Act of Congress.

_ As discussed in the following paragraphs, the Military
services disagreed strongly with the committee position in

this matter. As an example, the Army stated in essence

The Navy, with a somewhat different approach, stated that
ccce ‘proprietaries are established for the sole purpose:
of facilitating the collection of intelligence. The Navy

further stated that the purpose of establishing a proprietary is t

to act as a U.S. government representative without destroying-
the cover of non-attribution.

_The Air Force justified the use of proprietaries by citing in-hovse

.
In summary, the military services have justified the use of

proprietaries on a rather pragmatic basis which states in

essence proprietaries are approved in accordance with regula-
. : tions, cleared by other agencies in the intelligence community,
and could not exist for intelligence purposes if it were
known that the U.S. government had an interest in the

operation of the corporation.

m3 “De
On 1/28/76, at approximately 2:30 p.m., Captain John
Mathney, National Security Council Staff, White House, tele-
phonically contacted Supervisor R. H. Ross, INTD. He advised
that the eight write-ups, which had been furnished to him on
1/26/76 had proved useful. He stated that the write-ups would
be used either by being furnished to the minority members of
the HSC or incorporated into a Presidential rebuttal of the
HSC's report. He advised that he and representatives from
Department of State, Central Intelligence Agency, and Defense
Intelligence Agency were at that time preparing an overall
statement concerning the HSC's Draft Final Report. He then
read a paragraph of the statement prepared regarding that
aspect of the report which dealt with the FBI. It generally
dealt with the fact that the report tried to characterize the
FBI as an inept investigative body and how the report used a)
broad brush approach to discredit the FBI investigations. Af
The prepared statement labeled the report as fallacious in
that the Committee neither balanced nor tempered its report
even though it possessed information which showed that in /
the vast majority of instances, the FBI conducted legal,
proper, and closely supervised investigations.
©
ra Captain Mathney also requested to know whether the
eight write-ups could be furnished to minority members of the
Committee (Representatives McClory, Kasten, Treen, and Milford).
Further, he invited the FBI to have a representative present
with himself and the other agency representatives mentioned
above who were at that time preparing the statement. He was
advised that his two requests would require consideration by
Bureau officials, but that he would be promptly advised.

Ra RR

Assistant Director Wannall was apprised of the above
and Mr. Adams was contacted by him. It was determined that
the Bureau had no objection to the eight write-ups being fur-
nished to the minority members of the Committee and that the

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall
Re: U. S. House Select Committee

On Intelligence Activities (HSC)
62-116464

Bureau did not desire to have a representative participate in
the drafting session. Mr. Adams instructed that Assistant
Attorney General Rex Lee be contacted to see if the Department
had any objection to furnishing any of the write-ups to the
minority members or desired to have a Departmental representa-
tive attend the drafting session. Assistant Attorney General
Lee was telephonically contacted by Supervisor Ross, who
deferred both questions to Mr. Michael Shaheen, Jr., Special
Counsel for Intelligence Coordination. Shaheen was contacted
and apprised of the Bureau's views and stated that it was
"entirely appropriate" for the minority members to be furnished
that information by the White House. Also he felt that there
was no need for a Departmental representative to attend.

Captain Mathney was recontacted (3:15 p.m., 1/28/76
and advised that there was.no objection to the furnishing of
the write-ups and that the Bureau nor Department felt it
necessary to have a representative present with him.

U.S. HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES
TUTERVIEY OF ASSISTANT DIRECTOR DONALD W. ti00RE, JR.

On December 9, 1975, Tim Oliphant, House Select
Committee, contacted me personally regarding poker games
which I attended at Harpers Ferry. Ur. Olipkant was interested
in knowing how many times I attended such games and I
indicated my first attendance vas in November, 1974 and the
last in April, 1975.

Oliphant was interested in knowing what the cost
involved and to whom it vas paid, I indicated that I was
invited by fermer Assistant to the Director J.P. Mohr and
xeeall that the November trip cost $30 and the April trip
$35. Whis money was paid to Hr. J.P. Mohr, and was paid to
incur the expense of 3 meals and 1 night's lodging. He
asked if I knew the other individuals in attendance. I
indicated that I was introduced to all present but was unable
to recall their profeesions or with whom they were associated
other then obviousiy Bureau personnel. He asked if and when
I became acquainted with Jee Tait of U.S. Recording. I
indicated that I met br. Teit on my initial trip in Novenbker,
1974, and again saw hha in April, 1975. At that time I was
unaware with whom Hr. Tait was associated until most recently
when it was published that bir, Tait was, in facet, President
of U.S. Recording Company.

liz, Oliphant was desirous of knowing if I, at any
time during attendance at Harpers Ferry, overheard or engaged
in any conversations involving U.8. Recording, Kaiser Electronics,
precurement of Bureau supplies and/or equipment or any other
discussions concerning official matters of the FEI. I indicated
to ir. Gliphant that this was strictly a secial gathering and J
I was never involved in nor did I ever overhear any conversa~ |. - |
tions relating to his question. I reiterated that I was there, i i
as a guedt to be in the company of associates, merely to an va
socialize and not to engage in and discuss official business. i

in. Oliphant indicated he had no further questions
and appreciated my cooperation in tee g his questions.

interviewed by HSC Staff ember James Olipaant at the Rayburn
House Office Building, V/ashington, ©. C. There was a court
reporter present to record the interview. Gir. Olipzant stated
he did not have the authority to place SA Campbell under oath and
another individual anpeared in the room, placed SA Campbell
under oath and immediately departed the room. GAs Sanny 0.
Coulson and James Stassinos, FBI Legal Counsel Division,
accompanied SA Campbell to the Rayburn Building but were not
present during the actual interview. Approxzizaately one-half way
through the 25 minute interview Oliphant was joined by Richard 5.
Vermeire, HSC Staff Member. SA Casapbell at no time was advised
of his legal rights. £A Campbell requested and was advised he
would reecive a transcript containing the results of the interview.

At the outset SA Campbell was asked bis name, address

SA Campboll rarely saw the purchase order but was telephonically
contacted to see if the merchandise had arrived indicating it was
then necessary to pay for the items. SA Campboll in answer to
questions indicated he did not know the profit margin or how the
mark up on equipment was calculated. A "wild guess" requested
by Mar. Oliphant was that the mark up was 10-15 or 20 per cont
depending on the price of the items and the difficulty oneountered
in obtaining the items.

In answer to questions by Mr. Oliphant, SA Campbell |
advised he bad met Mr. Tait of U. 5. Recording Comanny on |
several occasions in connection with his employment but did not |
know him socially. SA Campbell stated he had heard of the Fargo
Company and had looked at onc of thoir catalogs but never ordered
anything from them. SA Campbell had heard of Gus Obordick and
that he was 2 distributor of Smith & Wesson firearms, |

Veriaeire entered the room at approximately this time and
asked some of the previous questions. LSC Stafi Mombers thon
inquired concerning SA Cazapbell's relationship with Martin Kaiser.
8A Campbell stated he had met Mr. Kaiser while he was visiting in
the Section. He was possibly visiting former SA John Matter, now
retired, and had ract him several times since that time. SA Campbell
had purchased some small radio transmitters from Mer. Kaiser and
looked at some of his car fallowing equipment. Mr. Kaiser's equip~
ment was satisfactory for the price and in some instances Mir. Kaiser
imew the equipment was being purchased by the FBI.

HSC Sta Members asked if 84 Campbell knew John Mohr.
SA Campbell furnished the following information concorning Mr. Mohr
in response to questions. SA Campboll Imew Mr. Mohr as an FDI
official but did not now him socially. He did not hear any rumors |
or gossip that indicated there was anything out of the ordinary between |
ifr, Mohr and Me. Tait. Even after information appeared in the
newspaper SA Campbell stated he would be very surprised if anything
transpired botweon, them that was legal. SA Campboll was at
Mr. Mohr's home to holp repair a TV set which he thought was good
security practice for FBI officials. GA Carapbell never worked on or
hoard of any other FBI employees working on any vehicle owned by
Mr. Mohr. SA Campbell did not know if Mr. iiehr obtained anything
from Mr. Tait at a discount. SA Campbell was instructed to go to
Mr. Mohr's home by his suporvicor who at that time was Mr. Bradiey,

Richard Vermeire, Staff Member of the House Select
Committee, on 1/27/76 advised that at 2:30 p.m. on that date
the House Select Committee was going to consider recommendatidn:
concerning corrective action or legislation necessary as, deter-
mined by the Committee's review of the FBI. Vermeire said that
two of the recommendations troubled him--one being a recommendation
being made to the Committee by the Staff that warrants be necessary
for the use of informants in the domestic intelligence area based
on a probable cause standard.

i
[

Vermeire indicated that both he and Timothy orign} fo
Staff Member of captioned Committee, were concerned with /this
proposal and considered it totally unworkable. He asked/if' the
Bureau could furnish him orally some suggestions or arguments he
might use to convince the Committee that such a warrant require-
ment is not feasible. He was advised that a determination would
be made by the Bureau concerning this and that he would be re-

contacted.

on Vermeire also indicated that they were concerned with
a recommendation for a new oversight committee being created to
review FBI operations. It was pointed out to Vermeire that the

Director had testified on oversight and while he was in favor of

the concept, the Bureau was desirous that oversight functions be

consolidated. In this regard, it was pointed out to Vermeire

that there were currently three Committees in the House claiming

oversight responsibilities pertaining to Bureau operations--Sub-

committee on Government Information and Individual Rights of the

House Committee on Government Operations, Subcommittee on Civil

and Constitutional Rights of the House Committee on the Jy ie 7

Legal Counsel to Mr. Adams
RE: HOUSTUDY |

Vermeire was very appreciative of the information
concerning oversight and asked that he be advised as soon as
possible of any arguments or suggestions the Bureau might have
concerning warrant requirements for informants in the domestic
intelligence area.

Contact was made with SA Thomas J. McNiff of the
Intelligence Division, SENSTUDY 75 Staff, and Steven Blackhurst,
Assistant Special Counsel on Intelligence Coordination in the
Department, regarding Vermeire's request and both agreed that it
would be advantageous to furnish suggested arguments concerning
warrant requirements for informants to the House Select Committee.

Attempts were made to telephonically contact Vermeire
on 1/27/76 to furnish him the requested information unsuccess-
fully and on 1/28/76, Vermeire telephonically contacted SA Paul V.
|Daly of this Division. Vermeire was generally advised of the
jproblems presented by the requirement of warrants based on
probable cause for the utilization of information in the domestic
intelligence area. The arguments were as follows:

(1) The problem in defining the information being
sought by the informant for the Bureau. It was pointed out
that these investigations are by nature difficult to describe
in scope and that a warrant requirement would seem to require
a specification as to what is being sought.

(2) The use of informants in this area is generally
at a very early stage in the investigation at which time it
would be unlikely there would be {sufficient information
available to meet a probable cause standard.

(3) If a court were to issue a warrant for the use
of an informant, what procedures would be necessary for the
court to monitor the use of the informant subsequent to their
approval?

(4) It would appear that such a legislative recom-
mendation would be casting the court in a role to which they
are unaccustomed and moving the courts closer and closer to the
very initiation of an investigation.

RE: HOUSTUDY °

(5) What arrangements or considerations would have
to be made to protect the identity of an informant wherein a
warrant had been sought?

(6) It was pointed out that there would be great
difficulty in drafting a concise or accurate definition of
domestic intelligence investigations.

Vermeire was very appreciative of the aforementioned

arguments and stated he would use these in an attempt to explain
to the Committee the difficulty presented by legislation in this

area.

SA Colby was questioned under oath by staff NY

The purpose of this memorandum is ‘to advise a 4

up and gave it to Mr. Oliphant who at the same time asked
if Colby had dropped it. Colby replied that he did not
think the money belonged to him since he normally did not
carry loose bills in his pocket. Oliphant then handed
the dollar to Mr. Verthiexe who departed from the room to

interviewed. "If the person claims the money, then we
know his testimony will be suspect." At this point the
court reporter entered the room followed by Mr. Vermiere
and Mr. Oliphant immediately commenced the interview.

No further reference to the dollar bill was made by any
of the staff members including Mr. Vermiere who apparently
had returned the dollar bill to the departed staff member.

SA Colby feels since he had no opportunity to
pursue the statements made by Mr. Oliphant that it would
be difficult to establish whether Mr. Oliphant was
"joking" or whether this was in fact a "trick" to
establish the credibility of SA Colby's testimony.
However, it is felt that the details of this encounter
should be brought to the attention of the Bureau for
information in the event similar tactics are employed
by House Select Committee staff.

o£ such equipment, appearing either an the requisition
ax memorandum, were normally ebtained from catalogs
indicating the purchase price nf such items. HSC Staff

U, 8. RECORDING COMPANY

On Becember 9, 1975, Special Agent (SA) John M.
Kirsch was interviewed at the J. Edgar Hoover Building,
Washington, D. C,, by Mr. Timothy Mliphant in the presence
of SA Paul Daly. Mr. Mliphant, whe is representing
Congressman Pike's Committee, inquired concerning social
activities at Harper's Ferry, West Virginia. SA Kirsch
advised that he had attended two such gatherings primarily
composed of Bureau personnel (present and former) during
early 1974, the first such occasion being in January or
February and the second a few months later, probably April,
1974, In response to Mr. Sliphant's question as to who
invited SA Kirsch to attend Harper's Ferry, he was advised
that SA Kirsch attended at the invitation of Assistant to
the Director, Deputy Associate Director Thomas J. Jenkins
who was at that time Assistant Director in charge of
Training Division. Mr. Nliphant asked what the costs were
for meals and Icdging at Harper's Ferry and SA Kirsch
advised that at best he could recall the costs were not
excessive and probably $12 to $15 covered the entire affair.
Certainly no more than $20 was expended at either of the
two outings by SA Kirsch. SA Kirsch did not reeall exactly
whe collected for the meals but believes it was probably
Mr. John Mohr. Mr. Oliphant asked what the table stakes

— Dae, Wexe at Harper's Ferry and SA Kirsch advised that, while

wv. hé could not recall specifically, he believed they were
“rather low, perhaps 10¢ and 25¢. x i

SA Kirsch was specifically asked if he hati{met

SA Verven stated that he was not acquainted in any
manner with a person by the name of Oberdick, He stated
that he was aware that a firm with a name similar to Fargo,
International, marketed electronic surveillance equiprent,
but that he had not had occasion to make any purchases from
such a firm. When questioned concerning a bottle capper
invention allegedly patented by Mr. Tolson, SA Verven advised
he had no knowledge concerning the matter. In reply to
questions concerning personal services provided at the homes
of Bureau officials, SA Verven stated that he was ayvare of
periodic visits made by Radio Engineering Section personnel
to the homes of Bureau officials for the purpose of checking
their telephones and telophone lines for the presence of
electronic surveillance devices. He further advised that he
was atvare of some television servicing being provided in order
that outside persons would not have access to the Bureau
official's home with the possibility of such persons
electronically compromising the promises.

In reply to a question concerning the method of
determining the price of electronic items purchased, SA Verven
stated that the major portion of his purchases consisted of
radio test equipment and that almost all of such test
equipment was purchased from GSA Schedule. He stated further
that prices on ecuipment not available on GSA Schedule wore
obtained from the supplier's catalog, with little or no price
discounting experienced with this type of equipment.

In response to questioning Dir. Cochran advised Messrs.

Since Ceptember, 1973, first as the Neputy Assisiant Director

Messrs. Oliphant and Vermeire inquired as to whether or
not the ultimate purchase price paid is subsequently furnished to
tho Laboratory for verification and justification of the reasonableness
of any mark-up occasioned by the use of confidential channels of

the Laboratory does not have occasion to see the actual payment

They inquired if Mr. Cochran felt a system of requiring Lakoratory review of
confidential procurement mark-ups would be desirable fram the standpoint
of casuring they were reaconable and justified. Mr, Cochran sinted the
Laboratory's position is that such mark-ups are not oceasioned by technical .
considerations, but are based on an operational nced falling within the
procurement responsibility of the Administrative Division. In these
circumstances we are paying for a sorvice - confidentiality. The fact
that past expericnce with U. S. Recording Company has boon highly
favorable in terms of frinse benefits - warranty service, prompt
repairs, procurement of cearce items, and the like - are important
factors, but not the main concern in determining reasonableness of
any mark-up.

believed it was in the spring of 1974, The guests arrived Friday evening
and departed around Saturday noon. The expenses were shared by the
participants, Mr. Adams recalling that immediately upon arriving
Friday evening he was met at the door by Mr. Mobr who advised
Mr. Adams that Mir. Adams’ share of the expenses was $25. This amount

former FBI employees and present and former Central intelligence Agency
employees as well as other present or former Government employees. It

INTERVIEW OF ASSISTANT TO THE DIRECTOR JAMES B. ADAMS
BY TIM OLIPHANT OF THE HOUSE COMMITTSE ON INTELLIGENCE
CONCERNING U. S. RECORDING COMPANY

In response to questions, Mir. Adams advised that he did not
believe he had ever heard of the U. S. Recording Company until recently,
nor was he specifically aware of Mr. Tait's employment with that Company.
He was aware that Mr. Oberdick represented Federal Laboratories and
believed he had beon aware of such fact for several ycars. He believed
he had met Mir. Tait and Mr. Oberdick sometime after commencing his
assignmont to Mr. Mohr's offico as Inspector and Numbor One Man in
April, 1971. He recalled both had visited My. Mohr's office, he having
seen them in the reception room on a couple of occasions. It was pointed
out that ir. Adams' office and desk at that time were located in such a
manner thot he was unable to see visitors entering or leaving the recoption
room, located between Mr. Mohr's office and Mir. Adams office.

Mr. Adams outlined his assignments at FBI Headquarters and
pointed out that these assisnments would not have involved him in
procurement mattors, even while assigned to Mr. Mohr'o office from
April, 1971, until July, 1972. There was a delineation of work assign~
ments to facilitate the flow of mail wiercby Mir. Adame did not as a matter
of course review matters going in to Mar. Moir from subordinate divisions
unless such matters fell within the purview of Mr. Adams' responsibilities.
Purchase matters and procurcment matters were not included among
Mr. Adams' responsibilities. Furthermore, when Mr. Mohr would be on
leave he would be relieved by one of the Assistant Directors under his
supervision, genorally Mr. Callahan of the Administrative Division.
Accordingly, during tho normal course of business Mr. Adams would have
had no occasion to seo any matters pertaining to U. S. Recording Company
and he has no recollection of ever having seen such or beon aware of any
activities of that Company until just recently.

Mr. Adams was asked concerning recent publicity to the effect
that certain files might have been removed from Mr. Hoover's office and
taken up to the Blue Ridge Club for burning and he advised that he had
absolutely no knowledge whatsosver conternin’ any such alleged activity.
He pointed out that 2 thorough inspection inquiry had been conducted with
statements being taken under oath from all pertinent parties without
developing any information that any official files had boon removed from
Mr. Hoover's office and destroyed surreptitiously. Mar. Adams expressed
the hope that the House Committee might see fit to subpoena tho writer of
such articles and attempt to force him to reveal the source of the allegations
in order that the matter mivht be further resolved.

OLIPHANT OF THE HOUSE COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE
CONCEEBNING U. S, RECORDING COLIPANY

iwas interviewed by Tim Olivhent of the House Select Commitieo
on Intelligence on December 9, 1975. The purpose of the interview was
essentially to develop my attendance at the Blue Ridge Red and Gun Club,
Hillskoro, Virginia. Mr, Oliphant briefly advised me how my name was.
obtained by the Committee, stating that it appeared on a list of names
which John Mohr had identified as attendees at the Club for the purpase
of playing poker.

Mr. Gliphant asked me how many times I had been up to the Chub.
I indicated I wasn't quite sure but would estimate that it was between six
and eight occasions, commencing approximately in 1970. Itold
Mr. Oliphant that the invitation was usually extended by Mr, Mohr and
each attendee was requested to share the cost. I told him that I paid 325
on each occasion except for the last one which was $30. This fee covered
room and beard, and beverage if one desired, for Friday night and
Saturday morning. Payment was made directly to Mr, Mohr immediately
upon arrival,

iit. Oliphant asixed if I knew who the member of the Club was
and i responded that while i did not know on my initial attendanee I did
subsequently learn that Mr. Joseph Tait was a Club member, He asked
if Iwas aware Mir. Tait was connected with the U. 8. Recording Company
and I said I was not awaze of this relationship until I read it in the news~
papers. Myr. Oliphant then asked if I knew what Gus Okerdick did for a
living and i told him I did not become aware of Mr. Oberdick's employment
until eae day I happened to see his name along with Fargo Division while
driving in the Kensington, Maryland, area. Since his name was an unusual
one, I made inquiries as to whether this Oberdick was identical to Gus
Oberdick and was advised that he was.

Mir. Oliphant queried as to whether or not there were other
individuals who wore not current or former Burcou omployces or
current or rctired Governmont employcos who attended tha Club. 1
teld him the only individwal I could thin’: of off hand who would fit that
category was Joo Eigonmann who I believed was with Lietro.

Rix. Oliphant then told me it was his belief that Mir. Eigonmonn was
connacted with the Government. Iwas asked if any business was
conducted during these poker affairs and i told him I did not ond could
not recall business being conducted. They were purely social affairs.

Mar. Oliphant asked hoy long I had keen assigned to tho :
Administrative Division ond I replied from Liay, 1961, until my desig-
notion as idx, Jentzins' assistant in April, 1075. 1 told hira thet the
maajor portion of my career in the Administrative Division was in the
Forsonnel Section and that it was not until my assiqment as
Ms, Walsh's deputy in September, 1973, that { had any sugervisory
responsibilities with respect to the other sections in the Administrative
Division. Mr. Olinhont asked for the dates of my assiemment as
Mr. Walsh's deputy and my chet! with the Personnel Section determined
the dates te be September 6, 1973, to April 8, 1975. I explained to
Rix. Oliphant that even though I participated in the overall management of
the Division, Mr. Walsh assumed principal responsibility of the
Procuroment and Administrative Services Section. Bir, Oliphant asked
if I could reenll approving any contracts involving U.S. Recording
Company and I advised I could not. I explained to him that I was not a
Contracting Officer and if I had approved the action of a Contracting
Gificexy I relied on the fact that the equipment requested was justified
and that we had sufficient funds to pay for same prior to the letting of the
bid or purchase of tho equipment.

Riv. Oliphant indicated to me that everyone he had talked to to
éate had related substantially the same information eoncerning the poker
affairs. He was vory cordial during the interview and thanked me for
the information furnished,

experienced difficulty understanding the difference
between precuxement autherity and authority te enter
inte contracts, and eventually their questiens centered
on Bureau eentxacts with U. 8. Recording Crmpany.

In raspense te specific questions, br. Valsh
advised Staff Members that he was mnt acquainted vith

awarded confidential centracts on the basis of experience
and pring relatienship which dexenstrated an ability
te act responsibly in connection with such a contract.
Hr. Walsh advised, however, that there were no written
guidelines cancerning the above, but that was his feeling
as to how a ¢enfidential relationship was developed.
ir. Walsh recalled nnly one eonfidential contract which
he had signed as enntracting officer with U. S. Reearding
Company and that contract was executed in June, 1975,
in the appreximate ameunt nf $168,000. Mr. Walsh stated
that he had nbserved Federal procurement regulatinns
and Lepartnent ef Justice guidelines and that the
eontract had been personally approved by the Attorney
General. HSC Staff Members did not ask, and no information
was furnished them regarding the subject matter of the
contract.

The interview then turned to a discussion of
Mx. Valsh's reenllectien as tn who preceded him as
Aé8sistant Bireetnr of the Administrative Division, and
Staff embers were advised that Mr. Valsh had been
preceded by liz, Hl. P, Callahan, who had in turn been

then asked whether assnelates in the FRI customarily
gave gifts ta departing officials, te which Mx. Walsh
responded that departing Assistant Directors and higher
officials were presented with their badges suitably
mounted, a retirement plaque and geld cuff links. ‘They
then asked as to whether other retirement gifts might be
given to departing nfficials and what part, if any,
Mr. Walsh might have played in this regard. Mr. Walsh
explained there is a eustem in the Administrative Division,

his understanding that the mark-up generally would aot
exceed 15 percent and probably would be less. Concerning
this Durcau's relationship with U. 8. Reenrding Company,
lz. Walsh stated in response to spcelfic questions:

that he had never audited the banks of U. S. Keenrding
Company and that no euch audit hed been eanducted tn
determine the percentage of mark-up; that as contracting
nfficer in the ane abnve-montioned enntract with U, S.

and that he had never made a survey to determine the

IN CERTAIN GOVERNMENT AGENCIES

INTRODUCTION . : 7

Our investigation showed that intelligence
connected proprietaries have been established by the
Army, Navy and Air Force within the Department of ;
Defense and cae heinishees puresd of Investigation (FBI).
“Although the Department of State has an intelligence

gathering mission, the Départment advised the com-

mittee that proprietaries nda never been used as a
front in their intelligence gathering activities.

The proprietaries owned by the Military Services
and the FBI were established to provide a method of
gathering raw intelligence data or to support the

aA *clandestine activities of U.S. agents in such a man-
face that any direct.zconnection between the U.S.

7 government is hidden and would appear non-existent. x

of collecting raw foreign counterintelligence “infor

PBL proprietaries are, in. the criminal investi-
gation field, essentially small operations with a
short life span. Since their mission is to collect , .
evidence for the peseeoucionioe individuals engaged
in criminal activities falling within the Bureau's
jurisdiction, the successful prosecution of the

criminal ends the need for the proprictary and the

d@eal with counter-intelligence as it pertains ‘to
foreign nationals engaged in their country's
intelligence effort carried out in the United States
May or may not be a short range project. Counter-
intelligence information is exchanged with -appro-
priate agencies in the intelligence community.

Our review of financial records covering FBI
proprietaries and conferences with FBI officials
disclosed that about $1.5 million has been spent
in capital outleys and operating expenses since : -
their inception about six years ago, Proprietary have used

a Operation of these proprietaries has involved
the 'purchasing, leasing and/or renting of real
property. In. each* instance, safeguards to protect
the government's interest in the proprietary have
been reviewed within the Bureau and the Department
of Justice. Accounting controls of financial manage-
ment are handied by FBI internal auditors.

The FBI does not have specific regulations,
classified or unclassified, to cover the formation,
operation, or liquidation of a proprietary. We were
advised that safeguards to protect the governments
interest in each proprietary are reviewed within the

Bureau and by the Department of Justice. From

7 7 The FBI's proprietaries do have in most instances
a legitimate’ source of income from commercial FEEEEEEEEE
sources. However, the income is seldom sufficient

. to offset operating expense and the necessary

infusion of funds is reflected on financial state-
. ments in a variety of ways. :
Federal, ‘State, and local taxes, as reflected
in the financial statements examined, have been
paid, but are minimal, due to operating expense

exceeding income in most instances. An FBI
