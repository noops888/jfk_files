The Attorney General

A briefing for Senators Church and Tower has been provided
covering warrantless electronic surveillances { surreptitious entry for
recovery of cryptogranhic material, teletype caverage requested by the
National Security Agency and electronic penctration of communications
equipment requested by the National Security Asency.k Jue White House
asked that agencies of the intelligence community not réspond to any
requests from the ESC covering these matiers until the briefing had been
given. The goal of the briefing was to confine knowledge of these matters
to Senators Church and Tower and avoid proliferation of this information
throughout the 3C staff. In view of this, it is recommended that the
enclosed inaterial not be made available to the SSC staff until it is dis-
cussed with the \white House. I further urge that it be made clear to the
White House that if this material is to be made available to the SSC that
access to the enclosed material be limited to Senators Church, Tower,
and SSC Etatf Director William iiler only.

~~

On September 17, 1975, Mary Wagner, an attorney in the office
of the Deputy Attorney General, accompanied by Bruce Baird, an attorney
recently appointed to the Deputy's office, met with me in my office and
advised that they have been assigned the responsibility of drafting guidelines
for the Attorney: General's approval concerning legal representation of
Department employees. She explained that they view the problem of
legal advice to employees as larger than the request made by the FBI
concerning Bureau ernployees, and that the guidelines would address the
larger problem. She asked for my suggestions concerning the proposed
guidelines.
I told Miss Wagner that in the beginning of the inquiries received ~ a
from the Senate and House Select Committees, we had been advised by the s
Department that a conflict of interest would prohibit Department attorneys, {&
including lawyers in the FBI, from providing legal representation individuallyg
to the employees of the FBi in matters relating to the Senate and House 3:
inquiries. As a consequence we have been advising our employees of the
procedures involved in Congressional committee interviews and appearances
for testimony; the limitations imposed on the employees in regard to sensitive
areas of testimony which might require special approval; their right to
counsel and of the limitation imposed on us that personal counsel would have
to be privately employed. i told Miss Wagner that my reading of the
Attorney General's memorandum for the Director dated September 12, 1975,
was that the Attorney General intended to make personal legal advice available
to employees requesting it and that we would like for the guidelines to be
written broadly enough for employees to receive effective assistance of legal
counsel. f oo Srepmeeat

Memorandum to Mr. Adams
Re: Legal Advice for Present or Former Bureau Employees

I suggested to her that the Attorney General might approve the
appointment of a special counsel within the Department whose responsibilities
would be somewhat similar to those imposed on the Special Counsel for
| Intelligence Coordination in that he would be relieved of other Department
responsibilities and his allegiance would be only to discharging the obligations
of personal counsel when requested by an employee. I suggested that such
special designation would permit the Department lawyer so assigned to
avoid the conflict of interest problem and at the same time it would impose
on him the obligations of the attorney-client privilege.

Miss Wagner commented that she understood that in some cases
handled by the Civil Division of the Department, Government attorneys
represent employees in civil suits, but require that the employee waive
the attorney~client privilege to the extent that should the Government employee
become aware of information that should be communicated to another division
of the Department, the attorney would furnish such information to the other
division. If the attorney learned of criminal conduct on the part of the
employee, he would not be prohibited by the attorney-client privilege from
making such conduct known to the Department.

Ttold Miss Wagner that an essential element of the relationship
between the special counsel for furnishing advice to employees would be
that the attorney-client privilege would apply and it would not be possible
for such a waiver to be required in exchange for providing legal advice.
She agreed.

I suggested to Miss Wagner that the Department special counsel
could be available for consultation concerning such matters as appearances
before Congressional committees and for such preliminary advice as would be
useful to employees called to testify. At the point where the special counsel
determined that the employee required more in-depth legal assistance in order
to protect his legal rights, the special counsel could recommend to the
Deputy Attorney General that the employee should be afforded an opportunity
to have private counsel whose fees would be paid by the Department of
Justice.

Memorandum to Mr. Adams
Re: Legal Advice for Present or Former Bureau Employees

In regard to the question of security clearance for such outside
counsel and the possibility that an employee might seek to employ an
attorney whose background would suggest that he would not be approved
for security clearance, I told Miss Wagner that the provision of private
counsel to an employee would be done in the discretion of the Department
and that a reasonable limitation could well be imposed by the Department
as to those attorneys in private practice who would be eligible for appoint- .
ment to represent individual employees. Such limitation would permit
the Department and the employee to agree upon an attorney who yon be
qualified for security clearance.

Miss Wagner inquired as to when the Department's responsibility
for furnishing legal counsel to an employee should terminate. I told her
that an. appropriate time would be when the Department advised the
employee that a decision had been made to prosecute the employee. Up
to that point the inquiries would have been directed toward the determination
of the circumstances and that the employer-employee relationship would
justify protecting the legal rights of the employee, but at the point at
which the Government determines and so advises the employee that the
employee would be prosecuted, the Government and the employee would
become adversaries.

We discussed the provision in Federal law for the appointment of
counsel for Federal defendants in cases where the defendant is indigent.
I suggested that they consider the possibility that even in those cases
where an employee is to be prosecuted, the Department consider the
possibility of employing existing law to provide counsel to employees
who may become defendants in criminal cases:

4s to the scope of the representation of the employee, I told
Miss Wagner that the initial need is for legal advice in situations where
an employee is called for an interview or testimony by Members,
committees, subcommittees, or other units of the Congress. However, I
explained that due to the publicity of the Congressional inquiries, others may
well be interested in pursuing independent inquiries concerning the same
matters or other matters and that employees may well request legal
advice when they are called for interview or testimony by the Criminal

Memorandum to Mr. Adams
Re: Legai Advice for Present or Former Bureau Employees

Division of the Department, the Civil Rights Division of the Department,

or other Federal Government entities including Federal Grand Juries.
Further, state and local prosecutors and grand juries may seek to inquire
concerning matters within their jurisdiction arising out of the employee's
Federal activities and the employee would require the assistance of counsel.
Therefore, I asked Miss Wagner to include in the guidelines a provision
that legal counsel would be available through the Department for employees
in all circumstances where the employee is being questioned concerning
matters arising out of his employment in the FBI.

T told Miss Wagner that the concluding paragraph in the Attorney
General’s memorandum for the Director indicated the possibility that a
determination would be made in some cases that the employee's activities
were beyond the scope of his duties and in such cases legal counsel would
not be provided. I told her that such a determination would be critical
and the policy followed in making such decisions would color the entire
program of providing legal assistance to employees. Therefore, I
requested Miss Wagner to address the question of scope of duties in the
guidelines by expressing a presumption that the employee's activities
were within the scope of his duties and that such presumption would be
overcome only by 2 showing of facts clearly indicating to the contrary,
and that such determination would be made at least by the Deputy Attorney
General himself.

Ftold Miss Wagner that this matter was most urgent and that the
Special Agents of the FBI throughout the field are anxiously awaiting the
announcement of the Attorney General's policy in regard to availability
of legal advice to employees concerning matters arising out of their
employment. She advised me that woi ik would begin immediately and that
she would be in touch with me concerning its progress, and to discuss
the guidelines as they are developed.

U. S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON
INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC);
INTERVIEW OF FORMER ASSISTANT DIRECTOR JOSEPH K. PONDER
BY SSC STAFF MEMBER

. On August 28, 1975, I received a call from Mike
Epstein of the Staff of the Senate Select Committee. He
said he planned to be in Southern California on Labor Day
weekend and asked whether I would be available for
interview on Sunday, August 31, 1975. I told him I would.
Epstein subsequently called me on August 30 and agreed
to meet me at my home at San Clemente on Sunday afternoon,
August 31, 1975.

The interview with Epstein took place between
3:40 pm and 4:05 pm. This included the time spent in
amenities and general conversation.

Regarding my Bureau background Epstein asked
during what period of time I was Special Agent in Charge
in Atlanta. I told him from April or May 1964 to
December 1966. He asked where I had been assigned before
that (Buffalo) and where I went after leaving Atlanta
(New York). He asked no other questions about my Bureau
career. He asked if I were aware of telephone taps
maintained by the Atlanta Office on Martin Luther King.

I replied that I was aware. of certain taps placed and
removed during my tenure in Atlanta. He asked if there
were such coverage before I arrived in Atlanta and I told
him I was not aware of any. In response to these and

other subsequent questions I pointed out to Epstein that

I had not been personally involved in the King matter,

that I had various other responsibilities in Atlanta and
that after ten years I cannot now clearly recall information
which might answer his questions..I told him that every-
thing that was done was properly recorded, that the

records were accurate, and wherever my recollection differs
from the record, he should rely on the record to determine
what happened.

This document contains neither recommendations nor conclusions

of the FBI. It is the property of the FBI and is loaned to
your agency; it and its contents are not to be distributed

outside your agency.

U. S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON
INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC);

INTERVIEW OF FORMER ASSISTANT DIRECTOR JOSEPH K. PONDER
BY SSC STAFF MEMBER

He asked whether the request for the King
coverage originated at the Bureau or in Atlanta. told
him I did not recall, but that in any case it was
approved by the Bureau. He asked where it was monitored
and I told him the monitoring was done in an apartment
rented for that purpose. He asked if I knew the name in
which the apartment was rented and I said I did not. He
asked why the taps were discontinued and I told him I
do not now recall whether I was told why they were
discontinued, but if I were I cannot now recall the
reason. He asked whether we had a bug oh King as opposed
to a tap and I told him, "no." He asked whether it were
possible there were taps and ‘bugs placed and maintained
without my knowledge. I told him that was not possible
because of the size of the office and the relationship
I had with the supervisors and Agents that nothing was
done without my knowledge or without Bureau approval.

Epstein asked whether we had conducted any
Counterintelligence Program against King or the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference and I told him I recalled
none. He asked whether we had made efforts to prevent
King from receiving the Nobel Prize or efforts to interfere
with or make more difficult the raising of funds for a
banquet to honor King for his receipt of the Nobel Prize.

I told him I knew of no such efforts.

He asked whether Sullivan (Assistant Director
William C. Sullivan) had visited Atlanta. I told him
Sullivan had been to Atlanta in connection with a regional
conference dealing with the Bureau's investigation of the
Klan. He wanted to know if Baumgartner had been with Sullivan
and I told him I thought so. He asked who else had
accompanied Sullivan and I told him Arbor Gray had
accompanied Sullivan and perhaps someone else whose name
I cannot now recall. He asked whether Sullivan had met
with Ralph Magill (then publisher of the Atlanta
Constitution). I told him Sullivan may have met with Magill,
that I may have accompanied Sullivan to Magill's office,
but I cannot specifically recall such a meeting and if it

were held I cannot recall anything discussed. He asked
the purpose of such a meeting and I told him if such a
meeting took place it was in the nature of a social

call with Sullivan paying his respects to Magill and a
public: relations~type of meeting. He asked whether there
was any discussion between Sullivan and Magill regarding
any anti-King activities and I told him, "no." He asked
whether Sullivan had made any other visits to Atlanta
and I told him I knew of none.

He asked whether I was aware of any inquiry
made by the Bureau into the handling of the King
investigation either through the Inspection Staff or
otherwise. I told him I was not aware of any. He asked
whether Nichols, the Agent assigned to the King
investigation had been in Atlanta while I was there. I
told him I had hazy recall of Nichols, but did not
recall him. He asked the same thing about Al Sentinella.
I told him Sentinella was there when I arrived and was
still there when I left Atlanta. He asked who had
supervised the Security Squad. I told him Supervisor
Charles Harding.

of FBI SA Fred J, Cassidy by a Staff Member of the SSC. Cassidy
is currently assigned to FBI Headquarters. The details of the
interviev are as furnished by Cassidy.

On advance notice from Mrs Loch Johnson, SSC Staff
Merber, Cassidy was advised that he was to be interviewed on
August 20, 1975. Cassidy was informed by the Legal Counsel
Division of the FBI that he was being released from any
applicable enployment agreement for purposes of the SSC interview
concerning the Huston Plan. It was explained to Cassidy that
he had a right to counsel; however; the FBI was unable to provide
private counsel. Cassidy was rise told that there were certain
privileged areas concerning which he would not be required to
answer questions. ‘These areas concern information which might
divulge the identities of FBI sources; information relating to
sensitive nethods and techniques; information which might adversely
aifect ongoing FBE investigations; and information which had
originated with other agencies, including foreign intelligence
agencies. Cassidy was informed that if a question arose during
the interview in one of these areas, he had the privilege, before
replying, of consulting with an FBI representative.

U. S&S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE
TO STUDY GOVERNMENTAL OPERATIONS
WITH RESPECT TO INTELLIGENCH ACTIVITIES (SSC)

RE: INTERVIEW OF FBI SPECIAL AGENT (SA)
FRED J, CASSIDY BY SSC STAFF MEMBER

On August 20, 1975, Mr. Lech Johnson of the Senate
Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect
to Intelligence Activities (SSC) staff interviewed me in ny
office, Room 4821, JHH Building, concerning my knowledge of,
and participation in, the so-called "Huston Plan."

Mr. Johnson did not place me under oath or advise me
of my rights.

Ke asked about my background which I provided, including
the fact that I have been a Special Agent of the FBI since
August 7, 1950,

With regard to the extent of my participation in the
Huston Plan, I advised lr. Johnson that I was sclected by former
Assistant Director Willian C, Sullivan to act as the liaison
officer for the plan, probably because of my experience in the
FBI Domestic Liaison Section and my extensive liaison contacts
through my participation in the various United States Intelligence
Board (USIB) Cormittees. My duties with regard to the Huston Plan
were to insure that appropriate notification of meetings was made
and that the various papers prepared as the result of meetings
held were delivered to the proper individuals in the other agencies
participating in the plan. Some of the papers were delivered
personally by me, others were sent by courier.

I advised Mr. Johnson that I was generally aware of
the contents of the papers prepared through my attendance at the
meetings of the working group and discussions with participating
personnels however, I personally made no input nor did I participate
in the preparation of the workpapers or the finished product.

U. 5, SENATE SELECT COMMITTER
TO STUDY GOVERNMENTAL OPERATIONS
WITH RESPECT TO INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

RE: INTERVIEW OF FBI SPECIAL AGENT (SA)
FRED J. CASSIDY BY SSC STAFF MEMBER

ie. Johnson asked if I had met Tom Charles Huston
priory to the initial meeting of the Huston Plan working group.
I advised hin that I had never heard of Huston prior to the
mentioning of his name by W. C. Sullivan at the initial necting
of FBI personnel involved in the Huston Plan, which meeting
occurred early in June, 1970, and had never seen him until the
first meeting of the working group held at CIA Headquarters,
Langley, Virginia, shortly thereafter.

Me, Johnson asked about the initial meeting of FBI
personnel concerning the Huston Plan. I told him it was held
in Mr, Sullivan's conference room in the Federal Triangle
Building and that as best as I could recall it was attended by
Me. Sullivan and the branch Inspectors of the Intelligence
Division as well as the Section Chiefs, Sullivan told us of

' the plan and as I recall indicated this was a golden opportunity

to regain the coverage afforded by technigues, which had been
denied us for the most part, since 1967, [I told him that in ny
view Sullivan was going to make this one last effort to regain
the coverage and if this effort failed was prepared to retire.

lr. Johnson asked if former Inspector T. J. Smith was
at this meeting, I told him I could not recall,

The initial meeting of the Ad Hoc group at CIA was
discussed and I advised him that, as I recalled, at that meoting
it was decided that cach participating agency would submit a
paper listing the restraints on their particular agency which
were hampering them in doing their job. I pointed out that the
FBI submitted an extensive list of restraints and that this paper
was circulated to the other participating agencies without being
Cleared through Mr. Hoover.

WITH RESPECT TO INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (S8c)

RE: INTERVIEW OF FBI SPECIAL AGENT (SA)
FRED J, CASSIDY BY SSC STAFF MEMBER

Me. Johnson asked if I was aware of who was the
instigator of the Huston Plan, if told hin I had no direct
knowledge but would suspect it was W. C, Sullivan, Huston, or
possibly formor Assistant Attorney General Robert Mardian;
however, the answer to his question would have to be obtained
poe individuals or such records as he may be able to

OCB Les

He asked my impression of Tom Charles Huston. I toid
hin I felt Duston was a very bright young man who saw this plan
as an opportunity to become the Henry Kissinger of domestic
security and thereby enhance himself and his political career,

Mc. Johnson stated that bis investigation had developed
‘that Sullivan at the outset of the plan appeared to want to push
through the plan; however, he seened to take a direct turnabout
and began to advise ir. Hoover against adopting some of the
Proposais being made by the various participating agencics. He
said it was his impression that this turnabout occurred at the
tine Sullivan was promoted to Number Threc Man in the Bureau,
He asked if I could shed any light on this turn of events.

I told Mr. Johnson that I could not speak for Sullivan
and could only give him my impression of what occurred, that being
at the outset of the plan Sullivan truly felt this was a golden
opportunity to get the coverage back, and docided to lay his job
on the line to accomplish this. When he was moved up to the
Number Three job, I felt he saw the opportunity te someday become
the Director of the FBI. Further, as the drafts of the plan were
being written, Sullivan realized that sooner or later Mr. Hoover
would gee them and at that time realize that Sullivan had dissen-
inated to the intelligence community ali of the restraints
Mr. Hoover had imposed on the FBI.

Sullivan then tried to have the other agencies
Listed as the agenejéswhich submitted the restraints. Having
accomplished this, he was then in a position to advise Hr. Hoover
that this or that was not wise or necestary. When the final
voport was prepared, the FBI then footnoted most of the recon
nendations as opposing then,

Me, Johnson said he had boen advised by My. Helms and
Adniral Gaylor that the final draft which they reviewed prior to
going to te, Hoover's office to sign it did not contain the
footnotes and that they were not aware that the FBI was objecting
to the recommendations until they saw the final vergion of the
report in Hr. Hoover's office,

i told him that I cannot specifically recall what was_
ain the final draft; hovever, I wan aware that all of tho working
croup was ayare of the FBI position as it was so stated at the
necting in which the draft was hammercd out. I told hin I
specifically recalled this as it had put tr. Sullivan in a most
enbarrassing position, At one point when asked why 2 change was
to be made or why the FBI was going to object, Sullivan responded
with words to the effect that because lie. Hoover raid so.

Ur. Johnson asked why covert mil coverage was listed
ag a restraint as CIA was engaged in such coverage in 1970. I
told him I was not in a position to discuss CIA operations with
hin, He aigso asked about the removal of restrictions or use of
purreptitious entries to obtain cryptographic materials. I told
him I wag not free to discuss such activity vith hin,

@ document dated December 17,°1964.. As indicated on page 2
of this document, it was approved for Mr. Sullivan by
someone whose initfels appear to the right of "!CS/."

Although we cannot say with ebsolute certainty who that person ~

might have been, the inittala appear to be those of former

FBI Special Agent (SA) Daniel J. Brennan, Former SAE. R.
Cleyton approved the communication for Mr. Tolson. Notations .
on page 2 indicate that Mr. Belmont approved it and also
advised PBI Director Hoover of its contents on December 18,
presumably 1964. No written approval by Mr. Hoover ignoted.

: In respect to %tem 21, we are delivering a document
dated August 24, 1967, We have previously furnished the

- 886, by memorandum dated June 24, 1975, and subtitled "Request
Perteining to. Blectrofic Surveillance,” an excised ‘copy of

the August. 24, 1967, document. The copy which is now being

foreign intelligence service, the nate of thet service and

delivered herewith, where no notation appears as to reason
for excision, the excision was mede for the reason thet the .
information actually summrizes or quotes from conversations
monitored during electronic survelliances of King. In some
eases, it can be. ascertained precisely what information in
FBI files came from electronic surveillances of Dr. King;
however, there exist areas vhate documentation of the

be made. Therefore, no assurances can ba given that portions

The enclosed article, captioned as above, is the
one we have been preparing in line with approval of our
recommendation to disseminate it on a select basis at a
very high level to show current communist activities in
relation to the Negro movement. It incorporates up-to-date’
material just received from our New York Office relating
to the recent meeting of the Communist Party's National
Executive Committee. Discussion of racial matters was vay
primary topic at the week- -long meeting.

x The enclosed article is a factual, Peer

tthat it would be of interest not only to the Attorney General
but also to Mr. O'Donnell, at the White House; Mr. McCone, at
the Central Intelligence Agency; Mr. Rusk, at the Department i
of State; as well as to Mr.\ McNamara and the three Armed Forces

This paper is an up~to-date revision of the one by the same title prepared
under the date of October 16, 1963. In updating it we emphasized three

Party, USA members, current and former Party sympathizers_and his continued
xeliance on the long-time communist! Stanley David Levison;/ (2) facts
relating to the mor 3 of King; and (3) the recent and curreht
Party aims and activities‘relative to the racial.movenent.

RECOMMENDATION:
Upon approval » consideration will be given to appropriate dissemina~

“-+¥,. S. Government are involved, The Atlanta Office has

recommended that Senator Richard Russell (D, Georgia) be
advised concerning this matter. This appeans inadvisable
since such action could conceivably cause repercussions which
would only aggravate the racial situation that exists in the
South.

It is felt that Dr. Leland J, Haworth, Director,
NSF, should be, furnished information regar ing communist
influences exerted on the SCIC and King. in this regard --
we xvecently disseminated to the White House and the :
heads of the intelligence community copies of a "Top Secret"
summary entitled "Communism and the Ne: Movenent--& 7
Current Analysis" which contains information regarding the
SCIC and King, This summary deals with King's communist
connections and his personal jgmorai ties, With the

Mr, Tolson has suggested, and the Director agreed, 4), \
that the monograph on Martin Luther King, Jr., be brought
up to date,

This is an excellent suggestion and we have alre dy
started the necessary research, Bringing this monograph up to
date and disseminating it at high level prior to King's 'Wash-
ington Spring Project" should serve again to remind top-level
officials in Government of the wholly disreputable eiieaae
of King.

As you know, King's "Washington Spring Project" was
originally scheduled for early April, 1968, However, our
Washington Field Office has developed information that King's

group is experiencing difficulty in recruiting individuals
: to participate in the demonstration and the date for the project
has now tentatively been set for April 27, 1968.

Because of the importance of doing a thorough. job on *}
this, we will conduct an exhaustive file review to bring togethe}
the most complete and up-to-date information and to present it
in a hard-hitting manner, To make the brief timely, we will
have it completed and ready for dissemination by March 14, 1968.

The Attorney General

NOTE:

Issue raised by the SSC here is that they have
detected in their investigation of the Internal Revenue
Service and through review of Cointelpro documents furnished
to them by the FBI instances relating to FBI use of tax
return information, Included in this material were a
number of cases in which the FBI locally requested and,
according to the documents, received tax returns or tax
return information from Internal Revenue Service employees,
Earlier the SSC had sought to interview individuals who
assisted us in several of our Cointelpro operations, We
Successfully resisted these attempts to obtain the identities
of such individuals and our assent to such interview by the
SSC, We were suStained in our position by the Attorney
General, Our position was based on the fact that we considered
that we had an obligation, expressed or implied, of confi-
dentiality toward such sources who had acted on our behalf,

The SSC now raises a question as to whether our
position concerning contacts with and identities of employees
of the Internal Revenue Service is the same as with the
"confidential sources," For the reasons cited in our letter
we do not believe it would be possible to sustain such an
argunent,

SUBJECT: Senate Select Committee Request.

The attached letter is self-explanatory and, put in distilled
form, asks the following question:

Ave employees of the IRS who supplied tax returns or tax
return information to agents of the FBI in response to formal or
informal requests made by Bureau agents to be characterized as ~
"confidential sources" and, as such, to be spared being interviewed
by the Select Committee?

Because the Attorney General and the Bureau have previously
addressed the Bureau's position on the nondisclosure of its sources
for interview purposes by the SSC staff, and because the issue raised
in the attached letter may represent a clear exception to the earlier
resolution of the Bureau's COINTELPRO-sources problem, I am forwarding
this to you for your prompt attention and views for early transmittal
to the Attorney General. I shall appreciate the receipt of your
views on or before COB Thursday, September 11, 1975.

Washington, D. C. 20530 : PRL INTORMATION CONTAINED

Dear Mike: eines cat ofall

In connection with our investigation of the
Internal Revenue Service, we have received a number of FBI
COINTELPRO documents relating to FBI use of tax return
information. Included in this material are a number of !
cases in which the FBI locally requested and, according
to the documents, received tax returns or tax return in-
formation from IRS employees, such as the locai Chief of
ae or Chief of Intelligence.

we anaastend are oe maaan 1

We wish to determine whether these requests
were treated by the IRS as official requests and pre-
scribed procedures thus followed for disclosure of the
information, or whether the requests were treated as
informal requests and prescribed procedures ignored. We
cannot make this determination solely on the basis of the
FBI documents we have reviewed. In many cases, the only ~
way to determine how the requests were treated will be to
interview the IRS employees who handled the requests.

Since these requests were directed to a federal

On 9/9/75, John ELLif£, Domestic Task Force Head of

the Senate Select Committee, telephonically contacted SA Paul V.

Daly and requested that SA Douglas MacDougall be released for

purposes of submitting to a Staif interview concerning mail

openings.

E1liff stated that he was currently being: interviewed
by Senate Select Committee Staff Members on mail covers; however,
he indicated there is an apparent misunderstanding as the Senaté tj
Select Committee also requested that he be made available for }
Staff interview on mail openings at the same time. E11iff was //
advised that this was not true and that James Dick of the Senate
Select Committee had requested only a release insofar as mail
covers was concerned for purposes of an interview with MacDougall
and that this particular topic had been confirmed with Dick on a
separate occasion to insure that their intent insofar as MacDougall
was. concerned was to interview him on mail covers. El1Liff then
requested that MacDougall be released for mail openings and in-
quired as to how long this particular procedure might take. He
was informed that prior to MacDougall's being made available for
such an interview the Bureau would brief MacDougall concerning
his Fifth Amendment rights and would want MacDougall to have
sufficient time to consider whether he might want to retain
private counsel or whatever other steps he feels necessary to
protect his rights.

E11Lif£ subsequently recontacted SA Paul V. Daly
telephonically and stated he had checked with James Dick,
Senate Select Committee Staff Member, and determined that
Dick had only asked that MacDougall be made, available for
interview concerning mail covers. EL1iff stated that ears f

RE: SENSTUDY 75

MacDougall had traveled from New, York for purposes of this
particular interview, they felt that it would be in their
interest to also interview MacDougall concerning mail
openings. He requested that MacDougall be released for
purposes of the mail openings interview. He also informed
SA Daly that after the mail covers interview, MacDougall
will return to the Bureau so that he can be appropriately
briefed by the Legal Counsel Division concerning his Fifth
Amendment rights.

RECOMMENDATION:

That SA MacDougall be released from existing
‘employment agreement for purposes of interview by. the

or to fit his personal travel plans. He was pleasant,
low-keyed, and not at all aggressive or probing and I
had the impression that he learned nothing during the
q interview that he had not known before. I told him

} of this ten year old matter is very poor, that he should
I rely on the records made at the time for a more accurate
account.

DATE 12 BY } '

U. S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON
INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC);
INTERVIEW OF FORMER ASSISTANT DIRECTOR JOSEPH K. PONDER
BY SSC STAFF MEMBER

On August 28, 1975, I received a call from Mike
Epstein of the Staff of the Senate Select Committee. He
said he planned to be in Southern California on Labor Day
weekend and asked whether I would be available for
interview on Sunday, August 31, 1975. I told him I would.
Epstein subsequently called me on August 30 and agreed
to meet me at my home at San Clemente on Sunday afternoon,
August 31, 1975.

The interview with Epstein took place between
3:40 pm and 4:05 pm. This included the time spent in
amenities and general conversation.

Regarding my Bureau background Epstein asked
during what period of time I was Special Agent in Charge
in Atlanta. I told him from April or May 1964 to
December 1966. He asked where I had been assigned before
that (Buffalo) and where I went after leaving Atlanta
(New York). He asked no other questions about my Bureau
career. He asked if I were aware of telephone taps
maintained by the Atlanta Office on Martin Luther King.

I replied that I was aware of certain taps placed and
removed during my tenure in Atlanta. He asked if there
were such coverage before I arrived in Atlanta and I told
him I was not aware of any. In response to these and

other subsequent questions I pointed out to Epstein that

I had not been personally involved in the King matter,

that I had various other responsibilities in Atlanta and
that after ten years I cannot now clearly recall information
which might answer his questions. I told him that every-
thing that was done was properly recorded, that the

records were accurate, and wherever my recollection differs
from the record, he should rely on the record to determine
what happened.

This document contains neither recommendations nor conclusions
of the FBI. It is the property of the FBI and is loaned to
your agency; it and its contents are not to be distributed
outside your agency.

U. S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON
INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC);
INTERVIEW OF FORMER ASSISTANT DIRECTOR JOSEPH K. PONDER
BY SSC STAFF MEMBER

He asked whether the request for the King
coverage originated at the Bureau or in Atlanta. I told
him I did not recall, but that in any case it was
approved by the Bureau. He asked where it was monitored
and I told him the monitoring was done in an apartment
rented for that purpose. He asked if I knew the name in
which the apartment was rented and I said I did not. He
asked why the taps were discontinued and I told him I
do not now recall whether I was told why they were
: discontinued, but if I were I cannot now recall the
reason. He asked whether we had a bug on King as opposed
to a tap and I told him, "no." He asked whether it were
possible there were taps and bugs placed and maintained
without my knowledge. I told him that was not possible
because of the size of the office and the relationship
I had with the supervisors and Agents that nothing was
done without my knowledge or without Bureau approval.

Epstein asked whether we had conducted any
Counterintelligence Program against King or the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference and I told him I recalled
none. He asked whether we had made efforts to prevent
King from receiving the Nobel Prize or efforts to interfere
with or make more difficult the raising of funds for a
banquet to honor King for his receipt of the Nobel Prize.

I told him I knew of no such efforts.

He asked whether Sullivan (Assistant Director
William C. Sullivan) had visited Atlanta. I told him

Sullivan had been to Atlanta in connection with a regional
conference dealing with the Bureau's investigation of the
Klan. Hé wanted to know if Baumgartner had been with Sullivan
and I told him I thought so. He asked who else had
accompanied Sullivan and I told him Arbor Gray had
accompanied Sullivan and perhaps someone else whose name
I cannot now recall. He asked whether Sullivan had met
with Ralph Magill (then publisher of the Atlanta
Constitution). I told him Sullivan may have met with Magill,
that I may have accompanied Sullivan to Magill's office,
but I cannot specifically recall such a meeting and if it

were held I cannot recall anything discussed. He asked
the purpose of such a meeting and I told him if such a
meeting took place it was in the nature of a social

call with Sullivan paying his respects to Magill and a
public: relations-type of meeting. He asked whether there
was any discussion between Sullivan and Magill regarding
any anti-King activities and I told him, "no." He asked
whether Sullivan had made any other visits to Atlanta
and I told him I knew of none.

He asked whether I was aware of any inquiry
made by the Bureau into the handling of the King
investigation either through the Inspection Staff or
otherwise. I told him I was not aware of any. He asked
whether Nichols, the Agent assigned to the King
investigation had been in Atlanta while I was there. I
told him I had hazy recall of Nichols, but did not
recall him. He asked the same thing about Al Sentinella.
I told him Sentinella was there when I arrived and was
still there when I left Atlanta. He asked who had
supervised the Security Squad. I told him Supervisor
Charles Harding.

Y Dear Mr. Kelley: DATE ~
In accordance with instructions received from é
) the Bureau, I am enclosing a bill in the amount of $750.00 w
from the law firm of Kantor, Shaw & Davidoff. Mr. Herbert . ~
Kantor is an attorney who agked as my counsel during an WR
appearance by me before th: mate Select Committee on “N
Intelligence Operations in WeSHIRECONS DCS SR eaeust 12, 1
1975.

After notification by the Committee and the Bureau , y
that my appearance had been requested, I was advised by the seperate
Legal Department of the Bureau that I had the right to have 8
an attorney accompany me during my appearance, I was also et
advised by the Bureau that neither they nor the Department aad

of Justice could provide me with counsel due to a possible
conflict of interest on their part.

The matters to be discussed before the Committee
invelved only my prior official duties in the counter-
intelligence field. At this point, I strongly believed
that to best protect both my constitutional privileges and
the Bureau’s overriding interest, the most prudent course
of action would indicate the retention of an attorney. I
would like to advise you that much thought was paid to the
selection of an attorney since confidential Bureau activities
would have to be discussed with him and it was felt that the

person selected would, in effect, be representing the Bureau
in éddition to wm self. eee 2

September 3, 1975
Atlanta, Georgia

On September 2, 1975, Mr. Paul G. Wallach, Counsel
to the Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with
Respect to Intelligence Activities of the United States Senate
arrived at my office located at 6165 Barfield Road, Atlanta,
Georgia 30302, at approximately 10:10 a.m. His interview with
me commenced at approximately 10:15 a.m. and lasted until
approximately 10:50 a.m. This interview was not conducted
under oath. Mr. Wallach did not advise me of my rights. I
drove Mr. Wallach to Perimeter Mall where he caught the 11:00 a.m.
bus to the Airport.

: During the interview Mr. Wallach asked how long
I had served in the Federal Bureau of Investigation and what
areas I worked in during my FBI career. He was told that my
FBI career started on March 19, 1951, and ended with my
retirement on January 27, 1973. During this time I was
assigned to criminal work for two years, worked in the Soviet
Intelligence field for approximately 17 years, and again handled
criminal work for the last three years of my Bureau career.

Wallach wanted to know if I worked with James Kehoe.
I told him that for the most part Kehoe and I were on different
squads, although we both worked in the Soviet Intelligence
field. We did work on the same squad during the first years
of our assignment to this type of work.

Wailach wanted to know if I was aware of the operation
involving the mail at Kennedy Airport and at other post offices
in the New York area. I told him that officially I was not aware
of these operations but that in fact I knew of the operations.
Wallach wanted to know if I had ever been assigned to work in
a post office and my answer was "no".

Wallach then wanted to know if I was acquainted
with Sam Jaffee. After my affirmative answer he wanted to
know how I met him, why I interviewed him, whether I had to
have permission to interview him, what kind of information
he furnished, whether I had ever asked him to do anything,
and whether Jaffee was an informant. He also wanted to know
when I first met Jaffee, how frequently I saw him, over what
period of time I was seeing him, and when I last saw him.

NW 65360 Docld:32989653 Page 166



I told Wallach that I could not remember dates
and other details of my relationship with Jaffee,but that
information responsive to his questions could be found
recorded in FBI files as I had prepared detailed memos
reflecting all of my contacts with Jaffee. I told Wallach
that if he were entitled to the information he was seeking,
I'd suggest that he get hold of the file on Jaffee. Wallach
said he understood my position, but that before going through
the process of getting a file "they" liked to talk to a few
individuals to see if information the Committee had was
worth pursuing.

Wallach acknowledged that it would not be possible
for me to furnish specific information, such as dates, after
the passage of such a long period of time. Thereafter, in
response to inquiry, he was told that Jaffee was in contact
with many diplomatic officials, including Soviets, in his
capacity as a CBS newsman. I could not specifically remember
how this information came to the Bureau's attention. I did
have some background information on Jaffee and it was necessary
for me to get permission before I could interview him. He
was told that I did not know specifically who authorized the
interview.

Wallach wanted to know what approach was used
during the initial interview with Jaffee. He was told that
I could not specifically recall this information, but &hat
John Willis and I conducted the interview. Both of us were
keenly aware of the FBI's policy of not interfering with the
Freedom 6£ the Press and we wanted to make sure that Jaffee
understood this. We also wanted to make sure that Jaffee
understood that we did not want to place him in a difficult
or embarrassing position by talking to him and that if he
found our presence to be a problem we would leave immediately.
He was told that Jaffee proved to be most cooperative and that
thereafter we were in contact with Jaffee frequently. Wallach
wanted to know how often and he was told that sometimes we
were in contact with him two or three times a week, once
every two weeks, or perhaps once a month. He was told that
all contacts were recorded in writing in the file, along with
the results of the contact.

Concerning information which Jaffee furnished,
Wallach was told that Jaffee furnished information concerning
current events of major and minor importance on the inter~
national scene, which came to his attention as a result of

} NW 65360 Docid:32989653 Page 167



ee |  @

his contacts with numerous individuals in diplomatic
circles. He was again told that all of this information
was reduced to writing and I understood that it was
disseminated to other government agencies, including

the U. S. Mission to the UN and the State Department.
Wallach wanted to know how I knew this to be the case.

I explained that FBI policy required dissemination of
information to other government agencies and I felt certain
that this policy was followed in the case of memoranda
prepared as a result of my contacts with Jaffee.

Wallach asked if Jaffee was an informant and
I told him that Jaffee might more properly be called a
Source of Information.

Wallach then wanted to know if I requested Jaffee

to do anything in the course of contacts with him. Wallach
was told that Jaffee may have been asked to follow up on
information which he furnished or make contact with a specific
individual but that this did not occur very often, if at all,
since Jaffee was a free spirit, who usually did as he pleased.
I then explained that during my contacts with Jaffee I received
frequent calls from other FBI Agents who said that Jaffee was
using my name in order to cross police lines or get information
while covering a story of major importance,such as airplane
hijacking. This in spite of repeated requests on my part

that he cease doing this.

Wallach asked if I knew whether Jaffee had ever
been followed by FBI Agents. I pointed out that Jaffee had
been followed by FBI Agents and, in fact, talked to Agents
who were following him, as well as Agents going about their
business. He often mentioned my name to these Agents.

Wallach asked if I was aware that Jaffee did a
telewision program on the FBI. I said that I was aware of
this and in fact, at his request, arranged to have him visit
Camp Smith with a camera crew to cover our firearms training
program.

Wallach was told that I could not remember when
I last saw Jaffee, but that I last talked to him when he
returned from Hong Kong. At this time Jaffee called my home
from Washington, D. C. and told my daughter that he had to
talk to me immediately about an urgent problem. When I

Palit - @ ®

returned Jaffee's call I listened to him for about five
to ten minutes repeatedly telling me how the FBI or CIA
or some individual had furnished information to ABC-TV
which cost him his job. Jaffee would not listen to me
as I tried to explain that he had to be mistaken. I then
got sick of listening to him and hung up on him.

Wallach was told that this was typical of Jaffee
who often thought that there was something personal involved
when he failed to get an assignment or a news item, which he
covered,was not shown on the evening news program, Wallach
was told that Jaffee was an intelligent and personable guy
with a burning ambition, who wanted to become a Walter
Cronkite or a Marvin Kalb overnight. Wallach was told that
I did not believe that Jaffee completed college and he was
probably not otherwise qualified for some of these positions,
which he would like to have had immediately. I then told
Wallach that in my opinion Jaffee had the same problem at
ABC that he had at CBS and at both places he was probably*
overly aggressive and not amenable to direction.

Wallach was also told that Willis and I found
Jaffee to be an interesting guy who we enjoyed talking to
but that he positively would not accept advice or direction.

Wallach wanted to know if I was acquainted with
Special Agents Reeves, Winton or Graves and I gave a negative
reply. It should be noted that Wallach had a first name for.
each of these individuals but I do not recall these names.
He then wanted to know if I knew Bgrt Turner. I did know
Bert Turner as a Supervisor in WFO d possibly at the Bureau.

Wallach wanted to know if I would be surprised
to learn that Jaffee had been interviewed by Bureau Agents
for four days upon his return from Hong Kong. I said that
I would be surprised.

He also wanted to know if I would be surprised
to learn that the FBI or CIA had furnished information to
ABC-TV which cost Jaffee his job. I said that I would be
most surprised and that I did not believe there was any
possibility that this could happen. I told Wallach that
in my opinion Jaffee was perfectly capable of losing his
job on his own.

| NW 65360 Docld:32989653 Page 169



Wallach then asked if I had ever talked to any
other newspaper people. I told him that I once talked to
Irving R. Levine many years ago. He wanted to know if I
knew of any other Agents of the FBI who were talking to
people in the news media. I said that I did not.

Wallach then made reference to newspaper articles
of recent date concerning the FBI's relationship with
newspaper people friendly to the FBI, In response to inquiry
I told him that I knew absolutely nothing about this.

At the outset of the interview Wallach asked if
I told the FBI about his visit and I said that I had called
the Atlanta FBI Office and that as soon as he left I would
again call the Atlanta FBI Office and give an Agent a rundown
on the interview. He said that the FBI had notified the
Select Committee about my call.

He wanted to know if I had called the FBI in
Washington and I gave a negative reply. He also wanted to
know if I had talked to John Willis. TI had not.

Before leaving Wallach commented that he did not
know who cost Jaffee his job, but that he, Wallach, was certain
someone caused Jaffee to lose his job.

I believe I have covered the interview in its
entirety, however, I did not make any notes and the possi-
bility of some minor omission does exist.

Fromt The Attorney General =,

paar DEPORDEATION CONTAAD ies pie

The recent decision of the Supreme Court entitled Irvine vs
California, 347 U.S. 128, denouncing the use of microphone surveil-
lances by city police in a gambling case makes appropriate a reappraisal,
of the use which may be made in the future by the Federal Bureau of
Investigation of microphone surveillance in connection with matters
relating to the internal security of the country. :

It is clear that in some instances the use of -microphone 3]
surveillance is the only possible way of uncovering the activities oe
of espionage agents, possible saboteurs, and subversive persons. In ..
such instances I am of the opinion that the national interest requires ©
that microphone surveillance be utilized by the Federal Bureau of |
Investigation. This use need not be limited to the development of
evidence for prosecution. The FBI has an intelligence function in
connection with internal security matters equally as important as
the duty of developing evidence for presentation to the courts and |
‘the national security requires that the FBI be able to use microphone
surveillance for the proper discharge of both of such functions.

The Department of Justice approves the use of microphone surveilianae
by the FBI under these cireumstances and for these purposes.

Ido not consider that the decision of the Supreme clo

a

Court, ihowever, indicates certain uses of microphones which it would —_|
be well to avoid, if possible, even in internal security investiga~
tions. It is quite clear that in the Irvine case the Justices of the

installing a microphone in a bedroom, They denounced the utilization
of such methods of investigation in a gambling case as shocking. The
Court's action is a clear indication of the need for discretion and
intelligent restraint in the use of microphones by the FBI in ali
eases, including internal security matters. Obviously, the installa-
tion of a microphone in a bedroom or in some comparably intimate
location should be avoided wherever possible. It may appear, however,
that important intelligence or evidence relating to matters connected .
with the national security can only, be obtained by the installation of
a microphone in such a location, It 4s my opinion that under such
eircumstances the installation is proper and is not prohibited by the
Supreme Court's decision in the Ipvin case. : : O77

’



Previous interpretations which have been furnished to you
as to what may constitute trespass in the installation of microphones, |
suggest that the views expressed have been tentative in nature and j
have attempted to predict the course which courts would follow
rather than reflect the present state of the law. It 1s reali- +d
that not infrequently the question of trespass arises in connection

,-with the installation of a microphone. The question of whether a
trespass is actually involved and the second question of the effect
of such a trespass upon the admissibility in court of the evidence thus
obtained, must necessarily be resolved according to the eclroumstances
of each case, The Department in resolving the problems which may arise
in connection with the use of microphone surveillance will review the
ciroumstances in each case in the light of the practical necessities
of investigation and of the national interest which must be protecteds
It is my opinion that the Department should adopt that interpretation
which will permit microphone coverage by the FBI in a manner most
conducive to our national interest. I recognize that for the FBI.

* to £uLf£ill its important Intelligence function, considerations of
internal security and the national safety are paramount and, there
fore, aol compel. the unrestricted use of this technique in tne national -

’ . MEMORANDUM FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL t

With reference to the proper controls over wiretapping and
the Installation of microphones, you will recall that I advised you
that back under the administration of Attorney General Clark I
recommended that all Government agencies refrain from wiretapping
unless there was specific approval in each instance by the Attorney
General who is the chief law officer of the Government. I repeated.
the same recommendation to each successive Attorney: General following -',
the administration of Attorney General Clark. : a

7 'Z have always felt that there was a very lax control'in the
handling of wiretapping by Government agencles. I am the only head
of a Government investigative Agency who does not have the authority
> to authorize a wiretap, but under the system which I personally set
. up. Therefore, requests for wiretaps are sent by me to the Attorney: | |
General for his approval or disapproval. I know thet no such system. ° |
is followed in other branches of the Government and, in fact, in many |
instances subordinates quite far down the line of authority tap telo~ -
phones without the specifle approval of the head of the agency and
certainly without specific approval of the cabinet officer in charge
of the department. vs pein : Pemeees

I still feel gette strongly that no Government agency should: |
tap @ telephone unless i¢ 4s specifically approved in each instance by ,_|
the Attorney General. This would certainly elreumseribe promiscuous © if
wiretapping on the part of Government agencies and would centralize ©’ |
in one place, the Attorney General's office, a record of any phone taps |

which have been placed by a Government agency. :

: - As you are aware, in the ease of the FBI we do not request "|

-- phone taps except in cases Involving kidnaping and esplonage. 13
has been predicated upon my theory that when the life of an individual
or the Life of the Nation 1s in peril a phone tap’is justified for:
intelligence purposes as any information obtained over a phone tap
eannot be used in tho trial of a criminal ease. Mics

MEMORANDUM FOR THE FILE | if
RE: / Senate Select Committee | \ bs
/ _ syed

On the afternoon of August 19, 1975, (: El11if of the
. SSC staff, telephoned me to report that the Committee has
decided to defer on its pending request for the identity of
various so-called "recipient-source" witnesses in the COINTEL
program.

me Raw oy
Director Sec’y|_

Mr. Ellif also emphasized that he wished to apologize
to the Attorney General for possibly misstating the grounds
as to why the Committee and the staff had decided to reject
the proposals apparently agreed upon by Senator Church and
the Attorney General.

Finally, I noted to John E1lif that I continue to have
difficulty in understanding why the staff insists that they
need further witnesses to establish any possible "damage" to
the targets of the COINTEL program. Ellif-finally agreed
that since they do know the names and identities of the targets, {i : .)
the latter probably would be the best witnesses on this issue fe
in any event. Nonetheless, Ellif did stress that it.is possible wy
that later on in the fall, the Committee and its staff may choose *
to come back and press its demands for the right to interview “
the recipient-source witnesses.

On 9/10/75, SA Daniel A. F1 of the New York
Office (NYO) was interviewed by a Sar Member of the U. S.
Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities (SSC) in
its offices in Washington, D. C., on the subject of mail
‘openings. The interview was recorded by an SSC stenographer.

On the morning of 9/26/75, SAC Robert Denz, NYO,
telephonically contacted Supefvisor S. F. Phillips of the
Senstudy 75 Project and advised that Flynn had been contacted U
by James Dick, the SSC Staff Member who had interviewed him, ty

G4 Dick infermed’ Flynn that the transcript of the interview
8 available for review by Flynn but that the review must
\ be done in SSC offices, pursuant to SSC rules. The Partren
Se for Flynn's review is 9/30/75. “Also according to SSC rules,”
et Flynn's review will not permit any substantive changes but

Denz that, befote coming to Washington, D, C., Flynn ought
to review any notes hehas, as well as the LHM which Flynn
prepared and submitted to the Bureau after the interview.
If Flynn finds that in his opinion the transcript is inaccurate

On 9/11/75, Special Counsel for Intelligence }
Coordination Michael E. Shaheen, Jr., was advised that Ay
Senator Howard Baker had reviewed the information con-
tained in Bureau files pertaining to. him per instructions
of the Attorney General and in response to the letter from
Senator Frank Church, Chairman of the Senate Select Committee,
dated May 27, 1975. Baker requested that one particular file
be made available for review by his designee on the Senate
Select Committee, James Madigan. This file is titled ALLEGED
TAPPING OF TELEPHONE OF UNITED STATES SENATOR HOWARD BAKER,
WASHINGTON, D. C. (Bufile 139-4744). Shaheen was asked what
the Department position was. concerning this particular requesi
inasmuch as. the file had been made available to the Senator
pursuant to the instructions of the Attorney General.

Shaheen advised that inasmuch‘as the initial request
was from the Chairman of the Senate Select Committee for access
to files for Senators that any modification of that request
_giving access. to Senate Select Committee Staff Members should
also be pursuant to a communication from the Chairman of that
Committee. Shaheen indicated that making the file available P

By a prior oral arrangement between Mr. Mark ha

Gitenstein, Ystart Member, Senate Select Committee (SSC), ara
Me. W. B. Wannall, Assistant Director, Intelligence Division (
a briefing was scheduled for 2:00 p.m. on 8/28/75. This
briefing was to consist of a discussion of the various indices
maintained, and.operated-by the FBI. “Information pertaining
to these indices had previously been submitted the SSC by
letterhead memorandum dated July 17, 1975, and documents
pertaining to the indices were made available for review by
appropriately cleared SSC Staff Members at FBI Headquarters.

This briefing was held in the conference room of
the INTD, JEH Building, on 8/28/75 during the approximate
period 2:00 p.m. to 4:30 p.m, Present at this meeting were
Assistant Director W. R. Wannall, Settion Chief J. G. Deegan.
Unit Chief E, P, Grigalus, SA K. A. Mendenhall, all of the
INTD, Mark Gitenstein, Michael Epstein, and Martha Talley,
Staff Members of the SSC.

Main items of discussion during this briefing oe

centered around the Rabble Rouser_
the Agitator Index (AT), the Key &
Secur x (SI), and the Admin

x (RRI), later known as
; gram (KAP), the
mdex (ADEX). The
ned indices and

the KAP were discussed and Mr. Wannall offered background
information and historical reasoning as to the necessity for
implementing these indices and the KAP. Mr. Deegan answered
questions pertaining to the AI and Messts Grigalus and
Mendenhall answered questions pertaining to the KAP, the “4

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall
Re: Senstudy 75
62-116395

were advised there is no plan of action in the FBI for the
apprehension of the individuals so listed. The SSC Staff
Members were advised individuals currently listed on the
ADEX would merely be afforded priority investigative attention
during any national emergency which should occur; however,
they would not be apprehended. SSC Staff Members also
indicated they felt criteria for inclusion on the ADEX
when first established were the same as the criteria for
inclusion on the old SI. They were advised when the ADEX
Program was initiated the criteria were basically the same;
however, after closely following the matter for a period
of approximately 8 months, the criteria were reevaluated
and revised so only individuals who were considered
currently dangerous were to be included on the ADEX.

SSC Staff Members were also advised that the SI was

stored "off-line" in the Bureau's computers and as such
was utilized in a strictly in-house operation. Informa—
tion was therefore not available to outside agencies or
terminals tied in with the Bureau's computer system.

Staff Members also indicated from a review of material
made available to them it appeared as though there was
friction between the Bureau and the Department during the
late 1940s and early 1950s with respect to establishing
guidelines and policy in connection with the SI and they
desired to know what the cause of this friction was. INTD
representatives present advised they were unaware of the
cause of any such friction.

Other questions similar to those above were asked
by the SSC Staff Members and were answered by INTD personnel
present. In addition the following nine questions were asked
by the SSC Staff Members and Mr. Wannall indimted answers
would be obtained and orally furnished: :

2. Was there a memorandum concerning the
expansion of the AI to include individuals of local
prominence? (Memorandum of G. C. Moore to Mr. W. C.
Sullivan dated 11/22/67 requested approval of an SAC
letter for expanding the AI to include local leaders as
well as national leaders involved in racial disorders.)

3. Were individuals included on both the AI and
the SI and, if so, wasn't this a duplication of effort?
(Individuals were included on both the AI and the SI;
however, this was not necessarily a duplication of effort
inasmuch as the SI was to be utilized in the apprehension
and detention of individuals considered dangerous and the
AI was an administrative aid to follow the activities and
movement of individuals attempting to cause racial
disorders.)

4, When did the SI become automated and was the
Reserve Index (RI) ever automated? (The SI became automated
during the early 1950s and was updated throughout the years
with the advancement of computer technology and purchase
by the Bureau of more advanced computers, Following
discontinuance of the SI the ADEX was continued in the
computer systems in an "off-line" manner. The RI-A~-
was placed on automatic data processing (ADP) equipment
the same as the SI. RI-B was maintained at the field
level only and was never placed in the ADP equipment.)

5. Has the Bureau's copy of the Attorney General's
portfolio concerning the Emergency Detention Program (EDP)
been returned? (One copy of the Attorney General's
portfolio concerning the EDP has been located and is
currently maintained in the Security Informant Unit of
the IS-2 Section, INTD.)

6. Who were the Bureau individuals who
(a) maintained the Attorney General's portfolio during
1968 and (b) involved with the EDP during the 1940s?
(The following individuals were identified through
review of pertinent communications during time pervod
in question: (a) 1968 - C. D. Brennan, P. F. Enlow,
T. P, Rosack; (b) 1946-D. M. Ladd, J. C. Strickland;
1948-Lish Whitson, W. H. Winterrowd, J. W. Yeagley.

7. When did the Department start reviewing and
apptYoving the SI list? (Matters pertaining to the old
Custodial Detention List were first referred to the
Department during March, 1941. Copies of the SI were
submitted to the Department during 1951 and the Department,
on a continuing basis, reviewed matters pertaining to the
SI except for brief periods of time when funds and manpower
were not available until the SI was discontinued in 1971.)

8. Was there a form used by the Department
concerning the continuance or cancellation of individuals
on the SI and, if so, what does the form look like?
(Forms were utilized and copies have been obtained to
exhibit to SSC Staff Members.)

9. Do we have a copy of the form for including
or deleting an individual from the AI? (FD-397 was
utilized with the AI. A copy of this form will be
exhibited to SSC Staff Members.)

At the closure of this briefing SSC Staff Members
expressed their appreciation to the Bureau personnel present
and indicated the briefing had furnished them a better
understanding of the Bureau's utilization of the above
indices and the KAP.

ACTION:

With your approval and in accordance with your
previous instructions the Senstudy Unit will initiate contact
with Mr. Gitenstein so answers relating to the above nine
questions may be orally provided to the above-named SSC
Staff Members.

On 8/22/75, John T. ELLif£, Task Force Director for
the Domestic Intelligence Task Force of the Senate Select Com-
mittee, advised that regarding proposed plans for testimony
by Bureau officials before the Senate Select Committee that
the Committee tentatively scheduled hearings for mid-October.

He cited October 16th as being the approximate date. Ini-

tially, according to E1liff, hearings. concerning the Bureau

were to have been initiated in the first week of October but

the Staff Members did not have the necessary background in-

formation to. conduct the hearings at that time and instead

scheduled hearings. concerning IRS for early October. rE }
€

|

E1liff indicated that the tentative format for
these hearings would be to furnish the Bureau an outline of
or a series of questions pertaining to the area to be covere | ee
in testimony prior to our appearance. He indicated that the
hearings would cover a narrow topic on any given day so that
a Bureau official could be briefed and r nd to questions
raised concerning the particular subject ET

E1Lif£ indicated that typical subjects of hearings
concerning the FBI would be a one-day ERPRG 2 on political

abuse or a series of hearings on COIN, ass
eY7 41a 3 fs" 114

E1Lif£ indicated that it was the Committee's intent
to continue hearings regarding the FBI into mid-December once
they are initiated with the Bureau testifying at least once
a week during that period. He advised they also envisioned
the initial hearing as setting forth what the scope of the
Senate Select Committee inquiry had been into the FBI and of
topics to be covered by hearings. EL1iff felt this would
inform the House Select Committee of what areas tHE Sena eee,
Select Committee had delved into.

On 8/25/75, SA Daly determined from Michael
Epstein of the Senate Select Committee that this
particular interview was not considered an "abuse"
interview and if the Bureau so desired, they could have
a representative present during the interview. Accord-
ingly, Recommendation #2 in this memorandum should be
changed to show that an Agent may, in fact, be present.

It is the Committee's intention té insert in some of the

personnel who assisted the FBI in’certain instances, such

make these identifications based upon our notes from the

‘documents, and will supply you with copies of the documents

in which such descriptions have béen typed in order that
you may check the accuracy of the descriptions. In this
way, we will avoid public identification of the IRS per-

Dear Mr. Daly:

Enclosed is a list of documents which the Senate Select
Gonmi.ctes, on Intelligence Activities may decide to declassiry
Of its public hearings on the Huston Plan. We invite your
opinion on any sections which you think ought to be sanitized
before declassification. Of course, the great majority of
key documents on the Huston Plan are already a matter of public
record,

Since these hearings may be held as early as September 23rd
and certainly by early October, your quick response would be

most helpful. 7

Dear Mike:

¥

The following two documents, which relate to the Martin
Luther King, Jr. matter, are the subject of a pending Committee
“request for documents:

A. Airtel dated 2/12/62 from SAC, New York, to
Director, FBI, subject "Dr. Martin Luther King,
dr., SM-C (00:Atlanta) ;"and

B. Airtel dated 8/15/66 from SAC, New York, to
Director, FBI, subject “Communist Party, USA,
Counterintelligence Program, Internal Security
- C (Stanley David Levison).«"

These two documents had been previously provided to the
Committee in heavily or almost completely excised form.
Virtually the entire contents of Item A. (a 3-page airtel)
were excised because "it could. result in identification of an
FBI informant," and more than 12 pages of Item B. (a 29-page
airtel) were excised because such portions contained information
which “tends to identify highly sensitive sources of continuing
value. A third document which is needed by the Committee, and
which would presumably also be provided by the Bureau only in
excised form is a New York field office letter to the Bureau
dated 6/21/62 as cited in the last paragraph of page 9 of the
10/11/62 memorandum from the SAC, Atlanta, to thé binlegtox,

FBI, subject "Communist Infiltration of the So he ns3Chi
Leadership Conference, IS-C (00: Atlanta) ." EDEWE!

Michael E. Shaheen, Jr. , ,
Page 2 ; September 16, 1975

The Bureau's position with respect to the excised portions
of Items A. and B. above was reiterated by FBI representatives
at our September 9 meeting, notwithstanding our position that
these materials were deemed to be absolutely essential to our
complete understanding of the King investigation. As you are
aware, several other documents previously provided to the
Committee contain conclusionary statements about Stanley Levison
as predicates for many of the actions taken with respect to
King, and it would appear that the withheld portions of
Items A. and B. above, as well as the 6/21/62 New York letter
described above, would contain the detailed bases for such
conclusions.

I am sure you would agree that the underlying facts
concerning Levison are vital in order that we can meet our
responsibilities to fully assess the propriety of the FBI's
activities with respect to this case. Accordingly, I would

_ appreciate your personal attention to this matter, including
your own examination of the three documents in question, and
hopefully, a determination by you that these documents should
be provided to the Committee in unexcised form (except for the
names of so-called “live" informants).

An early resolution of this matter is essential, and I
would hope you can respond by the end of the week.

Sincerely,
TE Lbdly

Senate Select Committee (SSC) convened public
hearings 9-16-75, at which Chairman Frank Church an-
nounced the chief purpose of the inquiry was. to examine
the role of CIA disobeying direct orders of President
Nixon who had ordered the destruction of biological/
bacteriological agents and weapons of war by Presidential
Order, 11-25-69. Chairman Church referred to previous
executive testimony of Director Colby which established
that CIA had maintained a supply of approximately 6 grams
of shellfish toxin, a lethal agent, until June, 1975, in
apparent contravention of the Presidential Order of 1969.
The retention of the toxin had been ordered by a midlevel
employee without the knowledge of former Director Richard
Helms.

While Chairman Church stressed it is not the
purpose of SSC to denigrate the importance of the FBI
and the CIA of their contribution to the welfare of the
United States, he stated subsequent SSC hegyings would
highlight the necessity that Federal law doy ment and
intelligence agencies operate ae mapped whidhy will not y|
infringe upon the rights of American citizens, ~ ’

Church added that SSC will inate the Poss

Memorandum to Mr. Adams from Legal Counsel
Re: SENSTUDY 75

CIA directive to destroy or impinge on his d@cision to
maintain the toxins and, further, the Presidential Order
was directed toward offensive biological weapons of war
in possession of the Department of Defense. Additionally,
Dr. Gordon pointed out that the shellfish toxin over
which he had custody was a chemical substance and could
not be classified as a biological weapon.

Former Director Helms will appear before SSC in
public session, 9-17-75.

Dear Mike:

As Mark and you discussed today.on the phone,
it was the Committee's intent in Fritz Schwarz’ letter to
you of September 4, 1975, that the FBI, as well as the
Internal Security Division, provide information pertaining
to the individuals and organizations listed in that letter.
Of course this letter and the August 29 letter are modified
. by my letter of September 10. Furthermore, ‘this request is
: 7 of the_highest priority and therefore we want to be kept
7 informed of its progress on a daily basis. Perhaps the
: best approach would be to have Bureau representatives con-

D uw°Nltact either Mark Gitenstein or Art Harrigan immediately so
for ues that we might prioritize the names listed in the September

Attached is a letter from Jom ElUff of the SSC staff
which modifies the lanquage of the August 29, letter fra the SSO's
Chief Counsel Schwarz to the Attorney General. The last sentence
of the first paragraph of the August 29, letter read as follows:

“Where an Internal Security Division request was
made with respect to a person or organization on whom
the Internal Security Division or the FBI maintained
or maintains a file, we would appreciate the opportue
nity to review the entire file". (ewhasis mine)

The modification of the first paragraph effected by the attached
letter deletes the words “or the Fal" as underlined above. Such
a modification exempts the raw files of the Eureau from inclusion
in this request. The request still requires response by the
Bureau for "all documents" in its possession as requested of the
entire Department generally by the modified first paragraph, —

David Bushong, who identified himself as a Senate
Select Committee Staff Member, telephonically requested on
9/10/75 that the Bureau determine the listing for telephone
number 714-756-3388 in Rancho, Santa Fe, California, and the
listing for Post Office Box 515 in Rancho, Santa Fe, California.
Bushong indicated that the fact he was attached to the Senate
Select Committee could be verified by inquiry with Staff Director
Bill Miller or Security Officer Ben Marshall of that Committee. 6
Mark Gitenstein of the Senate Select Committee was
\ telephonically contacted by SA Paul V. Daly and advised of the
request received from David Bushong. He was informed that the
Bureau did not have authority to conduct an investigation for
the Senate Select Committee in the absence of instructions from.
| the Attorney General and that the Bureau would not conduct sué
| an investigation in the absence of same. Gitenstein agreed that
! the Bureau should not conduct the investigation and indicated he
would bring this to the attention of Bushong.

Subsequently, ASAC Arthur Barger of the San Diego
Office telephonically advised he had been contacted by David
Bushong and asked to make available to him information he had
requested the Bureau to furnish. Barger was informed that the
Committee had been notified that this was an improper request
and that the Bureau was not going to ce@ftply. He was told to
tell Bushong that Mark Gitenstein of thé<Zgumittee had been 7
apprised of this matter and he should contaét Sitensteing g. Af.

Gitenstein was telephonically recéntacted and advised
that Bushong had contacted the San Diego Office requesting an

was an improper request. Gitenstein explained that he did not

RE: SENSTUDY 75

sual Subsequently, Gitenstein telephonically recontacted
SA Paul V. Daly and advised that the request for investigation
had been done "behind his and Elliff's back" apparently referring
to John Elliff, Task Force Director for the Senate Select Com-
mittee. He indicated that this request had been discussed with
the Deputy Attorney General's Office and was an investigation
being. conducted by Senate Tower and Kurt Smothers, Minority
Counsel. He requested that SA Daly contact Michael E. Shaheen,
Jxv., Special Counsel for Intelligence Coordination in the De-
partment, to verify that arrangements have been made for the
Bureau to conduct this investigation.

SA Daly contacted Shaheen and Shaheen advised that
he knew nothing of this request. Shaheen was informed that
absent specific instructions from the Attorney General the
Bureau would not conduct the requested investigation and
Shaheen agreed that this was the proper position for the
Bureau. Shaheen was informed that the Senate Select Com-
mittee Staff Member conducting the investigation was David
Bushong and Shaheen stated that he knew Bushong and Bushong
had formerly been the Administrative Assistant to former
Attorney General William Saxbe.

Subsequently, John Bayley, Assistant Minority
Counsel for the Senate Select Committee, telephonically con-
tacted SA Daly and apologized for the request that the Bureau
conduct an investigation for the Senate Select Committee and
he indicated that he thought arrangements had been made for
this investigation through the Deputy Attorney General's Office.
Bushong advised that Senator Tower was currently attempting to
locate the Attorney General to straighten out this particular
problem and apparently arrange for the Bureau to conduct such
an investigation.
