SP SECRET

The Attorney General

A brieting for Senators Church and Tower has been provided

covering warrantless electronic surveillances. surreptitious entry for

recovery of cryptographic material, teletype coverage requested by the

National security Agency and electronic penetration of communications

aquipment requested by the National Recurity Ageney. The White House

asked that agencies of the intelligence community not respond to an

requests from the SSC covering these matters until the briefing had been

given. The goal of the briefing was to contine knowledge of these matters

to Senators Church and Tower and avoid proliteration of this information

throughout the SEC staff. In view of this, it is recommended that the

enclosed naterial not ke made available to the SSC staff until it is dis-

cussed with the White House. I further urge that it be made clear to the

White Flouse that if this material is to be made available to the SSC that

access to the enclosed material be limited to Senators Church, Tower,

and SSC Stalf Director William Miller only.

A copy of the memorandum is enclosed for your records.

Diroctor Sec'y -

On September 17, 1975, Mary Wagner, an attorney in the office

of the Deputy Attorney General, accompanied by Bruce Baird, an attorney

recently appointed to the Deputy's office, met with me in my office and

advised that they have been assigned the responsibility of drafting guidelines

for the Attorney General's approval concerning legal representation of

Department employees. She explained that they view the problem of

legal advice to employees as larger than the request made by the FBI

concerning Bureau employees, and that the guidelines would address the

larger problem. She asked for my suggestions concerning the proposed

guidelines.

I told Miss Wagner that in the beginning of the inquiries received

from the Senate and House Select Committees, we had been advised by the

Department that a conflict of interest would prohibit Department attorneys,

include awers in the f, an perring leal repentation indiritual

to the employees of the Fbi in inatters relating lo the Senate and House

inquiries. As a consequence we have been advising our employees of the

procedures involved in Congressional committee interviews and appearances

for testimony; the limitations imposed on the employees in regard to sensitive

areas of testimony which might require special approval; their right to

counsel and of the limitation imposed on us that personal counsel would have

to be privately employed. I told Miss Wagner that my reading of the

Attorney General's memorandum for the Director dated September 12, 1975,

was that the Attorney General intended to make personal legal advice available

to employees requesting it and that we would like for the guidelines io be

written broadly enough for employees to receive effective assistance of legal

coursel.

Memorandum to Mr. Adams

Re: Legal Advice for Present or Former Bureau Employees

I suggested to her that the Attorney General might approve the

appointment of a special counsel within the Department whose responsibilities

would be somewhat similar to those imposed on the Special Counsel for

Intelligence Coordination in that he would be relieved of other Department

responsibilities and his allegiance would be only to discharging the obligations

of personal counsel when requested by an employee. I suggested that such

special designation would permit the Department lawyer so assigned to

avoid the conflict of interest problem and at the same time it would impose

on him the obligations of the attorney-client privilege.

Miss Wagner commented that she understood that in some cases

handled by the Civil Division of the Department, Government attorneys

represent employees in civil suits, but require that the employee waive

the attorney-client privilege to the extent that should the Government employee

become aware of information that should be communicated to another division

of the Department, the attorney would furnish such information to the other

division. If the attorney learned of criminal conduct on the part of the

employee, he would not be prohibited by the attorney -client privilege from

making such conduci known to the Department.

I told Miss Wagner that an essential element of the relationship

between the special counsel for furnishing advice to employees would be

that the attorney-client privilege would apply and it would not be possible

for such a waiver to be required in exchange for providing legal advice.

She agreed.

I suggested to Miss Wagner that the Department special counsel

could be available for consultation concerning such matters as appearances

before Congressional committees and for such preliminary advice as would be

useful to employees called to testify. At the point where the special counsel

determined that the employee required more in-depth legal assistance in order

to protect his legal rights, the special counsel could recommend to the

Deputy Attorney General that the employee should be afforded an opportunity

to have private counsel whose fees would be paid by the Department of

Justice.

Memorandum to Mr. Adams

Re: Legal Advice for Present or Former Bureau Employees

In regard to the question of security clearance for such outside

counsel and the possibility that an employee might seek to employ an

attorney whose background would suggest that he would not be approved

for security clearance, I told Miss Wagner that the provision of private

counsel to an employee would be done in the discretion of the Department

and that a reasonable limitation could well be imposed by the Department

as to those atiorneys in private practice who would be eligible for appoint-

ment to represent individual employees. Such limitation would permit

the Department and the employee to agree upon an attorney who would be

qualified for security clearance.

Miss Wagner inquired as to when the Department's responsibility

for furnishing legal counsel to an employee should terminate. I told her

that an appropriate time would be when the Department advised the

employee that a decision had been made to prosecute the employee. Up

to that point the inquiries would have been directed toward the determination

of the circumstances and that the employer-employee relationship would

justify protecting the legal rights of the employee, but at the point at

which the Government determines and so advises the employee that the

employee would be prosecuted, the Government and the employee would

become adversaries.

We discussed the provision in Federal law for the appointment of

counsel for Federal defendants in cases where the defendant is indigent.

I suggested that they consider the possibility that even in those cases

where an employee is to be prosecuted, the Department consider the

possibility of employing existing law to provide counsel to employees

who may become defendants in criminal cases.

As to the scope of the representation of the employee, I told

Miss Wagner that the initial need is for legal advice in situations where

an employee is called for al interview or testimony by Members,

commitees, subcommittees, or other units of the Congress. However, I

explained that due to the publicity of the Congressional inquiries, others may

well be interested in pursuing independent inquiries concerning the same

matters or other matters and that employees may well request legal

advice when they are called for interview or testimony by the Criminal

Memorandum to Mr. Adams

Re: Legal Advice for Present or Former Bureau Employees

Division of the Department, the Civil Rights Division of the Department,

or other Federal Government entities including Federal Grand Juries.

Further, state and local prosecutors and grand juries may seek to inquire

concerning matters within their jurisdiction arising out of the employee's

Federal activities and the employee would require the assistance of counsel.

Therefore, I asked Miss Wagner to include in the guidelines a provision

that legal counsel would be available through the Department for employees

in all circumstances where the employee is being questioned concerning

matters arising out of his employment in the FBI.

I told Miss Wagner that the concluding paragraph in the Attorney

General's memorandum for the Director indicated the possibility that a

determination would be made in some cases that the employee's activities

were beyond the scope of his duties and in such cases legal counsel would

not be provided. I told her that such a determination would be critcal

and the policy followed in making such decisions would color the entire

program of providing legal assistance to employees. Therefore, I

requested Miss Wagner to address the question of scope of duties in the

guidelines by expressing a presumption that the employee's activities

were within the scope of his duties and that such presumption would be

overcome only by a showing of facts clearly indicating to the contrary,

and that such determination would be made at least by the Deputy Attorney

General himself.

I told Miss Wagner that this matter was most urgent and that the

Special Agents of the FBI throughout the field are anxiously awaiting the

announcement of the Attorney General's policy in regard to availability

of legal advice to employees concerning matters arising out of their

employment. She advised me that wo. is would begin immediately and that

she would be in touch with me concerning its progress, and to discuss

the guidelines as they are developed.

U. S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON

INTELIIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC) ;

INTERVIEW OF FORMER ASSISTANT DIRECTOR JOSEPH K. PONDER

BY SSC STAFF MEMBER

On August 28, 1975, I received a call from Mike

Epstein of the Staff of the Senate Select Committee. He

said he planned to be in Southern California on Labor Day •

weekend and asked whether I would be available for

interview on Sunday, August 31, 1975. I told him I would.

Epstein subsequently called me on August 30 and agreed

to meet me at my

home at San Clemente on Sunday afternoon,

August 31, 1975.

The interview with Epstein took place between

3:40 pm and 4:05 pm.

This included

the time spent in

amenities and general conversation.

Regarding my Bureau background Epstein asked

during what period of time I was Special Agent in Charge

in Atlanta.

I told him from April or May 1964 to

December 1966. He asked where I had been assigned before

that (Buffalo) and where I went after leaving Atlanta

(New York). He asked no other questions about my Bureau

career.

He asked if I were aware of telephone taps

maintained by the Atlanta Office on Martin Luther King.

I replied that I was aware. of certain taps placed and

removed during my tenure in Atlanta.

He asked if there

were such coverage before I arrived in Atlanta and I told

him I was not aware of any. In response to these and

other

subsequent questions I pointed out to Epstein that

I had

not been personally involved in the King matter,

that I had various other responsibilities in Atlanta and

that after ten years I cannot now clearly recall information

which might answer his questions.. I told him that every

thing that was done was properly recorded, that the

records were accurate, and wherever my recollection differs

from the record, he should rely on the recora to determine

what happened.

This document contains neither recommendations nor conclusions

of the FBI.

It is the property of the FBI and is loaned to

your agency; it and its contents are not to be distributed

He asked whether the request for the King

coverage originated at the Bureau or in Atlanta. I told

him I did not recall, but that in any case it was

approved by the Bureau.

He asked where it was monitored

and I told him the monitoring was done in an apartment

rented for that purpose.

He asked if I knew the name in

which the apartment was rented and I said I did not. He

asked why the taps were discontinued and I told him I

do not now recall whether I was told why they were

discontinued, but if I were

I cannot now recall the

He asked whether we

had a bug on King

as opposed

to a tap and I told him, "no."

He asked whether it were

possible there were taps and 'bugs placed and maintained

without my knowledge.

I told him that was not possible

because of the size of the office and the relationship

I had with the supervisors and Agents that nothing was

done without my knowledge or without Bureau approval.

Epstein asked whether we had conducted any

Counterintelligence Program against King or the Southern

Christian Leadership Conference and I told him I recalled

none.

He asked whether we had made efforts to prevent

King from receiving the Nobel Prize or efforts to interfere

with or make more difficult the raising of funds for a

banquet to honor King for his receipt of the Nobel Prize.

I told him I knew of no such efforts.

He asked whether Sullivan (Assistant Director

William C. Sullivan) had visited Atlanta. I told him

Sullivan had been to Atlanta in connection with a regional

conference dealing with the Bureau's investigation of the

Klan. He wanted to know if Baumgartner had been with Sullivan

and I told him I thought so.

He asked who else had

accompanied Sullivan and I told him Arbor Gray had

accompanied

Sullivan and perhaps someone else whose name

I cannot now recall. He asked whether Sullivan had met

with Ralph Magill (then publisher of the Atlanta

Constitution). I told him Sullivan may have met with Magill, •

that I may have accompanied Sullivan to Magill's office,

but I cannot specifically recall such a meeting and if it

He asked

the purpose of such a meeting and I told him if such a

meeting took place it was in the nature of a

social

call

with Sullivan paying his respects to Magill and

public: relations-type of meeting. He asked whether there

was any discussion between Sullivan and Magill regarding

any anti-King activities and I told him, "no." He asked

whether Sullivan had made any other visits to Atlanta

and I told him I knew of none.

He asked whether I was aware of any inquiry

made by the Bureau into the handling of the King

investigation either through the Inspection Staff or

otherwise.

I told him I was not aware of any. He asked

whether Nichols, the Agent assigned to the King

investigation had been in Atlanta while I was there. I

told him I had hazy recall of Nichols, but did not

recall him.

He asked the same thing about Al Sentinella.

I told him

Sentinella

was there when I arrived and

was

still there when I left Atlanta. He asked who had

supervised the Security Squad. I told him Supervisor

Charles Harding.

the Committee is to have a suitably paraphrased substitute for

RE:

INTERVIEW OF FBI SPECIAL AGENT (SA)

THED J. CASSIDY BY SSC STAFF MEMBER

On August 20, 1975, Ir. Loch Johnson of the Senate

Select Conmittee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect

to Intelligence Activities (SSC) staff interviewed me in my

office,

Roon 4821, JEH Building, concerning my knowledge of,

and participation in, the so-called "Huston Plan."

Mr. Johnson did not place me under oath or advise me

of my rights.

He asked about my background which I provided, including

the fact that I have been a Special Agent of the FBI since

August 7, 1050.

With regard to the extent of my participation in the

Huston Pian, I advised Ix. Johnson that I vas selected by former

Assistant Director Villian C. Sullivan to act as the liaison

officer for the plan, probably because of my experience in the

FBI Domestic Liaison

Section and my extensive liaison contacts

through my participation in the varlous United States Intelligence

Board (USIB) Committees.

My duties with regard to the Huston Plan

were to insure that appropriate notification of meetings vas mde

and that the various papers prepared as the rosult of meetings

held were delivered to the proper indivicuals in the other agencies

participating in the plan.

Some of the papers were delivered

personally by me, others were sent by courier.

I advised Mr. Johnson that I was generally aware of

the contents of the papers prepared through my attendance at the

meetings of the working group and discussions with participating

personnel; hovever, I porsonally made no input nor did I participate

in the preparation of the workpapers or the finished product.

RE: INTERVIEW OF FBI SPECIAL AGENT (SA)

FRED J. CASSIDY BY SSC STAFF NEMBER

lik. Johnson asked if I had not Tom Charles Huston

prior to the initial moting of the Huston Plan vorking group.

I advised hin that I had never heard of lluston prior to the

mentioning of his name by W. C. Sullivan at the initial necting

of FBI personnel involved in the Huston Plan, which meeting

occurred early in June, 1970, and had never seen him until the

first meeting of the working group held at CIA Headquarters,

Langloy, Virginia, shortly thereaiter.

Mr Johnson asked about the initial mecting o1 FBI

personnel concerning the Huston Plan. I told him it was held

in Mr. Sullivan's conference room in the Fedcral Triangle

Building and that as best as I could recall it was attended by

Ar. Sullivan and the branch Inspectors of the Intelligenco

Division as well as the Section Chiefs. Sullivan told us of

the plan and as I recall indicated this was a golden opportunity

to regain the coverage afforded by techniques, which had been

denied us for the most part, since 1967.

I told hin that in my

view Sullivan tas going to make this one last effort to regain

the coverage and if this effort failed was prepared to retiro.

Mix. Johnson asked il former Inspector T. J. Smith was

at this meeting. I told him I could not recall.

discussed and I advised hin that, as I recalled, at that mecting

it vas decided that cach participating agency would submit a

paper listing the restraints on their particular agency which

were hampering them in doing their job. I pointed out that the

FBI subritted an extensive list of restraints and that this paper

was circulated to the other participating agencies without being

cleared through ir. Hoover.

RE: INTERVIEW OF FBI SPICIAL AGENT (SA)

FRED J. CASSIDY BY SSC STAFT MEMBER

Ir, Johnson asked if I vas avare of who was the

instigator of the Huston Plan, I told hin I had no direct

knowledge but would suspect it vas W. C. Sullivan, Huston, or

possibly formor Assistant Attorney General Robort Mardian;

however, the ansver to his question yould have to be obtained

from those individuals or such records as he nay be able to

Locate.

He asked my impression of Ton Charles Hustor. I told

hin I felt luston vas a very bright young ran who saw this plan

opportunity to becone the Henry Kissinger of donestic

security and thereby enhance hinsell and his political career.

Mr. Johnson stated that his investigation had developed

that Sullivan at the outset of the plan appeared to want to push

through the plan; however, ho scened to take a direct turnabout

and began to adviso Hir. Hoover against adopting some of the

proposals being made by the various participating agencies.

Fle

said it was his inprossion that this turnabout occurred at the

time Sullivan was promoted to Number Three Man In the Burcau.

He asked if I could shed any light on this turn of events.

I told Mr. Johnson that I could not speak for Sullivan

and could only give him my impression of what occurred, that being

at the outsct of tho plan Sullivan truly folt this vas

a golden

opportunity to get the coverage back,

and decided to lay his job

on the line to accomplish this.

When he was moved up to the

Number Three job, I felt he saw the opportunity to someday become

the Director of the FBI.

Furthcr, as the drafts of the plan were

being written, sullivan realiaed that sooner or later Mr.

HOOV CI

would see then and at that time realize that Sullivan had

dissen

inated to the intelligence commnity all of the restraints

Mx. Hoover had imposed on the FBI.

100-438794

•U. S. Government are involved. The Atlanta Office has

recommended that Senator Richard Russell (D. Georgia) be

advised concerning this matter.

This appeas inadvisable

since such action could conceivably cause repercussions which

would only aggravate the racial sicuation that exists in the

South.

It is felt that Dr. Leland J, Haworth, Director,

NsE, should be, furnished information regarding communist

influences exerted on the scle and king=

In this regard

we recently disseminated to the White House and

heads of the intelligence community copies of a "Iop Secret"

summary entitled

"Communism and the legro

Movenent...f

Current Analysis" which contains infomation regarding the

SCIC and king.

This summary deals with King's conmunist

connections and his personal immozal

activities.

With the

receipt of this summary by Dr.

haworth, the scie would.

undoubtedly de remoyed trem the isr progran to obtain qualitied

Negro students for southern schools.

The information concerning the SCIC participation

in the NSF prograin is being sepazately disseminated to the

Department and interested intelligence agencies

Mr. Tolson has suggested, and the Director agreed,

that the monograph on Martin Luther King, Jr., be brought

up to date.

This is an excellent

susgestion and we have alrency

started the necessary research. Bringing this monograph up to

date and disseminating it at high level prior to King's 'Wash-

ington Spring Project" should serve again to remind top-level

officials in Government of the wholly disreputable character

of King.

As you know, King's "Washington Spring Project" was

originally scheduled for early April, 1968. However, our

Washington Field Office has developed information that King's

group is experiencing difficulty in recruiting individuals

to participate in the demonstration and the date for the project

has now tentatively been set for April 27, 1968.

Because of the importance of doing a thorough job on

this, we will conduct an exhaustive file review to bring together

the most complete and up-to-date information and to present it

in a hard-hitting manner.

To make the brief timely, we will

have it completed and ready for dissemination by March 14, 1968.

Issue raised by the SSC here is that they have

detected in their investigation of the Internal Revenue

Service and through review of Cointelpro documents furnished

to them by the fBi Instances relating to FBI use of tax

return information. Included in this material were a

number of cases in which the FBI locally requested and,

according to the documents, received tax returns or tax

return information from Internal Revenue Service employees.

Earlier the SSC had sought to interview individuals who

assisted us in several oi our cointerpro operations. We

successfully resisted these attempts to obtain the identities

of such individuals and our assent to such interview by the

We were sustained in our position by the Attorney

General, Our position was based on the fact that we considered

that we

had an obligation, expressed or implied, of confi-

dentiality toward such sources who had acted on our behalf.

The SSC now raises a question as to whether our

position concerning contacts with and identities of employees

of the Internal Revenue Service is the same as with the

"confidential sources." For the reasons cited in our letter

ve do not believe it would be possible to sustain such an

argument.

Dear Mike:

ALL FBI INFORMIATION CONTAINED

HERE HUNCASSININD

In connection with our investigation of the

Internal Revenue Service, we have received a number of FBI

COINTELPRO documents relating to FBI use of tax return

information. Included in this material are a number of

cases in which the FBI locally requested and, according

to the documents, received tax returns or tax return in-

formation from IRS employees, such as the local Chief off

Audit or Chief

of Intelligence.

We wish to determine whether these requests

were treated by the IRS as official requests and pre-

scribed procedures thus followed for disclosure of the

information, or whether the requests were treated as

informal requests and prescribed procedures ignored.

We

cannot make this determination solely on the basis of the

FBI documents

we have reviewed.

In many cases, the only

way to determine how the requests were treated will be to

interview the IRS employees who handled the requests.

Since these requests were directed to a federal

agency, we are proceeding on the basis of a presumption

that the responses were properly cleared. If so, we do

not believe there is any basis for characterizing. the IRS

employees in question as "confidential sources"

would then be in essentially the same position

They

missioner of Internal Revenue is where the request is

by federal employees who should

have been acting within the scope of their official duties

and who, if they were not so acting, should certainly be

In what is perhaps an excess of caution in view

of the pending discussions regarding the questioning of

"confidential sources"

, we are submitting this situation

for your review lest you should disagree with our analysis

that these individuals cannot properly be so characterized.

Because IRS hearings are scheduled for the last week in

September, our need to question the people who released

the returns is very urgent, and we would appreciate your

advising us of your view on the subject at the earliest.

On 9/9/75, John Elliff, Domestic Task Force Head of

the Senate Select Committee, telephonically contacted SA Paul V.

Daly and requested that SA Douglas MacDougall be released for

purposes of submitting to a Staff interview concerning mail

openings.

Elliff stated that he was currently being interviewed

by Senate Select Committee Staff Members on mail covers; however,

he indicated there is an apparent misunderstanding as the Senate

Select Committee also requested that he be made available for

Staff interview on mail openings at the same time. Elliff was

advised that this was not true and that James Dick of the Senate

Select Committee had requested only a release insofar as mail

covers was concerned for purposes of an interview with MacDougall

and that this particular topic had been confirmed with Dick on a

separate occasion to insure that their intent insofar as MacDougall

was concerned was to interview him on mail covers.

Elliff then

requested that MacDougall be released for mail openings and in-

quired as to how long this particular procedure might take. He

such an interview the Bureau would brief MacDougall concerning

his Fifth Amendment rights and would want MacDougall to have

sufficient time to consider whether he might want to retain

private counsel or whatever other steps he feels necessary to

protect his rights.

Elliff subsequently recontacted SA Paul V. Daly

telephonically and stated he had checked with James

Dick,

Senate Select Committee Staff Member, and determined that

Dick had only asked that MacDougall be made, available for

interview concerning mail covers.

U. S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON

INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC) ;

INTERVIEW OF FORMER ASSISTANT DIRECTOR JOSEPH K. PONDER

BY SSC STAFF MEMBER

On August 28, 1975, I received a call from Mike

Epstein of the Staff of the Senate Select Committee. He

said he planned to be in Southern California on Labor Day

weekend and asked whether I would be available for

interview on Sunday, August 31, 1975. I told him I would.

Epstein subsequently called me on August 30 and agreed

to meet me at my home at San Clemente on Sunday afternoon,

August

31, 1975.

The interview with Epstein took place between

3:40 pm and 4:05 pm.

This included the time spent in

amenities and

general conversation.

Regarding my Bureau background Epstein asked

during what period of time I was Special Agent in Charge

in Atlanta.

I told him from April or May 1964 to

December 1966. He asked where I had been assigned before

that (Buffalo) and where I went after leaving Atlanta

(New York). He asked no other questions about my Bureau

career.

He asked if I were aware of telephone taps

maintained by the Atlanta Office on Martin Luther King.

I replied that I was aware of certain taps placed and

removed during my tenure in Atlanta. He asked if there

were such coverage before I arrived in Atlanta and I told

him I was not aware of any. In response to these and

other subsequent questions I pointed out to Epstein that

I had not been personally involved in the King matter,

that I had various other responsibilities in Atlanta and

that after ten years I cannot now clearly recall information

which might answer his questions. I told him that every-

thing that was done was properly recorded, that the

records were accurate, and wherever my recollection differs

from the record, he should rely on the record to determine

what happened.

INTERVIEW OF FORMER ASSISTANT DIRECTOR JOSEPH K. PONDER

BY SSC STAFF MEMBER

He asked whether the request for the King

coverage originated at the Bureau or in Atlanta.

I told

him I did not recall, but that in any case it was

approved by the Bureau.

He asked where it was monitored

and I told him the monitoring was done in an apartment

rented for that purpose.

He asked if I knew the name in

which the apartment was

rented and I said I did not.

He

asked why the taps were discontinued and I told him I

do not now recall whether I was told why they were

discontinued, but if I were I cannot now recall the

reason.

He asked whether we

had a bug on King as opposed

to a tap and I told him, "no."

He asked whether it were

possible there were taps and bugs placed and maintained

without my knowledge.

I told him that was not possible

because of the size of the office and the relationship

I had with the supervisors and Agents that nothing was

done without my knowledge or without Bureau approval.

Epstein asked whether we had conducted any

Counterintelligence Program against King or the Southern

Christian Leadership Conference and I told him I recalled

none.

He asked whether we had made efforts to prevent

King from receiving the Nobel Prize or efforts to interfere

with or make more difficult the raising of funds for a

banquet to honor King for his receipt of the Nobel Prize.

I told him I knew of no such efforts.

He asked whether Sullivan (Assistant Director

William C. Sullivan) had visited Atlanta. I told him

Sullivan had been to Atlanta in connection with a regional

conference dealing with the Bureau's investigation of the

Klan. He wanted to know if Baumgartner had been with Sullivan

I told him I thought so. He asked who else had

accompanied Sullivan and

I told him Arbor Gray had

accompanied Sullivan and perhaps someone else whose name

I cannot now recall. He asked whether Sullivan had met

with Ralph Magill (then publisher of the Atlanta

Constitution).

I told him Sullivan may have met with Magill,

that I may have accompanied Sullivan to Magill's office,

but I cannot specifically recall such a meeting and it It

the purpose of such a meeting and I told him if such a

meeting took place it was in the nature of a social

call with Sullivan paying his respects to Magill and a

was any discussion between Sullivan and Magill regarding

any anti-King activities and I told him, "no." He asked

whether Sullivan had made any other visits to Atlanta

and I told him I knew of none.

He asked whether I was aware of any inquiry

made by the Bureau into the handling of the King

investigation either through the Inspection Staff or

otherwise.

He asked

whether Nichols, the Agent assigned to the King

investigation had been in Atlanta while I was there. I

told him I had hazy recall of Nichols, but did not

recall him.

He asked the same thing about Al Sentinella.

I told him Sentinella was there when I arrived and was

still there when I left Atlanta. He asked who had

supervised the Security Squad. I told him supervisor

Dear Mr. Kelley:

ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED

TEREINISUNCLASSIFIEI

DATE LO/18162 BYSPLALA CLA

In accordance with instructions received from

the Bureau, I am enclosing a bill in the amount of $750.00

from the law firm of kantor, Shaw & Davidoff. Mr. Herbert .

Kantor is an attorney who acted as my counsel during an

appearance by me before the senate Select Committee on

Intelligence Operations in Washington, Do, on August12,

1975.

After notification by the Committee and the Bureau

that my appearance had been requested, I was advised by the

Legal Department of the Bureau that I had the right to have

an attorney accompany me during my appearance.

I was also

advised by the Bureau that neither they nor the Department

of Justice could provide me with counsel due to a possible

conflict oi interest on their part.

TWIT

RETAINED IN

RECORDS

CODY

PERSONNEL

The matters to be discussed before the Committee

involved only my prior official duties in the counter-

intelligence field.

that to best protect both my constitutional privileges and

the Bureau's overriding interest, the most prudent course

of action would indicate the retention of an attorney. I

would like to advise you that much thought was paid to the

selection of an attorney since confidential Bureau activities

would have to be discussed with him and it was felt that the

person selected would,

in effect., be representing the bureau

in addition to

myself.

REC-20

specific legal fees incurred,

as itemized in

the enclosed bill, are only in connection with the preparation.

for and attendance at my appearance before the Committee..

September 3, 1975

Atlanta, Georgia

On September 2, 1975, Mr. Paul G. Wallach, Counsel

to the Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with

Respect to Intelligence Adtivities of the United States Senate

arrived at my office located at 6165 Barfield Road, Atlanta,

Georgia 30302, at approximately 10:10 a.m.

His interview with

This interview was not conducted

drove Mr. Wallach to Perimeter Mall where he caught the 11:00 a.m.

bus to the Airport.

During the interview Mr. Wallach asked how long

I had served in

the Federal Bureau of Investigation and what

areas I worked in during my FBI career.

He was told that my

FBI career started on March 19, 1951, and ended with my

retirement on January 27, 1973. During this time I was

assigned to criminal work for two years, worked in the Soviet

Intelligence field for approximately 17 years, and again handled

criminal work for the last three years of my

Bureau career.

Wallach wanted to know if I worked with James Kehoe.

I told him that for the most part Kehoe and I were on different

squads, although we both worked in the Soviet Intelligence

field.

We did work on the same squad during the first years

of our assignment to this type of work.

Wallach wanted to know if I was aware of the operation

involving the mail at Kennedy Airport and at other post offices

in the New York area.

I told him that officially I was not aware

of these operations but that in fact I knew of the operations.

Wallach wanted to know if I had

ever been assigned to work in

a post office and my answer was "no".

Wallach then wanted to know if I was acquainted

with Sam Jaffee.

After my affirmative answer he wanted to

know how I met him, why I interviewed him, whether I had to

Jaffee was an informant.

He also wanted to know

when I first met Jaffee, how frequently I saw him, over what

period of time I was seeing him, and when I last

saw him.

NW 65360 Docld:32989653 Page 166

## Page 167

I told Wallach that I could not remember dates

and other details of my relationship with Jaffee,but that

information responsive to his questions could be found

recorded in FBI files as I had prepared detailed memos

reflecting all of my contacts with Jaffee.

I told Wallach

that if he were entitled to the information he was seeking,

I'd suggest that he get hold of the file on Jaffee.

Wallach

that before going through

said he understood my postie they" Lived to talk to a few

the process of getting

individuals to see if information the Committee had was

worth pursuing.

Wallach acknowledged that it would not be possible

for me to furnish specific information, such as dates, after

the passage of such a long period of time.

Thereafter, in

response to inquiry, he was told that Jaffee was in contact

with many diplomatic officials, including Soviets, in his

• capacity as a CBS newsman.

I could not

specifically remember

how this information came to the Bureau's attention. I did

have some background information on Jaffee and it was necessary

for me to get permission before I could interview him.

was told that I did not know specifically who authorized the

interview.

Wallach wanted to know what approach was used

during the initial interview with Jaffee.

He was told that

I could not specifically recall his information, but that

John Willis anâ I conducted the interview.

Both of us were

keenly aware of the FBI's policy of not interfering with the

Freedom of the Press and we wanted to make sure that Jaffee

understood this.

We also wanted to make sure that Jaffee

understood that we did not want to place him in a difficult

or embarrassing position by talking to him and that if he

found our presence to be a problem we would leave immediately.

He was told that Jaffee proved to be most cooperative and that

thereafter we were in contact with Jaffee frequently. Wallach

wanted to know how often and he was told that sometimes we

were in contact with him two or three times a week, once

every two weeks, or perhaps once a month. He was told that

all contacts were recorded in writing in the file, along with

the

results of the contact.

Concerning information which Jaffee furnished,

Wallach was told that Jaffee furnished information concerning

current events of major and minor importance on the inter-

national scene, which came to his attention as a result of

-2 .

NW 65360 Docld:32989653 Page 167

---

## Page 168

his contacts with numerous individuals in diplomatic

circles.

He was again told that all of this information

was reduced to writing and I understood that it was

disseminated to other government agencies, including

the U. S. Mission to the UN and the State Department.

Wallach wanted to know how I knew this to be the case.

I explained that FBI policy required dissemination of

information to other

government agencies and I felt certain

that this policy was

followed in the case of memoranda

prepared as a result of my contacts with Jaffee.

Wallach asked if Jaffee was an informant and

I told him that Jaffee might more properly be called a

Source of Information.

Wallach then wanted to know if I requested Jaffee

to do anything in the course of contacts with him.

Wallach

was told that Jaffee may have been asked to follow up on

information which he furnished or make contact with a specific

individual but that this did not occur very often, if at all,

since Jaffee was a free spirit, who usually did as he pleased.

I then explained that during my contacts with Jaffee I received

frequent calls from other FBI Agents who said that Jaffee was

using my name in order to cross police lines or get information

while covering

a story of major importance, such as airplane

hijacking.

This in spite of repeated requests on my part

that he cease doing this.

Wallach asked if I knew whether Jaffee had ever

been followed by FBI Agents. I pointed out that Jaffee had

been followed by FBI Agents

and, in fact, talked to Agents

who were following him, as well

as Agents going about their

business. He often mentioned my name to these Agents.

Wallach asked if I was aware that Jaffee did a

television program on the FBI. I said that I was aware of

this and in fact, at his request, arranged to have him visit

Camp Smith with a camera crew to cover our firearms training

program.

Wallach was told that I could not remember when

I last saw Jaffee, but that I last talked to him when he

returned from Hong Kong.

At this time Jaffee called my home

from Washington, D. C. and told my daughter that he had to

talk to me immediately about an urgent problem. When I

- 3 -

NW 65360 Docld:32989653 Page 168

---

## Page 169

returned Jaffee's call I listened to him for about five

to ten minutes

repeatedly telling me how the FBI or CIA

or some individual had furnished information to ABC-TV

which cost him his job.

Jaffee would not listen to me

as I tried to explain that he had to be mistaken. I then

got sick of listening to him and hung up on him.

Wallach was told that this was typical of Jaffee

who often thought that there was something personal involved

when he failed to get an assignment or a news item, which he

covered, was not shown on the evening news program. Wallach

was told that Jaffee was an intelligent and personable guy

with a burning ambition, who wanted to become a Walter

Cronkite or a Marvin Kalb overnight. Wallach was told that

I did not believe that Jaffee completed college and he was

probably not otherwise qualified for some of these positions,

which he would like to have had immediately. I then told

Wallach that in my opinion Jaffee had the same problem at

ABC that he had at CBS and at both places he was probably:

overly aggressive and not amenable to direction.

Wallach was also told that Willis and I found

Jaffee to be an interesting guy who we enjoyed talking to

but that he positively would not accept advice or direction.

Wallach wanted to know if I was acquainted with

Special Agents Reeves, Winton or Graves and I gave a negative

reply.

It should be noted that Wallach had a first name for

each of these individuals but I do not recall these names.

lurner. 1 did knov

Wallach wanted to know if I would be surprised

to learn that Jaffee had been interviewed by Bureau Agents

for four days upon his return from Hong Kong. I said that

I would be surprised.

He also wanted to know if I would be surprised

to learn that the FBI or CIA had furnished information to

ABC-TV which cost Jaffee his job.

I said that I would be

most surprised and that I did not believe there was any

possibility that this could happen. I told Wallach that

in my opinion Jaffee was perfectly capable of losing his

job on his own.

".

Wallach then asked if I had ever talked to any

other newspaper people.

I told him thät I once talked to

Irving R. Levine many years ago.

He wanted to know if I

kaew of any other Agents of the FBI who were talking to

people in the news media. I said that I did not.

Wallach then made reference to newspaper articles

of recent date concerning the FBI's relationship with

newspaper people friendly to the FBI.

In response to inquiry

I told him that I knew absolutely nothing about this.

At the outset of the interview Wallach asked if

I told the FBI about his visit and I said that I had called

the Atlanta FBI Office and that as soon as he left I would

again call the Atlanta FBI Office and give an Agent a rundown

on the interview.

He said that the FBI had notified the

Select Committee about my call.

He wanted to know if I had called the FBI in

Washington and I gave a negative reply. He also wanted to

know if I had talked to John Willis.

I had not.

Before leaving Wallach commented that he did not

know who cost Jaffee his job, but that he, Wallach, was certain

someone caused Jaffee to lose his job.

I believe I have covered the interview in its

entirety, however, I did not make any notes and the possi-

bility of some minor omission does exist.

MICROPHONE SURVEILLANCE

ALL FBI IRTORLIATION CONTANEO

May 20, 1954

155-26

CONTH

The recent decision of the Supreme Court entitled Irvine ve

Callfornla, 347 U.s. 128, denouncing the use of microphone surveil-

Lances by city police in a gambling case makes appropriate a reappraisad

of the use which may be made in the future by the Federal Bureau of

Investigation of microphone surveillance in connection with matters

It 1s clear that in some instances the use of microphone

surveillance is the only possible way of uncovering the activities

of espionage agents, possible saboteurs, and subversive persons. In

such instances 1 am of the opinion that

the national Interest requijes

that microphone surveillance be utilized by the Federal Bureau of

Investigation. This use need not be limited to the development of

evidence for

prosecution. The FBI has an Intelligence function In

connection with internal security matters equally as important as

the duty of developing evidence for presentation to the courts and

the national security requires that the FBI be able to use microphone

surveillance for the proper discharge of both of such functlons.

The department of Justice approves the use of microphone surveillance

by the FBI under these cireumstances and for these purposes.

do not consider that the decision of the supreme Court

In Irvine-v. Callfornia, supra, requires a different course. That

case 1s readily distinguishable on Its facts. The language of the

Indicates certain uses of microphones which it would

one a gate coat that in tro to a eat ta than ne

Supreme Court were outraged by what they regarded as the Indecency of

Installing a microphone In a bedroom. They denounced the utilization

of such methods of investigation In a gambling case as shocking.

Court's action 1s a clear indication of the need for discretion and

intelligent restraint in the use of microphones by the FBI In all

Cases,

including internal security matters. Obviously, the Installa-

tion of a microphone in a bedroom or in some comparably intimate

location should be avoided wherever possible.

It may appear, however,

that important intelligence or evidence relating to matters connected

with the national security can only be obtained by the Installation of

• a microphone in such a location. It 1s my opinion that under such

olIcumstances

the installation 1s proper and 1s not prohibited by the

Suprene Court's decision in the Irvine case.

NW 65360 Docld:32989653 Page 215

## Page 216

Previous interpretations which have been furnished to you

as to what may constitute trespass in the Installation of microphones,

suggest that the views expressed have been tentative in nature and

have attempted to predict the course which courts would iollOw

rather than reflect the present state of the law.

It 1s reali id

that not infrequently the question of trespass arises in conneotion

with the installation of a microphone. The question of whether a

trespass is actually involved and the

second question of the effeot

of such a trespass upon the admissibility in court of the evidence thus

obtained, must necessarily be resolved according to the circumstances

oi each case. The Department in resolving the problems which may arise

In connection with the use or mlorophone survelllance will review the

circumstances in each case in the light of the practical necessities

of Investigation and of the national interest which must be protected.

It is my opinion that the Department should adopt that interpretation

which will permit microphone coverage by the IBI In a manner most

conducive to our national interest.

I recognize that for the FBI.

Internal security and the national salety are paramount and.

MEMORANDU FOR THE ATTORNEY GINBRAT

With reference to the proper controls over wiretapping and

you till recall that I advised you

that back under the administration of Attorney General Clark I

recormended that all Government agencies refrain fron wiretapping

unloss there was specific approval in each instance by the Attorney

Genoral who is the chief law officer of the Government.

I repeated

the same recommendation to each successive Attornoy. General following

the administration of Attorney General Clark.

I have always felt that there was a very lar control'in the

handling of wiretapping by Gorgrnment agencies.

I am the only head

of a Governent Investigative agency who does not have the authority

to authorizo a wiretap, but under the syaten waich I personally set

Therefore, roguests for wiretaps are sent by me to the attorney

General for his approval or disapproval. I know that no such system .

MIMORANDUG FOR THE ATTORNEY GEHERAT

With reference to the propor controls over wiretapping and

the installation of microphones,

you will recall that I advised you

that back under the administration of Attorney General Clark I

racoMManded that all lovernuent agencies Feltain IrOn viretaDping

unless where was apectic approval in each instance by the Attorney

General who 1s the chief law officer of the Goverment. I repeated

the sane recommendation to each successive Attorney General following

the admiristration of Attorney General Clark.

I have always felt that there was a very lax control'in the

handling of wiretapping by Goverrment ageneles.

I am the only head

of a Goverrment investigative agency who does not have the authority

to authorize a wiretap, but under the system wnich I personally set

up therefore, raquests for virataps are sent by me to the Attorney

General for his approval of disapproval. I know that no such system

ns forlowed an other branches or the government and, In fact, in many

instances subordinatas quite far down the tine or authority tap tele-

phones without the specifie approval of the head of the agency and

certainly without specifle approval of the cabinet officer in charge

of the department.

I still foel quite strongly that no Goverment agency should

tap a telephone unless it is specifically approved in each instance by

the Attorney General. This would certainly circumseribe proniscuous

wIretapping on the part of Government agencies and vould centralize

In one place, the Attorney General's office, a record of any phone taps

1775

On the afternoon of August 19, 1975, John Ellif of the

SSC

staff, telephoned me to report that the Committee has

decided to deter on its pending request for the identity of

various so-called

• "recipient-source" witnesses in the COINTEL

program.

Mr. Ellif also emphasized that he wished to apologize

to the

Attorney General for possibly misstating the grounds

as to why the Committee and the staff had decided to reject

the proposals apparently agreed upon by Senator Church and

the Attorney General.

Finally, I noted to Jonn Ellif that I continue to have

difficulty in understanding why the staft insists that they

need further witnesses to establish any possible "damage" to

the targets of the COINTEL progran.

Ellif finally agreed

that since they do know the names and identities of the

targets,.

the latter probably would be the best witnesses on this issue

in any event.

Nonetheless, Ellif did stress that it is possible

that later on in the fall,

the Committee and its staff may choose

to come back and press its demands for the right to interview

Ithe recipient-source witnesses.

In 9/10/75, SA Daniel A. Flynn of the New York

Office (NYO) was interviewed by a Start Member of the U. S

Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities (SSC) in

its offices in Washington, D. C., on the subject of mail

openings. The interview was recorded by an SSC stenographer.

On the morning of 9/26/75, SAC Robert Denz, NYO,

telephonically contacted Supervisor

S. F. Phillips of the

Senstudy 75 Project and advised that Flynn had been contacted

9/16/25

by James Dick, the SSC Staff Member who had interviewed him.

Dick informed Flynn that the transcript of the interview

is available for review by Flynn but that the review must

be done in SSC offices, pursuant to SSC rules. The deadline

3:30 pm

for Flynn's review is 9/30/75.

Also according to SSC rules,

Flynn's review will not permit any substantive changes but

only changes as to grammar, and the like. Flynn desires

the opportunity to review the transcript and authority was

sought for his coming to Washington, D. C., the morning of

9/30/75.

In addition to seeking authority for the triPe ene

By a prior oral arrangement between Mc. Mark

Gitenstein, Staff Member, Senate Select Committee (SSC),

Mr. W. B. Wannall, Assistant Director, Intelligence Division (INTD),

a briefing was scheduled for 2:00 p.m. on 8/28/75.

in 6/29730 B4, 106

briefing was to consist of a discussion of the various indices

maintained and operated.by. the FBI.

Information pertaining

to these indices had previously been submitted the SSC by

letterhead memorandum dated July 17, 1975, and documents

pertaining to the indices were made available for review by

appropriately cleared SSC Staff Members at FBI Headquarters:

This briefing was held in the conference room of

the INTD, JEH Building, on 8/28/75 during the approximate

period 2:00 p.m. to 4:30 p.m.

Present at this meeting were

Assistant Director W. R. Wannall, Section Chief J. G. Deegan,

Unit Chief E. P. Grigalus, SA K. A. Mendenhall, all of the

INTD, Mark Gitenstein, Michael Epstein, and Martha Talley,

Staff Members of the SSC.

1722-2979925ia2

Main items of discussion during this briefing

centered around the Rabble Rouser Index (RRI), later known as

the Agitator

-Index (AI) ,

the Key Activist Program (KAP), the

the KAP were discussed and Mr. Wannall offered background

information and historical reasoning as to the necessity for

implementing these indices

and the KAP.

Nx. Deegan answered

questions pertaining to the AI and Messis Grigalus and

Mendenhall answered questions pertaining to the KAP, the SI,

and ADEX, which were raised by

Memorandum to Mr. W.

R. Wannall

Re :

Senstudy 75

62-116395

were advised there is no plan of action in the FBI for the

apprehension of the individuals so listed. The SSC Staff

Members were advised individuals currently listed on the

ADEX would merely be afforded priority investigative attention

during any national emergency which should occur; however,

they would not be apprehended. SSC Staff Members also

indicated they felt criteria for inclusion on the ADEX

when first established were the same as the criteria for

inclusion on the old SI. They were advised when the ADEX

Program was initiated the criteria were basically the same;

however, after closely following the matter for a period

of approximately & months, the criteria were reevaluated

and revised so only individuals who were considered

currently dangerous were to be included on the ADEX.

SSC Staff Members were also advised that the SI was

stored "off-line" in the Bureau's computers and as such

was utilized in a strictly in-house operation. Informa-

tion was therefore not available to outside agencies or

terminals tied in with the Bureau's computer system.

Staff Members also indicated from a review of material

made available to them it appeared as though there was

friction between the Bureau and the Department during the

late 1940s and early 1950s with respect to establishing

guidelines and policy in connection with the sI and they

desired to know what the cause of this friction was. INTD

representatives present advised they were unaware of the

cause of any such friction.

Other questions similar to those above were asked

by the SSC Staff Members and were answered by INTD personnel

present. In addition the following nine questions

were asked

by the SSC Staff Members and Mr. Wannall indicated answers

would be obtained and orally furnished:

1. Was there a memorandum which established the

RRI and does it indicate Mr. Hoover appeared before the

Civil Unrest Commission? (A memorandum dated 8/3/67. from

C. D. Brennan to vr. W. C. Sullivan indicates Mr. Hoover

instructed an index be compiled of racial agitators; however,

the memorandum does not indicate Mr. Hoover appeared before

the Civil Unrest Commission.)

Re :

R. Wannall

2. Was there a memorandum concerning the

expansion of the AI to include individuals of local

prominence? (Memorandum of G. C. Moore to Mc. W. C.

Sullivan dated 11/22/67 requested approval of an SAC

letter for expanding the Al to include local leaders as

well as national leaders involved in racial disorders.)

3.

Were individuals included on both the AI and

the SI and, if so, wasn't this a duplication of effort?

(Individuals were

included

on both the AI and the SI;

nowever, this was not necessarily a duplication of effort

inasmuch as the SI was to be utilized in the apprehensior

and detention of individuals considered dangerous and the

AI was an administrative aid to follow the activities and

movement of individuals attempting to cause racial

disorders.)

4. When did the SI become automated and was the

Reserve Index (RI) ever automated? (The SI became automated

during the early 1950s and was updated throughout the years

with the advancement of computer technology and purchase

by the Bureau of more advanced computers.

Following

discontinuance of the SI the ADEX was continued in the

computer systems in an "off-line" manner. The RI-A-

was placed on automatic data processing (ADP) equipment

the same as the SI.

RI-B was maintained at the field

level only and was never placed in the ADP equipment.)

5. Has the Bureau's copy of the Attorney General's

portfolio concerning the Emergency Detention Program (EDP)

been returned?

(One copy of the Attorney General's

portfolio concerning the EDP has been located and is

currently maintained in the Security Informant Unit of

the IS-2 Section, INTD.)

6. Who were the Bureau individuals who

(a) maintained the Attorney General's portfolio during

1968 and (b) involved with the EDP during the 1940s?

(The following individuals were identified through

review of pertinent communications during time period

in question: (a) 1968 - C. D. Brennan, P. F. Enlow,

T. P. Rosack; (b) 1946-D. M. Ladd, J. C. Strickland;

1948-Lish Whitson, W. H. Winterrowd, J. W. Yeagley.

7. When did the Department start reviewing and

approving the SI list?

Matters pertaining to the old

Custodial Detention List were first referred to the

Department during March, 1941. Copies of the SI were

submitted to the Department during 1951 and the Department,

on a continuing basis, reviewed matters pertaining to the

SI except for brief periods of time when funds and manpower

were not available until the SI was discontinued in 1971.)

8. Was there a form used by the Department

concerning the continuance or cancellation of individuals

on the s and, if so, what does the form look like?

(Forms were utilized

and copies have been obtained to

exhibit to SSC Staff Members.)

9. Do we have a copy of the form for including

or deleting an individual from the AI? (FD-397 was

utilized with the AI. A copy of this form will be

exhibited to SSC Staff Members.)

At the closure of this briefing SSC Staff Members

expressed their appreciation to the Bureau personnel present

and indicated the briefing had furnished them a better

understanding of the Bureau's utilization of the above

indices and the KAP.

ACTION:

With your approval and in accordance with your

revious instructions the Senstudy Unit will initiate contact

questions may be orally provided to the above-named SSC

On 8/22/75, John T. Elliff, Task Force Director for

Director Sec'y -

the Domestic Intelligence Task Force of the Senate Select Com-

mittee, advised that regarding proposed plans for testimony

by Bureau officials before the Senate Select Committee that

the Committee tentatively scheduled hearings for mid-October.

He cited October 16th as

being the approximate date.

tially, according to Elliff,

hearings concerning the Bureau

were to have been initiated in the first week of October but

the Staff Members did not have the necessary background in-

formation to conduct the hearings at that time and instead

scheduled hearings concerning IRS for early October.

Elliff indicated that the tentative format for

these hearings would be to furnish the Bureau an outline of

or a series of questions pertaining to the area to be coverea

in testimony prior to our appearance. He indicated that the

hearings would cover a narrow topic on any given day so

that

a Bureau official could be briefed and respond to questions

raised concerning the particular subject matter.

Elliff indicated that typical subjects of hearings

concerning the FBI would be a one-day hearing on political

abuse or

a series of hearings on COINEt 10: 02116315-714

Elliff indicated that it was the Committee's intent

to continue hearings regarding the FBI into mid-December once

they are initiated with the Bureau testifying at least once

a week during that period. He advised they also envisioned

the initial hearing as setting forth what the scope of the

Senate Select Committee inquiry had been into the FBI and of

topics to be covered by hearings.

Elliff felt this would

inform the House Select Committee of what areas the Senate.

Select Committee had delved into.

It is the Committee's intention to insert in some of the

blanks in the documents an identifying description of IRS

personnel who assisted the FBI in' certain instances, such

as "an IRS Special Agent" or "an IRS Inspector". We will

make these identifications based upon our notes from the

documents, and will supply you with copies of the documents

in which such descriptions have been typed in order that

you may check the accuracy of the descriptions. In this

way, we will avoid public identification of the IRs per-

ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED

Dear Mr. Daly:

Enclosed is a list of documents which the Senate Select

Committee on Intelligence Activities may decide to declassify

for its public hearings on the Huston Plan.

We invite your

opinion on any sections which you think ought to be sanitized

before declassification. Of course, the great majority of

key documents on the Huston Plan are already a matter of public

record.

Since these hearings may be held as early as September 23rd

and certainly by early October, your quick response would be

most helpful.

Sincerely,

Aard Cana

Chairman

Reference is made to letter dated September 19, 1975,

from Senator Frank Church, Chairman, SSG, to Mr. Paul V. Daly,

Office of Legal Counsel, FBI. This communication enclosed

a list of documents which the SSC may decide to declassify

for public hearings on the Huston Plan. The FBI was requested

to advise whether any of the documents required appropriate

excisions prior to the declassification.

On September 21, 1975, Messrs. William 0. Gregar

and Elmer W. Larson of the FBI met with Hir. John Elliff of the

SSC Staff. During this meeting, the documents, which were

enclosed with the September 19, 1975, letter, were carefully

reviewed and excisions were made and mutually agreed to.

This is to advise that the FBI has no objection

to the declassification and use of the documents for public

hearings providing the excisions mutually agreed to on

September 21, 1975, are in effect.

ALL EBI INFORMATION CONTAINED

Dear Mike:

The following two documents, which relate to the Martin

Luther King, JI. matter, are the subject of a pending Committee

request for documents:

A. Airtel dated 2/12/62 from SAC, New York, to

Director, FBI, subject "Dr. Martin Luther KIng,

JI., SM-C (00 :Atlanta) ;"and

B. Airtel dated 8/15/66 from SAC, New York, to

Director, FBI, subject "Communist Party, USA,

Counterintelligence Program, Internal Security

~ C (Stanley David Levison)."

These two documents had been previously provided to the

Committee in heavily or almost completely excised form.

Virtually the entire contents of Item A. (a 3-page airtel)

were excised because "it could result in identification of an

FBI informant," and more than 12 pages of Item B: (a 29-page.

airtel) were excised because such portions contained information

which

"tends to identify highly sensitive sources of continuing

value." A third document which is needed by the Committee, and

which would presumably also be provided by the Bureau only in

excised form is a New York field office letter to the Bureau

dated 6/21/62 as cited in the last paragraph of page 2 of the

10/11/62 memorandum from the SAC, Atlanta,

to the mirestor,

FBI, subject "Communist Infiltration of the Soughern Ch

slan

Leadership Conference, IS-C

(00: Atlanta)."

September 16, 1975

The Bureau's position with respect to the excised portions

of Items A. and

• B. above was reiterated by FBI representatives

at our September 9 meeting, notwithstanding our position that

these materials were deemed to be absolutely essential to our

complete understanding of the King investigation.

As you are

aware, several other documents previously provideä to the

Committee contain conclusionary statements about Stanley Levison

as predicates for many of the actions taken with respect to

King, and it would appear that the withheld portions of

A. and B. above, as well as the 6/21/62 New York letter

described above, would contain the detailed bases for such

conclusions.

I am sure you would agree that the underlying facts

concerning Levison are vital in order that we can meet our

responsibilities to fully assess the propriety of the FBI's

activities with respect to this case.

Accordingly, I would

appreciate your personal attention to this matter, including

your own examination of the three documents in question, and

hopefully, a determination by you that these documents should

be provided to the Committee in unexcised form (except for the

names of so-called "live" informants).

An early resolution of this matter is essential, and I

would hope you can respond by the end of the week.

Sincerely,

John T. Elliff

Dear Mr. Kelley:

I have been contacted by the Senate Select Intelligence

Committee and instructed by Mr. Paul Wallach to report for

an interview on September 23, 1975 at 2:00 F.M.

I have learned that the "Hunter" matter, on which -

I'm to be intervieved, is presently under review for possible

criminal prosecution by the Department of Justice. Accordingly,

since, while being associated with "Hunter", I was under Bureau

direction, I am requesting that an attorney be appointed for

me by the Department of Justice of arrangements be effected

that I can be reimbursed if I secure my own attorney.

Sincerely yourl!

Senate Select Committee Request for IRS Information

Reference is made to my memoranda of September 9, and

September I1, 1975 (copies of which are attached), by which I

forwarded to you copies of the September 4, 1975, letter from

SSC Chief Counsel Schwarz to the Attorney General and the letter

of "modification" dated September 10, 1975, from John Elliff to

me.

I have been orally advised (and will be in receipt of a

confirming letter today that the very long list of names and

organizations about whom tax information was and is sought by

Schwarz's September 4, letter was intended to apply as well to

the Bureau for its response.

The Bureau is, therefore, requested to provide relevant

returns and tax return information, on the individuals and

organizations listed in Mr. Scl

In other words, the request made in the September 4,

Schwar'S letter of September A 1s

for Bureau response except as Elliff's letter of modification

exempts the raw files of the Bureau from inclusion in this

request.

The SSC staff requests that materials be assembled on the

named individuals and organizations in the same order as they

are listea In the letter and that when a response for a given

name or organization involves alreat volume of materials ol

locuments, an appropriate Bureau offacial should advise either

Dear Mike:

As Mark and you discussed today on the phone,

it was the Committee's intent in Fritz Schwarz' letter

you of September 4, 1975, that the FBI, as well as the

Internal Security Division, provide information pertaining

to the individuals and organizations listed in

that letter.

Of course this letter and the August 29 letter are modified

by my letter of September 10.

Furthermore, this request is

of the highest priority and

therefore we want to be kept

informed of its progress on a daily basis.

Perhaps the

best approach would be to have Bureau representatives con-

Dowro"' tact either Mark Gitenstein or Art Harrigan immediately so

9/3/v thottl4 letter.

that we might prioritize the names listed in the September

priority insted.

SUBJECT:

Modification of SSC Request

Attached 1s & letter from John Elliff of the SSC staff

which modifies the language of the August 29, letter froni the S30's

Chief Counsel Schwarz to the Attorney General. The last sentence

of the first paragraph of the August 29, letter read as follows:

"Where an Internal Security Division request was

made with respect to a person or organization on whom

the Internal Security Division or the FBI maintatred

or maintains a file, we would appreciate the opportu

nity to review the entire file". (emphasis mine)

The modification of the first paragraph effected by the attached

letter deletes the words "or the FBI" as underlined above: Such

a nodification exempts the raw files of the Bureau fron inclusion

In this request. The request still requires response by the

Bureau for "all documents" in its possession as requested of the

entire Department generally by the modified first paragraph.

David Bushong, who identified himself as a Senate

Select Committee Staff Member, telephonically requested on

1/10/15 that the Bureau determine the Listing for telephone

California.

Bushong indicated that the fact he was attached to the Senate

Select Committee could be verified by inquiry with Staff Director

Bill Miller or Security Officer Ben Marshall of that Committee.

Mark Gitenstein of the Senate Select Committee was

telephonically contacted by SA Paul V. Daly and advised of the

request received from David Bushong.

He was informed that the

Bureau did not have authority to conduct an investigation for

the Senate Select Committee in the absence of instructions from

the Attorney General and that the Bureau would not conduct such

an investigation in the absence of same.

Gitenstein agreed that

the Bureau should not conduct the investigation and indicated he

would bring this to the attention of Bushong.

Subsequently, ASAC Arthur Barger of the San Diego

Office telephonically advised he had been contacted by David

Bushong and asked to make available to him information he had

requested the Bureau to furnish.

Barger was informed that the

Committee had been notified that this was an improper request

and that the Bureau was not going to comply. He was told to

tell Bushong that Mark Gitenstein of the Committee had been

apprised of this

matter and he should contact Gitensteing 75'130

Gitenstein was telephonically recontacted and advised

that. Bushong had contacted the San Diego Office requesting an

investigation and Gitenstein was reminded that he had stated

previously he would insure that Bushong was advised that his

was an Improper request.

Gitenstein explained that he did not

realize Bushong had left for San Diego and that he wougg SEP 25 1975

straighten the situation out.

RE:

SENSTUDY 75

Subsequently,

Gitenstein telephonically recontacted

and advised that the

request for investigation

had been done

SA Paul V. Dallbehind his and Elliff's back" apparently referring

to John Elliff, Task Force Director for the Senate Select Com-

mittee.

He indicated that this request had been discussed with

the Deputy Attorney General's Office and

was an investigation

being conducted by Senate Tower and Kurt Smothers, Minority

Counsel.

He requested that SA Daly contact Michael E. Shaheen,

JI., Special Counsel for Intelligence Coordination in the De-

partment, to verify that arrangements have been made for the

Bureau to conduct this investigation.

SA Daly contacted Shaheen and Shaheen advised that

he knew nothing of this request.

Shaheen was informed that

absent specific instructions from the Attorney General the

Bureau would not conduct the requested investigation and

Shaheen agreed that this was the proper position for the

Bureau.

Shaheen was informed that the Senate Select Com-

mittee Staff Member conducting the investigation was David

Bushong and Shaheen stated that he knew Bushong and Bushong

had formerly been the Administrative Assistant to former

Attorney General William Saxbe.

Subsequently, John Bayley, Assistant Minority

Counsel for the Senate Select Committee, telephonically con-

tacted SA Daly and apologized for the request that the Bureau

conduct an investigation for the Senate Select Committee and

he indicated that he thought arrangements had been made for

this investigation through the Deputy Attorney General's Office.

Bushong advised that Senator Tower was currently attempting to

locate the Attorney General to straighten out this particular

problem and apparently arrange for the Bureau to conduct such

an investigation.

RECOMMENDATION:

For information.
