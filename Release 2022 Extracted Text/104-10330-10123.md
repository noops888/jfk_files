Re: — Status of CIA Responses to Assassination Records Review Board’s Requests for
a Additional Information and Records 2.

Dear Barry:

Tam writing to update you on the Review Board’s understanding ofthe status of ClA’s 's
responses to our formal and informal requests for additional information and records
thatthe ARRB Staff has requested pursuant to Section 7(j)(1)(C)(ii) of the President John:
F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992, 44 U.S.C. § 2107 (Supp..V

» 1994) GEK‘Act).

We appreciate recent CIA efforts to respond to our outstanding requests. As we have
noted in earlier letters, these requests will be incorporated into the Agency’s final
compliance declaration. As you know, in requesting these materials, we are not
designating them “assassination records” at this time and we are not requesting that
CIA provide copies to the Review Board. As we have noted, all outstanding ARRB
requests for additional information, both formal and informal, were scheduled to be
completed by April 1, 1998. Although the April 1 deadline has passed, the Review.
Board still intends to complete all necessary work on the outstanding requests as soon
as possible. The Review Board is currently in the process of drafting its final report to

the President and to Congress and it considers the issue of CLA requests for additional
information and records a crucial one. At a meeting with the Review Board staff on
July 16, 1998, the CLA made a commitment to complete all but three of the outstanding
requests, formal and informal, by August 1, 1998. Due to Review Board staff
commitmerits, we are willing to extend that deadline to no later than Friday August 7,
1998.

Executive Director: T. Jeremy Gunn + Deputy Director: Thomas E. Samoluk
