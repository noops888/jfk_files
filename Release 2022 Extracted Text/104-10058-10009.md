The Guatemalan report of the assassination plot ends

with five requests for information by President LAUGERUD:

a .

Is ZIMERI still in the United States?

b..

In the event ZIMERI is not in the United

States legally, deport him

to Guatemala.

c.

Is ZINERI recruiting merceraries in the

United States for possible use in

Guatemala?

Does ZIMERI receive any kind of preferen-.

the FBI and State

Department.

variations of the name of ZIMERI or Robert HEMNING.

activity, and

alleged employment,

it is apparent that Gerald Patrick HEMING

The most recent incident wherein HEMMING claimed such

affiliation was in May 1975 when he volunteered his services

to the Drug

the late 1950's HENNING and STURGIS, both former U.S. Marines,

joined Fidel CASTRO in Cuba but returned shortly thereafter

claiming disillusionment with the CASTRO cause.

Soon thercafter,

STURGIS organized a group of mercenaries for Caribbean and

Central American activities which he named the International

Anti-Conmunist Brigade.

A reported sub-unit of this

"Brigade"

(the backers. of whom have never

Patrick HEMMING.

For an appreciation of the possible ramifications of

a Guatemalan government expose of this assassination plot

involving HEMING,

you are referred to attachments to instant

a memorandum by

the writer

dated 10 June

1975 in the name of Frank STURGIS and Everett Howard HUNT,

and an extract from a book published in early 1976 written by

Michael CANFIELD and Alan J. WEBERMAN.

The book Coup detat

in America--The CIA and the Assassination of John F.

is a diatribe against the Agency and attempts to link the Agency

with the assassination of President KENNEDY. One of the najor

links attempted by the authors is through Everett Howard HUNT,

to Frank STURGIS to Gerald Patrick HEMMING to Loran Eugone

HALL.

Loran Eugene HALL was a member of HEMMING's Interconti-

nental Penetration Force.

Loran Eugene HALL received nationwide

publicity in 1967 when New Orleans District Attorney "Jim"

GARRISON alleged that HALL (and the Intercontinental Penetration

Force) was involved in the assassination of President KENNEDY

and that members of this unit were connected with CIA.

shortly thereafter dropped his interest in HAll, but it and
