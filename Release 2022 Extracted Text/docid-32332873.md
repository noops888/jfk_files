JOSEPH BARBARA

The "Pittsburgh Press" of June 18, 1959, carried a front-
page article concerning the death of JOSEPH BARBARA of a
heart attack on June 17, 1959. It stated that BARBARA,

the "sick friend" that sixty gangsters dropped in to see

at his Apalachin, New York, home on November 14, 1957,

died of a heart ailment without revealing the secret

purpose of the underworld convention. It noted that BARBARA,
age 53, had been in Wilson Memorial Hospital at Johnson City,
New York, since May 29, 1959, with a heart attack. The
article further stated that the Sicilian-born BARBARA gave
up both his business and his home after State Police rounded
up his: guests and that the home was sold for $130,000 during
May, 1959, to a developer who announced plans. to convert it
into a tourist attraction. The article noted that his lingering
iliness had prevented his questioning by state and Federal
investigators who have indicted and jailed a number of the
nation's biggest "name" criminals for allegedly lying or
refusing to talk about his hilltop barbecue party.

C. CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES

General Information of a Criminal Nature Obtained Through
Informant Coverage

PG T-2, who has furnished reliable information in the past,
advised that "young JOHNNY" LA ROCCA, younger brother of
JOHN LA ROCCA, came in from Johnstown, Pa., during the last
week of May, 1959, and remained for at least five or six
days. He stated that from his comments to him at the
apartment in which he is living on one of the nights LA ROCCA
was in Pittsburgh, he understood that one purpose of his
extended stay was to confer with the elder LA ROCCA. He
advised that the appearance of both LA ROCCA and GABRIEL
"KELLY". MANNARINO before the Senate Labor Rackets Committee
on June 11, 1959, caused quiet comment among his clientele

in the rackets, most of which concerned the status of the
citizenship of LA ROCCA and the possibility of his deportation.

GENOVESE at his lounge prior to Apalachin but that at that
time he thought that SCIANDRA was from the New York City
area.

The informant advised that he had occasion to speak to
ARTHUR "ARCHIE" NELSON during the second week in June,

1959, and that NELSON said that he would have a cocktail
lounge in his new Phoenix Motel at Monroeville, Pa. He

said that unless he misunderstood NELSON, the partner of
MIKE GENOVESE told him that a small restaurant was also

in the planning stage. The informant said he carried on
this conversation with NELSON at Conti's Restaurant in
Pittsburgh's East Liberty section where he had arrived

alone for an early. breakfast at about 2:30 a.m. ona weekday
morning. He said that NELSON also told him that he had been
in Florida but did not mention the location or purpose of
his visit.

PG T-3, who has furnished reliable informationin the past,
advised that East Liberty and Homewood bookmakers plying
their trade in those sections of Pittsburgh are now under
constant surveillance by the younger members of the Pittsburgh
Police Department who have learned that they can collect

$10 each for staying away from the bookies for one week.

He stated that one of the bookie establishments on Homewood
Avenue in Pittsburgh is now under the control of EDDIE
MORANTI, close.confidante of MIKE GENOVESE and ARTHUR "ARCHIE"
NELSON, He said that MORANTI once worked at Archie's
Automatic Car Wash on Bennett Street and that he is now one

of NELSON's pickup men in the East Liberty-Homewood area.

He said that everyone knows that NELSONis simply the front
for GENOVESE and that the entire operation is being backed

by LA ROCCA.

The afore-mentioned informant advised that he was advised
that eight policemen demanded money at one time during the
last week of May, 1959, and that the pressure in the Homewood
area has become so increased that a small operation in which,
he is interested has been lucky to net between $100 and $150‘
a day. He said that it has always been his contention that
the GENOVESE-NELSON bookmaking operation will never be
disturbed by the Pittsburgh Policé Department because it has
