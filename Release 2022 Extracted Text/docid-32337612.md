does not desire the subjects to be interviewsd. mn

Unless you have information whieh would dictate otherwise,
you are autherized to place these cases in a clesed status.

NOTE: Confidential Bureau source Pat'O'Brien fugnished t] e

will be forthcoming from the original source. The casesagainst the
subjects ae based on conjecture and it therefore does not appear
desirable to continue these investigations. Pat O'Brien was contacted
dn connection with the information furnished by him in March, 1950,
and on 3-3=55«
