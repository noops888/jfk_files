Tho Heed for _a Bow Poltey
; fho basic assumption of our . present Congo policy is that

‘we could gst Katanga reintegrated into the Congo and an effective
moderate government established and fmnotioning 4m Leopoldville,
‘by persuasion end diplomacy backed up by threats of econenfe action.
This assumption hes turned out to be trong. It is wrong because
Thsombo and his supporters are learly not going ‘to rointegrate wales:
_ they bave-to aid ‘nobhing we have done. convinees Pshembe that,” ‘i the
my last analysis, he will be farced to 4¢.° :
| It is also wrong became wa are not pusiding en effective Contre:
‘Government ia Leopoldville. A largely irresponsible Perliamnt end
“a flabby adninistration at not good enough as = political framswork:
Adoule is the best leader on the torizon, ‘but we should be bolping
to develop other political Asederahip.

if assured of this more forthcoming US/U¥ support. Moreover,
although the UMEK is now negotiating the subject with Tshombe,
when it 1s faced with us detmmination to end secession, this might
stimulate them to turn over inmadistely their taxes and foreign
exchange: to the Menotary- Council with or without Tshombe’s
agrocment. Working - ‘out the: agreed division of power betwen the

a Central. Government and the Katanga and arrangements for militery -

integration. ‘would veo-a more complex task. We think this could
