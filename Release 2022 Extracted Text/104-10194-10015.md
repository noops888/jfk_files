This is the first time a fitness report has been
prepared on CAZAZZUS.-herself, although previous fitness
reports on her husband, Douglas J.. FEINGLASS, have mentioned

--her—valuable contribution, She and FEINGLASS continue
to work as an excellent team. CAZAZZUS works conscientiously
H and quickly-and saves the Station a great deal of timo in the
routine processing of paper and tapes. Her interest in the
subject matter and her analytical ability enable her to weed
out superfluous material and assist FEINGLASS in his

translations and analyses.
