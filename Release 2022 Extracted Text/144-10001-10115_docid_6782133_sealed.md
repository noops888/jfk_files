I. The AmbasSadofi,to Washington visited: me and
thé conversation dealt With the. dégestic situation in America
and some aspects of the intérnation§1 situation and the ‘situation
in the Middle East. ance .

II. He said:

A. The world had suffered."2 a great loss in KENNEDY ' s
death. It appeared to him that the killer was not a patty to
a conspiracy but was a blind fanatic nourished by the ¥adical
milieu of the state where he Pies ia

B. He added that hé. had accompanied JouNSsON| :

. as KENNEDY's Vice President and
that he had noted the following: [Part 2] :

JOHNSON was practical-minded. He was not -good at
listening. He was ar “expert in American domestic affairs but
had not handled forgign affairs very much. He was impatient
and quick-tempered; nevertheless, he added that his assumption
of the presidency’ had changed his disposition.

c. He said that JOHNSON would be the presidential
candidate of,’the Democratic Party in the coming election campaign
and that thé Republicans had not yet decided on a serious rival

D. He stated that their conjecture jras that
JOHNSON would continue to pursue KENNEDY's foreign policy,
particularly with regard to trying to reach an understanding
with the Russians and calming the tension of the ¢old war,
although it was not unlikely that his methods in this would

be somewhat different from KENNEDY's. Nevertheless, he said
that JOHNSON's job would not be easy since he was facing
problems in South America and NATO and Southeast Asia and the
Middle East. He said that KHRUSHCHEV appeared to be more
anxious than the Americans [Part 4] for an understanding with
Washington because of numerous domestic problems and his dispute
with Peking and the presence of opposition to him in Russia and
some of the Communist nations. He said that KHRUSHCHEV had to
continue his policy of truce for many reasons.

He stated that the policy of truce might change
for unexpected reasons, such as KHRUSHCHEV's death, etc.

He said that he thought that Labor would win in
the elections in Britain. He noted that they would continue
the policy of rapprochement with the Soviets. He pointed out
that the Laborites would strive [Part 5] for a further
rapprochement with West Germany and said that their policy
would be progressive with regard to racial discrimination and
colonial problems.

III. When I was asked about conditions in the Middle
East and our relations with America, I explained the development
of our relations with America and friendly nations over the
past years and how this development had led to results which
were rewarding to all. I went into detail about the period of
transition through which some of the nations of the Middle East
are passing and the conditions which had resulted and said that
tendentious propaganda was giving a [Part 6] false interpretation
to the events of the Middle East. I discussed our domestic
policy which is based on economic development in conformity with
practical and (1 wd G] methods, and the state and development of
the country and what we had achieved in this regard in the
roughest circumstances. I explained our foreign policy based
