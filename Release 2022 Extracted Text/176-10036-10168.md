..URGING THAT THE SMALLEST NUMBER OF PERSONS BE AWARE OF THESE

DETAILS•

6. WE DO NOT BELIEVE IT WISE TO ASK THAT "BIG MINH" PASS HIS .

PLANS TO GEN STILWELL. THE VIETNAMESÉ BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE MEMBERS

• OF THE U.S. MILITARY WHO LEAK TO THE GOVERNMENI OF VIETNAM. I DO NOT

• DOUBT THAT THIS IS AN UNJUST SUSPICION BUT. IT IS A FACT THAT THIS.

SUSPICION EXISTS AND THERE IS NO USE IN PRETENDING THAT. IT DOES NOT.

7. I MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR FURNISHING THE BERIH EQUIPPED MILITARY:

AIRCRAFT WHICH I TRUST IS A JET. I INTEND TO TELL PAN AMERICAN THAT

A JET HAS BEEN DIVERTED FOR MY USE AND THEREFOR I WILL NO. LONGER

NEED THEIR SERVICES., THIS. WILL UNDOUBTEDLY LEAK TO THE NEWSPAPERS AND .

THE GVN MAY STUDY THIS MOVE WITH SOME SUSPICION. I WILL ANSWER ANY

INQUIRIES ON THIS SCORE TO THE EFFECT THAT I AM MOST PLEASED SY THIS

'ATTENTION AND THAT THIS IS OBVIOUSLY DONE AS A MEASURE TO INSURE MY

CONFORT AND SAVE MY TIME. TO ALLAY SUSPICIONS FURTHER, I WILL OFFER

SPACE ON THE AIRCRAFI TO MACU FOR EMERGENCY LEAVE CASES, ETC, AND

HANDLE THIS IN AS ROUTINE FASHION AS POSSIBLE. I WISH TO RESERVE

COMMENT AS TO MY ACTUAL TIME OF DEPARTURE UNTIL I HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL

INFORMATION, HOPEFULLY. TOMORROW•

8. YOUR PARA 7. SOMEWHAT. PERPLEXES ME. •IT DOES NÓT SEEM SENSIBLE

TO HAVE THE MILITARY IN CHARGE OF A MATTER WHICH IS SO PRO-

FOUNDLY POLITICAL AS A CHANGE OF GOVERNMENI. IN FACT, I WOULD SAY

TO DO THIS WOULD PROBABLY BE THE END OF ANY HOPE FOR A CHANGE OF

GOVERNMENT HERE. THIS IS SAID IMPERSONALLY AS A GENERAL PROPOSITION,

SINCE

GEN HARKINS IS A SPLENDID GENERAL AND AN OLD FRINED OF MINE TO

WHOM I WOULD GLADLY ENTRUST ANYTHING I HAVE. I ASSUME THAT

THE EMBASSY AND MACU ARE ABLE TO HANDLE NORMAL ACTIVITIES UNDER A,

THAT CAS CAN CONTINUE COUP CONTACTS UNDER B, AND AS REGARDS C, WE

MUST SIMPLY DO THE VERY BEST WE CAN IN THE LIGHT OF EVENTS AFTER •

THE COUP HAS STARTED.

9. WE APPRECIATE THE STEPS TAKEN AS OUTLINED IN PARA 8.

HOWEVER, WE SHOULD REMEMBER THAT THE GVIN IS NOT TOTALLY INEPT IN IIS

FOREIGN SOUNDINGS AND THAT THESE MOVES SHOULD BE AS DISCREET AND

SECURITY CONSCIOUS AS POSSIBLE. I WOULD, OF COURSE, CALL FOR THESE

¡ORCES ONLY IN CASE OF EXTREME NECESSITY SINCE MY HOPE COINCIDES

JITH THE GENERALS THAT THIS WILL BE AN ALL VIETNAMESE AFFAIR.
