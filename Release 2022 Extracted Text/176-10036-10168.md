6. WE DO NOT BELIEVE IT WISE TO ASK THAT "BIG MINH” PASS HIS

OF THE U.S. MILITARY WHO LEAK TO THE GOVERNMENT OF VIETNAM. I DO NOT ,

“pouBT THAT THIS IS AN UNJUST SUSPICION BUT IT IS A FACT THAT THIS

8. YOUR PARA 7 SOMEWHAT.PERPLEXES ME. -IT DOES: NOT SEEN SENSIBLE
TO HAVE THE MILITARY IN CHARGE OF A HATTER WHICH IS SO PRO
“FOUNDLY POLITICAL AS A CHANGE OF GOVERNMENT. IN FACT, I WOULD SAY
To Do THIS woULD PROBABLY BE THE END OF ANY HOPE FOR A CHANGE OF
GOVERNMENT HERE. THIS, IS SAID IMPERSONALLY AS A GENERAL PROPOSITION,
SINCE GEN HARKINS IS A “SPLENDID GENERAL AND AN OLD FRINED OF MINE TO :
WHOM I WOULD GLADLY ENTRUST ANYTHING T'HAVE. I ASSUME THAT
THE: EMBASSY AND MACV ARE ABLE TO HANDLE NORMAL ACTIVITIES UNDER 4s
“THAT CAS CAN CONTINUE COUP CONTACTS UNDER B, “AND AS REGARDS C, WE
MUST SIMPLY DO THE VERY BEST WE CAN IN THE LIGHT OF EVENTS AFTER :
THE ‘COUP Has STARTED.
