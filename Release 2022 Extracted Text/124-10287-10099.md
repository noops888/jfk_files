The NYO feels that the trip of RICHARD FRANK is most

Wick, significant because of its apparent urgency. It appears also

that the subject cannot get her passport in time to be in
England this Saturday, so her husband is going in her place.
It would appear, therefore, that he has an appointment to meet
someone in England. ae
