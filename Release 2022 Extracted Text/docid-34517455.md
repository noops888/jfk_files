On November fourteen

last the above source advised that according to WER BElL, MAXIMILIEN met.

with him on the night of November nine last at the University Inn,

Coral Gables, Florida, where WER BELL was registered under the name

THRAFT. At this meeting MAXIMILIEN agreed to pay WER BELL the sum of

twenty thousand dollars for these firearms. WER BELL stated MAXIMILIENS

subsequently departed for Haiti to obtain the money for purchase of

these firearms from President DUVALTER, and that MAXIMILIEN was

expected to return to Miami on Tuesday, November fifteen next.

'WER BIlL said although MAXIMILIAN would obtain the money from

President DUVATTER, MAXIMILIEN had no intention of delivering the

firearms to the Haitian President. WER BELL Said MAXIMILIEN has been

cooperating with ROLANDO MASFERRER ROJAS and has been meeting

secretly with MASFERRER in a meeting place outside of Metropolitan

Miami. MAXIMILIEN has agreed to turn over the firearms obtained

through WER BELL to MASFERRER for use on the latter's planned invasion

of Haiti and overthrow of DUVALIER.

WER BELL has agreed to make

these firearms available to MASFERRER once he has received the twenty

thousand dollars from MAXIMILIaN. (5)

"WER BELL confidentially advised the source that he, WER BEll was.

planning to accept the twenty thousana dollars from MaXIMILIEN, but

(5)

would delay delivery of the arms to MASFERRER until after the invasion

of Haitai, in order that he could keep both the twenty thousand dollars

and the firearms. WER BELL said that MASFERRER has sufficient arms

for the invasion and did not need the firearms now in the Dominican

Republic.

"WER BELL, also stated that MASFERRER claims to have seventeen boats

and a force of between two hundred and three hundred men ready to

depart for this invasion of Haiti and hopes to depart from Miami within

the next week. WER BELL also stated that a large group of HAITIANS

were standing by in the Dominican Republic to assist in these invasion

efforts. "(ul)

7. On Il June 1968, a neighborhood investigation was conducted by

SA WINING in the vicinity of Rt. Ml, Macland-Dallas Road, Powder

Springs, Georgia. Mr. BOB MEREDITH, Conmercial Artist, Rt. #l, Powder

Springs, Georgia, advised the following in substance;

He has been

acquainted with SUBJECT as a personal friend and neighbor since 1962.

SUBJECT has been in various forms of self-employment during the past

six (6) years, to include advertising and the market of baby pants by

the brand name

"Handy Panty."

SUBJECT resided in the Dominican

Republic from approximately 1963 to 1965 doing business as a tropical

fruit grower. SUBJECT's latest business venture is developing

various modifications of hand gun silencers. He has seen the weapons

that SUBJECT is modifying and considers SUBTECT to be a legitimate

businessman•

PEYTON MCGRUDER, a resident of Coral Gables, Fla., was

previously associated with SUBJECT in the advertising agency and is

presently helping SUBJECT promote the sale of his product.

He has

no knowledge of SUBJECT's means of income but is of the opinion that

FRED BROWN, President of Sionics, Inc. is contributing a large share

of the operational cost. subJect has not made any trips putside

of the United States for business or pleasure within the past two

years. MERITH considers SUbJEel to be honest, trustworthy and

extremely capable in the type of work in which he is currently

involved. He believes SUBJECT would be loyal to the United States

as SUBJECT emphatically denounces any form of Communism.

nothing of an unfavorable nature regarding SUBJECT's character.

He recalled reading in a newspaper about SUB-ECT being arrested for

an alleged violation of the Neutrality Aet involving the sale of

firearms to a foreign country. However, to his knowledge, SUBJECT

was cleared of the arrest and the charges against SUBJECT were

dropped. He would have no reservation in recommending SUBJECT have

access to classified Department of Defense material.

8. On 11 June 1968, HUGH LEE POORE, Chief of Police, Powder Springs,

Georgia, and IT COBB VARNER, Grocer, neighbor to SUBJECT, Rt. #1,

Powder Springs, Georgia, were interviewed separately by SA TWIVING

and advised substantially the same information as follows:

have known SUBJECT since approximately 1949 on a casual basis..

SUBJECT has been self-employed most of the past 18 years in advertising

the production of rubber baby pants and the production of hand gun

silencers. SUBJECT worked in his home and up to 1965 made numerous

trips to Carribean countries.

They knew of nothing derogatory regarding

SUBJECT's character. They considered SUBJECT to be loyal, trustworthy,

capable and of good moral character.

Several years ago, SUBJECT was

in a bad financial state; however, it appears SUBJECT has done quite

satisfactorily in paying his debts

during the past two years. They

recommended SUBJECT for a position of trust.
