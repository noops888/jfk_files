TJs On 11 June 1968, a neighborhood investigation.was. conducted. by
SA TWINING in the vicinity of. Rt. #1, Macland-Dallas. Road, Pewder
Springs, Georgia. Mr. BOB MEREDITH, Commercial. Artist, Rt. A, Powder
Springs, Georgia, advised the following .in substance: He has been
acquainted with ‘SUBJECT..as..a personal. friend.and neighbor since 1962..
SUBJECT has been in various forms of self-employment. during. the..past.
six (6) years, to.include advertising. and the market. of baby pants by
the brand name. "Handy Panty." .. SUBJECT resided in. the Dominican
Republic from.approximately 1963 to.1965.doing business as a’ tropical
fruit grower. SUBJECT’s latest business: venture is developing
yarious modifications of. handgun .silencers.. He has seen the weapons
that SUBJECT. is modifying and .considers. SUBJECT: to be.a.legitimate
businessman. PEYTON McGRUDER, .a resident of Coral Gables, Fla., was
previously.associated with SUBJECT.in.the advertising agency and is
presently. helping SUBJECT promote the sale. of his product. He.has.

no knowledge of SUBJECT 's means of income.but..is.of the opinion. that
FRED: BROWN, .President.of Sionics, Inc.~is contributing a large share
of the operational.cost... SUBJECT.has .not..made.any trips peteite

of the United States. for.businéss or..pleasure within the. t- two
years. MERIDETH considers. SUBJECT to.be-honest, trustworthy and
extremely.capable. in.the type of workin. which he is currently
involved. .He, believes SUBJECT would be loyal. to the United States

as SUBJECT emphatically denounces any. form of Communism. He knows
nothing of an. unfavorable nature regarding. SUBJECT's. character.

He recalled reading.in a newspaper about SUBJECT being arrested for
an alleged violation of the.Neutrality Act involving the sale of
firearms to-a foreign country. However, to his knowledge, SUBJECT

‘was cleared.of the arrest and the charges. against .SUBJECT were

dropped. He would have no reservation in. recommending SUBJECT have
access to. classified Department of Defense .material.

-8. On 11 June. 1968, HUGH LEE POORE, Chief of Police, Powder Springs,

Georgia, and TY. COBB VARNER, Grocer, neighbor to SUBJECT, Rt. #1,
Powder Springs, Georgia, were interviewed separately. by SA.IWINING

and ‘advised substantially the same information. as follows: ‘They

have known _SUBIECT since approximately 1949 on a casual basis.

SUBJECT has been self-employed most of the past 16 years in advertising
the production of rubber baby pants and the production of hand-guy,
silencers. “SUBJECT worked in his home and up to 1965 made numerous
trips. to Carribean countries. ‘They. knew of nothing derogatory regarding
SUBJECT's character. They considered SUBJECT.to be loyal, trustworthy,
capable and of good moral character. Several-years ago, SUBJECT was
ina bad financial state; however, it appears SUBJECT. has. done quite
satisfactorily in paying his debts during the past two years. They
recommended SUBJECT for a’ position of ‘trust.
