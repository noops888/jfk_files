SUBJECT : Draft Replies to G. Robert Blakey

1. Forwarded herewith are draft letters to G. Robert Blakey
making comments on each of the three packages that we have received -
and reviewed together. [

2. These drafts are at least subject to revision if the Director
supports the-view of the DDO that there should be no direct references
or some euphemism in referring to CIA personnel in Mexico Station.

3. It is requested that you review these drafts and let me have
your comments. I would propose to write a separate letter on each
section so it would appear that we are making progress, rather
than holding up everything for those sections that are still subject
to resolution of the references to overseas Stations.

4. You have copies of the Draft Staff Study and it would be
appreciated if I could have your comments on the attached by COB

Mr. G, Robert Blakey
Chief Counsel and Director
Select Committee on Assassinations
House of Representatives
Washington, D.C. 20515.
Dear Mr. Blakey:
Forwarded herewith are comments on the draft reports forwarded by
you recently.
: The first of these is designated Issue A - #2, Opening of
Lee Harvey Oswald's 201 file. It was received by us marked Top Secret.
It is our understanding that you do not intend to publish this in

unclassified form, and wish only our comments for accuracy. We would

consider the classification of Secret more appropriate than Top Secret and ~

so handie it. (S)
Page 2000570. Line 9. The statement appears that there are two
naval documents listed as in the file that were not found there (presumably
by the HSCA investigators). Both documents are there, but being Third
Agency records, were enveloped: and marked by their identifying numbers,
which may not”have been recognized ‘by ‘the investigators. (v)
Same page. It is noted that the Deputy Director for Operations is
a person, his command being the. Directorate of Operations. Shorthand usage.
gives the colloquial usage of "DDO" ‘for Directorate of Operations, but it
is literally incorrect. You may wish to modify this where it appears in
syour draft. (@)

Page 2000571.. Russ Holmes did prepare an informal explanation, a

‘copy of which was transmitted to your offices for retention in the CIA work

area on 28 November 1978. ‘It.should*be available there; it still is at
CIA headquarters. (e) : .
Page 2000574. Not having.seen Larson's testimony, we don't know what
he actually said. The fact is that the Office of Security does not open
201 files, ever. That Office is under the Deputy Director for Administration,
while 201 files in CIA exist only in the Directorate of Operations. ic)
Page 2000575. The statement to the effect that information would have
warranted opening of a 201 file on Oswald is correct, but it is incomplete.
While it would have warranted it, had it been decided to do so, it would
not necessarily have caused the opening of a file. This is commented on
further below. (WY
Page 2000579. The memorandum in question is quoted accurately, but
the memorandum is not accurate. The Oswald file was opened as the result :
of work arising out of a request from the Department of State dated 25 October
1960. The testimony given by the person opening the file is correct on this
point. (3) ,
Page 2000580. “Again, the memorandum is quoted correctly, but it is
incorrect. Oswald's letter to. the U.S. Embassy in Moscow was dated
5 February 1961, being received 13 February. That was the first news of
his intention to return to the U.S., and his file had been opened already, in
December 1960, as a result of the earlier State Department request. (vw)
Page 2000584. It is probably incorrect to say that: Mrs. Egerter
“claims" ‘to have done something. She gave her best memory of what she did

and why, which was probably broadly correct, although with some errors in

¢s)

detail. The point is that what.she says is the best description on the opening.

Page 2000587 on Martin and.Mitchell, "...whose defection to the
Soviet Union in September 1960 was .6f-concern because of their previous access
to classified information." Cv)
Pages 2000589-2000590. References to "a thirteen month delay" and
that it (the Clandestine Service) "failed to act...by initiating the opening
of a 201 file," indicates a misunderstanding of the procedure and standards
for opening 201 files. (8) .
First, there are certain criteria that must be met before
a file may be opened. The administrative objective is to hold down
the number of 201 files... There is not, and was not, a. positive
requirement to open a file. Rather, it was up to the judgment of
the officer in question whether. to do so or not, if it met the criteria: c)
There was no requirement to open a file on a person such
as Oswald.» There being no requirement there could be no "failure,"
if it wasn't done. Nor would there have been a “delay." Oswald's
later role in history may make him seem more significant today than
he was when the first papers. brought him to CIA's attention, but
professional hindsight supports the absence of such action at the time.
Further, it was still a judgment cal] when the file was actually opened;
it would have been entirely appropriate to not have opened the file
then. Ce)
In any event, the opening of the file does not affect the records in
, ‘the system on the person in question; it only-serves to consolidate

eopies “of records into a single working file. (c)

Washington, D.C. -20515

Dear Mr. Blakey:
I am submitting herewith informal comments on the drafts submitted

recently. It will be something of a mish-mash of factual correction

‘and comment, as well as making security observations where appropriate, (v )

xt is my understanding that you intend for only one or two
of these sections to be unclassified for publication. (Cv) 7
Section Noted as "A 5," Miscellaneous Issues - HTLINGUAL Index Cards

It is our understanding that this is not intended for unclassified
publication.. In its present form we have given it an overall classification
of Confidential. It is understood we are to comment for accuracy only.

We have no points to make on this. ce)

Section Noted as "A 6," Miscellaneous Issues - Lee Harvey Oswald's
ening Sheet. iG"

It. is our understanding that this is not intended for unclassified
publication. In its present form we have given it an overall classification
of Secret. “It 1s understood we are to comment for accuracy only.C¥ )

As a matter of observation, it is noted that had the investigators
made inquiry of those individuals who had working familiarity with the

computer symbols on 201 opening-sheets, the answer was readily available.

It is interesting that the-officer “interviewed, noted at page 3.0f +

“this draft, was being asked to-rely on his memory some fifteen years

old (as good as his memory is, it betrayed him on this point). The
record is quite clear that the symbol "AG" was in existence prior to the
assassination of Lee Harvey Oswald. This really was a non-issue from
the beginning, and simply required so much time because of the failure
of the investigators to make a formal ‘inquiry about it. cS)

Section Noted as "A'7,"-Miscellaneous Issues’~ Lee Harvey Oswald's
201 Opening Sheet’ iG"

This appears to be entirely duplicatory of the section designated as

A-6 above, and the comments immediately above apply equally to this. G)

Section Noted as “A'8,"'- ZRRIFLE ‘

It is our understanding that this is not intended for unclassified
publication. vIn its present form we have given it an overall classification
of Confidential. It ‘is understood we are to comment for accuracy only. Cu)

The assertion of Harvey's "known antagonism" and his “known hatred"
of "the Kennedy's" is a bit hyperbolic, as presented, and seeks to establish
a premise that is highly dubious. (>)

It is correct to say that “He disagreed with the Administration's
approach to Cuban operations, and told the Attorney General just that
in quite candid terms.” He was essentially a tough and blunt man, and
had no illusions as to what he was doing. The act probably led to his
reassignment. It is safe.to assume that he held some personal resentment
for the Attorney General, but extension of that, in malevolent form, to

the President is a bit. much. Further, it is unlikely that the Committee



14-00000

has any competent evidence that would provide a basis for imputing a
malevolent attitude to him; he:-was..a-manto keep his own counsel and .
it is doubtful that many really knew his private thoughts Cu )

Additionally, it seems that ZRRIFLE never reached a stage that could
be represented as the capability to act in the United States, as implied
in the draft under the characterization of "means" in the formula of
"motive, means and opportunity." In fact, the way in which ZRRIFLE
developed in Harvey's mind, in the course of his plans against Castro,
make the separation fairly clear; he related the two only loosely in his
mind, because of what might be described as generic similarity of subject
matter, but beyond that there was no relation. )

ZRRIFLE did not fit the design this draft would give it, so far as ~
the discussion ‘is concerned. Harvey's view of ZRRIFLE is set out in some detail
in the 1967 report by the Inspector General, and there is no contrary
evidence. If the premise is the reason for discussing this, then the
entire section fails because of the invalidity of the premise. CJ)

Section Noted as "A 9," - HELSINKI

It is our understanding that.this is. not intended for unclassified
Publication. In its present form we have given it an overall classification
of Confidential. It is understood that we are to comment for accuracy
only. -Factually, we have no comments. (em)

Section Noted as "A 10," which deals with non-interviewing of Oswald

It is our-understanding ‘that ‘this ‘is not intended for unclassified

publication. In its present form we have given it an overall classification



14-00000

of Secret. It is understood that .we are to comment for accuracy
only.
As an editorial observation, on the first page, the third sentence
described CIA's "claim-that no records existed" concerning.a debriefing
of Oswald as stimulating speculation of some connection between Oswald
and the Agency. The reverse was the case. CIA's statement, in affidavit
‘form to the Warren. Commission, was in response to such allegations.
Its response was not "instigated by a newspaper article." It may be
that the Warren Commission reacted to such an article, which led to its
request to CIA, but CIA-does not submit affidavits in response to press
stories. Simply stated, CIA responded to a Warren Commission request. @)
It is noted that, among other reasons for Oswald's not .
being interviewed (and there were a-number), is the consideration -- given
HSCA in Interviews it conducted -- that at the time the Soviet Union was
releasing a Jarge number of ‘its citizens, who had been held from migration,

and the machinery was also occupied with more likely sources. Ce)

Section Noted as "A 11," - aLvarapo (c )

“It is our understanding that this section is intended for unclassified
publication. In its present form we have assigned an overall classification
of Secret. It is also understood that a review for accuracy is desired.

This draft provides an opportunity to sanitize the paper, letting the
basic story to be told while protecting points of security concern to CIA.

Some of the comments will be detailed. (uv)



14-00000

By way of preface, we. would prefer that the concealment of
Alvarado's name and nationality"be continued, employing the "D" used
by the Warren Committee and the Church Committee. His naming would permit
identification of his nationality. ‘Describing his relationship with his
Nicaraguan case officer also reveals operational relationships of
the Agency. Reference to his origins in another Latin American nation
should meet the needs of description. Cc)

Further, reference to the Mexico City Station, or its officers,

also presents problems with which you are familiar. It is suggested

‘that you use a general euphemism that permits the story to be told

while avoiding specific reference to the Station, as such. We suggest
that the literary presentation simple mention "CIA officers assigned
in Mexico to investigate the assassination." Although literally true
it avoids speci fying that they were a group of officers already

at the Agency installation who were assigned to that work. References
‘to communications from Mexico City could simple refer to cables and
dispatches from the "CIA representatives assigned to the Mexico
investigation.” (S)

The statement at the bottom of the .2nd° page, 2001160, says “the
Alvarado allegation stands:as ‘the only specific substantive investigation
by U.S. authorities in Mexico City of possible Cuban complicity. in
President Kennedy's assassination," That Mr..Mann thought. so doesn't change
the fact. It is untrue, as the records of this Agency amply demonstrate.

It may be the only firm allegation. that was made that could be investigated.

On the seventh page, 2001166, reference is made to an intercepted,
taped and transcribed conversation between President Dorticos and
Ambassador Armas. As you are aware, this sort of description would
have to be modified to meet our objections. We suggest something

as follows: Cg )

"A sensitive and extrenely ‘reliable source reported
that on 26 November Cuban President Dorticos. spoke with
Cuban Ambassador Hernandez-Armas in Mexico. During the
conversation Dorticos inquired if Silvia Duran, in her interrogation
by Mexican authorities, had been asked if the. Cubans had offered

Oswald money. . Armas said more than-once that no.such question had
been asked." cs, ww “gveseut coutexty Oo welen stow S.

quickly be returned to Havana in order to eliminate any possibility

Mr. Johnson that he sent (State) channels to Ambassador this

afternoon attempting to give him better perspective on this whole

problem....". (CIA Doc DIR-85469, 11/27/63) ce)

Twelfth page, 2001171, beginning of second paragraph, states that
the record discloses that Mann's efforts to investigate Cuban complicity
in the assassination “were being restrained." The entire issue was how
to handle the Alvarado allegation, as distinguished from "Cuban complicity.

The discussion omits any reference to the rather extensive documentation as

to why there were reservations about Alvarado, nor does it seem to consider

that it was_not so much a case of restraining Hann's desire to look into

the matter as. it was to not..accept his predetermined conclusions. (ce)

Thirteenth page, 2001172... The draft apparently mixes Alvarado with
Oswald. ic)

Same page.. DIR 85258, followed by DIR 85653, offers a better summary
of CIA's understanding of the New Orleans question. The quotation from
the latter follows: :

"1. (FBI) says their follow-up investigation of Oswald's
activities has produced 'reliable indications' that he was in
New Orleans on 19 September 1963..... This, coupled with
earlier evidence that he was in New Orleans applying for. unemployment
insurance on 17 September 1963, means Oswald would have had to
fly to Mexico and back between.17 and 18 September in order
to be at the Cuban Embassy getting his pay off, as Alvarado
claims, on 18 September.» Cc) ,

‘is provided by the statement preceding it in the draft. As stated in the
sdraft, the operator was to ensure that Alvarado was to be "well-fed, rested,

Dear Mr. Blakey:
Forwarded herewith are comments on draft reports forwarded
by you recently. (uv)
These first of those covered in this letter is entitled Cuban-Ameri

It is understood) that this is intended for unclassified publication.

Our ‘comments will indicate sanitization modifications in the text, as

well as corrections of fact. Cw) 7

Similar euphemisms as are suggested in the draft on the Alvarado
case should: be ‘employed. Similarly, reference to LITEMPO should be deleted
where it appears. The LIFIRE reference should also be deleted, as it
represents a unilateral operational capability of CIA; a general reference
to a sensitive source should suffice. ©)

The name of the subject of the discussion, Lopez, should be deleted,
and a general reference to the Cuban-American should suffice. (c )

Page 3. Agree with the indicated deletions referring to operational
and liaison sources and activities. Reference to photography of the
Cuban-American should be deleted; it comes from a liaison source, which
skiaison would recognize inthe draft (page 4, as welt). Cc )

cited without recording that it is in error. The point is relevant to

subsequent observations in the draft. (ec )

Same page. The reference to LAM/FI should be changed to "responsible."(¢ )

Page 6. Discussion of the 1975 review of the 201 file. The draft

seems not to understand what the review was. The form was entitled "Review

‘of 201 file on U.S. Citizen," being a form employed in a review conducted

in 1975 of all 201 files involving U.S. citizens to determine whether
they should be destroyed or whether they could be retained because of
counter-intelligence interests. This file was categorized for retention
because he was’a subject of possible interest in the assassination
investigation. The date 1975, apparently questioned by the editor, is
correct. @)

Same page, at bottom and commencing over to next page. The
reference to FBI activities re Lopez does not change the reservations about
publishing his name. That the FBI did conduct an extensive
investigation of the man's ‘background in the U.S. is quite clear, even if
the reporting basts for an investigation was dubtous.CU )

would permit eventual identification of Lopez. CC )

Page 10. The-comment.at the bottom of this page, describing as 7 |
“egregious” CIA's not reporting the.man to the Warren Commission,
represents a misunderstanding of the handling of reports, as well as the |
relationships during.the investigation. The report that might be seen
by some as suggesting that the man had some significance was, on its
face, a very poor report. It was inaccurate in néarly every significant

fact. It is customary for intelligence analysts to evaluate reports

i
on a continuing basis, and the domplaying of this one was--and renains-- ;
@ proper professional judgment. In this case, the report routinely was
forwarded to the FBI, with its primary responsibility for conducting the 1
field investigation. The Bureau did just that. However, the judgment of |

Page 11. The draft report errs in relating the treatment in the CIA
Task Force Report in 1977.. That study pointed out the errors in the Monterrey {

report about Lopez,:and. the bearing that this had on the valuation placed on

the report. The Senate report never did focus on these basic flaws, and

selected those elements of it that fit the working thesis of the staff. The

critical evaluation of the Monterrey report seems valid to this date. The
present Committee draft accepts-the undiscriminating and imprecise treatment ‘
of Book V of the Senate report, :withaut-undertaking consideration of all the
information available. The selected quotation in the Task Force Report should

tbe read in its entire context. (x)

Page 13. Reference to a Mexican police source should be deleted. (c)

Page 13. The HSCA may feel there are sinister implications on this .
matter, but that is:based:on:the ‘interpretations of the Committee ahd not on
the facts.CU )

Same page. Observations about "documented instances where the CIA
decided to forego passing information...out of a desire to not lay bare
extremely sensitive sources of intelligence...." reflect an attitude on
the part of the staff investigators that may be shared by the Committee.
However, it is doubted that.a.good case can be made for this. For instance,
an attempt was made to so describe reporting on telephone conversations,
based on a memorandum by. Mr. Slawson in April 1964. It was clear that the

substance was reported, if the source--as distinguished from the information--

* was not disclosed on the record. We provided you with information showing ~”

that Mr. Helms discussed this with Mr. Rankin in mid-January 1964 and that
the basic information was provided a couple of weeks later, still in January.
‘A perusal of that correspondence indicates that Mr. Rankin knew the source
as well as the information, in it.. The erroneous Slawson memorandum appears
to be the main “documentation” for the statement in the draft. In any event
it is customary in intelligence reporting to provide the information with a

source evaluation, without specifying the surcd, (5)

In the present case, the Monterrey report was a very suspect, on its face.

It.was passed to the FBI for inquiry, which seems to haveconcluded in

demonstrating just that. C¢)

a real problem, it would have been worked out. That the Bureau did not
complete its investigation until too late in the scheme of things to report to
the Warren Commission can mean no more than that. It did the investigation and
that cleared up the matter for purposes of responsible and mature evaluation. (c )

Oswald, Was He or Was He Not, A CIA Agent?

It is understood that this is intended for unclassified publication,
so comments wil] relate to security and accuracy.

Page 2. ‘The HSCA investigators did not review the "CIA's 144-volume
Oswald file." They did read 68 volumes of the CI Staff Oswald file, but
they did not read@B-others. There were another 87 so-called "bulky" files
not read at CIA, in the CI Staff Oswald file. Of the seven volumes held by
the Office of Security, four were reviewed, and part of a fifth. If FOIA’

available to them. They did not. The amount of unread material-is estimated

constitute the same thing because of sanitization. Whatever was read, i
vas stated it is incorrect..(v) : ;

Page 4. The statement “nor was there always an independent means of
verification that all materials requested by the Agency were, in fact, i
provided," leaves the gratuitous inference that there may have been some
withholding. If files in the Agency were not made available, it simply would
have been because they could not be found in response to the less than
effective way in which some materials were requested. In any event, before
the above statement in the draft can honestly be made, it would have been

necessary for the HSCA investigators to have read all the materials made

variously from one quarter to one third (See above comment as it applies to
the so-called Oswald file). Cu) ;
Page 5.. The reference to “institutional obstacles," must be stated
in the context of security standards. Once the Committee accepted the
Agency's standards ‘the only remaining problem was one of relevance
(under the agreement between Chairman Stokes and the DCI), and the ability of
the HSCA investigators to explain what they wanted. CU )
Same page. It would be appreciated if the report did not state that
"the vast majority of CIA files made available ...were reviewed in unsanitized
form." While the majority of the files:made available were reviewed, and the
great majority of these were unsanitized, we would prefer not to have it
advertised, even if it contributed to the.credibility of the Committee's report.(C

only if not in behalf of the Agency. The HSCA investigators have had it
explained to them’ in’so many -ways ‘that ‘a-variety of cross checks and controls,

administrative, financtal and operational, work against such a development. Cu )

NOTE: Although the legal traveler program is inactive at

present, it would be preferred that no mention be made to it,

as it may be reinstituted at some point in the future. It is

an operational technique that. should not be publicized. It would

be preferred if it were simply stated that none of those going to

the Soviet Union, whose cooperation was requested, made contact

with Oswald. Ce)

Page 10, ff. It seems that Wilcott hardly merits the space devoted
‘to his allegations. The man essentially is discredited, and to satisfy his
propaganda ains ‘is questionable. In any event, his location in Japan reveals
a post that has not been acknowledged by the U.S. or the Japanese governments.
It provides the opportunity to have Wilcott speak with apparent authority
sand credibility as to his work, even having <> “unknowingly. disbursed
“payments for Oswald's project using that cryptonym." How he could have, in
the first place, having arrived after Oswald left Japan, is dubious (a fact
not noted in the draft). But the allegation of operational disbursements
there could prove troublesome in a number of ways. (¢)
Lee Harvey Oswald's CIA File (page 15 ff.)
Page 7. The file was opened "purportedly" because of counterintelligence

consideration. This has been :belabored elsewhere in the drafts. Yes, he

did meet the criteria for constituting a possible CI threat, so it was



14-00000

permisstble to open a file on him if it-appeared desirable. The Committee
has been advised of the essentially administrative reasons that Joined con-
siderations which led. to the actual opening of the file. ~w )
Why was the file opened...a year after his attempt to defect?

Reiterating explanations given elsewhere, there was no requirement
to open a file. The judgment of the officer in question controlled. (u)

Page & Top of page. While the cable could provide a proper
basis for opening a file, if there was reason for doing sc, in the absence
of a requirement to do so, it was also quite proper to have decided not to
do so. It tends to become a matter of a proper judgment then, against what a
‘novitiate might think 20 years later, when the subject had killed the
President. The basic consideration is that there was no requirement to
open files; the administrative objective is to hold down the number of 201 +
files. There had to be a. reason. as well as there being information
meeting the ériteria that constituted a threshhold for whether one was’ even
permitted to open such a file. (See comments on draft at pages 2000589-2000590,

The_letters "AG" on the opening sheet of the Oswald 201 file
Page 26 ff. The draft emphasizes the memory of the witness (a man with
quite a good memory on some things). Unfortunately, his memory plays him tricks
on the institution of the "AG" symbols. Agency records show that it was
“in use prior to the assassination of President Kennedy. Perhaps the witness
recalls learning of it during the investigation and now believes that it was
developed then, but the records show him to be in error. The problem with
this subject is that the investigators sought ppansiers from people years
after ‘the fact rather than asking officially; when they finally did the answer
was readily available. The lost time is recorded in the long treatment of
a non-issue. C2)

Was There a Dual Filing System on Oswald?

Page 33. What the Committee "was aware of from its outset" about a
dual filing system, betrays a.preconception rather than a fact. “This

vawareness (sic) was heightened into concern” by the rough notes when the

memorandum from me dated 27 September 1978. quy

ZRRIFLE program was in a planning stage. That someone considered such a
thing--and clearly did not employ ‘it--only suggests that such ‘a thing was
considered and not carried out. .It does not mean that it could have
been done successfully. A reference file has to be held in the central
filing system, avd ‘it will tell where the full file is. There can be no
official operation without a record file. The key consideration, if
evidence is of any concern to the Committee, is not that Harvey thought
about, but that he did not do it. Why? Probably because he could not,

A lot is draped over this unexecuted study, and extrapolative speculation

ccovers the lack of supporting evidence. This has been the subject of a previous

is made to “an Agency relationship with the CIA." The context is not clear
enough to reveal what is intended. Cu)

Page 460 It is not at all clear why reference to someone in a
CIA file would "raise a question of whether Lee Harvey Oswald was, in
fact, involved in some sort of CI project." Depends on who is looking at
files they don't understand. -Having asked the question, one must assume
there 1s a compulsion to write about it.)
