Mr. Hunt's quarters allowance is $2,900.

Using

the same.formula as applied to the other staff employees

at the Station, the following would be

the figures:

$2,900 + 60% ($1,710) = $4,640

On a 50/50 percent

sharing basis of the 60 percent, he

would be out-of-pocket $870 11 his costs were $1, 610.

On a 75/25 percent sharing basis of the 60 percent, he

would be out-of-pocket $135, 1f his costs were $4, 640.

I would recommend he be authorized the 75/25 per-

cent sharing basis of the

allowable excess costs up to,

but not to exceed, 50 percent above his quarters allowance..
