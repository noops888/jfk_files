b. This is an earnest of the
desire of moderate Baathist leaders
in Damascus to preserve workable re-
lations with Iraq, partly as a
counterbalance to Cairo and partly
to preserve what remains of Baathist
influence in Baghdad.

a. Prime Minister Inonu's
coalition government is about to
collapse. .

b. It has long been shaky.
Last week it was dealt a severe set-
back when the opposition Justice
Party, heir of the Menderes regime,
emerged from local elections as the
country's majority party.

c. Now the Peasant Party, one
of the three in the coalition, has
voted to pull out, and probably will
do so as soon as Inonu gets back from
Washington, Another partner, the

= Party. has wanted to pull out

d. A new coalition is at least
a theoretical possibility, with a
number of independents taking the
place of the Peasant Party, but
Inonu probably would not be prime
minister,

e. The military are working
for an all-party coalition. This
way, they feel, they could keep
tabs on the Justice Party, but the
Justice Party is not likely to buy
this arrangement.

f. As matters now stand, the
military would take over the govern-
ment itself before it would let the
Justice Party form one.

a.

| |the decision to buy wheat abroad
was taken to avoid lowering reserves,
which he has described as ample for
one or two years. We think the sit-
uation is more serious than that.

b. This year's harvest was
clearly very bad. The weight of
evidence suggests that Soviet grain
stockpiles have been far drawn down
this year and are not sufficient to
protect the country from another
poor harvest.

ce. Our estimate is that total
grain production each year since
1958 has been well below that year's
level of 125 million tons, while
the population has continued to grow.

d. We have seen
signs of extensive slaughtering in
anticipation of fodder shortages
during the winter. This runs counter
to Khrushchev's oft-stated plan to
build up the livestock industry.

e. We have also noted that
the extensive wheat purchases weaken
the USSR's gold reserves at a time
when it hopes to expand its imports
of machinery for a huge chemical
fertilizer program,

f. In addition,we have seen
signs of stringent measures to pro-
tect the grain supply, accompanied
by public discontent in some areas
over the absence of bread.

a. Peiping last week con-
tracted for some 300,000 tons of
wheat. (cost about $20,000,000) from
Argentina.

b. This adds to the 1,000,000
tons just contracted for with Aus-
tralia, but is still far below
the 5,000,000 tons the Chinese have
normally imported in recent years.
Additional suppliers will be hard
to find.

Czechoslovakia-—

Cambodia

a. Czech President and party
boss Novotny has gone to Moscow,
evidently for economic talks, judg-
ing by the composition of his dele-
gation.

b. Novotny's background of
Stalinist excesses have put him on
the wrong side of Khrushchev. They
also have given rise to control
problems, particularly in the frac-
tious Slovak party where pressures
for liberalization have made their
mark,

c. Party problems and Novotny's
leadership may thus also come under
review.

d. <A curious sign of the times
is the fact that, although President
Novotny is in Moscow, the presidential
flag has remained up at the official
residence. It might simply have been
an oversight, but the symbolism will
not be lost to the people in Prague.

a. Cambodia, as expected, has
asked the Geneva co-chairman to call
the Geneva conference participants
together (in Djakarta) to discuss
measures "to ensure the internation-
ally guaranteed and controlled neu-
tralization of Cambodia."

b. Last year when this came
up, the French were inclined to go
along with some such idea,

c. They have indicated to us
that they still feel Sihanouk should
not be turned down, and Sihanouk is
obviously hopeful that they will
exert pressure on us and the British.

d, Sihanouk seems to be hoping
for at least a rump session attended
by conferees who are willing to do
his bidding.

Congo

a. Opposition leftist Congo-
lese exiles, operating from Brazza-
ville across the river, are reported
to be plotting to assassinate Congo-
lese Premier Adoula and some of his
ministers.

d. Adoula's government already
knows. that this group of left-wing
subversives, which now numbers about
50, is being helped by the Communist
bloc.

e. It operates fairly freely
in the loose circumstances which now
obtain in Brazzaville. .Its activities
may soon become a serious source of
friction between the two countries.

F. Cambodia Cambodia is cutting its diplomatic rep-
resentation abroad to a bare minimum as an austerity
measure following curtailment of US aid, Sihanouk
announced last week that this would be done, saying
that missions in Communist countries would not be
affected since those countries "protect" Cambodia,

Curiously enough, among the missions being closed
down are snene in New Delhi and Rangoon,

G. USSR-US Pravda this morning reports on Gromyko's
talks with President Johnson, giving top play to
Senator Fulbright's remarks about the desirability
of a meeting between the President and Khrushchev.
