Purge:

1. The purge of Anibal Escalante Dellunde, Executive

Secretary of the PSP from the position of

in the ORI did not create a "split'

between "new" and "old" communists.

Certainly Aimed at:

8.

Reassuring those 26th of July leaders

who

had fought for the revolution but not for

communism.

b. Putting the brakes on the PSP's grab

for power.

c.

Castigating Escalante for personal

"sectarianism"

E. A New Vlew on Splitting the Regime:

1.. Castro's purgo of Escalante surfaced his

concern for the balance between the non-comnunist

elements of the 26th of July Movement and the

"unaligned" government leader and the PSP - "old"

and "new".

2.. To split Castro from the PSP would be difficult

and of questionable value:.

a. The PSP to gain its final objective would

take any insult and turn the other cheek.

It had embraced Fidel and would not let go

under any circunstances. To rise against

Castro now would not be opportune, and

would probably be fatal.

b.

Fidel was now totally dependent on the

Soviet Union

c.

The only hope was not to split Fidel from

PSP but to identify, at every opportunity,

him and his government-with comnunism, fOr

only the non-communist element of the 26th

of July Movement and the "unaligned leaders

of the government could effectively be

split.

from the government.

d.

This conclusion did not preclude the Task

Force from attempts to create suspicion,

hostility and friction between Castro and

the PSP.

• II. The Direction of Task Force Efforts to Split the Regime:

A. To identify those members of the 26th of July Movement

and other "unaligned" government leaders

who were for

the revolution but against connunism. To date, there

is reasonably good ividence indicating that the

following individuals do not approve of the communist

direction of the Cuban revolution and may in fact

be conspiring against the regime.

1. Major Pedro Miret Prieto, commanding artillery unit

2.

Ambassador Gustavo Arcos y Bergnes

3. Commander Sebastian Arcos, brother of Gustavo rnd

a commander in the Cuban havy. Hns been in Prague

for some time on a training mission

4. Orlando Ventura Reyes

Manuel Carbonell Duque

5.

6.

Major Faustino Perez, former minister charged with

the recovery of stolen properties

NOTE: [Ambassador Gustavo Arcos]is undoubtedly an

important member of this group of potential .con-

TFW has made an unsuccessful but sustained

recruit him in Brussels. lo Despite ou

failure to date, Arcos

remains in close and friendl

contact with Tri sources

Conspiring in Cuba today is dangerous business.

These are

fearful men and neither easily identified

or easily contacted within Cuba.

Each of the above men remain as high priority targets

within.

Our main efforts to contact them take two

directions: (1)

The identification of suitable

internediaries to them, and (2) the eventual use

of internal assets now in place.
