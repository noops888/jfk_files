The Implications to the Power Alignments of Escelante's

1. The purge of Anibal Escalante Dellunde, Executive
Secretary of the PSP from the position of

in the ORI did not create a "split"

Concern for the balance. between the non-communist

elements of the 26th of July Movement and the

“unaligned" government lesder and the PSP - "ola"

Castro now would not be opportune, and
would probably be fatal,

Fidel was now totally dependent on the
Soviet Union

PSP but to identify, at every opportunity,
him and his government.with communism, for
only the non-communist element of the 26th

of July Movement and the "unaligned leaders
