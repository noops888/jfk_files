For

First reactions in the UN after KENNEDY's assassination:

1. A unanimous opinion exists that even in the most favorable cir-
cumstances, East-West relations will deteriorate in the next few months and
may last until elections. KENNEDY's assassination will deepen the break in
the Democratic Party between the North and the South. JOHNSON, weak and subject
to influence, will be forced to concentrate on stopping this process. GOLD-
WATER's position will decline which will increase ROCKEFELLER's chances for the
nomination. The results of the elections for the most part; will depend on
the popularity of the Democratic candidates. Being mentioned are HUMPHREY,
ROBERT [25-50M] and American journalists in talks emphasizé JOHNSON's liberal
past (it is said that he was ROOSEVELT's favorite), and his moderate position
in critical periods during KENNEDY's term. i

30 It is alarming that anti-Communist hysteria has been turned on.

Radio and television continue to broadcast unconfirmed reports that held as a
suspect in the assassination is a man who it is said asked for Soviet citizen-
ship two years ago, has a Russian wife and who recently was an activist in the
(Fair Play for Cuba) pro CASTRO organizations :

American extremists having great influences in the propaganda
apparatus here want at all costs to be divorced from responsibilities for
the attempt. .
