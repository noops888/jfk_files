experienced swimmers, and both familiar with the waters in the
locale, swam to the bottom of the Russian’ship. Both men were
equipped with SCUBA equipment, complete with metal air tanks.

1 of the swimmers carried a mine for placément against the hull
of the ship. As the men neared the ship, the individual with
the mine was suddenly seized by a tremendous: pulling. force,
causing -him-to lose the mine. In, spite of being ‘an excellent,:”
swimmer .and in excellent physical..condition, individual was:'un-

able to break the force pulling him toward the ship. This force.

ie Tek After failure of-attempt to. sink the Russian

ship, the raiding party sought other means of striking the
-enemy... The group noticed an area. lighted by floodlights and
‘found it to be a Russian camp, enclosed by wire fence. The

Russians were having a party, with.music and singing, when
the raiders opened fire. It may be significant that during
the whole period "A 66" gunners were firing into camp, the

” floodlights were not turned off, but remained on to light

targets for the raiders.
