48. (Confidential - DFM) BRIEFING Briefed Bill Miller, Staff
Director, and Earl Eisenhower, Minority Staff Director, Senate Select
Committee on Intelligence, on the 8 November 1977 Presidential finding.

Miller asked why this problem could not be handled overtly, I attempted
to explain this to him but he indicated he was certain the subject would
be raised by the full Committee when the Director briefs them on the
program,

I told Miller the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct had
some problems in pipe the trip of Jocko Richardson, former Chief of cS
Station, (Seoul, soul Korea, to Washington to be interviewed by that Committee
as well as the Senate Select Committee. I asked Miller if the Select Committee
a could do this ina secure manner, Miller said he thought they could and
i : there would be no problem in the Committee paying the expenses, I
told him I would check again and let him know if this was necessary...

Miller said he had talked to Chairman Daniel K. Inouye (D., Hawaii}
about the classified FOIA affidavits which Senator James Abourezk
(D.,; S. Dak.) has requested. Miller said the Chairman's position was estas
that we were not denying Senator Abourezk information, and had suggested ~.:.»
le a@ reasonable means for him to examine the material, i,e., in the Select
: Committee offices. In Senator's Inouye's view, there is no reason for us
to try to be any more accommodating,

I told Miller that General Camm, Director of the National
Intelligence Tasking Center, would like to meet with Select Committee
staffers sometime during the week of 28 November and that we would like -.--
to include staff members of both the Subcommittee on Budget and Authorization
and the Subcommittee on Collection, Production and Quality. Miller
agreed and said that he would set this up and let me know.

Regarding the scheduled briefing on Czechoslovak dissidents,
