UNITED STATES GOVER “ENT

Memorandum

to =: ° MR, BELMONT pate: Cctober 25, 1963
“FROM: c. A. EVANS
SUBJECT: * COMMUNISM AND TH i : :
NEGRO MOVEMENT . : 7

The Attorney General one at’ approximately 10:15 a.m.
He atvised that he had tried to call the Director who was temporarily out of
the building. The Attorney General stated he had just learned that the Army
hhad received a copy of a report submiited to the Aitorney General about the
communist activities of Martin Imther King. The Attorney Gener: sreic.
to the report captioned "Communism and the Negro Movement -- A Current,
Analyses, " dated Cctober 16, 1963. There is no question this is the report-
to which he is referring, although he persisted on calling it the report c on 1 the
Jcommunist background of Martin Luther King.

The Attorney. General said he would like to know what other
dissemination was made of this report in addition to the Army and the purpose’
for‘such dissemination. He was obviously irritated. He went on to.ask if the
‘Army got copies of all reports submitted to him. . I told the Attorney General that
obviously the Army did not get copies of all reports we sent to him personally,
but that there were hundreds of reports that did go to the Army that did not
concern matters of sufficient importance to warrant the Attorney General's personai
attention. I pointed out to him that we regularly submitted some type of reports

lin matters of current interest under our Internal Security jurisdiction. and that
jdissenzinati on of these summaries was made to the military authorities as well
as other top governmental officials because of eae they have in, this
connection. : :
i

The Attorney General asked what ‘responsibilities the Army had in
trelation to the communist background of Martin Luther King. I told the Attorney
!General the report went beyond this and that the Army had an interest in communi st
lactivities particularly in relation to racial matters because the military had to be
tealled'on if civil disturbances arising out of such matters went beyond the ability’
‘of the civilian authorities.

This explanation seemed to serve no purpose.’ The Attorney General
said he still could not understand why we sent a report to the Army on King's
communist activities. He reiterated his request for information as to the dissemins |
tion of the report in question and the purpose for it.

RE: COLIUNIST INFILTRATION OF

U. S, Govern ent are involved, The Atlanta Office has
recommended chat ~ : : be
advised con erning this matter. This appears inadvisable
since such .ction could conceivably cause repercussions which
would only ggravate the racial stuation that exists in the
South.

It is felt that Dr. Leland J, Havorth, Director,
RSF, should be furnished information regarding communist
influences exerted on the SCLC and King. In this regard
we recently disseminated to the White House and the
heads of the intelligence community copies of a "Top Secret"
summary entitled "Communism and the Negro Movenent--A
Curvent Analysis" contains ation regarding the
SCLC aid King. Phis summary deals < nets communist
connections and (technical surveillance information) With the ~~
~ of this summary by Dr. Haworth, the SCLC would

liv he remavad fram the BAY nragram to obtain aualitied

Regro students for southern schools,

The infornation concerning the SCLC participation:
-in the NSF program is being separately disseminated to the
Department and interestod intelligence agencies.

RECOMMENDATION:

There is attached for approval a letter to
Dr. Leland J. Haworth, Director, NSF, transmitting a copy
of the recently prepared summary entitled "Communism and

PURPOSE:

To obtain approval to disseminate monograph
entitled, "Communism and the Negro Movement - A Current
‘ Analysis" to the’ United States Ambassador to Japan,

U. Alexis Johnson, :

BACKGROUND:

On my recent inspection of thé Legal Attache office
in Japan, I met and talked with Ampassador Jvonnson, vuring
our conversation, it was quite apparent that Ambassador
-Johnson was unaware of the communist influence being exerted

"COMMUNISM AND THE NEGRO

You will recall that in December, 1964, with the.
Director's approval and after first checking with the White
i ‘House, we disseminated to the Heads of the intelligence
community a paper’ captioned as above which depicted the
communist influence in the Negro movement. Emphasis was
given in the paper to the communist influences on Martin Luther’
King,Jx., as well as facts relating to his immoral nature.
ad As you are aware, LeRoy Collins, former Governor of
Florida, is Director, Coimunity Relations Service (CRS),
Departinent of Commerce , aud inthis positiuu serves as sumething
of a "mediator" in problems relating to the racial field. He
has been a key individual relative to the situation in Selma,
Alabama. Information of interest to'the CRS is regularly being
.Gisseminated to that agency. Lite just received reliable infor~
mation concerning a conversation between Martin Luther King, Jr.
and his wife, Coretta, during which Coretta made reference to
the Selma situation and said that Collins was blinded by
- prejudice. We have disseminated the information concerning
_ the King conv

It is believed that, in view of Collins important
position relative to the racial movement, he should have

©) CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY (CIA) - DOMESTIC CONTACT
SERVICE -- You previously have been informed regarding CIA’s Contact
Division which has had offices in. various U. S. cities and which is openly
identified as being connécted with CIA. This division has been responsible

- for the overt collection of positive intelligence gained through interviews of
aliens, travelers, businéssmen, etc. The division has not been engaged
in any operational activity such as the development of double agents. For
your information, CIA has reorganized this division and it is now called
the Domestic Contact Service. . ~

An examination of CIA's activities in the area of overt collection
of positive intelligence has indicated that’the Bureau can strengthen its
position by having our field offices’ establish direct contact with the local
offices of the Domestic Contact Service. This particularly applies to those-
situations where the Bureau and CIA both have an interest in Soviet-bloc
and Yugoslav nationals, excluding those who are connected with embassies
or the United Nations. We recognize that CIA has a responsibility for

In each'case when you initiate any inquiry or investigation of a visiting
Soviet-bloc national, you should obtain from the local Domestic Contact

Service the nature and extent of CIA interest and ali pertinent information :

which CIA has gained or may acquire in the future relating to our internal
security responsibilities. If you feel that CIA activity conflicts with
Bureau objectives, you should so advise the Seat-of Government, clearly
setting forth your reasons. In this connection, there may be instances -
where continuing CIA pursuit of positive intelligence would conflict with
the Bureau s discharge of its internal security functions.

UBJECT: RELATIONS WITH CYA . ; iii

a

: Reference is made to my letter of 3/2/70. JI made the
statement, "Unfortunately, CIA also’ believes that in the past
.we did not always act in a forthright manner, and the Agency
undoubtedly could present a list of grievances." It is my
understanding that you want such grievances identified. There
is enclosed herewith a jist of cases ox, situations which arose
over the years,

7 Based upon a review of files and my personal recollectiozr
this list would be representative of matters which CIA could use
for making charges such as: not being forthright, not playing
Yeairly and squarely, not cooperating, not being ot assistance,
not recognizing the need for concrete FBI contributions to the
foreign intelligence effort, What CIA may have compiled over the i
years is unknown, What situations are krown to CIA and have not
come to our attention cannot be answered at this time. I am
thinking of leaks including distorted information which may have
been passed to CIA from ex-~Bureau employees and CIA informants
and sources, —

2

It ‘should be clearly emphasized that there is no
indication whatsoever within CIA that the Agency has been seeking
any kind of a showdown or confrontation with the FBI. Contrary .
to what some people may believé, the relationship between the
twe agencies up to the recent crisis was never better despite
the problems which have arisen from time to time, I am confident
that a thorough and impartial examination will conclusively
‘ support the foregoing. : :

—~—,

In order that there may not” be any misunderstanding, it
is important to emphasize that the Bureau can also produce an
extensive list of justified grievances. We can also produce an’
excellent record of support which we have given CIA; presumably
CIA could do the same, There are ingredients for continuing '

‘ conflict and there is also adequate machinery for maintaining
sound working relations and producing badly. needed intelligence

+" Es RELATIONS e CIA aa e ;
: —

i believe that it would be most helpful to you and
: interested Bureau officials when evaluating and passing judgment
.-»,. On the attached material if we analyzed very briefly the role
“* of the Bureau liaison Agent. A liaison Agent can be a simple
mail courier.or he can be the true Bureau Agent ready to confront
any problem or issue with another ogenhcy, very often working with
very limited information, .It is expected that the Bureau Agent
carry out his ingtructions forcefully and efficiently. He must
be prepared to handle all types of personalities under various
conditions, He must be alert for pitfalls and express himself
adn a most judicious and prudent manner but always making certain
that the Bureau position is well fortified.

In evaluating the attached and my “encounters with CIA,
it should be noted that protests from the Bureau always were
easy to handle because the Agent had J. Edgar Hoover behind hin,
However, when an Agent struck at+an offjcial on one day and
solicited his cooperation the next day; it did require some
resourceful action. It is believed that other liaison Agents
regularly encounter similar situations. On numerous occasions
i-have bitterly feuded with-CIA officials and this las -included
rough language. I have walked out on CIA officials when I felt
they were unreasonable, They took the initiative by asking the
Agent to return, I did try to play fairly and squarely with all
of them and never hesitated to accept a confrontation; this includ:
the Director of the Agency, When I lectured to CIA personnel
over the years I always made a point to challenge them to present
any grievances or raise any subject matter relating to the .
‘Bureau. I never left a discussion with any CIA official without
“being positive that our position was absolutely understood.

The approaches utilized by me might be open to criticism. I

can only refer, to the records of the Bureau.and CIA and I believe
the Bureau's position is most favorable. I don't think CIA has
ever transmitted a letter of protest to the Bureau during the
eighteen years during which the Agent handled the assignment.

‘CASES AND/OR SITUATIONS
INVOLVING CONFLICTS WITH THE i

: ‘CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY (CIA)

(1) MOCASE. (THE BORIS MORROS CASE) .

. This was-a sensitive Soviet-espionage case
which originated in 1943 and terminated for the most
part in 1957. The case had many wide foreign ramifi-
cations and historically has been, and undoubtedly
will be, one of the most important.and involved cases
of Soviet operations in this country and abroad. We
did not disseminate any information of significance
in this case until 1954. On various occasions when
the Liaison Agent has become involved in heated argu~
ments with CIA officials, they havé seen fit to raise
this case as an outstanding example of FBI failure to
cooperate with the Agency, The position taken by CIA
was that it should have been advised regarding the
Soviet operational activity in foreign countries,
claiming that the Agency would have had the opportunity
to develop more information of significance, identify
Soviet agents, and possibly prepare conditions for
recruitment or doubling of Soviet operatives. We did
not disseminate our reports to CIA because of the
extreme sensitivity of the case. We actually did not ;
permit CIA to handle any investigations relating to a
the baat until 1957,

In 1957, CIA ‘complained that it certainly had
every right to have received the information earlier
because many aspects of the MOCASE pertained to CIA
employees and operations. CIA further argued that it
had been greatly handicapped in effectively carrying out
the leads in 1957 because the leads were given to the
Agency at the same time that the case was publicized.
The Agency argued that the failure of the Bureau to
coordinate with CIA those French aspects of the case
permitted the French, rather than the U. S., to play a
dominating role in Europe.

“With regard to dealing with the French, we
took the position that we would cover the leads through
our Legal Attaches wherever possible and to furnish
leads to'CiA in those countries where we did not have
Legal Attaches, CIA maintained that since we were on
record that our Legal Attaches dq not handle operations
abroad, the Bureau had an obligation to levy those French
leads on CIA or,at least. coordinate with the Agency |
before going to.the French,

It is ‘to be noted that in any argument relating
to jurisdiction in this matter, CIA-will fall back on the
responsibilities placed on the Agency under the: provisions
of the National Security Act of 1947 and the implementation
of the foregoing through National Security Council Direc~
tives, CIA will maintain that’ it is-~incumbent upon the

Bureau to recognize the provisions of the National Security
Act of 1947 and the Directives. The Agency would argue
j 3 in the HOCASE, these were ignored by the Bureau.

(3) THE ABEL CASE :
i i Sf

Although CIA has-not raised the-point for
several years, the prevailing attitude was, and probably
still exists, that the FBI did not play it square with
|iee in the Abei case py not making certain that the

Agency was given the proper recognition for its contri-~
butions, CIA feels that in the first place,” there would
not have been any U. S. access or availability to the
source in this case, NAME: . because CIA took
the full responsibility for’moving NAME from PLACE
to the U. S. in 1957. CIA claims it took the risk and
responsibility of doing this after the Bureau declined
{to become involved in any operation designed to transport
“NAME ‘to the.U. S. It should be noted that NAME
.Wwas an alcoholic and that his first contacts with CIA
in /LAce raised questions concerning NA WE mental
tability. 7 .

After NAME arrived in the U. S., we
arranged access to him for a period, the purpose of
which was to obtain a complete story of his intelli-
gence activities in the 'U. S. and we were particularly
interested in identifying all of his associates, es=
‘Jpecially the man who later was identified as Rudolph
bel, After a short handling period in the U. S., we
dropped NAME because he became a-problem, It was.
extremely critical*situation because we had’ not yet _
dentified Abel. CIA agreed to take the responsibility
, for the carrying and safeguarding of NAME but we

were ‘given free-access to this difficult source, ' This

was a moSt fortunate arrangement-as far as‘CIA was con-
cerned, because this adjustment gave us the tine to work
\with NAME ‘and subsequently develop the leads which
“Jled’ to the apprehension of Abel. The Agency has main-
‘)tained that it was largely responsible for making-
absolutely certain that MAME was mentally and
physically prepared for testimony at.the Abel trial.

AME ‘was a.Eey witness. CIA has- also referred to
the heavy expenses incurred by the Agency, all for the
benefit of the Bureau. CIA has complained that the -
Bureau never really thanked the Agency for.its coopera~
tion and CIA has been particularly irked becaused the
Bureau did not see fit to inform the Attorney General ~
jor the White House of the role played by CIA.

c.- . In July, 1953, Senator MAHE ~ sought

5 : erences concerning the matter but charges were never
isha de against the Bureau. What information CIA has on
t is particular item is not known but the Agency did
\ : ow that we maintained liaison with wane Committee,

(8) BUREAU DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION CONCERNING

y : In May, 1954, ‘Allen Dulles Yaised the auestion
concerning the propriety of FBI dissemination of information
‘concerning NAME This information had been fur-

. fmished to us by MANE a former official of the



a . : ret

[Department of Labor. When interviewed by us, “MAME
made-several accusations against CIA. We disseminated
the information to the White House, the Attorney General,
and some data also went to the State Department, Dulles
took theposition that by disseminating derogatory in-
formation concerning his Agency, he had been placed on -
the spot because the | WAME . data was not the
complete story. In the past, CIA informally referred
to this as an ‘instance of very unfair conduct on the part
of the Bureau. : f : :

(6) BUREAU HANDLING OF CIA REQUESTS FOR TOURS
FOR FOREIGN OFFICIALS :

: ,

On occasions in the 1950's,” CIA complained that
officials visiting the U. S. under CIA sponsorship were
given excellent treatment on the tour but, nevertheless,
many. of the visiters left most dissappointed because they
had not had any contact with any Bureau officials. CIA
felt that contact with Bureau officials had very significant
benefits and left lasting favorable impressions because of
the FBI‘s world-wide reputation. CIA also pointed out that

hen foreign visitors had no contact with Bureau officials,
they were left with the suspicion that there was some kind
of friction between the FBI and CIA. In 1956, we had a
clear-cut policy to the effect that tours for such visi-
tors would be of a restrictive nature in that such
visitors would view our facilities normally seen by the
ublic and nothing more, CIA was so informed but
eriodically indicated that our policy prevented the
gency from truly enhancing U. S. interests abroad,

IA never lodged an official complaint.

Tt It should beemphasized that for the past several
;years there would not be any basis for any form cd complaint
.with regard to Bureau treatment of foreign officials coming
'to the U. S. under CIA sponsorship. The personal attention
-}given to such officials hy NANE as and
‘other officials and Supervisors in the Domestic Intelligence
| Division has been outstanding and benefits have accrued to
‘the Bureau, These visitors have gone back to their native

(7) CIA = DUTCH INTEREST IN SOVIET ESPIONAGR- ACTIVITY

In 1965, the. Dutch Internal Security Service
was in the process of investigating individuals in
Holland who allegedly had been engaged in Soviet-espionage
activity. The Dutch wanted to have certain individuals
in the U. S, interviewed and-approached CIA to make
inquiry at the Bureau. At that time,+-our relations
with the Dutch had been practically nonexistent because
the Dutch had failed to honestly deal’ with us in the
ejcase of WAME AMD I DEVYTIFFING DATA who had been -

clandestinely collecting intelligence at the National
Security Agency. When CIA approached us, we-told
‘the Agency that the Dutch could submit their request
through-diplomatic channels. We subsequently told CIA
we would not handle the interviews for the Dutch, We
stuck to our position. CIA.surrendered but felt that
we were impairing their efforts to gather information
soncerning Soviet-espionage activities in Europe.

years of its dealings’ with WAHE - + the Agency had
successfully penetrated the latter's organization and
@llegedly had identified many of ‘the sources. CIA
hinted to the Liaison Agent that it had become aware
of the relationship between MAME * organization
and the Bureau. How much CJA really learned about
this relationship is not known but if its penetrations
Were significant, the Agency may have developed evidence
to justify a charge that the Bureau had withheld infor-
mation from CIA, particularly when we were receiving
the data from an organization which, was financed by

(10) INTERNAL SECURITY LEADS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES

" puring the 1950's, we gave our Legal Attaches
numerous leads stemming from internal security cases in
the U. S.. In many instances we did not see fit to
notify CIA although the Agency always maintained that
you could not separate “internal Security" from "counter-
intelligence,"“namely a lead in France pertaining to a
communist in the U. §. warranted advising CIA, if not,
at least asking the Agericy to handlé the lead, In the
last several years, it is not believed that there is
any basis for complaint since we have regularly been

:notifying CIA concerning subjects of cases’ who travel
abroad, If the Legal Attache is investigating, CIA is
notified in order to avoid duplicate efforts, There
have been exceptions where we have taken the position
that CIA should not be notified betause of the sensitivity
of the matter. How many such ‘exceptions are known to
CIA cannot be established from our files; however, we
should besr in mind that.when our Legal Attaches inves-. .
tigate, they contact many of the same foreign officials
normally contacted by CIA, How many of these foreign
officials are CIA informants,or on the Agency payroll,

ds unknown,

(11) BUREAU OPERATIONS IN CUBA

: We operated informants in Cuba when we had a
Legal Attache's Office in Havana, Informants reported
on activities of communists and other subversives in
that country. During the period we operated these
informants, we did not coordinate our operations with
CIA, We did not advise the Agency that we had such
sources, However, in 1960, after Castro’. came on the
scene, it became infeasible to handle certain informants
in a secure manner, Approval was granted to turn certain
informants over to CIA.. What these informants may have
subsequently told CIA about past Bureau operations is
unknown. This item is being cited in the event CIA had
evidence to establish that we had been operational in
Cuba and had not coordinated with the Agency pursuant
to Directives.

(12) BUREAU OPERATIONS IN BRAZIL -

?
| : An YEAR the U. S. Ambassador in Brazil accused
our Legal’ Attache of engaging in uncoordinated covert

intelligence activity “of a nature which I believe
exceedS his terms of reference." The Ambassador further
indicated that. CIA was unhappy over -the Legal Attache's
activities and the Agency allegedly had told the Ambassador
that the Legal Attache had disseminated information from
& source who was a fabricator or a provocator. This
situation arose as a result of the Legal Attaches
operation of an informant in Brazil; Some of the
information that he received from the informant was
of a derogatory nature and related to a Brazilian who
was being touted as a Presidential-candidate, CIA

. asked for the identity of the ‘informant and we told
the Agency that the person could not be identified
because he did not wish that his identity be disclosed,
This case is being cited because_CIA may have evidence
that we had been operational in Brazil, had not coordi-
nated pursuant to Directives, and that the matter was
further aggravated because of the alleged unreliability 7
of the information.

(16) CASE OF WAME -

On July 9, “ré4"_ an official of the State -
Department -confidentially advised the Bureau that

: MVAME : a CIA employee in feacs , had been
involved in an affair with a ropeeyv girl. According
to NAB . allegedly had furnished information
to the nt girl. We checked with the State Department
and CIA and we confirmed MARE : : involved in-
an affair and that he had beeh. recalled. According to
: CIA and State Department, there was no indication that
else involved in any espionage against the
U. S. CIA gave consideration to requesting the Bureau

to identify its source and then changed its wind. -
Whether CIA has documented this as an instance where
the Bureau failed to cooperate by not voluntéering the
source is a matter of conjecture but, it is a case that
should be kept in mind, Hh !

determined that the Legal Attache had made inquiries in
PLACE in response to leads which had been sent from Bureau
‘Headquarters, This matter is being highlighted because
it'was a vitally important operation to CIA and the Agency
‘had received indications that information had been leaked
to Foreé’ authorities, We have no evidence or reason to
believe that the Legal Attache Office ever involved itself
in any such iéak. However, Wé should not, under any cir-
cumstances, discount the fact that CIA has penetrated

_ FeREIGY services and has had access, to sensitive information

ability of tapping phones and installing microphones in

acquired by the Fsfé/6y/ through clandestine coverage. CIA
possibly could charge us with handling” their sensitive
_information in an insecure manner by ‘fransmitting it to
"PLAGE without conferring with the Agency.

: In connection with alleged Forerew espionage
activity in the U, S., CIA has never been satisfied with

the efforts made by the Bureau, The Agency possibly could

take the position that we looked lightly at the allegations
and did not pursue a matter which, in their eyes, merited
@ more aggressive approach,

sues : _For some time, cra has held toa position that

the ‘FoRE(¢/ Intelligence Service VAME _is penetrated by _
the Soviets. The Agency has pointed out that if the £oRE/Gw,
are collecting sensitive information in the U. S., the
product is“ending up in Moscow. - In January, 1964, we
reviewed the status of our investigation of Foré:euv intel-
ligence activities in the U. S. The Director commented

"J think this whole thing has been imaginary on the part

of CIA which has been played as a sucker by MAME

I would waste no more time on it at least until all CIA
restrictions are removed." CIA did impose restrictions

by not permitting us to. pursue certain leads because it
feared that its sensitive source would be jeopardized,

‘In April, 1959, CIA became concerned over the
appearance of certain items in issues of the "National

an. unidentified individual.who was making derogatory
references to CIA, CIA subsequently identified the

(19) TRAVEL OF BUREAU INFORMANTS TO CUBA

In September, 1965, we received information
indicating that oneof our informants on the Mexican border
was in @ position to travel- to Cuba, A question was raised
concerning CIA interest in this matter, if the informant
made the trip, It was recommended and approved that we
not advise CIA concerning the identity of the informant
or his trip to Cuba.

aasataat It is not known if CIA acquired any knowledge
but, if the Agency did, we potentially are vulnerable.
The Agency could charge that. we were operating outside
of the U. S. and we failed to coordinate with the Agency.

(20) DISSEMINATION OF CIA INFORMATION IN A BUREAU MONOGRAPH
By letter dated May 5, 1965, we disseminated to
interested agencies, including CIA, a copy of a monograph-
entitled "Communism in the Dominican Republic." The mono
graph contained considerable information which had emanated

NW 65360 Docld:32989718 Page 120 i Sseeancuene

le


“from.CIA.. We did not obtain clearance from CIA for
the inclusion ofthis information in our monograph.
Clearance approval was not obtained because of the
urgency of the document, CIA was irritated because
it considered our action a distinct violation of the
third agency rule. The Agency never made any protest.

(21) BUREAU INFORMANTS IN —PupLé

In 1966,and 1967, we were operating informants
in face . At the inception of our operational ac~
tivity, CIA was not informed. In one case, we finally
were able to effect the necessary arrangements with CIA
whereby the Bureau would be permitted to run the informant
in PsaAce . In the second instance, we established an
agreement with CIA in October,” 1967, "that we could con-
tinue handling an informant in Peace . with the under-
standing that the Bureau Agent, on the occasion of each
visit, would confer with the local CIA office on political
information collected trom the intormant. ‘ihese two cases
had all the makings of a conflict, CIA was ynder the
definite impression that we had been running these
informants before we had finally coordinated with them,

It is true that the CIA Chief in fP4ACE was much
incensed but no issue was made at CIA Headquarters and
themtter was put to rest.

“CIA may have developed concrete evidence that
we were operating in Pace bearing in mind that in
& plage such as PLACE _y it would not be difficult
for a CIA intelligence officer to spot an. FBI Agent in
contact with Fofecvers . Our potential vulnerability is
that we were operating in Ptece without coordinating
with CIA,

_infermation cencerning the Agency's covert operations,
‘We told CIA that we would not check the toll-calls, We
explained that on the basis of the information received,
there was not sufficient information to justify investigation
falling within theBureau's jurisdiction, CIA accepted
our response but there is fo doubt that thAgency

.In January, 1960, our Legal Attache,
trayeled to Holland for the purpose of exploring arrange~
ments for liaison with appropriate Dutch authorities.

NAHE - raised questions, pointing out that over
the years, all relations with the Dutch authorities had
been handled through CIA. He indicated that before there
was any change in procedure, it would be necessary for
CIA and FBI’ to come to some form of an agreement. Allen
Dulles subsequently expressed disappointment in that his
Agency had not been contacted by the Bureau prior to
exploring the liaison arrangement. We eventually conferred
with CIA and came to an agreement satisfactory to all
parties concerned,” “ ar

Again, CIA could cite this as an instance where
we failed to coordinate with the Agency in line with
National Security Council Directives.

In the latter part of 1959 we gave consideration to
establishing a Legal Attache in Copenhagen, Denmark. The
purpose of the assignment was to follow Bureau leads in
Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Holland, We did not inforn
CIA of our intentions,

obligation of coordinating with the Agency.

(28) COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES — AFRICA ; b

In April, 1960, CIA inquired if the Bureau would
give any consideration to assisting the Agency toward
developing coverage in Africa. CIA was looking for the
services of any Negro informant who might be available,
The Agency also inquired about placing a Negro in the
Communist Party, USA, under a plan which would have us
an eventual objective, the sending of the informant to

NW 65360 Docid:32989718 Page 124 HMNTttahd seusees cJesusgercuagu



‘Africa under an appropriate cover and for an extended
period. We told CIA we had no informants available
because they were necessary for our own operations. We
took the position that we saw no benefit to be gained by
loaning an informant on a short or long term basis.

. This item is. being mentioned because Africa
.has become vitally important to U. S..interest, bearing
in mind that both the Soviets and Chinese Communists have
made significant inroads into the area, CIA could argue
that as early as 1960, it had the foresight tc recognize ~
the need for additional coverage, that it appealed to the
Bureau for assistance, and that we did not cooperate,

In a portion of’ our communication, we attributed cer-
* tain-information to McCone, then Director of CIA, He
charged that the information attributed to him was not

could prove it. The actual fact was that ‘the information
- relating .to McCone had been given .to us by one of his
subordinates who had indicated that the information:
originated with McCone., McCone maintained that we
should have checked with him before we went on record
that any information had. originated with him. The

to alleged Soviet penetrations of CIA, WAHE was

interviewed in detail concerning these allegations. By
letter dated February 26, 1965, we officially advised CIA
that there appeared to be no basis at this time for a
full investigation of the individuals involved.
There are officials in CIA who continue to be
seriously concerned about possible penetrations of the
‘ Agency and have not ahaa WAHE'S allegations,

: We. do not have aay reason to believe that CIA
has developed any substantive evidence to support WAME'S
allegations. If it does, we could be vulnerable and could.
be charged that we did not cooperate and conduct the
necessary investigation in 1965,

CIA has never been able to understand why.the
Bureau will not permit CIA personnel to lecture at Bureau
schools or training courses, CIA has felt that through
@ careful selection of lecturers, the Agency could make
@ very valuable contribution both to the Bureau and to
CIA. The Agency has indicated that its participdtion in
some of our courses would give the Agency the opportunity
te deseribe CIA's crganization, objectives, and opcraticna
problems, Furthermore, it has been expressed that Bureau
personnel could be given the opportunity to pose questions
and there would be a far better over-all orientation on
the part of our people,

The Liaison Agent: has ‘always resisted CIA's
request, It has been a delicate matter to handle because
Bureau personnel have lectured to hundreds of CIA employees,

Although CIA has never officially made an issue
of the matter, the Agency has not been happy about our
attitude concerning exchange of information in the training

field, When the matter has been broughtup for any discussion ..

by CIA, the Agency has been discouraged, CIA informally has
expressed the feeling that an exchange along certain guide~
- lines could be most useful to the U. 8S, intelligence and
Anternal security effort.

(87) POSITIVE INTELLIGENCE

This is an area where discussion with CIA
officials can rapidly generate criticism of the Bureau
for failure to cooperate and offer the necessary assis-
tance. Positive intelligence, briefly, is that information
which might assist the U. S. Government in formulating
foreign policy.. Much of it is of'a ‘political nature and
a@ vital portion-pertains to scientific developments, military
capabilities offoreign countries, and intentions of foreign
countries. Positive intelligence is not only important
as it concerns the communist-bloc countries but also
the non-bloc nations.

There never has been, any ‘lav, Directive, or
Exectttive Order which has fixed the esponsibilities for |
the clandestine collection of positive intelligence in
the U. S. The Bureau does have a responsibility which
we refer to as internal security and vhich falls into the
accepted area of counterintelligence. We do investigate
‘subversives spys, and we develop penetrations of foreign
intelligence services, Our work in the positive intelli-
gence field, for the most part, has been restricted to
the compliance of requests imposed upon us by the State
Department, usually when a political erisds occurs in
some country.

: :CIA has maintained that there is a tremendous
unexplored field for expanded acquirenent of positive
intelligence in the U. S. This would mean vastly increased

‘ technical surveillance coverage, development of informants,
and collection of cryptographic material. CIA does not
feel that we have aggressively moved on this particular
subject and that over the years, the Agency has been
thwarted in its attempts to do much about the problem.

In’ DATE , CIA requested the Bureau to
- install technical surveillances at the offices and temporary
residences of two FoRE/¢#/ Government officials visiting the
U. S. Pursuant to instructions, CIA vas told to seek the
authority of the Attorney General. The Director stated
that he did not want CIA utilizing FBI as a channel.

transmittal of scientific intelligence data to the
". POREKY Intelligence Service. We declined to reinstitute
the coverage, CIA considered the matter important because
of its relationship to the PLACE :

On October 21, 1969, we told CIA that future
requests from.CIA fon technical surveillance coverage
should be transmitted by the Agency directly to the

. Attorney General.
CIA has never made any official comment or
protest but it has considered the afore-mentioned action
by the Bureau as unfriendly and uncooperative. The Agency
has looked to the Bureau “as the lggical point of contact and
as the only organization having the resources and capabilities
. of adequately determining if such coverage is even feasible,

" (88) MISCELLANEOUS ITENS

The Liaison Agent: recalls fragments of other
situations or conflicts which occured over the years and
which resulted in the voicingof CIA displeasure or criticism..
The Agent cannot recall the names of the cases which is

. mecessary to acquire the required data. There was one
+ Anstance early in the 1950's which involved information
7 received from a source of unknown reliability charging
‘Allen Dulles with having been a communist and a spy while
in Europe... We disseminated the information to several .
. agencies. Dulles exploded but never lodged a protest.

The Agent also has recollection of instances when
CIA alleged that its source or informant was compromised by
Bureau revelation of CIA information during the course of
interviews conducted by us, Technically, this would be a
violation of the third agency rule and, if CIA had hard
_ Core facts, we would be vulnerable, particularly if an
amportant informant was lost. CIA never made any official
issue or protest.

: There also have been instances, but cases
“cannot be recalled, where we included CIA information

in Bureau reports but CIA had requested that the information

“investigation" means systematic and direct inquiries or
procedures (such as physical or technical surveillances

concerning an individual's activities or background;
“investigation” does not include the acceptance or the
development of information through social contacts or

‘ Honorable Richard Helms .
Director
Central Intelligence Agency
Washington, D. C.

Dear Mr. Helms:

As I am sure you will agree, the need Ao z close
coordination of Eg cel Lizenc- gathering angiSéuater-
“Intelligence efforts of the FBI and the Centraf ‘intelligence
cy (CIA) is self-evident. This matter is one which
¥Fequires a continuing analysis to assure that both agencies
have established working agreements whereby we can most
-effectively realize positive results with a minimum of
duplication, misplaced effort, and jurisdictional problems.

During January, 1966, representatives of this

Bureau met with officials of ‘the CIA to consider coordina-
tion of our mutual efforts in the collection of positive
intelligence in the United States. As a result of these
conferences, a set of ground rules was drawn up and agreed
to by both agencies. A copy of this agreement was transmitted
_in my letter of February 7, 1966, to then CIA Director
Vice Admiral William F. Reborn, Jr. A copy of the agreement
is enclosed for your information. This agreement has proven.
generally effective and no major problems have been
sencountered since its adoption in the areas it covers.

©... The FBI has primary responsibility with regard to
matters involving the internal security of the United States
as well as for conducting counterintelligance operations in

this country, While this Bureau does not have any statutory
responsibilities with regard to the collection of foreign
intelligence, I have always recognized that the potential

- for the development of such intelligence in this country is
considerable. The FBI has, in fact, made a concerted effort
to obtain positive intelligence of value to other U. S.
+dntelligence agencies, intluding the CIA, and policy-making
officials of the Government. While these efforts, have,

of course, been incidental to our main internal security
and counterintelligence responsibilities, wa have on a
selective -basis developed sources, both live and technical,
providing coverage at key foreign establishments in the
United States. The product of this coverage has been furnished
on & regular basis to the CIA and other interested agencies

a3 OE
and officials of the GovVernmeni.

I know that you will share my belief that this
. Matter requires a periodic reexamination to assure that the
netional security interests continue-to be served in the
most effective and complete manner possible. After reviewing -
. this matter, including the attached 1966 agreement, I“would
welcome any observations you may desire to make.

Sincerely yours, —
_ 3. Edgar Hoover
