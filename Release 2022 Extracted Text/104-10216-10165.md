–ùM..NW E.171-51

SECRET

15 June 1964

MEMORINDUM POR THE RECORD

SUBJECT:

COVER LETTERS FOR SH TO AND FROM AMLASH/1

DISCUSSION BETWEEN NESTOR SANCHEZ (ALIAS NICHOLAS SANSON)

WITH AM.HIF/1

1. Ernestina (Ene) ACOSTA (recipient in Havana for letters

tO AMLISH/1)

AGE: Approx. 35, single, pharmacist, lives part time

with her family in

emedios and part time in llavana.

2. Ernestina and Sylvia Vilarello (AMWHIP/l's mistress) are

good friends and have corresponded in the past. AMLASH/1 was

alerted in Msg. 41, 15 June 1964 to expect SW in letters from

AMVHIP/1 and from Sylvia to Ene. When Sylvia writes a cover letter

in the future, it will be necessary to use a return address from

Madrid and inform Ene and AMLASH/1 in the SW that Ene should write

to Sylvia at that address in Madrid.

3. When AMWHIP/1 writes to AMLASH/1, he will use as a return

address the Cavaliere Hilton Jewelry Shop, Rome. In the SW, we

will ask AMLASH/1 to write to the Rome address. If the pattern

continues, we can expect the majority of the letters with SW from

AMLASH/1 to be hand-carried by friends traveling to Europe.
