Re:

Status of CIA Responses to Assassination Records Review Board's Requests for

Additional Information and Records

Dear John:

I am writing to follow-up on our telephone call earlier today and to convey my serious

concern about the status of CIA's responses to the Review Board's requests for

additional information and records. Although CIA has completed its responses to

several requests, and many others have been answered in part, a significant number of

requests have not been answered - including some that were made more than two

years ago. On many occasions we have been assured that responses would be

forthcoming, only to have promised dates come and go without answers. It is now

extremely important that these requests be answered promptly so that we may conduct

a proper follow-up if necessary. The issues that we can now identify as being of the

highest priority are identified in the text below by double asterisks (**)' and we request

that they be answered within the next month.. We request that the remaining requests

be answered by April 1, 1998.

The remainder of this letter is divided into two parts: first, a listing of the formal

requests for information and records, and second, a listing of the informal requests for

information and records. Please let me know if your understanding of any of the

following points differs from ours so that we can resolve any potential discrepancies.

'As identified more fully below, the issues are: CIA-1 Organizational Material,

CIA-6 Cables and Dispatches, CIA-13 Backchannel Communications, CIA-IR-03

HTLINGUAL Documents, CLA-IR-04 Disposition of Angleton Files, CIA-IR-07 Claude

Barnes Capehart, CIA-IR-15 Electronic "take" from Mexico City, CIA-IR-21 DRE

Monthly Operational Reports, CIA-IR-22 "A" Files on Clay Shaw and Jim Garrison.

BOARD MEMBERS: John R. Tunheim, Chair • Henry F. Graff • Kermir 1. Hall • William L. Joyce • Anna K. Nelson

request. Once the formal statement documenting this search and its results is

provided, this request will be complete.

CIA-IR-27 Security Files for Five Individuals.

The ARRB staff has reviewed Office of Security files for Richard Case Nagel,

Gordon Novel, Jack Ruby, Harold Weisburg, and Walter Sheridan. The entire

files for Gordon Novel, Jack Ruby, and Richard Case Nagel have been designated

assassination records. Portions of the files for Harold Weisberg and Walter

Sheridan will be designated assassination records. The Novel, Ruby, and Nagel

files should be sent to HRG for processing. The Weisberg and Sheridan files

should be sent to HIRG for ARRB review.

CIA-IR-28 McCone Files.

In August 1997, the ARRB staff reviewed an index for the files of former DCI

John McCone and identified some files to be reviewed for assassination records.

A meeting should be set up to examine these files.

CIA-IR-29 Oswald Lewinter.

In November 1997, CLA provided a preliminary oral response to whether it has

files on Mr. Oswald Lewinter. CIA should document its findings in writing.

Once formal documentation of the completed searches has been provided, the

request is complete.

CIA-IR-30 Cherepanov Papers.

In the fall of 1963, Paul Garbler, Chief of Station Moscow, copied a series of KGB

papers from the American Department of the KGB's Second Directorate which

had arrived at the embassy from Aleksandr Cherepanov. The Review Board

requests to review these papers.

CIA-IR-31 Dulles Calendar.

In testimony before the Church Committee on May 4, 1977, Richard Bissell made

reference to the existence of a calendar for former DCI Allen Dulles which would

reflect all of Dulles' meetings. The Review Board requests the Dulles calendar

for January 1959 through his resignation as DCI on November 29, 1961.

eventual release to the AARB. Volume V, the missing volume was never found and the conclusion

was that it either never existed and there was a numbering error or that the material from that

volume was incorporated into the other volumes.

2. (AIUO) If we send copies of the files on Nagell, Novel and Ruby to J. Barry Harrelson,

Barry's office will be responsible for determining what may be released to the AARB, and as

appropriate referring third party documents to the originating agency. He will coordinate with us

prior to releasing the files to the AARB.
