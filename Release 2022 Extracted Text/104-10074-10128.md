by their sister Julia, in 1960, to have had long association

Vicent ALOI (No Station Traces).

2, Station is aware that although LEAL's contacts make him
a possibly interesting target, he will be a difficult and wary
one. However, we are encouraged that we are right on target
in trying to get closer to him by LNYAPA's confirmation of h
associates and their obvious connection with drug trafficking.

3. Please see paragraph 6 of Reference B, which requests
that a copy of Subject's 201 file be forwarded to us along with
any results you may have from a covert name check, Upon receipt
Headquarter's approval of DAMOTA's approach to Subject in Santo
ingo, DAMOTA will provide addressees with his itinerary
