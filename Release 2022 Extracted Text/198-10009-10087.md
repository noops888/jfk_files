implementation to member governments within the next
several weeks.

b. Consulted our Ambassador in Mexico concerning the
possibility of institution by that country of adminis—
trative procedures to delay, or otherwise make difficult,
the carrying of passengers to Cuba. The Ambassador, nas
reported that essentially all feasible control measures,
short of discontinuing Cubana flights, are being taken

i) py the Mexican government.

ec. Determined that Mexico is now requiring that visas
for Cuba be placed securely in passports of all travelers
departing for that country, and is stamping passports to |
indicate that a person has departed or arrived from Cuba. i

manifests of all carriers departing for or arriving
from Cuba to Latin American countries which request them.

e. Forwarded a memorandum to the President recom-
mending that we seek action in the Council of the j
Organization of American States to prohibit Latin American 4
ships from serving Cuba and to prohibit member countries ;

subversive activities to include development of action

ration of background: material for the U.S. delegates,

h. Informed Venezuela, Colombia, Jamaica, Trinidad
and the Dominican Republic of plans to consult with
Isthmian countries at the San Jose Conference in regard
to increasing the Caribbean surveillance effort with U.S,
training and material support, and stated U.S. willing-
ness to provide similar assistance to the countries
addressed. Replies from Trinidad and Venezuela have been
negative. Other countries have not yet responded.

2. The Department of Defense has:

a. Continued U.S, air and sea surveillance of the area
surrounding Cuba.

b. Continued the improvement of communications in °
Latin America by: (1) installation of a multi-channel
radio station in Costa Rica, (2) continuing work on a
similar facility in Nicaragua, (3) continuing negotia-
tions for installation of military radio facilities in
Honduras, Colombia and Ecuador, (4) commencing installa-
tion of a submarine cable between Fort Sherman, Canal
Zone, and Jamaica, to be completed about 1 April, (5)
leasing six channels in this cable for communication
between the U.S. and the Canal Zone, and (6) making minor
improvements in radio facilities previously installed
in Bolivia and Guatemala.

ce. Initiated a study, to be completed during the first
week in April, on the feasibility and desirability of
establishing intelligence centers at Caribbean Command
and Caribbean Sea Frontier Headquarters for rapid pro-
cessing and dissemination to countries concerned, via
the American Ambassadors, of the intelligence on the
movement of subversives.

d. Directed establishment of a U.S, military alerting
system for the Caribbean area, by which intelligence on
subversive movement can be rapidly transmitted to United
States Ambassadors in countries concerned. CINCARIB
has sufficient communication facilities to initiate the
tem, and improvement of these facilities is continu-

>. Intensified efforts throughout Latin America to
discourage travel to Cuba. Progress in each country is
summarized as follows:

Station has urged the local security
service to reintroduce travel impediments, such as a
requirement that good-conduct certificates be obtained
pefore leaving the country; and is attempting to per-
suade the Argentines to stamp passports "not valid for
travet to Cuba", Liaison services appear mildly recep-
tive. Advance information on Cuban travel by Argentines
through Mexico will be sought from that country. Plans
have been made to send two agents to Cuba to seek in-
formation on the mechanics of travel. Propaganda against
Cuba subversion is being intensified.

(2) Bolivia: Efforts to discourage travel to Cuba
through liaison th the Bolivian government have been
unsuccessful. The station is concentrating on the
penetration of Castro-Communist groups.

(3) Brazil: Because of Government policy, efforts
through the Brazilian National Government have shown
little promise, he Station is working through the
armed forces and friendly State security services to”
arrange travel impediments as feasible. The possi-
bility of requiring State gcod-conduct: certificates
prior to travel is being explored. Propaganda assets
are being utilized by the Station to support its
actions. :

~ (4) Chile: Station is attempting to persuade the
Chilean Government to limit travel on Chilean pass-
ports to countries specified before departure.
Clandestine collection of information on travel to
Cuba is being intensified.

(5) Colombia: Through local services, and covertly.
through the Foreign Office, the Station is exploring
means of impeding travel to Cuba. Arrangements have
been made for passing selected information on travel
to the Colombians. Coverage of Colombian-Cuban
institutions and attempts to identify and interrogate

© Colombians who have traveled to Cuba are being ex-
panded.

(6) Costa Rica: Station is making arrangements
to pass information on Cuba travelers to the Costa
Rican Government on a regular basis and to provide
guidance and covert support.

(7) Dominican Republic: Both the President and
the Security Service have been approached in regard
to preventing travel to Cuba, and both seem willing
to cooperate fully.

(8) Ecuador: Since the Government of Ecuador makes
little effort to control travel to Cuba, the Station
is relying on covert assets, including some in the
police, to impede and harass travelers. .Efforts
continue to persuade the government to take restric-
tive measures.

(9) El Salvador: Station liaison has resulted
in the arrest of several returnees from Cuba.
Informal arrangements already exist for denying or
delaying exit permits to persons going to Cuba and
for harassing returnees.

to develop travel information.

mation with local security services and is expand-
