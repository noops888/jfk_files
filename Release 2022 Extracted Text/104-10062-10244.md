• Initial Request Letter, 19 July 1976.

B. Initial Response, 17 September 1976.

C. Appeal Letter, 21 September 1976.

1.

Summary:

The DDO concurs in the position of the

DDA/Office of Finance/FOIO that Subject's FOIA appeal be

denied in toto (Tab C). In view of the fact that the

Office of Finance is the office of record and repository

for the documents concerned, we recommend that the

response action for this appeal be transferred from

the

DDO to the DDA.

Background:

occupied that position during the requested period.

If, however, his information was incorrect,

requested the 1963 travel records of both the chief

of the section and E. Howard Hunt (Reference A) .

IPS referred the request to the DDO for action.

It was determined during the initial review that

E. Howard Hunt was indeed an employee of the DDO/

Domestic Operations Division in 1963. It was further

was so advised by IPS letter of 17 September, 1976

(Reference B).

Subject appealed our response on 21

September 1976, countering our two principal

reasons for denial with the arguments that since

Hunt was travelling

on official Government

business using public monies, release of this

information could hardly be considered an invasion

of Hunt's personal privacy.

d.

During the appeals review, the DDO rechecked

with DDA/Office of Finance/FOIO (Mr. Hubert N. Lacey)

concerning the Office of Finance's current position

on the releasability of Hunt's travel

records.

Upon reconsideration, the Office of Finance with-

drew its previous recommendation for release of

sanitized versions and suggested that the documents

The Office of Finance conducted a classification

Recommendations:

a.: Since the DDA/Office of Finance is the

office of record for the documents concerned, we

recommend that responsibility for the appeal

response be transferred to the DDA.

We concur with the Office of Finance's

classification review and with its citation of

exemption. (b)(3) for. denial in toto of the

requested

documents.

ve recommend, however,

that exemptions (b)(1), (b)(4)a and (b)(o) also

be claimed.

Justification for

these exemptions

is still valid notwithstanding Subject's

arguments to the contrary.

Subject's point

concerning Hunt's privacy is well-taken and

should

for denial in our initial response letter of

17 September 1976. Exemption (b)(6), however,

listed on the vouchers.

Both exemptions (b) (3)

and (b)(6) apply then and now

to these individuals.

sanitized,

By noting in our initial response that

sanitized versions of the documents would be use-

less to the requester (our second principal reason

for denial), the implication was made that segregable

versions could be released, however meaningless.

This position was not upheld in our appeal review.

We concur with the Office of Finance's stand that

the requested records are in the class of documents

which are

specifically exempt from disclosure by

statute and therefore should be denied in toto.
