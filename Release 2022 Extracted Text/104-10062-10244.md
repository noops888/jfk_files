SUBJECT : FOIA Appeal--Robert Sibley (F 76-455)

REFERENCES : A.:. Initial Request Letter, 19 July 1976.
; B. -Initial Response, 17 September 1976.
> C.. Appeal Letter, 21 September 1976.

1. Summary: The DDO concurs in the position of the
DDA/Office of Finance/FOIO that Subject's FOIA appéal be
denied in toto (Tab C). In view of the fact that the
Office of Finance is the office of record and repository
for the documents concerned, we recommend that the
response action for this appeal be transferred from the
DDO to the -DDA.

2. Background:

a. On 19 July 1976 Robert Sibley, a Washington,
DC journalist, requested "the complete travel
records of the Chief of the covert activities section
in the Domestic Operations Division of the CIA
from January 1, 1963 - December 31, 1963." He
stated that according to his records E. Howard Hunt
occupied that position during the requested period.
If, however, his information was incorrect, he
requested the 1963 travel records of both the chief
of the section and E. Howard Hunt (Reference A).

b. IPS referred the request to the DDO for action.
-It was determined during the initial review that
E. Howard Hunt was indeed an employee of the DDO/
Domestic Operations Division in 1963. It was further

- 1963, all from Washington, DC, to New York

were, first, that release. of the records -would, :

determined that the only "travel records"
maintained by the Agency on E. Howard Hunt
were those on file in the DDA/Office of Finance.
The Office of Finance at that time prepared--
subject to DDO concurrence--suggested saniti-
zations of eleven (11) travel vouchers for

possible release to requester. (The vouchers
represent 11 trips made by E. Howard Hunt in

City and return. The 11 vouchers concerned are
118-63, 134-63, 151-63, 170-63, °186-63,° 219-63,
15-64, 55-64, 97-64, 121-64 and 150-64. ‘See
Tab D for full text_copies.) The DDO, howeve
considered these records‘ nonreleasable and
recommended denial in toto under exemptions ©
(b) (1), (bd) (2), .(b) (3). and .(b) (6) of FOIA. We
also noted that “our principal ‘reasons for denial

violate Hunt's privacy and, second,.'that once ~
all the operational and organizational data had
been removed from the records, the remainder -
would be useless to the requester. Subject .
was so advised by IPS letter of 17 September 1976
(Reference B). :

c. Subject appealed our response on 21
September 1976, countering our two principal
reasons for denial with the arguments that. since
Hunt was travelling on official Government
business using public monies, release of this
a bees could hardly be ipa an invasion
of Hunt's personal privacy. oncerning the second
point, Subject oointained that he is the only
judge of what would be useful to him (Reference C).

d. During the appeals review, the DDO rechecked
with DDA/Office of Finance/FOIO (Mr. Hubert N. Lacey)
concerning the Office of Finance's current position
on the releasability of Hunt's travel records.

Upon reconsideration, the Office of Finance with-
drew its previous recommendation for rélease of
sanitized versions and suggested that the. documents

be denied inasmuch as they represent an .
accounting for expenditures on the certificate cee eee.
of the Director under Section 8b of the CIA e
Act of 1949, as amended, and therefore are
specifically exempt from disclosure by statute--
exemption (b)(3) of FOIA. (See Tab C). :

The Office of Finance conducted a classification

downgraded them from Secret to C

idential.

va.» Since the DDA/Office of Finance is the

, office of record’ for the. documents concerned, we |=:
recommend that responsibility for the appeal —

response be transferred to the-DDA.”.

b. We concur with the Office of Finance's
classification review and with its citation of
exemption. (b)(3) for. denial in toto of the
requested documents. We recommend, however,
that exemptions (b)(1), (b)(2), and (b) (6) also
be claimed. Justification for these exemptions
is still valid notwithstanding Subject's ©
arguments to the contrary. Subject's point
concerning Hunt's privacy is well-taken and |
should not have been cited as a principal reason.
for denial in our initial response letter of
17 September 1976. Exemption (b)(6),-however,
was claimed at that time to also protect the
privacy of Hunt's operational contacts who were
listed on the vouchers. Both exemptions (b) (3)
and (b)(6) apply then and now to these individuals.

c. By noting in our initial response that
sanitized versions of the documents would be use-
less to the requester (our second principal reason
for denial), the implication was made that segregable
versions could be released, however meaningless.

This position was not upheld in our appeal review.
We concur-with the Office of Finance's stand that
the requested records are in the class of documents
which are specifically exempt from disclosure by
statute and therefore should be denied in toto.

4. For the record but not for release. to :
requester: In his initial request of 19 July 1976,
Sibley—requested-the-1963-travel--records
E. Howard Hunt and "the Chief of the covert activities
section". of DO Division if Hunt.was not himself the
of that section. .We neither confirmed.nor denied’
Hunt's position in our initial response nor did -we

. comment on the position of "the Chief of the covert...
activities section in the Domestic Operations %:
Division," since Agency functions and official titl
are exempt under (b)(3). (By the (phrasing of his
request, Subject could, of course, have assumed

“that our response of 17 September’ 1976 was taci
acknowledgement’ that Hunt was "the Chief of: the
covert activities section."). . During. the. appea:

>. review it was determined from. a.1963 Di 2
Division organization. chart’ that DO Div:
that time a position entitled "Assistant for CA...
Activities": (DO/OPCA) which was vacant. Under th
responsibility of DO/OPCA was the Research and
Publications. Branch of which E. Howard Hunt was the
Chief. The foregoing is for record purposes only.

No reference to this aspect of Sibley's initial
request should be made in the Agency's appeal response
to Sibley.
