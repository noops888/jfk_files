A search of real estate records at the office of the

Recorder of Deeds, Chicago by SA HAROLD D. SELL on January

2, 1958, revealed

that the property at 6540 North Milwaukee

Avenue located in an unincorporated area between Chicago

and Niles, Illinois was conveyed by warranty deed to

ROCCO POTENZO on May 14, 1952 and from POTENZO by trust

deed on that date to A. L. CHAMPAGNE. CHAMPAGNE has been

described elsewhere in this report as the attorney for

GIANCANA. Taxes for 1957 on the above addresses were paid

by ROCCO POTENZO. (U

Avenue, Niles, Illinois.

Villa Venice

Wheeling, Illinois

On May 6, 1958, CG T-38

advised SA LESTER K. ESAREY

he was employed at Meo's Norwood House, 4750 North Harlem,

Norridge, Illinois for about (three years up until approximately

six weeks ago. He added he is now employed/as a cook in

Rickett's Restaurant in Glenview,

Illinois.

He continued by

saying that during his employmentlat the above restaurant he

became well acquainted with the fact that this restaurant

seemed to be one of the main hang-outs of the top hoodlums in

the Chicago area.

He stated that although he was working in

the kitchen at this restaurant he was aware when the hoodlums

were in the rostaurant

and who some of them are, and on occasion

observed some of them...

He advised that the Norwood House is

owned by AL "CHUCK" and JIMMY MEO; that JIMMY owns the Franklin

House in Franklin Park, and that SAM MOONEY owns the Villa

venice located in Wheeling, Illinois.

He added, however,

although the Villa Venice is owned by SAM MOONEY it is shown

as being owned by the MEO brothers. He added that ALFRED MEO,

gOn of CHUCK MEO, manages the Villa Venice(4)

In regards to the Norwood House, CG T-38 stated

one TRIP, wife of CHUCK MEO, helps to manage the Norwood House.

In addition, one MIKE KELLY (probably SPERANZE) seems to have

some authority at the Norwood House as he is the only hoodlum

who ever makes an appearance in the main diningroom and on

occasion while in the main dining room he has given orders to

employees.

CG T-38 related that the hoodlums use the private

dining room in the Norwood House each day Monday through

at

Norwood House and that the waitresses are all married

and at

least over 30 years of age.

He furnished the name of the

first cook as ELLIS (LNU),

telephone LI 8-7185. He stated

another cook was named SMITTY and that possibly his first

name is ENMETT..

CG T-38 advised that one GLEN (LNU) is the

head busboy at this restaurant and appears to be more

acquainted with hoodlums than any of the other employees.

He explained that GLEN and his wife reside in the rear of

TRIP MEO's woman's clothing store on North Avenue and that

GLEN's wife works in this same store.

Further, that GLEN

has worked at TONY ACCARDO's house and some of the other

hoodlums for private parties.

He stated that GLEN is about

40 years of age and drives a 1956 Pontiac which is white and

pink in color. 4)

CG T-38 stated that years ago, before the MEo

brothers got into the restaurant business, JIMMY MEO had

an

orchestra which was well known throughout the Middle West

and that CHUCK MEO worked for one "NEEDLES" in some type

of gambling set up/y)

On May 8,

1958, CG T-38 was recontacted by SA ESAREY

years at the Villa Venice as a cook.

He described DALLAS

as a tall thin dark fellow, approximately 4U years of age,

four or five months without missing a day and then go off

on a two weeks drunken binge.

On two or three occasions he

took SAM MOONEY's car with him.

As the result of this

SHERMAN did not have the use of MOONEY's car. U

CG T-38 related that the Villa Venice was bought

approximately two years ago by MOONEY and/or the MEO's from

one PAPPA BOUCHE (phonetic). He stated BOUCHE (phonetic) is

known as a Frenchman and is very well liked. He added that

BOUCHE was then operating a restaurant in Florida.
