MEMORANDUM FOR THE FILES

SUBJECT: Treatment of Survivora

1. MANSON confirme that all five of the survivors who appeared

before the Taylor Committee received their $250. 00 bonus in Miami.

However, ho admitted that they have not rereived the kind of attention

they should have received from AMIRON and AMBUD. This probably

due to the antagonism which has always existed beturen the porsonali-

ties of AMIRON/AMBUD and the camp leaders. MANSON is very con-

scious of the need for careful handling of survivora and returnees and

la planning to come up with apecific recommendations on this subject.

2. I asked Joe Langan to attempt to get from the five survivors a

statement of any unresolved complaints which they may have. Joe said

that three of them were leaving for New York City and the other two for

Miami almoat immediately. He said each had been giren $500 in addition

to the $125. 00 which they had received for expenses, and the $250,00

bonus received in Miami.

Joe has arranged a channel of communication

between these men and ourselves for future use. He feels the granting of

the extra $500 will become known and that equal trealment will be demanded

by other survivors and returnees.
