This area covers Passaic County, New Jersey, which’
is dominated by the two major cities of Paterson and Passaic,
New Jersey. :

In September, 1961, NK T-21 advised that HARR
272 Boyle Avenue, Totowa,..New.Jersey, is the most impo:
man in gambling activities in the Paterson area. He stated
that there can be no question that SALL has political
influence of some type inasmuch as he knows from personal
experience that SALL can help a local gambler in trouble
with the law in Paterson, and that this, in fact, has
happened to him, When difficulty is encountered between
gamblers, SALL is usually sought out to settle the matter
and his instructions are always rigidly followed. He is
certain that gamblers in the Paterson area lay off bets
with SALL and that 3ALL undoubtedly has runners working for
him.

SALL was in September, 1961 operating from a phone
booth in front of Hartman's Confectionary, 429 Tenth Avenue,
Paterson. He stated this place is known as "HARRY's office"
or the "Sugar Bowl." SALL has operated undisturbed fron
this phone booth for the past two or three years without
being troubled by the Paterson Police Department or repre- |
sentatives of the Passaic County Prosecutor's Office, Informant
stated that he has frequently seen members of the Paterson
Police Department contact SALL at this location.

NK T-22 in December, 1961 advised that HARRY SALL
is still operating at his regular locdtion on Tenth Avenue
in Paterson, and is still the top manjfin gambling and
political contacts. in the Paterson arpa. Persons who work
with SALL in this operatign are PAI SPITZ, who hooks.
