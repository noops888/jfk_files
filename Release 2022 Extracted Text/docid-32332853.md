ARNOLD R. DANIELS, Manager, Williamsburg Furniture

Shop,

Inc., 1018 Perry Highway, Pittsburgh, advised on May 9,

1958, during a conversation concerning MIKE GENOVESE,: a

Pittsburgh top hoodlum, that he is well acquainted with the

subject of this investigation. He stated that he has known

the subject for a long time because he also resides at Ingomar.

He recalled that he has not seen LA ROCCA since

sometime during

1957, and that LA ROCCA has been in his shop on only one

occasion.

furniture from GILBERT's Furniture Store In Downtown Pittsburgh

but could not be certain of this.
