C/LAD Memorandum dated 22 June 1976, Citing Specific

Objections to Mr. David Phillips' Manuscript

I. The general tenor of the manuscript leaves much to be desired

reviewed portions of the manuscript pertinent to their areas have

conmented negatively on the revelations of tradecraft and identifica-

tion of numerous overseas Stations and operations.

2. Other objectionable items in the manuscript concern the con-

firmation of Agee's effectiveness in neutralizing Agency efforts abroad

by publishing lists of CIA personnel in specificuStations; revelation

28 of

personnel in

the

Agency role in countering terrorism, narcotics trafficking and training

provided other services to counteract these activities; and, the

specific identity of liaison relationships, particularly

3. The overall concensus of this Division is that publication of

this manuscript in its present form would be detrimental to the Agency

and this Division in

particular.
