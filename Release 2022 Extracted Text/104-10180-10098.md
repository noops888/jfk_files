MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
: SUBJECT: Manolo RAY

1. On 18 December 1964 the undersigned lunched with

RAY at the Hoxel Anbassador and bricfed him on the high-

_ lights of contact made with Mr. Crimmins at State on the
afternoon of the lith of December.

2. RAY is crushed over the fate of his plans to

a export his arms to Costa Rica. I told him our Ambassador
had received a nesative reply from the Costa Rican Govern-
ment as end user about 28 November. RAY pointed out that
this must have been the second or even third visit paid by
our Ambassador to Cesta Rican authorities on this matter
and he stated be believes these multiple comings and goings
must have given the Costa Ricans the impression the U.S. is
against the shipment. I told him apparently Oduber got out
of touch with current thinking in Costa Rica, but RAY
believes there were just too many visits on the matter. :
The part about internal political considerations in Costa
Rica did not seen to impress RAY much.

3. Per discussion with Mr. Crimmins, I then raised
the possibility of arranging another end user who would have
more guts. RAY,said he would look into it but that there
was really no point in even beginning discussions in an
informal way, if subsequently the U.S, Ambassador was going
to queer the deals by either his attitude or his statements
to the next potential end user. RAY asked if we could give
him some assurances that in the event he lines up another
end user and in the event our Ambassador in such a country
is sent to check it out, we could not have the Ambassador
instructed to say somgthing along the following lines:

"The U.S. is benevolently neutral towards RAY.
If you wish te act as the end user, we would sympathize
with your decision, but we are not asking you to accept
the shipment cer act on our behalf."

the question is going to be more academic than real, [
told RAY that our people felt he would have a better chance
of surviving if he waits another three to six months for
his attempt, and this seemed to cheer him up, but he says
his plaus have been progressing very well the past two to
three months, and I can see he has been keying himself up
to the action, :

8. RAY will be at home in Puerto Rico (he hopes) by
Monday night, 21 Decembor, 1 am to call him at 767-6138,
his home, if anything is doing. An alternate contact
would be Raul Chibas in New York.

9. I made one small proposal of my own, namely that
RAY try to see if he might not be able to persuade the
Costa Rican Government to accept a lesser number of arms
as end user. He did not think much of this idea.

YO. Tho attached torn page from U.S. News and World
Report was given ‘by me to RAY to serve as a bona fides in
the event I have to send somcone to him whom he does not
know.

11, RAY stayed last night with Felipe Pazos, formerly
of the Banco Nacional de Cuba, now employed by the OAS.

I told RAY I would try to get an answer to this
and hoped if [ did tt would stick.

4, RAY then wanted to know what markings are absolutely
minimum for the weapons and bills of sale. I told him I'd
look into this and try to get him an answer, pointing out
to him the troubles in the present marking system. He told
me the word "Model" does not actually appear on the weapons,
nor does the word "serial," which somewhat improves the
situation, I told him not to do anything with the markings
now on the weapons without further word from us, because
he might do even more harm than heretofore, He says he can
eliminate the tree and JURE, which are on the trigger guards.
He doos-not seem to know exactly what markings are on just
how many pieces of equipment, but he thinks at least some
were put’ on a.couple of weeks ago. I am surprised at his
vagueness on this point.

5. RAY finally asked the following questions designed
to shed light on just how confidential the export of arms
is kept in the U.S

* How confidential is the export permit? Who has to
know about it? Is it ever publicized? Does it have a
to be publicized? What security rules govern tnis i
matter with respect to other U.S, agencies involved,
such as Customs?

I told him I would try to find out about this, but
indicated my belief that when several departments in at least
two governments are involved, secrecy cannot well be guaran~
teed, especially when the arms firm involved (Erquiaga) has
been having some legal troubles and is being watched,

G. RAY still thinks it would be better not to have
the correct serial numbers show on the B/L and asked if
there would not be some way to control just one inspector
who would merely check the amounts, not the markings, on
the shipment. RAY would give us an honest run-out of the
numbers. I told him there was no possibility of running an
operation against another U.S, Government agency.

7. The conversation was so unsatisfactory that I did not
raise the limitations posed by Mr. Crimmins on RAYts radio
commo. This can wait until later, as right now it appears
