kad on one woe we Cries at state on the

afternoon of the lith uf December.

RAX is crushed over the fate of his plans to

his arms so Costa Rica.

I told him our Ambassador

had received a negative reply

from the Costa Rican Govern-

ment as end user about 28 November.

RAY pointed out that

this must have been the second or even third visit pald by

our Ambassador to losta Rican authorities on this matter

and he stated he delicves these multiple comings ind goings

must have given the Costa Ricans the impression the U.S. Is

against the shipment.

I told him apparently Oduber got oul

of touch with current thinkin in Costa Rica. but RAY

believes there vere just too many visits on the matter.

The part about internal political considerations in Costa

not seen to impress RAY much.

Per discussion with Mr. Crimmins, I then raised

the possibility of arranging

another end user who would have

told Rll that our peoplo felt he would have a better chance

of surriving if he walts another thice to six monthe for

his attempt, and this secmed to cheer him up, but he says

his plaus have been progressing very well the past two to

thice months, and I can see he has been keging himself up

to the action.

He does not seem to know exactly what markings are

how many, pieces of equipment,

but he thinks at least some

on a couple of weeks ago. I am surprised at his

vagueness on this point.
