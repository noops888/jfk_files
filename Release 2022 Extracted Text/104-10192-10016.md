by, Céstro, and he vas under constant surveillance that
Practically amounted to house arrest. In spite of Castro's
Precautions, however, RAY maintained contact with the MRR
snd, through members of that group, with anti-Castro move-
wents in and out of Cuba. By 3 June 1960, after he had

Decome nearly destitute because of the impossibility of

eployment, RAY's followers and associates began to plan
his exfiltratica from Cuba so that he could become a more
effective rallying point for anti-Castro movements in exile.

of several overtures from the FRD to join forces, One of
the primary reasons for the ADR's attractiveness 16 RAY's
