A little later, called and asked that I go i

“incident. He said ne had only sketchy information on the first incident R
-but that he would look into it immediately. |! told him Clements was waiting i
for a return call. He said he would take of that. | dropped the matter.

Approximately one hour later | received another call from Clements

because no one had called him. | told him | would call back shortly. 1 al
called ae and asked them to inform the CIA. | i
alled mie back and said the CIA was not Tterested fn talking to Yo ;
the Cubans because of their khown affiliation with an anti-Castro terrorist 95y,
group in the US. He suggested | pass the information to the FBI, Mr. Willis of

of the Cubans from other activities. 1! told him what had transpired. He

ms them that no @ gericy would meet with them. He said a third Cuban was with i
them - Robert, (Carballo, their contact with Cuba, Clements said that during
their conver$ation he determined: (1) that the information about the +
desire of é number of Cubans in Angola to defect came from Roberto Carballo i
through other Cubans who had returned to Cuba from Angola, (2) that the
Cubans had been in contact with representatives of President Somoza of : i
Nicaragua, seeking his assistance, (3) that the basic concept was to set i
up stations in a country bordering Angola and wage a campaign to inform q
Cubans still in Angola of their existence, with the expectation (based
on the evidence they had) that large numbers of Cubans would take advantage
of the opportunity to defect. Clements also said he overheard a conversation
