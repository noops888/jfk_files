Dear Mr. Helms:

котрі!

In connection with some discussions recently had with

Mr. Abram Chayes, The Legal Adviser to the Department of State,

Mr. Chayes has informed the Commission that members of the Depart-

ment of State have informed him that at the time Lee Harvey Oswald

received his tourist visa to enter Russia from the Soviet ambassy

at Helsinki, Finland, at least a week ordinarily transpired between

the time when the tourist applied for his visa and the issuance of

that visa. If this is true, then the fact that lee Harvey Oswald

obtained his tourist visa in from two to four days may have some

significance.

From material previously supplied to the Commission by

the Central Intelligence Agency we have concluded that Oswald

arrived in Helsinki on an airplane from London on October 10, 1959,

that his Soviet tourist visa was issued from the Embassy in Helsinki

on October 14, and that he departed for Moscow on a train on

October 15. Assuming that he applied for a visa the same day he

arrived in Helsinki, four days were required for him to obtain the

visa. If, however, his airplane arrived too late on October 10

for him to reach the Soviet Embassy and apply for a visa that same

day, he probably would have had to wait until Monday, October 1?

to tender his application. We have no information on the probable

time of arrival of his flight or the closing time of the Embassy,

so we cannot estimate whether he had sufficient time to get from

the airport to the Embassy before it closed on Saturday, October 10.

We have already asked that the Department of State

look further into this matter and give us its best opinion

regarding the average time required to obtain a Soviet tourist

visa from Helsinki In October 1959 and also the regularity or

lack of regularity evidenced by the Soviet Embassy in this

regard. We are of course interested in the question of the

regularity of procedures because we want to know whether, if

Oswald did in fact obtain his visa more quickly than was normal,

his doing so was significant, or whether it may have been only

the result of a not-infrequent deviation from normal procedures.

¡ If it is still possible at this time to determine the

approximate hour on October 10, 1959 when Oswald's flight arrived

in Helsinki and the hour when the Soviet Embassy closed, this

information, plus an estimate of the time required to travel fron

the airport to the Embassy by commercial transportation, would

also be of assistance. to the Commission.

Sincerely,

J. Lee Rankin

General Counsel
