Dear Mr. Helms: ohh

GS

In connection with some discussions recently had with
Mr. Abram Chayes, The Legal Adviser to the Department of State,
Mr. Chayes has informed the Commission that members of the Depart-
ment of State have informed him that at the time Lee Harvey Oswald
received his tourist visa to enter Russia from the Soviet Bmbassy
at Helsinki, Finland, at least a week ordinarily transpired between
the time when the tourist applied for his visa and the issuance of
that visa. If this is true, then the fact that Lee Harvey Oswald
obtained his tourist visa in from two to four days may have some
significance.

From material previously supplied to the Commission by
the Central Intelligence Agency we have concluded that Oswald
arrived in Helsinki on an airplane from London’on October 10, 1959,
that his Soviet tourist visa was issued from the Embassy in Helsinki
on October 14, and that he departed for Moscow on a train on
October 15. Assuming that he applied for a visa the same day he
arrived in Helsinki, four days were required for him to obtain the
visa. If, however, his airplane arrived too late on October 10
for him to reach the Soviet Embassy and apply for a visa that same
day, he probably would have had to wait until Monday, October
to tender his application. We have no information on the probab.
time of arrival of his flight or the closing time of the Embassy,
so we cannot estimate whether he had sufficient time to get from
the airport to the Bubassy before it closed on Saturday, October 10.

We have already asked that the Department of State
look further into this matter and give us its best opinion
regarding the average time required to obtain a Soviet tourist
visa from Helsinki in October 1959 and also the regularity or
lack of regularity evidenced by the Soviet Embassy in this
regard. We are of course interested in the question of the
regularity of procedures because we want to know whether, if
Oswald did in fact obtain his visa more quickly than was normal,
his doing so was significant, or whether it may have been only
the result of a not-infrequent deviation from normal procedures.

' If it is still possible at this time to determine the
approximate hour on October 10, 1959 when Oswald's flight arrived
in Helsinki and the hour when the Soviet Bubassy closed, this
information, plus an estimate of the time required to travel from
the airport to the Embassy by commercial transportation, would
also be of assistance.to the Commission.

Sincerely,

J. Lee Rankin
General Counsel
