Summary of Contacts with : J ‘i

= MUHIP/L and AMLASH/1

HELSINKI:
1. Events of 30 July 1962. !
AMHIP arrived in Helsinki on 30 July 1962. He called HBFINGH e
according to plan, and after his second call (due to his hotel porter's 5
abystnal understanding of English), Fallucci established contact with

AMMHIP without further difficulty. The meeting took place in the
restaurant of his hotel, The yaakuna, and later in his room. We had
not at this time located AMLASH, so the time was spent briefing AMMHIP fo
on the local scene, and on his conduct with AMLASH when they met. The i

meeting lasted about one and a half hours. : ! ef
Later the sane day we called AMMHIP at his hotel to report :
ho progress in locating AMLASH. Feeling it advisable to keep AMMHIP hy
occupied, we took him out to dinner at Fisketorpet, located in the :
suburbs of Helsinki. The evening lasted until 1200, terminating with a
drink at the roof bar of the Yeakuna. During the six hours, ve had an
cpportunity to explain carefully to AMIP that in order for us to help :
his friend, AMLASH mst be willing to follow our directions and agree to

certain conditions (already agreed upon by interested Has. parties).

Saar

E AWIHIP realized that this was necessary, and agreed with our ideas. However,
he is attached to AMLASH, and will continue to look upon him in the most
benevolent and subjective manner. This being rather far removed from our
intended approach to, and opinion of AMLASH. AMMHIP will require handling
of a close nature in order that he fully understands and is avare of our

eithe fes

i



position in this matter. We closed the meeting by telling him that we
would have an effort made in the morning to locate AMLASH, and that he
might as well relax, sight-see ii he wished, and that we would be in touch

with him at intervals during the day.

2, Events of 31: July 1962.
Our efforts to locate AMLASH through UNRUMBLE/2 proved to be
fruitless. Theadore T. Wintergrst, who was handling UNRUMBLE/2, said

that the latter tried his best, but had not been able to do us any good.

The Station also reported that its contacts had been unable to aid us.

‘ We reported to AMWHIP the fact that we had not located AMLASH, and suggested :

3 that we have dinner together, to which he agreed. We met AMMHIP at 2100 fd

= at our hotel, the Kamp, and proceeded to the Royal Restaurant for dinner. i \

: AVGHIP was obviously getting on pins and needles because we had not found : fae
5 his friend. He suggested that we call up the Cutan Festival delegation, : |

‘ or try some hotels that evening. We persuaded him that it was not the !

best idea yet, and to give other people more time to locate him. He a

agreed, but kept coming up with ideas all evening for ways to locate AMLASH. 3
He suggested that AMLASH lixed night clubs, and that after dinner we could

Perhaps try several. We agreed, more to placate him that with any thoughts

of auccess. We tried several, the Brounsparken and the Theater Grill, {

both of which were filled with drinking Finns, but no signs of AMLASH, The

Finns, engaging in their national pastime, obviously irritated AMMIP, and i
after being pushed around in the Theater Grill for an hour, he said that pea |
he thought this was a waste of time. We agreed, grabbed a taxi and went.

home, During the evening, ve told AMWHIP that tomorrow morning, if nothing
had tured up, we would start by calling the better hotels in tom ourselves,
and try this rather laborious method to locate AMLASH. We agreed to meet

3. Events of 1 August 1962.
AMWHIP arrived at our hotel at 0945 on 1 August, and we retired

to our room to telephone. Securing an outside line, our friend began

to telephone. We decided to try the local "pink" hotels first, the (Laas

Korkki, and the Torni. AMWHIP had no luck with the Klaas Korkki, but when

he called the Torni, he was told that AMLASH was there, and was connected

i
|

with room No. 201, A Spanish-speaking man (who was later identified as
the newly appointed Cuban Diplomatic Representative to Finland) answered /
the phone in 201 and said that AMLASH was in the shower, and call back :

later if it was important. AMWHIP left a message that he vas from Mexico :
and that he, "Carlos", would call back. During the break, we instructed

him to be careful on the telephone, and to talk as if the opposition was 7 | i
Mstening. He was just to be casual, greet ANLASH, arrange to see him, pj

saying that he was in Europe on business in Scandinavia, France and Switzerland, ay
and that hearing in Helsinki that AMLASH was attending the Festival, he
had decided to stop over and contact him. When AMLASH answered the phone, :

AWWHIP's face 1it up, caution was abandoned, and he was off at a rapid

rate in Spanish. AMLASH said that he would be right over to see AMWHIP
in his room at the Yaakuna. We briefed AMNHIP once more on being careful,
and showed AMWHIP to the door. We arranged to have AMMHIP call us when

he could at the office, urging him once more to be careful and discreet.

We hope he has been. It was later learned that finding AMLASH in this
hotel room was pure good fortune, as he was just using this room to take
a shower, since he was still residing in.the quarters of the conmon delegates.

a



ro

ieee

AMUHIP talked to AMLASH for at least seven hours, from about
1000 in the morning until approximately 1700 the sane evening. When AMMHIP -
called us at 1730, he presented us with the fact that he had convinced ;
AMLASH to talk with us, and for this purpose, he had arranged a dinner

meeting that same evening for approximately 1930. We would have preferred

to talk longer with AMHHIP about AMLASH's reactions, but time did not

permit. We arranged a dinner for 2100 at ™ i ady", a restaurant

some way from the center of town, and succeeded in obtaining a private i
dining room, a practice not uncommon in this Station-reconmended restaurant,
as it is often used by businessmen to have private dinners and afterwards,
business discussions.

We arrived at the White Lady first, arranged for the dinner, and
avaited AMNHIP and AMLASH, who arrived at 2110 by taxi. Although AMWHIP
had suggested to us that the discussions should be merely devoted to fee
getting acquainted the first evening, AMLASH commenced almost imnediately 1
into a discussion of his feelings and, his position concerning Cuba today.”
As reported in our cable, (Hels 1609) AMLASH was quite intense, and showed
the strain of his unexpected meeting with AMWHIP. Although obviously ‘

. under emotional strain, AMLASH presented his feelings in a relatively calm

manner, and was given to discussing them throughout the meal. He said he |

was considering not going back to Cuba, but after talking to AMMHIP, he :

felt that 4f he could do something really significant for the creation of an
a new Cuba, he was interested in returning to carry on the fight there. : I

{
He said he was not interested in risking his life for any small undertaking, -
but that if he could be given a really large part to play, he would use

himself and several others in Cuba whom he could rely upon. These he said \ }



included two majors (one of which AMWHIP later reported was a militia
commander in the center part of the island), two captains, and several
others whom AMLASH said he could trust, but whom he would not naze.

AMLASH said he had had plans to blow up an oil refinery, as he felt that
the continuing existence of a senblence of normal functicning in Cuba
depended upon a continuing supply of petroleum, supplies of which, as we
know, are at a critical stage today. He also wanted to plan the execution
of Carlos Rodriguez and the Soviet Ambassador, and also to eliminate Fidel,
by execution if necessary, He feels that if Fidel is eliminated, it would
be mich easier to effect a take-over. (We listened for the most part, but
at this point tried to explain to AMLASH that men like Rodrigues could easily
be replaced by Moscow, and that the killing of the Soviet Ambassador, would
have only the briefest effect on the Soviet control of Cuba.) AMLASH was
not too interested in listening at this point, and contimed by saying that
if he could achieve all these actions, plus others, in one master stroke,

a take-over, during the ensuing confusion, would be mch facilitated. He

@id not feel that Raul or Che would be able to rally the people in sufficient
time to prevent opposition forces fron forming. His arguments and plans had
many flaws, but AMWHIP could not help admiring (to himself) AMLASH's
Professed desire for vigorous and, hepefully, effective actions, designed

to alter the situation in no uncertain terms. While we were making no

committments or plans, we pointed out to AMLASH that schemes like he envisioned

certainly had their place, but that a lot of coordination, planing, information-

collection, etc., were necessary prerequisites to ensure the value and success
of euch plans. AMLASH said he agreed with this, but we weren't too sure just
how mich of this argument AMLASH was willing, or would be willing, to buy.

st,

AMLASH made it clear during the discussions that he was conpletely
against Fidel's use of Soviet help from the first, but he had never envisioned,
that even if it vere used, just how ineffective it really would be towards
solving Cuba's problems. He still feels strongly, he said, about ‘the
Plight of the lower classes in Cuba, and in any future Cuba, he would still
insist on a new deal for then, AMLASH said that although he had not been
effective in helping the formation of a beneficial new Government in Cuba,
he was now prepared to work towards that end. This time, he said, he
wanted to look more towards the future, both for his own interests and for
Cuba's. The last time, he said that he thought only as far as the elimination
of Batista, and had not given consideration to planning for a government he
favored after the fighting was over. We felt that AMLASH meant that he was
as much concerned about his (AMLASH's) position in the government and
Personal stake in a new Cuba, as he was about anything else. It is our
impression that AMLASH feels that he did not get his share of the spoils
or power from the Castro regime, in proportion to his contribution against
Batista. AMLASH 4s a complicated personality. It is difficult to fairly

Judge, at this time, AMLASH's degree of concern for a truly revolutionized
Guba for the people's benefit, vs his concern to see a new government in
Cuba in which he gets just recognition, This does not necessarily mean
that AMLASH wants high political office, but he does want credit for his
efforts and the resultant power and prestige among his countrymen.

In addition to his concern for the manner in which the Soviets are
using Cuba for their own designs in Latin America, AMLASH is worried about
the extent to which Castro is using the Soviet technique of capturing the
minds of the young people and the mass propaganda efforts against the masses.



He feels certain that in a couple of years, the young people will be completely
and irrevocably won over to Castro, and that the masses will begin to believe
the intense anti-American, anti-West propaganda to which they are subjected.
Just as great as are AMLASH's fears about the Castro's winning of
young minds, is his concern thet the USA will begin to consider a status
quo for Cuba, and in the event of any intense and successful anti-regine
activity, such as he plans, and which looks as if it might depose the regime,
PBPRIME will withdraw its support from such efforts in the face of serious

threats fron the Soviets, Although AMLASH aid not say it in so many words,

meat teh

it was apparent from the discussions that AMLASH would prefer to be able to
free Cuba without any outside support (and by inference, obligations), but
he 1s a realist enough to concede that any efforts to overthrow Castro
must have the support of PBPRIME. He is, therefore, willing to enter into
discussions with a representative (s) of PBPRIME towards this end.
AMLASH agreed to meet in Paris for the purpose of further debriefings

and to give any information in any field which he has. He is also most
willing to discuss any plans which may lead to an overthrow of the present
government. AMLASH stated many times, however, during the course of the Ay
meetings, that he was only interested in involving himself in a plan of {
significant action, and which was truly designed to achieve rapidly his desire |
to help Cuba. (He told AMVHIP later after we had left the meetings, that
he was afraid that PEPRIME would continue to pursue its present course,
that of providing money and ideas, but no ACTION!) AMLASH was also most
adamant about not becoming involved in any way with the Cuban refugee

_ circles and organizations in Miami. He. said that he feels these are still :
the same people who left Cuba, i.e., willing to wait for the chance to return

"PERSE eee astern nnn ne RA

and again pursue their only interest , that of making money. He also said

he felt that. the Cubans there were completely penetrated by Castro informants,

ar

and that for them to know of his cooperation with PBPRIME, would be the same
as telling Castro, and thus his future would end against the Wall! We

assured him that maximum security would be practiced, as far as tiese people ne

were cacerned, He also does not wish to trust or be involved with, any i

!

é contract Cubans, Only sre PpPA TERS does he wish to deal. (Along this line, !

t AMAHIP stated that he did not think it advisable to reveal any of these

i negotiations to AMCONCERT/1, whom AMMHIP has known for many years and is |
; quite friendly, but whom he does not feel can keep a secret of this nature.) eaaeee
H This meeting terminated at 0030 on 2 August. ‘The three participants !

took a taxi together back to town. AMIHIP and AMLASH stopped off at a local 5
night club, Teatey) Grillen, while we continued on to our hotel. No incidents i
of @ security nature wore observed, and it was felt that the meeting was g |
held without the knowledge or observation of the opposition. i
k. Meeting of 2 August 1962.

We met with AMWHIP in his hotel room (No. 1h2 at the Vaakuna) at
1700 hours on 2 August. We discussed the events and talks of the preceding i
evening for some time. At approximately 1600, AMLASH arrived, greeted

us affably, and joined us for a drink. AMLASH used this meeting to re-

state his position concgrning his desire for participation in a really
significant action against the Castro regine. Having decided by this tine

that further discussions and debriefings of AMLASH should take Place with

a

@ Spanish-speaking C/O, we outlined the idea to meet for such a purpose in

Paris. AMLASH did not like the idea of too mary people being aware of his
cooperation with PEPRIME, but agreed that it would be best in order to

~,-, Slow himself to express his ideas and plans better, and to be able to provide
us with his information in the greatest possible detail.:

We persuaded AMMHIP and AMLASH that it would be best not to have.
further meetings with them in Helsinki, but that we could continue our talks
in greater safety in Stockholm and Paris, They agreed. AMLASH also said
that he felt that he shouldn't sts ANWHIP too mich more in Helsinki, as he
was beginning now to make some public appearances, and his presence was now : i
established to everyone in the city. Incidentally, prior to Thursday,
2 August, AMLASH had purposely refrained from making any public appearances |
at the Festival because (1) he and the other Cubans had been aware of the i
AMSPELL group and their announced intentions, and (2) AMLASH did not feel :
very disposed to play the "Public Relations" man from Cuba and espouse the
"peace and friendship nonsense", as he called it. However, AMLASH also said

that he felt that he had better perform this role to some extent, as it was eee

expected of him by Fidel, and he did not wish to provide any unnecessary
chances for unsatisfactory reports to be set back home concerning his lack : i
of cooperation with the Cuban delegation. In making the arrangements for

@ Paris meeting and further discussions, AMLASH said, in response to the 2
question, that it would be quite normal for him to be in Paris, as he had

already cleared this with Fidel, with whom, he renarked caustically, one

a
|

had to clear everything these days, He then expressed the idea that he

would like to return to Paris, via Stockholm, and at AMMHIP's suggestion,
spend a few days there just relaxing, From there, or Copenhagen, he would :
return to Prague for two days at most, in order to pick up his luggage, :

then come as soon as possible to Paris. There, he intended to visit a
hospital or two, as agreed upon with Fidel, and spend a total of at least
a week there. He said that if he was to return to Cuba to begin his

efforts, he did not wish to be away from Cuba any longer than necessary.

(He has, it 1s noted, a sense of urgency in beginning action against the i
regime as soon as possible.) AMVHIP told us later that AMLASH also was
interested in a Pan American Migsiebased stewardess, whom he would have

come over to stay with him. AMiHIP suggested to us that he thought the
‘stewardess might be connected with PBPRIME. He based this apparently on

@ remark which the stewardess made concerning AMLASH's political frame of
mind last year, We answered that as far as we knew there was no basis for
AMWHIP's thoughts along this line.) AMWHIP will try to get the stewardess
full name for us.

Meeting arrangements for Stockholm and Helsinki were laid on at
this meeting. AMLASH felt he had to stay until the end of the Festival for
cover purposes. Since AMWHIP had already accidentally run into several
people he knew, it was agreed that he should leave town for Stockholm in
the near future. We would remain behind until AMLASH left, serving as an
emergency contact in the event of change in AMLASH's Plans. It was arranged
to meet AMLASH if absolutely necessary, at either 1200 or 1800 each day
at a given restaurant in the center of the city. Normal security measures
for the "emergency" meeting were laid on. In Stockholm, meeting arrangements
for Paris will be established. AMWHIP departed Helsinki 5 August and is
Presumably staying at the Palace Hote) in Stockholm; he will make arrangements
for accommodations for AMLASH there. We will follow AMLASH to Stockholm.

5. Helsinki Meetings between AMWHTP/1 and Pallucci.

AMAHIP and Fallucei were in public together only three times for

any length of time. Other meetings were held in their respective hotel rooms.

One breakfast meeting (the 5th of August) was held in the near-deserted

e

dining room of the Yaakuna Hotel at 1030. AMWHIP and Fallucci met at least _

once a day during the sojourn in Helsinki. AMWHIP used the name William
Thompson, as instructed, when calling HBFINCH to make initial contact.
There were no incidents of a security nature observed during any of these
meetings.

6. Other Youth Festival Targets.

This area covered by cables Hels 158) and Hels 1609. The best
and, actually, only possibility among the participants was Jose Venegas.
However, both AMLASH and AMWHIP did not want to become involved with him
as they felt that this, in both their cases, might compromise their
interests in AMLASH's returning to Cuba. AMWHIP felt, for example, that
Venegas would almost certainly connect his presence here with an attempt to

do something with AMLASH. AMLASH also felt that he did not want to disclose
any indications of his real sympathies to Venegas, if he (ANLASH) were going

to return to Cuba. Without doing this, it would be difficult to get any
reactions or opinions from Venegas, thought AMLASH. Venegas, it is felt
by AMLASH, might very possibly be counted on ata later date if this was
desirable. An approach could then be worked out at that time.

As reported, AMLASH came to the Festival as a "special delegate,"
after his request to Fidel was approved. AMLASH claimed to Fidel that he
was fatigued and sick and needed a good rest in Europe. The Festival
provided the excuse, Fidel bit the bait, and AMLASH got to Europe to see
AMMHIP, his original intention. AMMHIP felt that this is a logical and
honest explanation. It is interesting to note that neither the local
service, 0/2, or any of the Cuban delegates he asked, could determine the
whereabouts of AMLASH. It is perhaps reasonable to assume that the Cubans

were told not to tell of his presence to anyone not from their immediate



7. AMAHIP's Role in AMLASH Talks.
AMAHIP has been most helpful and cooperative in establishing
the initial contacts with AMLASH, and he undoubtedly does have mich
influence over AMLASH. AMLASH also trusts AMMHIP explicitly, as evidenced
by his remark to us that AMMHIP was the only one whom he felt that he
could fully trust and to whom he could speak openly. Of course, he did
speak openly at length to us at the behest of AMWHIP, out it is also
obvious that he des not tell us everything. AMNHIP has given good advice
in the handling of AMLASH, but, as he has a tendency to interpret AMLASH's
remarks and feelings subjectively, and to attempt to guide us a bit too
much, it might be wise to eliminate in later portions of the talks in Paris,
With a Spanish-speaking C/O, this should not be too difficult to do, and
without alienating AMWHIP. AMWHIP has no clandestine training to speak of,
as evidenced by his actions in this case. However, to his credit, he
Yesponds readily to directions in this area, and follows rather well suggestions
for adding to the security of the meetings. His remark about the
advisability of keeping his old friend AMCONCERT/1 out ef the operation or
from any knowledge thereof, is gratifying. AMHHIP also has gently explained
to us, that while he is a Cuban at heart and loves the Cubans, they simply
cannot be trusted to keep secrets among any of their friends who, for no
real tested reasons, they consider safe and discreet. As a general
statement, we feel that AMWHIP is a good security risk operationally, and
that with more exposure to the game, will become a good and useful asset
under almost any circumstance. He is, however, somewhat subconsciously
subjective about his evaluations of AMLASH. He is completely honest, and is
: using @ consideratle amount of his own money, not, to mention time, in this

operation. We only hope his faith in AMLASH is justified.



8.. Evaluation of and Comments about AMLASH.

Our initial coments forwarded in cable Hels 1609 remain unchanged.
We have seen too little of, and cannot converse in the native language of
AMLASH, to make an: strongly valid assessnent of him to date. In the

second meeting with AMLASH, he was considerably more relaxed than in the

first, but just as intense about his convictions...or seemingly so. AMLASH

stated that, having decided to return to Cuba, he would enrole in an

officers! refresher type course at Matanzas in an effort to renew old

Army contacts, re-assert his position as a major in the Revolutionary Army, ;

and attempt to re-establish some recognition and following in Army and other

Government circles.

For the sake of completeness, we repeat our coments regarding La
AMLASH from Hels 1609:

He appears capable of rash, thoughtless, violent i anes
action under the strain of provocation, tense situations, i
or frustration. For example, he stated to us that last year| bo
during a period of dejection and frustration, he had con- passat why
templated suicide. Although AMLASH appeared to concede ea *
some validity to our arguments for planning and for
carefully prepared actions, we feel that he will present H
difficult control and directional problems in any op ia |
situation. He himself stated several times that he :
is not the type to sit tight, but prefers solutions
to problems by violent, positive actions. AMLASH
showed the strain of not trusting anyone. He was according ae
to AMWHIP, overjoyed to see hin, and talked very, very
much about many, many subjects. It is not possible
to coment at this time about AMLASH's capacity for
loyality to friends or causes, nor his willingness to
see a job through. However, AMNHIP assures us that
when AMLASH says he'll do something, he will. We H
don't know at this point. t

AWHIP also told us that in discussions subsequent to our meetings
with AMLASH, he expressed the hope that "Bill" and his friend (s) in Paris

» ‘will have a really fruitfol, forceful idea and plan of action for him to

cae a

follow, Otherwise, he said he might drop the whole idea and not go back,

but to forget the whole problen, leave the Cuban fold quietly, and vork

in Paris or elsewhere, forgetting completely Cuban problems and Cuban

politics.

AMJHIP also told us on Sunday that he was truly surprised when

i AMLASH said he wanted to go back and fight, AMHIP was sure, as were we,
i that he would defect, period. AMLASH told AMVHIP that he could not see

the point of making a statement regarding defection and the state of affairs

in Cuba, and then accepting a dole in Miami. Nor could he see any use in sa

Propaganda efforts in Latin America or Europe. Later, after our talks

wih hin, AMLASH told AMMHIP a Little different story, 4. e., that he !
wld not want to make a public defection statenent, because of the
Probable repercussions against his friends in Cuba for no good rea:on, E
Tits area of thinking needs to be examined at length in Paris. A Spanish- 1
speaking C/O might well do the trick. ! u
STOCKHOLM: « |
gs Travel to Stockholm. ; !
AMAHIP departed Helsinki for Stockholm on h August. Both AMMMIP |
and AMLASH felt that they had been together enough in Helsinki. AMWHIP t
also ran onto a refugee newspaper friend of his in Helsinki who was 4 ’

quite curious as to why AMHHIP was there. AMLASH departed Helsinki in the
afternoon of 7 August; we took the same flight unbeimownat to AMLASH. !
No problems were encountered in arriving at Stockholm. We took the next j '
bus after AMLASH to the city. Both AMLASH and AMWHIP stayed at the t. |

Palace Hotel, room 828 and 970, respectively. Talks of a general nature

were held in our hotel room (the Carlton) and during the several dinners.
Tt was obvious that AMLASH had mich on his mind. He can return to the

COPENHAGEN:
10. Travel to, and Stop in Copenhagen.

AMLASH and AMAHIP took SAS flight 07 to Copenhagen on the after-
noon of 10 August. In speaking at length about meeting in Paris, AMLASH fia ft
felt sure that there would be no problem in getting pemmission to visit sea ‘4
Paris after returning to Prague. He felt that he better not visit Paris H
first, as it might cause some undue interest in Prague Cuban circles een
as to why he was away so long. He also had some trouble in getting the Air- i
Line to approve his side trips to Stockholm and Copenhagen. They wanted i
him to fly direct to Prague from Helsinki. He refused their requests, |

ssneneett

amd said that he would pay his own way to Stockholm and Copenhagen (or

the difference) if need be. ‘his he finally had to do, for which AMNHIP }
footed the bill. (perhaps we should later absorb). (We felt that this }

ability to pay for the extra routing might cause sone suspicion anong his

colleagues. AMLASH said "no", but ve are not so sure. Perhaps he can tell
them, should they be curious, that AMWHIP paid the bill, as all know he

has money and has, in fact, paid bills before for AMLASH during the time
of the Batista regime.) ‘ :



1L. Copenhagen, 10 August 1952.

AMWHIP and AMLASH arrived as scheduled in Copenhagen and obtained
rooms at the Richmond Hotel. AMVHIP phoned HBFINCH as planned and we
in turn contacted them by phone at +he Richmond at 1645. A meeting was
arranged for 2000 at the bar of the Terminus Hotel. After a drink, the
party retired to Divan I for dinner. Apparently the spell of Tivoli,
Danish food and snaps, and beer at the student's inn, Faergekroen ( in
Tivoli), served to mellow AMLASH. He for the first time appeared to talk
to us as a friend, rather than as a PEPRIME representative. During
supper, and for most of the evening, at intervals, AMLASH talked about
himself, his thoughts, and problems. The evening was well worth it, in
terms of the rapport and insight gained.

12, AMLASH's Thoughts and Personality.

AMLASH feéls basically that he would like to live in a world in
peace under an acceptable political ‘system, practicing medicine, thus
giving expression to his desire to help the less-fortunate people, and from
this to find happiness for himself, something he seeks, but which heretofore
has eluded him. As a young student he got into the struggle against
Batista without thinking mich about the future, particularly that it
could be less than perfect. He soon found that the opposing parties in
Cuba, and in particular the Commmists, were not about to bring true peace
and contentment to the people, but rather through mismanagement and poor
planning, had created unnecessary hardships for the people. After his
fighting time was over (or so he thought), AMLASH became a student again
and leader of the FEU. This did not satisfy him and he sought to leave

_ Politics all together, and return to medicine. The political climate,

however, and the acceptance of al as a military leader by the people }
i
rather than as a doctor (Hello compapcane: not, Hello Doctor!) forced |

AMLASH to reconsider his future, aa to decide that he mist flee Cuba oF!

fight against what he considers a ruinous future for his country and, Hl

her people. ‘This time, however, he hopes to make the "operation"

successful, and never again subject the patient to another such ordeal.

Then when he is sure that the political and social outlook for the
Cuban people and the country are sound, he would like to try once more
to enter private life as a doctor. He is not sure, however, that this i

will ever come about. AMLASH was also quite frank, we thought, in his

conversation with us concerning his views on the PBRPIME position vis-a-

vis Latin America. (And, although he had ncthing to say uhich has not been pea)

said by many before him, they were interesting to hear from a disenchanted

Cuban revolutionary.) He feels that PBPRIME is simply not getting "through"

to the youth and stuients of Latin America, as are the Communists, and for ? .
this simple reason alone, the next ten years (when these students become
the political and economic leaders in Latin America) will see us lose
the struggle for Latin America. We replied by using the old line that

PBPRIME realizes only too well today that there were serious short-conings

in our Latin American policy for a number of years and that now we are
doing what we can to correct this. However, it is not our policy (said i
with tongue in cheek) to attempt to alter these conditions or influence

future events by going behind the backs of the established governments in i
the various Latin American countries. Instead, we must take the often
slow, laborious path of working through these governnents, however bad
they may be, in our attempts to guide and influence’ the minds of Latin

American'youth. AMLASH said that he understood why ve take this point |
of view, but nevertheless, if we intended to win. the struggle, we must
d as the Communists dé, and disregard the archaic and doomed old-line
governments in Latin America. We agreed that this was undoubtedly the
more agressive way to deal with the problem, but that such methods would
leave us open to the old familiar charges of interference in the internal
affairs of sovereign countries. AMLASH smiled and replied that froma
practical viewpoint this didn't make any difference, for if we didn't
act forcefully and soon, there wouldn't be any opportunities there for us
to be open to anything! He then cited Venezuela as the next obvious
Communist victim and thereby a loss of another opportunity for PBPRIME.
Obviously AMLASH was correct in much of his thinking, but rather than stand.
ing still with our shoes untied, we gave him the ball by soliciting from
him, as a former student leader and politician, any ideas he might have
for conbating the Communists in the struggle for the minds of Latin
American youth. He replied that he would be glad at any time to disucss
thie problem and to offer what ideas and suggestions he could.

: As a result of the discussions of this evening, we felt that

. AMLASH now was genuinely interested in getting Cuba out of its present

predicament with the active aid of PBPRIME. AMLASH seemed more sincere
and interested in discussing his thoughts and problens with us than at
any previous time, He no doubt skinned over in his own mind (or at least
declined to reveal this to us) his record as president of the FEU. The
full story of this period from his side would be most interesting.
However, we felt that a discussion of this particular subject required the

use of Spanish and the propitious moment.

: As a matter of record, AMLASH stated during the evening that he :
had met Algeria's Ben Bella at one time and knows him more than casually.
He felt that the man bears strict watching by the West as a measure of
Protecting its interests in developments in Algeria. AMLASH thought

fF
|
|

Ben Bella was a clever man, devious, and ambitious, and not to be taken too
literally at his word.

In dealing with AMLASH, one trait of his which confronts the c/o i
at every tzfin is his tempermental reactions over points which would |

generally be considered minor. For example, at one time when we were :

@iscussing the various aspects of AMLASH's future role in Cuba, we used :
the term "assassinate". The use of this term, we later learned from
AGHIP and from AMLASH himself, was most objectionable to the latter, and

he was visibly upset. It was not the act he objected to, but rather merely

the choice of word used to describe it. "Eliminate" was acceptable, but 7 7 _
obviously the term "assassinate" had a distasteful connotation. From j
discussions with AMWHIP, this lab of "assassin" had been given to :
AMLASH after some of his escapades against Batista supporters in the 5
pre-Castro era. Another example, which AMWHIP discussed with us, occurred
Guring a meeting in Mexico City in March 1961, when a KUBARKER said to

AMLASH, "I'm prepared to help you in any way within my pover". According
to AMWHIP, AMLASH later turned to him, shrugging his shoulders in a manner

of saying, "So I need help from him?" These examples are pointed out

here in order to indicate the degree of pride and sensitivity one find's
in AMLASH, and to note that however tedious this attitude may become to
the C/O, it is, from personal experience, quite necessary to adjust one's
approach accordingly in order to secure AMLASH's maximum cooperation.

13, Paris Meeting Arrangerients.
AMLASH has been given AMHIP's hotel in Paris, Franklin Hotel,
19 Rue Buffault (telephone TRU 6940). AMWHIP will reserve a room there for
AMLASH, who can come there directly after he has landed in Paris. Wwe
also had another contact address in the form of the office of a Jeweler
friend and business contact of AMMHIP's; M. B. Rosenblatt, 20 Cite-Trevise
(Telephone TAI-7438). Rosenblatt's mumber has Rot been given to AMLASH.
In discussing security precautions with AMWHIP, it is obvious, that he
still is not possessed of a good sense of security by normal clandestine
ops standards. This, however, can be improved over a period of time.
Note: Subject expressed interest in obtaining i
Gxpert instruction in use of silenced-equiped :
rifles and in use and handling of plastic !
explosives. This can be handled from France i

on priority basis, it is felt, after preliminary \
discussions in Paris.

. Events of 12 August 1962.

According to prior arrangenents with AMMHIP and AMLASH, AMAHIP
would see AMLASH off to Zurich fron Kastrup Airport on 12 August, then
take a late afternoon fiflght dom to Paris. As it turned out, however,
AMLASH was able to book a passage on a Rumanian Airlines (Taron) flight
to Prague, via East Berlin's Schoenfeldt Airport. AMWHIP later took
the early evening flight to Paris; we took the 1150 AF flight the sane
night.

In Paris, AMWHIP took a room (#60) as planned at the Hotel :

where he remained throughout his stay in Paris. He also booked a room
for AMLASH, We arrived in Paris at OULS, 16 August, booking a room

15. Events of 13 August 1962.
On the morning of 13 August, we checked into HBFINCH to discuss

the Paria meetings with Peter J. Kymingtoo. thre his good office we were
able to arrange for precautionary surveillance of AMMHIP and AMLASH,
obtain use of a Station safchouse, and effect other arrangements as
necessary. The cooperation and help of the Paris Station was excellent.

Following this meeting, we went to a small bistro near our hotel, phoned

AMAHIP, and arranged for a meeting in our hotel room at 1830.

This meeting took place in our hotel room (#li1) at the Hotel

Roblin, at 1830. The purpose was merely to meet AMHHIP and re-assure him
that arrangements for AMLASH's meeting were laid on. We also made
arrangements to give him his expenses for the trip and account for same : j
during a meeting the following day. This will permit him to leave for soy
Milan without delay at the close of our business with AMLASH. He was i
getting "nervous", as he called it, and will be glad to get this business

over and done. We agreed. He wanted to remain until the conclusions of :
the talke with AMLASH, however, for he felt that he could be of use in
handling AMLASH. We agreed. He did not, of course, want to be in on

any operational discussions, but just to be on hand to guide his : ;
tempermental "charge". : : :

He was very anxious to meet Wallace A. Growerya, in order to
point out to him in advance some of the quirks in AMLASH's personality.
In talicing to us, AMMHIP said that a person with the background of

AMLASH, must be handled in a certain manner, and if done, he will respond.
AMWHIP told us that while he is of course subjective about AMLASH, he also

realised that he is of a different background and make-up (flattery?)
than either we or himself, and that in order to get him to produce and

cooperate, the problem mst be approached in a certain way. He said



that AMLASH is very proud ard andependeni. He does not wane tv feel he has
to take help from anyone. AMWHIP said that this is a rather naive way to i
look at it, but AMLASH does, and for this reason, one must be careful ;
not to appear to be buying him. We said that we understood this, and were
b "willing to advance our arguments in any manner necessary to get AMLASH'a
: cooperation, but that eventually AMLASH mst be made to realize that,
though he is of no little importance to ue, he is after all, the only one
man with one man's resources.
AMWHIP continually stressed the point that to work with people
like AMLASH, it was necessary to have them first accept a person either

by personal contact over a period of time or on the recommendation of a H

good friend. He felt that while it was necessary for us to spend some time

Decoming acquainted with AMLASH, it also might be necessary for Grovery :
to go slow at first. This, we said to AMNHIP was all right, up to a point, ;
but that we felt quite enough time had been spent with AMLASH already, i
and that the meetings in Paris were going to get down to business quickly, i

and proceed as necessary to conclude business as rapidly as possible.

SEYRET SEAT BRIT

We felt that AMWHIP understood our point.

. During this talk, AMMHIP again expressed the feeling that if
Cuba is not returned to freedom within two years, he was going to set
up business permanently in Paris or Southern California, and forget the

idea of returning. He was obvious moved by the finality of such a decision,

as he is a real Cuban patriot. Or so we believe.

We agreed to contact AMWHIP by telephone at his hotel at 1200

on 1h August (Tuesday). Subsequently a meeting at 1700 in our hotel room.

16. Events of 1h August 1962.
As agreed, we called AMAHIP at his hotel at 1200 on 1h August
and arranged a meeting for 1700 in our hotel room. At the 1700 meeting
AMWHIP informed us that AMLASH hac arrived as pranised from Prague about

“noontime, and was already inquiring about a meeting time with "the man

from Washington". AMVHIP was told that "the man from Washington", (whom
they in the future called "Jaime" as they could not readily pronounce
Grovery's true first name) was not able to arrive before that afternoon,
and that a meeting with him could not take place before the 16th. Also,
AMHIP was reminded that he himself had stated that it would be best for
him (AMWHIP) to talk to Jaime first in order to explain AMLASH's personality.
AMMHIP was unhappy that this meeting could not take place immediately,

but said he would explain the matter to AMLASH. This meeting, it 19 noted,
took place initially at a small cafe across the street from our hotel,

80 that we could finger AMWHIP to two surveillants of the Paris Station.
The two principles then retired to our hotel room for the remainder of the
meeting. We said to AMMHIP that we would check in with him by ‘phone the
following day and inform him whether there was any chance of Jaime
arriving on that day, the 15th.

At this meeting, AMMHIP was also paid $350.00 to cover hotel
bills for him and AMLASH in Helsinki, Copenhagen and Stockholm.

15. Events of 1h August 1962.

We phoned AMWHIP at his hotel at 1300 to inform him that there
was no change in plans and that the best we could do was to call him
again that evening. AMWHIP said that he would be out all evening;
arrangements were then made that AMWHIP should call us at our hotel at

him (too early) but he said he could make it.

disclosed that his team had detected what was believed to be surveilance
of AMAHIP and AMLASH. To be positive he planned to have the meeting the
next day surveilled. Growery agreed to come at 0900 for preliminary talks
with AMAHIP.
16. Events of 16 August 1962.

Growery arrived within five minutes of appointed time at
our hotel room. AMWHIP arrived later at 1015, apoligizing for his tardiness
(a late evening!). Breakfast was provided and, after introductory amenities,
the two began their talk, in Spanish. The talks terminated at 1230.
The second meeting of the day was Postponed until 1600, as AMLASH was not
feeling too well.

Later at the Station, rymingtdt-veveslea that he now believed
the morning meeting had been surveilled and that efforts were being made

no Cuban or Soviet exercise, but rather one by one of the French services

to detemmine who was responsible. It was readily established that it was

or local police. Since it was pointless to stop the. meetings now and

the address of the safehouse had not been mentioned verbally, it was

decided to contime as planned. Paris will forward account of surveillance
and outcome as soon as possible. (when we left Paris, it was determined

that this "surveillance" of our meeting might have been a truly freak
coincidence, and the subject of the surveillance was another target, not

us. We don't think so. However the pending Paris report should resolve this.)

Growery and we arrived at the safehouse (19 bis rue Spontini,

AMLASH and AMMHIP arrived. Shortly after introductions, Growery and
AMLASH were tallcing business in Spanish. After about 30 minutes, we took
MGHIP out of tho flat on the pretense of buying food, in order that the
ro princspeg could talk freely. Procuring food and beer, we returned
after a two hour absence, and made a cold supper for the four, The meeting
terminated about 1930, AMLASH and AMMHIP leaving some 15 minutes before
us. Arrangements had been made for a meeting at 1000 the following day
for further talks, and beginning §@ S/W training.

17. Events of 17 August 1962.

At 1000 Growery met with AMLASH for several hours. Arrangements
were made for AMLASH to return to the safehouse fo. S/w training that
afternoon at 1400. (See S/W training report for account of meeting.)
Before breaking up, arrangements were made for a continuation of the Sfa
training the following day.

Kymington and Growery picked us up at Madelaine church at 0600,

and proceeded to rendezvous with AMLASH. Counter-surveillance detected

receiving this instruction. These are not too satisfactory, but neverthe-
less, will be enlarged and forwarded for the files. i
‘The participants met later that evening at 2100 for a drink and
critique and comments of the days activities. AMLASH seemed quite
satisfied with the demonstrations, but was interested in having smaller i
explosive packages with more force, and a remote control method for
detonating them. The meeting was short and broke up at 2200. It was cee

by requirements, and tasks to be performed or looked into upon AMLASH's
return. (See Growery's report for tasks and S/W report for this section
of meeting.) Arrangements for emergency contact in Paris were set up
using the phone of a contract KUBARKER of Paris Station. AMAHIP and

» 26. Miscellaneous Comments on Case, Personalities, and Actions in Paris.

AMLASH's attitude in Paris was essentially that which it had
been during the previous contacts in Scandinavia, that is, changeable as
the weather, varying from occasional flashes of wit and mirth to degrees
Of discouragement and perhaps despondency, He was generally receptive and
interested in procedires and conversations during the meetings and during
periods of instruction. He mikes little attemt to disguise his feelings,
should he became tired, bored, or disinterested. His social graces are
not the sharpest honed. He can, however, be reasoned with, even in some
of his contrary moods. AMWHIP was particularly effective in reaching him
during these. We are in complete agreement with AMMHIP when he describes ‘i
AMLASH as being full of complexes. But further than that, AMLASH not only

has complexes as such, but it is felt that he is generally preoceupied
with his thoughte,presumably about problems Cuban, and is often seemingly i
Ameapable of maintaining his interest in things about him for any length



of time. If one is discussing Cuba, however, he obviously is very _

" interested. Therefore, it might well be that he is actually so pre-
psedsiercebtsa :
occupied with thoughts about problens at hone, that all else is secondary
‘and treated accordingly. When, on occasion, he “opened up” a bit with us,

i At was obvious that he had done, and was doing, a great deal of thinking

: about Cuban problem. It may be that Growery will have mich more to say

on this point, as their discussions were in AMLASH's native tongue. on
many occasions, AMLASH is rather exasperating tc deal with, but we feel
that this is a trait of his which is a normal facht of his personality,
and not assumed to try the metal of his case officers. We may be wrong,
but doubt it.
27. Physical Appearance:
AMLASH is about 5'11", weighs about 175 ibs., dark wavy hair,

thinning noticably on top and usually needs combing; brom
almost peftulant mouth, small nose, pale complexion, eyes are a little

es, small,

small for his face and very intense in expression. He prefers dressing
informally, and is prone to wearing Jackets with no tie. (He could

mingle with the typical small town corner-loungers without difficulty.)

When dressed up, he presents a good appearance in a mascvline way,.and
apparently from AMWHIP's stories, does quite well with the wonen. Concerning

—_

_ the question of his being a homosexual, we cannot say whether he has a
hidden bent in this direction, but if he does, he is not at any rate, a
purist but rather AC-DC. i
28. Language.
Native Spanish, fair to good English, but with limited vocabulary.
He can be successfully conversed with using English, but it has to be
done slowly and with basic constructed sentences. It is not possible to

be articulate with him, if he is expected to rasp the full meaning of the
conversation.

2. Panty.

AMLASH is separated fron his wife, and stated that since he is
going to undertake to work egainst, the regime, he could not go back to her
4f he wanted (which we don't think he does) as she has been too outspoken
in her dislike of the Castro regime and of her desire to get out of Cuba.
AMLASH's mother lives with him as she is divorced from his father.
AMLASH's father is in the tailoring business and has recently married
a girl many years his junior. AMLASH does not approve.

30. Girl Friends.

AMLASH is on good terms with a Pan American stewardess of French
descent who is based in Miami. AMWHIP said to us that he thought she was
with us, but we replied we really aid not know. AMLASH also is friendly
with the Cuban dancer Sonia SaxanoS show he telephoned from Paris to give
the return date to Havana,

31. Pastime:
AMLASH likes nightclubbing and dancing. He is also interested
to a limited degree in architecture and historical buildings and sculpture.
é It is interesting to note that. AMWHIP was reluctant to answer
many questions about AMLASH's private affairs. He felt that this was not
4n good taste (somewhat) and most of the information in this report was
obtained by elicitation rather than direct questions.
32. AMLASH's Original Schedule in Paris.

AMLASH was interested in coming to Paris, executing his business
with us in the first three days, then checking into the Cuba House or a
small hotel on the left bank, and socializing with the Cubans at their
Embassy in Paris. He also wanted to spend some time on the Riviera

as

(several days), as he.felt, or so he told AMHTP, it may be sone time
before he would see this area again. As it turned out, scheduling for
the Growery meetings, S/W training, and plastics demonstraticns precluded
his taking the Riviera trip, and ale-. postponed his seeing his Cuban
friends. He finally went to the Mbassy on Tuesday, 21 August to make
what contacts he felt were necessary. As it turned out, Gramatges and

most of the men were away on vacations, etc., so that his late showing at

the Eubassy was not a problem at all. No plans had been laid on for his

entertainnent by the Embassy, and no one, it turned out, was expecting
him at any definite time after his leaving Prague. He felt mech better,
AMHHIP reported, after he had made the Embassy appearance and learned
the above facts.
33. Money Banked by AMLASH.
At our last meeting with AMWHIP on 23 August, he said that {
AMLASH had given him $500.00 to be banked in Paris or elsewhere against |

allowed AMMHIP to pick up the tabs for the hotel rooms and all expenses

incurred during the trip, including a number of new pieces for his wardrobe,

and the plane tickets to Prague from Paris. AMWHIP said that when they
dined together on 22 August, AMLASH insisted on picking up the tab, stating
that he felt he should get this one, then expressed surprise at the
expense of living in Paris. Neither did AMLASH seem to worry when it was
we who picked up several tabs in Scandinavia. Funny sense of obligations
and finances!
