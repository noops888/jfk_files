CUBAN AUTHORITIES STATE VIEWS CONCERNING DEATH OF KENNEDY

Confidential.

Soon after the death of KENNEDY several authorities and persons

associated with the Cuban Government openly expressed to me their

concern relative to the consequences in regard to Cuba and were

unanimous in believing that any other president would be "even

worse." Another concern of

the Cubans was expounded in the

unexpected speech by FIDEL CASTRO:

on Saturday when he accused the

news agencies of trying to connect the Soviet Union and Cuba to

the crime and asserted that the reactionaries of the United States

are trying to create "a state of anti-Soviet and anti-Cuban

hysteria." Further, yesterday the FÃ¶reign Ministry, in an official

communique confirmed that the indicated assassin tried to obtain

a visa to Cuba without success and'repeated that reactionary sectors

tried, in that way, to involve beforehand Cuba and the Soviet Union

in the events and are trying now to cover up the masterminds and

real motives for the crime.

There was no. official announcement

here of sorrow for the death of the President of the United States.
