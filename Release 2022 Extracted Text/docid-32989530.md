This memorandum reports the results of a meeting

of the Ad Hoc Coordinating Group on Congressional Review of

the Intelligence Community, (hereafter referred to as the

Group), held on 3/7/75.

The Group is chaired by Mr. John Clarke, Associate

Deputy to the Director of Central Intelligence, and is made

up of representatives of agencies and departments having

membership on the United States Intelligence Board (USIB).

Its purpose is to serve as a coordinating mechanism for future

testimony before various Congressional committees..

At the meeting of the Group on 3/7/75 the following

items were discussed:

Congressman Robert McClory has been designated as

I the minority leader of the House Select Committee.

Copies of

the annexes prepared by various members of the Intelligence

Community have been delivered to both the majority and minority

leader of the House Select Committee.

Congressman McClory. is

very security conscious, is concerned that sensitive relation-

ships are not inadvertently disclosed during forthcoming hearings

and according to Mr. John Clarke appears to have no questions

regarding FBI authority to engage in domestic surveillances.

RE:

CONFIDE

Mr. James Wilderotter, Associate Deputy Attorney

General, and Mr. John Warner, General Counsel, CIA, will

have a meeting with the Counsel of the SSC on Tuesday,

3/11/75, to work out precise wording for a Secrecy Agreement

that all members of the SSC staff have agreed to sign.

On 3/10/75 the staff of the SSC will convene to

develop a list of requirements that they expect to levy on

all agencies making up the Intelligence Community.

Mr. Clarke will have some information on these requirements

prior to the time they are levied on the individual agencies.

As a result of Mr. Colby's appearance before the

House Government Information in Individual Rights Subcommittee,

Government Operations Committee, 3/5/75, CIA is getting many,

many, calls from Senators and Congressmen asking how they can

find

out whether CIA has a file on them and what its contents

Mr. Clarke noted that members of the Group should

(anticipate receiving similar calls from Congressmen. (U)

Mr. Hank knocke, who heads up the ClA task force

responsive to the Rockefeller Commission, advised that staff

members of the Rockefeller Commission have been issued CIA

badges, occupy CIA office space, and have authority to

personally contact any CIA employee without clearing such

contact with CIA officials. In addition, the Rockefeller

Commission staff employees

have been granted access to CIA

files.

After reviewing these files, if the staff decides to

make certain portions of the files

matter of official

Commission business, CIA has a right to excise the names of

any sensitive sources. In the event information contained in

these files originates with another Agency of the Government

CiA has insisted and the staff concurs that the originating

Agency must be consulted before such information can be

released to the staff. dE(V)

Mr. Knocke also advised that it is his understanding

that both Mr. Kelley and Mr. Colby will receive in the mail

shortly a request from the Commission to prepare a joint

response covering

the activities of foreign intelligence officials

Wr. Keller asked that in connection with future testimony

we prepare two papers. One is to be a dissertation about our procedures

in opening and closing domestic security cases, including the application

of criteria for opening such cases and determining how long the cases

should remain in a pending status The second paper is to involve the

jurisdiction of the President to authorize unusual investigative techniques

in foreign intelligence investigations such as wiretaps, microphones

and surreptitious entries. This should include a definition of his

Constitutional powers and the derivative authority invested in the Attorney

General and the FBI.

Ill connection with these two papers, it is desired that there be

coordination between the Intelligence Division, Legal Counsel Division

and writers in the External Affairs Division, who should participate in the

basic research and discussions and prepare the final paper outlining the

research and analysis of the other two divisions.

Mr. Kelley's purpose is to have papers available on various topics

such as this which reduce technical dissertations to a style which can be

used for argumentative purposes in an easily understood form.

The types

of questions he receives generally do not require a highly technical response

but a concise presentation of the issues involved and the propriety of our

procedures.

• SeNAte

This Committee Which is chatred by Congresswoman Bella S.

Abzug (D-N. Y.) convened on March 5th to hear testimony from Director of

the CIA, William E. Colby. It was brought out at the hearing that the

¡Central Intelligence Agency had furnished information in their files pertaining

to Congresswoman Abzug the previous evening, March 4th, with the exception

of information which could not be disclosed without compromising a sensitive

source or intelligence gathering procedure. Director Colby also advised

Congresswoman Abzug in response to her inquiry that the source of some

fitems that she was in receipt of had been concealed because it was from

another agency. Colby did not disclose the identity of that agency.

111.110

Congresswoman Abzug asked Colby, and he agreed to

communicate with that agency and have them contact Congresswoman Abzug

concerning the aforementioned information. By way of background according

¡to a memorandum captioned "Bella S. Abzug (D-N. Y.)," dated 3-4-75, the

CIA asked for and received permission from this Bureau to release the PORTIAN OF

contents of unclassified reports furnished the CIA by the FBI and could be

furnished by the CIA to Congresswoman Abzug. From the remarks made

joy Director Coloy, it would appear that the topic or discussion between

Congresswoman Abzug and Director Colby pertained to these documents

and that we can expect some communication from the CIA in accordance

with Congresswoman Abzug's request.

During the question and answer portion of Director Colby's

testimony, Director Colby stated that the CIA would obtain information

Re: HOUSE GOVERNMENT INFORMATION IN

INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS SUBCOMMITTEE

(2) Investigations conducted pursuant to FBI requests. He was asked

what the CIA's response would be to an improper request for investigation

concerning American citizens. He indicated that they would refuse such

a request and had done so in the past. The implication being from the

context of the question that the FBI had made an improper request of

the CIA.

In view of the wide scope of authority enjoyed by

Congresswoman Abzug's Committee and the realistic expectation the

FBI will have to testify before this Committee, it would be to our advantage

for the Intelligence Division, through liaison, with the Central Intelligence

Agency to obtain a transcript of this Committee hearing so that same

might be reviewed and possible questions contained therein concerning

FBI investigations be analyzed and responses prepared.

RECOMMENDATION:

Intelligence Division take action in line with the above.

This meeting was chaired by Mr. Colby in his role as

the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI). In attendance were

Mr. Philip Buchen, Counsel to the President; Deputy AG Laurence

Silberman; Associate Deputy AG James Wilderotter; Mr. John

Clarke, Associate Deputy to the DCI, as well as officials from

Defense, Treasury and the Energy Research and Development

Administration (formerly the Atomic Energy Commission).

The meeting was called to have all agencies identify

(1) Types of information that could not be disclosed to Con-

gressional Committees, (2) Types of information the disclosure

of which was arguable, and (3) Types of information that could

be disclosed to Congressional Committees.

The FBI was asked to

lead off the presentation.

The Group was informed that we were

reluctant to discuss sensitive matters in such a large group

and we asked that the Group be reduced to a select few people

who would have to have knowledge of sensitive FBI operations.

After some discussion, the White House agreed this was a good

procedure and it now appears that Mr. Buchen of the White House,

one of his associates and probably Mr. Silberman will arrange

at some future date to discuss the sensitive type information

embraced in the above three questions.

No definite date was

set for this review and presumably either Mr. Clarke's office

or Mr. Silberman will be in contact with the Bureau regarding

this.

Mr. Mintz made it quite clear to Mr. Wilderotter that

this was not the Bureau's understanding of how the coordination

process would work and was of the belief that no other agency

represented on the Executive Committee was aware of this procedure.

Mx. Wilderotter was asked to develop such a procedure for pre-

sentation to the Group to insure everybody was in agreement as to

how this process would work.

On the morning of 3/21/75, Mr. Clarke advised that

as a result of the meeting during the evening of 3/20/75 he was

attempt to get some clarification and hopefully be in a

position to provide some information as to how the White House,

Mr. Silberman and Mr. Wilderotter wanted to proceed.

It is the opinion of both Mr. Mintz and Mr. Wannall

that the Bureau must immediately set up a Task Force to handle

the tremendous amount of information that will be required

from the FBI, including the coordination of our responses with

other agencies who might be involved in such an answer, as well

as to insure that both the Department of Justice and the White

House are fully informed.

We can anticipate very short deadlines

and requests for information that are not readily retrievable

from Bureau records without considerable research involving

several divisions in the Bureau.

INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY STAFF

20 March 1975

A. RESPONSIBILITIES AND SUPPORT

• In treating with Congressional inquiries, the Director of Central

Intelligence will provide leadership to the Intelligence Community.

The Associate Deputy to the DOI for the Intelligence Community,

supported by the Intelligence Community Staff, will provide the

principal staff direction and congressional liaison for the DCI in these

matters.

He will serve as a focal point for coordination among Community

entities and assure communication with the Executive Office as appropriate.

The IC Staff with the assistance of USIB. Agencies will pravide legal, .

security, substantive, and registry support structured so as to assure

"appropriate support to the DCI and the Intelligence Community. ' The •

AD/DCI/IC will chair an Ad Hoc Coordinating Group of USIB as a

principal mechanism for exchanging information and coordinating USIB

activities with respect to the inquiry where needed. The AD/DCI/IC and

the USIB Ad Hoc Coordinating Group will establish periodic and special

time sensitive reporting to keep the DCI, the USIB principals, and involved

Executive Branch agencies advised on USIB Agencies' liaison relationships

with the Select Committees and on substantive exchanges in response to

Select Committee inquiries. Where usefnl, common standards and procedures

will be developed by the USIB Ad Hoc Coordinating Group.

B. COORDINATION

1. Physical security is proceeding well. The Chairman of the Security

Committee of USIB has been assigned as the principal Intelligence Community

officer on physical security und clearance matters.

Agreements have been

reached with the Senate Select Committee on physical security standards.

These standards have been provided to the House Select Committee Staff.

The Senate has arranged for central facilities which meet the physical

security standards and has appointed a full-time security officer who will

provide certification of personnel clearances. The House at the present

time is not planning central facilities and we understand will be dispersed

in at least three different locations.

Discussion of classified information will occur outside of the

security-approved Committee rooms and particularly in the offices of the

members of the Select Committee. • Agreement has been reached that the FBI

will approach the House and Senate Staff Directors and offer technical sweep

services for the Congressional offices involved.

2. Personnel security investigations on Select Committee Staff are

under way by the FBI. It is understood that upon completion of Staff

investigations, the Select Committee Chairman will certify to the DCI

the Top Secret clearances of Committee Staff. The DCI, through his

Intelligence Community Staff, will pass along the certification to the

security elements of the respective agencies. Compartmented clearance

arrangements and certification also have been agreed with the Senate Select

Committee Staff. Similar arrangements have been discussed with the House

Seleci Committee Staff.

3. Secrecy agreements for the Senate Select Committee Staff employees

are being drafted and the AD/DCI/IC, supported by the CIA General Counsel

and the Associate Deputy Attorney General, will negotiate similar arrange-

ments with the House, The DCI policy is to insist upon secrecy agreements.

4. Arrangements will be established by the USIB Ad Hos Coordinating

Group for the recording of documents, testimony and transcripts, and for

procedures to protect sources and methods which may be contained in the

nutcrial flowing to the Salevi Curuittes frun all agencies. à cenirai

index service will be provided by the Intelligence Community Staff to serve

the DCI and USIB Agencies. The following describes the general content

of this central index.

a. All requests received by USIB Agencies from the Select

Committees.

b.. All other communications from Select Committees on subject v

of interest to more than one agency.

c. Reports and responses by other non-intelligence elements of the

Executive Branch (if desired by those elements).

d. Identification of document responses provided to the requests

and listing of subjects covered.

e.

Prepared

statements and transcripts of testimony made to.

Select Committees.

•f.

Selective material released or denied under the Freedom of

Information legislation which relates to subjects of interest to the

Select Committees:

2

NW 65360 Docld:32989530 Page 19

---

## Page 20

Under this concept, all USIB Agencies would have a reporting

responsibility to keep the central index current.

Procedures will be

developed. All agencies would retain responsibility for the physical

possession and accessibility of their documents. The third agency rule

will apply in providing documents to the Select Committees.

C. PROTECTION AND HANDLING OF MATERIALS

1. It is suggested that in general there are four levels of security

applied to documents supplied to the Committees.

a. The bulk of historical data, organizational directives, budgets,

cash flow, command and control procedures, etc. should be made available

.. to the Committees on request and transmitted by the agencies concerned

directly to the Select Committees. This material will be under the control

of the Select Committèes.. It should be properly classified as appropriate

to assure downgrading under the Freedom of Information Act is consistent

with the judgment of the originating agency.. The agencies will inform the

central registry of the IC Staff of such transmissions and provide a

description of the materials.

The record file will be maintained by the

originating agency so that it may be retrieved if necessary for use by

authorized persons.

b. A second level of material will involve more sensitive data where

sanitization or compartmented arrangements may be desired. Agencies will

be responsible for these determinations. The IC Staff and the USIB Security

Committee will develop general guidelines for application of sanitization

•procedures. Emphasis will be placed on protecting sources and methods

while providing meaningful response and documentation to the Select

Committees. The record copy of all such material will be available in the

originating agencies.

The existence of the original file and its sanitized

version and location will be recorded with the registry. Keys to sanitized

versions will be held by the agencies concerned

copa

c. A third type of material will be made available to Select

Committee members or staff at the originating agency or if desirable at

a central point to be determined. (Facilities for a central reading room

can be established by the IC Staff, if desired.) This material would be

provided in the presence of an authorized representative of the originating

valent eat as alt:

.3

NW 65360 Docld:32989530 Page 20

---

## Page 21

agency. These "fondling" files may have specific limiations placed upon

them by the agencies concerned. Where such search limitations are

determined, they should be consistent with the agreements cortained in the

DCI letter to Senator Church or with ground rules agreed among responsible

agencies or with the Select Committees. The Ad Hoc Coordinating Group

provides one forum for such determinations where interagency discussions

are useful.

A fourth type of material for numerous reasons will not be

available to Select Committee Staff in its raw form, e. g., memoranda to

_or from the President, especially sensitive matters where Executive Branch

prerogatives are involved. This material can be used to prepare briefs or

provide briefings to Select Cornmittee Staff or members bur specific

documentatious normally will not be provided.

If such briefs or briefings

do not satisfy the Select Committees, negotiations will be undertaken with

the Committees. The DCI should be kept adyised in all such instances.

Normally, if after negotiations there is provision of raw. data, such data

will be hand-carried to the Committees and read by the Committee or

strtimembora in the presence of an authorized representative of the

originating agency as in c. above. This shall be made a matter of record

by memorandum of the originating agency to the DCI and recorded in the

IC registry along with the ground rules negotiated with the committees

and the agencies in their negotiations.

These ground rules will normally

be an agenda item on the Ad Hoc Coordinating Group agenda.

2. Testimony given in informal interview with Select Committee Staff

will be recorded normally in a memorandum of record and filed in the agency

concerned. Employees not wishing to report such testimony are free from

doing so. Notification will be given to the IC central index of the existence

of the file, its location and access rules. • To the degree possible, the

registry will cross-reference all materials provided the Committees and will

prepare current reports on such materials.

D. LEGAL SUPPORI AND QUALITY CONTROLS

1. The Intelligence Community Staff has several lawyers who will be

assigned to provide support to legal matters relating to this inquiry. The

leader of this group will be expected to have regular consultation with the

4

NW 65360 Docld:32989530 Page 21

---

## Page 22

General Counsels of all USIB Agencies and the Department of Justice,

the NSC, the OMB, and other Executive Branch elements involved in the

inquiry. Since the inquiry can résult in the introduction of legislation,

the IC Staff lawyers will also provide to the DCI appropriate legal briefs

for his use. The recording of these briefs will also be made by the.

central index. The lawyers will also assist the DCI and USIB in ensuring

that the Select Committees' procedures are developed in consideration

of the legal and constitutional position of the USIB agencies and employees

thereof.

2. We can anticipate the Select Committees will have 40-50 staff

personnel involved in the inquiries and that they will normally proceed

directly to the agencies concerned within their functional areas of interest.

Cross agency activity coordination and substantive comparisons will occur

within the Select Committees' siaffs.. It is in the interest of the USIB

Agencies to assure equally good coordination between and among the

members and Executive Branch elements as appropriate in the material

and testimony provided and that a general quality control of the product

is exercised. The Ad Hoc Coordinating Group provides the forum for keeping

USIB Agencies informed on responses provided in the course of the inquiry

and avoiding surprise. Further, the IC Staff will establish a small quality

control and evaluative function and be alert to the indicators available as

the investigations proceed of potential actions or further inquiries that could

derive from materials or testimony provided by the various agencies.

3. There will be a range of "skeletons" and allegations which may

surface in the course of the inquiry. USIB Agencies will seek to assure that

all the facts are found and addressed so as to be responsive to the Select

Committee inquiry and in consideration of the Administration.

E. ALLEGATIONS AND PUBLICITY

1. The nature of the investigation will undoubtedly continue to afford

considerable public discourse. Many press allegations will cause further

inquiry. A system to check the veracity of such allegations should bẹ .

established by each SiB Agency.

The IC Staff will also undertake to

-

monitor press allegations and discuss them with the agencies involved

as appropriate.

NW 65360 Docld:32989530 Page 22

---

## Page 23

2. Senator Church intends to provide the press with commentary on

selective testimony or facts pertaining to the inquiry. He has advised that

he will clear with the Director these releases, to avoid inadvertent disclosure

harmful to U.S. intelligence agencies. Review of such releases will be

undertaken by the IC Staff in concert with appropriate agencies.

• 3. In preparing statements or testimony to be given in open or closed

hearings, senior intelligence officials should avail themselves of all

previous related testimony or material furnished by other sources.

4. The DCI, through his IC Staff, will assure regular consultation with

Executive Branch agencies on press matters and take steps to fostér good

communication between USIB entities and political officials.

Notification of all inquiries from press officials to intelligence

agencies concemed should be provided to the IC Staff and a record of these

inquiries maintained in the central registry.

PooSEYIuT

This norning, in accordance with the request of the President

conveyed to ue personally by him last Wednesday In New York City, I calleà

at the thite House at 9:15 and was with the President until 10:15.

He

was desirous of discussing the question of the suoversive

activities in the United States, particularly Fascism ard Communisi. He

had previously received the menorandun which I had prepared covering my

• conversation with General Snedley Butler and the effort of Father Coughlin

•In hava General Butler head an expedition to Mexico. I informei the Presidert

concerning certain recent developments in the Commnist activities in the

country, particularly the efforts of the Bridges orgsnization in Sen Fran-

cisco and their progressive control of the shipping on the Pacific Coast,

the Gulf Coast and their recent expansion to shipping operations on the

Atlantio-Coast. I told lin maù vuile heir contretut will expire on

Septenber 30, 1936, they are endeavoring to have it temporarily extended

until April 1, 1937, in order to conforn to the same date that the united

Mine Morkers' contract expires, which organization 1s headed by John L.

Lowls. I told him that the Bridges organization as practically controlled

by Connunists and that the Commnists had non decided to make very definita

plans to get control of the Lenis organization.

I called his attention to the activitiss of the Newspaper Guild

headed by Heywood Brows, hich has strong Commnistic leanings, and which

has been responsible for putting out of operation the Seattlo Post Intei-

ligencer. I told him that uy inforuation mas that the Communists had plarned

to get control of these three groups and by doing so they would be able at

any time to paralyze the country in that they could stop all shipping in

and out through the Bridges organization; stop the operation of industry

through the Mizing Union of Lewis; and stop publication of any newspapers

of the country tarough the Nenspaper Guild.

I also related to him the activities which have recently oc-

curred within Govermental service inspired by Commuists, particuiarly

in some of the Departuents and in the National Labor Relations Board.

I likewise informed him that I had received information to the

effect that the Connunist Internationale in Moscow has recently issued in-

structions for all Communists in the United States to vote for President

Roosevelt for reelection and against Governor Landon because of the fact

that Governor Landon is opposed to class warfare.

The President stated that he had been considerably concerned

about the movements of the Communists and of Fascism in the United States

and thai while the Secret Service of the Treaswry Department had assured

him that they had informants in every Communist group, he believed that

i that was true it was solely for the purpose of getting any infornation

upon plots upon his life, whereas what he was interested in was obtaining

a broad picture of the genaral movement and its activities as may affect the

econonic and political life of the country as a mole. I told him that there

is at the present time no governmental organization waich is getting any

so-called "general intelligence information" upon this subject.

He inquired

what suggestions i might ofter relative to this matter. I toiù hin inai

the appropciation of the Federal Bureau of Investigation contains a provi

sion that it might investigate any matters referred to it by the Department

of State and that if the State Department should ask for us to conduct such

an investigation ve could do so under ou precent autority in the apar

priation aiready granted.

He stated that he is reluctant to have a lormal

request come through the State Department because of the nary leaks therein,

but that what he would do would be to puù a handritten memorandum of his

of State to request this information to be obtained by the Department of

Justice. He stated he would have the Secretary of State at the White House

tomorrow afternoon, and asked me to call at the White House at 1:45 p.n.

to see him, the President, and the Secretary of State, at which time the

matter could be further discussed and an oral request could be made or me

by the Secretary of State for investigation so as to avoid any possibility

of any leak.

He suggested that I endeavor to coordinate any investigation

along similar lines which might be made by the military or Naval Intelligence

services.

He stated that the Secret Service was not being brought in on this

investigation as they should contine themselves strictly to the natuer or

protecting his life and the survey which he desired to have made was on a

much broader field.

Poday, in line with the request of the President, I called at the

White House at 1:45 p.m., and present at the conference were

the President,

the Secretary of Staue and myseli.

The President related to the Secretary of

State his concern relative to Cominist activities in this country, as well as

*Fascist activities. He stated that he was very desirous of having a survey

made of these conditions and inforned the Secretary of State that this survey

could be made by the Department of Justice if the Secretary of State requested

the Department to conduct the inquiry, as under the Appropriation Act this

Bureau would have authority to make such investigation il asked to do so by

the Secretary of State.

The President poinied out that both of these nove-

ments were international in scope and thai Communisn particularly was directed

from Moscow, and that there had been certain indications that Oumansky, at

¿ached to the Russian Soviet Erbassy, was a leading figure in some of ühe

activities in this country, so consequently, it was a matter which feli witzr

the scope of foreign affairs over which the State Departnent would have a righ

to request an inquiry to be made.

writing.

the Presidant incicated that i should not me since he desired the

matter to be handled quite confidentially and that it woula be sufficient thai

ine President, the Secretary of State and I should be the ones aware of this

request.

The Secretary of State asked that the investigation be made and then

made several suggestions - one, relative to the making of a protest, either

formally or informally, to the Russian Government relative to its interference

with affairs in this country.

Discussion was also had as to the information

obtained indicating that the

Third Internationale had indicated preference fos

Roosevelt as against Landon.

It was the opinion of the President that some

statement shoula be made along this line by the Attorney General at an early

date.

The President asked that I speak to the Attorney General, upon his re-

turn to the city, about this matter, and he suggested to the Secretary of

State that he talk over the technique to be followed in this particular aspect,

with the Attorney leneral.

Although the bulk of criminal offenses occurring

In the course of recent riots have been

In view of

It is most important that you use the maximum available

resources, investigative and intelligence,

to collect

There persists,

however, a widespread beller that

there is more organized activity in the riots than i€

presently know about.' We must recognize, I believe, that

this is a relatively new area of investigation and intelli-

This memorandum reports that on the morning of

3/24/75 Mr. John Clarke, Chairman of the Ad Hoc Coordinating

Group on Congressional Review of the Intelligence Community,

telephonically advised Section Chief William O. Cregar, the

Bureau's representative on this Group,

that the Senate Select

Understanding, entitice "ClA operate ii in the United Siktas,"

We have previously received requests from the House

Appropriations Committee as well as the Rockefeller Commission

for copies of the FBI - CIA Understanding dated 2/7/66.

Deputy AG Laurence Silberman authorized the

release of the FBI - CIA Understanding to the House Appropria-

tions Committee as welT as the Rockefeller Commission.

On the morning of 3/24/75 Mr. John Clarke telephonically

advised that CIA has received a request from the SSC to provide

the SSC with a copy of the FBI - CIA Understanding. Inasmuch as

we have previously provided a copy of this Understanding to

another Congressional committee, it would appear that we have no

choice but to furnish a copy of

this Understanding to the SSC;

however, clearance should be obtained from Deputy AG Silberman.

Inasmuch as a timely response to the SSC is desired,

it would appear reasonable for the Legal Counsel Division to

telephonically inquire from Mr. Silberman whether he interposes

any objection to CIA furnishing a copy of the Understanding to

the SSC.

If oral authority is obtained, the Intelligence Division

will confirm such authority

from the deputy ad in writing.

This memorandum reports the results of a meeting

of the Ad Hoc Coordinating Group on Congressional Review of

the intelligence

Community, (hereafter referred to as the

Group), held on 3/14/75.

AISBYTOMLSI ITTACH

The Group is chaired by Mr. John Clarke, Associate

Deputy to the Director of Central Intelligence, and is made

up of representatives of agencies and departments having

membership on the United States Intelligence Board (USIB).

Its purpose is to serve as a coordinating mechanism for future

testimony before various Congressional committees.

At a meeting of the Group on 3/14/75 the following

items were discussed:

Freedom of Information:

Mr. Clarke asked all agencies to report on the

volume of requests that are received under the Freedom of

Information Act.

The CIA representative pointed out that

as of 3/10/75 CIA had received 93 requests. Since 3/10/75

the requests are averaging approximately 50 per day. The

National Security Agency has received approximately 35 requests.

None of the other agencies reported any high volume of requests

and those requests that had been received did not impact on

the Intelligence Community

Security Arrangements:

REG382-116-595-4

CIA's Director of Security, Mr. Charles Kane, and

the Chairman of the USIB Security Committee, Ma, Donäld E.-Mpore,

have met with Mr. Ben Marshall, Security Offider for the Senate

Select Committee (SSC), and are encouraged by the physical and

document security arrangements the SSC intends to employ. Attached

is a letter from Senator Church to Mr. Colby Expressing Senator

Church's appreciation for the help provided by Mr. Colby's staff

in developing security precautions.

Memorandum for Mr. Wannall

RE:

SENSTUDY 75

The FBI - CIA 1966 Understanding:

Mr. Clarke advised that the Rockefeller Commission

requested

a copy of the FBI - CIA Understanding of 1966 and

inquired whether one could be made available to the Commission.

I advised Mr. Clarke that we had made the 1966 Understanding

available to Congressional committees and I saw no reason why

a copy of the Understanding could not be furnished to the

Rockefeller Commission but I would have to defer to deputy AG

Silberman (also in attendance). Mr. Silberman said by all means

we would have to respond to the Rockefeller Commission and he

authorized Clarke to furnish a copy of the Understanding to

the Rockefeller Commission.

Clearances for Staff Members of the SSC:

Attached hereto is a copy of a letter to the Staff

Director of the SSC from Mr. Clarke outlining procedures for

the certification of clearances granted to SSC staff members.

As an enclosure to this attachment is a suggested format which

the SSC could use in certifying that staff members who have

received a security iñvestigation by the FBI meet the require-

ments of Executive Order 10450 for access

tion up to and including "Top Secret." A second enclosure to

Clarke's letter to Miller contains a copy of Director of Central

Intelligence Directive (DCID) 1/14 which sets up the Uniform

Personnel Security Ständards and Practices Governing Access to

Sensitive Compartmented Information.

Clearances for access to

compartmented information are the responsibility of CIA and

such

clearances will be issued to select members of the SSC on a

"need-to-know" basis.

Staff Members on Whom Substantial Derogatory Information is

Developed:

Mr. Clarke asked if I could describe for the Group

what procedures had been worked out with Senator Church when

information was developed of a significant derogatory nature

regarding potential staff employees. I advised the Group that

upon such a determination a Bureau official would bring the

written results of the investigation personally to the

attention of Senator Church or his Staff Director.

Follow-

ing that a copy of this investigation would be made available

to Mr. Colby as the Director of Central Intelligence and that

Senator Church or the Staff Director would welcome any comments

from Mr. Colby as to the security ramifications attendant to

the employment of this person.

Mr. Clarke agreed this was a

very desirable procedure and the Group fully endorsed this

arrangement.

Organization of the SSC:

Attached is Mr. Clarke's understanding of how the

ISSC will be organized. It is noted it will be broken down into

four Task Forces, each

with a Task Force Director, a lawyer or

lawyers assigned, each with several researchers.

As noted from

this enclosure,

Task Force three concerns domestic activities

including the FBI and those parts of the CIA that relate to

domestic matters. Army counterintelligence activities may also

come under the cognizance of this Task Force.

Staffing for Task

Force number three is still in process and no Task Force Director

has yet been appointed.

CIA Secrecy Agreement and Employee Bulletin:

Attached hereto is a letter to Senator Church from

Mr. Colby designed to relieve current CIA employees from any

obligation of secrecy. It is noted all CIA employees sign a

Secrecy Agreement as a

prerequisite to employment. Also attached

is a copy of an Employee Bulletin, dated 3/12/75, advising CIA

employees as to the procedures he

should follow if he is selected

to be interviewed by a member of the SSC or its staff.

It is to

be noted that both the Employee Bulletin and Colby's letter to

Senator Church were reviewed by the White House and the Department

of Justice.

RE:

CIA Requirements Received from the SSC:

Attached herewith is a letter from Senator Church

to Mr. Colby enclosing the initial request for CIA documents

for transmittal to the SSC.

According to Mr. Clarke, It is

his understanding that similar requests if not already received

are being prepared by the SSC for other members of the Group.

Executive Session:

At the conclusion of the formal meeting, Mr. Clarke

asked for an executive meeting to include the following persons:

Deputy AG Laurence Silberman,

Associate Deputy AG James Wilderotter;

Mr. Philip Buchen, Counsel to the President; Mr. Chamberlain,

Inspector General, CIA; Mr. Thomas Latimer, Department of Defense

and myself.

According to Mr. Clarke the purpose of this meeting

was to develop strategy as to how the Group would respond to

the anticipated requests from the SSC. Both Mr. Buchen of

the White House and Mr. Silberman, acting in his capacity as the

President's Counsel

for Congressional Inquiries, insisted that

all requests as well as the responses to all

such requests be

coordinated through the above Group. Much discussion was had as

to how this could be accomplished.

No definitive decision was

arrived at.

However, it was agreed that the CIA would prepare

a paper outlining how they would respond to the questions that

they had already received, defining the level of response, the

area of coordination and identification of sensitive problems.

It was not quite clear to the Group as to exactly what form CIA's

what to

paper would take. It was proposed by Mr. Buchen and agreed that

the same Executive Group would meet at CIA Headquarters on 3/19/75

to review the paper developed by CIA.

In view of the various legal questions involved and

because of the direct involvement of Congressional committees,

the question of the Bureau's representation was discussed with

Mr. Adams.

It was agreed that in addition to Mr. Cregar, the

Bureau would be represented by Assistant Director Mintz.

This

(proposal was discussed with Mr. Clarke and he readily agreed that

certainly Mr. Mintz' presence would be a valuable asset to the Group.

RE: SENSTUDY 75

As a result, Mr. Mintz and Mr. Cregar will attend the meeting

of the Group on Wednesday, 3/19/75, at CIA Headquarters, at

10:30 a.m.

Senator Towers had requested the Bureau to conduct

a counteraudio sweep of his personal office inasmuch as he

anticipated having sensitive conversations in his office: con-

cerning the business of the SSC.

Mr. Cregar was asked to raise

the question of a counteraudio sweep during the executive session

to get an expression from the Group as to whether counteraudio

sweeps should be done.

Both Mr. Silberman and Mr. Buchen felt

it was desirable to conduct such sweeps and strongly recommended

that they be done.

No commitment was made as to who would do

the sweeps at the

However, after consultation with Assistant

Directors Wannall and White, Mr. Adams and Mr. Callahan, it was

agreed that the Bureau should do the sweeps inasmuch as it was

a domestic matter.

Mr. White indicated that he did

have the

personnel and the equipment to conduct such sweeps. As a result

of that decision Mr. Clarke was telephonically advised that the

Bureau would conduct counteraudio sweeps of the personal offices

of both the Senate and House Select Committees providing such

was in accord with the desires of both Committees. Our Legisla-

tive Liaison is currently contacting both Senator Church and

Congressman Nedzi to confirm that both Committees desire this

Dear Mr. Colby:

On behalf of the Senate Select Committee To Study Governmental

Operations With Respect to Intelligence Activities, I want to thank

your for your letter of March Il, and the copy of the Employee Bulletin

you have issued to all CIA employees. As we jointly recognize, in

order for the committee to carry out a thorough inquiry, in accordance

with the mandate contained in S. Res. 21, the Agency's full cooperation

will be necessary. Your recognition that our mandate authorizes all,

past and present, agency employees to cooperate fully, and without

impediment due to secrecy agreements, will serve to facilitate our

expeditious collection of material relative to that mandate.

I particularly appreciate your statement recognizing our security

precautions. As you know, your

staff was very helpful to the Committee's

staff in designing those precautions.

The Staff Director and the Chief Counsel will; under the direction

of the Committee, notify Mr. John Clarke of the members of the Committee

who have been designated to carry out studies, inquiries and investigations

required to meet the tasks specified in S. Res. 21.

It is the Committee's understanding that the members of the Committee

and designated staff will have access to any and all information which

the Committee determines is necessary for its inquiry. We recognize,

however, that the committee inquiry may touch on sensitive areas, such

as the identity of ClA personnel, sources, or cooperating organizations

whose disclosure could place persons in actual jeopardy.

In the event

that the Committee inquiry touches on such sensitive areas, which matters

we have already discussed in our meeting of February 27, we should discuss

jointly, and as you suggest quickly, what procedures might be followed

should the Committee decide it requires more information in these specific

areas.

and/ or the Committee will take action to grant or deny clearance.

The next step requires a notification to the Director of Central

Intelligence of the Chairman's decision and certification of the clearances

granted. I've attached a suggested format for this which you could use.

On receipt of the certification we will advise the USIB security elements

of the people so certified.

I also promised to go over with you the range of compartmented

clearances that exist and I am prepared to do that when we next get

together. You will recall these are the clearances for which you will

want to determine the "need-to-know'' for selected members of your

staff. We need to establish agreed procedures here as well. Access to

this information requires that an individual meet security standards set

forth in DCID 1/14, a copy of which is attached.

I would like to suggest that you appoint a member of your staff - say,

Ben Marshall - as a focal point for handling compartmented information

access approvals and assign him the responsibility of insuring that these

security standards are met by persons selected to participate in this

sensitive area.

The CIA operates a Compartmented Information Branch as a service

of common concern to the intelligence community which records the names

of all individuals in the Government with access to compartmented information.

Your personnel would be similarly recorded which would considerably ease

the access certifications to all organizations for the duration of your inquiry.

As indicated, I am prepared to discuss this with you at any time.

the manner, methods and operational details by which sensitive com-

parimented information is collected. The standards and practices estab.

lished herein are to be considered minimal and the departments and

agencies may establish internally such additional security steps as may

be considered necessary and appropriate to ensure that eftective security

is maintained. "Access to sensitive compartmented information shall be

the protection of the national interest is paramount.. Any doubt con-

- cerning personnel having access to sensitive compartmented information

shall be resolved in favor of the national security. The ultimate deter-

mination of whether the granting of access is clearly consistent with the

interests of national security shall be an over-all common sense deter-

mination based on all available information.

Security Programs

13. In order to facilitate the attainment of the highest standard of

personnel security and to augment both the access approval criteria and

the investigative requirements established by this Directive, member

departments and agencies shall institute continuing Security Programs

for all individuals having access to compartmented information. In

addition to security indoctrinations, these programs shall be tailored to

create mutually supporting procedures under which no issue will escape

notice or be left unresolved which brings into question an individual's

"loyalty and integrity or suggests the possibility of his being subject to

undue influence or duress through foreign relationships or exploitable

personal conduct. When an individual is assigned to perform sensitive

compartmented work requiring access to sensitive compartmented infor-

mation and operations, the department, agency or Government program

to which he is assigned shall assume a continuing security and counter:

intelligence responsibility for that individual throughout the period of

his assignment.

14. The Security Programs shall include the following:

a. Security Education Programs to ensure that individuals who are

granted access to sensitive compartmented information are initially

and periodically thereafter indoctrinated as to its unique sensitivity

and that they understand their personal responsibility for its protec-

tion. These indoctrinations should be conducted by individuals having

vulnerabilities of the particular type of compartmented information

involved.

b. Security Supervisory Programs to ensure that supervisory per-

sonnel recognize and discharge their special responsibility. for main-

taining the security of sensitive information. Such programs shall

provide practical guidance as to indicators whick may signal matters

of security concern. Specific instructions concerning reporting pro-

cedures shall be disseminated to enable the appropriate authority to

states as well as to provide all necessary helpito the individual con-

cerned to neutralize his vulnerability.

information bearing on the security posture of persons having access

- to sensitive information. Personnel history information shall be kept

review.a Departments and agencies shall develop security programs

under which at intervals no greater than 5 years, checks are made

: with the Federal Bureau of Investigation as well as all relevant police

and credit sources and, where feasible, each individual is given a per

sonal interview by trained security or counterintelligence personnel

15. Whenever indicated during the course of these Security Programs,

appropriate investigations shall be conducted on a timely basis. ""In the.

absence of such indication the tempo of additional investigation shall be

tailored by the adjudicating agency to the circumstances surrounding

the individual under consideration as well as the breadth of knowledge

and degree of sensitivity involyed in his access. The investigation shall

be sufficient in scope to ensure that continued utilization of the individual

in activities requiring sensitive compartmented information is clearly

consistent with the interests of the national security.

Personnel Security Standards and Practices for Access to Sensitive Com-

partmented Information. This policy shall become effective as soon as

practicable after approval of this Directive but in no case later than

other references governing access to sensitive compartmented informa

tion as defined herein shall be revised accordingly.

Aim STE

The Organization of the Senate Select Committee - Rough Structure

The Committee will organize into four Task Forces - each with a Task

Force Director, each with a lawyer or lawyers assigned and each with

several researchers. Total professionals - 30/40.

Task Force One - Foreign Intelligence

This will deal with the CIA as a line Agency and with the institution of

the Director of Central Intelligence in his responsibility under NSCID #1.

USIB intelligence entities, i.e., State, Treasury, ARC and the military

establishments collecting, processing or producing foreign intelligence

will be reviewed in this context as well. CIA covert action is also covered here.

They plan to begin' with basic papers being prepared on USIB agencies

their missions, functions, organizations and general contribution so as to

provide the Committee with a "sound understanding on the role, nature,

performance and structure of intelligence looking toward legislation which

would address national intelligence needs, and provide adequate oversight

of national and defense intelligence entities and their relationships in

foreign policy generally!" William Bator is designated the Task Force

Director.

Task Force Two - Military Intelligence

This Task Force will deal with the organizational entities within the

Department of Defense collecting, processing, of producing intelligence

including the DIA, the Services Agencies, and the National Security Agency,

the NRO, and other collection entities such as AEDS, Attaches, etc. The

interrelationships between Task Force One and Task Force Two according

to the Staff Director will be accommodated by regular communication among

the Select Committee staff and be addressed by the Committee in the broader,

context of considering possible legislation for alternative structures. The

staffing for this Task Force is still in process and no Task Force Director

has yet been appointed.

NW 65360. Docld:32989530 Page 62

## Page 63

Task Force Three - Domestic Activities

This Task Force will concern itself with intelligence organizations

engaged in domestic activities and including the FBi, those parts of the

CIA that relate to domestic matters, and possibly Army counterintelligence

activities. The staffing for this Task Force is still in process and se

Task Force Director has yet been appointed.

Task Force Four - Executive Branch Command and Control

This Task Force will be concerned with the tasking of the intelligence

community - its oversight, the use of intelligence, and the adequacy

thereof and mesh with the DCI's role as principal intelligence advisor to

the President.

It will treat with the National Security Council's activities,

functions, and

structure. It will address the variety of sub-committees

thereunder as well as the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Boar&

(PFIAB). David Aaron will be the Task Force Director. Note: Covert

Action direction and oversight is also included herein.

The Staff Director has indicated that the Committee is interested in dealing

with Agencies and documents therefrom in the most efficient fashion consistent

with security and economy of time.

He is not committed at this time to any

particular procedure. He has stated a desire to work selectively inside the

Agencies where access and screening of selective records could take place.

He wishes to avoid shipping in loads of data to the Committee.

The Honorable Frank Church

Chairman

Select Committee to Study Governmental

Operations with Respect to Intelligence

Activities

United States Senate

Washington, D. C. 20510

Dear Mr. Chairman:

This letter will confirm and reduce to writing some

of the matters agreed upon at our recent meeting.

At the outset, I should like to express my deep

personal appreciation for the candor and helpfulness of

you and Senator Tower in that meeting and for your

sensitivity to the respective responsibilities under our

Constitutional framework of the Select Committee and the

Central Intelligence Agency in the area of your review.

For my part, I should like to renew again, for myself and

the CIA, my promise of cooperation with respect to the

important work of the Select Committee. In my judgment,

a spirit of good faith and cooperative effort is not only

necessary to enable your Committee to discharge its

responsibilities fully and expeditiously, but is indeed in

the best interests of the intelligence community as well.

I am convinced that a responsible and thorough review of

U.S. intelligence activities will serve to vindicate the

CIA and enhance the public's understanding of the important

contribution that the intelligence efforts of this nation

can make toward the goal of preserving and strengthening

our democracy.

I am particularly appreciative of your recognition

that certain sensitive aspects of our intelligence

activities must receive special consideration and treatment

by the Select Committee in the course of your work. As we

discussed, such matters as the identities of our sensitive

sources, the material provided to us by cooperating foreign

intelligence services, the details of technical devices and

systems and o1 operational methods, the identitles of certain

of our employees

who could be targets of kidnapping or

assassination, the identities of American citizens and

organizations

who have cooperated with U.S. intelligence, and

some additional materials the public disclosure of which would

create serious foreign policy or national security problems,

should be protected not only from exposure, but indeed from

that hot only to as

the risk of exposure. We should also work together to protect

certain other information which, if improperly disclosed,

might impair the privacy rights of individuals.

Where these

kinds of considerations are present, I anticipate that appro-

priate understandings can be arrived at to avoid the risk of

exposing such matters and at the

same time to satisfy the

Select Committee's need for a full understanding of our

activities.

As I stated to you, employees of the Central Intelligence

Agency will be available to the Select Committee for staff

interviews and for testimony. As we have discussed, this

might require, in some circumstances, special arrangements to

protect the identity of particular employees whose physical

safety or future career might be placed in jeopardy by exposure.

I anticipate that suitable safeguards can be established to

avoid such dangers.

I assume the Committee will make its own

arrangements with respect to ex-employees as to whom I no

longer have the authority to direct their cooperation.

However,

I am available for whatever assistance I can provide in this

regard.

As you are aware, all employees of the Central Intelligence

Agency are required to sign a secrecy agreement when they enter

on duty.

This is a condition of employment, and it requires

that they keep forever secret all classified information gained

during the course of their employment.

The secrecy agreement

further requires that they may not disclose classified informa-

tion, either orally or by publication, without prior authoriza-

tion

• from the Director of Central Intelligence.

Under the

secrecy agreement, an employee's obligations with respect to

the protection of classified information continue after his

employment with the CIA has been terminated.

NW 65360 Docld:32989530 Page 65

---

## Page 66

-3-

It is my desire that the secrecy agreements signed by

our employees shall not impair the necessary work of the

Select Committee.

To accomplish this, and in recognition

of the security protection contemplated by the select

Committee, I have determined that disclosure of otherwise

protected

information to the Select Committee or its designated

staff members will constitute an authorized provision of infor-

mation within the meaning of the secrecy agreements. This

letter may be used to indicate such authorization for any

Agency employee or ex-employee to furnish information to

the Select Committee or appropriate staff members on matters

which would otherwise be covered by their secrecy agreement,

but which are not among the particularly sensitive matters

such as mentioned above.

With respect to those particularly

sensitive matters, different procedures are obviously neces-

sary.

Accordingly, where

any matter included in these sensi

tive categories would be involved in responding to the Com-

mittee, the employee should express his concern and, if

possible, propose a way of responding to the Committee without

exposing

such sensitive details.

If the Committee believes

that a disclosure of those aspects is nevertheless necessary,

the matter will be discussed between the Committee and the

Agency.

I am prepared to consult with the Committee at any

time to avoid difficulties in this area and quickly determine

together the appropriate course of action to be taken.

With the good faith evident in our discussions on these

matters, I believe that these arrangements will enable me to

discharge my responsibilities to protect intelligence sources

and methods from unauthorized disclosure, while at the same

time to provide the Select Committee with all the information

it needs to accomplish its task.

As we have agreed, it is in the national interest as well

as that of the Select Committee and the U.S. intelligence

I have in-

structed all CIA personnel to respond in a spirit of coopera-

tion.

Sincerely,

w. E. Colby

Senate Select Committee To Review

U.S. Intelligence Activities

Senate Resolution 21 established a Select Committee of the

Senate to review U.S. intelligence activities. The Resolution calls

for a comprehensive review of the total U.S. intelligence effort

and is not restricted to the recent charges and allegations against

CIA alone. Consequently, it is likely to be far-ranging in its impact.

It is in all of our interests to see that the Select Committee

receives full understanding of our activities and their contribution

to the country as expeditiously as possible. I have every confidence

that the inquiry will be responsible, and constructive, and will pro-

duce new understanding of, and improvements in, the American

intelligence system.

It is with this conviction that I have pledged my personal coop-

eration and that of the CIA. I have advised Senators Church and Tower,

the Committee Chairman and Vice Chairman, that employees of the

CIA will be available to the Select Committee for Staff interviews and

for testimony. We are working with the Committee Staff to design

procedures to facilitate their work in examining topics of concern.

Attached to this bulletin is a letter which I have sent to Senator

Church. To facilitate the necessary work of the Committee and in

recognition of the security protection contemplated by the Committee,

I have determined that disclosure of otherwise protected information

to the Select Committee or its designated Staff members will constitute

authorized provision of information within the meaning of the Secrecy

Agreements signed by each CIA employee, subject to the special proce-

dures and limitations set forth in the letter regarding particularly

sensitive matters. Senator Church has agreed that reference to sensi-

tive data in any Committee report will be subject to consultation between

the Committee and the Agency.

NW 65360 Docld:32989530 Page 67

## Page 68

The cooperative spirit of our relationship with the Committee

and its Staff must at the same time take account of the rights of

Agency employees. The Committee Staff has agreed to advise

employees of their Constitutional rights at the beginning of any

interview or other appearance.

When a current Agency employee is selected to be interviewed

by the Select Committee Staff, the Staff Director or Chief Counsel

will normally notify Mr. John M. Clarke, who is my principal

liaison with the Committee and its Staff.

Mr. Clarke, in turn, will

notify the employee. The purpose of this is in no way to inhibit the

work of the Committee. It is intended to allow time for the employee

to gain general legal guidance if he wants it, and to obtain security

guidance from an appropriate senior officer.

My own belief is that after a careful review of all U.S. intelli-

gence activities, the Committee will address needed legislative

changes and will reaffirm their confidence in the importance and

contribution of U.S. intelligence programs.

REQUEST FOR DOCUMENTS AND INFORMATION

TO :

The Director of Central Intelligence and the Central Intelligence

FROM:

Agency

The Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with

Respect to Intelligence Activities

Guidelines

1. The attached request is not intended to call for a general file search

of the Agency.

Rather it is intended to call for various significant documents

available in the upper levels of the Agency. Without foreclosing any further

file review that may seem appropriate to agency personnel familiar with agency

files, we would suggest the following offices (current and past files) as likely

sources for initial review:

(i) The U.S. Intelligence Board staff and ICS

(11) Offices of the Director and the Deputy Director/CIA

(111) Offices of the General Counsel and Legislative Counsel/CIA

2. The requests are addressed to the Director, both in his capacity as

Director of the Central Intelligence Agency and as Director of Central Intelligence

and Chief Executive of the United States Intelligence Board.

3. Rather then waiting until all materials are available, it would be helpful

if any particular group is produced when ready.

4.

As previously discussed, please advise if there are categories of material

where it would be appropriate for Committee staff members to review called for .

material on the Agency premises in order to cull out the most pertinent materials.

5.

The request covers documents in the covered offices wherever originated

(including other departments or agencies). If any document referred to is believed

by the Agency to be in the possession only of another agency or department, advice

to that effect plus an indication that the Agency would not object to its being

made available to the Committee, would facilitate an expeditious inquiry.

REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

I.

OUTSTANDING RE

ASTS

The Agency has agreed to provide the Committee with (1) charts indicating

the organizational history of the CIA; (2) identification of headquarters per-

sonnel; and (3) budgetary and cash flow information. The following is a further

elaboration of the kind of material in each of these categories which is necess-

ary for the Committee's basic understanding of the Agency:

Organization Charts and Personnel - The charts reflecting CIA organizational

history down to the Branch level should be accompanied by annotations or a nar-.

rative explaining when particular units were formed, merged, expanded or abolished.

The narrative should also indicate any changes in lines of authority, reporting

responsibilities,

and functions for each unit.

Changes in unit designation which

were not accompanied by substantive changes should be noted.

The charts should include the organization and staffing

arrangements of the USIB,

the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, and its predecessors, and

the Forty Committee and its predecessors.

The identification of personnel should include all officials and supervisors down

to the Branch Chief and Deputy Branch Chief level, and to the executive assistants

for the directors or deputy directors of all Divisions, Offices and Staffs and

similar assistants for any officials above those levels.

B. Budget and Cash Flow - The budgetary Information should include both the budgets

proposed to OMB and the final budgets approved.

The cash flow data should include

the funds actually appropriated,. their location in the appropriations for other

Departments and agencies, and an indication of whether funds transferred from par-

ticular agencies are earmarked for particular uses within the CIA.

Director Sec'y -

On 2-19-75 Inspector Bowers talked with William Miller,

Staff Director of captioned Committee. Miller was asked if the Committee

had established a possible timetable concerning hearings. He stated they

are "months" away from formal hearings but that they expect to begin taking

testimony in closed sessions to "build a record" in about two weeks.

Miller said these sessions will be conducted by a Member of the

Committee but will basically involve questioning of various agency officials,

not at the Director level, to provide basic information about the administrative

structure, legal basis, objectives and mission, and budget of the various

agencies in which the Committee will have an interest. Miller was requested

to give us specific notification as far in advance as possible concerning such

testimony sessions so that we would have sufficient time to prepare the necessary

material. Miller said this would be done.

Miller stated he would doubt that the Director would be needed

for any testimony for some time unless the Director wishes to be involved in

the early stages of providing basic information.

It seems apparent that the Committee still is uncertain of its

course of action. Miller commented that the Committee will probably follow

much the same procedure as used in the impeachment hearings where extensive

testimony was taken in closed sessions and used by the Members and staff to

prepare for the later public hearings.

It seems apparent that John Doar and his

staff who worked on the impeachment hearings will play a major role in the

Select Committee operations. Doar and a number of his former impeachment stati

members already are working with the Select CommiEre

roup.

To date, we have received 13 requests from the Select

for investigations of potential staff people in connection with the clearance

Reference McDermott to Jenkins memorandum of 1-31-75

recommending contact with Senator Frank Church (D-Idaho) concerning the

procedure for clearing staff personnel for captioned Committee.

Contact was made with the Senator's office on the morning of

2-6-75 to arrange an appointment. The Senator's secretary advised that his

schedule was so crowded that it would be impossible for him to discuss this

matter for several days. She said he requested that we discuss this situation with

William Miller, who the Senator intends to have head the Select Committee statf.

Miller was contacted on the morning of 2-6-75 by Inspector

Bowers, accompanied by Inspector Hotis. It was explained to him that the FBI

has no authority to issue clearances as such but that in conference with Central

Intelligence Agency officials it had been agreed that the FBI will investigate

prospective staff personnel, furnish results of the investigation to Senator Church/

as the Select Committee Chairman, and CIA will issue actual clearances based

on certification from Church. Miller agreed to this procedure. He was furnished

a small supply of SF 86, Security Investigation Data for Sensitive Position forms.

It was pointed out to him these forms should be filled out in complete detail and

furnished to us along with a current set of fingerprints. It was suggested the

applicants for these positions flingerprinted by the Capitol Police Department.

RECTI: 62-116395-407

Miller stated they would need results of these investigations as

soon as possible and after some discussion he agreed that a two week deadline

would be reasonable. It was suggested to him that in cases involving clerical-

type personnel that perhaps a longer deadline might be in order, and he said he

would keep this in mind. It was pointed out to Miller that results of the investigations

will be furnished to Senator Church personally. He also was advised that

representatives of various intelligence agencies currently are drawing up proposed

guidelines to suggest to the Committee for use in determining whether or not an

applicant qualifies for security clearance as well as proposed guidelines to

deal with the maintenance of classified material received by the Committee. He

was told someone will be in touch with Senator Church regarding this in the near

future.

Miller stated that the Committee is going to set up offices in the

auditorium of the Dirksen Senate Office Building, the same space used by the

senate Watergate Committee. This space currently is being altered to meet

Committee requirements.

Miller stated that the Committee probably will bring on board as staff

personnel most of the "security team" used by the House Judiciary Committee

during the Impeachment hearings. He said this group has a proven track record

with respect to leaks of information since all leaks resulting from the impeachment

proceedings have been traced to Members following hearings rather than staff

personnel. This is the group headed by former Assistant Attorney General John

Doar, and Miller indicated Doar will play a major role on the Senate Select

Committee staff.

Miller will furnish Bowers the completed SF 86 forms and

fingerprint cards on proposed staff personnel as soon as possible and these will

be furnished directly to Assistant Director Cleveland for handling. This matter

already has been discussed with Mr. Cleveland.

We have received the enclosed letter dated 1-29-75 from Senator

Frank Church (D-Idaho) writing in his capacity as the Chairman of the recently

established Select Committee on Intelligence Activities. The Senator states that to

carry out the task of the Committee, it will be necessary for the Members and

designated staff to have access to the most sensitive classified material. He

said the Committee is in the process of gathering a staff, adding that it is likely

many members of the staff will not have current security clearances. He stated

he would be most grateful if the FBI could expedite clearances on designated

staff so that work can proceed as expeditiously as possible. He points out the

standard clearance agreed upon during debate on the resolution creating the

Committee would be the equivalent of a "Q" clearance.

William E. Colby, as Director of Central Intelligence, is

coordinating the compilation from various agencies of the intelligence community

suggested guidelines dealing with clearances and the handling of security information

to be presented for consideration to the Select Committee. FBI representatives

from the Intelligence Division have been participating in this matter.

REC-70 62-116385-31

This matter EXs aiscussed with Mr. Mintz and Mr. Adams, and

it was agreed that the Intelligence Division representative.

should explore with

CIA whether or not that agency would agree to issue clearances for the Select

Committee staff if the FBI handled the investigations. Section Chief William O.

Cregar took this matter up on the afternoon of 1-30-75 with John M. Clarke,

Associate Deputy to the Director of Central Intelligence. Cregar advised Clarke

had obtained Colby's agreement to the following procedure. The FBI will handle

investigations of potential staff members named by the Select Committee.

Results

of the investigations would be furnished to Church as Chairman of the Select 2 am.

Committee and the Committee would determine whether or not the indighat is

the necessary criteria for clearance. Following such certification by the

Committee, CIA would issue the appropriate clearance. A Sub Group-of-the

Ad Hoc Coordinating Group on Congressional Review of the Intelligence Community

was to meet on 1-31-75 to draw up proposed guidelines to be presented to the

This group consists of representatives from the FBI, CIA, NSA, and Atomic

Cregar said there is no objections to the FBI discussing the

The Honorable Clarence M. Kelley

Department of Justice

Dear Mr. Kelley:

Intelligen definiteni

The Senate, on January 27, created a Select Committee to Study

Governmental Operations With Respect to All Intelligence Activities.

I am confident that the Federal Bureau of Investigation will make

every effort to assist the Select Committee in its work, and I look

forward to working together with you in completing this important task.

In order to carry out the necessary tasks mandated by the vote

of the Senate,

it will be necessary for Senators and designated staff

to have access to the most sensitive classified material. The Select

Committee is now in the process of bringing together a staff to assist

in carrying out its work.

In this regard, it is likely that many members

of the staff who will be hired will not have current security clearances.

On behalf of the Select Committee, I would be most grateful to

you if you could expedite, as a priority matter, clearances on designated

staff so that the work of the committee can proceed as expeditiously

as possible. In debate, prior to passage of S. Res. 21, the standard

¡applicable to a

"Q" clearance.

621-1163951

With kind regards,

In a memorandum to Mr. Adams and Mr. Wannall, dated

3/4/75, Mr. Kelley reported the

results of his meeting with

Mr. Cotter on that date.

Cotter advised the Director that the

Postmaster General has become alarmed about the opening of mail

by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Mr. Cotter asked the

Director if the FBI knew this was going on and did we actually

receive the benefits of it.

Mr. Kelley pointed out to Mr. Cotter

that the FBI knezXollOt and did get information on the procedure

from CIA.

During the course of their conversation, Mr. Kelley

told Mr. Cotter that he should be joined in the group of

investigative organizations headed by Mr. Colby, Director of

CIA, to consider actions in the Select Committee's probe.

Mr. Wannall was instructed to make. sure the Postal service is

included in the Group.

In a letter to Mr. Kelley dated 1-27-75,

Senators Mike Mansfield (D - Mont.) and Hugh Scott (R - Pa.)

requested we not destroy any documents or files that may be of interest

to the Senate in the forthcoming hearings on intelligence activities.

A memorandum from H. R. Hauer to Mr. LaPrade dated

munications Division, " pointed out that our destruction program is governed

by the Federal Records Act of 1950 and regulations of the rational Archives

25 years old relating to subversive activities which are based on unsub-

stantiated allegations and have not resulted in prosecution. Criminal-

files over 10 years old are reduced to microfilm and the paper records

are destroyed. In addition, all duplicate copies of communications are

destroyed when they no longer serve a useful purpose. The Files and

Communications Division asked the Legal Counsel Division to determine

whether the Senators request applied to our current destruction program.

This

reports

information received telephonically

from Mr. Robert Gambino, Office of Security, CIA, on the

morning of 3/1/75.

According to Mr. Gambino, a CIA officer employed

by CIA's Office of Security, Mr.

Richard Kuh, has been

called to testify before

the Rockefeller Commission on 3/3/75.

The purpose of this testimony is to discuss CIA's recruitment

of approximately 10 dissidents.

The dissidents were to be

infiltrated into extremist

and revolutionary groups active in

area in 1967 in order that CIA could

obtain firsthand knowledge as to whether any of these extremist

or revolutionary groups were planning any physical damage

ox attack on CIA installations throughout the Washington, D. C.,

area.

In preparation for this testimony CIA was reviewing

all records in their Office of Security. In this connection

they came across a note from CIA Security Officer Paul Gaynor

reflecting a conversation he had with myself.

During that time

I had liaison responsibilities with CIA's Office of Security.

the note, signed by Paul Gaynor, read

as follows

"Discussed with

WiTTiam O: Cresar, FBI,.

4/4-6/67.

after

conferring

1, Assistant Director, FBI.

"They never

to the Rockefeller Commission contemporaneous with Kuh's testimony.

I have reviewed all possible Bureau records in an

effort to locate any memoranda that might have been prepared.

I have found no such memoranda and am inclined to believe that

I did not make a record of my conversation with Mr. Gaynor in

view of the quotation, "They never heard of this matter."

Memorandum for Mr. Wannall

RE:

SENSTUDY 75

Although I have no specific recollection of the

conversation with Mr. Gaynor, I do have some recoLlection

that such a conversation did

take place with him as well as

with Mr. Osborn, the Director of Security, CIA.

This is

somewhat reinforced by the fact that I can recall CIA and

Specifically Mr. Osborn was

concerned about the security of

CIA's installations. There was considerable campus unres

during this period of time. I can recall CIA recruiters

were attacked and beaten.

As a matter of fact, I am almost

sure that CIA's recruiters were forced off campus and did

potential employees' interviews in Federal buildings.

Recognizing that both Osborn, as the Director of Security, and

CIA generally were very security conscious, I can understand

and believe it was probably likely that the Office of Security,

CIA, began to plan the security and physical protection of

their offices throughout the u. s.

The fact is that

approximately one and one-half years after my reported con-

versation with Mr. Gaynor one of CIA's offices in Ann Arbor,

Michigan, was bombed, resulting in the now famous Keith

decision.

In the interim Martin Luther King was assassinated

4/4/68 and parts of the District were burned; Resurrection City

existed during May and June, 1968. All of these events remind

one of the situation that existed at that time and helps me at

least put into perspective why CIA's Office of Security was

"concerned about the security of their installations.

Although I cannot recall the specific conversation

with Mr. Gaynor, I did periodically speak to him during my

eight-year liaison assignment.

Had I received such a request

as reported on Mr. Gaynor's note, I would have discussed it with

the

Assistant Director at that time.

It is likely that

Mr. Sullivan who was then the

Assistant Director would have

reacted as reported in Gaynor's quotation. I say this because

if the facts are true, no operational activity to collect

intelligence was envisioned.

CIA merely proposed to place assets

in a position to know if any violent activity was planned against

CIA establishments and the Bureau was merely interposing no

objections to such activity on the part of CIA.

requesting the material from CIA He described the list as unrealistic.

Mr. Wilderotter said that we may anticipate that the fBl will receive a

similar list requesting documents in great detail. He said that his

assignment in the Department at the present time is to assist in coordinating

the Department responses with the White House in regard to requests from

This memorandum reports the results of a meeting

of the Ad Hoc Coordinating Group on Congressional Review of

the Intelligence Community (hereafter referred to as the

Group) held on 2/27/75 at CIA Headquarters.

The Group is chaired by Mr. John Clarke, Associate

Deputy to the Director of Central Intelligence, and is made

up of representatives of agencies and departments having

membership on the U.S. Intelligence Board. Its purpose is

to serve as a coordinating mechanism for future testimony

before various Congressional committees.

At the meeting of the Group on 2/27/75 several

items of interest were discussed, which items are set forth

hereinafter.

Mr. Colby, in his role as Director of Central

Intelligence, and Mr. Clarke met with Senator Frank Church

on the morning of 2/27/75.

Church advised that it is not

his intention to harass the intelligence community and he

hopes to reaffirm to both the Congress and the people of the

United States that there is a valid and critical need for

intelligence.

Church is concerned that no inadvertent dis-

He assured

se. Colly that he would continue to consEd Min 7 7170d5 - 3/

sensitive matters that come before the Committee

such inadvertencies.

Senator Church was appreciative of

the security guidelines furnished to him for the handling

of sensitive information and documents and assured Mr. Colby

that the Senate Select Committee (SSC) would abide by

these

guidelines,

With regard to the Secrecy Agreement, which

heretofor

Senator Church has been somewhat reluctant to haver 1& 1975

his stait personnel complete, it is now acceptable to the

Senator.

However, he does want to have

the Chief Counself

the SSC review the Secrecy Agreement and will probably propose

certain changes in its wording.

(A Secrecy Agreement was

developed by a subcommittee of

the Group in concert with the

Justice, Department.

Memorandum to Mr. W.R. Wannall

RE: SENSTUDY 75

Senator Church stated that it was the Committee's

intention

to investigate all agencies' participation in

"covert

action" with primary emphasis on CIA activities overseas.

(Roughly interpreted, this could involve the Bureau's COINTEL

Program.) The SSC hopes to avoid any confrontation with any

members of the intelligence community over the release of

sensitive documents or testimony and it is Senator Church's

intention for him and Senator John G. Tower to consult with

both the President and the Vice President to resolve this

matter.

In this regard, Mr. Clarke advised members of the

Group that Deputy Attorney General Laurence H. Silberman has

been designated by the President to act as his counsel i

dealing with both the Senate.and the Fouse select cömmittees.

It is Mr. Clarkes

opinion that Mr. Silberman will act in this

capacity only as long as he remains Deputy Attorney General.

It isthe feeling of Senator Church at this time that

all staff employees of the SSC will be afforded "Q" clearances.

(issued by the successor to the Atomic Energy Commission.)

However, there is some question as to whether this in fact will

be true

and Clarke hopes to get further clarification on this

point.

Mr. Colby advised Senator Church that CIA requires

all employees to sign a CIA secrecy agreement.

It is

Mr. Colby's intention, as he did in the case of the Rockefeller

Commission, to issue an agency notice to all employees releasing

them from their obligation under the secrecy agreement in the

event an employee is called before the ssc. Additionally,

Mr. Colby intends to write a letter to the SSC advising it that

he

has so relieved CIA employees from this obligation, (Attached

is a draft copy of an Agency notice circulated within CIA. Also

attached is a copy of the letter Mr. Colby forwarded to the

Honorable Nelson A. Rockefeller advising the Rockefeller Commission

that he was relieving Agency employees from any obligation under

the secrecy agreement.)

Inasmuch as the Bureau requires all employees to

complete a secrecy agreement, the Intelligence Division believes

that the Legal Counsel Division should review what action, 1f

any, the Bureau should take in anticipation of FBI personnel

With regard to deleting the names of Agents and

confidential sources from documents furnished to the sse,

senator Church agreed that this would be acceptable providing

he or members of his staff could consult with officials of the

submitting agency if it was deemed necessary that the names of

Agents or sources had to be revealed.

Memorandum to Mr. Wannall

RE: SENSTUDY 75

During the Colby/Church meeting, Church advised

(that he anticipates asking all agencies and departments of

the intelligence community for the following three items

down to a branch level, going back as far as 1947; 2) Copies

of all budgets since 1947; and 3) Documents reflecting all

With regard to items 2 and 3, Mr. Clarke indicated

that he will seek clarification with regard to budget and cash

flow submission and will hopefully have additional information

for members of the Group in the near future as to exactly what

the SSC desires.

During the course of the meeting of the Group,

Mr. Clarke advised that the Bureau should consider advising

Mr. Colby of any "bad apples" that are uncovered during the

Bureau's investigation of staff personnel.

This was not

intended to try to eliminate a candidate

as a staff employee

where there is some derogatory information but if the Bureau

develops very substantial information indicating the subject

is a definite security risk,

it is conceivable that Mr. Colby

could at least discuss that individual's possible employment

with Senator Church to prevent the Committee from hiring

anyone that could later prove embarrassing to the ssc.

Prior to the adjournment of the meeting of the

Group, Mr. Clarke queried all members as to what provisions

they have made for handling the onslaught of paper and

requests he anticipates all agencies will receive from the

SSC.

_ As an example, CIA has had to Xerox over 15,000 pages

of CIA documents in

the last

ten days in response

to requests

from the Rockefeller Commission. Clarke feels strongly that

each agency should develop a task force within their ranks

supplemented by stenographic personnel to prepare themselves

for what he believes will be very extensive requests from the

SSC with relatively short deadlines.

AGENCY NOTICE

As you are aware,. the President on 4 January 1975

established a Commission on CIA Activities Within the United

States to look into allegations that certain Agency activities

conducted within this country exceeded our charter and

statutory. authority.

Upon completion of its inquiry, the Commission will issue.

its findings and submit recommendations to the President and to

the Director of

Central Intelligence.

The President has

directed that the Agency extend support

and assistance to the Connission, and I have pledged my coopera-

tion to the Commission and its Staff.

I have also told the Commission that any current employee

of the Agency is available to the Commission and its Staff for

discussions..

The Agency and the Commission Staff have now developed

sufficient working experience so that we can désign additional

procedures to facilitate the Staff's work in examining topics

of concern.

All members of the Commission Staff have received security

clearances and have been given badges providing them with

:

access

to Agency offices in the Washington, D. C. area.

The Commission Staff will, during their inquiries in CIA

Headquarters, Area Oftices, be given access to Agency files

related to the Commission's fields of responsibility.. The

use of specific sensitive data from these files in any

unclassified report by the Commission will be subject to

consultation between the Director and the Commission.

To facilitate interviews by the Commission Staff Officers

with CIA employees, I

have advised the Commission that employees

are authorized to furnish classified information with certain

exceptions.. My letter to the Vice President, the Chairman of

the Commission, is attached. It sets forth guidelines for the

furnishing of classified information.

The cooperative spirit of our relationship with the com

mission and its Staff must at. the same time take account of the

rights of Agency employees. Like other citizens, they have the

right to remain silent. The Commission Staff will advise

employees of their rights at the beginning of any interview.or

other appearance.

My own belief, after careful review of all activities

question, is that legal action will not be taken against "

individuals. The final decision, however, must rest with the

Department of Justice and other legal authorities and risk of

such action is a judgment each employee must make for himself.

When a current Agency employee is asked to be interviewed

by a member of the Commission Staff, the Staff member should notify

Mr. E. H.. Knoche who is my assistant in charge,of liaison with

the Commission and its Staff.

My. Knoche, in turn, will advise the employee, tha

purpose of this is in no way to inhibit the vork of Staff members.

It is intended to allow time for the employee to gain general

legal guidance it he wants it, and to obtain security guidance

from an appropriate senior officer.

Normally, we think an employee would advise his supervisor

or other Agency authorities on the nature of the interview. " It

should be understood, however, that this is not mandatory:

In arranging the interviews, I am acutely aware of the need

to avoid the appearance as well as the fact of collusion between

Agency and employee.

None ofus has any intention to fabricate

or mislead. I am convinced that being foxthconing,white per

aps

embarassing a ferdetalls, will on the woles vindicate the

Agency and its eminent service to our country.

In keeping with my long-standing policy, employees with

any knowledge of activities conducted within the United States,

now or in the past, which they believe to be of a questionable

nature can follow the customary practice within the Agency of

calling the matter to my attention or that of the inspector

General. This will ensure my ability to continue to be foxthcoming

with all those involved in external reviews of Agency activities.

Employees should also feel free to bring any such matters

directly to the attention of the Commission of the Commission

Staff

outside of Agency channels if they so desire. . In doing

so, however, employees should bear in mind that the Commission's

field of interest is CIA activities within this country..

To contact the Commission, employees can call the Executive

Director, Mr. David. Belin on 456-7010.or the Counsel, Mr. Marvin

The Honorable Nelson A. Rockefeller

Chairman, Commission on CIA Activities

Within the United States

712 Jackson Place, N.W.

Washington, D.C. 20500

Dear Mr. Vice President:

As you are aware, all employees of the Central Intelligence

Agency are required to sign secrecy agreements when they enter on

duty. This is a condition if employment, and it requires that they

keep forever secret all classified information gained during the

course of their employment. The secrecy agreement further re-

quires that they may not disclose classified information in inter-

views or by publication without prior authorization from the Director

of Central Intelligence. There is a provision in the secrecy agree-

ment that the conditions and obligations with respect to the protection

of classified information by the agreement continue after employment

with the Agency has been terminated.

As I have stated to the Commission, I will make available any

employee of this Agency to the Commission for staff interview and

for testimony before the Commission. This letter will serve as

authorization for any such employees or ex-employees to furnish

information as requested by the Commission or its staff on matters

that may be classified. As has been discussed with the Commission,

there are certain sensitive items which should receive special han-

dling. Such items include names of sources, specific details of

technical devices and systems maintained in compartmented channels

by the Agency, names of employees, names of persons who may be

targets of kidnapping or assassination by foreign intelligence organi-

zations, names of organizations cooperating with the Agency, and

detailed information which would pinpoint any of the above. Some

information might also conflict with a subject's right of privacy.

There is no purpose here to impede in any way the Commission's

investigation. Ibelieve, however, in most cases these specific

identifying names and details are not necessary for an understanding

of our activities. Where the Commission or the staff believes that

specific identification is necessary to the purpose of the testimony

or the staff interrogation, the matter will be discussed between the

Commission and the Agency, and I will be prepared to consult with

you and the Commission to determine the course of action to be taken.

Where in the judgment of the employee a specific identification is

especially sensitive as outlined in this paragraph, an identity number

will be assigned pending resolution of the matter between the Com-

mission and the Agency, and in the meantime the identity will not be

divulged by the

employee.

I appreciate the cooperation of the Commission and of Agency

employees in this regard.. I am still responsible under the statute

and as a professional for the protection of intelligence sources and

methods from unauthorized disclosure. In many situations the inad-

vertent disclosure of a name or identification could have serious

repercussions, including placing lives in jeopardy, and I cannot in

good conscience put such information at risk.

This arrangement of course does not affect the Commission's.

procedures for advising prospective witnesses of their rights, secur-

ing waivers, nor the employee's or ex-employee's right not to answer

certain questions if they are concerned that the answers might tend

to incriminate them.

Respectfully,

SIENED

This memorandum recommends that we keep Mr. Colby

apprised, as the Director of central Intelligence, through the

ad hoc coordinating Group on congressional inguiry of any

proposed or completed FBI testimony before congressional com-Cate

mittees when such FBI testimony impacts on other members of

AChy

The Ad Hoc Coordinating Group on Congressional Inquiry,

chaired by Mr. John Clarke,

Associate Deputy to the Director of

Central Intelligence, is made up of representatives of agencies

and departments having membership on the United States Intelli-

gence Board (USIB).

Its purpose is to serve as a coordinating

mechanism for future testimony before congressional hearings.'

At a meeting of the USIB on 2/26/75, Chairman Colby

commented on the effective manner in which the Ad Hoc Group

was functioning. However, he noted that it is imperative all

members of USIB

coordination to insure that the basic interests of the Intel-

ligence Community are served and that any testimony or documents

furnished congressional committees are factual and accurate.

He hoped that all members will be made aware of what other members

are testifying to before a congressional committee as well as the

identity of that congressional committee.

Mr. Colby noted that

it is highly likely that members of the Intelligence Community

will be called before various congressional committees other

than the Senate and House Select

Committees

or inadvertency. As an example of this coordination, Mr. Colby

has furnished the Bureau and other members of the Intelligence

Community the statement he plans to make as the lead-off witness

before the Senate Select Committee (SSC). This statement has

been reviewed by the Intelligence Division and a memorandum

has been prepared which notes that there is nothing objectionable

from the Bureau's standpoint in Colby's proposed statement.

A second point Colby made at the USIB meeting was his

desire that all members understand that no agency representative

should discuss with a congressional committee information or

techniques which are of proprietary interest to another agency

without prior consultation. This is certainly a valid request

and we should concur. As an example, the FBI would not want

the National Security Agency to discuss with a congressional

committee FBI support of National Security Agency's TELEX effort

without first clearing with us. Likewise, the Bureau representa-

tive should not discuss National Security

Agency's exploitation

of teletype traffic furnished to them by the FBI without prior

coordination with NSA. Recently a congressional committee asked

CIA for copies of any written agreements between FBI and CIA.

CIA felt they had no alternative but to provide the committee

with copies of the Bl - CI Understanding dated 2/7/66. However,

before doing so CÍA did obtain FBI approval:

ACTION:

If approved, through the Chairman of the Ad Hoc

Coordinating Group on Congressional Inquiry, representatives

of the Intelligence Division will keep Mr. Colby and the

Intelligence Community advised of any FBI testimony before

congressional committees wherein such testimony could impact

on other members of the Intelligence Community, could result

in other members of the Intelligence Community being called to

testify, or where questions are asked which are of proprietary

interest

to another member of the Community.

A Secrecy Agreement (copy attached) was presented

to Mr. William Miller, Staff Director of the Senate Select

Committee (SSC), with therequest that all staff employees of

the Committee,

which may number as high as 40, be requested to sign.

Miller was rather cool to the suggestion and indicated that the

SSC and Senator Church would take it under advisement.

It is

to be noted that this draft of the Secrecy Agreement was prepared

Memorandum for Mr. Wannall

RE :

SENSTUDY 75

62-116395

Attached is a copy of the paper Colby provided to the White

House responsive to this request. It does encompass recom-

mendations of member agencies of

the Group including the FBI.

At a subsequent meeting Mr. Colby had with unidentified

persons at the White House, the above list was discussed. Colby

They were:

(A) to refuse

providing sensitive information to a congressional

committee and face the possibility of a contempt citation,

(B) have the President refuse to authorize the release of such

information, presumably through the exercise of Executive Privilege,

or (C) the President could call the majority and

minority leaders

of the congressional committee to the White House, furnish to them

the answer to the question with the added caveat that they were

the only persons being informed of the answers and, therefore,

would be personally accountable for any leak of information.

Representatives of the White House were not very enthusiastic to

the options put forth by Mr. Colby and indicated that they would

be calling a meeting at the White House of senior officials of

the Department of Defense, Justice Department, CIA and the FBI

to review what position the Intelligence Community should take

in responding to a request for extremely sensitive and highly

classified information.

(3)

Members of the Group were allowed to read an

internal memorandum from Mr. David W. Bellin, Executive Director

of the Commission on CIA Activities Within the U. S. (The Rockefeller

Commission), to Mr. Philip Buchen, Counsel to the President.

This memorandum reports the results of a conversation between

Mr. Bellin and Mr. William Miller, Chief of Staff for the SSC.

The memorandum revealed that Miller believes that within two weeks

his staff will be in three-quarters gear. He plans to have a total

staff of about 40, 10 to 12 of whom will be lawyers.

The initial

work or the starI

will concentrate on a review of documents,

interviews, and what Miller called "depositions." Miller does not

Memorandum for Mr. Wannall

RE:

SENSTUDY 75

62-116395

Bellin's memorandum also noted that the thrust of

the SSC's investigation will include the whole range of

intelligence gathering agencies; will delve into the basic

matters of policy, including whether or not there is a need

for all of the agencies; what the results are; related public

policy matters, as well as rights of privacy.

Miller also advised Bellin that the SSC would operate

out of a room referred to as "the auditorium," which Miller

thought gave the best security. He said there would be rigid

standards imposed to seal off any leaks. These standards would

include having everything in a central filing area with a specific

check-out system permittedto particular people so that if leaks

occurred the source of such leaks could be readily ascertained.

Xeroxing would be severely limited. In response to a question

from Bellin to Miller as to why the Senate and House did not

create a joint Senate/House committee as opposed to individual

senate and House select committees, Miller advised that it was too

difficult to arrange because of matters of protocol.

It is noted that although a House Select Committee

is being formed with basically the same charter as the ssC, no

chairman of the House Select Committee has been designated

the Group estimates that it will be a month before the House

Select Committee can get started.

Pursuant to request of Mr. Adams, Liaison Officer

Director Setty

L.F. Schwartz contacted Mr. John Clark of the Intelligence

Community Staff on 2/11/75 with regard to suggested security

procedures for the handling of classified information by

the Select Committee.

Mr. Clark advised that on 2/10/75 he had met

personally with Mr. William miller who has been designated

to head the Select Committee Staff. He stated that he dis-

cussed with Mr. Miller the proposed guidelines for security

and the proposed secrecy agreement for staff members and

furnished Miller with copies of both these items. Mr. Clark

stated that Miller was generally receptive to the proposed

guidelines and felt that they would be acceptable subject

to the approval of Senator Church. Mr. Miller was decidedly

cool concerning the idea of stall members sigmna.

a secrecy

agreement but indicated that a final decision regarding this

would be made by Senator Church...

Mr. Clark stated that he raised two specific questions

which Mr. Colby considers most important with regard to any

presentation made to the Select Committee. He advised Miller

that the Intelligence Community would desire to not identify

specific agents or the details

was agreeable to this and foresaw no problem with the Select

Committee accepting this proposal. Secondly, Mr. Clark

advised Mr. Miller that Mr. Colby, speaking for the Intelli-

gence Community, was opposed to having any dealings with staff

members of the various Senators and Representatives other

than those assigned to work directly under Mr. Miller as part

of the Select Committee Staff.

Mr. Miller stated that this

was also acceptable to him and he assured Mr. Clark that all

of his staff members would be subject to an FBI background

investigation and the issuance ida

oI a security clearance by.

Memorandum to Mr. W.R. Wannall

RE: SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

During the conversation with Mr. Clark he advised

further that it is not the intention of Mr. Colby to use

as any part of the CIA's defense for alleged domestic

activities the allegation that such activities were under-

taken because the FBI had failed or was unwilling to carry

out its responsibilities in the domestic area.

Mr. Clark

noted that he is aware that there have been references to

such a claim in the newspapers but he assured SA Schwartz

that Mr. Colby does not support this position in any way.

Mr. Clark volunteered to arrange a personal meeting between

Mr. Colby and an appropriate FBI official to discuss this

point, if the Bureau so desired.

CIA will not initiate an investigation of any

"investigation" means systematic and direct inquiries or

procedures (such as physical or technical surveillances

or neighborhood inquiries) aiming at developing information

concerning an individual's activities or background;

"investigation" does not include the acceptance or the

development of information through social contacts or contacts

normally made by CIA agents in discharging their cover

functions.

(2)

CIA will seek concurrence and coordination of

the FBI before approaching for recruitment any foreign

official or communist-bloc visitor in the United States.

the FBI will concur and coordinate if the proposed action

does not conflict with any operation, current or planned,

including active investigation of the FBI. (E)

(3) CIA will advise the FBI prior to any planned

meeting between a CIA asset and a foreign official or

communist-bloc visitor of known or presumed interest to

the FBI (this would include all communist-bloc officials

and visitors)

for purposes of assessment and social

development. (5)

American agents of CIA, and foreign agents of CIA recruited

abroad who come to the United States will be identified

its individual peculiarities. The governing principle will

be positive intelligence interest as weighed against

internal security factors.

In those cases where CIA will be handling its

FBI all agent information bearing on counterintelligence

or internal security matters, including the scope and

nature of the agent's access to information and the

identities of the agent's significant contacts, particularly

in the communist-bloc field.

In such cases where CIA

servicing has been inadequate to FBI internal security

interests, the FBI will have direct access to the agent.

not to/destroy, remove from our possession or control, or otherwise dispose or

permit the disposal of any records or documents which might have a bearing on

subject's under investigation proposed by Senate. Accordingly, Files and

Communications Division is hölding in abeyance any destruction program previously.

and Legats to do likewise until clarification of above request is received.

Recommend

Office of Legal Counsel prepare letter to Senators Mansfield and Scott asking clarifi-

cation of their request and whether or not it includes existing destruction procedures

previously approved by the Archivist of the United States.

Regulations of the National Archives and Records Service (NARS), General

Services Administration, which are based on Title 44, Chapter 33, Sections 3301

and 3302, U.S. Code, govern the type of material which we must maintain.

NARS,

regulations also govern what material may be destroyed. Record material is

described as including "all books, papers, maps, photographs, or other documen-

tary materials, regardless of physical form or characteristics, made or received

by an agency of the U.S. Government under Federal law or in connection with the

transaction of public business and preserved or appropriate for preservation by that;

agency or its legitimate successor as evidence of the organization, functions, policies,

decisions, procedures, operations, or other activities of the Government or

because of the information value of data contained therein." Our destruction pro-

grams are conducted in compliance with NARS regulations to conserve space and

manpower. In those instances where we have more than one copy of a communication,

it is our policy to file only the original of the communication and to destroy any

copies when they no longer serve

civil fingerprint files involving the destruction of certain fingerprint cards and

related name index cards, primarily duplicate-type cards on persons considered

inactive because of age.

Insofar as destruction of material by Files and Communications Division

is concerned, files, index cards, and related material over 2o years old maintained

at FBI Headquarters pertaining to unfounded allegations of subversive activities, .

membership in subversive organizations, subversive sympathies and tendencies on

the part of individuals and organizations are approved for destruction by NARS when

investigations revealed allegations predicated upon rumor, nebulous complaints and

nonspecific allegations from which no prosecutive action occurred. Archival

authority has been obtained to destroy FBI Headquarters files in connection with

Interstate Transportation of Stolen Motor Vehicles cases, Selective Service Act

cases, Destruction o1 Aircrait or Motor Vehicles cases (provided no prosecution

results from the inquiries conducted and the case had been closed ten years);.

and Archival authority has been obtained for destruction of

files at FBI Headquarters in unknown subject cases in which there was no criminal

prosecution (no time limit set regarding the destruction of unknown subject cases).

In addition to the above authority for the outright destruction of FBI

Headquarters records, Archival authority has also been obtained to microfilm any

closed criminal file:

after the case has been

closed for ten or more years. Thereafter, the paper records may be destroyed.

We currently have on hand 38, 601 index cards to be destroyed which pertain to

paper record material which has been destroyed previously under NARS regulations

and authority.

In addition, personnel files concerning employees who have been separated

more than one year are reviewed and temporary records contained therein which no

longer serve a useful purpose are purged and only those permanent records as

described in the Federal Personnel Manual are retained in the official personnel

folder.

Also files, index cards and related material, over 15 years old, maintained

at FBI Headquarters relating to laboratory examinations requested by various local,

state and Federal law enforcement organizations in cases other than FBI cases

wherein positive identification was not effected are also purged. These files

no longer possess sufficient reference or evidentiary value to merit retention.

Administrative and noninvestigative records maintained in the various

field offices of the Federal Bureau of Investigation are purged also. This material

is retained in the field offices until necessary action has been taken or it has served

its purpose.

RECOMMENDATION:

That Office of Legal Counsel prepare an appropriate reply to Senators

Mansfield and Scott to determine if their request not to destroy records and

documents was intended to include the destruction programs enumerated above.

DECLASSIFIED BY SP PALAN LIG

THE ROLE OF COUNTERINTELLIGENCE

Counterintelligence is an integral part of our

national defense. By definition and by its very nature

counterintelligence is a defensive posture to the extent

that it reacts primarily to intelligence initiatives of

hostile intelligence services. As any good defense,

however, it cannot be static or passive. It is based

upon knowledge of this country's adversaries; it seeks

out and engages hostile agents and the intelligence

services that employ them.

The national counterintelli-

gence defense, in other words, requires both sound preven-

tive measures

and an energetic and sustained counterattack.

The purpose of defensive and

aggressive counter-

intelligence is to ensure that adversaries who do not want

to risk open confrontation cannot attain the same objectives

through stealth. In more concrete terms, the purpose of

counterintelligence is to identify and neutralize spies

à nu

their masters who serve our opponents.

Spycatching, by itself, is not enough, because

spies are replaceable. American

counterintelligence must

also know who sent the spies and who supported and directed

their work in this country and

in friendly nations. And

beyond identifying these agent handlers--the officers of

the KGB and other such clandestine communist organizations-

our counterintelligence must know how these people are moti-

vated, recruited, trained, structured, rewarded, and

punished.

We need to know how they communicate

with each

other--from New York or Washington, for example, to Moscow

or Prague. In short, we need to know everything we can

find out about them,

as individuals and as organizations.

And finally, what we know must be shared appropriately with

other services equally concerned.

This need is even more acute today than in the

1950s and 1960s.

We know from hard experience that the

clandestine communist services always increase the range

and the intensity of their operations during periods of

Western relaxation, when the openness and multiplicity of

exchanges provide favorable conditions and opportunities

for launching intelligence operations against our country.

SECRET

The growth in communist-bloc intelligence

representation over the past several years, not only in

the United States but also throughout the rest of the

world, is statistically and operationally demonstrable.

For convenient reference there is attached to this paper

a fact sheet documenting this growth based on information

recorded by the CIA and FBI. In considering the number

of communist-bloc nationals posted to official establish-

ments outside their countries, it is important to recognize

that a substantial proportion

of these are intelligence

officers.

These officers have a primary mission to conduct

intelligence operations and official duties involved in

their cover positions, if required at all, are secondary

and serve mainly

to legitimize their cover.

In the Soviet

case,

it is an estimate accepted by the United States .

intelligence community that at least 40 per

cent of the

officials are intelligence officers. Indeed, some defector

sources have estimated that 70 per cent to 80 per cent of

Soviet officials have some intelligence connection,

although this figure includes officials who act only in a

minimal support capacity and only occasionally.

The most effective way to achieve the counter-

intelligence purpose is to recruit personnel from hostile

secret services.

It is also the hardest of counterintelli-

gence tasks, a goal usually requiring years of close study

and meticulous planning.

Even if the effort succeeds, we

cannot accept at face value what the penetration source

tells us. His reports must be most carefully crosschecked

against everything known. from all other sources.

Otherwise

we may be duped by an adversary who uses "our" agent to

tell us what he wants us to hear.

It there is no penetration of the adversary, or

none. at the level of seniority, all the other sources

(hostile agents whom we have detected and "doubled," inter-

cepted communications, defectors, etc.) become all the more

important.

If counterintelligence is to identify and then

contain or control secret action directed against the

United States, it must be closely coordinated. The adver-

sary services do not run uncoordinated, haphazard operations

iiis..

against us. All their major programs of espionage, counter-

espionage.

subversion, sabotage, deception, and disinforma-

cion are intertwined.

For example, a computer program

designed to keep track of CIA personnel at home and abroad

was planned in the soviet Union, is maintained in

Czechoslovakia, and draws upon information from bast

Germany, Hungary, and elsewhere.

Another example:

informa-

tion from multiple defector sources indicates that the

Cuban security service, the DGI, since 1968-69, has agreed

to operate against the

United States and American intelli-

gence in areas where the Soviets are at an operational

disadvantage.

A second reason why United States counterintelli

gence must be coordinated is the need for effective liaison

with counterintelligence services abroad.

No one Western

service can cope by itself with the worldwide, centrally

directed, attack of the Soviets, the bloc (including the

Cubans), and the whole array of

Communist Party auxiliaries.

A counterintelligence defense which stops at a border is

no defense at ail.

The work within our borders is equally essential.

to our safety.

Because the United States continues to be

the main site of hostile clandestine operations, it is

also the main site of

American counterintelligence.

Both forms of counterintelligence--the security

'of our own operations and the penetration of operations

against us--have to be sustained if the Director of Central

Intelligence is to be able to protect United States intelli-

gence methods and sources, as required by law.

Counterintelligence has three values which flow

from its functions.

The value of its security function is

that it prevents our adversaries from gaining information

that the United States Government does not want to make

public. Counterintelligence cannot perform this security

role by rote and routines. And it cannot depend entirely

upon guards, safes, and other passive measures.

It must be

active to prevent the subversion of those people to whom

the United States Government has entrusted its classified

information. Some of these persons are members in American

intelligence and counterintelligence organizations.1

It must also prevent leakage of sensitive

United States information from foreign services to whom

American secrets are necessarily confided as a matter of

common concern but which in turn have been penetrated by

enemy agents.

The value of what might be called an anticipatory

defense is not always evident because when it succeeds,

nothing happens. It is like preventive medicine.

Its

value becomes dramatically clear only when it fails.

The second value of counterintelligence is that

It provides information about hostile clandestine intentions

and capabilities.

This information is the more valuable if

our adversaries

do not know that we have it.

Finally, the thira value of counterintelligence is

the large amount of straight intelligence obtained as a by-

product by counterintelligence agents in the normal course

of their business.

ISome specific and subsequently publicized examples of

Soviet success in the

recruitment of American officials, in

most cases exposed and frustrated by the FBI, are: Nelson

Whelan (1963),

Robert Johnson

(1965), Herbert Boeckenhaupt (1966), and

Ulysis Harris (1967)..

There may be cited here some of the completed counter-

intelligence cases which resulted in the identification and

suppression of high-level Soviet penetrations of Western

intelligence services and which were directly attributable

to CIA counterintelligence work:

Heinz Felfe (West Germany - 1961), Harold Adrian Russell

("Kim") Philby (UK - 1963),

GIorglo Rinald Ghistleri Italy, Spain - 1967), Yuriy

Loginov (South Africa - 1967), Nahit Imre (Turkey - 1968),

and Francis Roussilhe (France - 1969).

RET

All United States governmental components have

some individual internal responsibility. for the security

of personnel, records,

and physical facilities.

Aside

from these basic security functions, the overall counter-

intelligence role in the United States Government is shared

by several specific intelligence agencies.

The conduct of

counterintelligence overseas is one of CIA's original

functions flowing from the National Security Act of 1947,

as amended, and specifically spelled out and developed in

a series of

National Security Council Intelligence Directives.

The FBI has the general responsibility for conduct of

counterintelligence operations within the United States

based on statutory responsibilities (enforcement of espionage,

sabotage, neutrality, registration acts, and related matters)

as well as a series of Presidential Directives and Attorney

General orders.

Success of United States counterintelligence is

proportionate to the extent to which it exists as

an

integrated, unified concept with fullest coordination among

the separate agencies. It did not exist as such until

World War II; and only small progress was made after that

war, despite the National Security Act of 1947.

An

integrated system first began to take shape in 1958, when

the National Security Council moved directly into the

Intelligence and counterintelligence directives

which established the basic ground rules were formulated

and placed in effect. . As a result the United States has a

set

of counterintelligence concepts and precepts that

organize our experience and hold us together.

Throughout

the recent years interagency coordination and cooperation

have become a working reality, becoming more and more

effective as the level of coordination continues to rise.

The effectiveness of counterintelligence also

requires recognition of its separateness as a function. In

CIA and elsewhere, before the mid-1950s, counterintelligence

was often identified only with

security

and the ad hoc

exchange of limited

amounts

of information in liaison.

was sometimes regarded as an adjunct to other specialities,

usually espionage.

This subordination degraded the function

to its lowest level, to such necessary but elementary work

as nametracing and

operational bookkeeping. But these

are only the elementary building blocks of

the masonry of

counterintelligence. If it is restricted to nothing more

than that, American

counterintelligence will inevitably

degenerate to parochialism and departmentalism. It will

not be responsive to a

central and vital philosophy. It

will tend to yield the initiative to the adversary and to

the writing of damage reports after 'we have been hurt

instead of seeking the adversary out and engaging him

before he can hurt us.

In summary, the value of counterintelligence as

an integral part of national defense requires a

continuity

of doctrine, an organization of experience,

and

must be

sustained by a full-time, experienced cadre of specialists

with continuing emphasis on interagency understanding and

coordination.

FACT SHEET

COMMUNIST-BLOC INTELLIGENCE REPRESENTATION

There are presently 667 intelligence and security

services operating throughout the world.

The 13 countries comprising the Soviet Union and

other communist states, including Cuba, operate 52 services

of domestic and foreign intelligence and security. Some

23 of these work outside their own frontiers.

The principal

service in action throughout the world against the

United States and Americans--which our highest grade

documentary sources confirm are termed "The Main Enemy"

(Glavny Vrag)--is the Soviet State Security Service (KGB),

together with Soviet military intelligence, the GRU, headed

by a senior KGB officer.

Soviet intelligence representation in the Free

World has been massively increasing for at least the

past

iộ years, as the following data show:

on 2/6/75 the writer was furnished the attached material

by Mr. William E./Colby, Director of Central Intelligence, during

a meeting in his office

which was also attended by Lt. General

Lew Allen, Director of the National Security Agency (NSA)&.

General Allen was provided copies of the same material. It includes

a three-page statement containing a listing of categories of activities

of subject matters that require stringent protection during testimony

before the captioned Committee by any members of the U.S. Intelligence

Community.

The FBI had input in connection with the compilation of

this information and the material we furnished has been included. (8)

Also among the material is a copy of a statement which

Mr. Colby is hopeful of securing permission to present at the very

beginning of the Select Committee hearings in order that he can

emphasize the importance of and need for intelligence operations ji

its processes, the processes for collection of intelligence, how

they are controlled and overseen, why there is an overriding need

for secrecy in certain areas and what Congress can do to enhance

U.S. intelligence collections. (5)

The third paper lists eleven papers which Mr. Colby intends

to turn over to the Committee whether or not he is permitted to

make his opening statement.

These papers supplement his statement

and have been the subject of previous memoranda.

The FBI has

prepared the last two papers listed and is coordinating with all

other interested Intelligence Community members to assure that all

of the papers

will be in such form as not to conflict with Bureau

interests.

He states we cannot operate effectively

without more precise provisions in the law to protect our secrets. (8

Referring on page 5 specifically to the FBI, he notes that

intelligence collection on a worldwide basis contributes to our

internal security.

The efforts of foreign nations to penetrate our

society and to manipulate our citizens are well documented. There

are several hundred foreign members of the KGB and intelligence

operatives in this country seeking information about the United

States and its plans and their efforts must be met by an intensive

counterintelligence effort. He states "githin the United States,

CIA's foreign and the FBI's domestic intelligence activities have

collaborated to frustrate several plans to bring to America and its

citizens the kind of hijacking and indiscriminate terrorist bombings

that characterize too many areas of the world." (5)

Beginning at page 7, Mr. Colby undertakes to explain the

processes of collecting intelligence and on page 10 briefly goes

into the roles of the various intelligence components and the

legislative bases for their activities.

For example, he states

the intelligence roles of the other members of the Intelligence

Community in part stem from the 1947 Act and in part from separate

legislation, such as that charging the FBl with responsibility tor

internal security, which I consider a correct statement.

On page 11, he notes that all intelligence elements operate

within legal authority and are given further direction by the

National Security Council, but (page 13) "each of us in the Intelli-

gence Community takes full personal responsibility for the actions

recommended or taken in conformance with such general guidance and

policy. " (8)

He explains the role of the President's Foreign Intelligence

Advisory Board (PFIAB) whose "members are an impressive group of

responsible Americans who report their independent views of the

accomplishments and weaknesses of the Intelligence Community direstly

to the president. " (5)

Following this, he notes that in addition to responding to

intelligence agencies are exposed to audit-type functions exercised

by the Office of Management and Budget, internal audit systems, the

General Accounting Office, and the Director of Central Intelligence, (5)

On page 14, after referring to the manner in which the

Intelligence Community functions through a series of committees

and boards, Mr. Colby states that the work of such committees and

boards is limited to foreign intelligence,"as internal security

falls solely within the jurisdiction of the FBI. The FBI participates

in the Intelligence Community effort, however, so that any contribu-

tions that foreign intelligence might make to internal security can

be properly handled." 5

On page 17, Mr. Colby expresses confidence that the American

people not only support but insist upon an effective intelligence

apparatus to protect their security and intelligence..

Thereafter,

referring to Congress, on page 17, he states "Just tell us in the

intelligence business what the Nation wants and does not want, and

we will do our best to satisfy it.

But also give us a way openly

to change these rules when the Nation expects them to be changed."

He then calls upon Congress to organize itself to protect the

necessary secrecy of our intelligence operations while exercising

its responsibility for oversight. (g)

A review of Mr. Colby's proposed statement has revealed

no information which I feel would be objectionable from the Bureau's

standpoint.

• Mx. Chairman and Members of the Committee

This Committee's inquiry and its conclusions and recom-

mendations can open a new era in American intelligence and

even in the intelligence profession worldwide. Historically,

the intelligence activities of a state have been considered

an essential function, but one conducted outside normal Gov-

ernment processes.

Indeed, one foreign official recently

expressed some surprise to me that our intelligence rests

upon legislation enacted by the Congress and is subject to

oversight and annual appropriation by the Congress. He com-

mented that he naû

aiways considered it a matter private to

the Executive. This Committee's charter demonstrates the

contrary in America.

America has made many innovations in the intelligence

,process, and I believe we have brought ours to the highest

peak of efficiency of any intelligence service in the world.

Oux Government's policies can now be based on factual in-

formation and demonstrable analysis rather than on hunches,

circumstantial evidence, and overly qualified judgments

that alone were available a

few years ago.

With

the assistance of my Intelligence Community col-

leagues, I hope to give this Committee the broadest possible

look at these intelligence efforts of the United States.

I will also offer ideas for improvements that could help us

do our job better.

It is important that our intelligence activities be

viewed in proper perspective and that the few instances of

failure or error that may have occurred in the past be

understood in context.

We will welcome clear statements of the authority and

mission assigned to American intelligence. I believe the

public, including those engaged in the intelligence profession,

are entitled to and are prepared to accept clarifications

and

new definitions.

The Congress and the American people

do not expect intelligence to be carried on in the shadows

of euphemism and ambiguity. Nor can we operate effectively

without more precise provisions in the law to protect our

secrets. I believe oux nation is ready to accept the nec-

essity of reasonable secrecy in our intelligence operations

in the same way it accepts the need for secrecy in diplomatic

negotiations, in development of war plans, or in protecting

newspaper sources.

I. The Importance of Intelligence

Mr. Chairman, American intelligence helps protect our

country, it helps maintain peace in the world, and it helps

our Government make better decisions affecting the welfare

of every one of our citizens. It is not only responsible

-2-

:

for warning us of imminent attack by a hostile power, these

days it must also look into the future and warn of the research

and development of new weapons systems which, unless countered

or negotiated away, would affect the security of our citizens

ten years hence.

Perhaps the most dramatic example of the contribution of

intelligence to our security occurred in 1962 in the Cuban

Missile Crisis. But this story began long before in the

secret development of the U-2 aircraft to give us access to

areas where we had always been blinded. Its flight over

Cuba on October 14, 1962, provided the first certain evidence

the deployment of offensive missiles there, but intelligence

during

that crisis involved far more than the U-2. Through

the entire apparatus of intelligence, a close watch was main-

tained over all the ways in which our national security might

have been jeopardized, and it was precisely this centralized

analysis of thousands of individual bits of information that

provided our Government with reasoned

assessments and

estimates during the critical days of October 1962.

These

assessments drew on all types

. technical, diplomatic, and

military intelligence,

and they were substantially assisted

by the contribution made by at least one foreign agent who

paid for his commitment with his life.

He issue da it then in act

Mr. Chairman, the Intelligence Community has not been idle

since the development of the U-2, and the improvements that

have been made have

added a new dimension to the importance

of intelligence today--its contribution to the maintenance

of peace in the world.

As I believe is well known, the breakthrough in the strategic

Arms Limitations negotiations followed the development of our

ability to monitor whether or not the other side is complying

with the agreements made. To do so with respect to closed and

suspicious societies, intelligence has had to invest hundreds

of millions of dollars and heavy doses of imagination and

technical genius.

We have not yet convinced all the nations that might

pose a threat to us that our system of openness is the best

fox them as well as for us, so we must depend upon our intel-

ligence to give us the means

with which to negotiate with

• them and, at least, to limit, if not eliminate, the risks we

both run in today's world.

The peace-keeping role of intelligence goes beyond strategic

arms .

There are a number of situations in which our knowledge

of some local situation around the world was better than that

of the participants. By bringing this knowledge to both sides,

or to the one about to make a mistaken military move, intel-

ligence has

several times

assisted in defusing a potential

crisis

and thus disproving

our own predictions. This is a

contribution of which we are proud, for our purpose is not

merely to record facts pertaining to foreign situations

but to help maintain security and peace as well.

Intelligence likewise contributes to our internal secu-

rity.

The efforts of foreign nations to penetrate our society

and to manipulate our citizens are well documented. There

are several hundred foreign members of the KGB and intelligence

operatives in this country seeking information about the

United States and its plans, and their efforts must be met by

in intonsive countorintalligence effort. Within the Unitau

States, this is the function of the Federal Bureau of Invest-

igation. Abroad, it is CIA's responsibility to identify the

foreign agent before he arrives in America or to learn of

the plans of foreign groups to try to subvert our institutions.

To this traditional danger has been added a new threat

of international terrorism. CIA's foreign and the FBI's domestic

intelligence activities have collaborated to frustrate several

plans to bring to America and its citizens the kind of hijack-

ing and indiscriminate terrorist bombings that characterize

too many areas of the world. Intelligence has also contributed

to the identification of international narcotics traffickers,

reducing the threat this pernicious activity poses to the

health of our citizens.

Major political and economic decisions are regularly made

by our covernment and by our Congress with assistance from our

intelligence.

These decisions range from the appropriate level

of our defense buâget to economic and

monetary policy. In the

past several years the Intelligence Community--CIA, and parts

of State, and Treasury in particular--has paid considerable

attention to international economics and related political

issues. The interdependence of the world with respect to energy,

food, raw. materials, and service industries is increasing at

a very rapid rate. The accompanying shifts in economic power

and control can require future adjustments of grave importance

to our country.

American intelligence keeps watch on such

foreign activities. Stated another way, it is becoming as

important to our national security to watch the machinations

of foreign cartel arrangements as to follow Soviet or Chinese

missile development. Intelligence is critical to our coun-

• try's economic negotiations and we are contributing materially.

Mr. Chairman, I indicated at the outset the importance

of this Committee's getting a full appreciation for the con-

tribution intelligence is making, to our country. But foremost

in this process is the Intelligence Community's reputation for

objectivity in our intelligence assessments. We do not claim

that intelligence

analysis provides a scientific procedure for

reaching decisions.

We do feel it provides an essential

=6==

LAW 65360_Docld:32989530 Page 171

---

## Page 172

• mechanism for giving visibility to the issues for the policy-

maker. Our job is to provide an independent and objective

analysis based upon a wide range of confidential sources and

technical inputs. The organization of the Intelligence Com-

munity is designed to provide this independence and objectivity.

II.

The American Intelligence Process

Mr. Chairman, I would like to cover briefly the American

intelligence process, as I believe it is grossly misunderstood

by many quarters

who associate it almost exclusively with the

spectacular images of James Bond, Mata Hari, or even Maxwell

Smart.

americen intelligence is first and foremost an intel-

lectual exercise that encompasses the following steps:

1. The collection and assembly of raw informa-

tion from all sources available to the U.S. Govern-

ment, ranging from overt news dispatches to data

from the most secret technical devices or agents;

2. The assessment of the validity of the raw

information;

3. The analysis of the information and the

development of objective conclusions and judg-

ments; and

4. The presentation of the findings to policy

makers in a cleax, succinct, and timely fashion.

-7-

NW 65360 Docld:32989530 Page 172

---

## Page 173

The collection process involves acquiring open informa-

tion wherever this is possible. This information largely comes

from abroad but also here in the United States from knowledge-

able citizens and Government officers whose missions are well

understood and accepted in international life, such as Foreign

Service Officers, Defense, Treasury, and even Commercial and

Agricultural Attaches. To this is added the information col-

lected by technical means. Today these give us access to

areas

never before seen. Electronic marvels identify details

we never hoped to know, and computers select and store masses

of detail

never before manageable. These ways to collect are

supplemented by clandestine collection for those matters and

in those societies

where open or technical collection cannot

provide the secret war plans, the research idea before it is

visible, or a perception of authoritarian political dynamics.

After the material is collected, it must be processed

or analyzed. Again the electronic and computer worlds have

added new dimensions to our potential to extract valuable

information from hitherto incomprehensible indicators, al-

though, alas, the computer has also increased the incompre-

hensibility of some of the systems we try to identify.

=8-

NW 65360 Docld:32989530 Page 173

---

## Page 174

The analytical process is the smallest of our categories

of expenditure, but upon the integrity, the objectivity, and

the

expertise of this body of men and women rests the real

fruit of the whole process--reasoned assessments of develop-

ments abroad today and in the future.

An essential element of the process is the presentation

of intelligence to those who make the decisions for our nation.

In our society this is not restricted to the Executive but also

includes the Congress and the public. As a consequence, intel-

ligence has endeavored to bring its product to the Congress and

even to the public through unclassified publications where

possible, through classified testimony in executive session that

is later reviewed

so we can release all information that does not

reveal our sources and methods, and through informal discussion

with journalists and the academic community where conclusions

can be debated but sources omitted.

In addition, the Department of Defense has regularly made

available the results of the intelligence process, the best

example perhaps being the way we followed in the news media

the development and testing of the generation of Soviet missiles

now being deployed. When such material is consciously released,

it can be done in a form that

allows the Congress and the public

NW 65360 Docld:32989530 Page 174

---

## Page 175

to benefit from the conclusions and assessments involved but

still protects the sources and methods by which we reach them.

Unfortunately, their revelation by individuals without author-

ization can result in the exposure of the source or technique

by which we learn the information..

Mr. Chairman, the National Security Act of 1947 was the

foundation stone for this American intelligence process. At

that time, intelligence was deemed by our country to be a mat-

ter which

should be protected from public exposure. Thus,

the specifics of the intelligence process and its authorities

were deliberately expressed in general language and left by

that statute to be specified in classified directives by the

National

Security Council. The CIA Act of 1949 further rec-

ognized the importance of this secrecy to intelligence and

specifically exempted the CIA from the publication of the

'organization, functions, names, official titles, salaries,

Or

number.s

of personnel employed by the Agency.

The intelligence roles of the other members of the

Intelligence Community in part stem from the 1947 Act and

in part from separate legislation,

such as that charging the

FBI

with responsibility for internal security, the AEC, now

ERDA; with its security authorities, and other laws such as

Public Law 86-36, which provides the National Security

Agency the authority to function without disclosing

-10-

....

NW 65360 Docld:32989530 Page 175

---

## Page 176

information that would endanger its cryptologic functions. All

intelligence elements operate within legal authority. All are

given further direction by the National Security Council.

Those Acts, however, were not the end of Congress' role

with respect to intelligence. Intelligence operates on an-

nual appropriations, it reports to a variety of Congressional

committees, and the. Director and Deputy Director of Central

Intelligence are appointed with the advice and consent of the

Senate after hearings which, in the cases of General Walters

and me, included open sessions.

Congress long ago made special arrangements to handle

oversight and appropriations for intelligence. The consistent

position of the Executive Branch in this regard has been that

it would respond

to any way in which the congress organized.

itself to conduct this oversight and appropriations process.

To this, as indicated earlier, I add my own concern that this

• process be conducted

in a manner that preserves the

secrecy

upon which intelligence must rest.

In tune with the times, we have in more recent years,

and not just in my Directorship, become increasingly re-

*>.

sponsive to Congress both in executive session and in open

session.

For example, in 1974, I appeared before thirteen

committees or subcommittees on twenty-five occasions.

-11-

NW 65360 Docld:32989530 Page 176

---

## Page 177

• These were supplemented by informal responses or briefings to

interested members on a frequent basis. The result has been

greater exposure of the substance of our intelligence process

to assist Congress in its decisionmaking, as well as a

few.

untoward exposures of our sources and methods. I hope that

this Committee sets out clearer arrangements with both houses

so that we can make available the substance of our intelligence

to assist in your decisionmaking while protecting the intel-

ligence sources

and methods.

The Executive Branch directs

and supervises the intel-

ligence apparatus to insure that mur intelligenre agencies

work together for the common goal without duplication or

bureaucratic conflict. At the head of the structure is, of

course, the National Security Council, pursuant to statute.

The Council itself has issued general directives to the Intelli-

gence Community, and the subcommittees established under the

Council give more frequent guidance and direction to our effort.

Certain subcommittees focus on current crises and call for in-

telligence coverage thereof, certain work on longer term problems

that require intelligence analysis, and certain review the

work of the Intelligence Community in specified fields. I

will not get into the bureaucratic detail necessary to clarify

this at this session, although I certainly expect to do so in

• -12-

NW 65360 Docld:32989530 Page 177

---

## Page 178

the future..

I would like, however, to state my belief that

the Intelligence Community receives appropriate general guid-

ance

and direction from the National Security Council and its

committees. However, the Intelligence Community itself is

responsible for recommending actions needed or for recommend-

ing

the best way to accomplish the general goals set out by

policy leaders. Thus, general policy direction stems From

the National Security Council, but each of us in the Intelli-

gence Community takes full personal responsibility for the

actions

recommended or taken in conformance with such general

guidance and policy.

An independent review of the effectiveness of our intel-

ligence effort is conducted by the President's Foreign Intel-

ligence Advisory Board. This Board over the years has had

an important role in stimulating and supporting improvements

in our intelligence machinery. Its members are an impressive

group of responsible Americans who report their independent

views of the accomplishments and the weaknesses of the Intel-

ligence Community directly to the President.

Also in the Executive. Branch, the Office of Management

and Budget conducts through a compartmented unit the same type

of budget review of the work of the Intelligence Community as

it does of any department.

-13-

NW 65360 Docld:32989530 Page 178

---

## Page 179

The Intelligence Community is also subject to intensive

audit, both internally within the departments and agencies

involved, and to the extent feasible by the General Accounting

office,

Even in those areas exempted by law from GAO review,

our internal procedures follow the same standards and practices

of audit and accounting that apply to the other components of the

Government.

Lastly, consistent with the policy outlined in Section

102(e) of the National Security Act of 1947, the Director of

Central Intelligence has been charged by the President with

providing overall leadership to the Intelliyence Community.

He has been directed to review all expenditures for foreign

intelligence within the Government and make an annual recom-

mendation to the President as to the appropriate level thereof.

This charge requires him to insure that the intelligence ac-

tivities of the various departments and agencies give us the

best intelligence product at the least cost.

The Intelligence Community functions through a series of

committees and boards that bring the different agencies to-

gether. I have submitted añ™

annex to this presentation out-

lining these relationships. The work of these committees and

boards is limited to foreign intelligence, as internal

secu-

rity falls solely within the jurisdiction of the FBI. The FBI

-14-

NW 65360 Docld:32989530 Page 179

---

## Page 180

participates in the Intelligence Community effort, however,

so that any contributions that foreign intelligence might

make to internal

security can be properly handled. I will

not take your time here to describe all of these bureaucratic

arrangements, but I would like to stress the scope and com-

plexity of the Community so that its individual elements

be understood.

The collection of raw information consumes the highest

percentage of the resources devoted to intelligence. Large

sums are required for the complex technical systems I mentioned

earlier. In addition, the very substantial increases in mili-

tary and civilian personnel costs over recent years have put

a large burden on our intelligence budget despite reductions in

personnel. In conformity with the Senate's vote on June 4th,

1974, I do not propose to discuss these figures publicly, but

I do believe that you will be impressed with the way the In-

• telligence Community has increased its productivity over the

years and also reduced its size and focused its effort in

order to adjust to inflation.

III. The Needs of Intelligence

.">

Mr. Chairman, in recognition of the fundamental purpose

of this Select Committee, I indicated early in my statement

that I wanted to outline for you some of the ways in which our

-15-

NW 65360 Docld:32989530 Page 180

---

## Page 181

• Intelligence Community might be improved so as to open a new

era in American intelligence. In this context, I believe this

Committee may want to focus particularly on the role and pro-

cedures of intelligence in the future as well as in the past.

First, Mr. Chairman, I believe it essential to clarify

for the Congress and the people of America, as well as the

personnel in our Intelligence Community, the authorities, the

limitations, and the mission of American intelligence. When

President Eisenhower assumed full responsibility for sending

a U-2 over the Soviet Union, and President Kennedy for the Bay

of Pigs, they

repudiated in the name of the American people

the old concept of intelligence being disowned. I am confident

that our people not only support but insist upon an effective

intelligence apparatus to protect their security and welfare.

I believe, however, that they want the role of intelligence

clearly spelled out, they want controls adequate to pre-

vent abuse, and they also want necessary secrecy protected.

In my confirmation hearing, I suggested the word "foreign"

be inserted each time the word "intelligence" appears in the

charter

the CIA, to make,crystal clear its proper function

and to end any possible "gray area" in its authority. Legisla-

tion was introduced in the last Congress that would do this

and would also clarify the proper role of the Agency within

the United States. I welcome such clarification of our authority

-16-

## Page 182

ima.

and any limitation on our activities desired by the people

of this country. Just tell us in the intelligence business

what the nation wants and does not want, and we will do our

best to satisfy it. But also give us a way openly to change

these rules when the nation expects them to be changed.

With respect to oversight of our activities, Mr. Chairman,

I have described the current procedures. I believe they are

sufficient on the Executive side, and I reiterate that the

oxganization of the Congress to carry out its responsibilities

is not a matter for my determination or recommendation. I do

honestly request and trust, however, that the Congress will

organize itself to protect the necessary secrecy of our

intelligence operations while exercising its responsibilities

for oversight.

Lastly, I most earnestly request of the Congress some

improvement in our ability to protect the secrets necessary

to effective intelligence operations. The spectacle that we

are presenting to the world of being unable to prevent ex-

employees from revealing their knowledge of intimate relations

with individuals and frienaly

intelligence services who put

their trust in us is raising a substantial question as to

our ability to obtain information from such sources in the

future. The revelation of our

• activities from a series of

leaks of supposedly secret testimony makes it impossible to

-17-

NW 65360 Docld:32989530 Page 182

---

## Page 183

===^

contemplate the initiation of sensitive operations today

under procedures that require their exposure to a large num-

ber of reviewing bodies. The issue of whether we should

again adopt Secretary Stimson's view that "gentlemen do not

read each other's mail" land that we live in a world of

gentlemen) should be faced squarely and openly by the Con-

gress and not through irresponsible individual exposures.

IV. Cooperation with the Committee

Mr. Chairman, I assure you, as I did on the telephone

when you were named, of my most sincere intention to cooperate

with you and this Committee in its work. I look forward to

your, as well as our, contribution of ideas to the shaping of

the new era that American intelligence can have if we do our

work well. By my presence here I indicate my intention to be

as open and public as I can be during your proceedings. There

will be, however, many matters which, I am sure you will agree,

can only be handled effectively in executive session. For this

purpose, your staffs have been given appropriate clearances by

the committee, and I urge that you take steps to insure not

only that they will abide by the Committee's sules but also that

you have the legal ability similar to the one we use for our

employees to require any later exposure of such matters to occur

only after you have had a chance to review whether they may

improperly reveal sensitive information.

-18-

NW 65360 Docld:32989530 Page 183

---

## Page 184

There are some matters, Mr. Chairman, which I am required

under the statute and as a professional to protect against any

chance of exposure.

The names of our agents, the names of many

patriotic Americans who have worked with us, and the specifics

of a number of our costly and delicate technical systems are

so important, Mr. Chairman, that I believe an additional level

of secrecy is necessary to protect them. The lives of

individuals are at stake, and we cannot put them to risk.

There are also cases where the reputations and future prospects

of a number of patriotic Americans who have helped or con-

tributed to our

intelligence process could be jeopardized if

their associations are revealed openly and then twisted in

the press through misunderstanding or by hostile opponents.

American intelligence cannot hope to have any future if it

repudiates the understanding of confidentiality upon which

cooperation was extended to it. There are also a range of

specific methods for gathering information which needs to be

secret. Hundreds of millions of dollars in complex technical

equipment can be made worthless if the access it provides to

foreign secrets is exposed.

.. »

An exposure is a one-time sensation, and American in-

telligence today is suffering internally and abroad from a

series of exposures and sensational exaggerations which have

-19--

NW 65360 Docld:32989530 Page 184

---

## Page 185

:_

raised questions among many of our foreign individual and of-

ficial sources, and also among our personnel. Whether the

Intelligence Community can continue its contribution to our

nation's security and welfare and the maintenance of peace in

the world will depend on our ability to conduct this review

without further exposures. Thus, I do not propose to provide

these details, but if oné becomes of particular importance

to the work of the Committee, I will certainly consult with

you and the ranking minority member to determine the best

course of action. I stress this, Mr. Chairman, as we have

but one chance to avoid unwarranted disclosures which can ruin

-the lives or the futures of people and institutions which

put their trust in our nation through its intelligence

service. I believe that you and the Committee will want to

fulfill that trust, and that this Committee's inquiry can be

comprehensive and searching without violating it.

Mx. Chairman, I have not discussed the newspaper al-

legations that led to this Committee's formation.

• I have

reported fully on this to the President, to the President's

Commission, and to the Senate Appropriations and Armed

Services Committees. I am

submitting for the record of this

Committee my remarks there

and am, of course, prepared to

expand on them. I believe it only appropriate here to deny

-20-

NW 65360 Docld:32989530 Page 185

---a

transa

---

## Page 186

flatly, as I have already, that CIA conducted a "massive

illegal domestic intelligence operation."

I have also submitted for the record a number of annexes

to this statement, mostly in classified form, in order to set

out fur the use of the Committee and its staff some further

detail about our intelligence apparatus and its work. I am,

of course, available for further questioning here today and

to cover classfied questions in Executive Session when this

may prove

to be necessary. I hope that out of the Committee's

work will come a better public understanding of the role

and functioning of American intelligence today and that the

Committee's

recommendations for improvements in our authority,

procedures, and protection may indeed be looked back on in the

future as the initiation of a new era in American intelligence.

We in American intelligence are proud to be of service

to our country, and we firmly believe that the personnel of

American intelligence, and my predecessors in this post, have

served their country well over the years.

We

are equally con-

vinced that our intelligence profession

will

serve the country

well in the new era of

Amexican intelligence being launched by

this Committee.

Thank you.

On 1-23-75 Tom Hart, Professional Staff Member,

Senate Judiciary Committee, advised Inspector John B. Hotis

that the creation in the Senate of a Select Committee on Intelligence

Operations raises serious questions about the future of the FBI

Oversight Subcommittee. The Select Committee will make a final

report to the Senate in September, together with recommendations

as to any new legislation that might be necessary. It is possible that

a new committee dealing solely with the intelligence community may

be created or that recommendations will be made that there be stronger.

oversight by the parent committee.

Hart said that he is troubled over the mounting pressures in

the Congress to reduce the power and effectiveness of the Bureau.

He feels that is what is behind the "phony stories" that have suddenly

Ybeen circulating about Bureau files on Congressmen. Even some of

the "right wing Republicans, " he said, are attempting to capitalize on

the controversy, hoping thereby to take some of the criticism away

from former President Nixon.

He said thai some of the younger Senators are attempting to

take over the oversight responsibilities on the grounds that Senators

Eastland and McClellan have been overly protective of the Bureau.

It is important, therefore, that the Oversight Subcommittee show some

immediate activity. As soon as the confirmation hearings on Attorney

General Designate Levi are completed, Hart will go to the Rules

Committee to get budget approval for the Oversighi Subcommittee.

ORIGIN AND DISPOSITION

OF THE

HUSTON PLAN

ALL INFORMATION CONTAINM

HEREIN IS UNOLASSIFIAD BEGUY*

BACKGROUND:

By letter dated 6/20/69 Tom Charles Huston, Staff

Assistant to the President, addressed a letter to the Director, FBI,

stating that the President had directed that a report on foreign

communist support of revolutionary protest movements in the

United States be prepared for his study. According to the

Huston

letter; the President specifically requested that the

report draw upon all the sources available to the intelligence

community, that it be as detailed as possible, and

that the word "support" should be liberally construed

to include all activities by foreign communists designed to

encourage or assist revolutionary protest movements in the

United States.

The letter stated that on the basis of

earlier reports submitted to the President on a more limited

aspect of the problem, it was apparent "present" intelligence

collection capabilities in the area were inadequate. Huston

stated the President wanted to know what resources were currently

targeted toward monitoring foreign communist support of

revolutionary youth activities in the United States, how

effective they were, what gaps existed in our (U.S.) intelligence

because of either inadequate resources or low priority of

NW 65360 Docld:32989530 Page 205

attention and what steps could be taken, if the president

directed, to provide the maximum possible coverage of these

activities.

The request was also sent to CIA, NSA and DIA

sceking contributions relating to this same problem.

Pursuant to the request, the FBI and CIA submitted available

information on the matter. These responses were handled

unilaterally and without coordination between CIA and FBI.

On 6/5/70 Director Hoover met with President Nixon

at which meeting the President appointed him as chairman

of a

special intelligence committee to coordinate a more effective

intelligence-gathering function. I He also instructed that

the FBI, Central Intelligence Agency (ClA), National Secusiiy

Agency (NSA) and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) were to

coordinate their efforts to insure that comprehensive informa-

tion would be obtained for the President's use which would

provide him with a worldwide picture of the efforts of new left

and subversive groups in directing dissident activities in

the United States. Present at this meeting were CIA Director

Richard Helms; Vice Admiral Noel Gayler, NSA; General Donald V.

Bennett, DIA; Mr. Tom Charles Huston, White House Staff Assistant;

"Hearings before the Committee on the Judiciary, House of

Assistant to the President H. R. Halgeman; Assistant to the

President for Domestic Affairs John D. Ehrlichman and Robert H.

Finch, Secretary of the Department of Health, Education and

Welfare.

An initial meeting of the Interagency Committee on

Intelligence (AD HOC) was held in Mr. Hoover's office on

6/8/70. This meeting was attended by Mr. Helms, Vice: Admiral

Gayler, General. Bennett

and Mr. Huston, Mr. Hoover

emphasized the President's keen interest in the problem of

intelligence collection and outlined the general objectives to

which the Committee was to address itself. He instructed

that

a working subcommittce be established composed of

repcesentatives of all the member agencies which subcommittee

was to be headed by FBI Assistant Director William C. Sullivan.

The first meeting of the working subcommittee was

held on 6/9/70. At this meeting Mr. Huston presented

the subcommittee with an outline which he stated the President

desired the subcommittee to follow in preparing its report.

The outline addressed itself mainly to the purpose, procedures

and objectives of the subcommittee's review. The following

from the outline is quoted:

"PURPOSE:

(A)

(B)

(C)

To define and assess the existing internal

security threat.

To evaluate the collection procedures and

techniques presently employed and to assess

their effectiveness.

To identify gaps in our present collection efforts.

and recormend steps to close these gaps.

uhan

To review current procedures for inter-

community coordination and cooperation and

to recommend steps to improve these procedures.

To evaluate the timeliness of current intelligence

data and to recommend procedures to increase

both its timeliness and usefulness.

To assess the priorities presently attached

to domestic intelligence collection efforts

to recommend new priorities where appropriate.

PROCEDURES:

(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

Although the sub-committee will be officially

constituted within the framework of USIB, it

will in fact be an independent, ad hoc, inter-

agency working group with a limited mandate.

Operational details will be the responsibility

of the chairman.

However, the scope and

direction of the review will be determined by

the white House member.

The sub-committee will submit its reports to the

White House and not to USIB. Report will be

due by July 1, 1970.

To insure that the President has all the options

available for consideration,

direct detailed interrogatories to individual

agencies in order to ascertain facts relevant

to policy evaluation by the President.

Information resulting from such interrogatories

will, if the contributing agency requests, be

treated on a confidential basis and not be

considered by the sub-committtee as a whole.

OBJECTIVES:

(A)

(B)

(C)

Maximum coordination and cooperation within the

intelligence community. The sub-committee

may wish to consider the creation of a permanent

Domestic Intelligence Operations

Board, or

some other appropriate mechanism to insure

community-wide evaluation of intelligence data.

Higher priority by all intelligence agencies

on internal security collection efforts.

Maximum use of all special investigative

techniques, including increased agent and

informant penetration by both the FBI and CIA.

to be issued by the Interagency Cömmittee. This Report, which

was captioned "Special Report Interagency Committee on Intelligence

signed and approved by the heads of each member agency at a

final

meeting of the Committee held in Mr. Hoover's office on

6/25/70.3

The Report footnoted several objections by the FBI

to certain options contained in the Committee's Report. These

objections are enumerated in a latter portion of this paper.

A copy of the "Special Report" was delivered to Mr. Huston at

the White House on 6/26/70. The "Special Report" was divided

into three main sections: Part One, a

summarized estimate of

the internal security threat; Part Iwo, a summary of various

operational limitations on certain intelligence collection

techniques with cited advantages of maintaining such restrictions

as well as the advantages of relaxing them; and Part Three,

an evaluation of interagency cooperation with suggested

measures to improve the coordination of domestic intelligence

collection.

During the first week of July, 1970, Huston sent

the

"Special

Report" to H. R. Haldeman with a memorandum

entitled "Operational Restraints on Intelligence Collection.

In his memorandum Huston recommended that the President,

from among the options discussed by the "Special Report,"

select;

in

most areas discussed, the options relaxing the

restraints on intelligence collection. 5

On 7/14/70 Haldeman sent a memorandum to Huston

stating the President had approved Huston's recommendations

for relaxing restraints on intelligence collection and

requested a formal decision memorandum be prepared.

the "Special Report" and had made certain decisions with

respect to issues raised therein. The President's decisions

called for a relaxation of certain existing restraints on

intelligence coverage including the following: NSCID-6 was

to be interpreted to permit NSA to program for coverage the

communications of United States citizens using international

facilities?

the intelligence community was directed to intensify

electronic surveillance coverage of individuals and groups in

the United States who pose a threat to the internal security;

restrictions on legal mail coverage were to be removed and

restrictions on covert mail coverage relaxed to permit its use

on select targets of priority intelligence; restraints on the

use of surreptitious entry were to be removed on certain high-

priority targets; the coverage of violence-prone campus and

student-related groups was to be increased; CIA coverage of

American students traveling or living abroad was to be increased;

the restrictions on the use of military undercover agents

were to be retained; each member agency was to submit a

detailed estimate of manpower and monetary needs required to

implement the decisions; and a committee consisting of the

directors of representative agencies or appropriate alternates

was to be constituted effective 8/1/70 to provide

evaluation of domestic intelligence, prepare periodic

domestic intelligence estimates, carry out other objectives

specified in the Report and perform such other duties as

the President should from time to time assign. The Director

of the FBI was appointed to serve as chairman of this committee.

An attachment to the memorandum from Mr. Huston captioned

"Organization and Operations of the Interagency Group

on Domestic Intelligence and Internal Security (IAG)" set forth

specific composition, operations and duties of this new committee.

On receipt of the letter from Mr. Huston the Director,

FBI, addressed a letter to the Attorney General dated 7/27/70

pointing out FBI objections to certain of the decisions reported

in the Huston letter. Mr. Hoover objected to relaxation of

electronic surveillance policy, the implementation of covert mail

coverage, the removal of restrictions on the use of surreptitious

entry of embassies to obtain cryptographic. materials, the removal

of controls and restrictions relating to the coverage of

violence-prone campus and student-related groups and the

establishment of a permanent Interagency Committee on Domestic

Intelligence. The Director stated that in the "Special Report"

he had pointed out his opposition to these aspects of the

Report and requested of the Attorney General a prompt

expression of his views concerning the matter. He noted that

no action to implement the instructions contained in Mr. Huston's

letter would be taken pending a reply from the Attorney General.

No further action to implement the Huston letter

subsequent to the 7/27/70 letter to the Attorney General was

instituted by the intelligence community. There is no indication

that the Attorney General ever responded to this communication.

Since its existence was first revealed publicly during

the height of the Senate Walergate Committee investigation in

1973, the Intelligence Evaluation Committee (TEC) has been the

object of suspicion and misunderstanding. Unfortunately

associated by some politicians and representatives of the

media with such things as political spying, illegal electronic

surveillance and surreptitious entry, it was nothing more than

an effort by the Exccutive Branch to better coordinate and

disseminate intelligence information received by various in-

telligence and investigative agencies in the Federal Government.

While the fact of its existence was kept secret, which may have

contributed to the misunderstanding of its purpose and function,

the IEC was not an operational entity. That is, it did not

conduct its own investigations as did the FBI and other agencies.

Nor did it engage in surreptitious entries, wiretapping or

other similar activity. It merely received data collected

by the agencies represented on the Committee and put this

information into one comprehonsive report or estimate for

dissemination to interested agencies and individuals within the

Executive Branch. The Committee was staffed by career personnel

within the United States. The meeting took place on November 10.

1970 in Mr. Mitchell's office and, according to a memorandum

dated November 12, prepared by MI. Mardian, past attempts to

elicit such cooperation from interested depariments and

agencies of the Executive Branch had been unsuccessful. It

was decided that Judge Sharp, John Dean, then Counsel to the

President, and Mx. Mardian were to contact the heads of

various agencies and explain the wishes of the President and

seek their advice and cooperation.

in Congress which caused the Attorney General and the White

House to be concerned that it would be difficult to maintain

appropriate security regarding the Committee's work with

Judge Sharp as its head. Mardian stated that at a meeting at

the White House on January 21, it was decided that Judge

Sharp would

be removed from the Committee and assigned other

consultane duties with the Justice Department.

Subsequent memoranda revealed that certain individuals

were designated by their respective agencies as representatives

on the Intelligence Evaluation Committee, and by February 10,

1971 a document outlining the authority, mission, membership,

staff, procedures and functions and office space and facilities

drafted and presented to each of the member-representatives.

Functions and Purpose

According to the February 10, memorandum, the purpose of.

the Intelligence Evaluation Committee was to provide intelli-

gence estimates to the respective Government departments and

agencies on a need-to-know basis, in order to effectively

evaluate and anticipate problems

for appropriate response to

civil disorders. In carrying out this mission, the Committee

was to have access to all pertinent intelligence in the

possession of the United States Government. The membership

WAS

to consist of representatives

from the Department of

Defense,

Department of Justice, Central Intelligence Agency,

Federal Bureau of Investigation, Secret Service, and National

Security Agency and "when necessary, representatives of other

departments and agencies designated by the Committee." I/

The Committee was to be supported by a permanent staff

consisting of representatives from member departments and

agencies and headed by an Executive Director appointed by 'the

Committee.

The staff was to perform certain functions which

included: (1) when requested by the Committee, agency repre-

sentatives would furnish to the staff all pertinent information

relevant

to the stated request of the Committee; (2) prepare

estimates; (3) report information gaps; (4) recommend subjects

for intelligence estimates; (5) prepare relevant studies and

reports; and (6) provide for the secrecy of the information

received and the protection of all, sources of the information.

The Department

of Justice provided necessary office space,

supplies and incidental administrative support. (See

Attachment 3) .

1/ In his report of January 15, 1975 to the Senate Appropri-

ations Committee, Director of Central Intelligence willian

E. Colby stated that the State Department was represented

on the IEC. It was not. However, at some time after its

formation, the Treasury Department appointed a representative

to the Committee.

Mr. Hoover initially declined a request from Mr.

Mardian to provide staff support, but on May 17, 1971, the

Attorney General requested that the fBI provide two agents

and one secretary for the permanent working staff of IIC:

hoover acceded to this request.

Meetings and Reports

John Doherty of the Department of Justice was named as

the first Executive Director of the Intelligence Evaluation

Committee and

with the approval of the Assistant Attorney

General, Internal Security Division, Jales McGrath, a staff

attorney, was assigned as his assistant. Subsequently. Bernara

Wells, a former Special Agent of the Federal Bureau of Investi

gation replaced Mr. Doherty, who retired from government service,

as Executive Director in September, 1971. Weekly meetings were

held with representatives of the various agencies and procedures

for agency contribution to IEC estimates or reports were

adopted. (See Attachment 4) •

The first estimate or report prepared and disseminated

by the IC was designated E-1 dated February 18, 1971 entitled

"April-May Demonstrations" dealing with the potential for

violence during

the anti-war demonstrations in washington and

other parts of the country planned for April-May 1971. During

the period February 18, 1971 to April 30, 1973, the Committee

NW 65360 Docld:32989530 Page 219

---

## Page 220

- 7

produced and disseminated 31 estimates or reports dealing with

such subjects as anti-war demonstrations, potential for vio-

lence in major cities, black power organizations, Arab

terrorist groups, prison riots, and related topics.

There is

attached a complete list of all of the estimates or reports

produced and disseminated by the IC during its

existence.

(See Attachment 5). The estimates were disseminated to the

Counsel to the President; Director, Central Intelligence;

Director, National Security Agency; Director, Secret Service;

DineLiui, Ecöcial Bureau of Invostigation; Dircotor, Cificc of

Low Enforcement,

Treasury Department; the Assistant Attorney

General, Internal Security Division, Department of Justice;

and the Defense Intelligence Agency. No estimates were

produced after April 30, 1973. A communication to all .

interested

agencies dated June 11, 1973 pointed out that

inasmuch as the end of the war in Vietnam had resulted in the .

termination of demonstrations

which carried a potential for

violence, there was no longer any useful function to be served

by the IC and that, effective immediately, the IEC would no

longer be in existence.

During July, 1971, Mr. Mardian, at a meeting of the

IEC, stated that President Nixon had requested a

• report regara-

ing the handling of classified information, which was prompted

/ NW 65360 Docld:32989530 Page 220

ans'

by the Pentagon Papers case. Shortly thereafter, the IBC,

staff was advised that White House Staff Member Gordon Liddy

had been appointed to work with the Ic regarding its study of

the handling of classified information and by November, 1971.

the IC completed and disseminated a special report entitled

"The Unauthorized Disclosure of Classified Information."

Relationship of the IEC to the "Huston Plan"

In June 1970, J. Edgar Hoover met with President Nixon,

at which time Mr. Hoover was appointed chairman of a special

committee to coordinate more effectively the intelligence-

gathering efforts of the FBI, CIA, NSA, and DIA. The head

of each of these agencies was present at a June 5, 1970 meet-

ing with the President, which included White House Staff

Assistant Tom C. Huston. Subsequently, a working subcommittee

headed by Assistant Director William C. Sullivan of the FBI

was formed, and it held a series of meetings beyinning June 9,

1970. A final meeting held in late June

1970, a

"Special

Report" was filed and approved by the head of each member

agency.

The "Special Report"

• which was

submitted by Mr. Hoover

to the President, was divided into

three

sections:

a surmaty

of the internal security threat;

summarized limitations on

certain intelligence collection techniques; and, a brief

evaluation

. of interagency cooperation, with suggested measures

to improve the coordination of domestic intelligence collec-

zion.

Mr. Hoover objected to certain options

for relaxation

of restraints on intelligence gathering. Although President

Nixon at first approved the relaxation of certain restraints,

this approval was rescinded about five days later.

Inquiries by Various Committees of

Congress and Other Entities Into

the Operations of the IEC

since

its üisclosure, the IC las been the target of

a number of investigations and

inquiries, none of which has

revealed any illegality or impropriety. The Senate Select

Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities (Senate Water-

gate Committee) interviewed former IEC personnel. in 1973, and

• member of the Committee staff was offered access to all IEC

reports and documents. The final report of the Watergate

Committee published in June 1974 makes no reference to any

improper or illegal activity by the ILC, but devoted a section

to the Huston

Plan.

(See Attachment 6)

The House Judiciary Committee Investigating the Impeach-

ment of Richard Nixon (Rodino Committee) did not see fit to

conduct any investigation of the IEC, and onc may conclude that

NW 65360 Docld:32989530 Page 222

---

## Page 223

.. 10 -

it developed no information which would require scrutiny.

The

Senate Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights (Ervin Committee),

after submitting voluminous questionnaires to the Department of

Justice beginning in August, 1973 regarding the activities of

the former Internal Security Division, was given complete

information and access to all documents relating to the IEC

and, to date, has reported no finding of impropriety or

illegality.

The Watergate Special Prosecution Force has been given

complete access to the documents and iccorde of the committeo

and it has conducted interviews of former Committee repre-

sentatives

and staff with no report to the Attorney General

Of any improper conduct. Moreover, the IC will continue to

be a target of inquiry by the recently formed Select Committee

to Study Governmental Operations With Respect to Intelligence

Activities (Church Committee).

In his testimony before the Senate Watergate Committee,

former Counsel to the President, John

Dean,

testified that

"I am unaware of the IC ever having engaged in any illicit

activities or assignments." See,

Hearings Before the Select

Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities of the United

States Senate, 93rd Cong., Ist Sess., at 916 (1973).

SECRET

PROCEDURES FOR THE AGENCIES CONTRIBUTION TO IEC ESTIMATES

1. The INTELLIGENCE EVALUATION COMMITTEE (IEC) has been

charged with the responsibility of providing intelligence

estimates to designated Government departments by effectively

evaluating and anticipating problems of civil disorder.

To evaluate a potential problem it will be necessary for

IEC to request each assisting agency to prepare an

intelligence analysis.

The analysis, in the form of

evaluated contributions, will be forwarded to the Executive

Director of IEC.

These contributions, pursuant to requirements

set forth by Ic, will become the basis for the IC's

intelligenco estimate of potential problems of civil disoraei.

2.

The IEC does not desire to receive a voluminous collection

of intelligence data from the member agencies.

The

contribution should be an evaluation of the particular

situation based on the data which that agency has in its

possession. The IC Staff may issue GUIDELINES, to assist the

five agencies in the preparation of their intelligence con-

tribution. Additionally, such GUIDELINES will be of

assistance to IEC in identifying intelligence "gaps" and

the basis for making supplemental requests to the individual

agency for further intelligence information.

3.

The following format will be generally used by the IC

evaluation staff in the preparation of intelligence estimates.

It would be of great assistance if the participating agencies

would follow the same format when submitting the completed

contribution.

1. THE HUSION PLANT

The earliest evidence that this concept of presidential power existed

is found in a 19TU top secret document entitled "Operational Restruints

on intelligenco Collection,

"to and the various memorandums from

Tom Charles Fluston to H. R. Haldeman which ere first revcaled by

John Dean. In preparation for his testimony before the select Corn-

mittee, Dean placed these papers, some of which bore the highest se-

curity cla sineation, in the custody of Chiet Judge John Strick of the

U.S. District Court for the Dierrict of Columbia. This stop was taken

by Deen, on the adrice of counsel, to aroid riolation of any tresidouvui

directive of Federal lass prohibiting release of Goveimm-nt docu-

Inents affecting national security. liter due consideration, Judge Si-

rica released one copy i th se papers to the Department of Juice and

one copy to the Select Committee, pursuant to its motion.

(United

States v. John Doe, et al., Alise, No. TT-T8, JLay It, 1978)

The committee, with the aid of various intelligence agencies, re-

mered these documents. While the committee sealed a few cros there-

in, which could involve national security considerations, it concluded

that these papers, for the most part, dealt primary with domesuc

iftairs and were unrelated to national security matters.1s The papers

is Sanitized by the committee, were entere.. into the committee's recor

during Dean's testimony. 1a

These papers and the Fresident's own statement of slay 22, 1973,

disclose that the President approved the use of illegal wiretapping, il

legal break-ins and illegal mail covers for domestic intelligence pur-

poses. The resident was tully advised of the illegality of these intel

ligence-gathering techniques prior to approving them. In the top secret

document entitled "Operational Restraints on Intelligence Collection,"

the recommendation for surreptitious entries (break-ins) contalned

the following statement under the heading "Rationale":

•Use of this technique is clearly illegal. It amounts to

burglary. It is also highly risky and could result in great em-

barrassment if exposed. However, it is also the most trutiul

obtained in any other fashion.

On July 1t 1070, Flaldeman sent a top secret memorandum to

Huston, notifying him of the President's approval of the use of bur-

illegal wiretaps and illegal mail coters for domestic intelli-

gence. In the memorandum, Haldeman stated :

The recommendations you have proposed as a result of the

review, have been approred by the President. Ile does not

of your memorandum remiting implementation. He mould

of course, be prepared and that should be the device by which

to carry it out

It appears that the nest day. July 1ã. 1970, Huston prepared a desi-

sion memorandum, based on the residents approvai, for castribution

to the Federal intelligence agencies involved in the plan-the 1 B1, the

Cid, the National security Agency and the Defense Intelligence

Agency 2 In his alay 22, 1073, publie statement, the President reported

that the decision memorindum was circulated to the agencies involsed

on July 23, 1970. Fosterer, the decision remorandum is dated July 15,

1970, indicating that is was forwarded to the agencies on that day or

shortly thorcatter.

Huston's recommendations were opposed by J. Edgar Hoover,

Director of the IBI.2 Hoover had served as the chairman of a group

comprised of the heads of the Federal intelligence agencies formed to

study the problems of intelligence-gatherig and cooperation among

the various intelligence agencies? In his pablic statement of May 22.

1973, President iTison stated:

After reconsideration, however; prompted by the opposi-

tion of Director Iloorei, the agencies were notifud a days

later, on July 23, that the approval had been rescinded.

Haldeman's testimony is to the sume effect. * Dean, hoseter, testified

that he was not aware of any recision of approval for the plan * and

there appurently is no written record of a recision on July 28 or any

decision memorandum of July 15, 1970. Jr. Hoover did present strong

Fluston was concerned that Hoover's objections would interfere with

the plan's implementation. On ugust 5, 1070. 8 days after the Presi-

dent states he ordered recision, Fluston sent Haldeman a lengthy top

secret memorandum on the subject, "Domestic Intelligence,

among Flaldeman, the Attorney General and Hoover?" Inlicatito of

the fact that the plan was still quite alire, but imperiled by Floorer, is

the following language in this memorandun:

At some point, Floover has to be toid iho is President. He

has become totally unreasonable and his conduct is retri-

mental to our domestic intelligence oparations... It is

important to remember that the entire intelligence community

Inows that the President made a positive decision to go abead

gets his way, it is going to look like he is more powerful than

the President. Fle had his say in the footnotes and RA decided

against him.

people worked their asses off to prepere and which, on the

merits, was a first-rate, objectire job. 30

It should be noted that this memorandum indicates that the ISA,

DIA, CIa and the military serrices basically supported the Huston

recommendations.

Two days later, on August 7, 1970, Huston sent a brief, confidential

memorandum to

coast to vacation for 3 weeks. If you wait until mis return to clear up

the probiems surrounding our do nestic intelligence operations, we will

be into the new school year without any preparations.

Later, on September 18, 1970 (almost 2 inonths after the President

claims the plan was rescinded), Dean sent a top secret memorandum

to the Attorner General suggesting certain procedures to "commence

our domestic inteligence operation as quickly as possible." [emphasis

added] This memoranduni specifically called for the creation of an

Inter-agency Domestic Intelligence Unit which had been an integra

part of the Huston plan. Dean's memorandum to the Attorney (eneral

observed that Floover was strongly opposed to the creation of such :

unit and that it vas important "to bring the FBI fully on board.'

Far from indicating thut the President's approval of Huston's recom-

mendation to remove restraints on illegal intelligence-gathering had

been trithdrawn, Dean, in his memorandum, suggested to the attorney

General:

any blanket removal of restrictions; rather, the most appro-

SENSTUDY 75 is the code word for a new control file for all communications

xelating to the Senate Select Committee (SC) to conduct investigation and study of

conventional operations with respect to intelligence activities.

Pursuant to recommendation in memorandum W. O. Cregar to W. R. Wannall

dated 1/27/75 regarding the SSC, I attended a meeting of the Ad Hoc Security Group

of the U. S. Intelligénce Board (USIB) Security Committee at CIA Headquarters on

2/5/75. Security representatives'from DIA, NSA and CIA were present at this meet-

ing which was concerned with proposals to protect the integrity of classified documents

which will necessarily be provided the SSC during its investigation. Results are set

forth below.

Attached are copies of: (1) proposed agreements the Director, ot Central

Intelligence (DCI) will be asked to obtain from the SSC; (2), guides for protection

of elassifed information and of documents furnished the SSC; and (3) proposed.

secrecy agreement to be executed by SC staff members and employees.

. These

items were discussed paragraph by paragraph and revisions agreed upon were

penciled in. These revised drafts will be discussed at a meeting on 2/7/75 of

the Ad Hoc Group of USIB on Congressional Investigations to be attended by

Section Chief W. O. Cregar. At this time a final version will be approved for

presentment to the DCI.

The registry of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy referred to on

page 2 of the guides was described as a facility geared to handle and account

for classified documents to the satisfaction of the intelligence community. It

is guarded and has a suitable al

m system. BEC-18 /

The guides include the possibility that agencies presenting testimony may

conduct their own security sweeps of the hearing room; calls for a system of

document control as well as control from reproduction and distruction of classified

material. Consideration of secure transcription procedures is requested with the

possibility that each agency could provide such service. It might be necessary,

however, to provide escort service in the event outside transcribers are utilized.

This would entail security of carbons, waste and notes and return of the transcribed

testimony to the Committee upon completion. It was also suggested that a security

officer be appointed by the SSC who would be a central contact for representatives

of agencies falling within the purview of the SSC investigation. Attached material

was reviewed by Legal Counsel Division by Inspector J. E. Herington who concurred

with the exception of item number 4 of the proposed guidelines dealing with counter-

measures of inspections to preclude, ". . . surreptitious use of transmitters and/or

unauthorized recording devices similar to the device located in the Rayburn House

Office Building on 12 February 1973." He noted this wording could be construed

as placing a limitation on what type of device could be prohibited and suggested

revising the above phraseology by placing a period after "recording devices" and

then stating, "It is noted such a device was located in the . . ."

OBSERVATIONS:

At this time it is unknown if the above-mentioned material will be accepted

by the SSC or whether the committee will draw up its own procedures. In any

event, the material to be presented will at least serve as a means of calling the

Senators' attention to the many faceted program involved in the protection of

classified information. It is felt concurrence with the attached material with the

suggested observation of the Legal Counsel Division be accepted is to our best

interest.

ACTION:

It is recommended Section Chief W. O. Cregar offer the revision referred

to above at the meeting on 2/7/75 and be authorized to offer FBl concurrence with

Memorandum W. O. Cregar

to W. R. Wannall, dated

1/24/75, entitled 'United States Intelligence Board

Meeting of 1/24/75," recommended that Section Chief William/o.

Cregar's name be provided to the Deputy Director of the

Intelligence Community Staff as a point of contact within the

FBI to coordinate matters dealing with the 'Senate Select

Committee (SSC). The mandate of the SSC is to examine the

extent of overt and covert intelligence activities in the U.S.

and abroad..

On the morning of 1/27/75 Mr. John Clarke, Deputy

Director of the Intelligence Community Staff, advised that

Mr. Colby believes it is

necessary for security representatives

of FBI, CIA and National Security Agency (NSA), to meetin

order to develop recommendations for the SSC as to how documents

and testimony furnished to the SSC will be protected against

unauthorized disclosure, In this regard, Mr. Donald E. Moore,

former Inspector in the

Intelligence Division and currently

Chairman of the USIB Security Committee, will function as the

USIB representative to this group.

OBSERVATIONS:

REC-111

42-46325=

According to the Senate Resolution dated 1/21/75

relating to the investigation and study of cavenmontut opera-

tions with respect to intelligence activities,

the SSC is going

to involve all agencies of the Intelligence Community.

In

anticipation that Bureau representatives will be called to testify

and asked to supply some extremely sensitive documents regarding

our investigative activity in the U.S, it is believed essential

that we have an input into how such documents and testimony are

going to be hanäled by staff personnel of the Committee.

Unless

we participate in developing security standards, we may find that

sensitive documents and testimony that we are called to provide

to the Committee cannot be adequately protected from public

scrutiny.

DATE 925/00 BY SPE ARTIC Director Soc'y-

At a meeting of the USIB this morning Chairman

Colby spoke briefly about Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)

procedures for testifying before the Blue Ribbon Commission

BRC) Investigating ClA as well as anticipated problems tha

night arise regarding future testimony at the Senate Selec

Committee (SSC) whose membership has not yet been announced.

According to Colby, the mandate of the SSC is to examine the

extent of overt and covert intelligence activities in the

U. S. and abroad.

Colby advised that the Ssc would involve

all member agencies and departments of the intelligence

community and for that reason he believed the members of the

intelligence community should stay in close communication.

As a result of the above, Colby has selected

Mr. John Clarke, Deputy Director of the Intelligence Community

Staff, to act as a coordinator for the intelligence community

to insure close coordination.

He requested that all agencies

and departments represented on USIß designate one individual

in their agency as Clarkes point of contact to insure the

close coordination Colby

feels will be necessary during future

appearances before the ssc.

The Intelligence Division believes

this is a desirable procedure and recommends that Section Chief

William O. Cregar who is the Bureau's alternate member on USIB

be designated as the Bureau representative to maintain liaison

with Mr. Clarke.

REC 111)

In addition, Colby advised that in his opening

Ka 2n his 03125-12

statement before the

SSC he intends to make a strong pitch

for the intelligence community. He proposes to show the value

and importance intelligence has played in the past as well as

the luture;:he expects to outline for the ssc how the intelli

gence business is run and organized. In addition, he proposes

in his opening statement to make an appeal for legislation to

shore up the protection of sources and methods against planned

and calculated leaks of classified information.:

Memorandum for Mr. Wannall

RE: UNITED STATES INTELLIGENCE

BOARD (USIB)

MEETING OF 1/24/75

Colby advised that any examples member agencies

or departments could provide CIA wherein the acquisition of

intelligence proved useful to the development of U. s.

policies or programs would certainly be appreciated. Colby

stated that

in this regard Mr. John Clarke as the over-all

coordinator would be in touch with the designated representa-

tives of USIB departments or agencies to further clarify this

point.

With regard to the BRC chaired by Vice President

Rockefeller, Colby advised that CIA has already obtained an

agreement from that Commission that any documents furnished

to the Commission by CIA would have the names of CIA employees

and/or CIA sources deleted from the document. The purpose of

this deletion was to avoid such names from appearing in press

releases.

Colby also hopes to obtain the same agreement from

the SSC.

The Intelligence Division believes that the Bureau

should also attempt to obtain such an agreement from the

BRC and the SSC if at some time FBI representatives are called

to testify or are called to produce FBI documents.

This matter

has been discussed with the Office of Legal Counsel and it

concurs in this recommendation.

ACTION:

If approved, Section Chief William O. Cregar's

name will

be provided to Mr. Clarke as his point of contact

within the FBI

(2) Should Bureau representatives be called to testify

before the BRC or the SSC an agreement be obtained to delete any

names of FBI employees and/or sources with the understanding that

the identities could be made available to either the Commission or

Committee if either felt such names were absolutely necessary.

SELECT COMMITTEE OF THE SENATE

This memorandum recommends that we provide at

Mr. Colby's request two lists:

(1) information which the

FBI

feels under no circumstances could be discussed with

the Select Committee of the Senate (SCS) and (2) items of

information which could be discussed with the SCS under

controlled conditions.

On the afternoon of 2/1/75, Mr. John Clarke, in

his role as Chairman of the Ad Hoc Coordinating Group for

Congressional Inquiry, telephonically advised the Bureau's

representative on this Group that a meeting was held at

the White House on the morning of 2/1/75.

Participants were

the secretary of Defense, the Director of Central Intelli-

gence and Dr. Henry Kissinger in his role as advisor to the

President on national security affairs.

Dr. Kissinger

requested Mr. Colby to prepare two lists for the President's

consideration.

The purpose of these lists was to provide

the President with information necessary for him to make a

judgment as to whether certain information should be with-

held

from the SCS on the basis of executive privilege.

As a result of the White House meeting, Mr. Clarke

requested

the Bureau prepare by the close of business, 2/3/75,

two lists: (1) that information proprietary to the FBI which

under no circumstances could be discussed with the SCS and as

a result would require the denial of such presentation by virtue

of executive privilege and (2) a list of information proprietary

to the FBI which could be discussed with the SCS under controlled

conditions (presumably this means discussed in Executive Session

limited to members of the SCS).

Director Sec'y_

This memorandum recommends that Mr. Colby, in

his role as the Director of Central Intelligence, be furnished

two write-ups for inclusion as annexes in a briefing book he

plans to provide the Select Committee of the Senate (SCS) on

the occasion of his appearance as the lead-off witness before

маісіт

this Committee.

The write-ups are: (1) the role of counter-

intelligence and (2) the origin and disposition of the "Huston

Plan."

A previous memorandum was approved that Section Chief

William O. Cregar be designated as the point of contact within

the FBI to coordinate matters dealing with future testimony.

before the SCS.

Mr. John Clarke, Associate Deputy to the

Director of Central Intelligence, has been designated as the

coordinator for the Intelligence Community. The points of

contact under Mr. Clarke's auspices have been given the tiule

Ma hoc coorainating Group for Congressional Inquiry.

on 1/31/75 Clarke held a second meeting of this Group

wherein he reiterated that it was Mr. Colby's intention to make

a very strong plea for the Intelligence Community as the lead-

off witness.

In addition, Mr. Colby plans to provide to the

SCS a series of annexes, some of which will be classified, which

will address some of the issues to be looked into by the scs.

Those issues have been generally identified in Senate Résolution

Number 21, dated 1/21/75.

Representatives at Mr. Clarke's

meeting were asked to prepare certain of these annexes.

The

FBI was requested to prepare the annex on the role of counter

intelligence as well as the

of the "Huston Plan."

REC-11 pn the origin and disposition

62-1163956

The Intelligence Division in responding to the request

from Clarke's Group will prepare these two write-ups ItS

anticipated that there will be no problems in connection with

the write-up on counterintelligence and this is goine forward.

Memorandum for Mr. Wannall

RE:

SELECT COMMITTEE OF THE SENATE

62-116395

With regard to the origin and disposition of the "Huston Plan,"

we anticipate having an initial paper ready for discussion

actively involved in the development of the Plan.

Department's participation is necessary inasmuch as the Intel-

ligence Evaluation Committee (IEC), chaired by the Department,

evolved from one of the recommendations set out in the "Huston

Plan." Mr. James Wilderotter, Associate Deputy Attorney General,

member of the Ad Hoc Coordinating Group for Congressional

Inquiry and is preparing an input to the "uston Plan" annex,

SENATE SELECT COLMITTEE

TO CONDUCT AIT INVESTIGATION AND STUDY OF

GOVERIVIENTAL OPERATIONS WITH RESPECT TO

INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

With regard to legislation proposed by the FBI,

a letter was sent to the Office of Legislative Affairs,

Department ôf Justice, on August 29, 1974, strongly

reconnending that consideration be given to a legislative

proposal that would authorize the Government to conduct

court-approved electronic surveillances in domestic security

This recommendation was based on the Supreme Court

decision which held that electronic surveillances conducted

solely within the discretion of the Esecutive violated the

warrant requirement of the Iourth Anendent and our opinion

that the current standards imposed by Title III of the

Omnibus Crine Control and Safe Streets Act of 1970 would be

AEM/ITE

In another legislative bill pending in the United States

Senate, Senate Bill S3001, although the FBI was not the

sponsor of the bill it has a particular intcrest in its

passage both for internal security and foreign counterintel

ligence considerations.

This bill would nale it a Federal

offense to obtain; produce, sell or utilize false docunentation.

of possible interest, in recognition o1 questions

Which have been voiced as to the jurisdiction and authority

of the FBI to conduct donestic intelligence investigations

Inasmuch as the captioned Cormittee, to bo referred

to hereinatter as the see, will, of necessity, be concerned

in part with highly cencielve infornation relacins to

national security, this bureau suggests that agreenent of

the SSC be sought for the adoption of the following security

measures and procedures, both in the interests of nationzl

security and of protection of privacy of individuals:

In the resolution establishing the SSC it vas

established that no employce of the SaC or person perforning

tasks for the SSC on a contractual banis should be given

acceps to classified material unless appropriately cleared for

access to such naterial by the sSc.

It was indicated that

the type of clearance would be connensurate with the type

of intornation to be rade available to such persons under

conditions agreed upon by the ssc.

In this regard it would

be desirable for the ose to stipulate that no staii rember

nho is to be given access to any raterial, testicony, or

inforration received or scherated by the

connittee other than

that which is, in essence, public in ortation be granted cuci

access without prior receipt of a security clearance based on

a full field investigation.

Consideration nighi alco be givon

The SSC should adopt rules to insure that the

Assoc. Dir. -

SENATE SELECT COMMITTIE

TO CONDUCT AN INVESTIGATION AND STUDY OF

GOVERNHENTAL OPERATIONS MITH RESPECT TO

INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

There have been public charges that the FBI has

operated for 50 years vithout oversight or any external

controls. This is not accurate. In the Congress, several

bodies have had jurisdiction over matters affecting FEI

prograus and activities.

These include the Appropriations

Connittees of both Houses, the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee

on Constitutional Rights and on Administrative Practice and

Procedure,

a special Senate Foreign Relations Subconnittee

on Surveillances, the louse Judiciary Connittce, the former

Ilouse Conmittee on Internal Security, the Coverment Operations

Cormittees of both the llouse and Senate and the senate sub

cormittee on IDI Oversight.

During 1972 the President's Foreign Intelligence

HAVISOLY sOard, With the lul. cooperation of the ibt,

cOnt

ducted detailed and extensive examination of the IDI's activities

as a member of the United States intelligence conmunity.

The Foreign Relations Authorization Act of 1972

created a Cormission on the Organization of the Governuent for

the Conduct of Foreign Policy.

That cormittee made inguiries

of members of the intelligence cormunity regarding the role

of intelligence as it affects the conduct of our foreign policy.

In its research the comittee looked into certain pertinent

IBI activities and had contact with IBI representatives both

in the United States and abroad.

This recommends code word IS ENSTUDY 75 be adopted

as title of new control file for communications regarding

subject.

; On 1/21/75 the U. S. Senate reported Senate

Resolution 21 to establish captioned committee.

Committee will look into operations of members of the

U. S. intelligence community including the FBI. The Committeer

is being chaired by Senator

Frank Church of Idaho. We have

already received and responded to requests from the Ad Hoc

Coordinating Group for Congressional Inquiry for information

to be used by Mc. William Colby, Director of Central Intelligence,

in preparing for his anticipated initial appearance before the

committee.

The Ad Hoc Group is composed of representatives of

U.S. Intelligence Board member agencies and departments to

deal with. "SENSTUDY 75."

For administrative convenience,

as well as economy,

it is suggested that copies of all communications and material

dealing with the activities of the committee be placed in a

new control file, 62-116395, and that the code word "SENSTUDY 75"

be adopted as a brief title

for internal communications

relating to this matter.

FBIHQ indices contain no references

to that code word.

the FBI to honor name check requests on stalf employees received

Senator Baker had also indicated to the FEl that he had no

idea as to tho would have the responsibility of conducting the background

investigations which must be conducted, and this is to confirm your

approval that ve contact Director William f. Colby of the Central

Intelligence Agency regarding their desires in this matter since they

employees of committees receiving sensitive FEI information. Following

discussions with Mir. Colby, contact will be had with the Chairman of the

* No domestic spies?

Allegations and disclosures about CIA and

NeBI surveillance of Americans within U.S. bor-

ders have been interpreted by some as a type of,

domestic spying that could have a chilling effect

on the exercise of political expression. One

response has been that all domestic intelligence

operations should be eliminated. Recent events

show this, would be a non solution, a patent

overreaction.

Most public opinion and most judicial opin-

ion, we suspect, would not consider it an inva;

sion of constitutional nights of privacy i the FBI
