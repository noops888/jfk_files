1, This case requires an Enoch Arden decision.

2. The Subject has apparently performed valuable ser-
vices for the FBI and us. Asa result of the service for the
FBI in an undercover capacity, he testified for them | again t
eleven leaders of the Communist t party.

3, Much as the Subject appears to deserve a position
for his services, I do not see how we can accept him as a

publicity about his Renslee he work has blown his usefulness -:
in operations in(P (Pan ma ajas he will be a man marked by the
Reds from now on. Then, there is some question concerning
the reason that he was selected for recruitment by the
Communists although this can probably be clarified with

Mr. Papich.

4, It is recommended, therefore, that the request
for conversion be denied. Presumably there is no objection
to Subject's continued use as a contract employee for limited
duties after we clarify the question of his. recruitment by ..
the Communists. . - oe
