THE GERMANS WER: TOLO AT THE OUTSET THAT HE INSISTEO

ON KEEPIME COPIES OF THE THANSCRIPTS.

UNDERSiC A ME PROTE CAN SIS NES THE A HE ASTH THE

OISPATCHEO AGENT. HE STATED THAT THIS WAS CONSIDERLO EXTREMELY

UNLIXELY IN VIEW OF THE INFO ME HAD PROVIDED.

HOT HAVE NEEDED TO PAY SUCH A HIGH PRICE IN COMPROMISED AGENTS

AND OPERATIONS IF THEY WANTED TO FEED US A PHONY DEFECTOR.

ALSO MADE THE UNSUBTLE SUGGESTION THAT THE KGB UIDN'T NEED TO SEND

US AN AELADLE TO GET INFO ONCUPHILL JINTERNAL SECURITY PROBLEMS.

WE REALIZE THAT THE ABOVE IS NOT SUFFICIENT ARPUMITION

TO PERSUADE TIE DOUBTING THOMASES TO CHANGE THEIM VIEWS.

ALES PIERCE ARTES ARE MORE SERE CATACTS TO NEE

OR ALIAS FLEMING THAT THEY ARE IN FACT PERPETUATING THE XGB/

DISINFORMATION'S OWN LINE ON AELADLE.

AND SOME SIMILAR RUMBLINGS WHICH HAVE

BEEN RECEIVED FROM PARIS.

IF UPHILLIAND THE FRENCH

HAVE BEEN GETTING TOGETHER ON THE AELADLE

MATERIAL. UPLS REPORT ANYTHING. THAT COMES TO YOUR ATTENTION ON THIS
