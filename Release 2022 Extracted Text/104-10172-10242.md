1. WE FIND THE OPINIONS REPORTED IN REFS A BIT DISTURBING,
WHILE WE 00 NOT SUGGEST A PCINTED ANC DETAILED REBUTTAL AT THIS
TIME, IT 15 REQUESTED THAT ANY FUTURE EXPRESSIONS OF THIS TYPE
BE FIRMLY COUNTEREO WITH A REITERATION OF OUR PREVIOUS STATE-

MENTS, NAMELY~ }

A. AELADLE ADMITTEDLY HAD LITTLE INFO ON KGB OPS IN
GERMANY INASMUCH AS HE WAS NEVER DIRECTLY ASSOCIATED
WITH KGB GERMAN OPS. THIS POINT WAS MADE CLEAR FROM

THE START.

B. AELADLE PROVIDED A WEALTH OF INFO ON MATTERS CONCERNI
OTHER AREAS HICH HAS CHECKED OUT WITH INFO AVAILABLE
FROM OTHER SOURCES. THIS INCLUDED INFO ON THE VASSAL
CASE. WHILE WE 00 NOT WISH TO CITE STATISTICS OR
SPECIFIC CASES, FOR OBVIOUS ‘SECURITY AND POLITICAL
REASONS, IT ES THE OPINION OF NOT ONLY KUBARK CI
EXPERTS, BUT OF OTHERS, THAT: AELADLE‘S INFO IS
BONAFIOE.

C. THAT HE WAS A HANDLING PROBLEM WAS MADE CLEAR FROM
THE BEGINNING. :

2. WHEN refer TEAM WAS HERE THEY RAISCO WITH THE
UNOSASIGNED THE ‘THEORETICAL POSSIBILITY! THAT HE WAS A
DISPATCHED AGENT, WE STATED THAT THIS WAS CONSIDERLO EXTREMELY
UNLIKELY IN VIEW OF THE INFO HE HAD PROVIDED. THE KGS WOULD

HOT HAVE NEEDED TO PAY ‘SUCH A HIGH PRICE IN COMPROMISED: AGENTS
ANO OPERATIONS IF THEY WANTEO TO FEED US A PHONY O&FECTOR. WE
ALSO MADE THE UNSUBTLE SUGGESTION THAT THE KGB DION'T KEEO TO SEND
US AN AELADLE TO GET INFO ONCUPHILL JINTERNAL SECURITY PROBLEMS.

3, WE REALIZE THAT THE ABOVE 1S NOT SUFFICIENT AMMUNITION
TO PERSUADE THE DOUBTING THOMASES TO CHANGE THEIK VIEWS. HOWEVER,
AT THE APPROPRIATE OPENING YOU HIGHT WISH TO POINT OUT TO UTILIT
OR ALIAS FLEMING THAT THEY ARE IN FACT PERPETUATING THE KGB/ gy)
DISINFORMATION'S OWN LINE ON AELADLE, iS

&. FINALLY, WE WONDER IF THERE 1S ANY CONNECTION BETWEEN
THE VIEWS OF[UTILITYJOET AL, AXO SOME SIMILAR RUMBLINGS WHICH HAVE
BEEN RECE{VED FROM PARIS. IT WOULD BE VERY INTERESTING TO KNOW
1F (UPHILLJANO’ THE FRENCH HAVE BEEN GETTING TOGETHER ON THE AELADLE
MATERIAL.O|PLS REPORT ANYTHING THAT COMES TO YOUR ATTENTION ON THIS

MATTER.
