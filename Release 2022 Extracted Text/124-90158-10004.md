Lhe On 4/8764, MM 639-S advised that LUIS.
-OSADA, i a charge. of training for the Junta Reyolu- |
_eiona: ana (JURE) , together w: with JURE members A
MAR: ae and LUISCPERNANDEZ, had recently ee
visited Clewiston, Florida, a town on the south shore pt

of Lake Okeechobee, where they contacted the Commissionér*/
of Hendry County, Mr. CAMPBELL NALL, for the purpose of
opening a training camp at the local airport. Commissioner
NALL was reluctant to give permission to the Cubans for use
of the airport property at Clewiston, because the Federal
Aviation Agency might object. In an effort to persuade g
Commissioner NALL, the Cubans offered to repair the x
buildings on the airport property and to pay for use
of the airport but NALL objected to this. (& AL)

According to MM 639-S, JURE, despite the
obstacles confronting them at Clewiston, were deter-

near future. The source stated that following tie

contact with Commissioner NALL, the members of JURE
proceeded to an established training camp located
somewhere between Clewiston and Tampa, Florida, about
80 miles from Clewiston. The source further advised
that JURE had 2 teams of 18-20 men per team, ready to
undertake training in guerrilla warfare. The in-
structors were to be Cubans who had been in the U.S.
Army; the source also believed that 2 or 3 American
instructors might be involved: (KY)

Also on 4/8/64, MM 639-S advised that JURE
has a bank account at the Central Bank and Trust Company ,
Miami, and the account might be in the name of JURE or
possibly in the name of LUIS POSADA. The source stated
that MARIO HERNANDEZ, one of the JURE members visiting
the afore-described training camp, resides at 7146 $.W.
26th Street, Miami. (fm) :

On 5/25/64, Mr. KENNETH BLONDUN, an officer
at the Central Bank and Trust Company, Miami, Florida,
advised that there was no account at the bank in the
name of Junta Revolucionaria Cubana or Cuban Revolu-
tionary Junta, or JURE. He advised LUIS POSADA of 1111
N.W. 34th Avenue, Miami, had opened a Special Account in
March, 1964. The record indicated POSADA had served in
the U.S. Army.

On 6/12/64, Mr. BLONDUN was recontacted, at
which time he made available the monthly statement of
POSADA's account, #4-69-236-2, together with the checks
issued by POSADA during the previous month. Only 5
checks had been drawn on the account during the monthly
period ending 6/4/64, at which time a balance of $18.50
remained in the account. The checks were made payable

On June 19, 1964 MM 639-S was recontacted,
at which time he advised he no longer had close asso-
ciation with JURE at Miami, and therefore was unimformed
as to the current training operation by JURE, however,
he believed that the training camp described in the
caption of this case is identical with the one he had
reported on 418164-6 a)

The Miami Office will interview persons asso-
ciated with JURE for information concerning the military
training of JURE in Florida and in particular on the
property of Weir W. Williams in Polk County, Florida.
