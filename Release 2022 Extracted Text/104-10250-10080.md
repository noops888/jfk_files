eG SERRE

27 January 1965

\NDUM FOR: Jim O'Connor, tTsp/Security

SUBJECT: Contact with Herman E, Kimsey - Jan Beck, TSD/GAR

1. As you requested at our meeting on 25 January, I heve prepared
this summary of my contact with Mr. Kimsey since he left the Agency
in August, 1962.

2. My contact with K, has been via the telephone, except for a |
couple of occasions when I had lunch with him or he visited Chief, G:RB :
in Central Building. I cennot recall ever calling him, but his calls :
to me have been mostly to the office and ‘only 2 few to my home.

3. With a few exceptions his reason for calling seexis to have : ;
been non-specific; he just wanted to chat. Often he would open the L
convers*tion wit 2 gambit ef asking for someone's telephone extension, :
more then once fo) rsion, or for Dick Kuhn's hore F

eiaress. Sometimes he would call my attention to something interesting

he had read in the paper about some new technique, some mutual friend, etc.

Occasionally he would sa be fishing for infortiation about old a1
. associates, mainly Hr§ land Dick Kuhn: how they were doing and !

what they were doing nowadays, and so on. Since I usually evoided |
answering such questions directly, I cannot tell if he already knew
about the person in question and wanted confirmation, or if he was
fishing. The bulk of the converstions then consisted mainly of
dialogue about his job plans, family, mtual friends outside the Agency, i
and so on. \

h. Several calls were about the one instance when I was directly
involved with him on a project, It pertained to a job opening which tt
I had heard about and wented to pess on to hin. It was as a document
exeminer or a related job with the Multnomah County Sheriff's Office,
Portland, Oregon. He seemed interested in pursuing the possibility, fase}
but in a recent conversation he had still not applied and did not seem t
interested, 7

5. The only other calls on a specific subject where those on !
the subject of the Anastasia story, early in 1964, and on the Polish |
colonel's claim, 22 January 1965. On the Anastasia subject he mentioned
his involvezett in the cese vie Cleve Backster and gave me the general
background as he saw it, jncluding a certain intrigue involving “Reds
working for 'Life! magazine" and the Soviet end British intelligence i
services p-obebly being in the background to protect their interests.

6, Until'.22 January hehad no‘. mentioned the subject of the
Polish colonel at all, He called re at home, and I immediately
tool up the subject since I had read about his disclosures in the
pay a week earlisr. ‘hen I prodded hin about baing in trouble
over the nowspsper interview, he appeared confident thet he was not
in any trouble because he was "in deily contact with Agency people".
He further said that his purpose in the disclosure was to pry loose
from the Agency those documents which would help the colonel establish
his true identity. But it was pretty obvious thet K, was surpised by
the big play given the story in the paper. In fact, he had even
considered calling the reporter and asking him to retract some
distortions - he did not say which - in the story, but on second thought
could not put his finger on any clear-cut error worth ‘fighting over.
Other items from the conversation: if the colonel's cleim is successful
E, and Cleve Backster would turn over any share of the fortune to
"the fund for prozi g the lie detector", except their expenses and
time nov paid out of ¥ K, is convinced of the coloncl's
claim to the fortune b: He did not seem to be fishing for
inf tion about the x : vr story. ALL”
gbout it wrs to ask how Lon Thor Give ne the
on thet he had e: (identity?) documents of the
1 z 1961 (7) beceuse he said th
cogize the men's picture if I sew it, But he diately changed
d "it wes probably before your time", hen I asked him
if he wasn't uing a matter which he only knew.about from his officiel
ca’ in working for the Government, he assured me that he had only
learned of the colonel's claim to be the son of the Czar late last year
(possibly he said at the time of the Presidential campaign). At the
end of the hour-long conversation he stated the reel reason for calling
and that was to tell me that the colonel was to be on television, the 11
otclock news on ABC/Chennel 7, This must have been 2 mistake on his part
because that is program is locol end not 2 network progra: from New York.

t

sery is the best of my recollection; if you need
additional information, I will be gled to fill in the gaps.

BECK
