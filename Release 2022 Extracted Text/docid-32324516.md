BIDS, Wesley P.

Cọl.,

RA 13166063

9 November 1953

On 23 June 1953; BIERS, among other PSw; signed a letter mailed to

Mrs. Florence Gowgill, 6159 Archer Avenue, Argo, Illinois. This letter

expressed gratitude for her activities as reported in the New Jork

"Daily. Worker of 16 and 19 October 1952, and in connection with the

"Save Our Sons! Committee!

From April to August 1953, BIERS was Chairman of the Advanced

Study Group of Camp #1. This was comprised of approximately six(6) of

the leading pro-communists in the Camp. Its function: was to prepare,

under the guidance of the Chinese, lectures and material for radio broad-

casts, as well as progrems for study groups at company leval. It occupied

the highest eschelon in the Pro-fommunist element.'

During his confinement BIBRS constantly applied himself to studies

of Communism. He wrote pro-communist articles for publication in the Camp

newspaper andfor Company radin broadcast purposes. One of thase

_was'

directed a Vishinsky and encouraged him in arguments he was then

presenting in the UN Assembly, Annther was in protest of the United States

Government treatment of repatriates at Valley Forge Hospital. Others

were directed to his family and were also of general, pro-communist nature..

In early August 1953 BITE was transferred to CCF Suprème Camp

Head uarters it, undergo intensive indictrination in preparation for

facing the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission as a voluntary non-

repatriate. He receivad such instruction until toward the end of August

and then was normally repatriated to, UN control.

BIERs spent his freo time in reading and study, 'swimming,

end in

conversation with Chinese personnel concorning improvement in

deily living

conditions, as well, as obteining answers to

"particular questions"

BIERS claims that frrm August 1951 he and Pfc. Bobby DeGraw planned

to sabotage the Chinese indoctrination progran. Partial success is claimed

by virtue of influencing

several Psw not to accept non-repatriation and

creating confusion in

the minds of PsWes to the desirnbility of the

Cormunist life.

BIIRS belives that Communism would not be successful in the United

States because the people are "basically selfish" and wuld ant

the regimentation end state ownership in Cimmunism. Americans are

accept

religious and Communism is apposed tr

raligion. Communisn takes away all

Individual freedom and BIERS "prefors" to do his "own thinking". Had BIARS

desired Communism he "wruld hav stayed with the Chinese".
