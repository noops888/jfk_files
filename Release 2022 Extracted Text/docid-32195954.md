U. S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE TO
STUDY GOVERNMENTAL OPERATIONS WITH
RESPECT TO INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

Reference is made to SSC letter dated November 12,
1975, containing requests for materials concerning Martin
Luther King, Jr.

Pursuant to request in paragraph one of referenced
SSC letter, on November 17, 1975, a Special Agent of this
Bureau, in the apts of SSC Staf£ Member Andrew Postal,
reviewed the file of Martin Luther King, Jr., and related
files for the months of November and December, 1964, for
‘i ¥ materials pertinent to the SSC inquiry not previously re-
ested. Materials being furnished herewith which are
lesignated as Item 1 are those documents requested by Postal
as a result of this review.

During the review, Postal indicated a desire to have
copies of all materials designated as Item 1. It was pointed
out that a substantial number of these had been previously
furnished the Committee in connection with other requests.
Postal indicated, however, that he was generally amiliar
with prior materials furnished in connection with the King case
and was desirous of obtaining all items he selected, even
though many might duplicate earlier FBI submissions.

Although there appears to be no real justification
‘ for duplicate submissioas, in view of Postal's specific
otf request, and in the spirit of cooperation with the SSC, the
requested documents are being furnished despite the fact that
a arrears the documents have previously been made available
to the . “

Materials designated Item 2 are being furnished in
response to request set forth in paragraph two of referenced
SSC letter of November 12, 1975.

SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

A search of the Martin Luther King, Jr., and related
files failed to result in the positive identification of
material prepared by the Domestic Intelligence Division sub-
sequent to April 23, 1964, in refutation of Martin Luther
King's statement to the press in San Francisco, California,
on April 23, 1964, referred to in Mr. Sullivan's memorandum
that date to Mr. Belmont captioned "Communist Party, USA,
Negro Question, Communist Influence in Racial Matters IS-c"
delivered herewith.

It may be surmised, however, that a document under
preparation in the then Domestic Intelligence Division in April,
1964, entitled "Communist Party, USA, Negro Question, Communist
Influence in Racial Matters," represents the material referred
to-in Mr. Sullivan's memorandum of April 23, 1964. That
document is a lengthy work paper which was periodically brought
up to date to show every facet of information available re-  -
garding communist influence in the racial movement and does
contain information in refutation of King's statement of
April 23, 1964, which in essence challenged the FBI to provide
evidence regarding the commmist infiltration in the racial
movement. A copy of this document was furnished the SSC by
memorandum dated October 6, 1975. -

With respect to the excisions in materials being
delivered herewith, where no notations appear as to reason for
excision, the excision was made for the reason that the infor-
mation actually summarizes or quotes from conversations monitored
during electronic surveillances of King. In some cases, it
can be ascertained precisely what information in FBI files came
from electronic surveillances of King; however, there exist
areas where documentation of the information is not precise
and no accurate determination can be made. Therefore, no .
assurances can be given that portions of the materials being
furnished do not contain information developed as a result of
electronic surveillances of King.

Reverend g that I was aware that allesations of this nature

determined that these charges were without basis.

Reverend King categorically denied ever having made
a personal attack on me and also denied that he had ever instructed

are encourzzed not to cooperate with the F , the solution of cases

Corimunist infiltration of the civil rights movement
was discussed. Reverend King stated that as a Christian he could
never accept communism and that he shared my concern with the
probiem, He described communism as a "crippling, totalitarian
disease. ' He said that while there are "one or two" former coi-
munists currently engaged in tund-raising activities for the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference, he does not tolerate communists in
his organization, He cited the communist background of Hunter Pitts

O'Dell and noted that he considered the success of the Southern Christian

Leadership Conference more important to him than his friendship with

The President

The problems confronting the FEI in civil rights

mace ii ciear to him tiat cases devesoped as a resuit of FSI

difficulties invoived in geiting white juries to convict white
defencants in connection with civil rights matters, I cited some of
our experiences in this recard,

He and his associates were advised of the recent
conferences held for local law enforcement officers throuchout the
United tates jor the puroose of fully acquainting them with civil richts
legislation and their resooasizilities in connection with same. I told
him tuat tue resuica of this campaign have been encouraging in the
cooperation received.

T pointed out to him that there is a creat miscaderstanding
today among the general public ana particularly the Nezro race as to
ine sil's role in civil rights matters. i emozasizea tnat the FEIis an
investicative aveacy, that it cannot recommena prosecution or maxe
on-ine-ejot arrests waere « eueral laws have not been violated. He
was advised that the FSI will not protect civil rights workers or
Negroes because the ¥EI does not have the authority or jurisdiction
to do so. He was also advised that the 7 Bi cannot and will not
exceed its authority. i.everena Sing was told tiat our investigations
are conducted in a thorough and impartial manner, but if he or any of

I wanted to know about it immediately. :

Reverend King indicated that the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference is planning to engage in voter registration
activities in Selma, Alabama, cn or avout January 1, 1965, and that
he bas learneu tiat there could be violeace. I told him that our Agents

influence on King. Wilkins diverted from the subject oi the conversation to spend som?
time in explaining that he had also noted communis the civil rights m

leaders of the Negro movement have tried consistently to
keep communists out of policy-forming areas and positions of
leadership.

King quoted the AG against the Director, to the effect

that it is to be expected that communists will try to infiltrate i
civil rights movements, but they had not succeeded in making i

Jt is very unfortunate that Mr. J. Edgar Hoover, in his :
claim of alleged communist infiltration in the civil rights ef Pid ‘

The more significant truth is the amazing lack of success

“Re: .CP,USA; NEGRO QUESTION; :
COMMUNIST INFLUENCE IN RACIAL MATTERS; IS - C.

on this question last summer; "It is natural and inevitable
that communists have made efforts to infiltrate the civil
rights movement and to exploit the current racial situation.

.[ In view of the real injustices that exist and the resentments

against them, these efforts have been remarkably unsuccessful."

From my own experience in the civil rights movement, this
observation by the head of the Department of Justice is,
indeed, true and it should be paid heed by those who

periodically raise issue. One may ask, is this

dead issue being re vected at tnois time? hy is this

issue being used to smear and attack the civil rights

movement and the Cc. e in the SCLC adhere to our policy:
i

We co poor

ho raise the "red" issue, whether they be
new er columnists or the head of the FBI himself -- to come
forward and provide real evidence which contradicts this stand
of the SCLC. wie are confident that this cannot be done.

We challenge all

We at the SCLC must be judged by our record. I stand fully
and forthrightly behind the action taken by myself in my 10
years of civil rights activity and of the SCLC which I have
been privileged to lead since its inception in 1957. No
action, no deeds, no statement requires repudiation as being
inconsistent with our struggle to achieve an America free

of segregation through nonviolent persuasion and direct action.

We will continue to be vigilant against communist infiltration,
but we will also serve notice that we will continue to
resolutely wage the struggle for the full emancipation of the
Negro, \e will not allow ourselves to be diverted. We will
not allow Eastland, Barnett or the George Wallaces to use

the "red" issue to block our efforts, to split our ranks or
confuse our supporters. This resolution we make, ever

mindful that every effort is being made by the racists and the
Birchites to sow dissention and confusion to bring about the
defeat of the pending civil rights legislation.

Re: CP,USA; NEGRO QUESTION;

We affirm that SCLC is ynalterably opposed to the misguided
philosophy of communism. It is based on unethical i
relativism, a metaphysical totalitarianism, and the denial
of human freedom, which we could never accept.

It is difficult to accept the word of the FBI on communist
