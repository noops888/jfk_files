[ 2022 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992

2 April 1961

SUBJECT: Funding of AMIRON and AMBUD Organizations

1. With the launching of the AMBUD organization we are faced
with the immediate need of re-appraising our funding relationship
with AMIRON, If one considers that AMBUD is, for all practical
Purposes, an outgrowth of AMIRON, it would appear completely
logical to expect AMBUD to take over certain functions which were
previously the responsibility of AMIRONas our chosen instrument,

- For all practical purposes, AMIRON has served its purpose and,
now that we have AMBUD, no longer needs to exist.

2, When AMBUD-1 returned from his visit to the camps, Peter
N, LICARI informed him of the urgent need for deciding what functions
of the AMIRON organization he wanted to take over. To date, we have
had no word from AMBUD-I on this subject.

3, Since we will probably not be successful in getting the desired
information from AMBUD-1 within the next few daye it is believed
that the following would be the most practical approach to the problem
of interim financing of the AMBUD organization and the gradual cur-
tailment of funds for AMIRON,

A, That LICARI inform AMBUD-1 that the sum of $15, 000
is being deposited to a separate account to be managed by
AMTIKI-1 separate from regular AMIRON funds, This fund
can be utilized by AMBUD-1 for:

(1) Salaries of a small public relations staff;
(2) Salaries of a small planning ataff;

(3) Travel and related expenses of AMBUD membera;

(4) Any miscellaneous expenses deemed necessary by
AMBUD-1,


B. The military section of the AMIRON organization and
the financial and auditing staff of AMTIKI-1 will be transferred
to AMBUD organization at the earliest practical moment,

C. Funds will be available to cover the expenses of a amall
“carctaker" force to represent AMIRON, preserve records,
newer inquiries,

D, All AMIRON personnel will be kept on the payroll through
, May 3let. They will bo #0 advised on or about I May.

E. The $58, 000 now budgeted for the operational expenses of
the "Committees" is being deleted immediately aince there ie no
longer any nced for AMIRON propaganda as such,

F, LICARI should continue to urge AMBUD-1 to give early
thought to his budgetary and personnel needs but should not
confront him with a deadline as we can rock along for the next
two woeks under present arrangemenfs,
