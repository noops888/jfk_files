caring for CARLOS and JACKIE MARCELLO. Informant stated that

mant stated that MARCELLO is taking various medicines and is
very morose. ‘Informant pointed out that MARCELLO is always
an early riser and always clothed in a suit, white shirt, and
tie. During the past six days, be has stayed in pajamas and
robe and Has looked very unkept.

spent a lot of time at the MARCELLO bome in the last six days,
and numerous other well-known New Orleans hoodlums have paid
calls on MARCELLO. :

Informant pointed out that on January 13 and 14,
1967, there was a lot of telephone activity between SANTO
TRAFFICANTE, unknown individuals in New York City, and.
JOSEPH MARCELLO, acting for CARLOS MARCELLO, Informant stated
that informant managed to Listen to several incoming calls over
a telephone extension. This, coupled with an argument between ,
the informant and JOSEPH and CARLOS MARCELLO relative to one
of these calls, has lead the informant to believe that the
following method is the system of telephonic contact used for
LCN business:

An incoming call comes to the MARCELLO. home

from a prominent hoodlum and he conducts a

brief innocuous conversation. This individual
will then indicate that he is busy and will call
bekin 15 minutes, one-halst hour, or an hour.” ‘
At time this individual imdicates that he will
eall MARCELLO at "Girl friend #1; girl friend
#2, ox girl friend #3." In the past, CARLOS

the appropriate time will receive the business

and the use of the term "girl friend" will throw
off anyone listening on the telephones. Infor-
mant stated that this process is inverted when

_to offer fifty acres of land of his Churchill Farms Estate e
-' free to the City of New Orleans as the site of the new dome
stadium. NO T-2 stated that MARCELLO. was willing to give the
choicest section of this estate free and clear to the city.

\

NO T-4 advised on January 5, 1967, that MARCELLO
stated recently that’ he has a twenty per cent interest in the
new dome stadium deal. NO T-4 stated that recently MARCELLO
had been in contact with FRANK WATERS, Houston, Texas, oil
man, who reputedly has some interest in the dome stadium deal.

On January 20, 1967, NO T-5 advised that he believed

that about one year ago CARLOS, JOSEPH, and SAMMY MARCELLO

made numerous trips to the Mississippi Gulf Coast. The reason
for these trips was that a small-group of businessmen desired

~ to have the MARCELLO brothers control gambling-on a small

island off the coast as they were in the process of developing
the island. CARLOS MARCELLO did not enter this deal as this
business group did not sell him some real estate on the island.

Mississippi Highway Safety Patrol (MHSP) investi-
gator JOE PRICE (NA), Gulfport, Mississippi, advised on
January 9, 1967, that he bas received no information to the
effect that the MARCELLOS have any business interest in the
Misisissippi Gulf Coast area ox that they have been frequenting
the area in recent months.

NO T-i3, Jazkson "PCI, Biloxi, Mississippi, advised
1 on January 20, 1967, that while recently in New Orleans, she

MARCELLO. Informant advised that in a conversation with ‘SAM |
DI PIAZZA, Di PIAZZA said be had been on the Mississippi Gulf
Coast several times recently attempting to locate some property
around "the strip" near Biloxi, Mississippi, to purchase and
put up some pizza houses. DI PIAZZA did not tell informant
that he was doing this.at the specific request of CARLOS
MARCELLO, but informant assumed that in view of the known
association between DI PIAZZA and MARCELLO, some of the racket
money in New Orleans would probably be. used to help finance
this business venture in Biloxi, Mississippi, if it takes
place. : ig
