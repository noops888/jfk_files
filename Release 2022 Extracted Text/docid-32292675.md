On January 1Y,

1967, NO 1457-C-TE advised that for

the past six days CARLOS MARCELLO has been sick at home.

Informant pointed out that MARCELLO's wife came out of the

hospital on January 12, 1967,

and is not yet ambulatory.

NO 1457-C-TE has spent the past six days at the MARCELLO home

caring for CARLOS and JACKIE MARCELLO.

Informant stated that

MARCELLO has advised his family that he is ill with a bad back

and that an arthritic condition is also bothering him.

and is

very morose.

Informant pointed out that MARCELLO is always

an early riser and always clothed in a suit, white shirt, and

During the past six days,

ne has stayed in pajamas

and

robe and has looked very unkept.

NO 1457C-TE pointed out that JOSEPH MARCELLO haS

spent a lot of time at the MARCELLO home in the last six days,

and

numerous other well-known New Orleans hoodlums have paid

calls on MARCELLO.

Informant pointed out that on January 13 and 14,

1967, there

was a lot of telephone activity between SANTO

TRAFFICANTE,

unknown individuals in New York City, and

JOSEPH MARCELLO, aCting fOr CARLOS MARCELLO. Informant

that informant managed

to listen to several

incoming calls over

a telephone extension.

This, coupled with an argument between,

the informant and JOSEPH and CARLOS MARCELLO relative to one

of these calls,

has lead the informant to believe that the

following method is

the system of telephonic contact used for

LCN business:

An incoming call comes to the MARCELLO. bome

from a prominent hoodlun and he conducts

brief innocuous conversation.

This individual

will then indicate that he is busy and will call

back in 15 minutes, one-half hour, or an hour.

At time this individual indicates that he will

call MARCELLO at "Girl

friend #1; girl friend

#2, or girl friend #3."

past,: CARLOS

MARCELLO would then proceed to a group of pay

telephones

somewhere in the shopping center

past six days, JOE MARCELLO would proceed to

this group ot

telephones.

JOSEPH MARCELIO

will occupy a public

telephone booth and at

the appropriate time will receive the business

call from out of state:

Informant stated that

CARLOS and JOSEPH MARCELLO have stated to the

informant that this is the method of communication

and the use

of the term "girl friend" will throw

off anyone listening on the telephones.

Infor

mant stated that this process is inverted when

MARCELLO initiates a contact with any LCN figure

out of state.

Informant stated that JOSEPH

and CARLOS MARCELLO have in their possession

a list of "girl friends" out of state; however,

they change the

numbers around in a manner only

they know.

ACTIVITIES

NO T-2 advised on January 5, 1967,

that he had

heard that CARLOS MARCELLO intended in the immediate future

to offer fifty acres of land of his Churchill Farms Estate

free to the City of New Orleans as the site of the new dome

stadium. NO T-2 stated that MARCELLO was willing to give the

choicest section of this estate free and clear to the city.

NO T-4 advised on January 5, 1967, that MARCELLO

stated recently that he has a twenty per cent

interest in the

new

dome stadium deal.

NO T-4 stated that recently MARCELLO

had been in contact with FRANK WATERS, Houston, Texas, o1l

man, who reputedly has some interest

in the dome stadium deal.

On January 20, 1967, NO T-5 advised that he believed

that about one year ago CARLOS, JOSEPH, and SAMMY MARCELLO

made numerous trips to the Mississippi Gulf Coast. The reason

for these trips was that a small group of businessmen desired

to have the MARCELLO brothers control gambling on a small

island off the coast as they were in the process of developing

the istand.

CARLOS MARCELLO did not enter this deal as

this

business group did not sell him some real estate on the island.

Mississippi Highway Safety Patrol (MSP) investi-

gator JOE PRICE (NA),

Gulfport, Mississippi, advised

January 9, 1967,

that he has received no information to the

effect that the MARCELLOS have any business interest in the

Mississippi Gulf Coast area

or that they have been frequenting

the

area in recent months.

NO T-13,,

Jackson 'PCI, Biloxi, Mississippi, advised

on January

20, 1967,

that while recently in New Orleans, she

was in contact with

SAM DI PIAZZA, who owns and operates pizza

houses in New Orleans and who is

a close associate of CARLOS

MARCELLO. Informant advised that in a conversation with 'SAM

DI PIAZZA, DI PIAZZA said he had been on the Mississippi Gulf

Coast several times recently attempting to locate some property

around "the strip" near Biloxi, Mississippi, to purchase and

put up some pizza

houses.

DI PIAZZA did not tell informant

that he was doing this at the specific request of CARLOS

MARCELLO, but informant assumed that in view of the known

association between DI PIAZZA and MARCELLO, some of the racket

money in New Orleans would probably be used to help finance

this business

venture in Biloxi, Mississippi, if it takes

place.

to the Mississippi Gulf Coast accompanied by JOE MARCELLO,

son of CARLOS MARCELLO. Informant was unable to advise the

nature and identity of contacts made by CAROLYN and JOE -

MARCELLO but stated that she would attempt to do so on the
