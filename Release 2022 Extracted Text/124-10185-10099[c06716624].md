I believe, Agency funds were made available to the FBI.

“ These funds may still be possibly held in a special

account for that use. This is one of the areas where

TSD has been very much involved. Chuck Briggs would

have the details as this was handled through the Executive

Areas of Possible Embarrassment
to the Agency 7

1, Sometime in the spring or early summer of 1971, Mr. John
Dean levied the requirement on the Agency for information relating to
the Investors Overseas Service (IOS). The original request was
non-specific but it gradually emerged that Dean was concerned with
the possible adverse publicily that might develop regarding the
President's nephew, who was employed by IOS.

2. There were multiple channels from the White House to the

Agency on this subject:

a, Presumably
Helms, °

Haldeman and/or Ehrlichman to Director

: b. Someone (unnamed) in the White House to the DDCI,
* General Cushman (see attached telephone conversation),
Note that Ehrlichman is mentioned, and

¢. John Dean to the CI Staff. These various channels

were sorted

out in time and six reports were passed by

the CI Staff to Mr. Fred Fielding for Mr, John Dean,

3. The telephone call of General Cushman's is of interest since
“it gives the flaver of White House concern. It took several days to
uncover the fact that the White House interest centered on the involve-
. ment of the President's nephew with IOS and possible adverse publicity.
‘The reports submitted to Dean's office were routine in nature and were

coordinated with the DCI.

Committee and Staff prepared by|Richard Ober. | The original

and the principal sparkplug for this group activity was the then

that Mardian would require very careful handling duc to his inex-
perience, Furthermore, Mardian was deeply involved in the split

-between Bill Sullivan and Mr. Hoover. Ona confidential basis

one or two senior FBI officials stated that Sullivan was secretly

passing files to Mardian without Mr. Hoover's permiission. This

was one of the important reasons why Sullivan was dismissed from

the Bureau, .

SUBJECT: The MHCHAOS Progran ©

1. The MHCHAOS program-is a worldwide program for
clandestine collection abroad of information on foreign
efforts to support/encourage/exploit/manipulate domestic

. U.S. extremism, especially by Cuba, Communist China,
-,North Vietnam, the Soviet Union, North Korea and the
Arab fedayeen. .

2..-The MHCHAOS program has not and is not conduct-
ing efforts domestically for internal domestic collection
purposes.: Agency efforts are foreign. Foreign-oriented
activity in the United States has been of two types:

a. Selected FBI domestic sources who travel
abroad in connection with their extremist activity
and/or affiliations to make contact with hostile
foreign powers or with forcign oxtremist groups
have been briefed and debricfed by Headquarters
officers. The bric£ing has included appropriate

‘operational guidance, including defensive advice.

b. Americans with existing extremist creden-
fe tials have been assessed, recruited, tested and
dispatched abroad for PCS assignments as contract
agents, primarily sources offered for such use by ,
the FEI. When abroad they collect information re-
Ne sponsive to MIICHAOS program requirements, as well
as other Agency requirements, They are thus used
primarily for targeting against Cubans, Chinese Con-
munists, the North Vietnamese, etc., as their back-
ground and their particular access permits. It
should be noted that the MPTROIKA aspect of the
MPLODESTAR project of the East Asia Division is
similar to the MHCHAOS PROGRAM.

3, As indicated earlier, MHCHAOS is a foreign pro-
gram, conducted overseas, except for the limited activity
described above. The program.is and has been managed so
as to achieve the maximum feasible utilization of exist-
ing resources of the Operations Directorate. No assets

: 2. Currently, there are 191 integrees for whom cover

is, provided by 140 companies; 179 integrees are located in

47 forcign countrics and 12 are located in the United States,
To maintain this placement level, CCS personnel axe re-
searching and monitoring approximately 250 to 300 companies
at any given time,

3. To minimize the adverse consequences to a cooperating
company, and to preserve the Agency's operational’ equity in
the event of exposure. of an individual under cover, it has
been established policy that no more than two individuals
would be furnished cover by the same company. . At the present
time this ratio is confined to upproximately 25% of the total
number of companies now being used and efforts are unde
way to effect further reductions toward the goal of one
individual per company.

4. In addition to the primary corporate cover function
described in: paragraph 1. above, CCS maintains continuing
contact with two U.S, car rental firms and two U.S, .credit
card firms for the purpose of obtaining backstopped credit
cards in alias for operational use in the United States and
abroad by Agency personnel, 42 such cards are now being
used by 34 individuals. q

between 12 March 1963 and,15 June 1963, and targeted two Washington-

| ‘based’ newsmen who, at the.time, had been publishing news articles

based on, and frequently quoting, classified materials of this Agency

h and others, including Top Secret and Special Intelligence.

4 Telephone intercept connections were installed at the newmen's
office and at each of their homes, for a total of 3. The connections
were established with the assistance of a telephone company official
‘who responded to a personal request by the Director of Security,
Sheffield Edwards. Col. Edwards! authority for the activity was M
“John-As McCone, Director of Central Intciligence. The latter conducted
the activity in coordination with the Attorney General (Mr. Robert Kennedy),
the Secretary of Defense (Mr. Robert McNamara), and the Director of

of-Central Intelligence (General Marshall S. Carter), the Inspector—
General (Lyman Kirkpatrick) and the General Counsel. (Mr. Lawrence
Houston). : . oe .

he intercept activity was particularly productive in identifying con-
tacts of the newsmen, their method of operation and many of their sources

of information. For example, it was determined that during the period they
received data from 13 newsmen, 12 of whom were identified; 12 senators
and 6 members of Congress, all identified; 21 Congressional staff members,
of whom 11 were identified; 16 government employees, including a staff
member of the White House, members of the Vice President's office, an
Assistant Attorney General, and other well-placed individuals. A number

sof other sources were partially or tentatively identified, butthe short span
of the activity precluded positive identification, It was observed that through
these contacts the newsmen actually received more classified and official

data than they could use, and passed some of the stories to other newsmen
for release, establishing that many "leaks" appearing under other by-lines
were actually from the sources of the target newsmen:

- : ". May 1973
MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: General: Office of Security Survey

. a
1, At the Director's instruction, and with the concurrence
of the then DD/P, the Office of Security developed informants in
_RID to report on the activities of RID employees on whom security
questions had arisen. This program, which included upwards of a
dozen informants at its peak, has declined to its present level of
three, only one of whom is reporting regularly on matters of current
interest,

2. The principal object of Security's interest through this
informant is a female who was employed in RID for a number of years
until she resigned in 1969. Her resignation coincided with the initiation
of a security review on her by the Office of Security, but Security does
not know whether the employee was aware of this security review at
the time of her resignation.

3. Security's interest in this employee was occasioned by
reports that she had developed an increasingly intimate acquaintance
with a Cuban national. Reporting by one informant, who was also
being developed by the Cuban, suggested that the Cuban might have
an intelligence interest in the female. The same informant also sub-
sequently reported that the Cuban had numerous other contacts among
clerical and secretarial employees of the Agency. Among these
employees is one girl who works in a biographic section in SB Division.

4. Subsequent to her departure from the Agency, the ex-RID
employee entered into a common-law marital relationship with the Fi
Cuban and joined him as partner in a photographic business. In this ye
capacity she solicited business among CIA employees, especially J
those requiring passport photos. Recently, she and the Cuban sought
to employ Security's informant in this business on a part-time basis.

————

fH

5. Information on the background of the Cuban is fairly extensive,

mber of anti-

Castro organizations! There are a.
his mother was imprisoned in Cuba at one time. Th.
episodes in his life that suggest intelligence involvement on his part
with some hostile service, but this is not yet definitely established.

but it is inconclusive, e is known to have been a
P this country.

6. The Office of Security has had at times a second informant
in this case. His reporting has tended to confirm reporting by the
principal informant. :

a ‘
7. There is conclusive evidence that the Cuban expressed :
interest in certain 20] files in the Agency, and there aré good groundsy
for believing that the RID female employee delivered at least one such
‘file to the Cuban while she was still in RID. There is also evidence
that the female employee in SB Division has continued in frequent
contact with her friénd,. the ex-RID employee, and the Cuban. On
one occasion, she served as intermediary for contact instructions
from the Cuban to O/S!s principal informant. The informant has no
knowledge, however, of any other requirements that may have been
levied on or satisfied by the SB employee. Neither does he know of
. the extent of contacts by this couple with other Agency employees
except social contacts,

8. {The Office of Security has been running this operation for —
‘over two years, in an effort to obtain conclusive proof ofits intelli-. *\\
gence nature. CI Staff has been kept informed. The FBI, which i
was informed of the case at an early stage, has declined to take re- if
sponsibility for it, on grounds that it concerns CIA's internal security.) i:
As a result, the Office ofSecurity has been inhibited in the actions ji
it can take against the Cuban suspect. On the other hand, Security f
has not taken any action against Agency employees for fear of com- fp
promising the-operation.} Dees “ee

9. It would appear to me that the Office of Security has dallied
with this case long enough. Apparently unable through positive measures
to resolve doubts about the case, O/S has followed, the course of watch-
ful waiting, hoping the Cuban would take precipitant action himself that
would give us the evidence we seek. In the meantime, our knowledge
of the relationship. between the Cuban and the several other current
Agency employees with whom he is known to have contact continues



to be quite limited. Neither the Cuban nor his girlfriend have made :
any further approaches to Security's informant recegtly, although he

+ continues to see theni@ocially. Thus, there is Ae es to believe
that further waiting will produce a break in the case.

10. There are two courses open to the Office of Security now.

It can attempt to have the Agency employees known to be in contact
with the Cuban transferred to nonsensitive positions. This might
alert the Cuban to our penetration of the operation, particularly

since a plausible reason for transfer would be difficult to develop

for some of the persons involved. Alternatively, Security could
move overtly and charge the Agency employees with violation of the
security regulation requiring reporting of contacts with foreign
nationals. This would, of course, terminate the Office of Security's
_ operation. : :

Hl, One of these courses of action should be “chosen promptly.
The possibility that the employee in SB Division may be passing
information o: s too great to warrant further
delay in moving against her. Moreover, it is possible that the Cuban
has current productive penctrations of RID. Thus, the risk of damage
to the Agency seems clearly to outweigh any. possible gains from
_continuing this CI effort. :

MEMGRANCUM FOR: Deputy Director for Management & Services

SUBJECT - 1 ,Press Allegations re Use of Agency
Polygraph, :

‘1,’ This memorandum is for your information only
ana confirms a Teport I nade to you by telephone earlier
today. : : :

2. On 22 July 1971, an article was carried on
American preposals relative to the SALT talks in The New
York Times over the by-line of Iden 181. It was
devastatingly accurate and contained direct quotes from
a Presidential advisory memorandum the White House had
sent to Mr, Gerard Smith, Director, Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency, a few days earlier. The President
was alleged to be furious with this unauthorized dis-
closure of classified information and directed a sweeping
investigation within the United States Government to
determine the source of the disclosure. Investigation
was conducted uncer the direction of Mr. Egil Krogh and
Mr. David Young, Staff Assistants to Mr. John Ehrlichman,
Counsel’ to the President for Domestic Affairs.

~.On the basis of investigations conducted by
State Security and Defense officials, four individuals-- i
‘one individual in the Department of Defense and three i

were tabbed as leading suspects. Mr. Egil Krogh contacted |
me on 26 July 1971 and requested that we arrange to polygraph!
the three suspects in the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency’
and volunteered the information that the Federal Bureau of

Investigation would be asked to polygraph the one suspect
in the Department of Defense.

ADMENISTRA Wei

Shinto ical Ud OT

4. JI informed Mr. Krogh ‘that from time to time
in matters involving the national security the Agency had -
detailed to Mr. G. Marvin Gentile, Director of State

-Security, a polygraph eperator and a polygraph machine for

his use in polygraphing State Department employees who
were recipients of allegations concerning their loyalty.

I emphasized that this procedure had the Director's
approval and that State clearly understood that the examin-
ation was their total responsibizity. I further informed
him that this: was the only way we could undertake to enter-
tain his réquest and that even then it would require the

ee ect ene approval of the Director. Mr. Krogh asked me to
obtain such approval and Kone out such arrangements with
Mr. Gentile.

5. ° Later that same day, Mr. Krogh called Mr. Gentile
and inquired as to whether the arrangements had been made.
Mr. Gentile indicated they had and suggested that the same
polygraph operator be used to examine the Defense suspect.

- Mr. Krogh informed Mr. Gentile that he considered this an

excellent idea and that he would instruct Defense officials
to make their man available to Mr. Gentile for a polygraph
examination.

6. The four individuals were Iden 182
of the Department of Defense and Iden 183
’ Iden 184 > and Iden 185 of
the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. The polygraph
examinations resulted in clearing the four men and the
results of the examinations were forwarded over my signature
to Mr. Gentile on 29 July 1971. A copy of my covering

‘memorandum is attached.

7. ° Iden 186 ° , a staff writer for The

“Washington Post, in an article dated 3 September 1571,

Stated that a State Department spokesman had acknowledged
at a news briefing that agents of the Federal Bureau of
Investigation had polygraphed State Department employees
suspected of leaking information on the SALT talks in
July. Mr. John Edgar Hoover, then Director of the Federal

. Bureau of Investigation, denied this allegation ‘ina
letter to The Washingten Post and said that the polygraph.
examinations nad pecn conaucted by another agency. -Specu-
lation centerec around the Agency, but after a ‘day or so,
press speculation in this regard died away.

8. Iden 186 apparently has never been satisfied
and has been pressing Mr. Charles Bray, State Department
spokesman, for confirmation of Agency involvement. Mr.

Bray learned today that Iden 186 plans to use a press
: conference to be held at 2:00 p.m. this afternoon to press
this point further. Mr. Bray has been given guidance by
Mr. Gentile to avoid confirmation but if this is impossible
he will indicate the examinations were conducted by State
Department Security officials utilizing an operator and
a machine detailed to the Department for this purpose. I :
do not know whether or not the fact that the government-wide
investigation was directed.by Mr. Egil Krogh is known to
Iden 186 but I suspect that it is and that this is the
reason why the matter has been raised again. Mr. David
Young was instrumental in pushing my office to conduct an
internal Agency investigation of this disclosure and the
White House was satisfied that no Agency was
the source.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director for Management and Services
SUBJECT *: Special Report

_1. This memorandum is in response to a request to
provide information on situations or associations that
might appear. to be irregular on the surface.

2. Details to the White House and Government Agencies -
’) ackground: For many years the Central intelligence A y has

detailed employees to the immediate office of the White House
- per se and to components associated intimately with the immediate
office of the President such as the Council on International
Economic Policy and the President's Foreign Intelligence
Advisory Board. We have furnished secretarics, clerical
employees and certain professional. employees on a reimbursable
and non-reimbursable basis. At the present time, we have no
clericals or professionals assigned to the immediate White
House office, but we do have one young man detailed to their
Communications Section. There are detailees to PFIAB and CIEP.
I might point out that we had detailed to the White House as
late as the fall of 1970 couriers, telephone operators, a |
laborer assigned to the grounds and a graphics man who designed
invitations for State dinners. By October of 1970, more funds
were apparently available to run the White House and most of
BQ our detailees were hired as bona fide White House employees.
CIA’is not the only Agency: furnishing the White House with
detailees. Levies have been made by this Administration and
others on Defense and State and other Government entities
whose employees have Top Secret. clearances.

Professional officers have been and are at the present
time assigned t the National Security Council and we have seven .
clericals on detail to NSC on a reimbursable basis.

In addition to the above, we have technical specialists

: detailed to NSA, an instructor at the National War College and
i security officers detailed to the Department of State to

sprotect foreign visgitors. Recently [ John agg hes detailed -
* to the Secretary ofMhe Treasury along with Mr other Agency

employees. We have even, in rare. instances, detailed our

people to Congressional Staffs for short periods of. time.

-3. Details to the White House and Government Agencies -
Discussion: Details to NSC, the White House, sad and the
National far College are probably quite cefensible., On the other
hand, there may be those who would question Agency employees
currently working at the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs
and Mr. Peter Peterson having an Agency employee as his
secretary when he was the Secretary of ‘Commerce (she also made
a trip with him to Moscow). She is still with him in his
present assignment but we expect that she will report to NSC for
@ new detail sometime this month. Iden 112 served for
over ten years as Director of the Office of. Public Safety for
AID. This information has been kept "close to the vest" during
that entire period of time. He has been approved: for disability
retirement and is presently on sick leave and will retire
automatically at the expiration of this leave.

Each detail of an Agency employee to the White House or
other Government agency has been carefully considered and
approval at a higher level obtained when professionals were
involved.

4, Project TNOFOLD:- I believe the support we are
providing to Project TrOFOLD is an activity that should be
reported under your guidelines. Since this is an extremely

sensitive Project and the Office of Security is reporting on
it, I will not repeat the details in my memorandum.

S$. Individuals Engaged in Domestic Activities:. In a more
_ general sense, Contract Personnel Jivision prepares and executes
contracts with individuals engaged by the Agency to carry out
domestic activities. We also process Staff Agents who are
domestically assigned. None of these assignments are decided
in OP. I really have no way of knowing with any degree of
certainty what the specific duties of these individuals will be.

6. Arrangements with American Firms: - In the interest of
reporting "too much,” I would renina you that Contract Personnel
Division writes "agreements" with domestically based American
firms to provide cover. for Agency assets. The actual assign-
ments are overseas. The arrangements, however, are backstopped,
in the main, in the United States. :

Logistics

The Maryland State Police have been briefed on the Agency's
association with this proprietary and have assisted us in
obtaining the appropriate State license. Similarly, a
Federal license has been obtained for ‘the proprietary
through an arrangement with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,
and Firearms of the Department of the Treasury. They, too,
have been briefed on the Agency's association with this
proprietary. |
é b.. Under Title 18, Chapter 2512 of.the U. S. Code
- (1968), the sale of electronic intelligence equipment is
prohibited except to Federal agencies, and state and local
law enforcement agencies. In essence, this law makes it
almost impossible to procure electronic intelligence
equipment in.a covert manner so that no tie or relationship
to the United States Government is made. In order for the
Agency to covertly obtain.such eauipment and hide any
Government interest, the Covert Procurement Staff cf the
Procurement Division. has relied on an established working
relationship with aU.S. firm. . This firm, a prominent
supplier located in. : Maryland, deals in a wide
range of law enforcement, police supplies, and equipment.
The Covert Procurement. Staff has. had a relationship withan officer
“C. in'the firm for over 15 years. The officer agreed to
allow us to place orders through his corporation to major.
suppliers of this equipment with a billing to 2m Agency national
proprietary.There is an understanding that. if any inquiry
is raised by the Department cf Justice, the firm's officer would
immediately call the Chief of the Covert Procurement Staff
who would, through appropriate liaison channels, contact
the Department of Justice, identify the.Agencv's interest
in the procurement action, and clear the officer of any
‘ responsibility.. On 10 September 1971, there was an inquiry
about the proprietary £ron_an FBI agent making a routine
investigation of, the officer's books. Through Office of

External Employment Assistance Branch's action on a request
from Howard Hunt for a lockpicker who might be retiring or ‘

Sometime in the spring of 1972, Iden 38 of EEAB

to show the date of this exchange, but Mr. Thomas-Hester (who
also works in EEAB) opines that it occurred sometime between
March and May 1972. :

All of the above information was reported to the Office
of Security on 4 October 1972 following the FBI's contact with
the Agency regarding Howard Hunt.

9. Resume Sent _to McCord: Ross Lambert, a contract
employee who retired in September 1971, was a client of the
External Enployment Assistance Branch in his search for a job
after retirement. One of the leads given to Lambert was’
James McCord's security business. EEAB sent a resume to
McCord, but Lambert was not hired.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD ; “

SUBJECT: Identity 61 Break Inon 15 May 1972

mt .

1, On.24 May 1973 I telephoned Mr. James Robinson,
General Crime Section, Department of Justice and asked if he
had any information as to criminal prosecution of persons involved

‘ ina breakin at Identity 61 ‘in Washington, D.C. on

15 May 1972, Mr. Robinson stated he had no knowledge of this but
suggested that it would be better to check with Mr. G, Marvin Gentile,
Deputy Assistant Secretary for Security, Department of State, and
the Secret Service since they had responsibilities for the Executive
Protective Service (EPS), I telephoned Mr. Gentile and he identi-
fied two State Department cables relative to the incident; one from
the embassy in Santiago to the Department, No. 2450, dated-

15 May 1972, Subject: Unauthorized Entry Outlining the Protest

of the Iden 76 Government presented to the American Embassy,

and the State Department reply to Santiago, No. 084655, dated

15 May 1972. Mr. Gentile also identified the EPS. report of"
investigation and suggested that I get a copy frorn the Secret Service.
I then called Mr. Tom Kelly at Secret Service and he had his liaison
man deliver me a copy of the EPS report of Tenor

2. On 25 May 1973 I received a call from FBI Agent

Ray Mullens on green phone No. 5303 stating that he had received

a telephone call from Mr. James Robinson relative to my inquiry
about prosecution, Mr. Mullens indicated that the FBI Washington
Field Office had recontacted the Metropolitan Police Departmert (MPD)
on 24 May and reviewed the report No. 248-424 filed with the 3rd
District, MPD which states that a break in occurred at Identity 61

between 5:00 and 8:00 a.m. on 15 May 1972. ©

Reparted loss at trafPine consisted of four am He hcios
and one electric razor, The police investigation identified
some latent fingerprints but no identification of those prints
was made. Since the reported loss was under $5, 000 and there -
was.no evidence of a crossing of state boundries, the FBI did

not make an investigation of the incident. The MPD reported

that there had been no prosecution and no suspect was identified.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Mr. William E. Colby

SUBJECT: Special Activities

1, Following our recent conversation,’ I have
“searched my memory and Mr. NeCone's files for examples ~
of activities which to hostile observers or to somcone
without complete knowledge and with a special kind of
motivation could be interpreted as examples of activities
exceeding CIA's charter. ) TKK) ‘B)

2. First, as we discussed, on 7 March 1962,
DCI McCone, under pressure from Attorney General Robert
F. Kennedy, agreed to tap the telephones of columnists
Robert S. Allen and Paul] Scott in an effort to identify
their sources for classified information which was appear -
ing in their columns. Because the primary source appeared
to be in the Department of Defense, McCone ordered ne
personally to brief General Joe Carroll, Director of DIA,
orally, which I did. I understand more complete information
on this operation is available from the Director of Security.
I, personally, managed to avoid gaining any knowledge of
what precise actions were taken, what information was gained,
what was done with it, and when the operation was terminated.

3. As a result. of a developing relationship with
IDEN-122 thelDEN-123representative in Washington,
and also as a result of certain information conveyed by
IDEN-124 » James Angleton, with the approval of
Dick Helms, agreed to mount a counterespionage operation
against the IDEN-95 in Washington. This involved
breaking and entering and the removal of documents from

A

the: IDEN-126 | On 18 June 1962, DCI McCone and
Helms briefed Secretary of State Rusk generally.on the
operation without going into operational details. Later
on the same day, President John F. Kennedy was briefed.
Actual breaking and entering occurred, somewhat later, and
on 15 April 1963, DCI McCone met with President Kennedy
alone and briefed the President on the details of this
new phase of the operation. On the same day, the Attorney
General was briefed and he agreed that he would not
mention it to the FBI unless the FBI themselves raised
it-with him. On 3 February 1964, DCI McCune met alone
with President Lyndon B. Johnson and briefed him on the
operation. On 4 February McGeorge Bundy was briefed.

On 6 February 1964 in a briefing of Secrefary of State
Rusk on the results of the operation, Rusk expressed
reservations about-.the propricty of such an operation.

He raised this same concern in subsequent conversations
with McCone on 17 April 1964, 28 May 1964, and 14 June
1964. On 12 September 1964 Rusk continued to express
grave reservations and repeatedly suggested that the
IDEN-95 be iniormed direcrly that we knew about their
espionage operations in the United States and ask them
to desist. In a meeting on 28 May 1964 Rusk expressed
these reservations in the presence of DCI MeCone and
President John F.. Kennedy. Secretary of Defense. McNamara
was also present, and there is no record that he had
previously been made aware of this operation.

4. Although certain activities never got beyond

the planning stage, there are, I believe, three examples

of. such planning which could be subject to misinterpretation.
One involved chemical warfare operations against the rice

“crops in both Cuba and North Vietnam. A second involved
a paramilitary strike against the Chi-Com nuclear instal-

_ lations. Outside. the United States Government, General
‘Bisenhower was briefed on such planning. A third, which
assumes a new significance today, involved a proposal by
Angleton and Helms for a greatly increased intelligence
collection effort against foreign installations in this
country. This planning also involved a scheme for selected

Wu, exposure of KGB activities and counteractions against the
“4 ¢) Soviet intelligence service. The reasons are still-unclear
. Ww to me as to why the FBI chose to brief the PFIAB to the

&Y effect that(CIA was planning to wiretap extensively and

cindiscriminately in this country, to greatly increase

the Agency representation in the Moscow Embass
generally to use KGB-type tactics, also extensi ‘ely and

Hl indiscriminately. This led to a heated exchange between
DCI McCone and Mr. Belmont of the FBI, one such meeting
taking place in the presence of the Attorney General.

It is clear that the TBI was opposed to any such proposal
then, as now, and the plan never went forward. i

5. During the period when Des FitzGerald was in
charge of the Cuban Task Force, DCI McCone's office
learned, quite by accident, that: FitzGerald had secured
the cooperation of. several prominent US business firms
in denying economic items to Cuba. There was no question
but that the businessmen were glad to cooperate, but know-
ledge of this operation had to be rather widespread.

6. On 17 April 1964, Mr. Robert B. Anderson came
to DCI MeCone on behalf of American business interests,
offering to insert some $300,000 to try to secure a
favorable result in the elections in Panama. Shortly
after this approach, IWEN-128 of IDEN-129

made a Similar proposal to MeCone in: connection
with elections in Chile. On 12 May 1964 at a meeting of
the 303 Comaittee, it was decided that the offers of
American business could not be accepted. it being neither
a secure way nox an honorable way of doing such business.
This declaration of policy at this time bears on the recent
| ITT hearings, but I am not surprised that McCone has

ie ‘forgotten thathe helped to set the precedent of refusing

to accept such collaboration between the > Agency! Ss operations
_and private business.

SUMMARY: 4 ae ee ie eeaeen : :

There is little new evidence of foreign plans or efforts
to inspire, support, or take advantage of actions designed to
disrupt or harass the Republican National Convention in San
Dicgo, 21 to 23. August 1972. The Students for a Democratic
Society, in joining the ranks of domestic groups planning

‘actions at the Republican Convention, has adopted a proposal

to cooperate with Mexican workers and students in a demonstra-
tion in Tijuana, Mexico, during the Convention. The San Diego
Convention Coalition (SDCC), another domestic group targetting
on the Convention, has received a letter of solidarity froin

the North Vietnamese. .The letter is of interest as an indica-
tion of North Vietnamese contact’ with the SDCC; such contact
will be required for the SDCC to implement its earlicr-reported
plans for broadcasts over public address systems during the

Convention of live telephone calls from the Vietnamese in

Paris. - 5
DEVELOPMENTS:

... At its recent convention in Cambridgc, Massachusetts,
held 30 March to 2 April 1972, the Students for a Democratic
Society (SDS) adopted a proposal to hold demonstrations at
the San Dicgo-Tijuana border during the Republican National
Convention. The proposal included a call for SDS to cooperate
with Mexican workers and students in an action to occur during
a fiesta in Tijuana, where Convention delegates will be
entertained. . ‘

The North Vietnamese have given their endorsement to
the San Diego Convention Coalition (SDCC) in the form of a
letter from the Vietnam Committee for Solidarity with the

North Vietnamese Government. The letter, which has been
circulated by the SDCC and is dated 27 January 1972,

and conveys the Committee's "best wishes of militant soli-
garity and friendship." The VCSWAP requests that the SDCC

Foreign Support for Activities Planned to Disrupt

SUMMARY:

New indications of foreign plans or efforts to inspire,
support, influence, or exploit activities designed to dis-
rupt or harass the Republican National Convention in Miami,
Florida, 21-24 August 1972, consist of the following: A
leader of the People's Coalition for Peace and Justice
(PCPJ) has stated that demonstrations will be organized to

take place at United States and allied military installa-

tions abroad during the period immediately before and during
the Republican Convention. The PCPJ leader also stated that
representatives of the Stockholm Conference on Vietnam will

“xparticipate in activities in connection with the Convention.
The Anti-War Union (ANU), a domestic organization which has
been active in planning demonstrations in connection with the
Republican National Convention, has sent a delegation to

’ Paris, France, to meet with officials of the Democratic Repub-
lic of Vietnam (DRV) and the Provisional Revolutionary Govern-
ment of South Vietnam (PRG). No information is presently
available, however, indicating that actions at the Republican
Convention have been discussed at these meetings.

. DEVELOPMENTS: é :

In an carly July 1972 meeting with prominent members of
. foreign antiwar.organizations, a representative of the People! s
Coalition for Peace and Justice (PCPS), who occupics an impor-
tant position within that organization, discussed the plans
of the PCPJ.in connection with the upcoming clection campaign
in the United States. The PCPJ representative stated that
during the. period 14-23 August, a "Peoples Campaign Against
Bombing" would be waged in U.S. cities. involved in the manu-
facture and shipping of materials for use in Vietnam, and
that similar actions will be organized at United States and
allied military installations abroad. The PCPJ representa-
tiye further stated that “dramatic demonstrations" in protest

"



“of the bombing A ee are being organi by the "Repub-

te.

lican Party National Convention Coalition" to.occur on

21 August 1972. In an apparent reference to the 21 August
actions, the PCPJ leader added that representatives of the
Stockholm Conference on Vietnam will speak on the subject of
the alleged American bombing of dikes in North Vietnam.
(Comacnt: We have no.present information concerning plans of
Stockholm Conference representatives to travel-to the United
States during the Republican National Convention; nor do we
have any additional information concerning plans of Stockholn
Conference representatives to participate in activities con-
nected with the Republican Convention.)

The Anti-War Union (ANU), a domestic group engaged in
organizing counter-activities at the Republican National Con-
vention, has sponsored the travel of a delegation of activists
to Paris, France, to meet with officials of the Democratic
Republic of North Vietnam (DRV) and the Provisional Revolu-

tionary Government of South Vietnam (PRG). An advance party

has already met with DRV and PRG representatives to discuss
the agenda for meetings with the full. ANU delegation. Although
no information is presently available indicating that actions
at the Republican Convention have been discussed or are sched-
uled to be discussed at meetings between the ANU delegation
and the DRV/PRG officials, it is known that members of the AM
advance party have asked for advice from the PRG officials
regarding the stance the ANU should take on certain questions
relating to the presidential elections. It is also known

that the DRV officials have questioned the AWU advance party
about the political mood in the United States. One of the
AWU delegation. members has stated that upon their return to
the United States about 26 ‘July 1972, some of the members

“will speak at rallics, over the radio, and on television,

to "educate the American people about the consequences of

‘voting for Nixon, and the need to end the war and defeat

Nixon." The delegation member added that the demonstrations

-at-the Republican Convention will be "unique."

i ‘

There are no new indications of specific foreign plans or efforts to
inspire, support, influence, or exploit activities designed to disrupt or
harass the Republican National Convention in Miami, Florida, 21- -24 August’
1972. Although mectings have been held recently in Paris, France, between
American antiwar activists and representatives of the Democratic Republic
of North Vietriam (DRV) and the Provisional Revolutionary Government of
South Victnam (PRG), currently available information indicates that the

American participants with respect to the upcoming Republican National
Convention. Private discussions, separate from the meetings with the entire

exchanges. A second group of activists, considered more important than
the first delegation, is scheduled to travel to Paris on or about 1 August 1972
for further consultations with the PRG and DRV representatives.

In recent mectings in Paris, France, with members of an American
deltgation sponsored by the Anti-War Union (AWU), representatives of

the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV) and the Provisional Revolutionary
Government of South Vietnam (PRG) were very guarded with respect to dis-
cussing activities at the Republican National Convention. Although the Vietnam-
ese repeatedly questioned the Americans concerning the mood of the antiwar
movement in the United States, they made no direct reference to the Repub-
lican Convention, except for one instance when PRG Deputy Chief Nguyen
Nan TIEN accused President Nixon of using the private and public sessions
of the Paris peace talks as “propaganda for the Republican Convention.”
TIEN then urged the Americans to promote and propagandize the Seven
Point Plan offered by the PRG. The Americans, too, for the most part,
refrained from discussing the Convention, other than to estimate that demon~
strators will number about 10,000 at the Convention.

Following their meeting on 22 July 1972 with the AWU delegation,
the PRG officials held additional talks with sub-groups of the delegation.
Additionally, at least one of the American participants was invited by
the DRV officials to return for further discussions. At present, there
is no information available concerning the substance of these private

A second, more important delegation ‘of Americans connected with

Foreign Support for Activities Planned to. Disrupt
Or Harass the Democratic National Convention

~ SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION:

There are no direct indications thus, far of foreign
efforts to inspire, support or take advantage of activities
designed to disrupt or harass the National Convention of
the Democratic Party in Miami, 10-13 July 1972. The concept
of coordinated international support for domestic activities
in the United States was generally endorsed at the recent ~
World Assembly for Peace and Independence of the Peoples
. o£.Indochina; however, the Conference issued.no specific
ee -* ¢€al] for international support of disruptive actions at the

" ‘+ American national political conventions. .,

BACKGROUND:

At. the Soviet-controlled World Assembly for Peace
‘and Independence of the Peoples! of Indochina, held in
Versailles from 10-15 February 1972, there was mention of
American plans for demonstrations at both the Republican
and Democratic National Conventions. The final draft _
| : «* | resolution from the conference's "Action Commission" con- 2
: tains an appendix submitted by American delegates whose
goal was to secure global coordination for domestic actions
. ' in the United States. It calls for international support
to six weeks of domestic antiwar actions and demonstrations,
.» £rom 1 April to 15 May 1972, and concludes with the state-
- ment: “This campaign will lead up to the Democratic Party
: Convention at Miami on July 9, 1972, and the Republican 2
Party Convention in.San Diego on August 21, 1972."

The final "Resolution of the Paris World Assembly
for the Peace and Independence of the Indochinese People"
: of 13 February 1972, drafted by the "Political Commission"
ae states:

a . "In the United States particularly, the protest
mae against the war is voiced more and more strongly,

00Sc3



under. various forms, such as draft evasions,
desertions, resistance, -demonstrations which
now affect even the soldiers. The Assembly
calls for support to. these progressive and

Foreign Support for Activities Planned to Disrupt

SUMMARY:

New indications of foreign efforts or plans to inspire,
support, influence, or exploit actions designed to disrupt
or harass the Democratic National Convention in Miami, 10-135
July 1972, are limited -to a reiteration by a member of the
Secretariat of the Stockholm Conference on Victnam of a
statement previously issucd by the World Assembly for Peace
and Independence of the Peoples of Indochina. The Assemdly's

“pronouncement generally endorsed the concept of international
support to a campaign of anti-Victnam War activities in the
United States leading up to the Democratic and Republican
Conventions, but made no specific call for support of dis-
ruptive actions at the conventions themselves.

. 7 ce

DEVELOPMENTS: :
In early April 1972 an influential and well-informed
staff momber of the Stockholm Conference on Vietnam discussed,
in private, the international anti-Vietnam War activities ~
conducted on 1, 15, and 22 April. The Stockholm Conference
member stated that these actions were part of an international
‘campaign in support of domestic American antiwar efforts
during the period 1 April to 15 May 1972, and "will culminate
at the election conventions in July and August." .

..The World Assembly for Peace and Independence of the
Peoples of Indochina, of which the Stockholm Conference was
a-major organizer, had earlier enunciated a similar statement
in an appendix to the final draft resolution of the Assenbly's

“"Action Commission." The appendix, called for. international
support to six weeks of domestic antiwar actions and demon-

_ Strations, from 1 April. to 15 May 1972, and concluded with
“the statement: "This campaign will lead up to the Democratic

Party Convention at Miami on July 9, 1972, and the Republican

Party Convention in San Diego on August 21, 1972."

SUMMARY:

Indications remain Limited of forcign plans or attempts

. to inspire, support, influence, or exploit actions designed

to disrupt or harass the Democratic National Convention in

Miami, Florida, 10-13 July 1972. A member of the Swedish

Committee for Vietnam, who is also a member of the Secre-

tariat of the Stockholm Conference on Vietnam, has stated

that the U.S. National Elections. are playing a role in

the Swedish Committee's work. The British-based Interna-

tional Confederation for Disarmament and Peace (ICDP) has

distributed a “Spring Offensive Calendar" of activities

in the United States against the war based on a submission

by the Peoples' Coalition for Peace and Justice (PCPJ).

The calendar includes actions planned in connection with

the Democratic Convention. :

TS:

In mid-April 1972, a member of the Swedish Committee
for Victnan, who is also an influential and well-informed
staff member of the Secretariat of the Stockholm Conference
on Vietnam, stated ina private discussion of the Swedish
Committee's unusually heavy work load that "things will be
hectic right until the elections in the U.S."

: The International Confederation for Disarmament and
Peace, a British-based antiwar organization and one of the
more prominent member organizations of the Stockholm Con-
ference, has attached a “Spring Offensive Calendar" to the
April-May 1972 issue of its regular. international publica-
tion Vietnan Interna tional. The calendar had been furnished
by the People's Coalition for Peace and Justice (PCPJ) and
included the following entry:

. Foreign Support for Activities Planned to Disrupt
-or Harass the Democratic National Convention

SUMMARY: i a

The only new indication of foreign plans or efforts
- to inspire, support, influence, or exploit actions designed
to disrupt or harass the Democratic National Convention in

"Miami, Florida, 10-13 July 1972, is an expression of interest

by a member of the North Vietnamese Delegation to the Paris
Peace Talks in the plans of the major antiwar orgamizations
sin the United States for demonstrations in’ connection with
the political conventions of both major parties.

DEVELOPNENTS: Baoan

In mid-May 1972, a member of the North Vietnamese Dele-
. gation to the Paris Peace Talks invited a visitor to contact
him again when the visitor returned from an imminent trip
to the United States. The North Vietnamese official gave
the visitor the New York City addresses of the People's .
Coalition for Peace and Justice (PCPJ) and the National
Peace Action Coalition (NPAC), and asked the visitor to
inquire at their offices regarding their plans for demon-
strations during the coming summer. The North Vietnamese
oe official stated that he was especially interested in plans

for actions in connection with the Democratic and National
Conventions.

into the US labor situation, and particularly to try

to ameliorate the quarrel between George Meany-and
Walter Reuther. [iN-36 steered a very skillful
course in this connection, but the Agency could be.
vulnerable to charges that we went behind Meany's back,
or were somehow consorting with or against Meany's
wishes.

8. There are three examples of using Agency
funds which I know to be controversial. One was the
expenditure of money under Project MOSES in securing
the release of Cuban Brigade prisoners. Details of
this operation are best known to ey Houston; Mike
Miskovsky IDEN-131 » and Jarés Smith. Second,
as you well know, when Lou Conecin received his summons
to report to the Joint General Staff Neadquarters on

1 November 1963 a large amount of cash went with him.
My impression is that the accounting for this and its
use has never been very frank or complete. Third, at
one of the carly Special Group meetings attended by
McCone he took strong cxeeption to proposals to spond
Agency funds to improve the economic viability of West
Berlin, and for an investment program in Mali. His
general position was that such expenditures were not
within the Agency's charter, and that he would allow
such spending-only on the direct personal request of
the Secretary of State or the Secretary of Defense, or
the White House.

9. I raise these issues of funding because I

“remember the Agency's being severely criticized by the

House Appropriations Subcommittee for having spent $3,000
for stamps in connection with a program to buy tractors
to secure the release of prisoners trom Cuba.

10. Under the heading ‘of old business, I know that
any one who has worked in the Director's office has worried
about the fact that conversations within the offices and
over the telephones were transcribed. During McCone's

00459



tenure, there were microphones in his regular office,

his inner office, his dining room, his office in East
Building, and his study at his residence on White Haven
Street. I do not know who would be willing to raise such
an issue, but. knowledge.of such operations tends to
spread, and certainly the Agency is eae on this
score.

11. Also ander the heading of old business, I
well remember the hue and cry raised, espegially by Carl
Kaysen in the White House, when

hortly after the Cuban missile crisis, there was
a-disposition in Washington to reexamine the Bay of Pigs, ce
and the fact that several Alabama National Air Guard
officers lost their lives in the Bay of Pigs was surfaced
With surprisingly little excitement at the tinie.

12. During my stint on the. 7th floor there was
a special arrangement with the Office of Communications
whereby_the Director's office gained access tofion « -CIA
-traific This surfaced briefly at one point shortly after
“Adwiral Nayborn became DCI. He had visited the Signal
Center and removed a copy of a telegram from the Embassy
in the Dominican Republic for Under Secretary George Ball,
Fyes Only. . He returned to his office and proceeded to
discuss this telegram with George Ball who was naturally
quite curious as to how Rayborn knew about it, and also as
to how Rayborn had it in his possession before Ball did.
Ben Read in the Secretary of Stace's office and I spent
weeks putting this oné to rest.

13. Finally, DCI McCone, as you and I well know,
operated on a very lofty plane, and I think certain of
his activitics could be misunderstood! One example was |
his decision in July of 1964 to have Aristotle Onassis and
Maria Callas flown from Rome to. Athens. on Air Force KC 135.
Their arrival in Athens in this airplane attracted the
attention of the local press and in due course Mr. John -



poate Wd dd by

_ ® as

a 6

Hightower, Chief of the Associated Press Bureau for
Washington, came to see me to ask about the propriety
of this action.

14. ° The use of IDEN-132 aircraft

“has been remarkably secure, but DCI NeCone himself
forgot about the cover arrangement and became quite
exercised when he saw Candidate Goldwater land in ‘the
San Francisco airport for the Republican-National Con-
vention in 1964 aboard the IDEN-133 with
the highly visible tail nunber jpeN+134, This was, I
explained to him carefully, a perfectly legitimate
charter, but he didn't like it.

15. McCone dealt quite extensively. with newsmen
in Washington. In fact, they gave him a gift anda
luncheon when he left Washington, which is perhaps
indicative of the press's relations with him. However,
in the case of the Ross and Wise book, The Invisible
Government, he did try to bring pressure on the publisher
and the authors to change things. They did not change
a comma, and I doubt that this old saw willwer sing
again. .

16. Finally, and this will reflect my Middle
Western Protestant upbringing, McCone's dealings with
the Vatican, including Pope John X XIII and Pope Paul
I, would and could. raise eyebrows in certain quarters.

17. The above listing is uneven, but I have a
sinking feeling that discipline has broken down, and that
allegations from any quarter which cast these things in

‘the wrong light would receive great publicity and attention,
and no amount of denial would ever set the record straight.
If I may be of any assistance in tracking down further

‘details, I am‘of course at your disposal, but I would point

out that I was very much in the position of the

enlisted man who knew that the commissioned officers
were aware of these activities and better able to
judge their propriety and possible impact or misinter-

pretation.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION:

___Indications.remain limited, thus far, of foreign efforts
“Inspire, support or take advantage of activities designed
to disrupt or harass the National Convention of the Republican

BACKGROUND :

At the Soviet-controlled World Assembly for Peace and
Independence of the Peoples of Indochina, held in Versailles
from 10-15 February 1972, there was mention of American plans
for demonstrations at both the Republican and Democratic
National Conventions. The final draft resolution fram the
Conference's "Action Commission" contains an appendix submitted
by American delegates whose goal was to secure global coordination

{ for domestic actions in the United States. It calls for inter-
ue national support to six wecks of domestic antiwar actions and
. demonstrations, from 1 April to 15 May 1972, and concludes with
the statement: “This campaign will: lead up to the Democratic
——Rarty.Convention at Miami on July 9, 1972, and the Republican

SUBJECT: Items for Possible Use in Briefing
the DCI

©
1. This Memorandum is’ submitted in order to
identify to you for possible bricfing of the
Director activities which in, certain contexts could
be construed as delicate ‘or inappropriate.

2. <At the request of the Director of Security,

. £rom/approximately mid-October 1972 to mid-January
1973*Safcsite was made available to the

U.S. Marshal's Service for use as a secure residence
by an. Assistant U.S. Attorney who reportedly was

under threat of assassination by organized criminal
elements.

3. SB Division over the past three months has
interviewed four graduate students as prospective
candidates for assignments under American business
cover in the USSR. They were encouraged to locate
cover jobs on their own.

4. For approximately two years the SB Division
has ‘had the cooperation of the Commander of the
Morals Division of the District of Columbia Police
Department in training officers scheduled for
assigmaent to the USSR and Eastern Europe in how to
conduct themselves if placed under arrest. The
arrangement was made through the Office of Security.

$. Since late 1972[cra}has taken part in seven
FBI training courses at Quantico, Virginia in
response to requests from the FBI. We have shared
with them through lectures and discussions lessons
we have learned which are relevant to their counter-

espionage responsibilities.

have been recuited and run exclusively for the MHCHAOS
program. Instead, emphasis has been placed on the exploi-
tation of new and old Agency assets who have a by-product
capability or a concurrent capability for provision of
information responsive to the program's requirements.

This has involved the provision of custom-tailored collec-
tion requirements and operational guidance. This collec-
tion progran is viewed as an integral part of the recruit-
ment and collection programs of China Operations, Vietnam
Operations, Cuban Operations, Soviet Bloc Division opera-
‘tions and Korean Branch operations. Agents who have an
American "Movement" background.or who have known connec-
tions with the American "Movement" are useful as access
agents to obtain biographic and personality data, to dis-
cern possible vulnerabilities and susceptibilities, and

to develop operationally exploitable relationships with
recruitment targets of the above programs. These assets
are of interest to our targets because of their connec-
tions with and/or knowledge of the American "Movement."
Over the course of the MHCHAOS program, there have been
approxinatcly 20 important areas of operational interest,
which at the present time have been reduced to about ten:
Paris, Stockholm, Brussels, Dar Es Salaam, Conakry, Algiers,
Mexico City, Santiago, Ottawa and long Kong.

4. The MIUCHAOS program also utilizes audio opera-
tions, two of which have been implemented to cover tar-
gets of special interest. :

Paragraph a. deleted because it reveals a sensitive
foreign operation,

Paragraph b, deleted because it reveals a sensitive

fil] OaSos



-5. MHCHAOS reporting from abroad relating to the
program originates in two ways: Individuals who are noted
in contact with Cubans, the Chinese Communists, etc., and
who appear to have extremist connections, interests or
background are reported upon. Other individuals are re-
ported upon in response to.specific Headquarters require-
ments received from the FBI because such individuals. are
of active investigatory security interest to the FBI.

6. All cable and dispatch traffic related to the
MHCHAOS program is sent via restricted channels. It is
not processed by either the Cable Secretariat or.the In-
formation Services Division. The control and retriev-
ability of information obtained, including, information
received from the -FBI, is the responsibility of the Spe-
cial Operations Group.

7. Information responsive to specific FBI require-
ments is disseminated to the FBI via special controlled
dissemination channels, i.e., by restricted handling cable
traffic or via special pouch and specially numbered blind
memoranda.

8. Information of particular significance, when col-
lected, has been disseminated by special memorandum over
the signature of the Director of Central Intelligence to’
the White tiouse (Dr. Kissinger and John Dean), as well as
to the Attorney Ceneral, the Secretary of State and the
Director of the FBI.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director for Operations :
SUBJECT: Foreign Resources Division Operational
Activities with Possible Flap Potential

1, At thr risk of stating the obvious, almost all of the operational
activities carried on by FR Division in the United States run the risk ~
that unauthorized disclosure could create embarrassment to the Agency.
We have accepted this as a condition precedent and have proceeded with
our operational activities in the most professional manner possible under
the circumistances. There are certain rather unusual activities in which
FR Division has partic:pated and/or is participating that contain some-
what greater possibility for cmbarrassment if discovered. I have listed
these below, not necessarily in order of embarrassment Potential:

JFK OYLB)
a. provides a fairly considerable
amount of support to Dr. Kissinger in his contacts with the

Chinese. This support was authorized by Mr, Karamessines

and Mr. Helms. Thus far there has been no problem other

than the inordinate amount of time spent my JEONG)
personnel, not to mention the fairly sizeable amount of |

money that has been expended in support of these efforts.

b. ACIAOfficer _—is to be assigned to FR Division. The
CIA Officer is presently assigned overseas under a

JIn discussions between
“'NOCAD and the ADDO, it was decided that the Officer would
be pulled out and reassigried in the United States.

We have concluded that the best solution is to have this
officer attend a university in the Midwest for at least

a year, working towards an advanced degree until there
has been time for the situation to clarify itself. We plan

to make no operational use of tie CIA Of whatsoever,
during the period of time that he is attending the’ university,
Upon completion of his year's study, we will review the .
situation and decide the next course of action at that time.

“Connection with the current reporting requirement, However,

I have had our records researched for the past 2 years and
Attachnent 1 reflects those transactions which appear to be

relevant to the subject of this memorandum.

d. In connection with the disclosures during the sum-
mer of 1971 that the Rand Corporation was not, properly
safeguarding classified documents, this Office undertook
two acts. I directed the Seqnritwidéficer from our: West
Coast Procurement Office at the Iden 87 ..

to visit the Rand Corporation and satisfy
himself that classified material furnished them by the
gency,was both properly safeguarded and accounted for.
His report was affirmative. On 23 August 1971, the senior
Security. Officer assigned to this Office forwarded a
letter to the Rand Corporation stressing and reaffirming
the procedures Rand must follow in safeguarding classified
information furnished them byfthe Agency} Of residual

. interest in this matter, there is summarized the contents

of a memorandum of 2 July 1971 to theCExecutive | Director-
Comptroller from the DD/I which is in our possession,)

This memorandum reports that EEBIS regularly

but that instructions had been issued to cease

distribution of classified reports. While no
other direct dissemination went to Rand, other
USIB agencies, primarily USAF, were passing
"many" copies of{DB/I products to Rand] as au-
thorized under USIB regulations. The memoran-
dum also states that Rand personnel had ~
requested searches and document retrieval from
the CRS facility. :

S. In connection with action taken for the Office of

Security, there are three relevant items:

4, Within the area of contractual responsibilities, the
following items are pertinent:

a. In February 1971,[Colonel L. XK. White,] the then

meeting in his office, also attended by Mr. William Colby.
-Colonel White explained that the Technical Services
Division (TSD) had been requested to provide assistance

oe Executive Dire¢tor-Comptroller, called me to-attend a

to the FBI for a sensitive ject ee
: a : (Me) -[ getonen white) dia not dis-
‘) close the purpose of the asSistance being provided by TSD

but did instruct me to assist TSD on purely contractual
matters. Since the Office of Logistics has no information
concerning the mission or purpose of Project . sub-
stantive questions concerning the subject should be
addressed te TSD. Other procurement actions accomplished
for the .FBI-are..revorted below, Specific mention is made,
howéver, of the Project because of the dollar magnitude, ap-
proximately $1 million, and the complex technical. equip-
. Ment that has been involved in the undertaking.

b. The Procurement Division, OL, currently has two
requisitions in hand from TSD which would involve reim-
bursable sales to the FBI. One such requisition in the

! amount of $36,900 is for two Westinghouse. television
cameras. The second requisition in the amount of $11,200
is for two wide-angle surveillance probes manufactured by
Bausch and Lomb. No action is being taken on either of
these requirements pending further instructions which -
will be sought from the Deputy Director for Management
and Services. :

0) : c. Over the years, this{Agency] has often supported

te other Government agencies from a contractual or materiel

e standpoint. Upon the submission of an officially approved
“request, supported by a transfer of funds,Cthe Agency. ee)
would either enter into "accommodation procurements" for
the requesting agency or support the requesting agency by
the issuance of materiel from stock. Such actions are
legally accomplished under the Economy Act of 1925. - This
Act authorizes one agency to support the needs of, or pro-

Executive Fellowship.-- The book is entitled "Where's

What -- Sources of Information for Federal Investigators.”
It is a full treatise on the existence of sources of in-

formation that may be useful to an investigator. The
book's first printing of 500 copies was made in June 1967.

Ae Due to demand, a second printing of 600 copies was made
Ke in September 1968 The

le page of the book gives
attribution tof,“ Office of Security f Central
Intelligence Agency,] andthe Brookings Institution Federal
Executive Fellowship. The book is classified Ccnfidential,
and it is our understanding that the distribution was made
to appropriate,agencies of the Federal Government. A copy
of| Nr. Murphy's} book can be made available for review if
desired. - i ce

Sometime in 1972, a representative of the Law
Enforcement Assistance Administration (LEAA). requested
that the Agency give consideration to ovr publishing, at
\ LEAA expense, an unclassified version of this volume. It
ve was the ‘intent of LEAA to make broad-scale distribution
We to Police Departments throughout the country. The Director
4 ‘ of Security and I consulted on this matter and jointly
"determined that the LEAA request should not -be -honored be-
cause{the AgencyJshould not put itself in the position of
publishing law enforcement material for general and un-
classified purposes, and it would be an abuse of our print-
ing facilities.

b. On 5 January 1971, the Director of Security re-
quested that I approve his leasing up to eleven:motor
vehicles for use in connection with a special support
operation which would last approximately 3 months. The
Director of Security informed me, in his requesting memo-
randum of $ January 1971, that "This support activity has

_ been undertaken at the specific instruction of the Director
‘and has his personal approval." The request was approved.

¢ c. From 1968 to date, the Office of Security has
" requisitioned from this Office a considerable amount of
materiel which we understand was to be given or loaned by
® them to local Police Departments, In certain_cases some
wv of this materiel was issued from[Agency stocksJand, in
other cases, direct procurement of ‘the materiel was made

-by funds furnished by the Office of Security. A complete
listing of such materiel is found in Attachment 2. :

6. In connection withthe responsibility held by this

Office to obtain, manage, and dispose of safe sites for all
Agency operating components , the following information is

relevant.
aA ee site, identified as "Safehouse $62" which
is Iden 88 :
was made available to General Cushman! s
office on 23 July 1971. -

The subject safe site was acquired on 15 June 1970
as a replacement for a terminated OL standby safe site
and in keeping with the approved requirement for a com-
plement of five standby safehouses for all: Agency use. .
The apartment has one bedroom and is located in an older
high-rise building along Iden 89. The nominal
lessee is Iden 90 a security-cleared
attorney with offices located at Iden9l :
: +The cover story utilized is that
Iden 90,. * rents the apartment for business conferences,
_meetings, and occasional overnight ‘stays by his. staff
and/or his out-of-town clients. The original lease term
was for a l-year period, 15 June 1970 to 14 June 1971,
with month-to-month renewals thereafter. As an OL standby
safe site, the apartment has been used by various Agency
Components to meet’ their short-term or crash requirements.
Control of the standby. safe site and its security is the
responsibility of this Office. A record is maintained of
each user, component, and date of use; however, no record
is made of those persons being met at the site nor for what
purpose the site is being used (meetings, training, etc.).
Such information is maintained by the operating component
requesting the safe site. Records maintained by this
Office disclose only that the apartment involved was made
; available to General Cushman's office on 23 July 1971 in
) _ answer to a telephonic request.

: C’ b. This Office is aware, although it had no cognizance
Ww . nor responsibility, that an apartment was rented in Miami
Beach, Florida, during the period of the Democratic National
A Convention, 10-14 July 1972, and the Republican National
Convention, 21-24 August 1972. The apartment was used as

1. OCI began following Caribbean black radicalism
in earnest in 1968. The emphasis of our analysis was on
black nationalism as a political force in the Caribbean
and as a threat to the security of the Caribbean states.
fwo-DDI memoranda were produced on the subject: "Black
Radicalism in the Caribbean" (6 August 1969), and "Black

: Radicalism in the Caribbean--Another Look" (12. June 1970).
“In each a single paragraph was devotcd to tics with the

US black power movement; the discussion primarily concerned

\ visits of Stokely Carmichael and other US black. power
activists to the Caribbean and other. overt contacts.

2, In June 1970, Archer Bush of OCI was asked to
write a memorandum with special attention to links be-
tween black ‘radicalism in the Caribbean and advocates of

black power in the US. The record is not clear where

this request originated, but it came through channels

‘from the DCI. The paper was to be treated as especially
‘ sensitive.and was to include material provided by ‘the

Special Operations group of the CI Staff. The CI Staff °
material was voluminous but did not provide meaningful
evidence of important links between militant blacks in

the US and the Caribbean. This, in fact, was one of

the conclusions of the paper. The memorandum was produced

1. In late spring of 1968 Walt Rostow, then ie
Special Assistant to the President for National Security
Affairs, tasked the DCI with undertaking a survey of
worldwide student dissidence. Confronted. by timult at
campuses like Columbia and mindful of the violence
accompanying student outbursts at Berlin's Free University
and clsewhere, Rostow sought to learn whether youthful
dissidence was interconnected: spawned by the same causes;
financed and hence manipulated by forces or influences
hostil‘ to the interests of the US and its allies; or likely
to come under inimical sway to the detriment of US interests.

2. The paper was prepared by/Paul Corscaddef] of ocit
with the assistance of the CA and CI Staffs. The DDI,

D/OCI, and{Corscaddenjmet with Rostow to elicit.the reasons
for his or the President's concerns and to agree on the
sources to be examined, the research methods to be followed,
etc.

3. Written during the summer of 1968, the most
Sensitive version of Restless Youth comprised two- sections.
The first was a philosophical treatment of student unrest,
its motivation, histor, and tactics. This section drew
heavily on overt literature and FBI reporting on Students
for a Democratic Society and affiliated groups. In a sense,
the survey of dissent emerged from a shorter (30 page)
typescript study of] SDS and its foreign ties the same
author had done for Nr. Rostow at the DCL's irequest in

4. Because of the paucity of dngormation on foreign
student movements, it was necessary to focus'on SDS which
then monopolized the field of student action here and
abroad. A second section comprised 19 country chapters--
ranging from Argentina to Yugoslavia--and stood by itself
as a review of foreign student dissidence.

SUBJECT: Involvement In Domestic Affairs °

‘1, This memorandum responds to the DDI's
request for a listing of any questionable
involvements in domestic affairs, I do not believe
that CRS is doing anything that a reasonable
man could construe as improper.

2. CRS does, of course, have several programs
to acquire still pictures, movies, videotares
and books either privately, secretly or without
acknowledgement that CIA is the actual end user.

3. CRS files do not generally bear on U.S.
citizens or organizations. The biographic file-
building criteria specifically excludes U.S.
nationals unless the person has become of such
Major importance in the political life of a foreign
country that the file is. essential. (To my knowledge,
only 2 persons so qualify. | .

_Our Cuban files probably include whe
some persons who are now U.S. citizens but we fae
have no way to separate them; we have files on
U.S. defectors to, Cuba.)

SUBJECT: Involvement In Domestic Affairs

4. The CIA Library has several informal
snag files intended to aid the librarians in
answering ‘the kinds of questions that they know
they will get on a continuing basis, An
appointnents file is a colle tion of clippings
on appointed federal officials: who holds what
job when and what is his background? Yhe extremist
files are a collection of folders on a variety
of organizations and a few people with intricate’
Organizational links. Any sort of extremism
is grist for these particular files. Anda few
persons, ¢c.g., Rap Brown and Eldridge Cleaver,
have dossiers consisting almost exclusively of
clippings from-public media. These files are
unclassified and consist mostly of clippings
from the public press: U.S., foreign, underground,
scholarly.

5. I am not aware of any other kind of
involvement in domestic activities that is not
related to development of techniques or logistics
or legitimate training of CRS personnel.

MEMORANDUM FOR!’ DDI
SUBJECT : Sensitive Activities

TFL | X8)

1. FBIS has been engaged in no activities related to the ‘ELisberg
and Watergate cases, * eee

2. FBIS operations occasionally extend to the domestic arena. From
time to time, FBIS linguists are made available to DDO or Office of

Connunications componeats for special operations (usually abroad) involving

close-support. SIGINT work or translation of audio take. ‘On one occasion
recently DDO, on behalf of the FBI, requested the services of several
FBIS linguists skilled in Arabic to work directly for the FBI oa a short-
term project here in Washington. The arrangements were made by Mr. Oberg
of the DDO CI Staff. He said the project was very highly classified and
that FBIS participation was approved by Mr. Colby and the Director. FBIS
participation was.approved by the Director of FBIS after a check with
the ADDI. Other examples of sensitive linguistic support.work are help
“in the handling and resectlement of defectors, the recent assignment of
an employee to the. Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs to transcribe
recordings in a rare Chinese dialect, and the detailing of another
Chinese linguist on two occasions to assist in the U.S. military training
of Chinese Nationalist cadets.

3. Within its responsibility for monitoring press agency trans—
missions for intelligence information, FBIS publishes and distributes
some material which’falls in a "gray" area of copyright protection, libe?,
and privacy of international communications. Press services controlled
by national governments and transmitted by radioteletype without i
specific addressees, c.g. the Soviet TASS service and the PRC's NCNA,
are monitored by FARIS and the material is disseminated without restric—
tion. The legality of this has been affirmed by decisions of the
Office of General Counsel. |

QOKR?



ry

4. The routine FBIS monitoring of foreign tadio broadcasts often
involves statements or speeches made by U.S. citizens using those radio
facilities. Examples are statements made or allegedly made by American
POW's in Hanoi, by Jane Fonda in Hanoi and by Ramsey Clark in Vietnan.
At the request of FBI and the Department of Justice, and with the
approval of the CIA Office of General Counsel, we have on occasion sub-
mitted transcripts of such broadcasts to the Department of Justice as
|part of that Department's consideration of a possible trial. In such
cases, we have been required to submit names of FBIS monitors involved, j
presumably because of the possibility they might be required as witnesses. |!
(In one case in 1971, an FBIS staff cmployee was directed to appear as

{Jan expert witness in the court-martial of a Marine. enlisted man charged
_Jwith aiding the enemy in a broadcast from Hanoi.) FBIS views all this
with misgivings. Monitoring of such broadcasts is incidental and we
rue attributicn of their news to FBIS, and. we should not be considered

policemen maintaining surveillance of traveling Americans.

5. FBIS is an overt organization, but one aspect of its operations
is under Department of Commerce cover. The Joint Publications Research
Service (JPRS) was established in 1957 to provide the means through which
great volumes of material from unclassified foreign publications could
be translated by large numbers of independent contractors in the United
States on a piece rate basis. Contractors are not witting of their CIA

employment. |

. i FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

TSD has had a close:working relationship with the FBI over
the past few years. The FBI is the only organization that has
been fully briefed on TSD audio techniques and equipment. The
following are situations where TSD equipment and guidance were
involved in operations: :

(A) Identity 59 - Four masked transmitters were
installed. Two have failed and two remain workable.

(B) Identity 60 | - A TSD built masked transmitter
_ was.-installed to collect emanations from a crypto-
. graphic machine. The system continues to function
when samples of the emanations are needed.

. (C) Identity 61 - Two transmitters have been
installed and are operating. One is specifically
designed to collect the sounds of typewriting, the
other is a straight audio transmitter to collect con-
versations. A FBI agent is manning the listening
post. A third system is not oper-
ating, probably due to battery expiration. The tape
made from this room was made'by the National
Security Agency before failure.

(D) Identity 62 - TSD furnished equipment and con-

sultation covering Identity 62
First masked switched trans-

mitters were used in two apartments used as tempor-"
“ary quarters, Later masked switched transmitters
and microwave transmitters were installed in the
permanent quarters along with mic and wire installa-
tions, entirely furnished by the Bureau. This install-
ation is not fully operational because the full comple~
ment of personnel have not yet arrived.

DLUTIET

(EL | - This is an operation - ee
participation by National Security Agency. It is
designed in anticipation of the Identity 64
‘ ; in Washington. The listening post was
obtained by usinglthe Agency coverf,mechanisms
for procuring the property. New systems are
being designed and produced by using TSD's covert
contractor mechanisms and TSD engineers.

(F) Identity 65 . | = Ten masked audio devices pur-
chased from TSD were installed in Identity 65

by the FBI. .Part of the equipment was install-
ed in November and December 1971, the remaining
equipment was installed 17.- 25 March 1972. Tests
made by a TSD officer from a temporary. FBI
listening post on 8 - 9 November 1972, proved that
the target equipment no longer functioned and was
_ believed discovered by the occupants,

(G) TSD has furnished equipment items which constitute
an on-thé~-shelf capability to engage in photo and
audio surveillance operations which might not be
known to the Agency. In one case it is known that a
relatively unsophisticated device was used against
a domestic target. :

en : : —,

1.. In December 1968, July 1969 and December 1970, SDB
provided basic countersabotage familiarization training for
selected members of the Washington metropolitan area police
departments. The training was given at the Fairfax County
police pistol and rifle range. Authorization for the train-
ing came from DDP and Chief, Office of Security.

2. On occasion during the past few years, under the
auspices of the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration of
the Department of Justice and with the approval of CI Staff
and Office of Security, SDB provided training and familiari-
zation. to police officers of several domestic police
departments in the uses of the Explosives Residue Detection
Technique and Trace HNetals Detection Technique. These tech-
niques had been declassified and are currently available to

e law enforcement community. The National Bomb Data Center
publishes periodic guidance in their uses. :

3. In order to augment the SDB mission responsibilities
in.the field of countersabotage and counterterror, SDB offi-
cers have in the past two years visited, under appropriate
covers, the explosives disposal units of the New York City
police department, Dade County (iiiami) Florida Dept. and the
Los Angeles Police Dept. Also, in March 1973,-two SDB offi-
cers attended the Explosives and Ordnance Disposal Conference
in Sacramento, California, sponsored by LEAA. When the
recent letter bomb menace began in September 1972, our liaison
with the NYCPD bomb squad paid off in that we had complete in-~
formation on letter bomb construction in hours, enabling the: V
Agency to make worldwide dissemination within a day. ea

ab a DOMESTIC TESTS FOR
Ae AGENCY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS

1.'. As a normal part of ORD's efforts in the
research and development of equipment and techniques
for Agency applications in foreign intelligence, we
conduct experiments and ‘tests in the United States.
Clearly,.the design and development of our intelli-
gence equipments can be done more economically and
more securely in this country. Although most of

the tests of our R&D equipments are performed in
closed laboratories or in secure areas simulating
the foreign environment, some of the tests and experi-
ments, of necessity, reveal domestic information.

ee 2. A review of the surveillance equipment or
techniques which have at some time or other: been
exposed to domestic testing is as follows:

a. Laser Probe - About 1967, the laser
probe developed by ORD was tested by TSD in
San Francisco under very closely controlled
conditions. The ORD Project Officer witnessed
portions of the test. Recordings. that were

-made of laser probe output were carefully
peontrolled as classified material and it is

believed that the tapes have long since been
destroyed.

itself, i.e., leaving one religion for another,
or changing one set of political beliefs for
another. The work was conducted at Stanford

MEMORANDUM FOR: Executive Secretary, CIA-Management
Committee

SUBJECT : Reported Identity 61 . Burglary

1, Attached is a report summarizing what we know about the
reported break-in of Identity 61. An investigative report
by an officer of the Exccutive Protective Service states that the
offices were ransacked and a ee of personal items stolen.-

‘2. The attached summary also describes a separate audio
operation conducted against Identity 61 . by the FBI, at the
(Beeney's] | ts] behest and with its technical support. This presents a
Castes question that should be noted. James McCord's‘ testimony

indicates that he placed telephone. calls to the Identity 75 and Identity

61. - He says he picked the numbers at random, hoping
that if his phone was tapped his attorneys would be able to challenge
the evidence as being tainted. Another witness, John Caulficld,
says McCord called the two named Iden 75 and Iden 61 because he "was sure"
they "were hid ad of national security wirctaps."'

3. In fact, there has been a long-standing telephone tap on the
Identity 75 , run by the FBI, about whicl{ CI Staf{pelieves McCord
knew. It is possible that he also had an inkling of some sort of operation
agéinst Identity 61 *, and assumed that it was also a telephone
tap. One must speculate that he played for double insurance, hoping
that both his telephones and those of the Iden 75 and Iden 61 were tapped, and
that one way or another his case would be dismissed or dropped
because of tainted evidence or to avoid revealing the sensitive
operations. At this point, given the publicity of the Iden 61 break-in,
and the testimony of McCord and Caulfield, the current investigations

may lead to exposure of the operations,

MEMORANDUM FOR: Inspector General
SUBJECT : Reported Burglary of the Identity 61 -

1. The press reported a burglary of Identity 61 _ 13-14

May 1973. An investigative report by an officer of the Executive
Protective Service states that the offices were ransacked and a
number of personal items were stolen. There were some latent
fingerprints, but no identification was made. The FBI, which states
that the incident was on 15 May, did not investigate because it deter-
mined that it did not have jurisdiction. The Identity 61

registered a formal complaint and American regrets were expressed,
Identity 61 making it clear that they suspected something other than
ordinary robbery. We have no additional information on the subject.
There had been an carlier intelligence operation against the Identity 61
which is déscribed below,

< v 2. On 16 April 197¥ the Agency\proposed to the FBI the instal-
ion of technical coverage of Idertity 61 The opportunity

é)

b

for such an installation came about when a domestic asset of Foreign
Resources Division reported that he had been asked to submit a bid

for a contract to renovate Identity 61 Upon securing the
contract the assct was willing to augment his work force as appropriate
ox install material which would be provided him, (The Agency proposed
to turn this asset over to the FBI and to provide technical and logistic
support. ‘ The value of such an operation to the intelligence community
was cited.

3. On 23 April 1971 FBI Director John Edgar Hoover turned
down the Agency proposal. That same day CIA Director Richard Helms
sent a letter to Attorney-General John Mitchell requesting that the FBI
turndown be reversed, citing the importance of the Iden 61 target and
national intelligence needs to collect positive intelligence. . On 24 April
the Attorney-General reversed the FBI decision and the Washington
Field Office of the Bureau was instructed to proceed with the operation.

4, During the period from 26 April to 18 May all the
technical equipment from the Agency .to the FBI was delivered,
installed and tested. Everything seemed to be working. No Agency.
personnel were involved-in any way with actual installation of
equipment in Identity 61 From May to February Agency tech-
nicians helped calibrate, reset and do other repair work on occasions
of equipment failure in the FBI listening post. On no occasion did
they enter Identity 61. :

A was initiated afCIA's)request. The operation and equipment, to the
best of the Agenty's knowledge, was dormant until 8 December 1972
when the FBI was asked by the Agency to reactivate coverage. The
* request at this time was occasioned by the knowledge that a Iden 76
delegation would be arriving in Washington for discussions on
nationalization of foreign holdings, While the FBI was still
i in the process of reactivating the equipment, the Department of
i State on 20 December 1972 requested the FBI to institute all possible.

coverage of Identity 61 and on 22 December 1972 coverage
was partially reinstituted with full coverage in effect by 26 December
1972.

6. A review of the take from the operation, weighed against
ZS the risks involved, led the Agency to conclude that the activity was
not worth continuing. On 16 February 197% ClA/requested the FBI
WE to discontinue the coverage. On 22 February 1973 the FBI advised
W that microphone surveillance of Iden 61 was discontinued,

FR officers in the field maintain coordination with
their FBI countérparts. There is limited cooperation
with Bureau offices on internal security cases involving

The local field offices of the FBI are.made aware of the
presence of FR officers in their jurisdictions and have on
occasion provided backs topping on cases. where there reel
