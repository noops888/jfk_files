RE:

CC:

John Pereira

The JFK collection contains a number of documents on Gilberto Policarpo Lopez including a

small 201 file (14 pages). I have attached two documents that summarize the material on him in the

collection. I did not locate any information on Lopez's activities in Havana or his current whereabouts.

The most recent references in the collection are from 1977-79 and deal with HSCA's investigation.

There are numerous references to Joaquin Hernandez Armas, Cuban Ambassador to Mexico in

1963, in the JFK collection. Most of the documents deal with a telephone conversation between the

President of Cuba (Dorticos) and the Ambassador a few days after the assassination of JFK. I found no

information in the collection on when Hernandez Armas was recalled or subsequent positions held.

According to one document, he was still in Mexico City in June 1965.
