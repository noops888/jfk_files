Info Re Conversation with Cleve Backster in
‘tAnastatia" Matter (22, 838-X)

SUBJECT

1. In response to requestfrom Mr. fra shizo) following are the
facts to the best of my recollection (I made some notes at the time, but
have just recently destroyed them) of mydealings with Cleve Backster
in the celebrated 'Anastatia" case. It has recently come to light, with
the publication in the Washington DAILY NEWS, 19 January 1965, of an
interview with Herman E. Kimsey, former Chief, TSD/GARB/A&R, that
one Col. Michael Goleniewski, Polishdefector, might be related to
“Anastatia'.

2. At about 2330 hours, sometime in February or March 1964
(specific date not recalled) Cleve Backster, director or owner of the
Academy for Scientific Interrogation, New York, called me at my home
and attempted to engage me, on a private basis, as a handwriting expert
or questioned document examiner to examine and compare some hand-
writing specimens of a Chicago woman named Smith with the handwriting
of 'tAnastatia"' in an attempt to prove that Smith was the true ''Anastatia''.

3. Ihave never met Backster but have known of him for about
10 years, have read some of his articles on the operation of the polygraph,
and did know that he is a long-time friend of Kimsey's. It is claimed,
by Kimsey at least, that Backster set up the polygraph {lie detector)
program for the Agency.

4, [told Backster during the conversation that it would be impossible
for me to do any work for him on the matter of trying to prove that Mrs.
Smith was the real 'Anastatia", citing heavy work load at the office or some
similar reason to placate him. (Frankly, from what I knew about him, his
connection or association with Kimsey, and entire muddled background of
the "Anastatia'' matter, I was determined not to have any dealings with him. )

5. Ihave not had any conversation with him since. This was the

first and only one.

6. Mero! __—rspymas, did make some graphological

analysis for Backster on a contract basis, and I believe she furnished
him my residence phone number, or perhaps Kimsey supplied it.
