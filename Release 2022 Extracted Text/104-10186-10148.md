source A former Cuban IS officer who served with the Cuban Intelligence
Service until April 1964.

1. The Direccion General de Inteligencia (General Directorate of
Intelligence - DGI) Headquarters in "M" Building operates on a~
schedule from 8:00 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. daily. Personnel are re~
quired to sign time and attendance records and once in the
building at 8:00 are not permitted to leave it until 5:30, They
are given lunch in the building cafeteria; each has a meal ticket,
issued by the Personnel Department, which is punched for each
meal consumed; the DGI, not the individual employee, pays. A
DGI officer from one of departments outside the headquarters
building may eat in the Building cafeteria; he gets a lunch
ticket from the personnel officer and also shares the mess free,
the meal being deducted from his regular mess facilities in his
own building.

2. The "M" Building is guarded outside by Departamento de Seguridad
del Estado (Department of State Security - DSE) personnel, two
at the main gate and two at the rear gate. Beside the large
double wooden gates, which have metal bars to close them, there
4S a small door for pedestrians. It contains a peephole through
which the guards can inspect anyone seeking entrance on foot or |
by car. Persons arriving by car sound a horn to notify the guards
that they wish admittance. If the guards recognize the pedestrian
or driver, they open the gate and admit them. If the person is
not known, the guards ask his identity and whom he wishes to see |
and telephones to the person: named and requests permission to q
admit the visitor. If permission is given, the gate is opened
and the visitor proceeds without escort. Each gate guard is
armed with an M-52 rifleandaPPSha or Czech M-25 machine gun,
and may in addition carry a personal weapon, usually a pistol,
The gates are opened by hand, not electrically.

There are no DSE guards inside the DGI building, except for the
guard quarters (dormitory) in "M" Building. The headquarters
has two duty officers, who alternate, 24 hours on and 24 hours
off. They are not officially ior visidiy armed, but may carry a
personal weapon, usually a pisitol, as zany DGI officers do.
Most of the pistols are U.S. 38-caliber, 45-caliber, or Soviet
Red Star. Employees in “M" Building are required to lock up all
documents and lock their room doors ary time the room is not
occupied. Keys are deposited in a key room. There is also a
Secret Office, on the second floor of the building, where docu=
ments of all kinds are kept. Employees may borrow documents,
Signing out for them, for the day; everything must be returned
at night. Generally, each officer keeps his own files, locked
in a key-lock metal cabinet, in his owa office, 5

Originally a building pass was required for entry into "M"
Building. Each officer assigned to the building had a pass,
Similar in appearance to a driver's license. Officers working

in departments outside the "M" Buildizg compound , however, did
not all have passes, although some did. *The difficulty of ob=
taining a pass for entry into the building became so complicated ~
that outside DGI employees sometimes resorted to showing their
driver's licenses for admission, and successfully, There was
always confusion about entrances. Finally the pass system became
so cumbersome that it was abolished altesether, and admission to
the compound is entirely on a basis of gersonal recognition by
the guards, or, as noted above, by verizication by telephone

from an officer inside. Tnis applies bosh to personnel regularly
working in the building and to DGI employees from departments

outside the compound.

The same system applies in tho Departaneato de Liberacion Nacional

(National Liberation Department - LN) dzilding. There are four
DSE guards at the outside gate who check all incoming persons,
If the guards do aot recognize a person, they telephone te whom-
ever the caller wishes to see in the ding and obtain: -per=
mission to-admit him.

The LN Department also has a duty officer system, separate from
that of "M" Building. Each officer in turn serves a 24-hour
tour as duty officer; a regular roster is kept. The LN Depart-
ment does not observe regular office hours like the main head-
quarters; because of operational necessity, officers work when
they must, They are not paid overtime asd are not required to
sign time and attendance records, If they are working during
meal hours, they receive food in the building; they do not have
their own cafeteria but bring in food from the Departamento
Escuelas Especiales (Lepartment of Special Schools - EE)

Up to December 1963, the LN'and Illegal Departments were combined
ina single unit known as the MA Section (Intelligence), which
occupied a large house at Calic S4 betveex 3 and 5a (on a corner
with no house number), in the Miramar Dsstrict of Havana, Per-
sonnel of the two elements shared offices indiscriminately, al-
though there was a differentiation in work as to illegal
or guerrilla operations. In December 1535, the two functions
were separated, and the LN Department reved to two buildings at
6610 and 6612.7th Avenue, between G6th acd 70th Streets, in the
Ampliacion de Almendares section of the
The Illegal Department remained in the Calle 94 house about one
moath and then moved to a new, ainknown,. location in Alturas del
Vedado section of Havana, The LN Departmeat has about thirty

members, besides t: four DSE men, The office at Calle 94'was
still unoccupied in April 1964 but was guarded by two DSE men,

While the MA Section existed, it had a secret office like that
in "M" Building, but when the section divided, LN did not
establish a new secret office tor itself.

Only members of tho DGI are admitted to DGI cfficial installa-
tions; not even members of “other government security agencies
may enter the DGI buildings. Any contact a DSI officer wishe:
with any non-DGI emplcyve mest be made outside the official
establishments. The DGI has one of its regular officers (identity
unknown) stationed in the DSE headquarters to handle liaison. A
DGI member who has business with the DSE applies to PINEIRO‘s
secretary, "Vidalina", who is the officiil contact center in

DGI headquarters, stating whom he wants to see ard why. "Vidalina"
gets in touch with the DGi liaison officer at DSE headquarters,

and arranges with hin a contact in some public place between the
officers of the two servides. When the appointment is made,
“Vidaliaa" notifies ths DGi requesting cfficer, the DGI liaison
notifies the DSE responding officer, and the two meet according

to the arrangements mad« for them. The only possible exception

to the above rule is Ramon VASQUEZ, who may be a member of the

DSE, Before 1961, VASQUEZ had an extensive acquaintance in the
government; when the DSE was formed in 1961, he became a recruiter
of personne] for it. From there, because of his large number of
contacts, he extended his vices to the DGI, reporting to it any
persons he considere! suttable for starf employment, It is not
certain whether he is a nenber of the DSE, of the DGI, or of some
other agency, cr whs rhis activitics in this line are official
or unofficial, At any rate, he may enter the DGI offices when-
ever he wishes, He was trained in Moscow before April 1961 and

at the time of the Bay of Pigs was suddenly promoted from
licutenant to captain. in the G-2.

The DGI has an office to which persons may apply for employment
and where new recruits are interviewed, It is in Edificio 51,
on the 12th floor, at 13th and N, Vedado, Havana.
