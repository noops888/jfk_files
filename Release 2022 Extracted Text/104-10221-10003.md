Appraisal of Content: 2,

On 23 October 1963 David Turner, leador of the Vanguard of National
Action (VAN - radical pro-Cuban revolutionary group), informed membors -
of the VAN directorate that ho -héd received-acail from Thelma King,
pro-Cuban deputy to the National Assombly, a fow days earlier, Turner
said that tho purpose of the call was to arrange for Turner to meet.
Victor Rico Galan, a Mexican newspaporman who works for Fidel Castro.?
Turnor sald that the interview took placo in Rico's room at the Hotel
International, and was attended by King, Turner, and Hugo Alejandro
Victor, president of the Partido dol Pucblo (PPP, People's Party-
Communist), with which the VAN is disputing leadership of the revolution
in Panama, Turnor said that Rico questioned his guests about unity
among the leftwing groups in Panama, and Victor cddly informed him
only that effats were being made to roach an understanding. Turnor
refrained frommking any comment at that time. Rico invited his
visitors to have lunch with him; however, Victor declined, and King

“wont in seanch of copies of newspapers which had reproduced statements

of Panamanian students warning against plans of the National Guard to
stage o coup dtotat in Panama, Rico had specifically asked for these

publicatIons. Thi@ gave Turner an opportunity to talk alone with
Rico, and he informed him of VAN activities anc of the steps being

takén by the VAN to bring about an armed movement tn Panama, since
- conditions were ripe for such action,

Around 26 Octobor 1963 Ruben Dario Souza Batista, national secretarye
gencral of the PDP, said that a Cuban agent had recently visited

Panama to urge the VAN and the PDP to resclve their differences and ,
unite. The PDP, however, violently rejected the suggestion, Souza ,

said that PDP leaders planned to ascertain the corroct name of tho :

agent and submit a writton, protest concerning ihe activities to
tho Soviet Embassy in Mexico.

Around 5 November 1963 Ruperto Luther Thomas, national .secretary
of propaganda of the PDP, informed regionablevel PDP 1 that
, Armando Conte, a writer for Tiempos in Mexico, recontly ¢i

Panama and spoke with. Victor.
the Cubans, and had come to Panama to convince Victor of t!

that the PDP would not be ‘told what to do,. because | it bad its own
on the Panamanian Revolution.

Field Conmenta

Rico arrived in Panama from San Jose, Costa Rica, on 20 October 963,

1.
at which time he provided the following Personal date on his
‘- landing card:

“Born on 6 February 1928-at £1 Ferrol reomably in Mexico7
Citizen of Mexico, bearer of passport No. 16897

Occupation = newspaperman
Permanent Address - Providencia 930, Mexico, D. F.

Rico left Panama for Venezuela on 22 October 1963.

2. Travel records contain no information on the arrival of any
and the name is believed to be a pseudonym used by Rico. It
is interesting to note that two VAN sources identified the
visiting Moxican journalist by the name of Rico or Risco}
however,no PDP source has reported that name, and Souza's
comments as reported in paragraph 2 tend to indicate that the

visitor concealed his identity from the PDP.

ot all but the expression of their opinions.

* I have arrived here together with Comandante Adan after # series of ‘
hardships and of mary delays owing to a mmber of reasons which he can t

explain in detail even better perhaps than I could.
I have beon making these tripe without a vina because the. compaiiero

Fnrique seems not be overly fond of me, and motivated by two reasons,

One of then 1s to try to put my shoulder o little to the wonderful

etruggle you are carrying on, by 4 reportage on the guerrilles. The other
Yeason was my concern over a number of cfireunstances, and basically the
arrest of Calvan in Guatonala, ;

So I came with the wish primarily of giving you the itema of infor-
mation I had, and particularly to Comandante Adan. I male this clear
because there has been considerable speculation to the effect that I was
being sent by the Cubsn comrades and even that my opinions vere not mine
In fect, sone comrades
suggested to me the advisability that I should mention this here,

I refused, of courso, for a basic reasons because 4t 49 not ao,

T did not come hereas arepresentative of the Cuban comrades, whon I have
not seen since Pt in none of these problems had arisen, or tf
they hed arisen they ware tot acquainted with then, or if they ware
acquainted with then thoy did not tell mé about then, So, I have no idea
what their opinion on the subject may bo. Consequently, all I can do 4a
apeculate “on what night be their thinking to tho Liait that I om aware of
their general ideas; ani then, since I know what they think about tho
Liberation moversnts in Latin Auerica, I can tmogine what thoy night

think with rogard to these problens.


He | Fiat

i
i :
But you ald can sangisie that, otnoe you also know whet they think.
Seances So there would be.no sense to my trip here if ita purpose ware to tell. : :
You eomethiiig: that you may know perfectly well. What I have stated here :
} hes been on my own exclusive responsibility and aa a result of ay (word :
ae ‘unintelligitie} working alone, : :
a : T have told the Conandante that in ay opinion thers have arieon here
a number of problens which have objective roots but witch have become
ecmovhat’ complicated and distorted to tha extent of leading to a aituation
that may be dangerous in the future, that may convert tho Trece de
Novienbre into just another group, another sect, that may therefore
foolate slightly fran tho masses in gonoral or at least fron a number of
strata of the poople whose aupport in the otruggle is important,
: On the international plane I have aeen the ingortance of the Trece
i do Novierbre as a symbol of the struggle for nationa Liberation not only
of Quatenala tut also of Latin America, and the importance af Camandanto

Adan ag the chief or head of that nucleus, The reportsse I wrote on it
: juat a yoor ace ea aucebsnful partly owing to the collaboration of the

I was here covertly and thet, of course, limited my activity--I hava

T think for this reason that you must view your problegs not as
enother group carrying on polemics with otter groupe but to sone extent
from the height in which you are placed, even physically. You aust
Tealise that the difficulties there have been are duo basically to the
fact that the conrades in the FUT hare long delayed turning into deeds
their own idess oa the struggle. They have edt forth a lino to the effect
that aspects may mot be discussed but that (phrase unintelligible] correct.
‘Tho 1l-point. resolution of Decembor vhich places the armed struggle and -
especially the guorrills phase at the core of the revolutionary struggle
ovens to me to te correct in gonoral, But they have hed many difficulties
because there hava been debates, obscurities, scmo of them perhaps did not
underotand that or were opposed=-I do not knov, I do not have many details,
Dut of course it has not been poesibles thoy have not found it possible or
else have lacked the capability to devote their activity to the armed
atruggle, Consequantly their participation, which there has been--wa cannot
deny its T think it would be unjust to dany tho participation of tho PGT-—
hes been the participation of a rearguant, of support, Thay have lost
cadres here in (tetabad? ) and elsewhora , suffered the consequences of tho
struggles some comrades of tho POT are actively persecuted--but always in
connection with aupport activities,

I believe your role ts to drag them into a nore active participation
in tho strugrle--not to fight thea or fight them only to the oxtent that
euch a fight may lead thea into the battle and not occasion a eplit, In
ey opinion this 4s going to bo much easter fra now on because, altough
what happenod with the publication of tho newspapar io dangerous in ay

of confusion, especially among a people which 1s ‘not: politically sqphistt-
cated, ag in Ouatenslan-, I think that despite those --- those negative
things this hes been the clang of a bell; has shown the comrades in the
POT the extent. to which they had committed orrors md abandoned a number
of possibilities of struggle. aa

About that I havo talked to them at considerable length and have talked
to them in utter- loyalty and clarity, and they adait that all that is taking
place ig not the product of error on the part of the Trece or a bad line
of-the Trece exclusively but a product of their very own errors also.
They do assume their share of rosponsibility and I think it 1s important
that you know and appreciate that fact--importan!, for this reason, that there
might arise in sows comrades, and I am referring particularly to Rolando,
a certain lowering of morale: that he might think that he erred in some things
and might allow himsolf to be destroyed politically. I think this would be
3 serious error, do you not? and I think 4t would be falee attitude, We must
atart fron the premise that everybody has committed errors ani that these

errors. have been cosmonplace everywhere, let us renenber, for instance,

that in Cuba thore was in the organisation of that famous strikm, the ono
that failed, of April 1959, none other that a David Salvador, who waa o
Falengista, and there wag none other than a [B11] DeWalt?) who waa an
imperialist agents and that in Cuba there wore public statementa of tha
26 July movement which Fidel Castro had to disown later, and there was
constant misunderstanding between the peopio who wre in the sierras and
the militants in the cities; and there were very esrious conflicts betwoon

the PCP and the 26 July novesant; and there vere all those paraites froa

thoy always maintained was thatthe fundenental nucleus of the 26 July,
organisation was an agent of cohesion of the revolutionaby forces, and they
svacéeded in polarising those revolutionary forces and guccoeded in avoiding :
Probless, and this. in the end led the revolutionary forces to victory. :

With regard to this, I would like to tell-you something else} I have
over beoh in favor of that attitude, very widely gererelised in Latin
America, which is to say: "Well, you can see what Fidel did. This was
Rot done by Pidels this was done by Pidel." I think this is abysmal error,
because what Fidel did he did-under very special historical dirdlnetances,
and what you are doing is different and has to be different. You have no
reason at all to follow the Cuban or any other exporience, but I do think
it 49 advisable to learn from international experience and take advantage
of it to tho extent that it may be useful.

I say thin bocause it scems to ms that there has been here a certain
Adsalistic tendoncy to take a position above the masses. I am referring to
the debates on the character of the revolution, on the participation of
tho bourgeoisie, whethar tho Chinase or the Soviets are right, and a nusber
of questions like that, I realise very well that when I eay this you may
say that I am half out of my mind or that I aa unwilling to commit myself
to a position, That ia not sos I shall try to explain my idea aa clearly ao
T can.

Hy idea 49 this: then you are struggling in a country which 19 highly
dovoloped, very complicated, politically very sophisticated, whoro there is
4 working class of great experience, politically info med, militant, whore
oven the poanants thessolves are acutely avare of thair probleas, thatr neds

authority 1t hag to persuade masses which have high political sophistication,
In our countries we face no such problems. We do not face suh probleas :
deceuse our ‘aasoce ore thoroughly unconcerned ffon a political standpoint.

In another «=» rather, stated in better terms, more clearly and ore
accurately, they have a very elementary understanding of thoir problems.
‘The concern of the peasant 19 for the soils I do not think 4t goes beyond
that at tho moment. I believe that if the peasant is offered land, is
offered schooling for his children, medical care, and so forth, he will not
demand any more explanations. He sees no other problems,

So, when I read in Revolucion Socialista all these things, about the
Bolivian masses, the armed militias, 1t 1s a truly shocking confusion, And
I oay this because I know Bolivia, I have been there, I have seen their real
problems. When T seo all this about Poru, where the massea are said to be
doing their will, with @ semifoudal government, it 1s truly --- it seem to
wa that wo aro falling into a number of quostions which there 4s’ no purpose

Just about by pitching a rock ag him, can ho not? ee ee

This, all thie tonds to indicate that to exaggerate Adeclogical’ questions
to the masses will lead us nowhere, I have been able to observe that the
follewing has happened with the nowspaper--and I told Comandante Adan yea-
terdaye-1 that those who understand it do not approve of it. And I am not
referring to the people of the PGT but to many wellemoaning poople: for
instance, to Rodtigo Asturias, who is in Mextoo, a survivor of the (Cunquat?),
A wholesome follow, studious, concerned, who 1s very anxious to cau here

the poople, the masses that do not understand it, cannot understand oll that
complicated terainology, all that obscurity, all those genoralisations of
concepts “tat do not stimulate anybody to tho struggln, that do not pose
actual and concrete objectives.

‘That: 1s mg opinton, I believe that on thin point you must establish
a very oliiful, very intelligent balance between your own political training
and your dally contact with the masses, and you will gradually be told {io}
what the masses must be told.

Gn thia potnt-.I say thie rather to coureds Rolando-~, putting thoge

dens into slightly theoretical form, it would be necessary to reread and
stady that fanous document by Bao Tse-tung on contradiction, where he
explains how contradictions are gredually displaced in the evolution of ;
society and particularly, in a revolution, how the basic contradiction a
gradublly displaces other contradictions which often are ths mat apparent :
ones and are most manifest to the masses and which all express the basic
or fundanental contradiction but express it in different ways. :

So we have no reason to propose the destruction of the bourgeoisie. and

alienate the support of a nusber of people who feel bourgeois. I myself,
to come'here, was helped by petty bourgeois of this area itself, These
petty bourgeois, of course, are not the national bourgeoisie to which the
Program of the POT refers, but they feel they are bourgeois. They cannot
Aistinguish, when you condemn the national bourgeoisie in the newspaper,
they cannot distinguish between themselves and whether thoy are or are not
‘the national bourgeoisie, They feel affected, Why should we alienate their
collaboration?

T even pointed out to the Comandante cases such ag that ef Pancho
yaLlagran Jpemrt there is no'doubt that ho is bourgedds, a bourgaots
Adeologist and a bourgeois politician,yet he has given you his collaboration
and may give it again, What need is thare to have a fight with hia? Ons
watt maintati the fimmnese of principles, as Comandante Adan did in the
interview, apecify clearly the disagreements, but not picture him az an enony,
It seems to me that on this point Coaandante Agan expressed the true policy,
which consisted not in daying, "Villagran io our eneuy because he is bour-
geoin"=-which would be tha logical consequence of what has beon published
in the novspapar—-but to say, "Ho ia my friond but I think that he is

tho right thing to-do. Also, the movenent is at a stage where whit it
needs te friends, ca sae

Woll, I think I have talked a good deal and rather haphazardly, but—=
I wish you had arrived; I was clinging to that hope, although I knew it
was very unlikely, since you have already delayed too long. Unfortunitely
it has not been that vey, has 4t? So I wanted to leave my greeting to you
and somo of the impressions I have of the eitustion.

Tecan edd something to what I have already told you. The comrades of
the POT asked me after I had boon here for quite a few days and they had
shown na a number of things--I even think that they wanted to be sincere
becawe they also showed me tapes in which they were harshly criticized,
in which their own cadros criticised them--they arranged interviews for me
with persons within the party who aro in disagreement with the leedership--
in short, I waa able to get a considerably more objective picture--they
anked me for my observations and eritictona, which I gave them in al] loyalty.

The basic criticisn I believe continues to be the lack of mere active
participation in the arned etrugegle and of the channeling of carea to tho
armed struggle,This I think continues to be ths main problem; they admit it,
In genoral I must tell you that most of my criticisms wera well received

by then.
ah
I oven asked for a talk with’ Guerra Borges because I thought that his

article in the International [1.e. World Marxist] Review contained sone
expressions of opinion which were not correct, although in othors it was
on the right track, we dincusead it and he had a receptive attitude, and
tn the end adaitted that there vas sonseerrar, oving to the neod to asks

Gn the point, which I think haa been posed here rather insistently, of
whether the bourgeoisie participates, the fenous thesis. of the four classes,
in other words, they wore telling me--I oa referring particularly to the
comrades of the political commission, with whon.I had a lengthy moting--
they have applied it somewhat mechanically, somewhat as convention dictates,

“ag hae beon done by a majority of, the parties in countries such as this one, i

but without actually having a clear notion on the subject, and among thea
there wore arguments, struggles, and disagreements with regard to the role
of the bourgeotale. i: : :

So I think that it 1s perfectly possible to debato on this point, I
do not think that the policy should be to set out a public thesis, and even
lesa a public polemic. I do not think that it is particularly important
to the struggle that the theory of the four classes te uphold publicly. I
do not think that, anyono will be disappointed to ace that in thia country
there is a peasontry or a proleteriat so radical and so enlightened that
it will refuse to cooperate with the national bourgeoisie, So I think it
ie 8 goxewhat unproductive polemic.

T am algo fully convinced that tha national bourgeoisia has no revolu-
tionary role to play at this time in Latin America ani much less in Guatemala,
And that it doss not depend on the theories proposed or the thinking of Guerra
Borges, or tho thinking of Rubto or the thinking of anyono else... I believe
that is a fact, and facte are above all elec, And I think that the moment
that the struggle grows up, that the revolutionary power grows strong and
4s e atablished on a free territory, this will be seen still more cleerly.
But I eee no reason why this should be announced a prioris that is, I do
not see why we ehould make the revolution in the newspopere, if it is

doing carried on ia the mountains,

Now I would like to aay @ few words for our comrads Holendo. They are
nothing secret, but they are things which interest his porsonally,

Isabol 1s in Cubs, I loft 15 days ago todays that 19, yesterday, Satur-
day, it was two weeks. The day after my departure sle was to leave for Cuba,
‘by way of Buropo, of course, so she would-be able to return, The trip had
already beon set up by Conandante Quovare, end Isabel had been invited,

Dut it had not been made definite because the Cubans zove very slowly in

some things. Just after the trip of (woman's naneJ ant the letter’ Rolando
sent me, and in view of what he waa roquosting of me in that letter--and

the difficult aitustion that she was in, obviously, from every viewpoint,
including the economic one, and the ny difficulties in any attempt to give

any help--I of course tried to activate the matter of. her trip, went at it

in a direct manner, and arrangements were made right away. She did not

want to go. First of all he was very interested in knowing how the aitusition
would come out here and what I vould propose on my retarn, ete. In addition
she waa very concerned about the health and the morale of comrade Rolando.
So she did not want to go, and I had a rathef hard tine persuading her.

At last I eueceédods I- shoved her that in any event Polando in my opinion
would have to devote som tine to his troataent. Waother this wae dans in
Cuda, or Mexico, or Czechoslovakia, oho would be in a position to accompany
hinywhon ho loft he of course would be notified in Havana, and [from there)
he could get in touch.

In any event, if comrade Rolando decides to go via Mexico, I want to
give hin my telophona number 90 he can locate me right svay. He can uso

tho none Rolando. My number 19 23.07 92, Ho will find m thutup to 1000

tn tho fantliar form ["t6"],a9 an old friend who has case in fran the

provinces, Ttion I shall look for hin and try to find a way to solve the :
problens he may have. : i

As to this matter of Rolando's health I think it 19 very iaportent feet
to discard the "thoory® that it 1s nothing serious, ete., which he hinself
Je spreading about, I do not think this situation can be allowed to remain
indefinitely, with him in poor hoalth, I have talind about this to the
comrades in tho POT here, although {t looks as though hey are not very fond
of hin for tho time being--and of course that makes eonso--and they have
pronizad to take care of the matter. have also asked Comandante Adan
as commander-in-chief to do somthing about th problem, I think it
would be useful, do you not? (phrase blurred).

Well, that is allfor the time bding. I hopo your meeting will be
successfil, T hope that the diff teulties will be overcomo, and that this
eituation will bo taken advantage of to reshape all things and to give new
drive to the struggle. I think the experiencas acquired can be very
uweful—for instance the experience hare of Comandante Adan and the boys
with tho peasants and the plen to organise them and occupy lands, I
think 4t can be developed into ever more perfect forms. Of course that
directive of occupying lands, given here in practice, 19 a provocation which
can result in the peasants! being massacred, but when it ip done in a
planned manner, in a way that the guerrilla can offer then protection and
in which they ean be taught to protect themselves, as in the caso that has
happened hore-aI think it can be a firaterate revolutionary factor.

T think you ought to give special attention to these things—and
bbove all elve is the problem of unity, If on tho one hand you do mot feel

you afe.in possession of the truth but on the other hand you do not feel you
are victins of the poscessors of the truth--I say this for comrade Rolardo<=
I.think you can accomplish 4 great change in the outlook and give a great
push to the struggle, You have to know, be aware of, have a clear ides that
the situation io the FOT 1s at this tine rather good. A nuaber of factors
have contrituted to this, including, for example, people who are attecked

‘in Revulucton Social ista,.such as the PUR. The PUR has hed a very clear and

Woll-defined attitude, very positive, consisting in declaring to the POT that
they wore for unity at all tines, but on the basis of ite boing real unity;
that 49, on the basis that they would, in every way possible, continue

collaborating with the guerrillas at every moment. I think that in the base

organizations of the POT this attitude hag been brought forth,

So, there 16 nowhere that I can wee any real reasen for a break nor the
desire for a troak on the part of anyboty. The problems that havo case up
can bo discussed as botwnen equals, clesrly, and they can bo a positive
factor, becom a positive factor of inpotua fur te otruggle, eliminating
everything that io a burden or an error or a provocation,

I am ponding 2 cordial greeting to both, those I imow well as a result
of oral expresetons and recorded tapea--this employment of tape recorders
dnextrensly useful—end when I would have liked very auch to hug personally.

So long. i

That is all wo got.ae thoir reply. So in effect thoy refuse to attend

the mooting of the aubstitute coumand but want @ meoting of the titular
comand, In-that regard, the (several words) a mating to (take up) the
points, this note must be answered, The line that we conclude fran this
ie the same line that they, have tried to follow, that everything has been
dono by a onall group, which 1s the group that is in the fetty], that 18
directly with (Rudy}, and thes/haa "ata jointed”, as they put 4t, all
functioning 6f {Words}. But’ now with the conversation held by comrade
Adan the whole thing haa been clarified and we are strong once more.
In any ovent we have not failed to {ask them), including [oeveral words]
with comrade [Luz], ao that in case of a meeting (they) would attend,
Wo aro ready to attend any meeting to which wo are called; [we have)
called them three times, and they have failed to attend in all threo cases.
Therofore we propose thet this remain the way it 4a until we have mt
there, since [phrase].

Thess are tha enly «~~ the latest nows; this courfor has to leave.
Before we close I shall save up some of the tapy for a message comrade
Jenaro hag asked to be allowd to record, Since I have been working on this

he came over and wanta to send a greeting. So we shall listen to comrads

Jenaro.

Cn more thing befors Jensro'o message, In the ovent you wish to
reply to the memorandum gent by (Juan Chacoa), there will no objection on
our pert, We are at your service there, although (soveral words) tho
cagtrete etatexant of opinion that (several wads), what they are trying
to do 1s (leave) us alons to sce whether wo aro capable or incapable of

continuing. They imagine that wo going to be unable to got out even a

looking for them, With thase tactics of delay and of not attending the
mootings they are trying to pressure us, to sve --= to make us feel,
they think, the need we have of thon,

That is not the way the fovolution 1s carried onj that is not the
way the process can be advanced, But this we shall discuss up there.
However, any decisien you up there may wnt to make after discussion will
be acceded to and respected by us. :

Again I sey farewell, with a.fratemal, combative greoting to comrades
Adan, Mateo, Marinero, [Sosa], and all the others who aro there. Forward,

POR VICTOR RICO GALAN

En un edhtorial recente, Biompre
censuré con energia la conducta
de nuestras autoridades policiacas
nel aeropuerto, por los malos tra-
tos y las vejacnones a que son 50
metidos los viajeros procedentes
de ciertos paises, sobre todo de
Cuba y de Espana. Aceptaba

intolerables .

Como por encargo, los acontecimientos posteriores han
venido a darle a nuestro editorial més razén incluso de kt
que pretendia tener. E] pasado dia 7, un‘norteamericano que
responde al nombre de Henry Agiieros Garoés, lanzé una

granada de mano contra los talleres del periédico E}-Dia;
con intenciones verdadoramente siniestras: la granada‘fue
lanzada en un lugar tal, que sélo la répida intervencién do
los trabajadores del diario pudo evitar una catéstrofe de
incalculables proporciones, de la que no estarla excluida
Ja pérdida de muchas vidas humanas, tanto en el edilica
del periédico, como en la zona aledafia.

No se trataba, por otra parte, de un hecho tinico ni ais-
lado. En fecha anterior, aunque reciente, el Instituto Mexi-
eamo-Ruso de Helaciones Culturales sufné una agresién
ondioga, y el arma utilizada resulté ser idéntica —segiin la
policia— « la que exploté en el patio de E! Dia. Casi simul-
téneamente fue ometrallado ol departamento que habiteba
el corresponsal de la agencia yugceslava Tanjug. y sélo
la circunstancia de encontrarse en un quinto piso salv6
la vida de bu esposa, que bafiaba a su hijita recién nacida,
pues varios proyectiles de grueso calibre entraron por las

Ademés, somes muchos los mexicanos que, por ecupar-
nos de cuesticnes politious nacionales e internaacnales con
un criterio opuesto al del Gobierno de los Estados Unidos,
recibimes un alud de amenazaz y andninas injuncsos, tan

Capturaio, no como resultado de Investigaciones po-
