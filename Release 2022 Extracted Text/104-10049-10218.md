"Cokie" ZIMERI Safie left Guatemala in August 1975 as a result
of an attack upon his, ZIMERI's, life. ZIMERI has been living
in Miami since August 1975.

Robert and Gerald Patrick HEMMING. - The 'HEMMING brothers
assisted ZIMERI in acquiring arms, among other things, which
were flown to Guatemala in a small aircraft. The report also

8. Gerald Patrick HEMMING is well known to this Agency,
the Office of Security Miami Field Office, and JMWAVE. On
numerous occasions since at least the early 1960's, HEMMING
had clai Agency ‘affiliation when in fact there has been
none, most recent incident wherein HEMMING claimed such
affiliation was in May 1975 when he volunteered his services
to the Drug Enforcement Administration. Gerald Patrick HEMMING
is a long- e cohort of Frank Anthony STURGIS (SF#353 459),
aka: Frank FIORINI, of Watergate notoriety who also has a
long-time "record of falsely claiming Agency affiliation. In

. the late 1550's HENNING and STURGIS, both former U.S. Marines,
joined Fidel CASTRO in Cuba but returned shortly thereafter
claiming disillusionment with the CASTRO cause. Soon eae
STURGIS organized a group of mercenaries for Caribbean and

. Central American activities which he named the International
Anti-Communist Brigade. A reported sub-unit of this "Brigade"
(the backers of whom have never been fully established) was
named the Intercontinental Penetration poe headed by Gerald
Patrick HEMMING.

9. For an appreciation of the possible ramifications of -
a Guatemalan government expose of this assassination plot
involving HEMMING, you are referred to attachments to instant
memorandum, to wit: a memorandum by the writer dated 10 June
1975 in the name of Frank STURGIS and Everett Howard HUNT, Jr.;
and an'extract from a book published in early 1976 written by
Michael. CANFIELD and Alan J, WEBERMAN. The book Coup d'etat
in America--The CIA and the Assassination of John F. Kenne
Is a diatribe against the Agency and attempts to link the Agency
with the assassination of..President KENNEDY. One of the najor
links attempted by the authors is through Everett Howard HUNT,”
Jr. to Frank STURGIS to Gerald Patrick HEMMING to Loran Eugene
HALL. Loran Eugene HALL was a member of HEMMING's Interconti-
nental Penetration Force. Loran Eugene HALL received nationwide
publicity in 1967 when. New Orleans District Attorney "Jim"
GARRISON alleged that HALL (and the Intercontinental Penetration
Force) was involved in the assassination of President KENNEDY
and that members of this unit were connected with CIA, GARRISON
shortly thereafter dropped his interest in HALL, but it is
interesting that he did so after Gerald Patrick HEMMING and
another cohort, Robert K. BROWN, ined GARRISCN's investigation.
