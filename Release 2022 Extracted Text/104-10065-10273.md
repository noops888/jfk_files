" Dear Mr. Fauntroy,

I-read in yesterday's Washington Post that you believe it
possible that some U.S. journalists are in fact CIA agents and -
engaged in a conspiracy to frustrate the work of your House
Assassinations Committee. : :

Let me assure you that there are no working U.S. journalists .
employed by the Central Intelligence Agency.

. Let me further assure you in the most unequivocal terms
that I will not. tolerate any actions by any members of the Central
Intelligence Agency to impede your investigation. On the contrary, ~
you will have our most complete cooperation. Please advise me
personally if there is any way in which you feel this is not being

done.
Yours sincerely,
