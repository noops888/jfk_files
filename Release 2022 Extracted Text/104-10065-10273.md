25 APR 1977

The Honorable Walter E. Fauntroy

United States House of Representatives

Washington, D.C. 20515

Dear Mr. Fauntroy,

I read in yesterday's Washington Post that you believe it

possible that some U.S. journalists are in fact CIA agents and

engaged in a conspiracy to frustrate the work of your House

Assassinations CommitteeÂ®

Let me assure you that there are no working U.S. journalists

employed by the Central Intelligence Agency.

Let me further assure you in the most unequivocal terms

that I will not tolerate any actions by any members of the Central

Intelligence Agency to impede your investigation.

On the contrary,

you will have our most complete cooperation. Please advise me

personally if there is any way in which

you feel this is not being

done.

Yours sincerely,

/s/ Stansfield Turnez

STANSFIELD TURNER

Admiral, U.S. Navy
