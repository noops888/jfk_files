Service until April 1964.

Although there are many members of the Direccion General de
Inteligencia (General Directorate of Intelligence + DGI) who
appear interested in and favorable toward:the Communist ‘Part
Scurce knows cf cnly three persons who are actually members:
Saul GONZALEZ, alias"Denis"; Manuel VEGA Perez, alias "Marcos
Viera"; and Felix SUAREZ, alias "Federico Santiestcban",
SUAREZ wis a sert cf pelitical adviser in the DGI operations
departments, but insisted he was not a commissar, but, rather,
a person in charge. Although Source and the other officers
would tease SUAREZ by calling him "Comisario", SUAREZ greatly
resented the term and actually physically attacked Source for
doing so, Every Saturday morning at 8:30, SUAREZ held a
political indoctrination meeting which’ all personnel were
supposed te attend Scurce was habitually latte to these ,
sessions, and althcugh he was given penalties for his obvious
disaffection, he never paid any attention to them. The DGT
personnel Source knew were perfectly willing to talk politics
among themselves but in a rather desuJtory way; the discussions
never went on very long.

the real loyalty was to Fidel CASTRO rather than to the Party.
