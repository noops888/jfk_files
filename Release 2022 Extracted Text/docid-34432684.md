Soviet dominated aren since communications from BLOBODA to HIS wife
Feflect that it is HI6 intention to have HIS wife join HIM, As late as 16
September 1960, HE attempted to contact her by phone from Moscow,
Although movement ef SLOBODA's wife and children into Soviet ar¢a
would not be of special interest in the complaint type investigation of
SUBJECT, it would appear to be of interest to the Government of the
United States to be able to pracluds movement of the two minor, US
citinens into Soviet controlled area. Knowledge of communications
between Mrs, Sloboda and SUBJECT would assist in taking action deemed
appropriate,

(; ane Sloboda concealed the following knowledge pertinent
to HIS defection;

al) Knowledge of HIS location, At 0810 hours, 4 Aug 1960,
abe told one source HE was in Berlin. HIS defection did not become offic-
ially known uatil 6 Aug 1960, prior to that time, HE was considered AWOL.

ca) knowledge of HIS route used ia defecting, Prior to cur
soparate determination (without her cooperation), she kaew that HIS car was
located at the KORLN airport. :

not through her cooperation, but through exploiting information which she-
inadvertently let slip or which was obtained through other investigation.
