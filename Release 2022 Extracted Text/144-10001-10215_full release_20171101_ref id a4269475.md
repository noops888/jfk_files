Attention: 232

Mr. Charles Sullivan

Fort George G. Meade, MD 20755

Dear Mr. Sullivan:

October 2, 1981

Thank you for your letter of September 25

regarding my FOIPA request of September 8.

Under the provisions of the FOIPA, I would

like to reformulate and renew my request, and provide

some additional information that may perhaps assist you

in locating the material I requested.

While your letter

stated that a thorough search had failed to locate any

information pertaining to my request, I tend to believe

that the material I am requesting has somehow been

In Figadle Lat

that

Since my request was very broadly worded,

and since your letter made no reference to claiming

any exemptions, I gather that you were simply unable

to find any material in NSA files pertaining to my

request.

210.A81

Yet, let me reiterate that I believe such

material must exist somewhere within your agency. I can

specifically state of my own knowledge that in a letter

of October 7, 1980 to Congressman Louis Stokes (the former

Chairman of the House Select Committee on Assassinations,

Robert L. Keuch (the Special Counsel to the Attorney General

and an assistant Attorney General) wrote that in late 1979

the Department of Justice did in fact request NSA advice and

assistance in regard to the House Committee's acoustical

evidence relating to the President's murder.

Mr. Keuch's

letter to Congressman Stokes specifically stated that

NSA was

"asked to assist in a review of acoustics reports

relevant to the Kennedy assassination." The Special Counsel

to the Attorney General went on to write that "NSA informed

the Department that they did not possess the specialized

equipment or expert personnel to assist in such a review."

Thus, it seems apparant that NSA was in fact

consulted by the Department of Justice, and that NSA's

technical personnel did in fact review

the request and

reach a determination that they were not qualified to

become substantively involved in analyzing the acoustical

evidence.

Thus, I gather that there must in fact be a

certain amount of file material or documents within your

agency pertaining to the Department's request and its

handling by NSA.

That is the material that 1 am again

hereby requesting.

In renewing and reformulatine

this request,

I am specifically requesting

that l1I you have not

already done so) you check with your agency's liaisons

to the Department of Justice and House of Representatives

(including former liaison to the Select Committee on

Assassinations) to see if they can assist in locating

the material I am requesting.

Perhaps that is where

the paperwork on this matter would be located.

Let me also apologize if I seem to be

badgering you on this request, but it seems to me

that there must in fact be some material responsive

to my request that exists within the agency.

And I'm

sure you can understand the importance that

those of

us who worked on the House Committee attach to obtaining

and reviewing as much information as we can obtain regarding

the acoustical evidence that we believe establishes a high

probability that two gunmen did in fact fire at the President

on November 22, 1963.

Thank you again for your assistance.

Sincerely,

hing

Attention: 232

Mr. Charles Sullivan

Fort George C. Meade, MD 20755

Dear Sirs:

September 8, 1981

Under the provisions of the Freedom of

Information and Privacy Act,

as amended, I am requesting

copies of some files of the

NSA.

Specifically, I am requesting copies of any

and all file material - anything the NSA has in its

possession - relating to any work or review conducted

by NSA in response to the Department of Justice's

request for assistance in 1979 regarding the acoustical

evidence on the assassination of President Kennedy

set forth by the House Select Committee on Assassinations.

I am a former staff member of the John F.

Kennedy Task Force of the Select Committee.

It is

my understanding that the Department of Justice

requested NSA to review the acoustical evidence relating

to the President's assassination, and make recommendations

as to whether NSA could perform any additional work on

this material. I believe this occurred in the fall of 1979.

In any event, I am requesting copies of any and

all file material or other material that NSA has relating

to this proposed acoustical work, as well as any additional

information it may possess regarding the Kennedy assassination

acoustical evidence.

While it is my understanding that NSA declined

to become involved in handling the acoustical evidence,

I am requesting copies of all material relating to this

request from the Department and the NSA's handling of it.

handline of it.

In accordance with the provisions of the FOIPA

law, I shall expect an initial response to this request

within ten working days after you have received it.

Thank you for your assistance.

Sincerely,

Michael
