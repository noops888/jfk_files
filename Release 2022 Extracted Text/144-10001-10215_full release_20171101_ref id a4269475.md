Dear Mr. Sullivan: : ye :
l Biel
Thank you for your letter of September 25 ae zl
regarding my FOIPA request of September 8. : Caw”

Under the provisions of the FOIPA, I would

a
like to reformulate and renew my request, and provide 0 ole
ane

some additional information that may perhaps assist you

in locating the material I.requested. While your letter wen
stated that a thorough search had failed to locate any elite Lace
information pertaining to my request, I tend to believe we
that the material I am requesting has somehow been ghet
overlooked during your search. waa A

Since my request was very broadly worded, eo
and since your letter made no reference to claiming eps
any exemptions, I gather that you were simply unable AY!
to find any material in NSA files pertaining to my 210
request.

Yet, let me reiterate that I believe such
material must -exist somewhere within your agency. I can
specifically state of my own knowledge that in a letter
of October 7, 1980 to Congressman Louis Stokes (the former
Chairman of the House Select Committee on Assassinations),
Robert L. Keuch (the Special Counsel to the Attorney General
and an assistant Attorney General) wrote that in late 1979
the Department of Justice did in fact request NSA advice and
assistance in regard to the House Committee's acoustical
evidence relating to the President's murder. Mr. Keuch’s
letter to Congressman Stokes specifically stated that
NSA’ was "asked to assist in a review of acoustics reports
relevant to the Kennedy assassination." The Special Counsel
to the Attorney General went on to write that "NSA informed
the Department that they did not possess the specialized
equipment or expert personnel to assist in such a review."

Thus, it seems apparant that NSA was in fact
consulted by the Department of Justice, and that NSA's
technical personnel did in fact review the request and
reach a determination.that they were not qualified to
become substantively involved in analyzing the acoustical
evidence. Thus, I gather that there must in fact be a
certain amount of file material or documents within your
agency pertaining to the Department’s request and its
handling by NSA. That is the material thet I am again
hereby requesting.

In renewing and reformulating this request,
I am specifically requesting that (if you have not
already done so) you check with your agency's liaisons
to the Department of Justice and House of Representatives
(including former liaison to the Select Committee on
Assassinations) to see if they can assist in locating
the material I am requesting. Perhaps that is where
the paperwork on this matter would be located,

Let me also apologize if I seem to be
badgering you on this request, but it seems to- me
that there must in fact be some material responsive
to my request that exists within the agency. And I'm
sure you can understand the importance that those of
us who worked on the House Committee attach to obtaining
and reviewing as much information as we can obtain regarding
the acoustical evidence that we believe establishes a high
probability that two gunmen did in fact fire at the President
on November 22, 1963.

Thank you again for your assistance.

Attention: Q32

Mr. Charles Sullivan

Fort George C. Meade, MD 20755

Dear Sirs:

Under the provisions of the Freedom of
Information and Privacy Act, as amended, I’ am requesting
copies of some files of the NSA.

Specifically, I am requesting copies of any
and all file material - anything the NSA has in its
possession ~ relating to any work or review conducted
by NSA in response to the Department of Justice's
request for assistance in 1979 regarding the acoustical
evidence on the assassination of President Kennedy
set forth by the House Select Committee on Assassinations.

I ama former staff member of the John F.
Kennedy Task Force of the Select Committee. It is
my understanding that the Department of Justice
requested NSA to review the acoustical evidence relating
to the President's assassination, and make recommendations
as to whether NSA could perform any additional work on
this material. I believe this occurred in the fall of 1979,

In any event, I am requesting copies of any and
all file material or other material that NSA has relating
to this proposed acoustical work, as well as any additional

information it may possess regarding the Kennedy assassination
acousstical evidence.

While it is my understanding that NSA declined
to become involved in handling the acoustical evidence,
I am requesting copies of all material relating to this
request from the Department and the NSA's handling of it.

. In accordance with the provisions of the FOIPA
law, I shall expect an initial response to this request
within ten working days after you have received it.

Thank you for your assistance.

Sincerely,

Michael Ewing
