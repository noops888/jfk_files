Following is a translation of a report which source :
wrote concerning @ shipment of explosives to Mexico: 2 i

“The Communist Party of 31 Salvador had asked me to
send them tzenty-five, one quarter pound packages of © ao
. gelatin oxplosives. They requeqted that the explosives be
went to Mexico where they would recover them and take
: them to El Salvador. :

"In view of the request, I spoke w Man PINEIRO
regarding the shipment itself, as well the amount. 4
PINEIRO answered by telling me to do so. aa

“During my trip to Mexico (March 1964) I spoke with
Rogelio RODRIGUEZ Lopez regarding this shipment and he told
me that there was no need of ny sending the explosives
to Mexico as this type of explosive was available in the
Embassy. I then told RODRIGUEZ that I would answer the
request from El] Salvador.

"Upon returning to Cuba I spoke with PINEIRO, who told
we not to send the explosives as the orders now were to
send nothing but money due to the recent exposure of the
arms shipment to Venezuela."
