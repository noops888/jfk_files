keep its arms, reorganize and control the Armed

Forces of Cuba and that it be in charge of

maintaining public order.

states that CASTRO relegates the other organizations

opposed to BATISTA to await the convocation of

elections and to take part only as political partie:

when the president selected by CASTRO decides to hol

these elections: The Authentic Groups observed that

such a demand by CASTRO contained the threat of-

a permanent control of the country by force, w to
