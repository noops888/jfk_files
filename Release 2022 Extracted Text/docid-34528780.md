III, NEWSPAPER ARTICLES CONCERNING
CARLOS PRIO AND THE PARTIDO
AUTENTICO

The December 6, 1957, issue of the "New
York Times," on page fourteen, cerried an article
entitled, "Somoza Reports Prio Cuban Plot." This
article, datelined Managua, Nicarague, December 5,
1957, indicated that President LUIS ANA SOMOZA
DEBAYLE, had stated that he hac "definite information"
of a plan vor an invasion of Cvba from Nicaraguan
territory with the assistance of arms bought ii the
United States. President SOMOZA of Nicaragua
stated that this plan had been thwarted.

This news article said that President
SOMOZA charged that the plan of invasion of Cuba
was formulated by the exiled former Cuban President,
Dr. CARLOS PRIO SOCARRAS, who is now living in the
United States. The purported plan called for
launching the attack from Puerto Cabezas, a northern
Ficaraguan port on the Carribean.

NW 64954 Docld:34528780 Page 10



NY 109-43

In an interview held by President SOMOZA
on the evening of December 4, 1957, it was reported
that President SOMOZA stated that Dr. PFIO, the
President of Cuba from i948 to 1952, had "for many
years been locking for a place in Centrel America
from which t begin an attach on Cuba," President
SOMOZA was quoted as saying that Dr. PRIO had
recruited exiled Nicaraguans, Cubans, Guatemalans,
and Dominicans in order to execute his plans.

Yhis article quoted President SOMOZA
as saying, “We have definite information they had
designs on some port of Nicaragua for launching
their attack, and Puerto Cabezas_ was the last
place considered. The United States will nave to
pay more attention to Prio. He hes been able to
buy arms in the United States and distribute
them all over the place, some of them to Central
Americans."

This news articls quoted CARLOS PRIO as
saying that president SOMOZA's statement about an
invasion wes "fantastic and grotesque." PRIO
said that it was pert of a plan of President
FULGENCIO BATISTA of Cuba to have Dr. PRIO expelled
from the United States.

This news article stated that Dr. PRIO
was interviewed by telephone at his home in Miami
Beack, Florida, and that PRIO ridiculed the state-
ment made by President SOMOZA of Nicaragua. PRIO
was quoted as saying that it was preposterous
to think that anyone could invade Cuba from a
country hestile to Dr. PRIO and friendly to
President PATISTA.

The January 8, 1958, issue of "El Diario
de Nueva York," on page four, carried an article
entitled, "Authentics Accept Urrutia for the
Presidency." This article stated that the Authentic
Groups in Miami, Florida, on January 7, 1958,
announced that they had accepted the provisional
presidential candidate of the rebel chief, FIDEL
CASTRO, This article stated that Dr. MANUEL
URRUTIA had been selected by FIDEL CASTRO as his
candidate for provisional president. This article
stated further that URRUTIA was acceptable to the
Authentic Groups, which are headed in Miami,
Florida, by the ex-President of Cuba, CARLOS PRIO
SOCARRAS.

Dr. MANUEL ANTONIO DE VARONA,President of
the Authentic Party, and Dr. ENRIQUE C. HENRIQUEZ,
Head of the Authentic Organization, were quoted as
saying in a joint statement that Dr. URRUTIA,
FIDEL CASTRO's choice for provisional president,
was acceptable to them if CASTRO would withdraw
or change his demands, namely that the July 26
Movement not only designate the provisional
president but that the July 26 be permitted to
keep its arms, reorganize and control the Armed
Forces of Cuba and that it be in charge of
maintaining public order.

This joint statement of VARONA and HENRZ.QUEZ
states that CASTRO relegates the other organizations
opposed to BATISTA to await the convocation of
elections and to take part only as political parties
when the president selected by CASTRO decides to hold
these elections. The Authentic Groups observed that
such a demand by CASTRO contained the threat of-

a permanent control of the country by force, which
would be opposed to the tradition of Cuba, and to
the re-establishment of democratic institutions.

The Authentic Groups contended that the
Armed Forces of .Cuba should be re-organized and
purged of criminal elements but that the military
element should be respected in accordance with the
Constitution that all Cubens heve sworn to re-
estatlish.

In another section of this joint state-
ment, the Authentic Groups protested the fact that
FIDEL CASTRO saic the individuals representing
the July 26 Movement/ had signed the agreement to
establish the Council mr Liberation, had lacked the
authority to do so.

The Authentics stated that it was improper
and unjust to accuse such outstanding and respected
citizens as Doctors FELIPE PAZOS and RAUL CHIBsS,
PELAYC CUERVO, JR., LEST#R RODRIGUEZ, LUCAS MORAN,
MARIO LLERENA and RAUL CEPEDA of having assumed a
fradulent representation cf the July 25 Movement
in the unity pact, which had been signed curing
Cctobeg 1957.

‘his article also noted that the
Authentics deniec che statement attributed to
CASTRO that he, CASTRO, had not received any help
from the iiberation front, and the Authentics stated
that without the aid of other groups and organizations
opposed to President BATISTA, PIDEL CASTRO would
not have been able to come to Cuba on December 2,1956,

Concerning, FIDEL CASTRO, it is to be noted
that he is the Cuban rebel leader wno led an un-
successful attack on the Moncada Barracks on Jilly
26, 1953, from whence his organization has taken its
name. FIDEL CASTRO, together with eighty-two

followers left Mexico aboard the Yacht, "Gramma"
and landed in Oriente Province, Cuba, on or about
December 2, 1956. CASTRO and his followers made
their headquarters in the Sierra Maestra

from whence they have waged guerrilia warfare
against the Government of President BATISTA of
Cuba.

Department has more than once deplored the price
of such neutralism in the fight for freedom.

This editorial goes on to state that by
becoming enemies of BATISTA's enemies, we forfeit

the blow that the United States has struck against
freedom will make the tyrants in Moscow as happy
as the despot in Havana.

This editorial desired to know if there
were a leftist government in Cuba and BATTSTA was
found te be plotting against it in Florida, would the
Neutrality Act have been invoked by the United
States with such efficiency and dispatch?
