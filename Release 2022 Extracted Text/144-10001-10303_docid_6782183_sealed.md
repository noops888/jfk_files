(2-part message completé] :

A religious service ih memory! of President KENNEDY was held
yesterday afternoon if the’ church in Accra. A ‘particularly large
crowd, mostly Africays, literally; overflowed the Porticoes.
Contrary to the practice of President NKRUMAH, Who never
participates in religious-ceremonies, several members of the
government and the President of the Supreme Court of Justice were
present, Except fer the Cuban and Chinese ambassadors, the chiefs
of the diplomatic missions were in attendance, *

President NKRUMAH broadcast a message to tHe nation exalting
the personality of the late President "who will ‘be extolled in the
annals of humanity for his action against racism and his efforts
in favor of peace and human rights," :

President DE GAULLE's act of attending the Funeral in person
and the wording of his two messages to Mrs. KENNEDY and to the
new President of the Undted States impressed many of my colleagues
and members of the government , who praised the human and political
aspects of our Presiderit’ s attitude, .
