MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJBCT: Statement Prepared by AELADLE

The following statement was dictated by AELADLE On 27 December

1961. Due to technical difficultles, the transcription of blo

statement is incomplete.

"As It 18 known to you, ay decision to go over to the

West was made by me practically since back in 1955.

There-

sore, since that time I bave studied the entire activity

of aül the Soviet (intelligence) organs, life in the Sovlet

Union Iron this stundpolnt or fron this angle. I try to

think of hou, in the future, when I vould go over to the west,

bow I could belp the west in the urganizing of the cold var

against the soviet Union, against the regime that exists in

the Soviet Union and the other countries behind the Iron

curtaln.

Therefore all these juestions sere thought out by se

very carefully in a historical plane, a political plane, an

intelligence plane, and a counterintelligerce plane.

Now

that this step has already been taken by me, I have been ex-

pecting that your important people, people of authority in

your authoritative organizations.

the nost, authoritative 1n

the country, vill give du: consideration to my proposale and

'myBell.

I have been expecting that right from the beginning

thie whole thing will. be considered political haste. The

leaders of your country, after they becode convinced that I

made this step on the basie of most sincere cunvictions and

this I have proven by, for example, by giving all the inforuation

concerning finland, --I thorght that after that 1t vill be

of great interest to leaders of your country to hear be out

on the basic quaations concerning things that are taking

place in the Sovlet Union, on questiona which represent the

threat to the Western countries from the Soviet Unlon Lnd

otter countries seniri ile irun üurtnin. Un these subjecte

whien i personally may be uf help in tbe future, I thought

that this case would be of seat interest to the presideãt.

thought that the most sorious attention will be gaven to tbla

whole affalr.

I thought that right after the step that I took,

they vould bold a seeting of the National Security Council,

during which I vould be abla to report to the members of this

Council on all the political and otber activitles. I expected

that I vould be gaten the possibility of appearing before se

Rational Security Council, and to repor, to tbe organ which 18

concerned with tbe security of the U. S. A., what 18 being dose

along the line of intelligence, at least of Intelligence agalast

the United States and other denocrablo countries, 1n uider that

the people respondible for the security of the Unitod States

vould at last understand what a great danger the Sorlet Unlo!

represents; the great danger that the Sovlet Union represents

to the United States and to the lest as a bole because I an

certain, that uba: I knuv, what I could report 18 of great

Interest as far as the organization,

the measures that have to

De taken and the struggle againat this danger are concerned.

secondly, I thought that my defection to the West, my plans

concerning uy belp to the lest in organizing a strusgle againa:

the sordet systes, against Sovlet Intelligence, againat the

sortet Pallce, yould be of great interest tu otber desocratic

countries ruch as Bagland, France, Hest Geranny and Others. I

tbought that the President vould f1nd 1t possible to 1nv1te

for & abort counsel, the heads of govermments: of otber dero-.

cratle countries, so tist I vould also be able to report to all

of tben on what 18 being done by the Soviet Union against these

countries, as vell as against the lest as a uhole, because I

koon that on the basis of my report, it vould be possible to

take nore effestive and important counter-cassured.
