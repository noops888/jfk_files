MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
J + SUBJECT: . Statement Prepared by AELADLE

The following statement vas dictated by AELADLE on 27 December
1961. Due to technical difficulties, the transcription of his
statement is incomplete. :

"As it 18 known to you, my decision to go over to the cee
lest was made by mt: practically since back in 1955. There- 7
fore, since that time I have studied the entire activity
“of @il the Soviet (intelligence) organs, life in the Soviet
49 Union from thig standpoint or from this angle: I try to
think of hov, in the future, when I’ vould go over to the West,
bow I cculd help the West in the organizing of the cold war
Qgainst the Soviet Union, againat the regime that exists in
the Soviet Union and the other countries behind the Iron
Curtain. Therefore ail these ueztions vere thought out by me
“Nery carefully in a historical plane, a political plane, an
intelligence plane, and a counterintelligence plane. Now
that this step has already been taken by me, I have been ex-
Pecting that your important people, people of authority in
“your authoritative organizations, the most authoritative in
the country, will give dus consideration to ay proposals and
cmyeelf. J have been expecting that right from the beginning
thie whole thing will be considered political haste. The
leaders of your country, after they becove convinced that I
made this step on the basis of most sincere convictions and
, this I have proven by, for example, by giving all the information
Concerning Finland,--I thovght that after that it will be
, Of great interest to leaders of your country to hear ne out
on the basic questions concerning thingé that are taking
», Place in the Soviet Union, on questions which represent the
threat to the Western countries from the Soviet Union nad
otter countries behing the Irun Curtain. On these subjects
which I peraonaily may be of help in the future, I thought
> that this case would be of great interest to the President. T

i
that the most serious attention will be given to this i
whole affair. I thought that right after the step that I took, i
thay vould bold a seeting of the National Security Council, H
during vhieh I vould be able to report to the members of this i .
Council on @ll the political and other activities. I expected i :
that I vould be given the possibility of appearing before =e wl
Rational Security Council, and to report to the organ vhich is “4
concerned with the security of the U. S. A., what is being done
along the line of intelligence, at least of intelligence against H
the United States ani other democratic countries, in order that ian
the people responsible for the security of the United States
would at last understand what a great danger the Soviet Unicy
represents; the great danger that tbe Soviet Union represents
to the United States and to the West as a whole because I am
certain, that vba. I knov, vhat I could report is of great
interest as far es the organization, the measures that have to
de token and the struggle agtinst this danger are concerned.
Secondly, I thought that my defection to the West, my plans
concerning uy help to the West in organizing @ struggle agains?
the Soviet systes, against Soviet Intelligence, against the
Boviet Police, would be of great interest tu other democratic
<. gountries such as England, France, West Germany and Others. I
“"hought thet the President would find it possible to invite
for «short counsel, the heads of governments:of otber demo-
“ eratie countries, so-tiat I-vould also be able to report to all
| of them on what is being done by the Soviet Union against these
countries, as vell as against the West as a whcle, because I
Know that on the basis of my report, it would be possible to
take more effective and important counter-messure:
