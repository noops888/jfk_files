MEMORANDUM FOR

SUBJECT

: Deputy Director for Support.

: The Militants: An Up-date on the

Black Power Threat

1. This memorandum is for information only.

2. By memorandum entitled "Threat to CIA by Some

Black Power Elements, " dated i1 December 1967, I advised you of

the results of inquiries with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and

the review of existing materials in the Office of Security concerning

militant "Black Power" organizations and personalities. I specifi-

cally noted those groups and personalities which have expressed

hostility against this Agency and its operations.

3. Since that time additional significant information has

been received which reflects increased activity on the part of the

militants, coupled with threats for what they have termed "The Bloody

Summer. " Although the ranks of the extremists are still proportion-

ately small, their threats of violence must be given greater weight

than might normally be attributed to their small percentage of the U.S.

Negro population. A review of these recent developments is attached

for your information.

4. In addition to the new information on the extreme mili-

tants, we have also noted two scheduled developments for the months

of April and May which will be of interest to you. They are:

a.:

Beginning on 22 April 1968, Dr. Martin Luther

King, Jr., and his Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC)

Will Initiate their "Poor People's Campaign" in Washington, D. C.

On that day, Dr. King has indicated be will lead "waves of the nation's

poor and disinherited" into the city for prolonged, disruptive and "non-

violent" demonstrations to demand government action for "jobs or in-

come for all. " He has indicated that bis initial cadre of up to 3, 000

volunteers will remain in the nation's capital "until America responds."

In what Di. King calls the "last resort for nonviolence, " SCLC re-

portedly plans lobbying and other action against the Capitol, a shut-down

of all government buildings, transportation tie-ups and school boycotts.

It bas been threatened that if troops are used to quell these actions, DI.

King will call for demonstrations in other key cities of the nation..

As

the campaign escalates, SCLC has indicated it will call in peace groups

to strengthen the program.

Significantly, Dr. King's campaign will begin early

in the announced "International Days of Protest, " 21-30 April 1968,

sponsored by the National Mobilization Committee to End the War in

Vietnam, a group in which Dr. King, Mrs. King, and Rev. James Bevel,

a King aide, have been particularly active. The National Mobilization

Committee is known to include members of the. Communist Party, USA,

and other subversive groups.

Present plans for the ten-day Vietnam

protest call for local and regional demonstrations and concentrated

organizing efforts around the country, as well as coordinated protests :

abroad. As part of the campaign, the Student Mobilization Committee to .:

End the War in Vietnam, Students for a Democratic Society, and SNCC's -

Black Anti-war Anti-Draft Union have issued a call for a national

student 'strike for peace in Vietnam and against racism at home and

abroad, " 26 April. On 27 April the sponsors have called for a unified

demonstration of the full force of the movement with organized protests

and marches in major U.S. cities.

Spearheading the Washington campaign is Rev.

Bernard Lafayette, JI., 27, a member of the civil rights movement

since he was a teen-ager. He was an original member of the Nashville,

Tennessee, student movement in 1960 and participated in the much-

publicized "Freedom Rides." As field secretary for the Student Non-

violent Coordinating. Committee, he led voter registration and commu-

nity organizing campaigns in Mississippi and Alabama. His most recent

work has been with the American Friends Service Committee in Chicago

and as director of the Neighborhood Service Project in the Roxbury

section of Boston.

Joining Lafayette in coordinating the Washington

protests is the Rev. James Bevel, who reportedly will direct the "non-

violence" during the campaign. Bevel, it will be recalled, was released

from his duties with the SCLC more than a year ago to become National

BIBB

Director of the aforementioned National Mobilization to End the War

in Vietnam, the united front organization which includes a broad

grouping of organizations of diverse political philosophies, including

Communist, Socialist, pacifist and civil rights. It was this organiza-

tion which sponsored the 15 April 1967 demonstrations in New York

City and San Francisco and the Pentagon protests of 21 October 1967.

Politically, Bevel has leaned far to the Left. He has vigorously prò-

tested U.S. policy in Vietnam and has called the President a murderer.

Although not specifically declaring himself to be a member of the

Communist Party, he stated on 5 March 1966, in reply to a question

about Communist Party membership, that "every thinking American

should be. " He has also stated: "We here will decide what the Govern-

ment will be when we take over." His wife, also active in the Vietnam

protest movement, was one of the "peace ladies" who met with North

Vietnamese and Viet Cong representatives in Southeast Asia in 1966.

Despite Dr. King's statements the Washington

protests are for "jobs or income for all, " there can be little doubt

the activity will be closely interlinked with the "peace" movement,

particularly at the stage when "peace" groups are formally invited in

as the activity escalates. The FBI has noted that Dr. King has shown

not only a willingness, but even an eagerness to accept Communist aid,

to support Communist causes, to confer with high-ranking Communist

functionaries, and to rely heavily upon the advice and direction of

dedicated Communists with concealed affiliation. It notes, specifically,

that one of these Communist advisors wrote King's vicious denunciation

of U.S. policy in Vietnam which he delivered before the 15 April 1967

rally held in New York City by Bevel's National Mobilization Committee

to End the War in Vietnam (then called the Spring Mobilization Com-

mittee). According to the FBI, Dr. King is regarded in Communist

circles as "a genuine Marxist-Leninist who is following the Marxist-

Leninist line. "

b. Close on the heels of the initiation of Di. King's

Washington campaign, and possibly well-timed with the proposed formal

call for participation by "peace" groups as that campaign escalates, are

the "National Days for Black Unity Against the War in Vietnam, 19-20

May 1968. " Sponsored by the Peking-line Progressive Labor Party

and certain to attract the more militant factions, the protest calls for

nationwide demonstrations "against the war in Vietnam and slum land-

lords. "' The announced highpoint of the protests is a day of widespread

work stoppage and demonstrations on campuses and in cities through-

out the United States, tentatively set for 19 May. A potential for

disturbance exists since the Maoist sponsors will have had almost a

month to observe and assess the effects of Dr. King's Washington

campaign.

5. I will continue to keep you advised on significant develop-

ments in this area as they come to our attention. You will be pleased

to know FBI liaison has been most cooperative and effective in providing

this office with timely information about the various domestic militants

and protest groups.

In connection with another matter, a source of this office talked

to Mr. Jay Richard KENNEDY at his residence, New York City, on 13 July

(Various topics were covered during the interview and have been

reported under separate memoranda.) Following are Mr. KENNEDY's comments.

(not verbatim) concerning James FARMER of CORE which Mr. KENNEDY indicated

should be forwarded in part to the President. In this connection, it should

be noted that the source made it specifically clear to Mr. KENNEDY that he

nad no access to the white House

or any channel to the White House, but

that he would report Mr. KENNEDY's comments in his usual channel into his

own particular office within the Agency.

Mr. KENNEDY pointed out that James FARMER, who is head of CORE, is

the number one target of the Maoist Communists and that by target Mr.;

KENNEDY specifically meant that FARMER either had to be assassinated or

"engulfed"

and taken over by the Peking-line Communists. (Mr. KENNEDY; stated

that this was obvious since FARMER is the only known non-violence advocate

who is an outstanding anti-Communist and the foremost negro leader who

commands a national following. Mr. KENNEDY stated Martin Luther KING has

already shown his hand by attacking the Administration and advocating a

pull-out in Vietnam (KENNEDY insists that KING is compromised by his moral

background and is probably controlled by Peking-line Communists); A. Phillip

RANDOLPH is out of the United States and is very inactive; Harry BELAFONTE,.

of course, is a Communist and undoubtedly Peking controlled; and Whitney

YOUNG and

Roy WILKINS have no popular grass-roots type of following.

(Mr. KENNEDY stated that the effort to "get" FARMER was obvious in

an anti-Administration "pull-out of Vietnam" line. (Mc. KENNEDY stated ob-

viously this was Peking-line inspired and the remarkable about-face that

FARMER forced on the convention not only showed FARMER's control and:

courage, but very clearly targeted him to the Peking-line Communists. Mr.

KENNEDY pointed out it must be remembered that while the convention was

going on, Martin Luther KING issued a public statement denouncing U. S.

policy and advocating pulling out of Vietnam.

white woman, had called Mr. KENNEDY from Durham and that Mr. KENNEDY had,

in addition to offering advice, offered to come to Durham at that time. 'Mr.'

KENNEDY commented he cannot state the exact effect his talk with Mrs.

FARMER had (which is apparently unknown to James FARMER), but it was ob-

vious that FARMER's reversing the CORE convention stand followed in the wake

of this telephone call. Further, according to Mr. KENNEDY, FARMER, immedi-

ately upon arriving in

New York from Durham, called Mr. KENNEDY.

Subsequently, according to Mr: KENNEDY, he has talked with FARMER

both before his trip to Bogalusa, Louisiana, and after his return. 'Mr.

KENNEDY stated that he had asked FARMER about the situation in Louisiana

and FARMER had explained his views in the following manner which is the basis

for the KENNEDY recommendation of passing the information to the White House.

FARMER stated that his problem in Bogalusa and also in other places in the

South is the fact that the poor negro families, most of whom reside in

isolated areas of country surrounding the towns, are subject to terror and

intimidation by bands of white extremists who threaten and actually commit

bodily harm on these negro people. Furthermore, these people have no means

of transportation and to try to get them to come into town to register as

voters, facing the difficulties of intimidation and lack of transportation,

is a major problem. According to FARMER, there has been no help for these

people until the advent of the so-called Deacons and that the Deacons have

offered assistance and more importantly physical protection. FARMER stated

that when these people turned to him and asked "What can we do?"

, FARMER

had no real answer. According to Mr. KENNEDY, he asked FARMER why didn't-

he appeal to the President personally since FARMER does have access to the

White House, and FARMER stated that he could not do this now. (Mr. KENNEDY:

asked him why he could not and FARMER explained that if he publicly appealed

to the President after forcing the CORE convention to reverse its stand on

Vietnam,

it would look like a

"deal" and that he, FARMER, could be dis-

credited because of this. Mr. KENNEDY asked FARMER what

type of appeal

should be made to the White House and FARMER, in substance, replied that

if the White House were to send in either federal troops or federal marshals

to protect the negro voters then he, FARMER, could handle the Deacons. / Mr.

KENNEDY asked FARMER if he knew the leadership of the Deacons and named

Ernest THOMAS and "Val" SIMS.

these individuals and when asked by Mr. KENNEDY about how many Deacons there

were, FARMER stated that all told they had estimated about 10,000. (Mr.

KENNEDY then said how could you handle the Deacons assuming that you had

federal troops or marshals to help. According to Mr. KENNEDY, FARMER stated

that he would tell the Deacons and their leaders to "cool it"

this point.

According to Mr. KENNEDY, FARMER is somewhat naive politically and

although Mr. KENNEDY has tried to explain to him the Maoist tactics, FARMER

does not as yet fully comprehend them. (Mr. KENNEDY stated it is perfectly

obvious that behind the Deacons is a strong organization force of hard

core Peking-line Communists.

Mr. KENNEDY further stated that the Communists

are provoking violence and also quite obviously they are provoking violence

in an area where CORE is active. Also it was clearly apparent that they

worked against FARMER at the national CORE convention at Durham, North

Carolina.

Mr. KENNEDY stated that there is a facade of legitimate, harassed

negroes who are honestly trying to protect other negroes (and themselves)

by defending them by physical means and that these negroes are being duped

and pushed into violence by the Communists. They, of course, do not under-

stand this. Mr. KENNEDY further said that FARMER, himself, does not

directly understand although he may have learned a rude lesson at the

Durham, North Carolina, convention where he was nearly kicked out of his

leadership. In addition, Mr. KENNEDY stated that if the negroes got federal

support and FARMER stopped the Deacons movement, this would leave the hard

core Communists behind the Deacons exposed and vulnerable.

(Mr. KENNEDY stated that it is his intention to meet with FARMER as

soon as possible and go over again with him the matter of the Deacons and

the left-wing political maneuvers behind the Deacons.

SUBJECT:

Telephone Conversations with Jay Richard KENNEDY,

5 July and 6 July 1965

1. Set out following is a very brief summary of Mr. KEN-

NEDY's views and comments of recent events, particularly in the civil

rights area.

2. MI. KENNEDY, in the first conversation which was on

5 July, stated that his study of the activities of the various leaders in

the civil rights movement and the positions taken by the various groups

. =

have forced him to the conclusion that there is an almost complete split

in the civil rights movement and that those groups which are militant

and advocating violent action have been captured by the Peking-line Com-

munists. He stated that there is a great deal of information which would

support this contention. Along this line, it is particularly interesting to

note that the Secretary of State, Mr. Rusk, commented that Hanoi had

Along this is k,

spurned the peace efforts of the United States which, according to KEN-

NEDY, shows how contemptuous the Peking-line is of us and, of course,

is reflected in the anti-United States policy attacks of the action groups in

the civil rights movement. KENNEDY pointed out that Martin Luther

KING was now linking the civil rights movement to attacks on our policy

in Vietnam and that others were following this trend.

3. Mr. KENNEDY stated that a few days back James FARMER,

head of CORE, had denounced men appearing in CORE picket lines who

were armed; but KENNEDY stated that FARMER had not followed up this

protest and had not moved strongly after he had made this attack.

4. He stated that all of the Negro groups have a wing that

want; militant action and that these groups are subject to or soon will be

subject to Peking direction and domination.

5. Mr. KENNEDY concluded this long conversation by stating

that at the present moment, it is a certain conclusion that the Peking-line

Communists have achieved a "fifth column" in the United States and that

this will be used not only to disrupt and attempt to capture the civil rights

movement, but will be used as a weapon to attack U.S. policy in South

Vietnam, the Dominican Republic and wherever the Peking-line Commu-

nists direct.

6. On 6 July Mr. KENNEDY called and pointed out that FARM-

ER had apparently suddenly moved in a bid to become the top negro leader

in the United States who champions non-violence and anti- Communism.

(KENNEDY stated, that with Martin Luther KING moving toward the Peking-

line and splitting the civil rights movement between militants and activists

and the non-violent groups, FARMER's stand at the CORE convention in

Durham, North Carolina, over the past few days was remarkable. KEN-

(NEDY referred to the New York Times article, page 1, which very clearly

shows that FARMER had reversed a CORE stand against our government!s

activities in Vietnam and had successfully led a fight to take CORE out of

international politics and to concentrate that group in the civil rights area.

Further, according to KENNEDY, it should be noted that FARMER went

solidly against such so-called self-defense organizations as the "Deacons".

7. When asked to explain what finally produced this strong

change on FARMER's part, Mr. KENNEDY stated that there were probably

a number of factors, but certainly one of the factors had to be the fact that

Mr. FARMER is married to a woman of the white race. ' Mr. KENNEDY

also stated that possibly FARMER was beginning to realize the splitting in

the movement and had decided the time had come to take a firm position.

KENNEDY pointed out that he had been urging FARMER to do this for some

time.

8. KENNEDY stated that he had made several telephone calls

to FARMER's wife and that she had filled him in on the fight in the CORE

convention in Durham, North Carolina, which the New York Times article

covered. KENNEDY stated that it was remarkable that FARMER could

reverse an already determined position by the convention and that he could

take command of the group as he had done. KENNEDY added that this

would probably bring Allan MORRISON in line behind FARMER and would

give FARMER the benefit of the publicity of the magazines that MORRISON

directs.

: Jay Richard KENNEDY - REPORT FROM

1. Jay viewed BEILAFONTE's emceeing of the Johnny CARSON Show . -

last night. Jay said that Sidney POlTER and Livingston WINGATE at

the prompting of BEILAFONTE went into a lengthy discussion of how

Martin Luther KING obtained his money some years ago. According to

KENNEDY, BELLAFONTE is setting the stage for a future discussion of

this matter when KING appears tonight on the show.

2. KENNEDY concludes that the reason for the discussion of the

alleged source of the funds supplied to KING at this late date must be

because there has been a leak of information and all concerned realize

that probably the FBI is putting pressure on KING to disclose the true

source of the funds.

3. Jayi now speculates who leaked the information that he

supplied to us that the funds source was from the Chicoms. I assured

Jay, that no information that he passes to us is given to any source

but an official one.

war in Viet Nam, this tragic event would not have occured.

According to Jay, BELAFONTE has sufficient information

of a blackmail nature on Bobby KENNEDY that will result in KENNEDY

reacting as a puppet to Peking direction in the coming presidential

nominating campaign. KENNEDY urges that a task force be established

not by the FBI but by the intelligence community to cover BELAFONTE from

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Jay KENNEDY, Conversation with

1. The writer had a short discussion this morning with Jay

pation in the war in Vietnam.

In fact, this Declaration of Conscience goes

so far as to attempt to get Negroes to refuse to register for the draft

which is, infact, illegal activity and against Federal law.

2. In summarizing Kennedy's point of view, the problem appears

to be something like this. The Communist left is making an all out drive

to get into the Negro movement. If through any mechanism they can link

prominent Negro leaders to illegal activities and activity which is against

President Johnson's policy, this may cause a serious break between Johnson

and the Negro leadership which, in turn, may create a violent disruption

in the Negro Civil Rights Movement which would give the Communists an

opportunity to cause chaos and disruption.

Kennedy was also concerned that KING might possibly be assassinated before:

be at all helpful to the Negro movement.

how or other Martin Luther KING must be removed from the leadership

Negro movement, and his removal must come from within not from without.

Kennedy feels that somewhere in

the Negro movement, at the top, there must

be a Negro leader who is "clean" who could step into the vacuum and chaos

if Martin Luther KING were either exposed or assassinated.

BELA FONT

4. In summary, Kennedy feels that unless the Negro leaders,

other than KING, are informed and are capable of intelligent maneuvering,

the Communists

or Negro elements who will be directed by the Communists

may be in a position to, if not take over the Negro movement, completely

disrupt it and hence cause extremely critical problems for the Government

of the United States.

(Conversation with & June 1965,

Washington, D.C.)

1. On 8 June 1965, the writer met with Mr. Kennedy at the Hilton

Hotel, Washington, and had a long discussion with him beginning at approxi-

mately 1:15 and ending at 5 p.m. Mr. Kennedy's comments covered a wide

range of matters, but basically they can be broken down into 3 main topics:

(a) His attitude towards the FBI;

- ....

(6) |

His thoughts concerning the writing of a series of books

with the protagonist a CIA agent; and

(c)

Comments on the Negro Civil Rights Movement, the various

personalities connected with it, and some of (Mr. Kennedy's

opinions and theories regarding

future events connected

with the Civil Rights Movement.

workolated

Each of the above will be discussed separately.

Mr. Kennedy's attitude towards the FBI

2: Sometime back, Chief, SRS, decided that it would be advantageous

to have Mr. Kennedy give information, particularly regarding the Civil Rights

Movement, to agents of the FBI in New York City, particularly if this infor-

mation concerned domestic or local events and activities. Chief, SRS, felt

that it would be a faster means of communication than heretofore used

where-

in Mr. Kennedy communicated with SRS officers who, in turn, passed the in-.

formation to either the FBI or areas where it was useful.

3. Mr. Kennedy made it very clear that he did not wish to communi-

cate with FBI agents, that the Civil Rights Movement should be regarded as

an international situation because of the Communist directed infiltration

into the movement, and that he felt in some respects that he was being

"downgraded" by being used, as

of Government. While Mc. Kennedy did not absolutely refuse to cooperate

with the Bureau, he made it obvious that only if there was a matter which

he felt was of interest directly to the Bureau locally, would he furnish

this type of information; otherwise, he would furnish it as he has done

previously or cease altogether. The writer attempted, more or less unsuc-

cessfully, to discuss jurisdiction with Mr. Kennedy, but Mr. Kennedy main-

tained his position that the matter was not one of jurisdiction for the FBI

or any single Government agency, but was one that the Government, including

CIA, should be interested in; namely, the international Commuist efforts

at corrupting and

seizing the Negro Civil Rights Movement.

unrelated

Mr. Kennedy's thoughts regarding a possible writing of a series of noyels

aimed at improving the picture of CIA and defending this Government's actions

and the activities of the CIA in support of the Government.

4. During the long conversation, Mr. Kennedy introduced this sub-

ject by saying that he was sick and tired of the poor public picture that

was constantly being presented of the CIA by all sorts of writers, left-

wing and otherwise.

He stated that Government agents were generally painted

as fools and idiots, and that the Headquarters activities obviously were

some sort of super government who acted solely on their own and aten against

the interests of the United States.

He stated that he had read a number of

books such as "The Invisible Government"

, and this type of reporting dis-

gusted him. He stated that he had in mind the writing of a series of novels,.

using a CIA agent as hero, which would reflect decent, intelligent, and

courageous work on behalf of the United States. He stated that the James

write this type of a novel once or twice a year in addition to his serious

work-as a novelist.

'NOTE: Mr. Kennedy's latest novel is about to be published, and he was in

Washington for the American Booksellers Association Convention.

5. Mr. Kennedy stated he was certain that he could handle this type

of writing since he had demonstrated his capacity as a writer, but that he

might require certain technical assistance, particularly in terms of trade-

craft and certain fundamental matters of which he had little knowledge.

indicated that perhaps some support could be given him if it was agreed that

the idea of the novels had merit, and that support could take the shape of

area knowledge, tradecraft, terminology, and perhaps some operational

matters which were not sensitive or classified.

The writer indicated that the idea had merit and that possibly

he could be given some technical support on a covert basis. The writer

wanted to know who would publish this, or did Mr. Kennedy have in mind any

particular publisher who would publish this if Mr. Kennedy wrote it. Mr.

Kennedy stated that he was absolutely certain that his own publisher would

jump at the chance to publish this type of novel if he thought Mr. Kennedy

would write them, and Mr. Kennedy was quite willing to discuss the matter

with his publisher, quite possibly during the following evening. Mr. Kennedy

stated that he had given this matter considerable thought and because he

he could make o stestant a timit above, encouraged Mi. Kennedy but stated

but that he would like to discuss

these proposals with Chief, SRS and other associates.

8. On 9 June 1965, Mr. Kennedy, who was then leaving Washington,.

called the writer and stated that he had talked this idea over with his

publishers and they are enthusiastic about the idea since he said he would

be willing to undertake it, and that, in turn, they would bring to bear all

of their capacity for distribution of literary works. Mr. Kennedy stated

that his publisher is with the World Publishers, Inc., who are, in turn,

controlled by the Chandler interests of the west Coast. The writer again

thanked Mr. Kennedy and stated that the matter would immediately be discussed.

NOTE: It should be noted that Mr. Kennedy is a thoroughly experienced

writer with a number of books to his credit and is not given to idle con-

versation in matters such as this (see attached) •

Civil Rights Movement

9. For background information, it is to be recalled that Mr.

Kennedy has long provided information on the Negro Civil Rights Movement

and its various leaders. 'Mr. Kennedy's position is one of complete sympathy

with the Negro and the Civil Rights Movement, but holds that only through

legal means and peaceful means should the Negro aims be accomplished. Mr.

¡Kennedy, who is a violent anti-Communist, has been alarmed at the Communist

movement into the Negro Civil Rights field and the Commnist penetration into

the various Negro organizations.

He has undeniably done everything in his

capacity to help the Negro leaders, particularly James FARMER of CORE.

It is worth noting for the record that Mr. Kennedy has been involved with

various Negro leaders since as early as 1934; -and he has known a number of

the leaders, on a very close personal basis, since that time.

10. Mr. Kennedy's main concern has been that the highly derogatory

Information, of which he is familiar, concerning Martin Luther KING, Jr.,

will be exposed to the public by the wrong people and at the wrong time

mich, in Mr. Kennedy's opinior

ears and would perhaps give the one ta can toes Movement bad-

rupt it or to seize control of the movement.

11. To make certain that this report reflects as accurately as

possible the derogatory information on Martin Luther KING, Jr., here are

three main categories:

(a) Highly derogatory information on sexual abnormalities and

sexual activities which have taken place within the United

States and overseas;

. =

• (b) A possible theft of money; and

(c)

Association with identified Communist or pro-Soviet types

on an intense personal basis, particularly. Harry BELAFONTE,

the Negro actor/singer.

To further set the background, it should be recalled that several months

ago a very serious dispute erupted between Mr. John Edgar HOOVER and Martin

Luther KING, JI. At that time James FARMER, head of CORE, received infor-

mation, from an absolutely reliable source, that the FBI had derogatory in-

Iormation on Martin Luther KING, Jr., that Mr. HOOVER was incensed on attacks

on his agents and the integrity of his organization, and that grave possi-

bilities existed that Mr. HOOVER would turn loose to the public the derog-

atory information which has been presented above. In turn, FARMER gave the

information, in confidence, to Mr. Kennedy and at approximately the same

time, FARMER confronted Martin Luther KING, Jr. with the facts. It is suf-

•ficient to say that the matter was hushed up by KING visiting HOOVER.

11. With this background in mind, the writer asked Mr. Kennedy who

were the top Negro leaders that he was in contact with and what were their

relationships one to another. The writer named the following individuals,

and these were acknowledged by Mr. Kennedy as persons with whom he was

dealing:

Whitney YOUNG of the Urban League

Roy WILKINS of the NAACP

James FARMER of CORE

A. Phillip RANDOLPH, veteran Negro union leader

Allan MORRISON, top Negro editor and journalist in the

United States.

The other leaders of first magnitude that entered the discussion are Martin

Luther KING, Jr. and Harry BELAFONTE, who has been established clearly as

a close and intimate friend of Martin Luther KING, Jr. and whose left wing

background is also known. Some of the lesser Negro leaders will be mentioned

later, but those of the greater strength and opposed to KING are YOUNG,

WITKINS, FARMER, RANDOLPH, and MORRISON. Mr. Kennedy replied to the ques-

tion of rapport among these leaders by saying flatly that there was no rap-

port at all, that all mistrust and dislike the other, and in certain cases,

there was often antagonism. Mr. Kennedy stated that the brightest, shrewdest,

and cleverest of all was Roy WITKINS, but a man who had no popular or grass

roots following. He stated that Whitney YOUNG was a bright Negro, but who

had no following whatsoever in the popular sense, but was making a definite

play to gain power by seeking to be publicly connected with important

individuals both in the Government and out. Mr. Kennedy described A. Phillip

RANDOLPH as a controversial old man, possibly becoming senile, who was afraid

to act for fear of damaging his own reputation and who liked to imagine

himself as the "Moses" of the Negro race.

RANDOLPH has some popular follow-

ing, but he is aloof and has not committed himself as intensely as some of

the others. James FARMER, according to Kennedy, is probably the most sin-

cere and devoted of the leaders, but is naive and has a complete capacity

for saying the wrong thing at the wrong time. FARMER personally is clean

and he does, in fact, have the grass roots support of the large organization

CORE, which he controls., Mr.Kennedy insisted that he is law abiding, non-

violent, and a decent individual, but not too politically intelligent.

12. Mr. Kennedy stated that for weeks the problem of Martin Luther

KING, Jr. has been discussed between these leaders and that all of them are

aware of the details. (Mr. Kennedy stated that to show the range of con-

nections involved here and the sensitive nature of it, he gave the following

example.

He said that a few days ago, he was in the office of Whitney

YOUNG to discuss with him this matter.' Mr. Kennedy stated that

for the first 15 minutes or so, YOUNG was constantly being called

to the telephone and the conversation was interrupted. : Mr..

Kennedy commented that the first two calls that came in were in-

consequential, but he stated that the third call was from the

President of the United States. Mr. Kennedy stated that he

listened to two more calls then told YOUNG that either he would

have to quit accepting phone calls or Mr. Kennedy would no longer. -

discuss anything with him.

to stop the calls, and they discussed the matter. Mr. Kennedy

stated that the conversation was basically his attempting to

get Whitney YOUNG to come to some agreement with the other leaders

on the KING matter by pointing out that Roy WILKINS was in favor

of "dumping" KING, and that he, Whitney YOUNG, hadn't committed

himself to anything. Mr. Kennedy indicated that this conversation

was not profitable.

13. Of considerable importance to Mr. Kennedy was the following.

He was having a conversation with Allan MORRISON, the Negro editor, and

MORRISON said to him that he had received confirmation, in exact detail, of

the derogatory KING story. Further, that the information had come from

Washington from a highly placed official in the Department of Justice, Mr.

who had in turn conveyed the information to a Mr.

→a Negro

also attached to the Department of Justice, who was working in Chicago and

..who had given it directly to Allan MORRISON... MORRISON stated that he was

told that the Washington source had the entire KING file in his office in-

cluding photographs and tapes on Martin Luther KING, Jr.

Mr. Kennedy said

he asked MORRISON if he had done anything about this; and, according to

Mr. Kennedy, MORRISON told him that he called a meeting of the top editors

and officials of the Johnson publications (Ebony, etc.) of which he,

MORRISON, is the top editor.

According to MORRISON, he told those present

the story. After some shocked silence, Mr. JOHNSON

said to MORRISON and

those present, we cannot publish that; and Mr. Kennedy said that MORRISON

told Mr. JOHNSON, if we don't publish it, it is going to blow up underneath

our noses because it is certain to come out sooner or later.

14. Mr. Kennedy stated that the details of the KING matter are

definitely known to the editors of the New York Times and the New York

Herald Iribune, but they will not break the story because they have been

asked not to. (Mr. Kennedy stated presumably by the President.

15. The writer then referred to the Kennedy thesis that Martin Luther

KING, Jr. is moving in a way that is indicative that he is being controlled

by the Peking line Communists, possibly or probably through BELAFONTE, from

whon there is some information that would indicate he is a Maoist. The

writer asked Mr. Kennedy what possible action would the Peking line Commu-

nists take in the KING matter. Mr. Kennedy replied by saying that it is

certain to him that the Communists, both the Moscow and the Peking types,

are aware of the Martin Luther KING, Jr. matter. Mr. Kennedy stated as far

as he could figure out, the Peking Communists would handle KING in one of

two ways:

(a) We will permit you to remain head of the Negro movement in

the United States and you may continue to rise in public ac-

The other Negro leaders have no courage and they

will not expose you.

They are cowards and controlled by

the Capitalist leaders of the United States. You will, how-

ever, remember that we know what the story is and you will

do what you are told. Or

(b) They, themselves, the Peking Communists, will expose KTNG

and in so doing they will end him, they will everlasting

discredit all the other Negro leaders, and they will then

be in a position to disrupt the Negro movement, cause chaos

and trouble, and possibly gain control of it.

If they ex-

pose KING,

they will say to the Press and public media which

they control to the Negro people, that your leaders have be-

trayed you, they knew this story of KING all along and were

cowardly.

They obeyed instructions from their capitalist

leaders.

16. Mr. Kennedy stated that he is absolutely convinced that the

Peking line Communists are moving ahead of the Moscow Communists,

both in

the world area and in the domestic scene. He pointed out that BELAFONTE has

taken over the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee and that James

FORMAN, its National Executive Secretary, is going along with this. He

stated that there are other indications of the Peking line Communists show-

ing strength, and that there are a number of ways this can be demonstrated.

He called attention to

the fact that for the last 3 or 4 weeks there has been

a period of inaction and that none of the Negro leaders, except James FARMER

of CORE, have been doing anything when they should have been

strongly

active. (Mr. Kennedy states that it is his opinion that this is due to the

movement being held in check by Peking line Communists who are demonstrating

and consolidating their strength.

He stated further that the "deacons" are

nothing more than small ad hoc groups which the Peking line Communists have

set up

as needed and are, in fact, riding on the back of CORE. Mr. Kennedy

stated that they are not CORE groups, but are activist Negro advocates of

violence and who are working to disrupt and smear CORE and its leadership.

They are constantly working to convert CORE from a non-violent group into an

action group which would, of course, put CORE in the Peking line.

17. The writer asked Mr. Kennedy if there was any indication that he

knew of that would show that the Negro leaders--YOUNG, WILKINS, FARMER,

RANDOLPH or MORRISON--were going to expose KING. ! Mr. Kennedy stated that

there is no such information, that none of them wanted to be responsible for

the exposure, nor could they agree among themselves to do it as a group.

MORRISON, himself, according to Kennedy, would like to expose the situation,

but he could not do this alone and unsupported. (Mr. Kennedy stated again,

as he had many times previously, that unless this exposure comes from the

Negro leaders themselves, the attacks on KING will be useless and will end

up only making him perhaps a martyr and would set back the Negro Civil Rights

Movement for years.

18. Toward the end of the conversation, Mr. Kennedy pointed out that

any examination of the Civil Rights Movement, at the present time, would show

a clear and concise picture of Communist penetration and activities, namely,

from the Peking line Communists. Mr. Kennedy said it is well to note that

the war in Vietnam has now been linked to the Civil Rights Movement and,

gradually, the two unrelated areas are being blended together in an all

Communist Party line attack on U.S. policy.

Mr. Kennedy stated that this has

spread confusion into the Negro Civil Rights Movement and has duped many of

the leaders of the movement and caused them to make utterances which are

stupid and certainly unpatriotic. Mr. Kennedy referred to the activities and

statements of A. Phillip RANDOLPH in behalf of the "Refusal to Fight" move-

19. Mr. Kennedy further said that the aims of the Communists were

clear in that they wanted to link the Negro leadership and the Negro mass

Civil Rights Movement into a position of anti-government action, and that

the Peking line would be away from the Moscow "peaceful coexistence line"

and would be continuous agitation for violent action and disruption. He

stated that so called leaders like Martin Luther KING, Jr. and Harry BELA-

FONTE have very clearly started blending the Negro Civil Rights Movement into

a merger with their attacks on the government policy in Vietnam and, even to

a lesser degree, into attacks on government policy in the Dominican

Republic.

Mr. Kennedy predicted that more and more of this will appear as the summer

goes along.

He stated that among the most important leaders of the movement,

he felt that only Allan MORRISON had a thorough understanding of the problem,

that FARMER in a vague way understood the problem, but was not acute enough

to clearly understand it and combat it. He said WILKINS and Whitney YOUNG

probably understood this matter, but they are too busy attempting to create

a good image of themselves in the public eye to be willing to get down and

fight this penetration in an all out manner.

20. Mr. Kennedy stated that he would be continuously in touch with

either Chief, SRS or the writer

as he obtained information of interest.
