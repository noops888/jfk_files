two weeks ago, ‘and these talks inspired my confidence, ‘I had
the feeling that the Vice President completely shared President
KENNEDY 's political ideas. I believe! that he\is a very ex-
perienced man-and that:there is no tejason to doubt his wish to
follow President KENNEDY's policy. Therefore it is necessary
to have confidence and:to work with him with the same desire for
co-operation’ as that which we showed:to Presidént KENNEDY,
