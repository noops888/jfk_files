Thank you for your letters of June 19 and 21, 1978,
requesting copies of documents pertaining to the assassination
of President John F. Kennedy, and asking that a member of
your staff be. allowed to meet and speak with a Service employee
concerning Mr. James Braden.

We are enclosing edited copies of documents which may
relate to the assassination of President Kennedy and which
were provided to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence
in 1977... However, a Los Angeles memorandum report prepared
by Special Agent John P. Daley’and dated November 17, 1970,
was not included. It is our understanding that this document,
appropriately deleted, is included in material available in
Los Angelés. Information deleted from the documents consists
of third party tax information.

I have asked our District Director in Dallas to permit
Special Agent Gene Boren to meet with your designated staff
member and. to discuss with him the enclosed documents. Any
discussions relative to the tax affairs of Mr. James Braden
will, of course, be limited to that information covered by
Mr. Braden's waivers.

Southern California to be used in training "kill squads" to help rid the
_world of communists. Also, the squads were to be-used in foreign coun-
“tries to protect the HUNTS' foreign operations. This allegation is
based on conversations overheard and there is only a. small. amount of
documentation Supporting: this” statement ._

f

‘We know that BUNKER owns property in Southern California, and BUNKER,
-> together with LAMAR, has had unknown connections with a.man in
- (: California named EUGENE BRADING (alias JIN BRADEN, JAMES BRADLEY LEE,
+ and JAMES LEE COLE). According to his "wrap sheet" in the available
files, BRADING has a record of burglary, operating a gambling house, :
- bookmaking, mail fraud conspiracy, and embezzlement dating back.to 1934... i
BRADING was allegedly arrested in Dallas, Texas, on the date of JOHN F. :
XENNEDY's assassination, questioned and released. Also, he reportedly
was in the HUNTS' offices on the day before the assassination. He was
~-said to be fifteen minutes away from the point of the assassination of
ROBERT KENNEDY shortly baie his shooting.

BRADING is said to be a nenber of the LA COSTA COUNTRY CLUB near San
Clemente, California, and he spends a great deal of time there.
