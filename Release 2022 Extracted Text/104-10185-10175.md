1. One day in 1963, Source met in Havana "Moro" MANIFF, an old
friend since 1955, and complained that he was tired of his job
with the Ministry of Fxterior Commerce and wanted to make a.
change , MANIFF said he would do something about it. Two or
three days later, another frierd, Ramon VASQUEZ Montenegro,
whom Source had known at the Ministry of Industry, came to see
Source, saying that MANIFF had gentioned that Source was having —
trouble with the militia and wanted to change jobs. VASQUEZ
promised to telephone the following day and did so, arranging
to pick up Source in a car, They drove around through Vedado *
together while VASQUEZ offered Source a job in espionage and
counter-intelligence. Source asked for a littla time to think
over the situation, Tne following day VASQUEZ telephoned Source
and the day after that VASQUEZ called on Source personally to
urge hin to accept; Source decided he had better do so and agreed.
Thereupon Saul GONZALEZ brought Source a personal-history state-
ment form of three or four sheets, which Source filled out. The
form included full name, date and place of birth, physical
description, -data on rolatives (parents, brothers, and sisters),
and addresses at which hé had lived for the preceding ten years.
GONZALEZ told Source to have no more worries atout his troubles
with the militia, Three or four days later Source went to the
Ministry of Interior for firgerprinting. He was told to go to
a doctor for a physical examiration but never did so, and ap-
Parently no one checked up on him. Three or four days later,
GONZALEZ picked Source up and drove him directly to tne Head-
quarters of the Direccion Gen#ral de Inteligencia (General
Directorate of Intelligence - DUI). At the DGI Headquarters
Source saw several old acquaintances, including Fernando PASCUAL
Perez, Ramon Cesar CUENCA Montoto, and others, jl

As soon as Source was taken tu the DGI Readyuarters, Source vas
told to choose a pseudonya. After Source chose the pseudonyn
“Victor FERNANDE: Norberto HBPXANDEZ Curbelo, who sas thea in
charge of the Departamento de Liberscicn Nacional (Natioaat
Liberafion Department.- LN) operations for Central America ander
the MA Section, sent a memorandum to the DGI Personnel Depart-
ment giving the psdudonym as belenging to Source. The actual
forwarding memorandum was sent by the Secret Office. ‘This was an
essential step because payrolls were always made out in pseudonym.
The normal pseudonym consists of a given name and a surname, and
can be used by the given name, surname, or both together. Since
each officer chooses his own pscudunym, there is. sometimes dupli-
cation, with two persons choosing the same name. When this
happens nothing is done if the two persons are working in different
departments-of the DGI. If for any reason there is a shift in
personne) &hich brings the two persons with the same pseudonyns,
first or ast names, into the same department, one cr the other

: whl have to change his pseudonya in order to avoid confusion.

Innediately upoa Joiting the DGI, Source was assigned to the
Salvador Dek ‘in tho Seccion Central (Central American Section)
of the LN Department, where he continued to work. He was started
at once on reading the desk operational files and very soon was
given operational files from other aesxs to also read. He re-
ceived only minimal security briefings id was told to invent for
Nimself some sort of reasonable corer job. Source kept his old
Ministry of Intornal Trade identification card to use as cover.
As soon as eniployment was mentioned to him he was told that he
was being recruited by "H" and that it was for espionage.
