MEMORANDUM FOR: George Frates
Chief, Records Systems Branch, RND

FROM : Jon E. Wolfe, RSB
SUBJECT : Status of Records Related to the HSCA Investigation

1. |, Attached for your perusal is the draft of an item scheduling
the CIA's HSCA-related records. I suggest that this item be added te
the OLC records control schedule (as a restricted iten) and submitted to
NARS for formal disposition approval. (Col. Tagge of NARS has reviewed
the draft item and its disposition and is in basic agreement.)

2, _ You will note that the proposed item addresses both film and
Paper records. The film duplicates those records which must be returned
to their original locations, All other records, such as those which
have already been duplicated on paper and those which were generated as
the result of the investigation will not be filmed.

3.___Filming is currently underway in the DDO and is being done by
“dulian Goldberg\in, I believe, a new location on the sixth floor. The
DDO is not only filming and verifying its ow files but also those of
the Office of Personnel. One estimate I have heard is that it will
Tequire the DDO about one year to complete the job.

4. _ Filming is also either underway or being planned in the Office
of Security. This process will be overseen by Jack Sullivan. The only
other film we have consists of DDS&T footage on the U-2. I have beon
fold that the latter is probably part of a permanent record series. If
it is, I suggest that it not be duplicated but rather cross-referenced

in our deposit.

5. Records that will be retired as paper are located in NFAC,
DDO, and OLC. T suggest that each of the holding components be respon-
sible for boxing, shelf listing, and sealing their respective records
and that all be retired under one job number. I further suggest that
once we are in our new vaulted area (sometime in December?) that we
Serve as the focal point for collecting and depositing these records.

6. If you concur with the attached records schedule item and the
substance of the above, I suggest that both be coordinated with the
other interested parties throughout the Agency. If no significant
problems are found, I will then see that the new item is submitted to

NARS,
on E. ti

the file is a part.)
