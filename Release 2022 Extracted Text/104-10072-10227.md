Introduction

AMCLOCK/l arrived in New York on 19 Septender 1961. He

had been given instructions

to call a IMAVE operational number

(Iden A) next time he was out an a friendly country in order to receive

• contact instructions.

When he

failed to call soon after his arrival

it was decided to try to establisi visual contact with him at HTBASTE.

same as was done successfully in 1966, to move him to call for contact

instructions.

For that

purpOse DI GERVENO was taken to HTBASTE On

21 September carrying a match folder from Iden Biwith his alias, (den C,

and room number.

The plan was to make sure AMCLOCK/l recognized

DI GERVENO, Who also met him in 1966, and to pass the match folde

to AMADCK/1 only if this could be done securely.

DI GERVENO was

able to make definite visual contact on four different occasions:

once at(Iden D, twice at liden E"and a fourth time on the corridor

between Aden D'and (Iden f

ANCLOCK/1 quickly recognized DI GERVENO

and tried to keep himself

available for a possible contact. However

this was not possible and

the enstarte an ll Sontonhor wore limited

to visual recognition only

During this time the operational number of the Beekman site

(Iden G) was also manned in case AMCLOCK/1 had

retained this nunber

and attempted to call DI GERVENO there instead of IMWAVE, but he

failed to call either place for contact instructions.

It was then

decided to attempt to contact the agent again on 26 September at

HTBASTE.

While attempts were being made to locate AMCLOCK/1

the

case officer surveilled the building where AMCLOCK/1 is staying

(Iden H)

and saw him go in by himself at 1310 houns to leave his briefcase.

At 1330 hours, AMCLOCK/1 left the building alone to go for lunch and

DI GERVENO followed him.

AMCLOCK/1 recognized the case officer and

after exchanging safety signals DI GERVENO passed the match folder

o the agent while both were waiting on a crowded street corner for

the red light to change, ät which

time AMCLOCK/1 told DI GERVENO

that he hao no way to contact hin and would see him after lunch.

Operational Chronlogy

3= On 20 september AMeLock/I met DI GaRVeNo Erom 1500 to 1830

at Iden B

AMCLOCK/1 appeared to be in good health and rested and in

high spirits. He was very glad to see II GERVENO again and to be able

to discuss things openly.

He criticized bitterly the living conditions

in PBRUMEN but does not seem to be affected by it or by the fact that

he had to live under a regime he obviously hates.

In fact, he seemed

quite sure of himself and plans to return to PBRUMEN at the end of the

HTBASTE session.

He is scheduled to remain in New York until December

1967 but may return to PBRUMEN before then for a short visit to l00k

after his ailing mother and his wife, who had a baby girl two weeks

prior to his departure.

This may have influenced AMCLOCK/1 not to

think about a possible defection at this time, which came as a surprise

to the case officer who expected the agent to have second thoughts

about return to PBRUMEN where he is not happy.

4. AMCIOCK/l explained that he could not make contact as instructed

because he had destroyed the phone number and both accommodation

addresses we had given him for him to report from inside PBRUMEN. He

destroyed them in the toilet at the airport upon his arrival in PBRUMEN

in late December 1966 after observing a number of uniformed individuals

at the airport which he considered to be suspicious, although they had

nothing to do with AMCLOCK/l.

This may have been a convenient excuse for

his failure to make contact as instructed but DI GERVENO did not press

the issue.

Instead he was given the operational numbers of the Beekmar

site and of the Base in New York (Iden It and told he could always cal

there if he could not locate DI GERVENO at (den B.)

He wag also given

the IMWAVE number for emergency contact.

AMCIOCK/1 said he tried to

make contact by calling (Iden J'to inquire about MIDDAUGH in true name.

bue after much probing he was told that MIDDAUGH was in washington and

was given a phone number for him to call direct.

AMCLOCK/1 was planning

to call Washington at a later day it he had not been contacted.

AMCLOCK/1 reported that he has had no security problems and

nas not been molested inside of PBRUMEN. He was treated "royally" by

the AMTHUG regime in early 1967 and everybody seemed pleased

to see

him back. Apparently his return surprised some individuals who pri-

vately thought he would defect rather than return to PBRUMEN to live.

During this time he enjoyed special privileges and received frequent

invitationa to official functions wich foreign diplomats.

However,

by mid 1967 the special privileges and invitations were gradually

suspended for no apparent reason.

(For example, he was no longer

allowed to take his private car to a government garage for repairs

and he had

to arrange for themaintenance of his house, which was given

to him and kept up by the government at first). AMCLOCK/1 believes

that this was due to his being under "observation" while going through

a reorientation period after hia long stay abroad. There is nothing

to indicate that AMCLOCK/l is not trusted of accepted by other govern-

ment officials. The fact that he was

sent out again initistrong

indication that he enjoys

a

favorable position in the AMTHUG regime.

He hopes that in 1968 he will be assigned to another permanent post

abroad.

6.

In reference to his w. fe AMCLOCK/1 stated that he is now

convinced that she is totally against the AMTHUG regime. After

their matriage in late 1966 he was not sure of her true political

ideology but during the past year he has been able to confirm her

disagreement on a number of occasions.

He feels confident that she

would follow him in any movement against the regime,

such

as defection,

but has not told her about his work for woract.

7. Regarding the trip to New York, AMCLOCK/y reported that with due

In answer to

specific questions AMCLOCK/I said that the crate they brought contained

only a vase far Iden P: AMCLOCK/1 is not aware if any weapons of special

instructions have been sent to Iden F in connection with racial dis-

turbances in WOLADY.

The routine instructions given to Iden ?) were to

oppose INHARP actions in HIBASTE whenever possible and to try to bring

all debatable matters to HYBASTE, where they have better support

8. AMCLOCK/I was not seen going in of out of the room and the

meeting was conducted without interruption under most secure condi-

tions, DI GERVENO established immediate rapport with AMCLOCK/1 and

their relations remained most cordial throughou: the meeting. Only

DI GERVENO and AMCLOCK/1 were present.

9.

DI GERVENO was careful not to mention

salary payments to

AMCLOCK/1 who is not aware of his salary increase to $1,000 a month

effective & January 1966.

However,

he requested $500 to buy books

and baby items for his daughter.

DI GERVENO told him that he would

bring hin the money in their next meeting. All payments to AMCLOCK/1

will be T/A'd to INWAVE together with the agent's signed receipts.

Operational Chronology

On 27 September 1967 AMCLOCK/I met DI GERVENO from

1130 to

1530

for lunch. at the Becknan site.

The agent was not seen

entering

of leaving the site and he stayed out of sight when food was brought

up from the restaurant downstairs.

The meeting was conducted under

secure conditions and without interruptions. Only AMCLOCK/1 and

DI GERVENO were present at the meeting.

AMCIOCK/1 reported that ne nod veen assigned to word a

Iden Ä with(Iden Bl same as last year. A few days before his departure

from PBRUMEN, (Iden C told AMCLOCK/1 to watch out for Iden B who is a

member of the intelligence service and will be reporting on AMCLOCK/1.

The implication was.that AMCLOCK/I was

still under observation by the

AMTHUG regime and (Iden C'actually told him

to bend backwards in every

way possible to prove himself while in New York. AMCLOCK/1 explained

that this meant to live a model life while abroad and to perform extra

work whenever required, without complaining. AMCLOCK/1 believes that

Iden B is being trained to take over AMCLOCK/l's position as an expert

in economics for the AMTHUG regime. If this is the case, this may be

the last time AMCLOCK/1 is sent to (Iden A Still, under much probing,

AMCLOCK/I could not come out with any clear indication that he was

suspected or was

falling out of grace with the AMTHUG regime. Although

the agent has a tendency to emphasize his "delicate" position, the

case officer believes that he is not mistrusted and still enjoys a

favorable position in the government

although probably considered too

bourgeois to be completely integrated with their communist philosophy.

3.

Regarding the recent changes made in PBRUMEN diplomatic

personnel abroad, AMCLOCK/1 was not aware of any security shake up

taking place in the Foreign Ministry.

He regarded these changes

as a coutine naster in accordance with their policy to bring back

reorientation tour all those diplomats stationed

abroad for three

consecutive years of more.

AMCLOCK/1 actually

appeared not to be aware of any major purge and not to be concerned

about it. However, if this is true the chances for AMCLock/l to be

reassigned abroad in the near

future appear doubtful at this time.

When DI GERVENO asked AMCLOCK/1 about his work and how the

recent changes may affect him, the agent then reported the following

information about his position in the Foreign Ministry. After his

return in late December 1966 he was given four months vacation, during

which time he went by the ministry trom time to time but had no job

assigned to him. He used most of this time for a honeymoon and to

relocate in his new home furnished by the PBRUMEN government.

In the

seEing of 1967 fIden Ciconsidered him actively as a substitute for

Eden Diwhom Iden & does not like. However, the job did not materialize

because (Iden C's plans te send Eden D' as Ambassador to Canada were not

"accepted by (Iden Euwhom Iden C'was going to send as Ambassador to

switzerland.

At that time AMCLOCK/1 was also

• considered for a position

in Iden F which was the position the PBRUMEN President

wanted him to

take,) but AMCLOCK/1 avoided the position although it implied frequent

travels abroad.

The reason AMCLOCK/1 gave for not taking the position

at (iden E was

that he did not want to break away from his diplomatie

career and felt he would be better protected among his filends in the

Foreign Ministry.

Consequently, after his vacation AMCLaCK/I want

back to work in the Foreign Ministry but without any specific duties.

He is actually doing odd jobs for Iden Ci Like economic studies.

mid 1967 AMCLOCK/1 and (Iden G) were proposed by (Iden @and accepted by

Eden Das members of/a four-man committee (the other two membere

not been selected yet) which is to be created in the Foreign Miniairy

to make specific area studies and recommendations to dion if sinca

both ANCLOCK/1 and Eden @have been asgigned to the liBASTE annion,

it is concluded that the creation of said "Advisory Committee" as not

contemplated until early 1968.

Accoiding to AMCLOCK /l the croation

of this

"Advisory Committee" has beer discussed at the highest lovele

only and it may have some influence in the policy making decision

note that in the past year that AMCLOCK/l has been residing indice o!

PBRUMEN he has made no clear effort to obtain and develop new sources

of information and to bring out with him intelligence of particular

interest to us. For example, he has no information on the apocate

requirements we gave him in 1966 prior to his retuin to popumel arid

wife.

(AMCIOCK/1 is a difficult individual to debrief on hard

intelligence.)

6.

Regarding internal

security in the PBRUMEN mission in

New York, AMCLOCK/l reported that the entire third floor of the

mission is used only by members of the intelligence seruice...

Not

even the Ambassador is allowed in that area.

Besides Iden B,

AMCLOCK/l correctly identified the known members of the intelligence

service permanently assigned to the PBRUMEN mission.

7. AMCLOCK/1 was given $500 he requested from his escrow

account and signed a receipt for this amount, which will be t/A'd
