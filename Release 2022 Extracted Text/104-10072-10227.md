instructions. For that purpose DI GERVENO wag taken to HTBASTE on

21 September carrying a match folder from(id Biwith hie alias, (
and room number. The plan was to make sure AMCLOCK/1 recognized
DI GERVENO, who also met him in 1966, and to pass the match folde
to AMODCK/i only if this could be done securely. DI GERVENO was
ble to make definite visu ontact on four different occasion:

and attempted to call DI GERVENO there instead of JMWAVE, but he
failed to call either place for contact instructions. It was the
decided to attempt to contact the agent again on 26 September at
HTBASTE. While attempts were being made to locate AMCLOCK/1 the
case officer surveilled the building where AMCLOCK/1 is staying (tden H)7
and saw him go in by himself at 1310 hou to leave his briefcase:

At 1330 nours, AMCLOCK/1] left the pailainy alone to go for lunch and

DI GERVENO followed him. AMCLOCK/i recognized the case officer and
after exchanging safety signals DI GERVENO passed the match folder

to the agent while both were waiting on a crowded street corner for

the red light to change, at which time AMCLOCK/1 told DI GERVENO
that he hao no way to contact him and would see him after lunch.

3. On 26 September AMCLOCK/1 met DI GERVENO from 1500 to 1830
at @den By AMCLOCK/1 appeared to be in good health and rested and in
high spirits. He was very glad to see LI GERVENO again and to be able
to discuss things openly. He criticized bitterly the living conditions
in PBRUMEN but does not seem to be affected by it or by the fact that
he had to live under a regime he obviously hates. In fact, he seemed
quite sure of himself and plans to return to PBRUMEN at the end of the
HTBASTE session. He is scheduled to rewain in New York until December
1967 but may return to PBRUMEN before then for a short visit to look
after his ailing mother and his wife, who had a baby girl two weeks
prior to his departure. This may have influenced AMCLOCK/1 not to
think about a possible defection at this time, which came as a surprise
to the case officer who expected the agent to have second thoughts
about return to PBRUMEN where he is not happy.

4. AMCLOCK/1 explainedé that he could not make contact as instructed
because he had destroyed the phone number and both accommodation
addresses we had given him for him to report from inside PBRUMEN. He
destroyed them in the toilet at the airport upon his arrival in PBRUMEN
in late December 1966 after observing a number of uniformed individuals
at the airport which he considered to be suspicious, although they had
nothing to do with AMCLOCK/1. This may have been a convenient excuse for
his failure to make contact as instructed but DI GERVENO did not press
the issue. Instead he was given the operational numbers of the Beekma
site and of the Base in New York (Iden L) and told he could always cal
there if he could not locate DI G:! YO at G@den By» He was also given
the JMWAVE number for emergency contact. AMCTOTK/1 said he tried to
make contact by calling@den J>to inquire about MIDDAUGH in true name
‘bur areer ame ing he Was told that MIDDAUGH was in Washington and
was given a phone number for him to call direct. AMCLOCK/1 was planning
to call Washington ata later day if he had not been contacted.

5. AMCLOCK/1 reported that he has had no security problems and
has not been molested inside of PBRUMEN, He was treated "royally" by
the AMTHUG regime in early 1967 and everybody seemed pleased to see
him back. Apparently his return surprised some individuals who pri-
vately thought he would defect rather than return to PBRUMEN to live.
During thie time he enjoyed special privileges and received frequent
invitations to official functions with foreign diplomats. However,
by mid 1967 the special privileges and invitations were gradually
suspended for no apparent reason. (For example, he was no longer
allowed to take his private car to a government garage for repairs
and he had to arrange for themaintenance of his house, which was given
to nim and kept up by the government at first). AMCLOCK/1 believes
that this was due to his being under "observation" while going through
a reorientation period after his long stay abroad. There is nothing
to indicate that AMCLOCK/1 is not trusted or accepted by other govern-
ment officials. The fact that he was sent out again is aptrong

indication that he enjoys a favorable pusition in the AMTHUG regime.
He hopes that in 1968 he will be assigned to another permanent post
abroad.

6. In veference ti his w.fe AMCLOCK/1 stated that he is now
convinced that she is totally against tie AMTHUG regime. After
their marriage in late 1966 he was not sure of her true political
ideology but during the past year he has been able to confirm her
disagreement on a number of occasions. He feels confident that she
would follow him in any movement against the regime, such as defection,
but has not told her about his work for WOPACT.  Cepu@ee THE Cae. fgg

eeting was conducted without interruption under most secure condi-
tions. DI GERVENO established immediate rapport with AMCLOCK/} and
heir relations remained most cordial throughout the meeting. Only
DI GERVENO and AMCLOCK/1 were present

9. DIL GERVENO was careful not to mention salary payments to
AMCLOCK/1 who is not aware of his salary increase to $1,000 a month
effective i January 19 However, he requested $500 to buy books
and baby items for bh ughter. DI GERVENO told him that he would
bring him the money in their next meeting. All payments to AMCLOCK/1
will be T/A'd to JMWAVE together with the agent's gigned receipts.

Operational Chronology

1. On 27 September 1967 AMCLOCK/1 met DI GERVENO from 1130 to
1530 for lunch at the Beekman site. The agent was not seen entering
or leaving the site and he stayed out of sight when food was brought
up from the restaurant downstairs. The meeting was conducted under
secure conditions and without interruptions. Only AMCLOCK/1 and

DI GERVENO were present at the meeting. |

ember of the inte

The implication was that AMCLOCK/1 was still under observation by the
AMTHUG regime and(iden C’actually told him to bend backwards in every
way possible to prove himself while in New York. AMCLOCK/1 explained

that this meant to live a model life while abroad and to perform extra
work whenever required, without complaining. AMCLOCK/1 believes that

(iden“B is being trained to take over AMCLOCK/1's position as an expert
YH €conomics for the AMTHUG regime, If this is the case, this may be
the last time AMCLOCK/1 is sent to Uden A> Still, under much probing,
AMCLOCK/1 could not come out with any Clear indication that he was
suspected or was falling out of ‘grace with the AMTHUG regime. Although
the agent has a tendency to emphasize his "delicate" position, the
case officer believes that he is not mistrusted and still enjoys a
favorable position in the government, although probably considered too
bourgeois to be completely integrate? with their communist philosophy.

appeared not to be aware of any major purge and not to be concerned y
about it. However, if this is ‘true the chances for AMCLOCK/1 to be
reassigned abroad in the near future appear doubtful at this time.

4. When DI GERVENO asked AMCLOCK/1 about his work and how the
recent changes may affect him, the agent then reported the following
information about his position in the Foreign Ministry. After his
return in late December 1966 he was given four months vacation, during
which time he went by the ministry from time to time but had no job
assigned to him. He used most of this time for a honeymoon and to
relocate in his new home furnished by the PBRUMEN government. In the

Piccepted ByUden Ee whom Iden @*was going to send as Ambassador to
Switzerland. At that\ time AMCLOCK/1 was also considered for a position
in@den Fowhich was the position the PBRUMEN President wanted him to\
take But AMCLOCK/1 avoided the position although it implied frequent
f€ravels abroad. The reason AMCLOCK/1 gave for not taking the positio
at Gden Pywas that he did not want to break away from nis diplomatic
career and felt he would be better protected among his frsends in thes
Foreign Ministry. Consequently, after his vacation AMCLOCK/1 want ul
