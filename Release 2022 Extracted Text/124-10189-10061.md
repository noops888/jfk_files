TRAINING OF NEGROES in CUBA

This Bureau is in receipt of a copy of a Central
intelligence Agency (CIA) communication dated October 31,
1887, regarding the training of Nesroes in Cuba. The original
of the communication was addressed to the Honorable Walt W. i
Rostow, Special Assistant to the President. (8) (d| a

“Information is contained therein to the effect that
three Cuban sources during the past four months have reported
the existence of a training school near Santiago de Cuba where
from 100 to 150 young men are being groomed for subversive
operations against the United States to include sabotage in
connection with race riots directed at bringing about a Negro
revolution in this country. One source reported that the
training includes courses in English, taught by Soviet
instructors. While two of the CIA Sources described the
students as Negroes, there was no indication that any of the
Negro students were from the United States. The third cia

= source described them as young men from North Vietnam
North Korea, Africa, and Latin-American countrics (Au)

Information in the possession of this Bureau indicates
that the above-described training school may well be an outgrowth
of the Tri-Continental Conference, held in Havana, Cuba, in
January, 1966, the declared purpose of which was organizing
guerrilia warfare in a, Africa and Latin America, During the
year following the co. rence this Bureau received continuing
reports that the Cubans were endeavoring to implement the aims,

. of the conference. Since Castro first came to power in Cuba |

in 1959, we have been alert to his possible use of refugee 7
channels to infiltrate agents and saboteurs and have initiated
appropriate investigative steps to detect this. In January, 1967,
an additional program was instituted aimed at detecting Cuban-

f trained agents and saboteurs entering the United States through
SR gitimate Cuban refugee channels. Such refugees have been arriving
in Miami since December, 1965, at the rate of approximately

4,000 each month. Min the ten months since our Cuban refugee
program was first instituted, over 1,700 cases have been opened
based upon information in the backgrounds of various refugees
pointing toward 2 sotential or propensity on their parts to
undertake intelligence, sabotage, or other subversive missions

on behalf of the Cuban Government. Currently hese cases are

TRAINING OF NEGROES IN CUBA

During late July and early August, 1967, a Latin-
American Solidarity Organization (LASO) conference was held in
Havana, at which the Cubans indicated that they were continuing
their efforts to implement the declared aims of the Tri-
Continental Conference. Numerous resolutions were promulgated i
at the conclusion of the LASO conference, one of which exhorted
North American Negroes"to respond to the racist violence of
the imperialist United States Government -with an increase in |
i direct revolutionary action." The American press and other news
| media extensively reported on the presence of Stokely Carmichael,
' foremost “black power" advocate of violence, in Cuba at the time
of the LASO conference, which began on July 31, 1967. Since
that date all field offices of the FBI have been alerted to
Castro's obvious intention of infiltrating agents into this
country for the purposes of sabotage and influencing the black
nationalists and other subversive movements throughout the
United States.

Our Agents on a selective basis have briefed officials
of various local, county and state police agencies of the
problem posed by the possible use of minority groups in carrying
oul sabotage on benalf of Cuba. Th: officials have been
requested to alert their racial and security informants to
provide any clues which would aid the ferreting out of potential
saboteurs. In daily contacts with cooperative security
officials of plants handling key Government contracts, department
stores, supermarkets, and similar establishments employing
Sizeable labor forces, our Agents have alerted such officials
to our interest in being expeditiously advised of data indicating
froups or individuals within their organizations are potential |
tools for use by Castro in subverting the United States.

To date, no concrete evidence has been developed to
indicate that any Cuban-trained saboteur has entered this
country since the widely publicized Cuban sabotage ring in
New York City was discovered and immobilized in 1962. Neither
has any evidence been developed of clandestine entry of Cuban-
trained Negroes for any other purposes, including infiltration
of the nef nationalist movement. The FBI By mtly is |
