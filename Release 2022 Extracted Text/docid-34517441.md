SUBJECT: Qualification of DD Form 98, Regular Registrant (SCH
Robert, SSVC Nr. 502936186)

(2) HE is not presently attending any meetings of organiza-
tions on the Attorney General's list, but if one of the organizations on
the list had a meeting of interest to HIM, HE would attend it unless HE
was in the Army at that time; HE does not agree with the Attorney General's
list and will not accept the mere listing by the Attorney General as proof
that an organization is subversive or disloyal.

(3) HE attended social functions of the Jewish Peoples Fraternal
Order, but attended no meetings of this organization; HE attended Jewish
chorus and dance groups, but was not aware of their connection with the
Jewish Peoples Fraternal Order.

(4) HE was never a member of the IWO, and believes there was a
connection between the INO and Camp Lakeland where HE was employed; Camp
lakeland had a union, but HE was not a member of this union and would not
have joined it were HE asked to join; HE had no kmowledge of political meetings
at Lakeland,

(5) Communism in Russia is not communism in the Marxian sense;
HE disapproves of almost every single political institution of Russia;
Commmnism seeks to achieve its aims by propaganda and physical force;
International Commnism is some what primitive in its techniques of diplomacy
and is more adept in the area of physical force than in the area of diplomacy.

(6) HE does not believe the CPUSA, at the present time, is a
threat to the security of the United States; if HE knew a person to be a
member of the CP, HE would take no action; HE does not believe a member of the
GPUSA swears allegiance to a foreign power and HE is not now, nor has HE ever
been, a member of the CP.

(7) HE would take the oath of allegiance to the United States
as long as it is a democratic country; HE would defend the United States
against all enemies regardless of what HE thought of the enemy; if the
majority of the people in the country decided the United States should go to
war, HE would fight.

but refused to answer any questions about HIS mother or HIS associates!
activities.

f. On 25 July 1958, SUBJECT signed the transcript of the interview
and added a statement on the last page of the transeript that: HE had no
doubts about HIS political fitness to fulfill HIS military obligation; that
nothing HE had done could incriminate HIM; it is HIS desire to live in the
land of HIS birth, participating as fully as possible in its activities, and
to be denied admittance into the Armed Forces would hinder HIM in the future;
HE believes HE had cooperated and had taken pains to indicate anything of a
personal nature which might affect HIS military service.
