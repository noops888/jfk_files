SUBJECT:

2d Ind (C)

Qualification of DD Form 98, Regular Registrant (SCHEER,

Robert, SSVC Nr. 502936186)

(2) HE is not presently attending any meetings of organiza-

tions on the Attorney General's list, but if one of the organizations on

the list had a meeting of interest to HIM, HE would attend it unless HE

was in the Army at that time; HE does not agree with the Attorney General's

list and will not accept the mere listing by the Attorney General as proof

that an organization is subversive or disloyal.

(3) HE attended social functions of the Jewish Peoples Fraternal

Order, but attended no meetings of this organization; HE attended Jewish

chorus and dance groups, but was not aware of their connection with the

Jewish Peoples Fraternal Order.

(4) HE was never a member of the IWO,

and believes there was a

connection between the IWO and Camp Lakeland where HE was employed; Camp

Lakeland had a union, but HE was not a member of this union and would not

have joined it were HE asked to join; HE had no knowledge of political meetings

at Lakeland.

(5) Communism in Russia is not communism in the Marxian sense;

He disapproves of almost every single political institution of Russia;

Communism seeks to achieve its aims by propaganda and physical force;

International Communism is some what primitive in its techniques of diplomacy

and is more adept in the area of physical force than in the area of diplomacy.

HE does not believe the CUSA, at the present time, is a

threat to the security of the United States; if HE knew a person to be a

member of the CP, HE would take no action; HE does not believe a member of the

CPUSA swears allegiance to a foreign power and HE is not now, nor has HE ever

been, a member of the CP.

(7)

as long as it is a democratic country; HE would defend the United States

against all enemies regardless of what He thought of the enemy; if the

majority of the people in the country decided the United States should go to

war, HE would fight.

SUBJECT readily answered all questions pertaining to HIMSELF,

but refused to answer any questions about HIS mother or HIS associates'

activities.

On 25 July 1958, SUBJECT signed the transcript of the interview

and added

a statement on the last page of the transcript that:

HE had no

doubts about HIS political fitness

to fulfill HIS military obligation; that

nothing HE had done could incriminate HIM; it is HIS desire to live in the

land of HIS birth, participating as fully as possible in its activities, and

to be denied admittance into the Armed Forces would hinder HIM in the future;

HE believes HE had cooperated and had taken pains to indicate anything of a

personal nature which might affect HIS military service.
