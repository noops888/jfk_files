On October 15, 1958, HERB WARD, Manager, Beach

Garage, 5939 South Lake Park,

advised SAs PAUL B.

FRANKFURT

and ROEMER that "BUTCH" LADON does not keep his Pontiac.

Illinois license number 470 148, in the garage.

noted that this is the car that LADON has been using to

chauffeur ALEX.

WARD also furnished information that LADON

has now changed his pattern in that he now takes his car

from the garage around 10 a.m., whereas his former procedure

was to take the car before 9

a.M., and sometimes before 8 a.m.

A surveillance of "BUTCH" LADON on October 15,

1958, by SAs FRANKFURT and ROEMER determined that LADON

entered the Beach Garage at 10:21 a.m. and left it at

10:22 a.m., driving the above mentioned Cadillac.

At 10:37 a.m.

LADON exited from Lake Shore Drive at the Fullerton Street

exit.

At 10:52 a.m., the above described Cadillac was

observed in a parking space at 320 Oakdale, the residence

Of EDDIE VOGEL and FRANK FERRARO.

It is noted that LADON previous to his employment

as a chauffeur by ALEX was a chauffeur-body guard for EDDIE

VOGEL, and the above information tends to indicate that

LADON

has resumed his association with vOGEL.

THOMAS S.X MUNIZZO

It is noted that I-5 has furnished information

which has previously been reported, indicating that one

"TOMMY"

was a close associate of GUS AlEX, and that "TOMMY"

LOUIS TORNABENE

As has been previously reported, LOUIS TORNA BENE

is a close associate of GUS ALEX, and operates handbooks

in the Loop area of Chicago, over which ALEX allegedly

holds the principal interest. T-5 advised on September 24,

1958, that for the past six months he has been a partner

of LOUIS TORNABENE

in a gambling

establishment which the

informant and TORNABENE operated at the Santa Fe Hotel,

'olk and Dearborn streets, Chicago.

During the course

of this

joint venture, I-5 stated that TORNABENE became

obligated to him in the amount of approximately $15,000.00,

as well as a personal gambling debt

amounting to an

additional $4,000.00.

TORNABENE refused to pay the

informant his

winnings because the informant had quit on

a specific crap game in which TORNABENE was playing against

other persons, some being backed by the informant. The

informant, at

the time of

quitting, was winning money from

TORNABENE.

The informant contacted SAM BATTAGLIA, highly

placed Chicago hoodlum,

through an intermediary and BATTAGLIA

sent an individual named FNU POPE to see the informant.

Port said he would have to get both sides of the story

• in

regards to the gambling debtaand would have a ruling in a day

or two.

Prior to the informant's contact with SAM BATTAGLIA,

LOUIS TORNABENE had sent two hoodlums to his house, obviously

with the intent to threaten the informant to take no further

action regarding the gambling debt. The informant spotted

the two individuals sitting outside his home and

then decided

to 80 dIreCtly to SAMRATTAGLIA to force the 19sue.

On the evening of September 24, 1958, the informant

was

called to the Santa Fe Bar for a meeting with TORNABENE

and POPE, who is a close associate of LOUIS TORNABENE and

Atithat time also present was an individual known as

"Chappie,

The informant advised

CHAPPIE at this meeting would directly represent GUS ALEX's

interest in the dispute. The informant advised that POPE,

the representative of SAM BATTAGLIA,

was described as white,

male, Italian, 55, light complected, average height and

"skinny.

It was decided at the meeting that TORNABENE owed

the informant no money from the gambling debt. TORNABENE

stated that the informant was being charged expenses for the

operations of TORNABENE's bookie joint and that his share in

the winnings less expenses would be $4,600.00, which TORNABENE

was obligated to pay and was, in fact, paying off

prior to the meeting and that

The informant

advised that the entire situation cost him $10,000.00 and

the interesting point was that it showed the power of GUS

ALEX's influence in the syndicate setup.

He advised that in

spite of SAM BATTAGLIA, POPE and MAISH BAER siding with him,

GUS ALEX's weight thrown to FORNABENE's side of the issue was

sufficient to settle the dispute in TORNABENE's favor with no

objection from any of the other participants in the conversation.

The informant further advised on October 8, 1958, that he felt

that he had been muscled out of money, honestly owed to him

Gang, of whom there are a few members left operating on the

East Coast, who are very powerful in the Jersey City and New

has huge sums of money available at all times for his gambling

operations and that he maintains several safety deposit boxes

at the Central National Bank, located east of Halsted Street

on the north side of Roosevelt Road.

bank is also used

as a place for storing gambling money by

other hoodlums in the Chicago area; however, he did not know

the specific individuals outside of TORNABENE using the

bank's facilities.

T-5 further advised that during the period of time

when he was in close contact and in the good graces of LOUIS

TORNABENE, TORNABENE boasted to him that GUS ALEX is anxious

to lend him $20,000.00 for TORNABENE's own use in bookmaking.

TORNABiNE stated that he has not accepted the twenty grand

but also said that GUS ALEX has offered part of the policy

racket on the South Side of Chicago. TORNABENE indicated

that he is interested in the policy angle.

HENRE SUSK

Attention is drawn to the fact that it has

previously been reported that HENRY SUSK is a close friend

Of GUS ALEX, and that SUSK has furnished ALEX with several

automobiles, which remain registered to SUSK but are used

principally by ALEX.

Also, that susk has furnished a

diner's credit card

to ALEX, and that ALEX utilizes this

card for meals.

I-I advised that on September 26, 1958, HENRY

SUSK dined with GUS and MARIANNE ALEX, and

that MARIANNE

ALEX attempted to do the cooking on this occasion and

burned both the steak and potatoes, which she attempted

to cook.

EDDIE VOGEL

the caption, "NATHAN 'BUTCH'

He stated that any problems which arise among gamblers in the

Loop are settled by GUS AleX, and that he feels certain that

It is noted that above

and the sub-caption "LOUIS

TORNABENE" information is set out concerning the intervention

Of GUS ALEX in a dispute between T-5 and LOUIS TORNABENE.

As noted above, the informant stated that one of the most

significant things to him in the entire dispute was the fact

that in spite of the weight of SAM BATTAGLIA, who is regarded

among hoodlums in Chicago as a very influential syndicate

leader coupled with MAISH BAth, who is also highly regarded

among chicago hoodlums although not so much so as BATTAGLIA,

and one POPE, the fact that GUS ALEX sided with TORNABENE

was sufficient to settle the dispute in

TORNABENE'S favor with no objection from BATTAGLIA, BAER,
