2. Cubela, as you know, has frequently expressed his desire to

Kill Fidel Castro, infact, sme officers in WH/SA, believe thet if
anyone would attempt such a fete it would be Cubela. Cubela's concern,
however, seems to be one of assurance and certainly not cowardness. He
wants U. S. assurance of: inmediate intervention should he be successful
in disposing of Castro and other leaders, Perhaps this is the "personal
Safety" JINJAUMA refers to in his letter to Zarraga. —

3. The presence of two bodyguards in this group indicates the
acesssability to their target, a significant factor in a Plot of this
type, especially since Castro is so cbsely guarded.

Le Fi@illy, it is not extraordinary that JINJAUMA should direc!

member, nanely Zarraga, In his talks with Nestor

Castro. Cubela Tealizes, of course, that Ray is not a politician nor
& good organizer, but as an engineer, Ray has the qualities that would
be extremely useful in Cuba's reconstruction.

Marcelino ARTIME Vega

of all the exile leaders in the

{RIIME has been a cutout between Cubela and Tepedine (aMeHIP),
like Tepedino, ARTE is a Jewlerin Havana; Learning that
ARTIME is closeiy tied in with Cubela and Tepedine supporte

the belief that the group is tightly knit,

I have learned too, that the information we have received
Fegarding @ possible assassination of Fidel Castre has;
in nearly every case, originated from a member of this
eraup, which again indicates that this group is united
and they each understand that one miseue will destroy
all of then,
