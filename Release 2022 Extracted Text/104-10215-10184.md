2022 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992

i Sift. 19t33

Ks. Cheever,

The following is a summary of information on the persons

mentioned in the attached remorandun from lir. Harvey Suran:

A. Jose de Jesus JINJAUMA

A Castro bodyguard who is described as a gangster Interested

in financial gain.

B.

(Osvaldo) Antonio CASTELLiValdes

An MHAPRON target and old friend of Roalndo CUBELA (more

commonly known as AMLASH/1). CASTELL was reportedly

with the Cuban Security Department and 1g a cousin of

Ramiro Valdes, the Interior Minister.

CASTELL is anti-

regime and CUBELA believes that he will "fall in line" if

there is a successful coup.

C. Rolando CUBBLA, (AMASH

-, (AMIASH-1)

A medical doctor at Manuel Fajardo Hospital in Havana.

He's determined to kill Castro.

D. Marcos GIRON Colderer

A negro, about 40, who 18 described as a comunist

opportunist. He was formerly a National Police Chief

1n Havana.

Bo JudO FERNDER de la lamesa

reportedly an undercover agent for lastro and member af

of the G-2. As of July 64 he was a Castro bodyguard.

F. Faure CHOMON

An old fiiend of Cubela's and Castell's. All fought

together against Batista and all were members of the

Directorio Revolucionario (DR), & leftist student

organization.

CHOMON was the Cuban Ambassador

?

to the USSR and is presently the Transportation Minister.

2.

Cubela, as you know, has frequently expressed his desire to

kill Fidel Castro, Infact, some officers in WH/SA, believe that if

anyone would attempt such a fete it would be Cubela. Cubela's concern,

however,

seems to be one of assurance and certainly not cowardness.

He

wants U. S. assurance of Innediate intervention should he be successful

in disposing of Castro and other leaders. Perhaps this is the "personal

Safety" JINJAUMA refers to in his letter to Zarraga.

The presence of two bodyguards in this group indicates the

accessability to their target, a significant factor in a plot of this

type, especially since Castro 1s so cosely guarded.

4. Pially, 1t 18 not extraordinary that JINJAUMA should direct his

letter to & JURE member, namely Zarraga.

In his talks with Nestor

Sanchez, Cubela has clearly stated that of all the exile leaders in the

United States, he considers Manuel Ray as the only person who would be

peritted to return to Cuba, 11 Cubela 19 successful in a coup against

Castro. Cubela realizes, of course, that Ray is not a politician nor

a good organizer, but as an engineer, Ray has the qualities that would

be extremely useful in Cuba's reconstruction.

5. If you desire to have this inforsation sent to Mr. Chirmins,

we would like to includo a feu questions on Zarraga; vi% his knowledge of

several Individuals mentioned, on whom there is obscure information.

Addendun: Marcelino ARTIME Vega

ARTIME has been a cutout between Cubela and I'epedino (AMHIP).

Like Tepedino, ARTIME is & Jewler in HavanaÂ®

Learning that

ARTIME 18 closeLy tied in with Cubela and Tepedino supporte

the bellef that the group is tightly knit.

I have learned too, tat the information we have roceived

regarding a possible assassination of Fidel Castro has;

In nearly every case, originated from a member of this

group, which again indicates that this group is united

and they each understand that one miscue will destroy

all of then.
