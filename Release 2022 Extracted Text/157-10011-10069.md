three Cuban trainees held in the jail from 9 April until 20 April 1961 and a
GSpSniSH ship captain held from 29 March 1961 until 20 April 1961.

The captain, who jumped ship on 28 May 1961, was in charge of a ship which
was transporting ammunition in support of the Cuban invasion, It was deter-
: mined that the individuals knowledge of the ffMMOvEt operation presented a

& security problem for the entire Cuban invasion operation. The captain was
taken into custody by the United States Border Patrol in New Orleans who,
upon instruction from the District Director, Immigration and Naturalization
Service, turned him over to the custody of Agency representatives, The
captain was then transported to the jail where he remained in the control of
the deputy sheriff in charge of the jail until 20 April 1961. After 20 April 1961,
the captain was transported to New York City where he was turned over to
I & NS who took custody of him until he left the country on 19 May 1961.

‘The three Cubans were jailed for several reasons, all relating to their
reluctance or inability to carry out their training. Release from the project
site was determined to create a security hazard and they were also held in
the jail until after the invasion. Upon their release each of the individuals
was given a small amount of money and allowed to return to their choice of
residence in the United States.

The foregoing is a summary of several Office of Security reports attached,
which were written after the fact. These reports and other Office of Security
files do not document the precise level of approval for the operation, insofar

IGNS records listed forwarding address as
Miami, Florida. The informa-
- tion regarding was furnished telephonically
to Headquarters, on the night
of 28 March 1961, in the event Headquarters de-
cided an attempt should be made to apprehend
on his arrival in Miami.

for leaving was the fact that his wife was preg-~

would be by caesaeran section and he was concerned
for her safety. He wanted to return to Cuba at
the earliest possible date.

“The District Director was contacted telephonically by
the reporting agent. He was advised that in

aut view _of the Captain'sknowledge of the cargo on board

the (SES™ Fidus,gengand his probable knowledge of
Co] the use for which the cargo was intended, it
would create a serious security hazard if he was
released, and especially, if he should return to
Cuba. . It was decided that there were 5 possible
ways of handling the matter. First, to release
him , and permit him to remain in the area run~

ning the risk that he might contact his wife and/
or return to Cuba. This was ruled out on security
grounds. Secondly, to-force him aboard the
vessel and place him under the custody of the
Captain replacing him. _This was believed too
risky isince it was feared the crew would be more
loyal to him than to his replacement. Further-
more,:if he should regain command of the vessel,
he might divert the craft to Cuba. Thirdly, to
detain him until after the invasion.

cally with Headquarters personnel >» on the

@ he might need as well as magazines and newspapers
to help him pass the time. The jailer was re-
quested not to provide him with a local news-
paper since it would reveal his location. An in-
quiry was made as to whether or not a radio station
was located in the townfof?Port Sulgnuy. When it
was learned that no. such Station existed, the Captain
was informed that a radio would be provided for
him at a later date. He was visited approxi-
mately two times each week at which time he was
provided with English and Spanish newspapers and
magazines. A staff employee,
acted as interpreter on three of the visits.
Subject was permitted to write letters to his
wife, one of which was mailed after being censored.
: An inquiry was made, at the Subject's
request, through his office in New York City, re-
garding his wife's health. When it was learned
that she had given normal birth to a son, Subject
was so informed.

"Subject was very cooperative during the period

of detention, from 28 March 1961 to 20 April 1961,
and approximately one week before he was released,

@ he was provided with a two band, eight transistor
radio. This radio was subsequently given to the
jailer in appreciation for his cooperation and the
services he had provided, not only for. Subject, but
in handling three other trainees who were subse-
quently placed in jail. A receipt obtained from
the jailer for the radio is attached hereto as
Exhibit No. 1. Food forSubject and the three
trainees was purchased, as ordered, by the jailer
‘from a local restaurant

"Subject's personnel effects were subsequently
turned over to the @fansen. 6: Tide

‘porting agent assumed custody of the effects, con-
sisting of a large suitcase, a leather briefcase,
a small cloth handbag and a red, metal tool box.
The above items were placed in the vault at the
base for safekeeping.

HW 50955 DocId:32203837 Page 10


"Subsequently, a cursory check for weapons
was being made of the above effects before taking
certain items of clothing toSubject| at the jail.
It was discovered that the personal effects con-
taincd items of considerable value including U.S.
and Cuban currency; gold coins; a valuable engag-
ment ring containing a diamond estimated at five
karats; plus other items. Also, there were several
letters with currency enclosed or attached and the
envelopes contained stateside and foreign addresses.

"On 13 April 1961, Sgt. » Special Agent

“ar Tes of monetary value and/or of intelligence
