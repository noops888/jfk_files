Ideology and Control of ‘the Newspaper

1965, reporting 4 statement by the White House Press Chief

12, On 26 October 1965, Mundo Americano published an

appeared on the front page of Mundo Americano reporting that
General SOMOZA was gravely ill in o Baltinore, Maryland,
hospital. According to conversations overheard by source,

newspaper, including Rolando MASFERRER, were summoned to the
Nicdraguag Embassy in Washington, D.C. At the meeting the
Ambassador from Nicarague. pojnted out that the news appearing
in the paper was false, An argument between the Ambassador
and MASFERRER cnsued and MASFERRER was thrown out of the meet-
ing. Aftor that, a second meeting took place betwedn the

Inside Struggles

i" €
: 13. . When Mundo Americano was first published, Jose LOPEZ
Vilaboy had financial control of the newspaper. Currently,
however, control is in the hands of Rolando HASFERRER Rojas
and Ceferino R, PERBZ Carri]. In Cuba, PEREZ Carril campaigned
politically for BATISTA.and ‘was a Cuban Army Captain during Y
the BATISTA Regime. .

14, Since the newspaper was first published, it's policy
has been controlled by the group having financial control.
Although MASFERRER's and LOPEZ Vilaboy's groups both follow
the BATISTA line, LOPEZ is in favor of a soft line and HASFERRER
ig in favor of a hard ling, attacking groups and persons with

i which he does not agree. Since MASFERRER and PERBZ have
obtained control of the newspaper, it has constantly attacked

the U.S, Government and the CIA, LOPEZ is not in favor of
attacking the U.S, Government, the CIA or the Spanish Govern-
ment, MASFERRER, however, states that LOPEZ can do nothing

about it because he no longer controls the newspaper financially.
Asa result of the recent shift in power, two of LOPEZ' men,
Frarfcisco CASADO Remedios and Jose M, PEREZ, were joved

from their positions in Mundo Americano on 19 Sep amber 1965.
