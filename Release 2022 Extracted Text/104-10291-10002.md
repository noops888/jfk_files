of standards, and the CS is clearly better. managed because

of his continuing efforts. Were these two previous recommen~

that thoso in control simply do not know what this officer
does. and has done. Knowing what he does and how he docs it
should not continue to be unrewarded and, hence, I add my

To get’a broad introduction to the concepts of PPBS and to learn what some
other non-military elernents of the Executive Branch ore doing with the PPBS.

I thought that {rem-a-broad, general standpoint the orientation was worthwhile
but that far more BOB participation would. have enhanced the program greatly,’
There was too much of. "we think this 1s what BOB means" and too Ilttle. of _
BOB saying "this is what we mean". I found the movie presentation of Dr. E.
S, Quade's speech-terrible becduse of inept projection, faulty audio equipment,
and,out-of-place music. Dr. Quade had a message and fortunately the CSC
plansera must have known thelr film waa inadequate, for we were provided
with the written text. Outotanding possibly because he stood out so far in
comparison to the others wae Mr. Peter Szaaton from BOB, Dr. Adams from
