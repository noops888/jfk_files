NEMORANDUM FOR:

SUBJECT:

Secretary;

CSCS Board

Recommendation for promotion -

Robert P. Wheeler

1.

As one of the final acts in my CIA career I want-

to bring to your attention and add my strong concurrenco

and rocommendation to

two (2) recorded rocommendatlong for

tho promotion of Robert P. Whecler to the grade Gs-17.

I

tind it hard to imagine a more persuasive recommendation

for this nction than that forwarded by my predecessor in

1969 (Attached).

I can imagino

recling

when

he prepared the second recommendation in February 1970

(Attnched)..

And yet, 1 find in February 1971 there has still

beon no action.

In the yoar that has passed this promotion

has becomo

appointmont accompanying such

even more deserved, for despite the natural dis-

continuing lack of recogni-

tion,

there has been no diminution of entliualasm, no lowering

of standards, and the CS is clearly better managed becauso

of his continuins efforts.

Here these two previous recommen-

dations not so clear cut and descriptive, I would conclude

that those in control simply do not know

what this officer

does and has done.

Knowing what he does and how he doc's it

should not continue to be unrewarded and, hence, I add my

strongest recommendation for carly and favorable action.

This olficer has performed in a most outstanding

as testified in his fitness reports by my prede-

and certatnly during my tenure as Chiel, ipS for

the past 12 months.

5. Mr. Wheeler also has the gift el beink able to absorb rapidly

and commit to paper accurately and quickly, a charactertstic and asset

of his which has much to commend it.

6.

He has been a superb deputy, acting in this capacity in my

absence..

He has excellent recall, la a piled administrator, and has

introduced a number of procedural changes that have increased MPS

effectiveness. He has been effective in draling with OPPB and in par-

ticipation in the briefings of Office of Manageinent and Budget (OMB)

personnel. He is very cost conscious am has made several suggestiong

resulting in the saving of hundreds of thousands of dollars. Mr. Wheeler

has always enthuslastically accepted asriyaments to panels designed to

upgrade the quality of various trouble arcas, the latest being the search-

ing look into the

situation within the CS

Mir. Wheeler is a searching individual who is totally com-

mitted to the Plans Directorate and has the high regard of most of the

elements comprising the Clandestine Series:

I thought that from a broad, general standpoint the orientation was worthwhile

There was too much of "we think thie la what BOB meang" and too litile of

BOB saying "thia is what we mean". I found the movle presentation of Dr. E.

It is against this perspectivo that Subjeet's performance

evaluated.

He approached his job

with

enthusiasm

and vigor but soon

found that there were no

tangible operational activities he could

devote himself or his

supporting agents to.

He has been frank' to

state officially and

inofficially

the absence of any targets to which an operational

base could direct itself and has therefore been relatively

spite of the fact that there were only a few specific targets

on whom they could systematleally work.

Subject is a mature;

experienced and energetic officer

with both operational and scholarly Interests in Far Eastern,

His talents are obviously being

have him reassigned.

The base itself will be phased down in

Re Parzraph C - Preferenco for Next Ausignment:

1. I would like. te strte that wile a tour at Headouartery

should be ny preference I believe that for mo to leave my cur-

rent assignment at this time for even one year would not be in

the best interosts of either NocK or coYOkt..

Thorefore; I'

requost homo leave, with approdmately one montil at Headquarters

for requested training and refresher work and one month of leavo,

returning to current assignment for at least an additional tro

year tour with the proviso that after the first your tha

situa

tion be re-cruined with the ultimate riew of possibly at that

point considoring a tic jo tow it leadguarters.

I foel that I

have been able to provide a certrin degice oi intelligence con-

tinutty rhich could bo spoiled by a tro-year break.

Tienlizing

that career-rise I should spid at loast one tour at, Heargunrters

In the Piture, I believe thnt, despile possible reflections

against my career, that tro venr period should be delayed until

3o I belleve that by experionce, training and inclination

I can better serve lara in this country in the type of work in
