CHAIRMAN TUNHEIM: Thank you very much,

Mr. Tilley. We appreciate your continued help. .
MR. TILLEY: My pleasure, Mr. Chairman.
CHAIRMAN TUNHEIM: Next, we have two
representatives from the Central Intelligence
Agency here today, to provide factual testimony for
the board on the nature of the sequestered
collection, Mr. John Pereira and Mr. Barry

-|/ Harrelson.

And because this is primarily a factual
presentation, we decided that we should put each of
you under oath. So, if you would, raise your right
hand and repeat after me.

{John Pereira and Barry Harrelson sworn.]
CHAIRMAN TUNHEIM: . Thank you for joining

1B today. .

MR. PEREIRA:. A pleasure. We’re pleased
to try to help and provide information that might |
help the board understand the sequestered
‘collection. I thought, if the time allows, I might
tgive some background to put the sequestered

collection in context for the board.

CHAIRMAN TUNHEIM: That would be very

jhelpful. —

MR. PEREIRA: In the spring of 1992, prior
to the enactment of the Assassination Records Act,
the then-Director of Central Intelligence, Robert
Gates, issued instructions to begin reviewing for
declassification all records related to the
assassination. ,

The. CIA history staff was charged with
identifying the relevant records, which they did.
lAnd -once that happened, our group that we
represent, the historical review group, took
custody of the records and immediately began
reviewing them for declassification for release to
the National Archives.

o Ojice the Records Act was passed, our goal
became to release as many records as possible by
fthe 22 August 1993 deadline established by the Act.
And approximately 125,000 pages were transferred to
the National Archives. by that date.

: With subsequent releases, the Agency has

now declassified and transferred some 227,000 pages

MILLER REPORTING .CO., INC.
507 C STREET, N.E.
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20002
(202) 546-6666


23
to the National Archives. And based on discussions
with the Board, we’re trying to release additional
information that had been redacted earlier:

The remaining records are in various

stages of review. Some require review by other

fagencies. Some is congressional material. And
final decisions on other records are awaiting

| discussion with the board, as you know.

The Kennedy assassination records in the
CIA consist of two major groups of files.

One group consists of the documents in the
Lee Harvey Oswald file, sometimes referred to as

|] the Oswald 201 file. These consist mainly of
documents that were collected after the

} assassination and during the Warren Commission

= rinvestigation. And there are about 26,000 pages of

declassified and sent to the National archives.
The second group is one of major interest
to you today; I think. It’s comprised of the
sequestered collection. These are records that

were made available to the House Select Committee

MILLER REPORTING CO., INC.
507 C STREET, N.E.
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20002
(202) 546-6666


13-00000

24
| on Assassination and which the committee asked CIA
to hold in -safekeeping upon the completion of the

committee’s investigation.

And there are certain additional records,
including 400 excerpts from the minutes of the
| director of Central Intelligence morning meetings
| ana some working files that have been added since
Jag92. But that’s pretty much the landscape of the
records- we have.

By going directly to the sequestered
collection, I'd like to say that, first of all,
every document in the sequestered collection was
available to the board for review. Every document
is available in full to the board without
| redactions.

7 A’ portion of the documents that were

lcreated specifically in response to requests from
the House Assassination Committee are in the

|xecord. Other records were already in existence

prior to the creation of the committee. And still
other documents were created by the committee

itself. For example, there: are notes of interviews

507 C STREET, N.E.
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20002
(202) 546-6666


13-00000

25

conducted by the committee's staff.

So, these are the three categories: those
created for the committee at their request; others
that existed that we provided to them at their

| request; and others that the committee itself
created.

Now, within the sequestered collection,
there are two major categories of records. This is
eee -}a.simple breakdown. I hope this is helpful. one
|}category consists of about 129,000 pages of hard
copy. The second category consists of 72 reels of
|microfilm or the equivalent of 163,000 pages of
hard copy.

Now, the question has come up of why the
documents were sequestered. And this is explained
rin a Memorandum of Understanding, -signed by the
chairman of the Assassination Committee and the
idirector of Central Intelligence. And I Have a
| copy here to submit to the board.

: The memorandum states that, "Upon
termination of the Committee, all materials

provided by CIA and examined by the Committee will

v

em 26

be kept and preserved within a segregated and

| secure area within CIA for at least 30 years,
unless the DCI and the House of Representatives
agree to a shorter period of time."

In April 1979, Robert Blakey, the chief
| counsel and staff director of the Assassinations
Committee, visited CIA headquarters; and: he
completed the process of designating what materials
were to-be- sequestered. All the- documents made
available to the Assassination Committee were
included in this sequestered collection.

The second question that often comes up
is, where did we get authority to start reviewing
these records prior to the Assassination Act? And
}this goes back to my point about Robert Gates
Jwanting to get started as quickly as possible in
the "review and declassification.

1- So, the Agency wrote to the Speaker of the
| House, Thomas Foley, in 1992, requesting approval
| to begin declassifying and releasing the records.
And in October of that year, Speaker Foley wrote a

letter to the director, granting CIA the authority

MILLER REPORTING CO., INC.
507 C STREET, N.E.
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20002
(202) 546-6666


27
to do so.

The Speaker's decision was clearly made in

anticipation of passage of the Assassination
Records Collection Act. So, we have the records,
jand we started processing.

Within the two categories that I
mentioned, the hard. copy material is one. And we
have a page describing that for the board, which
!t/11 leave with you. This includes copies of most
of the CIA: documents and the Oswald 201 file that I
| referred to earlier.

Also included in the hard copy are other
|) 202 files, pérsonnel files, security files on
persons who are. mentioned in documents relevant to
the assassination or who figure in one of the

conspiracy ,theories.

By

This part, the hard copy, also includes
about 30,000 pages of documents, memos, and notes

-- many of these, handwritten -- that were created

by the Assassination Committee itself. So, those
H.

are in the hard copy.
-

Now, the microfilm portion of the

MILLER REPORTING CO., INC.
507 C STREET, N.E.
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20002
(202) 546-6666


28
sequestered collection, as I mentioned, contains 72

Jreels of microfilm. Incidentally, we found very

easy, so we arranged to have all of the microfilm

Hprinted out in hard copy. So, we have both; and
both of these are available to the board, both the
| microfilm itself and the printout.

The decision to microfilm was apparently
|} based on two malo considerations, as far as we can
| determine from our records. First, the integrity
of-the sequestered records had to be maintained.

| Second, a number of the files that the
Assassination Committee requested were active
files, and had to be available to allow people to
continue conducting their normal activities within

* Fthe _ Agency.

a So, the solution was to replace certain
records with microfilm versions. And these records
were microfilmed during 1979 and 1980 with the
approval ef the Assassinations Committee. And we

|have memos for the records showing how that

happened, so that you will have the history on

507 C STREET, N.E.
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20002
(202) 546-6666


13-00000

29
that.

Now, looking at the content. of the

microfilm, a sizeable portion of this -- probably
50 percent -- duplicates the hard copy in the
sequestered files. For example, there are 12 reels
of material from the Oswald 201 file.

The bulk of the reels consists of files on
individuals and organizations, including personnel
files of CIA employees. There are also a number of
files on anti-Castro organizations. All but a
small percentage are CIA-originated cables, or
dispatches, or memoranda and other documents.

In looking at the microfilm, we believe
there are questions: of privacy that the board may
want to consider in determining what information is

to be reléased. Some of the records, for example,
» pe

contain medical information on an individual.

There are also questions of relevancy that
we suggest the board consider. For example, many
of the documents cover sensitive activities that go
far beyond the time frame of the assassination or

>

investigations into the assassination.

That‘s rather brief; but I hope this is

useful to the board in trying to understand the
sequestered documents, sometimes called segregated
documents. We use those terms interchangeably.
And we certainly look forward to continuing
cooperating with the board, with the goal of
releasing as much information as possible to the
American public.

CHAIRMAN TUNHEIM: Very well. Mr.
Harrelson, do have anything to add?

MR. HARRELSON: No.

CHAIRMAN TUNHEIM: Questions on the part
of the board?. Dr. Joyce.

DR. JOYCE: Mr. Pereira, you mentioned
that SO percent of the microfilm appears to
luplicate “what already exists in hard copy. You
mentioned the 201 file as an example of that.
Maybe I missed it, but could you
characterize perhaps the portion that appears not
“fhto be duplicated in hard copy? Do you have any
information about that?

MR. PEREIRA: The types of material that

isn’t duplicative?

DR. JOYCE: Yes.

MR. HARRELSON: This is where you get into
the 201 files which make up the bulk of the
microfilm, and it covers the areas of individuals
who were not -- or areas of their careers that were
not involved in the assassination periods. So,
there would not be documents from there in the hard
copy.

Most of the hard copy, apparently, was
created as the HSC staffers asked for particular
information. They would look at a file, and ask
for copies of it. The ultimate was one cable,
where we found 43 copies. So, most of it -- I
would say, every document is duplicated at least
once, and-used at multiple times throughout the
eerie an

DR. JOYCE: And it would appear, then,
that most of the information within the 201 file --

MR. HARRELSON: The other area of unique
information is the Cuban exile activities. Much

more in the microfilm than in the hard copy.

collection. And most of that was released in
August ‘94.

CHAIRMAN TUNHEIM: Other questions?

MS. NELSON: How much have you been able
to look at this sequestered file? It’s enormous.
It boggles the mind, going through 72 reels of

microfilm. No wonder you printed hard copy. But I

would imagine you’ve only done. some sampling.

MR. HARRELSON: With. the exception of the
201 file -- the duplicate microfilm 201 file and
the -- Well, that’s the only exception.-- We have
looked at every page of material.

MS. NELSON: Do you have a sense of what's

not, in your view, an assassination record?. Are

there certain percentages or certain numbers of

those? ‘s
Ore,

MR. PEREIRA: I think we need to defer to
the board on that. We’re suggesting certain --
MS. NELSON: Yes. That’s what --

MR. PEREIRA: -- questions that the board

may address, but we are deferring completely to you

in interpreting the law. And, so, we‘re assuming

cm 33

|that every piece of paper we have that was
sequestered is potentially relevant. au

MS. NELSON: Under the ‘statute, we'll have
to see what that is.

MR. PEREIRA: Yes, following the statute.

CHAIRMAN. TUNHEIM: Any further questions?

DR. HALL: . John, do vou know what of these
materials the HSCA used and didn’t use?

MR. PEREIRA: There‘s 4 -- I‘11 let Barry
| comment on this, as well. There's a little bit of
uncertainty. To go back, every record that we made
| available to the committee is in the sequestered
collection.

Some of. the indications are that there was
a very thorough review, obviously, by the committee
ef a lot of records. My impression is that, for
Stioy eccocis the committee staff requested
ertain files. We provided an entire file -- let‘’s
say, on an individual.

But the committee staff may have said,
“Well, this really isn’t all that relevant to our

’
work, but thank you. We now know who that person

507 C STREET, N.E.
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20002
(202) 546-6666


34
is, because someone suggested this person may have
been involved, and we needed to check that name."

And in. checking the name, we get the
impression very quickly they determined they didn't
Rave to read every single paper in the file. It’s
that sort of breakdown, I think.

MR. HARRELSON: There are indications, as
you go through the microfilm, that some of the
files were not reviewed. There is-a sheet for
these files signed by the staffers, and the
notations there. We have never -- Since we were
viewing the file as a whole, we never went through
and calculated which one of these it indicated they
had reviewed or not.

DR. HALL: And was it the case, or were

there instances that you’re aware of, where they

tea

HSCA staff and/or related individuals marked on
these documents or dealt with them in a way other
than merely reading them?

, MR. HARRELSON: The 30,000 pages,
frequently are handwritten notes taken from the

documents. Since the hard copy -- or in copies

|made available today, you sometimes find notations,
their names written on them -- different things.
MR. PEREIRA: But they seem to have made
Hvery thorough notes on documents that they found.
were valuable.

DR. HALL: Did the CIA,. in providing these
materials, put any restrictions on them with regard
leo copying that could be done?

MR.. PEREIRA: By the committee itself, you

DR. HALL: Yes.

MR. PEREIRA: I.don‘’t know what the. record

MR. HARRELSON: They were held in one
central. location -- all notes -- for review. The
staffers,as I understand it, would come and review
these files, makes their notes. And the notes

would then be reviewed by, -- at least, by a staff

MR. PEREIRA: There was an arrangement

whereby, if they wanted to use a record elsewhere

S07 C STREET, N.E.
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20002
(202) 546-6666


36

for some reason or other, there was a means for
making that available to them; possibly, by
redacting something extremely sensitive, like the
name of an agent. But they could --

DR. HALL: I see.

MR. PEREIRA: But they could make the
arrangement to have them use the document.

DR. HALL: Congress has less than a
distinguished history in handling some documents of
a classified nature, and there is this kind of
problem. As document hunters, there’s sort of an
interesting problem -- the extent of which, we get
unauthorized copying made; and then those. documents
are out there somewhere else.

But that’s a side show to this. So, thank

eeu very much.
