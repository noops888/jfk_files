; - 26 NOV 1968

Dear Charlos,

Thank you for your letter of 15 October
recommp@uding against the declassification of
Warren Commission document GS-37). I might
mention that our daqeiry to you in August (1963)
was in anticipation of further pressure for the
release of Warren Commission papers, & pressure
which has not materialized. Accordingly, there is
not, at the preseat tiae, any intention to release
co=972.

Should the question be raised at soze future
time, the points aade by you in your letter provide
every reasoa to keep the document out of the
public domain,

With kindest regards,
. Sineerely,
7s] Richard Helms
