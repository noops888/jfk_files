Dear John: i

Barry Harrelson has asked that we request in writing your assistance in helping us
obtain access to records from the Intelligence Community Staff for the period from June
1963 through December 1964. Although our ultimate interest will be determining
whether there are any assassination records included among ICS holdings, we would at
this time appreciate obtaining a more general idea of its indices and holdings,
particularly with respect to: (a) identifiable assassination records; (b) staff activities
during the month following the assassination, (c) Cuba, (d) Mexico, and (e) the Soviet
Union.

We would be pleased to discuss with you ways in which we might better refine this
request.

Thank you for your assistance.
Sincerely,

DQ (Vv_£

and will request further information, if necessary, from CIA. CIA needs to
do nothing further at this time.

be made available by December, 1995. CLA now agrees to make the

where the basis for the request is unclear. CIA will begin to make’
histories available on a rolling basis. Review Board has agreed to review
histories promptly once they are made available. Although it was not
discussed at our meeting, we would very much appreciate it if you would,
within the next two weeks, identify which histories you are prepared to
make available and those that CIA believes should be subject to further
discussions.

Cram’s multi-volume counterintelligence history. Although Cram’ ‘s

history was not specifically discussed at our meeting, the Review. Board-~-~

staff awaits its being made available.
