Re:

ARRB Request for Additional Information and Records No. CIA-8

Dear John:

Barry Harrelson has asked that we request in writing your assistance in helping us

obtain access to records from the Intelligence Community Staff for the period from June

1963 through December 1964. Although our ultimate interest will be determining

whether there are any assassination records included among ICS holdings, we would at

this time appreciate obtaining a more general idea of its indices and holdings,

particularly with respect to: (a) identifiable assassination records; (b) staff activities

during the month following the assassination, (c) Cuba, (d) Mexico, and (e) the Soviet

Union.

We would be pleased to discuss with you ways in which we might better refine this

request.

Thank you for your assistance.

Sincerely,

Sione

Re:

Status of Assassination Records Review Board Requests to CIA for

Additional Information and Records

Dear Barry:

I am writing to memorialize our conversation of October 1 regarding the status of

Assassination Records Review Board requests for information and records from the

CIA.

We discussed the following formal requests:.

CIA-1 (Organization materials)

CIA has made records available to the Review Board. The Review Board

staff will continue its review and make recommendations to the Board

and will request further information, if necessary, from CIA. CIA needs to

do nothing further at this time.

CIA-2-5 Complete

CIA-6 (Cables and dispatches)

CIA originally informed the Review Board staff that these materials could

be made available by December, 1995. CIA now agrees to make the

records available (or to have a response) by the first of November, 1996.

CIA-7 (Histories)

Mexico City. CIA has shown the Mexico City history to Gunn. CLA will

compile the portion of the history that was shown to G. Robert Blakey,

which will be processed as an assassination record. Gunn will then

determine whether there are any additional portions of the history that

should be added to the Blakey version. CIA will compile the "Blakey

version" as soon as possible and Gunn will promptly thereafter review the

documents.

Index. CIA has made an index available to Review Board staff and the

staff has identified certain histories that may be appropriate for review.

CIA will make available those histories that are of obvious relevance, and

will raise with Review Board staff any questions regarding the requests

where the basis for the request is unclear. CIA will begin to make

histories available on a rolling basis. Review Board has agreed to review

histories promptly once they are made available. Although it was not

discussed at our meeting, we would very much appreciate it if you would,

within the next two weeks, identify which histories you are prepared to

make available and those that CIA believes should be subject to further

discussions.

Cram's multi-volume counterintelligence history. Although Cram's

history was not specifically discussed at our meeting, the Review Board

staff understands that the history has been located and the Review Board

staff awaits its being made available.

CIA-8 (Intelligence community staff)

•CIA will provide a report to the Review Board staff within two weeks.

CIA-9 (Publications and analytical materials)

The Review Board staff provided CIA with a list of certain publications as

they appear in an LBJ Library finding aid. CIA will report back on

recommended action to the Review Board promptly.

CIA-10 (Interagency source register)

CIA has compiled information responsive to the request. CIA will make

records available within two weeks.

CIA-11 (Duran's original statement)
