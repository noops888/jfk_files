Status of Document:

Postponed in Part

Number of releases of previously postponed information: 20

Select Committee on Assassinations

W.S. House of Representatives

3342 HOUSE OFFICE BUILDING, ANNEX 2

WASHINGTON, D.C. 20515

March 24, 1977

Mr •

Kenneth E. Brooten

3301 N.W. 27th Terrace

Gainsville, Florida

Dear Mr. Brooten:

32601

The Committee has decided to accept your letter of

resignation dated March 8th. As stated in your March 8th

letter, the Committee accepts your resignation effective

that date.

As a consequence of this Committee action, you

may disregard the letter mailed by myself to you on March 8,

1977.

Your letter of March 8, 1977, also requested reimburse-

ment for certain phone calls and restoration of the pay re-

ductions you agreed to for January and February of 1977. The

Committee will reimburse you for the phone calls, which you

represent were made in pursuit of Committee business.

enclosed a voucher for $40.24, the total of the listed calls,

for your signature.

If you sign and return the voucher to me,

I shall sign and forward it to the House Administration Committee

so that you may be paid.

In the Committee's view, however, you have no valid claim

for restoration of your voluntary pay reduction for January and

February of 1977. Among other reasons for this is that there

never was a firm commitment that the lost pay would be restored.

Furthermore, at the very least, a condition for you to receive

the lost pay was that you would be on the payroll in April and

a sufficient number of subsequent months to enable you to recoup

it via a temporary pay increase during that period. You were

fully aware that if it was decided to restore the lost pay, this

tive March 8, and by your own action will not be on the payroll.

in April, the Committee does not believe you are entitled to re-

storation of your voluntary pay reduction.

If you wish to discuss any of these matters further, please

contact me.

Singerely,

Louls Stokes

shas tations

U. S. House of Representatives

Washington, D. C. 20515

Dear Mr. Chairman:

I submit herewith my resignation from the staff of the House Select Committee

on Assassianations effective this date or at such time hereafter as the Members of

the Select Committee shall determine to be fair and equitable. I resign as a matter

of professional principle and not out of the belief that the investigations should

not be continued by some appropriate body.

The attention of the Members of the Select Committee is respectfully directed

to the fact that on or about January 11, 1977, while acting within the course and

scope of his employment as an agent, ostensible agent, servant or employee of the

House Select Committee on Assassinations, the current chief counsel and staff director

Richard A. Sprague, represented to the staff during the course of a staff meeting

that if certain staff members were to accept a 35 percent reduction in pay that he

(Sprague) would see that such staff members were reimbursed the full amount of the

decrease in pay. In justifiable reliance upon the representations of your agent, I

continued to render professional services to the House Select Cormittee which accepted

such services.

I understand that there is an admission of Mr. Sprague's representations

in the record of the Committee proceedings for Monday, March 6, 1977. I bring this

matter to your attention so the Committee, while a duly constituted legal body may

take appropriate action to restore the pay reductions for January and February, 1977.

Of course, if the matter can be resolved equitably then litigation may be avoided.

Also enclosed herewith are copies of telephone bills which I incurred while

performing official duties as Acting Staff Director and Chief Counsel for the Select •

Committee under former Chairman Henry B. Gonzalez. I trust this voucher will be

processed promptly so I will be reimbursed for my actual expenses.

I shall look forward to hearing from you as to the matter of the restoration

of my January and February, 1977, reduction in pay so I may take appropriate action.

I appreciated having had an opportunity to serve on the staff of the Select Committee.

With kindest regards, I am

10 March 1977

The Honorable Louis Stokes, Chairman

House Select Committee on Assassinations

U.S. House of Representatives

Washington, D.C. 20515

Dear Mr. Chairman:

Enclosed herewith is a copy of a letter which was mailed

o my former law firm in Gainesville, Florida on Monday,

March 7, 1977 and which was received

on Wednesday, March 9,

1977 at 2:00 P.M.

On Tuesday, March 8, 1977, immediately following the

acceptance by the House of Representatives of Chairman Gonzalez's

resignation, I mailed you my formal resignation from the staff

of the Select Committee, a copy of which is also enclosed.

On Sunday, March 6, 1977, having completed my final reports

to former Chairman Gonzalez,

I moved all of my possessions from

my apartment and flew to Florida.

A number of people in

Washington knew I was leaving Washington and resigning from

the .Committee.

I was not going to tender my formal resignation

until such time as the House accepted the resignation of

Leaving to

Mr. Gonzalez for to do so would leave Mr. Gonzalez without

counsel. Since I had decided to resign immediately upon the

acceptance by the House of the resignation of Mr. Gonzalez,

I saw no reason to stay in Washington where the Committee was

to hold a meeting as my presence at that point would simply

On Wednesday, March 9, 1977, at 12:15 P.M., I learned

from Congressman Gonzalez's office that the Select Committee

held a special meeting on Tuesday, March 8, 1977 for the sole

purpose of firing me notwithstanding the fact that my resig-

nation was already in the mail to you and that the letter which

I received on March 9th directed me to report to the Committee

offices that same day.

It is implicit in Mr. Lewis' letter that since I was not

in the staff offices since February 9, 1977 that I was not

performing duties for the Select Committee. Enclosed for your

information is

a copy of a telegram which I received from former

Chairman Gonzalez on February 11, 1977.

As you are no doubt

aware, both at the request of former Chairman Gonzalez as well

as Congressman Richardson Preyer, Congressman Walter Fauntroy

Docld:32243282 Page 10

## Page 11

The Honorable Louis Stokes, Chairman

March 10, 1977

and Congressman Christopher Dodd, I did not go to the Committee

staff offices so as not to cause

unnecessary confrontations.

However, I enclose herewith copies of correspondence between

myself and Richard Sprague and Majority Leader Wright relating

to my continuing efforts to resolve some of the problems

confronting the Select Committee.

I bring this chronology to your attention as well as

the copies of documents which I have enclosed because I

only construe the calling of a special meeting to "fire" me as

= vindictive act on the part of Mr. Sprague, who could have

letermined from a number of sources that I had already

returned

to Florida and intended to submit a formal written resignation,

as I in fact did.

Accordingly: I will appreciate it if you will advise me

as to the following:

compliance with the Rules of the House and the Rules of the

Select Committee and what official action was taken.

(b).

The position of the Committee as to whether my

resignation is accepted or whether I was "fired" and the

effective date of the acceptance of my resignation or my "firing".

I shall look forward to hearing from you. You may feel free

to call me at my home in Florida, 904-372-8021, should you wish

to discuss this matter personally.

With kindest regards, I am

Sincerely,

however, you advised that you would check on the long distance

telephone calls and then I should call you.

called on your behalf at 6:20 p.m., yesterday, I have today

been in contact with the staff

of the Committee on House

Administration to attempt to work

out the details for critical

temporary long distance telephone

service.

In an effort to avoid any unwarranted delay in the

resolution of these most important matters and to avoid

misunderstandings as to the matters which Majority Leader

"right wanted us to discuss, I will very much appreciate it

if you will call me so we can set up an appointment at a

mutually convenient time.

You may contact me at Chairman Gonzalez office - 225-3236

to meet with you during the weekend.

Dear Mr. Wright:

This is in further reference to our meeting of February 24.

1977, at which you requested Mr. Sprague and I to meet to dis-

CUSS

and attempt to resolve certain immediate problems facing

the House Select Committee on Assassinations.

Following that meeting I advised Mr. Sprague that I would

immediately go to the staff offices to meet with him. He de-

clined to meet with me at that time.

On Friday, February 25, 1977, I sent him a letter advising

him that I would be available to meet with him during the entire

weekend. On Sunday, February 27, 1977, I attempted to call him

at the Committee offices, at his residence in Philadelphia, and

finally left a message with his answering service at the water-

gate Apartments here in Washington. I was available all day

Monday in the office of Chairman Gonzalez.

Today, I have again

called Mr. Sprague's secretary at the Committee offices in a

further attempt to meet with him.

In addition to attempting to contact Mr. Sprague, I have

personally gone to the Committee on House Administration on two

occasions to see if temporary long distance telephone service

could be restored on the basis which we discussed at our meeting.

I reluctantly bring this to your attention because I feel

that time is of the essence in resolving the problems confront-

ing the Select Committee. By his failure and refusal to meet

with me he has delayed resolving the problem of how to revain

access to non-classified information in FBI and Secret Service

files. If access can be granted, then Committee staff can con-

tinue

to analyze information in those files.

The simple fact is

The Honorable James Wright

-2-

that if Mr. Sprague was acting in good faith and genuinely

concerned about resolving these problems, he would have con-

tacted me as you requested.

His

failure to do so has result-

ed in unwarranted delays which has seriously impaired the in-

vestigations.

You may be assured that I will continue to work

to resolve these problems.

The Honorable Louis Stokes, Chairman

House Select Committee on Assassiations

U. S. House of Representatives

Washington, D. C. 20515

Dear Mr. Chairman:

I submit herewith my resignation from the staff of the House Select Committee

on Assassinations effective this date or at such time hereafter as the Members of

the select Committee shall determine to be fair and equitable. I resign as a matter

of professional principle and not out of the belief that the investigations shoul

not be continued by some appropriate body.

The attention of the Members of the Select Committee is respectfully directed

to the fact that on or about January 11, 1977, while acting within the course and

scope of his employment as an agent, ostensible agent, servant or employee of the

House Select Conmittee on Assassinations, the current chief counsel and staff director

Richard A. Sprague, represented to the staff during the course of a staff meeting

that if certain staff members were to accept a 35 percent reduction in pay that he

(Sprague) would see that such staff members were reimbursed the full amount of the

decrease in pay.

• In justifiable reliance upon the representations of your agent, I

continued to render professional services to the House Select Committee which accepted

such services. I understand that there is an admission of Mr. Sprague's representations

in the record of the Committee proceedings for Monday, March 6, 1977. I bring this

matter to your attention so the Committee, while a duly constituted legal body may

take appropriate action to restore the pay reductions for January and February, 1977.

a day constited i fellady 71.

Of course, if the matter can be resolved equitably then litigation may be avoided.

Also enclosed herewith are copies of telephone bills which I incurred while w

performing official duties as Acting Staff Director and Chief Counsel for the Select •-

Committee under former Chairman Henry B. Gonzalez. I trust this voucher will be

processed promptly so I will be reimbursed for my actual expenses.

I shall look forward to hearing from you as to the matter of the restoration

of my January and February, 1977, reduction in pay so I may take appropriate action.

I appreciated having had an opportunity to serve on the staff of the Select Committee.

With kindest regards, I am

Sincerely,

Kenneth E. Brooten,
