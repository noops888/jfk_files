Select Committee on Assassinations o
GS. Touse of Representatives

9342 HOUSE OFFICE BUILDING, ANNEX 2
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20515

March 24, 1977

Mr. Kenneth E. Brooten
3301 N.W. 27th Terrace
Gainsville, Florida 32601

Dear Mr. Brooten:

The Committee has decided to accept your letter of
resignation dated March 8th. As stated in your March 8th
letter, the Committee accepts your resignation effective
that date. As a consequence of this Committee action, you
may disregard the letter mailed by myself to you cn March 8,
1977. :

Your letter of March 8, 1977, also requested reimburse-
ment for certain phone calls and restoration of the pay re-
ductions you agreed to for January and February of 1977. The
Committee will reimburse you for the phone calls, which you
represent were made in pursuit of Committee business. I have
enclosed a voucher for $40.24, the total of the listed calls,
for your signature. If you sign and return the voucher to me,

I shall sign and forward it to the House Administration Committee
so that you may be paid.

In the Committee's view, however, you have no valid claim
for restoration of your voluntary pay reduction for January and
February of 1977. Among other reasons for this is that there

-never was a firm commitment that the lost pay would be restored.
Furthermore, at the very least, a condition for you to receive
the lost pay was that you would be on the payroll in April and
a sufficient number of subsequent months to enable you to recoup
it via a temporary pay increase during that period. You were
fully aware that if it was decided to restore the lost pay, this
“was the mechanism to be utilized. Since you have resigned effec-
stive March 8, and by your own action will not be on the payroll
in April, the Committee does not believe you are entitled to re-
storation of your voluntary pay reduction.

If you wish to discuss any of these matters further, please
contact me.

I submit herewith my resignation from the staff of the House Select Committee
on Assassianations effective this date or at such time hereafter as.the Members of
the Select Committee shall determine to be fair and equitable. I resign as a matter
of professional principle and not out of the belief that.the investigations should
not be continued by some appropriate body.

The attention of the Members of the Select Committee is respectfully directed
to the fact that on or about January 11, 1977, while acting within the course and
scope of his employment as an agent, ostensible agent, servant or employee of the
House Select Committee on Assassinations, the current chief counsel and staff director
Richard A. Sprague, represented to the staff during the course of.a staff meeting
that if certain staff members were to accept a 35 percent reduction in pay that he
(Sprague) would see that such staff members were reimbursed the full amount of the
decrease in pay. In justifiable reliance upon the representations of your agent, I
continued to render professional services to the House Select Committee which accepted
such services. I uderstand that there is an admission of Mr. Sprague's representations
in the record of the Committee proceedings for Monday, March 6, 1977.. I bring this
matter to your attention so the Committee, while a duly constituted legal body my =;
take appropriate action to restore the pay reductions for January and February, 1977.
Of course, if the matter can be resolved equitably then litigation may be’ avoided.

The Honorable Louis Stokes, Chairman
House Select Committee on Assassinations
U.S. House of Representatives
Washington, D.C. 20515

Dear Mr. Chairman:

Enclosed herewith is a copy of a letter which was mailed
to my former law firm in Gainesville, Florida on Monday,
March 7, 1977 and which was received on Wednesday, March 9,
1977 at 2:00 P.M.

On Tuesday, March 8, 1977, immediately following the
acceptance by the House of Representatives of Chairman Gonzalez's
resignation, I mailed you my formal resignation from the staff
of the Select Committee, a copy of which is also enclosed.

On Sunday, March 6, 1977, having completed my final reports
to former Chairman Gonzalez, I moved all of my possessions from
my apartment and flew to Florida. A number of people in
Washington knew I was leaving Washington and resigning from
the Committee. I was not going to tender my formal resignation
until such time as the House accepted the resignation of
Mr. Gonzalez for to do so would leave Mr. Gonzalez without
counsel. Since I had decided to resign immediately upon the
acceptance by the House of the resignation of Mr. Gonzalez,

I saw no reason to stay in Washington where the Committee was
to hold a meeting-:aS:my presence at that point would simply
provoke unnecessary confrontation.

On Wednesday, March 9, 1977, at 12:15 P.M., I learned
from Congressman Gonzalez's office that the Select Committee
held a special meeting on Tuesday, March 8, 1977 for the sole
purpose of firing me notwithstanding the fact that my resig-
nation was already in the mail to you and that the letter which
I received on March 9th directed me to report to the Committee
offices that same day.

It is implicit in Mr. Lewis' letter that since I was not
in the staff offices since February 9, 1977 that I was not
| performing duties for the Select Committee. Enclosed for your
information is a copy of a telegram which I received from former
Chairman Gonzalez on February 11, 1977. As you are no doubt
aware, both at the request of former Chairman Gonzalez as well
as Congressman Richardson Preyer, Congressman Walter Fauntroy

and Congressman Christopher Dodd, I did not go to the Committee
staff offices so as not to cause unnecessary confrontations.
However, I enclose herewith copies of correspondence between
myself and Richard Sprague and Majority Leader Wright relating
to my continuing efforts to resolve some of the problems
confronting the Select Committee.

I bring this chronology to your attention as well as
the copies of documents which I have enclosed because I can
only construe the calling of a special meeting to "fire" me as
a vindictive act on the part of Mr. Sprague, who could have
determined from a number of sources that I had already returned
to Florida and intended to submit a formal written resignation,
as I in fact did.

Accordingly, I will. appreciate it if you will advise me
as to the following:

(a) Whether a meeting of the Select Committee was held
on Tuesday, March 8, 1977, and if so, was that meeting held in
compliance with the Rules of the House and the Rules of the
Select Committee and what. official action was taken.

(b) The position of the Committee as to whether my
resignation is accepted or whether I was "fired" and the
effective date of the acceptance of my resignation or my "firing".

I shall look forward to hearing from you. You may feel free
to call me at my home in Florida, 904-372-8021, should you wish
to discuss this matter personally.

With kindest regards, I am

Sincerely,
Gelb

Dear Dick:

This is in reference to our meeting with the Honorable
James Wright, House Majority Leader on Thursday, February 24,
1977, It was my clear understanding that Mr. Wright wanted
you and I to meet to discuss and clarify the following matters.

1. Temporary long distance telephone calls to be billed
to his office number - 225-8040.

Os The actual expenditures for the Select Committee for
January, 1977, as well as the estimated expenditures
for February, 1977.

So Vouchers for December, 1976,

4, Arrangements to provide access to non-classified FBI
and Secret. Service files.

| 5. Forms for Subpoenas,

_ 6. Establishment of a petty cash fund and designation of
a custodian,

Uo Any other matters which are of an immediate necessity
for the orderly operation of the Select Committee.

As you know, following the meeting I offered to immediately
come to the staff offices with you to discuss these matters,
however, you advised that you would check on the long distance
telephone calls and then I should call you.

February 25, 1977

Following my conversation with Alvin B. Lewis, who
called on your behalf at 6:20 p.m., yesterday, I have today
been in contact with the staff of the Committee on House
Administration to attempt to work out the details for critical
temporary long distance telephone service.

In an effort to avoid any unwarranted delay in the
resolution of these most important matters and to avoid
misunderstandings as to the matters which Majority Leader
Wright wanted us to discuss, I will very much appreciate it
if you will call me so we can set up an appointment at a
mutually convenient time.

You may contact me at Chairman Gonzalez office - 225-3236
until 5:00 p.m, today. I will also be available and most happy
to meet with you during the weekend. If you cannot reach me
at Chairman Gonzalez office, please do not hesitate to contact
me at my residence. My residence telephone number is: 546-5126.

I shall. look forward to hearing from you. © With kindest

Dear Mr. Wright:

This is in further reference to our meeting of February 24,
1977, at which you requested Mr. Sprague and.I to meet to’ dis-
cuss and attempt ‘to resolve certain immediate problems facing
the House Select Committee on Assassinations.

Following that meeting I advised Mr. Sprague that I would
immediately go to the staff offices to meet with him. He de-
clined to meet with me at that time.

On Friday, February 25, 1977, I sent hima letter advising
him that I would be available to meet with him during the entire

| : weekend. On Sunday, February 27, 1977, I attempted to call him

! at the Committee offices, at his residence in Philadelphia, and
i | finally left a message with his answering service at the Water-

i gate Apartments here in Washington. I was available all day
Monday in the office of Chairman Gonzalez. Today, I have again
called Mr. ‘Sprague's secretary at the Committee offices in-a <-
further attempt to meet with him.

In addition to attempting to contact Mr. Sprague, I. have
personally gone to the Committee on House Administration on two
occasions to see if temporary long distance telephone service
could be restored on the basis which we discussed at our meeting.

I reluctantly bring this to your attention because I feel
that time is of the essence in resolving the problems confront-—
ing the Select Committee. By his failure and refusal to meet
with me he has delayed resolving the problem of how to reyain
access to non-classified information in FBI and Secret Service
files. If access can be granted, then Committee staff can con-
tinue to analyze information in those files. The simple fact is

vestigations. You may be assured that I will continue to work

to resolve these problems.
