1. The Station feels that perhaps we understated the degree
of concealment as outlined in reference B. It Is ayreed that a
sophisticated technical search would probably find the device we
planted but al! personnel at the Station involved with this operation

“ e3reed that such @ search wes mast unlikely. The case officer

dealing directly with LIRING=3 also minimized the possibility of
LIRING*3 meking any kind of a search. All of these points were
considered before making the Installation.

2. At the moment, we do not feel there is enauoh reason to
jusctity the rises invoiveos in anotiier surreptitious entry. We
will however remaln alert and be prepared to take corrective action.

1, In reviewing the traffic for the reriod indicated sowton found
valuable confirmation of iI211G/3 end LIKING/4 contact sith Rasiro

Abreu, indicating thay both persons complied with Kewter's suggestions. .
LIkIKG/3'o telephonic contacts with <erique Morales in Guaterala City

The only item not reportec to iowton by LIKInG/3 is'a aizner engaye-

ment which Mnrique Horales bad in Custemala City on 25/4/67? with "friends"
of Morales’ wife, Ssperenza. SA-10 (17.5) also reveals that LIALG/3
and Horalos are engaged in some sort of deal for the purchase of strses
or briefcases (bolsas) either in Guctemals or 5an Cristé3al for resale

in Mexico City or iznort inte the U. et a higher price. (LIRING/3
aeatioued tae opportunivies in this line to iiowton previcusly, but Zov—
ton did not react favorably).

2. The following are Xowton’s comments on specific portions of tha tae
which will serve to clarify them in relationship to reports nade to him
by LIRING/3 ond LININd/41

LIRING/4 Contacts with Rasiro Abreu: On 22/4/67, shortly after dovtou
suggested that LISING/4 recontact Abreu and attempt to effect tarough
him a reconciliation with the local mission, LIKING/4 telephoned the
Hmbassy and attazpted to receh Abreu, Fron the content end tons :f ber
questions and resarks, it appears obvious that LIu. G/& has not hed re-
cent contact with the Cuban mission. She oaks when Abreu is leaving for
Mavana, but is given no information. Sho tries* again at about 1960 and
"2000, but tkpre is no ansver, she finally sets through to Abreu on
14=13=26 who proaizes to come to her home between 1000 end 14100 the
following day (23/4/67). She has to give Abvreu-the acdress, indica.ing

The only item not reported to Rowton by LIRING/3 is a dinner engeze-

ment which Enrique Horales had in Guetemala City on 25/4/67 with “friends”
of Morales' wife, Zsperanza. SAN-10 (17.5) also reveals that i7=THG/3 :
end Morales are engaged in some sort of deal for the purchase of purses

or briefcases (bolsas) either in Guatemala or San Cristébal for resale

in Mexico City or import into the U.S. at a higher price. (LIEBIEZ/3
mentioned the opportunities in this line to Rowton previously, D=3 Row-

ton did not react favorably). i

2. The following are Rowton's comments on specific portions of tze take
which will serve to clarify them iu relationship to reports made to him
by LIRING/3 and LIRING/4:

LIRING/4 Contacts with Ramiro Abreu: On 22/4/67, shortly after Zowton
suggested that LIRING/4 recontact Abreu and attempt to effect tarovgh

him a reconciliation with the local mission, LIRING/4 telephczed the
Embassy and attampted to reach Abreu. From the content and tone of her
questions and remarks, it appears cbvious thet LIRING/4 has net had re-
cent contact with the Cuban mission. She asxs when Abreu is leaving for
Havana, but is given no information. She tries sgain at about 1900 and
2000, but there is no answer. She finally gets through to Abrez on
44-13-26 who promises to come to her home between 1000 and 1406 the

in substance by LIRING/3, although Rowton bas not as yet had a chance
to talk directly with LIRING/% to get her version of the conversations
with Abreu. Apparently in order to put Abreu off (in bis amomous de-
signs) LIRING/4 tedle him on 25/4/67 that her husband suspects that
sorething is going on between them. In reply to Abreu's enxious ques-
tioning, LIRING/4 states that her husband asked her whether she liked
Abreu and whether Abreu like her, to which she said that the replied in
the affirmative (this apparently wes calculated to cool Abreu off
without alicnating him), Abreu's visit to the ppartment and his pro-
poed luncheon date with LIRING/3 were confimmed by the latter in his
report to Rowton on 27/4/67.

Conversaticns Re the Birth Certificate: In SAN-10 (2.5) IIRING/3 asks
hie Guatemalan friend (Jacobo xcdriguez Padilla?) whether it matters if
the birth certificate ts for a person 10 years older? Jacobo replied

in the negative, but would prefer it of a person ten years younger.LI-
RING/3 promises to have the birth certificate in his possession by
25-26/4/67. This is the first confirmation Rowton has hed of a state-
ment made to him some two weeks previously that when he went to pick up
the (false) birth certizicate at Registro Civil on instructions of his
half-brother (and the lawyer Rolendo Riojas) he discoversd that it was
for a person born in 1946 and hence useless for binsell. LIRIRG/3 also
reported to Rowton that Jacobo had contacted bim recently and asked for
help in obtaining false papers for himself. The above conversation
therefore would indicste thet LIRING/3 plans to give Jacobo the false
document originally procured for himself through his half-brother. LI-
RING/3, however, has not revealed this plan to Rowton.

SAN-~11 (16.0) reveals that LIAING/3 informed his brother two days later
that he has spent over ten days at Registro Civil but it 4s “impossible
to get the birth certificate. The book no longer exigsts." He adds that
he has written his half-brother a letter explaining everything. LIRING/3
reported to Rowton that he had asked his half-brother to obtain an
"acta notorial" in lieu of brita certificate and hoped to have the doca-

ment soon,

TDY REPORT FOR
Joseph ¥. RESCIGNO
11-20 May 1967

*

Site: Mexico City, Mexico

Dates: 11-20 May 1967

Objective: The purpose of the trip by RESCIGNO was to
provide support to the station on two priority audio
operations (set up the LIRING/3 LP and the LIRUSTIC/1
installation). This support was provided in addition
to the TDY support beinz rendered by Reginald S. JEMHON
a replacement for CORNBURY who was on sick leave.

Chronology:

RESCIGNO departed Kational Airport for Mexico City
via American Airlines at 0800, 11 May 1967 and arrived
in Mexico City at 1400, ll May 1967 (all times local).
After checking into the Palace Hotel, R. reported to
the Station by telephone. Station contact was made
through SLINKARD who advised R. to come into the Station.
R. discussed relative target priorities and then met
with the respective case officers concerned with the
operations. The rest of the day was spent checking out
equipment for possible use on the LIRUSTIC/1 operation.
The following day was spent planning and becoming familiar
with the LIRUSTIC/1 operational situation, infiltrating
equipment into the bause/LP and setting up a cover story.

No operational work was planned for the above
operation for the weekend; therefore, the LIRING/3 LP
equipment was checked out and the LP equipment set up
in the LP on Saturday. The equireent used was a T-204
Revere Recorder (110 VAC, 50 cycle) and an SPR-2A
carrier current receiver. The occupant of the LP was ©
briefed in the operation of the equipment. There ras
ho conversation in the LP during the briefing; consequently,
R. planned to return the following week to determine
relative reference levels of nll control settings to
assist the LP operator in making his recordings, Sutry
into the target to inspect the installation was not
considered operationnlly possible over the weekend and
the case officer made plans with the LP operator for a

meeting Inter in the week.

Monday through Thursday of the following week was
devoted to the LIRUSTIC/} installztion which is the
subject cf a separate report.

RESCIGNO purchased 2 telephore locally to be used
as a replacenent for 2 cefective instrument in the LP
for the DMARGO operation. The existing telephone
extension was malfunctioning aud would ring only inter-
mittently. Since the LP had some extra telephone cnblea
terminating at the house, the case officer did not want
to request a normal telephone company gervice call,

Thursday evening, 18 May 1967, wes scheduled for
testing the two installations that were completed on
the LISAMPAN operation; however, upon reporting the
successful installation in the LIZUSTIC/1 target,
RESCIGNO was informed that the telephone conpany was to
bs vorsins th: d4etrébution box where the loop
connections were to be nade. Consequently, the testing
of the installetions was postponed until the telephone
company personnel complete their vork in the aren.

On Friday morning, the LISING/3 LP was again
visited to check the operation of the equipment and
to establish relative reference levels for the operator
to obtain optimum results. The target was occupied and
a recording vas made of a telephone cal: and a discussion
with a book salcaman. The operation of the equipment
wos satisfactory, The technical details of the target
installation were thoroushly reviewed in consideration
of the operational situation. The case officer was
pletely satisfied that the type of installation was
ae: dtely adequate {zon 2 security standpoint in this
particular situation. The target equipment was
functioning normally with no technical problems; there-
fore, a re-entry into the target was not considered
necessary, CORNBURY expressed a gimilar view when the
operation was discussed vith him that afternoon.

‘The page-boy systen was discussed with the Station
and RESCIGNO was informed that tests had been made and
it was decided to install a higher gain antenna to
reach outlying areas. The Station plans to put the
system into operation as soon as the entenna is received
and installed.

The LP for the LIRUSTIC/1 installation was set up
“on Friday on the trip frou the Station to the airport.
‘Y returned to the Station on Friday afternoon

----- at 1436, RESCIGNO departed the saze evening at 1800

_ becauge he was unable to obtain reservations for the

return trip on Saturday or Sunday. This was caused by
the holiday rush and RESCIGNO had been requested to be
available at Hendquarters tke next week for another
Operation where his participation had been tentatively
@iscusaed.

RESCIGNO arrived in Washingtcn on Saturday,
20 May 1967, at 1000.

Subject: Monthly Report of Developments in the LIRIiG/3 Operation,
for the Period 1-30 April,1967.

1. During tho month of April, Rowton was able, through valuable leads
furnished by LIFZAT intercepts, to put strong pressure on LIRING/3 to
present acceptable proof of a number of statements that he had made to
Rowton. At his meeting with LIRING/3 on 19 April, Rowton confronted LI-
RING/3 with suspicions be entertained concerning the proposed acquisi-
tion of a false birth certificate as well as the identity of "Garcia",
the FAR representative. The session, which lasted over two hours, shook
LIRING/3 s0 much emotionally that LIRING/4 became alarmed and telephoned
Rowton's answering service the following morning. Rowton was able to ex-
ploit this opportunity to talk privetely with LIRING/4 end to lay the
foundation for an independent working relationship with her against tar—
gets of interest in the local mission.

2. In addition to initiating a positive effort to verify LIRING/3's bona
fides and reliability, Rowton's confrontation paved the way toward a
closer and more productive relationship with hin in the future. LIRING/3
assured Rowton that he considered his work for Rowton the most important
thing in his life and was willing to do anything to prove that his in-
tnetions were ‘honorable and nis reporting reliable. As a result Rowton is
currently in a position to challenge any or all of LIRING/3's statements,
end to give him much more specific direction than was possible in the
pesto :

3. The following are Rowton's comments on specific developments during the
month in summary form:

a) Developments with respect to Cuba: On 19 April, LIFSAL intercept

-| SAN-7(9.0) revealed that both LIRING/3 and LIRING/4 were virtually

isolated from the Cubans. In the conversation with the Mexican Rojas
LIRING/3 stated that "he and his wife no longer have anything to do
with those people", and LIRING/4,°in-conversstion with the same perscn,
added that she "feels like vomiting when she sees thea". Both LIRING/3
and /4 admitted this situation to Rowton on 22 April when he talked to
each privately, LIRING/& explained her dislike for the Cuban employees
of the mission originated in the "rude manner in which she was thrown
out into the street" some six months previously. LIRING/3 confessed,

; eh 7 27

aay
.

2,
that he could not expkain why his close friends Arnol Rodriguez and
: René Cchoa had not commusicated with him over the past month,despite
‘ his messages ard telephone calls. He felt an uneasy suspicion that the
os .- Julian Lopez affair, as well as the Rico Gal4n letter, had caused certain
elementa localiy and in Havana to become hostile toward him, LiniNG/3
noted that Cepeda had been present when LIRING/4 had blown her top in
the Ambassador's office and that he (LIRING/3) had turned down Cepeda's
invitation to accompany him to Havana shortly after the return of Julian
Lopez. In any case LIRING/3 agreed that the best, or, more candidly, the
only course of action open to him was to pley a waiting game and continue
his work with the Guatemalans in the hope that the Cubans, sooner or later
would recontact him. He stressed that only after he has established firm
and viable cover through the plastic flower business will he be able to
face a thorough interrogation by the DSE in Eavana (which he expects,
should he return at this tine). He feels that he has max enouch Greeks
to dete ( Econonou, Frevolis,Batsakis, Gasdaglis,Arvanitis) in both Mexico
City and Guatenala City, to justify his relationship with Rowton on a
purely commercial level, should that become necessary.
LIRLEG/3 accepted. Rowton's recommendation that LIRING/4 overcome her
apparent visceral dislike for the Cubans in the mission and effect a re-
ete conciliation ‘4 them as soon as possible. After Rowton's personal appeal
: to her, she succeeded in recontacting Ramiro Abreu on 22 April, and re=
mained in almost daily contact with him until he left Mexico on 30 April.
Through Abreu sae re-established contact with Curbelo, Cepeda, and other
att employees of the Consulate, inciuding Enrique Cicard. This gave LIRING/3
an opportunity to chat with Abreu concerning his own situation with the
result that Abreu promised to get some word out to LIRIKG/3 concerning
the attitude of his friends in Havana. Abreu invited LIRING/3 back to
Havana, but the latter turned this down diplomatically (for the reasons
mentioned above).

: Ry b) Developments with Respect to Guatemela: The identity of "Garcia",
y the FAR represestative, has continued to occupy the attention of Rowton.

y An attempt by the Station team to surveilt Garcia when he allegedly picked

: AN > up the medicine fron LIRING/3 on 28 March was unsuccessful ( Rowton spottec

Wy LIRING/3 leaving bis house at about 0815,just as the team was taking posi-
ticns and before they could identify LIRING/3). Another opportunity to

surveil LIRIUG/Y ‘Garciajas well as Enrique “orales, was lost on the even-

-dng of 8 April, becasue of the short notice Rowton has of the mecting.



spiacenenee ~ “

“ Gee Be i .

* Matters, however, have been simplified after, the confrontation of LIRING/3
by Raston on 22 April, inasmuch a3 LIRING/3 promised to notify Rowton in
advance of the next meeting with Cercia, explicitly for the purpose of
Rowton's getting a look at Garcia to identify hin. In addition on 1 Nay,
LIRING/3 inforned Rowton that Garcia had telephoned him the preceding day
to set a date for their next meeting on 18 Fez, ‘when Garcia stated he
would be back from Guatemala. LIFiaT take for 30 April should confirm or
refute this statement. E
During the montk LIRING/3 maintained contact with Jacobo Rodriguez Padilla
Alicia Echeverria as well as Carcen Carrasco. LIFEAT invercepts confimmed
LIRING/3 reports, at least as far as actual contact was concerned.

c) Developments with Respect to the False Birth Certificate: Uppn his re-
turn from northern Mexico on 6 April, LIRING/3 reported that he hed made
arrangements to obtain a false birta certificate for future use through
his half-brother and a certain lawyer named Holando Riojas(for a 2,000
ea Powton's suspicions concerning the

peso foo), LIPIST &:
role, if any,played by Riojas, end served es 2 bkasis for Rowton's heart-
to-heart talk with LIRING/3 on 22 April, LIRIUG/3 clained that the false
birth certificete produced by his half-brother and Riojas waa not suitable
since it applied to a person bora in 1916. This appears to have been the
tmith, as indicated in LIRING/3's conversatica with Jacobo Rodriguez Pa-
ailla on 23 April (SAN-10(2.5), although Row still has doubts concern-

= the existence and role played by Rolando xiojag., Likewise, LIRING/3's
report that pis half-brother was to provide hic with an affidavit in lieu
of birth certificate in the name of Alberto Zérate Vidal,(a name chosen
by LIRING/3 himself), was proved to be true waen LIRIG/4 gave Rawton the
originalax of the court papers on 29 April.

d)_Gover Aspects of the LIRING/3 Cperation: ing the first week of April:

LIRING/3 traveled to northern Mexico (Sabines,iuevo Loredo) and Del ‘Rio, .
. -@exas, and, in collaboration with his half-brother ‘and a certain Sergio
‘ Arche of Villa Acufia, established a notional company ("Floriex") in Del
Rio as a buyer for the plastic flowers assembled in San Cristébal. This
was done, according to LIRING/3, in order to satisfy the requirements of
the Secretariat of Commerce. ond. Industry. Also on 19 April, LIRING/3,ac-
companicd by Snrique Norales<"v “visited San Cristébal to met with Enrique
Martinez and check on the rental of the propesed factory. The "Plastiflor

Subject: Wallace B. Rovton Meeting with LIRING/3.

1. Rowton met with LIRING/3. at the eafehouse(Tacubeya) briefly at ao
4000 on 1 May ,1967. LIRING/3 reported that "Garcia" bec selephoned at
him on the preceding day to tell hin that he had to make another trip}
this time to Guatemala ané that he would be returning on 18 May 41967.
LIRING/3 added that Garcia indicated that he would see LIRING/3 on that
date or a few days thercefter, and planned to introduce him to a

friend who would be in a position to see him nore frequently in the

future. LIRING/3 told Rowton he. agein mentioned the payment for the
medicines and Garcia assured him that it would be settled at their

next meeting.

2. LIRING/3 also reported thet Abreu departed on 30 April, rather than
on 29 April,es anticipated. He said thet he had therefore had achance to
meet wita Alreu again, The latter exconraged bim to keep in touch with
him and promised to get some sort of message to LYRISG/3 from Arnol
Rodriguez and/or Cienfuezo. Accordizg to LIRING/3 Abreu asked him whether
he would be willing to yvisis his friends in Seyana asain in the near
future to discuss his situation personally, indicating that he would
arrange for an invitation as soon es he returned. LIRING/3 told Rowton
he thenked Abreu but stated that at the moment he was very busy with his
commertial obligations and could not find the time. Ze assured Abreu that

. ag soon as he got things rolling in Sen Gristébel and Guatemala, he

would welcome the chance to visit Havana again.

3. LIRING/3 then stated that be and LIRING/4 bad talked over the matter

of her father's visit at length, end had also talked again to him by tele-
pbone(}n response to his two cails),and hed come +o the conclusion that

it was more practical that LIRING/4's father come to Mexico City after all,
since a trip to Montreal was too costly and it appeared impossible to con
vince LIRING/4's father that he should not come to visit his daughter at
her howe. LIRING/3 added that he planned to have LIRING/4 take ber father
on as tiany excursions e3 possible outside Mexico City to keep his visit

-as quiet as possible. He said that in any event 1IRING/4's father could

not make the trip before 20 Nay, 1967, when nes vacation would begin.

4, LIRENG/3 then mentiéaed that both he and LIRING/& felt that they should
return to the Tacubaya apartment to live. He explained that LIRING/4 bed
originally moved into tue former safehouse at bis request to satisfy the


curiosity of the landlady, sra. Sanchez. He felt that this had already
been accomplished and.sna Sanchez was not likely to ask any further
questions. Also both he and LIRIKG/4 were worried about suspicions that
might be aroused on the part of tne local Embassy “and Consular staff if
they continued to reside there. Abreu had already raised his eyebrows
slightly and appeared satisfied wiva LIKING/3's explenation taat he had
rented the apartment for some friends who were out of the country tempor-
arily. LIRING/4 is not comfortable in the apartment, especially since she
may have to face her fcrzer colleagues frequently is she resumea her work
dn the Consulate. According to LIRIiG/3, she feels they are better off
in relatively rodest surroundings,since they have fewer questicns to ans-
wer and explanations to give. Their old apartment (tacubaya) also has
two separate bedrooms and would be more convenient when her Father comes
to visit tiem. LIRING/3 stated that he could, of course, co¥tinue to

suse the Atoyac apartment to see Kowton end meet discreetly wits bis con-

tacte, as previously. i fa

5. In view of the above, Rowton suggested thet LIRING/3 infors tis friends,
particularly the Cubans, that the Atoyac apartment had beer rented for

his Greek friends from Guatemala and Venezuela who planned to establish

a plastics factory here in Hewico and needed a place to stay éGuring their
visits. LIRING/3 felt this would be acceptable, since by now he had good
working contacts with Batsakis and Gasdaglis in Guatemala City ard would
soon be seeing ayvanitis and possibly others. Rowton also suggested that
if it became necessary to explain his contacts with the Greeks to the Gu-
bans, he should say that his original contact was with Pandelis Economou
re the importa:icn of Metaxas cognac (this is true) and that he had met
Stylianos Prevolis and continued to work through him on the recommendation
of Economou (when the-latter returned to Athens). i

6. LIRING/3 stated thut he planned to revisit his friends in the Secreta-
riat of Commerce (perticularly a sefior Llamas of the Plastics Committee)
to obtain the import license for the first shipment of disassendled
flowers to San Cristébal. }

P.S. LIRING/3 also gave. Rowton the attached data on Enrique liorales
and his wife. He indicated that Esperanza Morales knows havarrette
as well as Jacobo Rodriguez Padilla because of her work at the Museum.

Shes an : 29 April,1967
"subject: Wallace B. Rowton Meeting with LIRING/3.

1. Rowton met with LIRING/3 at the safehouse at 1800 on 27 April,
and at 0845 on 29 April,1967. At the first meeting LIRING/3 gave
Rowton the new letterhead paper of the Plastifor de San Cristébal
company and report::1 that he had been in telephcnic contact with
Enrique Horales in Guatemala City end has passed on to him Rowton's
message instructing him,(as per LIRING/?'s suggestion) to contact
Nr. Constantinos Gasdaglis of the Metalopléstica Guatemalteca to be
shown through the factory and given some unassembled smaples of the
plastic flowers. This had been suggested by LIRLsG/7 inasmuch as Mr.
Angelo Arvanitis had not arrived in Guatemala City from Caracas as
anticipated.

2. At both meetines LIRING/3 revorted almost daily contact with Ramiro
Abreu either personally or by phone. He stated that he had had a private
talk with Abreu, in which the latter attempted to smoota over the ap-
parent difficulties lining/3 was having with the Cubans, by stating that
nobody really had anything against LIRING/3. When the latter showed his
dissatisfaction with such a brush-off, Abreu mumbled sozethihg about
the Julian Lopez affair and added that there were “certain things he
Was cot in a position toe discuss", Abreu insinutated that Cepeda was
more or less hostile. although he himself did not share Cepeda's atti-
tude. At this point LIRING/3 inserted the comment that when LIRING/4
blew up some six months aga(on the day that she was fired) in the Am
bassador's office, Cepeda was present, and he appereatly resented the
action even more than the Ambassador. LIRING/3 agreed with Rowton thet
, in light of the current situetion the best course. of action would be to
give LIRING/4 a chance to re-establish cordial relations with her forner
collesgues, particularly Cepeda, since she Had the advantage of being a
Cuben and former employee herself.

. 3. with regard to other comments made by Abreu, LIRING/3 stated that he
‘definitely felt that Abreu was making a pitch for direct and continuing
contact with him, even after Abreu retur.ed to Havana. LIRING/3. stated
to Rowton that he gently brushed this off, stating to Abreu that he hed
certain underdtandings with Arnol Rodriguez and Ssmani Cienfuego and for
that reason did not feel free to enter into any operational relatioship

with anyone else. He concluded this discussion with a comment that if
Abreu could somehow get a message to bim from either Arnol Rodriguez or



2.

Cienfuego designating Abreu as their liaison, LIHING/3 would be glad to
accommodate. LIRING/3 acded to Howton that he gave Abreu a sxetchy idea
of whet he was doing in establishing commercial ties with both Guatezala
and Texas, Abreu appeared intensely interested and when LIRING/3 showed
him the letterhead of the new"conpany" in San Cristébal, Abreu snapped
up the paper and envelope and. slipped trem-into his pocket. LIRING/3 told
Rowton that he expressed to Abreu his intention cf continuing his efforts
along the commercial lines, regardless of the lack of enthusiasm shown to
him by the Cubans.

4, At the 29 April meeting LIRING/3 reported to Rowton that Enrique Korales
bad returned safely from Guatenala City, after having met with Constantine
Gasdaglis end obtained from him samples of the flowers. Since Rowton had
almost reached the conclusion that LISING/3 has known Enrique Morales for
several yeers (contrary to his story thet he met him through "Garcia")Zow=
ton threw in at taois point the comment shat he aad seen checxing ou Ao-
rales,through a Mexican Dunn and Bradstreet type firm he uses iin. business,
and found thet Morales has a poor dredit rating, is married, and is an
artist by profession ( actual source of this info is LIFEAT intexcepts).
LIKING/3 appeared surprised at the accuracy of Rowton's report and adaitted
that Morales was a painter, although he did not earn enough from his work
to live. LIRING/3 elso stated that Morales had used the 500 pesos payzent
he had made to him to liquidate an overdue loan at a bank, but that he was
currently out of debt and in good credit standing.

5. At the same meeting LIRINC/3 reported that he had been in touch with
his half-brother regarding the false birthcertificate and informed his
half-brother that the one presented to him was for a man born in 1916 and
hence useless for his own mux purposes. According to LIRING/3, his vother
proposed an even better idea, the procurement of an "acta notorial" in
which it would state that the person named therein had never been regis-.
tered. LIRING/3 pointed out that this would be more valid legally even
than a birthcertificate since it would be issued by a court rather than
simply by the Rigistro Civil. He then added that he might £ ortunately
Rill two birds with one stone, but using the affidavit in lieu of birth
certificate for himself and give the fals birthcertificate to his friend
Jacobo (Rodriguez Radilla) who had asked bim to help procure a false docu~
ment. Rowton agreed that this would be the best solution and ask when LI-
RING/3 hoped to have the papers. He replied that his half-brother bad al-
ready sent the acta notorial on the morning bus from Sabinas (Coah.) and’



: . aicie “3.

that he wes to pick it up frou the bus driver early that sane afternoon.

6. LIRING/3 then reported to Rowton that the Consulexe had asked LIRING/4
to come back to work on a part-time basis. According to 1IxING/3, bota
he and LIRING/4 dregced their feet on eny connitment until they could re-
fer the matter to Rowton. LIRING/3 commented thet the thought of LIRIKG/4
being again in euch close contact with such types did not make him happy.
but he agreed with Howton that this perhers would serve to re-establisa
his own relationship with then. LIRING/3 adzitted that it had been very
convenient to have LIRING/4 inside the establishment, especially since
she could pick up messages for him and keep her ear to the ground and her
eyes open for gossip. Rowton replied thet in view of this development he
felt that te should have another private chat with LIRING/4 and asked LI-
RING/3 to inform her that he would be calling on her that afternoon at
about 1700, LIRING/3 discreetly stated thet he planned to be out at that
time in any case seeing bis chisdren (oy bis ex-nile).

7. Rowton spent some 90 minutes with LIRING/4 at her home that afternnon.
She reported thet she had made out much better then expected with Abreu,
who came running wen she telephoned hin szcrtly efter Rowton left her on
the evening of 22 April. She added that he came to the house that evering
in the cozpamy of Cusbelo ami nade a date to see her againthe mext morning.
She commented that Abreu, who had always had a sort of crush on her, Was
delighted and pleasantly surprised by her-initiative. jie coufessed that

he thought LIRING/4 wanted a visa to go back home, and was relieved to
find that she was uot in any difficulty. LIXING/4, in her typical candid
manner, adzitted that abreu's interest in ber was probably personal, but
she felt that she had accomplished what Rowton wanted in her own feminine
way. Rowton congratualted her and asked her to continue her efforts ,parti-
cularly with Cepeda and the others in the mission.

8. LIRING/& then explained that on her visit to the Embassy, Abreu, in the
presence of Cepeda and others, almost Yokingly said they were understaffed
and why didn't LIRING/% come back to help them out in the office, LIRING/4&
told Rowton that she immediately showed interest put did everything she
could fron appearing overenthusiastic. Ske commented to Rowton that one
must not run after such people, but make them csnce a bit first so that
they would appreciate anything they get. LIRING/& continued that she
replied to Abreu that she would think it over, but in any case would not
want a repetition of the treatment she received last timte. All sorts of



_ it he : ; \

assurences were given to her, but,despite this she made no commitment
since she wished to talk the offer over with LIRING/3 and Howton.

9. LIRING/4 also reported that she hed net the new.consul, Enrique ‘
Cicard, and found him rather pleasant. She said that she pienned to
invite him to dinner on evening soon so that LIKING/3 could chat with
him. LIE: Ff then commented that the only problem with EAI Cicard
would be Sesesei in the Pbess Office (as Zowton recalls) who was Cicard's
roommate. Ske explained that Sarambu was a member of the Cozmunist Party
and appeared to be a tougu nut to crack. She surprised Rowton by adding
that Cepede appeared easier to her, the orly problem with him was how to
find an opening - some common interest she could exploit. Also regard-
ing the pert-tine work, she ssid that she did not take it too seriously,
since Araceli and Mirabal were coming back from lisvana and hence they
would net be oo 2! a, Rowton mentioned she might also offer to
help the Mexican Rojas who hed telephoned her recently. She agreed and
commented that Rojas had told her that he had finally been invited into iia-
vana for a brief visit.

40. Rowtor then brought up the problem of LIRING/4's father. LIRING/4 con-
firmed whet LIRING/3 had told Rowton that morning, i.e. that her father
had just announced that he had succeeded in obtaining the visitor's visa ~
from New York and that when she had telerkoned him suggesting they meet
in San’ Antonio (to avoid his appearing in Mexico City at this time),her
father had balked, saying that if he were coming all the way to San An-
tonio he mught as well continue on & Little more and go to itexico City.
LIRING/4 explained to Rowton that she cculd not possibly ges across to
her father the real reason she wanted to meet him in the U.S. (to avoid
arovsing suspiciéns on the aprt of such types as Cepeda) and she had to:
let the netter drop. She added that there was also the protlem of the
wisa to the U.S. which she did not want in her passport. Kowton offerred
to obtain the visa through business friends in Houston revher painlessly,
but LIRI G/4 insisted that this would be a needless riak in the eyes of
Cepda just at a time when she might be reasired. She concluced that the
only solution appeared to be Montreal where she could go without arousing
suspicion (she commented that Cepeda hed told her that he intended to
visit Caneda in the near future). She felt she could reduce some of the
expenss by traveling part way by bus. (another tho sght that has occurred

- to Rowton is that she might travel via Havana,alth: e has mbt as yet
mentioned this to either LIRING/4 or LIKING/3).

os 41. During the meeting LIRING/4 presented Rowton with the "Acta Notorial”
which LIRIKG/3 hed mentioned to Rowton thet same morning. She said thet
LIRING/3 had asked her to show the document to Rowtcn whiche he already
krew about. Royton took one of the three copies and told LIRING/4 that
he would study it at his leasure. The document is assued in apparently
proper legel form by Judge Rozelio Sanchez F.,Secretary of the Civil Court
of the Third Tribunal of the First Instacne of the Judicial Distrcit of
Monciava, Sabinas, Coahuila, and representa an aifidavit of Elias Pifia
Diaz and Antonio Rodriguez Lozano to the effect that a certain Alberto
Zarate Vidal was born 7 September,1929 in Ejido Puente Negro of Sabinas,
the son of Enrique Zérate Reyes and Bertha Vidal de Z4rate, but that his
birth was not previously registered by the parents. The witnesses, Pifa
ané Rodriguez, stated under oath that they knew this to. be a fact from
personal knowledge of the parents. In the document Elias Pifia Diaz was
@escrited as a Noxicaz, marrica, native of Abascls,Ccak.,exploged,rosi-
dent of Nineral de Nueva Rosita, Col.Sen Luisité 179,Coah. Antonio Rodri-
guez Lozano is described as a Mexican, widower,municipal empioyee,native
ef Buenaventura,Coah.,resident of Mineral de Nueva Rosita, Celle Dos de
Abril CK-825. Attached herewith is a copy of the affidavit for station
and Headquarters files.

Action Requiredy nish conments
Reference + HMMA-231721, 3 April 1967

Headquarters notes in reference that the method of
concealment used in bugging LIRING-3's apartment, i.e.,
accomodating the SPT-2A in a hole below the wall outlet box
and taping the microphone to the outlet itself, is
ccusiderce Ly the cin view nf the
jack of sophistication of the target personalities. We
are somewhat surprised by this since we had thought that one
of the reasons for making the installation was to determine
just how sopiisticated and reliable LIRING-3 and company
were, that is, whether or not LIRING-3 might be working for
the opposition. This point might not have come through
clearly in H!M¥-15327, 20 March 1967, and if 50, we would
like to take this opportunity to emphasize that one of the
reasons we have been following this involved case so closely
is to guarc ayaiust the possibility that LIRING-3 ts more
sophisticated than is apparent on the surface (or is himself
being handled by a sophisticated opposition case officer).
If so, we obviously cannot afford to assume thet reference
dostallation is adequate since it would appear to be quite
easily discoverabie by superficial exaaination by someone
with some degree of sophistication and a screwdriver and
flashlight. The Station acted correctly in MEXICO CITY 0881
in describing and seeking approval for the installation, and-
we must confess that it just never occurred to us that LIRDG-3
et. al. might be considered to lack sophistication in this
regard, We would therefore welcome further Station comments

KAPOK/PBRUMEN - The LIRING-3 Operation

TETION REQUPED REFERENCES feceerrnveeerarane?

ACTION REQUIRED: FYI

1, Forwarded herewith as Attachzent One are five reports
prepared by Wallace B. ROWTON on the LIRING-3 operation. These
reports are dated 13, 19, 22 (two reports) and 24 April 1967.

2, LIFEAT coverage of LIRING-3's apartment was started on
6 April. A review of the LIFEAT take for the period of 6 to 12
April indicated to ROWTON that LIRING-3 may not have been telling
him the truth on a number of minor points, One of these was

or not Relorde NIOFAs, the Tareda lasver whe can

provide false birth certificates (on the basis of thich Mexican
passports can later be obtained), exists. ROWTON took up the questipn
of the lawyer and other points dealing with Enrique MORALES
and "GARCIA" with LIRING-3. The latter appeared crushed that
ROWION. had doubts about the sincerity of some of his statements.
He swore that the lawyer really exists and offercd to give
ROWTON all pertinent details of his next meeting with "GARCIA"
so that RCOWION can have a look at the Guatemalan "from a distance."
Such an arrangement should greatly sinplity the tagof the
LIEMDRACE team, the next timc "GARCIA" and LIRI meet.
LIRING=3 also admitted that his wife was becoming tore and more
upset about his "clandestine" activities, and that his relations
with the Cubans were at a low point. After his meeting with
ROWTON on 19 April, when the above was discussed, the LIEMBRACE,
team followed LIRING=3 from his old house (now used for his
meetings with ROWTON) directly to the Cuban Embassy. LIRING-3

only stayed there about five minutes, however, and later volunteered
the fact that he briefly visited the Enbassy to ROWTON, giving a
satisfactory explanation. : :
3. A review of the LIFEAT take from 12 to 19 April showed
that LIRING-3 had deceived ROWTON on a couple of additional
points. One of these was that LIRING-3 called his Honduran friend
Rene OCHOA in Cuba, when ne told ROWTON that he phoned Arnol
RODRIGUEZ. Faced with the fact that the number he called was not
Arncl's (ROWTON pays LIRING-3's phone bills), LIRING-3 said that
OCHOA was the best friend he had in Cuba and admitted that he
had not been in contact with RODRIGUEZ for some time. As can be
seen from hig reports, a major effort was made by ROWTON to
convince LIRING-3 and especially his wife that the two should
take the initiative and make an effort to improve their relations
with the Cubans in general and the personnel of the local Cuban
Embassy in particular, It became evident in the process that
his lack of good relations with the Cubans has been bothering
LIRING-3 and has been partly responsible for his depressed moods
which, in turn, upset his wife. The latter is particularly
disgusted with the people in the Cuban Embassy for what she con~
siders the poor treatment they gave her husband prior to the
latter's last trio to Cuba (Headquarters will recall that she was
fired at that time for telling off the Cuban Ambassador).

4. There is little question that ROWTON played his cards
well with LIRING-3 and especially his wife who agreed to reestablish
contact with the local Cubans to help ROWION and her husband. As
cen be seen from ROWION's last report, the Cubans were quick to
seize the opportunity to develop better relations, with LIRING-3's
wife and, through her, LIRING-3. The latter’ was aaving lunch with
Ramiro Abregu Padron on 26 April as this dispatci: was being
written.

a

5. Enrique MORALES, meanwhile, is in Guatemala to receive
instruction in the art of making plastic flowers from Angelo z
ARVANITIS. He carried with him a letter of introduction written
by LIRING-7, It was necessary to clinch the plastic flower deal
which will serve to cover LIRING-3's activities with the Guatemalan
rebels, to use LIRING-7 to vouch for LIRING-3 with Angelo
ARVANITIS. ROWTON has been instructed, however, not to bring
LIRING~-3 and LIRING~7 together and to pass LIRING-7 off simply
as a friend in the Embassy of the nationality which ROWTON uses
in dealing§ with LIRING-3.

6. Forwarded As Attachment Two, under separate cover, is
a photocopy of a document from the Mexican Secretariat of
Gobernacion notifying LIRING-3's wife that the visa application
for her father, now in the United States, has been denied. This
is not too surprising in view of the father's current nationality
and racial background,

reports written by Wallace B. ROWTON:

A. Report dated 7 April 1967 describes the trip which L-3
made to Northern Mexco to explore the possibility of obtaining
@ US customer for L-3's planned plastic.flower business. All
L-3 needed was a letter from a potential US customer, real or
Ficticious to obtain a license for his business from the Mexican
secrelariat ui vuumerce and inaustry., For 4 gZdwue fee a friend
of L-3's half brother registered a firm in Del Rio, Texas.
This firm would, on paper at least, import L-3's flowers into
the United states.

Mexican lawyer, Rolando RIOJAS, in Nuevo Laredo "valid" birth
certificates can be! purchased with which Mexican ‘passports can
be obtained. L-3 who wants another passport to travel to Centra!
America (his own tears PBRUMEN entry and exit stamps) immediately
“ordered” a birth certificate.

C. Report dated 8 April gives more details on the men
L-3 was introduced to by his half-brother, who certainly
seems to know his way around tha U.S, Mexican border erea.
Station had no traces on Shs or Eloy %GONZALEZ.

D. Report dated 12 April covars meetings: with "GARCIA"
of the FAR and Enrique MORALES Guerra recently introduced
to L=3 by GARCIA to help\him with the plastic flower business.
The Station did not have \ufficient advance notice to have
GARCIA and MORALES surveilled. In connection with paragraph
5 of that report dealing with Alicia ECHEVARRIA, ROWTON has i
been trying to have L-3 meet Alicia to use her with the PBRUMENers .
as a "source" for some items of information passed L=3 by
ROWTON. Ali » who drinks like a fish and is frequently
under the weather, seems to have a difficult time remembering
what she tells people.

Ee.
ECHEVARRIA, GARCIA and Jacobo ¥RODR'GUEZ Padilla, RODRIGUEZ's
comments on the relations betwéen t:'z FAR and the Yon Sosa
guerrilla groups in Guatemala were cabled separately. The
Station is examining the desirability of having L-3 obtain a
birth certificate for RODRIGUEZ (via the lawyer in Nuevo Laredo)
with which the latter could obtain a Mexican passport,

Report dated 13 April ise: meétings with Alicia

F, The same report contains a detailed description of
"GARCIA" and a sketch of him drawn by L=3. The Station is
i currently exploring via LIREBEL the possibility that "GARCIA"
may be identical with fnu CASASOLA, known to LIREBEL as the
new PGT representative in Mexico City.

: 2, Forwarded as Attachment Two, under separate cover, is the

i text of the letter (later typed on "Floriex Co,"' letterhead) which é
L-3 intends to present to the Mexican authorities to obtain a

license for his plastic Flower business.

3. Headquarters traces on Rolando RIOJAS, Sergio ARCHE and
Eloy GONZALEZ would be appreciated, Station traces \ere negative.
This Station would also appreciate knowing Headquarter's interest
in the Mexican birth certificate - passport mill discovered by.

MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD °7 March 1967

SUBJECT : Tape Recording of LIRING-3/ROWTON Meeting

REFERENCE: HMMA 31310, 8 Scptember 1967

‘1. Subject tape consists of a 75-minute recording of
a meeting between Wallace B. ROWTON and LIRING-3 at the
LIRING-3 safehouse on 20 January 1967 (this safehouse is now
no longer being used as such but rather as a residence for

LIFING-3 and his wife).

2. Following are. facts extracted from a quick run

through of the tape: :

: a. LIRING-3 made a long distance telephone call
to viub 9° SUAREZ de Roars cz at telephone 20-67-04 in Havana. bf
He placed the call from the safehouse phone 14-18-56.
BUYXKE The call was made in connection with a possible

te beralimnalar, am

forthcoming trip of LIRING-3 te—Heavane. It was developed
during the call that Ruby was the wife of Arnol Rodrgguez Corps
and that ‘their daughter was seriously ill. This information hp
apparently was previously known to LIRING-3 who used the Qa
illness as a pretext for the-call. Ruby had asked Bena.
LIRING-3 to obtain medicine for the daughter which was

. a

tout yr"



~ Sead a

known as NECCRAM, LIRING-3 advised Ruby that he was unable |
to locate any medicine by this name and asked for the ana
fornula uf the medicine or the name of ne seen “Produc ing
it. During the conversation LIRING-3 said that he expected
to be in tebeel within 15 to 20 days. During this meeting
ROWTON set up a 5,000 peses tevsbnens ft with
LIRING-3.

¢. During the conversation the names Navarrete
(Carlos) and Jacobs vere mentioned. It is believed that

these nanes referred to (Carlos Komewute ani Jeerle Pupartvee fodthe

artists and leftist friends of LIRING-3.

d. Another name was mentioned, that of Max

SANTANA although themegaing of the reference was unclear.

“(Max Santang is a well-known Cuban exile in Mexico City

who was formerly a labor leader in the pre-Castro era.
Heis somewhat of a QAighk rascal and has to make
his living the best he can, but he is also the representative
of Carlos PRIO, a former president of Cuba, in Mexico.
The CUIS has several times expressed interest in Max
SANTANA, to double agents handled by the Station.)
e. An interesting item was dropped by LIRING-3
in connection with an alleged statement by Fidel Castro
that the young Mexican Communist Party members working

4n Cuba were "algo burgues". The remark was interesting

in view of the strained relations between PCM and PC.)

Kenuf



2 wat

f. Another interesting remark dropped by !.IRING-3

was that the Cuban leaders are highly unhappy "con el embai
This is interesting in light of independent reports we have
had that the Cuban Ambassador was anything but a happy man
when. he returned a few days ago from his two month vacation
in Cuba,

8. Several telephone calls occurred during the
course of the meeting or just afterwards. One of these
involved an apparent inquiry by the person calling in as
to the name in which the phone was registered because
LIRING-3 said that the telephone was in the name of Waria
Sanch@z. Another telephone call of interest occured during
the meeting. It was apparently made by a young lady
calling in connection with an anticipated meeting. with
LIRING-3. As the tape ran out LIRING-3 apparently was

waiting for the young lady's arrival.

1. ‘The LIRING-3 operation, because of its scope,
{volving information bearing on Cuba, Mexico, Guatenala,
and now possibly the Soviet Union, and because of its
promise of possibly producing important iniormation on
Cuban/Soviet subversion-support mechanisms operating in
and through Mexico, has naturally been closely followed
by all Headquarters components concerned with these
areas. rs

2, Because of the recent developments in the
opera:ion:, auu ovcuuss of bie iapoxiauce of bie target,
Headquarters is anxiovs to establish, as precisely as
possible and aa goon as possible, o basis for judging
LIRING-3's reliability and access. This is particularly
important in view of the apparently rapid progress
LIRING-3 is making in creating a channel for the movement
of arms and supplics from the United States to Guatenaia,
There is a very real concern felt here about our involve-
ment in the creation of this channel while we have not yet
clearly established how we could control it. We do not
wish to find ourselves in the position ot having aided tie
guerrillas to receive cven a small anount of weapons or
supplies. And we must guard against the possibility that
the CUIS has not been taken in, and that it is monitoring
this entire operation, If thig is true, while we can only

speculate on their motives for encouraging ‘the creation
of the supply channel, we can be certain those uotives are
inimical to the interests of the United States.

3. So far it bas not been possible to confirm LIRING-3's
contacts with the FAR or PGT in Guatemala or in Mexico,
the nature of his contacts with the Cuban Embassy in Mexico,
or with Cuban officials in Cuba. We know that he has
traveled to Guatemala, to Cuba, and has visited the Cuban
Embassy, but have only his word on what transpired after he
arrived. at these places. On the other hand, we have confirmed
that he has withheld informaticn from us, e.g., the fact
that his wife worked in the Cuban Embassy and that his
father-in-law resides in the United States.

4. It ie partially for this reason therefore, that
Headquarters is particularly anxious that LIRING-3's
contact with "Garcia" should be confirmed and "Garcia"
identified. Algo, of course, if "Garcia" is the FAR
ative in Mexico and is in contact with the Soviets,

then 12 ying hin te an imvortant objective in itself,

apart from the establishment of LIRING-3's: bonafides.

5. Given the difficulty of confirming LIRING-3's
accounts of contacts inside Cuba, inside Guatemala, or
even inside the Cuban Embassy, Headquarters sees the
LIRING-3 - Garcia contact, in the favorable operational
climate of Mexico City, as providing the opportunity to
obtain the confirmation which is so much needed in this
operation.

6. While it is understood that Station is as
appreciative as is Headquarters of the importance of
identifying Garcia, we wish by this dispatch to emphasize
the sense of urgency which we consider proper for this
identification effort. We urge that the Station consider
surveillance of the earliest possible meeting of which
it has sufficient advance knowledge to mount coverage. It
is also suggested, siuce Garcia may travel to the Soviet
Union and this next meeting with LIRING-3 may be quite some
time in the future, that the Station explore’ all possible
investigative means to identify Garcia which could be
initiated without waiting for a surveillable meeting.
Possibilities which have been discussed here include:
periodic surveillance of LIRING-3; LIFEAT. and LIMUD
coverage of LIRING-3; passage ot photos of Guatemalans

. who could possibly be Garcia to Rowton who, if a suitable
explanation tor his possession of the photos could be
devised, could show them to LINING-3 for identification;
including "Garcia" in a listing of aliases known to be
used by FAR members, and asking LIREDEL-1 to identify
the user; or, obtaining a detailed physical description
of Garcia for possible identification by LIREBEL-1,
Guatemala Station, or Guatemala Station assets.

7. The special difficultics inherent in a false-flag
recruitment are appreciated by lcadquarters and it is

bimself can determine how far and how fast he can go

in pressing the agent for information or details on any
given subject. Thus the Station may find some of the
above suggestions to be not feusible or may be able

to suggest other investigative means which would offer
greater prospects for success, Headquarters, of course,
defers to Station on the specific means to be used and
will appreciate receiving information on developments.

Subject: Monthly Report of Develornents in LI=1. 3/3 Cperation.
‘*

1, During the month kowton continucd to meet with iIMING/3 regulerly,

on an averese of three times per week,for about one hour, s+ the safe-
house and (leter in the month) at 1 /3's permanent residence. LI-
RING/3 continued to accept Rowton's cuidsnce and cirsction virtually.
without ofestion. Cn 15 February “ovton prepared the draft of a project
outlining targets and objectives in order to solidify Kuberk's relation-
ship with iIRING/3. In order to facilitate financial arrengements with
LIRING/3 a revolvinz fund of 5,0CO pesos was given to him by Rowton to
be uccounted for periodically against receipts.

2. bevelopsents with resyect L¢ Cuba:
During the reporting period i1XING/3's reletionsnip with the Cubans
deterioratedfor reasons not as yet, fully understood either by Rowton
or LIRING/3 hinself. It wiil de recalled that,following his passing
of sensitive information on the Lopez arrest, LIRING/3 was invited
to iizvena co discuss further collaboration. Eis subsequent visit, ane
however, was not as fruitful 2s expected, despite the fact that he
finally net with Cienfuegorthroush the intervention of bis friend
Arnol Rodriguez. In lieu of a specific nissicn for the Cubans, as
both LIEING/3 and Rowton hoped, he was brushed off on en apparently
unimportant comzercial assimment. RING/3 felt strongly that he
should establish relationships wita the Guatemalan rebels on his
own ( through Jacobo Rodri:uez), more or less ignoring the Cubans,
“end particularly the DSE, in the hope that the Cubans would inevi-
tably recognize the merit of his efforts and take him into’ their
’ confidence. At kowton's urging, however, LIRING/3 agreed to write
H his friend Arnol Rodriguez a letter explaining more fully his posi-
‘ tion and informing bim that he was in any case moving shead with bis
: plan‘to selp the Guatemalan revels. This apparently did the trick,
since Rodriguez passed a message to him through the Cuban Ambussador
that he was invited back te Savana for further discussions, L1ATsG/3
expressed a great deal of self-satisfuction at this development, dut
7 felt he should continue with the FAR representatives in order to have
iy more concrete data to discuss with the Cubans when he did return to
g Havana. He therefore returned to Guatemala in order to advise the

entatives that he had succeeded in obteining tke medicize
and radio tubos they bad orivisally aszeé for.

In February, however, ne received word from Arnol kodriguez throusa

a diplozatic courier that he should not return to Havana until he had
received furthor instructicns from Arncl Rodriguez himself. Subse-
quently, on 15 February, LIsING/3 learned from the chauffeur of the
Cuban Acdassador that Julien Lopez had alleged t LIRING/3 had obd-
tained the information regerding his arrest fror the Mexican police,
and, by insinuation, vas collaborating with the exican authorities.
The cueuffour added that 1IX1..G/3 should be aware that there were cer-
tain elezents, including Cepeda, in the local imbassy hostile to him.
This report led LIRING/3 to check with the Cuban Consulate re the
status ef bis visa Ca 60 in caply Canuar, Ly Apuol edripues> aud
to bis surprise he learned that the visa had "rux out" and would have
to be renewed in the event he desired to travel to Cuba again.

This dev.2lopment left LIXIiG/3 perplexed and disturbed, as well as more
annoyed than ever with the bureaucratic shenanigens of the D3¥. LIxiNG/3
felt genuinely outrgyed since he in his own mind hed only the best of
intentions in his offer to nelp the Cubans and in general the revolu-
tion in Sentral America. LIXiNG/3's first reaction was to ignore the
Cubans coxpletely and proceed unilaterslly with bis collaboration with
the Guetesalans. Ne was encourszed in this by corments made by the

FAR cont:
people to deal with and sometimes even FAR found it best to ignore them.
kowton, however, urged LIxINC/3 to redevelop more cordial relations
with the local mission, since any hostile elements there could cause
him endless embarassment and annoyance. Kowton aiso advised LIRING/3

to continue his developdmt:{ of Ismail cuarez de la Paz, who appears

to have a direct channel to Arnol Rodrizuez, and who himself has often
complained of the inefficiency and ineptness of the Cuban bureaucrats.
During the latter half of the month 11231G/3 made more frequent visits
to the Zmbassy and chatted cordially with Abreu. as of 28 February,bow~
6ver, no further meas:ye has been received from .rnol Rodriguez to

: é clarify LIRING/3's current relationship with the Cubans.

Developzents with respect to Guatemal eet
During the month LIKIRG/3's relavionship with FAR was strengthened by
direct contact with the FAR representative in Mexico City. Cn 13 February

FAR repres:

ct in Hexico City to the effect that the Gubans were difficult



a : a 3. im

a Guatezalan telephoned LIQil/3 at ais residence ond at the neeting
arranged for 20 Feoruary, idcntified himself as the AR liaison who
would be seeing; him-more or less re:ularly in the future. The FAR
liaison, who stated his name was Garcia, explained that he was plan-
nang @ trip to the Soviet Urion in the near future, end was anxious
prior to his departure to have LIRING/3 meet with three other comrades
preferzdly in San Cristéval when the 1edicine and radio tubes were
being, delivered. LIRING/3 acreed to make the trip, since at the sene
time he could arranze the retital of a suitable aouse in the area for
future contacts. LIRING/3 therefore cade plans to depart with the
supplies for San Cristébal on 1 March. :

LIRING/3 had not informed the Cuban Smbassy of his newly developed
liaison with FAR, but has indicates in a general way to zrnol Rod-
riguez taat he is engaged in support activities for the revoluticn in
Guatenela. He hopes to clarify with the FAR more precisely what nis
own reletionship with the Cubans should be with resard to their activi-
ties, especially in light of the fact that the Fax representative has
informed him that direct cid is now being received from the Soviets and
certain of his activities are not being made known to the Gubans. eee
In general in his dealinrs “ith the Cuatemalans, LINIiUG/2 feels more
comfortable since his relationship with them is uncomplicated at the
moment by such antecedents as the Lopez affair. He is impressed by the
efficiency and professional approach of FAR and in undoubtedly in-.
fluenced by the relative ease with
Mexico. t
Cover Aspects of LIRING/3's Operations: i
During the moath of February, LIRING/3 presented a formal request to :
the Dirrecién General de Comercio tarough his friend Sergio Gonzélez
Navin for the establishment of a stall fuctory to assenble the plastic
flowers produced by. the Metaloplastica de Guatemala. in anticipation

of @ request by the Secretariat for details and assurances that the
flowers will be exported to the U.S. and not compete with local pro- Fi
duction, LIRI.G/3 re-established contact with his half-brother who i
lives in 3abenas and has excellent coxmercial contacts with firms in |

ch he can vepforn for them in

N San Antonio, in the hope of solliciting his help in finding an Anerican:

importer who will contract to purchase the entire pvoduction of the
factory once it is set-up in fexico. At the same time LIRING/3, on
Rowton's suggestion, will investigate the possibility of establishing


a et he

modest factory in the house he plans to rent in San Cristébal.
Negotiations with local authorities in that area would be such simpler
than in Mexico City and at the same tine the factory would provide
excellent cover for the safehouse.

If and when the flower project materializes, arrangements can easily
be made by LIXING/7? to have the first shirment sent from Guatenala
City by truck to San cristébal. A qualified Mexican can likewise be
sent to learn the technical <cetails of assembly at the Hetaloplastica ~
plant in Guetemale City.

The entire coumercial cover plan has been accepted enthusiastidally by
PAR since it presents to them the inviv. prospect of a viable legal
network operating from Texas to Guatemala City. LiXihG/3 reslizes the
delicacy of the future relationsaip with Netaloplastica and ELIKING/7

+ oan nuch ce poesible, at least for the

and 04S pituctoed Yo Vo.ipar
present, his activities cn penalf of FAR from those of a purely com—
mercial nautere.

3. During the month it was necessary for LIXING/3 to move his fumily into
the safehouse, which he head rented in bis oxn name, in order to disabuse —
the landlady of her crowing suspicions that the epartnent was being used

: G/3 explained to the lendlaéy that he
had been havinc some domestic problems with bis wife, but thet taings had
been patched up and that they were now shle to resume their married life
together. This has apparently satisfied the euriosity of the lendlady.

for some unorthodox purpose. “LI

Another safchouse, under cover of an art studio, will be located for fu-
ture meetings between LIRIKG/3 and Rowton. The ori: inal plan to noritor
the safehouse from the spartment below has deen abandoned in view of the
undesirubility cf the couple currently residing in the proposed .LP. i

Given ovr inability to check-out L-3 statenents, now sélid conclusion or |

Total. LIRING-3 expenses 1 May 1966-28 Fetruary 1967 = $4,000 +
Total vill exceed $10,000 by nov (1 May 67)., :

Realistically, much of LIRING-7 expense should be added to this total, since
1-7 min funotion bas been to support LIRING-3 op.

<2 :
LIRIKG-3 op has occupied maser portion REVTCN tine oveS past year. Plus tine
from other Station and Headquarters personnel in support. It is an expensive op.

Hag produced five dissems, Tuo of these later proven false, one proven to
be tasically true (by LIENVOY), on other tuo have no furthur info either way.

LIRING-3 has alao reported condiderable other info which cones under heading
of positive intel, but was not dissened because at the tine he reported it
it was doubtful, known to be false, fragrentary, ete.

Over the past year it has not been possible to verify even one Efctimomyx
important staterent or clain of the many nade by L63(persons he has talked to,
actions he has.taken, information he has obtei ned, etc.). 1-3 has claimed
ections and contacts ranging from Mexico City to Havana, to \uatenala City, |

to Texas, and points in betweer. While we know he traveled through these
areas, nothing really conclusi-ve or key is confirmed, On the other hand,
several of his claims are knovn to be false. er ak >

evaluation of op 4s possible. & good bet would be that 1-3 has completely
fabricated 90% of his information and claired actions. His motive woubd bo
money, since thie op has paid off very well so far for him.

A good bet would be that he suspects Rowton is US Intelligence, based on
the requirerents levied on hiz, the ready supply of money, the clandestinity
of the viole relationship, the Lopez Diaz-Rico Calan info Rowton gave him.

Either looking for more money, favors, or out pf political inclination,
he probably would have inforred the Cubans of his relationship with Rowton,
4f he suspects Rovton is US Intelligence.

Cubans could very possibly have not beliewdd 1-3 story. It is a wild one.
Or they could have been afraid of Mexican or US provocation, Certainly they
would be doubly cautions on arns smuggling after the enbarrasing Lopez affatr.

Or they could be monitoring the whole op. It doubtful they directing it, given
13's careless use of the telephone and involved story which too easy to
check, if ve peally made the effort A good Cuten Intel officer, telling 1-3
what to do and say, should be able to do better. Or maybe 1-3 doesn't follow
Ouban instructions any better than he follovs Rowton's, :

LIRING/3 - Norris Kk. UDHLETT Chronology

Carlos JURADO Delmar, a Mexican artist and existentialist,
is an unwitting iffformant who has exicen far leftist political
convictions. He has been assessed by his handler as unfriendly to
the U.S. and not a candidate for recruitzent, JURADO's wife, ‘irian
CHICHAY, a Chineee-Cuban, worked in the Cuban Embasgy in “exico City
until Novenber 1966 for LIRING/1 and LIRING/2. SONTON:Fretends to
be a Greek businessman interested in developing lucrative, semi-legal
business with Cuha. JURADO mav have the immression that ROUTE fe
Teally somehow Rcubapierp ied 23 Soviet intelligence > a notion RO:TON
has not attempted to disahussaibRdemteuw& He has convinced JURADO
that to be successful the two of them mst be fully aware of all the
realities of Cuban politics and commerce. JURADO, who lived: in Cuba
for a couple of years following CASTPO's accession, hes maintained
friendships with some well-placed contacts in Cuba. He has made
three trips to Havana in connection with his relationship with
ROVTON, Who obtains information from JURADO by elicitang and direct
questioning.

Asa result of the injection of .7TADO by Station Mexico

City into the sensational JULIAN LOPEZ Diaz/Guatemalan:Arms Scuggling
case, JURADO was asked by the Cuban Embassy to Relp the GOC with their
sensitive adtivitées in Mexico and to go to Havana for a briefing

on what he cAuld do, To inject JURAD0 into the case, Station Mexico

City furnished him with some theretofore undisclosed information on



~ ‘ ~

i ira i yeaa by pat authorities of LOPEZ Dia’; a Cuban diplomat, 77-—

> pallegedly etmuigg fron a Guatemalan reporter who had oftaingd it fros
amember of the Guatemalan Cormunist party. In Havana, JUR*DO
discussed the case at length with his friend and contact, Arnol
RODRIGUEZ Carps, a former Vice-Minister in the cuban Foreign Ministry.
He also told RODRIGUEZ details of a plan to form his Mexican and
Central Anerican contacts into a network which could support clandestine 5
‘edaseintfmm, Cuban operations, fO0RICUEZ appeared to be impressed, according
to DURADO's story, and introduced JURADO to Osmani CIENFUECOS, Chaircan
of the Foreign Affairs Comittee of the Central Comittee of the Qiban

Commmist Party (the body charged with the responsibility for

implementing Coban subver: sien in Ls’

.| pam venarted ‘ -
that CIENFUEGOS expressed appreciation for JURADO'S offer of assistance and
statéd that Cuba is ‘interested in exporting subversion to Central :
fmerica to hargss the United States SESE

CIENFUEGOS reportedly went on to say that the Gdanstrustea JURADO
but not his contacts about wion they know nothang. 7 further
explained that one untrustworthy Link could blow the entire efforr=
and and then suggested that JUAD0 be given the opportunity to test the
sincerity of his contacts. RODRIGUEZ reportedly suggested that
MURADO arrange a deal to barter Cuban Nickel ore for weed killer.
(Cuban Nickel ore is already being offered in Mexico by other dealers and
Mexican-made weed killer is readily available on the open market

in Mexico).



oy: ; a oo

Despite Ileadquarters suagest ions that Rg go slowly in setting i +
Pind By vecrine TPER EGET,

up his support net to the Guatenalan fae eviael ‘P85 RONTON sett him

to establish contact ish with them on the 'exican/Cuatenalan border

in early Decenber 1966, JURADO established contact with a mah in

Mexico Gity vho gave him a letter cf introduction to a woman in Cuatemala
City. The wonan was to carry the letter to Cesar MONTES, Guatemalan
guerrilla leader and explain thut he cculd mfié trust JURADO and should
take advantage of his offer. At the same time JURADO sent a letter to
ROORUGUEZ in Havana explaining that he would not make his comercial
contact witting of any arms passed through the proposed channel.

le also sent isfiomsation on weed killers and requested Jtetalls

for possibly consumating the deal.

In mid-December JUR/D0 again traveled to a town on the
Mexicana side of the Guatenalan border and onnrtacted the guerrilla
vepresentatives, tle reported that he was taken “black" es the
border to Guatemala City where the guerrillas told him of sone of
their Broblens in obtaining material, specifically & mentioning their
need for sone radio tubes and mecical supplies. JURANO committed
himself to providing those items along with.a concrete proposal for
regular contact. The guerrillas reportedly told JURADO that they
could handle the goods from the Mexican side of the border to their base
camp in Guatemala,

At this paint the Nexico City Station proposed to mount a

: paralled operation involving Norris K.UMPHLETT, a 33 year old Greek

who was recruited in 1952 by BOVTON to penetrate the U.S,, Greek, and
Quban Commmist Parties, UMPHLETT performed adequately inthese tasks



we ce . a

including atf but the last two years of aver five spent in Cuba.
POVTON sent UMPHLINT to Guatemala in late February 1966 on a
tyasiness development" trip to establish contact with elements uho
could be used as support élements for subversion including clandestine

resupply of guerrilla groups. It was propsoed that these elenents would
wists

in fefpe, pinta hiing Aime

be offered to the CUIS é

fos gompyematiamia Creek Cirmmistycuns a chogolate factory is; Cuaterala

os City where he has harbcred Leftists ant

an EDA deputy in Athens. UPILETT is to exploit this relationship
in an effort to land a job in the business as a cover to assist the
Creek in clandestine activity.
In nid-Janvary 1967 JURADO reported that the Cuban Arbassador Aad
called hin aside at a party to teil hin that RCORICUEZ cabled the
Enbassy to request JURADO's presence in Cuba for additional céscussions.
Rather than jump on Havana's cormand, JURADO called RODRICIEZ to
infdh him he would have to ake encther trip to Cuatemala first. ;
‘JURA reported that he was approached by another Cuaterala Communist
iho chaimed, in confidence, that he was part of the FAR network
in Mexico and had been advised that massive Soviet aid (in excess i
of $200,000) was available to the PAR "directly" but with qualifications
that would in effect place the FAR under complete Soviet control. He
explained that it was for this reason that the FAR was raising funds

on its own by sukh means as bank and train retheries, in Central Aserica.

_4-



At the end of Janugay JU"*20 reported he had made contact
with the FAR representatives in Cuctemala City and had made arrangerents
for permanent liaison in “exico City and Havana. He was given contact
instructions which would be initiated by the FAR repsesentatives, and was *eCef
dgatemansé to passthe suppl@js (that he had committed himself to
providing) to the contact man in “exico City.

A special envoy from Cuba visited JURADO the day after he
returned from Cuaterala for the ostensible purpose of passing on
some advise and guidance of a security nature. RO"TON speculated that the
' Gubane - particularly RONRICURZ - were afraid JURADO had taken offense

at their treatment of him on his last inixitted visit to Quba, and sent

, someone to salve his feclings, ‘The envoy gave JURADO a lct of advice on how
: ; to handle himself with respect to the Cuban Erbassy persorel,
H American intelligence, and on security and tradecraft in general.
a ” ~yirurtnmareniomsenqiemneatere nisin
: On 15 February !EPPERA, the Cuban Erbassy chauffeur anda
: friend of JURADO, met with the agent to tell hin some mmors he
had heard involving JURADO including the statement that there were
certain “hostile elenents" toward JURADO in the Enbassv. (WTO
cautéoned JURADO not to be too aloof with the Embassy causing then
to react unfavorabley toward him for no reason ter khatx than
that they were out of touch with him,

City because of "the incredibie network of agents rim by the North
Americars throughout the city." He said that the FAR didn't have an
urgent need for the supplies because they were adequately suppléed
by the Soviets and Cubans but that the FAR had no objections to
JURADO dealing with Yon Sosa's '%-13"Noverber which is not so well
supplied, "Garcia" said he > aS 5 scheduled to traval to ie Soviet
Union and wanted to discuss faiT thes aspects of WEBida suport
operation so that adftivies could Move ahead in his absence, “Carcia't
contrasted the "bother" of dealing with the Cubans with the caitatee  of
Telations with the Soviets,

Gn 2 March JURADO traveled tothe Mexico/Cuatemala border
town of San Cristobal to deliver /the oe supplies to the representatives
of the FAR guerrillas. “Garcia showed up and he and JURADO went
to a tidn neareé-the Guatemalan border where they transferred the
goods. "Garcia" said he would take’ possession.of the refeigerated

drugs in ‘'exico City after Teturming from the USSR, The FAR Tep-
Tesentatives explained’ they had a fairly good network in Texas for
the acquisition of ams but were having troubie transporting them.
They indicated JURADO's plan vas better than anything they have going
and would probably adopt it. Y%efore he left for USSR, "Garcia"
called JURADO to tell him that Cesar MONTES and Yon SOSA hed patched

up their differences and the Cuztemalan guerrilaa riovement vould move ahead
faster now.


ANALYSIS AND CO 2ENTS

{

\ INTENT OF THE OPERATION: To provide inforamtion:" Cuatemalan :
| insurgency; Cuban ~ and perhaps - Soviet support of subversion

! in Guatemala; the use of Mexico by the Cubans and Soviets

H to support Guatemalan jnsurgency; identify people, pin-point

1 - locations, and establish metiiods of operation of insurgents

‘ and their support ntevorks in Cuatemala and Mexico.

1, ESTABLISIMENT OF SUPPLY NETWORK - fost is having
LIRING/3 establish a supply network in Mexico aw fuategale to 7235

materiel to the insurgents in Cuatemala. The supplies could

originate in either the U.S., Cua, or by:sea from any countrye

In doing this, menbers of existing support networks are not beéng

|

|

H fdenzified - only the aliases of some of LIRINC/3's contacts. ‘ :
i ‘This network could very well operate parallel to other such channels

: and we would not: learn any nore than we are learning now. In fact,

é

é we could conceivably assist Cuatemalan insurgency and get little

t or nothing in rethrn -- and should the operation go awry this agency :

i would be hard put toexplain the ciramstances, You can be sure the

le Jeftists would have a field day. We are not adverse to providing

} some materiel as long as we get something in returns

24 LIRING/3'B REPORTING = None of the ififormation LIRING/S
has reported has been corroborated by other sources. ly the :
existence and presence of some of the contacts has been cofifirmed by
technical operations at the Station, but not the infomation. So
far we, and BOHTON, have no choice but to belégeve most of what
LIRING/S telis us. (ovtowis capability in the Spanish language is
only adequate and one taped meeting showed that LIRING/3 spole Tight

‘ a
Qvor ROVION and dominated the conversation, | It is conceivable that

LIRING/3 is controlling the entite operation and that TON

is not able to discern this, Also, because of the umusual nature of |
their relationship and ROWTONSs caver PMWT So noe able te question

LIRING/S too deeply in some areas and not at all in others, And
we are assuming that ROWTON's cover is effective,

3. SURVEILLANCE - The LIRING/3 operation has teen going
for over a year now and the only surveillance of the agent has been
an abortive attempt at tapping his telephone and an audio device
in the safehouse in thich he. and his wife are now living, His phone
should be tapped constantly, his mail should be intercepted and read, he
should be survéilled for a couple of weeks to establish his pattern
of activities, photographs should be taken of him and his contacts,
and he should be investigated to find out where his money comes
fron, where it goes, what his wife does all day, ete.



4, “SUMARY - After a ye: the operation is aot paying off
as it should and the agency and ROTON are committed to a stituaticn
that could backfire in several ways. Steps should be taken soon to confirm
LIRING/3's access and information and to establish beyond the
shadow of a doubt his bona fide, Headquarters is not at all convinced
that 1) LIRINC/3 believes ROTON's cover story, 2) That LIRINC/3
is in contact wikth the FAR, 3) that the opposition is not playing
