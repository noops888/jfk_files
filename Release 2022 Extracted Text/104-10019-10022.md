Discovery of OSWALD in Mexico City

On 1 October 1963, the CIA Mexico City Station intercepted a telephone
call Lee OSWALD made from an unknown location in Mexico City to the Soviet
Embassy there, using his.own name. Speaking broken Russian and using his true
name, OSWALD was talking to the Embassy guard, OBYEDKOV, who often answers the
phone. OSWALD said he had visited the Embassy the previous Saturday (28 September
1963) and spoken to a consul whose name he had forgotten, and who had promised to
send a telegram for him to Washington. He wanted to know if there were "anything
new." he guard seid if the consul wes dark it was (Valeriy Vladimirovich)
KOSTIKOV. ‘The guard checked with someone else and said that the message had gone
out but no answer had been received. He then hung up.

This piece of information was produced from a telephone tap center which
we operate jointly with the office of the President of Mexico. It is highly
secret and not known to Mexican security end law enforcement officials, who have
their own center. By 9 October, the OSWALD telephone conversation of 1 October

had been transeribed anda summary of it cabled to Washington.



13-00000

The cabled report was received in Washington on 9 October and checked
in our files, where it was immediately noted that the Lee OSWALD phoning the
Soviet Embassy in Mexico City was probably the Lee OSWALD who had defected to
the Soviet Union in 1959 and returned to the USA in 1962. On 10 October 1963,
the day after the report from Mexico City, CIA Headquarters out a cabled
report about Lee OSWALD's phone call to the Soviet Embassy; the report went to
the FBI, the Department of State (because OSWALD was a U.S. citizen), and to
the Navy Department (because he was @ former Marine). The cabled report to these
agencies highlighted the liklihood that the Lee OSWALD mentioned was probably the
former defector. A copy of this same cable was delivered by hand to the.
Immigration and Naturalization Service, with which we have no cable link. The

same day a long cable went out to Mexico City informing our Station of the

‘background of defector Lee OSWALD and asking for more information. Our Station

was instructed to pass its information on the phone call to the Mexico City offices
.

of the FBI, the Embassy, the Naval Attache, and the Immigration and Naturalization

Service. This was done.



13-00000 /-

Our Mexico City Station very often produces information on U.S.
citizens contacting Soviet bloc embassies in Mexico City. Frequently the
information we get is extremely incriminating, and on one or two occasions we
have & even been able to apprehend and return to the USA American military
personnel who are attempting to defect. In all such cases, our Headquarters
desk requests and obtains the special permission of the Deputy Director for Plans
to passthe derogatory information on a U.S. citizen to other government agencies.
We were not informed of what action the FBI and other agencies may have taken at
that time based on our report. Later investigation has confirmed all the details
of his trip, where he stayed, and what he did. To avoid crossing lines with the
FBI, our Mexico Station undertook no local investigation of its om. As we now
know, OSWALD left Mexico on 3 October and was no longer there when our report
wes put out.

Since this telephone tap operation is a joint one with the Mexican

.

Presidency, the Mexicans also had the 1 October intercept on Lee OSWALD, but it

apparently slumbered in their files until the assassination took place.



22 November 1963

As soon as the name of Lee OSWALD was mentioned in connection with the
assassination of President Kennedy on 22 November, CIA file checks were begun
and the Mexican station was asked by cable for more information on OSWALD.
Within a week, twenty-seven cabled reports had been sent to the White House, the
State Department, end the FBI.

CIA field stations provided many lists of information during the week
mf after the assassination. The Mexico City Station researched its telephone
taps very thoroughly and came up with several more conversations probably
involving OSWALD, but not actually mentioning this name; these connected him
also to the Cuban Consulate in Mexico City. Several Mexicans were arrested
and questioned about his activities, giving a good picture of what he was really
up to. A host of fabricators, some anonymous, bombarded overseas embassies
with spurious tips on the case, most of which we investigated. All of these were

®

soon discredited, but they are still coming in.

During this phase of our work, we served primarily in support of the FBI,

which was entrusted by the President with the major responsibility for the

investigation. The Department of Stata’ phatographed its entire file on

”


13-00000

OSWALD and passed them to us, and the FBI gave us a copy of the Soviet
Consular file on OSWALD which had been publicly given by the Soviet Ambassador
to the Secretary of State. On Friday 6 December 1963, Deputy Attorney General
Katzenbach invited us to review the FBI's comprehensive report on the case to
make sure our sources were not jeopardized and that our information was correctly
quoted. We found the report highly interesting and no threat to our security, as
long as it was read only by the authorized investigative bodies.

After the first few days, the CIA investigation of the case was handled
at Headquarters by a steff usually charged xk with investigation and analysis of
the most important security cases, and by officers and analysts of our Western
Hemisphere Division.
Reports from Mexico

As soon as our Mexico City Station realized that Lee OSWALD was the prime
suspect, it began re-screening all the written telephone transcripts in its

.

files m covering the Soviet Embassy for the pertinent period. The actual tapes
were also reviewed, but many of them had been erased after the normal two weeks

wait. Several calls believed to involve OSWALD were discovered mi and their

CC pepeey C

aoe

contents cabled to Washington, where they were disseminated to the White
House, the State Department, the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

OSWALD's name was not actually mentioned in these additional calls, but
similarity of speech and various plain points of content link them to him. ‘These
calls are summarized below in chronological order. They cover the period from
27 September 1963 to 3 October 1963, the whole span of OSWALD's visit to Mexico
City as later learned from travel records.

27 September - A man phones the Soviet Military Attache and says he
needs a visa to go to Odessa. Man answering says he should call 15-60-55 and
ask for the Consul. Caller asks for the address, and it is given to him.
(There is no special reason for linking this call to OSWALD.)

27 September, 4:05 PM - The Cuban Consulate phoned the Soviet Consulate.
Silvia Duran, Mexican national clerk of the Cuban Consulate talked to a Soviet
official, saying that a male American citizen was at the Cuban Consulate asking

.
for a transit visa to pass through Cuba on his way to the Soviet Union. She

wants to know to whom he talked in the Soviet Consulate and who told him he would

have no problem about it. If a Soviet visa is assured, the Cuban Consulate

SEB

-T-

can grant him a transit visa and simply notify Cuban immigration authorities.

The Soviet first asks her to wait, and then she has to explain the whole thing
over again to another Soviet official, who takes her telephone number and
promises to call her back. Silvia DURAN concludes this call by telling the
Soviet she herself has moved and gives her new address for the Soviet Embassy
bulletin. He asks her to phone (Sergey Semenovich) KUKHARENKO (Second Secretary
who puts out the Bulletin) to give him the new address and he asks who the Cuban
Cultural Attache is. Silvia DURAN gives the Attache's name as Teresa PROENZA and
adds her telephone number.

27 September, 4:26 PM - A Soviet officiel calls Silvia DURAN back and
tells her that the "American" had been to see the Soviet's and shown them a
letter from the Soviet Consulate in Washington indicating that he had been
waiting for visas for himself and his wife to go to the Soviet Union for a long
time, but that no answer had come from Washington, adding that the wait was
sometimes four or five months. The "American" had shown the Soviets a letter
showing he was a member of an organization in favor of Cuba and had claimed that

the Cubans could not give him e visa without a Russian visa. Silvia DURAN
er. i
wi



13-00000

rejoins that they have the same problem; the "American" is still at the
Consulate; they cannot give him a transit visa unless he is assured of a Soviet
visa, even though he just wants to go to Cuba to wait there for his Soviet visa
to be granted. He does not know anyone in Cuba. They end the conversation on
this note. Silvie DURAN says that she will note this on his "card," and the
Soviet concludes by saying, "Besides he is not known." He excuses himself for
the inconvenience he has caused and Silvia DURAN says it is all right.

28 September - Silvia DURAN calls the Soviet Embassy from the Cuban
Consulate. She says that she has the American with her again. The Soviet
answering asks her to wait. When another Soviet takes up the phone, Silvie puts
the American on. The American tries to talk Russian to the Soviet who answers
in English. The American asks him to speak Russian. The American says that he
had been in the Soviet Embassy and spoken with the Consul, and that they had
taken his address. The Soviet replies that he knows that. The American then
says, somewhat enigmatically: "I did not know it then. I went to the Cuban
Embassy to ask them for my address because they have it." The Soviet invites him

to stop by again and give them the address, and the American agrees to do so.
&


13-00000

(In this conversation, the American was speaking hardly recognizable Russian.)

As far as our records show, OSWALD did not phone the Soviet or Cuban
Embassies again until Tuesday, 1 October 1963. ‘The intervening days were a
Sunday and a Monday. The contents of his later calls seem to show he did not
contact the Soviets on tim those days.

1 October, 10:31 AM - A man calls the Soviet Military Attache in broken
Russian and says he had been at their place the previous Seturdey (28 September)
end talked to their Consul. They had said they would send a telegram to Washington,
and he wented to know if there were anything new. The Soviets ask him to call
another phone number and gives him 15-60-55, saying to ask for a Consul.

1 October, 10:45 AM - (This is the phone call in which OSWALD used his
true name and which was therefore cabled to Washington on 9 October 1963.)

Lee OSWALD called the Soviet Embassy and announced his own name, saying he had

visited them the previous Saturday and spoken with a Consul. They had said they
.

would send a telegram to Washington, and he wanted to know if there were anything

new. He did not remember the name of the Consul. The Soviet, who was Embassy

guard OBYEDKOV replied: “KOSTIKOV; he is dark." OSWALD replied: "Yes, my



13-00000

-lo-

name is OSWALD." The Soviet excused himself for a minute and then said they
hadn't received anything yet. OSWALD asked if they hadn't done anything and
the guard replied they had sent a request but that nothing had been received
as yet." OSWALD started to say: "And what...", but the Soviet hung up.

3 October 1963 - A man speaking broken Spanish at first and then English
phoned the Soviet Military Attache and asked about a visa. The Attache's office
referred him to the consulate, giving the number 15-60-55. ‘The caller wrote it
down. The attache official shrugged off another question about whether the caller
could get a visa, and the conversation ended. (There is no special reason to
tie this in with OSWALD, who is now know to have re-entered the U.S. at Laredo the
same day.)

Since the operation through which we tap the Soviet Embassy phones in
Mexico City is managed jointly with the office of the President of Mexico, the
information on Lee OSWALD also came to the attention of President LOPEZ Mateos

.
after 22 November. The next day, 23 November, he called it to the attention of
our Chief of Station, who was already working feverishly on the case. Similarly,

the Mexicans noticed the involvement of Cuban Consular employee Silvia DURAN, a



13-00000

Mexican national. Our Station suggested that she be arrested and interrogated

about OSWALD. The Mexican authorities had the same idea and she and her husband

were arrested on 23 November 1963, in the midst of a party at their home. All

the guests were soon released but Silvia and her husband were questioned and

released on 25 November 1963.

Silvia's husband, Horacio DURAN Navarro, an industrial designer, said under

police interrogation that when OSWALD was named as the assassin of President

Kennedy, his wife had recognized the name and recalled she had waited on OSWALD

when he came to apply for a Cuban transit visa; he remembered she had said ke

she dealt with the Soviet Consulate as well to find out whether he had a Soviet

visa. Horacio DURAN recalled his wife had said OSWALD became angry and she had to

call out the Cuban Consul, Eusebio AZCUE, to quiet him.

Silvia DURAN told the same story. She was a leftist sympathizer with

Cuba and had worked for the Mexican-Cuban Institute of Cultural Relations. She

recalled OSWALD well, described him accurately, related how he had wanted a Cul&n

visa but could not get one without the assurance of a Soviet visa, and remembered

his tiff with the Consul. She admitted she had phoned the Soviet Embassy about him.



13-00000

The sum total of the statenents of Silvia DURAN and her husband was
to mkwf confirm that OSWALD was in Mexico to get a Cuban visa so he could wait
in Cuba for his Soviet visa. The Soviet Consular file passed m to the State
Department in Washington by the Soviet Embassy confirms a long exchange between
first, Mrs. Marina OSWALD, and later her husbend, and the Soviet Consulate in
Washington about their requests for permission to return to the Soviet Union. :

OSWALD was still writing to the Soviets in Washington about this as late as

9 Nov 1963.

lay hands on it when he was in the Soviet Consulate that day. Perhaps he
had earlier given the address to Silvia DURAN and wanted to look it up on her
card.

A particulerly sinister aspect of OSWALD's dealings with the Soviets in
Mexico City arises from the liklihood that he met with Soviet Consul Valeriy
Vledimirovich KOSTIKOV. In his 1 October phone call to the Soviet Embassy, the
guard OBYEDKOV suggests that the Consul OSWALD had talked to was KOSTIKOV if he
wes dark. OSWALD seems to agree with this, but the identification is very casual.
In his 9 November letter to the Soviet Consulate in Washington, OSWALD gives the
name of the man he dealt with as "KOSTIN," but there is no person of that exact
name in the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City. KOSTIKOV is accredited as a Consuler
Attache and does actually do a lot of consular work, but he is known, on the
basis of his position, associates, work habits and operational intelligence
activity, to be a Soviet KGB officer, and there is reason to believe, on the
basis of FBI information, that he works for Department 13 of the KGB, the

Department charged with sabotage and assassinations.



13-00000

Embassy guard Ivan Ivanovich OBYEDKOV is himself believed to be a KGB
man from previous assignments as a bodyguard and surveillant. But unless some
direct evidence of Soviet complicity is discovered, it is most likely that
OSWALD's dealing with KGB men OBYEDKOV and KOSTIKOV was nothing more than a grim
coincidence, a coincidence due in part to the Soviet habit of placing intelligence
men in the Embassies in positions where they receive a large portion of the
visitors and phone calls. All of the five consular officers in the Soviet Embassy

are known or suspected intelligence officers. Although it is not usual for a \

KGB agent on a sensitive mission to have such overt contact with a Soviet
Embassy, top secret Soviet intelligence documents which set forth Military
Intelligence doctrine state that very important agents can be met in official
installations using as cover for their presence there some sort of open
business. thus, while it is unlikely that OSWALD's contacts with the Soviet

Embassy hed a more sinister purpose, it cannot be excluded.



13-00000

Some’ insight on ( Cuban attitude toward the ong of Silvia DURAN and

& dei
the involvement of the Cuban Consulate in the OSWALD case can be gained from two

intercepted phone calls made between Cuban President Osvaldo DORTICOS and Cuban
Ambessador to Mexico Joaquin HERNANDEZ Armas on 26 Nov 1963, the day after Silvia
DURAN was released from her first arrest. At 09:40 AM that morning, President
DORTICOS phoned the Ambassador from Havana and asked him several questions about a
report which the Ambassador had sent in on the arrest of Silvia DURAN and the

Lee OSWALD case. The whole conversation is consistent with the theory that

OSWALD had with Consul AZCUE, and he says that Mexican police bruised Silvia
DURAN's arms a little shaking her to impress her with the importance of their
questions. They had asked her if she had been intimate with OSWALD and she had

denied it. President DORTICOS twice asked Ambassador



13-00000

EERHANDES whether the Mexican police kad asked Silvie DURAN questions
about “monzy,” and the President apparently wanted to know whether the
Mextoane thought the Cubans hed paid COWALD momey. ESRMANDNZ insisted
the Mexicana had not offered Silvie DURAN money, and DORTICOS gave

City with about $5,000. Perhaps DORTICOS was trying to learn whether the
Mexican police believed that the Cubans had financed OSWALD. In any event,
im the Cuban Government sent the Mexicans a stiff note of protest over the
arrest and detention of Silvia DURAN, but the Mexicans rejected the note.

At 1445 hours on 22 November, the Yugoslav Ambassador to Mexico, Gustav
VLAHOV telephoned and insisted on speaking to Soviet Ambassador to Mexico BAZAROV.
In a conversation concerning news of President Kennedy's assassination, VLAHOV

sald, "I knew he was wounded even before the Americans." Both then laughed.
