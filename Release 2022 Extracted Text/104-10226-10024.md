REFERENC.

1. Please pouch additional information about the
Proposed devolopmont of “the new AMFRAWE orrunization” in
order to enable Hoadquarters to determine if there is any
conflict with the intent of the LNLOFT nction approving

the termination of AMSCROLL.

2, As you may recall, it was originally thought that
distribution of economic data might be handled by AHHIM,

after termination of ANSCROLL, possibly by creation of an
AHHIM economic desk staffod by former AHSCROLL employees.
In any event, neither Acadquarters nor LNLOPT anticipated
that the termination of one orgunization would be followod
by development of another conducting the same operational
activities. On the contrary, our presentation to LNLOPT
emphasized further reductions of organizational support.

3. In addition to a dotailed description of the
Proposed organization and related administrative and operational
cost estimates, plouse forward more information abogt plans

for distribution of the new series.

AMSCROLL Progress Report

1 - CA Chrono

1 April - 30 Juno 1967 1 ~ RI Chrono

A. OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS

1, During the quarter under review AMSCROLL continued with
its program to discredit the Cuban regime's economic management
(or mismanagement) and to seck to discourage Free World trade
with Cuba, To this cnd AMSCROLL continued publishing 1ts serious
economic studies and comment of the Cuban cconomic arca, This
material is made available to selected firms engaged in inter-

“national trade and shipping, to commercial and technical journals,

and to sugar. brokers including certain banks and others intcrosted
in the sugar trade. AMSCROLL also continued with its radio program

- which is beamed to tho Cuban audience and which is increasingly at~

tempting to provide serious comment upon economic developments in
Cuba or those areas of cconomic activity outside of Cuba which would
have an_intcrost among the Cuban listeners. During this quarter
AMSCROLL :received 15 letters from Cuba which compares with 18 re-
ceived during tho previous quarter, The monthly count was: April -

6, May - 5, June ~ 4,

2. On 30 April AMSCROLL ceased broadcasting over AMTHIGH.
Effective 1 May the program was presented over JMHOPE, This change
in station (and a consequent change in timo) has perhaps effected
the listenership in Cuba; however, we expect that any unfavorable
developments will bo overcome and that this program will at least
re-gain its previous levcl of listeners, Typical themes included
discussions of Cuba's housing ‘problem, its actual sugar production
measured against Castro's earlier claims of what the production
would be, breakdowns and stoppages at the Cuban refineries, activ-
ities with the Sovict Union and the world sugar market, reporting
the progress of the Venezuclan dock workers boycott of ships of
those nations that also trade with Cuba, the fight against bureau-
cracy, and economic aspects of the Middle East crisis.

3. A main AMSCROLL cffort continued to be an analysis of the
current sugar crop, As early as 13 February AMSCROLL predicted a
harvest within the range of 6,100,000 and 6,400,000. By 6 May
AMSCROLL was able to refine the harvest estimate from 6,047,000 to
6,101,000 tons, This estimate was further pinpointed to 6,100,000
tons in a release dated 16 June. . These studies received newspaper -
attention and AMSCROLL has received favorable comment from sugar
brokers and other technicians engaged in this business. As events

Are turning out, these estimates appear to have been sound in-
deed, The AMHIM bulletin continues to give gon replay to those
studies which results in their dissemination threughout Latin

America,

4. AMSCROLL. continued with its monthly release which lista
the Free World ships that trade with Cuba, Both AP and AFP con=
tinued to file this’ information which results in its being pub-
lished in the press and uscd on radio news broadcasts,

5. AMSCROLL continucd its mailing program to Cuba, and
during this quarter mailings approximated 5,000 which is the samo

level as the previous quartor,

B. ADMINISTRATION

6, The amount budgetod for the quarter under review was
$33, 500, 00 of which $13,332.45 was spent, This significant do-~
cline in expenses was. in large part duc to the savings caused
by the cancellation of tho AMTHIGH radio program and by continuod
attention to economies of operation within ANSCROLL itself,

C, PROBLEMS

7. The Station is not aware of any specific problems having
to do with tho AMSCROLL organization, Mention might be mado in
passing of the over presont morale problom (which is by no moans
limited to AMSCROLL) engendered by increasing economies and re-

strictions in operations,

D, PLANS FOR THE NEXT QUARTER

8. A major effort is being mado to revamp the AMSCROLL radio
program to increase its effoctivencss as a reporter of economic
developments of interest to the Cuban listener, Teo often these
programs spill over into the field of political reporting or unin~
formed comment upon developments in economic areas of which tho
script writers are largely ignorant, Our aim is to devise a pro-
gram of economic reporting that will conform to the new guidelines
being developed by the Station for all its radio programs,

FAUNT paces

1) EDITCRIAL! "The Arab Teaching": Arab proverts chow that Araba are wise, They
were not too_wice, however, when they tiox the Soviets as allies and protectors.
Por years, the Musnisns supplied the arsesisl the Arabs were building up to wage

holy war against the tiny Jewish enclave, Furthermore, they reiterated their un=

conditional eupport to the Arabs. But wten the “hour of truth" came, the Israel=

is made plecereal of the Arnbs and their Soviet Military hardware, The Russians

failed to come to the assistance of their ilies, and both were ridiculed to the

fullest extent, This should be a lessen for Fidel Castro, who relies on the

Sovieta! military junk ae much as on thelr support ae "allies".

2) CASTRO HIM:ZL? PRGPITIATES "BURFAUCKATISN™? sfter a brief recess caused by the
mobilization in the cane fields, the ‘wir of bureaucratimn' was renewed with full
vigor by the Havana régime, ‘Two Ministers were fired, whole Ministries were "ra~

tionalized", and payrolls were trimmed to the core, However, the same régine

that volced thrests of pricon terms against those that failed to comply with
antisbureauerstie fnetructions, creates new sources of bureaucratiem, such as,

for example, tne Fook Inctitute and the liz\foral Institute for Forestry Develop~

men and Products.

for Technical Development has several fantertie projects in hand, such as the hare
nessing of solar energy and of the force of te wind, the employment of energy
from tides in scuthern Pinar del Rio, and tie desalinazation of sea water, Buty

on top of their intrinsically fantastic chsrecter, these projects are paralyzed

due to the lack of technicians and cf techrice] handbooks, What great men Marx,

160,000 tons of Brssilian sugar, It seems, we point out, that Morocco is determined
to quit Qubn as a sorar supplier, First ohe develops her own sucor industry, then

buys from Guba’s coapetitors, (Bised on a report carried by the E.I.R.).

tonont concornin; his experience as a CUFLET representative in Lendon, Wo havo ren

printed most of the contents of the statenont in the fom of a signed article enti.
tled "INSIDE CUFLET",

As 4s known, Collazo tolls of the "dog fights" that have ricon botween the privateers
(ouch as FRANGISTAS) and CUFLET over violations of contracts, bad condition of the
shipa, ote.

He also discussos the decline in froo-world shipping to Cuba and its cousos, as well

ag tho nature and background of the shippers that participate in tho Cuban trade,

Bosidos the abovo, the following is included in this issues

PAGE 1s .
EDITORIAL: "A CONMUNIST TRUTH": Volsky, the Chief of tho, Soviet observing delegation
to the CEPAL mooting in Caracas, said that "Cuba is the minor daughter of tho USSR,

and minor daughtors are pampored", The Russian's insolence has roused the anger of

all wolL-born Cubans, Yet, there's a lot of truth in what the Russian said,
Indeod, minor daughters depond on their parents, get ovorything they need from then,

and are subject to their supreme authority, If the daughter works, sho must aleo turn

a good part of the fruits of her toil over to her parents,
This is what happens with Cuba and the USSR. The Soviets and their satellites sell
Cuba 78.6% of hor imports, dictate the policy of the Havana régime, and take 80% of

her exports,

In view of this dependence, who can dony that the relation between Cuba and Russia to
that of a minor daughter with respect to her parents?

The Russian only lied when he spoke of "pampering", Cuba 4s not panpered by Mother

Russia: she 4s oppressed, exploited and corrupted by hers

UNIDAD MONTHLY, ISSUE, NO. 37, Hay, 1967

This issue has been almost entirely devoted to a reprint of I. Andrés Collazo's sta
tement concerning his experience as a CUFLET representative in Icndon, We have re.
printed most of the contents of the statencnt in the forn of a signed article snti-
tled "INSIDE CUFLET*,

As 4s known, Collazo tells of the "dog fights" that have risen between tho privateers
(such as FRANGISTAS) and CUFLET over violations of contracts, bad condition of the
ships, ete.

He also discusses the decline in free.world shipping to Cuba and its causes, as well
as the nature ami background of the shippers that participate in the Cuban trade,

Besides the above, the following is inciuded in this issue:

ve - EDITORIAL: "A COMMUNIST TRUTH": Volsky, the Chief of the Soviet observing delegation
we ssc: ige to the CEPAL meeting in Caracas, said that "Cuba is the minor daughter of the USSR,
and minor danghtors are pampered", ‘The Russian's insolence has roused the anger of

all welL-torn Cubans, Yet, there's a lot of truth in what the Mssian said.

Indeed, minor daughters depend on thelr teantg: get everything they-need frog thea,
and are subject to their suprene authority, If the daughter works, she must als turn
@ gocd part of the fruits of her toil over to her parents. :

‘This 4s what happons with Cuba and the USSR, The Soviets and their satellites soll

her experts, : ic

Jn view of this dependence, who can deny that the relation between Cuba and Russia is

that of a minor daughter with respect to her parents?

“The Russian only lied uhen he spoke of “pmpering". Cuba is not pampefed by Mother

Russia: she is oppressed, exploited amd corrupted by her.

1. On 27 March 1967, a letter from Cuba was received at
the postal address given by the radio program of AMSCROLL,
The letter had been mailed in Habana on 4 March 1967 and the
contents inclided. three photos of an unidentified individual
land one photo each of individuals identified as Reynaldo

“IRSULA Brea and Antonio ‘FERNANDEZ Fernandez. A note which
Was included stated that henceforth tne sendor would identify
himself as™'Parcrasio". He indicated that if it was desired
_Yeceipt of his letter could be mentioned on the AMSCROLL iotatteesdactade
radio program but that never should any mention of the
contents be mentioned as this could reveal his identity to
the DSE. Pancrasio stated his help would not be much but
that his letters might contain information which could be

of value, He wrote that he could not go into detail as

he was unable to spend much time at the typewriter.
Pancrasio concluded by saying the photos of Antonio and
Reynaldo were in the hands of a security agent who had
orders to find them. They had both been fugitives for a
long time. The other photo (in triplicate) was of a
Canadian citizen whose passport was retained by the DSE and
was reported as lost for an unexplained motive.

ELAssINCATION DISPATCH SYABOL AND MUSE

” CONTINUATION OF
DISPATCH SECRET UFGA-27543

mailed from Habana on 13 March and was directed to Guillermo
ALFONSO, 649 William Street, Key West. Typed on oe. of the
two sheets of paper forwarded by Pancrasio was a note saying
this was lotter number fovr fr-= Ponernsin ard requesting
Guillermo ALFONSO to forward the papers to the same postal
address which he had previously utilized. Copies of the
contents of this letter are attach2d under separate cover.
The one paper, dated 27 September 1961, appears to be a

list of Costa Ricans who visited Cuba under the auspices of
ICAP. The second paper appears to be a list of Brazilians
who visited Cuba, probably in mid 1960 when Janio QUADROS made
+f visit to Cuba as part of his presidential campaign in
razil.

4. On 2 May 1967, a JMWAVE Officer visited Guillermo
ALFONSO in an effort to identify Pancrasio and develop
sufficient information to evaluate his information and
determine the extent of his access. ALFONSO claimed he
had no idea as to the identity‘of Pancrasio'and was unable
to suggest possible candidates from his reJatives in Cuba,”
former work associates, classmates or neighbors. ALFONSO
had retained the envelop from Cuba which contained Pancrasio's
second message and a short message to ALFONSO, The note to
ALFONSO stated that PancraSio had received ‘ALFONSO! s name
and address from some unidentified individual and that it was
requested that ALFONSO forward the contents of the letter to
the AMSCROLL address which was enclosed, ALFONSO was
cautioned not to mention anything concerning the matter to
anyone, especially to relatives in Cuba. Pancrasio stated
this was his second letter (not fourth as indicated on the
material which was forwarded on by ALFONSO) and that the

first had been sent direct to the AMSCROLL address. It was
stated this was the first letter by which ALFONSO would

serve as intermediary and that other letters would come aera ee ccanctaee
at infrequent intervals. Pancrasio had decided to use an
intermediary address as the AMSCROLL address was too well
known. Rancrasio concluded his note by saying that he
preferred to remain anonymous and that he would be remaining
in'Cuba for two more years. In addition to the above cited
message, the letter to ALFONSO contained a calling card with
the name Dr_Lue B. INNOCENT, President of the Haitian
Revolutionary Movemen On the back of the card was typed in
Spanish "without comment",

5. JMWAVE traces on FERNENDEZ, IRSULA and ALFONSO are
negative. INNOCENT, according to HZPA-12507, dated 2 August
1962, is a Haitian terrorist, Fidelista, who was planning
to enter Panama from Columbia.

6. ALFONSO was instructed to forward any mail received
from Pancrasio in an expeditious manner and JMWAVE will
follow any leads obtained which might help to identify
Pancrasio in order to develop him into a more productive
source of information.

this economic dependency carries with it an implicit policy

CUBA _AND THE SOVIET UNION: HOW MUCH.

Cuba's dependency on the Soviet Union is known.

statistics for the 1959-1966 period.

We will work under the following economic assumption: Economic dependency of one

country on the other can be indicated to a considerable extent by their trade as this
-Andicates the need one country has of the other as a market for its exports and as

& supplier for its imports.

What we will do is to analyze the Cuban Trade Balance for the 1959-1966 period. *

1) According to the assumption we established regarding trade dependency, we can

say that during 1959 Cuba was dependent upon the Free Horld for its markets as total

trade value for that year amounted to $ 1,305,700,000 and trade value with the Free
World represented $ 1,289,000,000 (or 98.8% of the total trade).

Broken down into exports and imports we see that in 1959 Cuban exports totaled

$ 637,700,000 while total imports were $ 688,000,000. Thus, the trade balance showed

a $ 26,500,000 deficit, which was a reflection of the trend started in 1958 due te

* Every figure in this paper will be given in U.S. dollars unless otherwise
indicated, The sources for the ficures used throughout the analysis, the
‘table, and charts were “The Economist", "The New York Times", UN's Econo-
mic Reports on Latin America, "Cuba Conercio Exterior" magazine, "Visign"
magazine, "US News & World Report", and The Economist Intelligence Unit's
“Quarterly Economic Review",
It should be remembered that the figures refer only to the Cuban Trade Be

» lances i.e., imports and exports, and not to the Cuban Balance of Payments

which would reflect loans and financial arrangements, plus the Soviet mili-
tary and tectrical assistance; figures which do not appear in the balance of

trade and which are not available to us with sufficient authenticity to war=

rant their use.

The trade balance was in favor of Cuba in the amount of $ 68,000,000 as control
of imports, especially from the Free Yorld, established in 1959 was having its effects
3) In 1961 the whole foreign trade picture was transformed. It was almost the i :

reverse of 1960, Total trade amounted to $ 1,253,600,000, of which Free World parti-
Cipation represented $ 348,600,000 (or 27.8%) and Communist trade $ 905,000,000 (or
T2.2k)e : a ae eee .

* We can.look’at’ this ‘another way. In 1960, Cuban exports ‘earned $ 467,000,000 in

hard currencys In 1961, the hard currency earnings amounted ‘to $ 166,800,000 since the

$ 458 100,000 Raed of Cuban exports to the Communist, souneages Tepresented “agreement
value™ or nonthat hard currency value” as the trade was” conducted” under barter agree=

ments, with the Soviet Union providing about 10% to 20% of ‘tte total Cuban export value

in convertible currency.



uF

Cuba was now dependent, economically, upon the Communist World, especially the
Soviet Unton.(ghe fact that. 1ittte hard currency was obtained fron its new trade part:
ners further comnifed Cuba's economy to the Communist Bloc.) a

4) In 1962, the trend continued. Total trade was $ 1,257,000,000, of which
$ 1,031,000,000 (82.1%) was with the Communist Bloc and only $ 226,000,000 (17.9%)
with Free World countries. :

Another phenomenon appeared during 1962, The Soviets, who had been careful, "pot
to press Cuba during 1960 with regards to their trade balance (which was favorable to
‘Cuba by $ 31,000,000), were shrewd enough to close the gap during 1961, The balance

was favorable to Cuba by $ 11,200,000, 3

Clearly, the Soviet pressure was on. In 1962, Cuba faced a $ 227,000,000 deficit
with the Communist countries. Compounding this is the fact that by 1962 Cuba had spent
30.6% of its hard currency reserves in Free World marketse

Dependency upon the Soviet Union arrived to stay as trade with the Communist World
represented 82.1% of total trade and imports from the Communist area hed, for the first
time, surp as sed Cuban exports to the Bloc.

5) Two interesting developments occured in 1963, First of all, total trade with
the Communist Lied maintained the 1962 level ($ 1,031,000,000 in 1962 and
$ 1,054,900,000 in 1963), ,But, the Soviet Union tightened the grip by increasing its
exports ito Cuba to $ 687,900,000 (in 1962 they represented $ 629,000,000), while Cuban
exports to the Gonmunist Bloc decreased to $ 366,000,000 (in 1962 they represented
$ 402,000,000). Thus, the imbalance for Cuba increased to $ 322,900,000 (in 1962 it
was $ 227,000,000). :

recoup Ue
At the same time, Cuba attempted a approach to the Free World markets by taking

advantage of an increase in the price of sugar in the world market (sugar averaged

8.48 cts? per pound during this period). Cuba's total trade with the Free World fn -
ereased to $ 354,300,000 (in n 1962 St had been $ 226,000, 000). :
Nevertheless, the 1963;trade balance worsened-for-€vba—es-it showed a $ 323,200,000

deficit, -The-free-Worid-ceuntries—were—able to turn the tables.on Cuba (as in 1962

6) For 1964, a favorable world sugar market (average price of 5.86 cts. per pound)

encouraged Cuba to continue its flirtation with the Free World, The Cuban treasury

was able to handle some hard currency for the first time in the Castro era and Cuban

conmereial missions were sent to Europe and Japan to purchase items no longer availabe

in Cuba, ic +t
Total trade increased to $ 1,722,000,000 and the Free World participation increased |

from $ 354,300,000 (25.2%) in 1963 to $ 612,000,000 (35.6%). The Free World spending
spree took its toll as the trade balance with the Free World showed a $ 20,000,000 de~

ficit for Cuba. And here, we are speaking of a hard currency loss. 7 H
. Not even in the midst of Cuba‘s affair with the Free World did the Soviet Union
Ee contro) of the situation, On January 20, 1964, Cuba was signing a trade agree=
ment with the Soviet Union by which it was camiting about half of its planned future
sugar production to the Soviet Union for the next six years. The amounts Cuba agreed
to deliver to the Soviet Union were s 2,100,000 metric tons in 1965; 3,000,000 in 1%6;
4,000,000 in 19675 4,000,000 in 19683 5,000,000 in 1969; and 5,000,000 in 1970, The
Soviet Unicn did agree to fix the price of Cuba's sugar at 6 cts. per pound, which

perhaps seems generous in 1967, but hardly a good offer on January 20, 1964, as the
price of sugar on January 19, 1964 was 9.50 cts. per pound. Adding insult to injury
the Soviet Union did not include in the 1964 trade agreement its previous commitment

to provide Cuba with 10% or 20% of the payments in hard currency as it had done in the

| 1960 agreement.

7) By 1965 Cuba was Sending few trade missions abroad, -virturily: ceased-its-hard

of sugar had dropped to 2.12 ets. per pound pf De During 1965 Cuba faced the Soviet Union

more empty handed than before and the general trade situation returned to 1963 levely

except that by now the Communist countries had more participation and the Free World



..Trade with Communist countries also decreased (from $ 1,195,000,000 in 195 to

had less. Total trade amounted to $ 1,551,000,000 (compared to $ 1,410,200,000 in
1963), but trade with Communist countries reached $ 1,195,000,000 (compared to
$ 1,054,900,000 in 1963), Trade with the Free “orld remained at the same level
= $ 354,300,090 in 1963 and $ 356,000,900 in 1945, but sith a difference - the Cu=
ban deficit in its trade balance with the Free World rose from $ 300,000 in 1963 to
$ 60,000,000 in 1965. :

So, the Soviets continued in control as trade vith the Communist countries Te=
presented more than three quarters of Cuba's total trade for that year. The sugar
production had already been mortoaged, the sugar market was depressed, and Cuba was
more and more dependent upcn the Soviet Union.

8) Then cone 1966. Sugar prices decreased to an average of 1.86 cts. per pound,
Total trade decreased to $ 1,465,000,00 as compared with $ 1,851,000,000 in 1965,

$ 1,1€0,C00,000 in 1966) and the Sovietswere able to rush a little further and in -

creased Cuba's deficit in the trade balance from $ 119,000,000 in 1965 to $ 200,000,000 :
fn 1966, 0. : j

Free World.countries also gained. Total Free World trade decreased to $ 305,000, 000
(from $ 356,000,000 in 1965), but the Cuban deficit increased from $ 60,000,000 in '
1965 to $ 65,000,000 in 1966.

Our conclusions follow:

 EIRST : Cuba is economically dependent upon the Soviet Union,

SECOND; This dependency is increasing. It has risen from 142k in 1959 to 7
by 1966, So,

To buttress this conclusion we point out that:

A) Cuba has mortgaged “its sugar production to the Soviet Union,

B) Cuba has exhausted itgshard currency reserves. While an exéct™ figure is,

not available we estimated it to be about $ 20,000,000, in December 1964.

“ , ©) Cuba does not receive hard currency from its trade with the Conmunist

A. OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS

1. During the quarter under review AMSCROLL continued its
campaign to discredit the Cuban regime's economic management.
As before, the campaign was conducted by the AHSC0i! radio
program and by serious economic studies and coment thet were
provided its mailing list of sugar brokors, selected firms
engage.. in international trade and shipping, and commercial and
technical journals. The Station continues to be encouraged by
evidence of increased acceptance of the AMSCKOL!. efforts. For
example, AMSCHOLL received eighteen letters from Cuba during this
quarter, al) of which were in direct response to the radio progran.
wat of romensnen - OF these, twelve were received in March which represents the
highest monthly totai since initiating the program. This compares
with eleven the previous quarter and only three in the corresponding
quarter of 1966. In January, the Vice President of the Association
i of Sugar Producers of Puerto Rico called upon the ASCH:
offices to request AMSCAOL!’s assistance in preparing a chapter
on Cuban sugar production problems to be included in a book this
person is writing. AMSCROLL received requests from four universi-
ties or colleges requesting written mterial, froma graduate
student preparing a thesis on the lot of the Cuban yeasant, from
the U.8. Army Special Warfare School iibrary, and others. The
wire services, particularly Associated Press and Agence France
oe Presse, continued to file stories based upon AMSCROLL releases.

2, The ANSCROLL radio program continued as reported for: the
last quarter--daily except Sunday for ten minutes over ANTHIGH.
: In addition, on 1 January AKSCROLL began a thirteen minute

confined to subjects of an economic nature with the time on
Sunday devoted to an in-depth analysis of what has occurred in
this area since the previous Sunday. Typical themes hit through- . . ~~”

Cuba are boing brought to trial. Throughout this period and
whenever possible a particular effort was made to relate
developments in China to present or possible developments in
Cuba. The difficulties of the Chinese economy provided
examples to which a Cuban "twist" could be put; e.g., the
Chinese and Cuban economic failures demonstrate the failure of
applied communism in the economic area.

3. AMSCROLL is continuing its analysis of the current
sugar crop. Its releases on this subject continue to generate
interest ard the Station has seen coverage in The Miami Rerald,
El Universal (of Caracas), The Times of The Americas, and
Diario Las Americas. ‘The AMNSCROLI. releases on Free World
shipping to Cuba were picked up by both AP and AFP and were
published in the newspapers listed in the previous sentence as
well as The Nontreal Star. The AMHIM Bulletin also carries
the bulk of these releases and we can therefore presume coverage
of at least some of this information in Jatin America. An
interesting study was an analysis of British/Cuban trade which

demonstrates that Great Britain is now getting the better part
of the bargain; this story was filod by AFP as was a story of

the poor quality of molasses being so0id by the Cubans to British
firms. Finally, AMSCAOLL continued to get mileage from the
Daulier-Benz story by reporting that this German firm has finally

and published at least by Diario las Americas.

4. AMSCROLI. continued ite mailing program to Cuba, but on a
further reduced scale. During the quarter about 5,000 were
miiled versus 5,600 during the previous quarter. We count a
distribution during this quarter of 7,127 press releases fe
economic studies to places other than’ Cuba. :

5. A recent development which may have an interesting .—.
operational potential was a telephone call to AMSCROL! from e |
Czarnikow-Rionda, the New York sugar brokers, which was
triggered by an AHSCROLL "case study" of the problems being
faced by a Cuban sugar mill, The firm told AMSCRO!. that 1% has
for some time suspected Cuban sugar production figures and
wondered if AMSCROLL had any such suspicions. AMSCROLL (through /
AMPRAME-1) has written to say it would be most interested in
following any leads from Czarnikow-Monda that could support a :
conclusion that Cuban production figures are false, which is Joe
where this matter now lies, The officials of Czarnikow-Rionda i
are well known to AMSCROLL and we shall be interested in seeing
what the firm developes for AMSCROLL.

A. OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS

. 1. AMMOF maintained contact with party leaders throughout

.-. the hemisphere during the quarter. The majority of the corres-

pondence was handled by AHCRIL/1, the leader of the youth wing,
who was informed by the JUDCA secretery-general, both during his

October visit and in subsequent correspondence, that the AMMOP

. youth wing was performing effective work and that a JUDCA study

Lom gwmngear ren: OB ABKOP activities would be forthcoming. The JUDCA secretary~
general favors the incorporation of the AMMOF youth sector into

his organization.

ie ere 2. AMMOP youth published two bulletins on their activities
along with an interesting suemary on the sctivities of their
counterpsrts in other countries, which was mailed to a list of
contacts and correspondents. Several party officials in other

‘ countries have requested to be placed on the AMMOP mailing lists,

: an indication that AMMOP is becoming more widely recognized as a

representative political novement.

3. The AMBOP youth group has also organized a series of
seminars which attracted from 30-35 participants during the quar—
ter. The purpose, in addition to offering discussions on such
subjects as politica, labor and agriculture, wes to promote more
Group unity and to draw new sources of talent.

8, ADMINISTRATIVE -

4.. During the quarter, expenses totaled $2,075.77. This sum
included monthly support to AHMOP, and salary and orerational
expenses of AMCRIS/1, This compares with a budget allocation of
;. $3,750 for the reporting period.



C. PROBLEMS

8. The difficulties in the operation of the AMMOP project
are due largely to the lerk of effective leadership and initiative.
The AHHOP youth wing is operating with reasonable effectiveness
within its sphere but is kampered by the lack of active JUDCA
membersaip.

YUTURE PLANS

6. Additional sominars are projected for the next quarter.

Both AMMOP acd its youth sector will aaintaia active correspondence
‘to gain recognition es knovled le and active groups. In eddition,
future AMKOP activities will be aimed at crerting a more cohesi
organizational structure, attracting responsible leadership talent
to the or; ization, and gaining greater recognition and possible
financial support and guiducce from the Parent International Move-
moat.

4, The AMKNOT organization remains constituted as reported
an the previous Cuarterly Report. However, in December AMASE-1
was offered a permanent position aw personnel director of a local
shoe company that employs some four hundred people. His starting
salary will be $475.00 per month which will be iacreased rfter
the first three months and increased again after the second three
months, The Station concurred with AMASE-1 that he accept. for
these ons: (1) The AMKNOT position uot permanent, (2)
it appears that AMASK-1 will be terminated when AMKNOT 1a closed,
(8) this position should solve AMASK~1's personal financial prob=
lems, and (4) AMASK-1 has agreed to remain as chairman of AMKNOT
without salary and to continue to lend his name to the organization.
The Station expects to replace AMASK-1 with AMPOLISH-1 who appears
qualified to handle the hand-holding and housekeeping aspects of
AMENOT. AMPOLISH-1 is presently employed by a local automobile
dealer and is able to take the necessary time off to handle the
AMKNOT matters. We see three advantages to this development:
(1) The Station will be spared a possible disposal situation when
AWENOT is closed (it has been made clear to AMPOLISH-1 that this
is a temporary assignment that at the most will last for a f
months), (2) We have offered AMPOLISH-1 $200.00 per month versus
$390.00 for AMASK-1, and (3) AMASK-} should be in an excellent
position to offer at least temporary employment in the shce fac~
tory to mariners to come.

5. An estimated total of $2,505.00 was spent during this
This amount represents AMASK-l's salary and allowances,
xpenses, and English instruction for those seeking MSTS
employment. Expenses by month were: October, $855.00; November,
$825.00; and December (estimated), $825.00. The allotment for
this activity for the quarter was $3,000.00.

C. PROBLEMS

6. The chief problem of the period was caused by the antics
of ho jumped ship in New Orleans after a run-~
in with the ship's captain and after difficulties with the Immt-
gration and turalization Service over the lack of proper documen-
tation vo re-enter the country. bas been resettled in
Califorvia, though we may not ha heard the last from him; AMASK~1
recently received a letter from ich said that |
was about to sue the shipping nl, é employed him for back
salary and loss of personal effects that ‘claims the captain
had locked up. AMASK-1 was advised to ignore the letter in view
of the difficulties already caused and in view of his potential for
further trouble (see paragraphs 2 aod 3 of JMWAVE-3990).

this correspondence was identical with the subjects mentionec ia
paragraph ic above.

3. Impact - In on effort to focus attention on the Cuban
political prisoners issue, AMBASAL/1 prepared 2 15 page document on
this subject which he preganted in person in October 1£66 to the
Human Rights Coumission of the OAS. The president of the commission
told AWBASAL/1 that this document was the best he had seen on the
Subject and the cummission, after discussion, agreed to continue
efforts to get permission to travel to Cuba to investigate the
charges contained in the document. AMBASAL/1 also visited the UN
Human Rights Commission, the Interanerican Federation of Lavyers,
the American Fund for Free Jurists, and the president of the Inter
mationual Red Crosse. All ip all, the effort to focus attention on
the political prisoners issue was successful and resulted in wire
gervice, radio, and press coversge., A total of 23 clippings,
Gealing with AMBASAL/1's activities in ‘this regard, was sent to
Eeadquarters.

4. Radio - The weekly AMBASAL radio programs were carried
by JMHOPE and tapes of each program were sent to SWBULL/1 for
re-broadcast, The content of these programs was in line with
the juridical nature of the AMBASAL organization, although
editorial comment was frequently made on current themes not
specifically related to the legal field.

B. ADMINISTRATION
5. ‘The 1967 fiscal year budget for AMBASAL is $43,000.00.

_On a quarterly basis the allotted figure is $10,750.00. During

‘this quarter AMBASAL expenses amounted to $11,760.72, a total

Of $1,010.72 in excess of the allotted figure, Of the overall
“quarterly expenses of $11,760.72, agent salaries accounted for
$7,000.00, radio expenses amounted to $1,901.72 and $2,859.00

was spent on printed propaganda, operational travel, and miscel-
laneous office expenses. Total operational expenses for the

firet six months of FY 1967 were $23,987.28, an excess of $2,487. an
over the $21,500. 00 allocated for the first half of the fiscal ate

~ year,

C. PROBLENS

6. Termination of the principal agent may be difficult.
-Consideration is being given to the possible future use of
AMBASAL/1 25 a singleton agent. The alternative is to assist him
‘in finding suitable employment; a difficult task given his: age
(42), complete lack of English, and aspects of his personality
and character.

7. We do not anticipate any other probleus relative to
the termination of this operation. The AMBASAL newsletters sent
to Cuba were stopped with the October issue and the monthly
bulletin with the November issue. Four of the AMBASAL personnel
were terminated 31 December and the radio programs were stopped
in December. is

D. PLANS FOR THE NEXT QUARTER

6. Three AMBASAL employees will be terminated effective
31 January 1967 and the AMBABAL office will be closed during that
month, It is planned to permit AMBASAL/1 to retain sce of the
equipment now in his office to encourage him in his plans, to con-
tinue to operate on a scaled-down, independent basis., will
continue to pay a monthly salary to AMBASAL/1 through ‘ch 1967

"4, During the second quarter of FY 1967 the AHLIRA group
compiled a file of nows;aper clippings concerning the political 1
_ ©ceurrences involving the Cuban delegation during the tenth
Central American and Caribbean games held in Puerto Rico during
June 1966, This file was sent in October to Mr. Avery BRUNDAGE, +

_ president of the Internatious! Olympic Coamittee, with tho

<n wswre nn] FeQuast that the file be brought to the attention of the I0C at
the next meeting of that body for whatever action might bo ' >

“2. Significant AMLIRA correspondence included the following:

# a. A letter to each nember of the Special Consultation : “
“, Committee on Security of the 048 pointing out the use nade
by Communist governments, specifically Cuba, of sports for
propaganda and political ends.

boOA letter from the Argentine representative on the
10C in which he acknowledges receipt of a tapa with recorded :
inflammatory remarks by Jose LLANUSA, the head of the Cuban ‘
@elegation at the CA snd Caribbean games in Fuerto Rico. Ina
the letter the Argentine representative deplores such action
as a violation of Olympic principles. This ties in with the
action taken as. indicated in paragraph (1) above.

: c. A letter to the Vevezuelan Ministry of Interior pro~
testing the visit of Yenezuelan athletes to Cuba at the same
time as Cuba is inciting terrorists to action inside Venezuela.

articie on the disqualificxtion of a Cuban woman athiete because
‘she did not coniorm to the revoiutionary principles of the ,
sports movoment in Communist Cuba" anc an articie which refutes
the Cuban c-aim that Cuba won the tenth Centre: American ind
Caribbean ganes.

4. During the quarter the AMLIRA group issued several press
releases concerning sports-newsworthy events involving Cuba and
continued the regular five minute radio programs which are heard
thirty times each week on Radio Americas beamed to Cuba and on
WHIE in Miami. In addition the AMLIKA organization provided
recorded tapes of sports interviews and commentary to 58 indepen-
dent radio stations in Puerto Rico and 14 countries in Central
and South America.

B, ADMINISTRATIVE

“B During ‘the second quarter of FY 67 the AMLIRA organization
expended $17,300 and had income of some $600 from news stand sales
and advertising. Both these figures are approximate projections
because the final December figures sre not recorded at this

writing. The net figure for expenditures during the quarter (aoue
$16,700) exceeds the budgeted amount by approximately $400. However,
this overage will be absorbed in further budgetary cutbacks during
the next reporting period.

6. Tho AMLIRA activity expenditures also exceeded the budget
allowance curing the last quarter. To remedy this situation the
following specific economy measures will go into effect beginning
1 January 1967: :
a. One saleried employee will be dropped. |

Monthly saving....$250

b. Publication of monthly pamphlets with selected
offprints from the AMLIRA magazine will be
discontinued.... Approx, monthly saving....$400

It is expected that there will be other savings which wiil bring
the totnl quarterly reduction in spending to about $2500.

Cc. PROBLEMS

7. There are no major unresolved problems involving the’
: AMLIRA activity.

1. Qn @ October 1966 AMSTAUT-2 «poke in New York before

the anniversary of Cuban Indevendence (Grito de Yara). The

“lackey of international Communisa”,

from the interview was a sympathetic recounting of the AHSTRUT=2
activities on behalf of the cauge of o free Cuba with specific
mention of the AMSTRUT-2 book which is in preparation and the -

3. During November the AMSTRUT-2 Foundation made a contribu=

@ group of Cuban exi from Jamaica to the United States.

4. The AHSTRUT-2 weekly radio spot on AMTHIGH continued vith=
out schedule change during the quarter. Significant themes included:
comments on the degraded role of wozen in the Communist state compared
with that in the free world; reference to the myth of Communist unity
@s revealed by the split between the ChiGoms and the USSR; mention of
the possibility that Cubans will be sent to North Viet Nam tO fight

! 5. During the second quarter of FY-67 there were expendi- 4

i tures of approximately $19,000 by the AMSTRUT-2 activity, This a

j figure includes an estimate for the month of December because j

the final figures Lave not been received at this writing, The 4

budgeted amount for AMSTRUT=-2 for the quarter is $24,600 and there
is an excess of budget authorization over expenditures of approxi-
mately $5000, This figure, however, gives an unreal budgetary
picture of the AMSTRUT-2 activity. Thie $5000 will remain as a
part of the budget allotment and may well be expended in a flurry
of AMSTRUT-2 travel, publication activity and/or promotion during
. tha next quarter. In other words the excess docs not represent
budget. ". gince the bulk of the AMSTRUT-2 expenses are not

‘ figured as month to month constants but obligated as tie operational
situation demands,

7. ‘The basic agent-handling problem presented by AMSTHUT-2's
mercurian) disposition, excessive generosity and understandable
emotional approach to the role which mst be played before the pub-
lic still exists, However, it seems to have lessened somewhat as
AMSTEUT-2 gains confidence in the language and in dealings with the
Public, There is little question that a contributing factor to the
lessening of this problem is the reliance placed by AMSTRUT-2 on
AMLYRIC-1 who serves as business advisor, buffer and hand-holder,

8. The problem of projecting the image of the AMSTRUT-2 Founda-
tion an independent charitable organization remains, The appli-
cation for tax eaempt status to the state of registry is in the works
and when this application is approved it is likely that there will be
an increase of private donations which, because of the new status, will

be tax deductible, The problem iies in the dilatory behavior of the
state authorities,

8. AMSTRUT-2 continues to be attractive to certain extremist
politicsi groups whose patriotic claims of objectives would often
e@ppear to parallel those of AHSTFUT=-2 and the Cuban exile community
as a whole, AKSTRUT-2 has not always been able to sort out the "geod
guys” from the “bad guys” and the problem lies in fending off these
extremist groups and preventing them from exploiting AMSTRUT-2 for
partisan political ends,

describe in detail Greek and Lebanese shipping with Cuba and appear
to have been written by someone knowledgeable of his subject, The
author apparently has access to AMSCROLL publications as he makes
reference to “your circulars", We forward a set of these lettcrs
by separate cover as they may be of interest and of possible use.
The ANSCROLL shipping studies have made a veiled acknowledgment of
receipt of this material by referring to information received from
friends in Greece; however, AMSCROLL has used only those facts that
we can check out here. As indicated on certain of the letters, -

Last week we wrote you few notes regarding illegal Cuban trading iT

also that the Greek authorities , no doubt through "sa pressure (aT LAST), ‘
are now investigating... nenes of ships and Owners who have been brading 3
‘with Cuba illegally since 1963, There is nov quite a lot of prop: :
going on thet these investigations will be expedited tnarougan the
asters in Greecs, and Consular Authorities in ports outside Greece. i
“* nis news is of course to please USa, and to send to sleep those who i
“. Know nothing about the business, ordinary public opinion. As we said . i
befors nothing much will te done, except some isolated, probably,cases, 4
. *. mostly of small Owners , to just please Usa etc., In fact, notaing will

. be done, because the Cree Authorities will firstly have to punish
TH&:SsLVES before they can punish the Owners, Captains eto., mainly for
the following reasons:

I, The Greek Authorities know at el? tinas where Greek ships are
trading, through their sbdecial Depurtnents, They knew and

know where the ships were and are, and have never done anytaing
about it.” Es

CUBAN TRADING

We expected by now some action from your end or from the American
Authorities to whom we had sent our previous copied communication %o
you(Washington,Foreign Ministry, and U.S.A, Embassy,London), but regret
that, at least to our knowledgs, no action has been taken yet, and we
assume this by virtue of the fact that the ships we mentioned previously
just carry on the voyages for which have been fixed, and their Owners
openly negotiate further similar business from Tuba , as most of the
trade to Cuba is presently done by Red flag ships. However, we wupplement
-our previous letter by gtving you some additional {nformation.

.Ae Bome Kerobants in Cuban Trading, but mainly D.'Enree, of Paris and Gene
fix vessels or large oggtracte » with a long list of options as to
where the cargo will/discharged, as often cargoss are shipped end not
gold until] after shipment and sailing of the vessel from loading port.
These options start from Casablanca/Continent and continue into all
Maditerranean/2ed Sea/P.Gulf/Iniia/Colombo;Malaya ports,socetimes as

far as Japan, freight rate depending at *hich port cargo is discharged,
and fibal orders are usually given seven cays after sailing from Cuba.
‘As stated, the Lebanon Authorities oestensibly allow Lebanon flag ships
‘to carry these cargoes to Arab Countries only, always subject to
lfecense. Owners apply for such license for Arab countries, and then
‘Gf the. Merchant ordors the ship to say Italy or Germany or Japan, the
ship just carries the cargo. Some Owners just do not apply for a license
at ell, end the Lebanon Authorities know what goes on, but turns tae
other way. Erastste

= |B Greek and Lebanon flag ships just carry on trade in Cuba, and if you

say they fo not, then either you do not know about it, or they must
sanouflage their flags , or must fake ( as regards eventual destination)
thoir documents , suoh as charter perties , Bills of Leading, manifests
eto., Even the number of ships trading in Cuba , given in your E
‘circulars , is not correct , it 1s much larger, may be you do this
fntentionsiiy Tor political ressons or maybe because you do not know.

6. Both the Greosk and Lebanon Govermrents are in a position, in accordance
with their fenous laws, to stop imnediately any ship , to taxe the
fleg eway , and to impose upon the Owners very deavy fines end if the
-Gmors.do not pay the fines, then the ship will be imaobilised since
the Goverment wili rofuso cancellation of registry certifisate, meanang
that the ship cannot be put in a nother flag, and thefefore, bescue
virtually not-oristent. They caa do lots of thigs, these Coverments,
but cnly if they want to and only if they want to apply their laws.
fo our knowdedge, and wo oan assure you, ve arevery'w51l informed, no
evoh thing hea taken plece , no ship has been stopped and no one has

some of the american money has gone for the purchase of ships to help
trade with Castro's Cuba, whilst millions of american money is spent to
stop this trade. what a world we live in,

f,It must be very obvious to you that many people, watchful people, intelli-
gent and influential , know what goes on, and will continue to watcn
things until, it ig noped , this mockery is stopped. It is also obvious
that somewhere-jn one or pore places, bribery and corruption are taking

Wa do not intend continuing these letters, .we think we heve said enough .

Wie wrote you few dsys ago about the iilegal cuban trading and we now
enclose herevith cutting from to¢ays , 5th November 1965, Pirseus Newspaper
"NarlILIA s¥PRuSS " from whien you will observe that action is now being
teken ( three years too late and after millions of ons of cargo has been
carried to and frou Cuba) against Ovners, Captains etc., of sreek ships.
The Greek Xinistry of reantile Karine are elso instructing port Autho-
rities to enquire ond investigate woica ships traded witn Cuba since 1963.
You see , until now , or even now, the winistry did not know... and now
they will try to find out. No doubt owing to some half haarted pressure by
the USA authorities , the Greek Authorities are at last compelled to at

1s least show that they sre trying to finfl out , now , wnich ships traded, -
algo no doubt they will find some ships which traded and will prosecute
the Cadtains and the Owners, and perhaps carry out some sort of punishnent
and naturaily it will be the small und unimportant Owners they will trace.
The biz and influential will not even be tfaced. If ore nas to bs traced,
like Frengistas, they vill find all necesssry excuses and reassns for
not prosecuting. fhe job for enquiring , prosecuting, and purishing the
3 offenders is left with those with whose connivance ani knowledge trading
continued since 1953, and still continues, so anyone can imegine, what
kind of a Job they will do. ‘fe wonder why no enquiries were made during
I063, 1964 , Iee5, 3irn o2cause enquiries were not necesssry. You do
not enquire about something you already know, The latest excuse of Pren-
“-gistas, as'we think you already know, comes throigh his brother, wao is
_ @ Professor in Salonica University, thst the law prohibiting Subsn trading
= was Unconstitutional. This joxe was as good as any, evon better than the
one ebout his false or fake contracts and charter parties. His other brother
, >; who is the reel tafluence with the Russians and is a timber mercaznt having
. the monopoly of#all Russian timber imports into Greece and soue fruits
- from Greedy to Russia,’ is the one who helped to secure che building in
os Russia of some 35 lerge liners and bulk carriers plus a huge 7ish trawling
fleet, in exchange for Greek products, and 2ort payment if ca: rer the
vast profits thoy made out of their 35 seconi huné liberty vessels in
Cuban trading. cven in this respect, do not forget that this privilege
of building these fleets( and we understand further building contracts
are cooxing) was only given to the rrangistas clique by the Greek and
Russian Authorities ,end not to any sther Greek Ovmer. Do the USA Authori-
ties really think that the Greek Authorities ( and in a smaller degree
the Lebanon Authorities) w11l prosecute Frangistas, and even if they do,
for eyewesh , they will find him guilty? You will see that nothing will '
happen. ‘Yhat we now have to say, as the only solution, may seem unpatriotic,
but it is the only way to stop this rot, This is that the Usa sh dis-
continue imiediately , and v'thout any notice, all Military and f{nanctial
Aid to Greece and Lebanon, with intimation to them , that they will
consider renewing s: » 28 soon as firstly ALL trading with Cuba is stopped
immediately disregarding any so calleé old contracts, and secondly AFTOR
. they have prosecuted and punished veroperly all lawbreakers," szall-and
big ones alike, and after all flags have been cancelled. This seconé action
is a big ‘debt the USA Authorities owe to all the Greek“and Lebanon Owners
who complied withe laws 2f their ccuntries and executed the wishes of the
Usa. It ‘is a moral debt. These people will gain nothing becuse they
do not ask for any money for 311 fortunes they lust in not trading with
Cuba, dut the You,as a country krown as just and democratic, will have .
failed in their duty if they are coment to just see discontinuation of eee
further trading witi Cuba , and no punishment for the past sinners. an& a
talking of sins , we think that the Greek and Lebanon Authorities conaitted

_CUBAN TRADING

Your circulars regarding, Cuban affairs and trading contain useful
information but it seems that neither you nor the American Authorities
are well informed. You know that, through Anerican pressure, the Greek
Government banned,several years ago, all treading with Cuba for Greek flag
vessels, except few which were on timecharter and were allowed to ran 4
their charters, w.ich finished a very long tine ago. Similarly, the Lebano’
Gbvernment banned all trading with Cuba for Lebanon vessels, fe months
ago, and only allow, subject special licence, their ships to carry goods
from and and to countries of the Arab League. Both countries passed laws .
to this effect, and both state that infringement 68 the law carries very
heavy fines against the O:mers and Nesters, and withdraval of the flag.
That is what the laws say, but what is actually happening is another
matter, Greek and Lebanon flag vessels have continued, since banning,
to be fixed, have carried and are carrying cargoes, through 4 nunber of
Owners, such as Yrankistas( Franco Shipping Co. of Lisbon and Athens,

.per Purvis shipping Co. London, their U.K. Agents), buikk owning about
35 Greek and Lebanon flag Liberties and similar vessels, also Vlassopoulo,
Livanos, etc., also owning a great nunnber of ships with these flags.
They simply say they do not care a dagn about the ban, and continue to
making fortunes in the Cuban trading, the reason being that as most iienant
other law abiding Owners vith these flags do not go to Cuba, the market
remains wide open for these people. They do not even try to hide, they
just fix treir ships, tiostly in the Baltic xchange, London, and Athens,
but also direct with Charterers in Poland, iiungary, Boulrgaria,

kussia, etc. and with Paris, and Geneve. The Governnents of Greece and
Lebanon, who made the laws, just look on, doing nothing about it, and
this means that the laws were made, for paper value only. Some of these
Owners fix their ships by name and flag, others just fix a contract

to be carried by ships, to be nominated later, and later they nominate
greek and Lebanon ships. Only the last few days, the following were fixed
on the Loncon market: . Frankistas, 50.000 tons sugar from Cuba to England
for sugar Merchants Tate and Lyle, London, to be carried in 2 or 3 months,
and Frankistas has already nominated the NICOLAOS F.(Greek flag) and

San Spyridon (Lebanon flag), fpr 20.000 tons and the remaining 30.000
tons are being nominated also for Greek and Lebanon flag ships.The same
Qwmer just also fixed one cargo for “almo(Sweden), and one to Gdybia,
Poland, He is presently negotiating several other cargoes, fr his

large Greek and lebanon flag ships, wth the aforementioned concerns,
including another contract with Dt Enreo of Paris, via Geneve.

The AIS GIANTS (Lebanon) was fixed with Dreyfus, Landon , few days

ego, to carry a cargo of beans from Vera Craz and Tampico to Cuba, and
after for sugar to Europe . Another concern trading with Cuba is
Tsavliris of London and Athens ,but this firm is not trading with Greek
Lebanon flag ships.

The World thinks that you and American Athorities know all that goes on
in Cuba, If so, it means that neither you nor Auerican Authorities Know
and do not mind such trading with Greek and Lebano ships if they know.
We have given you some details of th: latest fixtures. You and American
Authorities can check up without any thouble and when they verify the
correctness, they will no Bonbdt protest imnediately to the respective
Governments, ask them to stop immediately the carriage of these cargoes
and punish their Owners etc., as per their laws, and demand log books,
-freight accounts, etc to verify all past trading, a tremendous one. If
they tex’ or you, do not do anything wout it, it will mean that both
you and American Government knew and know about this illegal trading and
do not mind, in which case, we can more then essure you, that witnin the



“68 : 5

next few weeks, the so far law abiding Ormers of Greek ond Lebanon flag
vessels, will also re-commence or start trading to Cuba, for the sinple
Teason thet they will feel that they are breaking no laws, since they
who asked the Governments of Greece and Lebonon to pass the laws, do
not mind if they ere not complied with. It remains,hovever , a great
mystaery, beczuse we cannot baieve that the Anerican Authorities do not
know about this trading and why they have not protested to the Lebanon
ai and Greck Governments,and if they do not know, then there is something
a very drastically wrong with thelr Intellig-nce.

te Anonymous letters are not good things, in fact quite deplorable, but
we trust you will understand the reason for anonymity in this case, and
since vou will no dovbt like to know who wrote it, wecan tell you is
written on behalf of some people who are very bitter and disappointed i!
that their compliance with the law puts them in disadvantage, especially
if it is proved that to comply with the law does not pay. «ve have :
given you sufficient information to check facts imneiiately and stop |
all tne wrong doors. If they are not stopped, then your circulars will

have to incrase,in the very near future; the number of Greck and Lebano
ships trading with Cuba.

jnother ‘example 4s that “the food quota on the ration boot is largely a.
"paper" reality. What I mean is that the food on the book is rarely available,
and whole months pass without any meat, lard, o12, rice, beans, being distrib-
uted. At this precise tine, in Havana, there are no seasoning ingredients avail-
able to the consumer, When the product is available again, the meager book
quota 1s what each one gets, vithout any compensation for the tine during which

what they sek is-to extract money from circulation, as the prices at. these new

TORAGCO :

‘ves associated with the tobacco oxporting onterprise (Empress CUBAMBt~
CO) for four years ineluctng.three yoars as Assistant Yanager. I am happy to
naka ay firet hand knowledge ‘available,

"This tadustry 46 canothor exanple of tho administrative clumsiness of the
Goninuniste, Once the.second industry of Cuba, and the source of great prestige
for our country, 4t seems to be dooned to total doctruction eince the Conmnist
régime took control of it.

Leaf tobacco production has declined by over 30% comparing the 1965 ‘Tgure
(32,000 H.T.) with the traditional production of over 45,000 M.T. yearly, The
best tobacco fields of the famed Vuelta Abajo zone, which’ gave the best wrapper
in the vorld, have experienced a sharp decline of over 70s in yteld ani quality,

due to Jack of fertilizers and the necoscary care.

About 20% of the plantations are affocted by tho bug, as the fields and
curing sheds are not ‘sprayed. The INR\ policy: of vory low prices paid and lack
of incentives givén to the most efficiont producers has forced the producers to
divert their lands-to less risky and more profitable crops, This is particular-
ly true. of the Remedios and Cabaigudn zones, Peasants trained in tobacco grow=
ing have been absorbed: by cane growing areas in order to remedy the critical
manpover eftuation in the latter, but at the expense of inflicting grave damage
to the tobacco economy,. This has brought the incorporation of "volunteer" worke
ers to the cropping of the leaf, which workers, due to their inexperience in _

- such a ee work, break the leaf, with. the redulting damage to its qual--

ity.

Industrial Aapect.- - - : : . 2 2
Tho industrial phase of the tobacco daduatey haa fot becn better off, and -

in our opinion it bas been the one that hae suffered most from the inconpetency -

of the régime, The quality, prosentation, and production volume of Cuban cigars
has beon seriously affected, not, as fer as production for national consump-
tiori 4s concerned, ‘but also as regards the portion designed for export. It vould
be endless to list the wronge that have been done, but they may be outlined thus

1) Loss of quality due to the use of raw leaf tobacco and without thee Ree
essary aging. zs :

2) Failure to deliver to foraign customers due to thé lack of ntersediate
materials to finish the product, such as? aluminum tubes for packaging these
cigars, aluminum cases, holders, rings, cedar boxes, ete. :

3) Continuous complainte are received from foreign Saportere, ave to the
detection of high percentage of wormed cigars,

4) The traditional blends that gave charact-r to each of the traditional
brands have been changed and altered, which has resulted in the imaginable loss

of quality and prestige.

5) Incorporation of Anoxpertenced personnel to the preparation of sate

“Regalia”, (top-quality, hand-nade) cigars, which affocts the finish of the ‘hand=

forafting cigare-sith the result ‘that undersized, oversized, or too-heavy cigars

are produced, 2 i i:
These: and. siany other irregularitios take place today in our thduatry,

mithout dng to .-mention that tho climax of all this situation is caused -|

the lack“of:cigara-for national consumption, something definitely unpreceddnted

Cuban Communist régine faces -groat difficulties in.ite offorte to make

“ dollars through tobacco exports, and come of them have boen pointed out already.

Nevertheless, I believe that the chief trouble to reprosonted by tho-mr=
ket lindtationa suffered by Cuban tobacco today. Castro has been unable to cone
vince his Iron Curtain "friends" to purchase the volume that was formorly ab-
sorbed. ty" the U.S., Ho-has only porcusdéd the USER, Czechoslovakia, and East
Gormany.to tuy a totel of approximately 5,000 .M.T.. Tho truth, however, fs that
‘those oxporte -have been mdo with distrust, ag thore have'been roports that Cue
ba's friends", after buying this tobacco, . re-expert it to hard-currency cout -
tries at lower "prices than those etablished by the “Empresa CUBATIBACO'
free world market.

I iiay cite a apecific’ faetance of this, Late in 1962,

“tho Polish enters.

prise ROLIWPEX boiight approxitately 600 tons of totacco, The contract epecific=

and provided that any logal diffi

ally prohibited re-oxportation by the Poles,
After the deliver=

culties that might arise would be submitted for arbitration.

“tes wore rade to ROLINFEX, roporte began to arrive from the Freo European market

Cuban tobacco Iéaf was being offored at a mich lover prico than that estabe
ished by the Cuban exporting enterprize in its sale of tobacgo to Free Europe.
At first, £t was thought that ‘this vas ofily a manouver for lover prices. by the
European importers, bit, as time passed and CUBATABICO could not place any sales,
the reporta, which tore still coming @ given more credence. As a result
of this, I was sent. to:conduct an on-the-spot investigation in Europe, and, eure
enough, I discovered that the Poles wore indeed re-exporting our tobacco, with
complete dterégard of their signéd agrooment with Cuba, The. violation was re~
ported to the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Trade, which instructed CUBATABACO to
institute proteedings to recover:damages fromthe Poles. Cuba sued for fi mile
lion end the Poles, having being caught red-handed, offered a settlemnt of
950,CCO which was accepted. The payment was made in dollars, out of. the Polish
Cuban clearing. - ~ e

This "international solidarity" practiced by Communist countries kept Cuba,
for a long tine. (192-1963) from entering Western Curopean markets,

Dumping as practiced by these countries, the lack of adecquate stocka for
the Europeans taste, difficulties and delays in deliveries (due to shortage of

“ ghips) have made the Europeans shy avay from buying larger quantities of Cuban

leaf, .and, many European importers have es that Cuba is not a reliable
source of supply.

Due to the above stated reasous, the Communist régime can barely place
2,000 H.T. in Weetern Burope, for an arnual revenue of about U561,500,000.

‘1 July - 30 September: 19668

Ae, OPERATIONAL HoH. leurs

1,” This quarter oponed with an tnteronl reorganization of
AMSCROLL becoming effective. The reorganization had been under=
taken in the interests of efficiency and economy, The Departments,
of Labor, Women, Foroign Affairs, Coordination, and Youth were
abolished. This action got rid of largely ineffective people who
had been receiving salaries and will prevent dissipation of AMSCROLL
funds and: energie: The new, stream-lined organization is better
able to concentrate upon the field it knows best: economic action.
With ite present staff it is also able to undertake action in
political, youth, and the other fields should this be desirable,

2. ‘The major activities of AMSCROLL during this quarter foil
into four categories, They are economic activities, Pree World
shipping to Cuba, dissemination 6f Propaganda, and the AMSCROLL
radio program, i

a. - In the economic field AMSCROLL continued its analysis of
“the. 1966 sugar harvest that officially ended at 11:00 p.m, of 27 June<-
though wind-up activities continued into this quarter, The point of
the post-mortem was to publicize why Cuba fell so far short

these releases in the Miami Her j the M1. #3; the Economic
a a London publication; Alerta, & publication in

Diario Lan Americas. In ‘ion. appropriate Station assets such as
replay much of this information. The point of this was to
demonstrate to Free World commercial circles and to the Cuban radio
audience that Cuban ecouomic promises are not reliable and hence
that Cuba is an unreliable nation with which to tr In support
of this theze this quarter also marked the beginning of the campaign

story was prepared from an AM! that was mailed

Also during this quarter AMSCROLL released other studies:
of an economic nature on such subjects as Cuban trade with Spain,
the status of the Cuban oil industry, and the failure of mechaniza=
. tion of the Cuban sugar industry, The bases of these studies wero
provided by the Station, often from information provided by qualified
refugees arriving vio the air lift. In other cases, AMSCROLL

personnel-~particularly AMFRAME-l--would interview some of these eaiies
refugess. :

b, A continuing effort was made during the quarter to
publicize Free World shipping with Cuba. 5 Cie

subject in U.8., Canadian, and English publications came to the
Station's attention during this period, : eS tote

i c. During this period 16,000 pieces of printed material

of banks, business firms, etc. in. the U.8., Europe, and Japen.

B. ADMINISTRATION e \

‘3, .The amount budgeted for the quarter under review was
$36,750.00; whereas, "$33,873.00 Was spent. Of this amount $11,217.00:
vas for nalarioa and $22,656,00 for Operational expenses which 5
included office maintenance, A determined and successful effort
ba en made to keep actual expenses under the budgeted amount.
Important to this was the reorganization described in A.1, above
which in salaries alone amounted to a monthly reduction of $1,200.00,
ational and housekooping oxpensés have also been reduced over
ious months with, the Station belioves, an improved operational

Pp
result,

c. PROBLEMS

* 4. The Station bolieves that-it has overcome a source of
potential trouble by pressing the reorganization of AMSCROLL that
became effective 1 July in that persons who in thé past. had been
trouble makers were Gased out. ‘Tho only remaining problem is the

. ever-present one of AMFRAME~] ‘who is capable of earning considerably

more than the Station is paying. AS an intelligent, aggressive
person with a growing family he 1 svoner. or-later have to face

up to this personal problem of his. He prefers to remain in the work.
he is now doing for WOFACT which, coupled with a recent salary
increase to $450.00 a month should combine to retain him at least
for the near future. His wife has recently received an impressive
monetary prize of an academic nature and AMFRAME-]'s family in Vene-
zuela is currently supplementing his WOFACT pay, which factors also

help.
D. PLANS FOR NEXT QUARTER

reorganized and we are hopeful that we can effect sdditional

economies. Operstionally the Station has these specific projects
in mind which are. in addition hd the normal activities:

a. AMSCROLL will attempt to push further the Station=
developed story of the apotled ‘Cuban lobster: with the goal in
randed of dubious quality in Cnuiada, France, ©

and other’ countris!

b. The Station has begun its utilization of AMBCROLL ‘to
analyse the 1967 sugar harvest. As for the 1966 harvest, AMSCROLL's
final projection of the results of the harvest was made on 23 May,
some five weeks in advance of tho 29 June official Cuban announces
ment. AMSCROLL predicted a harvost of 4,496,400 tons, only 41,145
tons over the actual figuro, We know of no one who came this é1os
We have observed with interest how such forecasters as Merrill Lyn
offered figures that came oven closor to the ROLL projections |
as tho final harvest date approached, We hope to repeat —

performance for the coming year,

¢e. At the close of this reporting period the Btation ‘began .
gu. to discourage Japan-Cuban trade in favor of expanded

trade with other Latin American nations. This campaign

4 the concurrence of Headquarters and Station Tokyo (DIRECTOR=-36495

and TOKYO-9662), AMPRAME~1 and AMSNAKE~1 are boing utilized to

implement this campaign insofar os Latin American business organiza-

It may be of interest that the publication of the articles

2. Through GUSPOT-2 Madrid Station nado contact vith Iden-

agreed wih the directors of Identity that the articles would

be paid for at the same rote as paid advertisements; however -
they would appear as exclusive reports of Identity and bear

Ro resemblance to a paid advertisement. Eecause of various.
legal ramifications, Identity agreed to publish only those
articles which were signed. : :

he was affilinted, tho headquarters of ehich are ostensibly

would furnish the material directly to Identity, with a copy
to QUSPOT-2, who, after recéipt of the article, would then —
®pproach the directors of Identity to ascertain the price
of the article and push for its publication, Ia this regard.
Madrid would appreciate continuing with this practice for the

‘1. A result of QUSPOT-2's recent holiday in the JMWAVE area has
beon to establish a correspondence between him and. AMFRAME-1, the
signer of the Suplemento Especial of the ANSCROLL Economic Bureau, a
copy of which Is forwarded by separate cover, QUSPOT-2 has indicated.
that he could use ANSCROLL economic studies and that he could arrange
for publication of at least some of these in Identity A. He suggested:
that the original of such publications be sent to Identity B with a
copy to him, -This was done in the case of a recent economic report
which was shortly thereafter published in Identity A- QUSPOT-2 air-
mailed this story to AMFRANE-1 which arrived at about thé same time
as the copy the Madrid Station airmailed to the JMWAYZ overt address,

Identity B with a copy to QUSPOT-2 per QUSPOT-2's suggestion, JMWAVE -
foels that this is a useful mechanism and unless advised to the
contrary we propose to' forward additional AMSCROLL studies to Identity. B
for publication in Identity A. Should Madrid prefer we, of course, can
in the future forward such articles directly to the Station for
placement instead of airmailing them to Identity B.

3. Studies similar to the one being forwarded are regularly
prepared in English on a number of economic subjects. They are
distributed to shipping firms, certain banks engaged in international
commerce, international trade organizations, international commodity
houses, etc, They are translated into Spanish solely for use in ~
Identity A; thus, in this sense, these reports are an “exclusive". _

LA CALIDAD. ACTUAL DEL _AZUCAR CUBANO.

Por el Ingentero Ral Esparza Tabares
ex-Director de Investigaciones Tecno-
légicas del Ministerio del Aziicar (MINAZ) de Cuba Comunista

Este breve andlisis de 1a calidad actual del azdcar cubano va dirigido tanto al
ferito en azvcares (como paso inicial de lo que podrfa convertirse en un estudio mas
téenico y exhaustive) como al lector ordinario, toda vez que, en Cuba, el azvcar es
Gasi sindnimo de rrosperidad econdmica, y asf, 18 calidad del azJcar desempefia.un pa
pel de gran importancia en. 1a situacién econémica global del psfs (1). ca

Sin mas: comentarios o notas ‘de introduecién, ofrecemos a continuacién el anélie
sis de la calidad actual del azdcar cubano:

len Materias. Extrafiags

a) AzGcar crude: La industria azucarera cubana se caracterizaba por recibir
ra su cocesanfento, la mejor calidad de caiia de aztear en cuantc a su contenido de
materias extrafias (menos del 3%). Actualmente y por causa de los trabajadores * vo-
luntarios" por un lado y por otro a la mecanizacién de-la cosecha de la cafia, las ma-
terias-extrafias que acompafian a la cafia a) llegar al Central para su procesamiento =
ha aumentado al 8% en el caso de los voluntarios y al 19% en el caso de las méquinas ©
de cortar cafia.soviéticas,. Es: de. sefialarse que dentro de la composictén de estas ma
terias extrafias ests indvfda la tierra, y como quiera que las tierras de Cuba tienen

su comrosicién un alto contenido de arcillas, estas son muy diffciles de eliminar
en el proceso’ tecnolégico de prificacién y afectan grandemente la calidad del azif -

cat CrUGOs

b) Agicar Refino: Las materias extrafias, princi palmente arcillas de las tierra’
llegan hasta el icar refino d4ndole color al mismo y dejando residuos insolubles
al ser disueltas esta azvcar. ‘Esto disminuye 1a calidad del azUcar refino no sola =
mente para el consumo humano directo, sino que ocasiona graves perjuicios en les in-
dustrias de alimentos que utilizan el azJcar refino. Lo mismo sucede con las indus=

trias de refrescos. :

(1) No es neceserio ensalzar 1a calidad del azdcar cubano que producfa
Castro, ya que su prestigio en el mercado mundial es un hecho de ‘a cong
cido. Lo mismo puede decirse de los técnicos cubanos en azfcar, con quie =
nes los expertos internacionales han tenido amplia oportunidad de discutir
los asuntos azucareros Chania iia ¥ sugerencias libremente, Esta

situacién ya no existe. _

a) Azdcar Crido: El {ndice de color de los azUcares crudos ha aumentado casi en un

las refinerfas,

b) Azdcar Refings Este es uno de los, factores importantes en 1a calidad de los a:
cares refinos © blancos, y en los aiios recientes, debido a deficiencias tecnolégicas,
a la ausencia casi total de técnicos con experiencia, y a la baja calidad de los mat
riales decolorantes tales como el Carbén Activado suministrado por Polonia y la Unién
Sovistica, e1 {ndice de color, medido en Unidades ICUMSA, ha aumentado en un 200%. Es
de sefialar que ninguna refinerfa del pafs cumple las especificaciones en cuanto al {ne

STATEVENT OF RAUL DE LA RUA CiSTRO,=

My name {5 Rail do 1a Ria Castro, and I vas the Chief Engineer atoard the Cuban MV
STERRA MESTRA until March 20, 1946, vhen I jumped ship in Maroran, Japan,

Working conditions in the Cuban Merchant:Fleet @lso influenced my decision, I
could not stand the inteneified espionage on board by menkers of the G-2. It is
worth mentioning that the plan to indoctrinate Cuban merchant crews was a complete
failure, The regime has atardoned the project altogether, an? io now trying to
place loyal Communists as officers and crowmembors, even if they are not qualified
for their jobs,

fs a matter of fact, the lack of qualified personnel 1s an increasing problem, and
another source of trouble aboard Cuban veseéls. During the lact months a total of
twenty nine officials, officers and crewmembers of the Cutan Yerchant Marino have
defected (data of up-to-date merchant mrine score). After I quit the SIERRA MAES
TRA, for instance," “there was not a cingle certified enginecr on board, although
there were several young fellows getting on the job training. Thie is a fact that
should be taken into congideration by the ‘insurance firms that underwrite Cuban

vessels, 2

Most of the vessels are faced with all sorts of mechanical difficultics, due to
lack of spare parts and a very faulty maintainance, situation tkat gets worse when
consider the scarcity of qualified personnel just mentioned.

Iam very happy to have Joined those of my fellow Cuban officers who preceded me
in this decision, I wish’ to thank the "Free Cutan Merchant Marine Committes" for
all the attentions accorded me, and I hope to rejoin our merchant fleet soon, vhen
our vessels again sail inder the flag of a free country.

en Mererdiy Japén, ; : z

las ‘cendiciénes.de trabajo en la Marina Mercante Cubana fueren uno de los motivos
que ne Lievaron a tomr mi dooisién, Tampoco podfa continuar soportando el espio-
saje y 1s vigilancda a bordo por miembros dol G-2, Vale la pena mencisnar que el
plan de advctrinamiento para. los niembros de las dotaciones de la flota rercante
cubans ha fracosado completamente. £1 régimen ha abandonado dicho plan y lo tnico
que hace ahora ea custituir a los que abandonamos los buquos por personal “politi-
camente apto", pero caronte do capacidad técnica para desempeviar los cargos,

De hecho, el régimen confronta un serio problona ante 1a escases de persenal técn§,

los teques cibanos, Durante los vltimos meses un total de veinto y nueve funciona
Trios, oficiales y tripulantes de la flota mercante cubana han abandonado sus car=

rio sexalar que deopués que-yo abandond ol SIERRA MIESTR1 no quedé a berdo un sdlo
maquinista con titulo, a pesar de quo varios michachos jdvenes se oncontratan alli
recibiendo entronamiento, poro por supuesto, atin sin ‘el debido titulo. Esta es una
realidad que debe scr considerada seriamente por las firmas aseguradoras de buques
cubanos,,

la rayerfa do los buques confrontan dificultades en lo referente al funcicnanicnto

“Azdcares _de_1a_FAO_(Food Agriculture Organization .ce-las-Naciones—Unidas)-que- se
celebrS en Londres del Iro, 81 3 de Marzo de 19€€, al mismo tiempo que ocupaba el
cargo de Director de Investigaciones Tecnolégicas Arucareras del MINAZ y formaba
parte de la “Comtsién de Ettudios dol Plan Perspectivo Azucarero™,

A mi lado se encuentra mi sefiora Josefa Reus y mucstros hijos Roberto, de 21

afios y Raul, de 22 afios, arbos estudiantes de incenterfa de la Universidad de La

Habana.

Antes de hacer un breve relato de le odisea de mi familia para absndonar el
pafs, deseo agradecer 8 Jos compaiieros de UNIDAD REVOLUCICNARIA las atenciones
que han tenido Para con nosotros y 81 mismo tiempo por darme esta oportunidad de
hacer estas declaraciones a los periodistas del mundo libre.

Dosde hace dos afios tedos nos encontratamos tratando de abandonar 61 pafs po~
Fo nos habfa' sido imposible. a mi no se no permitfa salir debido al corgo que oy
paba y ni siquiera se le daba ost cportuntded al resto de mi familia. Cuando lo
de Camatioca nos fud a receger un barco’y las autoridades cubanas ni nos avisaron
de que dicha embarcacién se encontraha a11f, La Unica salida era abandonar el pafs
en bote nor la vfa clandestina, La oportunidad se presentd durante mi estancia en
Londres. Yo habfa salido de Cuba e1 23 de febrero de 1966 dejando atrés a mi sefig
re y a mis dos hijos, uno de los cuales, Radi, se encontraba enfermo de hepatitis -
en La Habana.

Mi sefiora tuvo que tomar 1a decisién sin encontrarne yo a su lado, pero habfa
que aprovechar la oportunidad que se nresentaba y salir por la via clandestina del
pats, De la odisea pueden dar detalles ellos mucho mejor a,,e yo y posiblenente los
miembros de 1a prensa desearén hacertes algunas preguntas al final de mis palabras,

Muy breverente les diré ove ellos se sometieron al mismo proceso que tantos — -
‘otros cubanos se han sometido, es decir, lanzarse en bote a cruzar e] “corredor de
la muerte” con 1a confianza que Dfos los ayudarfa a arribar a tierras de Libertad.
Dos intentos fallaron pero por fin, e} tercer intento fué un éxito y al manos el
grupo cempleto, unas veinte personas, se montaron en el bote y pusieron proa a los

Ante esta situacién, optd por informar, faltamente, a los restantes deiega=

lo que tendrfa que demorarme algunos dfas mas de los previstos en Madrid.

Londres y Madrid que me encontraran y que ne Meveran de regreso para La Habana
aunque tuviera que ser a bordo de un buque cubano y por supuesto, en contra de mi
voluntad, . .

Debido-a-la-escasez-de_niezas. de_repuestc, la falts de materiales y la baja cald
dad del trabajo, los ingenios confrontan una situacién que es necesario califi --
car do “caética", La falta de persona) técnico capacitado y de obreros especia-
lizados hacen ave le operacién de produccién do los Ingenios sea altamente defile
cliente. Por otra parte, 1a falta de abastecimiento de cafia no permite que los’ ip
génios funcionen a su capacidad normal, trayendo como consecuencia poce eficiene
cia en el trabajo y un alto consumo ée combustible adicsonal, que ocasiona un ay
mento considerable en los costos de produccién del sziicar. En relacién con los
medios de transporte, wrinci palmente los ferrocarriles a@zucareros, deseamos acla
rar que se encuentran también on pésimas condiciones, @ pesar dé Le adquistetén

de locomotoras sovidticas, inglesas y francesas, pues las vfas férreas no permi-
ten el aprovechamiento de este material rodante. Por ejemplo, durante 1965 se

debfan de haber cambiado seis millones de traviesas en 13s vfas férreas, mas sin

embargo sélo habfa diponibles ochenta mil. E1 resultado es ¢] incremento de los

descarrilamientos que durante 1a zafra de 1965 alcanzaron un promedio de tres deg
cdrrilamientos diarios, produciéndose diez accidentes mortales.

Muchos me preguntan cual seré la preduccién final de la zafra de 1966 y so -
bre este punto debo hacer los comentarios siguientes; Fidel Castro anuncié que
la meta azucarera de este aflo sérfan 6.5 millones de toneladas y ese anuncio no
6610 fue hecho Yurante su discurso del lro, de mayo de 1965, sino que lo repitié
durante su discurso del 7 de Junio de}, mismo afio, Sin enbargo, se adnite que dj,

cha meta:no serf alcanzéda, Ahora bien el estimado actual no excede de 5.1 mie

llones de toneladas, ePor qué?
Primeramente se debe mencionar 1a falta de abono. Este aiio la aplicacién

-. de abono fue insignificante, pues el gobierno no tenfa las divisas necesarias pao

va adquirirlo, principalnente en Italia, El afio pasado, sin embargo, se aplica-

ron aproximadamente 450,000 toneladas.
En segundo lugar, resulta necesario-hacer referencia 4 las Sionbras de cafla.

situada en los alrededores de Manzanillo y Bayamo, las cuales eran zonas arroce =
tas y ahora han {ntentado convertirlas en zonas cafieras resultando todo esto en
un fracaso pues la cafia es de baja calidad al no ser adecuado el suelo.. Otro fag

tor menos importante pero digno de darse a conocer es la falta de culdado en las

tareas de cultivo y atencién de los cafiaverales debido 3 1a escasez de mano de Q

bra.
Con estos antecedentes es que hay que analizar e1 monto de la presente zafra.

Durante 1965 el dfa 7 de abril se alcanzé el cuarto millén, pero este afio ol ter- -
cor millén se aleanz6 el dfa 3 de abril lo cual ya significa un atraso de corea

de 900,000 toneladas, Creo que hay cafia para llegar a 5,1 millones de toneladas
ahora bien, lo que hay que preguntarse es si dicha meta, que ya’ estd bastante- por
debajo de los 6.5 millones anunciados por Fidel Castro seré alcanzada ono. El
Partido estS realizando una movi lizacién masiva record hacia los cafiaverales con
@1 propésite de intentar cortar toda.la cafia pero eso hay que ver si en dofini-

tiva lo bgran hacer.
Cabe hacer referencia en este momento a lo que se conoce en Cuba por el nog

bre de “Pian Perspectivo Azucarero", que es el Unico plan econémico que tiene en

estos momentos e1 goblerno de Cuba.

éQué es cl “Plan Perspectivo Azucarero”? comprende tres puntos bésicos que
son los siguientes 1 primero, la "rehabilitacién" de la capacidad industrial a nj
veles pre-Castros segundo, la “ampliacién” de la capacidad industrial: y tercero,
la “concentracién” de 1a industria azucarera en 70 modernos centrales.

Vamos a revisar brevemente los tres puntos a la luz de la presente situacién.

En relacién con el primero, © sea, la “rehabili tacién” de la capacidad industrial _ :

“{nstalada, es necesario destacar que en 1952 la capacidad de produccién de la in
dustria azucarera era de siete millones de toneladas, pero debido a la escasez

de piezas de repuesto, falta de materiales para las reparaciones, baja calidad de
las reparaciones y la eliminacién de seis ingenios + que fueron precisamente deg

mantelados para utilizar las piezas como”repuestos lo cual ce ha comprobado ha sf
do un error mz - la capacidad industrial se ha reducido a 8610 seis millones de

i

Yo gustarfa hacer una breve referencia en relacién con otro problema bssico
+ 1a baja cal idad del azucar cubano, tanto crude como refino, actualmente en proce
80 de empeorarse. Esto no ha sucedido de casualidad sino como consecuencia de la
falta y mala calidad de las plezas de repuesto, la inefictencia en la operacién de
los ingenios, Ja falta de eficiencia de los trabajadores,. y..a baja calidad de les

- productos quinicos auxiliares procedentes' de pafses socialistas. Estos problemas
eatén resultando en una decrectente polarizacién del azdcar, el envase deficiente
del aztcar de exportacién, e1 aumento de impurezas en el azdcar embarcada a granel,
y las dificultades en cumplir los compromisos de entregas de azucares,

Otro tema de interés lo constituye la presencia de los “técnicos azucareros"
soviéticos en Cuba. E1 régimen cuenta en la actualidad con unos 3CO téenicos azu-
careros soviéticos quienes se supone que sean los sustitutos de los téenicos cuba-
nos que han abendonade el. pafs. Los téenicos soviéticos tlenen muy poca experten
cia en azécar de cafia y 1a forma en que dicha industria opera en Cuba. Ademss muy
pocos hablan esrafol y esto les hace atin mds diffcil su labor. Por lo tanto ni los
técnicos sovigticos ni losequipos soviéticos constituyen una solucién para el que
bradero de cabeza azucarero de Fidel Castro.

Con esto deseo dar por terminada estas declaraciones, Dejo ahora la palabra a
los miembros de la prensa para contestarles cualquier pregunta en relacién, no sé~
lo'a mis palabras, sino a la situad én polftica interna que es un interesante feng
meno de desintegracién, la odisea ‘de mi familia, el problema de 1a Universidad en
donde desempefiaba una cdtedra, asf como cualquier otro tema que resulte de interés.

Sweden, :

Dear Prof, Gardlundt

leased to encloce tho informtion that you roquested
in your kind letter oe 7,3 5/66, which I hopo will be useful to you in your studies
of price and cost trends in the cane sugar industry,

As you probably know, tho Cuban curar industry ranked first
placo as a producer of cane cugar, not only with rogarda to large production vole
umes, but also as concerns high technical officioncy and low production costs.

Bofore 1959, the maxima production’ cost was of 3,5 cents a
pound, excepting, of course, the smaller and moro inofficiont sugar mills that
had not dovolopod any tochnological advances since World War II, However, in
1965 the cost. of production was as hifh as 5,25 cents a pound, even though, of
course, this latter figure is carefully concealod by: the Communist régime that

~ yules my country.

I would like to acquaint you with the Econonic Research Bux
reau of the UNIDAD REVOLUCIONARIA Movonont. This organisation is mado up of true
Cuban oconomists in exile. I am suro that you will find this a very valuable
jeource of information concerning Cuba's economy,

. I thank you very mch for tho kind and huzane phrases that
you have had for my family and for myself. Thank Heaven, after throe long years
we were able to escapo, even if at the risk of our ow lives, from the Commnist
hall, We have como to this free land in tho hope that we can start our lives all
over again under the kind hospitality of this roat Nation, the free and denocrag
ic United States of America,

: Please by assured, ny dear Professor,.that I am pleased to
place myself at your service, Should you desire any informtion concerning the
Cuban sugar industry, I will be more than glad to furnish it to you, I also
hope that, very soon, a régime of lihorty, justice and democratic economic de=
velopuent will pravail in my suffering Fathorland.

Sincerely yours,

Tog. Rav Eoparsa Sr.

Call, Colombia,

Dear Mr, Lozanos (igaeeadae
We address you now on account of the foilure of the current Cubsn
sugar harvest, of which fatluro you must have heard not oly through our’ "Eco=

homie Intollicence Report”, but aleo from your own sources.

cee © For axamele, the June 10, 106 MerrileLynch bulletin, sets the g
mount of the current Cuban sucar harvest at 4,450,000 MT, that 1s, over 2 million
metric tons bolow the coal announced by Fidel Castre (4,500,000 47), This will
rosult 4n 6 scarcity of Cuban suger, wich scarcity will make it very  é4fFicult
ing to fulfill {ts suger commitments to free-world countries, such as
Spain.and Morecco, and at tho sane time to cope with o significant percentege of
the Japanese sugar market. The enclosed Memo contains data that may te of intg

rest. to you.

The racent transactions whereby Prazil sold 330,000 MT is tangible
‘evidence of the opportunity that’ exists for free countries in the Americas at
this timé, thanks to tho failure of the Cuban sugar harvests

Tt would be extremely rewarding for Colombia to exnlere the inmg.
diate possibilities that eixst in those threa markets, as surely some transag
tone could be made that would benefit your country, and which, et the sane tine,
would’ block some of the Cartro-Communists’ own transactions, The latter ore in
themselves difficult becouse of the scarcity brought bout by the failure of the
1966 sugar harvest.

It 1s quito possible that we could cooperate with this Colombian
endeavor, by informing you of facts we mn concerning the situation in such mop
kets (Spain, Morocco and Japan), markets os well as by any personal undertaking,

‘which we could be capable ofs



Likewise, 1f you have any rublication issued by your Assoctation
that you ceuld ail quiarly, ve would 3 ate your deine a if
you were able to use the statements by Eng. Esparza and Dr. Tarrab in some arty

cle, we would like ot ohtain a copy of it.

: Hoping to hear from you soon, and with the certainty that. any ag
tion on your pert -ill mean 8 victory for Colombia as well as for the free Cubans,

appreciate a copy of the RFE report on this subject which is mentioned
in this article, Material of this nature is most useful in the
AMSCROLL effort (via radio and written analysis) to support its thesis
that if after forty-two years the Soviets have not solved their
industrial and.agricultural problems how can the Cubans hope to do so
in less?

ACTION REQUIRED: FYI

1. Boyginning with the broadcast for 19 Octobor 1965 the Station
at its request began recoiving a summary of each AMSCROLL AMTHIGH
program, We forward by separate cover theso summaries through the
evening of 20 January 1966 (with tho exception of the periods of
28-30 November and 2=4 January for which no summary: was prepared).
Henceforth those summaries will be forwarded on an at least bi-weekly.

basis.

2. The Station is attempting to improve both tho punch and the
quality of these programs, We beliove, for example, that more
emphasis should be placed upon. regime failures.and up2n tho needless
economic moss. Furthor, we are trying to refine tho "irritability"
factor so far as Castro and the regime are concerned duoc to the
sensitivity of Castro to this type of attack. Calling Castro (on

19 January) the "Soviets' barking hound dog" isa sally in this

direction.

3. As usual with programs of this nature the size and reaction of
the audience is most difficult to ascertain, It is somo comfort to be
able to record that during this period 10 letters have been received
by ANSCROLL that have beon inspired by this program. The President's
uncle, Carlos Dorticos, told AMSCROLL-3 that he had been a frequent
listener to this program and that he had listened to this program at

his home the night before he left Cuba,

be read and re-read in Cuban schools. The letter, which seems to have
been dictated by Fidel while his victim stood with a foot in the grave, :
is a carbon copy of Stalin's procedures, “Stalin also demanded that the :

Enbasay in Tokyo. Cuban Reds withhold ship's itinerary to dg

A Cuban okippor who loft his ehip in Jazan Doc, 26 confirmed today in Miami that =
Cnotro's logistical support of Viet tam Reds was tho main reacon for his defection,
In a prors conference held at the Biscayne Room of tho Hotel Hctllicter, Francisco.
Cobas, the defecting captain of the Cuban freighter “Aracolio Iglooias", told news-
mon why ho and three of his fellow best laehadel decided to seek asylum in the United --

States.

The press conference was arranged by UNIDAD REVOLUCIONARTA, a Miami-based Cuban ==
group whom Cobas approached upon his arrival from Japan, Cobas caid that he had —
apked tho U.R. to help him get in touch with the prove 6o that he and his ehipmates
could denounce Cuban maneuvers to help the Viet Cong.

During the conference, Cobas was flanked by Antonio Arias, Yario Pérez and Hunberto
Ferndndoz, the three other defecting officers of the “Aracelio Iglesias". Cobas, -
Antroduced by U.R. Secrotary General Mario Seiglic, spoke for the group, Said Com
bas that ho and his ohipmates had refused torun tho risks of transporting war mate=
rialc to North Viet Nam, particularly since they wero convinced that such transpar=
tation was wrong. Cobas added that all Cuban voucola have been ordered to take mi]
itary euppliea to North Viet Nam‘ fron other Asian Conmunict ports, and that the Cub
an Embassy in Tokyo serves as coordinator for all much shipments.

Reforring to his former ship, Capt, Cobas explained that the Embaesy had ordered ==
tho "hracelio Iglesias" to sali to a Horth Koreen port and to await further instrug
tions there, The Cuban diplomats withheld the ahip's itinerary and declared that =
the "Aracelio" yould return: to the Japanese port of Yahata before proceeding to ==
North Viet Nam, By pretending that the chip would come back to Japan, they hoped -
to decoive the crew and reassure the Japanese ac to tho cargo and tha use to which -
the ship vas boing put, ‘Tho truth was, however, that, while in orth Korea, the —-
"Aracelio" was to receive orders to load a cargo of var supplies and sail directly

from thore to North VietNam.

According to Cobas, this could not be done in the end because the Tokyo Embassy was
warned at the last moment that the North Korean port of Chinnampo was.blocked by —
ce, The “Aracelio" vas how ordered to pick up another military chipment at Shan
ghai and take it to North Viet Uam, It was then that Cobaa and his shipmtes dec—

Cobas went on to explain that logistical support to the North Vietnamese was one of
the two tacks assigned to the new Cuban envoy in Tokyo, a fanatically loyal Comu—

Tho Cuban skipper referred to ill-treatment of Cuban ccamen by the Castro regime,
mentioning arong other. instances the constant spying on board by G-2 men§ prefer-=
ential Customs ‘treatment given Conriunist-Bloc sailorsjand the ridiculously low lo=
cal-currency allowance of % per week given to the Cubans while in foreign ports.
Elaborating on the iséue of ecpionage, Capt. Cobas revealed that the radio and tel-
egraph operator 1s usually the C-2 man on board. As captain of the “Aracelio", Com
bas himself was forced to. eurrender the nail of supposedly "disloyal" crewmen to --
one of the spies assigned to his ship.

As rogarda operation conditions of tho Cutan merchant fleet, Cobas told newsmen =~
that the two-basic problems confronted by Cuban shipping aro the obsolete Soviet <=
equipront inctatled in most boats and the excessive bureaucrati¢ red tape and dis--
organization, fs example of the latter, he montioned tho fact, that the Cuban buy=
ing agency seldom informs the shipping coordinating office of the dates oh which ==
the merchandice 1s to be picked up at a foreign port. Last-minute notites and
sequent offorts to find éhips usually moo’ failure, with the result that the seller
must pay higher varchouse costs. This he’ caused rany foreign firms to oither re-
fuse to trade with.Castro-or to impose extromely harsh terms to protect themselves
from the coztly effects of tis Communists’ unreliability.

Capt. Fraiicisco Cobas then revealed that he understood that a vast "reorganization"
of the Cuban Havy was undertaken early this fall, Moct officers, he said, were dig
charged on the grounds of suspected 'disloyalty" to the government, Incidentally,

added Cobas, sone rotired Army ‘officors who have had no naval oxperience, have also

been agcigned to the merchant rarine, Cobas assured his audience that their deci-
sion to quit was made of their own free will and that no one had pressured them --
into dt, He denounced Communist oppression of his homeland and said that ho and his
three shipnates refused to keep serving under it,

Following Capt. Cobas’ statement, the newsmon acked Him numerous questions. Most -
of these referryd to the iscue of Cuban boats being used to carry war supplies to -
Viet Nam, which was quoted by the Cuban seamen aa the chief reason for their defec-
tion, All journalists present chowed great interest in this matter, as such Cuban

Refirténdose al "Aracelio Iglesias", que capitaneaba, Cobas reveld que la Erbaja-

La realidad, empero, era que, durante la estancia del "Aracelio" on Corea del Korte,

ty chdpmitor and I have requested political seylum from the United States
becauce we oro convinced that Cutan support of tie Com~unist war in Vietnam is
wrong and ‘ve refuse iv run tne ricks of transporting war material to North Viet
Nam, : .

All Cuban ships have orders to carry cargo to North Victnan to help tho
North Vietnamese war effort. The Cuban Embassy in Japan is acting as the coor=
dinator for all shipments of war ratorial to North Viotnam via Cutan ships from
Communist ports in Asia, The Cutan Embassy in Tokyo had secretly arranged for
tho Aracolio Iglosias to take a chipmont of war materials from North Korea to
North Viotnam, In order to hide their intentions, the Embassy arranged that the
fracelio itinorary be kept up in the air until the last possible moment; then to ate
fool the orew and the Japaneso they gave tho story the ship would return to Japan
to lend tin cargo at Yahata an4 thon procood on route to North Vietnam, In real=
ity, wo were to receive instructions on itinerary while in North Korea telling
us to proceed directly to North Vietnam after loading tho war supplies.

At the last moment, however, tho Embassy was informed that the port of
Chinnampo wae blocked by fee. Tho Cuban Enbassy thon hastily arranged for us to :
pick up a shipment of arms in Shangai previously scheduled for another Cuban
boat about the end of January, i

Logistical support to tho North Viotnamese is one of the two tasks assigned
to Mr, Nanuol Jorge Cuerys,. the now Cuban Anbassador to Japan, His other func
tion is to erase the bad effects on Japanese-Cuban trade caused by the defection
of the former trade Counselor to Japan, Gilberto Uerany. Tho Cuban government
is very concerned about the prospact of declining trade since already some comp-
anies that formerly traded with Cuba, will no longer do so openly.

In gencral, I may say that members of the Cuban merchant marine live under
unbearable conditions. The treatment we receive is so bad that no one feala
like cooperating with the marine purposes of the regine, even in the few cases
where there might be no ideological incompatibility involved.

As examples of this treatment I may mention the constant spying on board
by members of the "G-2". For some reason, the "G-2".ran on board is usually the
radio and ‘telegraph operator. In the “Aracelio" ve had one by the name of Eduay ”

rency that wo are allowed when we eaii atroaé, For spending money in foreign.
Ports, all we got in Jecal currency 1e the equivalent of % per week which, of
course, aro deducted from our basic salaries, In applying thie restriction, no
distinction is made between the erewren or the various officer ranks, It 19. $5

for everyone.
Because of all this, and becauce of the terrible conditions under which

_ Communism kéops our homeland, nost Cutan sailore and officers aro staunch anti-

Communists. The Government knows thie, but nevertheless they must employ what
they call "the reactionarics" because of the scarcity of other trained personnel
to man Cuban boats, Their only choice is to epy on us constantly, as I Have
just explained,

Aa to the operating eonditione of the Cutan merchant fleet, it 1e worth
mentioning that.Polish ships, which raze yp a sizable proportion of Cuban ship»
ping, are supplied with Soviot-made equiprent which the Russians have long dis-
carded as obsolete, Again, my om ship fs an example, The "Aracelio” wes cone
pleted aa recently as 1963 in a Polish shipyard, Yet, ite radar equiprent is 60
obsolete that it is cimply not used, since we could never find the parts to re=-
pair it when it broke. A German technictan told my Chief Mate here that it mst
have been a World-War II unit. :

Excessive bureaucratic red tape ené disorganization ia another serious
problem confronted by Cuban shiping ané which often results in considerable
damage to those firms that trade with the Castro tyranny. I will illustrate
this. The Cuban government agency reepcnsible for arranging maritime treinspor-
tation for merchandise bought abroad is the "Empresa Cubana de Fletes" (CUFLET).


-j-

The governrent purchasing organization buye morchardise from foreign companios,
but fails to inform CUFLET of ‘tho dato on which the cargo 4s to be loadod. ALL
- attorpts to establish this aro to no avail, Then one day the buying agency
cerves last-ninute notice that the merchandice will be ready for loading.
CUFLET takes pains to find a veesel in time but, more often than not, ite hasty
efforts aro in vain, In the meantime, the seller abroad grovs inpatient, as he
hae long fulfilled his part of the doal and must continue to pay warehouse coate
because of a delay that 1s no fault of his.
g This happens all the time, to the extent that many foreign firme refuse to
deal with such an undependable customer as the Cuban government, or, foresceing
the damages they may come to them bocause of such inefficiency they impose tho

harshest solling terms, :
The unrest and chaos that I have decerdbed 1 not peculiar to the merchant

~~" fleet. Ido not know many details about thie because I have been out at sea most
of the timo since I first heard of it, but T understand that tho Cuban Havy was
also in such turmoil that practically all its officers were discharged early shies
fall, It is said that sone of tho dlomiceed naval officers were arsigned to the
merchant marine, and my nen and I knov a fow instances. It 1s even trie that
» Arny officers with no naval experience are being appointed to high naval posi=
tions, However, it is most Likely that many of the purged officers vill have
been shot or imprisoned. Such is. the Cubs of today.
Lastly, we wish to emphasize that our decision to seek asylum in the United
« States, has been made of our ovn free will, ‘oc have been pressured into this deof
‘sion by no one. Our consciences no longer permit us to serve the cause of a Cop
munist Cuba. Like hundreds of Cubans before us, we who love Cuba deeply cannot

longer endure the tyranny with which she is afflicted.
We appreciate with all our heart the help received from UNIDAD R°VLUCINARIA

and we also wish to thank the gentlemen of the Press assembled here, for the at-

tention given us.

Francisco Cobas.

Luiz GOMEZ Wanguemert Commentary

REF: DIR-53981, 28 October 65

As Headquarters is aware, JMWAVE is refuting on a con-
tinuing basis and via all appropriate assets commentaries
similar to that discussed in the reference. As for this
particular GOMEZ broadcast the Station prepared a guidance
for AMSCROLL use, primarily its radio, the point of which
was that GOMEZ had become eligible for the "Foot 'n Mouth
Club" due his admission on 21 October that Camarioca was a
plebiscite and his statement on 22 October, no doubt as a
result of a prod from his Communist superiors that "I think
I made excessive concessions ..." explaining that the people
are really leaving due to economic reasons. We agree and
say that the economic reasons are to obtain three meals a
day, to be able to walk into a market and buy eggs and milk.
The guidance ends with this: "You may take your foot out of
your mouth now, GOMEZ".

ACTION REQUIRED: FYI

c 1, We forward under separate cover subject publication which was
recently sent to AMSCROLL mail recipients interested in economic
materinl, In producing this study a particular effort was made to
keep it objective and factual on the theory that tn the case of sugar
the facts speak for themselves and need only tu he pulled together.

We also believe that objective material similar to the attached should
over a periad of time enhance the reputation of the ANSCROLL cconomic
section as a serious and objective outfit that secks to discredit biad
Castro regime by publicizing the truth.

2. The Station would appreciate Headquarters’ reaction to this
publication. Additional copies are available should distribution via

KMFORGET or othor means be desired,

3, It may be of interest to report that a copy of the. attached
report has been mailed to Identity, currently in Geneva where he is
represonting his company at the sugar conference. This was done
directly under the AMSCROLL economic section letterhead and via
AMWORD-1's brother, an employee in thé research department of

Identity's company,

1.- Cuba continues desperate attempts sell _sugar.- The Cuban sugar monopoly, CUBA~
ZUCAR, on September 6 concluded a sale of 5,000 tons of raw sugar for October 1965

delivery to the Iranian sugar organization. Tho origin of this sugar was hidden in
that it was declared to have originated in the Caribbcan, including Peru, excluding
Brazil, Market reports were-correct in stating that the country of ori, was in ~
fact Cuba. The price agreed to was 18 pounds sterling per ton (C-and F) less § -——
shillings per ton to cover the expenses of the tender. This doal was engineered by
Westzucker of Dortmund, an organization also selling Cuban sugar to Jordan and which
wishes to keep its name out of these sales,

Another interesting development in Cuba's sugar selling activities during the month
of September was quoting sugar for future delivery at or under the London spot = -
price on the day the offer was made, In other words, Cuba is offering sugar under

the world market value.
Example of this were:

Seliing

Switzerland Sept 9 10,000 18-10-0 24 Jan '66
United Kingdom - 10,000 18-15-0 21.55 Sopt

It is difficult to explain this curious behavior in terms other than Cuba's desper-
ate need for foreign exchange. These sales at these prices can only result ina -
net loss to Cuba due to Cuba's inefficient sugar production. This loss will be com
pounded should the present upward trend of world sugar futures continue (the New =
York price for world sugar on Caribbean port basis has gone from 11.60 on September

1 to 2.10 on September 27).

2,- Free vorld Shinning drops 51%.- Twenty Western vessels called on Red Cuban ports
The trend continues downward; the August 1963 te

during the past month of August.
tal was 24, and the one for August 1964 was 41, which means a decrease of 52% when

August 1965 (20 vessels) is compared to August 1964.
Great Britain led the "maritine fifth columnists" with 11 vessels, followed by Leb-

anon, Greece, France, and Italy with 2 vessels each, and Cyprus with one.

Already 852 vessels are being kept out of the Red Cuba trade by its owners or opera
tors. The most recent example is “Roderdagejguqiatact Saly" of Mariehamm, Finland,

don and Pircous, under the nanes of"Tsavliris Shipzing", "Teavliris Hellas Mari--=
time", "Pancristo Shipping", "Waterloo Shipping", and "Trafalgar Shipping" is very

" active in business with the Castro-Comunist regimes

From 8 total of 17-vessols, TSAVLIRIS has. been using 12 in the Red Cuba trade, Tho

TRADER, and FREE NaVIGATOR. TS:VLIRIS operates its vessels under British, Lebanese
or Haitian flags, this last action being illegel according to a July 6, 1965 Haitian
aw. The FREE HaVIGATOR has changed its name ceven times. The NEJ HEATH has deliy
ered tuo shipments of Cuban sugar to Japan, which have not been accepted by Japanese
refineries, because stain and rust from.vessel's hold hac spoiled cargo. In mid=

hugust the Lebariso 7,260 ton SAH SPYRIDO! had arrived in the United Kingdon with

1,600 tons of Cuban sugar spoiled by sea water.
TSAVILIRIS' vessels have made 50 trips to Red Cuba during the last two years.

.° Reports reaching this -
bureau indicate that the Cuban Management Boycott Committee has already received
several lotters support from Free “orld Chanbers of Commerce, Details ara expected

to be known shortly.

5.- Free io) Bo. 4 elve boost.- The announcement of a Contd

“ nental Dockworkers Congress to be held in Venezuela during the first two weeks of -

October confirm last month's report that an increase in boycott activities against
vessels flying tho flogs of countries still trading with Conmuniat Cuba.

6. Japanese Trade Mission gets "chilly" reception in Latin America due to Red Cuba
deal 4 Japanese Trade Hission, headed by tir, Kazue Kitagawa, President of “Sumi,
tono Hlectrical Industries" came under fire while touring Mexico, Venecuela, Brazil,
“Argentina, Uruguay, Chile, and. Peru, Latin Americans brought up matter that Japan
was indirectly financing subversion by providing Castro with an average of 81 mil—
lion dollars a month for the last 4 years. Japanese were told to choose between the

Red Cuban market and the Latin american market.

Some examples follow: article by L, Rojas Ospina in "Excelsior", Mexico, Sep. hy =
1965; in Brazil, a speech by Congressman Flaviano Riberiro dated Sep.’ 4, 1965, and
an article by Gustavo Corcao published in "Diario da Noticias", Rio de Janeiro, Sep.
2, 1965 issue, made the headlines. In Lina, Peru, a speech by Congressman Ricardo

Temoche made the local Japanese embassy respond with a vague statement of justifica
tion. In Chile, an editorial of "El Hercurio" stressed this point to Japanese vie,

tors.
7.- Cuban exiles block Castro's attemnt to soll "treasure".- Cuban exile Committee
for the Recovery of the artistic and Cultural Heritage of their country was able to

block Castro's attempt to seli art works and raise $2 million dollars, Cuban exiles



inspected 104 cases contsining art treasures during August 23, 24, and 25, in Milan,
Italy, identifying 45 pieces as their om,

\
Although 103 eases were only werth US%16,000, the contents of case #107 were said ,
to be worth US:600,000. The first 103 cases deliverod to Castro's "partner" Mahe
mood Mowlazadeh, contained religious and funeral pieces, but case #107, forwarded _

from Switzerland, contained solid gold and silver objects.

following members of the Cuban Embassy in London: Maria Fernandez, Osnani Martinos
Vazquez, Moises Dias, Mario: Garcia, and Armando Lobeto,

Meanwhile, different rumors plegued Guba (many of them stemming from official state
ments): attempts on Castro's life, internal digsontion resulting from the "ultima--
tum" given to militiamen to return weapons; new boatloads of Cubsn refugees arriving

to Floridian shores; and Security Police Chief Valdes’ statements zeroing-in against

We attach herewith a reproduction of an article from the Caracas
newspapor El Universal of 10 September describing the organization
of 2 committee of European shippers to fight the discrimination
these shippers fancy they suffer in Latin America, We are curious :
why such a group should be organized and to what purpose. Could this,
for example, be a reaction to the efforts to boycott ships that trade
. with Cuba? The Station will appreciate Headquarters' comment if it
appears that this group may become important and if it is or will be
concerned with attempts to influonce shipping to Cuba,

G.= Peru: Congressman Ricardo Tezoche Benitez pointed out Japan's it~
titude, due to its trade rolations with Comzunist Cuba during a spoech mado i
grese on September lst., 1965. Congrossmen Tenocho's statezonte recoived art
coverage in tho local press and were object of an “igence France Proasa” viro.

nQ Cited AS Contrast to preresterous be=

Here is text of lettér sent to the Foreign Affairs and Interior Mf,
nisters of Greece: =

Excellency:
"You xay recall that, in mid-May this year, the Communist Cuban -~
Charge dtaffaires in Athens, Jcse Luis Galbe, was the object of world ~
attention +fter he shot a Greek bus driver over a trivial traffic argu-
~ ment near the town of Thermopylae. Newspapers throughout the world cay
ried the story snd it would not be exaggerated to label the incident aa
an international scandal -one which may be said to have damaged Hellen~
ic dignity to the same extent to which the Castro regime ignores it by
accrediting gongsters such as Galbe as its diplomatic representatives ~

before the Greek people." :

"On that occasion, we wrote the Greek government calling their at-
tention to the need to save the honor of Greece by severing all ties --
diplomatic and commercial--= with the Red government of Cuba. At that =
time, we warned that the gangster Galbe was typical of the new promotion
of Red Cuban "diplomats" --mostly undesirable Communists trained tO, Per
form tasks of espionage and agitation-~ and substantiated our assertion
with a quote from Odon Alvarez de la Campa, a defecting Cuban iplonat~
who had charged Galbe by name during a press conference in Madrid."

"Today, two new defections from the Cuban Foreign Service prompt us

to re-open the Galbe case, Wwe refer to those of Mssrs. Gilberto R..Alg

many Vilar, until recently, Trade Counseler to the Cuban Embassy in-To-

kyon and Luis Ricardo Alonso Fernandez, until recently, Cuban Ambassadar
rn

to Great Britain.

“Both former diplomats had always been regarded as competent, ser{
ous men even by us, the relentless opposers of the Castro-Communist ty~
ranny. Before he took office as Cuban Ambassador to the United hingdon
in 1963, Luis R. Alonso Fernandes had also performed amibassadorial du ~
ties in Peru and Norway. A Scholarly, well-mannered man, he is well re
membered by all who knew him in his diplomatic office, even if they may
heve disapproved of the totalitarian regime that he represented, ven~
tually, he became disenchanted with Communism and publicly resigned his
post in London only a. few days aco. (In connection with Mr. Alonso's re.
peeeeeny the Greek newspaper "Vradyni", in its September 6 issue, won
ders precisely why Red Cuban Ambassador éalbe has not been ousted yet)."

"Gilberto R. Alemany, an equally able and well-bred trade specia'-
list, held his Counselor's position for three years in Tokyo, iis re=
cognition of the true nature of the Red Cuban government led him to de~

ie fect secretly and become our own secret agent in Japan, Late last mon-
th, after fulfilling his dangerous mission, he made his feelings public

"AS you can see, those decent peorle, who are still active in Cas-~

fections show that the few that remain are abandoning the sinking ship
to the "new wave" of Castroite diplorats --gangsters, spies and agita-
tors in Galbe's fashion." a

A PRESS SERVICE FROM Pasue
MOVIMIENTO UNIDAD REVOLUCIONARIA (U.R.) 73 8033

U.R. REPORT! :
SOVIET "FISHING" BASE IN HAVANA

UNIDAD REVOLUCIONARIA (UR) has learned from its underground sour =
ces in Cuba the following infermation:

The Russians are constructing doeks, warehouses, freezers, dry <=
docks, buildings with communication equipment and other necessary ins=
tallations for the operation of a fishing fleet in the east coast of <
the port of. Havana, according to the Cuban-Soviet agreement of Septem-
ber, 1962. | :

These constructions are directed and supervised by Soviet techni-
cians with the collaboration of Cuban "slave work". The Soviet Union
furnishes all the necessary equipment and mAchinery, in addition to ==
the above mentioned supervision and technical assistance; Cuba offers

the labor as well as the basic construction materials,

It was stipulated that the Soviet Union and Cuba would share in ~
equal parts this fishing terminal which original cost was $12 million
"pesos" but now it has come ay £9 $30 millions and is expected to be -
finished by the beginning of 1966.

However, it has.been learned that due to the darge sum owed by = |
the Castro-Communist regime to the Soviet Ynion, the Russians have de~
cided that these facilities will be for their exclusive use once they

are concluded.

All the fish caught will be taken to this terminal, processed and
exported to the Soviet Union and Lurope in Russian vessels, without -
any profit for Cuba, nor the Cuban fishing vessels will be allowed to

use Said installations,

This area of the east coast of th pote of Havana will be closed
as soon as installations are finished and bnly Soviet personnel will-
have access to that zone.

This absolute control of the Soviets in the same port of Havana~
nas led many tothink that said installations will not only serve for -
operating Soviet trawlers - which activities in espionage, infiltratim
cf subversive and terrorist agents are well known ~ but that it might
hide military constructions, Submarine pens, and other installations -
that could threaten the sectrity of the Kemisphere.

Los rusos estén construyendo muelles, diques secos, naves refrigeradas, plan
tas de comunicaciones y derés instalaciones neces: rias para las operaciones
de una flota pesquera en la costa este del puerto de La Habana, conforme a
lo ectipulado en el acuerdo Soviético-Cubano de Septiembro de 1962.

Estas construcciones se llevan a cabo bajo la djreccién y supervisién de téc
nicos soviéticoa, con la colaborecién de. "trabajo esclavo" cubano. La Unién
Soviética facilita todos los equipos y maquinarias, ademés de la mencionada

supervisién y asistencia técnicas, y Cuba pone la arena, piedras y materia-
les bisicos de construccién, aparte de la mano de obra.

“Se habla estipulado que la Unisn Soviética y Cuba usufructussen ‘a partes

iguales esta terminal pesouera de vastas properciones, cuyo costo original
era do $12 millones de "pesos", pero que ya asctende a $30 millones y que se
espera estaré terminada para principios de 1966.

Sin embargo, se ha podido conocer que debido @ le cuantiosa suma que el régi

“en Castro-Comuni ste adeuda a la Unién Soviética, los rusos han determinado

oue estas instalaciones serén para su uso exclusivo una vez terminadas.

Toda la pesca ser llevada a esta terminal, procesada y exportada para la
Unién Soviética y Europa en mercantes rusos, sin que se derive provecho algu
no para Cuta y sin que los pesqueros cutanos puedan hacer uso de dichas ins~
talaciones.

Esta érea en la costa este del puerto de La Habana ser& cerrada en cuanto se
terminen las instalaciones y sélo el personal soviético tendré acceso a esta
zona.

Este control absolute soviético en el rropio puerto de La Habana ha hecho
pensar a muchoe que dichas instalaciones no sélo servirdn para las cperacio~
nes de los "pescueros" rusos ~cuyas actividades de esrionaje, infiltracién
de arentes subvercivos y terroristas scn harto conocidas- sino que pueden eg,
cender construcciones militares, b=ses para submarinos y otras instalaciones

day as it offected Cuba, The 17 releases of this period wero sont to
newspapers, wire services, magazines, radio and TV stations throughout
the freo world in approximately 350 copivs cach, The local public
modia mado use of approximately 65% of AMSCROLL's pross reloases,
Although occasional indications aro recoived that AMSCROLL matorials
are used in other nowspapor and magazine articles, radio programs and
the like, there is no way of making a good ostimate of tho amount of
such replay, Among the moro important titlos were tho following

(copies in Attachment 4):

Froe-World Ships Cohtinue Aid to Cuban Economy?
Cuban Budget Includes Proof Economy Crumbling -~ an Analysis}
Possible Soviet Curtailment of Cuban Aid Seen

Greek Firm Bilked in Cuban Trado Nogotiations

, Japan Secks Expansion of LA Trade While Defying OAS in
Cuban Trafic

Z¢ Sovbloc Undermining Castro Sugar Markets

Castro Auctioning Heirlooms Takon from Fleeing Refugees

7, Other political action and propaganda moves noted in paragraph
‘1, above, wore reported separately in dotnil, and a full set of
“black list" correspondence was forwardod to Headquarters in UFGA 21616
with a request for any further MIVIPER lends which might contribute to

the further effectiveness of this campaign,

8, AMSCROLL radio programs, 15 minutos daily over both WMIE and
AMTHIGH, carricd much tho same themes as tho AMSCROLL press roleases,
but with adjustments as necossary for tho Cuban audionce, e.g., while
AMSCROLL pross releases might complain about continued frec-world
trade with and shipping to Cuba, the radio program would emphasize any

decreases in the number of ships,

9, Reactions to AMSCROLL propaganda continue to arrive from Cuba,
put at a slow pace, Tho 24 letters recoived during the past period
contained 7 newspaper clippings and three pages torn from telephone
books, as requosted in AMSCROLL radio programs, Nine of the letters
mentioned the AMTHIGH broadcasts, one noted receipt of the pony-sized
pulletin and two remitted the small acknowledgement forms which accompan|
11 AMSCROLL propaganda mailed into Cuba, Detailed statistics on these
are submitted in a separate report from JMWAVE,

ACTION REQUIRED: FYI
REFERENCE: UFGA 19181, dated 21 December 1964

i

A. OPERATIONAL — . {

1, During December there was considerable pressure on AMSCROLL
to join political groupings being formed by ex-Presidents Urrutia
cand Pric, Fortunately, AMSCROLL was ita to stay out of both without
incurring the wrath of either,

B, PRODUCTION

2, Although a number of new propaganda ideas were submitted by
AMSCROLL for approval, the only new item for Cuban consumption

actually printed during the month was the pony bulletin, This and
other items already on hand, including 5,000 Christmas cards, totalled
47,000 pieces which were sent in 20,000 covers to Cuba, Another
103000 items were distributed to Latin America and Spain, and 13,700
to addressees-in the U. 5, Most of the two latter categories were
based os requests from religious, social, and civic organizations.
Samples of the items and a breakdown of the actual numbers of each
distributed are in the attached AMSCROLL Propaganda Section report,

3. AMSCROLL broadcasts continued as scheduled, Chief among the
themes, which also pervaded the two issues of the AMSCROLL house organ
published during the month and the above-mentioned pony bulletin for

Cuba, were as follows:

a. The Congo in lurid detail with outrage at the Commnist
hand behind the atrocities, and with scorn for the so-called neutralistg
for their attitude for the rescue mission, ANSCROLL ecditoralized that
except. for the canibalism, Congo tactics including ravage and wanton
murder are what brought Stalin, Tito, Mao, and Fidel to power,

b, AMSCROLL optimistically sees the start of a counter offen=
sive ayninst the rampages of Communism in Latin America, Examples
cited were Castello Branco's action in Goaiz Province, Brazil;
Venezuclan Army overationg in the Andes; Panamanian preparations to
control agitation on the anniversary of the Canal riots; Argentine
Foreign Minister Zavnla's public denunciation of Sovict colonialism
in Cuba; Jagan's defent ot the polls in Guiana; and “operation
Ayacucho," a seven-nntion military mancuver against an “Imaginary®
target which has Latin American Communists screaming "foul!"

c. “Che” Guevara's statemonts before the UN and during his
telovision interview contrasted with quotations from previous speeches,
espocially his current whining for trade openings with the U, S, as
opposed to past claims that U. S, sugar purchases kept Cuba in a state
of colonialism, Much'was mado of tho romark of the Nicaraguan dele-
gato to the UN that Guevara's address on behalf of Cuba was a Russian
speech with an Argentine accent, It was also noted that "Che" admittéd|
Cuba's support of the terrorism in Venezuela, a

da, Cuba's worsoning cconomic situation way as heretofore, a
constant theme, Featured this month wore tho obvious failures of the

foraging trips of Carlos Rodriguez and "Cho" Guevara, and a host of -
specific examples of matcrial shortages admitted by Cuban public media,

e, The Martinez Sanchez suicide and the lack of precise detail
expocially in its aftormath, got considerablo attention in AMSCROLL
Propaganda, along with other notes on GOC strife,

Ee . _f£, The Sino-Sovict rift was expected to continue, accarding to)
AMSCROLL, and the situation docs not bode well for Castro's relations
with the now Kremlin leaders, Examples taken from press clippings,

&. The CTV boycott against free-world ships trading with Cuba
was favorably noted as another facet of tho tightening of the noose

around Fidel's neck,

h, End-of-year broadcasts centered on the decline of Communis
after a half century it still fails to improve the living standards of
the peoples enguifed, but instcad increases terror and oppression to
forge the populations into automatons for use in the realization of

its mad dream of world conquest,

4, Among letters received during the month was a request from
Palo Alto, California for a complete set of AMSCROLL publications for

the Hoover Institute's archives on world revolutions,

5. AMFRAME-1, who is now sccond man in the AMSCROLL Propaganda
Section by dint of his demonstrated imagination and initiative, came
up with a proposal during the month to test reaction to printed
materials being sent to Cuba. Implemented immediately, it consists
of a small coupon which accompanies cach item mailed to 15,000
addressees on a rotating basis each month, The total is divided into
four groups for sample purposes, each group being asked to respond to
requests for general, readily available information on the basis of
different stimuli, cither to have the respondent's code name announced
over the radio or just listed among the "many" others who are contri~
puting to the effort to overthrow the Castro regime, Theoretically,
the assistance would be more fully acknowledged after the liberation,
On the basis of results achieved during the first few months, the
system will be refined until the most successful method for testing

A report will be submitted when

Cuban audience reaction is found,
sufficient returns are in, The AMSCROLL Propaganda Section report,
attached, contains further details and a sample of the coupon,

6, We were pleased to receive EGFA 43043 which credited AMSCROLL
propaganda with a minor MHVIPER score on a West German firm which was
doing business with Cuba, Evidently a number of free-world firms are
disturbed in the same way by AMSCROLL's rabre-rattling letters on the

ab list, A report is being prepared analyzing
PROEWS.

~ DISPATCH —

Ay —no EEN ins-made—and—t!
job-still- to “bo” do! bIfention in bookIct form; a new leaflet
Yor Cuba showing how personal and family security are endangered more
by not doing anything than by taking whatever steps against the regimo
are possible depending upon the opportunities which arise; and a
Jeaflot for Latin Amcrican distribution showing on a map of Cuba the
reported sites for the training of terriorists, A new departure in
propaganda to Cuba will bo tho printing of the backs of all future
leaflets in script form so that thoy will appoar to bo handwritten
letters if viewed through the unvolopes. Heretofore AMSCROLL has
been onfolding other printed material in a simulated handwritten
wrapper, but now cach item will havo its own "personal lottor" built
4n to save valuable weight and bulk in the covers while still: hopefully)

doceiving Cuban postal authorities.
