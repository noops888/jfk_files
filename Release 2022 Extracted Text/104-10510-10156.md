TR RES RRR
Referenco: UFGA-25261, paragraph 11 (3 June 1966) :4.,24-4s-/4

1. The vocational rehabilitation phase of the ANBUD medical
program ended on 30 June 1966 with the completion of courses by the
remaining trainees. The activity, established in April 1964 by
arrangement with the Florida State Division of Vocational Rehabili~
tation, has reduced the number of medjeal dependency cases from 69

to six. One of the remaining cases, pis
a,Garela Lines case funded by Headqua¥tors, These six nen stépresent

difficult medical problems whose disposition will be the subject of
A separato report,

2, The original 69 cases classified as unemployable because

of medical disability were referred to the AMBUD vocational reha-~
bilitation activity as a means of terminating WOFACT responsibility
for their continued support, Initial processing of the 69 referrals
resulted in 58 active Participants of which 35 were ultimately re~
turned to employment. Twenty-three were dropped during evaluation
or training for many reasons including lack of interest, excessive
absenteeism, inability to learn, emotional instability, severity of
handicap, relocation, or confinement in an institution, However,
some of the marginal cases in this group were given partial training
and/or a routine of work which resulted in acquiring sufficient
motivation to solve their own work problems,

3. A list of the participants, courses attended, date and
reason dropped, or date course completed is attached. It should
be noted that most of the trainees also benefited from pre-vocational
training English language instruction which made them more attractive

to the potential employers,

4. The apparent success of the vocational rehabilitation
activity could be largely attributed to the supervisor, Mr. Gordon

D, Smith, a senior counselor assigned to the activity by his
pau. Continued...
