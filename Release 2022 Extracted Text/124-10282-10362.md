cautious, and somewhat defensive. Subject maintained she had no

detailed knowledge of the newly formed Communist Party of the

U.S.A. (Marxist-Leninist) in Los Angeles, the Ad Hoc Committee for

the U.S., but she had cut him off and insisted on confining her

remarks to the EPION case.

O. SUGAR described Subject as about 45 to 50 years old,

5 feet tall, and of squarish build, with dark hair and a "Slavic"

appearance.
