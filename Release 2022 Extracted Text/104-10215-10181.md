CONFIRMED INFORMATION CONCERNING THE NUMBER OF SOVIETS IN CUBA.
SOME ARE LEAVING BUT SOME ARE ALSO ARRIVING, SOURCE IS NOT AWARE

OF ANY SOVIET INFANTRY OR ARMORED COMBAT UNITS. PRESENTLY IN CUBA.

HE STATED THAT ANY UNITS WHICH MAY HAVE FITTED THIS CATEGORY LEFT

WITH THE IRBM'S IN NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER 1962. HE IS CERTAIN THAT
ALL IRBM'S AND BOMBERS HAVE BEEN TAKEN OUT.)

2. CASTRO CONTINUES TO BE UNHAPPY WITH THE SOVIETS AND WILL
NEVER FORGET THE TREATMENT HE RECEIVED FROM THEM IN THE PALL OF 1962.
CASTRO IS MUCH CLOSER TO THE CHINESE LINE BUT REALIZES HE CANNOT
EXIST WITHOUT SOVIET AID. HE INSISTS THAT THE CUBANS BE TRAINED
AND ASSUME CONTROL OF ALL SOVIET EQUIPMENT IN CUBA. BECAUSE CASTRO
BECOMES ENRAGED OVER REING CALLED ANYONE’S STOOGE AND FEELS SO
STRONGLY AND PROUD OF THE INDEPENDENT POSITION HE HAS TAKEN, SUCH
AS NOT AUTHORIZING GROUND INSPECTION AND NOT SIGNING THE PARTIAL
TEST BAN TREATY, IT IS BELIEVED THAT HE WILL INSIST THAT THE SOVIETS
LEAVE WHEN THE CUBANS ARE TRAINED AND CAN HANDLE THE EQUIPM=.T.

3. MIG-19 PILOTS wee tenes BOTH THE SOVIET UNION
AND CHINA, SOME, SUCH are "AND" VERONITA’ (SIC) , RECEIVED
MIG-21 TRAINING EARLY IN CUBA AND MORE PILOTS ARE PRESENTLY TRAINING
IN CUBA. (HEADQUARTERS COMMENT: PRENDES IS PROBABLY CAPTAIN ALVARO
PRENDES QUINTANA; VERONITA IS POSSIBLY IDENTICAL WITH CAPTAIN ENRIQUE

VARONA,) THE MIG-21'S ARE CONTROLLED BY THE CUBANS, BUT THE SOVIETS
REMAIN AS ADVISERS.
