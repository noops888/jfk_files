MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director for Plans

SUBJECT: Discussion with Mr. Richard Davis, â€˜|
: i Deputy Assistant Secretary of
State for European Affairs

..1. I visited the Departzent today for discussions
of the Cherepanov and Martin cases with Mr. Richard Davis,
Also present was Mr. John Guthrie, Chief, SOV/EUR,

2. I first showed Davis and Guthrie a copy of the
preliminary traces on the Soviet officers whose names
appeared in the Cherepanov papers, They were particularly
interested in learning the truce name of Counselor of the
Soviet Embassy Fomin. Both officers were cautioned that
this was sensitive information and could not be used
overtly. I also informed Davis that the University of
Illinois Librarian Willer had just returned fron his
trip and that Mr. Joseph Bulik had left for Illinois to
interview hin,

3. With respect to the dinner at the home of tho
Soviet Consular Officer Begunkov attended by. Nr. Thomas
Fain in Moscow, I informed Davis that our records indi-
cated that Begunkov was an intelligence officer. Davis
said he suspected as much and that in his view the Soviet's
principal interest in wining and dining Fain was to dis-
cover how we got the Cherepanov documents and why wo re-
turned them. Davis added that if he needed anything to
convince him further of the mistake in returning these
documents, the Fain-Begunkov dinner party offered final
proof. Both Davis and Guthrie remarked that Ambassador
Xohler would recognize the error and would insure that
the error was not repeated,

4, Finally, on the Cherepanov matter, Dick Davis
asked if we had any objection to his showing these papers
to Ambassador Thompson. I said we had none and I mentioned
that you were also interested in the Ambassador's seeing
the papers. I asked that when the Department is finished
with them they be returned to us.

5. On the Martin case, Davis was told that Ors. ae

{ who alleged that he had been told by Soviet authorities

that he must not tell Renninger and White his true nane
if they asked hin. Davis was concerned that the two
exchange professors might not conduct themselves with
sufficient discretion and caution in this contact. I
assured him that both had been instructed not to seek
out Martin nor to invite hia to their quarters. However,
if Martin attempted to see them on the premises of the
Institute, they were not to reject the contact. I added
here that we would re-emphasize this in a letter to the
Embassy after we had had the initial reaction from NSA,
whom we have just informed of this, and also had a chance
to read the Martin file. Davis then said that he had
informed the Secretary of State of this meeting and that
further correspondence on it would be handled in CIA
channels.

6. Davist last remark on this matter was an ex-
pression of mild concern that the press might get news
of this chance meeting and cause all concerned con-
siderable embarrassment if it became public knowledge.
I said that whereas at some point there might be a
reason for publicizing our knowledge of Martin's ac-
tivities, we certainly agreed that at present it would
be the worst possible thing to have happen.
