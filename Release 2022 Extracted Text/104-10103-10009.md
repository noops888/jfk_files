CIA's Performance On The: Inquiries

Book V of the SSC Final Report chal lenges the performance of the
Lahde agencies during the Warren Commission inquiry, emphasizing —
things that # # tests-should have been done but which if asserteAvere
not.

It is correct to say that CIA has not produced evidence or analysis
that addresses every theory that has been advanced over the years. As
a practical consideration, it is unlikely that every theoretical question
that can be conceived can be answered conclusively; there simply may
be no evidence at all, or if there is evidence somewhere, it may not

be accessible. The issue is what the intelligence agencies did, with
the SSC Final Report portraying what seems to be a pattern of neglect
or avoidance, which we believe is inconsistent with reason and the
record. ; :

_The SSC Final Report offers a number of separate subjects in
support of its case. It refers to an allegation by a person identified
as "D" (pages 28-30, 41-42 and 102-103) that he overheard and saw

, Oswald being handed money in Mexico City for the purpose of assassinating
President Kennedy; this was proven false, both by polygraph and by
determining that Oswald was in New Orleans instead of Mexico City at
the time the incident was supposed to have occurred. Nevertheless,

this. subject is treated in a confused and inconclusive manner in the



SSC Final Report. Great emphasis is placed on the AMLASH operation,
and its not being reported to the Warren Commission, inaccurately

attributing to it characteristics and therefore significance that it did

not have; this is treated in some detail at Tab A of this report. Space

is devoted to two atrcraft flights from Mexico City to Havana, on
22-November and 27 November, respectively, failures by CIA and the FBI
being charged. In fact, the first of the flights is inaccurately
described, the correct story removing the basis for the inferences
developed by the SSC version, In the second instance the subject in
question was the subject of a detailed inquiry as is discussed at Tab
_____ of this report. These examples create some problems, for the
reliability of the SSC Final Report unavoidably becomes the subject
of basic reservations in, the face of such errors. How to respond

to treatments that seem contrary to the facts and that are used as

a basis for serious criticisms sresen na pita, it is
necessary to review the record to the extent possible, and report the
Findings, whatever they are.

Recognizing the possibility of error or oversight in 1964 on the i
part of CIA,even in terms of the more limited-perceptions of the time,
it was decided to consider what courses of action CIA might have taken
to throw some light on the questions as wee understood at the time,
as well as considering those questions that -have been developed in the’
years following. What would be the areas of inquiry?

Oswald was known to have been out of the country twice sub-

sequent to his return to private life from the Marine Corps. The

‘first ‘of these overseas trips was when he went to the Soviet Union
“in 1959 from which he returned in June 1962. The second of these
trips was when he. went to Mexico City in late September 1963, from -

which he returned in early October 1963. In addition to these two

- areas of obvious inquiry, there is the problem of general intelli-

_ gence collection that might in some way produce information on the

subject. The SSC Final Report adds to these considerations opera-
tions being conducted by CIA as part of a general U.S. program against

the Castro regime: These four general areas of inquiry are covered -

i below.

Travel To And From The USSR 1959-1962 .

Yee 26 November'1963 a cable was sent.to Paris, Rome, Madrid,
[Gerdsreser} ose (rate Brussels, The Hague, London, and Ottawa

. giving biographic information on Lee Harvey Oswald. It noted his

discharge from the Marine Corps 11 September 1959 and his travel
to the Soviet Union in October 1959, including sketchy details as
to his employment and marriage while in Russia. Information was
requested on: :

“any scrap information which bears on

President's assassination . . aw
1. On 27 November the various addressee’ stations replied, with
[rie sihkiJond London providing additional details on the travel of
Oswald to the USSR. London reported that a British journalist
claimed that during his own. impriSonment in Cuba in 1959 there was

a U.S. gangster there by the name of Santos, who was living in

/5R


luxury in jail because he could not return to the U.S.3 the source

stated that Santos was “visited frequently by another American

gangster named 'Ruby'." :
Also on 27 November Ottawa reported the "del ight" of the Cuban

Embassy staff over the assassination of President Kennedy although
the staff was instructed to “cease looking happy in public," in
conformance with instructions from Cuba. to "govern their actions

by official attitude of Govt to which they, accredited" (ostgp on
the same date, reported that the Soviets were shocked, blaming the
assassination on extreme right-wing elements. Otherwise, the initial
responses produced no other information. i

On 29 November The Hague and Frankfurt were queried about
Oswald's travel back from the USSR. This query was followed on
2 December by a similar cable to Berlin, Frankfurt, Bonn and The
Hague. Various reporting produced details about the travel of Oswald
and his wife from the USSR through Germany and the Netherlands en
route to United States in June 1962. : :

The other stations involved in these inquiries had no traces or
information on Oswald; Tiaison services were also queried without
detailed results although there were some technical operations that
produced peripheral information about the reactions of various groups

. under intelligence surveillance. Considerable exchanges were held with
the Warren Commission on Oswald's Soviet record and its possible ;
significance. Book V of the SSC Final Report, in not criticizing the

Agency's perfernance in this aspect of the investigation scems to have

accented it as ade zuste.

Oswald Mexico Visit -- September-October: 1963

The visit by Oswald to Mexico City, in his attempt to get a
visa for travel to the Soviet Union, transiting Cuba, has received
extensive attention. The ‘details concerning the knowledge about
Oswald is treated in another annex to this-paper (Tab’_). The
concern felt by all initially for the possible significance of
Oswald's visit, and his contacts with the Cuban and Soviet embassies,
was obvious at the time. The following statement is in a cable to
Mexico City on 28 November 1963:

“We have by no means excluded the possi-
bility that other as yet unknown persons
may have been involved or even that other
Powers may have played a role. Please
continue all your coverage of Soviet and
Cuban installations and your liaison with
Mexicans." :
The allegations made’ by "D"- about having seen Oswald taking money from

Cubans received intensive attention from CIA and the FBI, working

_— closely on the matter, and withthe Mexican authorities. CHytswas-

se-aHegation. After the

allegations by "D" had been proven false, Headquarters made the follow-

ing statement to the Mexico City Station on 1 December 1963:
i “Pis continue to follow all leads and tips.
The question of ‘whether Oswald acted solely

on his own has still not been finally resolved."



Again, on 13 December 1963 the Mexico City Station was cabled as
follows:
u "Pls continue watch for Soviet or Cuban reaction
to investigation of assassination, evidence
of their complicity, signs they putting out
propaganda about case. FYI only, Soviet Intel
in India had letters Sent to ODYOKE readers
demanding full investigation of case." c
On 17 December. 1963 Headquarters forwarded a dispatch to the Mexico
City Station stating as follows:
",. . . Mexico City has been the only major
overseas reporter in the case. While this
partly dictated by the facts of Lee OSWALD's
life, we have not overlooked the really out-
standing performance of Mexico City's major
assets and the speed, precision, and perception
with which the data was forwarded. Here it was
relayed within minutes to the White House,
ODACID, and ODENVY.
“Your LIENVOY data, the statements of Silvia
DURAN, and your analyses were major factors
in the quick clarification of the case, blank-
ing out the really ominous spectre of foreign

backing."



Essentially, the/trip of Oswald to Mexico City was investigated

as thoroughly as possible without producing any evidence thond: of Soviet
or Cuban complicity in the assassination of President Kennedy. If
anything, events ‘during Oswald's visit there are more subject to being
seen as counter to such a possibility, given his troubles with both
Cubans and Soviets. We do not offer this possible analysis as a

proper view, but simply. note that if it means anything it tends to
counter speculation to the contrary.

General Collection Requirements :
On 22 November 1963 al] CIA stations abroad received a cable
(DIR ¢4608)
from Headquarters with the following statement:
"Tragic death of President Kennedy requires
all of us to look sharp for any unusal
‘intelligence developments. Although we
have no reason to expect anything ofa
particular military nature, all hands
should be on the quick alert at least
for the next few days while the new
President takes over the reins.!

It is appropriate at this point to observe the general reaction
to be expected from such a communication. In this case, without
any leaks, the requirements had to be general. General reporting
can be stimulated by general requests if there is something to report.
Beyond this, in any event, in the world of intelligence, reporting

assets and liaison services overseas are quick to realize the

Re ee

Significance of important information and will report in on their

own initiative. It must be considered significant, in the light of
these considerations, that there has been massive silence on the
subject over the years. Were there relevant or significant information —
on the subject it would have. been reported either in response¢ to the
expression of general interest, or spontaneously, if such information
was known to Agency sources.

If one believes that there was a conspiracy, with Oswald involved,
one must accept the likelihood that his fellow conspirators would not
have shared the. knowledge beyond the narrow circle of those directly
involved. Conversely, if there were no conspiracy, there obviously
would be nothing to report in the first.place. In either event,
insistence that CIA produce something that proves or disproves the
conspiracy theory flies in the face of a view that absence of reporting
means that no collection requirements were issued.

The general collection requirements were addressed to stations

i with Cuban assets. The Miami Station did query its assets, but as

was stated by the Chief of the Miami Station, in his testimony

before the Committee, we had no real Tounces inside Cuba that could

be expected to help on this (page 58), much less “an extensive intelli-
gence network in Cuba" (as stated at page 10 of the SSC Final Report) :
that could be expected to have special access to such information.

His characterization of acting in a "passive way" was seized on in the
SSC Final Report, without its qual ifying comments. In fact Cuban

sources were made aware of interests in information. .



UUNTIUERIA

White the SSC Final Report undertakes to paint this in different
terms, it is very difficult to conceive, even today, what could have
been done in this respect that was not done.

“CIA Operations Against Cuba

The SSC Final Report speaks of various operations against Cuba
and the Castro regime that should have been reported to the Warren
Commission as part of the subject matter ‘that it consciously took
into consideration.

To demonstrate its case the SSC Final Report discusses Operation

AMLASH extensively. Because of the extensive treatment given that

_ activity im the SSC Final Report, we have addressed jt in detail

in one of the other annexes of this report (Tab A). We feel that
the SSC Final Report did not analyze that activity carefully and as
a result misunderstood it, and that much of its presentation is - :
therefore badly flawed. That will not be treated in detail again
here. :

The discussion at Tab A does refer to other known operational
activities against Cuba, and the remarkable tensions between the Cuban

and U.S. governments. The following discussion addresses what has

_ been done recently in CIA to review all other Cuban operations to see

what they may reveal relating to the Kennedy assassination.

In 1964 the people responsible for the various operations were
still assigned to the general field of Cuban operations. They knew
what was in them, and what was not.” Today, persons unfamiliar with

the files’ have gone through them in'detail to determine if there was
anything in them relevant to the Kennedy assassination.



CONFIDENTIAL

This search of old operational files necessarily meant that not
only the obvious would be picked out, but that hypothetical tests
must be applied to information and that tenuous possibilities would
be treated as real for the purpose of the review. Findings imight well

‘be of a nature that would not be acceptable under normal professional

standards. Nevertheless, to ensure thoroughness, even the most far-out

possibility was to be scrutinized, with the thinnest leads being

offered up for consideration. The fact that they are recorded does not

mean that they are accepted as real, but simply that they were noted
in the course of the special research that was undertaken. ordinarily
these items might not be dignified by even taking them past the first
phase of hypothetical consideration. There always are reservations
about. advancing unfounded theory beyond this first step; nowadays
this is an additional consideration simply because once they find their
way into print they may find their way into the public domain without
the profound reservations that may be held about them. The talent of
the press for extravagant extrapolation and selective reporting almost
certainly seems to risk a reckless and irresponsible presentations
the public, once separated from the special circumstances that
produced them. Nevertheless, they are duly recorded here.

The relevance of the eee For owing tenuous summaries is based
on an hypothesis that has attracted. some current acceptance, but
but that is seriously flawed in itself. This is the hypothesis that

actions of the U.S. Government were so provocative to Castro that he



CONFIDENTIAL

retaliated by ordering the assassination of President Kennedy. There
has never been a secret about the tensions between the Kennedy Adminis-
tration and the Castro regime. The SSC Final Report notes this (pages
2, 3, 10 and 11). In fact, the totality of American policy and practice
must have appeared threatening to ‘the Castro ‘regime, and most certainly

was consjdered by it a Lipepadiro On the basis of this hypothesis,

Lhe FSC ww he Fa

Fhe SSC Final Report feels/ thes should have been reported to the Warren.
Commission. The approach in the SSC Final Report was to select separate
elements of the overall program directed against the Castro regime which
might, of themselves, have bean especially provocative to the Cubans
had they learned of them. This selection of separate activities, seeing
in them especially provocative characteristics, hypothesizing a possi-
bility that they might have become known to the Castro regime, and

then pointing to an-ultimate conclusion of responsibility, presents

a series of discrete progressions that must be viewed at-each step: the
selection must be well founded (the SSC dismissed out of hand the
relevance of the operation against Castro that involved the criminal
underworld, while the AMLASH operation failfs to support the thesis);
the provocative characteristics must be well “founded (the treatment of
the AMLASH operation does this unsuccessfully); the possibility that
the Castro regime learned of the activity in its essential characteristics
(this is not done, either Sfconctusively demonstrating its security
weakness or even that the SSC really appreciated the nature of the

operations and then there would have to be some serious consideration



of how Castro would have reacted, given all the questions that would
have been presented to him in taking the action suggested by the SSC
Final Report. i

It obviously was on the basis of the well known general ly low
state of relations between the U.S. and Cuba that the possibility of
Cuban involvement with Oswald was considered at the beginning of the
investigation. The Warren Commission obviously did not.elect to inquire
about the separate Pieces of the entire -Kennedy anti-Castro program,
but relied primarily--as still seems appropriate today--on: extensive
and detailed reconstruction of Oswald's history to ascertain where he
had been, what he had done, the identity of his associates, etc. This
was supported by more general information requirements levied among
Cuban sources who might know or learn something, as well as sources in
other parts of the world, especially in Europe.

Today in 1977 it is difficult to reconstruct exactly everything

_ that did and did not happen in 1964, although when specific issues are

raised they can be checked. For instance, .there were many individuals
assigned to various aspects of Cuban operations. “They were familiar
with those activities, and.with their strengths and weaknesses. Had
they known of any aspects of their operations that might have born

on the assassination of President Kennedy, it is certain that Se Koutd
have been reported, as in fact were a number of separate items of
information: That sources did not report more meaningful information
is an indication of what was known then to those actually involved and

what could be learned.



Today, the knowledge of the persons directly involved in the
various operations in the period preceding President Kennedy's death
cannot be recaptured in the form it existed then. Those persons are
scattered, their memories are not as detailed or accurate as they then
were, and some are dead. The SSC--in its attempt to capture elements
of the past--led some employees into expressing opinions on subject
matter they did not know about in 1964,. phrased to be responsive to
representations of SSC staff members that: were inaccurates this
illustrates at best the difficulties in resolving the question today
on a responsible basis.

In the face. of the hypothesis advanced by the SSC Final Report,
with its interpretations based on imprecise presentations of events

Lana a generally captious character of its arguments, /it has been felt
necessary to review.in great detail all records of Cuban operations
conducted by CIA during the period in question, 1960-64. The organi-
zation of the review is described at Tab ic Tt was not easy to”
predict the form that information turned up by this inquiry might take,
and special care had to be exercised in thé effort. In doing this the
provocation concept was kept in mind.. In the months that it took to
complete this extensive review, it is significant to observe that only
two areas of specific operational activity were found that might: meet
some of the requirements of the provocation theory, or that in any
way might relate to the assassination of President Kennedy. To report
this conclusion to the research is not to set aside the original general

question facing the Warren Commission, that led to the initial concern



over: whether there might be Cuban or Soyiet connections behind Oswald,
arising from the state of relations between Cuba and the U.S. That
such possibilities remain unresolved in some minds is apparent, but
that the records for that period disclose no such leads today, and
* that the appropriate sources were queried at the time of the investi-
"gation, is the conclusion of the present inquiry.
; The two areas of operational activity noted above can be described
briefly as follows: : :
a Operations directed against the Cuban leadership.

bh Operations involving the criminal underworld.
