ADDENDUM TO FOOTNOTE # 614 OF “LEE HARVEY OSWALD, THE cr
AND MEXICO CITY.

Some controversy has arisen in regard to the question
of whether the tapes existed at the time of the assass-
ination due to a memorandum from J. Edgar Hoover to the
head of the Secret Service which said:

The Central Intelligence Agency advised that

on October -1, 1963, an extremely sensitive
source had reported that an individual iden-
tified himself as Lee Oswald, who contacted the
Soviet Embassy in Mexico City inquiring as to
any messages. Special Agents of this Bureau,
who have conversed with Oswald in Dallas,
Texas, have observed photographs of the indi-
vidual referred to akove and have listened to
a recording of his vcice. These Special Agents
are of the opinion that the above-referred-to
individual was not Lee Harvey Oswald.

(Memorandum from Hoover to James. J. Rowley, 11/23/63,
pp. 4-5.) The HSCA has determined that this statement
was probably. based on ancther FBI memorandum which said:
Inasmuch as the Dallas Agents who. listened to the
tape of the conversation allegedly of Oswald
from the, Cuban Embassy to the Russian Embassy in
Mexico and examined the photographs of the visitor
to the Embassy in Mexico and were of the opinion
that neither the tape nor the photograph pertained
to Oswald, I requested Shanklin to immediately
send a photograph of Oswald to our Legal Attache.
(Memorandum from Belmont to Tolson, 11/23/63, suet Wee hae
Belmont was. reporting the results of a conversation with
the Special Agent in Charge in Dallas, Gordon Shanklin,

that occured at 11:50 A.M.).

Later that same day SiC Shanklin informed the Director
that the tape of Oswald's voice had been erased: “It
should be noted that the actual tape from which this
transcript was made has b2en erased." (Teletype from
SAC Dallas to Director, # 232220, 7:30 P.M. CST,. 11/23/63.
Emphasis in the original.)

The confusion about whether or not there was a tape
apparently continued for several days after the SAC in
Dallas ‘informed the Director that such a tape did not
exist. On 11/25/63 the FBI Legat in Mexico City sent a
Cablegram to the director which said: :

There appears to be some confusion in that no

tapes were taken to Lallas but only typewritten

transcripts supplied by CIA, the tapes not being

available because they had been erased.
(Cablegram #. 182 & 183, ¢. 2.)

The FBI was asked to explain the paragraph from the
Hoover memorandum quoted above. ‘It responded:

The paragraph appearing on pages 4 and 5 of the

leterhead memorandum, which is quoted in your

(FBI) request of March 17, 1978, contains some

incorrect informatior regarding a tape recording

of the voice of an irdividual who identified him- ~

self as Lee Oswald. :

provided the FBI with photographs of an individ-

i A It is noted that the FBI never received the

3 actual tape recordings from which the transcripts
were derived, as the tapes were erased by the
other government agency providing the transcripts....

As a result, no FBI employee ever listened to a
tape recording purporting to contain Lee Harvey
Oswald's. voice as no tape was ever provided to

this Bureau. :

B. Differences: Between the Warren Commission
Investigation of Lee Harvey Oswald's
Activities in Mexico City and the House
Select Committee on Assassination's

Investigation.

The approach taken by this Committee's investigation
differs from that of the Warren Commission primarily
in terms of scope. The Warren Commission and. the

, : investigative agencies at its disposal went. to

@ great lengths to establish Oswald's travel to and
from Mexico, but devoted minimal effort to
evaluating Oswald's contacts with the Cuban and
Soviet Consulates. It is the. conclusion of this
Committee that the Warren Commission correctly
ésteblishéd that Oswald hac traveled to Mexico
City. Hence, this Committee has chosen not to
reimvastigate Oswald's travel to and from Mexico City.
Instead, the Committee's approach has been to focus

narrowly am Oswald's contacts with. the Soviet and

Cubén diplomatic. missions.-n Mexico City and on

{ : Commission that could possibly shed light on
Oswald's activities in Mexico City outside of the
Soviet and Cuban installations.

The Warren Report limited its discussion of.
Oswald's contacts with the Soviet and Cuban diplomatic
i missions to information obtained from Sylvia Duran

and the Cuban Government.1,
j At one point in the Report the Commission referred
to other information:
By far the most impcertant confirmation
of Senora Duran's testimony, however, has been
. supplied by confidentia sources of extremely high
t ) reliability available to the United States in
Mexico. The information from these sources
establishes that her testimony was truthful and
. accurate in all materia respects. The identities
of these sources cannot be disclosed without

destroying their future usefulness to the
United States.2/

its statement that Silvia furan's testimony was

In an attempt to answer the questions posed by
Lee Harvey Oswald's visit to Mexico City in September
and October of 1963, the House Select Committee on
Assassinations has pursued the following investigative
procedure:

‘Y) Conducted extensive interviews, depositions,
and executive sessicn hearings involving
Central Intelligence Agency personnel;

2) Interviewed Cuban c’tizens who could have
knowledge of Oswald's sojourn in Mexico;

Interviewed Mexican citizens who could have

With the exception of those areas that

involved sensitive sources and methods,

such as theinformation pertaining to the”

electronic and photographic surveillance
of the Soviet and Cuban diplomatic
compounds, information developed by

the CIA in Mexico was generally relayed
to the Warren Commission in an accurate
and expeditious manner.

It is the conclusion of this Committee
that the CIA's photo-surveillance
operations in Mexico City probably
obtained a photograph of Lee Harvey
Oswald entering either or both the
Soviet and Cuban Consulates. The CIA

denies that such a photograph exists.

Hence, the dispostion of this photograph

While there is to direct evidence on the

of such a nature that the possibility can

not be dismissed.

This dispatch is intended to familiarize
Headquarters. with the details of the Pulse
Camera operation in Mexico City, which was
mounted in December 1963 and is targeted
against the (Cuban) Embassy and Consulate.59/
The dispatch goes on to report that a technician from
Headquarters brought’ a pulse camera to Mexico City in
mid=December 1963, installed and tested it, and
instructed the technician resident. in Mexico City and
the base agent in the use and maintenance of the camera.60/
On the basis of HMMA-22307, HMMA-22433 and MEXI

e@ the pulse camera was in operation on the days: that
Lee Harvey Oswald visited the Cuban Consulate. This

said, in part:

First, while admittedly there are contra-
dictions in the Agency's written records,
these records nevertheless suggest that an
impulse camera was ‘n operation when Oswald
visited the Cuban Enbassy. Such a camera
would have automatically been triggered
to photograph any person entering the Embassy.
In addition, it, has been determined by this

--. Committee that Oswa'd entered and exited

j : ~--. from the Cuban and Soviet compounds on at
least five separate occasions, resulting: in
a total of ten oppo-tunities during which
Oswald could have been photographed by CIA
surveillance camera. The existence of an
Agency photograph of Oswald has been further
corroborated by CIA personnel both in Mexico
E City and at Agency readquarters who claim to
i : have seen this mate-ial.

Finally, on October 6, 1978, a manuscript

written by the late Win Scott, former Chief

t of Station of the CIA's Mexico City Station,

i d was reviewed by a staff member of this Commit-

i tee. While the criticism can be offered that
Scott's manuscript as not yet been established
as a true record, r2levant portions of this

manuscript do suggest that the contents are

i accurate and that pnotographs of Oswald were

a ~~ -dn fact obtained by the CIA's Mexico City sur- °

veillance operations. At page 273 of the

manuscript, Scott wrote:

“A VA “hb LA GT “EE. YA.

time he spent on each visit. The

obviously that 2. Soviet Embassy official
in Washington hed offered to help
Oswald.

Scott's comments are a source of deep concern

to this Committee, vor they suggest your
Agency's possible w'thholding of photographic
materials highly re evant to this investigation.

Therefore, the Committee reiterates its
request of May 2, including but not limited to
-—~- any and all photographs in the CIA's possession
of Lee Harvey Oswald resulting from CIA
surveillance operations directed against the
Soviet and Cuban Emoassies and Consulates in
Mexico City.. In adjiition, the Committee
requests a detailed explanation regarding the
withholding of any ind all photographs in the
CIA's possession of Oswald resulting from
: CIA surveillance oparations directed against
@ the Soviet and Cuban Embassies and Consulates a]
in Mexico City.65/ 2 .

The CIA responded to this letter on 25 October
1978.66/ The CIA informed the Committee that it was

date, or at some date not long afterwards,
there was test photography of the entrance...
Various difficulties were experienced with
the equipment, whic seems eventually to have
been resolved by installation of the pulse
camera in December 1963. There is no question
about the sequence set forth above.68/
HMMA-22307 definitely reports the installation
of the two cameras and a V:S-2 trigger device on
27 September 1963.69/ But the cameras did not

It was replaced with the first Robot Star, which had

A second Robot Star broke down after five days of
operation.73/ A Robot Star was working on 7 November
1963, when HMMA-22433 requested that Headquarters send
a replacement camera to Mexico.74/ In all likelihood,
that request was filled with the installation of the

“operation in mid-December 1963 as claimed by the CIA.
But the first pulse camera was set up-on Friday,
September 27, 1963. The documents do not specify the
days that the original cameras functioned. HMMA-22307
says:

(The. base agent) was requested to test

the Robot Star Camera for four days and the
K-100 for another four days.76/

HMMA~22433 says:

(The base agent) used the K-100 with a 152 mm
lens for one day, turning in 10: fee (sic) of
16 mm film...The Robot Star and the Telyt

was given to (the bass agent) with the VLS-2
broke down after. ridays of photographing.

Robot.. Five days later the second camera
failed to advance properly.77/

This Committee believes that it is reasonable to assume
that the base agent started using the equipment
immediately after it was installed.78/' Hence, the one
day that the K-100 was used would have been either

the 27th (the day it was installed), the 28th (a
Saturday) or the 30th (the following Monday). It

is also reasonable to assume that the Robot Star was

was to get identifiable photographs of all visitors |

were spelled out in the 1966 Project Renewal request.
Its original objectives, still current,
include furnishing photographic coverage during
daylight hours of the Embassy and Consulate

There were three bases which provided photo-
graphic surveillance of the Soviet diplomatic compound
in 1963.109/ One of the bases overlooked the enclosed
garden or “backyard". area of the Soviet Embassy.110/
The other two bases, of primary concern to this
Committee, covered the entrance to the Soviet
compound.111/ The primary base, LIMITED, was
directly across the street intersection from the main
Soviet Embassy gate; the secondary, or "back-up,"

LILYRIC base was across the.street and down a little

@ way from the main Embassy gate.112/

3. Objectives of (peration and Scope of

Coverage Provided

The purpose of this operation has also been
t described as being to obtain photographs of Soviet
officials and their families; all foreigners
{non-Latins) who visited the Embassy; and cars with
foreign license plates.113/ One of the main purposes
of the photographic bases that covered the Embassy gate
was.to obtain a photograpa of every "foreigner," or

non-Latin, in contact with the Soviet Embassy.114/

This was done in an attempt to identify possible

My understanding of that was that it was to

be used to identify those people who might

be working for the Soviets as espionage

agents who were U.S. citizens who went down

there driving a car with a U.S. license

plate on it, or people we did not know

The House Select Conmittee on Assassinations
next attempted to determine the scope of the photographic
coverage on the main gate cf the Soviet Embassy. At
a minimum, the Embassy was probably covered by the
photographic operations during office hours. "The
instructions were to cover the entire work day.

Given the somewhat uneven nature of the coverage
maintained by LIMITED,131/ the House Select. Committee
on Assassinations staff asked whether the two bases
were run in conjunction so as to provide more
comprehensive coverage.. Tromas Keenan, the project's
case officer, did not remenber that this was-.the case.
He did. remember that both tases operated at the same
time so as to. get the most complete coverage possible.132/
Mr. Keenan was’ not sure whether there was routine
coverage of the Soviet Embessy on weekends.133/ He

e said that it was possible that there was routine
coverage on Saturday mornirgs.134/

An examination of tte project file maintained
by the CIA on ‘the photographic coverage of the Soviet
Embassy does not bear out Mr. Keenan's assertion
that the two bases duplicaied efforts. . In fact,..the
project file confirmed thai. the bases complemented each
other rather than duplicated efforts. This was the

case in 1960 when a projeci. review stated:

FI/OPS recommends s=rongly that the photo
coverage be reviewed from the standpoint

of value and usefulness with a view to
determining whether the LILYRIC activity
could not be safely eliminated and the

photography is negligible compared to their

The Station. feels that it would be helpful

to summarize at this time information
previously reported to Headquarters (see
paragraph 3, reference B) concerning the photo
basehouses under this project and thereby

give Headquarters an updated frame of
reference in which to view the roles of the
various basehouses.

The LIMITED and LILYRIC basehouses
provide coverage of front of the LIMERICK
‘installation. Althcugh on the surface it may
appear that these tno basehouses provide
duplicate take, this is not the case. It has

een the Station's experience in running the
unilateral LIEMPTY operation that a 0900 to
evening workday, which would be required of

a single basehouse in order to cover the
LIMERICK target effectively, is just too long
for any: pair of agerts to remain effective.

t ) This is: especially irue when it is considered
that- these basehouse operators. are essentially
unsupervised during their workday. It would
also be impossible «or a single ‘base-house to
provide: the kind of coverage this station needs
on the target insta lation, especially during
the peak hours of activity, namely late
morning and early a‘ternoon. For these
reasons, the LILYRIU basehouse generally
operates from 0900 :o 1400 or 1500 weekdays.
LIMITED operates from 1200 to 1800 or dark
(as the daily situa:ion dictates) on weekdays,

_and 0900 to 1400 on Saturdays. (These hours
are Subject to chanje to fit Station needs.)
Special coverage fo- Sunday is arranged on a
need basis; however, past experience has shown
regular coverage of Saturday afternoons and
Sundays is not rewarding. This schedule
provides for both basehouses to be in action

It must also be considered that without

Committee has. not been abl2 to establish or disprove
the possible inference that LILYRIC covered those
days when. there was no coverage from LIMITED because
the. production and logs from the LILYRIC base were
not made available for review.’ That material was

explanation of why this material is missing was

folders for the destroyed naterial were ralsed to
forward more recent photographic material to
Headquarters for retention. "143/ The folders which
once contained the production were located at the
National Archives' Warrenton Records Center but,
according to the CIA's explanation, the folders
contained Production material from 1967.144/ Because

overall responsibility for this project. Ms. Good-
pasture testified that the responsibility was Mr.
Keenan's.156/ Mr. Keenan, according to Ms. Good-

pasture, made alJ the decisions and had all the

responsibility involved in the operation.157/ Mr.

Keenan was the most junior Operations Officer in

the Mexico City Station in 1963, and claims that his

role in the operation was targely limited to legwork.158/
Ms. Goodpasture testified that her role in the

operation was limited to acting as an alte-nate

Case Officer, :internal rou:ing of the production,

“and review of the photographs to insure the maintenance

of technical quality in the operation.159/ Ann

was “a Special Assistant" 1.0 the Chief of Station
and.that "her main respons bilities were to handle the
surveillance operations.."155/_ Mr. White stated that.
this included ‘both the pho:ographic and electronic
surveillance.166/ Mr. Whi:e remembered. that Thomas
Keenan "did help Annie witi some of the pickup

were with another operatioi.167/ Mr. White also
testified that: i
(Ann Goodpasture) carried with her a lot of
invisible authority that devolved upon her
because of her operational relationship with
the Chief of Station, who had absolute
confidence in her. She had a marvelous
memory. She was meticulous in detail. I

think he had every reason to put that kind
of trust in her.

She reported directly to him. While
she may not have been invested with any
command authority by virtue of her position
at the Station, certainly she'was a kind
of unofficial deputy for the purposes of
the operations that she was involved in.168/

Ms. Goodpasture was: asked adout Mr. White's statements
as well as similar statements by other people associated
with the CIA's Mexican operations.169/

Ms. Goodpasture: Well, I made more of those
statements as those people saw it in their

6. Coordination of Photographic and Electronic

Surveillance Operations

The Mexico City Station employed an operating
procedure whereby the functioning of the photographic
base and the electronic intercept base could be
coordinated. If the listering post monitor heard
something that would lead Fim to believe that there
was someone at one of the Embassies that should be

, photographed, he would alert the CIA technician in
@ ‘ the listening post who would then alert Ann Good-
pasture.181/ . Ms. Goodpasttre could then alert _
Thomas Keenan who would then notify the photographic
base.182/ The reporting tc Headquarters of information ~
generated by the photograptic surveillance operation
and the electronic operaticn was also coordinated.183/
The Station was able to go back to the photographic
chronological file to checl for photographs of
people that were picked up on the tap operation when
the transcripts were revieved.184/ It was a matter
of routine to check the photographic production when

I picked up, the transcribers were working

is doubtful that the listering post transcribers, who
were Mexican nationals, would have translated an
English conversation into Spanish and then transcribed
it. In Light of this, Tarisoff's recollection and

English Language Conversations
or other Conversations of

Special Interest

There was a procedu-e whereby Mr. Tarasoff's
transcription could be exp:dited if there was a
special interest in a particular conversation.270/
When the monitor in the listening post encountered
something. he considered imzortant enough to require
expedited transcription, it was possible for him to
bring this quickly to the Station's attention:271/
Although Arnold Arehart was not the Tarasoffs'
contact in September. or October of 1963, he did serve
as such at one time.272/ When he was interviewed by
the House Select Committee on Assassinations, Mr.

or Russian could be expedited.273/ He explained
that there-would not have teen such a process- for
a Russian conversation, sirce the importance of the
conversation could not be :udged due to the fact
that no one in the listenirg post could understand
that language.274/ Arehari. did say that there was
such @ procedure for Engli:h language conversations .275/
When one of the Mexican monitors encountered a
conversation in English, he would ask Arehart to
listen to that conversation.276/ After listening
to the.conversation, Arehast would decide whether or
not it warranted special actention.277/ If he deemed
that it was important enouyjh, he would mark the tape
“Urgent,” put it in a box, and deliver it to Ms.
Goodpasture.278/

Mr. Arehart's recollection was confirmed by an
examination of the project files for this operation.

Headquarters (is) nct well informed on the
way the Mexico Station exploits operational
leads from (this operation). The outside
staff agent, Arnold Arehart has instructions
to alert the Statior immediately if a U.S.
citizen or English speaking person tries
to contact any of tte target installations.
This is done by a telephone call from outside ©
the tap center at a pay phone to (Ann Good-
pasture) inside the Station. Emergency
meetings are arranged in double talk... (Good-
pasture) meets Arehirt within fifteen minutes
at a pre-arranged: downtown location and
receives the reel wth an extract of the
pertinent conversat'on. The reel is then
taken to the Station and given to the case
officer responsible for the target the person
was trying to conta..t. Headquarters is
7 notified by cable 0° the action taken.

Only in rare cases s information on a U.S.

approval.279/

If the tape was from a Sov et installation, the tape
would have been delivered che same day to the Tarasoffs

Mr. Herbert Manell.283/ Mr. Manell testified that

he had nothing to do with transporting the transcripts

The format of the transcripts that Mr. Tarasoff
produced was much the same as those of the Spanish ©
language transcripts described above.294/ Mr.
Tarasoff's transcripts wer? from Russian into English.295/
Many of Mr. Tarasoff's transcriptions bear the notation
"(previously transcribed)" after the meter number
referring to the reel footage location of a
conversation.297/ Mr. Tarasoff indicated that this
notation meant that the conversation had already been
transcribed from a tap on another embassy phone:

“Previously transcrioed"-means, for instance,

I went. to the embassy first and the embassy

number. was 605055. Now this number 501264

belonged to the filn's office. So consequently

if that particular call went out of the main
building to the films office and it had been

transcribed before, that is exactly what I

would do, put down "previously transcribed".
So there was no question of doing it twice.298/

This Committee requested access to any relevant
materials from this safe or July 6, 1978.352/

Access was granted on October 6, 1978. Two statements
by Mr. scott contained in these materials lend

circumstantial support for Ms. Tarasoff's testimony.

In 1970 Mr. Scott wrote; 7 7
Pung wan years AW Mewes y
Al had “many experiences, some of which I can
rite in detail. One of these pertains: to
Lee Harvey. Oswald and what I know (emphasis
in original) of his activities from the moment
» he arrived in Mexico, his contacts by
telephone and his visits to both the Soviet
and Cuban Embassies and his requests for
assistance from theie two Embassies in trying
to get to the Crime: with his wife and baby.
During his conversa:ions he cited a promise
from the Soviet Embissy in Washington that they
-would notify their :mbassy in Mexico of
Oswald's plan to as: them for assistance. 353/

In his unpublished manuscript, Scott refers to a
conversation in which Oswald gave the Soviet Embassy
“his name very slowly and czarefully."354/ Although
the transcripts available jo not bear out Scott's
recollections, there are iitéresting parallels with

the testimony of Anna Tarasoff and David Phillips. 355/

There are indications also that there was
one other additional call ihat may have been available
to the Mexico. City Station prior to the assassination
of President Kennedy. In che first statement by
Silvia Duran Banach to the CIA by the Hee! To
government, Silvia says that the Cuban Consul “atted
the Soviet Consular officiil who dealt with Oswald. 356/
This statement is also mis:ing from most subsequent
reports of Ms. Duran's sta:ements, with the notable
exception of the first CIA report to the Warren .
Commission. 357/ Ms. Duran 5 early statement was
confirmed by Eusebio Azcue 358/ This conversation
was not discovered by a review of the transcripts from
the intercept operation. [t is possible that the call
made by Azcue was to a phoie at the. Russian Consulate
that was not subject to el2ctronic surveillance. It
is known that two of the ee at the Soviet
Consulate were subject to surveillance.359/ This
Committee has not determin2d how many telephones were

in the Soviet Consulate in Mexico City.

While this Committe? has not been able to find
any direct corroboration of Anna Tarasoff's claim, :
the circumstantial corroboration is such that the
possibility that there was an additional transcript
concerning Oswald that was available to the Mexico
City Station in late 1963.cannot be dismissed. In .
av likelihood, the Azcue call to the Soviet Consulate
concerning Oswald was probably made on telephones

not subject to CIA surveillance and, hence, would

“would give the true story on the Photograph
Produced by the CIA which the CIA claimed was taken
of Oswald in Mexico City in 1963."370/ Phillip
Agee was interviewed by HSCA staff investigators on
11 and 12 January 1978.

Mr. Agee told the investigators that he had
been assigned to the Mexico Branch of the Western

After his transfer to the Mexico Branch, Mr.
Agee heard a story about photographs of Oswald. Mr.
Agee could not remember with certainty who it had been

been Ms. Scaleti.376/ Mr. igee's recollection of the
story he had heard was that on the day of the
assassination Ms. Scaleti'wis working in the Mexico

1966.377/ When the news about Oswald's arrest

reached Ms. Scaleti, she recalled seeing his fame and

located the photograph of Jswald visiting the Soviet
Embassy in Mexico City.379’. Mr. Agee went on to
say:

I don't know, don't recall in. factyghow she
had been able to reconcile or how they were
able to reconcile ia Mexico City the photo-
graph with the name, unless someone had
known the face. Be-ause the problem with
these observation posts is that you can get
a lot of photographs from them, but to find
out the exact identity of the people is not
always an easy thing to do. And it may be
that as they were listening to the telephones
-of the Soviet Embassy, and also the Cuban
Embassy, that she remembered the name. Oswald
or Lee Harvey Oswald from the telephone tap,
if in fact he had identified himself over the
telephone, and tried to make an appointment
with the consul or whoever. And then they
were able somehow to reconcile the telephone
conversation with the photograph that was
taken from the observation post the same day
or more or Tess whenever the appointment was
made. On the other hand it may be that this
photograph had not been identified until the
time of the assassination but that she had
heard or recalled perhaps either reading the
transcript from the telephone tapping or
getting a condensed report perhaps a weekly
He Le or something of the take from the
telephone tap that she remembered the name
yLee Harvey Oswald and then went back into
the files of all the photographs and looked
through all the.photographs until eventually
she found a photograph that was similar to
all the photographs of Oswald that immediately
began to come over the television and the news
services. So those details I-don't remember

into the allegations mentioned above. 444/ :
' In an attempt to dete::‘mine whether the CIA's Mexico

City photographic bases did, in fact, Photograph Oswald,
this Committee requested the CIA to make available to

@ : the HSCA the production of these bases. 445/. The CIA
has in part responded to thi: request. 446/. However,
the production from LILYRIC, the second base that covered
the Soviet Embassy entrance, and the pulse camera that
covered the Cuban Consulate entrance, has not been made
available for review. 447/ “he Agency's withholding of

econstruction of the CIA Mexico City Station and Headquarters
Actions Prior to the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy.

A. Introduction--CIA Interest in and Liaison with FBI
Regarding American Citizens in Contact with Soviet
Bloc Embassies in Mexico City.

The Central Intelligence Agency has claimed that no
investigation of Oswald was made in Mexico prior to the
assassination of President Kennedy. For this reason, the
Agency claimed, the fact that Oswald was seeking a
visa and that he had also been to the Cuban Embassy was
not discovered until after the assassination

It was not until 22 November 1963, when the
Station initiated a review of all transcripts
of telephone calls tc the Soviet Embassy that
: the Station learned that Oswald's call to the

e@ Soviet Embassy on 1 (ctober 1963-.was in con-
nection with his reqrest for a visa to the USSR.
Because he wanted to travel to the USSR by way
of Cuba, Oswald had élso visited the Cuban Em-
bassy in an attempt io obtain a visa allowing
him to transit Cuba.

Inasmuch as Oswald wes not an investigative
responsibility of the CIA and because the

Agency had not received an official request from
those agencies havinu investigative responsibili-
ty requesting the Agency to obtain further in-
formation, the Station did nothing other than

ask Headquarters on 5 October for a photograph
of Oswald. 497/

Neither of. the above assertions. is accurate. An
analysis of thé information available will show that the
first assertion of the abov: quote, that. the Station did

not learn of Oswald's conta:t with the Cuban Consulate and

the fact that he was seeking a visa until after the as-

sassination is incorrect. 49i3/

CIA's IG Report inaccurately implies that no ac-
tion would have been taken by the Mexicaecity Station
with respect to an- American in contact with the Soviet :
Embassy in Mexico other than merely reporting the contact
unless the Station had received a specific request from
an interested U.S. governmen: agency. The IGR's implica-
tion is inaccurate because, is will become apparent in
the following discussion, th: CIA had an understanding

7 with the FBI regarding this :lass of cases and often did

e more that “just report witrout any specific interest
being expressed by any other agency of the United States
government. 499/ In fact, tre station often monitored
and mounted operations against Americans in contact with
Bloc Embassies: 500/ At a minimum they attempted to col-
lect as much information as possible on Americans—in con-
tact with the Embassies. This was routine, it was also
the case with Lee Harvey Oswald

A cable reporting Lee Oswald's contact with the
Soviet Embassy was written and sent to Headquarters by
Ms. Manell on 10/8/63. Various reasons have been ad-
vanced to explain the seven day delay -in sending this

cable. David Phillips explained the delay by saying

* that Mr. Manell.was too busy to be bothered by ‘something

7 f—
; Df Dj) :
of such a routine nature. 516/ PA Lips. Ateted :

Mr. Manellwas a busy man, sometimes pro-
crastinating. His wife was working for

him, and on one or two:occasions I spoke

to Mr. Manel! kiddingly saying, hey, where

is the ‘cable about tris fellow, or something
like that, or maybe to his wife. I am not
sure. In any event, what happened a few
days passed and Mrs. aaney prepared a
message--she was working for her husband,
and as I recall ityste typed it herself,

but I am not positive on that point, but

in any event, she prepared the cable

and took it to Mr. Menel& at which time he
signed off on it. Diring that process, it~
did come to me, also to sign offy” because

it spoke about Cuban matters, and then went S/’7
to the Chief of Station and was released. 5##/

A blind CIA memorandum entitled "Delay in sending
the first cable about Oswalc" was located in a soft file
on the Unidentified Man photograph. This memorandum as-
serts that Dave Phillips ."d'dn't know what he was talking
about." The memorandum's assertion is correct. Mr. Manel

did not sign off on the cab’e reporting Oswald's contact

porary duty assignment in Weshington, D.C., and Miami,

Florida, from at least late September r to October 9,

1963. 522/

The blind memorandum referréd to above regarding
the delay offers another explanation for the seven
day lapse before sending the cable. After explaining

[ ; : that the photoproduction would not have arrived at the
Station until Monday, 7 October, the memorandum says:

A name trace could have been requested on

the basis of the nam: alone but that wasn't

the way Win Scott ran that Station. He

wanted the photographic coverage tied in

with the telephone coverage...sometimes

there was a U.S. automobile license num-—

ber. It was also part of the "numbers

game" of justifying « project by the -num-

ber of dispatches, cibles or reports pro-

duced. 523/

In all likelihood th» delay in sending this ini-
tial cable was due to a compination of factors. Mr. Manell

task ‘and left it to his wif>. Ne Attod. -

argument, but a discussion about, well,
"you do it, I don't want to do it, you

The reason that the responsibility would have
lain with the Soviet Section is obviously because the
American was in contact with the Soviet Embassy. Ms.
Goodpasture also had a potential basis for responsibility
because she was responsible for liaison functions with
the Legal Attache, Army, Navy and Air Force on routine
couter-espionage cases. 527/ She also assisted the
Chief of Station and Deputy Chief of Station on these
cases as they occurred. 528,

a combination of the respon: ibility dispute and the
routine nature of the case is perceived by the CIA-of-

Important or significant information was usually

patch which was sent to Headquarters by diplomatic courier.
Dein Sealer ewylntineds

Cables were sent if tne information was

of such a nature that it had to be acted

on within a day or a day and half. or two

days. Dispatches took so long that you

really could not take any kind of opera-

tional action predicated on dispatch. 530/

Mr. Manell, the Chief of the Soviet Section in
Mexico City recalled that the criterion for a cable as
opposed to a dispatch was the perishability of the informa-
tion being transmittedy ¢

" The normal criterion would be the urgency
r J attached’ to that information, the perish-

ability of the information, not its im-

portance necessarily. The perishability

was the criterion...If it was something

that concerned an event that was going to

happen in the two or three days you did

not want to use a mecium which was going

to take a week to get to Washington. 531/

Hence, it is possible that Oswald's contact was
reported by cable because it was considered significant
by the Mexico Station; but this interpretation is not
supported by the weight of the testimony.

This Committee cannot be certain that other "UA M"s

Ms. Goodpasture was asked about this and explained
that the man, Gutierrez, wes known in the statiom and
that the base house agent vas mistaken in identifying

hard to accept for other reasons. The October 1 transcript

Q:

A:

Goodpasture attempted to explain this mistake.

Looking at the log, can you now ex-
plain to the Committee why the cable
referred to a photograph taken on
October Ist when actually it was taken
on another day?

If you look at the log here you see at
the top--it was just an oversight on

the part of the person who was writing
that cable. It lcoks as though the date
is 1 October, but if you read it very
closely you see there are only two frames
that were shot on 1 October and 2 Octo-
ber, it starts up with fram number 3,

et cetera, et cetera, and there the shots
occur.- That is the only explanation

Is your explanation that whomever: refer-
red to the log sitply looked at the date
at the top of the page, the date being
October Ist, and «lid not see any ‘reference
to the date October 2nd?

would make such an oversight mistake and not discover
it until. 1976. 558/ This Committee thinks that the fact
that the mistaken date of the photograph was not dis-
covered for so'long is especially suspect in light of
the fact that-on the day after the assassination CIA
Headquarters. sent a cable to Mexico which said:

"(FBI) says that photos of man entering

Soviet Embassy which 4EXI sent to Dallas

were not of Oswald. resume MEX] has

double-checked dates )f these photos and

is also checking all .ertinent other
photos for possible siots of Oswald. 559/

Headquarter's preseumption was evidently mistaken. No
record exists that would indicate a reply to this eable
by the Mexico City Station.

The likelihood that a photograph of Oswald was
indeed obtained makes the "explanation," proferred by
Goodpasture, et al., even more implausible. 560/ At
this time the Committee can not conclude why the original
mistake was made even though it does find the explanation
offered by Goodpasture, et at., to be highly. implausable.

Regardless of why the mistake was made, Oswald's:
contact with the Soviet Embassy and the mistaken photo-

a. graphic identification of him were reported to Headquarters.

is detailed in another section of ths final report deal-

‘of the Central Intelligecne \gency. 567/
Ms. Scaleti went to Ms. Egerter and asked to
see Lee Oswald's file which vas provided to her by Ms.
Egerter. 568/- Once the info-mation from the Oswald 201
and the information in the cable from Mexico City was
combined, the Oswald contact took on more significance:

A: As I recall that is what I thought made
it very significant.

Q: Can you explain why?

A: Any American who hid tried to renounce
his U.S. citizenship in the Soviet Union,
now having.again a relationship with
the Soviet Embassy would lead one to
wonder why he had tried to renounce his citi-
zenship in the first place, and why he was
still in contact wth the Soviets, whether
there was a possib’' lity he really was
working for the Soviets or what. 569/

Ms. Egerter remembers that the cable from Mexico

City caused alot of excitement. She was shown the 10/9
cable.
Is this the cable chat cause the excitement?
e@ A: Yes, one of-them.
Q: -Why was excitement caused by this cable?
A: "Contact with Kostikov."

Q: What is the significance of the contact with
Kostikov?

A: I think we considered him a KGB man.
Any other reason for the excitement?
A: He had to be up to something bad to be so an-
xious to go to the Soviet Union. At least
that is:the way I felt. 570/

application at that time had been to
remain in USSR and for temporary exten-
sion of his Tourist visa pending out-
come of.his request. This application,
according to Oswald, contained no ref

to Soviet citizenship. Oswald stated
that he had been enployed since 13

Jan 1960 in Belorussian Radio and TV
Factory in Minsk where worked as metal
worker in research shop. Oswald was mar-
ried on 30 April 1961 to Marina Nikolaevna
Pusakova, a dental technician born July
1941 USSR. No HDGS traces. He attemped

The teltype which Ms:scaleti wrote was sent to
the Department of State, the Federal Bureau of Investi-

gation and the Department of the Navy. 577/ This tele-

type says:

1. On 1 October 1963 a reliable and sensitive
source in Mexico reported that an American
male, who identified himself as Lee Oswald,
contacted the Soviet Embassy in Mexico
City inquiring whether the Embassy had re-
ceived any news concerning a telegram
which had been sent to Washington. The
American was described as approximately 35

: years old, with an atheletic build, about
[ ) six feet tall, with a receding hairline.

2. It is believed thet Oswald.may be identical
to Lee Henry Oswald, born on 18 October
1939 in New Orlears, Lousiana, a former U.S.
Marine who defected te the Soviet Union in
October 1959 and “ater made arrangements
through the United States Embassy in Moscow
to return to the linited States with his Rus-
sian wife; Marina Nikolaevna Pusakova, and
their child.

: : 3. The information in Paragraph One is being
disseminated to your representative in Mexico
City. Any furthe- information received is
being made availa>le to the Immigration and
Naturalization Service. 578/

documents are the dissimilar descriptions of Oswald. The

agencies gave the descripticn that had mistakenly been
connected to Oswald by the “0/9 cable from Mexico City. 579/
Ms. Egerter testified that «he could not explain why the
description discrepancies ocurred. 580/ When Ms. Scaleti
was asked why this occurred she first responded ft
there was a rule that preveited the Agency from dissem-

inating any information obtained from a third agency

of the government. 581/ Hence, the accurate des
of Oswald which. was from information furnished to the
Agency by the State Departnent could not be included in
the dissemination. 582/ It was pointed out to Ms.
Scaleti that the informaticn in the second paragraph of
the teletype was from the ‘tate Department sources and
that the Mexico City Station ‘had been instructed to dis-
seminate the description. Incally which she claimed could
not be disseminated due to a third agency rule. . She
was asked the question again and the following exchange
occurred:
A. Let us start over again. The actual

physical description on Lee Henry Oswald

from (the 10/10 cable) was sent to the

Station to assist them in further investi-

gation to see if they knew of anybody or

had anybody down there that really fitted

description of the Oswald that we had a

to State, FBI and Javy, we did not, and I
would not normally even today, provide
those investigativ: agencies with the
physical description of Lee Henry Oswald
as we thought it t) be then.

We provided them oily with our intelli-
gence, not with Stite Department intelli-
gence which gave tie stuff out about the
audio-and the possible physical descrip-,
tion. The wording here in paragraph 1 on
our teletype...is vorded that. the American
was described. As I told your man from
your Committee earlier, it possibly would
have been better, although it did not occur
to me at the time and this is the way those
things were written in those times, to say
that an American dascribed as this could
possibly be identifiable and qualified
but the normal procedure in 1963 was to
provide to the oth2r government agencies
information and intelligence from our

Q: Were you aware when you sent out the cable

cable on that occasion she sated that. she would not have
taken the description of the .ndividual in paragraph two
to be a description of Oswald. 584/ © The description
discrepancy was specifically pointed out to Ms. Bustos
and she was specifically questioned on that point. The
report of that interview says:

We next pointed out t> Ms. Scaletti the
fact that the respons: to Mexico had a
correct description of Oswald and the dis-

: semination had an incorrect one. She said

that the info in the first paragraph of the

e 7 dissemination came from MEXI 6453 and that,

: explained the incorrect description. We
pointed out to her the fact that she had the
correct description and that had already
told us that she did not associate the de-
scription in 6453 with Oswald, and that she
had said that the cable and teletype had been
prepared simultaneously -by, three knowledgable
people. She said, first, that the correct
description would not have been put in the
dissemination because it came from the file
review. I pointed out that all of the infor-
mation in the second paragraph of the dissemina-
tion was from the file review. She responded
that they had not been sure that the “Lee 0s-
wald" referred to in 6453 was the same as "Lee
Henry Oswald" on whon they had a file, hence
they would not have tad included a description
from 6453 that she did not think was connected
to Oswald. She said that it had obviously

the man who identifies himself as Lee Oswald at
the Embassy in Mexico. 585/

The second point of iiterest that is illustrated
by the 10/10 cable and teletype is the inference that can
be made from reviewing paragraph 3 of the teletype, para-
graph 5 of the cable, and Thomas Karamessines signing
off on the cable, that the CIA was asking for, and pro-
mising, a further investigation of Oswald without a speci-

The request for further investigation and dis-
semination contained in paragraph 5. of the 10/10 cable to
Mexico was the reason that.the cable was sent to the
Assistant Deputy Director of Plans for release. 588/

The Chief of the Mexico Branch was questioned extensively
on this point: +

A: Well, it-went up to Mr. Karamessines be-
cause it involved disseminating information
on an American citizen to the U.S. government
agencies, you see. At that time--probably
still--the CIA dic not investigate or pass
around informatior on American citizens un-
less it were requested to by another govern-

. : ment agency, either in that particular case
or by some standard operating procedure.

@ In other words, tle CIA), seeing an American
abroad, observing an American abroad, observ-
ing an American altroad engaging in some
skullduggery, wou'd inform the responsible
U.S. agency here and sit and wait for instruc-
tions before doiny anything further. In
this case, ‘we were passing on information
to other U.S. government agencies in Mexico
City and this probably went to other places
in Washington. as well.

Q: This particular information was disseminated
to other agencies without a request of any
such.agency. Is chat correct?

A: Yes.

Q: This fit into the other category of cases
where disseminations were made?

A: Disseminations would be made to other interested
aeeee agencies, and any information we came across
fea : had action taken to follow up to take investi- of

gative steps. Dissemination would only be taken
if another agency requested it, either specifically
in that case, or unless it were a part of standard
operating procedure, vhich would have been agreed

upon with another ageicy.

Q: Was any follow-up action contemplated by,(the
10/10) cable?

A: Yes. "Please keep Heidquarters advised of any
further contacts or for positive identification
“of Oswald."

Q: That would be conside-ed follow-up?

A: Yes. They were instricted to stay alert and report
any further evidence >f this man's presence. There-
fore, Mr. Karamessines had to sign off on it.

Q: Mr. Karamessines had to sign off on it because

follow-up action was contemplated?
: With regard to a U.S. citizen abroad. g

Q: For purposes; of clarification, I think you said
that there were two situations where Mr. Karamessines
would have to sign off. One would be where another
agency requested the dissemination?

A: Yes. No--not the question of the dissemination.
It is.a question of o»erational action being taken.

Q: A request for operational action. What is the second
example?

A: Well--

Q: Would the Agency itself decide to take operational
- action?

would not require Mr. Karamessines approval at all.

this individual from another U.S. government
agency or it might come about because of a standard

operating procedure.

For example, we had an agreement with the
FBI that we would follow up leads on any American
Citizen in Mexico City who appeared around the
Soviet Embassies, and.so on, or anybody who was
down there appearing to defect, which we might
learn through our telephone intercepts.

We. could just as well have sent this cable
out without Mr. Karmessines releasing it. I do
not know why we did it. :

Q: In fact, you pcinted to something which I was
going to ask ycu about. I was wondering why
somebody as hich up in the Agency as Mr. Kara-
messines was tte releasing officer.

A: I would have been because of the U.S. citizen
e@ aspect, because so many other U.S. Government
agencies were involved, State Department, FBI
and the Navy. I suppose ‘one of these things
is the Navy. (ine of them could be the Immigra-
tion and Naturilization Service.

Q: Let me attempt to summarize again. ‘Karamessines
would be responsible for signing off on this
because operat onal action pertaining to an
American was taken? :

or an agreement, with the FBI that any activities
by Americans around the Soviet.or Cuban Embassy
would be reported and followed up on by the Agency.
Was that agreement in writing?

A: 1 do not know. It probably was in writing some-
where. It antedated my tenure, and the agreement
was not in the files. It would have been in the
files of the DDP or of the CI Staff. 589/

The Chief of the Mexico Branch hence believes that
further investigation of Oswald was requested by CIA —
Headquarters without the prior expression of interest
from another government agercy with "investigative respon-
sibility." This. request for “operational activity" concern-
ing an American abroad is aivanced as the reason for the
Assistant Deputy Director 0” Plans signing off on the
cable. Even though the cab!e was brought.to Karamessines'
attention and he did sign off on it, Mr. Scelso told this
Committee that that was not necessary due toa standing
agreement with the FBI under which the CIA had agreed to

investigate Americans in Mexico in contact with the Soviet

Embassy without. any specific request from another agency. 590/

This recollection is corroborated by other testimony and

documents.. 591/ Elsie Scaleti also recalled that it would
not have been necessary, in 1963, to bring such a. request
for operational action to the ADDP’s attention. 592/ She

suggested that. the reason for..brjnging it to the ADDP's

attention did not have to do with the request for operational

action, but because Oswald's contact was considered impor-

tant enough to merit his att2ntion:

Q: Why would someone as 1igh up in the organiza-
tion as Karamessines isk to be the releasing
officer of this particular cable?

A: I can only surmise now that I might have thought
or what several of us might have thought at
the time, that since it involved somebody of
this nature who had tried to renounce his citi-
zenship, who was in tne Soviet Union, married
to a Soviet, got out witha Soviet wife pre-
sumably, which is very strange, and now the con-
tact with the Soviets, we could have a security,

. i a major security problem. This was one way of
2 informing him and getting attention at the
e@ : higher level. 593/

Even though the CIA denies stich an agreement (if it
was in writing) that covered the CIA’s investigation of
American citizens in Mexico, this Committee is certain,
on the basis of the above detailed evidence, that such’
an agreement existed, either formally or informally. 594/
Hence, the assertion in the 1977 IG report that "Oswald
was not an investigative responsibility of the CIA" 595/
is seemingly inaccurate and misleading.

This Committee has attempted to determine what
actions, if any, were taken by the CIA's Mexico City Sta-
f} tion after Headquarters responded to the initial report

of Oswald's contacts with tre Soviet Embassy. In this

respect, two assertions of the '77 IGR are important:

1) that it was not discovered that Oswald was seeking a
visa to Russia. and that he hid also been in contact with
the Cuban ‘Embassy until Noveriber 22, 1963; and 2) that
the Station did "nothing other than ask Headquarters

on 15 October for a photograph of Oswald" because no
other government agency had mide an official request for
further information. 596/ ‘t has already been shown
that the “official request" chat the Agency claims was
not forthcoming was, in fact, not necessary and that,

as a matter of fairly routin: operating procedure, the
CIA Headquarters requested’a follow-up on the information
already reported about Oswali. It has also been shown :
that the Oswald matter, afte- the name trace,was done

at Headquarters, was considered to be fairly significant
by the Headquarters officials involved. In this regard,
it should be pointed out that Headquarters communicated
its concern to Mexico by requesting in paragraph 5 of
DIR 74830 more information on Oswald. It should also
be noted that the CIA Headquarters also, by notifying
the interested government agencies that "Any further in-

making an official request for further action. Hence,
‘the excuse offered for the c aimed lack of action by the
Mexico Station is invalid and the question becomes 1) whe-
ther or not that Station did any follow-up; 2) whether
they did discover additional information about Oswald
\ prior to the assassination; 3) whether that information,
if any, was reported in an accurate and expeditious man-
ner; and 4) if it was not. resorted, what was the reason
for the failure to report.
The Mexico City Station received DIR 74830 on
e "41 October 1963. The Mexico City copy of this cable is
in Lee Harvey Oswald's Mexico City "P" file along with
the Station routing slip. There are several interesting
aspects to this copy of the cable and there is evidence
that provides indications of the Stations’ actions and
“the timing of those actions.

There are several marginal notations on this docu+
ment. Perhaps the most interesting is the notation "Sic"
with an arrow drawn to the 'Henry" in the name "Lee Harvey
Oswald." That notation was made by Win Scott when he
read the cable on the day it. was received in Mexico. 598/

Scott knew, at the time the cable was received, that Lee
Oswald's middle name was not “Henry.” David Phillips
was questioned about that possibility:

Q: Do you have any reason to believe that when
this cable was received in October of 1963 Mr.
Scott knew that cable's reference to Lee
Harvey Oswald was incorrect?

A: No, I don't recall that, but reading this ob-
viously at whatever time he wrote that "sic"
on there he felt it was incorrect or he would
not have spotlighted it that way. But I don't
have any recollection. I don't have any re-
collection that we kncwbefore this cable came
back down that. it was Lee Harvey Oswald. 599/

The explanation most oft2n advanced was that Mr.
e@ Scott often used the symbols "Sic" and “aka” interchang-
eably and that all he was indicating here was that the
“Lee Oswald" from tne. taps wis alsoto:be indexed and
filed under the additional nime "Lee Henry Oswald."

interchanged or used interchangeably the words,
the letters "aka" and "sic" interchangeably
as having the sdme meining? Do you appreciate
that? :

A: Yes. 1 don't think s>. He was an intellectual.
His great secret was that he wrote poetry. He

didn't want anyone else to know that. He was
very well educated, extremely well read, and no,
he is not the kind of man--

If Mr. Scott did in fact make this notation prior to
the assassination of John Keinedy, this Committee has not

been able to determine why "sic" was used. 602/

The description of Oswald is marked on this cable with
a double black line, a check mark and the notation "24
years old" in Ann n Goodpastur2 s hand-writing. 603/- At

this point at least Ms. Goodpasture and Alvan White, the

——

DCOS, realized that the photograph they ‘had described

in MEXI 6453 was not of Oswald. 604/ But this realization
was evidently not shared by all the officers in the sta-
tion.: Ms. Goodpasture remembers that there was some con-
troversy in the station about whether the man described
in the 10/11 cable was the same man who had been picked
up by the Station's photographic surveillance. Ms. Good-
pasture remembers that she believed, based on the cable,
that-the photograph reported in MEXI 6453 was not of Os-
wald. She said that she argued over the identification
with Win Scott and that he said, son, that may be incor-
rect “and so forth. But there was some quibbling over

it.” 605/

HQ for photo. No?" Barbara Manell noted that the dis-
semination requested by Paragraph 4 of the cable was
done on 15 October 1963. Win Scott wrote, "Please set
up "P" file on Lee Henry OSWALD and put all data we
have ‘into it. Photos?" 606/ The document was sent to
the files on 15 October 1963. 607/ Hence, we know that
Oswald's Mexico "P" file was opened on or about 15 Octo-

The 10/11 cable greatly increased the significance
of Oswald's contact with the Soviet Embassy in the eyes
of the Mexico City Station just as the name trace results

A: Oh, yes, sure, it did. The fact that he-had that
kind of background. Sure, he became someone. of
considerable operativnal interest. Again, there
was nothing other than operational interest.

Q: In all Lik inood tha: cable would have prompted

A: Yes, I would think so. 610/

This Committee believes that Station personnel did,
between October 11 and October 15, go back and recheck
the transcripts and connect the important substantive
calls to Oswald. Under norial. operating procedures a
tape of Oswald's calls to the Soviet Embassy should not
have been erased until 16 O:tober, 4 to 5 days after :
the case took on added sign ficance. 611/ The one trans-
cript of the call on 10/1/63 that had definitely been
linked to Oswald prior to receipt of the 10/11 cable bore
a reference to an earlier conversation by a man who
spoke broken Russian, the text of the 10/1 call allowed
that the prior call had provably occurred on September 28,
1963. 612/ It should have heen possible at that point
to compare the tapes. to see if they were in fact the same

caller. Indeed, a notation made by Ann Goodpasture on a

newspaper article in 1964 suggests that this was the case.

The notes says:

The caller from the Cuban Embassy was uniden-

tified until HQ sent traces on Oswald and voices

compared by (Tarasoff.) 613/

The cable traffic after the assassination confuses
this point rather than clarifies it. This will be dealt
with in more detail in a subsequent section. An examina-
tion of documents in Lee Harvey Oswald's Mexico City Sta-
tion P file and. the cable traffic from Mexico City to
Headquarters after the assassination, raised-a possibility
that at least one tape of Cswald's voice existed as late
as 16 October 1963. 614/

e Assuming. that the 10/1/63 call in which an individual
identifies himself as "Lee Oswald" was handled in an ex-
 pedited manner, the tape ard the transcript would have
been in the Station by the following day at the latest. 615/
If the tape had been held jor the normal two-week reten-

October. The tape from-the 9/28/63 conversation would

October. An examination of “he documents does not clarify
this question but rather add:; confusion to the issue.

Several documents and calles deal with the tapes and
a voice comparison of the re-:orded conversations. In
Oswald's "P" file there is a newspaper clipping of an
article from the 21 October 1964 Washington Post. The
article, by Robert S.-Allen ind Paul Scott, is entitled
“CIA Withheld Vital Intelligznce from Warren Commission.”
One paragraph from that arti:le says:

The investigators also are trying to determine

why the CIA in its preassassination report to

the State Department on Jswald's trip to Mexico

City gave details only of the defector's visit

to the Russian Embassy and not the Cuban Embassy.

The CIA did not report the latter visit until after

Kennedy's assassination in Dallas
Next to that paragraph Ann Goodpasture wrote:

The caller from the Cuban Embassy was unidenti-

fied until HQ sent traces on Oswald-and voices

compared by (Tarasoff). 617/

That statement is very clear in saying that a voice
comparison was made. The cable traffic that went from
Mexico to CIA- Headquarters after the assassination is

not so clear.

On 23 November, the CIA lleadquarters asked the

Mexico City Station to send “he full transcripts of Os-~

wald's conversations and “or ginal tapes if available”

to Headquarters as soon as possible by a special courier. 618/

On that same day, Ann Goodpa:ture sent a cable to Head-

quarters reporting the 9/28/33 conversation. That cable

said, in part, "Station unable compare voice as first

tape erased prior receipt wé second call." 619/ Later

“that same day Ms. Goodpastu-e wrote another cable which

unlikely that a tape would be held only one or two days,
the situation that is implied by the-statement in MEXI 7023.
The other statements by lis. Goodpasture in the cables

voice comparison was made. 4s. Goodpasture was questioned
about this, *

Q: To your knowledge, was a voice comparison
ever made between the tapes to deterimne
whether the same person was speaking in

Q: That indicates that tre caller--could you please
read that to us. Reai what you wrote that day.

A: “The caller from the uban Embassy was unidenti-
fied until Headquarters sent traces on Oswald."
Now, that would have deen in. answer to the cable
that was dated 8th October. I. believe their cable
was 18 October, “and voices compared by Feinglass."
Feinglass was the pesudonym used by Tarasoff.

Q: In fact, that indicates--

A: He compared the Cuban Embassy voices with the
others, with Oswald's call, in which he used his
name.

Q: When would that have happened?

A:-I said 18 October because I thought that was the
date of the cable. 10 October. 625/

Boris Tarasoff testified that he hed not been queried
at all about Oswald in 1963 and that he had not done a voice
comparison. 626/ Herbert Manell testified that Farasoff
did not do a voice comparison but’ connected the two con-
versations in his marginal comments in the transcripts on
the basis of memory. 627/

Whether or not Mr. Tarasoff or someone else did a
voice comparison of the tapes, it is likely that the tapes
did exist until at least the 16th of October and would
have been available for such a comparison. It is possi-

ble that the connection between the 10/1/63 call and

the 9/28/63 call was made on the basis of Mr. Tarasoff's: en’

memory. In any event the record clearly indicates that
the tapes should have been aviilable,’and probably were
available; as late as 16 Oct »ber 1963. 628/ This is
significant because it was after receipt of the 10/10 ca-
ble from Headquarters that tie Oswalc case took on a

more than routine coloring

The increased significance that the Oswald
visit took on during the period from October 11 to Octo-
ber 16, 1963, could have provided the station with reason
to retain the Oswald tapes. 629/

Q: Are you aware of the fact that, after the as-
sassination, it has been alleged that some ~
tapes were given to tre FBI to listen to and
that it was said that these tapes contained
Oswald's voice on: them:

A: Someone asked me about that, but I do not think
. that I had those tapes. I -do not remember if
I did, and I was not iware that we gave any to
the FBI. I do not know whether Mr. Manell got
tapes from Mr. Taraso'f and passed them to the
FBI, or if the Chief of Station or Deputy passed
anything to the FBI. 1 just do not know. 630/

On the whole most CIA off’ cers who testified stated
that, if a tape of Oswald's voice existed at the time of
the assassination, they did not know anything at all about
it. 631/ One CIA officer, tie Chief of the Branch respon-
sible for Mexico, testified that he believed the tapes
did exist at the time of the assassination:

the transcript and says, "Oswald is identical
with the person in an earlier paragraph who
spoke broken Russian und called on 28 September."

A: Yes. Tapes were probably still in existence. 632/

The Tarasoffs do not rem:mber ever doing, or being
asked to,do, a voice comparison of the. Oswald tapes. 633/
But the evidence, albeit circumstantial, seems to andy
cate that the tapes were in existence and that the voices

were compared by someone: 634/ Herbert Manell suggested

that Tarasoff may have confirmed the fact that the two

“calls were made by the same jerson by memory after re-

voice comparison and/or by ccomparison of the substantive

. Saturday. Was any effort made to check
your materials from the surveillance opera-
tion, the photographic surveillance opera-
tion, or, from the telephonic surveillance
operation to get additional information
on this?

A: I do not know whether I checked it immediately
or not at this stage. I do know that they were
checked thoroughly aiter the assassination. In
fact, I think they were checked thoroughly after
the information came back from Washington iden-
tifying a Lee Oswald. 6377 :

On October 15, 1963, a 'P" file was opened on

Oswald. 638/ That same day the CIA Mexico City Station
requested that Headquarters send them a photograph of

Oswald. 639/ On that date also Ms. Manell drafted a

local dissemination memo reyarding Oswald's contact with
the Soviet Embassy. 640/ By this date at least the 10/1/
10:45 call, the 9/28/11:51 :all, the 9/27/4:05 call,
and-the 9/27/4:26 call had een linked to Oswald. 641/

On 16 October 1963 the nemorandum drafted by Ms.
Manel] was circualted at th2 U. S. Embassy. It said:

1. The following information was received from
a usually reliable and extremely sensitive
source: On 1 October 1963, an American male
contacted the Soviet Embassy and identified
himself as Lee OSWALD. This officer (s.ic)
determined that OSWALD had been at the Soviet
Embassy on 28 September 1963 and had talked
with Valeriy Valdimirivoch KOSTIKOV, a mem-
ber of the Consular Section, in order to learn
if the Soviet Embassy had received a reply
from Washington concerning his request. We

2. Our Headquarters has informed us that the
OSWALD above is probaoly identical with Lee
Henry OSWALD, born on 18 October 1939, in
New Orleans, Louisiani, a former radar opera-
tor in the U. S. Mariie Corps who defected
to the Soviet Union i1 October 1959.

3.. This office will advise you if additional |
information on this mitter is received. 642/

When Ms. Manell was asked why she had stated that it
had been “determined” that Oswald had been in contact
with the Soviet Embassy on 2.3 September she said that
it must have been :because sh: had rechecked the trans-

@ cripts by this time as otherwise she would not have
used such certain language. 543/ When asked why the 10/16
memo said that there was no clarifying information on
Oswald's "request" when it wis known by this time that
he was seeking a visa, Ms. Minell said that "They had no
need to know all those other details” 644/

There are no indications that any other actions were
taken by the Mexico City-Sta:ion prior to the assassina-
tion. 645/

questing a photograph of Oswald from Headquarters. O0-

ther actions included rechecking the transcripts and

discovering the substantive ones that concerned Oswald
and reporting the informaticn in MEXI 6453 and DIR 74830
to various components in the Uiise Embassy in Mexico
City in a misleading manner. Hence, the fact that Qs-
wald was seeking Blvies and had been in contact with
the Cubans as well as the Rissians was known prior to
the assassination, and the ‘.tation's actions prior to
the assassination were more comprehensive than merely
requesting a photograph; alchough if any action other
than a file check was taken, no record of that action
has been’made available to this Committee.

Oswald's activities in Mexico "would have been expected."

Q: Had the information concerning Oswald's visit
to the Cuban Embassy in addition to the Soviet
one, that Oswald had »een requesting a visa,
if it had been sent t> CIA headquarters, would
his case prior-to the assassination have been

“handled in any. differznt manner?

A: It would have been in the case of dissemina-.
tion of information arsout him, but I do not
think that any operational action would have
taken to apprehend hin or to contact him or
to try to force him bick to the United States.

ou)

oe would the diss2mination have been

treated differently?

A: Well, it-simply means that we would have dis-
seminated any additioial information that we
got. 657/ :

e It-cannot be determined vith exactitude whether or
not this additional information about Oswald was reported
to Headquarters. In all lik2lihood it was not. The Chief
of the Mexico Desk was asked whether or not the Station

_ was ever criticized for this. failure to report in the

face of a specific request t» do so by CIA Headquarters.

No. That was not becaus> we were trying to go
easy on them, it is simply because. it is in the
nature of the business. What you are trying to
do is engage, as I used to say, in important il-
legal manipulations of society, secretly.

: We were running, at that time, a vast poli-
tical action program in 4exico City to try to

i¢ x swing Mexico around from its. Leftist direction
eee : to a middle of the. road jirection and it succeeded.

I do not know whether you informed yourself about

the magnitude of our political action program at

the time--absolutely enormous.
We were trying to follow the Soviets and

all the satellites ard the Cubans. At the same

time, the main thrust of the Station's effort

was to attempt to recruit Russians, Cubans and

satellite people. 65t/

Perhaps the nature o7 the CIA Mexico City Station's
handling of the Oswald case prior to the assassination
can best be summed up in Dive Phillips.’ response when
he was asked how he would’ :haracterize that handling:

"At the very best, it is not professional, at. the best." 659/

V. Mexico City Station Reporting of Information Concerning
Oswald After the Assassination

of the Mexico Mystery Man

Even though some pecple in the Station clearly dis-
associated the photograph that was described in MEXI 6453 -
from Oswald after receivirg the 10/11 cable, 656/.it is
clear that some people st‘11 considered it possible for
some reason that the photegraph was of Oswald. In Octo-

ston Scott. 657/ On the Jay of the assassination, the ©

Mr. Scott was not the only person in the Mexico Station

“.who still thought that the photo could possibly be

Oswald. Mr. Manell testified on this pointy?

Q: As of the day of the assassination, you
thought that there was still a possibility
that there was a photograph of Oswald?

A: Indeed. As I recall, we tried to gét that

The photograph was sent to Dallas where Special Agent

a) November 1963. 661/. Mrs. Oswald would later claim
: it was. a photograph of Jack Ruby, 662/ beginning a pericd
of controversy and uncertainty about this photograph that
en has continued to this day. Tne interaction of the Warren
J . Commission and the CIA on this :. question is detailed
"in another section of this resort. On 23 November..Mexico

In any case, it is unlikely that this man had any. con-

several CIA officers in Mexizo. 665/

B. Reporting of information concerning Lee Harvey
Oswald from the electronic intercept operation

aimed at the Soviet Embassy”

The first cable that Mexico sent to Headquarters

after the assassination referred Headquarters to the

r) cable traffic congrning Oswald that had occurred prior
to the assassination. 666/ Headquarters replied that
‘they had also noted the "cornection." 667/

The cable traffic on the day of the assassination,
and the early traffic from the following day, deal al-
most exclusively with the photograph of the person who
later became known as the Mexico Mystery Man. . The
first cable 668/— obviously referred to the October 1
contact and brought it to, H:adquarters' attention by
“referring Headquarters to M:XI 6453. The first cable

: that specifically refers to the transcripts occurred
7 on the following day. Headquarters cabled Mexico that

“since 27 September to locat: all material possibly per-
tinent." 669/ The cable went on to instruct the station
to send the full transcripts and original tapes to Head-
quarters by special courier. 670/ The cable also asks

if the original tapes are still available. 671/

This Committee has not been able to determine how the
CIA Headquarters knew, on 23 November 1963, that a review
of the tap material should begin with the production
from 27 September, the day Oswald first appeared at the
Soviet and Cuban Embassies.’ There is no recrd that
Headquarters had been inforned of the 9/27 visits prior
to. this cable having been sent. It is possible, as some
witnesses have suggested, that his information was provided
to CIA Headquarters by the FBI in Washington. 672/ If
that is the case then it merely shifts the question. This
may indicate that the CIA Headquarters was aware of the
9/27 visits prior to the assassination. An even stronger
inference is, that they were aware of those visits at least
by the day after the assassination. The manner in which
they learned of these visits by that date has not been

determined. It is possible that Headquarters was: informed

by telephone. Even though w'tnesses generally denied

that there was telephone communication between Mexico
City and Headquarters at the time of the assassination,
there is strong evidence thai there was such communica-
tion on at least two instanci:s. 673/

As will become evident, “he transcripts were cabled
to headquarters that same dav. It is not clear why Head-
quarters asked that the tran:cripts and tapes, if they
existed, be sent to Headquar:ers by special courier as_
opposed to cabling the transcripts which would have been
faster. 674/ There is no record that indicates that
these transcripts of Oswald's calls were sent to Head-
quarters by. special courier. ‘

On the 23rd, the Mexico tity Station reported all
of the substantive Oswald coiversations to Headquarters
by cable. Logically, one wold expect that since the
circumstantial. evidence indicates that these conversa-
tions were linked to.Oswald. rior to the assassination,
that they would all have beer reported in one cable, es-
pecially in light of the request from Headquarters in

is strange. 684/ It is possible that these confusions

In addition to the telephone surveillance main-
tained by the CIA Station in cooperation with the Mexi-
can Government, ‘the Station aso maintained some unilateral
surveillance on. the Soviets w:.thout the knowledge or
cooperation of the Mexican ofjicials. The unilateral
surveillance was not directed at the Soviet diplomatic
compound but rather at the pr..vate apartments of Soviet
officials in Mexico City. (Goodpasture Testimony,

245/ After the assassination Hea iquarters asked Mexico City

not to destroy any of the Soviet tapes from this opera-
tion. (DIR 87770, 12/9/63) A note written by Ann Good-
pasture in 1963 seems to confirm Arehart's assumption
that the tapes were retained at the station.

(The Soviet tap operation) people just keep bring-
ing in the reels to me (the ones I give them are not
labeled so they don't necessarily know which ones
return.) The storage problem is one for us and as
the reels come in with transcriptions, I store them.
When we can erase then, I'll take off the labels
and send them back out.

(Note by Ann Goodpasture, 12/10/63, attached to DIR 87770,
12/9/63. Second: parenthetical in original.)

246/.Zambernardi Interview, 6/3/78, p. 5.

247/ Emphasis added. Mr. Arehart was absolutely positive that

Cuban tapes were retainec for thirty days because he
maintained them in the special rack. (Arehart Interview,
6/2/78, p. 3.) Hence, the two week “usual practice" is
probably not correct inscfar as the Cuban tapes are con-

cerned.

319/ Classified HSCA Staff Summary of Review of CIA Documents,
5/12/78, p. 1. On September 27, 1963, at 10:54 a.m.,
the following call occured. . A woman named Silvia
named Guillermo Ruiz. Ruiz tells her that he has not
yet been able to reach the consul and because of vag
he has not called her. Silvia tells him that "we"
have no time for that and asks him for the Consul's
phone number.: Ruiz respords by asking her not to get
annoyed and he wants to know if Silvia wishes to speak
to the Consul personally. Silvia responds that she
does. Ruiz says that the number is 11-28-47. Silvia
says that is. fine and the conversation ends. (CIA
transcript from Cuban Embessy, 9/27/63.) It cannot be
determined whether this céller was indeed Silvia Duran or
if she subsequently callec the Consul since Duran's of-
fice phone was not tapped. The tap was on the telephone
used by Ruiz.

Ibid., and p. 7. Des Fitzg2rald was the Chief of the CIA's

Ibid., p. 7. Mr. Smith explained the "Counter-Intelligence
mentality"by saying that people who had it were "rabid
anti-Communists" (Smith Interview, 11/2/77, p. 3, JFK

e Document No. 003012) and "confirmed believers in the

world Communist conspiracy theory...fhese guys actually
believed that the split between the Russians and Chinese
was a great deceptive operation. Colby (former Director |
of Central Intelligence) even says something more amaz-
iny.. He claims that Angleton absolutely believed that
all CIA operations were run by the KGB, (Soviet Intelli-
gence.) He says Angletor (former Chief of Counter-In-
telligence for the CIA) kelieved that every top Soviet
defector we took in-was a plant. JI think that's incredi-
ble but I know there were some guys on his staff were

his true believers." (Smith Interview, 4/20/78, p. 3,

444/ In considering the above detail2d allegations, it is im-
portant to distinguish betweea the allegation that a
photograph was found at headquarters as opposed to the
assertion that a photograph was found in Mexico City.
It is also important to remember that these allegations
are what can be termed "grapevine stores." There was

( ) a photograph found in Mexico City of a man that was

thought possibly to be Oswalé. This photograph and

the circumstances surroundinc it will be dealt with in

a subsequent section. Ms. Arne Goodpasture of the

Mexico City Station found this photograph. (See below.)

In the absence of any evidence otherwise--Note The

Watson allegation says there was a photo in Mexico City in the

mid-60's; not that it was found there--it is most

likely that the grapevine stories about a photo being

found in Mexico arise from M:. Goodpasture's report-
ing the photo of ¢the man who has since become known as
the Mexico mystery man in the same cable that reported

Oswald's visit to the Soviet Embassy.. (See below.)

The findings of this Committ :e regarding the general

Mexico City surveillance opesations are presented in

Section II, A and B above. [In summary, this Committee

found that there were three ohotographic surveillance

bases (four cameras) that may have photographed Lee

Harvey Oswald in September and October of 1963. This

was determined from analysis of project files for these

operations and the testimony of CIA officials. (See
preceding sections.)

the cable and dispatch traffic between Mexico City and
Headquarters for the period from October 1, 1963 to
26 November 1963 in an attempt to determine whether Os-
wald's photo may have been sent to Headquarters. This
examination also reveale¢ no. evidence that a photograph
of Oswald was sent to CI?. Headquarters. This Committee
did find that there were several types of communications
between Headquarters and field stations that were treated
as non-record- material. Because of the non-record nature
of these communications, it was not possible to review
that material.

-478/ If one assumes that Oswald could not speak any Spanish
then only two conclusions about the first three calls
of 9/27/63 are possible: 1) either these calls do not
pertain to Oswald, or 2) they do pertain to Oswald
but were made by someone Sther than Lee Harvey Oswald.
This second possible conclusion will be addressed in’

a more detailed fashion in subsequent sections due to
its ramifications vis a vis Oswald's activities and pos-
sible associates as opposed to the substance of the in-.
formation available to the CIA Station prior to the
assassination.

02/ Scott's manuscript may provide a clue when he writes that
during his first contact with the Soviet Embassy, Oswald
“gave his name very slowly and distinctly." (Foul. Foe
Manuscript, p- 267.) If Oswald used his middle name at
that time it would explain why Scott wrote "sic." by
"Henry." But it should be noted that Oswald's name

does not come up in any of the transcripts made available
by the CIA until 10/1/62, and Oswald's middle name is

not given in that transcript. It is possible that

there is one additional transcript, possibly of the con-
versation that Scott, or page 267 of his manuscript,
refers to as Oswald's "{irst contact," which, if in exis-
tence, has not been made available to this Committee.

614/ The Chief of the Mexico Branch at Headquarters has told

face this Committee that it is his belief that the tapes were
probably still in existence at the time of the assas-
sination. (HSCA Depositicn of John Scelso, 5/16/78,
p. 76-77.) But the tesitmony of the persons at the
Mexico City Station is.ccnsistent in saying that the
tapes did not-exist at the time of the assassination.

79/ HSCA staff have wondered wrether or not the Mexico City

Station was entirely forthcoming of their own will
with Headquarters. This speculation was based on three
pieces of information. ‘he first is the report in
MEXI 7024 that Headquarters had all the available in-
formation. The second is a note from Win Scott on the
Routing and Record Sheet for MEXI 7033 which says:

I had a call from Washington ( John Scelso) at
1620: hours on 23/XI. I told John Scelso at
1630 hours (our time) on 23/xXI that this would
be on route to him.

The third is a cable reporting that on’ the 23rd Win
Scott had an urgent call to see the President of
Mexico. The cable repori:s that Scott expected the
President to express his condolences over the assas-
sination but "developed hat (Mexican agent) had
located call to Soviet Enbassy of Lee Oswald

made on 28 September. Believe fact that (President
of Mexico) aware of this contact (from our joint
operation) and passed da::a to COS is important."
(MEXI 7023, 11/23/63, paras. 2 and 3)

The Committee declines to speculate that the Mexico City
Station was possibly con:sidering not reporting all

the information availabl:>tothem. It was considered
that this may have been :ontemplated in order to pro-
tect. themselves from a°ciarge about their failure to
report the information pior to the assassination.

1 The discovery that the Mexicans were also aware of
the conversations would have made holding back the
transcripts perilous in that the Mexicans could have
revealed their existence. to the detriment of the
Station. Hence, the full report followed very shortly
after the meeting between the Mexican President and
Win Scott, and immediately after Scott discussed the
situation with his nominal superior in Washington
by telephone. Scott's superior was asked about this.
He said that he did not remember the substance of
his telephone call to Wir Scott on the 23rd. (HSCA
Deposition of John Scelsc, 5/16/78, p. 88) "I do
not have any idea why (I called). I may have been
ordered to call him on ary number of things." (Ibid.,
p- 87.) He was also asked about Scott's meeting
with the Mexican Presidert.

You get a psychologicel question. The Chief
of Station is called in'to speak to the Presi-
i ” dent of Mexico. There had been a big fight
when the new Ambassadcr got there--no, it wasn't
. that. It was a very peculiar situation in Mexi-
e@ a" co whereby the Mexicar. President's primary con-
tact with the U.S. government was through our
Chief of Station rather than through the Ambas-
sadors. ‘This caused 1.0 great problem with the
then-Ambassador whose name I have forgctten. .

Q: Thomas Mann?

p

A: Yes. He was a very fine guy and recognized
the usefulness of this arrangement. The next
Ambassador, Mr. Freveman, tried to cut Win
Scott out of contac:t with. the President of
Mexico, whereupon it:he President of Mexico
called in Win Scoti: and said, "I want you to
send a cable to the White House telling them
I am not going to deal with this jackass,-I
want to deal only vith Meola

g
p

So, the result was. eventually, Winston
Scott and Ambassador Freeman went to the
é White House and talked to President Johnson.

tet of Winston Scott.

So, Scott is just :‘emarking that it is

Win Scott indicated that 1e was going to write a memoran-
dum concerning his meetinj with the President of Mexi-
co. (Routing and Record shhet for MEXI 7028, 11/23/63.)
If Mr. Scott wrote such a memo, it-has not been made

kept in his private safe. (David A. Phillips Interview,

When President John f. Kennedy was assassinated
on November 22, 1963, the \nited States investigative
agencies--FBI, CIA, Secret Service, etc.--were. asked to
“investigate the assassinaticn.. When the Central Intelli-
gence Agency's Mexico City Station remembered that Lee
Harvey Oswald had visited Mexico City during late Septem-
ber and early October, it reviewed the electronic surveil-
lance files and’ found eviderce of phone calls to the So-
viet Embassy made September 27th, September 28th, and
October Ist, that could have been made by Oswald. 685/
Review of the electroic surveillance files also produced
telephone calls on September 27, 1963. between the Russian
Consul and Silvia Duran, a secretary at the Cuban Consu-
late, where Oswald was discussed. 686/ In addition,
the Mexico City Station fourd a.September 28, 1963 phone
call from Silvia Duran to tke Soviet Consulate where: Silvia
Duran stated that there was an American citizen at the

N

Cuban Consulate who had prevfousty visited the Soviet Con-

sutate. 5@7/ A final prone cati was made on October i, 1963

with whom it had a good relitionship--to arrest Silvia
Duran (as S{lvia Duran was 1 Mexican citizen, she did not

have diplomatic immunity) because she might shed some light

on the circumstances surrouiding the assassination. 688a/

d her mother's address, her b-other's address, her license
plate number, her home phon: number, her place of work and
J a request that she be arres:ed immediately. 689/ The Mexi-

rs The Mexico City Station did not receive prior au- :
.thorization from CIA Headquirters to request the arrest of
Silvia Duran by Mexican autlorities. 691/ Headquarters

with John Scelso, Scott called Luis Echevarria and Stated
that the Mexico City Statioi desired that. all: information
received from Duran be forwirded immediately to the Mexico
City Station, and that her arrest and statements not. be

On November 27, 1963, the Mexican government for-
warded to the Mexico City Station a copy of Silvia Duran's
ten-page signed statement. 396/ It said,

"Upon learning about the assassination

she and her husband speculated that Presi-

dent Kennedy might have been assassinated

for racial reasons. When she became aware

that the assassin was Lee Harvey Oswald, she
ascertained that it was the same man who ap-
proximately two montis prior. had been to the
Cuban Consulate to solicit an intransit visa

to Russia. Having taken his name from the
special documentatio1 he presented she knew
that he was married to a Russian woman and
betonged to the "Fair. Play for Cuba Committee.”
rs: She checked the data in the Consulate archives
and became certain tiat it was the same indi-
vidual who was blond, short, dressed unelegant-
Jy and whose face turned red when angry. The
Consul had denied th: visa because to obtain

an intransit visa from the Cuban government,

it was imperative that he previously obtain a

Cuban Consulate and ‘Silvia Duran confirmed

that he could get a Uuban visa only after he
received a Russian v sa. She gave Oswald her name
and business phone number but never gave him her :
address because she liad no reason to give it to

him. The only aid she could give Oswald was advising
that he see the Soviet Consul and calling the person
in charge of that of’ice. She knew that phoning the
Soviet Consulate was not one of her duties and that
if she did so she dil it only to help Oswald. She
gave Oswald her busiiess phone number only because he
would have to-call subsequently to check whether he
had obtained a visa. He never called back."

Silvia Duran, released on November 24, 1963, was rearrested

November 27, 1963, when the Mexican government alleged that she

According to-the Mexican of“icials who detained Duran a second
time, there was no addition to her story. 699/

The Mexico City Stat:on forwarded Duran's ten-page signed

statement to Headquarters 01 November 27, 1963. 700/ The
following day, Headquarters sent a clarification cable to the

Mexico City Station seeking to insure that neither Silvia

Select Committee on Assassinations the following:

tee Harvey Oswald visited the Cuban Consulate three
times.on September 27, 1963, not twice as the Warren Com-
mission previously reported. 712/ - Oswald first visited
the Cuban Consulate at approximately 11:00 a.m., requesting
an intransit visa to Cuba with Russia as the final destina-
tion. 713/ He showed her some documents, then left to
obtain Photographs needed for his application. n4/

Oswald returned at approximately 1:00 p.m. with
four photographs. 715/ Ms. Tirado typed the application
in duplicate, stapled a picture. on top of each and had Os-
Wald sign each in her presence. 716/ As identification,
Oswald showed her documents he had brought: his Russian
labor card, marriage certificate with the name of his
Russian wife, his American communist Party membership card
and his "Fair Play for Cuba‘ membership card. ny

Ms..Tirado found Lee Harvey Oswald's behavior sSuspi-
cious because normally a Conmunist traveled only with his

b. The possibility that Silvia Duran was an -
agent for either American, Mexican or Cuban

Intelligence

Since the publication of the Warren Commission
Report in September 1964, critics have written about the
‘ possibility that Silvia Duran was an intelligence agent
for either the Americans, Mzxicans or Cubans
1) Was Silvia Duran an agent, asset or source

for Mexican or Am2rican intelligence?

In an effort to resolve this question, the House
Select Committee on Assassiiations reviewed the United
States investigative agenci2s' files on Silvia Duran. 752/
The Committee found no evid:nce in this file review that
Silvia Duran was either an American or Mexican intelli-
gence agent.

In addition, the Comaittee has interviewed most
of the Mexico City Station :mployees about the possibility.
Only David Phillips, Chief uf Covert Action and the Cuban

Section in the Mexico City itation in 1963, a position

which made him very knowledieabie, considered that Buran

i

was possibly an agent or source. Mr. Phillips stated that

he had first heard Duran's iame from the telephone

that the CIA had no interest in Ms. Duran because "she
wasn't friendly with anyone.” 756/ Mr. Phillips had
previously mentioned the CIA Mexico City Station's in-
terest in recruiting a form2r Cuban Ambassador to Mexico
named Lechuga. 757/ Mr. Phillips was shown a memorandum
written by W. David Slawson of the Warren Commission staff
regarding a trip to Mexico sy Warren Commission staff

members which said:

Mr. Scott's (Chief of the CIA Station in Mexi-
co City) narrative disclosed that the CIA's
action immediately after the assassination con-
sisted basically of alerting all its confiden-
tial sources of information throughout Mexico
to immediately channel all information into
their headquarters, and of compiling as.com-
plete dossiers as possible on Oswald and every-
one else throughout Mexico who at that time

the CIA knew had had some contact with Oswald...
This meant especially Silvia Ouran, who because
she had previously been having an affair with

Lechuoa, the former Cuban Ambassador to Mexico
and presently the Cuban representative at the
Ynited Nations, had previously been of substan-
tial interest to the CIA... 7587

that. "No one iat me in on this operation.” 759/ But

Mr. Phillips added that he doubted that Duran would

have: been pitched because the Station could not identify

any of her weaknesses. The Committee staff members then |

told Mr. Phillips about the reporting on file concerning

Ms. Duran from one of the Station's penetration agents,

LITAMIL/9, at the Cuban Embassy. At one point LITAMIL/9 |

had reported to his case officer that all that would

have to be done to recruit Ms. Duran was to get a blonde, {

blue-eyed American in bed with her: 761/ With this, Mr.

Phillips said that it did indeed sound as if the Station j

had targeted Ms. Duran for recruitment, that the Station's

interest had been substantial, and that the weaknesses

and means had been identified. 762/ Mr. Phillips

pointed out, however, that because Duran had been targeted

did not necessarily mean that she had been pitched. 763/ {

In addition, he stated that he had never heard that Ouran |

had been pitched. 764/ f
Mr. Phillips did state that he. would expect that

Ms. Duran's file at the CIA would be “very thick" because

of all the telephone intercepts that concerned her and f

the substantial interest that the Station had in her. 765/

He stated that much of the naterial in her file should

predate the assassination. 765/ Mr. Phillips stated that

Ms. Duran's Mexican "pa 769/ (personality) file available
for review. The CIA informed the Committee that there
was no "P® file available on Ms. Duran. 770/

Another CIA employee, Dan Neiscuir; who worked on
an "Oswald Task Force" in late September or early October
of 1975 dealing with Freedom of Information Act law suits
brought against the Agency concerning the files on Lee
Harvey Oswald, stated that he believed that Ms. Duran may.
have been a source of information for either the CIA or
the Mexicans. 771/ Mr. Neiscuir could not recall why he
specifically had this recollection, but thought that it
was due to. something he hac seen in Oswald's file. 772/
He said that it may -have been the Agency's attempts to
Protect Ms. Duran after the assassination and the heavy
cable traffic that those attempts generated that led him

Mr. Neiscuir's hazy recollections, nO cannot
definitely resolve whether Silvia Duran was a Mexican or

American intelligence agent or source.
(2) was Silvia Duran a Cuban intelligence agent?

In an effort to resolve this question, the HSCA
reviewed the United States investigative agencies’ files
on Silvia Duran. 774/ The committee found no evidence in
the files that would indicate that Ms. Duran was associated
with Cuban intelligence.

In addition, the HSC4 interviewed most of the Mexi-
co City Station employees arout the possibility that Duran
worked for Cuban intelligence. Only Barney Hidalgo, a
CIA officer who travelled t» Mexico City in 1963, considered
the possibility to be likely. 775/ Mr. Hidalgo, professing
not to remember all the details, stated that he. thought
that Duran was a Cuban intelligence agent. 776/ Hidalgo
said:

In 1967, Oscar Contreras Lartigue reportedithat he met
d Lee Harvey Oswald on the can pus of the National Autono-
mous University of Mexico. 1061/
6 In addition, the testimony of ‘the Warren Commission's
primary witness related to Mexico City, Silvia Tirado
Duran, has been called into question by the critics

- were the-only times she saw him--was available at the
time of the Warren Commissicn's inquiry although it was
ignored. 1663/ Some of the information has developed
after the publication of the Warren Report. 1064/

The Garro and Contreras allegations, in conjunction
with the inconsistencies of Ms. Duran's story raise three ma-
jor questioss: (1) did Lee Harvey Oswaid or an imposter
visit the Cuden Consulate ir Kexico City?; (2) other
than nis visits to the Cuba: Consulate,.what were Lee Har-

wald was not traveling alon2, did one of his companions
impersonate him at the Cubay Consulate? Nonetheless,

each of the three questions will be dealt with in separate
sections below.

In an attempt to ansver these questions the House

Select Committee on Assassinations has: 1) interviewed
Mexican 1065/ and Cuban ci:izens 1066/ who could. have
knowledge of Oswald's visit: to the Cuban Consulate;

2) interviewed Mexican citi.:ens 1067/ who could have know-

City; 3) conducted an extensive review of the files of
the Central Intelligence Agency and the Federal Bureau
of Investigation that perta n to Oswald's sojourn in
Mexico City. 1068/

Oswald signéd the application in her presence. 1071/ Os-

Embassies. : :

An analysis of the t2lephone.conversations which
the CIA's Mexico City Station intercepted by tapping the

Phone reveals that someone, later identified by the CIA as Oswald,

On September 28, 1963, at 11:51 a.m. Silvia Duran
called the Soviet Consulate. 1079/ She put the American,

American, who was at the Cusan Consulate at the time,

said that he had just been at the Soviet Consulate. 1081/

The conversation ended with the American stating that he
was returning to the Soviet Consulate. 1082/

Analysis of Silvia Duran's and Eusebio Azcue's
testimony would tend to indicate that Oswald, or someone
impersonating him, visited the Cuban Consulate at least
one and possibly two additional times on September 27,
1963. Silvia Duran Says that Oswald first visited the
Cuban Consulate at approximitely 11:00 a.m. requesting
an intransit visa to Cuba with Russia ‘as the final de-
Stination. 1083/ Ms. Dura. sent Oswald to obtain photo-

The Committee believes that there is a possibility that
the argument between Azcue and the individual occurred
during this visit. 1088/

Ms. Duran stated thas Oswald's third and last
visit occurred in the late ifternoon after. working hours
on the 27th. 1089/ This visit is confirmed by the CIA's

the HSCA believes that they do fit logically into a time
sequence created by what is known from testimony and the
electronic intercepts about his actions on that day.

For example, the following is a reasonable possible
chronology of Oswald's actions on 9/27/63 based on analy-

in Mexico around 10:00 a.m. on September 27. 1113/ By

C. What were Lee Harvey Oswald's Activities in
Mexico City?

When the Warren Commission wrote about Lee Harvey
Oswald's activities in Mexico City, it concluded:

The Commission undertook an intensive investi-
gation to determine Oswald's Purpose and.acti-
vities on this Journey, with specific reference

to reports that Oswald was an agent of the Cuban

or Soviet Governments. As a result of its investi-
gation, the Commission betieves that it has been
able to reconstruct and explain most of Oswald's
actions during this time.

It is entirely possible that Oswald did spend some of
his time during this weekend sightseeing and making

his travel arrangements. It is also entirely possible
that, after his failure to obtain his visas on Saturday,
September 28, that Oswald did not give up completely
and did attend a party where he would have come into
contact with the Cuban Consular officials and, later,
sought help from pro-Castro students.

"It is entirely possible that Ruben Duran had a
“twist party" on September 30, or October 1 1138/ as
Elena Garro has claimed. Ruben, Horacio, Lydia and Silvia
Duran all admitted that they frequently had twist par-
ties in 1963. 1139/ Only Silvia Duran recalled Elena
Garro attending any of the "twist parties" at the Durans'
home. 1140/ She recalled Elena and Elena's daughter,
Elenita, attending one twist party at Ruben's home in

Procedure for conduct of the interviews was also dis-

cussed at this meeting.

The Mexican governmert decided that the initial
interview would be an informal contact with the witnesses
in which the Committee's oljectives would be described.
The witnesses’ statements vould be formalized at a later,
taped. interview. The Mexican officials informed the
HSCA staff members-that they had been unable to locate
Oscar Contreras, 1193/ Elona Garro de Paz, and Elenita
Garro de Paz. 1194/ The Mexican Government had not had
contact with. the Garros since 1968. The Mexicans said
that they were trying to Incate the Garros through
the Foreign Ministry since Elena's ex-husband, Octavio
Paz, had once been an impo-tant person in that ministry.

Mexican Government contact during 1964 with the Warren

arrested on political charces but that he was subse-

The Mexican official: also offered their obser-

the previous day. They po‘nted out that they found it
strange that Silvia had to'd Oswald he could not travel
while in Cuba. They wondered what Duran was trying to
tell Oswald and whether she thought that Oswald had
some objective in going to Cuba other than that ascribed
by the popular version. They also considered the manner
in which Silvia obtained erptoyment at the Cuban Consu-

late unusual. Generally they noted that Silvia and

“her brothers seemed to have almost programmed responses

Elena Garro de Paz wis born of Spanish parents in

Puebla, Mexico on December 11, 1917. (All information in

‘this section culled. from Biography Data form prepared by

Charles Thomas.) Ms. Garr» attended the National Autonomous
University of Mexico and liter did. graduate work at Berkley
in California and at the Uiiversity of Paris. In 1963,
Elena had long been married to Octavio Paz, a career
diplomat who is also one of Mexico's finest poets and leading
intellectuals. When Octavio was named Mexican Ambassador
to India, the couple separated by mutual consent. Elena's
daughter, also named Elena, has always resided with her
mother.

Since Elena spent seventeen years of her early life
in Europe she had a ratner un-Mexican objectivity about her
Native land and had a reputation for being one of its more
articulate detractors. At the same time, Elena was considered
emotionally committed to many aspects of Mexican life and

made an important contribution to its artistic deveiooment

Ms. Garro's short stories ure collected in a volume called
La Semana-de Colores. The Literacy Supplement of the London
Times has called her novel, Los Recuerdos de Porenir,."a~
splendid success." Critic: have said of her: "For Elena
Garro, there 1s no frontie: between reality and fantasy;
in any case, the latter is a second reality--perhaps more
e intense--to which one may penetrate without passport or
forewarning, thanks to the effectiveness of a literature
fired with passion, flavor and life." Many people who
knew Elena have asserted that the frontier between reality

and fantasy is also difficult for her to distinguish in

Elena was considered a witty, urbane and opinionated
