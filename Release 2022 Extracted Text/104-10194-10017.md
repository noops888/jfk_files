SECTION C/Continued : NARRATIVE COMMENTS:

. For“dpproximately four months during 1967, Mr, Vitale
worked with me in providing Headquarters’ support to JMWAVE
in its conduct of,special operations into PBRUEN. In such
a role, Mr. Vitale's knowledge of thé history, mechanics, :
requirements and PBRUMEN personnel of these operations was
invaluable in (1) ‘the preparation of operational proposals
for. the 303 Committee, (2) the provision of timely operational
information periodically requested by the front offices of

= both WH/COG and WHD, and (3) the briefing of WOFIRM personnel

newly assigtied to JMWAVE to assist in these operations, While
under my supervision, Mr. Vitale was a conscientious, loyal,
cooperative employee who readily and willingly performed ali
tasks assigned to him in an. exceptional manner, He always
expressed his willingness to work as many hours as necessary
to finish. the task at hand. He has a-very pleasant person-
ality, gets along well with his fellow workers and exhibits

a good sense of cost consciousness in the use of government

“equipment and materials, The rating letter "S" most accurately

reflects the level of performance of Mr. Vitale during the

period he was under my supervision,

EOUMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL

Ag noted in tho last Fitness Report, I concur generally in the
supervisor's ratings of Mr. Vitale's performance as listed; but T
must again note that these are ‘duties which could be performed by a
moro junior clerical type and that Mr, Vitale should not be considered
as performing GS-8 level Intelligence Assistant work at a Proficient
rating. . Indeed, he is, in my opinion, not qualified for such a ro-e
and his official position title should be changed to prevent iny
misunderstanding as to the somewhat unique nature of his value to

the Agency.

. sv Mr. Vitale since, he. was assigned to Chen ly on a part-°*
time basis and. later as a full time assistant Me performed
adequately as an. input analyst in additdon to his proficient
work.as-a Records Officer and General support assistant. The
quality of his. input has been good and his production has helped
considerably in cutting down the size of the input backlog.

Mr. Vitale also continues to perform the Records Officers
function for the branch with a sound knowledge of general records
procedures, His attitude and attendance record continue to
reflect a. willingness to assist the branch in whatever way
necessary. In addition Mr. Vitale's valuable background
knowledge on a former vital portion of the branch's effort
continues to be utilized tc a considerable extent. He gets
along well with his colleagues and contributes to the smooth
running of the office.

< “Mr, Vitale is presently within 2 years of retirement’ or

4 years, if he does not receive an overseas assignment. He has
told the career panel, he would accept an overseas assignment

to either Vietnam or Laos. In view of his experience with
paramilitary operations, it is felt this would be a more fitting
assignment for him than the present one, even though he has been
performing quite satisfactorily.

SECTION C/Continued NARRATIVE ‘COMMENTS

For approximately four. months during 1967, Mr. Vitale
worked with me in providing Headquarters’ support to JMWAVE

sin its conduct.of special operations into PBRUMEN. In such

a-role,; Mr: -Vitale's knowledge of the history, mechanies,—-
requirements and PBRUMEN personnel of these operations was
invaluable in (1) --thé preparation of operational proposals

for the 303 Committee, (2) the provision of timely operational
information, periodicaily requested by the front. offices of
both WH/COG and WHD, and (3) the briefing of WOFIRM personne)
newly assigned to JMWAVE-to assist in these operations. While
under my supervision, Mr. Vitale was a conscientious, loyal,
cooperative employee who readily and willingly performed all
tasks assigned to him in an exceptional manner, He always
expressed his willingness to work as many hours as’ necessary

to finish the task at-hand. He has a very pleasant person-
ality, gets along well with his fellow workers and exhibits

a good sense of ‘cost consciousness in the use of government
equipment and materials. . The rating letter "Ss" most accurately
reflects the level of performance of Mr. Vitale during the

period he was under my supervision.

COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL

As noted in the last Fitness Report, I concur generally in the
supervisor's ratings of Mr. Vitale's performance as listed; but I
must again note that. these .are ‘duties which could be performed by.a
moro junior clerical type and ‘that Mr. VitaJe should not be considered
as performing GS-& level Intelligence Assistant work at a Proficient
rating. Indeed, he is, in my opinion, not qualified for such, a rote

ret his official position title should be changed to prevent wy

misunderstanding as to the somewhat unique nature of his value.to

I have. had opportunity to observe subject's performance closely

for nine months and while I generally concur in his supervisor's ratings
of the duties as listed, it should be noted that those sind duties could
be performed equally well by a nore junior intel Clerk or Intel Assistant
and. therefore, the overal) rating as a GS-8 Intel Assistant does not
stedrately refiect his capability. In my opinion it would be very diffi-
cult, if not impossible, for subject to perform competitively with other
fntel Assistants at a GS<8 level, and I recommend his position title be
Changed to Ops Support Assistant, a role in which he performs capably.

Mr. Vitale continues to be a most. loyal, cooperative and willins
worker, getting along well with all. hands. His waturicy and esny
years of expericnce in his field, in addition. to his great general
knowledge, make him a wost valued cmployee when compared to
colleagues of similar rank. It is because of this that I have
again rated Mr. Vitale very high. Although Mr. Vitale has no
supervisory responsibilities and fully realizing his Limited
potential as a senior operations officer, I feel he is still
undergraded and should be promoted to the next higher grade

at the earliest opportunity. Because Mr, Vitale’ job and
performance have remained almost exactly the same as during the
previous year, this fitness report is also very similar.

Mi. Vitale continues to do an exceptional Job in assisting
his office on a most complex project. His longevity on the
project, coupled with his: continued objectivity, makes hig
sérvices increasingly valuable. ‘this is in contrast to many

of his colleagues who have transferred because of the many
extreme demands and frustrations caused by this extraordinary
project. Mr, Vitale continues to be a most loyal, cooperative
and willing worker, “getting along well with all hands. His
maturity and many years of experience in his field, in addition
to his great general knowledge, make him a most valued employee
when compared to colleagues of similar rank.. It is because of
this that I ‘have again rated Mr. Vitale very high. In addition,
and fully realizing his limited potential as a senior operations
officer, I-feel he is still undergraded and should be Promoted
to the next higher grade at the earliest opportunity.

Subject continues to do an exceptional Fob va assisting his office in
the formulattor-of reports and plans by his research and ability to
quickly make name traces and ferret out information froa the various

agency sources,

During the past year subject hes continucd to be a most cooperative,
loyal and willing worker-om a project that due to its nature is more
frustrating, and demands wore with less apparent return than most
projects, As on his previous fitness report, I have rated him very cy
high, primarily due to the fact that hetscmetere and ‘many years ex-
perience with the Agency have made him of much more immediate value

than most o€ his collexgues in the G5 7-9 level. Consequently, although
he has made’ G3-8 within the past ycar, I feel he is still undergraded
and should be promoted to Gs-9. at the carliest opportunity.

While not wishing to detract fromthe value of subject's duties
or from the manner in which he performs them, I do have strong doubts
as to whether the nature of his duties warrant promotion to GS-9 even
if they were performed in an outstanding manner. During the next year
additional duties of a more demanding nature will be placed on subject
and I will want to weigh his performance under those circumstances - -

‘before recommending promotion.

out assigned tasks to the best of his ability.
