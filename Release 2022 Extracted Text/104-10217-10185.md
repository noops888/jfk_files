i tena

1. AMDELL-1 spoke with pmrazze2 on two separate occasions and
qonieecaa? the following information with the dates and sources as
ated

2. AMRAZZ=-1 spoke on 31 January 1965 with Sergio (LNU) who had
Just reached Miami from the Dominicon Republic. Sergio stated that
GUTIERREZ had gone to Cuba with three other men on 20 December 1964,
landing near Baracoa, Oriente. The only members in this first infile -
tration wore those arrested. GUTIERREZ had promised to contact his
base by radio on 31 December 1964, but no message was ever received,
Plans called for another group of about seven men to infiltrate into
Caba at Baracoa on or before 40 January 1565, The group left the
Dominican Republic on 20 January according to plan. Kear the Cuban
coast, they were pursued by three Cuban patrol boats and one airplans
but managed to escape. The boat used in both infiltration attempts
Was called the “Botrand" which may moan a Bortram boat.

1965 to Reynaldo ABREU in charge of GUTIZBREZ' affairs in Miami who
an turn had spoken to Celio VAZQUEZ, GUTIERREZ’ main contact in the
Dominican Republic by telephone on 30 January 1965. VAZCUEZ stated
he could not come to Miami at that time as he was taking charge of
@ismantiiog the base there. He also needed about $10,000.00 to clear
up back bills owed by the group. However, on 3 February 1965, AMDELI-1

members of GUTIERREZ’ group in tho Dominican Republic intended to go
ahead with the plan to infiltrate Cuba. To his knowledge a leader had
