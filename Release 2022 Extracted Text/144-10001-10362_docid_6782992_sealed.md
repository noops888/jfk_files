5. In short, that was the speech, =

The interesting thing is that while the Soviet Union
omly answered these accusations with an article in the
newspaper and expréssed their sorrow in a meaningful manner
by sending Deputy Prime Minister MIKOYAN to Washington, CASTRO
considered it necessary to answer the accusations of the U.S.
press officially as Prime Minister in a speech at a time when
friends and enemies of the U.S. generally were: expressing their
xespect for KENNEDY, Also-interesting is the fact that he not
only defended Cuba but the Sqviet Union as well.
