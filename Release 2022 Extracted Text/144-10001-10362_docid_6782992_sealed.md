For: First Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs.

No. 29.

1. In connection with the accusations in the U,S. press

that OSWALD, accused of assassinating KENNEDY, was a pro-CASTRO

communist, Prime Minister CASTRO spoke before Cuban television,

a summary of which follows.

2.

Cuba is remorseful and has gained no advantage by the

assassination of KENNEDY.

3. The accusations of the U,S. press have no foundations

Whatsoever, and are only the activities of the ultra reactionary

group in the U.S. whose intentions are to depreciate the names

of Cuba and the Soviet Union.

4. CASTRO thinks that JOHNSON will not be as strong as

KENNEDY since he,was not elected president by! the peaple directly.

He will not be as influential as KENNEDY in damning up the

strength of the ultra reactionaries in the U.S. who pursue

policies which'are extremely hostile and very dangerous to the

Soviet Union and Cuba.

5. In short, that was the speech,

The interesting thing is that while the Soviet Urtion

only

answered these accusations with an article in the

newspaper and expressed their sorrow in a meaningful manner

by sending Deputy Prime Minister MIKOYAN to Washington, CASTRO

considered it necessary, to answer the accusations of the U.s.

press officially as Prime Minister in a speech at a time when

friends and enemies of the U.S. generally were expressing their

respect for KENNEDY. Also interesting is the fact that he not

only defended Cuba but the Soviet Union as well.
