Mr. Noel is an old hand at running. Bases on Ve ons

abroad and his performance as Chicf of Bas@,. San Francisco,
amply attests that. It goes without. saying that,he understands
all @spocts of the business, knows how to delegate, organize,
direct and report, He has continucd to do all these things
well, Hig seniority, .experience and maturity served the Agency
in particularly good stcad during this period when the location
of his Base was compromised in the public press, through no
fault.of Mr, Noel, His subsoquent and consequent..actions wore :
all taken with sound judgmont. and appropriate calm and circum- |
speetion., He was also most receptive to, and cooperative in,
Headquarters suggestions in-this matter, He is, of course, cost
conscious and an oxeellont supervisor. His overall performance
is that of a high.order of senior Agency officers. . i

the possibility.of his converting from staffer to career agent.
After considerable discussion, Jim agreed to the conversion. He
is obviously doing this reluctantly, but he appreciates the gituation
within the DDP in which the encumbrance of senior grades by longe
time employees is blocking the promotions of junior officers.

2. Jim urged that he be reta
he reaches the age of mandatory retirement (about three years).

Chief, DO stated that the need for handlers
of contacts and assets is such that there would be a continuing need

for experienced career agents
1 told Jim that unless he pulled something stupid,

he was virtually assured of career agent status until he reached
age 60, and perhaps could be employed as a retired annuitant after
that time if hie performance was productive and if operational

requirements remain as they are at present.

3. Jim explained why he could not retire <= the next five
yeare will be difficult for him financially with two teen-age boys to
put through college.

‘ 1, This memorandum contains in paragraph 2 a recom
mendation for the approval of the Director of Personnel.

2. Mr, Bool arrived in Madrid as the Chief of
Station on 21 September 1961. After home leave, he
returned to Madrid on 7 August 1964, for a second tour
of duty which would normally be completed on 6 August
1966, Wo have been advised that upon completion of his
current assignment, Ur, Noel will be assigned as Chief
of the DODS field office in San Prancisco, California.
Since the officer now filling that position is required
to leave in early September for another assignment, it
is very desirable that Mr, Noel arrive in San Francisco
about 6 September, Therefore, it is requested that
Mr. Noel be permitted to leave Madrid on or about 1 July
1966. This will permit him to take some home leave and~
arrive at his new post in sufficient time to settle his
family, which includes two school age children, and
report for his projectod aesignment on schedule,
