ACTION REQUIRED:

I, INTRODUCTION

A. Bubject! Specific assignments have been delimited for the past
two years by several considerations beyond his control: :

1. Prior to the Bay of Pige, Subject was used as a principal
agent in exile operations which were semi~covert at best, In the proces:
he was thoroughly blown as a KUBARK agent, =

2. After the Bay of Pigs, those Cuban exiles who blamed the U~.8B..
Government for-the defeat found Subject an easy targetof their wrath,
Subject stcunchly defended the U.S, ection (or lack of action), and
thereby won himself a number of bitter enemies among the exiles,

3. As.an outgrowth of points 1 and 2 above, Bubject's atatenenta i
and opinions on the situation in.Cuba, or.on the Worth of individuals or
grou; in exile, were either mistake: Yy. considered to be “official leaks,

or else were Jaliberately exaggerated and twisted. in going around the
exile comminity,

B, To remedy this situation, Subject's cover as a prizefight
manager was strengthened by more actual participation in the activities i
of his boxer, and supplemented by a backstopped cover firn which pure :
portedly used his services a translator and consultant, Instead of

B, He is not deft at elicitation, and he seems to be aware of this
shortcoming, He prefers the straight interview which he reports fully
and accurately, and then adds footnotes with his comments,

D. He is also a tireless leg man when tracking down an odd bit of
information, and he has shown a good amount of personal courage in
dealing with chara:ters known for violence,

E, On the deficit side, it should be noted that having been s0
closely involved, Subject is not without strong opinions on many of the

matters he reworts, and finds it difficult to be completely objective
in his choice of words, Ef
