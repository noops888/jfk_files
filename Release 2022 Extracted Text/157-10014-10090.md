STATEMENT OF BRONSON TWEEDY
Ms. Pitts. Would you please state your name and address
for the record?
Mr. Tweedy. Bronson Tweedy, 6412 Garnett Drive, Chevy
Chase, Maryland, 20015.

Ms. Pitts. Starting as early as 1959 apparently the first

|
related mission directive for a Leopoldville station was Hy

written, And the jurisdiction of the station covered a lot i

more territory than just what was known as the Belgian Conge-

: : : faedas
And I am wondering if you remember at what point the juri i

diction of Leopoldville Station became restricted?

Mr. Tweedy. I think probably pasically as we got coverage

. sy
in the other areas, I imagine Brazzaville, probably, which
was of course the French Congo, was in that. We probably had

a sort of a watching brief for Angola, but it really didn't

go much beyond that in those days. We may have had a watching

brief for the Central African Republic, but I can assure you

the Central African Republic was very little more than a
geographical expression then. \
We already had people, as I remember, in Salisbury~ And

it certainly didn't cover South Africa. I imagine that is

it covered. It may have covered Cameroons.
|

|

Ms. Pitts. And it covered Luanda? |

Mr. Tweedy. Luanda, of course, is Angola. Yes. But f

think that is it.

Mr. Tweedy. To complete the answer, that is there sort of |
(

for the record, but no one really expected the Chief of Station

in Leopoldville would really be able as a practical matter to

do very much about the other areas, nor at that stage was it i
really that important. But this was sort of an administrative

device to try to keep the continent covered, is all.

Ms. Pitts. So the related mission directive which was a

i i i and i
directive which concentrated on intelligence collection

trying to develop a field for if there was Communist influence

and that kind of thing would have just been a very general

kind of direction, wouldn't it?

Mr. ‘Tweedy. What we were doing at that point is, we
were developing our knowledge of Africa in the first instance.
The Agency's representation in sub-Sahara and Africa had been

very limited. And for the first time we, and I as the

Division Chief, was faced with the problem of building a
division, staffing as many stations as seemed sensible, and
getting our feet on the ground in Africa, learning how to |
operate in Africa, And those aspects obviously had to be

{
stated in terms of targets and priorities and the rest of it. {
|
If you want to look back on it realistically, what in effect

we were saying was, get yourself at home in Africa and then

come back here.

Combe back in about a year and tell us where you are.

| and that is what we did. In about a year we began to have |
om a feel for the area. And in the process we were reporting. |
3 | And a lot of the reporting was the sort of thing which was
ig H giving us background. It wasn't that the President was
7 hanging on our every word. That really wasn't the state of tnd
: art. But we had to learn what it was all about, how the |
7 | Africans ran their own affairs, what were they like. One
8 | thing you couldn't do was generalize about Africa. If you were
9 in Kenya it was Kenya, and in Angola, it was angola, and never |

i ¥ learn,
10 the twain shall meet. Those were the things we had to le

il and we could only learn by doing it the hard way-

12 Ms. Pitts. In the 1950s Mr. Bissell has said that the

13 emphasis on intelligence collection shifted from the Eastern

14 || European bloc to third world countries because the ability to |

{
15 collect intelligence was very limited in those areas, and it
16 was easier to combat Communism or collect information on |
am Communist influnece in areas where Communism may just be
18) starting. and he made this general comment about the enisting |
19 emphasis in the CIA's collection. Would you say that is fair? |
20 | Mr. Tweedy. I think that is fair. |

i

21 || Ms. Pitts. I am wondering how that might have been
22 translated into something like the creation of the African
23 | pivision in 1959? |
24 My. Tweedy. The things that created the African Division |
25 | of course was the creation of modern Africa. That is what |

really created the African Division. Because other than that
it was a series of colonial estates.

Ms, Pitts. And our relation would have been restricted
to things like liaison an so on?

Mr. Tweedy. Very much so, exactly. But starting around
about 1959 for the next couple of years Africa exploded into

independence. In the National Geographic they gave up the

struggle about halfway and didn't print a map for about eight
months until things sort of settled down. And this was what
caused the African Division to be formed.

Ms. pitts. A lot of that is given to President Kennedy's

interest in Africa, and Africa as a campaign issue in the

Kennedy campaign before his election in 1960?

Mr. Tweedy. Let's face it, the whole of the US was seized
and intrigued by this African explosion.

Ms. Pitts. It seems as if the interest would have
eeoae without Kennedy to me.

Mr. Tweedy. It would have increased without Kennedy. If
think also Kennedy, and a lot of other people, wrongly, I
think in the end, tied this to the black population of the
US and the interest they would have in this -- which in fact
was minimal. But that took a long time to really recognize.
I think the general feeling was that there would be a subject
of insistence on the part of the black population in the US

that the US, in quotes, do something about Africa. It just

didn't eventuate.

Ms. Pitts. By the same token, in terms of the US having
to do something about Africa, it seems as though another trend
that was influencing policy-makers as a group was the trend
of non~intervention in African, in that domestic black popula-
tion of the US would be outraged if we didn't do something.

Do you think if we intervened that would have carried weight?

Mr. Tweedy. If what you mean by intervene is try to run
the African affairs, ghen I think I would agree. But the
other aspect of this was, of course, in the early days, the
fear that the bloc, Soviet bloc, would gain some kind of

control over Africa. Now, in the end a lot of this proved
erroneous. But there was no way in the world you could prove
that in 1959. It was felt, I think, that those young,
unsophisticated African States would be sort of sitting ducks.
They didn't prove to be. But again it was a number of years

before the series of events occurred which indicated that the

Africans in their own funny way had a way of preserving their

own independence -- perhaps that is the wrong word -- but their

own way of doing things. And they could be just as mercurial
as the next man. But the experience in the Soviet Union had
with Sekou Toure in Guinea, it was like a yo-yo, they were

up one minute and down the next, and they never knew from

one minute to the next how they were going to be treated. But

there was no way in the world that the US could predict this.

And thus the Kennedy Administration's interest in Africa was
certainly predicated partly on that political thing, the

blacks and the black continent, but also very much the fear of

the Soviet influence and the strategic leverage on the world
that would give them if it really went down the drain as it
were. And this of course was certainly a major interest --

a combination of both those things was the major influence

in our involvement in the Congo.

Ms. Pitts. Was the Congo particularly of Strategic intere

Mr. Tweedy. The Congo was the largest geographical

: |
|

Ms. Pitts. How much merit would you give to the argument

as entertained by some historians, and so on, that the Congo

as a supplier of uranium was of uniwue strategic importance?

Mr. Tweedy. ‘This was an aspect, And again not so much
the uranium supply was very important to the US then, I guess
there are many other sources of it now, for awhile of course

it was the only source, during the war. Copper was very

important, not that the US didn't have access to copper, but

they did not want some hostile power to have total and free
access to this enormous residual supply. So this was a factor
too. But I think the most important factor was that if the
Congo was going to fragment, the ripple effect in the balance |
of sub-Sahara and Africa was unpredictable, but likely to

be very harmful. After all, a neighboring country was Nigeria.

And in those days an enormous amount of hope reposed in the
orderly development of Nigeria. And it was felt that in the
Congo had gone down the drain the infection might easily
spread to Nigeria. And a lot of other developing countries.

And when Tsombe started to lead Katangan secession,
nothing became more apparent than the fact that the Congo
without Katanga was like constructing a cadillac without a
gas tank.

Ms. Pitts. How about the view that it would have truly

[ece ve
served US interests for Katanga to have ceceded and to ha

been under Western influence because of Tsombe ~~

Mr. Tweedy. We didn't believe it, believed that it
should belong to the Congo. And we also felt that the
effect of cutting Katanga off from Leopoldville would not
only have set an example, but it would have a palpable
effect on the rest of the world which would have been very
difficult for the democracies to answer. As I remember it
-- this was nothing of a factor in any discussions I held,
it may very well have been in the policy areas.

Ms. Pitts. What interests me about that aspect is that i

seems that our relationship with Belgium was very important

in terms of the courses of action that the US took in the

congo, and respecting the long term relationship with Belgium.

And it would seem that if they had been most interested in

cespecting that relationship they would have favored the

secession of Katanga. But obviously there were other factors
that ~-

Mr. Tweedy. There were other factors very much more
important. I think we would have been glad to see the
Belgians able to maintain a sufficient control, administrative
control over the mining industry in Katanga, so that it

continued to be efficiently run. But I don't think the US

Government felt it owed anything particularly to the Belgian

Government to see to it that they maintained their hold there

i t i ween
at all. Let's face it, the long term relations betw

Belgium and the US are important, but they are not overriding.

mg. pitts. In terms of the relationship of political and
military instability in Africa as in Communism, the increase
of Communist influence in Africa, do you think if there was
an automatic assumption that any political instability was
unfavorable -- what I am getting at is, if there hadn't been
evidence, for instance, that had been receiving arms through
the UAR from the USSR and that kind of thing, do you think
that the US would have taken a stand of supporting Mobutu

and the Central Government generally?

Mr. Tweedy. I think probably for the simple reason that
we had Gizenga identified probably rightly as a radical
racist African, bitterly anti-white. And we didn't believe
at that point this was the kind of development in Africa

that offered much solution for Africa's early days of

independence. The role of the UAR and the USSR merely put

icing on that cake, there is no question but that it did. But

in the first instance I think the worry of the US Government

was over the possible political disolution of the Congo for

African reasons, and superimposed on that came the business

of what the bloc would he likely to do, or what role they were |

Playing, and so on and so forth. In the first instance it

looked like it was going to fragement Africans. By that

Ms. Pitts. What prompts my question is that today, in

1975, the CIA justifies its action that it took on behalf of

the US Government on the basis of the Soviet threat in the

Congo.

Mr. Tweedy. All I am telling you is that it is a bit of

both. The Soviet threat certainly became more and more a part

of the general cole war worry. And of course the Soviets

themselves became more and more fascinated by Africa.

there was no way in the world that we could have told at that |

\
point. But I would make the point, and I stick to it, that i
the early fears were compounded of both the Soviet Union's |
thing as well as the dissolution of the Congo State and the |
effect it would have on '.frican Africa.

Ms. Pitts. My concern with it is that it seems as if there
weren't any Soviet Influence whatsoever, we still would have |
been concerned with the Congo, and would probably have taken

the political action that was taken to fund the Binza Group,

and so on. |

Mr. Tweedy. I guess, Ms. pitts, that would be fair. It

|

is kind of difficult to tell at this point.
Ms. Pitts. Right, because you can't speculate on something
that didn't happen. But it was a very important area in
Africa potentially. That was the thing, both in terms of

the acreage it covered, the strategic marerials it contained,

and its potential for harm or good in terms of its relatively
orderly development or chaotic dissolution. 1

Ms. Pitts. I think it makes much more sense to have a

multi-reason policy for taking covert action in an area,
and I have just been sort of dismayed at the insistence at
the hands of the Soviets.
Mr. Tweedy. My own conviction is that it was both.
Ms. Pitts. That seems reasonable.

Mr, Tweedy. But I would not disagree that obviously the

Ms. Pitts. Were relationships developed with those various

about seven children. He had already made some tentative '

But it was a very difficult thing to do when the Belgians were |
in charge, you had to be very discrete. But basically all
those contacts were made later.
Ms. Pitts. It seems that the strong man, as various
|
people have named him, was clearly Mobutu from the beginning. |
Mr. Tweedy. Once he got on the scene this young man did oy
remarkable job of establishing himself and hanging onto it.
And even though there are times today when he looks to be a
bit of an ass, it has been a considerable career. I knew him

somewhat well. He and his wife had dined with me in my house

in Chevy Chase back in about 1962, I suppose it was. The

country without any question, has been much better off as a
result of him than it might have been otherwise. And now,
of course, he is becoming sort of an end of the 20th Century
African, because I think the political urgency is called for.
But I don't think it is anything that we should get very
panicky about.

Ms. Pitts. It seems that a secondary goal in the Congo,
the primary goal that Congo be unified and that it be

politically and militarily stable, the secondary ¢

that it is possible that the kind of Government that would

Department would levy requirements, do this, but make sure
that it keeps the prime minister in the position he is, and
that kind of thing. In other words, we were allowed to fund

Mobutu, but it should be made clear to him that he should

seek a secondary role to the elected politicians and that kin

of thing. Do you agree that that would be sort of a secondary |

geal?

Me. Tweedy. I have a hard time really remembering th

Obviously the State Department didn't want to upset the very

delecate democratic balance -- let's use that word, because
there isn't another, that is heing realistic about it. We

weren't interested in building up a one man dictatorship.

And Mobutu was obviously sensible enought to realize that this
wasn't a sensible way to go about it either, even though you
can say that he has virtually reached that point now, or is

very close to it, ane even though I guess the parliamentary

trappings are still there.

Ms. Pitts. Would you agree that it was a goal at all to

try to have a democratic government?

Mr. Tweedy. I think those of us who are very much

i isti ac
involved in Africa soon became a bit realistic on democracy

as such. What we were much more looking for was stability

commensurate without one man rule, but as the years went by,

it was perfectly obvious that there was no way you could
legislate this kind of thing, because in the early days of
primitive country's development, the leaders are inevitably
coming to the fore. What country in Africa can you think of H
today where a man hasn't been of just enormous importance to \
development of that country? Some of them survive. Houphuet, |
Obignynseng and some others, Sengh of Senegal, still survive. |
And they came there before Tweedy became Division Chief, and |
they still survive.

Now, it may not be a one man dictator organization. They \
are not.

Ms. Pitts. But one strong man who pretty much is the only

person capable of handling the country?

Mr. Tweedy. Ahidjo in the Cameroon.

Ms. Pitts. So I would say among the people who worked
with Africa there was no lip service to always trying to
encourage the formation of leadership by electoral mechanisms
and that kind of thing?

Mr. Tweedy. I think we were realistic about it.

Ms. Pitts. I am not saying that that would have been
desirable at all.

Mr. Tweedy. I don't say that -~ we certainly didn't try
to undermine it.

terribly realistic about it.

Ms. Pitts. Would you say that the State Department was
more interested in that kind of thing than the CIA would have
been?

Mr. Tweedy. I don't think you can differentiate the two.
Our jobs were different. We didn't disagree with what the
State Department wanted for Africa. Sometimes we could
disagree over detail, not so much what was wanted but what
was practical and what could be done and what was likely to
develop, our assessments of situations quite often varied.
But that happens all over the world. And sometimes they were
right and sometimes we were right. But I don't think this was
a philosophic split at all.

Ms. Pitts. I would like to ask you a little bit about
what we actually did down there, my primary interest is the

introduction of the pilots and so on in 1963. And if I may

obviously it was very small. We hadn't been engaged in all

Ms. Pitts. Thank you for your time.

Mr. Tweedy. That is fine.

Ms. Pitts. Off the record.

(O£E the record discussion.}

Mr. Maxwell. Mr. Tweedy, what I would like to ask you

about if possible is the operational use of drugs by the

Agency, either proposed use or actual use. Let me try to
outline for you the state of the evidence at this point.
Apparently drugs, including LSD and Meretran, were used
velatively frequently for interrogation purposes throughout
the fifties and into the sixties. In 1957 and 1958 the
Agency began, under the auspices of Mr. Helms, who was at

that time Chief of Operations in DDP, an analysis of policies

and procedures to be used in regard to drugs. And what we

re most interested in is that the policies and procedures
that were set up to govern proposals in the DDP for such use,
and operational use that flowed from that. I have with me a
series of memos that were done at that time on policies and

procedures, and one case that ntions a particular use that

does not involve the African Division, but which raised some

questions that we might discuss. And if you would like to

look over the memos --

Mx. Tweedy. Yes, because at the moment I have the
hardest time remembering them.

Of course at that point I was in London.

Mr. Maxwell, There is no indication that you were
involved.

Mr. Tweedy. Of course I may not even have seen the memo.
Mc. Maxwell. You were in London from when to when?

Mr. Tweedy. 1956 to 1959.

Mr. Maxwell. And you came back to Head the Africa
bivision?

Mr. Tweedy. I did.

Mr. Maxwell. The only reason for looking at those is
that they may in fact refresh your recollection as to the
discussions that were going on in the Agency, or that you
might have become aware of.

Mr. Tweedy. Sitting in London, a non-operational
station, strictly, it would be just the sort of thing that
would go right over the top of our heads and we would never
hear about. For example, I think I would be almost willing
to swear that I have never seen this memorandum. And it has

got some very interesting stuff in it here from the viewpoint

of the Medical Staff and so forth.

Mr. Tweedy. They wouldn't have gone to a station like

mine.

Mr. Maxwell. I think those internal policy papers
probably went to no stations.

Mr. Tweedy. That is very possible, because what the

case was, the d

terms of their normal discipline over stations they would

have controlled the use that way without,

ing the stations in the bureaucracy of memoranda of this

kind, which, among other things, might be considered overly

sensitive to repose in the station.

memorandum in draft form for the Chief of Operations on the
subject of the operational use of chemical agents, proposed

a committee which woulé vass on the use of drugs and also

was not under strict controls. But if you are asking me
whether I can resurrect the nature of those controls, either
by a committee or this memorandum or the rest of it, I just
don't recall.

a proposal from a station in Africa came to you which involved
the use of drugs, chemical or biological agents?

on and which were replaced by a regulation known as CSI 220-19
governing what were called MK DELTA materials.

now, but I am sure I saw them. JI tell you, as so many things
were in the Agency, which were governed by rules and the rest
