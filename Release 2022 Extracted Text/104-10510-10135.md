Counselor interviewed Faustino Hartino#) today

Previous to hia dcning here; counselor talked to the Counoil for the

» Blind :ag.thore.'nas nothing we could do for him ond actually it waa

contrary to our'rogulations to accept him since the-modical report

“Andfoatod thathe was industrially blinds Tho Council for tho Blind

otated that If ho could. speck English thoy would attenpt to work with
him but, of course, with his glauccca, it would be difficult for hia

to atte «

At tho ond of the interview, os Vartdnos Jrateated hat becouse of his
conoral debilitated condition, he did not actually wish to cot into any
training program or adtuslly get into any work situation ao hovhed just
about onvuch etrengh to olt.up. Cf course, glauccna Jo pretty generally.
Considered to be progressive in nature an! everything consorned and

m ntloned above leaves thia counselor with the irpression thot this

individual wi21 bo a Mabllity on cone one for the rost of hin life and

4s not exployables

Thorefore, of course, he io not boing acceptod into this rehabilitation
procrane It would be this counsélor's recocmondation that if it wore
poanible, that ho be drozred from the.CiC progran and put on the Cuban
Tefugoe procrane Thia reocenendation is in view of the fnot, that this
will be a long indefinite welfare caoe and it 1s likely that the Cuban
Rofugea gonoral progran will be going on long after the CES 1a olosed
and vory Iikoly, even shen the Cubsn Refugee progran is olocedy they
would continue on the State “elfaro. Cf course, I am in no position to

know whether this is legally possible.
Sincerely your 4,
