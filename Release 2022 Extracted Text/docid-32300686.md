March 6, 1958, in discussing his association with LA ROCCA,

stated that in 1943, LA ROCCA invited him to share equally

in the ownership of the foin Machine Distributing Company,

which later set up offices at 5746 Baum Boulevard, Pittsburgh.

above owned an equal share in the company that MANNARINO anc

LA ROCCA seemed to run everything and nela meetings 'at which

Impottant topics were discussed in the Italian language.

T-3 advised that he did not understand the Italian language

and added that he realized that LA ROCCA was only using him

for his proven protection methods and did not mind as long as

he got his cut out of the profits.

I-3 said his protection

was the then superthtendght of Police (fnu) SCOTT..

T-3. recalled that ERANKAVALENTE and

offices of the coin Machine

Distributing Company regularly

and always took orders from MANNARINO and LA ROCCA:

T-3

stated that in his opinion he would place LA ROCCA and

MANNARINO as the two men who

control the rackets in Western

Pennsylvania, and he sees ke aerseas the logical

successor to the top position.

T-3 recalled that around 1947, labor leader NICK

visited the offices of the Coin Machine Distributing Company.

and asked SAM MANNARINO to get some

"gorillas" to

work over

some men who were giving STIRONE trouble in connection with

the construction of a highway being built in the Monroeville

section.

According to T-3, the job was done for STIRoNE by

MANNARING who became very angry when he learned his men had

hurt some older Italian men working on the construction job.

T-3 said that MANNARINO was under the impression when he was

approached by STIRONE that the men who were giving the labor

trouble were younger men and he (MANNARINO) let STIRONE know

what their thought of him in front of T-3.

On November 22, 1957; T-4, who has furnished rellable Infor-

mation in the past, stated that in the Pittsburgh, Pa., area,

15 years HAZIDAKIS has been a trusted lieutenant of the

MANNARINO organization,

MANNARINO. T-1 went on to say that at the present time

HAZIDAKIS, along with JOHN FONTANA, is actively supervising

the Barbout and crap games operating on the second floor

of the building next to the Ken-Mar Hotel and has the

direct responsibility for holding large amounts of cash

and making a final accounting of the proceeds taken in each

night to the MANNARINO brothers.

I-I mentioned that on many

occasions KELLY MANNARINO has told him that he trusts.

HAZIDAKIS implicitly in money matters and has absolutely

no hesitancy in relying on him to turn over every cent made

on the gambling tables.

By way of background information, T-l explained that

around 1932, HAZIDAKIS was convicted in U.S. District

Court, Pittsburgh, for giving false testimony at a

naturalization hearing in which he testified that a

fellow countryman from Greece was deserving of citizenship

in the United States and had no prior convictions.

According to T-l, the individual seeking citizenship

arrests which were brought to light

and HAZIDAKIS was convicted and sentenced to serve

several months in the Westmoreland County Jail. T-1

pointed out that HAZIDAKIS has a wife and teen-age son

living in Athens, Greece, and that HAZIDAKIS has told

him on many occasions that he is very proud of the son's

scholastic ability and the progress he 1s making in

high school.

T-l stated that from conversations with

HAZIDAKIS he believes the son,

in addition to attending

high school in Athens, is receiving private instructions

from a tutor, and that the boy apparently is possessed

with a very high Id.

T-l went on to say that in his opinion HAZIDAKIS is worth

at least a half million dollars in American money and

would actually like to return to Athens, Greece,

permanently If it were not for KELLY MANNARINO and his

influence over him.

T-1 explained that about a year ago

HAZIDAKIS visited

his family in Athens and indicated to

him before he left that he might stay in Greece permanently.

I-I stated that several months later, after HAZIDAKIS

returned from Greece and from conversations with him, he

gathered that KELLY MANNARINO either ordered HAZIDAKIS

back to the United States or sent someone over to Greece

to bring him back.

I-I said that HAZIDAKIS 1s actually

terrified.of KELLY MANNARINO and in his opinion only

stays in the United States for fear of winding up with a

bullet in his head if he refuses to follow KELLY MANNARINO'S

orders.

According to T-1, HAZIDAKIS 1s also afraid that

he is dying of cancer and has consulted many doctörs and

visited several of the major medical clinics in the United

States where he has been assured that he does not have

cancer, but he still continues to worry over the situation

needlessly.

In regard to real estate holdings in Greece, I-1 stated

that he recently learned that the office building owned

by HAZIDAKIS is located in Perias, Greece, rather than

Athens, and described the building as a large office-type

building, occupied for the most part by doctors and

the Greensburg State Police Post since 1921, and furnished

the following information regarding the influence of the

MANNARINO organization in Greensburg:

T-1 described Captain MARONEY as a honest and dedicated law

enforcement officer who, since his transfer to the Greensburg

Post around 1954, has often confided to him that he would

like very much to crack down on the influence of the

described raptalino, since his tra

MANNARINO organization but 1s actually powerless to do so.

By way of background explanation, T-l pointed out that during

the period, 1951-1952, after serving for a brief period as

acting warden of the Western State Penitentiary in Pittsburgh,

MARONEY waS transferred to the Pennsylvania State Police Post

state polite ne

at washington, Pa., some distance from his home in Greensburg,

Pa., and was most

anxious to arrange a transfer to Greensburg,

as quickly as possible in order to be near his family.

T-1

explained that around 1954, he visited MARONEY at the

Washington State Police Post and that MARONEY expressed

extreme bitterness over the fact that JOHN DENT, now a

Congressman in the U.S. House of Representatives, who was

then in Harrisburg, Pa., had promised him a transfer to

Greensburg,

but naa not made good on that promise.

T-l stated

that several weeks later he happened to see DENT personally

and mentioned to: DENT that MARONEY appeared to be very unhappy

with his assignment in Washington, Pa., to which DENT replied

that MARONEY would soon be transferred to Greensburg, providing

proper arrangements could be worked out with him as to the

manner in which he would enforce the law in Westmoreland

T-1 said that within two weeks time MARONEY was

transierred to the Greensburg Post and that In many conversations

with MARONEY since that time, the latter has implied that he

was compelled to promise ToM TANNAsathe contact man, of the

MANNARINO organization and City Clerk of Arnold, Pa.,

that he

would not take any action in line with his official duties

to disrupt gambling in New Kensington or Arnold, Pa., without

first clearing with the County District Attorney who,

organization.

Iji said that EARL KIME (phonetic), the present district

attorney for Westmoreland County,

would like very much to

run for the vacancy on the County Bench created by the recent

death of County Judge BAUER, but that TANNAS has instructed

him to stay in his present position as district attorney, where

he can do the most good for the MANNARINO organization.

T-I stated that in his opinion any approach to the present

district attorney for Westmoreland County or First Sergeant

JOHN PO AHELFENSTEIN of the Greensburg State Police Post on

behalf of the FBI

Or any law enforcement agency would result

in the MANNARINO brothers being notified within "five

minutes."

T-I said that from personal knowledge he knows

that Sergeant HELFENSTEIN has been paid regularly by

GABRIEL MANNARINO for the past 15 years, and would not

hesitate to do anything to protect them.

T-1 added that

Captain MARONEY has told him on many occasions that he is

"disgusted" over the circumstances under which he must

assume his commana at the Greensburg Post but has pointed

out that he only has a few years left before retirement

and has tried to rationalize the situation in this manner..

"crooked"

earning his living as a professional gambler back in 1917.

been accepting money from SAM and KELLY MANNARINO. ever

that concerned the MANNARINO organization, was uncovered by

On February 26, 1958, a spot surveillance was maintained

on subject's residence by SA RICHARD GORDON DOUCE; however,

the subject was not observed and no activity was noted.

On March 6, 1958, WILLIAM JEFFERSON; Superintendent of

Schools, New Kensington, Pa., was interviewed to determine

his attitude toward acting as a neighborhood source with

reference to subject's activities.

JEFFERSON stated that

he would be more than happy to assist the FBI but pointed

out that he is rarely home on weekends and since his wife

is

regularly employed as an instructor at the University

of Pittsburgh and never home during the week he did not

feel they could thoroughly cover subject's activities.

JEFFERsoN suggested, however, that Mr. and Mrs. JAMES C.

Post of 210 Highland Ave., would be ideally suited for

he assignment, not only from the

geographical location of

their home in relation to subject's home, but also because

of their excellent character and unsympathetic attitude

insofar as racketeers are concerned.

JEFFERSON observed that Mrs. POST is In the best position

In theirighborhood to not only observe the general activities

occurring in subject's home but can also observe automobiles

stopping at subject's residence without having to leavether

living room.

JEFFERSON added that the majority of subject's

neighbors are either quite elderly people or spend a good

deal of their time during the day away from their homes.

JEFFERSON expressed the opinion

choices who could follow subject's activities, the elderly

durt opinion

that the other logical

families residing at 202 and 206 Highland Ave., would

not be in a position to obtain license numbers of automobites

without leaving their residence and in addition, might be

afraid to follow and report as to subject's activities

because of his national reputation as a racketeer. JEFFERSON

also commented that on the basis of his limited

association

with the elderly families living at 202 and 206 Highland

he could not in all fairness describe them as the most

discreet type of individuals.
