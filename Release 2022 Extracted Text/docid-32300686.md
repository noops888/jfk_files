T-3, who has furnished reliable information in the past, on
March 6, 1958, in discussing his association with LA ROCCA,
stated that in 1943, LA ROCCA invited him to share equally

in the ownership of the Goin Machine Distributing Company,
which later set up offices at 5746 Baum Boulevard, Pittsburgh.

T-3. recalled that, : VAL RIPEPT visited ies

and always took orders from MANNARINO and LA ROCCA: T-3
' stated that in his opinion ha would place LA ROCCA and

MANNARINO as the two. men who trol the: rackets in Western

Pennsylvania, and he sees sS the logical

“puctéssor td the top position. :

7-3 recalled that. around 1947, labor leader. NIC STIRONE, } #
visited the offices of the Coin Machine Distributing Company
and asked SAM MANNARINO to get.some "gorillas" to \ork over i
some men who were giving STIRONE trouble. in connection with i
the construction of a highway being built in the Monroeville :
section. According to T-3, the job was done for STIRONE by

MANNARINO who became very angry when he learned. his men had

hurt some older. Italian men working on. the construction job.

T-3 said that MANNARINO was under the impression when he was
approached by STIRONE that the men who were giving the labor

trouble were younger’men and he (MANNARINO) let STIRONE know

what the; thought of him in front of T-3.

| On November 22, 1957, T-4, who has furnished reliable infor-
mation in the past, stated that in the Pittsburgh, Pa., area, i
FRANK AMATO of Braddock, Pa., is the "real boss" of the rackets.

T-4, om November 22, 1957, stated that MIKE GENOVESE
is the prodigy. of JOHN LA ROCCA and will eventually
succeed LA ROCCA in the latter's many gambling interests.

T-4, on September 4, 1954, stated that JOHN LA ROCCA, was
at that time, "the boss" of gambling operations in the
tri-state area and holds an interest in every big game.

Lieutenant JACK STACK, NA, Pittsburgh, Pa., Police

Department, on Degember 16, 1957, advised SA JOHN D. ANTHONY
that ANTONIO (To) \ IPEPT. of 4720 Brownsville | oad,,.Whitehal ,,

T- 1, on February 24, 1958, point d out that et has known
HAZIDAKIS since 1932; and added tAat for the ‘past 12 to
15-years HAZIDAKIS has-been a trusted lieutenant of the
MANNARINO organization, directly responsible to KELLY
MANNARINO, T-+1 went on to say that at the present time
-HAZIDAKIS, along with JOHN FONTANA,is actively supervising
the Barbout and crap games operating on the second floor

of the building next to the Ken-Mar Hotel and has the
direct responsibility for holding large amounts of cash
and making a final accounting of the proceeds taken in each
night to the MANNARINO brothers. T-1 mentioned that on many
occasions KELLY MANNARINO has told him that he trusts
HAZIDAKIS implicitly in money matters and has absolutely

no hesitancy in relying on him to turn over every cent made
on the gambling tables.

By way of background information, T-1 explained that
around 1932, HAZIDAKIS was convicted in U. S, District
Court, Pittsburgh, for giving false testimony at a
naturalization hearing in which he testified that a
fellow countryman from Greece. was deserving of citizenship
in the United States and had no prior convictions.
According to T-1, the individual seeking citizenship
had several past arrests which were brought to light
and HAZIDAKIS was convicted and sentenced.to serve
several months in ‘the Westmoreland County Jail. T-1
pointed out that HAZIDAKIS has a wife and teen-age son
living in Athens, Greece, and that HAZIDAKIS has told
him on.many occasions that he is very proud of the son's
scholastic ability and the progress he is making. in
high school, T-1 stated that from conversations with
HAZIDAKIS he believes ‘the son, in addition to attending
high school. in Athens, is receiving private instructions
from. a tutor, and that the boy. apparently is possessed
with a very high IQ.

T-1 went on/to say that in his’ opinion HAZIDAKIS is worth
at least a half million dollars in American money and
would actually like to return to Athens, Greece,
permanently \if it were not for KELLY.MANNARINO and his
influence over him. T-1 explained that about a year ago
HAZIDAKIS visited his family in Athens and indicated to
him before he left that he might stay in Greece permanently.
T-1 stated that several months later, after HAZIDAKIS
returned from Greece and from conversations with him, he
gathered that KELLY MANNARINO either ordered HAZIDAKIS
pack to the United States.or sent someone over to Greece
to bring him back, T-1 said that HAZIDAKIS is actually
terrified.of KELLY MANNARINO and in his opinion only

stays in the United States for fear of winding up with a
pullet in his head if he refuses to follow KELLY MANNARINO's
orders, According to:T-1, HAZIDAKIS. is also afraid! that
he is dying of cancer and has consulted many doctors and
visited several of the major medical clinics in the United
States where he has been. assured that he does not have
eancer, but he still continues to worry over the situation
needlessly. :

In regard to real estate holdings in Greece, T-1 stated
that he recently learned that the office building owned
by HAZIDAKIS is located in Perias, Greece, rather than
Athens, and described the building as a large office-type
pbuilding, occupied’ for the most part by doctors and

professional men with the main Etre of the building being
leased out to merchants.

T-5, who has furnished reliable information in the past, on
February 18, 1958, furnished the following information:

On February 6, 1958, information was received from Mr. JACK
LIEBOF, Assistant Protection Officer, U. S, Embassy, Mexico,
D.F., that on the night of January 22, 1958, he had
received a telephone call from one ROBERT TEEMER, who
stated that his uncle, C, F. TEEMER, had been arrested by
the Secret: Service of the Metropdélitan Police of the Federal
District, and was being held at Police Headquarters.
According to LIEBOF, ROBERT TEEMER insisted that the former
should go to the Police Station and make available to the
uncle, blankets and appropriate food in view of the fact ~
that the uncle was ill and suffering from ulcers or some
other stomach disorder,

ROBERT TEEMER admitted to LIEBOF that his uncle was a
professional gambler, and as ‘a result, LIEBOF refused to
take any action with respect to the alleged: apprehension.

On the following day, ROBERT TEEMER appeared at the
‘Protection Section and spoke briefly to the Protection
officer, Mr. JOHN WILSON,- advising the latter that he and
Cc.’ F, TEEMER were at the Reforma Hotel, WILSON gave little
‘sympathy to the representation of ROBERT TEEMER and no
record of the matter was made at the Protection Section.

According to T-5, the files of the Reforma Hotel reflect that
C. F. TEEMER and ROBERT TEEMER had arrived at that hotel

en the evening of January 20, 1958, and had departed on the
afternoon of January 23, "1958; Personnel: of the hotel claimed
to have no information regarding the alleged apprehension

of C. F. TEEMER. (SAPO,

the Greensburg State Police Post since 1921, and furnished
the following information regarding the influence of the
MANNARINO organization in Greensburg:

T-1 described Captain MARONEY as a honest and dedicated law
enforcement officer who, since his transfer to the Greensburg
Post around 1954, has often confided to him that he would
like very much to crack down on the influence of the
MANNARINO organization but is actually powerless to do so.
By way of background explanation, T-1 pointed out that during
the period, 1951-1952, after serving for a brief period as
\acting warden of the Western State. Penitentiary’ in: Pittsburgh,
MARONEY was transferred to the. Pennsylvania State Police Post
lat Washington, Pa,, some distance from his home in Greensburg,
}Pa., and was most anxious to arrange a transfer to Greensburg,
as quickly as possible in order to be near his family. T-1
explained that around 1954, he visited MARONEY at the
Washington State Police Post and that MARONEY expressed
extreme bitterness over the fact that JOHN DENT, now a
Congressman in the U..S, House of Representatives,. who was
then in Harrisburg, Pa., had promised him a transfer to
Greensburg, but had not made good on that promise, T-1 stated
that several weeks later he happened to see DENT personally
and mentioned to: DENT that: MARONEY appeared to be very unhappy
with his assignment in Washington, Pa., to, which DENT replied
| that MARONEY would s00n be transferred to Greensburg,providing
‘\proper arrangements could’ be worked out with him as to the
;\manner in which he would enforce the law in Westmoreland
county. .T-l said that within two weeks time MARONEY was
ransferred to the Greensburg Post and that in many conversations
ith MARONEY since that time, the latter has implied that he
as compelled to eee oe aE ce contact man, of the
NNARINO organization a Lty rk of Arnold, Pa., that he
ould not take any action in line with his official duties
to disrupt gambling in New. Kensington or Arnold, Pa., without
first clearing with’ the County District Attorney who,
according to T-1, is backed by TANNAS and: the MANNARINO
organization. ~

T+i said that EARL KIME (phonetic), the present district
attorney for Westmoreland County, would like very much to

run for the vacancy on the County Bench created by the recent
death of County Judge BAUER, but that TANNAS has instructed
him to stay in his present position as district attorney, where
he can do the most good for the MANNARINO organization.

T-1 stated that in ee any approach to the present
distrixt attorney for Westmoreland County or, First Sergeant
iN .JOHN_P,AYELFENSTEIN.of the Greensburg State Police Post on
f ehalf or ie “or any law enforcement agency would result
in the MANNARINO brothers being notified within “Five
minutes." T-1 said that from personal knowledge he knows
i that Sergeant HELFENSTEIN has been paid regularly by
GABRIEL ‘MANNARINO for: the past 15 years, and would not
: hesitate to-do anything to protect them, T-1 added that
: Captain MARONEY has told him on many occasions that he is
' "aisgusted" over the circumstances under which he must
assume his command at the Greensburg Post, but has pointed
out that he only has a few years left pefore retirement
and has. tried to rationalize the situation in this manner,

investigating the activities of hoodlums in Uniontown, Pa.,

On February 26, 1958, a’ spot surveillance was maintained
on subject's residence by SA RICHARD GORDON DOUCE; however,
the subject was not observed and no activity was noted.

On March 6, 1958, WILLIAM JEFFERSON; Superintendent of
Schools; New Kensington, Pa., was interviewed to determine
his attitude toward acting as a neighborhood source with
reference to subject's activities, JEFFERSON stated that
he would be more than happy’ to assist thé FBI but pointed
out that he is rarely home on weekends and since his wife
is regularly employed as an instructor at the University
of Pittsburgh and never home during the week he did not
feel they could thoroughly cover subject's activities.
JEFFERSON suggested, however, that Mr. and Mrs. JAMES C.
POST of 216 Highland Ave., would be ideally suited for

the assignment, not only from the geographical location of
their home in relation to subject's home,but also because
of their excellent character and unsympathetic attitude |
insofar as racketeers are concerned.

JEFFERSON observed that Mrs. POST is. in the best position
in theiteighborhood to not only observe the.general activities
occurring in subject's home but can also observe automobiles
stopping at subject's residence without having to leavefher
living room. JEFFERSON added that the majority of subject's
neighbors are either quite elderly people or spend a good
deal of their time during the day away from their homes.’
JEFFERSON expressed the opinion that the other logical
choices who could follow subject's activities, the elderly
families residing at 202 and 206 Highland Ave., would
not be in a position to obtain license numbers of automobiles
without leaving their residence and in addition, might be
afraid to follow and report as to subject's activities

7. because of his national reputation asa racketeer, JEFFERSON
also commented that on the basis of his limited association

’ with the elderly families living at 202 arid 206 Highland

he could not in all fairness describe them as the most
discreet type of individuals,
