I. INTRODUCTION AND PHILOSOPHY OF USE 7

Questions have arisen as to CIA's use of proprietary mechanisms
to help carry out the Agency's missions. In particular, concerns
have been expressed about the Agency's financial and management control
over these entities and about the treatment of funds related to such
entities. A careful review of these entities has revealed that CIA's
proprietaries are appropriately limited and controlled with careful
consideration given to their use within the spirit and letter of the
law.

Proprietaries fall into two main categories:

1. Operating companies that actually do business as
would any private firm; and

2. Non-operating companies or entities that appear to
do business under commercial guise.

These entities may be legally constituted as corporations, partner~
ships, or sole proprietorships; or they may have no such legal standing,
i.e., they may be "notional" entities which have bank accounts and
backstopped addresses controlled by the Agency. Corporate proprietaries
are incorporated in accordance with the statutory provisions of the
jurisdiction of incorporation, are subject to the same review as any
corporate entity within that jurisdiction, file applicable state and/or
federal tax returns, and obtain the necessary licenses to conduct their
normal business. The purposes served by them are two-fold: they provide

cover, attribution for funding, and administrative assistance to agents



and covert activities; and they provide services not securely available
through normal commercial facilities. Because these instrumentalities
are established as private organizations, they must be established

and managed, to the extent possible, in accordance with practice and
requirements that are normal for the types of enterprises they give

the appearance of being.

Of the legally constituted entities, the Agency uses the corporate
form in most cases because of the advantages and flexibility of corporate
management control. These corporations are legally organized under the
laws of a state, country, or other jurisdiction and are either wholly
owned by CIA or controlled through majority stock ownership. Services
of bona fide businessmen are enlisted as nominee officers, directors,
and stockholders.

The Agency generally has employed proprietaries when it was the
only way, or clearly the best way, to achieve an approved objective.
Under Agency rules proprietaries are established or allowed to continue
in existence only so long as they contribute to accomplishment of the
Agency's mission and remain the most advantageous operational means of
achieving certain particular and necessary objectives. Current policy
calls for limited use of operating proprietary mechanisms. The capa-
bility to use the mechanism is to be retained (this the Agency terms
its "capability in being"), and smaller entities used.

A review of Agency files shows that the number of operating
proprietaries has been consciously pared by about 50 percent since the
mid 1960's. These reductions began as a result both of the Katzenbach
guidelines associated with the National Student Association affair in

1967 and the CIA's own IG survey in that same year. In addition, the

HW 50955 DocId:32423532 Page 7


need for proprietaries has declined as a result of a general shift in
emphasis away from covert action; transfer of Radio Frée Europe and
Radio Liberty to the Board of International Broadcasting with funding
through State Department; continuing liquidation of the assets of the
Air America complex as requirements for CIA support in Southeast Asia
have diminished; the sale of Southern Air Transport and the continuing
liquidation of assets of Intermountain Aviation with their exposure
in the press and the decreased need for contingency air capabilities.

The evidence establishes that activities of all proprietaries,
directly or indirectly, support the Agency's foreign intelligence collectio:
or covert action missions. Some of these proprietaries are located
within the United States for reasons of operational or administrative
necessity, but their ultimate impact is overseas. Some of the question-
able domestic uses of these entities is dealt with in the sections of
the Report on "Chaos" and related programs. And in one area, MHMUTUAL,
serious questions remain as to the propriety of using such a mechanism
to provide insurance and retirement benefits. This problem is detailed
later. (See Section VIII).

A, Operating Proprietaries

As discussed in greater ‘detail later, operating proprietaries
conduct business in the commercial sphere, but they are not in direct
competititon with privately owned corporations to such a degree as to
deprive the private companies of legitimate income. There is no doubt,
however, that they were and are in competition. The Agency has been
careful to limit the amount of commercial business engaged in by these
proprietaries to only that necessary to support the viability of the

commercial cover and keep it alive in the commercial world. Revenues

MW 50955 Docld:32423532 Page 8


have been used as partial offsets to operating costs. Aggregate
profits over the years have been relatively small. Only two proprie-
taries have shown significant profits: the Air America complex in
fulfilling mostly Government contracts in Southeast Asia, and the
insurance company handling trust funds and insurance (MHMUTUAL).

The air proprietary overview, infra Section IX., details the dilemmas
posed by size. Moreover, it sheds light on questions concerning
whether commercial viability became more of a bronze god-than was
necessary to maintain adequate cover.

Operating proprietaries may be large or small in terms of capital-
ization and total assets, depending upon the functions ‘they perform.
When the commercial purpose of an operating proprietary is incidental
to its CIA mission -- such as an export-import firm which engages in
commercial operations only to the extent necessary to provide cover
for a CIA officer in a foreign country -- a minimum capitalization,
usually in the neighborhood of $25,000 or less, is all that is required.
Examples of an operating proprietary in which commercial operations

are incidental to the Agency mission are:

MW 50955 Docld:32423532 Page 9


A foreign travel service company which operates in a Southeast
Asia country and provides cover for an agent targeted against
the local Communist Party. The company was established in 1973
with an initial investment of $5,900.

Operating proprietaries whose commercial purposes are in themselves
essential to the CIA mission require much larger capitalization and
investment. They are staffed by Agency personnel plus cleared commer-
cial enployees as required. Among the Agency's operating proprietaries
of this type are four management companies which provide commercial
assistance to other proprietaries and an audit firm which conducts
commercial audits of operating companies and those non-operating
proprietaries with substantial assets. The Agency's largest operating
proprietaries are Air America, an insurance complex, and the aviation
facility, Intermountain Aviation, Inc. The assets of Intermountain
have been sold, with operations ceasing-on 28 February 1975; and:the--
corporation is in the process of being dissolved.

Air America, the Agency's largest proprietary, which is in the
process of liquidation, provided aircraft in support of Agency operations
in Southeast Asia. This support has been under cover of a commercial
flying service in fulfillment of U.S. Government contracts. Corporate
Headquarters has been in Washington, D. C., with field Headquarters
in

The insurance complex provides a mechanism for the payment of
annuities and other benefits to sensitive agents and for self-insurance
of risks involved in covert operations which, for security reasons,
cannot be attributed to the U.S. Government or handled through private
firms. The complex was formed in 1962 as a clandestine commercial
support mechanism to provide death and disability benefits to agents

or their beneficiaries when security considerations precluded payments

HW 50955 DocId:32423532 Page 10


ge

attributable to the U.S. Government. This function was broadened

to include self-insurance for many risks involved in covert operations,
including property risks incurred by operational activities of Agency-
owned air and marine companies. From an early date, the complex has
administered agents' escrow accounts and life insurance, and provided
annuity and pension programs for selected agent personnel employed by
the Agency. These programs are solely for the purpose of meeting the
Agency's obligations to agent-type personnel who have rendered services
over a substantial period of time and cannot be handled under normal
U.S. Government retirement programs. Individuals who qualify for the
CIA Retirement System or the Civil Service System are not handled
through the proprietary system. In addition, the complex has been
used to provide a limited amount of support to covert operations --
specifically, for the acquisition of operational real estate and as

a conduit for the funding of selected covert activities.

Intermountain Aviation, Inc., has the purpose of providing a
variety of nonattributable air support capabilities available for
quick deployment overseas to support Agency activities. The Agency
is in the process of disposing of its assets and terminating this
activity...

As of 1 July 1974 there were 71 operating proprietary companies,
of which 21 are part of the Agency's proprietary insurance complex.

The combined net worth (assets minus liabilities) of these companies

is approximately Although some, such.as those in the

insurance complex, are commercially self-supporting, most operating

proprietaries usually require budgetary support.

HW 50955 Docld:32423532 Page 11


B, Nonoperating Proprietaries

Nonoperating proprietaries vary in complexity according to their
Agency task, are, for the most part, either corporate shells or less
that facilitate foreign operations, and clearly pose no competitive
threat to bona fide businesses. The most elaborate are legally
licensed and established to conduct bona fide business. They have
nominee stockholders, directors, and officers and are generally
directed by one of four Agency proprietary management companies.
The company address may be a Post Office Box, a legitimate address
provided by a cleared and witting company official or attorney, or in
a few cases the address of a proprietary management company. They
maintain bank accounts, generate business correspondence, keep books
of account which can withstand commercial and tax audit, file State
and Federal tax returns, and perform normal business reporting to
regulatory authorities in order to backstop fully their Agency tasks.
They are moderately capitalized, generally around $5,000, and their
net worth at any one time varies according to the Agency task they
are performing. As of 31 December 1973, 38 of these companies had
a combined net worth of approximately $325,000. Of this amount,
almost $200,000 was operating capital for three companies which
provide cover for several Agency personnel. Examples of two non-
operating companies which are commercially managed, keep books of
account, and can withstand commercial and tax audit are:

A Florida corporation capitalized at $7,000 and whose legal
address is the office of a cleared and witting attorney.

HW 50955 Docld:32423532 Page 12


Requiring less elaborate commercial administration because of
the nature of Agency tasks performed are 31 legally incorporated
companies which are directly managed by Agency Headquarters specialists
operating in alias as signatories to the company bank accounts. Each
of these companies generally have a capitalization of $5,000 or less
and are domiciled in the offices of cleared and witting attorneys.

No commercial books of account are kept, and in the event of a tax
audit the Agency has to brief the auditing authority. Depending on
use, administration may be as simple as maintaining bank accounts and
filing annual franchise taxes or more extensive as required when
obtaining Employee Identification numbers, paying personnel, with-
holding taxes and Social Security, and filing tax returns. Examples

of this type of Headquarters-managed proprietary corporation are:

Although not proprietary corporations, but proprietaries in the
sense of being Agency-owned and administered, are 64 ostensible sole-
proprietorships. The Agency establishes and registers these sole-

proprietorships in the name of fictitious persons and opens a bank

HW 50955 DocId:32423532 Page 13


account on which Agency officers in alias have signatory power.
Arrangements are made with cleared and witting businessmen to
provide a domiciliary address for these entities at a law office
or telephone answering service. These entities, like the proprietary
corporation administered by Agency Headquarters specialists, provide
cover, payrolling, and tax attribution for Agency personnel and are
similarly administered.

Another type of entity used by the Agency and a proprietary
only in the sense of being Agency-owned and administered is exempli-
fied by some 215 notional companies which are not legally registered
but have names and bank accounts controlled by the Agency. The Agency
arranges with cleared and witting attorneys or proprietors of telephone
answering services to provide a domiciliary address and to refer any
queries to the Agency specialists concerned. These notional entities
are used to provide status and operational cover for Agency personnel
involved in all types of high-risk intelligence operations. They are
also used as ostensible clients for purposes of funding Agency pro-
prietaries or bona fide American companies which provide

cover and payrolling of Agency personnel.

IL. STATUTORY AUTHORITY FOR _PROPRIETARIES

The Agency's statutory authority to spend money for proprietary
corporations in support of Agency operations derives from Section 8(b)
of the CIA Act of 1949. This Act states:

"The sums made available to the Agency may be expended without
regard to the provisions of law and regulations relating to
the expenditure of Government funds; and for objects of a
c¢onfidential, extraordinary, or emergency nature, such
expenditures to be accounted for solely on the certificate

of the Director and every such certificate shall be deemed

a sufficient voucher for the amount therein certified."

NW 50955. DocId:32423532 Page 14


-~10-

The language contained in Section 8(b) is adequate authority to
exclude the operation of these proprietary corporations from the

law governing Government corporations in 31 U.S.C.A. 841 et. ‘seq.
However, the CIA General Counsel ruled in 1958 that the CIA should
comply with the principles in that Act to the extent possible, and
this has been done. Attached as Appendix A is a classified Memorandum
of Law by the Agency's Office of General Counsel on CIA's authority to
acquire and dispose of a proprietary without regard to provisions of
the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act, which position
was upheld by the U.S. District Court in the Southern District of
Florida in dismissing the suit Farmer vs. Southern Air Transport on

17 July 1974,
III. SPECIFIC CONTROLS

The formation and activities of proprietaries are controlled
through various mechanisms to assure their proper use, as discussed
below.

A. Agency Regulations and Policies

Headquarters Regulation 230-8 and Headquarters Handbook 230-1
prescribe the administrative procedures to be followed in the estab-
lishment, operation, and liquidation of proprietaries (see Appendix B).
An Administrative Plan (specifying the operational purpose, admini-
strative and management procedures, and cost) and a Liquidation Plan
(specifying details of liquidation and disposition of funds when
liquidation is contemplated) must both be coordinated among components
concerned and approved at appropriate management levels. This regu-

latory control along with policy memoranda are intended to assure

NW 50955 DocId:32423532 Paye 15


Fb eee

proper conduct by entities. Each Agency component involved is
responsible for compliance, and the Chief of thé Cover and Commercial
Staff, the Director of Finance, and the Comptroller are particularly
watchful in their areas of concern.

B. Project Reviews and Control

The controls and procedures applicable to each operating proprie-
tary are specified in a project outline and administrative plan
approved at the Deputy Director level. Normal control and administra-
tion is carried out by a project officer at Headquarters. Semi-annual
reviews are conducted to determine whether or not the operational
need still exists, and regular audits are performed to assure proper
management and financial accountability. Proprietaries are liquidated
as their usefulness ends; new ones are formed as needed.

C. Financial Controls/Operating Companies and Non-Operatin:

Gompanies Keeping Books of fccounts

Under Agency regulations, these proprietaries are established
and managed to appear to be consistent with normal commercial practices
and requirements of the type of enterprise concerned. Specific require~
ments for the general management and financial controls of each such
proprietary are provided in the administrative plan described above
which specifies the basic framework within which the instrumentality
is to operate’! All facets of an administrative plan relating to
funding the proprietary and its financial management are subject to
the concurrence of designated representatives of the Director of
Finance and the Comptroller. A primary purpose of this coordination

is to assure that the financial controls and procedures prescribed

HW 50955 DocId:32423532 Page 16


-~12-

for the proprietary are compatible and consistent with normal practices
and requirements for the type of instrumentality being established.
The Director of Finance representative is the Chief of the Commercial
Systems and Audit Division, a position normally occupied by a certi-
fied public accountant.
The initial and all subsequent passages of funds to such proprie-
‘taries are from the current year Agency operating budget. Receipts
of funds by the proprietary are documented as appropriate ostensibly
to appear to be from a source usual to a commercial enterprise of
similar type, e.g., capital stock, paid in capital, income from
ostensible sales, etc.
The Agency treats all disbursements to such proprietaries as
current year budgetary expenditures and concurrently establishes as
a control mechanism a fully reserved investment account which is
reconciled periodically to reported net worth of the proprietary as
reflected in required financial statements received from each proprie-
tary. Each such statement is reviewed to reconcile the approved
financial activity of the proprietary to reported changes in net
worth before adjusting the Agency investment account to conform with
the reported net worth.
All control documents evidencing Agency equity or interest in
the proprietary, e.g., executed stock certificates, irrevocable stock
powers, declaration of trust, etc., are held in safekeeping by the
Commercial Systems and Audit Division/OF provided that when such
documents need to be retained by the proprietary, a report will be
made to identify the documents retained, location, name of custodian and

reason for the retention, and copies of the documents, if appropriate.

HW 50955 DocId:32423532 Page 17


Biase ees

The Chief of the Agency Audit Staff is responsible for the audit
of Agency proprietaries, utilizing Audit Staff personnel under a
suitable cover arrangement or witting or unwitting public accounting
firms as is most appropriate to the requirements of a particular
proprietary. An example of the type of audit conducted appears at p. 105
Seetion VIIIand concerns MHMUTUAL, the proprietary insurance-investment

complex.

D. Financial Controls/Non-Operating Companies Except Those
Keeping Books of Account

Entities in this category are financed if financing is required
through the establishment of bank checking accounts on which Agency
officers have signatory power in alias. All such accounts are maintained
in the accounting records of the Agency as current asset accounts
subject to monthly reconciliation with statements of accounts issued
by the depository banks.

All passages of funds to these accounts add to the accountable
balance of the accounts. .No income is produced by these activities.
All disbursements from these accounts are charged as current expendi-
tures in liquidation of obligations of the operational activity on
behalf of which the entity was established.

Signatories are Agency officials who in each case execute a
declaration of trust acknowledging Government ownership of the account.
Payments are initiated only in response to request of an authorized
official responsible for the operational activity for which the
entity was established,

The Chief of the Agency's Audit Staff is responsible for the

audit of all accounts maintained for these entities.

NW 50955 DocId:32423532 Page 18


- 14 -

Balances of each of these accounts are monitored periodically
to assure that balances do not exceed a level warranted by the activity
for which the respective account was established. Balances excess
to current requirements and balances for entities which are dissolved
are returned to the Agency and in turn remitted to the U.S. Treasury
as Miscellaneous Receipts. (See discussion of Disposition of Funds
Returned from Proprietaries on p. 16.)

E. Treatment of Profits

The CIA General Counsel, in a 6 January 1958 memorandum, ruled
that “income of proprietaries, including profits, need not be considered
miscellaneous receipts to be covered into the Treasury but may be

used for proper corporate or company purposes. This subject was
reviewed and the opinion reaffirmed by the General Counsel in July
1965. The policy of retaining profits has continued, although as
already noted only a very few of Agency proprietaries have ever been
profitable. The CIA's legal basis for retaining profits for the use
of the operating corporate entities is discussed below.

Section 104 of the Government Corporations Control Act, 31 U.S.C.
849, provides that Congress shall enact necessary legislation to make
available for expenditure such corporate funds or other financial
resources or limiting the use thereof as the Congress may determine.
It is further provided that "this section shall not be construed as
preventing the Government corporations from carrying out and financing
their activities as authorized by existing law..." The legislative
history explaining this section of the act states that "in cases where

no other law required a congressional authorization of expenditures,

HW 50955 DocId:32423532 Paye 19


- 15 -

the corporation, if it had means of financing other than annual appro-
priations, could continue to operate in the absence of any action by
Congress on its budget program."' The statute creating a particular
Government corporation may provide specifically that the corporation
may use its profits in the conduct of its business.

The Government Corporations Control Act certainly did not contem-
plate Government corporations in the sense that the Agency must have
them. Neither is it feasible for Agency proprietaries to be created
by act of Congress or overseen precisely as provided for in the normal
Government corporation in the Act. Nevertheless, the Agency has felt
that the appropriate and reasonable policy would be to treat and control
them insofar as possible in accordance with the terms of that law.
Such being the case, the Agency believes there is no need to have more
restrictive rules applied to its corporations in the use of funds,
including profits, than are applied to Government Corporations under
the other Act or statutes. Thus, the use by a proprietary of its

. earnings to carry on its corporate affairs without an offset against
Agency appropriations is considered a legitimate practice and does not
constitute an illegal augmentation of appropriations.

With rare exception, principally the large air and insurance

_ proprietaries, operating proprietaries have not been self-sustaining
from bona fide income. Such income, including profits, as is received
is retained by the proprietaries consistent with the usual operating
practices of business enterprises.

The use of proprietaries' profits, however, is controlled. by

annual reviews and audits within the Agency of the total capital,

HW 50955 Docld:32423532 Page 20


- 16 -

investment, and profits situations of the corporations in the context
of the operational objectives and the cover needs of the corporations.
In effect the annual project review is based upon an audit as searching
as that required for statutory Government corporations.

F. Disposition of Funds Returned from Proprietaries

Any proprietary with funds excess to its current or foreseeable
needs is required to return such funds to the Agency. Also, all funds
realized from the liquidation or termination of a proprietary are
returned to the Agency except in a limited number of situations when
transferred to another proprietary for "similar use." On the basis
of an opinion of 3 February 1975 by the CIA General Counsel, the Agency
has revised its policy for the treatment of all returns of funds from
proprietaries; all such returns are to be remitted to the U.S. Treasury
as Miscellaneous Receipts. Prior to this change in policy, returns
had been treated as refunds of the previously recorded expenses up to
the amount of such expense for a particular proprietary with any excess
amounts returned to the Treasury as Miscellaneous Receipts (Appendix C)

G. Disposal of Proprietaries
Air America, the Agency's largest proprietary, at its peak had

total assets of some (who
accounted for more than 90 percent of the people employed directly

by all proprietaries). It is in the process of being liquidated
because it is no longer required. The Air America complex included

a number of other companies with the Pacific Corporation as the holding
company. The general plan for Liquidation of Air America is for the
Pacific Corporation to sell off Air America, Inc. and Air Asia, Ltd.

( the Taipei maintenance operation). A private New York firm (R. Dixon

NW 50955 DocId:32423532 Paye 21


ees by Jeers

Speas Company) was engaged to estimate a fair market value for the
complex. Although an intensive search for competitive bidders was

made, the Agency was unable to find buyers for any of the affiliated
companies except the Taipei maintenance facility. The sale of this
company as a going concern to the successful bidder was closed on

31 January 1975. The remaining parts of Air America are being
liquidated by sale of individual assets upon completion of existing
contracts. Funds realized from the sales could be as much as $25 million
and will be returned to the Treasury.

Agency financial support for Radio Liberty and Radio Free Europe,
both sizeable proprietaries, was terminated in FY 1971 and responsi-
bility for their funding and operation was assumed by the Department
of State.

Southern Air Transport was sold on 31 December 1973 because its
contingency capability was no longer needed. The Agency realized
$6,470,000 from this sale. Cash received was $3,345,000 which included
a $1.2 million award in arbitration of a dispute over the proceeds of
the sale of an aircraft by Southern Air Transport after the sale of
the company by the Agency. The balance was paid by the purchaser to
Air America to retire a debt owed by Southern Air Transport. A group
of employees of Southern Air Transport filed a civil action disputing
the propriety of the sale of the company by the Agency, but the case was
dismissed with prejudice on 17 July 1974.

A more detailed list of various disposals of smaller proprietaries
and what, if any, relationships remained thereafter between the Agency

and any subsequent entity appears infra page 39, Section V.

H. Relations with Tax, Regulatory, and Other Agencies

Management and control of proprietaries often requires "cooperative
interface" with outside agencies to gain beneficial working relation-
ships and, as necessary, any appropriate authorizations. These
relationships are described below.

For those proprietaries which maintain commercial books and other
financial records. U.S. and State tax returns are prepared annually by
commercial managers based on the corporation‘s financial records. For
other entities where only internal Agency records are maintained, tax
returns are prepared by Agency specialists in a manner to reflect the
normal operations of a bona fide commercial business. Close coordination
is maintained with the Internal Revenue Service, which is aware of the
Agency's use of proprietary commercial entities. In the event an Agency
entity is singled out for IRS audit, it has been agreed that the Agency,
through the Office of General Counsel, will notify IRS of Agency
ownership, The IRS then cancels the audit in order to conserve auditor
. manpower,

The Air proprietaries necessitated contact with the Civil Aeronautics
Board, the Federal Aviation Agency and the National Transportation
Safety Board. Specific problems were discussed, usually with the
Office of General Counsel of the agency concerned by the CIA General
Counsel.

The Air Proprietaries dealt with State Department and the Agency
for International Development, generally on a contractor/customer basis,
although senior personnel of those agencies were advised by the Agency

of its ownership of the companies.

Those proprietaries which engaged in the shipment of weapons
or other items on the Munitions Control list required Agency assistance
in obtaining the necessary export licenses. The ownership of the
companies was discussed with State Department Office of Munitions
Control and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tax and Firearms.

The radio proprietaries, while funded by CIA, did receive policy
guidance from the Department of State to ensure that their broadcasts
were in conformance with U.S. foreign policy.

The Agency has intervened with the Department of Labor on behalf
of survivors of employees of the proprietaries in order to assist
them in receiving the available benefits under the applicable Workmen's
Compensation Acts. i

The Agency, on behalf of the proprietaries, interceded with the
Defense Department to have the proprietaries’ contracts exempt from the
Renegotiation Board, There was a normal exemption based on the rules
of the Board which was given for contracts performed entirely outside
the United States.

CIA requested the Air Force to consider the interest of the Agency
in connection with the awarding of commercial contracts to its proprie-
taries. Initially this was done in the mid-1950's on the basis of a
policy decision by the Operations Coordination Board that the air
proprietary in the Far East, then operating at a deficit, was an
tnstrument of value to national security. The Agency was able to
maintain a standby capability without budget subsidies if awarded
enough business to support large commercial aircraft. This applied to

the passenger and cargo aircraft.

The U.S. Forest Service was advised of the ownership of a pro-
prietary and asked to award contracts to the proprietary in order to
help it develop a commercial posture and permit its aircraft to be

associated with that type of flying.

Iv. A DESCRIPTION OF THE VARIOUS PROPRIETARIES

The operational needs of the Agency have required it to venture
forth into many areas where proprietaries were a perceived necessary
vehicle. These areas have included air support, media publications,
proprietary management (accounting and management), insurance (personal
insurance coverage, annuity coverages, and escrow account maintenance
for agent personnel), covert procurement (general merchandise, arms,
ammunition and police related equipment), cover support (commercial
cover, such as management consultant firms, importing companies, travel
agencies, energy research organizations, behavior psychology companies),
personnel services (tape transcription, personnel investigations for
security clearances and approvals, public accounting firms, electoral
and political analysis firm keyed into foreign elections), operational
support (purchase of condominiums in foreign countries, sporting goods
business in United States with sales in Latin America, various overseas
foundations to provide grants, export/import firms, a company which
holds a note for certain U.S. Government funds borrowed by a consortium
of aluminum companies for the extraction of bauxite in Guinea to insure
U.S. control of bauxite extraction aétivities in Guinea), and various
other miscellaneous categories.

The number of employees of proprietaries as of October 30, 1975

Of this number, were U.S. Agency employees, 178 were U.S.
proprietary hires, and 65 were foreign proprietary hires. The various
types of funding and payrolling mechanisms used by the Agency (Devised
Facilities incorporated’ in the U.S.; Devised Facilities-Notionals which

HW 50955 Docld:32423532 Page 26


~ 22 -

are not incorporated but are sole proprietorships; and Notionals,
which are merely business names, are not formally constituted or
registered which do business at the address of an answering service
or witting attorney) totaled 326 as of October 31, 1975. There were
31 Devised Facilities, 67 Devised Facilities-Notionals, and 228
Notionals.

There follows a list of some of these proprietaries with brief
descriptions of their functions. There are 97 in number. Following
that list is a description of the major headquarters-controlled proprie-
taries provided as of September 24, 1975. In addition, there is
included a listing of all proprietaries during the period 1952 through
1974 (total 399) with the highest net equity balance on agency records
and the net worth balance as of December 31, 1974. The smallest net
worth balance is $400 and the largest is $31,778,000.

The year 1967 was selected to demonstrate the number of employees
in use by Agency proprietaries. In that year, the Agency owned approxi-
mately 158 proprietaries. These proprietaries employed approximately

persons. Ninety-two percent of the employees were accounted

for by three proprietary complexes as follows:

JBGREED

TPTONIC

QRACTIVE
TPTONIC and QRACTIVE (Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty) were turned
over to the Department of State and are now being managed by the Board
of International Broadcasters. The JBGREED complex (air support

capability in the Far East) is in the process of liquidation and

FUNDING AND PAYROLLING MECHANISMS

1. The various types of Funding and Payrolling Mechanisms used by
the Agency are described below:

a. Devised Facilities--Those Agency-owned and managed mechanisms
which are incorporated in U.S. jurisdictions (various States) with
nominee stockholders and are used to provide nonofficial cover pay-
roll support to Agency assets who do not have to show highly visible
cover employment. They are also used for other nonofficial cover
support tasks such as funding of proprietary organizations. No
books of account are maintained but annual tax returns are prepared
by Headquarters specialists in a manner to make it appear that the
mechanism is conducting normal commercial business. Since the tax
return cannot be substantiated from commercial records, the Internal |
Revenue Service (IRS) must be notified of Agency interest in the
entity in the event of a proposed IRS audit. Management, including
direct control of the corporate bank accounts, is effected by
specialists at Headquarters. Funds are transferred from Headquarters

i to the bank account of each.entity in amounts and at. times necessary
to meet funding obligations; otherwise, minimum balances are main-
tained in the accounts to keep them open.

b. Devised Facilities-Notionals--Those Agency-owned and managed
mechanisms similar to Devised Facilities except that the mechanisms

administrative procedures are used as for Devised Facilities.

c. Notionals--Those Agency-owned and managed mechanisms which
are merely busine: business names (not formally constituted or registered)
which ostensibly do business at the address of an answering service
or witting attorney. Operating officials are usually fictitious
and management is effected by specialists at Headquarters. These
entities are generally used as funding attribution for monies paid
to bona fide corporations in reimbursement of cover costs for Agency
assets, and they are’ also used to fund proprietary organizations.

The same administrative procedures are used as for Devised Facilities.

is as follows:

Vv. THE DISPOSAL OF AGENCY PROPRIETARIES -
a) An Overview

The Agency has emphasized the degree to which the extensive
proprietary system it has maintained in the past has been disposed
of in recent years. Indeed, according to the current Chief of the
Cover and Commercial Staff, at least in so far as large proprietaries
are concerned, "because of multitudinous reasons they will be viewed
as the solution of last resort."* Size was a problem and made it
“inevitable that cover would not last." Moreover, there simply is
not a need, according to the Agency, for the kind of capabilities
supplied by an Air America either now or in the foreseeable future.
In this regard, the Agency has indicated that no "real proprietaries"
are in planning because there are no such operational requirements
before the Cover and Commercial Staff (hereafter "CCS"). But the

Committee has learned from its study that the Agency retains the

* As William E. Nelson, Deputy Director of Operations, noted recently
to the Rockefeller Commission:

I think by and large that the day of the big proprietary
is over. We have attempted over the past few years to
try to squeeze down on those kinds of proprietaries and
I think we have really gone now to a fairly small number,
and a fairly tightly controlled group of proprietaries
who are doing legitimate operational jobs, particularly
in the media field.

Our experience with proprietaries in the past has been
if left by themselves, they tend to absorb larger and
larger amounts of government money and are not particu-
larly for a business. They. are not very viable in the
business sense and quickly become suspect as not having
any commercial validity. And we have, I think in the
past ten years, we have in this past ten years gotten
rid of an enormous number of proprietaries in this field.
I don't foresee us getting in the immediate future into
any expansion of that proprietary record. I think we
are about right in terms of where we are now.

HW 50955 DocId:32423532 Page 63

capability "in being" to create even large proprietaries.* More-
over, numerous "shelf" corporations are kept available to provide
cover. These latter entities are generally only of the notional
variety and pose no threat either competitively or in terms of
domestic activity beyond the Agency's charter. Nonetheless, the
Agency has emphasized the need to retain this general vehicle for
at least one purpose: to retain assets. The CCS has indicated
that a method is needed to keep "good men" who are loyal, but who
need continuing work in both their ordinary and also somewhat
byzantine fields. Consequently, proprietaries offer a viable alter-
native to solve this dilemma of maintaining assets.

As a result of this, the Committee studied which proprietaries
had been sold or otherwise disposed of during the period from 1965
to 1975.. It sought to find out which of those proprietaries so dis~
posed of in the last ten years maintained a significant relationship
with the Agency by contract or informal understanding for any purpose.
More specifically, the Committee sought answers to the following
questions:

(1) How many proprietaries, by type or function, have been

dissolved or sold as a going enterprise or otherwise
disposed of by the Agency?

* Mr. Nelson closed his recent testimony with a caveat:

I can visualize, however, depending on what happens to
the Agency in the future, the possibility that we might
want to use more proprietaries, particularly in the
field of cover if this gets terribly tight or terribly
difficult. But the average operational purpose, except
for some of these media operations, all we need is cover
and I think that most of the proprietaries that we have
fall into that category.

AW 50955 Docld:32423532 Page 64


- 61 -

(2) How many proprietaries have been sold, or their assets
sold, to persons, or a group including persons, who
had previously served as directors, officers or
employees of the proprietaries?

(3) In how many instances were proprietaries sold pursuant
to a written agreement, or an unwritten agreement or
understanding, that the purchased proprietary, any
successor entity or the parties purchasing the proprie-
tary's assets would provide the Agency with goods,
services or other assistance? In each case, indicate
the nature of the business involved, whether the agree-
ment was written or, if unwritten, the way it is
reflected in Agency files, and the amounts of any
specific business volume, retainers or financial support
agreed to in connection with the proprietary's transfer.
This request covers both firm contracts for the provision
of goods and services and general agreements that the
parties acquiring the proprietary or its assets would
provide them, at the Agency's option, if requested to
do so. i

(4) In how many instances did the parties acquiring the
proprietary in fact subsequently provide goods, services
or other assistance to the Agency, whether or not there
was a written or informal agreement of such a relation-
ship at the time the proprietary or its assets were
acquired from the Agency? Indicate for each instance
the nature of the business, the dollar amounts of the
transactions involved and the period of years during
which they occurred.

Our study revealed that during the indicated period 209 proprie-
taries were dissolved, sold or otherwise disposed of, thus substan-
tiating the Agency's claim that it had moved decisively to extricate
itself from this area of activity.* But in a very real sense it is
nearly impossible to evaluate whether a "link" still exists between

the Agency and a former asset related to a proprietary because

* ‘The Agency's Office of Finance originally compiled a list of 305
eryptonyms of “entities" which were dropped from Office of Finance
records at Headquarters during the period 1965-1975. Nineteen (19)
other entities were added from other Agency divisions. Later this
list was reconciled with other Agency records to eliminate cryptonym
changes and other administrative actions not related to the actual
disposal of a proprietary organization. Ultimately, these admini-
strative "eliminations" totaled 115.

circumstances can be conceived of whereby even though formal and
informal Agency ties are discontinued, social and other ties remain.
The impact of such liaisons is difficult to assess. The following

entities were dissolved during the referenced period:

: ~ There follows a description of the disposition of, entities
_ sold or otherwise disposed of during the referenced period. Twenty-
nine (29) of the entities were sold or given to witting individuals
(former officers, employees, managers, contractors, etc.) Five (5)
were sold or given to witting individuals who had no formal rela-
tionship with the proprietary. Ten (10) proprietaries continued to.
provide goods or services to the Agency after the disposal. Thirty-
four (34) proprietaries did not continue to provide goods or services
to the Agency after disposal. In nine (9) instances the provision
or offer to provide goods or services were formal or informal condi-
tions of the sale or gift. In thirty-seven (37) instances this was
not the case. Six (6) proprietaries were sold to unwitting individuals
or organizations and thus no provision for services or goods was indi-
a) cated: Several miscellaneous dispositions developed which did not
fit neatly into any of the above categories. For example, there
was one merger of an Agency proprietary. with another Agency proprie-
tary. In two instances the Agency retained a non-proprietary rela-
tionship with a former employee. On two occasions the Agency turned
over proprietaries to other government departments and on one occasion
“it sold a proprietary to another government department. There were
several instances where the Agency gave the assets of a proprietary
after liquidation (books, materials, etc.) to previously uncompensated
participants in the various ventures. On occasion, the corporate
shells were given to attorneys in lieu of fees for dissolution. Some
participants were permitted to retain proceeds of sales in order to

continue the original effort of the particular proprietary. And

DISPOSITION OF ENTITIES SOLD OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF* cae

* WUSHINE/WUGAZELLE - The six air proprietaries in the WUSHINE and
WUGAZELLE comptexes were sold as a package in 1969
to a group of witting U.S. businessmen who had
acted as nominee officers, directors, and stock-
holders for the companies in the WUSHINE complex.
Although the group offered to provide cover and/
or air support to the Agency after the sale, this
offer was not made a condition of the sale, and
no understanding or contract was negotiated for
prospective purchase of goods or services or
cover support. To date, the proprietaries sold
have not been used by the Agency.

ZRCREST - These two air proprietary entities were sold in
1974 to the businessman who managed both entities
during the period of Agency ownership. No agree-
ments for the continued use of the entities sold
were negotiated or implied at the time of sale,
and, to date, no subsequent use has been made
of the entities by the Agency.

This air proprietary was sold in 1968 to the
witting businessman who managed the entity
during the period of Agency ownership. No
agreement for the continued use of the entity
sold was negotiated or implied at the time of
sale, and, to date, no subsequent use has been
made of the entity by the Agency.

WUHARPY - This air proprietary (parts procurement) was
sold in 1965 after all assets had been removed
(a corporate shell) to the witting group of
businessmen from which the entity was originally
purchased. No agreement for the continued use
of the entity sold was negotiated or implied
at the time of sale, and, to date, no subsequent
use has been made of the entity by the Agency.

This air proprietary entity was sold in 1972 to
an unwitting, bona fide airline company. No
agreement for the continued use of the entity

IUQUEST/IUABATE/IUPAGAN - Substantial assets of these two IUQUEST air
proprietary entities were sold in 1975 to a
bona fide aviation company which was made witting
for purposes of the sale. No agreement was nego-
tiated or implied at the time of sale for Agency
use or purchase of goods or services from the
company which purchased the assets. To date, no
goods or services have been purchased from the
buyer. The entities were subsequently liquidated.

WUSAXA/WUACUTE - This air proprietary entity was sold in 1971 to
an unwitting businessman. No agreement for con-
tinued use of the entity by the Agency was negoti-
ated or implied at the time of sale, and, to date,
no such use has been made of the entity.

WUBEVY - This proprietary, which published travel guides
and was used as cover for Agency officers world-
wide, was sold in 1968 to the editor of the
travel guides. The editor was an Agency employee
and retired at the time of the sale. No agree-
ment was negotiated or implied for the continuing
use of the entity after sale. To date, no goods
or services have been purchased from the entity
by the Agency. Fae

POEARLY - This proprietary entity, which provided status
and access cover for several case officers in
the Far East, was sold in 1975 to unwitting

purchasers.. There have been no Agency contacts 6
with the purchaser since then, All sale pro- pele
ceeds were returned to the Agency. ae
CALANCET - This proprietary, which provided cover support iaitae
in Europe, was sold in 1965 to a witting, bona a

fide company which provided technical assistance
and marketing support to the proprietary during
the period of Agency ownership. No agreement meee
was negotiated or implied for prospective use
of the entity by the Agency, and no such use
was made by the Agency. The bona fide company,
did, however, continue to provide cover for
Agency officers in other areas and under offices
not related to the former proprietary's business

activities.
STFANWEED/STDOLLAR == This proprietary was an import-export firm which
sererans provided cover for one Agency employee in the
REC \ ie FROM Far East. The entity was sold to the Agency
Uy employee in 1966 at the time of his retirement

Der from the Agency. No agreement was negotiated

(continued) purchase of goods or services, and, to date,
no such use has been made of the entity.
STYMYSTIC - This small proprietary, which provided cover for

one Agency employee in the Far East, was liqui-
dated in 1974. A covert relationship has con-
tinued with the owner of the parent company of
which the Agency proprietary was a subsidiary.
The owner provides cover in the parent company
for another Agency employee, and the parent
company moved into the premises vacated by the
subsidiary and was allowed to take over fixtures eo
and a rental deposit at no cost.

MIHELEN - This proprietary, which provided cover for one
Agency case officer in the Far East, was sold
in 1974 to two local-hire employees of the firm.
All Agency connections with the firm were severed
at the time of sale.

MIPACT/MICOUNCIL - This proprietary, which provided cover for one ,
Agency employee, was sold in 1970 to the un- ie
witting members of its Board of Directors. 4
At the time of sale ali Agency connections
with the entity were severed.

MHTHROW - This proprietary (part of the insurance complex)
was formed for the purpose of purchasing an
apartment overseas which was used for operational
purposes. When the apartment was no longer of
operational use in 1970, the company (and the
apartment) was sold to a non-Agency connected
party. No agreement for the continued use of
the corporation or the apartment was made with
the purchaser, and, to date, no such use has
been-made of the entity or the apartment.

MHMATTE - This proprietary (part of the insurance complex)
was established to purchase an apartment overseas
of operational interest to the Agency. When the
apartment was no longer needed for operational
purposes in 1970, the corporation (and the
apartment) was sold to a non-Agency connected
party. No agreement for the continued use of

This proprietary was established for the use of
the insurance complex, but it was never activated.
The corporate shell was sold in 1974 to the un-
witting attornies who served as resident agents.
No agreement was made with the purchaser for

the continued use of the entity, and, to date,

no such use has been made of the entity.

This air proprietary was merged with another
air proprietary (ZRCLIFF) in 1968.

This air proprietary was sold to the businessman

who managed the proprietary during the period
of Agency ownership on the condition that the
Agency would buy back the proprietary if the
contract which sustained the proprietary was
not renewed by USAID. The USAID contract was
not renewed, and the businessman dissolved the
entity on behalf of the Agency in 1968.

This air proprietary was disposed of by trans-
ferring all assets to another air proprietary

and turning over the corporate shell to two
unwitting foreign. national nominees. No agreement
with the nominees for the purchase of goods or :
services subsequent to the turn over was negotiated ke.
or implied, and, to date, no use has been made of ade
the entity by the Agency.

This proprietary was established in the Far East
by two foreign agents of the Agency to provide
support services for Agency-sponsored air opera-
tions. The company failed, at least partly due
to embezzlement by the two agents, and was
liquidated apparently in late 1962 or early 1963.
The Agency station in the country involved

the two agents who were politically significant
for some time after the liquidation. The re-
lationship was non-proprietary.

This proprietary was involved in support of air
activities for a-large Agency paramilitary
program in Africa. At such time as the program
was concluded, all assets were removed from
the company, and the corporate shell was given
to the attorney who established the entity in
lieu of paying his prospective fee for dissolv-
ing the corporation.

This proprietary, which provided cover support
for one Agency officer in the Far East, was
abandoned when the country was overrun by
Communist forces. The assets left behind will
be written off.

This proprietary, non-profit organization was
turned over to its management in 1967 when the
Agency withdrew its support to the entity. No
further Agency support has been given to the
entity, and the management intended to continue
the program with private and USAID support.

This proprietary non-profit, medical organiza-
tion was disposed of.in 1967 by transfer of
all of its assets to the witting Board of
Directors for continuation without Agency
support. No further Agency support was given
to the entity.

This proprietary, non-profit entity was dis-
posed of in 1968 when ail assets were turned
over to the witting trustees who intended to
continue the operation with private support.
No further support was given to the entity
by the Agency.

This foreign proprietary research institute
was disposed of in‘1967, at which time the
Institute was surge funded to permit it to
continue operations for approximately two years
while a search was made for private funds to
enable continuation of the Institute or permit
its orderly liquidation. In mid-1969, the
Institute ceased its activity since sufficient
private funds could not be located to fund
Institute programs. No Agency support was
provided after 1967.

This proprietary entity published an English
language periodical in the Near East. The
publishing rights plus certain assets were
sold to indigenous purchasers and the proceeds
of sale were used to pay off corporate liabilities
prior to dissolution of the entity. Since the
periodical continued to publish articles which
coincided with U.S. objectives for the area
concerned, the Agency provided limited support
to the new owners to enable them to continue
the publication.

This proprietary publishing firm in the Far

East provided cover support for one Agency
employee who introduced foreign books and articles.
to Far Eastern media sources. In 1975 the firm
was de-registered and certain assets were sold

to a former employee of the firm who re-registered
the firm under a different name. The Agency
employee who was provided cover by the entity is
still active in the Far East under a new cover

and the only contact with the purchaser is in

the interest of maintaining the cover story of

the active Agency employee. No support is

being extended to the re-registered entity. om

This activity provides support to a foreign
based asset to permit him to publish a foreign

and inappropriately categorized as a proprietary
when an Administrative Plan was prepared in 1971.
The error was corrected in 1975 when the activity
was accurately categorized as a controlled sub-
sidy. The operation continues with Agency
subsidy support.

The U.S. proprietary portion of this book pub-
lishing activity was legally liquidated in
1968. Funds remaining after settlement of all
liabilities were transferred overseas to other
parts of the operation and were used to meet
approved operational expenses. Some of the
remaining stock of foreign language books was
given to a cleared and witting contact who had
served without compensation as an officer of

This proprietary, which provided management and
accounting services for Agency activities in
Europe, was disposed of in 1974 by removal of
all assets from the entity and transfer of the
corporate shell to the U.S. businessman who had
backstopped the company without compensation.
No support has been given to the entity or use
made thereof by the Agency.

LADYCHAPEL - This proprietary was established to purchase an
apartment building in Europe for Agency office
and residential use. In 1968, then the build-
ing was of no further use to the Agency, the
entity with the apartment building was ostensibly
given to the Department of State as a gift.

The Department actually reimbursed the Agency
for the building in Washington. The Agency, m
on behalf of the Department, is attempting to

liquidate the company. This is complicated
by a disputed foreign tax claim.

WUTACTIC/WUDOLLOP - This operational support mechanism had no assets
at the time of its disposal in 1971, and the
corporate shell was turned over to the attorney
who established the company in lieu of payment
of his prospective fee for dissolving the
entity.

Disposition of Entities Sold or Otherwise Disposed Of:

JBARGON - This air support proprietary (maintenance facility)
was sold in January 1975 to a bona fide aviation
concern which was made witting of the Agency's
ownership of the firm for purposes of the sale.

At the time of sale, it was agreed that JBARGON
would continue to provide aircraft maintenance,
supply, and bookkeeping services to JBCHOKE, the
former parent company of JBARGON. Since the date
of sale, JBARGON has provided $612,000 worth of.
aircraft maintenance, supply, and bookkeeping
services to JBCHOKE; JBCHOKE is now in the process
of liquidation.

DEINHAUL - This proprietary lending institution (bank) was
. established in a European country in 1955 to

provide loans and outright grants to non-communist
cooperatives. The proprietary was ostensibly owned
(backstopped) by a bona fide U.S. foundation which
was subsidized by the Agency, and the bank was
managed by a bona fide management company on behalf
of the Agency. By 1962 when it was determined
that the bank had accomplished its purposes, the
Special Group (predecessor to the 40 Committee)
instructed that the bank be phased out in an orderly
manner over the next five years. Various disposal

plans were considered over the next few years, aq
and in 1965 the Agency sold the bank (through its Pps
ostensible owner--the foundation) to the firm ae

which managed the bank during the period of Agency
ownership. In payment, the foundation accepted
notes from the management firm, payable over a

four year period. It was expected that the payments
of the purchase price would come from the proceeds
derived from the repayment of various types of
loans made by the bank, and it was recognized that
certain unsecured bank loans were of questionable
collectibility. Accordingly, that portion of

the purchase price which was tied to the repayment
of these loans was subject to adjustment for litiga-
tion expenses associated with collection and a 20%
collection fee.. Also, this portion of the purchase
price was not subject to interest on the unpaid
balance. It was also agreed that the bank would
administer a fund of $100,000 set aside by the
Agency for continuing grants in less than $25,000
amounts for Agency approved activities which were

in concert with the original objectives of the pro-
ject.. In 1967 under the terms of the Katzenbach
Report, it was necessary for the Agency to discon-
tinue its support to the bona fide U.S.: foundation
(ostensible former owner of the bank as mentioned
above) which had acted as a collection agent for
the sale proceeds. Incident to the Agency's dis-
engagement from support of the foundation, the
foundation was allowed to keep all proceeds from
ee payments on the purchase price for the
ank.

This travel service proprietary was sold in 1975
to an Agency employee at the time of his retirement.
This individual had ostensibly owned the firm but
in fact only managed it for the Agency. No agree-
ment was negotiated for the continued use of the
travel service by the Agency, however, the Agency
was using the travel service at the time of sale
largely for the purchase of airline tickets for
travel in support of sensitive projects. This
practice still continues, and it is estimated
that Agency business represents about 30% of the
gross airline ticket sales of the entity on an
annual basis.

The Agency owned 50% of the equity in this foreign
entity which constructed low.cost housing in one
of the less developed countries of the world.

The Agency's equity was sold to- WUPESKY, a private
company which. provided cover for an Agency employee
who managed the Agency's foreign low cost housing
program. No agreement was made with WUPESKY for
the subsequent purchase of services or products
of WUSWAMP, and no such purchases were made.
Nevertheless, WUPESKY continued to provide cover
for the Agency Employee until 1973.

This proprietary was a non-profit organization
which undertook high risk scientific research
programs in support of Government sponsored
reconnaissance programs. In 1966, the Agency
decided ‘to terminate its proprietary relationship
with. the entity and it was determined that,
because of the charter of non-profit organizations,
any proceeds from the liquidation would have to
be given to other non-profit organizations or
foundations. Accordingly, the plant and equipment
were sold to a profit making corporation which
created a subsidiary around the assets purchased.
The proceeds of the sale were distributed among

several non-profit organizations. under Agency
control. An unwritten condition of the sale was
that the Agency would contract with the,new organizi-
ation for scientific research of interest to the
Agency in the amount of about $900,000 over an
eighteen month period. Only about $770,000 was so
committed, and all Agency relations with the
successor organization were terminated in 1968.

This media type proprietary provided cover for

an Agency employee who arranged for a foreign
motion picture firm run by am American to produce
and distribute foreign language films throughout
Latin America. For funding purposes, the proprie-
tary borrowed working capital from another prop-.
rietary, LPBERRY/A, and paid production and

-distribution costs in anticipation of a return

on the proceeds of film distribution. The prop-
rietary was dissolved in 1961, and all rights to
the net profits of distribution were assigned

to LPBERRY/A in return for cancellation of the
note it held from the proprietary. After much
wrangling with the American owner of the film
production and distribution company, it became
evident that appropriate reports were not being
submitted covering recoupments or net profits
and the Agency negotiated a settlement which pro-
vided that LPBERRY/A and the distribution company
would render no further claims against each other.
Relations eased at that point.

This media proprietary compiled, published, and
distributed a newsletter overseas. In 1975,
when the Agency withdrew its support, it was
decided to discontinue the publication activity,
and the assets of the company were turned over
to AMHIM/1, the editor and manager, to enable
him to maintain a status independent of the
Agency as a commercial print shop.

This proprietary radio broadcasting activity was
turned over to the Department of State for support
and subsequently placed under the control of the
Board of International Broadcasters for continued
opener with Congressional support.

This media type proprietary which was -involved in radio
and TV projects was established in 1963 and continued

to its manager with full expectation of continued

operation with heavy Agency subsidy. At the time

of sale, substantial funds were removed, from the. zed
entity leaving it without sufficient working St
capital. Consequently, the Agency arranged ‘for

funds removed from the entity. Subsequently,

the manager, with Agency permission, sold the
entity to a group of foreign nationals. The
manager formed his own corporation which contracted
with the Agency for services including the continued
management of the company sold of which he was still
president. A management dispute resulted in the
removal of the manager from the first corporation
and the bank seized the guarantee for the Tine

of credit which had been drawn down and used as
working capital for the first entity. The manager,
no longer supported by the Agency, is the channel
through which the Agency is to receive repayment

of loans which arose out of the line of credit.

So far, the Agency has received. no payments.

These three proprietary. entities were part of a
substantial radio broadcasting activity which
was turned over to the Department of State for
support and subsequently placed under the control
of the Board of International Broadcasters for
continued operation with Congressional support.

This U.S. foundation type proprietary served as

a funding. mechanism for a labor organization
supported by the Agency. In 1968 all assets

plus a termination-grant were turned over to the
group of U.S. businessmen who backstopped the
Agency entity. All Agency funds destined for the
labor union were transferred to that organization,
and the Agency created a foreign funding company
(QaSPIDERY utilizing the same businessmen to
continue support to the union. The foreign entity
is still in being, although inactive, and will

be dissolved after all tag end negotiations are
concluded with the former management of the Tabor
organization which continues in revised form
without Agency support.

This proprietary non-profit entity was supported
by the Agency until. December 1974 when all Agency
funds were withdrawn and the furniture and. fixtures

b) THE SALE OF SOUTHERN AIR TRANSPORT, INC.: A CASE
STUDY IN DISPOSAL OF A CIA PROPRIETARY :

BACKGROUND

Southern Air Transport Incorporated (SAT) is a U.S. Air Carrier,
incorporated in the State of Florida on October 31, 1949. From its
inception until its purchase in 1960 by the Central Intelligence
Agency (CIA), it was privately owned by Messrs. Fredrick C. Moor
and Stanley G. Williams. It was purchased by the CIA on August 5,
1960, and owned by the CIA through December 31, 1973. CIA sold the
firm back to Mr. Williams on December 31, 1973.

The decision to acquire Southern Air Transport was triggered by
a change in the regulations governing the award of Military Air Trans-
port Service (MATS) contracts. On April l, 1960, Air America (AAM)
had begun flying a seven-month MATS contract operating out of Tachikawa
AFB in Japan, to other Pacific locations. In June of 1960, the De-
partment of Defense (DOD) and the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) changed
the regulations governing the awarding of MATS contracts to require :
that bidders hold at least a Supplemental Certificate of Convenience
and Necessity for an Air Carrier and that they participate in the.
Civil Reserve Air Fleet Program (CRAF). ‘Air America did not meet
either of these new criteria and could not obtain appropriate waivers
to them. The Air America heavy airlift capability represented an
asset for use by the U.S. Government in future operational contin-
gencies throughout the Far East area. Loss of the MATS contract

would result in under utilization of aircraft and air crews and the

NW 50955 DocId:32423532 Paye 94


HW 509955

MATS contract revenues were needed to sustain these assets. Therefore,
it was proposed that either AAM should obtain the necessary certi-
fication.or that the Agency should buy another commercial firm that
already held these certifications. The October 1, 1960, contract
date and the need for public hearings and lengthy proceedings mili-
tated against AAM applying for the certificate themselves. Also,
again in order to avoid lengthy public hearings, which would be time-
consuming and generate public exposure, it was decided that the
ownership of the company to be acquired must be kept completely
separate from AAM. This solution was concurred in by the CAB, the
bOD, the CIA, and AAM management.

It was anticipated that if the new company were awarded the
ongoing MATS contract, it would actually perform the flying service
but would use equipment under conditional sale from AAM and would
employ personnel transferred from AAM. Under inter-company agree-
ments Air America would provide all maintenance work, ground handling,
and other services for which it would be reimbursed by the new
company. “In this way, Air America would share in the revenues
generated by the MATS contracts.

The proposal to purchase a supplemental carrier and operate
it under the above arrangement was approved by Allen Dulles as
Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) on July 15, 1960. Funds
from the Clandestine Services budget for FY 61 were made available
for the purchase.

After World War II there had-been over 200 supplemental carriers

5 America management made a survey of the 18 and determined that
Southern ‘Air Transport in Miami, Florida was the most attractive

as a purchase possibility. It operated two C-46s.-- one owned, one
leased -- between Miami and points in the Caribbean and South
America. Its associated company owned the foureacre property on
which SAT was located. Moreover, it operated at a modest profit
and had no long-term debts.

Negotiations for the purchase of SAT were successful and on
August 5; 1960, the CIA exchanged $307,506.10 for all outstanding
shares of capital stock of SAT and its real property owning affil-
iate. The Agency owned these shares in the name of Roger C. Hyatt,
a former board member of Air America. Mr. Hyatt together with
Percival Brundage and Perkins McGuire were added to the SAT board
of directors.

Under CIA management Southern Air Transport operated with two
semi-autonomous divisions: the Pacific Division and the Atlantic
Division. The Pacific Division performed the MATS contract and
supported Agency heavylift requirements in East Asia. The Atlantic
Division continued to operate in the Caribbean and South America;
doing the same sort of flying SAT had done prior to Agency acquisi-
tion. The Atlantic Division was also able to furnish certain support
for the Cuban and Congo operations. At the peak of its activities,
the SAT fleet, comprised of both owned and leased aircraft, included

Douglas DC-6, Boeing 727, and Lockheed L-100 Hercules aircraft.

THE SALE
5 In 1972 it became apparent that the Agency's air capabilities”
were becoming excess to its needs, and that political realities
and future operational requirements in the post-war era of Southeast
Asia would not require large air proprietary assets. On April ya ts
1972, the Director of Central Intelligence approved in principle
the divestiture of CIA ownership and control of the Air America
complex and Southern Air Transport. He approved recommendations
calling for Air America to be retained until the end of the war in
Southeast Asia, the immediate elimination of the Pacific Division
of SAT, the sale of the two 727 aircraft leased to SAT by Air America,
and subsequent divestiture of Agency ownership and control of the
remainder of SAT.* Specific note was made that conflict of interest
should be avoided and that no employee should receive a windfall

benefit as a result of these transactions,**

In May 1972, Agency officials and Lawrence Houston)
met with the Chairman of the Civil Aeronautics Board, Secor D. Browne,
and his Administrative Assistant, Edwin Rector, to seek informal
advice as to the best way to disengage from SAT. Three alternatives
were discussed: (1) dissolve the company and sell the assets;

(2) sell the assets to the current operators of the company; (3) sell

SAT to, or merge SAT into, one of the other supplemental carriers.

* The Director determined that 'we no longer should retain air proprie-
taries purely for contingent requirements and that on the record, there-
fore, the Agency should divest itself of the Southern Air Transport
complex entirely. He stated the opinion that the desirable course of
action would be dissolution, although he realized that the problems
were many and complex. Also, he did not rule out other solutions

which might achieve the end and yet better satisfy the interests of

all concerned:

** A condition imposed by the DCI was that"in the disposition of any
of the assets involved nothing inure to the benefit of Agency employees

been or is of such a nature as might raise a question of conflict of

The CAB chairman discouraged option (3) because it would involve
=) public hearings and would be subject to criticism by the other supple-
mentals. Option (1), although least troublesome from the legal and
exposure standpoints, would further reduce the shrinking number of
U.S. supplementals (by 1972, there were only eleven supplemental
carriers left) and would be unfair to SAT employees. The CAB
officials had no problem with option (2). on/3\May 1972, the DCL
was presented with the results of the meeting with the CAB chairman.
He approved the recommendation to explore the sale of the equity in
SAT to the current management. It was noted that SAT had been operat~
ing as a supplemental carrier for 25 years, none of the employees of
SAT had ever been an employee of the Agency and that both the Depart-
ment of Defense and the, chairman of the CAB considered it in their
best interests to keep SAT as a viable carrier rather than dissolving
m) the company and selling the assets. The rationale behind selling
SAT intact to its management was:
a. Liquidation would deprive the U.S. of a useful air carrier
and would be unfair to the employees.
b. Sale of SAT as a going concern on the open market would gene-
rate an unacceptable level of public interest and scrutiny. A
publicly advertised disposition would run contrary to the Director's
statutory mandate to protect intelligence sources and methods.
ce. Although a potential for conflict of interest and windfall
profit existed, sale of SAT to its management would best
satisfy the requirements of everyone involved. ;
The DCI was, apparently, allowed this flexibility in method of
5 disposal by statute. 40 U.S.C. § 474(17) provides that nothing in

’ the regulations relating to disposal of surplus government property

MW 50955 Docld:32423532 Page 98


>) shall affect any authority of the CIA. In addition, 50 U.S.C. §
403(d)(5) provides that the Director of Central Intelligence is
responsible for protecting intelligence sources and methods from
unauthorized disclosure. It was determined that sale of SAT stock
to Mr. Williams in a confidential manner would best prevent damage

to national security and foreign relations of the United States which
could result from disclosure of CIA ownership.

Agency officials began exploring ways in which SAT could be sold
to its management without permitting a windfall to accrue to the
buyer and in a way that could not be construed as a conflict of
interest. To establish a reasonable selling price, the Agency asked
the Certified Public Accounting firm of Lybrand, Ross Brothers and

Montgomery (now doing business as Coopers & Lybrand) to perform a

» valuation study. They in turn engaged R. Dixon Speas Associates,
Inc., aviation consultants, to establish an evaluation for the
aircraft. The following values were developed:

a. Book Value of SAT $3.9 million
b, Estimated Total Value of SAT
Capital Stock on Open Market $2.645 million
¢. Disposal as going concern $2.1 million
_d. Liquidation Value $1.25 million
e. Agency Investment - $1.5 million
Based on these figures, the Executive Director-Comptroller on
August 17, 1972, approved an asking price of $2.7 million. Sale
at this price to the management would require simultaneous payment
= in full of the $3.2 million note payable to Air America through

NW 50955 DocId:32423532 Page 99


Actus Technology (as the associated land holding company had been

&
NX

renamed) and would not include any equity in the Peale purchase
agreement between SAT and Air America for a Lockheed L 100-30
Hercules aircraft. Although this $2.7 million price was less than
the $3.9 million book value, it did exceed the fair market value of
the company as calculated by professional appraisers. The appraisals
were based not on depreciated purchase prices for assets, as reflected
in book values, but rather on either the earning power of the: assets
adjusted to "present value" or the current resale value for all
assets.

On August 23, 1972, Mr. Williams was advised of the asking price
for SAT of $2.7 million for the acquisition of stock and $3.2 million
for payment of debt to Air America or a total of $5.9 million. A

‘ deadline date of October 1, 1972, was established; otherwise Mr.
Williams was advised that the firm would be dissolved and the assets
liquidated. Although Mr. Williams contended the asking figure should
be reduced since the outstanding loan to Air America had been reduced
since the date of the study by Coopers & Lybrands, Mr. Williams stated
he would attempt to work out financing within the deadline date of
October 1, 1972. This deadline was extended by the Agency to

December 4, 1972.
On December 5, 1972, Mr. Williams submitted an offer for SAT of

$5 million which comprised $1. 875 million for the acquisition of
SAT and $3.125 million to pay off the debt to AAM. On December 26,
1972, the Executive Director-Comptroller approved the recommendation

that Mr. Williams' offer be rejected and that if Mr. Williams was

NW 50955 Docld: 32423532. Page 100


unable to raise by January 20, 1973, the additional funds required

Nad)

for the original purchase price of $5.9 million, including the Air
America debt, that.the Agency proceed with Liquidation plans and
dismissal of SAT employees not later than February 1, 1973.

On January 11, 1973, Mr. Williams submitted a new proposal to
purchase SAT for a total price of $5,605,000. Mr. Williams cited a
tentative commitment for a loan of $4.0 million and his offer was
contingent upon an additional loan. The offer called for a total
payment of $5,605,000 broken down as follows:

; Acquisition of stock for Actus and SAT $2,145 million
Payment of debt to Air America 3.125 million
Credit for payments to AAM since

Oldune) 1972, in Liquidation | of
long térm debt 335 million
“ Total payment $5. 605 million

Prior to accepting Mr. Williams’ offer, CTA representatives
again discussed the sale of SAT to Mr. Williams, Mr. R. Tenney
Johnson of CAB indicated that the board would be interested in
seeing SAT continued. Mr. Johnson stated it would not be necessary
to surface the Agency's name as the true owner of SAT in the CAB
proceedings, and that he did not anticipate any problems with
other supplemental carriers as a result of the sale to Mr. Williams.

On January 19, 1973,. the DCI approved the sale of SAT to Mr. 5
Williams. It was noted. that Mr. Williams’ offer was within’S | perceit.
of the original asking price, was above the independent ee
for sale as a going concern and was at a figure which would not seem

to give the buyer windfall profit. Such sale would constitute a

NW 50955 Docld:32423532 Page 101



“4 clean break-away of SAT from the Agency with the exception of a one
year extension on the lease/purchase agreement for an L 100-30 air-
eraft from SAT. This agreement for sale between Mr. Williams and
the Agency included a provision that any profit derived from the
sale of assets within one year would constitute a windfall and
would be added to the total sale price.

On February 28, 1973, the Board of Directors of SAT executed
corporate action on the Agreement for Sale of SAT to Mr. Williams.
Closing date was established at not later than 30 days after CAB
approval. On March 1, 1973 application for approval of acquisition
of control of SAT by Mr. Williams was filed with the CAB under
Docket No. 252-64. It was anticipated. that CAB approval would be
forthcoming within 60 days.

“ Subsequent to the agreement for sale and application to CAB,
several supplemental carriers generated a great deal of pressure to
prevent SAT from being sold to Mr. Williams and to prevent SAT from
operating as a supplemental carer ar rasan was-applied
through their Congressional représentatives, the General Accounting
Office, the General Services Administration, and other ways. The
various supplemental carriers objected to the sale of SAT for a
variety of reasons. Basically each objected to the portions of
SAT's operating authority which would allow SAT to compete with it.
Specifically, representatives of Overseas National Airways (ONA)
indicated that ONA would not oppose the. sale if Mr. Williams would

voluntarily renounce his rights to Trans-Pacific routes. World

NW 50955 Docld:32423532 Page 102


N Airways and Trans International Airways (TIA) objected to SAT
operating any aircraft as large or larger than-a 727 in the Far
East. Saturn Airways objected to SAT bidding on any domestic MAC
contracts. To restrict SAT to satisfy all potential competition
could make SAT sufficiently unattractive as a profitable investment
that financing could become unobtainable. With this in mind the
Agency took the position that agreement for sale of SAT had been
executed, subject to CAB approval. If the CAB ruled against the-
sale and ownership reverted to the Agency, the Agency would ‘cease
any bids or service under MAC contracts and dissolve SAT.

Two of the other supplementals, Saturn and ONA, expressed
interest in buying SAT. ONA did not.make a cash offer. On June 29,
1973, Saturn Airways, however, made a cash offer of about $2 million

i) in excess of what Mr. Williams had offered. There were, however,
according to the Agency, compelling reasons not to pursue these
offers. Agency officers had reason to believe that ONA was not as
interested in actually buying SAT as they were in getting a commit-
ment from the Agency which could be used to compromise the Agency's
position in future CAB hearings. Three reasons for not accepting
either offer were:

Ae Any merger with another supplemental carrier would
necessitate a very difficult series of CAB hearings during
which all other major supplementals would certainly voice

loud and strenuous objections.

NW 50955 Docld:32423532 Page 103


“ b. To sell the firm on a sole-source basis to either
outside buyer without soliciting public bids would be
contrary to sound business practice and would attract
even more adverse publicity.
c. Both offers were made directly to officials of the
CIA and not to the stockholders of record. Although the
relationship between the CIA and SAT was the subject of
much public speculation, such relationship was still :
classified and an acceptance of either offer would be a
violation of security and cover.
These procedures were unaeceptable to the Agency and dissolution of
the firm or sale to Mr. Williams continued as the most acceptable
method of divestiture, subject to CAB approval.
a) In view of the objections by other supplemental carriers to
the sale of SAT to Mr, Williams and the award by the Air Force of a
Logistics Air contract (LOGAIR) to SAT, the DCI directed on July & ys
1973, that SAT be dissolved, that SAT withdraw from the LOGAIR con-
tract and withdraw its application for renewal of supplemental
certificate. Mr. Williams was advised of this decision, but made
a counter’ offer to purchase the company under the previous financial
offer but turn in his supplemental certificate, withdraw application
for acquisition for sale from CAB, and operate SAT as a commercial
carrier under Federal Aviation Regulation Part 121 authority. Such
action would remove SAT from direct competition with the supplementals,
but leave it with a worthwhile market in which to operate. Addi-

tionally, no CAB hearing would be necessary to obtain this type of

HW 50955 DocId:32423532 Page 104.


iv)

operating authority.

On October 1, 1973, the DCI agreed to entertain the proposal
to continue the sale of SAT to Mr. Williams as a Part 121 operator,
but on the condition that Mr. Williams must obtain prompt financing.
Otherwise, the firm would be dissolved.

On October 5, 1973, the SAT Board of Directors approved and
executed a new agreement for sale including the following provisions:

a. Mr. Williams to acquire stock of SAT Actus for

$2,145,000. ,

b. Mr. Williams to pay off $3,125,000 owed to Air America.

ce. Agreement subject to Mr. Williams obtaining $4 million

loan.

d. Agreement to be ‘subject to SAT withdrawing application
eS for renewal of its Certificate of Necessity and Convenience

for an Air Carrier (Supplemental Certificate).

e. Lease/purchase agreement for L-100 between AAM and SAT

to be extended one year.

f. Anti-windfall provision to be effective for one year from

date of sale.

On November 29, 1973, Mr. Williams received a commitment from
The First National Bank of Chicago for a loan of $4.5 million thereby
making the October 5, 1973, agreement operative. On November 30,
1973, the DCI approved the sale of SAT in accordance with the
October 5 agreement for sale. On the. same day, the application to

the CAB for acquisition of SAT under Docket No. 252-64 was withdrawn

NW 50955 Docld:32423532 Page 105


a) and petition. for cancellation of certificate and termination of
exemption authority was filed with an effective date of December 30,
1973. On December 31, 1973, the sale was closed, the note to Air
America was paid off, and Stanley G. Williams became the sole
owner of SAT.

In early January 1974, CIA officials learned from Air America
management that SAT had exercised the purchase option of the lease/
purchase agreement between SAT and Air America for the Lockheed
L 100-30 Hercules aircraft. The option sale price from Air America
was $3,150,000. SAT immediately resold the aircraft to Saturn
Airways for $4,350,000 turning a quick $1.2 million profit. The
Agency interpreted this sale as a violation of the anti-windfall
provisions of the agreement for sale. On January 25, 1974, Air

>) America executed an Escrow and Arbitration Agreement on behalf of
the CIA with SAT on the disputed $1.2 million profit. The agreement
called for $750,000 to be placed in escrow with the American Security
and Trust Company of Washington, D.C. The escrow funds were to be
held as a Certificate of Deposit purchased at the prevailing market
vate. It was further agreed that SAT would also place in escrow
a Promissory Note to Air America for the remaining $450,000 of the
disputed amount. The note was to bear interest at the same rate
currently being earned on the Certificate of Deposit in escrow.

It was arranged that the escrow deposits plus acerued interest would
be paid to the party deemed in favor by an arbitrator with each

party to pay one-half of the costs of arbitration. On September 5,

MW 50955 Docld:32473532 Page 106


“ 1974, the arbitrator ruled in favor of Air America. This decision
caused an additional $1,304,243 to accrue ‘to the Agency from the
SAT sale. This was the sum of the $1.2 million under arbitration

plus accrued interest, less the Agency's share of arbitration costs.

DECLASSIFICATION OF RELATIONSHIP WITH CIA

In March 1974 the employees of SAT retained an attorney and
brought a class action suit in U.S. District Court for Southern
Florida against Southern Air Transport, Inc., and the Central Intel-
ligence Agency. The employees as plaintiffs sued for injunctive
relief and damages. In this suit the employees alleged:

a. That the CIA sold the stock of SAT to Mr. Williams

illegally,

‘ b. That SAT had embarked on a program to sell off its
assets, depriving the plaintiffs of employment,
c. That the plaintiffs were entitled to the benefits of
the CIA Retirement and Disability System, and

a. That their civil rights had been violated.

In view of the publicity arising from the allegations made by
the other supplemental carriers during the CAB proceedings and the
publicity arising from.this suit, it was determined that no useful
purpose would be served by continuing to deny the true ownership
relationship of SAT byrera, It is noted, however, that the opera-
tional activities performed by. SAT on behalf of CIA were and remain
classified. As a part of the Agency's defense in this suit, an

affidavit of Mr. Harold L. Browhman, Deputy Director for Management

HW 50955 Docld:32423532 Page 107


a) and Services of the CIA, was presented in court. In the affidavit
Mr. Brownman delineated the relationship ren and SAT and the
authorities for purchasing and later selling the capital stock of
SAT. He also defined the employment status of the plaintiffs as
not being government employees and not being CIA employees and _
therefore hot being eligible for participation in the CIA Retire-
ment and Disability System.

In the Order Granting Motion for Summary Judgment, the court
found that the sale of SAT capital stock to Mr. Williams was not in
violation of law; the plaintiffs claim to be U.S. Government employees
and entitled to CIA retirement benefits invalid; and that the SAT
employees were not deprived of any civil right under any state law.

As a result, the action was dismissed with prejudice as to the

‘ plaintiff. Although this suit did cause the relationship between
the Agency and SAT to be officially made public, it did establish,
in a court of law, two points favorable to the Agency:

a. The sale of SAT to Stanley Williams violated no laws

and was within the authority of the DCI; and

b. The directly hired employees of ClA-owned proprietary

firms such as SAT do not necessarily enjoy the status of

U.S. Government’ employees.

CONFLICT OF INTEREST

In the SAT divestiture, the Agency took precautions to avoid
conflict of interest. Mr. George A. Doole, Jr., retired Staff,
Agent and retired Managing Director of Air America, Inc., made

nN ;

HW 50955 Docld:32423532 Page 108


(}

several offers to acquire SAT. In early 1972 he and some other
members of AAM management made. an informal offer to buy SAT, Then
on August 7, 1972, Mr. Doole told Mr. Charles W. Kane, Agency
official responsible for the management of SAT and AAM, that he,

in association with World Airways and TIA, wanted to offer "book
value" for SAT. He stated that they were not interested in SAT's
certificate, but rather in the equipment and that if allowed to
make an offer, it would be one that would not require CAB hearings.
In both these cases, the Agency's General Counsel determined that
because of Mr. Doole's close association with the Agency, the offer
would be unacceptable. In later discussions, Mr. Doole asked to be
allowed. to bid on SAT in open bidding. The General Counsel's posi-
tion on this request was that open bids would be begging the question’
in terms of conflict of interest. In any transaction this complex,
selecting the bid is only a préliminary to the negotiated final
sale.

! Another potential conflict of interest involved Overseas
National Airways. From the time the Agency first decided to divest,
until the sale to Mr. Williams was consummated, ONA expressed con-
tinuing interest in an ONA/SAT merger. Their representative making
these continuing overtures to the Agency was retired Admiral William
F. Raborn, former Director of Central Intelligence. Admiral Raborn
made literally. dozens-of phone calls to Agency officials and arranged
many meetings) all for the purpose of pressing ONA's case to purchase
SAT. ONA also proposed to arrange "shadow financing" for Mr. Williams

“~ if he would agree to merge with ONA at some later time. These offers

AW 50955 DocId:32423532 Page 109


were all rejected because merger with another supplemental was
not an acceptable solution and the apparent conflict of interest
was too great.

The sale of SAT to the President of the firm, Mr. Stanley
Williams, was another area of possible conflict of interest.
However, Mr. Williams was not an employee of the U.S, Government
during any period of association with SAT.or CIA. He had been
the owner prior to CIA acquisition and his role as nominal President
of SAT during CIA ownership was atthe direction o CTA, which made
or approved all decisions in regard to acquisition of aircraft and
other major policy determinations. Additionally, this potential
area of conflict had been recognized at the outset of sale pro-
ceedings, which was the basis for obtaining third-party professional
evaluation and appraisals and the provision in the sale agreement
against windfall profit from disposition of assets. An underlying
philosophy for sale back to Mr. Williams was to restore the corpo-
ration to the status of private ownership once the need for it as
a Government-controlled entity had terminated. Such action was
considered in the best interests of the SAT employees as well as
in the interest of the U.S. Government to maintain another viable

commercial air carrier.

CONCLUSION
The CIA acquired ownership of SAT and its real property owning

affiliate, by purchase of all outstanding shares of capital stock
on August 5, 1960, Such acquisition was accomplished under the

MW 50955 Docld:32423532 Page 110


authority of the Central Intelligence Act of 1949 in order to
acquire a certificated air carrier to support its foreign intel-
ligence operations. The purchase was accomplished after consul-
tation and approval by the CAB and the DOD, and was not in violation
of Section 410 of the Federal Aviation Act.

Following determination by CIA in 1972 that ownership of SAT
was no longer required to support its foreign intelligence opera-
tions, the CIA undertook to dispose of SAT under the authority of the
CIA Act of 1949 and the specific provision in the Federal Property
and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (FPAS Act) that nothing in
the act shall impair or affect any authority of the Central Intel-
ligence Agency. In the case of Robert Farmer, et al., vs. Southern
Air Transport, Inc., et al., the U.S. District Court, Southern
District of Florida, Case No. 74-467-CIV-WM, upheld the authority
of CIA to dispose of Southern Air Transport, Inc.

In disposing of SAT, the CIA determined after discussions with
CAB that SAT should not be sold as a going concern in an open
competitive market nor should merger with another air carrier be
considered. Such action would involve lengthy procedures, hearings,
and publicity which posed a threat to CIA's ability to protect
intelligence sources and methods. While CIA initially was inclined
to dissolve SAT and sell the assets, CAB and DOD both indicated
their desire to maintain SAT as a supplemental commercial air
carrier. Since this solution also would be in the best interest

of the SAT employees and there were indications this could be

HW 50955 Docld:32423532 Page 111


~ 89-19 -

accomplished without revealing ownership by CIA, CIA approved
exploring the sale of SAT to its previous owner and current
nominal President, Mr. Stanley Williams.

The CIA took reasonable precautions to assure that a fair
market price was received for the sale of SAT, and that no short
term windfall profit would ensue, The CIA was mindful of conflict
of interest problems, and obtained independent professional advice
and guidance prior to executing an agreement for sale. The sale
price finally received by the CIA exceeded the parameters estab-
lished by this independent study.

In retrospect, it is possible that open competitive bidding
for sale of SAT as a going concern could have achieved as much or
more return to the U.S. Government for the assets of SAT. However,
such assessment is only conjecture since this market was not fully
tested. Also this method of disposal had the potential for greater
publicity and revelation of intelligence sources and methods. In
retrospect, the alternate solution of dissolution of the corporation
and sale of assets probably would have created less publicity but
again this is only conjecture, since the SAT employee law suit may
well have been forthcoming in any event.

In conclusion, the CIA obtained a fair market value for the
sale of SAT as evaluated by an independent professional appraisal.
The legality of the disposal of Southern Air Transport by the CIA
has been tested in court and has been shown to be fully within

the statutory authorities and responsibilities of the DCI. The

precautions taken and the procedures established by the CIA consi-
dered the varying factors of responsibility for public funds, con-
flicts of interest, U.S. Government interests for the aviation

industry and its employees, and national security. The CIA actions

in the disposal of SAT, accordingly, were reasonable and proper.

VI. Project MHBOUND

In 1958, at the time construction of the new CIA headquarters
building in Langley was begun, a small counterintelligence opera-
tion was established to maintain surveillance of activities to
prevent hostile penetration and sabotage. It was successful in
its objectives and, therefore, upon occupancy of the building
in 1962 the Project, now known as MHBOUND, was established as an
outgrowth of the initial effort.

From a single office in Arlington, Virginia, the project ex-
panded to four field offices (Arlington, Falls Church, Los Angeles
and St. Louis). Also, it grew from a single corporate entity into
three separate corporations. The parent organization in 1962 was
Anderson Enterprises, Inc., which operated in the greater Washing-
ton area and was set up to create a bona fide commercial corpor-
ation which would perform security services on a competitive basis
for any and all individuals and companies which might require

“them, as well as Federal and local governmental units. In addi-
tion, it would conduct operations for the Office of Security of
the CIA. This activity proved most successful, with customers
utilizing it for document destruction, Sr consultation, for
guard work, and for investigations.

Anderson Enterprises, Inc. developed legitimate business
contracts with agencies of the Federal government and with commer- -
cial firms. The provisions of the a eee vae gepanbeeton Act 'pro-

= work
hibit a company engaged in investigative /from contracting with

- 91 -

the Federal government. In order to protect the commercial
cover, it became necessary to form a separate company to handle
investigations in response to the requirements of commercial
firms. Further, it became necessary to set up notional commer-
cial firms through which to fund MHBOUND.for investigative work
levied upon it by the Office of Security. At the time this
split was accomplished, Anderson Enterprises, Inc. changed its
name to Anderson Security Consultants, Inc., with its head-
quarters remaining in Arlington. The new company was called
Anderson Security Services, Inc. and made Los Angeles its home
office. As activity expanded and work increased, a third corp-
oration called General Personnel Investigations, Inc. was organ-
ized and also headquartered in Los Angeles.

On January 23, 1966, for legal, cover and operational rea-
sons and increased administrative efficiency, Anderson Security
Services, Inc. (ASSI) merged into General Personnel Investigations,
Inc. (GPII) and remained incorporated in the state of California. .
Upon the merger, ASSI ceased and GPII succeeded it. The corpor-
ate officers and the board of directors of all three companies
consisted of the same persons. Subsequently, GPII was sold and
new legal straw men were introduced as officers, directors and
shareholders. The home office of General Personnel Investigations,
Inc. was subsequently established in Falls Church, Virginia in
March 1966 for greater administrative efficiency and firmer mone-

tary controls on the projects as a whole, and to greatly enhance

NW 50955 Docld:32423532 Page 115


mG pte

cover viability. Also of particular note, the “home office",
with its investigative charter, has been used in the conduct of
covert investigations.

In addition to the conduct of investigations, MHBOUND was
used in the following activities:

(a) TPOCTONAL - covert monitoring of construction of CIA
Headquarters building;

(b) Monitoring of construction of West Gate Research Park
buildings, which were to be occupied by Agency components;

(c) TAPIR - covert monitoring of construction of CIA print-
ing services building;

(d) ZULU - surveillance of DOD civilian employees suspected
to be potential defectors to Soviets;

(e) STPROBE - testing security effectiveness at domestic
DDS&T sites and contractor facilities;

(f£) MERRIMAC - monitoring of dissident groups in D.C.;*

(g) AEDONOR - the proprietary hired and paid contract guards
for one phase of this activity;

(h) ISOTROPIC - the proprietary was a civilian contractor for
the guard force at this installation;

(i) TWOFOLD - was an Office of Security cryptonym for an oper-
ation to recruit, process and train undercover internal security

agents for the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs;

* This. particular project and other aspects of MHBOUND's domestic
activities are treated in greater detail in the Committee's Staff
Report dealing with the operations of MHBOUND.

MW 50955 Docld:32423532 Page 116


- 93 -

(j) DELICATE - security support for DDS&T project, consisting
mainly of badging and entry controls, background investigations,
and escort of sensitive material; this is the only such activity
currently being serviced by MHBOUND;

(k) PINEAPPLE - physical surveillance of an Agency courier
suspected of living beyond his means; also involved a surreptitious
entry into his apartment;

(1) BOOTS - physical surveillance of an Agency employee "who
maintained contact with people of questionable loyalty"; also in-

volved an audio penetration of the employee's apartment and a mail cover.

Funding for the proprietary is accomplished through a cut-out
mechanism whereby the Agency sends U. S. Treasury checks to ten
contractors. The proprietary then bills the contractors for
“services rendered" in the same amount as received by the contractor
via Treasury check. Funding for the other corporations was done
through use of notional firms. The ISOTROPIC guard force contract
was handled by intra-Agency transfer of funds. BNDD reimbursed the
Agency for all TWOFOLD expenses, except for salary of the one staff
agent. DOD reimbursed the Agency for all ZULU expenses.

Los Angeles is the only MHBOUND office currently in operation.
During Fiscal Year 1975, 2,226 investigations were conducted, 6,125
man-hours were rendered in support of DELICATE, and a total of
$551,000 was expended. Purely commercial income averages between

$20,000 to $25,000. Much of this comes from walk-in business, which,

NW 50955 DocTd:32423532 Page 117


Sag Auce

for cover reasons, cannot be refused. Over the past few years,
this has involved badging operations for private companies, i.e.
airlines, schools, etc. The company has never made a true profit.
To maintain its image among its competitors, however, its books
reflect a small profit on which Federal and state taxes are paid.
The office presently employes four staff agents, five contract
agents and fourteen proprietary employees. During Fiscal Year
1974, the project expended 2.9% of the OS budget ($551,000 vs.
$19,026,530). ,
MHBOUND, as noted, has provided support to the Office of
Security and Agency operators on sensitive covert operations
and investigative matters, CI/CE support for components of the
Agency, custodial support, courier support on truly covert activ-
ity, guard support, special non-government and sensitive inquiries
. (CI/CE probes through STPROBE), technical and physical support
in surveillances and Agency proprietary support. Its commercial
capabilities have included: confidential consultants, internal
security management, security surveys, counter-audio measures and
inspections, development, installation and maintenance of security
protective equipment and devices, classified material storage equip-
ment, secure destruction of classified waste, incinerator equipment
sales, polygraph examination, investigations (personnel), and
industrial undercover activities.
A unique example of its Agency security function was project

STPROBE, which utilized both security probes and security pene-

HW 50955 Docld:32423532 Page 118


- 94-1 -

trations. A security probe is a testing of the current effec-
tiveness of all or part of a security system within an Agency

or Agency contractor's installation. A security penetration is

an internal covert investigation and search targeted at possi-

ble subversive elements within a facility who may be engaged in
foreign intelligence or acts of sabotage or who by lack of security
discipline or gross malfeasance may be weakening the security
structure of the project or facility. It is, in essence, counter-
intelligence against a domestic installation. Eastman Kodak, for
example, was the target of a probe. An agent was sent under the
natural™ cover of a union construction man to Eastman to gain
employment as a pipefitter. He succeeded in gaining access to

the target, and developed information on the installation and

its personnel in surrounding areas of the union hall, bars, cafes,
and in other appropriate places around the target area. Similar
probes were conducted against Pratt and Whitney in West Palm Beach,
Florida, Lockheed Aircraft Corporation in Burbank, California, and
other targets in New York, Nevada, and Arizona.

These entities serve a useful function within the scheme of
necessary security required by sensitive Agency operations. Their
utility, however, as in the case of nearly all proprietaries is
relative to policy and "flap'' demands. As one Agency commentator
phrased it. when Newsweek revealed the relationship of L. Lee

Bean and Paul Hellmuth of the Boston law firm of Hale and Dorr

* He was in fact a legitimate tradesman.

HW 50955 DocId:32423532 Page 119


- 94-2 -

with the CIA in setting up proprietaries:

Proprietaries have been and will continue to be an

important tool to achieve selected operational

objectives. Their use, however, has been drasti-

cally cut back, more because of changes in the

international scene and in operational priorities

than as a result of embarrassing exposures.
Of course, as has been the case with nearly all other proprietaries,
not everyone within the Agency has been satisfied with the mechanism.
Indeed, there has been constant review, criticism and internal
restraint due to a certain fear and suspicion of entities such as
Anderson which are "out there" and not readily accessible to the
leash. For example, in June of 1964, the Chief of the Operation
Support Division wrote to the Deputy Director of Security (Investi-
gations and Operational Support) concerning MHBOUND's policy and
procedures, In terms of operational objectives he noted that they
thad "created an operational support entity of dubious capability
and with ill-defined objectives or purpose." He suggested that
they “look this ugly duckling in the face" and see if it could be
terminated gracefully or “see if we can nurture it into a productive
and responsive bird of acceptable countenance."*

He “received the definite impression that there may be some

grey area with regard to the internal channels of command and admini-

7

strative direction." He noted that there was confusion resulting

-* In many cases these concerns dealt with the inability of the
entity to provide adequate cover for itself in order to more
adequately fulfill its role. In one instance, the physical
backstopping of MHBOUND was inadequate. After this was rectified,

ey one official noted: :

It is felt that this step has strengthened the
Anderson Enterprises' cover, both in Boston and
Washington so that now the company could withstand
any inquiries, except that of an official govern-
ment investigation.

NW 50955 DocId:32423532 Page 120

from lack of a clear-cut distinction "at just what level policy

"

matters may be decided... Management procedures for the

; project were such that “under the current status everyone may take
eredit but no one could be blamed."' As far as operational capa-
bility was concerned he remarked:

Quite candidly, I am somewhat concerned about the
operational capability of Project MHBOUND. It seems,
as a result of its Topsy-like growth, to be oriented
toward the military and the building trades. Quite
candidly, it is felt that the base must be broadened.
Further, I am far from convinced that we have yet
developed anywhere near the professional status neces-
sary to "sell" this Project as one having unique opera-
tional capabilities sufficient to justify its existence.
In other words, I am not impressed with the capability
as it now exists nor am I sure that we can sell this
product and then be assured that it can perform in a
satisfactory manner.

His comments concerning the attitude of Agency personnel were not
unique to this proprietary, but they are set out here as illustra-
tive of the singular problems these entities pose. His remarks
also show the dangers inherent in some areas of this activity.

It would seem that this Agency, particularly operating
components, are insistent upon pursuing an "ostrich
policy" when it comes to their operational security
procedures. I have personally witnessed almost hyster-
ical reactions to criticisms as well as total rejections
of practical suggestions with regard to operational
security procedures. Now it seems to me that we are
going about this in a very awkward and embarrassing
manner. WE ARE, IN EFFECT, ALLOWING. THE WRITERS OF
SENSATIONAL BOOKS SUCH AS THE "INVISIBLE GOVERNMENT"

TO PROVIDE THE NECESSARY INFORMATION AND PRESSURE ON
TOP AGENCY MANAGEMENT TO CORRECT GLARING AND STUPID
COURSES OF ACTION BEING PURSUED AT THE WORKING LEVEL.

I have been the object of considerable personal ridicule
due to my stand in opposition to the unrealistic cover
and operational security procedures as they relate to
certain aspects of (CIA Operational Base) for example.

MW 50955 Docld:32423532 Page 121


~ 94-2-b -

IF we had the authority and capability to have made

an objective probe of this sensitive activity we may
have been able to have surfaced these obviously ridi-
culous procedures in such a manner that corrective
action would have been taken. Now is the time to
present the case in light of the abiding fear of publi-
city currently permeating the Agency. I recommend that
we go after the authority to make independent (uni-
lateral) probes and/or probes requested and known only
at the very highest levels of the Agency with the results
discreetly channeled where they will do the most good.
There necessarily follows the unpleasant subject of
money. As distasteful as it may be, it is no good to
have the authority without a sufficiently large confi-
dential fund set aside and earmarked for independently
iniated activities.

He emphasized that if the Agency did not take the above kind of
action to monitor its “image at the operational level, “we will
continue to be plagued with the unsolicited and uncontrolled
eritique through the newspapers, periodicals and books." He
eritically concluded:

Further, I challenge anyone to deny that such exposes

to date are largely true and usually the result of our

own "ostrich policy" and refusal to face the fact that

we have operated in some relatively amateurish manners
over the years.

HW 50955 Docld:32423532 Page 122


- 94-3 -

Such concerns have extended beyond these operational levels
to general issues of propriety and legality. For example, as
noted earlier (supra, p. 90) the so-called "Aanti-Pinkerton Act"
prohibits a company engaged in investigative work from contracting

with the Federal government. “But

the Agency and its predecessor organizations began
contracting as early as November 1942 with certain
commercial, investigating companies to perform in-
vestigations and to provide commercial credentials
to, and cover backstopping for, Agency investigators.

As of March 1975, the Office of Security had a relationship with
three such companies which issue their credentials to Agency inves-
tigators and backstop the cover of same. Two of the three have
previously “conducted limited personnel investigations" on behalf
of the Agency. During that same period the Director of Security
asked the General Counsel of the CIA whether the "Anti-Pinkerton
Act" prohibited the Office's continued contractual relationship
with these three private companies or their employees for pur-
poses of conducting investigations or providing cover, or both.
The General Counsel responded as: follows:

I am aware that in fulfilling the responsibilities

placed upon your office in support of the Agency's

mission, many investigations must be conducted with-

out revealing Agency interest and in some, without

even revealing Government interest. Absent the

relationships you question, you could not discharge

your responsibilities. It is this inability to

accomplish your tasks which causes recourse to the

Agency’s rather broad statutory authority to expend

funds as contained in Section 8 of the..CIA Act of
1949, as amended. This authority provides

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law,
sums made available to the Agency by appropria-
tion or otherwise may be expended for purposes
necessary to carry out its functions, including --

(1) personal services, including personal
services without regard to limitations on
types of persons to be employed, ...

(b) The sums made available to the Agency may be
expended without regard to the provisions of law
and regulations relating to the expenditure of
Government funds; and for objects of a confiden-
tial, extraordinary, or emergency nature, such
expenditures to be accounted for solely on the
certificate of the Director and every such certi-
ficate shall be deemed a sufficient voucher for
the amount therein certified.

It is my opinion that this authority permits the Agency
to continue the two practices as set out above without
fear of violation of the Anti-Pinkerton Statute.

He closed, however, with the following admonitions:

There are, of course, other dimensions to the question
you raise. As a matter of policy I believe the prac-
tices should be reviewed at the highest levels within
the Agency and, perhaps, cleared with the Agency's
oversight committees. In addition, if one of these
relationships became public, it must be recognized

that there will be allegations that the law has been
violated. On balance, it is my view that these consi-
derations are not so significant as to warrant a termi-
nation of the two practices with the three companies.

It is suggested, however, that any subsequent, projected
association with a detective company or private investi-
gative company beyond the three present companies be
reviewed with this Office prior to its initiation.

VII. BEYOND "DOING BUSINESS": PEAK NON-GOVERNMENT SECURITY
INVESTMENTS BY PRO. ACT El 1 1974

As described infra, MHMUTUAL (the insurance and pension complex)
has invested heavily in both domestic and foreign securities markets.
Its portfolio runs the gamut of notes, bonds, debentures, etc. But
other proprietaries have also used this investment route as a method
of increasing capital and insuring adequate cover.

For example, KMJAGGERY is a Delaware corporation located in
Washington, D.C., which purchases general merchandise in a manner
which cannot be traced to the United States Government. It provides
covert procurement for the Office of Logistics (CIA). Its total
purchases from January to September 1974 were $437,500. It has no
outside commercial business and has five employees. Yet, as of
December 31, 1974, that entity had invested $149,000 in time deposits.
Another covert procurement mechanism under this same Office is
SPECIAL STOCK ACCOUNT #3. This is also a Delaware corporation with
an address in Baltimore which purchases arms, ammunition, and police
related equipment in a manner which cannot be traced to the United
States Government. The company has no employees and is managed by
Headquarters officials in alias. As of December 31, 1974, that
entity had invested $37,500 in a certificate of deposit.

LPJACK was a travel service which was sold recently to an Agency
employee at the time of his reitrement, who had ostensibly owned the
firm before but in fact only managed it for the Agency. As of

December 31, 1974, that entity had invested $35,000 in a certificate

of deposit.*

LPDICTUM/LPSPICE was an investment company which was dissolved.
As of March 31, 1973, it had invested $100,080 in Petrolcos Mexicanos,
S.A. Mexico.

HBSANDSTRAP is a Delaware corporation located at Washington
National Airport which has provided secure air support for Agency
employees and classified pouches between Headquarters and other
Agency facilities in the United States. The company has accepted
commercial charter flights from non-Agency customers for income and
cover purposes. As of December 31, 1974, it had invested $144,000
ina certificate of deposit.

QRTROW was a former proprietary and is now an institute located
in Europe which "seeks to influence and encourage moderate and pro-
democratic youth leaders and government officials concerned with
youth and higher education." According to the Agency

The Agency withdrew its support from the institute in

1974 and turned over all assets to the management of

the organization. In addition, the Agency provided

surge funding in the amount necessary to enable the

entity to exist in reduced form for about one year

during which time the management would attempt to

arrange private support.
As of March 31, 1972, that proprietary had invested $50,000 in time
deposits.

LPMANTLE is part of the WUTACTIC complex managed by the Cover

and Commercial Staff to provide operational support mechanisms for

DDO foreign operations. It is a Delaware corporation which is used

* The Agency today uses this firm for the purchase of airline tickets
for travel in support of sensitive projects. It is estimated by the
Agency that CIA business represents about 30% of the gross airline
ticket sales of the entity on an annual basis.

to collect the proceeds from the sale of Agency proprietary entities
and to refund such proceeds to the Agency. At December 31, 1973, its
total assets were $650,220 and its total liabilities were $633,897.
Total stockholders equity was $16,323. It has no employees. As

of December 31, 1974, it had invested $400,000 in a convertible subor-
dinated debenture from the sale of a company and $45,440 in notes
receivable. Another company in this TACTIC complex is LPGLITTER.

It is a Panamanian company which was used as an investment vehicle
for funds reserved for new commercial operations requiring Agency
investments. The investment project was terminated and all funds were
returned to the Agency. The company has no employees. As of December
31, 1973, it had invested $246,757 in a Security Note of Pepsico
Corporation, N.V. i :

IUQUEST was part of the air support complex of the Agency proprie-
taries. Substantial assets of it were sold and the entity dissolved.
As of December 31, 1974, it had invested $215,000 in a certificate of
deposit. :

LPPANDA/LPMET is part of the management and accounting complex.

As of December 31, 1974, it had $470;000 invested in time deposits.

VIII: MHMUTUAL: THE INSURANCE-INVESTMENT COMPLEX

a) A BRIEF HISTORY

MHMUTUAL is a complex of insurance companies, most of which
are located abroad, operated by the Agency to provide the following
services: :
a) reinsurance of aircraft damage or liability risks
ostensibly insured under commercially issued policies
(for cover) ;

b) extending term life insurance, annuities, trusts and
workmen's compensation for independent contractors
and agents working for the Agency who are not entitled
to U.S, Government benefits;

c) handling escrow accounts* for agents;

d) limited operational support activities, i.e., holding

real estate formerly a in Agency operations abroad; **
and

e) investing in domestic and foreign markets to obtain
earnings to fund the above.

MHMUTUAL was created in 1962 to provide death and disability bene-
fits to agents and beneficiaries when security considerations pre-
clude attribution to the U.S. Government. The losses during the
Bay of Pigs prompted its establishment. From sixty-seven (67) to
seventy-three (73) companies operated originally under the Domestic
Operations Division and later a board of directors controlled by the
Office of General Counsel. This internal board of the project made

investment decisions.

* Escrow accounts are established when an agent cannot receive his
full payment from the CIA without attracting suspicion. The funds
not paid to the agent go into escrow accounts and are invested under
MHMUTUAL. i

** The CIA's domestic real proverty holdings appear as Appendix E.

- 100 -

Lawrence Houston, retired General Counsel of the Agency, testi-
fied that his office instigated the establishment of MHMUTUAL. This
was because his staff would be the repository of all problems related
to the death or disability of a person during the course of his
Agency work. These problems were all handled in what Houston called

a very "sketchy way’ and this was simply undesirable from all

points of view. Moreover, when the Agency went into air proprie-
taries on a large scale there were certain risks which simply

could not be underwritten: commercially.

So somewhere in the late 1950s or around 1960,
I think I was the one that posed that we might
organize our own insurance entities. I had a
couple of lawyer friends deep in the insurance
business, and I suggest I talk to one of them,
and he promptly said, well, it so happens that
I have a couple of offshore insurance entities
that I can make available to you. And we took
a look at them. It looked like they were or-
ganized properly for the purpose. They cost
practically nothing. They were just shells.
But they could be filled out. So if my recol-
lection is correct, we acquired these two as the
first step in what became the MUTUAL project.

Simultaneously, the decision was made that if the Agency was going
to maintain such a capability,

they had to have enough body and backstopping so
that if a suspicious foreign intelligence outfit
tried to investigate, they would stand up under
investigation as would any normal insurance outfit.
In other words, they had to appear to have finan-
cial stability, they had to have names that could
stand up and answer questions, and in other words
appear to be in the normal business of writing the
type of annuities (and) insurance, death and dis-
ability.

This concept was totally organized originally then under the Domestic

Operations Division. DOD eventually recommended that the complex

HW 50955 DocId:32423532 Page 130


- lol -

be transferred to the Office of General Counsel. This occurred,
and it remained there until Director Colby decided in conjunction
with Mr. Houston to transfer for operational reasons to the Cover
and Commercial Staff. This was done because CSS had the expertise
and manpower. Moreover, Mr. Colby took exception to the Board
concept bécause he felt that it diluted the line responsibility by
which all other projects were administered. :

As the number of insurance companies grew to cover increasing
demands placed upon the Agency by more agents, the general fund
which was retained to backstop all the needs of these companies
grew, and "the question was what to do with your money." Houston

explained
Now, insurance companies are normally in the business
of investing their funds, and so this being the normal
thing, it appeared to us necessary to preserve the nor-
mal appearance of these insurance companies to carry
on investment programs for the funds involved, and
there were a variety of investments to be considered.
You could go into U.S. Treasury Bonds, notes and bills,
but actually, from the point of view of insurance bus-
iness practice, this was very unusual. It would be
very, very unusual in the insurance field. Usually
some of them would have some investment in bills, notes
or bonds, but it was a very small part of their portfolio,
and to put it in nothing that that we thought would be
a dead giveaway. So we first went in the direction of
having a general portfolio somewhat similar to the nor-
mal insurance company's investment practices, and I
originally recommended that we have the board of direc-
tors so that we could have available and demonstrate that
we had available the best competence the Agency had in-
ternally to pass judgment on what to do with their money.

Because of shifts in the stock market which made it not look as
promising as it had been during the 1960s, MHMUTUAL went into

certificates of deposit, the Eurodollar market and the bond market.

NW 50955 DocId:32423532 Page 131


- 102 -

It was decided to invest, however, only in Eurodollar bonds that

were "guaranteed by the American parent company." It was thought

that "they were a pretty secure investment."’ On occasion, “when
we got the advice of our economists on the DDI side, we took some
government paper that they considered -- foreign government paper
that they considered really a good security." Houston became the
central figure in this investment scenario:

More and more I continued on this Board of Direc-

tors as giving basic policy advice. We had long
discussions on the areas of discussion, what to stay
away from, what to go into, what it looked like as .
far ahead as they might think they could see. And
more and more I would make the individual decisions

on my own in light of their policy guidance and with
the information which my staff in MUTUAL could get from
the many friends they now had in various underwriting
and investment places on an unwitting basis, who just
thought they were customers. For instance, on the
Eurodollar bonds, they were dealing with several houses
who just thought the fellow was another investor coming
into them and would get very detailed and on the whole
pretty good advice, which often we could check from
inside through some other of our sources. . . .Profits
from primarily the interest operations were very pro-
fitable, and these built up over the years quite rapidly
and were brought into the insurance funding identified
as profits for future possible use.

It was always recognized that a policy decision might
be made at any time that we had funds excess to the
valid backing up of our underwriting, which would be
brought back into the government for such disposition
as might be appropriate at that time.

In terms of actually providing insurance in the aviation and
maritime field, a study would be conducted in each case where in-
surance was required. If it looked as though normal commercial in-
surance would handle it, as was the case with most of Air America's
needs, then the particular entity would go ahead and procure the nor-
mal commercial insurance. If there was something peculiar in the

operational setup that preclud d commercial.companies from accepting

MW 50955 Docld:32423532 Page 132


~103-

the risk or if there were security problems, then it would be

handled through MHMUTUAL.
What we would do when it came to aviation and
marine, we would go to one of the cooperating
companies and see if they wanted the insurance
for their own accounts, because we had made
arrangements that if there were operations
security problems in any one claim, that they
could handle the investigation so it wouldn't
be a problem if they wanted to take for their
own account. If they didn't want to take it
for their own account or they didn't want to
take it all for their own account, they might
then seed back to us what they didn't want.
And it would be then underwritten technically
out of MUTUAL’s account, although they would be
the ostensible insurers.

Several of the aviation entities, other than Air America which
dealt almost exclusively with regular commercial insurance com-
panies, did nto feel quite secure with regular insurance. They
turned to MUTUAL. MUTUAL would in turn offer the risk to one of
the cooperating insurance companies. If they would take the risk,
they would then negotiate the premium with the. proprietary. Tf
they did not want the risk, "then they would seed back to us and
we would take the portion of the premium that should come back.
Usually it if went through a company, they would take a small
underwriting premium to pay their costs, 3 percent or something
like that. And the rest of the premium would go back in MUTUAL,
if they were actually taking the risk."

In 1970 the Inspector General conducted a survey of the secur-
ities held by MHMUTUAL. He concluded that the project seemed to

be secure in its operations in the fields of insurance and invest-

HW 50955 DocId:32423532 Page 133


~104-

ment. The IG looked at the investments from a security (i.e.
cover) point of view in terms of MHMUTUAL’s operational support
function. His concern was that each time MHMUTUAL bought a
safehouse, for example, there was the possibility that audio
surveillance of the house by the Soviets would lead to a dis-
covery of the purchase mechanism used by the Agency. He rea-
soned that, therefore, the purchase of such items by the com-
plex was operationally unsound because it exposed the entire
complex to compromise if a foreign intelligence agency tracked
back the transactions through various corporations. According

to the Inspector General, no funds of MHMUTUAL were used for
specific projects. What would occur, however, was that a project
would transfer funds to the complex which would then disburse
them as needed through an appropriate entity. This method left
him with major reservations about MHMUTUAL security when it sup-
ported sensitive clandestine operations. Thus, MHMUTUAL's pro-
vision of cover, funding for active operations, and record owner-
ship acquired for sensitive operations was deemed inappropriate
and, accordingly, the IG proposed separating operational sup-
port activities of MHANVIL from the instrumentalities of MHMUTUAL.
It was to be restrained to the purposes for which it had been

established in 1962*

* During the course of the IG inquiry no instances were discovered
where MHMUTUAL or its funds were used to influence foreign stock
markets or currencies. The Committee has also found no such
instances.

HW 50955 DocId:32423532 Page 134


-105-

At the time of this 1970 review by the IG, MHMUTUAL held a
surplus of $9 million. It also earned income from sources sup-
ported by public taxation. It appears from the questions that
were raised at the time about briefing congressional committees
on MHMUTUAL that this was not done, providing a situation where
an organization with assets of $30 million has been created and
was operating without oversight knowledge or approval. Moreover,
because MHMUTUAL was no longer a project after its removal from
the Domestic Operations Division, there was no annual allotment
and no annual operational review.

Houston indicated that MHMUTUAL had been operating "before
we told our committees any detail. 1 think it was mentioned as
a problem that we had to make arrangements to cope with insurance
problems fairly early on. But the fact that it was a business
and a business of this substance was not done for some time. My

recollection is there was not deliberate avoidance; we just didn't

get to it.” On the question of lack of annual project. review,
Houston commented that this was "technically correct." But, he
added,

As a matter of practice I would say that MUTUAL was
more carefully reviewed in some respects than almost
any other project in the Agency in the sense that we
had the bookkeeper inside the project who was a finance
officer and bookkeeper. The project published at least
monthly reports in detail which went not only to me but
to Colonel (L.K.) White (the Comptroller) and the
Director. These were very detailed reports which often
raised questions which went back for answers.

HW 50955 DocId:32423532 Page 135


-106-

The Inspector General was invited in, according to Houston. In
addition, the Finance Office kept its own books. in the proprietary
accounts branch on MUTUAL. Such reviews were done, he said, “on a
constant basis."

We were very conscious of the amount of money in-

volved and the possibilities of someone trying to,

someone yielding to temptation and trying to do
something with all of this money.

b) THE CURRENT STATUS

The project currently consists of twenty-six (26) companies
of which five (5) are domestic. All of the clients of MHMUTUAL
are under non-official cover.** The Office of Finance has indi-
cated that the current net worth of the project is $18 million
which is the result of retaining earnings. It was originally
capitalized in 1962 with $4 million. A Washington, D. C. lawyer
(MHANVIL) is currently the investment manager and he provides day-
to-day direction. MHANVIL is a sole proprietorship proprietary

of the Office of General Counsel. Total assets are currently

** MHMUTUAL itself is only for covert non-staff officers of the CIA.
In essence, it only works for what would broadly be described as
"agents," those not entitled to participate in the CIA retirement
plan or in the Civil Service Reitrement Plan. They are primarily
foreigners, and usually DDO employees. Those individuals who were
formerly known as contract agents and who are now known as independ-
ent contractors also participate in MHMUTUAL. In the case of most
agents, the CIA contributes 7 percent and the agent contributes

7 percent, in keeping with CIA practice for regular employees. In
cases where the agent is well along in years and contributions from
the Agency and the agent would not provide enough funds to capital~-
ize an annuity, the Agency provides the initial capitalization; how-
ever, approval of this must come from the DDO.

$31 million, most of which are held outside the U.S. The’ companies
do not write insurance in the United States, but rather reinsure
with cooperating companies who then sell the risk to the CIA for
a percentage of the premium. The policies are written directly
abroad. Each of the U. S. companies pays little tax and a pro-
prietary auditing firm audits the books of MHMUTUAL. This method
of self-insurance enables the Agency to funnel money where needed
in any of its project.categories. Currently, 60 percent of the
investments are in Eurobonds, 20 percent in off-shore time deposits
in U.S. banks, and the balance is in common stocks, debentures
and commercial paper of various types. For example, the current
breakdown is:

$7 million in time deposits abroad;

$2.4 million in Common Stock (at cost); .

$20.8 million in Eurobonds;

$1 million Eurodollar convertible debentures;

$.5 million in short-term commercial paper overseas; and

$.2 million in domestic debentures.

The performance of the MHMUTUAL stock portfolio is noted at
this juncture, Comparisons of cost against market value for the
years 1970 through 1975 are given first. Following that are the

Included as Appendix D is an in-depth list of common stock

are schedules of portfolio sales from 1964 through 1974.

A look at the Project MHMUTUAL Consolidated Balance Sheet for
December 31, 1974 will give some idea of the scale as of that late
date. Current assets (cash in banks, premiums receivable, advances
receivable, accounts receivable, client notes receivable, rent
receivable, interest receivable, and investments maturing.in one
year) totaled $6,910,891.00. Investments (time deposits, bonds
and commercial paper, and stocks at market value) totaled
$25,342,772.53,. Fixed assets (real estate and furniture and fix-
tures) totaled $73,084.12. Other Assets (prepaid insurance, recoverable
deposits, and other prepaid expenses) totaled $32,682.00. These
combined for Total Assets of $32,359,430.45.

As usual, the Project was subjected to an extensive audit for
that year.

The audit included site examination of books and financial

records of 12 of the instrumentalities administered by

Agency-owned management firms as well as review and evalu-

ation of related records, controls, and procedures at

Headquarters. Five instrumentalities administered by

Agency-owned management firms are located abroad and

will be audited later. Audit of the other. six instru-

mentalities administered abroad by foreign accounting

companies was limited to examination of financial reports
and such other documentation as was available at Head-
quarters. These latter examinations provided us reason-
able assurance that Agency resources, totaling about one
percent of project accountability, are adequately pro-
tected.

That audit concluded that MHMUTUAL "continue(d) to be admin-

istered in an efficient and effective manner and in compliance

AW 50955 DocId:32423532 Page 139


-110-

with applicable Agency regulations and directives." Prior audit
reports had commented on the need for a revised administrative
plan and in accordance with these reports, the audit noted, a
"new plan was approved in March 1975." In addition, "(m)inor
administrative and financial problems surfaced during the audit
were discussed with MHMUTUAL officials and resolved." The audit
noted that total income for that year (from interest, premiums,
gain or loss on sale of securities, dividends, rentals, profes-
sional fees, gain on foreign exchange, gain on sale of property
and from miscellaneous transactions) was $4,113,590.00. The
total expenses for that year (allocation of premium income to
reserve for claims, interest, salaries, rent, accounting fees,
taxes, loss on property write-off, legal and other fees, communi-
cations, depreciation and amortization, travel, equipment rent,
real estate expenses, pensions, dues and subscriptions, directors
fees, entertainment, and miscellaneous) were $2,459,260.00. These
combined for a net income of $1,654,330.00.

The current Chief/Central Cover Staff has focused on MHMUTUAL
in a number of interviews with both the Rockefeller Commission
staff and our own, He has suggested that the real question for
MHMUTUAL is what should its role and shape be after the termina-
tion of the large air proprietaries. One of MHMUTUAL's original
purposes was to provide reinsurance for Air America, CAT, Southern
Air Transport, Inter-Mountain Air, and the other air proprietaries.

With their passage, a reorganization and redefinition is needed.

y As to the issue of safeguards against misuse of project funds
or insider information by the Agency, the Chief CCS has told the
Committee that compartmentation, the honesty of the Chief of CCS,
and display of the portfolios to appropriate congressional commit-
tees are what have prevented or will prevent such abuse.

Houston agreed with the three safeguards outlined by the CSS

Chief. However, he |added a fourth;

When we were investing in stock, I would have the

list of stock, the portfolio, reviewed by our con-

tract people, and if I found we had any contract

relationship with any of the companies involved, we'd

either refuse to -- Well, a couple of times our invest-

ment ‘advisor recommended a stock which I knew we had

big contracts with, and I told the board no, this in-

volves a conflict of interest. We won't touch it.

And if we had anything from the Agency contract office

that indicated a relationship, we would either sell

the stock or wouldn't buy it.

‘ Houston believes that the wmpley should continue in some form.
One reason is that "assets are few and far between." The acquisi-
tion of a board of directors; the establishing of accounts, basic
credibility and relations with the jurisdiction in which the entity
is located are not easy things to do according to Houston. This
creates the "tendency, once you've got something that looks good,
to hang on to it." He would recommend in this regard that the
Agency be constantly. forming new companies and phasing out old ones
on a rotational basis’ so that the same complex would not remain
for security reasons.

\

HW 50955 Docld:32423532 Page 141


So it's not easy but I still think that they
should make the effort. [The Chief CCS] knows
my views on this pretty well, and we're all
worried about the security of the damn thing.
But we don't know another way to do it.
He believes that the current method while not perfect is the best
that can be devised. The problem, of course, is that the genera-
tion of funds for these companies must. literally be shown to be
legitimate ae non-governmental if the beneficiaries are to be
protected. Consequently, if the government were to create an
office that would funnel money to these companies without the
benefit of investment, this would create the risk that a trace-
back investigation by a foreign power could discover that the
entity is being funded by..the U.S. government. Houston closed by
~ saying that he would invite any controls that Congress would choose
to put on the mechanism in terms of insuring propriety.

e,
We THE AIR PROPRIETARIES

Lawrence R. Houston, the former General Counsel of the Agency,
was involved in the establishment of the first set of proprietaries
of the Agency back in the late 1940's and early 1950's. As noted
later on in section 10, page , Houston has concluded that
proprietaries should be a mechanism of last resort. He asserts
that the Agency learned this in part "the hard way and almost all
of the lessons involved probably came out one way or the other in
connection with a major aviation proprietary in the Far East.
Others had there own special problems, but I think the Air America
complex had pretty near everything."

The theory of the acquisition of Air America in 1949 was denial
of the assets to the Red Chinese. The CIA first arranged advances
to the company to keep them going when they were running short of
ie) cash in 1949. These advances were used up and were actually credited
to the purchase price eventually. The airline at that time had
been organized by General Claire Chennault and Whiting Willauer.

It was a joint venture with the Chinese Minister of Transport and

was called Civil Air Transport. Houston described it as follows:
This normal aviation organization, this would have no
meaning at all, was completely at all, it would have
not standing in international law,.aviation rights, or
any of that. But it worked for what they wanted, which
was to take supplies up-country into inland China and
then to bring back whatever cargo they could get commer-
cially: tallow, hides, bristles, all that sort of trade,
and then they traded that off for their own account. And
for awhile the operations was fairly successful, the C-47's
and C-46's.

To finance this activity and to facilitate the trading of produce,

their lawyer, Thomas Corcoran, had organized a company. That company

was known as C.A.T. Inc. In addition there was a Panamanian

nan

corporation which was involved that did most of the funding.

There was also an envy known as the Civil Air Transport."to further
complicate the picture, at this time Chennault and Willauer were

also negotiating with the Chinese CNAC, for the takeover of their

_planes and equipment."' Chennault and Willauer came to the Agency

in connection with that operation in the Spring of 1949. At that
point the Nationalist Chinese were being "squeezed down south by
the Communists and they were really backing down toward Shanghi,
restricting their area of operation and consequently the produc-
tivity of their commercial venture." Chennault and Willauer indi-
cated to the Agency that unless they got.help they would have to
go out of business. ,

The agency held a series of meetings in which it was determined
that it had a need for some air transport for some of its operations
particularly involving arms and ammunition and consequently the
Agency needed a contract with someone.

And so we entered into an arrangement, I think in
about September of 1949 whereby we would advance

them, the figure of $750,000 sticks in my mind,
against which we could draw for actual use of the
planes at an agreed on rate. . . . And we did draw
down, I think, all the flying time and expended the
$750,000 between September and about January, at which
time we suspended any further payments or draw-downs.
I think the money was exhausted.

Chennault and Willauer came to Washington about January or
February of 1950 and through a series of negotiations, the Agency
agreed to advance them more funds, taking at the same time an option
to purchase the assets of Civil Air Transport, with the liabilities
left to their account. Any unused portion of the advances were to

be credited to the purchase price. They then operated through the

NW 50955 DocId:32423532 Page 144

- =
Spring of 1950 under this arrangement and Chennault and Willauer
“came in in the Summer of 1950 and said again they were in desperate
straits for funds." Once again a series of meetings was held at
which the prognosis was that the operations in the Far East would
have a continuing need for secure airlift and also, there was a
general estimate that the loss of this airlift to the Chinese
Communists would give them a considerably greater advantage than
then possessed because they had almost no airlift’ of their own at
that time. ‘The Agency then made the decision that they would
“exercise the option given there was no objection otherwise."

The Agency felt that it was necessary to get the concurrence
of the Department of State. Frank G. Wisner, at that time the
Head of the Office of Policy Coordination (OPC) which was respon-
gible for conduct of covert actions as opposed to clandestine in-
2) telligence, and Mr. Houston visited Mr. Livingston Merchant, who

was Assistant Secretary of State for the Far East.
He and-I went to see Mr. Merchant and explained the
situation. And Mr. Merchant reminded us. that it was
basic U.S. policy not to get the government in compe-
tition with U.S. private industry. But under the parti-
cular circumstances, in particular as there was really
no.U.S. private industry involved in the area, and they
agreed it was important to divide the assets to the
Red Chinese. State would go along on the understanding
that we would divest ourselves of the private enterprise
as soon as such a divestment was feasible, and all of
the circumstances that might obtain.

Of course, the divestiture of these entities did not actually
occur until 1975. And, indeed, some of the entities still as yet

have not been divested. Mr. Houston noted, however, that:

oY

thd
~~

We did not disregard that guidance because after

Cat very considerable use of this asset during the
early ‘50's, there was a question of whether to
continue it, and the matter was taken up in the
National Security Counsel. And Allan Dulles, as
Director, opposed that we continue the ownership
and control of the assets of Air America, as it
then was known including the subsidy as needed.
And there was a subsidy at that time. It was
about $1,200,000 per year.*

This consideration by the National Security Counsel as to whether
or not to continue to retain this asset and Mr. Dulles' recommenda-
tion that it be retained occurred in 1956.

During this period of time the business of the air proprietary
consisted almost entirely of Agency cargo carriage under contracts
which were usually using a military designation. The company was
not organized, according to Houston, to fly common carriage and
had no status in the international air business.

a) The evidence indicates that during this period of time, there
were two struggles going on. One was where control should lie in
the Agency and the other was the policies to be applied to the
operation of the company itself.

The struggle within the Agency ranged all the way from

sort of quiet management discussions as to what was good

management, to-sometimes rather vociferous auguments of

whose in charge here. And the operators always said,

well, we need to call the shots because it's our operation.
And this is what we were running into all the time,

of red hot operators opposed to what we would consider good
management. é

¥A"fouston indicated that there had been a subsidy running to the
entities since 1949, "$1.2 million represented about the maximum -
subsidy given until, I believe, about 1958 was the turning point,
and from 1958 0n, there was no subsidy as such that went into a eee
The reason for that, of course, was that.the air complex had become
"money-making."

The management of the air proprietary at this time was in the
OPC structure and was therefore responsive to operations. An

example of some of the problems which were created as a result

_of this is the acquisition in August of 1950 of the entity.

Houston was participating in the negotiations. He had been in-

vited to do so by Frank Wisner.

OPC was a curious organization. Determined as being
attached to the Agency for quarters and rationing

with policy guidance from State, which was an impossible
situation. Very nice fellows were doing the negotiating
with Wisner -- Frank Lindsay and Chad Breckinridge, who

is now dead. Frank Lindsay has been head of ITEK and
quite unknown to me, when they made the agreement to
purchase carrying out the option, they gave the vendors
the right to repurchase at any time within two years.

And I thought this was-really inconsistent with our whole
position. And during the next two years they negotiated
out that repurchase agreement and in its place substituted
an agreement to give them a first refusal, if we were to
dispose of the airline. That first refusal plagued us for
years. They use to make all sorts of extraordinary claims
under it and it was never exercised and eventually it was
sort of forgotten when Chennault and Willauer died. It
ran to them personally, whether it ran to them and two
others personally, and they all are dead now. But this
shows a part of the learning curve, which was. thing we
were going through. It also became clear that the organi-
zation of the airline was really impossible, it's sort've
semi-formal partnership with the Ministry of Transportation
or the Ministry of Communications (of the Nationalist Chinese
Government) .*

That basically describes the preliminary situation from the period
1950 through 1954. It was in 1954 that George Doole first came
onboard as a consultant. Doole and Houston went to the Far East in

the summer of 1954 to observe the operation. "George went out there

ties and how well they had overcome them,’ uf Dibgars?

HW 50955 Docld:32423532 Page 147


a specifically to look at the organization of the Airline." In this
vegard, it is noted that at the time the Agency purchased the Air-
‘line it had formed a Delaware corporation to buy it which was first
called the Airdale Corporation, counsel for which was Brackley
Shaw. Shaw and Doole were both very concerned about the technical
organization ox lack of it, of the operation. Doole demonstrated

to Houston

to my satisfaction that it was an absolute situa-

tion and that no-one out there had the slightest

understanding of the problem or what they were up

against, or wanted to do anything about it (in terms

of airline management).
As a result of this Shaw and Doole planned the organization which
they thought was necessary. for the future of the operation. Hugh
Grundi was installed as-President of the corporation by the end of —

"Y 1954. Management responsibility internally was given to Lyle Shan-

non "who was a management type, although he was assigned to the
DDO, or by chat time it might have been the DDP."”

The upshot of this review by the Agency was that the theory
of running the airline was that it would be managed by manage-
ment to be responsive to Operations."but not managed by Opera-
tions."

In order to improve its cover "the Chinese not only were wil-
ling, but at that time wanted it to be the airline that showed the
flag of China.". This was done on overt records through Civil Air

Transport Company, Ltd., which was thé subsidiary of Pacific Corp>

‘oration. Pacific Corporation held title to 40 percent of the

lan

HW 50955 Docld:32423532 Page 148


Y7

equity in the corporation and 60 percent of the equity was osten-
sibly owned by the Chinese, who gave deeds of trust to the Agency
for their shares. This overt arrangement demonstrated for purposes
of international law that the company was majority-owned and con-
trolled by Chinese. The Chinese continued to press the company
to get into the international common carriage field. The company
had several DC-4's and began modest operations between Hong Kong,
Taipei and Tokyo. They graduated to DC-6's, and it was at this time
that the Agency first got into the question of competition with U.S.
industry. Northwest was then flying to Tokyo and Seoul and to
Manila, and was trying to obtain rights into Hong Kong. Don Nyrop
had noted the Agency's interest in this area when he had been
Chairman of the Civil Aeronautics Board in the late 1940's and the
early 1950's. Houston told the Committee:

He (Nyrop) became head of.Northwest, a very tight

manager, a very capable fellow, and he used to

complain that we were interfering, we were taking

passengers off his airline, and we would go to him

and say, we have to keep the airline in this busi-

ness because the Chinese say they need an international

airline. They're not ready to start their own yet.

And it is necessary to its overall cover status as a

going commercial concern.
By 1959 Mr. Nyrop was complaining that the Agency was doing too much.
Finally Nyrop decided to complain to the Civil Aeronautics Board and
the Agency agreed to place it before that Agency for a decision.
A meeting was held with the entire Board, at which time Nyrop was

able to make his case "for the fact that he was a private industry,

he. should not be interfered with by government competition."

AW 50955 DocId:32423532 Page 149.

-a-

The Agency explained its situation, the cover need, the Chinese
pressures, and the fact that they were keeping the carriage to
what they thought was a minimum that appearances could stand.
And it ended up by one of the members of the Board
turning to Nyrop and saying, Don, you ought to be
glad that you don't have a really good, reliable
‘competitor in there. He said, If you were being
competed with by private business, you'd have real
headaches. You ought to be real glad that it's not
worse than it is. And that's the end of that.
Houston conceded that some passengers were going on basically CIA
planes instead of Nyrop's Northwest planes. The impact, however,
was minimal. Moreover, the CAB in this proceeding was advised of
the.dilemma. They did participate in discussions with both the
Agency and the particular business entity that was making the com-
4 plaint, and the CAB, after hearing both sides, "came down on the
C .
side of the Agency after making a reasoned judgment."

By this time the airline's commercial international business
was not making money. A maintenance contract work, which was being
done at Taiwan, however, was "normally a money-maker, and this was
primarily, although not exclusively, with the U. S. Air Force."*

There were management problems in terms of the maintenance
aspects of this operation. This originally stemmed from the fact

#abEEFaatsAnfhedassinbdssasesssssnssassoneeansaneasnnsossanetoseerer

* The LST and barge which ‘had previously been used for maintenance
purposes became inadequate. Therefore the Agency builc a plant

in Taiwan "that is now there but has been recently disposed of to
E Systems, and a very good plant it’ was." E Systems' role in the
acquisition of proprietary assets is detailed later.

‘oe

MW 50955 Docld:32423532 Page 150


that individuals out in the field are not particularly astute at
costing their contracts. Doole gave excellent advice in this area.
Moreover, Doole was quick to advise when an tae is bordering
on not being responsive to the demands of good |management. Houston
cited one instance when Doole replaced a controller in the corpor-
ation who was very able but "had his own ideas of bookkeeping and
controls.” Doole insisted that the corporation put in bookkeeping
and controls completely consistent with U. S. CAB and FAA prac-
tices. And of course the maintenance contracts with the military
were audited constantly by the military audit teams that were
right in the plant. |

By this time the Agency had organized an exemption from the
Contract Renegotiation Board.on the grounds that if the renegotia-
tion personnel became too involved in the business, they might
xecognize that this was not a straight commercial operation and
discover the fact that the CIA was involved. The Agency went to
the head of the Contract Renegotiation Board and got a letter from
the Department of Defense asking for an exemption on what the
Agency and.the Department considered "perfectly legitimate grounds."
Indeed, there was a basis for exemption in the Renegotiation Act
if the business was entirely overseas, which was the case with this
eirline. And so, the exemption was granted on! that basis. The
Agency was concerned, however, by the fact that it had in principle
made a type of profit, over 40 percent on these Air Force mainten-

ance contracts, that might have well have been the subject of re-

HW 50955 Docld:32423532 Page 151



so.
fe wB-

a negotiation, had it not’ been subject to the exemption. "So the
question was what to do about it. And finally, we made a volun-
tary repayment against part of the profit on that contract to the
Air Force."

As noted previously, the commercial airline aspect of the
operation was not making a profit and in fact operated mostly at
a loss. Indeed, there were periods of time when the C-46's
and C-47's cargo carriers were very busy on either CIA contracts,
the Korean War, Diem Bien Phu, and other paramilitary aspects.
There would be periods in between these activities when there was
nothing for the airlines to do. Nonetheless, the airline was still
saddled with expenses such as crews’ salaries and maintenance of
the aircraft which sat on the ground.

2) So George posed, and we finally organized, the stand-

by contract, which was an apparent military entity on
Okinawa. It was our entity, but it had a military
designation. I can't remember the name for it. And
that entity contracted with Air America for so many
hours of cargo stand-by to be available any time on
call, and that they would pay so much for that capa-
bility being maintained. . , so that is. how we kept
the subsidy going to maintain them during periods
when there was not profitable flying.

Another area of concern was the question of the relationship
with the Internal Revenue Service. From the very start, the company
management was informed that they would.be required to pay the
appropriate U. S. taxes, and while there were the usual business
arguments about whether certain items were appropriate for taxation

and whether certain deductions should have been granted, the rela-

NW 50955 Docld:32423532 Page 152


s/
-a-

a tionship maintained with the IRS was basically a normal one.
Houston recalled that in the mid-50's the company, Air America,
received a notice that they were going to be audited by the IRS.
Company officials came to the Agency and indicated that this might
pose a problem in terms of security. The Agency went to the Com-
missioner of the Internal Revenue Service and indicated that
they would like to have the Commission conduct the audit and have
the audit done by a team on an unwitting basis to see what they
could find out. "We thought it would be a good test of the secur-
ity of our arrangements."
They put a very bright young fellow on and he went in-
to it. They came up with discrepancies and things that
would be settled in the normal tax argument, corporate-
IRS argument, and all of these were worked eventually,
and then we went to this fellow and said, Now, this
cs was owned and backed by the CIA, the U. S. Government.
What was your guess as to what was happening?
And he said, Well, I knew there was something there,
and I thought, what a wonderful asset it would be for
the Russians to have, but:I came to the conclusion that
it was Rockefeller money.
Thereafter, the IRS would be notified if it began to conduct an audit
on an Agency proprietary, and the audit would be discontinued. ;
As the operations of Air America developed the problem of large
cargo carriers arose. In the early days of its operation the airline
was using C-54's, which had an extremely limited range but were able
to perform notwithstanding under demanding circumstances. Discussions
proceeded during that period about modernizing the equipment and
the Agency, through the proprietary, bought DC-6AB's, a conversion
of the DC-6, which had large cargo doors installed in it. They,

ia

--.-.

(an) however, did not maintain any jet equipment at that point. This
cargo system which they developed was getting heavily into a mil-
itary air transport contract system. The system was first known
as MATS, and then it became MAC.

They got MATS contracts, and Air America got these,
and these were very good to keep a constant utiliza-
tion at a good rate, the MATS rates were usually good,
because the policy was not to do competitive bidding
for the lowest bidder because then you got the poorest
service, but give good rates to the carriers, and then
require the carrier belong to the Civil Reserve Air
Fleet.

In 1956 MATS changed its policy and required that bidders on
the contracts to be certificated. Of course, there was no. real way.
that Air America could become certificated and so the Agency decid-
ed to purchase Southern Air Transport. While it was technically

a) a separate entity, not involved in the Air America complex, it was
actually an integral part from the management point of view, in that
all management decisions were centered again in George Doole and.
the advisory team in the Agency. MAC eventually also decided to
require that bidders not only have to be certificated, but had
to have equipment qualified for the Civil Reserve Air Fleet.and
this. meant jet equipment.. As a result. the Agency went into the
acquisition of Boeing 727's. Mr. Doole eventually convinced Boeing
that they should modify the 727 to enlarge the ventral exid, which
was already in the plane, so that the plane would then have a large
airdrop capability. Boeing did so modify the plane and it proved

entirely useful for these purposes. "So the theory was that the

--

727's would be used on MAC contracts to be available on an over-
riding basis if needed for some major national security operation.
They were used, usually when they had spare time.
To my recollection, they were only called off once,
off the actual contract time, and this was for a
possible use which didn't go through. But the White
House asked if we had the capability to move some-
thing from here to there, I think from the Philippines
to somewhere in Southeast Asia, I don't recall, and so
they sent word to management that they wanted a plane
available at the earliest opportunity at Clark Field.
They pulled one of them off the MAC contract and had
it available, I think ready to go, in twelve hours,
all set for the operation. And the operation was
never called. But it showed what the capability was. -
And what they had to do was get substitute service
for the MAC contract.

During the late 1960's several Chinese airline enterprises started,
both of them on quite a small basis, but one of them which became
CAL had official backing. This occurred while the CIA's proprie-
tary was still flying under the flag of China. With the establish-
ment of these indigenous Chinese nationalist airlines which would
fly these routes, the Agency began to plan ‘reducing its inter-
national carriage work. It decided it would keep the MAC contracts
because this did not bother the Chinese. There was in fact no com-
petition in this area. But plans were started to reduce the inter-
national common carriage. This Agency proprietary, Civil Air Trans-
port Company, Ltd., which had been organized in 1954, had the right
in international air auditing! to negotiate for air routes. That
was the entity that therefore did the common carriage. Thereafter,

Air America did the American contracting followed on then by

Southern Air Transport, due to its certification. Southern was

HW 50955 Docld:32423532 Page 155


A brought on to perform the MAC and MATS contracts with planes
leased from Air America, which included 727's. Southern Air
Transport actually owned one 727 and leased two from Air America.

Houston noted that it was at this time that an internal de-
cision was made "we probably couldn't justify this major airlift
with the big jets, and so we started giving rid of them. See, they
had no utilization to speak of down in Southeast Asia. A couple of
supply flights went into India, and I think we used prop planes for
that, to my recollection." So the Agency began to phase out the
727's. This, of course, led to the decision to divest the Agency
of Southern Air Transport and eventually of Air America.

Internal management problems were assisted in 1963 by the
establishment of an executive committee of the board of directors
of the Pacific Company, Air America and Air Asia. The overt board
of directors in New York City passed a resolution organizing an
executive committee, which included Mr. Doole and two other directors.
Covertly, the Agency put with that executive committee some of its
representatives. This resulted in management and the Agency being
represented on the executive committee of the Board, and permitted
the viewpoints of management, Agency and the operators to meet in
this executive committee to consider policies and make actual deter-
minations and give guidance to the company. Houston indicated that

this mechanism was extremely effective in controlling the company.

-ap-

So I think for the last, oh, fifteen, eighteen

years, the proprietary management system was on

the whole pretty effective fromthe Agency point

of view. I think we knew what was going on. I

think we were able’ to get things up for decisions,
and if we couldn't resolve them’ at the staff level,
we would take them up to the Director for decisions;
quite different fromthe early days in the early 50's
that I described, and the operators at least made the
claim that they had the right to call the tune.

During this period of time Operations people

were getting themselves involved in the acquisition

of aircraft and which were getting awfully damned

expensive at this time, and separate projects were

going after some of this expensive equipment without

consideration of what might be available elsewhere

to the Agency by contract or old aircraft. And so

_ the Director of Central Intelligence set up EXCOMAIR,

of which I was Chairman, and had representation from

both the operation and management and finance out of

the Agency, to try and coordinate the overall control

and acquisition and disposition of aircraft.
Indeed, a February 5, 1963 memorandum entitled "Establishment of
Executive Committee for Air Proprietary Operations," noted that
the Committee was "to provide general policy guidance for the man-
agement of air proprietary projects, and review and final recommenda-
tions for approval of air proprietary project actions." Houston
indicated that EXCOMAIR "was sort of an amorphous group" which tried
to focus on the question of whether it reviewed the needs first and
then came up with recommendations on the operational solutions, or
whether the operators came up with a solution and put it through

\
EXCOMAIR. Houston noted that EXCOMAIR’‘worked on a very. informal
basis because "I knew all these people well, and I said. "Let's get

together and sort these out.'" He indicated that EXCOMAIR was

re) reasonably effective in getting overall coordination. It was re-
sponsible for making a thorough inventory of all the equipment
that the Agency had in the aviation field, and by and large was
able to keep track of who needed what and whether an asset was
available that could take care of a problem without the necessity
of acquiring a new asset.

According to Houston, a general shift in thinking at the
Agency occurred between 1968 and 1972 on the desirability of their
holding substantial contingent capacity of airlift. The records ©
seem to indicate that Mr. Houston apparently convinced the Director
in the early 1970's that the capacity should no longer should be
retained. Houston commented on this assessment as follows:

Through what knowledge I had of the utilization

4 of the various assets, it seemed to me that util-
ization, particularly of large assets, that is,
heavy flight equipment, was going down to the point
where there was very little of it. Consequently, we
couldn't forecast a specific requirement. Such re-
quirements as you could forecast were highly con-
tingent. But I also remember a couple of times —
putting the caveat into the Director that with a
changing world and with the complications in the
aviation field, once you liquidate it, you could
not rebuild, and so you ought to think very, very
carefully before getting rid of an asset that did
have a contingent capability.

X: ISSUES POSED, CONCLUSIONS, AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The preceding sections provide a general picture of the ~nature,
extent, purpose, function and problems of proprietaries. Not unlike |
other areas of our inquiry, the issues raised were not simply black
and white. They were, rather, grey in nature. During recent years,
particularly at the time of the Vietnam War, serious questions were
raised about this proprietary capability. Much of the accompanying
criticism stemmed from a lack of understanding of their role in the
scheme .of both United States foreign policy and intelligence. Some of
the criticism stemmed from the suspected entrance of some proprietaries
into areas where they were in apparent competition with legitimate
business interests, such as the airline industry. It is not unusual
that there would be misunderstanding since much of what would have
explained the proper role of these entities had to remain secret for
innumerable reasons. But the Committee has not been stymied by that
same embargo and has had a broad look into these operations.

In general, these mechanism have been operated with the utmost
concern for legality, propriety and ethical standards. What slippages
have occurred were in the field and generally in the area of air opera-
tors, not management. Moreover, their use and past expansion was a
direct result of the demands placed upon the Agency by Presidents,
Secretaries of State and the policy mechanisms of government. This is
particularly true of the large air proprietary complex which was used
to support paramilitary operations in Southeast Asia. The only
exception to this is the investment-insurance complex which was

established on Agency initiative to fill a pressing need.

A. An Overview

Using broad authority under the National Security Act of
1949, the Directors of Central Intelligence have established
Government-owned business enterprises, foundations and quasi-busi-
ness enterprises ("notionals") to serve a variety of intelligence
and covert action purposes. Chief among those purposes have been:

1) Cover for intelligence collection and action projects.

.Commercial firms established in foreign countries have
in the past and continue to provide plausible reasons for the
presence of CIA case officers. Agency-funded foundations (e.g.,
the Asia Foundation) served as conduits of funds to scholars and
groups doing research supporting U.S. foreign policy positions.

2) Extension of Agency influence and information network in
overseas business community. The very act of establishing a firm
-- e.g., an air or shipping firm -- requires banking, insurance,
and other services that entail support, communications, and inti-
mate business relationships with the bonafide American and foreign
commercial world. In turn, this entails at a minimum the clearance
and access of outside top management into Agency business; the
relationship on occasion can entail using the Agency's commercial
contacts for information or assistance.

3) Provide supporting services for covert” operations.

In paramilitary operations, airlife and sealift by Agency-owned
carriers has many advantages -- flexibility, ability to implant
photographic equipment and other sensors, etc. CIA agents, engaged
in hazardous business ordinarily uninsurable, can obtain commercial

insurance at standard or subsidized rates via MHMUTUAL, a conglomerate

NW 50955 DocId:32423532 Page 160


-131-

of some 26 CIA-owned companies. In country locations where
physical contact with the nearest CIA station is not operationally
discreet, proprietaries can provide pay outlets and other adminis-
trative services for CIA personnel and agents. On occasion, firms
based in locations with permissive corporate laws and regulations
-- -- can engage in many activities
unrelated to their charters. For example, insurance firms can
acquire real estate surrounding targeted embassies on a non-attri-
buted basis.

4) Actual conduct of covert action. In establishing the

"radios" (Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty) in the 1950's,

CIA acquired a means of directly influencing populations behind

the Iron Curtain. These, of course, were eventually disposed of
and placed under the aegis of the Department of State, but related
enterprises, such as the book distribution program, which had
operated under radio sponsorship, continued within the Agency frame-
work.

5) Outlets for private investment. The Agency would deny

that this is a purpose of proprietaries. Agency officials state

that the standing policy is to prohibit the investment of operational
funds of the CIA into private fields without explicit DCI authoriza-
tion. Actually, the existence of proprietary enterprises which,

on occasion, return sizable profits, affirms that private investment
has indeed been a widespread Agency policy. Moreover, the Agency
specifically has authorized MHMUTUAL to act as an institutional in-
vestor for its own and any other Agency proprietary. So the question

really is one of definition and shading.

B. Size of U.S. Financial Stakes

The size and variety of U.S. Government financial stakes in
CIA proprietaries has already been described in great detail.
The attached Table I gives an overview of proprietary income and
expenditures over the years. Some 450 proprietaries have been
ereated over the years with 20 presently active (See Table II.)
The largest sixteen proprietaries received about 80% of U.S. in-
vestment (i.e., subsidies). Accordingly, most proprietaries are
shown to be small-scale operations. In many cases -- the so-called
"notionals" -- the overseas proprietary actually conducts no business
at all; it simply has a commercial charter, staff, and cover arrange-
ments for Agency collection and action projects.

Table I also shows that proprietary income consists of a mixture
of CIA subsidy and income. In some cases, the outside income is
from sources outside the U.S. Government income -- e.g., Air America
has received income for aircraft maintenance of KLM airliners in
Southeast Asia. But for the most part, proprietary income is in the
form of "crtoss-orders," from CIA and other Government Agencies.
For example, the CIA paramilitary project in the Congo placed orders
for aircraft engines and pilot services with Intermountain Aviation,
Inc. As an example of order placed by other U.S. Government Agencies,
AID contracted with Air America to carry rice shipments in Laos.
In this sense, many proprietaries are analagous to what are called
“intragovernmental funds" or "industrial funds" in traditional U.S.
Government budget and accounting terms.

Table I shows, and as we remarked previously, that compared
with earlier years, the size of proprietary expenditures has markedly

declined. The potential for future expansion is nevertheless present.

NW 50955 DocId:32423532 Page 162


-133-

Indeed, new proprietaries have. been formed within the last
several years.

In terms of U.S.. budgetary impact, Table I indicates that
proprietaries do not add much new capital to CIA available resources
-- i.e., while they have a very large expenditure level and momentum
over the years, the "cross-order" phenomenon means that most of
these expenditures originated in CIA and other U.S. Government
appropriations and that net profits generated by outside business
or investment have been relatively small. On the other hand, another
way of interpreting the figures is to observe that nearly half the
$1.6 billion gross income of CIA proprietaries has been supplied
by sources outside CIA.

Table II shows the pattern of income, expense, and net U.S.
investment for the twenty largest proprietaries now active, review-
ing their financial experience in the twelve months preceding
June 30, 1975, or the indicated reference date. The two biggest
proprietaries, Air America and MHMUTUAL, are seen to dwarf the
others. Air America will be. phased out by June 30, 1976, ending
CIA's owned airlift and returning an estimated $20 million to the
U.S. Treasury. MHMUTUAL will continue.

Today, the CIA operates 45 major proprietaries, of which 25
are in the process of liquidation. The 16 biggest proprietaries
did a gross total of $4 million business in 1975, compared with an
average volume of $75 million annually in the heyday period of
proprietaries, 1967-1973, exclusive of CIA subsidies. On the subsidy
front ,, the contrast is equally striking: no net subsidy in_1975 vs.’
$26 million annual subsidy in the 1967-73 period, Put differently,
if these sixteen biggest proprietaries had operated throughout

NW 50955 Dasha:A4I532 1Pagb pexiod at the level of gross income of all


-134-

kinds realized in 1975 ($4 million), the total gross income would
have aggregated $116 million. Actually, the CIA reports that

for this for this period gross income aggregated at $1,606 million.
; By this measure, CIA's biggest proprietaries are shadows of their
former selves; their annual gross income of $4 million is about
one-fourteenth of the average gross annual income of $55 million
during the 29-year span. Shrinkage would be even greater if these
figures were adjusted for the effect of inflation.

The chief impact is decline of the bigger air proprietaries.
The Agency estimates that of some $761 million of outside income,
at least $658 million was generated by Air America ($559 million)
and Southern Air Transport ($99 million), in the period from incep-
to 1975. As late as 1974, these two-airlines were garnering some
$50 million in outside contracts. With their disposal, total CIA
proprietary annual outside income in 1975 therefore shrinks to ~*
the ‘cited $4 million level. Most of this residual is represented -
by MHMUTUAL, the insurance investment complex, where Agency invest-
ment are generating an outside income of about $3.5 million annually.
In programmatic terms, this contrast of today and yesterday

reflects the decline of paramilitary operations in Southeast Asia.
Large volumes of outside orders by Defense and AID, along with
sizable levies by CIA components and some maintenance and passenger
income from commercial operations, had been generated by a covert
war. In turn, these operations had their echoes in Agency air
support for the Congo, Cuba, and other areas. Looking toward the

future, will new air proprietaries be established? The CIA thinks

HW 50955 Docld:32423532 Page 164


-135-

not -- but the matter is not resolved as discussion below indi-

cates. Ultimately the program question is whether there will

be future U.S. involvement in covert wars -- and whether, if so,

some substitute for CIA-owned air support can meet the operational

requirements of secure, well-maintained local aircraft in place,

with responsive schedules and capacity to gather a limited amount

of signals and imagery intelligence. The Chief of CSS ventured

the possibility that third-country assets could be used. Another

possibility is use of U.S. military aircraft, overtly or "sanitized".
One thing became clear: CIA sees itself as entering a different

era of proprietaries. It has rejected the long-held doctrine of

"stand-by" capability -~ i.e., the notion that it is worth investing

considerable capital and operating resources in airlift, sealifr,

and other assets primarily targeted toward contingency requirements.

Instead, assert the Agency representatives, CIA is keeping today's

and tomorrow's proprietaries strictly centered on current operational

tasks. The test of retention is the utility of a proprietary in

carrying out assigned roles instrumental in approved Agency projects.
This concept can be examined by listing the twenty major proprie-

taries which the Agency says will survive into the post-1976 time

frame:

The above listing covers only the 20 biggest proprietaries
which currently operate and which will survive liquidation. It
excludes 25 major proprietaries currently operational but being
phased out -- such as Air America and other airlift.

What does the whole picture of currently operated proprietaries
look like? How many and by what major types?

The Numbers of CIA Proprietaries, by type,
as of July, 1974 are:
71

Operating proprietaries
(includes 21 props. in MUTUAL insurance complex)

Non-operating proprietaries 38
Devised facilities 31
Devised facilities/Notionals (‘DFN'''s) 61
Subtotal, externally registered “20r~
Notionals -- no external registration;

Identity and financing wholly

Grand total, current proprietaries 416

HW 50955 Docld:32423532 Page 166


-137-

i Generally, the notionals have increased in number by about
— 30% since the current CCS chief's takeover of Cover operations
in 1967, This reflects a policy of increasing the number of
cutout arrangements to increase security -- i.e., reduce likeli-
hood of outside discovery of the identity of agents or case
officers working under cover of, the end-point notional by intro-
ducing intermediate ne peeaneaa for payments or identity backstops

What does this paar hg tell us about basic distinctions of
one type of proprietary from another? First, it indicates that
external registration divides the pot in half. Those which have
some form of legal standing with U.S. (State, local) and foreign .
corporate regulatory and tax authorities are subject to external
governmental scrutiny. This occasions additonal expense and man-
power to assure that in all respects this group of proprietaries
behaves in accordance with local law and commercial expectations.
The second group -- the notionals -- exist only as names on doors
and phone directories and scationery, with backstopping for identi-
fication provided by Agency switchboards, mailstops, and check
issuance.

The next level of distinction is within the class of legally
registered proprietaries: those which carry on a commercial in-
come~producing operation and those which are simply cover arrange-
ments, with at most a bank account and an attorney backstopping
calls and mail. The latter are shown in the table above as
"devised faciltiies" and "DFN''s.

Within the class of commercial, income--productive proprietaries,

there is a distinction between those which are wholly dependent upon

MW 50995 DocId:32423532 Page 167


-138-

CIA income in the form of orders placed and/or subsidies; and
those which have mixed outside and inside income.

Even for those with mixed income, it is possible over the
years to distinguish those which have outside income wholly within
the U.S. Government (i.e., a mix of ClA-derived income and income
from other Government agencies) and those which have both U.S.

Government income and income from private contracts.

C. “Visibility in the Budget

Accountability to the President and Congress depends in budget
review upon the extent to which the Federal agencies’ budget
review upon the extent to which the Federal agencies' budget re-
quests provide enough information to make possible well-formed
judgments. Therefore, Circular A-11, issued by the Office of Manage-
ment and Budget, prescribes the financial schedules and analytical
and explanatory supporting data which all Federal agencies must
provide in their budget submissions, consistent with the Budget and
Accounting Acts of 1920 and 1950 as amended.

The Central Intelligence Agency regards itself as subject to
these prescriptions. The Agency limits its application of this
principle, however to provision of such A-11 materials as OMB and
the Congress ask for.

With regard to proprietaries, this policy has resulted in
near invisibility of proprietaries in the CIA budget submission.
Circular A-1l1 requires agencies to provide schedules and narrative

’ for each public enterprise or intragovernmental fund. The utility

of such data is to reveal all sources of funding, purposes and

AW 50955 DocId:32423532 Page 168


-139-

levels of expenditure, and at least approximate indications

of performance through comparisons of past and proposed funding
by activity. As applied to proprietaries, the CIA, perhaps,
should have been providing a whole family of schedules for the
proprietaries which actually do business (i.e., excluding
“notionals.")

Then, there is the question of the program impact of propri-
etaries. Table I indicates that proprietaries in fact have been
heavily involved in CIA intelligence collection and covert action.
None of this is shown in the CIA budget submission. Yet a bona-
fide policy review of the budget requires programmatic judgments
of the necessity and appropriate use of proprietaries in overseas
areas. ‘i

The Angolan. question has brought into sharp focus the role
of the CIA's Contingency Reserve. All U.S. aid to forces in
Angola came from this fund. The only place in the budgets of CIA
where proprietaries have taken on even a limited visibility is in
those yeats when supplemental financing was needed to establish or
strengthen a proprietary. The budget then shows, tersely, that
for a past year or for completed portions of the current years
that Contingency Reserve drawdowns had been made for such purposes.
For example, one past budget showed a certain’amount for "RFE,"
meaning a subsidy for Radio Free Europe, but providing no justifica-
tion materials. In turn, this practice reflects the unwritten,
post-hoc nature of the Contingency Reserve financing process -- in
effect, an Executive Branch supplemental in which Congress is in-
formed after the OMB has acted. The budget does not normally indi-

cate Agency intentions to create or establish a proprietary in the

HW 50955 Docld:32423532 Page 169


~140-

budget year ahead. For any other Federal agency, the notion
of establishing a new publicly owned enterprise without advance
notice to the Appropriations and substantive committees of
Congress would be proscribed.

For the small-scale proprietaries, those which require small
subsidies to get underway, CIA is able to launch them without
supplemental financing -- i.e., within its regular budget --
and, therefore, these remain completely invisible in the Agency

budget submission.
D. Some General Considerations

a., The relationship of utility to size: The evidence estab-

lished a dilemma faced by CIA planners who recognize that propri-
etaries can sometimes be most effective operationally when they
are large; indeed, as in Laos, there can be a thrust toward enormity
imposed by the very nature of the operation. The dilemma is that
large size conflicts with deniability: In areas of the world or
types of activity where there is little commercial appeal or few
operating commercial firms, where would large-scale enterprises

get financing but from the U.S, Government? Laotion operations
actually could not be covered in the end. The experience suggests
that proprietaries may have limited utility for paramilitary opera-
tions in the future.

b. The-factor of competition with private enterprises. Do

CIA proprietaries of the income-producing. class unfairly compete

with private U.S. businesses, both with regard to their Government

financing and their secrecy? Is the utility to the Government of

NW 50955 Docld:32423532 Page 170


-141-

such a kind and of such magnitude that CIA proprietaries should
be retained regardless of their competitive impact? Generally,
the CIA believes that CIA operating proprietaries do not compete
with U.S. private enterprise because they tend to do things which
the latter are not equipped, motivated, or staffed to perform.

For example, CIA proprietaries purchase weapons and foreign arma-
ments and technical devices; conduct security clearances; purchase
real estate; insure uninsurable risks; train foreign policy forces;
run airlines in remote areas or on commercially unattractive
routes. Would private enterprise do any or all of these things;
It is true that private enterprise does a lot of similar activity
under contract to the Government, including highly sensitive con-
tracts for CIA in technical intelligence collection and research
and development. If CIA scrapped its proprietaries and coopted
private firms, suitably cleared, would this be more desirable in
‘policy terms? In economy? In operational flexibility?

ec. Relative scarcity of commercial and official cover. The
continuing push of CIA for notionals reflects the scarcity of U.S.
Government official cover in many areas of the world, the develop-
ing desire of U.S. companies not to cooperate.

Some question concerning profits have been raised. Does pro-
prietary profit constitute a significant add-on to the resources
available to CIA? How is such profit treated in the budget? How
is it controlled? How can the Congress.(or the President, for that
matter) be sure that proprietary profits are not siphoned off to’

accomplish projects not countenanced by the regular CIA budget?

MW 50955 Docld:32423532 Page 171


-142-

First, profits (defined as net income to a proprietary after
coverage of operating expenses) are relatively small. Even in
the days when the most profitable air proprietaries were at full
swing, the most that any single firm netted was $3.9 million (Air
America in 1967). Over the entire period 1947-1975, total pro-
fits have. been $50 million, an average of about $1.6 million
annually, for the 16 biggest CIA proprietaries. And in these
years, a net loss was sustained three times -- $2.5 million

in 1971, $0.5 million in 1973, and $0.3 million in

1975. Looking to the future, after liquidation of the air pro-
prietaries has been completed, there is forecast to be only one
profitable proprietary: MHMUTUAL a complex of insurance, reinsurance
and, and escrow-holding companies which derives most of its pro-

fit from investment portfolios. MUTUAL's net income in 1974 was
$1.8 million and this general magnitude of profit is expected in

the foreseeable future.

As for treatment in the budget, there is both a policy and
procedural aspect. The policy of CIA has changed; in February,
1975 the General Counsel of CIA ruled that profits of proprietaries
and proceeds of liquidation must be returned to the Treasury as
miscellaneous receipts and cannot be used to augment the Contingency
Reserve or otherwise be applied to CIA operations. This ruling
overturned the practice of the past which, on the few occasions
where profits were not applied to augment net worth of proprietaries
--i.e., plowed back into the enterprise or investment portfolios--,
was to apply proprietary net proceeds to the Contingency Reserve

for later release to operations.

NY 50955 Docld:32423532 Page 172


: -143-

The budgetary presentation and review procedures only par-
tially focus upon proprietary profits. MUTUAL's profits are
invisible in the Agency budget; they are taken into account and
subject to scrutiny only within CIA; operationally, the DDO annual
operational review has the most detailed grasp of MUTUAL at the
Agency review levels. A stadard set of public enterprise fund
schedules, as prescribed by OMB Circular A-11, would be appropri-
ate for making MUTUAL visible in the Agency budget. Other commer-
cial proprietaries should show these schedules as well, The
Agency has indicated that the Comptroller is working with DDO and
DDA to develop a new style and content of budgetary presentation
and review procedures for CIA proprietaries in future budgets.

To what extent can these new procedures prevent abuses of
proprietary profits? To what extent do they preclude the need
for legislation in this area? What form of Congressional oversight
is needed here-- at what point should Congress exert control?
Improvement of visibility in the budget of proprietary resources
and provision for review of the major proprietaries as a regular
part of budget review by CIA, OMB, and Congressional Committees
would seem to preclude most of the dangers of abuse. On the other
hand, there is one type of abuse for which additional Congressional
scrutiny and safeguards may be needed: the possibility of a small-
scale, high-risk covert project directed by the President or DCI
which is not covered by the regular appropriation but financed by
proprietary profits. No foolproof preventives can be designed by
law or regulation; nevertheless, the possibility of such abuse or

avoidance of Congressional review can be minimized by requiring

NW 50955 DocId:32423532 Page 173


-144-

that all CIA proprietaries have an operational charter approved

by Congress which forbids launcing activities by proprietaries

or using their funds which are contrary to the charter. This
internal CIA standard would probably strengthen the existing
requirement that covert action projects be certified by the
President and flagged to Congressional Committees. At present,
MHMUTUAL has such a charter (not reviewed or set by Congress) which
restricts MUTUAL to insurance operations. This charter was
established in 1974 (called an "Administrative Plan") and must

be formally amended before the Chief of Cover Staff will authorize

use of MUTUAL resources for other missions.

D. Private Investment by CIA.

The authority of the Agency to engage in private investments
and its general policy ambivalence on this matter already have been
noted. Two types of general as well as budget issues are presented,
one the inverse of the other: 1) Could or should CIA engage in
investments which could accumulate funds outside the budget process
and hence be available for operations that have not public scrutiny
outside CIA? 2) Is CIA investment policy too restrictive in regard
to bank deposits? Specifically, should CIA place large amounts of
money in private banks without charging interest? Some 20% of its
annual of appropriated and advanced funds goes into
private deposit here and abroad, with year-end balances of about
$150 million and average deposits considerably greater. The banks
selected get an interest or investment bonus. Their selection is
non-competitive, rooted in historic circumstance, albeit in insti-

tutions that have shown themselves flexible and responsive in

NW 50955 Docld:32423532 Page 174


-145-

providing the Agency services. Much more investigation is

needed here. and we encourage the new oversight committee to

study this issue in greater detail than we have been able.
Probably this is one area where exclusion of the General Account-
ing Office from CIA audits has had an unfortunate effect: Whether
or not there has been abuse, there is no outside reviewer of a
complex set of financial records and relationships and conse-
quently the question of confidence in the Agency's role in this
area may have been eroded.

What is the future for proprietaries?

Discussion on these questions already has been covered in part.
No new proprietaries are in formation or planned. This past fis-
cal year, 1975, one new proprietary was created to purchase a site
for the new location of the New York CIA base; it serves as a
real estate holding company or lessor for land and building.

The main provison for new growth is the plan of some years
standing for establishment in MHMUTUAL of several corporate "shells"
-- legally constituted and registered companies that do very little
commercial business but which can be adapted to various new CIA
missions. To adapt to these new missions, as noted, would require
CIA to amend the MUTUAL Administrative Plan. But this could be
done quickly; the existence of the shells avoids the leadtime of
creating new corporate entities, with all the complications of
local laws and risk of exposure.

While CIA proprietaries are small today compared with yesterday,

they are so largely for administrative reasons-- i.e., responsive

HW 50955 Docld:32423532 Page 175


-146-

to Executive Branch direction. In this sense, there is no
reason in law, although there may well not be another era or
set of occasions when CIA will find proprietary expansion to
be operationally desirable. The Congress should be a partner
in the process of reviewing such expansion, if it should occur,
by providing for changes in the charter process. Another approach
is the setting of substantive guidelines for proprietary operation.
This approach is typified by the post-Katzenbach guidelines that
prohibit CIA operation of tax-exempt foundations.
Lawrence R. Houston, the former General Counsel of the Agency,
was intimately involved with all of the proprietaries for his
entire tenure with CIA. Consequently, his views have been invalu-
able to the Committee in reviewing and evaluating the history
and the role of these mechanisms. In the course of a far-ranging
interview with the Committee Houston concluded that proprietaries
“should be the last resort for use to backstop Agency activities."
He grounded this opinion on the fact that:
they are cumbersome. To be properly run they take
many, many man-hours of many, many different parts of
the Agency, so they are expensive in man-hours. There
are built-in difficulties in rumning what appears to be
a normal business for operational purposes. There's
really a built-indichotomy there that leads to a contin-
ual conflict with policies. And due to the number of
people involved, there is a security problem on the
old grounds that security doesn't go by the mathematical
increase in the number of people. It goes geometrically
as to the number of people, the security risk.

This assessment seems correct based on all the evidence.

The current Director of Central Intelligence has insisted on
the streamlining of such operations, and is keenly aware of the

potential for abuse. (See appendix F). It is, for example,

HW 50955 Docld:32423532 Page 176


-147-

the current written policy of the Agency that "to the degree that
domestic proprietary or cover companies are required, a clear
justification will be developed as to the relationship of their
support of our overseas operations."

In the one area of continuing large-scale activity, the
investiment complex, the Director has moved to insure propriety
even in an area where there is no evidence that any illegal con-
duct has occurred. The current policy, established as of
June 1975 is:

Project MHMUTUAL will be operated in confotmance with
appropriate legal restrictions. Arrangements are being
made for the briefing of the appropriate Congressional
committees. Particular attention will be given to
avoiding any possible conflict of interest situations
with firms with which the Agency has contracts. Parti-
cular concern will also be exhibited over possible
improper influence on the stock market or stock dealings
through the investments involved in MHMUTUAL.
The Committee is mindful of the potential danger inherent in such
operations. Therefore, it recommends that the review of this
and other similar projects by the appropriate oversight Committees
be stringent in the extreme. —

The disposal of proprietaries has also generally proceeded
along legal and ethical lines with more than due concern for con- i
flicts of interest. Most notable in this spectrum of actions was
the degree to which the Agency tried and did in fact avoid any
conflicts of interest when it sold off Southern Air Transport.
Such internal vigilance no doubt should and will continue. More-
over, with the establishment of a permanent oversight committee,
the CIA's job in this regard will be made easier because it will

be able to report on its dealings on a regular basis and avoid

criticism.

a SO

There exist two airline corporatiotis wholly owned by the
United States Government, which corpotations were purchased by, and
are undex the direct control of, the Central Intelligence Agency. Owner sh!
of the corporations was ere by means of appropriated funds expended
by the Agency under its confidential funds authority, the ee ‘thus

being made outside of the Federal Property and Administrative Services

Act. Both corporations were created by the Agency to assist it in fulfill:
its statutory responsibilities and, ever the years, both have engaged in .
many sensitive support activities in the furtherance of the national security

of the United States. It has been widely reported in unclassified media ‘that

tee

the Central Intelligence Agency on behalf of the United States Government
the de facto owner of the corporations. Notwi hstanding, that ownership is.
still a classified fact. The activities and missions of these corporations

in support of the national security of the United States would have been

S

impossible if United States Government ownership had been officiall

admitted. Within this context it is the statutory responsibility of the Direc:

of Central Intelligence to protect the overt commercial posture o

coxporations and the cla

the Director has determined that the corporations ave no longer veauired

py the Agency in the discharge of its responsibilities, that they are excess

to Agency requirements, nd he has directed that they be disposed of

either by sale or liquidatioa.

agit i STATUTES - Ciel

The Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949,.

“as amended, (40 U.S.C. A, 471 et seq. > hereinafter referred to as ithe

Act"), is in general the controlling statute insofar as Government’ property
: a ;

is procured, used and disposed of:

It is the intent of the Congress in enacting this =
Jegislation to provide for the Government an economical
and efficient system for {a) the procurement and supply
of personal propexty and nonpersonal services, including
xelated functions such as contracting, inspection, storage,
issue, specifications, property identification and class
E ‘ cation, transportation and traffic management, establish-
ment of pools or systems for transportation of Government
personnel and property by motor. vehicle within specific
areas, management of public utility services, repaixing
and-converting, establishment of inventory levels, establish-
ment of forms and procedures, and representation before
Federal and State reguletory podies; (b) the utilization of :
available property; (c) the disposal of surplus property; and -
(a) records management. 40.U.S.C.A. 471.

As an executive agency, the Central Intelligence Agency is within the purv

of the Act (40 U.S.C. A. 472; 481), but along with 2 nuraber of other agenc'

the Housing and Home Finance Agency with respect

‘to the disposal of residential property; the Atomic

Agency. ‘w : uF

Tt is not intended by these exemptions that those anes
_ administering the agencies or programs listed shall ‘ i
be free from all obligation to comply with the pro~
visions of the act or from all jurisdiction of the i

disposition by the Agency should be anything othér than confidential? The

Ig. ARGUMENT

The braad authority afforded the Agency by Section Bld), supra,

is conclusive—'"(t)he sums made available to the Agency may be expended
without regard to the provisions of law and regulations relating to the
“expenditure of Government funds; ...." That authority is enhanced, not .

limited, by the Act—'"(N)othing shall impaiz or affect the authority of.

the Central Intelligence Agency", and by the Act's legislative history. It

follows ‘patuxally that the Agency's authority to procure ona confidential

basis without recourse to the Act inherently carries with it the authority
y :

to dispose on a confidential basis without recourse to the Act. By way of |

et

an extreme hypothetical, suppose the Agency had procured a Say
weapons system, without Soviet knowledge. Using Section 8(b) authority,

it had expended funds through a secure facility for the procurement and ”

brought the system to this country where it was studied and tested. By

virtue of the testing the Government was able to develop electronic counter

measures which would effectively nullity the system. Upon a determinatio:

that the systern is of no further use, can it be seriously argued that its ~~

purchase was confidential; possession of it by the United States Governmex!
was confidential; and, the knowledge gained and the countermeasures -
developed are confidential. To hold otherwise would render the intended

statements on the rules of statutory construction are helpful, For

The rule whereby a statute is, by necessary cs

implication, extended has been most frequently :

_ applied. in the_construction of laws delegating powers
to public officers and administrative agencies...
Thus where the power to create an office is granted,
the power to abolish it will be: implied, and where an
administrative body is given power to enact regulations
or exercise quasi-judicial power, the power to provide
for internal rules of procedure will be implied.... The
power of a municipality to sue and be sued was held to
imply the power to employ special counsel for those pur~
poses although the city had a regular salaried attorney.
A municipality, empowered by, statute to construct Peniee
for the preservation of the public health, interest an
convenience, was permitted to construct a protecting s wall
and pumping plant which were unnecessaty for the proper
working of the sewer, but were essential to public health.

8. ADBUNISTRATIVE “PLANS, LIQUIDATION PLANS, AND FISCAL
ANNEXES

a, GENERAL |
(1) Im the furtherance of some Agency objectives it is necessary to establish,
operate and Support overt Instrumentalities which do not have ostensible
affiliation with the U.S. Government. These ostensibly private, organiza-
tions which may be susceptible to-scrutiny by a variety of tax and regula-
tory authorities, the press, hostile elements and others, require operational
security of a high order. It is essential that they are established and
managed in accordance with normal practices and requirements of the
type of enterprise concerned, and that they are staffed with qualified
personnel whose cover histories are compatible with such employment.
It is also essential that there are adequate general management, financial
and security controls consistent with both operational.effectiveness and
the requirements ia nonattribution, for the protection of the Agency's
interests.
» (2) The controls and procedures which are applicable to an instrumentality
.é will be specified in a project outline and administrative plan or fiscal
annex, Standards and format for administrative plans and fiscal annexes,
“as well as for liquidation plans to be followed when an instrumentality is
to be discontinued, are prescribed in HB 230-1.

b. POLICY .
(1) The establishment or continuance of an “instrumentality is justified only
when it contributes to the accomplishment of the Agency's mission and
fs operationally determined to be the. most advantageous means of gaining
a particular and necessary objective. The purpose of an instrumentality
shall be to conduct secret operations or support such operations under
cover of its overt function.
(2) No binding commitment with respect to the establishment of any in-
strumentality shall be made before the approval required by this regu-
lation has been obtained.

C ~ DEFINITIONS 5

(1) PROJECT. “A project is a mariagement device through which specific
operational activities are undertaken to meet programmed objectives.
Budgeting and finarcial accountability are maintained against the project
for funds and resources authorized for it.

(2) INSTRUMENTALITY.’ An instrumentality is a corporation, a foundation,
partnership, sole proprietorship, or other legal entity (within the private
sector, domestic or foreign) for which specific,funds or other assets
have been authorized under a formally approved project. Within a project
there may be one or ‘more instrumentalities.

«= (3) Proprietary. A proprietary is an instrumentality in which the Agency
acquires ownership of a controlling interest, through appropriate
nominee or legal entity arrangements. The Agency exercises, through
stockholder or other equity arrangements, control of the instru~
mentality in terms of the policy, administration, formulation of
budgets, and the application of funds.

(b) Operational Investment. An operational investment js the acquisition
by the Agency of an equity in an instrumentality, through appropriate
nominee or legal entity arrangements, of less than a controlling
interest, with. the expectation of recovering some or all of its invost-
ment. Anyi influence the Agency ma tt over budget formulation and

the application of funds Isa matter of negotiation. (NOTE: Operational

Joans shall be handled in accordance with provisions of HR 30-9

and chapter IX of HHB 30-1.)

{c) Subsidy. A subsidy is the contribution of funds or materiel to an-
instrumentality by the Agency, with the Agency acquiring no equity
in the assets nor right of participation in either the income or
the profits of the entity. (Payments to forelgn liaison services are
excluded {rom this definition.) There are two types of subsidy:

(1) Controlled. A controlled subsidy involyes support of an instru-
mentality whose income is primarily derived from Agency funds
and which ts therefore’ largely dependent upon such support. To
the extent that the Agency Is able to exercise control it does so
through the formulation of budgets, the requirement for financial
accountings, and the application of funds. Where a project consists
of a combination of separate subsidy and proprietary instrumen-
talities, proprietary regulations will be applied to the proprietary
instrumentality. i
Noncoritrolled. A noncontrolled subsidy imvolves Support of an
instrumentality, to which negotiated fixed-sum incentive. pay-
ments of Agency funds are made, but budget formulation and
the exerclse of discretion over! expenditures are at a point es-
sentially beyond Agency control Evaluation of performance ds
a matter of operational judgment, not necessarily related to the
amount of the fixed-sum payments.

(da) Funding and Payrolling Instrumentalities. A funding or payroling
instrumentality is used to fund or payroll Agency activities when, for
reasons of security or cgver, funding or payrolling must be accuraplished

2" through an overt mechanism. The Agency has Jegal or beneficial owner-

ship of a funding or payrolling instrumentality through appropriate

nominee or Jegal entity arrangements. Although these instrumentalities

EB are proprietaries, they operate under special authorizations that may
ae yary substantially from the requirements of this regulation and

HEB 230-1.

(3) PROJECT OUTLINE. A project outline is a written plan for accomplishing
programmed operational objectives. Upon approval by appropriate au-
thority it becomes the framework within which the project is implemented
and its effectiveness initially evaluated. uisierers
(4) PROJECT RENEWAL. A project renewal is the approval after evaluation

by appropriate authority for continuation of a project beyond the period

6

o** ypdate or supersede certain provisions of the project outlines
“(5) ADMINISTRATIVE PLAN. An administrative plan is a supplement to
.the project outline which upon approval by appropriate authority consti-
tutes the administrative framework within which the instrumentality is
to operate. To that extent it replaces all Agency regulations, except this -
regulation and HR 230-9,.in the management of project instrumentalities,
their internal activities and non-Agency employees.. An administrative
* plan Js required for all projects establishing and utilizing proprietaries,
operational investments, funding and payrolling instrumentalities, and
i controlled subsidies. :
| ‘TERMINATION. Termination is the discontinuance of a project or an
, jnstrumentality, upon written approval of the Deputy Director or Head
—_— of Independent Office concerned.
“eau! | (7) LIQUIDATION. Liquidation is the settlement of accounts of an instru-
: mentality, the final disposition of its remaining assets, and dissolution of
the instrumentality. :

promote : Gea : peace eat

a. the most effective management, to include staffing of each i
mentality with personnel qualified to manage it in accordagce with:
Agency objectives, under sound personnel policies and practices;

b.- ‘the establishment of an effective budgeting, accounting, and re-
: porting system that will produce accurate, timely, and useful re-
Cc \. ports of financial status and financial results of the operations
of each instrumentality; ft penser t 7 .
c:. the establishment of an accounting system for the instrumentalities
that is compatible and reconcilable with Agency financial records;

d.. the highest degree of cover and security compatible with’ the overt
character of each instrumentality and its operation or support
objectives;

x

the effective Agency control of funding to, and assets held by, the
instrumentalities; : :

state the project's operational objectives, the reason why it is believed’
that an instrumentality is the most advantageous means for attaining the
objective, the type of instrumentality to be used, funds approved for

the current year, funds programmed for the ensuing fiscal year, and, in
the case of a revised plan, a statement as, to the need for the revision

.+.. operating budget, to authorize the continuation of the activity,

under which funds may be advanced, controlled, expended, and
accounted for, within the terms of the approved operating
budget of the project. Th¢ approved operating budget of the
project provides a basis for an objective evaluation of the
real (total) cost of the activity, to include: ae

we (a) “Finds Available” ~~
» Clear identification of funds either available or presumed
to be available to the project (or instrumentality) from
all sources during the period of the proposed operating
budget, which will include :

(1) any prior-year funds (beginning cash balance, in-
~ - cluding liquid assets) ; fitted ~

(2) other U.S. Government (non-CIA) funds;

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Central Intelligence

SUBJECT: Proprietary Withdrawals and the Contingency Reserve

1, Iam attaching a memorandum of law entitled "Proprietary
Withdrawals and the Contingency Reserve." This was discussed with you
last week. :

2. Itis obvious that a number of policy decisions and actions will
flow.from this decision. Our congressional committees need to be appro-
priately informed, the Comptroller will need to work out certain adjustments
with OMB, and I also believe there are certain policy decisions that the
Comptroller will have to work out with Finance with respect to pending
transactions which would have placed returns from proprietaries in the
Reserve. I shall send copies of.this memorandum of law to all interested
components and will assist them in any way they wish.

MEMORANDUM OF LAW
SUBJECT: Proprietary Withdrawals and the Contingency Reserve

REFERENCES: A. Memo to DCI fr C/CCS, dtd 8 Jan 74, subj:
Project MHMUTUAL Policy

B. Memo for the Record fr Comptroller, dtd 19 Aug 74,
same subject

1. Reference A recommended that there be returned to the Agency
Reserve starting with calendar year 1973 that portion of MHMUTUAL annual
profits not required for Project needs. The Director approved the basic
paper on 8 February, but noted "surplus funds from MHMUTUAL earnings _
will be returned to the Treasury rather than the Agency Reserve." :
Reference B recorded a telephone decision by the Director that " fw7hen
funds are withdrawn from proprietaries, they will be transferred to the
Contingency Reserve...."

2. ‘The purpose of this paper is to examine the legal aspects of these
policy decisions. The concept of the Reserve was established in 1952 as a
means by which the Agency would have flexibility to fund projects or
activities which had not been contemplated in the normal appropriation
request. Its purpose was.to create a mechanism to provide funds for:
unforeseeable requirements which would be more rapid and secure than
the supplemental appropriation procedure employed by other Government
agencies. The Reserve has been funded by direct appropriation and by
transfer of unobligated appropriations at appropriate times after the close

” - of the fiscal year. Funds were and are released from the Reserve only with |

the approval of OMB with subsequent notice of each Reserve withdrawal
furnished. in writing to the two appropriations committees.

3. In lieu of a specific annual appropriation act for the Agency,
OMB by letter notifies the chairmen of the two appropriations committees
that the Agency budget of a specific number of dollars is contained in the
DOD appropriation request. The letter also specifies the accounts in which
these funds are located. In the past where there were appropriations to the
Reserve, that letter would specify the amount of the operating budget and
the amount to be applied to the Reserve. After committee action, appropriate
letters, sometimes separately and sometimes jointly signed by the chairmen
of the two committees, are sent to OMB specifying what has been approved
for the Agency budget and confirming the accounts in which they are located.
Thereafter, the necessary transfers to the Agency are accomplished pursuant
to the authority of Section 5 of the CIA Act of 1949, which was specifically
worded so as to permit appropriations for the Agency to be placed in the .
accounts of other agencies and then transferred to the Agency free of all
limitations and restrictions on the appropriation from which transferred.
The effect of this was to permit those funds to be expended under the authori-
ties of the CIA Act of 1949, rather than the authorities of the appropriation
acts from which transferred. A transfer under other authority such as the
Economy Act would require that the funds be spent in accordance with
limitations of the appropriation fiom which transferred, both as to purpose
and annuality. Unlike any other agency, our "appropriation act" is the
process described above and consists of the following principal elements:

a. the OMB letter;

b. the chairmen letters;

c. the DOD appropriations act approved by the whole
Congress and signed by the President; and

d. the transfers to the Agency appreved by OMB and
authorized by Section’5 of the CIA Act of 1949.

4, The question then arises whether a return of money from a
previously established proprietary can be placed in the Reserve and
later expended by the Agency under the law. There are several provisions
of law based on Article I, Section 9 of 'the Constitution, which states that "no
money may be drawn from the Treasury, but in consequence of appropriations
made by law," Twenty years after the Constitution was ratified, the act
from which present law derives was enacted. That law is section 628 of
Title 31 of the U. S, Code which states: :

Except as otherwise provided by law, sums appropriated
for the various branches of expenditure im the public service shall
~- be:applied solely to the objects for which they are respectively made,
“sand for! no others.

Re

5, Illustrative of the uniformly strict interpretation given to 31U.S.C.
628 is a decision rendered by the Comptroller General to the Secretary of
the Treasury and. reported at 37 Comp. Gen. 732 (1958). In this case
Congress had authorized an appropriation for payment of inequitable losses”
in-pay sustained by military officers under emergency economy legislation,
but did not thereafter include funds for this purpose when it enacted appro-
priations for the Treasury. The Commandant of the Coast Guard had advised
a subcommittee of the House Committee on Appropriations during appropriation
hearings that, unless the Committee had an objection, it was intended to pay

such claims for losses in pay from the Coast Guard appropriation for "Operating

Expenses." Thereafter, the General Accounting Office Claims Division deter-
mined that over $30,000 in such claims were allowable, but the Comptroller
General was forced to conclude that no claims could be certified for payment
because there was no available appropriation earmarked for their payment.
Citing 31 U.S.C. 628 and. stating the rule that "the appropriations provided
by Congress to the Federal agencies may be used only for the objects for

* which they are made and no others," the Comptroller General decided that
. the statement made by the Commandant before the House subcommittee did not

have the effect of making funds appropriated as "Operating Expenses" available
for payment of the special claims. ‘The Comptroller General held that the
appropriate recourse was to submit a request for appropriation to the Congress.

6. In 1849 the Congress sought to buttress the appropriation principle
set forth in the Constitution by passing a law from which is derived 31 U.S.C.
484, which provides in part:

The gross amount of all moneys received from whatever
source for. the use of the United States,... shall be paid by the’
officer or agent receiving the same into the Treasury, at as
early a day as practicable,'without any abatement or deduction
on account of salary, fees, costs, charges, expenses, or claim
of any description whatever.

Also, Section 487 of 31 U.S.C. (originally passed in 1877) provides specifically

~ that all proceeds of sales of public property of any kind, (with certain excep-

tions not relevant here) shall be deposited and covered into the Treasury as

" Miscellaneous Receipts and shall not be withdrawn or applied, except in

consequence of a subsequent appropriation.

7. Where the Agency makes funds available to establish a proprietary
or to add additional investments, the funds are recorded on Agency books
as having been expended and the Director certifies to the expenditure

ye FROM

JUN 30 165 3

under.section 8(b) of the CIA Act of 1949. I am informed that when an
expenditure of this type is recorded on Agency books; nevertheless, a
memorandum account is maintained so that.the Agency has a record of the
precise amount of Government funds invested in the proprietary. I am.also :
informed that, if a proprietary were to be fully liquidated with the proceeds
scheduled to go.to the Reserve, but the funds returned are in excess of the
investment, the excess would not be placed in the Reserve, but would be
credited to Miscellaneous Receipts. Where funds are returned to the Agency
from a proprietary, the current procedure is for the Agency to "reverse"
the original expenditure entry and, for those funds which are to go into the
Reserve, the Reserve account on the Agency books is credited, with notifi-
cation to OMB.

8. Let us take a hypothetical situation where 20 years ago the Agency
expended $1 million to establish a proprietary. At that time the $l million
would have been recorded as expended, certified under the Director's
authority for purposes contemplated by the appropriation of 20 years ago.
In the meantime, that’$1 million would have been spent by the proprietary i
for salaries, purchase of equipment, or for other purposes. The Agency |
either supplemented its original expenditure with additional monies or the
proprietary might have made a profit during these years. This pr oprietary, .
at Agency direction, now liquidates its activities, including the selling of
assets. Under the Constitution and the laws cited above, it is my opinion
that the law requires all such return of funds to the Agency to be covered
into the Treasury as Miscellaneous Receipts.

9. The Agency may not legally expend these funds once again without
the approval of the Congress, and by that I mean the full appropriations
process and not merely the approval of OMB and notification to our two
appropriations committees. The essential element missing in this latter
procedure is that there has not been an appropriation bill approved by the
Congress as a whole and signed by the President. In effect, the Agency
would have had its appropriation supplemented without the full appropriation

NOTES ON THE SCHEDULES OF GAIN OR LOSS
ON THE SALE OF MHMUTUAL INVESTMENTS

° Note #1

The MHMUTUAL portfolio, from which the attached schedules of gain or loss

, on the sale of investments were taken, is not an accounting document in the
sense that it is used to account for funds handled by the Activity. The purpose
of the portfolio is to provide,management with a picture of the investments held
by the complex at any point in time. The portfolio is not audited per se, and in
past years no attempt was made to insure that each presentation tied directly
back to the previous portfolio; that has been done in recent years. Due to the .
lack of audit, certain errors were not discovered, and they were carried forward
to the present. One example is on the 1970 presentation of the sales of stocks
to date. The total sale price of $2,226,883.29 when subtracted from the total
purchase price of $2,246,793.93 results in a loss of $19,910.64 instead of the
Toss of $27,802.99 as shown under the column marked gain or (loss) on sales.
The total gain.on sales to date should therefore be $177,437.51. For some un-
known reason, the balance carried forward to the 1971 schedule of gain on the
sale of equity is stated as $206,314.47 which involves an overstatement in the
cumulative gain on the sale of equity in the amount of $28,876.96. This error
has been carried forward to the present.

Note #2

The portfolio figures cannot be directly tied in with the financial state~
ments for MHMUTYAL in the case of bonds since the statements reflect an average
cost for all the bonds of a particular issuer, and the appreciation on a dis-
counted bond is recorded as income each year with a commensurate increase in the
book value of the bond.
Note #3

The only bond transaction during 1970 was the sale of $50,000 of U.S.

Treasury bonds. [his transaction is found on the schedule titled "Debenture
Investments."

CIA Domestic Real Property Holdings*

CIA has a variety of real property holdings in the United
States ranging from the major, overt Headquarters complex in McLean,
Virginia, to small leased 'safehouse" apartments in many cities.
Real property holdings also include seven CIA-controlled installations
used as training sites, supply depots, research and development
centers, and communications transmitting and receiving facilities.
The 237 domestic real property holdings are summarized for.this
report as. follows:

a. overt or nominal properties (overt properties are
identified as CIA; nominal properties as Executive
Office of the President, but CIA control is admitted

upon request) of which there are sixty-two (62);

b. Official cover properties (identified as under the
control of other U.S. Government agencies and CIA rela-
tionship is classified from CONFIDENTIAL through TOP
SECRET) of which there are fifty-three (53);

ce. Safehouses (properties, generally apartments or resi-
dences and generally leased, acquired for covert meetings)

of which there are eighty-one (81); and

* The information contained in this section has extreme sensitivity
as a grouped data package. It lists the entirety of CIA real property
holdings and personnel assets in the United States as of 13 January
1975; accordingly, release, unauthorized disclosure, or loss of this
information would have severe operational impact on the activities

of CIA. :

HW 50955 DocId:32423532 Page 245


d. Non-official properties (identified as private firms

which may be wholly oe partially controlled by CIA and

housing CIA employees) of which there are forty-one (41).

Attachment 1 lists CIA domestic real property and provides

specific addresses for all overt and nominal CIA real property
holdings. Official cover properties, safehouses, and non-official
properties are listed by general location. Numbers of personnel
and utilization purpose are shown for each category of real property.
This report is developed as a real property summary; therefore,
personnel data supplied are predominantly based on CIA space utili-
zation reports, and slight variation may exist in some instances.
A limited number of CIA personnel are located in non-CIA-controlled
space -- for example, in the Pentagon, in private residences, or in
commercial companies -- and these properties are not listed in this
real property summary. Non-official properties not occupied by CIA
staff or contract employees are not listed. Attachment 2 is a sum-

mary sheet of all the previous figures.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director for Science and Technology
Deputy Director for Intelligence
Deputy Director. for Management and Services
Deputy Director for Operations

INFO 3: Inspector General
SUBJECT

Questionable Activities

1.° As an aspect of the allegations of improper CIA activity
in connection with the Watergate end associated matters, the
Inspector General was directed’ to assemble all information avail-
able in the Agency on any Such| activities. Certain specific matters
were provided to him, and the Director by memorandum of 9 May 1973
directed all employees to report any activities, current or past,
“which might be construed to be outside the legislative charter of }
this Agency." This information was assembled and consolidated by
the Inspector General in a-memorandum of 21 May 1973 and certain
individual memoranda thereafter supplementing it. This material
was used in a detailed, page-by-page review of all such information
with Senator Symington and Congressman Nedzi, as Chairmen of the
Senate and the House Armed Services Intelligence Subcozmittees,

respectively, In addition, I undertook very specific commitments : ee
in my confirmation hearings to ensure that the Agency will remain U
within its legislative charter.’ I am arrenging for the published Ee ae

transcripts of those hearings to be circulated throughout the
Agency for compliance, and at that time will reaffirm the specific
direction made by_Dr. Schlesinger in his memorandum of 9 May 1973.
This will also be incorporated sinto appropriate regulations.

2... With respect to the specific questionable activities which
were reported as a result of the search made throughout the Agency,
however, I believe it essential to take specific action in order
that these not seem to be condoned or overlooked. I have therefore
developed specific instructions on each reported activity. These
are included in the attachments to this memorandum, and have the
force of specific direction to you to pass on to appropriate
Subordinates the instructions outlined. Separate packages of such
instructions are being developed for each -Directorate in order to
respect the sensitivity of some of the activities discussed, includ- rROM

ra

‘ing those which are deemed quite appropriate within CIA's charter. ’

difficulties of implementation or compliance,

Similarly, each activity is placed on a separate page so that the .
Deputy Director concerned may most easily forward it to the office
or offices directly concerned without distributing it more broadly.

raise substantial
I would appreciate

your raising such cases with me directly, with whatever recommenda-
tions you-may have for modification to carry out the spirit of the
action undertaken here but to avoid undue disruption of legitimate”

activities. In the absence of such notice, I

will expect full

compliance with the instructions outlined herein.

4, Each: addressee Deputy. Director is instructed to recommend
to the DDM&S modification or addition to Agency regulations of

appropriate language to reflect the. direction
memorandum and attachments addressed to him:

included in this
DDM&S will be

responsible for consolidating such recommendations and making an

overall report to the Director through the IG
General Counsel.
