MONTESINO and other persons, in order that the interview

with the subject could be more thorough and detailed. The

subject is an unscrupulous and immoral individual, who

undoubtedly would lie if it benefited him. For this reason,

it is believed Polygraph examination of the subject would

be revealing and worthwhile, and for this reason, the Bureau

will be requested for authorization to Polygraph subject

after FAJARDO is located and interviewed.

RAMIRO SANCHEZ MONTESINO, shortly after SANCHEZ' .

incarceration in Cuba in December, 1962, said he encountered
