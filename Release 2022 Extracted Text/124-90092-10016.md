RLOW first said he was unable to recall visiting t
Berlin in 1953 but later said he recalled seeing WILLIAM K, HARVEY, |
Chief of Station, (December, 1952, to August, 1959) on more than
one occasion so he supposes he did make such visits. When |
informed that it was understood that KARLOW had been to Berlin
ten to fifteen times in the period 1950 - 1953, ‘KARLOW offered

no objection and said it was possible that this was true. With
reference to his later assignment in Munich from November, 1953,

: to the end of 1955, KARLOW stated he wgs fairly certain he had
