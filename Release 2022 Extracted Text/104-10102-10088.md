4. Beforts to debrief A-7 on
sonewhat futile in this initial meeting in view of his unsettled emotion
His primary concera appeared to be his wite his ‘ether str:
ship with his in-laws, who were now residing in emi. In this con-
nection, it should be pointed out that this enctional state appeared to sten,
in part, from his inherent suspicions that his wife (21 years of age end rel-
atively attractive) vas being unfaithful to him. All indications are, however,
thet A-7 has no real basis for these suspicions; other than those conjured up
in his om mind. In any case, he requested if it might not be possible to wire-
tap his wife's house in Miemi, so thet he could Have daily reports on her activi-
ties. while no promises were made, A-7 wes assured we would attempt to look
into this possibility, once we had more definite information tHet there ver
some grounds for his suspicions. (Note: Subsequent discussions vith Security
office revealed that a wire-tap of A~7's house was a major project in itselr
end impossible to accomplish at this time without tieing up considerable
personel.) A-7 was later told this after we assured him that his suspicions
were groundless wheré nis wife. was concerned.

5. Following this initial meeting with 4-7, it vas apparent to both
ctr. Pekich and the undersigned that tine vould be needed to restore agent's
confidence in our capability to support his efforts in any future projected
assignment in the field. Moreover, A-7's emotionel state, which appears to
stem from his problems with his in-laws and his concern about leaving his wife
alone, must be fully resolved before attempting to dispatch him again.

6. Im later debriefing session held trom 8 to 15 November with A-7,
considerable more light was throw on the nature and seove of his operational
activities in Cuba, As previously indicated in paregraph 1 of this report,

T while Operating in Cub:

Some of the more significant problens. encountered by A-T
during the course of his operations in Havena ere as follows:

(1) See Ih this connection, A-7 stated that despite

the disguise given him, he had to be constantly on the alert
from the danger of being picked up by G-2 or Castro police
during the course of his numerous operational contacts. He
sited several examples vhere he believed he vas under sur-
veillance by the opposition end subsequently succeeded in aliud-
ing this surveillence. He complained that his disguise, (hair-

. Piece and mstache) rapidly deteriorated in the Havana climate
end as a consequence he was forced to abendon this disguise tower
the latter part of his stay in Havena. Similarly, be was forced
to change his quarters continually, by noving from one safehouse
to enother as a security precaution, since he felt that it vas
generally known in Cuban circles that he was operating in the
Hevana ares, end that he was vrobably already under the sur=
veillance of Castro security forces.

(2) Heterdel Support: In the course of these debriefing
sessions, one oF A-7's chief complaints was thet despite nis
urgent messages sent through his cut-out (AMIRE“Z) to the S
thet arms and other military equipment werd sorely needed by!

his groups in Bavans end Piner del Rio, no ection was taken to
implement his requests. As a result, A-7 felt he vas losing fuce
with his follovers and this wes one of the primary factors for
returning to the States to discuss this aspect with Headcuarters.

(3) Teed for Direct Commmication: A-7 stated that without the
services of a rater vho could be in direct commmication
with us, he is fully convinced thet any subsequent r:
iin an operational capacity would be ineffectual. 7
would be one of the conditions laid on v
a W/@ operator would be assigned to hin person

8. Case Officer Comment: Despite A-7's tendencies to operate on
@ grandiose scele, bis disapoointment in the leck of support received on >:
initial mis: mn to Cuba; and his display of emotional instability at tin:
it is believed that his efforts can be properly channeled to work effectively
for us in Cuba. His motivation appears to stem from his personal ambitions
to make his mark on this counter-revolution against Castro, where he can |
assure himself of a priminent position in the future government to be formed
in Cuba after the overthrow of the Castro regime. A-7 has imagination and
the will to succeed. His weakness is his inability to hide his personal
embitions from others vho may work with him and who may have altogether dif-
ferent motivations end sense of values. Hence, it is believed thet A-7
will encounter problems in handling pedle recruited or essigned to hin ia
the course of his activities inside the’ country. AMPUG can be sited as
@ good exemple, where a clash of personalities hes avperently clready taken
plece. In view of this, A-7 will have to be dealt with firmly ond mst be
convinced that the success or failure of his projected mission will &
on his ability to develop confidence and loyalty among his followers once h+
is inside the covntry ogain. Similarly, A-7 mst resolve his personal problem
dealing with Lis wife end in-laws, which has hed an adverse effect on him
personally since his return, and may affect his operations inside Cube. The
next several weeks will, therefore, need be devoted to re-establish A-7's
confidence in our ability to suvport his efforts in Cuba, once he is sent
pack, ond vorking out his family problems to obviate any adverse psyczolo-
gical effect which may be detrizental to nis operations im Cuba.
