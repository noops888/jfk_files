SUBJECT: HCSA Request for NSA Material on Kennedy Assassination

1. Based on our discussion with Judy Miller, my understanding was that

Mr. Blakey's most recent request for data from NSA involved a review of

post-assassination diplomatic product on a world-wide basis to determine

if reports relevant to the assassination exist. Though Ms. Miller did

not specify a time period, a three month period subsequent to the event

would involve - as an example - six to nine thousand reports and would

require 120 to 150 hours of analyst time just to conduct a manual search

of the microfilm files where these records reside.

â€¢2. I subsequently spoke with Mr. Roger Denk, DIA, who had actually

participated in the briefing of Mr. Blakey, using our SECRET-level statement

as a basis. Mr. Denk advises that DIA has destroyed all its files which

might relate to the assassination and that, therefore, he had had nothing

to offer Blakey except the NSA-prepared sanitized statement. Mr. Denk also

provided a different, much more ambitious new requirement from Blakey than

that reported by Judy Miller.

3. According to Denk, what Blakey really wants from NSA is for us to

conduct a thorough review of all Cuban communications during the six year

period from January 1959. to December 1964, in order to see "what the Cubans

were talking about/thinking about" of possible relevance to the assassina-

tion - a real fishing expedition in my view.

Blakey is also reported to

desire a "characterization of the traffic" - and not the traffic itself.

4. This latest version of Blakey's interests, which has probably

been stated to us fairly accurately by Denk, represents a very significant

work load indeed: Based on some very educated estimates made by the

people in T12 who maintain the historical microfilm files, there were

approximately 200,000 Cuban reports or translations issued during the six

year period of interest, and roughly 2,000 man-hours of effort would be

required to search these records for items of interest.

5.

As we have discussed previously, I believe that NSA - in a number

of separate, thorough analytic efforts - has performed reasonable and

detailed reviews of all available signals intelligence.

reviews has resulted in the derivation of any data of direct significance

to the assassination. A summary of these separate NSA efforts is attached.
