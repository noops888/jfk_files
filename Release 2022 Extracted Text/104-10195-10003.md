The first thing of. note is the scattered work anu, educational history of thie

fellow. On paper the cane is all against him but in telking to-him I conclude that
*{t de the case of a guy who failed to get the: proper -job anil school guidance when 4
woula huve been moat effective (immediately after discharge }. The guy hae intelli.
gence (iA/5 1-41) but peraeps not the finsl grasp cf things to mxe a go of a
“{echnical degree in College. He probably woula have done Q.k, with the Liveral Art!
course. At any rate he nas decided on ucoounting as a career (finds he lixwit
ana can éo it well), He's hed a touch léfe to say the leaut (how such bearing this
has hed on kis career I's not trained to eveluete.)-Iy final inpreesion is that he!
neat, ciean cut, eincere, reliable, cepeble #f given the proper supervision, Typea
about 40 xpm and 48 learning ehorthans froz hie wife (who's applying as steno). I
think he'd do a cospetent job ama perimps with experience and training éo a very
goud one. Wants O/S at earlicet opportu..ity for financzal reasons.

nornally Fequired considerable amount of overtime work to meet
these deadlinés, He had mary ideas which he presented to Chief,
Finance Branch for betterment of the payrolling ‘system, but un-
fortunately after due consideration the majority of these ideas
were found to be impractical and/or in violation of either good
accepted commercial practice or Agency regulations, Suggestions
made to-him were outwardly accepted but upon follow-up it was
determined that he had failed to implement these suggestions.
