Assassination Records

REFERENCE: (AIUO) Bulletin OIM EB No. 02-98,
dated 22 July 1998

1. (U) The JFK Board has made a number of recent
specific directed requests to assure that the Agency has
complied fully with the requirements of the JFK Act. Among
these was a request for issuance of the Reference Employee
Bulletin, in which the DCI directed that employees leave “no
stone unturned” in assuring that relevant documents are
provided to the Commission.

2. (U) In part because relevant new documents have
aurfaced within the past few months, the Board has also
requested specific focus on renewed searches of the Agency's
“counterintelligence files.“ The new documents have
surfaced due to a variety of reasons, including references
to assassination related personalities in recent defector
reports, records made available because of the break up of
the Soviet Union, and advances in search capabilities due to
digitization of older paper files.
