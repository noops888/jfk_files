mildly successful.

2. Polftica, 1 Mey 19¢6, earrted an article attacking the proposed Con-

contains, among other things, a partial reprint of the text of an interview

Toe Station believes tnat most or all articles.attacking the Conference,
ecd particularly those m.tacking LICOOKY<1, were Sovict inspired, and ic is further
believed that SEMO wrote most if not all erticles attacking the Conference which
eppeared in_La Voz, Polf:ica and Bcesos. The Soviets, who are protebly aware of
previous Cuban cbargea tlat LICQOKY-1 ts an ODYOXE acent, probably felostha: es

Bolivia. :

d.. The affiliation commission will form the initial
body of writers of che Community within a six-month
period. Thereafter, acceptance of new members will
be suspended for six months, but will then be renewed
in order to facilitate the work of organizing the
Second Congress of the Latin American Cultural
Community.

Carlos Pellicer and Juan Rulfo are respectively the president
and vice-president of the Asociacion de Escritores Mexicanos,
A.C. (Association of Mexicin Writers = AEMAC), see MEXI-6177
of 5 February 1966, an organization dedicated ostensibly to
bettering tne welfare ot writers through increased fringe
benefits as well as better publication and distribution of
their works. Its constitution specifically forbade its in-
volvement in political affairs or entanglement with inter-
national organizations. Mario Monteforte is a member of

this organization. During recent months, under. the aegis

of Pellicer and Rulfo, efforts have been underway to revise
this constitution in such a way as tc repeal these provisions
without at the same time alienating those of the members who
are opposed to dropping these provisions. Pellicer, it will
be remembered, attended the COMES meeting in Genoa last year,
at which the formation of the CLE was discussed.

Despite the vagueness of the wording of articles 3, 4 and
5 (see numbering in attached news clipping) there is no
disputing their political.nature. Monteforte alleged to
LICOOKY that he did not feel the wording of these three
articles is beyond the bounds of reason for a “non-political”
organization. LICOOKY concedes that their wording is subject
to the broadest interpretation if Yonteforte should ever lose
the "conductor's baton." Both are guilty of disingenuousness
or at best naivete, since these articles seem to us to be not
only a license, but almost a-battle cry for political militancy
from community members. . :

During his trip, Monteforte claims to have met the Chilean
President and the Foreign Minister. The former, with whom
Monteforte discussed the idea of the comunidades, agreed to
write to President Gustavo Diaz Ordaz ef Nexico stressing to
him the importance of support for the comunidades. The impli-
cation is that Mexico's financial and moral support for the
next Cultural Congress will be sought in this way,

a deliberate omission in the nature of entrapment, or whether
it was felt articles such as the atiached had adequately covered
the ground, is not known.

6. Owing to LICOOKY-1's planned departure from the area
the end of June 1966, it is not likely Station will have the
same insight into the progress of the CLE.

Reference: HUMA-27358, 7 October 1965

1. ‘Station regrets the delay in keeping Headquarters informed
of the prosress of our association with LICOOKY-1, When the
proposed amendment to the LIREAM Project involving LICOOKY was
turned down, we informed ker on her return to Mexico that we could
no’ longer justify the continued association at the present rate
since we were simply not yetting enough out of it, but that if ‘|
she could r2gularize her status here and obtain working papers, we
would be more than happy to conclude a new arrangement with her.
She felt there was little chance of this, and we then told her we
would conclude our arrangement with her sometime in the summer, As
indicated in paragraph 2 of the attachment, the date has now been
established as 30 June, at which time all outstanding financial
arrangements with ber will be terminated and she will be given her
air fare to New York.

2. Unfortunately, LICCOKY-1 seems to be incapable of realizing
which Side her bread is burtered on, at least here in Mexico. She
cannot parcel her time ont to her various izterests, and theretore
finds all her time taken up by her unprid AEMAC duties. The profiles
we have been harping on have not materialized except for the one
submitted under H"!A-28831, We still hope for one on Francisco
VILLAGRAN Kramer and such of the Mexican literary figures as amount
in her judgment to “non-pignies.” We are not sanyuine. We are
still after a copy of Osegueda's paper on university reform.

A before departure and finish in a blaze of activity. If she
does this, we will write off the advance here. If she does
not, $195 of the advance will be counted as her February
a salary, $48 as travel expenses from New York to Washington
and the remainder will be written off. : :

4. Rather than go through the formality of a project
amendment as per HMMW-14517, Station would prefer merely to
consider the project as terminated as of 31 December 1966 and
pick up subsequent costs in LIRANCH. A formal project ter-
mination ‘will be submitted in the near future.

LICOOKY Project Progress Report
1 October 1965 - 30 April 1966 :

Production

LICOOKY-1 has continued to devote the bulk of her”
time to the Mexican Writers’ Association (AEM). She
continues to handle most of ite administrative york.
She also organizes and does most of the work on the
majority of the projects or activities which the

AEM sponsors.

L-1 continued to report on efforts to establish the
Latin American Writers’ Community (CLE), including

the results of the Organizing Congress in Arica, Chile.
She reported on’ the steps taken by Mario Monteforte
Toledo in beginning preparations for an early 1967
Congress in Mexico and on the AEM's probable role in
helping organize that Congress.

L-1 supplied information on reactions among the Cen-
tral American community in Mexico to the Guatemalan
election campaign and results.

She maintained contact with and reported on individuale

of interest to the Station, including Monteforte Toledo,

Carlos Pellicer Camara, Manuel Germfn Parra, Francisco

Villagran Kramer, and Rat] Osegueda Pelala.

Sey



LICOOKY-2 continued to report travel of Communists

e.
or leftists from Central America to Eastern Europe.
During this period he reported on eight such travelers.
2, Operations : : 73

a. L-1 has been notified that she will be terminated

effective 30 June. She has been given the following

requirements to be fulfilled before that date.

Provide profiles on the personality and politics of
significant Mexican and Central American intellectuals

with whom she is acquaintec.

Obtain information on the newly-formed Latin American
Writers’ Community, its probable political development,
and progress toward the holding of its scheduled meet-

ing in Mexico City in January 1967. _

Obtain a copy of the analysis written by RaGl Osegueda

Pelala of the problems of authonomous universities.

Special tasks such as reporting on the activity of

Stasia Madrigal acd on the UNAM student strike,

In order to accomplish the above tasks in the short

time remaining, L-1 will be forced to curtail her ac-

tivities at the AZM. There are enough jobs that
need ‘doing at AEM to occupy her full-time and there-
fore the immediate partial withdrawal from ABM work

ig a prerequisite to the accomplishment of th
assignments.

Because L-1 has played euch a key role in a11 AEM
activities, and therefore in determining the direc-
tion and scope of these activities, her sudden with
drawal could result in important changes within AEM,
Any major change in direction by AEM would probably
become predictable once the identity of the person

or persons who will move in to fill the vacancy left
by L-1 become known, By having L-] step aside now,
rather than waiting until she is ready to leave Wexico,
he may then be able to provide Station wich an ac-
curate account of any change resulting from her with-
drawal,

L-2 has not been met regularly since 25 January. On
that dateshe was given a mailing address which she uses
to request a meeting only if he has information to
report. L-2 is paid on a piece-rate basis for infor~

mation supplied and does not receive a regular salary.

b. It is possible that L-2 will, in the very near future,
lose access to the travel information which he has
been reporting, i zause he is being given new responai-
bilities in the office where he works, L-2 is intelli-
gent, conscientious, and well-motivated, If he does
lose his present access, the Station will consider hin

LICOOKY-1 attended an AEM Board +f Directors Meet-
ing on 25 August 1965 called by Pellicer. At this
meeting Peliicer explained how he had been elected

President of the CLE for Latin America and detaiied

“his pians for hosting the CLE Conference in Mexico

City in early 1966,

LICOOKY-1 hed tipped off some of her rightist, friends
on the AEM Beard of Directors who immediately pro-
tested. . Instead of anything being arranged a com-
mittee of two was appointed to investigate and re-
port back to the Board of Directors at a meeting to
be held during the middle of October. This committee
is composed of pees Segura Millao and tiene) Martinez
Sotomayor, friends of LICOOKY-1 who have assured
LICOOKY-1 they will return a negative report opposing
Pellicer's plan to use the AEM as host for the 1963

meeting of the CLE in Mexico.

Pellicer had asked the Ministry of Education to fi-
nance this 1$66 meeting in the name of the AEM prior
to the 25 August 1965 meeting of the AEM's Board of

Directers, If in the October meeting the Board of

Directors refuses to host the meeting it will put
Pellicer in an embarrassing position vis a vis the

Ministry of Education.

LICOOKY-1 assured her CO she would return in plenty
of time to attend the October Board Meeting and to
arrange support for Segura and Martinez at this —

meeting.

During the regorting peries LICOOKY-2 has maintaincd

contact with Mario Monteforte Toledo, Francisco
Villagran Kramer, Margarita Paz Paredes, Juan Rulfo,
Miguel Guarda Rios, Leopoldo Zea, Luis Villero,
Alejandro Finisterre, Beojamin Carrién, Rail Qsegueda
Pelala, Bartolomé Costa~Amic and Avtonio vontes de

Oca.

LICOOKY-2 continues to report on travel of Communists
or leftists from Central America to the Communist
bloc, During the period covered by this report he

has reported on 34 such travelers.

Security

The CO at this time can only speculate cn LICOOKY-1's

reason for contacting Igor Gordevitch of Visiér mag-



azine. LICOOKY-1 had been told prior to her de-

parture that the CO gid not know if Headquarters
would want to contact her in Kew York. If she
wasn't contacted it yould mean that Headquarters:

had no desire or need for seeing her. An explanation

will.be asked for when she returns.

bb, LICOOKY-2 has not presented any security problems.

1. LICOOKY-1's efforts as described in reference have

substantial merit and some potential particularly if the Station can
find a way to tie them in with the LIREAN effort in the intcllectual

field.

3, LICOOKY-\ certainly is to be commended for her effort in
getting writers botn of the right and left such as Carlos PELLICER
Camara to join the AEM, From a KUBARK standpoint the most intcresting
contact is the one with PELLICER because he has been the reported force

behind the COMES/CLE effort in Mexico.

the LILINK memo do not entail making her witting of other Station i

to her OA is requirec, and cne has been requested. If her efforts i
progress to the point where she might be able to influence leftist i
friters in their efforts to establish the CLE in Siexico (para 7 ¢ of |

LICOOKY=1 should be used as an active MHSPAWN agent, and another

1. Production Oya ds

. Beginning in early April, LICOOKY-1 was instructed to devote as much
time as necessary to her work in the Mexican Writers Association (AEM =
Asociacién de Escritores de Mexico). LICOUKY-1 has been almost totally
responsible for the AEM's development and present organization and is
Board of Directors, shich enables her to attend all
nt was the result of KUBARK's interest in

@ member of its

Yoard meztings. This assign
the activities of thy European Community of Writers (COMES - Comunite
Suropea degli Serittorf{) and its efforts to estaolish a Latin American

branch.
t. An operational dispatch covering LICUGKY-1's activities in the AEN
in detaii was prepared and forwarded, Two HMMs were prepared covering
the organization of the ASE and Juan Rulfo's planning in conjunction
with Carlos Pellicer Cfmara (not to be confused with Carlos Menuel
Pellecer), Migual Angel Asturias, Arnoldo Orfila Reysai, and Benjamin
Carri6 for the Congress of the Community of Latin American Writers
(CLE - Comunidad Vatinoacericana de Escvitores) to be held in Mexico
. J City in 1966.

h. The Station KUCAGE officers are now considering a plan suggested
by LICOOKY-1 which would help sabotage any effort to take the AEM into
the CLE. :

is LICCOKY-2 centinues to report on the travel of Communists or leftists
from Central America to the Communist bloc. During the peridd covered by

thie repert, he reported on 11 individuals, ali of whom traveled to the

Soviet Union or Scstera Burope.
2. Operations

a. LICOOKY-1 will continue to cover the activities of those planning
for the CLS Congress, the developments within the ADM, and ill maintain
her contacts ith Central American Communists and exiles in Mexico City.
This latter task has net been as successful as was originally planned
because her access has been limited for the reasons outlined in Para-
graph 5 of Reference A.
b, LI{COOKY-1 has been given the following requirements in regard to
the Ai

(1) To prepare complete assessments on all the influential AcM leaders.

forming an affiliate in Mexico, preparatory to the CLE Congress.

(4) To continue developing a close friendship with Rulfo and Pellicer.

(5) To continue her activities in the AZM in a manner to enhance her

stature and increase the leaders' confidence in her as one who

gets things do

1. The first steps to organize the Mexican Writers’ Associs-
tion (AEM - Asociacién de Eseritores de México) were taket :
in February of 1964 after Bartolome Costa~Amic and the Zaplana -
Bookstores published a proposal in the metropolitan newspapers; i
offering to establish a new series of library prizes and urging

the Mexican writers to join an association that could provide

material benefits for its members. The first meeting of the

AEM was held on 11 August 1964, For some time the AEM remained

as insignificant as other similar organizations which had been
organized from time to time, such as the Society of Literary Au-

thors and The Society of Friends of Mexican Books which never

achieved any effectiveness or respectability. Mexico's established

and well known writers have always shunned these organizations.

2.  LICOOKY-1 became interested in the AEM through her friendship
with Costz-Amic and saw the possibility of building the AEM into
an organization which would include the middic of the road and
right wing authors who had been systematically boycotted since
the L&zaro CArdenas' regime when Narciso Bassols, a member of the

Communist Party, was Minister of Education.

3, LICOOKY-1 began a one man campaign of recruiting relatively
well known right wing writers who could not be considered mediocre
or nonentities, As LICOOKY-1's campaign began to succeed it be-

came easter to recruit the nore important writers of Mexico cover~

ing the whole political spectrum. In Octover of 1964, LICOOKY-1

SECRET
(Ah ~-2ECZ/ og coat

- persuaded Carlos Pellicer Cimara, well kaown Wexican poet, to

Sier to get other well known

join the AEM. It then became
‘writers to join. In a}l LICOOKY-1 recruited about 80 of the well
known Mexican writers to come into the AEM, At this time LICOOKY-
1 knew nothing of the €uropean Community of Writers (COMES -
Comunité Europea degli Scrittori) or. plans to form a Coamunity

of Latin American Writers (CLE - Comunidad Latinoamericana de

Escritores).

4.  LICOCKY-1 has been appointed to the Board of Directors of
the AEM which permits LICOOKY-1 to attend all Board Meetings and
she is relied upon to do all details of organization and planning

the AEM projects to assist the Mexican writer which is the ultimate

objective of tne AEM,

5, In this work LICOOKY-1 has developed friendships with the
leaders of the AEM including Pellicer and Juan Rulfo, both of

whom were Mexican delegates to the COMES Conference held in

the winter of i865, tlellicer

Geneva, Switzeriand duri

ome and confers witn her on ALY problers,

vated LICOUKY:i to bis

usually once a week. Sne has free entrance to Qulfo's office at tre

Instituto Indirenista and he nas visited LICCOKY-1's apartment.

6. The Station nopes that through LICOCKY-1 the AEM can be used

through its affiliate CLE to form

te defeat any attempts dy CO?



a Unity of Writers (UE - Unidad de Escritores) in Me:

'o as

well as sabotage the CLE Congress to be held in Mexico in 1360.

7. To this end, one of LICOOKY-1's principal objectives is to

solidify her ucceptance in the AEM and she has been given the "

immediate tauks of:

a.

Preparing complete assessments and personality data on

all of the influential AEM leaders, .

b. Determinins LICOCKY-1's influence on thew as a basis

for;

c.

Using; the AEM, when the time comes, to keep bellicer

and Rulfe from forming the UE affiliate in Mexico, prepara-

tory to the coming CLE Congress.

ACTION REQUIRED: Further assessment data requested per para. 2

REFERENCE : HMMA - 25546, 12 March 1965

1. We were especially pleased to receive the LICOOKY/1
target survey on Subject (of 201-12972) and to learn that the
Station has a controlled asset who enjoys direct, non-profec-
sional, social contact with Subject. As the Station is avare,
Subject's extra-curricular activities have become a matter of
increasing CI concern toa number of Stations jn Latin ‘America.
However, none of them appears to have assets in sufficiently
close contact with Subject to detcrmine what be is actually
doing and for whom We realize, of course, that LICOOKY/1 pro-
bably will not be able to shed any light in this regard, but
we hope that her contact can be exploited to provide the type
of personal operational assessment data on Subject which ve
have largely lacked up to now.

2. Our information on Eubject has so far been conflict~
ing onthe point of ais suspected intelligence affiliation and
about his possible susceptibility to recruitment. Nonetheless,
we regard LICOOKY/1's views regarding Subject as objective and
reasonable. During future contacts, we request that she con-
centrate on discerning Subject's persoual attitudes and weak~
nesses cr exploitable vulnerabilities. Siould Subject bw trans-
ferred laterally to another location in the West, we would like
to try from the very outset of his assignment to undertake the
type of gradual, long-term developmental contact which LICOOKY/1
suggested. To helpusplan for the selection of an uppropriate
asset for this purpose, we believe it would be useful for
LICOORY/I to prepara a personality profile onthe type of indi-
vidual to whom Subject is most likely to respond and who could
hepe te in Subject's frtendship and confidence with the
least d iculty or disadvantage.
