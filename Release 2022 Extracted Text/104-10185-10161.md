Carlos Pellicer and Juan Rulfo are respectively the president

and vice-president of the Asociacion de Escritores Mexicanos,

(Association of lexicin Writers = AEMAC), see MEXI-6177

of 5 February 1966, an organization dedicated ostensibly to

bettering the welfare of writers through increased fringe

benefits as well as better publication and distribution of

their works.

Its constitution specifically forbade its in-

volvement in political affairs or entanglement with inter-

national organizations.

Mario Monteforte is a member of

this organization.

During recent months, under. the aegis

of Pellicer and Rulfo,

efforts have been underway to revise

this constitution in such a way as to repeal these provisions

without at the same time alienating those of the members who

are opposed to dropping these provisions.

Monteforte alleged to

LICOOKY that he did hot feel the wording of these three

articles is beyond the bounds of reason for a "non-political"

organization.

LICOOKY concedes that their wording is subject

to the broadest interpretation

if Monteforte should ever lose

"conductor's baton."

Both are guilty of disingenuousness

or at kest naivete, since these articles seem to us to be not

only a license, but

almost a battle cry for political militancy

from communily menbers..

During his trip, Monteforte claims to have met the Chilean

President and the Foreign

The former, with whom

Monteforte discussed the idea of the comunidades, agreed to

write to President Gustavo Diaz Ordaz of Mexico stressing to

him the imporlance of support for the comunidades.

The impli-

cation is that Mexico's financial and móral support for the

next Cultural Congress will be sought in this way!

LICOOKY Project

Progress Report

1 October 1965 - 30 April 1966

1.

Production

a. LICOOKY-I has continued to devote the bulk of her

tine to the Mexican Writers' Association (ASM). She

continues to handle most of its administrative work.

She also organizes and does most of the work on the

majority of the projects or activities which the

AEM sponsors.

b. L-l continued to report on efforts to establish the

Latin American Mriters' Conunity (CLS), Including

the results of the Organizing Congress in Arica, Chile.

She reported on the steps taken by Mario Monteforte

Toledo in beginning preparations for an early 1967

Congress in Mexico and on tha AEM's probable role in

helping organize that Congress.

c." I-l supplied information on reactions anong the Cen-

tral American conmunity in Mexico to the Guatenalan

election campaign and results.

d. She maintained contact ulth and reported on individuals

of interest to the Station, including Monteforte Toledo,

Carlos Pellicer Canars, Manuel Gerado Parra, Francisco

Villagran Kramer, and Raúl Osegueda Pelala.

LICOOKY-2 continued to report travel of Communists

or leftists Iron Central America to Eastern Europe.

During this period he reported

on eight such travelers.

2. Operations

a. I-l has been notified that she will be terminated

eifective 30 June. She has been given the following

requirements to be fulfilled before that date.

Provide profiles on the personality and politica of

significant Mexican and Central American intellectuals

with whom she is acquainted.

Obtain information on the newly-formed Latin American

Writers' Community, its probable political development,

and progress toward the holding of its scheduled neet-

1ng 1n Mexico City in January 1967. .

Obtain a copy of the analysis written by Raûl segueda

Pelala of the problems of authononous universities.

Special tasks such as reporting on the activity of

Stasia Madrigal and on the UNAil student strike.

b.

In order to accomplish the above tasks in the short

time remaining, L-l vill be forced to curtail her ac-

tivities at the All. There are enough jobs that

need doing at All to occupy her full-time and there-

fore the Immediate partial withdrawal fron AEM work

1s a prerequisite to the accomplishnent of these

assignsents.

C. Because L-l has played such a key role in all AEM

activitles, and therefore in determiuing the direc

tion and scope of these

actlvities, her sudden with-

drawal could result in important changes within AEM.

Any major change in direction by AEl would probably

become predictable once the identity of the person

or persons who will nove in to fill the vacancy left

by L-l become known. By hawing L-l step aside now,

rather than waiting until she is ready to leave Mexico,

she may then be able to provide Station wich an ac-

curate account of any change resulting fron her with-

drawal.

Reference:

HHNA 26,621, 15 July 1965

1. LICOOKY-l's efforts as described in reference have

substantial merit and some potential particularly

if the Station can

find a way to tie them in with the LIREAM effort in the intellectual

field.

LICOOKY-l certainly is to be comnended for her effort in

getting writers both of the right and left such as Carlos PELICER

Camara to join the Arb.

From a KUBARK standpoint the most intcresting

contact is the one with PELLICER because be has been the reported force

behind the COMES/CLE cffort in lexico.

Although her assigned tasks as reported in para

A the LILINk men do not entail making ber witting ui other station

assets engaged in

MISPAWN Ops anong the intellectuals, an amendment

• to her OA

is required,

and one has been requested.

If her eftorts

progress to the point

where she might be able to influence leftist

writers

in their efforts to establish the CLE in Mexico (para 7 c or

LILINK memo) Headquarters should be forwarded your

ideas on why and how

LICOOKY-1 should be used as an active SPAWN agent, and another

ammendment will be required for this role.

ANDRIETTE will discuss this operation with the Station during

4.

- his TDY.

In view if the restricted OA which contines KUBARK'S

association with LICOOKY-1,

it is important that lleadyuarters renain

aware of any unusual activity in her personal life which might affect

her security

or the granting of amendments to ber OA for indi:idual

operations.

Therefore, we would appreciate your keping us informed

on a more timely basis of any undertakings such

as the recruitmerts

for menbership

in the AEM described in reference.

time as necessary to her work in the Mexican Writers Association (AEM -

Asociación de Escritores de Mexico), LICOOKY-1 has been almost totally

responsible for the AJM's development and present organization and is

a member of its

Eoard of Directors, which enables her to attend all

Board meetings. This assignment was the result of KÜBARK's interest in

toe activities of the European Community of Hriters (COMES - Comunite

Europea degli Scrittori) and

its efforts to estavlish a Latin iverican

branck.

¿. As operational dispauch covering LICUOKY-l's aclivities in the AEM

with Carlos Pellicer Cémara (not to be confused with Carlos Menuel

Pellecer), Migual Angel Asturias, Arnoido Orfila Reynai, and Benjamin

Carriór for the Congress of the Community of latin Auerican Writers'

(CLE - Conunidad La:iroacericana de Escritoresi to be held in Mexico

& City in 1966.

C. LICOOKY-1 sees Juan Rulfo regularly and reets oncs a week with

Pellicer, which enables her to keep current on their plans and activities.

do LiCOUKí-1 provided information on ESiIMi-l prior to his recruitmert

which suppderented that given by LINLUCK. (LICUOKY-l recommended ageinst

rhe direct recruitment of bSLIMi-l for reusons which later proved to

be true.)

Paz Paredes, Djuka Julius, and other persons of interest to the Station.

b. The Station KUCAGE officers are now considering a plan suggested

by LICOOKY-1 which would help sabotage any effort to take the AEMinto

the CLE.

1. LICCOKY-2 continues to report on the travel of Coamunists or leftists

Iron Central America to the Comunist hioc. During the perióù covered by

thia report, he reported on 1l individuals, all of whum traveled to the

Soviet Union or Sestern Europe.

2. Operations

a. LICOOKY-1 will continua to cover the activities of those planning

for the CLS Congress, the developments within the AZi, and will maintain

her contacts with Central American Communists and exiles in Mexico City.

This latter task has not

been as

successful as mas originall; planned

because her access has been limited for the reasors outlined in Para-

graph 5 of Reference A.

b. IICOOKY-1 has been given the following requirements in regard to

the ABM:

(1) To prepare complete assessments on all the influential AuM leaders.

(2) To provide a detailed account of LicUukY-l's Iufluence (leverage)

on them as a basis for;

(j) Using the AEM, when the time comes, to keep Rulfo ei al from

forning an affiliate in Mexico, preparatory to the CLE Congress.

(4) To continue developing a close friendship with Ruito and Pollicer.

(5) To continue her activities in the ABM in a manner to enhance her

stature and increase the leaders' confidence in her as one who

gets things done.

c. LicUUki-2 is not used ia any capacity other than reportiag travel

inforration to

which he has natural secess.

SECRET 1.

1. The first steps to organize the l'exican Writers' Associá-

tion (AEM - Asociación de Escritores de México) were taker

in February of 1964 after Bartolome Costa-Amic and the Zaplana

Bookstores published

a proposal in the metropolitan newspapers;

offering to establish a new series of library prizes and urging

the Mexican writers to join an association that could provide

material benefits for its members. The first meeting of the

„AEM was held on ll August 1964. For sore time the MEM remained

as insignificant as other sinilar organizations which had been

organized from time to time, such as the society of llterary Au-

thors and The Society of Friends of Mexican Books which never

achieved any effectiveness or respectability. Mexico's established

and well known writers have always shunned these organizations.

2. LICOOKY-l became interested in the dEll through her friendship

with Costa-Amic and saw the possibility of building the AEM into

an organization which would include the middle of the road and

right wing authors who had been systematically boycotted since

the Lazaro Cárdenas' regime when Narciso Bassols, a member of the

Communist Party, was Minister of Education.

3. LICOOKY-1 began a one man canpaign of recruiting relatively

well known right wing writers who could not be considered mediocre

or nonentities. As LICOOKY-l's campaien began to succeed it be-

came easier to recruit the nore important silters of Mexico cover-

1ng the whole political spectrum. In October of 1964, LICOOKY-1

SECRET

50-6-129/3

## Page 60

persuaded Carlos Pellicer Cánara, well koom Nexican poet, to

join the AEM. It then became easier to get other well known

writers to join. In all LICOOKY-l recruited about 80 of the well

Known Mexican

writers to come into the AEl. At this time LICoOKY-

I knew nothing of the European Community of Triters (COMES -

Conunité Europea degli Scrittori) or plans to form a Community

of Latin American Writers (CLE - Comunidad Latinoamericana de

Escritores).

4. LICOCKY-l has been appointed to the Board of Directors of

the AEl which permits LICOOKY-l to attend all Board Meetings and

she is relied upon to do all details of organization and planning

the AEM projects to assist the Mexican writer which is the ultimaie

objective of the AE!!.

5. In this work LICOOKY-l has developed friendships with the

leaders of the AEM including fellicer and Juan kulfo, both of

whom were Mexican delegates to the COlES Conference held in

Genera, Switzerland during the winter of 1965. bellacer has in-

vated LICOCkti to bla nome ard confers with her on All probiers,

usually once : week. Sne has frer entrance to Rulfo's office at the

Instituto Indirenista and he has visited LICCOXY-l's apartment.

6. The station nopes that through LIcocht-i the All can be lised

a Unity of liriters (UE - Unidad de Escritores) in Merico as

well' as sabotage the CLE Congress

to be held in Mexico in 1966.

7. To this end, one of LICOOKY-l's principal objectives is to

solidity her ucceptance in the AEM and she has been given the

inmediate tauks of:

a. Preparing complete assessments and personality data on

all of the influential AEl! leaders.

Detormining, LICOOKY-l's influence on them as a basis

b.

for;

c.

Usin: the AFM, when the time comes, to keep fellicer

and Rulfo from forming the VE affiliate in lexico, prepara-

tory to the comini CLE Congress.

d.

LICOOKY-1 is to continue her work in the AEM and to try

to become a close contident of Pollicer, Ru!fo and other in-

fluential leaders of the AEs.

8. The Station plans

to closely

watch the development of the

AEl and the plans

and

activitjes

of pellicer,

kulfo, Benjamin

Carrión, Miguel Angel Asturias and others who may participate in

planning

for the

forthcoming CLE Congress.

1. We vere especially pleased to receive the LICOOKY/l

target survey on Subject (of 201-12972) and to

learn that the

Station has a controlled asset who enjoys direct, non-profee-

sional,

social contact with Subject.

As the Station is avaro,

Subject's extra-curricular activitles have becone a natter of

Increasing CI corcern to a number of Stations in Latin America.

However, none of them appears to have assets

in sufficiently

close contact with Subject to determine that be is actually

doing and for wbum

He realize, of course, that LICOORY/1 pro-

bably will not be able to shed

any light

In this regard, but

we hope that her contact can be

exploited to provide the typo

of personal operational assessment data on subject which ve

have largely lacked up to now.

Our information on subjact has so far been

Ing on the point of ils suspected intelligence affiliation and

susceptibility to recruitnent

Nonetheless,

we regard LICOOKY/l's vlews regarding Subject as objective and

During future contacts,

we request that she con-

centrate on discerning Subject's persoual attitudes and weat

nesses or exploitable vulneravilities.

Should Subject bu trans-

ferred laterally to another location in the lest, we would 11k0

to try fron the vary outset of his assignment to undertake the

type of gradual, long-term developmental contact which LICOOKY/1

suggested.

To belpus plan for the selection of an appropriato

this purpose, ve belleve it would be useful for

LICOORY/I to prepare a personality profile on the type of 1nd1-

vidual to whom Subject 18 most Ilkely to respond and who could

hope to sain Subject's friendship and confidence with

least difficulty or disadvantage.
