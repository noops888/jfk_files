ADMINISTRATIVE (CON"T) :

FAUGNO dating from the time that FAUGNO was involved in

union activities in the International Longshoremen's

Association. Informant belleves that some of the money

that FAUGNO invests in shylocking and other enterprises

comes from PROVENZANO and Local 560 funds.

FAUGNO, according

to the informant, is presently engaged In shylocking,

numbers and fetcing stolen goods.

On 12/27/62, NK 2181-C advised that HAROLDi KONIGSBERG:

became involved in a brawl at a crap game in the Marion section

of Jersey City during the weekend of 12/15 - 16/62, and

KONIGSBERG stabbed one FRANk ROMEO who was running

game for ARMAND AUGNO.

As a result of all this, FAUGNO

went looking for KONIGSBERG and after several days, located

him and shot him with a shot gun. As a resulyot this

2000198

a meeting was held to straighten the affair out.

INTHONY* PROVENZANO along with JOSEPH ARTHURY ICARELLI an

ANGELQ DE CARLO, both of whon are well-known hoodlums in the

New Jersey area, met with FAUGNo.

VIOLA stated that of all the reasons expressed for the

disappearance of CASTELLITO the one that was popularly accepted

was the one that CASTELLITO. and PROVENZANO were in violent

disagreement over PROVENZANO's insistence that welfare money

he used for shylocking and other illegal activities. CASTELLITO

as Secretary-Treasurer of Local 560 maintained the positiod that

PROVENZANO should seek other sources of revenue for his

investments and when it became apparent that CASTELLITO was

going to maintain this position, PROVENZANO had hin killed.
