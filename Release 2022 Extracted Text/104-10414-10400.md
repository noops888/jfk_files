CURRENT OBJECTIVES AND PRODUCTION RELATED THERETO
ij
“A. Oliver G. SCANTLING Segment (in relation to project’ objectives.)

1.."Zo éollect operational information pertaining to LIMERICK personnel
and physical facilities."  SCANTLING has continued to provide worthwhile in-
formation in support of this objective. [(See previous project review forwarded
‘by HMMA-20052 of 18 October 1962.) During the past year SCANTLING was used to.
follow up leads produced by both LIFEAT|and LIENVOY in support of this objective.
In particular SCANILING provided, in blueprint detail, casing reports on the
homes ‘of two Soviet intelligence officers who are targets for Station technical
operations.

SCANILING also is used to aid the Station in maintaining current records
of the residences of. Soviet personnel living in Mexico. This is accomplished by
SCANTLING's followup of LIENVOY leads which indicate Soviet interest in renting
specific properties.

2, “To collect operational informtion pertaining to other targets of op-
portunity, foreign official installations and personnel of intelligence interest
operating in Mexico," SCANTLING has proved successful in providing information
on other Stetion targets: i

a. SCANTLING obtained information on (AEMIQUELET-2, a suspect Soviet
support agent vhich was the basis of further Station operations
against this target.

‘b. . SCANTLING provided 2 casing of the former Yugoslav Commercial
Office against which the Station had planned a technical operation.
However, this site was evacuatéd by the target mission before
plans were completed for this attempt.

c. SCANTLING has conducted detailed investigations in various cases
involving possible agents or contacts of hostile intelligence ser-
vices. These cases were of prime concern to Station Mexico but
frequently. were undertaken at the request of Headquarters or other
‘Stations. {

3. "To provide support to other Station operations as may be requested by
the .Station-officers. concerned.":)-In:thée~pastSCANTLING's activities in this area
Vere concerned primarily with recruitments, ‘debriefings and surveillances. During
the reporting period, however, the weight of SCANTLING's support to otherStation
opérations have taken other forms. ‘Exauples from this area of activity, include
the most fruitful efforts on Se part? « .

a. Support of the sensitive AMROD operation, in which Raymond H.
GERENDE also played a vital role, vas of singular importance to ,
the success of the operation, SCANILING's many fields of op-
erational experience were dram on fully and he thereby provided
a wique contribution to the operation. Without ‘the assistance
of SCANTLING and GERENDE with their unique qualifications, this
operation would have been difficult in the extreme if indeed at
all possible.

In support of the Station's harassment campaign against “Juan Jose)
“AREVALO” Bermejo,) launched’ at the request of Headquarters,
SCANTLING again provided the means for carrying out a large portion
of the action taken, SCANTLING's efforts ranged from the mailing
of "poisoned" candy to the! target to the placing of threatening
phone calls, SCANTLING also made calls to various Mexican news-
papers and mailed "montage" pictures of AREVALQ) and a Soviet in-
telligence officer to (Guatemalail newspapers in the campaign to_
discredit and discourage (AREVALO) in the (Guatemalan Pre: :
campaign. a a

c. SCANTLING is used as the alternate contectin a sensitive LAURICLE
project.’ This is for the purpose of minimizing the danger of the
action agent in this project being recognized as being in contact
with an obvious PRPRIME citizen. SCANTLING's. contribution, to this
operation has been noteworthy both from the standpoint of security
and agent handling. i

d.  SCANTLING continued to conduct numerous pretext and neighboraood
investigations.. As in the past many of these investigations were
in reletion to highly sensitive cases.

4, Although SCANTLING's LIEMPTY project, objectives can not be completely
fulfilled, it is the Station's opinion that SCANTLING continues to make valuable
contributions to the objectives of the project and to other Station activities.
SCANTLING's, production, measured against. monetary expenditure, case officer time
and other intangibles factors, unquestionably justifies his continuing as an ~
integral part of Project LIEMPTY. |

Although SCANTLING now’acts.as cutout with the LIMITED base, GERENDE continues
to be responsible for the processing ofall. photo take from the LIEMPTY operation

description of the functions of these three bases and,how they contribute to th

2. "fo collect operational infornation and identify operational leads
pertaining to Station targets of opportunity." The LIENTRAP operation,
handled by GERENDE, is still the major contributor to this objective. :
LIENTRAP. operational emphasis continues,to remain in the area of photo stakeout
of prominent Mexican Communists and is. presently working fulltime on providing
pictures of: individual Commmists,. homes suspected of being meeting sites used
by the Commmist Party and the Commnict Party Headquarters itself. LIENTRAP
has also recently ‘begun to be used on ZRKNICK leads. It is expected that
activities of LIEVIRAP.in that’ latter area will expand in the coming year.

3. "To provide operational support to Station operations including the

renting of hotel rooms and safe apartments, renting and servicing. of post office

boxes, and conducting counter-surveillences." GERENDE's contribution to the
AMROD operation was noted in paragraph'I.A.3.a. above. GERENDE's comprehensive
area knowledge and. personal operational capabilities enable him to wake a
valuable contribution in such operations as AMROD and also enable him to procure
the most desireable safe sites in support of the Station's operations. Thé
project's assets, particularly GERENDE and LIEMPTY-10, presently provide 20
post office box mail drops for use of Mexico City Station and other Stations.
Although it is planned to reduce this number considerably during the next year,
(since other Station assets now can provide a number of live accommodation
addresses), a number of post office boxes will be retained for use in future
operations,

4. The quality and quantity of opsrational information produced by the
photographic bases and other activities under GERENDE's control and supervision
is considered by the Station worthwhile and in some cases unique. It is con-
cluded, therefore, that this. segment of the LIEMPTY Project should be continued.

C. Relationship to the Related Mission Directive

As noted in the examples given above, Project LIEMPTY has provided valuable
support to many Station operations and thereby has been e. contributing factor to
the fulfillment of the Related Mission objectives of the Station. The project
has not produced any positive intelligence nor is it intended to do so. ‘The
project's sole purpose is to provide a nechanism for the development of opera-
tional information.
