Attontion: ‘Mr. 8. J. Papich i 1

FEOM : Deputy Director for Plsnos i
SUBJECI® Lyle STUART

Reference is made to your memorandum dated 1 June 1964,
in which you provided thig office with several questions you
sjehed to have passed to lites Viola June COBB regarding
Lyte STUART. Tasre foliovs the information provided by
fone tn anewew ta wour inquiry!

1. Regarding Lyle STUART, Juan Jose ANEVALO, and i
Antikomumisro en Asesica Latina: i

Eariy im the spring of 1962, in Hexic, AREVALO told
me that STULET wes prodding him about getting another of his
books tronsiated, to take advantage of the publicity around
‘Tre Shark oni the Sardines. 1 was already tar beyond

axing tered with Si ait ond therefore eeciined to have
payching further to do with Dim. About three months later,
RaEVALO told me that STUART waa going to publisa
Antixogunisao en Apomica Lntias end that a young Americaa
Sicdent, married to a Mexican, Angela dellt SAATE AZAOCHA
(eo nad written Arevalo, } i moranco, panlished
by Cost] Amie; 1908, fleance?d cri Revolucionario
ec EL Salvador) waa doing tae translation into English.
Early in 2983, ARKVALO told mo Shut the translation bada't
peen satisfactory and therefore STUAKT had obtained a re=
translation, by Charleton BEALS.

When STUART was here in Mexico im June, he told
br. OSECUEDA that he was very happy sbout the way the book
; was selling.

Yrasnuch as STUART has paid AREVALO oaly 10 per cent

of moneys received by STUART on the Snark and the Sardiucs \
gales (in contrast with some book ¢ cts in which the author
Ceceives \W per cent of the money repreacated by munber of
copies fold sultiplied by tne retatl sales price) i would
Seouse he 16 uo Bore gencrous S1th Ant txomuntsme. ;

‘ F oS LORY .

oar



» of course.

-o

I knov of no affiliations of STUART with foreign
political parties of government. His attempts to get cicse
to Fidel CASTRO in 1960 were motivated by a desire to exploit
the journalistic advantages of an interview. His original '
interest in The Shark and the Sardines ws apparently H
motivated by money-making interests and by the hope that
he might spark a pensation ~ exactly what he did mansye to
do with his outrageous advertising. He eeened to caiculate
that there might be libel suits possible sgainst the firms
and the nevepapers he could provoke to attack him.

The original contract of AREVALO with STUART was
superseded by another in Novenber of 1961, granting STUAST
certain righta with regard to other foreign language editions
of The Shark and the Sardines and, I believe, establtsbing
thet SRT ahantd toes Pivot antian am ather ABKVALO books

translated into English.

Information about STUART's dealings with AREVALO
and whatever others, could be obtained (with guiie) fron Ca
Eileen BRANT, who was iis editor at the tine of the firet
contact with AREVALO, She subsequently broke with hin
because of deep and bitter reseatsent against him, then
returned not too long ago to collaborate vith hin. Bhe is
his wife's sister. She is certainly working with him now :
only because he finally offered her a little better pay. For
her to have changed her mind about him would be almost i
impossiule, I believe, in view of the long history of incidents
that had brought her to have contempt for hin, at the tine
I knew her.in 1961. She knows his operation inside-out.
weation from her, it would be absolutely

necessary to approach her from some angle that would give }
no hint of government investigation, She is very gregarious. *
Bhe is a fortyish nedium-attractive, lonely, New York single
woman (unless her status has changed since I knew ber).
contacted by somebody she would assume to be a writer, and

who vould be a bit friendly with her and ace her off-hours, |
whe vould probably talk freely about STUART. But che 1s F
quite clever and rather worldly in some respects, so that must :
be kept in mind in case she 15 contacted. SHE HAS A VERY H
DESP AND LONGTIME NEGATIVE ATTITUOK, TOWARD ALL GOVERNGNT 3
AGEKCIES INVOLVED IN IXVESTZGATION. She wos active in

liberal activities in Chicago, and if I renenber correctly,
although she ig certaialy not communist, ube consicered berse#
@ little jeopardised by the Mc Carthy period. : i

2. Regarding Lytle. STUART, Dr. Beul CSECUEDA, Eertolone :
COSTA Amic, and Hario BORTEFOFKE Toledo: i

Dr. O3EGUEDA apparently has nad a secret: longing to
get something of his ows printed in English. Ee geized upon
the opportunity of commenting &SAL3" introduction to

When Dr, OSEGUEDA finally eid oce STUART here in

LYLE STUART
AREVALO “
*,TTIKOMUSISMO EN AMZSICA LATINA” :

Zarly in the spring of 1962, here in Mexico, Arévalo told me that Stuart
was prodding him abozt getting another of bis tooks translated, to teke ed-
vantege of the publicity around "The hark and the Sartines". I was alreaty
for beyond spesking veras vith Stisrt end therefore declined to bave anything
further to do with hin. About ciree months ister, Arévalo told ze that ftvart
was going to publién “Actikomiciszo en Americe Latina” and that @ young Acerican
student, married to s Mexican, Ansela delli Sente Arrocha (vio bed vritten
"arevalo, Fensador Centemporaneo"/* vas doing the translation into English.
Barly in 1363, Arévelo told me tist the transiation nadn't been satisfactory
‘and therefore Stuart bad obtained a re-translation, by Cherleton Beals.

Woen Stuart wes here in Mexico in June, he told Dr. Osecueda that he vas
very happy about. the weythe book vas selling.

Insameh es Stuart has paid frévalo only 10 percent of moneys received by
Stuart on "The Sherr and the Sariises” sales (in contrast with some book con-
tracts in viich the suthor receives 10 percent of the money represented by
nunber of copies cold multiplied ty the retei2 sales price) I would assume he
ig no sore generous with "Antikommisao". I cen esk Dr. Osegueds the exact
terrs, but I baven't been able to see Osegueda this week.

I know of no affiliations of Stuart with foreign political parties of
governzent. His stteapts to get close to Fidel Castro in 1960 vere motivated
by a desire to expicit the journalistic advanceses of an interview. His:
original interest in "The Sbert end the Sardines" vas apparently. motivated by.
money-asking interes: and by the hope thet he might spark @ sensation’ - exact]
what be diz manege co do with bie outrageous edvertising. He seened to calcu:
ate that there migst be libel suits possible egainst the firms and the nevs-
papers he could provoke to sttack him.

I am gure you Lave it on file, but I'vill enclose @ copy of Arevalo's
original contract vith Stuart. It vas superceded by another in Sovenbe> of
1961, grenting Stuert certain rishts with regard to other foreign language
editions of “The Shark and the Sardines" and, I belfeve, establishing that
Stuart abould have first option of other Arévalo books translated into English.

Information ebout Stuart's dealings with Arévalo md whatever others could
‘be obtained WITH GUILE from Eileen Brant, wbo vas big editor at the time of the

RE: LYLE STUART

This Bureau currently ig conducting an investigation in order
to determine if the subject bas violated the Registration Act. His
firm published the 1964 American ec.tion of the book entitled, "Anti-
Comaunism in Latin America,” written by Juan Jose Arevalo, former
President of Guatemala, The nature and extent of subject's relationship
with Arevalo is therefore pertinent to our investigation. a‘

As you know, Viola June Cobb, known to your agency, personally
knows Arevalo and worked with him on the translation of his book, "The
Shark and the Sardine.” It is therefore possible that Cobb may be in
® position to furnish sone information which can be of assistance to
this Bureau. We would appreciate if your agency would interview Cobb
and endeavor to obtain answers to the following:

(1) what information does she have concerning the relation-
ship between the subject an arevaio regaraing tne ovoK, vies Caen rrtond
in Latin Anerica"?

(2) Does she have any information indicating that subject
is in any way affiliated with foreign political parties or governnents?

@) Dees she knov of any contractual agreement existing
between subject and Arevalo or between subject and apy other foreiga
principals?

(4) Does she know of anyone else who may be in a position
to furnish information concerning subject? ‘

(5) In the event that Cobb is in a position to furnish infor-
mation concerning any of the above points, we desire to be-informed if
she would be willing to testizy in court. 4

outlined in the PEQ II forwarded with HIMS-22758. The OA as
granted, hovever, was restricted to approval to use LICOOKY-1 in
such a manner that information is taken from her, but that as little
classified information as possible is to be passed. Specific
requirements should be passed only when necessary, 2nd should be
made in such a mann.> that sensitive operational or ODYOKE programs,
plans, and objectives are not revealed. The office granting the
OA also indiczted that the linitations proposed in the Station's
comments in Section XVI of the P2Q II should be impienented.

2. If LICOOKY-1 is ever to be used as a directed and fully
controlled asset, without the limiatious expressed above, an
amendment to the OA will be necessary.

3. Reference is made to Section X, pzra 1 of the PEQ IT
forwarded in ref, which indicates that LICOOXY-1 may be given a
bonus for a particularly outstending job. The Station is reninded
that since LICOOZY-1 is a Contract Agent, and PBPRIX& citizen,
her contract must be amended each time s bomus payment is
contemplated.
