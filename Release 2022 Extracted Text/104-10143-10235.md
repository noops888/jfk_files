OLC 79-0113/8, Dated 5 Feb 1979, Subject:

House Select Committee on Assassinations

References to Overseas CIA Stations

1. This Office has reviewed your draft memorandum

including the options to be presented to the DCI.

2. We have no objection to the options presented.

In

this regard, query whether it would be appropriate at this

point to include your opinion as to the possible follow-on

steps which might be necessary if option (c) is selected and

the HSCA resists that decision.

3. We do suggest several editorial changes to the

memorandum.

First, you might consider inserting a new

paragraph 2, to make the basic issue known more quickly.

Perhaps the following would be

suitable:

2. Background: The material which the HSCA

presently contemplates publishing on an unclassified

basis will reveal the existence of CIA stations in

Mexico City, Layof and Helsinki!

Several other suggested changes are pencilled on a

copy of your draft memo, attached.

5. Please advise if we can be of further assistance.
