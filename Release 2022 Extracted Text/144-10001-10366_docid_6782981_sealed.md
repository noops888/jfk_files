1. President JOHNSON met with both ABDUL NASUTION, the -
Defense Minister of Indonesia and Pakistan's Foreign Minister,
ZULFIQAR BHUTTO, separately, NASUTION, in*response:to the concern
expressed by the President abou@ Indonesia's attitude toward
Malaysia, replied that Indonesia herself would not attack, but
would defend herself if attacked, I understand that the meeting
was profitable, The President expressed his concerg to BHUTTO
saying that he hoped to reaffirm frfendly rélations ‘between America
and Pakistan and asked that both Ptesidents get together soon.

2, At the time of President KENNEDY's death, President AZIKIWE
of Nigeria wrote to President JOHNSON saying that this assassination
indicates that there are deeply rooted feelings aga{nst the American
Negro, and that there is a need for serious considetation by the
African people as to whethér or not they can trust the U.S. because
of the strong elements which discriminate against the Negro, and
whether or not the UN should be moved to another country. I under-
stand that President JOHNSON without answering the ¢riticism
directly made a written reply on the 29th of Novembér to the effect
that the U.S. would"keep trying to promote equal human rights.
