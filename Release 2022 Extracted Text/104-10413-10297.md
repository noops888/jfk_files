4) LIFEAT/CUBAN

LIFEAT coverage of two relatives of AMSTRUT-2 provides an "essential" check
on the activities of AMSTRUT-2, and particular information which aids the in-
terested case officers pan the actual contacts with AMSTRUT-2 plus the progres
of the AMSTRUT operation, The value of LIFEAT providing an unilateral check
on the activities of AMSTRUT~2 and her relatives during critical periods of the
AMSTRUT operation cannot be over emphasized. Copies of the daily take from
the two lines covered by LIFEAT for the AMSTRUT operation.are forwardad
twice a week to WAVE,

5) LIFEAT/EXILE

LIFEAT information is drawa on heavily both for the present harassment camyai

directed against ESLARD~1 as well as for daily intelligence on the activities and
contacts of this target, Weekly summaries of LIFEAT provided material are
cabled directly to Headquarters and Station Guatemala City,

6) LIFEAT/AMERICAN COMMUNISTS

return from home leave of the ODENVY processor of these lines, . Travel and
contacts of the American Cominunist Group in Mexico (ACGM) provided by the
LIFEAT take are of particular interest to ODENVY,

PERSONNEL

avid M, WILSTED returned from home leave on 1 February 1963 and assumed full |

E sponsibilities as LIFEAT outside Case Officer. Wayne C, DRABAND and

qe ‘UIEMBRACE-8 who substituted for WILSTED in the LIFEAT operational and techni-

= cal-phases respectively during WILSTED's absence are to be commended for their
ti nia inta ining LIFEAT at the high level of efficiency and security normally enjoyed

the.operation. DRABAND's performance was the subject of separate correspon-

dénge (see, HMMT-3469),

Ag presently projected, Wayne C, DRABAND will be leaving Mexico on or about 1
November 1963, The responsible Station Case Officer and WILSTED are attempting

toiresolve the problem of a replacement for DRABAND at the local level, primarily

from the pool of agents already employed under the project,. This would have the

® advantage of not further disseminating the fact that LIFEAT does exist, but would

© have the serious drawback of giving knowledge of the whole operation (i.e. all

: basehouses) to another Mexican national. (Note: At present LIFEUD~2 and

{; LIFEUD-3, the two linemen who now coanect the tap lines so the basehouses, are

i-the only Mexican nationals who know of the location of all LIFEAT basehouses, )

“The Station does not desire another staff employee <o fill this position, but would
i,prefer a U.S. citizen, technically competent, with some working knowledge of Span-
ish or ability to acquire a working knowledge of Spanish, Since working papers are

extremely difficult to obtain at present, for cover purposes anyone coming into

|{ Mexico to fil the LIFEATT position would probably have to come as.a retired person

iewith a guaranteed income, It is thought that perhaps an individual retiring from one

Wot the Armed Forces in a technical rating might have the best possibilities of filling
all the requirements noted,

‘Although the Station will continue to explore all possible solutions to the problem,
it is requested that Headquarters’ views and, if possible, assiszance be givea the

2, “During the reporting period a number of memoranda were prepared by
the Station for passing to local ODACID and ODENVY based in whole or in part on
LIFEAT provided material, The following HMMs were provided as a by-product
of the LIFEAT Operation:
