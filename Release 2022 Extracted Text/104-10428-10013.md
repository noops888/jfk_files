REPORT ON VISIT OF FOREIGN SCIENTISTS, OCTOBER 4, 1971

There were four guests in the group:

DI. Alexei A. Moiseev; Central Inst. for Advanced Medical Studies, Moscow

Dr. Jean-Claude Nenot; CEA, Centre D'Etudes Nuclaires, Fontenay-aux-

Roses, France.

Dr. R. Masse, ; CEA as above.

The fouc visitors were not traveling torether, but by coincidence were

participants at the sane Transuranium Biology Symposium at Haniora during

the week of santa 120,

They were in San trancisco by. chance at the same

time and desired to visit Berkeley on the same dar

firs.

Ann@ Low-Beer picked up the four guests in San Francisco and brought

them

to the Donner Laboratory where they were greeted by Dr. John Lawrence.

Drs. Donald Van Dyke, James MaRae, and Howard Parker took them on a short

tour of the Anger camera facility and whole-body counting and scanning

equipment.

Major questions concerned the use of these instruments in monit-

oring and assessing the extent of persons contaminated with radionuclides

in industrial accidents.

Lunch was attended by Dr. Hardin Jones, the four guests, Drs. Van Dyke and

Parker, and Dr. Patricia Durbin, who acted as hostess and guide through

Topics discussed at lunch were centered about the Transuranium

The efficacy of two new techniques to remove lung contamina-

tion by alpha-emitting isotopes

The two techniques are

Lung lavage and aerosolized cheating agents, particularly DIPA.

A tour of Bldg. 74 followed lunch. Three of the visitors are biologists --

Dr's. Moskaley and Nenot are physicians, and Dr. Masse is a veterinarian --

and all deal with animal experiments or the interpretation of the results

of animal experiments.

They were much interested in

how one achieved

and managed a "biologically clean" rodent colony, in the minimum mainte-

nance rabbit rooms, and the cage-washing facilities. There was some

discussion about the 90-sr-injccted monkeys, there exposure levels, years

of follow-up, and the essential absence of biological effects at the

dose levels in the study.

A two-hour general discussion between and among the four guests and Dr.

Durbin followed the building tour.

The chief topics discussed were how

to explain the observed differences in the metabolism of the transuranic

elements among species.

The usefulness and verifiability of models of

human Pu metabolism were considered at great length.

areas of re-

search in internal emitters problems were

considered including

Dr. Durbin proposed a collaborative effort with two of Dr. Moskalev's

colleagues.

They have collected data on human skeleton weights, but

now do not have the time or interest to write up their material.

Durbin has collected all of the l9th century and early 20th centary

human bone weight data and would like to add the modern Russian material

Dr. Moskalev agreed to propose a joint article with his

colleagues looking towards publication in an international journal.

original data would be forwarded in any case as soon

as it could be copied.

in the late afiernoon the visitors toured (briefly) the Bevatron guided

by Ralph Thomas; the californium separation facility guided by Francis

licCarty; and the Hi-lac guided by Al Ghiorso.

DI. Moiseer, who is a

physicist, was very much intrigued by the proposal to make

an advanced

scientific instrument by joining the Bevatron and the Hi-lac.

Dre Moska-

the machines worked, "physics was not his

Mrs. Low-Beer tried to till them in on the duties an

Comments on money, budgets, problems of communication, demands on tilienot

understood it well.

Dr. Masse understood more English

One further point needs to be added. Althuugh ruclear medicine is not

a cuurent specialty in either country, and the use of nuclear medical

techniques, especially

as diagnostic

tools, is very limited, the tho

physicians indicated thay they personally were much interested, and there

has a definite trend in both countries towards more and more use of

such tools. "It is coming", they
