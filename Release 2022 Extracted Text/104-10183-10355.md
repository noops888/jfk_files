information wis as follows:

A. AMMUG-1 vag asked if he had anything now to
report, He brought up a most interesting case, ono
which could prove to be a valuable lead.

b. AMMUG-1 has known the RODRIGUES family since
his childhood in Regla (a small town across the bay
from Uavana), The father had been a bolita banker
during the Batista era.

¢. AMMUG-1 was very friendly with RODRIGUEZ' two

CONTINUATION OF
DISPATCH BECRET UFAA-1845

d. During the middle and late 1950s, Roberto
| had been a salesman for tho Burroughs flour company
! and had stayed clear of the political picture in Cuba. t

e. During the same period, Hector had been a
atudent in the University of Ravana, under Raul ROA,
Bnd had taken part in cone revolutionary activities.
io had been arrested and beaten by the Batista polico
for his anti-governzent actions and his father had
sent him into exile in the US.

{. When Castro came into pover, the fathor was |
a potential “var criminal” for hig illicit dealings.
AMMUG-1, who yas in tho police force in the initial
; stages of the revulution, states that he deloted an .
incriminating page from the father's dossier (shoving
he paid off the police to run his bolita operation)
and thus saved him from prosecution.

I |. g. AMHUG-1 continued to be close to the family,
especially vith Roberto, “whoa I sav every day and
ran around vith.” Roberto never entertained the
1 revolution, As late as 1962-63, "We used to talk
quite openly and ‘frankly. We was alvays against tho |
revolution and the communists. Ne worked in the va 1
} Ministry of Industry because his brother got him the
job, but he had only one idea in his head: to get out
of Cuba and come to the US. He was even plotting to
get out by boat, He had a US visa for many years and

had visited here many times."

l h. When AIMUG-1 defected, he lost contact with

i Roberto. But, about two weeks ago a neighbor from

! Regla came to Miami on the Freedom Flights. (COMMENT:
: This undoubtedly refers to Cuban refugee Segundo 7
| CASCUDO Gonzalez. Reference forwarded the AHOT Hq
debriefing of CASCUDO on Roberto.) When AMMUG-1 :
asked about Roberto, the neighbor said that he under~
stood that Roberto, “was assigned in a foreign ;
Eabassy." The refugee could not say what country

Roberto was in.

i. Thia news prompts AMMUG-1 to comment: "Shia
would be a most interesting person to talk to. I
don't think that he has changed his original way of
thinking. I believe he took the job to get out of
Cuba, and because of the-influence of his brother
Hector. { know he will talk to me and there is no :
telling what this man is capable of doing if someone
approached hin.” :

j. Roberto is (or was) married to:

Zulema (nu)
DPOB: c. 1934 in Cuba

They had two children and the wife was even
more anti-Castro than Roberto.

k. tector, the other brother, was a rabid revolutionary
when AMMUG-1 last saw him inc. -G4. He had joined
the Castro bandwagon at the outset due to his revolutionary
activities during the Batista era and his closeness to
Raul RGA, In c. 1960-61-62, Nector wes closely aligned

4. Soon after RODRIGUEZ joined the General Directorate
of Intelligence, he found he could no longer submit to having
his thoughts and sctions circumscribed by controls which
deprived him of liberty and self respect nor continue to
support the Cuban Government or be a part of its intelligence
activities; he therefore planned to defect as soon as the
opportunity arose, After deciding to leave Cuba permanently,
he began a systematic collection of documents at the General
Directorate of Intelligence Headquarters, We brought these
documents with him to the United States as proof of Fidel
CASTRO's subversive activities in Latin America,

DETAILED JUSTIFICATION AND ASSESSMENT

1, Vladimir RODRIGUEZ LaHera has cooperated with this
Agency since his defection on 21 April 1964 at which time he
turned over to CIA documents from the General Directorate of
Intelligence he had collected during the preceeding several
months. In addition, he has provided voluminous, accurate
and valuable information on the organization of the Cuban
intelligence services, their operations, staff members and
agents, These documents and information have given us the
potential and opportunity to take effective measures to
safeguard United States Government interests. Subject has
been of great value in the past, and will continue to be in
the tuture, in the CIA recruitment/detcetion program, His
wide acquaintance among and knowledge concerning high Level
Cuban diplomats and Cuban intelligence personnel provides
the Agency with the necessary background in planning operations
against them and makes Subject ideal tor use in carrying out
the operations, His talents and contacts can be used not only
in turthering the defector program, but in other types of
political action and psychological warfare operations.

2. As a result of technical intcrrogations of RCDRIGUEZ
on 11 May 1964 and again on 15 July 1966, his bona tides have
been established not only for intelligence exploitation
purposes but also tor the purpose of resettlement in the
United States. There is no reason to believe that RODRIGUEZ
is under the control of any hostile intelligence service.

3. The medical and psychiatric examinations have shown
that RODRIGUEZ has no serious medical or psychiatric problems.

4. Mr. RODRIGUEZ has adjusted well to American life.
He been trained as a dental technician and has recently
applied for employment with an airline company. It is
believed that he would be a solid, responsible citizen

1. On 27 January, Alien Affairs Staff advised that under
Section 313 of Immigration and Naturalization Act, AMMUG-1
cannot become an American citizen until after 10 years from
April 1964. While normal Cuban exile must wait five years,
Communist. party menbers must wait 10 years. AMMUG-1's
position as "intelligence officer" is considered a “neaningful
extension”. of CP membership.

2. In view of AMMUG-1's distinguished service to RVROCK,
WH Division will submit a memorandum through appropriate channels
requesting authorization to submit a bill to Congress to reduce i
AMMUG-1's waiting period from ten to five years. At this writing, i
we do not know how long this processing will take but will keep
you advised.

3. Paragraph 2 above is our intention and we naturally
cannot guarantee approval at this time. If a special bill is
passed by Congress, AMMUG-1 will go through routine application
for Naturalization with RVROCK guidance,
