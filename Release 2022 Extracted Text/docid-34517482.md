SUMMARY OF INFORMATION

1.(

LTC William J. Herlihy first came to the operational attention

of the 650th MI Detachment (650th MID) in approximately August 1967

when he misrepresented himself as a member of that unit on two separate

occasions, in both instances to Alta Fowler, the American Consul,

Brussels,

Belgium.

As a result, Herlihy received information to

The information

concerned an investigation then being conducted

by the 650th MID,

Its unauthorized release to one of the principals by Herlihy seriously

jeopardized the successful completion of that investigation.

2.UJes On an unrecalled date in the fall, 1967, Herlthy related that

he was having sexual relations with one Isabelle

Walton, and that

Walton might be of interest to intelligence authorities.

A subsequen

check revealed that Walton,

then and now, was employed as a switchboard operator at shape.

3. 0307 In late December 1967/early January 1968, Herlihy reported te

an agent of the 650th MID that he suspected Walton to be a low level

agent working for the Belgian Communist Party. He further stated tha

he thought Walton could be recruited to work for US Intelligence and,

Intelligence

ranking officers assigned to SHAPE. Additionally, Walton had taken some

personal letters from his apartment and that the contents of the letters

might be detrimental to him.

4.UeT

On 3 January 1968, information was received by 650th MID that

Herlihy's checking account was consistently overdrawn in large amounts.

Further investigation revealed a dividend check endorsed by Herlihy

to Walton.

aye In approximately February, 1968, Herlihy intimated that he

was involved in spotting and recruiting sources for other intelligence

activities, later identified by Herlihy as the 513th MIG, USAREUR.

Herlihy subsequently

admitted to receiving a phone call from Walton at the US Army Special

Security Detachment, EUCOM, but was unable to recall the details of the

conversation.

7.(Uke) On 8 May 1968, Herlthy was interviewed concerning Walton. He

stated that he first met Walton in September 1967, and

that soon there-

after she offered to supply information to him concerning the Communist

and Socialist Parties in Belgium.

Herlihy stated that Walton told him

she had been the mistress of Guy Cudell, a belgian Member of Parliament

and prominent socialist: that Cudell had paid her fare from the Us to

Belgium in 1967; and that she had the keys to Cudell's private office

and apartment.

Walton also told Herlihy that she had been trained in

communist Ideology,

had seen communist films, and had attended communist

lectures with Cudell.

Herlihy stated that he reported this information

to COL John Pratt and continued his association with Walton to gain

further information.

Herlihy further alleged that Walton may have

attempted to gain information from him concerning SHAPE Survey Section,

and that she had taken two personal letters from his briefcase in his

apartment which she believed could cause him embarrassment. Walton

later told Herlihy that she had the letters and would return them to

him at a later date.

Herlihy stated his belief that Walton was a notorious

liar and that she retained the letters to insure that he would not

reveal the details of her personal life.

8. (Ulce) On 8 May 1968, COL John Pratt, Intelligence Division, SHAPE,

stated that in October

1967, Herlihy had reported to him that walton

had offerred her services to US Intelligence and that she may have

attempted to solicit information from him concerning SHAPE.

Herlihy

also reported to Pratt that Walton had taken letters from him and that

she might attempt to use these letters to blackmail him.

from UK to US; and that if she "ever got into any trouble there would

be a plane standing by so my children and I would be safe." Walton

described Herlihy as an individual who considers himself

a "007."

She said that Herlihy would call her late at night to tell her he

was going to make a "contact"; that Herlihy stated he would sleep

with women if it was required to get information; that he carried a

gun frequently and on one occasion drew it on two women who surprised

them late at night on a street; that he claimed to have killed a man

who was a double agent behind the Iron Curtain; and that he talked

about his being under surveillance and in danger.

Herlihy related to

walton the name of a confidential source of the 650th MID.

He stated

that he had an Israeli girl working as a source for him, and that he

was protecting a Hungarian girl who would be killed if she returned to

English girl, and the Hungarian girl.

Herlihy discussed telephone

tapping with

Walton; stated that he

thought his telephone was being

tapped; offerred to

tap her telephone; and showed her some equipment

allegedly used to monitor telephone conversations. Despite her initial

refusal, Herlihy was insistent regarding Walton's recruitment as a

source,

and gave her

some literature concerning espionage cases to

read.

Herlihy revealed to Walton that she would be required to undergo

a polygraph examination prior to operating as a source.

On one occasion

he presented her with a

list of individual characteristics such as

"financial status" and "position" and requested that she fill in the

names and relevant information concerning individuals she had met

through Cudell.

Walton stated that Herlihy had

originally requested the return of the letters but had recently said

that he had no interest in them.

of blackmail.

Walton denied having sexual relations with any individuals assigned to

SHAPE other than Herlihy; she denied offering to furnish herlihy with

information concerning the Communist and Socialist Parties in Belgium;

she denied retaining the letters with any thought of blackmail, but

rather to remind herself of the mistake she made with Herlihy.

as "living on women and what he can get out of them."
