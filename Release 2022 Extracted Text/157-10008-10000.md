OCCURRENCE:

oз CAses net with TEPEDINO, who reported to him AMLASH's reaction to his meeting with

FITZGERALD. PEPEDINO said that AMLASH dwelt constantly on the fact that "he could not

understand why he was denied certain small pieces of equipment which promised a final

solution to the problem, while, on the other hand, the US Government gave much equipment

and money to exile groups for their ineffective excursions against Cuban coastal targets.

According to TEPEDINO, (AMLASIl) feels strongly on this point, and if he does not get

advice and materials from a U.S. Government technician, he will probably become fed up

again, and we will lose whatever progress we have made
