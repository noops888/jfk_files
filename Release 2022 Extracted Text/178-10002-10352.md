by the way, just go ahead and feel free to add.

and assassinate a Cuban leader, particularly Castro. And I
think you told me that your first contact with this
was a request by Dick Bissell. Is that correct?

E: Yes.

E: I don't remember /it was about the time of the
Bay of Pigs.

who was Dick Bissell?


Photocopy from Gerald R. Ford Library

Bissell was the Deputy for Plans --which is now
called the Deputy for Operations.

Among other things he was in charge of the whole
Bay of Pigs operation. Is that correct?

That is correct.

Do you remember what he said to you - and what you
said to him’ about this assassination plan?

Yes, I remember that. -- You had better turn off
that thing --

All right.

All right. You wanted me to restate the question.
What did he say to you, and what did you say to
him?

Bissell asked me if I had any assets that would
be available. .

Did he say tO be available for what?
Tnat- would be available into thd syndicate.

Did you ever talk to either Rosselli or Giancana?

I never met Sam Giancana. | I talked with
Johnnie jon several occasions.

Who did you use as your case officer?
I used James O'Connell.

You told me in a prior conversation that whatever
O'Connell did he did for you. Is that correct?

true and for anything he did,
That is absolutely/if there lis any blamey if is
mine. That's the way we operate.
Now, basically, who was the target then? —
The target was Castro.
And why did you feel -- or why did Bissell feel that
it was appropriate to use the syndicate?

gambling

Because of the/interests of the syndicate in the
Cuban mess.

They had -- there had been some question whether ot.
not they could continue under Castro and therefore |

That's right.

All right. Do you know the means by which they were
going to try to get rid of Castro?

Yes. I know.
And what was that?
By placing botulism pills in his food.

And supposedly there was going to be a person that
was going to get the pills over into Cuba to a

restaurant which Castro frequented. Was that it?

E:

B:

E:

Yes.

And do you remember the name of the person who was
going to do that?

I believe it was Juan Orta.

etting rid of Castrc


Photocopy from Gerald R. Ford Library

And do you know if the plan was carried out -the plan

obviously didn't succeed since Castro is still
living. Do you know if the pills ever got to Cuba?

No. Not of my own knowledge.

Do you know what happened to Orta?

As to why he

did or did not follow through with the plan?

Orta got scared.

Who was to get in contact with Orta? Was that
the syndicate?

I don't remember.

All right.

still in 1961 when‘he got scared?

+ Well, Orta got scared -- was this

the way, was in the Spring of 1961.

I believe it was '61.

The Bay of Pigs,

After he got scared, did you get involved with any
other plans on the assassination or did this plan
on the shelf, or what happened to it?

The plan, as I recall, petered out.

And did you become involved with any other person
to try to get these pills into Cuba?

No.

Now, who inside the Agency besides Bissell did you
have any contact with on the top echelon.

Very important.

Dulles and General Cabell.

The plan was approved by Alan W.

So there was Alan Dulles who was the DCI.

Yes.

And General Cabell was his deputy.

That's right.
And then this

That's right.

Richard Bissell.

occasion to brief anyone in the Administration
or the Government about this plan?

E: I briefed Mr. Harvey.

B: That was inside the Agency.

E: Yes.

B: ; Do you know whether or not Harvey --.

EB: , Oh, oh, and I briefed Robert Kennedy.

Be. . let me first talk about Mr. Harvey.

I . briefed him at the same time I briefed Papich..

B: All right. Now, that would have been in 1962 then.

Kennedy that you briefed Houston. Would that be: *

effect that he was. to know about these things.
~-- Words to that effect.

B: And when you briefed Robert Kennedy, what did you
. tell him?
E: I told him that -- this is all on the record, or
should be --
B: There was a memorandum prepared of it?
E: Oh, yes. It should be on the record. I'd rather
have you see that because it is verbatim.
B: Was there anything that you knew about this plan
to assassinate Castro that you didn't tell Kennedy?
E: No.
B: I think in our discussions before we started this
taping you said that you told him everything. Would

E: No.
B: . Did he in any way say that he disapproved of what
had been done in the past?

record: shows was in May of 1962, did you know that
Bill Harvey was undertaking another plan along these lines? Did
you know that or ty

E: No. I did not know.


Br . And you didn't tell Attorney General Kennedy at
the time. Is that right?

E: No.

Bz Now, you mentioned these pills. Did you ever

check the pills out to see whether or not they
might dissolve or anything along that line?

we started taping that you always like to double-
check things like that --

E: That's right. . ;

Bs Colonel Edwards, I asked you whether or not you knew
of any subsequent plans after these plans that were

dropped in 1961 and you said "no" Did you know of any plans other

than the plans that involved the use/this botulism pills?

of
E: No.

B: Is there anything else that you can think of that
might in any way be relevant or related to this
matter that you would like to state for the record?

E: No.
B: Is there any question you can think of, whether
I"

ve asked it or not that in any way would involve
this subject?


Photocopy from Gerald R. Ford Library

E: No. There is not--I mean--I would like to point out

on the tape that I've been out of the Agency--kept
away from it--for twelve years, so if there was something, I
don't remember.

B: Do you know of any other attempt at assassination
plots other than the Castro plot?

E: Absolutely nothing!

B: _ Do you have any suggestions or recommendations

concerning making the Agency a more effective
Agency just based upon your experience, an Agency that will do
a good job of intelligence but will also protect the rights of
Americans?

E: Bear in mind now that we are--it is all right to
: talk about the rights of Americans, but the rights
of Communists is a separate subject to me.

B: People abroad, you mean?
E: Yes. :
B: Colonel Edwards, I am just going to ask you one or

two more questions. In your work in the Office of
Security, were you aware of the fact that there had been some kind
of wiretapping incident out in Las Vegas involving either Dan
Rowan or Phyllis McGuire.

E: I knew of it from hearsay.

B: Do you remember who told you about it?

E: , I think it was Bob Maheu. .
B: Do you know anyone else outside of the Agency that

might have known of any of these plans at the time |
that they were being undertaken to try and assassinate Castro?

E: What plans? °

B: The plans that were being developed, trying to

assassinate Castro. Was there anyone outside the
Agency other than the syndicate people and the people they were
getting--was there any person in the White House that you knew
who knew about this?

E: Not that I know of and I am sure there were not.

B: You basically believe that this was a plan that was
developed by whom then?

E: By Bissell--by Bissell.

And you thought this was developed in connection
with the Bay of Pigs?
Right

Do you know if Mr. McCone knew about this when
he came in the Agency?

I don't know, but I don't think he did.

All right. Do you know whether or not Helms
eventually knew of the plan?

Yes.

Helms did. -

Yes.

I bélieve that's all. I'm going to turn the tape
off now. Is there anything else you'd like to say
for the tape?

No, I don't think so.

By the way, Helms did have knowledge of the briefing
of Attorney General Kennedy, did he not?

I'm not sure.

OK. You don't know if it was. I'm going to say
as a matter of fact I may have misled you because

I have notes that indicate that he did not know of the time you
briefed the Attorney General. Do you know anyone else that ‘did
know or did you just go over with Houston on that?

E:

B:

Just Houston and myself

And do you know if Attorney General Kennedy talked
with anyone else in the Attorney General's office?

I don't know. I would imagine that he talked with
Mr. Herbert Miller.

Do you know that of your own knowledge or you
just think you do?

No, no.

All right. Anything else you want to add for the
record?
No.

All right. Thank you very much, Sir, for your
cooperation.

‘sure.

One last question, Mr. Edwards. Did you ever hear
anyone say that there was a need to develop what

“was called an executive action capability on the part of the

Agency which was defined asan ability to liquidate foreign
leaders where it was required for American foreign policy?

E:

No.

You never heard either the phrase "executive action
capability” used? .

No. wht -

: . ia about
Did you ever hear the discussion/any need to develop
a capability to be able to assassinate foreign
leaders? . :

No.

And I think you said you don't know of any attempted
plans to assassinate people other than the Castro
target. Is that correct? ©
That is correct.

OK. Thank you. . . -
