ARE, HOWEVER, DEEPLY SUSPICIOUS-OF ASIAN LEADERS, THEIR WILL AND
ABILITY TO SURVIVE AGAINST DETERMINED COMMUNIST SUBVERSION» AND

BOTH SEEMED TO ATTEMPT To ELICIT STATEMENTS FROM COS GRITICAL

SUBJECT: Guidelines for Members of the Select Committee and’
ot Their Staffs While Traveling Abroad

There have been already and there will continue to be members _

of the Senate Select Committee (SSC) wi ; wish to travel abroad and >

talk to U.S. hanes and intelligence personnel. It is essential

‘that we agree on guidelines to avold “serious diplomatic. and security

roblens. The: following specitic guidelines are ig earch :

_ MEMBERS AND STAFF oF THE SSC SHOULD NOT PUBLICLY APPEAR TO BE

“: ABROAD. FOR THE PURPOSE oF. INVESTIGATING U.S. INTELLIGENCE

INSTALLATIONS. : i ae

Most of these installations, including all .cIA stations abroad,

fee cxample, are’ under some form of cover, or are , maintaining a low -

from exposure. at one Leste are U.S. intelligence activities

The. mere visit of ‘ssc representatives could be notéd'.as evidence

of U. .S. intelligence Peeganee within the country. Even in those
countries where U.S. Intelligence efforts enjoy the shielding and

: other benefits flowing from close liaison with the host government,

care is required to avoid the ‘potentially grave political ‘repercussions

that could result to U.S. and host country. activities from exposure
a : ef such liaison. Many countries that wish to cooperate with the

United States in intelligence endeavors simply cannot afford public -

exposure of such relationships. ° To help maintain the discreet:

nature of the visit, ‘it would be preferable if some reason’ ‘other

than SSC business could be given ae explain any visits by SSC members
. and staff. Xo ‘deliberate ‘contact should be made with the local press,

nor. should comments on SSC. matters be. supplied if investigating

* officers are contacted by the press. “Local press publicity pertaining

_to an S8¢ investigation abroad would in almost all cases be _

atstasteful to the host governnent.

Tn sun, sept in the case ‘of especially sensitive areas, discreet

vakrangements. can, be made for ssc visits to certain U-S. intelligence

‘activities: Ove rseas on a case by case basis, and with senior officers

“within the covering embassies, such visits are contingent upon the
‘sc member not publicly declaring himself to be on SSC business
at the time of the, visit or upon his return, and his. proceeding

on a basis “satisfactory & - the Ambassador.

“que AMBASSADOR AT THE EMBASSY VISITED WILL BE IN’ CHARGE OF TRE

Peres a

cee All arrangements.and contacts will be made by him, and because of his

: knowledge of local situations, his advice will be binding.



13-00000

IIL. FIELD DISCUSSIONS WITH U.S. INTELLIGENCE PERSONNEL SHOULD BE

It is more fitting that Washington be the place where operational
details are conveyed to the SSC. -Field intelligence elements will
only discuss operations in general terms--operational priorities,
the kinds of operations conducted, the operational environment,
_ velationships with the Embassy and defense attaches, etc. In all
{ ae 7 eases, such discussions #111 only be conducted in ‘physical

surroundings which meet appropriate security standards.

Members and staff of the SSC should refrain from asking to

“see texts of or general notes on intelligence agreements between

a the U.S. and the host government. These are“usually considered
by the ‘host government. as + extremely sensitive, politically and .
‘ operationally, ‘and cannot be divulged “without “the consent of the

host. govérnnent. .

: moms aN STAFF OF THE $SC WILL NOT INTERVIEW AGENT

PERSONNEL.

Foreign agent: ey eeacy are under hostile or local service

‘berutiny. For them to be placed in touch with SSC members would be

to run an unacceptable risk. Moreover, serious damage would be

. done to agent morale and motivation if their identity were to be .

revealed to Members or staff of the SSC.

Dear Mr. Bo}fen:

This letter is to confirm an oral request by Committee staff
for an orientation briefing for a visit to South America which two
members of the staff, David Aaron and William Trueheart, have been
asked. to make next month.

Although plans are not yet firm, it is expected that they will
be free to travel during the second and third weeks of September.

Messrs. Aaron and Trueheart are not expected to consult with
officials of the host government and, so far as the Committee is
concerned, the latter need not be informed of the visit.

Sincerely yours,

William G. Miller

MEMORANDUM FOR: Mr. John Waller
Special Assistant to the DDO

SUBJECT : Covert Action Operations Against
Right Wing Governments

REFERENCE : Chief, SS/CAG Memorandum, dated
18 July 1975
Subject: "Summary of Covert Action
Operations Against Right Wing Governments"

1. EA Division is concerned about Reference and its possible
use in briefing the Senate Select Committee. Specifically, our. concern
centers on describing the EA operations contained in the attachment to
Reference as "were mounted against" "right wing governments".

None of the EA operations -- DNSCOOP, DNSPROUT (both of which
took place in and TUMIX (which took place in --

were or shou! so described as being mounted against the government
then in power. In fact, just the opposite is true. All of these
operations, while covert in the sense that the U.S. Government hand
was never disclosed, were primarily designed to broaden the base of
the governments in power and enhance its stayability by providing
advice and support to "grass root elements" in an attempt to get these
elements to function as a more cohesive organization in seeking
participation in the governmental process.

2, While all of the operations have been terminated, the
DNSCOOP operation is perhaps the most sensitive of the three, in that
it represented an initial effort by the Agency to establish contact with
opposition elements in As noted above, the purpose of
this contact.was not to overthrow the ruling government but rather to
assist the opposition in establishing itself as a more viable force in its
effort to establish a two-party system in The Agency today

SUBJECT: Guidelines for Members of the Select
Committee and Their Staffs While
Traveling Abroad

There have been already and there will continue to
be members of the Senate Select Committee (SSC) who
wish to travel abroad and be in conversation with our
Stations. It is important that we agree on guidelines
to avoid serious security problems from arising. The
following specific guidelines are considered important:

a Members of the SSC_and members of its staff
should not publicly appear to be abroad for
purposes of investigating CIA installations.

A Stations abroad, a of which are under
some form of cover, have and need varying
degrees of protection from exposure. At
one extreme are Stations behind the iron
curtain or in other particularly sensitive
areas which need maximum protection. At
the other extreme are Stations which enjoy
close liaison with the host government and
are thus less sensitive. In the first case,
Stations existing under strict cover conditions
in sensitive environments, the very presence of
SSC members could be highly provocative by
flaunting the fact of CIA's presence. But
even in countries in which we enjoy a good
liaison with the host country's security
service, there remains a need to be discreet.
Many countries whose services want to ‘be
cooperative with CIA cannot afford public or
parliamentary exposure of the relationship.
Local press publicity pertaining to an SSC
investigation abroad would in almost all
cases be distastefull to a host government.

SECRET,


13-00000 _

aie
SECRET

In sum, except in the case of very sensitive
areas, discreet arrangements can be arranged

for SSC visits to CIA's overseas stations and
with senior officers within the covering Embassy
provided the SSC member does not publicly declare
himself to be on SSC business and maintains his
Station contacts on a discreet basis.

Members of the SSC and their staff should not
question Station personnel on specific operational
etail. It is more fitting that Washington be the
place where operational details are conveyed to
the SSC. It is at Headquarters where the guide-
lines are best understood, where the most complete
and authentic records are kept (many Stations
finding themselves in dangerous crisis situations,
have periodically destroyed their files). There
is no reason, however, that Station Chiefs should
not discuss operations in general terms -- opera-
tional priorities, the kinds of operations, the
operational environment, relationships with the
Embassy, the service attaches, etc.

Members of the SSC and their staff should not
Interview agent personnel. Foreign agent
personnel frequently are under hostile or
local service scrutiny. For them to be placed
in touch with SSC members would be to run an
unacceptable risk. Moreover, serious damage
could be done to agent morale and motivation
if they were to think their role had been
revealed to members of Congress.

Members of the SSC_and their staff should not

in most cases be in contact with members o

host country's intelligence or security services.
Many services will find contact with the
politically difficult and will avoid it. They
further regard that their relationships with CIA,
the information they pass us and the sort of
cooperation extended as a most sensitive matter.

SECRET

i

i

No matter what assurances are given them,
they would find it difficult and awkward to
discuss these matters with the SSC or its
staff, and the very fact that such matters
were under investigation could well cause
them to reassess the desirability of a
relationship with CIA or other U.S.
intelligence agencies. Exceptions can
perhaps be made in special cases.

Members of the SSC and their staff should
not visit foreign technical intelligence
installations. Again there may be exceptions
to this which can be arranged, but in most
countries in which we operate joint technical
collection sites, the host service would be

opposed to access by Congressional representatives.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Central Intelligence

SUBJECT : Senator Gary Hart's. Request to Talk
to QJUWIN While Traveling in Europe

This is for your information concerning Senator Gary
Hart's request to talk to a former agent while the senator
is traveling in Europe.

The agent is QUJWIN. . He was first approached in 1958
through the head of the
At first he was used mainly to spot potential agents in
various European countries. Later he became the major
asset under ZRRIFLE. In this. capacity he made.a brief
visit to the Congo, but took no actions.

On the weekend of 7 June 1975, members of the Senate
Select Committee staff spent many hours at Headquarters
reading files, including QJWIN and ZRRIFLE, among others.
QUJWIN's true name contract is in the file which they read.
So is a street and post office address as of 1964, the
time when we ended our contract with this agent. We have
not contacted him since.

We have heard that David Aaron of the Senate Select
Committee staff telephoned QJWIN. This report remains
unconfirmed. We have protested to Bill. Miller.

; It is difficult to imagine how a U.S. senator could
talk to a former agent without arousing the interest of
the local intelligence service and

"of the host government who mig! wonder abow @ propriety

of investigations being conducted on their territory and
involving one of their citizens.

In any event, an approach of this nature would be
of interest to the Department of State, and the senator
might wish to consult with the Department before -proceeding.

Talking Points For Use With Senator Gary Hart On His Proposed

Contact With QJWYN

Senatorial contact with a former CIA agent would run the
risk of his exposure to his local government and the press.
Because of his former activities and relationships he
might be subjected to reprisals from abroad, possible
prosecution for espionage at home from his local govern- —
ment and harassment from the media.

Active as well as former CIA agents abroad would have
further cause to believe that the American intelligence
service is incapable of protecting its informants from dis-
closure. Contacting an agent.under the insecure conditions
involved would violate the Agency's promise to this former
informant to protect the confidentiality of the relationship.

Foreign intelligence services with which the CIA is in
liaison would find this approach highly unprofessional

and risky. It is bound to raise further questions about
the dangers of continued confidential cooperation with

the CIA.

It is possible that the local government involved might
lodge a formal protest. to the-US mission protesting the
unusual procedure of a Senate investigating committee
interrogating its nationals in violation of its sovereignty
without requesting formal permission.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Central Intelligence

This is for your information concerning Senator Gary
Hart's request to talk to a former agent of ours while ae
traveling in Europe. :

You should know that we have been told that the
Senate Select Committee staff has already been in touch
with this agent by telephone. We do not know how they
learned his true name or his whereabouts. We have already
advised David Aaron of the Senate Select Committee staff
of a potential problem.area in connection with such a
proposed. meeting.. The agent in question is, of course,

a subject. of interest to.the local intelligence service

and we doubt that the host government or the intelligence
service would agree. that.a United States senator, especially
a member of the Senate Select Committee, may appropriately
conduct such investigations within its territory without
clearance to’ do so.

In any event, an approach of this nature would be
of interest and. indeed-of concern to the Department of

with them before proceeding.

For your information, the agant referred to is

BRACKETS,

SUBJECT: GUIDELINES FOR MEMBERS OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE AND
THEIR STAFFS WHILE TRAVELING ABROAD

There have been already and there will continue to be members

of the Senate Select Committee (SSC) who wish to travel abroad and

talk to U.S. embassy and intelligence personnel. It is essential
that we agree on guidelines to avoid serious diplomatic and security

problems. The following specific guidelines are applicable.

I. MEMBERS AND STAFF OF THE SSC SHOULD NOT PUBLICLY APPEAR TO BE

ABROAD FOR THE PURPOSE OF INVESTIGATING U.S. INTELLIGENCE
INSTALLATIONS.

Most of these installations, including all CIA stations abroad,
for example, are under some form of cover, or are maintaining
a low profile. Certainly all have and need varying degrees of
protection from exposure. At one extreme are U.S.. intelligence
activities behind the iron curtain. These clearly need maximum
protection. Ther mere visit of ‘ssc representatives could be
noted as evidence of U.S. intelligence presence within the
country. Even in those ‘countries where U.S. intelligence
efforts enjoy the shielding and other benefits flowing from
close liaison with the host government, care is required to

avoid the potentially grave political repercussions that

25° Tune latest vevsron, sacar povatiny

proposed clorges by DoD.


13-00000

could result to U.S. and host country activities from exposure
of such liaison. f{Several foreign governments or ‘entities thereof
now willing to cooperate privately with the U.S. in intelligence
agreements~exchanges maintain atrongYneutral or anti-U.S. foreign
policies; continuation of such agreements-exchanges is therefore
dependent upon avoidance of their public disclosure. -In many
cases termination of such agreements would result in the loss

of: unique strategic intelligence, and alternate collection

methods are either not available or are prohibitively expensive

To help maintain the discreet nature of the visit, it would be
preferable if some reason other than SSC business could be
given to explain any visits by SSC members and staff. No
deliberate contact should be made with the local press, nor
should comments on SSC matters be supplied if investigating
officers aré contacted by the press. Local press publicity

pertaining to an SSC investigation abroad would in almost all

cases be distasteful to the host government.

In sum, except in the case of especially sensitive areas,
discreet arrangements can be made for SSC visits to certain U.S.
intelligence activities overseas on a case by case basis, and with
senior officers within the covering embassies. Such visits are
contingent upon the SSC member not publicly declaring himself
to be on SSC business at the time of the visit or upon” his

return, and his proceeding on a basis satisfactory to the Ambassador.


13-00000

In.

THE AMBASSADOR AT THE EMBASSY VISITED WILL BE IN CHARGE

OF THE VISIT.
All arrangements and contacts will be made by him, and because

of his knowledge of local situations, his advice will be binding.

FIELD DISCUSSIONS WITH U.S. INTELLIGENCE PERSONNEL SHOULD BE
CONDUCTED ONLY IN GENERAL TERMS.
It is more fitting that Washington be the place where operational

details are conveyed to the SSC. Field intelligence elements

“will only discuss operations in general terms--operational

priorities, the kinds of operations conducted,.the operational
environment, relationships with the Embassy and defense’ attaches,
etc. In all cases, such discussions will only be conducted in
physical surroundings which meet appropriate security standards.

Members and staff of the SSC should refrain. from asking to
see texts of or general notes on intelligence agreements between
the U.S. and the host government. These are usually considered
by the host government as extremely sensitive, politically and
operationally, and cannot be divulged without the consent of
the host government.

i

MEMBERS AND STAFF OF THE SSC WILL NOT INTERVIEW AGENT PERSONNEL.
Foreign agent personnel frequently. are under hostile or local

service scrutiny. For them to be placed in touch with SSC members


13-00000

S

would be to run an unacceptable risk. Moreover, serious
damage would be done to agent morale and motivation if their

identity were to be revealed to Members or staff of the SSC,

MEMBERS OF HOST COUNTRY INTELLIGENCE OR SECURITY SERVICES

Many foreign intelligence services will find contact with the
SSC politically difficult and will avoid it. They further regard
that their relationships with U.S. intelligence activities, the
information they pass, and the cooperation extended are all most

sensitive matters. Regardless what assurances are given then,

“they would find it difficult and awkward to discuss these matters

with members or staff of the SSC. The very fact that such matters i
were under investigation could well cause the host service to
reassess the desirability of a relationship with U.S. intelligence

activities.

MEMBERS AND STAFF OF THE SSC SHOULD NOT VISIT FOREIGN TECHNICAL

INTELLIGENCE INSTALLATIONS.

In those countries in which we operate joint technical collection
sites, the host would be firmly opposed to access by U.S.
Congressional representatives, especially where there is public

knowledge of the Congressional investigating interests. If such


Vil.

a visit is considered essential, a special request must ‘be

ated with the’ host country in advance.

Senate Select. Committee principals and staff should --
understand the distinction between U.S. intelligence
installations abroad and joint U.S.-foreign intelligence
installations or foreign intelligence installations supported
by. the U.S. intelligence community. Access to the former

is at the discretion of ‘the U.S. Ambassador ; access to the

latter two is at the discretion of the foreign government

involved J

AN- ORIENTATION BRIEFING WILL BE PROVIDED ALL MEMBERS AND STAFF,

PRIOR TO DEPARTURE.

This briefing will be conducted by the DCI and other representa-
tives of the Intelligence Community (CIA, NSA, DIA, State, etc.),
as appropriate. The purpose of this briefing is to familiarize
the visitor with the types of activities conducted at each
location, the restraints which are imposed upon U.S. activities
in each case and the considerations which preclude the discussion

of ‘operational details, names and terms in an overseas environment.

- Members and staff of the SSC should bear in mind at all times that

they and their activities are matters of great interest to opposition

intelligence services, as well as to the press. Committee and staff

members, particularly those who are publicly prominent, can hardly

travel inconspiciously and will be easily recognized.

MEMORANDUM OF CONVERSATION

DATE AND- PLACE: 17 June 1975 1000 - 1100
Room 2E-45

SUBJECT: Conversation by Mr. John Waller, SA/DDO with
Mr. David Aaron, member of Senator Mondale's
staff, with Regard to the Senator's Proposed
Trip to Europe

1. According to Mr. Aaron the Senator and Mr. Aaron's itinerary,
while not yet fixed, will be along the following lines:

a. 30 June - 1 July: London
b. Monday, 7 June: Vienna, for one day

c. Paris and Bonn. Although the order has not yet been
determined, the Bonn stop would be two days and the
Paris stop, one day.

In the period between London and Vienna, the party intends to visit
Oslo and Helsinki.. The purpose of this part of the trip, however,

has = to_do with the SSC and the party does not want or need

2. Mr. Aaron agrees that in discussions with Stations, the
party should not get into specific operational cases. They want to
discuss “more generic" subjects: operational priorities, relations
with the Embassy, problems, scope of liaison, operating conditions,
etc. Their basic interests are related to "command and control".

It had occurred to Aaron that Vienna would be a good example of a
Station which concentrates on "East - West" operations (read third
country, Sov and Sov Bloc operations). He recognized London was a
liaison station. Mondale, however, was anxious to talk to Cord Meyer.

SECRET | Ba INPDeT.


SECRET

Paris, he felt, would provide some understanding of "third world”
operations. Bonn, he felt, would be a good example of the inter-
relations of a CIA Station with the Military and the Foreign Service.

3. Mr. Aaron stated that he had already sought out

of the Embassy, requesting that contacts be arranged in

with the appropriate Foreign Office or Intelligence Offices
in order to discuss the expt
Aaron is also interested 1n how the
works. He had heard that it was proving inadequate. Mr. Aaron
stated that had not been enthusiastic about the idea but
promised to look into it. Aaron felt that it had been better to
work directly with J whom he claimed to know,than to involve
the Agency's go-between.

4. Mr. Aaron intended to make a similar approach to the German
Embassy. :

5. Mr. Waller commented that such approaches to foreign
governments would make our liaison services uneasy and could
adversely affect their willingness to cooperate. To this reason,
we did not favor involving foreign governments -- at whatever
level or wherever in the bureaucracy. Moreover, contacts with
foreign governments increased the likelihood that the true purpose
of the Senator's trip could leak to the press. Mr. Waller mentioned
that he would want to bring this to the attention of others.

6. Mr. Aaron agreed that the Senator, through press conferences
or otherwise, would not make public the fact that his trip was
connected with Select Committee investigations.

7. Mr. Aaron said that he and the Senator were in touch with
Mr. Hyland of the State Department with regard to this trip. He
also suggested that they might get in touch with military intelligence
services in Washington and in the field. He made specific reference
to "Naval Intelligence".

8. Mr. Aaron stressed the fact that the itinerary was still
tentative and subject to change.

SEGRET


| SECRET

9. At one point, Mr. Aaron asked if CIA had any aircraft
in Europe which could be put at Senator Mondale's disposal.
Mr. Waller replied negatively.

10. Mr. Aaron felt that it was unlikely that Mr. Bader
would be a member of the Senator's party.

SUBJECT: Guidelines for Members of the Select
Committee and Their Staffs While
Traveling Abroad

There have been already and there will continue to
be members of the Senate Select Committee (SSC) who
wish to travel abroad and be in conversation with our
Stations. It is important that we agree on guidelines
to avoid serious security problems from arising. The
following specific guidelines are considered important:

ete Members of the SSC _and members of its staff
should not publicly appear to be abroa' or
urposes of investigatin installations.
CIA Stations abroad, all of which are under
some form of cover, have and need varying
degrees of protection from exposure. At
one extreme are Stations behind the iron
curtain or in other particularly sensitive
areas which need maximum protection. At
the other extreme are Stations which enjoy
close liaison with the host government and
are thus less sensitive. In the first case,
i Stations existing under strict cover conditions
| in sensitive environments, the very presence of
SSC members could be highly provocative by
flaunting the fact of CIA's presence. But
i even in countries in which we enjoy a good
| liaison with the host country's security
i service, there remains a need to be discreet.
i Many countries whose services want to be
cooperative with CIA cannot afford public or
parliamentary exposure of the relationship.
Local press publicity pertaining to an SSC
investigation abroad would in almost all
cases be distastefull to a host government.

SECRET


C SECRET O

In sum, except in the case of very sensitive
areas, discreet arrangements can be arranged

for SSC visits to CIA's overseas stations and
with senior officers within the covering Embassy
provided the SSC member does not publicly declare
himself to be on SSC business and maintains his
Station contacts on a discreet basis.

Members of the SSC and their staff should not
question Station personnel on specific operational
etail. It is more fitting that Washington be the
place where operational details are conveyed to
the SSC. It is at Headquarters where the guide-
lines are best understood, where the most complete
and authentic records are kept (many Stations
finding themselves in dangerous crisis situations,
have periodically destroyed their files). There
is no reason, however, that Station Chiefs should
not discuss operations in general terms -- opera-
tional priorities, the kinds of operations, the
operational environment, relationships with the
Embassy, the service attaches, etc.

Members of the SSC and their staff should not
interview agent personnel. Foreign agent
personnel frequently are under hostile or
local service scrutiny. For them to be placed
in touch with SSC members would be to run an
unacceptable risk. Moreover, serious damage
could be done to agent morale and motivation
if they were to think their role had been
revealed to members of Congress.

Members of the SSC and their staff should not

in most cases be in contact with members of

host count S intelligence or security services.
Many services will tind contact with the SST
politically difficult and will avoid it. They
further regard that their relationships with CIA,
the information they pass us and the sort of
cooperation extended as a most sensitive matter.

SECRET


SEunEs

No matter what assurances are given them,
they would find it difficult and awkward to
discuss these matters with the SSC or its
staff, and the very fact that such matters
were under investigation could well cause
them to reassess the desirability of a
relationship with CIA or other U.S.
intelligence agencies. Exceptions can
perhaps be made in special cases.

Members of the SSC and their staff should

not visit foreign technical intelligence
installations. Again there may be exceptions

SUBJECT:. Guidelines for Members of the Select Committee and i

Their Staffs While Traveling Abroad

There have been already and there will continue to be: members

of the Senate Select’Committee.(SSC) who wish to travel abroad and.

we agree on guidelines. to. avoid serious: diplomatic and security. prablems..

“The following. specific guidelines are applicable:

I, MEMBERS AND'STAFF OF THE SSC.SHOULD PUBLICLY APPEAR

TO BE ABROAD FOR SOME: PURPOSE OTHER THAN THE

INVESTIGATION OF U. S.: INTELLIGENCE INSTALLATIONS,

Most of these. installations, including all CIA stations abroad, for

ens example}: are under. some-form of cover, or are maintaining a low

profile. : Certainly all have and need varying degrees of. protection
from exposure. ‘At. one extreme are U.S. intelligence activities
behind the iron curtain. These clearly need maximum protection.
The mere visit of SSC representatives could be noted as evidence
, of U.S. intelligence presence within the country. Even in those é
countries where U.S. intelligence efforts enjoy the shielding and

other benefits flowing from closé liaison with the host government,

care.is required to avoid the potentially grave political repercussions


13-00000

ar

that could result to U.S. and host country activities from exposure

of such liaison, Many countries that wish to cooperate with the

United States.in intelligence endeavors simply cannot afford public
exposure of such relationships..: Some reason other than SSC business
should be given to explain any visits by SSC members oad ae to

help maintain the discreet nature of the visit. No deliberate contact
should.be:made with the Yocal press, ‘nor should comments. on SSC
matters be. supplied if investigating. officers are: contacted by the
press. Local. press. publicity pertaining to an SSC investigation abroad
would in almost all cases be distasteful to the hest government.

In sum, except in the case-of espécially sensitive areas, riperet
arrangements can be made for SSC visits to certain U.S. intelligence
activities overseas'on a case by case basis, and with senior officers
within the covering embassies. Such visits are contingent upon the
SSG niember not publicly declaring himself to be on SSC business
at the time of the. visit or upon his return, and his proceeding on a

basis satisfactory to the Ambassador.

THE AMBASSADOR AT THE EMBASSY VISITED WILL BE IN CHARGE
OF THE VISIT. :

All arrangements and contacts will be made by him, and because of his

. knowledge of local situations, his advice will be binding.


qt.

FIELD DISCUSSIONS WITH U.S. INTELLIGENCE PERSONNEL

SHOULD BE CONDUCTED ONLY IN GENERAL TERMS,
It is more fitting that Washington be the place where operational
details are conveyed to the SSC. Field intelligence elements will
only discuss operations in general terms -- operational priorities;
the kinds of operations conducted, the operational environment,
relationships: with the Embassy and defense attaches, etc. In all
cases, such discussions.will only. be conducted.in physical surroundings
which meet appropriate security standards.

Members and staff of the SSC should refrain from asking to
see texts of, or general notes on intelligence agreements between the
U.S.. and the -host government. These are usually considered by the
host government as extremely sensitive, politically and operationally,

iS
and cannot be: divulged without the consent of the host government.

MEMBERS AND STAFF OF THE SSC WILL NOT INTERVIEW AGENT
PERSONNEL,
Foreign agent personnel frequently are under hostile or local service

scrutiny. For them to be placed in touch with SSC members would be


to run an. unacceptable risk. Moreover, serious damage would be
done to agent morale and motivation if their identity were to. be

revealed to Members or staff of the SSC. a

MEMBERS OF HOST COUNTRY INTELLIGENCE OR SECURITY

“SERVICES WILL BE.CONTACTED ONLY IN EXCEPTIONAL CASES:

Many foreign intelligence services will find contact with the SSC
politically difficult and will avoid it.. They further regard that their.

relationships with U.S. intelligence activities, the information they

pass, and the cooperation extended are all most sensitive matters.

Regardless, what assurances are given them, they would find it

difficult and awkward to discuss these matters with members or

staff of the SSC: The very fact that such matters were und
%. ; . rai
could well cause: the host’service to reassess the desirability of a

relationship with U.S. intelligence activities.

EMBERS AND'STAFF OF THE SSC SHOULD NOT VISIT FOREIGN
TECHNICAL INTELLIGENCE INSTALLATIONS,

In those countries in which we operate joint: technical collection sites,
the host would be firmly opposed to access by U.S. Congressional
representatives, especially where there is public knowledge of the

Congressional investigating interests. If such a visit is considered

investigation


13-00000

essential, a special request must be negotiated with the host’ country

in advance.

vi. AN ORIENTATION BRIEFING WILL BE PROVIDED. ALL MEMBERS
AND STAFF, PRIOR TO DEPARTURE, .
This briefing will be conducted by the DCI:and other vepresentatives
of the Intelligence Community (CIA,.NSA, DIA, State, etc.), as:
appropriate. The purpose of. this briefing is to familiarize the.
visitor with the.types of activities conducted:at each ee the
restraints which are imposed upon U.S. activities in each Mia :

the considerations which preclude the discussion of operational details,

names and terms in an overseas. environment.

Members and staff ‘of the SSC should bear in mind at all times that i

on

they and their activities are matters of. great interest to opposit:

intelligence services, as well.as.to thepress. Committee and staff.
members, particularly those who are publicly prominent,.can hardly

travel inconspiciously and. will be easily recognized.
