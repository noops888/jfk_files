BISSELL tostified that he "very definitely" (p. 75) asked

O'DONNELL to investigate the possibility of killing

LUMUMBA.

BISSELL said that this could be an example of Executive

Action capability but when pressed

on the contradiction

between the dates of late 1960 for his conversation with

O'DONNELL and May 1961 (or early 1961) for his establishment

of the Executive Action capability, he said that he did not

remember whether his assignment to

O'DONNELL was part of the

Executive Action program. (p. 70).

that Mobutu would remain in the background."

Mr. Merchant reported on discussions with Hammarskjold: "He has swung away

OCCURRENCE:

BISSELL said that the philosophy described by the Chief of the CIA Africa Division, probably

BRONSON TWEEDY, in a memorandum in late 1960, was probably applicable to matters within the

scope of Project ZRRIFLE. The memorandum recommended the agent WIROGUE in these terms:

"He is indeed aware of the precepts of right and wrong, but if he Is given an assignment,

which may be morally wrong in the eyes of the world, but necessary because his case officer

ordered him to carry it out, then it is right, and he will dutifully undertake appropriate

action for its execution without pangs of conscience. In a word, he can rationalize all

actions" (59).

On June 19, 1963 the meeting was held with "higher authority" at which a program

for "external sabatoge" for Cuba was approved with the understanding that operations

will not begin until mid-July.

The program was to be directed at four major

segments of the Cuban economy: (a) electric power (b) petroleum refineries and

storage facilties (c) railroad and highway transportation (d) production and

manufacturing." The purpose of this and other programs is to "nourish a spirit

of resistance and disaffection which could lead to significant defections and

other by-products of unrest." :

scope of Project ZRRIFLE.

The memorandum reconmended the agent WIROGUE in these terms:

"He is indeed aware of the precepts of right and wrong, but if he is given an assignment,

which may be morally wrong in the eyes of the world, but necessary because his case officer

ordered him to carry it out, then it is right, and he will dutifully undertake appropriate

action for its execution without pangs of conscience. In a word, he can rationalize all

In the conclusion to the I.G. Report of 196T, the following action alternatives

were considered:

1. "Try to silence those who are talking or might later talk."(128)

2.

"Plausibly deny that we plotted with gangster elements to assassinate Castro"

(131)

3. "State or imply that it (CIAl was merely an instrument of policy" (132)

In this case each of the alternatives was rejected. But the format seems to

indicate that such alternatives are considered frequently by the CIA in dealing

with the disclosure or potential disclosure of a covert operation.

Referring to the White House rcquests for establishing

an Executive Action program, Bissell said:

"What they

contemplated is action that

would be conducted through

the

clandestine service in the regular channel. What they

meant by an Executive Action capability, of course, embraced

a great deal more than assassination.

It embraced means of

discrediting a political leader, possibly means of physically

incapacitating him, but without permanent injury, possibly

assassination as last resort." (p. 57).

Bissell indicated, however, that this was not said directly

to him in those terms and was an assumption on his part

Bissell

remembers assigning William Harvey the task of developing

the Executive Action program, but he does not remember the

that the requests might have come from Bundy (p. 49) or

Walt Rostow (p. 51).

Bissell does not deny the truth of

never went

that far.

refined and in many respects more sentative because most agencies are not equipped

Note: Check this quote against the original document. It

is important, to locate the document referred to as "the first

recorded approval" for ZR/RIFLE in order to determine whether

the White House requests for the establishment of an assassina-

KUBARK

Man. 36,1961

OCCURRENCE: Marvey was asked about notes written by him and Silver from their

meeting in January of 1961, concerning Executive Action. One portion of the notes

stated,

"Be within KUBARK, one focal point for control, search, training, case

officering, etc. -- GDP authority in this focal point mandatory. DCI officially

advised?" (57)

Harvey testified that he did not know whether the DCI was advised

that he had been asked to create a capability for Executive Action and had taken

certain steps to have an assessment of assets in that connection. (57)

clarified that the wording of the memo probably meant that consideration should be

given to the question of how, whether and under what circumstances the DCI should be

officially advised of his program, "I want to make it clear that this in no way

means he should be advised.

He should not be advised, he should never be advised,

he should always be advised." (59).

In response to the increasing requirements for the operational procurement of foreign

code and cipher materials, division A in 1960 began spotting of agent assets as a

develoymental activity. During the same period requirements from NSA became more

refined and in many respects more sentative because most agencies are not equipped

to conduct this type of operation, and because of the desirability to completely centralize

control over this entire effort, it was determined that division d which was the closest

touch with NSA on procurement requirements, could best conduct the activity. The spotting

activity has now advanced far enough to justify removing from the OOA category. (exhibit

Harvey testified that his notes didnot cite assassination or assassination capability as

an objective of project Zrriffle. However, assassination was a contemplated purpose of the

project. If an agent had been recruited for assassination he would have been recruited

under the cover of obtaining code and cipher materials. (49)
