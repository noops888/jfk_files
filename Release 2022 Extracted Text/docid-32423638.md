From: National Archives and Records Administration

Subject: "Pending Resolution" Records in the JFK Assassination Records Collection

To: The File

This memorandum briefly summarizes the status of records in the President John F. Kennedy

Assassination Records Collection (JFK Collection) that are "pending resolution."

Since 2018, the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) has identified 79 records

in the JFK Collection that are "pending resolution" and attempted to resolve their "pending"

status. A list of the records, identified by their unique JFK Record Identification Form (RIF)

numbers, is available on NARA'S JFK website at www.archives.gov/research/jfk/rif-numbers.

Each of these records was postponed by NARA pending their resolution.

Extensive searches within NARA's holdings and communications with other Federal agencies

have located copies of or administratively resolved the "pending" status of 51 records. Records

with a current status of "located" or "located administrative record" are posted on the web page

under their respective RIF numbers.

As of December 2022, the status of 28 records remains "not located." NARA has not sought

postponement of these records in 2022. Posted documentation for each currently "not located"

record consists of the RIF cover sheet and an explanatory administrative memorandum. As

NARA locates additional records, we will post them under their respective RIF numbers at

www.archives.gov/research/jfk/rit-numbers.

The table below identifies the RIF numbers of the "not located" records as of December 2022:
