against Fidel Castro's Cuba pees fragmenting Ats governing

=>q@- On 3 April 1963 a set of spurious documents falsely

ascribed to a disaffected CIA agent in Mexico were passed
a CIA controlled asset} to the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City.

The documents made it apparent that the Cuban Vice Minister of

Defense, a highly placed and violent Moscow-line Communist who
had been in Moscow when the missile build-up was planned in

early 1962, was actually a CIA agent who had betrayed the build-up.

It was believed that such a revelation would throw a great
strain on the relations of the Cuban Communist Party (then known
as the PSP] with the other partners in that coalition. “It was
also felt that the operation would redound against the USSR
because the Vice Minister of Defense was a.senior member of
the Moscow-line. PSP. It was calculated that the USSR would
move to defend the Vice Minister, who was probably their chief
agent in.the Cuban. government, and that a “collision between. the
Soviets and Cuhans could result. The Cubans accepted the spurious
papers and paid for them per our demand.
@.b-Through the summer of 1963 several. further deliveries
of spurious documents were made to the Cubans and several
thousand dollars were received in payment. But results of the
operation from inside Cuba were not yet observed. Therefore
on 13 November 1963 when a delivery of. documents was again
being made several were included revealing the presence of another
"CIA agent" in the Cuban government, this time inside the Cuban
Embassy in Mexico. This target was Teresa Proenza Proenza,
long-time Cuban Communist and contact of the Soviet intelligence
SWE wore Close cocbect Thy Lee Mehr De Seu fee
in Mexico, who was acting as Cuban Cultural Attache. “On 10 December
1963 Miss. Proenza was informed of her sudden transfer back to
Cuba; she actually departed on 23. January 1964. It was apparent
that her recall was connected with the spurious documents and
her known long-time friendship with the Vice Minister of Defense.
Sc. The first reaction to the- operation inside Cuba occurred
in the week of 14 March 1964. At that time. a junior member of

the Communist Party (PSP) was tried and convicted of betraying
non-Communist leaders of the. resistance to the former government
of Cuba which had been overthrown by Fidel Castro. As the trial
‘wore on it became apparent that since the jung Communist had
been the protege of the Vice Minister of Defense the trial was
really a trial of the latter; another Tukachevskiy case.

#o-During 1964 deliveries of documents to the Cubans were
continued and payments received. On 18 Novenbde" the Vice Minister
of Defense was arrested on charges of treason and removed from
his post. Sof was his wife who also held cabinet rank. They
were jailed as was Teresa Proenza.

#.€» After terms in prison all three defendants were released
to house arrest. Proenza was later permitted to work asa
librarian in Havana. The Vice Minister died peacefully in his
bed several years later. His widow was allowed to leave Cuba
to reside in Spain... This phase of. the CIA operation wound
down in March 1966 when the Cubans ceased taking an interest in
it. i i

afk Concluding Remarks

The foregoing is but the barest outline of a highly
complex operational system that made use of a wide variety of
techniques and assets which have not been revealed to the public,

“USepe story would make the juiciest of headlines if it became
publicly known, especially in the present moralistic environment.
The fact that several persons were deprived of their freedom as

a result of the operation should be noted. Furthermore, this

a

operation laid the basis on which other operations of a similar
nature were successfully mounted against Cuban and other hostile
targets. In short, this file is a Pandora's box the opening

of which would not only expose the cryptonyms of other operations
of this type but would attract unfavorable publicity for the
Agency in certain quarters and would expose hitherto secret
techniques and assets. This would make theic employment in the
future very difficult. The fact that this series of operations
did not begin to register’ on the Cubans until after the death

of President Kennedy should remove any suspicion that it in”

any way goaded Castro. into assassinating our president.
