SIR


” :
1,| Dr. Charles Bohrer recommezis (subject to Howard
Osborne's concurrence) that the tvs = llewing defectors
be added to the Brezhnev visit watck list:

a, Anatoliy GOLITIYN (AEL&22E). Delusions of
* Tandeur; expected much more from zte U.S. Government than
ein fact received in terms of persczal recognition. Frus-
trated, reclusive. May take some action to "get even."

Yuri NOSSENKO (AEDONOR}. Not seriously neurotic,

: b.
cour nut because of the way in which he was handled he has reason —
to be vengeful, and may take the Brezhnev visit as an oppor-

tunity to embarrass us.



oA ry

1, Howard Osborn's recommendations for the Brezhnev
“watch list":

a. Delete NOSSENKO. He's happily rehabilitated,
well disposed toward CIA and the USG, well adjusted. Not
a threat.

b. GOLENIEWSKI, Absolutely nutty. Put him at
. the top of the list. He hates ‘the Soviet Government because
it's depriving him of the Romanov crown jewels. . .

WY ¢. Anatoliy GOLITZYN. Agree with Bohrer. Put
him on the list.
