joing to the Embassy, jowever, almost until it was closed
down. e says that on the 20th cr 21st of Necember [1960], the
last time he was in the Embassy talking to Raz Kail, he (Kail)
told him he was gx going to the United States and he would come
back and talk to him later. Kail said he was going to Texas

for Christmas. That's why he always thought Bishop xekxkxx had
told him to go to Kail because he thought ka perhaps they were
friends from Texas. :

(Do you think Bishop and Smith were friends also?) He doesn't
know. Smith was a young person, always well dressed. He's
prebty sure he was CIA.

(Smith wasn't xkx& the Ambassador?) Ohn no, he was the political
advisor. Not Earl Smith, Ewing Smith.

and talk.
[VoTsky“works out of an a office of Replica, just around the |

corner from Veciana's house. The magazine is owned by Max : 4 ()
Lesnick, Lesnick was a leader of the Second National Front

of Escambray and ‘the key link with CIA agent@y
officially a political attache in the Embassy,
Castro took over. Also in the Replica office now is Reynaldo
Pico, good friend of Artime's and one of the original
Watergate group.] .

Lesnick at Replica has urged him to talk to Volsky.

(Is Volsky working for CIA?) Volsky has always denied it.

But he was in Cuba and he was with the Voice of America.

Volsky also now receives money from Replica and AV says he
doesn't understand that, wkyx what does he do for Replica?

All he remembers Volsky ever writing for Replica was an interview
wieh the president of Portygal.

(Do you have any suspicions that Lesnick is being supported by

the CIA?) No, he doesn't believe so. Lesnick is a hard worker

and good administrator. ek

(Have you ever made any major arms deals?) No. Maybe only 20 to 50
rifles, 40 or 50 pounds of dynamite, $40-50,000 at the most.

(Ever deal with Mitchel & WerBell?) No. But he said that you're going
to ask him about Masfeerer now. (Why?) Because there was a lot

of business between Masferrer and WerBell. They say that Masferrer
was x killed as a result of his dealing with WerBell. He (AV)
personaly thought Masferrer wasn't worth anything.
