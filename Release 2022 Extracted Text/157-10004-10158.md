(Ever deal with Mitchel & WerBell?)

No. But he said that you're going

to ask him about Masfeerer now. (Why?)

Because there

was a lot

of business between Masferrer and Werbell.

They say that Masferrer

was & killed as a

result of his dealing with WerBell. He (AV)

personally thought Masferrer wasn't worth anything.
