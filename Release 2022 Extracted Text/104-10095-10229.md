About mid 1962 (check date) Ligivoy outside Mexi rept asked

for the telephone nunbers of the Soviet, Cuban, and Satellite Embassies.
With this forewarning, LIFEAT (unilateral coverage) was disconnected. However,
as I recall, the Mexicans connected 5 Cuban lines, 5 Soviet lines, 3 Czech,
2 Polish, and 1 Yugoslav line. The basehouse listening post had a live
monitor who made short summaries of interesting conversations for a daily
resume which was received each day around 8 a.m. (passed by Flick to Goodgasture
to get to Scott before 9 a.m.) Later (when the reel was completely recorded)
full transcripts were typed and passed to the Station in the same way, however,
there was usually a time lag of a day or so. Those transcripts which hdd
Russian or another language besides Spanish or English went out of the listening
post the day after the transcript (of otker conversations on the reel)was
typed. These reels were taken to another location where they were trensleted
and typed. In the case of the Russien translations, Boris Tarasoff usually ran
about a week behind the date of the conversation because of the volume of

_ Russian conversations among the xembers of the Soviet Exbassy. During this
period (fall of 1963) the reels were probably being brought into the station
and carried to Boris by one of the people from the Soviet Section or they may
have been carried to him by Flick but I think I brought the reel in and gave
it to Herbert Manell to take to Boris. Herbert Manell and his wife Berbara
handled all of the processixg of Soviet transcripts. My job involved screening

the photographs as soon as we learned that the man calling himself Oswald was

probably an Anericen, However, here again there was a backlag because the

photos were picked up three times a week but the ones

ced up were usually
for dates a few days prefiously because the doctor processed the film on a
night time basis. Photographs were made usually until one roll vas used but

the film inside the station.

I am certain that the Oswald call came to our attention from the
Soviet line. It was picked up and taken to Boris for a translation because
the caller was trying to speak Russian. Any delay was caused by waiting to
compare the photographs with the typed transcript. There were no copies of

Mexico Station Coverage of Soviet and Cuban Embassies (1963)

1. Unilateral Coverage:

From the time the Mexico Station was opened in April 1947 until
the arrival of Mr. Win Scott as Chief of Station in 1955, the Station had
developed a support apparatus to exploit leads from the Soviet Embassy in
Mexico City. This umbrella type project (LIPSTICK) consisted of multiline
phone taps, three photographic sites, a mobile surveillance team and a
mail intercept operation.

Telephone taps (LIFEAT) were placed by an employee of the local
telephone company who was handled by a Station case officer. The number
of lines tapped was limited only by the availability of a listening post
nearby and the availability of langauge (English, Spanish, Soviet, Polish,
Czech, etc.) transcribers. Generally, these were Mexican or Mexican-
American recruited agents.

Three photographic sites were handled by a Station case officer
assisted by technicians on TDY from Headquarters who advised the Station
on the best types of cameras, films, and concealment devices. These
operations had sub-crypts under project LIPSTICK (namely: LIMITED, LILYRIC
and LICALLA). LIMITED was a fixed site directly opposite the Soviet Em-
bassy (across the street) which had both a vehicle and a pedestrian en-

trance. The gate to the Soviet Embassy was on the northwest corner of the

SNe Nee cl RY anaias



Soviet compound and the LIMITED site was diagonally across a double laned
street on the southeast corner of that block. (See attached diagram).

LIMITED was the first photo base and operated strictly on an experimental
basis. in the early stages. This base, however, was closed when the Sta-

tion received word that the photograph of the “unidentified man" was

- being released by the Warren Commission. LILYRIC was an alternate photo-

graphic base. It was located in an upper story of an apartment building
onthe same side of the street as the LIMITED site but in the middle of
the block south. It had a planted view of the front gate of the Soviet
Embassy. LICALLA, the third photographic site, was located in one of a
row of four houses on the south side of the Soviet Embassy compound.
This site overlooked the back garden of the Soviet Embassy compound. The
purpose of this operation was to get good identification photographs of
Soviet personnel. The three photographic sites were managed by a re-
cruited agent who was a Mexican citizen, the son of an American mother
and Mexican father (deceased). This agent collected the film from the
LIMITED and LILYRIC sites three times a week. The film was then de-
veloped and printed into 8 x 10 contact print strips. LICALLA film was
originally processed in the Station but in early 1959, due to the resig-

nation of a technician, this film like that of LIMITED and LILYRIC was :

processed on the outside by a recruited agent.

Mobile surveillance was conducted by two American staff officers.
These two officers organized a surveillance team of six recruited agents
which used late model cars and a panel truck for surveillance. The team
could be activated by radio from the LIMITED site whenever someone of
interest left the gate of the Soviet Embassy. These agents were aware of
the LIMITED site since they had been issued LIMITED photographs for
identification purposes.

The Station also conducted a unilateral mail intercept operation,
LIBIGHT, which was handled by an American case officer. A recruited
Mexican agent, who had a semiofficial status, obtained selected letters
from a subagent employed by the Mexican postal syste.

2. Liaison Coverage:

Liaison coverage was unreliable and insecure as characterized by
the nature of the Mexican services at that time. The Mexican Direction
of Federal Security (DFS), with which we conducted liaison, was a hip-
pocket group run out of the Mexican Ministry of Government. This Ministry

was principally occupied with political investigations and control of

foreigners. Their agents were ,teasso' S=3+, and corrupt. A Station

officer trained a number of them in name tracing and travel control. . In
1958, at the instigation of a Mexican official, a joint telephone tap

operation came into existence. The operation, which became. known as



LIENVOY, was run by a Mexican officer. The listening post had 30 lines
connected at one time. The transcription room was staffed by Mexican
_ Ariny officers. In 1961, because of mismanagemént by the Mexican prin-
cipals, the Station chief, himself, became the project case officer. A
Station officer assisted him in the daily supervision of the listening
post, and in picking up the transcripts and the tapes. There was also
an American technician inside the listening post.
3. Oswald Coverage:

In mid-1962, the Mexican officer in charge of LIENVOY (the
joint tap operation) asked the American officer at the LIENVOY listening
post for the telephone numbers of the Soviet, Cuban and Satellite Em-
‘bassies in anticipation of possible coverage. The Station immediately
disconnected all of the unilateral telephone taps on these Embassies so
that they would not be discovered when the Mexicans hooked-up their
taps. The Mexicans soon thereafter connected five Cuban lines, five
Soviet lines, three Czech lines, two Polish lines, and one Yugoslav
line. At the listening post, a live monitor made short summaries of
conversations of interest which were then included in a daily resume
for the Chief of Station. Later, when a reel was completely recorded,
full transcripts were typed and passed to the Station; Honever™ there

was usually a time lag of a day or two. Reels which contained Russian



2y a language other than Spanish or English were taken to another location
for translation and typing. Mr. Boris Tarasoff did the Russian transla-
tions but because of the volume of Russian conversations, the translations
usually ran about‘a week behind the date of the conversation.

As soon as the Station learned that an Anerican identifying him-
self as Lee Oswald phoned the Soviet Embassy, Miss Ann Goodpasture of the
Station started screening all photographs. However, here again, there
was a backlog because the photographs were picked up three times a week —
but those picked up were usually for dates a few days before since the
technician who was processing the film, did so on a night-time basis.
Further, photographs were not made initially until a complete roll of
film was used. Later this was changed and the operator cleared the camera
at the end of each day regardless of amount of unused. film remaining.

The instructions were to cover the entire work day (office hours) and to
photograph all. Soviets, their families, al] foreigners, ‘and cars with
foreign licensé plates... Human error did occur but generally the agents
were conscientious. The Cuban Embassy coverage had more sophisticated

equipment using a pulse camera which frequently developed mechanical dif-

_ ficulties.

Oswald came to the attention of the listening post operators

from a tap of the Soviet line.. It was picked up and taken to Mr. Boris


Tarasoff for translation because the caller was trying to speak in Russian.
There was some delay because Station personnel waited to compare the
Photographs with the typed transcript. All transcripts were made in

either Spanish or English since the Chief of Station could read only

“these two languages and because he personally screened the transcripts

for operational leads.
