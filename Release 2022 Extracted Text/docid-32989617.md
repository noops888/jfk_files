By letter 7/ Hy to a Honorable Frank Church, ve
we noted that the Senate Select Committee had in its possession ..
certain materials, which were compiled by the Commission on ay.
CIA Activities Within the United States, for the preparation
of its report to the President, which materials most probably !
contained information regarding FBI operations of the utmost
sensitivity. In order to avoid any inadvertent compromise of
such information, we requested an opportunity to meet with
Senators Church and Tower at the earliest convenience to
discuss areas of this Bureau's activities which might warrant
special consideration. Senator Church agreed that the above
matter would be discussed with Director Kelley at the latter's
appearance before the Executive Session of the Senate Select

Committee meeting scheduled for ECB
(ea -i = 27y-4oo

For your additional information, this Bureau had
earlier ascertained that the Senate Select Committee has had
access to a 693-page document prepared by CIA listing instances
wherein CIA believed its operations may have exceeded its
mandate. A review of this document by Bureau personnel indi-
cated that some of these operations involve matters involving
this Bureau of an extremely sensitive nature. In response to
a request of CIA for copies of pertinent material contained
in the above 693-page document, CIA on this date furnished
copies of the material requested, B JUL 22 1975

In anticipation of the Director's appearanté beftre

of approximately 174 pages was reviewed, This material is 7

reservation at the hotel, The first night Kins did not

associated with the King party. The next day, Campbell and ~—
a fellow SA, John Borys, moved to a different room, He
could not reeall how the arranzements for the move were mada.

Campbell and Borys monitored King for about tvo
days, stayed one extra day at the hotel and then checked
out, Lither Campbell or Borys remained in the room at all
times, One of them vould take the logs and tapes out of
the hotel each day and turn them over to someone from UFO,
details not ceealled, At no time did Campbell ever enter any
room in the hotel that was cceupied by King or any member of
King's party, The tape sceorder they utiliged was manually

ecard at WFO showing his location. He responded that it was
the normal practice to place a card in the usual repository

In response to direct questioning, Campbell advised
that he had never seen any paper (memoranda, etc.) dealing
with this case other than the logs previously mentioned,

Epstein inquired as to whethor Campbell had ever
seen the tapes again after he hed departed the hotel, Campboll
advised that sometime later, possibly one or tvo months, he
vas asked to review the tapes and logs in an effort to obtain
additional information, He did this at the FBI Laboratory
and was assisted by SA John Matter, retired, in the technical
enhancement techniques, such as filtering. Campbell vas not
dizected to concentrate on any one part of the tapes but
veviewed all of them, He did not type any of the information
overheard and if any such typing was done, it was probably
done in the Intelligence Division. Campbell has not seen
the tapes since that tine.

On Epstein's inquiry, Campbell advised he first
heard about the planned interview of him from SA Paul V. Daly
o£ the FBI's Legal Counsel Division and did not discuss the
ting case vith Berceron, Matter or Borys after that contact.
Campbell did not kmow whether o¢ not the tapes arc still in
existence.

normal practice to erase tapes, Catiybell answered that in
this type of an investigation he was sure only new tapes vero
used, He explained he vos certain that tapos wore nev vhen
he found them still veapped in cellophane and they had the
appearance of new tapes, Sho also inquized as to how he

a At the end of the interview, Epstein indicated he_
had oné- final question which was, as best Campbell ¢ould
remembér, "Is there anything else’ about this case that you
know that has not come out because I did not ask the right
question or did not ask a question in the right ‘way? Campbell
replied that he felt. that sihanaaty had done a good deb in. -
asking the questions. : oer

iW 65360 Docld:32989617. Page 9


Epstein then stated lets get to the point. When
did you hear about the King case. I responded that some-
time early in 1964 - recalled since it was shortly after
President Kennedy was shot/and King was named man of the
year - I was summons to the SAC's office either by my
associate Bill Bergeron of my supervisor Mr. Belter not
specifically recalled. e SAC, Marlin Johnson, Assistant
Director William Sullivan, Bergeron and probably several
others not recalled were in attendance. The following is
a narrative of information I furnished in response to
Epstein's questions.

The SAC made several remarks and Assistant Director
Sullivan then stated that he did not want any information.
discussed to leave the room. Sullivan stated he had informa-
tion that’ indicated King was associating with communists and o
it was possible his movement was being infiltrated. Sullivan
said he wanted a technical installation on King in an effort
to verify this information. =

”

At some later daté I was assigned to monitor the
installation which was a radio transmitter. I could not _
recall if the equipment was signed out to me or not but I

took the equipment home and on a Sunday afternoon I caught a
bus to Union Station, I walked around for a short time and then
by cab went to the hotel and checked in under an assumed

name (name not remembered). I did not recall who made my
reservations. The first night King did not enter the room -

we were monitoring. (I did not recall the names of

individuals who occupied room but they were associated with
King party.) The next day we (John Borys of WFO and myself)
moved to a different room. I could not recall how the
arrangements for the move was made, We then monitored King

for about two days, stayed one extra day at the hotel, and
checked out. Either Borys or myself stayed in the room at

all time. One would take the logs and tapes out of the

hotel each day and turn them over to someone from WFO (details
not recalled). At no time did I ever enter any room in the
hotel that was occupied by King or any member of his party.

The tape recorder was manually operated and we attempted to
run it any time someone was in the reom. I know of no physical
or photographic surveillance on King during this time. I

had no instructions that I can recall concerning only listening
to certain types of conversation.

Epstein asked if I kept a card at the office
showing my location. I responded that it was the normal
practice to place a card in file when one was away from
the office. In this case, if I placed a card in file I
probably would place a notation like "Special - See
Supervisor Belter for contact."

I had never seen any paper, memos, etc. (other
than logs) dealing with this case. 7

Epstein asked if I ever saw the tapes again
after departing the hotel. I stated that sometime after
(possibly one or two months) I was asked to review the tapes
and logs in an effort to obtain additional information. I
did this at the FBI Laboratory and was assisted by SA John
Matter, retired, in the technical enhancement techniques -~
such as filtering. I was not directed to concentrate on
any one part of the tapes but reviewed all of the tapes.

I did not type any of the information and if it was typed
it was probably typed in the Intelligence Division. I have
not seen the tapes since that time. .

I first heard about my interview from Mr. Daly of

the Legal Division and did not discuss this case with
Mr. Bergeron, Mr. Matter or Mr. Borys after that contact.
I do not know if the tapes are still in existance.

one asked if it was the normal practice to
erase tapes. I stated that in this type investigation I
was sure only new tapes were used. I was certain the tapes
were new if they were still wrapped in cellophane and they
had the appearance of new tapes. She also asked how I got
the key for the second room at the hotel and did I have
to re-register. I stated, I did not recall but felt sure I
did not re-register and some agent from WFO probably got
the key to me. No other person entered the rooms except
Borys and myself where the monitoring was taking place.

Other responses to questions from Epstein were:
We only had one radio receiver and only listened to one
radio microphone, I could not recall if there were others.
Borys and myself took turns listening to the transmitter.
I did not remove the transmitter when I left the hotel as I
never entered any of the rooms assigned to the King party.



One final question from Epstein. Is there anything
else about this case that you know that has not come out
because I did not ask the right question or asked a question
in the right way. I advised I felt he had done a good job
in asking the questions.

Additional answers to questions. I did not
know any details concerning Mr. Sullivan's remarks about
King's association with communists. I did not attend all of
the meetings at WFO concerning the King installation. My
best recollection was that the monitoring was in rooms one
floor above the rooms occupied by King.

replying, of consulting with an FBI representative who vould
accompany him to the interview. The representative vould
not be present during tho actual intervie but would morely
be available nearby in the event consultation vas desired,

The details of the interviev, as voluntarily
furnished by Conrad, are as follows.

Conrad was interviewed in SSC quarters for the
approximate period 10:10 a.m. to 10:45 a.m., July 9, 1975,
by SSC Staff Members Michael Dpstein and Mary DeOrco. Ho
mention of Conrad's rights was rade. The following details
are not necessarily in chrorological order,

: Conrad was questioned concerning his career im the

FBI and the positions which he held. He replied that he

entered the BI in 1934 and vas assigned to the Laboratory
vhere he spent his entire FOI career. During the 1940's, he
vas placed in charge of the Radio Engineering Section (2P).
In 1955, he became the Mumber One Man, the equivalent of being
the Deputy AD in the Laboratory. In 1961, he vas elevated to
the position of AD, which he held until his retirement in
mid-1973,

Conrad vas queried as to whether the Laboratory
vas broken dowm into various sections at the time he vas AD.
He responded that there were four sections in the Laboratory:
Document, Fhysies and Chemistry, RE, and Cryptanalysis-Translation.
He vas asked as to whether the sections were further broken
dom, inte units and was asked for any such specific brealkcdowm
in the RF. His ansver vas that while there were unit breakdorna,
he did not reeall the specific breakdown within the RE. He
vas asked as to the basis for unit breakdowns and advised it
vas based upon sensitivity and expertise of the work; both
factors entered into consideration with the preater veicht placed

SEYATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

RE: ZNWWERVIEd OF FORMER FBI AD BY SSC

Conrad was told that the SSC was focusing on an
allegation that some tapes were made of a conversation of
Martin Luther King, Jr., and that these tapas were mailed
outside of the FBI, Conrad was also told that tha SSC had
baen advised that Conrad had been requested to make copies
of such tapes for the indicated purpose of mailing outside -
the FBI. Conrad was then asked what he knetr about this
matter. His ansver was that he did not know or recall
anything that would fit the deseription above. Conrad asked
Epstein if the latter could indicate a time frame which
might assist Conrad in his recall. Epstein said they vere
referring to the early 1960's, after which Conrad responded
that that vas a long time age and Conrad vas just unable to
recall anything on the allegation. Conrad vas asked 1f he
recalled making copies of a tape dealing with King without
knowing it vas for the purpose of the tapes being mailed,
His response vas "lo."

Conrad vas asked if he had mown that the FBI had
technical coverage of King. His response vas, "Wot specifically."
He was then asked what he meant by “‘speeifically" and this
peint was pressed by the interrogators. Conrad responded
that he recalled that FBI Director Hoover had announced
publicly that the FBI had in effect a number of wire taps,
thus indicating that a number of FBE subjects vho were under
investigation were thus covered through such means. However,
Conrad did not know or recall that King was actually one of
the subjects of such coverage.

Conrad was asked whether he recalled, aside from
the King case, vhether any recordings were sent to the

and he responded that, if the request was from the field,
there would normally be a cover communication vhich vould
be the permanent record. However, if the request vas from
a Headquarters official, there might not alvays be a weitten
record, He was asked how the material would get to a specific
person in the Laboratory and he responded by saying that it
might be routed directly by the sender or routed to the
Laboratory generally, and then from the central routing
point in the Laboratory it would be sent to either RE or the
speciZie person who vould handle the matter, Conrad was
asked ho a router vould know vhere to send such an item and
he responded that there would be information in the cover
commnication which vould assist in this routing.

Conrad was asked whether it vas necessary to
aecount by inventory for all tapes used in making copies of
tapes. He ansvered that it vas not so necessary because
the volume vas so small. He vas asked if he knev vhether
any record or memorandum vas made of such a request in
connection with the King case and responded that he did not
know; that he had no recollection, He was asked if it was
possible that such a written record might exist and if so,
would it not be in FBI files? He answered that he did not
think he could contribute to this question as almost anything
is possible, He added, however, that he had no knovledge or
vecotlection of such a record or any knowledge of its
existence in FBI files,

He was then asked if he had ever heard of mailings
of tapes involving King. He replied that he had seen something
in a newspaper within the past year or tye Indicating such
an allegation, His recollection vas that the nevs acequnt
vas of a copy of a tape being mailed to Mrs. King, and that
Mrs, King had denied receiving same.

As No.

Q: tthen you monitored in other matters, tras it not
customary to know the agent to whom a case was
assigned? If so, would you not then relate a
conversation overheard to that agent?

A: In the normal course of events, this would be true,
and the agent to whom the matter was assigned would
be so advised if the overheard conversation was
urgent in nature. In the matter of Dr, KING, however,
I did not know the agent to whom the case was assigned.

Q: tthen you completed this monitoring, to whom did you
give your logs?

As I do not recall; normal procedure would have been to
give them to my immediate supervisor, Mr. BELTER.

Q: Getting back to the hotel, did you and Mr. CAMPBELL
leave together?

Ai I do not recall. In all probability, we did,

Q@: Did you carry the tapes and notes back to the office?

we both may have. If I did carry them, I normally
would have turned them over to the custody of

Dote of transcription O-18-75

Mr. Paul Wallach, staff member of the Uvited States Senate
Select Committee cn intelligence Activities, telephonizally contacted me on
6-18-75 between 2:20 and 3 o'cluck P,M., and inquired as to the status of a
request hy the Committee concerning mail cover information. He asked if T
: could furnish him a time when he raight expect our response to be delivered
to him. He pointed out that he had had previous discussions with me and
f Mr, Shaheen of the Dep concerning this matiex, and Mr, Shaheen”
: had indicated to him that he could expec responseto have been given to
‘ him by this time. y. Waljach was informed that a tine certain for
deliv of a response concerning this request could rot be given, and it
was explained to him that a vast amount of material ws being reviewed
pursuant to request of the 3 e Select Committee amt other commitiees of
Congress and that because of ihe amount of werk invoived in all these requests
it was net possible to make a jadgment as to the date ci the response,

H | Mr. Wallach i ed he felt he had been nisied by Mr. Shaheen
into believing that he would have a responsé to his reqrest and that he was
going to recontact Mr, Shaheen. He made a general irquiry as to whether one
Agent might be gathering all the information and as to whether he might be
allowed to come to FBI Headquarters and review what tas been gathered to
this point. He was informed that all disclosures have “o receive proper
Bureau approval ana that it would not be possible for h'm to review such
information in the absence of such approval. He askedif the Bureau could
separate the response hy making available immediatels portions of the mail
cover lists such as the identities of*people who were tle targets of mail :
covers in the domestic field. He again was informed tiat this was not
possible in the absence of proper approval. Mr. Wallash stated that he
wanted me to know that he was in possession of a list ¢d Bureau mail covers
for the past five years which he had been furnished by 1 source whom he did
not identify, He was asked (1) if this list concerned th: mail covers in the
4 : national security areas and, (2) was it a national list. Mr, Wallach stated it
was a national list in the national security areas. He gated he was not sure

SUBJECT

Telecon with Paul Wallach of the Senate Select erie aye
Committee - June 18, 1975 - 4:20 p.m. :

i Paul Wallach called + O'Connor, but r took the call. Wallach
stated that his call to O'Connor was to express his personal
concern over O'Connor's questioning his (Wallach's) professional
ethics in an earlier telephone conversation with John Elliff of

: SSC staff. Wallach expressed the hope that Schwarz's conversation .

~ with O'Connor in which Schwarz categorically disclaimed that Wallach
had made certain specific representations (to Paul Daly of the FBI
earlier, would put to rest all of O'Connor's goncerns vis-d-vis
Wallach. (O'Connor's concerns were aroused by my report to him of
a Wallach call at about 3:00 p.m. to Daly in which Daly stated that
Wallach claimed that he (Wallach) "had the NSC mail covers going
back five years" and had received same with mames listed from a
source that Wallach refused to disclose. ‘Daly further reported i
that Wallach stated that unless the Bureau was not inmediately

‘ forthcoming with the SSC's request for the NSC mail covers, he

(Wallach) would use the ones in his possessian.) I told Wallach

This memorandum records the results of a meeting Sher 9

7/2/75, a

Mr. Paul V. Daly, Legal Counsel Division, and
Section Chief William 0. Cregar of the Intelligence Division mL
met in the office of the Deputy Attorney General on the ie
morning of 7/2/75, Also present at the meeting were the
Deputy Attorney General and Messrs. K. William O'Connor,
Kevin Maroney, Michael Shaheen and Robert McDermott, all of
the Department of Justice, The purpose of the meeting was 4

to discuss three specific matters the first being the draft*s
Letter dated 6/25/75 to the Attorney General from Senators #f
(Church and Tower (see memorandum Wannall to Adams captione
as above dated 6/30/75). The second matter discussed was ;
the Task Force concept, The third item was a review by FBI
regarding the Rockefeller Commission files (these files

constitute 12 legal FiT@"draws"ofdocuments as well as

approximately 40,000 pages of testimony) fo 2 _ Ib BIE 3F7

LETTER TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL DATED 6/25/75 ann <2 =
REG! ath

A review of this letter was set out in the memorandum

Wannall to Adams dated 6/30/75. The Deputy Attorney General

found considerable difficulty in understanding paragraph 2 of

the 6/25/75 letter pointing out that neither the Department of

Justice nor the FBI had entered into any agreement. In view

of the ambiguities the Deputy Attorney General found in the

letter as well as the lack of any specific agreement entered into with

the Senate Select Committee (SSC) by the Department and/or the FBI,

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall
Re: Senstudy 75
62-116395

: the Deputy Attorney General instructed that the Department
prepare a letter over the Attorney General's signature
asking, for clarification of the 6/25/75 letter as well as
: raising the question of any agreement entered into by the
" . Department or the FBI,

5 TASK FORCE CONCEPT ‘

The Task Force concept is designed to identify
various abuses which the SSC desires to investigate in-depth.
A member of the intelligence community would be identified
to the Executive Branch as a Task Force leader. The purpose
would be to permit that Task Force leader to be completely’
knowledgeable on all available information throughout the
intelligence community for a particular abuse. In other
words, the White House could look to the Task Force leader
as the one person in the intelligence community who would be
privy to all information regarding a particular abuse. The
Deputy Attorney General had no problem with this concept but
did insist that the Task Force leaders should not negotiate
directly with their counterparts on the SSC on behalf of
the ‘intelligencé community for any particular abuse (the
White House has insisted on this). The Deputy Attorney General
instructed Mr. O'Connor to make this quite clear to
Me, James A, Wilderotter, Associate Counsel to the President,
and if Wilderotter insisted on unilateral negotiations between
Task Force leaders and the SSC, Wilderotter should be referred
to the Deputy Attorney General in order to resolve this issue,

THE ROCKEFELLER COMMISSION FILES

As. you know, the President has ordered that copies
of the Rockefeller Commission files including testimony be
turned over to the SSC. There has been no third agency
coordination on the part of CIA regarding what information
was turned over to the Rockefeller Commission, As a result

Memorandum to Mr, W. R. Wannall
Re: Senstudy 75
62-116395

of the above, we are not aware what sensitive information
‘involvirg the FBI has been furnished to the Rockefeller
Commission by CIA.

The Criminal Division of the Department has received
copies of the entire Rockefeller Commission file plus testimony.
The Deputy Attorney General has ruled that these files and
testimony cannot be .turned over to the FBI in toto until
such time as the Criminal Division has ruled on any possible
eviminal culpability on the part of the FBI, To faciliate
the review of the Rockefeller paeseaiae files, the Griminal
Division will separate out any informdlion it feels involves
any FBI criminal culpability. That portion separated out
will be the subject of di cussion between ths Deputy Actor put vy Attomey
Genstel and the Dinector. The remaining portion of the

key elier files will then be turned over to the FBI for
review to determine if any of the information contained therein
could possibly jeopardize sensitive ongoing investigations

or adversely affect the security and welfare of FBI sources
mentioned therein,

The Legal Counsel Division is preparing a letter
alerting the SSC to the possibility that sensitive information
may be contained in the Rockefeller files and requesting that
Senators Church and Tower consider a briefing by FBI officials —
regarding those sensitive areas of concern to the FBI which
may be embodied in the Rockefeller Commission files.
