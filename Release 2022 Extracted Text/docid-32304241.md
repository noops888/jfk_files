unsatisfactory for interview.

The interviewing agents were

were utilized.

However, all rooms had glass panes

and, therefore,

the subject and interviewing agents were visible

to passers-by.

The interviews were disrupted on 30 to 40 occasions

by different inmates who were curious as to what

was happening

and who peered through the glass panes, apparently in an effort:

to identify the subject whom they probably regarded as a "stool

pigeon."

Moreover, Iragments of the interviews unquestionably

coula be heard by inmates standing and loitering outside the

doors of the interview rooms.

This made the subject highly

On 2/5/69, the subject was openly hostile and

maintained that he had already repeated the whole true story

several times to INS, CREC and the FBI. In the interview

3. NYO is well aware of the Bureau's position with

regard to polygraph testing and appreciates the Bureau's

reluctance to rely upon its use in the average case. However,

the subject of this case became affiliated with Cuban G-2 soon

after it was formed in 1959, he was afforded extensive training

and he entered the US under

the guise of an escaped refugee

carrying $4,000 given to him by Cuban G-2 to carry out the

assassination of MANOLO RAY, an anti-castro leader in Puerto Rico.

Subject has also admitted travelling to Mexico City in 1967 and

then receiving Irom Cuban G-2 the assignment to assassinate

FELIPE RIVERO, another anti-Castro leader. Obviously this is a

very unusual case with numerous ramifications, and NYO feels

every available tool should be employed to resolve the securiti

Ispects of this case which may very well involve other Cubar

Intelligence agents Whose identities are still unknown.

Althoägh subject has disclosed considerable information

concerning his own affilialtion with Cuban G-2 the professes not

to know other Cuban agents currently involved in activities in

indication that the subject, if not ringleader, may well be a

Therefore, NYO requests the Bureau to authorize a

polygraph test for subject and asks that the most serious

consideration be given this request. If approved, NYO would

attempt to obtain more favorable circumstances for the

polygraph test.
