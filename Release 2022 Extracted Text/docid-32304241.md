Subject was interviewed on 2/5 and 7/69, after
signing rights waiver form on both dates at. the Federal
Correctional Institution, Danbury, Conn., by SAS JOSEPH T.
CORRIGAN and FRANCIS I. LUNDQUIST. Conditions were very
unsatisfactory for interview. The interviewing agents were
afforded the use of three rooms for the interviews, all of which
were utilized. However, all rooms had glass panes on the doors
q and, therefore, the subject and interviewing agents were visible
} to passerstpy. The interviews were disrupted on 30 to 40 occasions,
by different inmates who were curious as to what was happening’
and who peered through the glass panes,apparently in an effort. “_._
to identify the subject whom they probably regarded as a "stool”
pigeon." Moreover, fragments of the interviews unquestionably
could be heard by inmates standing and loitering outside the
doors of the interview rooms. This made the subject highly y
nervous and interferred with his concentration. Gj) :

On 2/5/69, the subject was openly hostile and 7\
maintained that:ine had already repeated the whole true story ae
several times to INS, CREC and the FBI, In the interview ; J
conducted 2/5/69, the interviewing agents stressed the small f

‘
NYO is of the opinion that information the subject

furnished on 2/7/69, is essentially true regarding his affiliation

with Cuban G-2 beginning in 1959, his code name, his training and

‘his assignments to assassinate MANOLO RAY and FELIPE RIVERO.

complete story concerning his intelligence activities in the c a) ’)

Ifthe original source, {MIGUEL ROCHE,] is telling the
truth, then of course the subject is lying whefi he says he has
not been involved in Cuban G-2 activities since he returned
from Mexico inthe Spring of 1967. | NYO is inclined to believe
this is the case but found this position extremely difficult to

es ring, the interview and at the same time protect the sources,

var though the subject was unable to recall the

3. NYO is ewell aware of the Bureau's position with
regard to polygraph testing and appreciates the Burea
reluctance to rely upon its use in the average case, offowever,
the subject of this case became affiliated with Cuban G-2 soon
after it was formed in 1959, he was afforded extensive training :
and he entered the US under the guise of an escaped refugee ‘
carrying $4,000 given to him by Cuban G-2 to carry out the :
assassination of MANOLO RAY,=an anti-Castro leader in Puerto Rico. 1
Subject has. also.admitted travelling to Mexico City in 1967 and
then receiving from Cuban G-2 the assignment to assassinate
FELIPE RIVERO, another anti-Castro leader. KObviously this is a 1

Therefore, NYO requests the Bureau to authorize a

consideration be given this request. If approved, NYO would
attempt to obtain more favorable circumstances for the
polygraph test. This might result in subject's disc. ure of
