As a former military officer, Subject ‘is hard working and abundant ty
sticere in his efforts, to fight Communism, His performance since Aug 1961
has not been at the Lop level ef his capabilities for several reasons
not all of which are within his ability to overcere. Subject has had
little clandestine training, and is therefore not aiwa ble to compre-
hend the intangible factors which prevent, delay and 1 operations.

further reason is the absence of military law as a ts for discipline
orig men, Still another reason ig the directive for only limited
eee eth which he has had to Live since August. This is merely to say
tit dn-a.period of policy formation when the action forces have had to
be held th Limbo, he has not been at his best.

Subject's dealings; with his agents have in tura been affected by his
own Trustrations. His inability to rationalize situations has resulted
in obtuse explanations to them which have made: them harder to handle.
His reluctance to’ put things on paper has detracted. from his performance
and denied him the clarifying process which reporting provides. His
Security consciousness has been similarly affected by hig frustrations.

Subject is in need of training in tradecraft asd PM opcrations. His
basic qualifications for PM Case Officer work are such that he can,with
training, doa much better Job, ‘This combined with a program of concen=
trated action would undoubtediy bring out the best in him, which should
be of real value to the Agency.

DUM FOR THE RECORD

Grayston L, Lynch

Me. Lynch's rnemorandum to

Director of Personnel, dated
22 June 1971.

On the basis of what I can recall from the time I waa.
with the Bay of Pigs activity and ray years with WH
Division thereafter, Mr. Lynch han stated his tasks correctly,

connec!

2, Since the issue is whether Me, Lynch's scevicu in Miami
could be cxseidered equivalent to that of an Operations Ofticor over-
seas, the following might be convidered:

Mz, Linch had to operate clandestinely,

atts ppeudonyme, sulesites for meetings,

¢ handled, trained and dispatened agents. He
deied them, He worked with thern side by side,

He worked long, irregular hours (days and nights)

uncer unusual pressures and at personally inconvenient
and unappealing sites,

least,

+ Lynch was, during the Bay of Pigs period at
in real personal danger. (Our case officers abroad

né nor do they have to display

do not often face such situati
such courage.)



mmary, Mr. Lynch's tasks were professionally
those of many of our
pply clandestine techniques

3 In
and personally more demanding tha

Operations Officers abroad. He had to
and concepts in a highly volatile and difficult operational climate.

To admit him to the CIA Retirement System seems justified,



SECRET

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Personnel
SUBIECT + Inclusion in CIARDS - Grayson L. Lynch

i. Mr. Lynch's meaorandum dated 22 June 1971 requesting
that service at JMWAVE be considered as qualifying service
under CIARDS has been reviewed by individuals familiar with KK
big activities during the period noted. They stute that his
memorandum is factual aod accurately ropresents the situation
as it existed at JKWAVE,

2. The servico described is considerod couparable to
that performed overseas. WH Division concurs in favorable
action on his request should that be the recommendation of

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Perso:

SUBJECT ¢ Recommendation for proval of

Mr, Grayston L. Basa Participant

in the CIA Retiremen: and Disability System
REFERENCE : HR 20-50

1, It ie strongly recommended that Wz. Grayston L, Lynch
be approved as a participant in the CLA Retirement and Disability
Systern,

2, It is the opinion of the Special Opezations Division that
the duties performed by Mr. Lynch from the time he entered on duty
in February 1961 until carly 1968 meet the spicit and intent of the
criteria for qualifying service! as detin IR 20-50b, The lone
exception to these criteria is that Mr. Lynch was not "abroad"
during the time involved except on a sporadic basis, This exception,
however, was due completely to the geograpiical location of the area
of operations, This location made it uniquely propitious to have
Mr. Lynch assigned to and work out of a downstic base, There is
no question, however, that Mr. Lynch's service, was in the conduct
and support of covert operations which required continuing practice
of security and tradecraft procedures and w included, from
time to time, hazards to his life and health, it is also believed
that Mr: Lynch would be at a disadvantage in cbtaining other employ-
ment because of the sensitivity of his past serrice as well aa the
dearth of requirements for his peculiar backgzound, skills and

knowledge.

3. On the basis of the above and Mr. Lynch's unique per=
sonal record, it is believed that his service 2:cing the described
period is certainly equivalent to if not in excess of the requirements
for "creditable service abroad" and that if it Zid not been for a
geographical accident, this service would has been performed as



spon00

part of an assignment abroad within the fullest meaning of the definis
tion contained in the referent regulation, Therefore, approval of
Mr, Lynch's request for desig: nag a participant in the CLARDS
on the basis of vervice performed between 196) and 1968 io not only
strongly recorirmended but is requested as the grant of an entitlement
fully carned by a very deserving employee.

at hore during the four days of the invasion ateenpt and,from direct
instructions from the DCL en| in Serics of covert landings and opera-
tiene into Cuba for several days following the invazion landing. For this

J approximately June i968. During this peria articipated in

srous claniestipy activitien including agent training, parachute training,
weayons training, west planned and directed MS actual operations into Cuba,

In the course of these carlier operational «assignments, Mr. Lynch
ken developed.a psychosis which will not permit w travel by air at

This has resulted in a medical hold being placed on Mrw Lynch

Lynch has made application for retirement effects

In view of Mr. Lynch's age, xpecialized skills, ling tervice ina uniquely
ve area, and peculiar contribution to the Agency's mission it is
that a termination bonus at the time of his retirement is fully
warranted,

Mr. Lynch is currently the equivalent of a GS-14, step 5 with an
annus! salary of $23,591. The proposed $10,000 termination bonus represents
therefore, less than 42% of his annual salary or approximately 5 months
pay. 1p connection with this, it should be noted th were being termina-
ted rether than retiring, he would be entitled by vie of the provisions of
his contract to 90 days notice which would equa uximately $6,000 at
his current rate of pay in salary alone. Additions é. benefits would
increase this figure, :

relative inexperience in the Meritine Branch, I reconaend
that only one quarter man yesr be devoted to the Mictorical
Progiza in calendar years 1970-71. If and when officers

ice this-task snd a subsequent increase in man years
able will bo.nace,

2. I-nontinate Mr. Grayston L. ‘Lynch to vrite his-
tories in CY 1970-71, Tuls officer combines the unique
knowleccge of first hand operational oxperionce with: the

MEMORANDUM FOR : Irving C. DEVUONO

SUBJECT + Letter of Instruction

1, This memorandum is to confirm your appointment as Chief,

AMLILAC and to provide you with instructions for the direction of
that group,

2. The mission ts to adapt current assets into a force
which can enter the targot area by sea or air to conduct recon=
naissance, caching, sabotage, raids and/or guerrilla warfare
support operations. f

3. The organizational concept to be followed is that of
small teams which can function independently or in combination
and entirely under indigcnous leadership, All personnel should
be fully qualified in basic paramilitary skills and should be
Physically and mentally prepared to mount operations on short
notice. Airborne capabilities will be developed when facilities
necessary for training become. available,

“x. 4. The standards for members of the group should be con-
stahtly upgraded by culling.of members who become marginal or who
do not develop as expected. Recruitment uf promising now members
will bo dependent on the needs of the station based on policy
directives. Priority should be given to sabotage training to
permit the mounting of a sabotage. program at the carliest possible
moment. Coincidentally, planning and thought should be given to
the ‘topics of cover, recruitment, training and establishment of
those facilities necessary for a‘ rapid expansion of the group if

a full scale operational program should be developed. Also, the
force should be identified to the primary exile authority as a

non political and independent body which is unilaterally engaged
in the overthrow of the existing regime, The tempo of training
should be maintained at a level sufficient to assure the continual
proficiency of the group in all categories of activity in readiness
for the order to mount a full scale program with all teams parti-

cipating simultaneously. Readiness will not itself be justifica-
tion for operations,



SECRET
-2-

5. Your staff must be organized to permit close contact
with team members so ag"to assure control over them and at the
same time provide full security for the existence of your organi-
zation. It must also provide security for the planning of all
activities in such a way as to assure the compartmentation of
staff and team personnel associated with the different categories
of operational activity.

G. The following guide lines are provided for thu organi-
zation:

a. The size and military nature of the force
require that the highest possible standard of security
be maintained for all personnel and activities. Speci-
fieally, the scope should not be comprehended by team
nembers, and compartmentation by teams should be
practiced to the maximum, ~

b. Should, 1£ possible, be composed of men who
have no dependents.

7. Tho following tasks should be undertaken immoediatoly:

a. Continue development of cover for all
personnel, their absences, injuries, deaths.

b. Continue the development of concepts to.
provide for training, during active and tnactive
periods, transportation to training and staging
areas and safehouse utilization,

c. Continue to devise procedures for handling and
storage of classified material, arms and equipment.

d. Establish standards for recruitmont, disciplino,
chain of command and security.

“Allowance: You will be entitled to: (a) living quarters allow-

may be provided quarters by ‘your cover facility or the government :
and, in Such event, you will not be entitled to the living quarters

mentary post allowance; transfer allowance, a basic service H
transfer allowance, an education allowance, and a separation :
allowance."

2. It appears clear to the writer that any housing allowance
which applies to staffers also applies to tho writer. This would
then necessarily have to commence at the same time for both types
in order to be equal.

3. It is requested the writers’ housing allowance be timed

SUBJECT: Fitness Report, Devuono

1. The subject report being cue, the writer is the

only person observing DEVUONO's werk and has statements

and commendations which should be reflected in his fitness
report. The contents of this memorandum will be established

in DEVUONO's file in other form at iater date by the writer.

2. DEVUONO has completed one year with CUSOG, In this
feriod he has shown a complete an: actical knowledge of
paramilitary techniques and tac This knowledge is born
of experience and applicaticn, His application of this
knowledge for KUBARK has resulted
technical abilities of CUSOG pers:

3. He has shared CUSOS responsibilities of organization,
administration and operational preparation in a manner to
follow out KUBARK practices to its credit.

4, He carries out clear instructions to the letter,
reflecting a military background.

S. Contrary to observances ncted in a previous fitness
report DEVUONO has been found to be anythin but naive in
his dealings with PSRUMENS during the period observed,

6. His administrative and acccunting procedures within
CUSOG are in order.

7, Hesitating to call them weaknesses, the writer must
state that DEVUONO's entire experience with KUSARK has been
field experience, usually far out a long string of contacts
into a KUBARK installation, a fact which has prevented a look
at any of the administrative side of paramilitary as conducted

by KUBARK.

8. This man has good potential for helping KUBARK'S
paramilitary effort, which potential will. be more effective
when:he has been schooled in the terminologies and peculari-
ties of paramilitary KUBARK-style. It is recon:ended a tour

-by’ DEVUONO where such schooling can be conducted us on-the-

job training would most bring out this potential.

A furthor reason 19 tho absence of military law as o basis for discipline

that in a period of policy. formation whon the action forcus have had to
