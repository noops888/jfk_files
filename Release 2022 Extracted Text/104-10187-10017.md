“An increase in the hours of both the photographie ard physical. surveillance

hours) during the weekdays and to have the LRITED base provide
Photographie and physical surveillance coverese fron 1605-1036 hours

oa weekdays end from, 0920-1369 hours on.weekends, These changes were
dictated by the following considerations:

1," The'siew LIMCUSIIE building offers a auch better vantage point
for both photocraphic and physienl, surveillance then does the
present. complex which houses the LILYRIC and LEI72D bases,
Therefore, tho Station felt that the: personnel occupying this

and e-reviston of working hours was indicated

‘2. Decause tt was apparent. that the coverage of tie LIGRICK
installation would be a lonz-renge cad continuing requiresent,

tue Station desired to nteff the new bese with personal of long- -

range potential. LER@TY-6, now alacst 60 years old, does not
possess thia potential; however, the LILYRIC agent conplex
happily coabines experienced ‘persontel with youthAl agents.

nel is. such aore coxpatible ‘end consistent with the en-
vironzent of the new building than is that of the LDGTED fesily.
