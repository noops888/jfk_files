Review of Project LIEMPTY |

(For the Purpose of Project Renewal) 7 . |

IL CURRENT OBJECTIVES AND PRODUCTION

A. Oliver G. SCANTLING Segment (discussed in relation to project
objectives):

1, "To collect operational information pertaining to LIMERICK
personnel and physical facilities,"' SCANTLING has continued (See the
last two Project Reviews forwarded as attachments to HMMA-14093,

13 November 1959, and HMMA-15979, 18 November 1960) to provide
worthwhile information pertaining to this objective,

a, During the past year SCANTLING has continued to be
used to follow up leads produced by LIENVOY.. For example,
operational information recently indicated that the LIMERICK
target was using the services of a Mexico City firm to repair
safes, Through discreet investigation SCANTLING was able to
identify the firm, its location and the name of the owner in the
event that we later wished to make an approach to him or to
exploit this information in another manner.

b, SCANTLING is still the Station’s primary source for
keeping current records on the residences.of the many LIMERICK
personnel in Mexico City. This is accomplished in several ways;
the most important being SCANTLING's follow up of all LIENVOY
leads which indicate the LIMERICK people are interested in |
renting a given piece of property, (See previous project. renewal |
request for additional details).

2, "To collect operational information pertaining to other targets
of opportunity, foreign official installations and personnel of intelligence
interest operating in Mexico," SCANTLING is very useful for collecting i
information on other Station targets:

- i
SECRET // = |
., i

a
'



14-00000

SECRET ASR
-2-

a, On the basis of a request to the Station from the
ODACID Chief, SCANTLING was sént to Puebla to be an
eyewitness to the 4 June 1961-Catholic inspired anti-CASTRO
demonstrations, Not only did SCANTLING obtain the desired.
information, and samples of many of the leaflets used, but he i
prepared his report for the Station in time for the COS to give
the ODACID Chief a briefing at 1000 hrs., 5 June 1961;
SCANTLING does an excellent job on this type of assignment
“due principally to his ability to observe and report objectively.

b. SCANTLING was instrumental in establishing that
Fernando LLANES Cavero and his wife were living at a local
Mexico City address, This case has been of considerable
counterespionage interest to Headquarters.

¢, SCANTLING has continued his contributions to the
Paul Frederick KIRSCHHOFF case by periodic interviews with
the subject's neighbors and associates, |

3. "To exploit operational leads through recruitments, debriefings,

and surveillances, "" SCANTLING has contributed to this objective both 1
directly and indirectly as will be noted by the examples listed below: \
|

a,’ SCANTLING devoted a lot of time to the i
surveillance and attempted recruitment of Abel ARTEAGA, a H
Mexican national employed at the Cuban Embassy, SCANTLING |
talked with ARTEAGA several times and undoubtedly was
primarily responsible for the later success of the recruitment
made by another Station agent.

b, Some additional time was devoted to the Cesar |
GONZALEZ Sanchez case in February 1961 when SCANTLING
determined that. GONZALEZ was still in Mexico City. See
the last renewal for additional details on this case.

> -'-¢y*In-connectton with the above objective SCANTLING *
has performed numerous pretext and neighborhood investigations i
for the Station, SCANTLING also does most of the local
investigations requested by ODACID and other ODYOKE i
components, |

SECRET/5S5@K

d, .SCANTLING spent six weeks during July and
August of this year giving tradecraft and surveillance
training to LIPAILS 5 and 7 from Monterrey. Although
this is not a direct contribution to the above objective, it
is considered sufficiently related to mention here.

4, In addition to his contributions to the above objectives,
SCANTLING is used for miscellaneous support requirements from the
Station. For example, SCANTLING is now handling LIEMBROIL-2 and
will continue to do so until the return of LIMOTOR-14 in June 1962, Also,
during the past project year, SCANTLING handled the LIRICE surveillance
team until July 1961 when Simon D, CLACKETT (ps) returned to Mexico
City. SCANTLING is also used to spot and rent safe houses and apartments
for other Station operations,

5. As stated in the preceeding Requests for Project Renewal,
although SCANTLING's LIEMPTY Project objectives can never be completely
fulfilled, it is the Station's opinion that SCANTLING has made important and
valuable contributions to LIEMPTY Project objectives specifically and to
other Station activities in general. SCANTLING's production, measured
against monetary expenditures, case officer time and other intangible factors,
unquestionably justifies his continuation as an integral part of Project
LIEMPTY.

B, Raymond H, GERENDE Segment (discussed in relation to project

objectives) :

1, "To collect operational information pertaining to LIMERICK
personnel and physical facilities through use of photographic base houses, "
‘Three photographic bases, LIMITED, LILYRIC and LICALLA, contribute
to this objective. To avoid repetition, the Station is omitting the usual
description of the functions of these three bases and how they contribute
to the above objective, There has been no change in the coverage as
described in the 1960 Request for Project Renewal,

2, "To collect operational information and identify operational
leads pertaining to Station targets of opportunity."' The LIENTRAP
operation, handled by GERENDE, is still the major contributor to this

“4.

objective. In addition to performing numerous photographic assignments
in support of other Station operations, LIENTRAP devoted nearly four
months, on.a fulltime basis, to coverage of the LIERODE operation. . For
several weeks the entire "take" from the LIERODE target was récorded ~
from the LIENTRAP vehicle, Later, the LIENTRAP agents operated the
LIERODE technical gear from the initial LIERODE stationary base.

3. "To provide operational support to Station operations, i.e. ,
rent hotel rooms and apartments, and conduct counter-surveillances,"
GERENDE is used frequently to rent hotel rooms and apartments for other
Station operations and activities, GERENDE's comprehensive area
knowledge and personal operational capabilities combine to make him an
extremely valuable Station asset for such support activities. GERENDE.
also procures and services post office box letter drops for the many
Station operations requiring them.

4. The quality and quantity of operational information produced
by the photographic bases and other activities under GERENDE's control
and supervision is considered worthwhile. The Station concludes, therefore,
that this segment of the LIEMPTY Project should be continued,

C. Relationship to Related Mission Directive Objectives:

As stated in the previous project renewal, it can readily be noted
that Project LIEMPTY has provided support to many Station operations and
in this manner has been a contributing factor to the furthereance of the
Related Mission Directive. The project has not produced any positive
intelligence nor has it been intended that it should do so, The project's sole
purpose is to provide a mechanism for the development of operational
information in support of other Station operations.

CHANGES

‘There have been no changes in the LIEMPTY Project during the past project

year except that SCANTLING relinquished control of the LIRICE (formerly LIJERSEY)
surveillance team inJily 1961 in accordance with previous plans,

Tl, © EFFECTIVENESS

There has been no change in Project LIEMPTY which would alter the
validity of the remarks made ‘in Section III of last year's project renewal request,

WV. PROBLEMS

The security problem in connection with the LICALLA operation, which
was described in last year's renewal request, is still present but has not caused
any known difficulty. At Headquarters suggestion in HMMW-9736, the LICALLA
base was reactivated on 29 May 1961. The base operator has been cautioned to be
ever alert for any unusual incidents which might indicate that the base has been
compromised,. This is the only problem experienced by the LIEMPTY: Project
during the past project year.

Vv. PLANS

‘The Station considers that the project is now operating at its optimum size
and does not plan to expand it during the coming year, Rather, ‘efforts will be
devoted to refining and better utilizing the existing project organizational
arrangements.

Vi COSTS

A. Past Project Year - Station finance records indicate that Project LIEMPTY
‘expended $21, 458,00 during Fiscal Year 1961 (1 December 1960 - 30 June 1961) and
has thus far during Fiscal Year 1962 (through 30 September 1961) expended about
$11,000.00, It is anticipated that about $8, 000.00 will be expended during the last
two months (October and November 1961) of the project year. . This will make a
total expenditure during the project year of about $40,500.00, or some $12, 500.00
under the budget estimate of $53, 000.00.

B, Ensuing Period - Of the total $49, 500. 00 budget, itemized below,
$29, 500,00 should be expended duzing the it

»= balance; $20,000.00 should be éxporded di Fiscal Year 1963 Normal acco
procedures will be used for all expenditures,

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief of Operations, DD/P
SUBJECT : Project LIEMPTY (Renewal)
WH - Mexico City

1. ‘the attached project, originating in WH Division,
is presented for renewal for the period 1 December 1960
through 30 November 1961. ‘The project provides for physi-
cal and photographic surveillance operations in support
and exploitation of other Mexico City Station operations,
particularly those targetted at Soviet personnel and in-
stallations.

2. Authority is requested to obligate $53,000 from
the DD/P-WH Division budget: $31,900 in fiscal year 1961,
and $21,100 in fiscal year 1962, subject to the availabil-
ity of funds. The amount includes $38,000 compensation |
for two principal agents, one clerical support agent on an
hourly basis, and eleven surveillance and support agents;
$7,000 operational expenses (safehouse procurement, post
office boxes, rented automobiles, purchase of information,
vehicle maintenance, and operational travel); $2,500 re-
placement, repair and maintenance of photographic equip-
ment; and $5,500 basehouse rental, utilities, and mainte-
nance.

3. The field's renewal request, supported by a cover-
ing memorandum of the Division, sets forth accomplishments
of the project in the past year in terms of objectives and
estimates effectiveness. It is noted that one principal
agent, Simon D. CLACKETT (p), resigned in October 1960, and
the four-man surveillance team previously handled by him
will be transferred to project LITEMPO, consequently being
omitted from LIEMPTY in this renewal. Three basehouses con-
tinue to be operated under the project: (a) LIMITED, which
compiles daily logs on arrivals and departures from the
LIMERICK installation, together with attendance lists of
LIMERICK employees, and handles the radio dispatch of the
LIEMBRACE surveillance team on LIMERICK personnel and targets

ae
i)

of opportunity. This basehouse also provides photographic
coverage, concentrated on visitors. (b) LILYRIC which pro-
vides clandestine photographs particularly of visitors to,
as well as employees of, the LIMERICK installation, prepares
weekly reports on LIMERICK employees and their wives, and
reports on license numbers of all cars visiting the instal-
lation. (c) LICALLA, which concentrates on photographic
coverage of LIMERICK employees and their families, as well
as providing observation on the apparent positions and jobs
of the target employees, and as well as personnel changes.
Additional photographic coverage is provided by the mobile
LIENTRAP vehicle. Principal agent Raymond H. GERENDE (p)
continues to coordinate basehouse activities; principal
agent Oliver G. SCANTLING (p) continues to be an independent
asset used to follow-up and exploit operational information
on target personnel and installations, to case various in-
stallations of interest, to acquire property, etc. SCANTLING
has managed the surveillance team being transferred to
LITEMPO in the interim following the resignation of CLACKETT.
The Station notes that activities at the LICALLA basehouse
were suspended in September 1960 as the result of the ar-
rest of a knowledgeable TSD technician in another area and
it is not known precisely when it will be possible to re-
sume these operations. The Station believes that the
GERENDE segment is now operating under optimum arrangements
and SCANTLING will soon be relieved from his interim respon-
sibility for the surveillance team being transferred to
LITEMPO and can concentrate more on his investigative and
casing activities. It is not planned in the coming year to
expand project activities,

4, Appropriate Special Staff components concur in rec-
ommending renewal. FI Staff notes the Division's assurance
that the transfer of the unilateral surveillance team to
LITEMPO will not affect its independent status, and remarks
that the current project review presents a clearer picture
of the usefulness of the several segments than the previous
one. 7
