MEMORANDUM FOR: Anthony A. Lapham

FROM : A. R. Cinquegrana
Office of General Counsel

SUBJECT : BLUEBIRD/ARTICHOKE Soft File Review - "Kelly" —
Dimitrov, D.A.

1, Lhave been reviewing summary sheets prepared by the Office of
Security concerning several hundred soft files on individuals associated,
or considered for association, in some way with the Agency's BLUEBIRD/
ARTICHOKE activities. In the course of that review I came upon the follow-
ing case which I discussed with Dick Lansdale and which we agreed should
be brought to your attention for your information and whatever action you
may deem appropriate.

2. As is indicated in the attached copy of the soft file summary and
the 27 January 1952 memorandum upon which it is based, D. A. Dimitrov,
designated "Kelly," is a Bulgarian expatriate who appears to have been
imprisoned in Greece some time in 1950 and 1951 on false pretenses because
the Agency feared he would accept an offer from French Intelligence. After
six months in custody, he was flown to Panama where he was misrepresented
as a psychopath and confined in a U.S. Military Hospital for several months.
The official security file shows he was then removed from the hospital and
held by the Agency at Fort Clayton in Panama for three years. He was then
returned to Greece and ultimately allowed to enter the U.S. as a refugee.

It appears from the attached copy of a 7 February 1952 memorandum that
the "Artichoke approach," i.e., the use of drugs to reverse his hostility
toward the U.S. and U.S. intelligence agencies, was never consummated.

3. This man has had several contacts with the Agency since coming
to the U.S. In 1961 an Assistant to the DCI was contacted by a representative
of Parade magazine who had been informed by Dimitrov of his confinement
by the Agency. The Office of Security responded to the effect that this man
was disreputable, unreliable, and full of wild stories about CIA.’ As you
will note from the attached transcript of an 8 September interview on Good

Morning America, Mr. Dimitrov (now General Dimitrov and known as General

Donald A. Donaldson) apparently is alive and alleging that he knows who
ordered the assassination of President Kennedy.



4. Based solely upon the soft file summary, and prior to reviewing
the official security file from which I extracted the additional details, it
appeared to me that the nature of the Agency's treatment of Dimitrov might
be something which should be brought to the attention of appropriate
officials both within and outside the Agency. The fact that he is still
active and is making allegations connected with the Kennedy assassination
may add yet another dimension to this story.

. Soft File Summary

Title of File: Kelly

Brief Biographic Data: Kelly's true name is
DIMITROV, a 29-year-old Bulgarian who was head of
a small political party based in Greece and
ostensibly working for Bulgarian independence.

Nature of Relationship/Interest: It was learned
that French Intelligence. Service was attempting

to bribe KELLY and make him.a double agent and
Kelly appeared to be interested in the French offers.
Accordingly, a plan was made to have KELLY believe
that he was going to be assassinated and for protec-
tion he was placed in custody of the Greek police
who then put him in prison. KELLY was held in. the
prison for six months until the Greek authorities
decided that KELLY was was a nuisance and they told
our people to take him back. - He was then flown to
Panama where; through arrangement, he was placed in
a.U. S. military hospital as a psychopathic patient.
According to the 25 January 1952 memorandum, KELLY

had been in the hospital for several months and the ee
hospital authorities want him out since he is causing
problems. He is not a’ psychopathic personality. : —

Because of his confinement in a Greek prison and his
stay in a military hospital, KELLY became very hostile
toward the United States and our intelligence opera-

tions in particular.

OPC was considering an "ARTICHOKE" approach to KELLY
to see if it would be possible to reorient KELLY
favorably toward us. However, OPC advised on

2 February 1952 that some opposition had arisen in
the top level of OPC to the handling of the KELLY
case in the manner that had been proposed. Since
this opposition had arisen, nothing would be done

to the KELLY case.

Short Summary of Agency Interest/Use:

The file was opened in October 1950, when DIMITROV
was of operational interest to the Agency while
employed for Radio Athens in Greece. Previously,
DIMITROV had fled from Bulgaria in July 1947. As
of October 1951, DIMITROV was in a hospital in
South America, ‘apparently under Agency. auspices.
In 1956 DIMITROV was brought to the United States,

‘apparently after returning to Athens from South

America, and the Agency made no further operational
use of DIMITROV. In June 1960 DIMITROV [under case
#33259--Dimiter DIMITROFF ("Diko")] had contact
with the Contact Division outlining his background,
Claiming financial difficulties, and requesting the
Agency back his plans for covert activity against
Bulgaria. The Agency apparently took no action in
this regard. During this contact DIMITROV claimed
that circa 1951 he was held.in a hospital/cell in
Panama City.

Kelly Case

On Friday, 25 Jamary 1952, tke writer was called to the office
of Mr. Bannerman for the purposa of a Retail with one Mr. Prichstt, ~
B5/oPC, concerning tha instant case.

‘Mrs: Prichett explained in substances the Kelly case aa follows:
Kelly, (whose real name is Dimitrov), is a 29-year-old Bulgarian and

-. Was tha head of a small political party based in Greece and ostensivaly
Working for Bulgarian independance. Kelly was deseribed by Prichett ae

as being young, ambitious, bright (elementary collegs education), a
sort of a "man-on-a-horss" type but a typical Balkan politician. .Ac-

. cording to Prichett, our people discovered that French Intelligenca

Service HSxF attempting to bribe Kelly and make him a dovble agent and

Kelly was looking with favor upon the French offers. According: ee ; ee

plot was riggsd in which Kelly was told ‘ha was going to be
ard as a "protaction”, he was placed in custody of the Greek Police
who threw Kelly into a Greek prison. Kelly was held in the Greek pri-

“, gon for six months until the Gresk authorities decided that Kelly was -
. & nuisance and they told our people to take hin back. Since our

people were unabla to dispose of Kelly in Greece, they flew hin to
Panama where, through arrangemant, he was placed in a U.S. Military
Hospital as a psychopathic patient. Kelly now has been in ths U.S..
military hospital for several months and the hospital authorities now
want to get him out since he is causing considerable trouble, bothering

Fad other patients, atc. Kelly is not a psychopathic personality.

Prichett explained that they can dispose of Kelly by. the simple
process of sending him to a friend of his in Caracas, Venszuela, ‘and
as far as they are concerned, that.type of disposal is perfectly o.k.
However, because of his confinement in a Greek prison and his stay in
amilitary hospital, Kelly has become very hostile toward ths United
States and our intelligence operations in particular. Hence, OFC is

-considering an "Artichoke" approach to Kelly to see if it would be

possible to re-orient Kelly favorably toward us. This operation, which
will necessarily involve the use of drugs is being considered by OPC.
with a possibility that Dr. Ecke and Mike Gladych will carry out the
operation presumably at the military hospital in Panamas,Also in-
volved in this would be a Bulgarian interpreter who is a consultant

to this Agency since neither Ecks nor Gladych speak Bulgarian. ..

Mr. Bannerman pointed ont to Prichett that this types of pacer pe
could only be carried out with the authorization of Security and that,
under no circumstances whatsoever, could anyone but an authorized M.D.
administer drugs to any subject of this Agency of any type. Bannerman
pointed out that there was a strong possibility that the military

winctsz would be Zorwardsd to our people in Panama directing. then to
find out whether the Army would permit suck an operation ard whether ~ a

medical facilities, etd. as would be required for this type of operation.)

While the technique that Ecke and Gladych are considering for use
in this case is not knom to the writer, the writer beliaves the appreach
will be mada through tha standard narco-hypnosis techniqua. “Re-conditioning
and re-orienting an individual in such a matter, in ths opinion of-thke
writer, cannot be accomplishsad easily and will require a great deal of
time and the + fact that an interpreter is necessary in the case cow-

: . Plicates it considerably more. It is also believed that with our present

knowledge, we would have no absolute guarantee that the subject in this

case would maintain a positive friendly attitnde toward us even though -

there is apparently a successful response to the treatment. The writer

did not suggest. to Prichett that perhaps a total amnesia could be created

by a series of electro shocks, but merely indicated that amnasiad under arto
drugz treatments were not certain. ‘ : i
