MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Planning for JMATE Activities

|
1. Mr, Esterline, C/WH/OPS, ‘stated 8 June 1961 that the Special
Group had met on that date and, in addition to the Nicaraguan paper, had
considered the paper prepared by Branch 4 on 7 June, entitled: Policy

Decisions Required for Agency Relationships with the CRC and Giher
ial Group wae to negotiate

Cuban Exile Groups, The decision of the Speci:
ct back to the Group later,

this matter with State and bring the subje

2, Mr, Esterline’stated that he had discussed this matter with Mr,
Bissell who would like to have by next Monday night, 12 June, a re-write
of the paper of 7 June, Mr. Esterline discussed the re-write at some
length. Basically what Mv, Bissel! apparently wante is a memorandum
forwarding three or perhaps four individual memoranda covering the
same throe subjects which we presented before plus perhaps Swan Island,
Mr. Bissell wants it spelled out more clearly why a major part or all of
the support to the respective activities must be overt. In the event that
we consider, which we probably should, all the pros and cona in thid
matter, we should spell out who the funds come from, the delicate point
of if the funds comio from the Agency, should the Agency then have a re-
view reaponsibility over the Department of State in ita distribution of
said funds, On the other hand, if we do not have a review function, then
we must be, in writing, relieved of responsibility once we have turned
over said funds. This, of course, will bring out the basic inconsistency

in the Agency's being involved,

3. Mr. Bissell said that he had looked at our budget again and was
not satisfied with it, and accordingly it would have to be rewritten -- his
main objection being that he does not want the items for support of the CRC
and related entities mentioned in the preceding paragraph included in said
budget. “He also commented that in our presentation, presumably referring
to the presentation of paragraph 2 above of the budget of the CRC, he did
not want a breakdown of FRD items, but rather one whole budget for the cRC,

4. Mr. Bissell also apparently informed Mr, Esterline and Colonel

King that the proposal to move from JMGAPE to an adjoining area along-
-Side JMRIM had been disapproved because of the strong opposition of the
Office of Communications and the Central Cover Group, Accordingly,
Mr. Esterline is now willing to go along with the recommendation we.”
made last week and which was approved in writing by ‘Colonel King that
a team be sent out as soon as Possible to the Florida area to attempt to
assess the problem and find a new suitable location or locations,

5. Mr. Esterline stated that there had also been some discusgions
with Mr, Bissell and Colone) King on maritime assets and that they would
like to have as soon as can be prepared a paper on the subject of maritime
activities, including the financial and any other Pertinent aspects , and
activating of the -85-foot craft which had previously been discussed with
the PM people. Mr. Esterline stated that he would also like to have a
Paper on the subject of possible sabotage school sites and factora affecting

the reopening of Randolph,

6. Comment: It is abundantly clear that, for Political reasons, the
Special Group is.not prepared to make any decision on the CRC matter wey
and this re-write job is strictly busy work, Accordingly, no significant
changes in our previous position seem to be indicated.
