2022 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992

SEORET

9 June 1961

MEMORAN DUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Planning for JMATE Activities

i. Mr. Estorline, C/WH/OPS, stated 8 June 1961 that the Speckal

Group had met on that date and, in addition to the Nicaraguan paper, had

considered the paper prepared by Branch 4 on 7 June, entitled: Policy

Decisions Reguired for Agency Relationships with the CRC and Other

Cuban Exile Groups.

The decision of the Special Group was to negotiato

this matter with State and bring the subject back to the Group later.

Mr. Esterline stated that he had discussed this matter with Mr.

Bissell who would like to havo by next Monday night, 12 June, a re-write

of the papor of 7 June. Mr. Esterline discussed the re-write at some

langth. Basically what Mi. Bissell apparently wants is Ã  memorandum

forwarding three or perhaps four individual memoranda covering the

Bame throe subjects which we presented before plus perhaps Swan Island,

Mr. Bissell wants it spelled out more clearly why a major part or all of

In the event that

we consider; which we probably should, all the pros and cons in this

matter, we should spell out who the funds come from, the delicate point

of if the funds como from the Agency, should the Agency then have a re-

view responsibility over the Department of State in ite distribution of

said funds. On the other hand, if we do not have a revicw function, then

we must be, in writing, relieved of responsibility once we have turned

over said funds. This, of course, will bring out the basic inconsistency

in the Agency's being involved.

3. Mr. Bissell said that he had looked at our budget again and was

not satisfied with it, and accordingly it would have to be rewritten -- his

main objection being that he does not want the items for support of the CRC

and related entities mentioned in the preceding paragraph included in said

budget. He also commented thai in our presentation, presumably referring

to the presentation of paragraph 2 above of the budget of the CRC, he did

not want a breakdown of FRD items, but rather one whole budget for the CRC.

4. Mr. Bissell also apparently informed Mr. Esterline and Colonel

King that the proposal to move from IMGAPE to an adjoining arca along-

side JMRIM had been disapproved because of the strong opposition of the

Office of Communications and the Central Cover Group. Accordingly,.

Mr. Esterline is now willing to go along with the recommendation we

made last week and which was approved in writing by Colonel King that

a team be sent out as soon as possible to the Flurida area to attempt to

assess the problem and find a new suitable location or locations.

5. Mr. Estorline stated that there had also been some discussions

with Mr. Bisscll and Colonel King on maritime assets and that they would

like to have as soon as can be prepared a paper on the subject of maritime

activities, including the financial and any

other pertinent aspects, and

activating of the 85-foot craft which had previnasly been discussed with

#the PM people. Mr. Esterline

stated that he would also like to have a

paper on the subject of possible sabotage school sites and factors affecting

the reopening of Randolph.

6. Cominent:

It is abundantly clear that, for political reasons, the

Special Group is not prepared to make any decision un the CRC matter

and this re-write job is strictly busy work. Accordingly, no significant

changes in our previous position scem to be indicated.
