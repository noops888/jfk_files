. sibility of governing; the solid victory of Frei in the 1964

presidential, election was followed by an even more impressive

, ; »showing in the’ March 1965 congressional election. However, the

>. Party's réform program is being implenepted with less than
deliberate speed, no progress has been made in weakening

Marxist leadership domination of the urban labor force, and

indications ate that Frei's moderation will be increasingly

challenged by the left wing of the PDC. :

: b. ‘The COPEL Party of Venezuela has strong hopes of
E cuplicating the victory of the Chilean Party in 1968 and
appears to have narrowed the gap between itself (22 percent
of the ciectorate in 1963) and the governing Accion Democratica
‘arty (32 percent). COPEL Secretary General Rafael Caldera,

one of the few Latin American CD leaders of international
stature, is expected to be the Party's standard beaver in his

fourth try for the presidency.

c. In El Salvador, the PDC garnered 29 percent of the
votes in tha March 1966 legislative election and one of its
leaders, Jose Napoleon Duarte, retained the mayoralty of San
Salvador. In less than six years the PDC has become the
leading opposition party. It has little chance of capturing
the. presidency in 1967, but should be a strong contender by
1972, with Notre Dame-educdted Mayor Duarte the likely

candidate. ’

d, The Peruvian PDC formed a coalition with. the Popular
Actica (AP) Party in 1963; it currently holds two cabinet
positions. Soze would argue that the Peruvian CD (with only
4 percent of the votes in 1963) has no real future in compe-
tition with the dominant AP and.the long-established APRA,
both reformist parties, and thus should not be included in a
Listing of significant CD parties. Some weight is added to
this arguzent by the very recent split off of a dissident
fection of the PDC into a separate party. However, the
inclusion of the Peruvian party here is based primarily on the
foct that it is the only CD group participating in a coalition
governzent and thus contributes an element of stability to the

political scene in Peru.

3. Parties of Moderate Potential, Applying even the most
generous Criteria to the Judgeseat of. potential, there are ‘not
more than four CD parties == in the Dominican Republic, Panama, -
Brazil,and Guateajla -- that might develop as s moderately. important
* forces over the next five years.. ° :

Bo
wi &. The Dominican PRSC stands as. a prime example of
: CD irresponsibility from the time Caonabo Javier took over
Paity leadership in the wake of the Dominican Revolution in
a, SAPTLL.1965,-It has‘ collaborated with the entire spectrum of
. ©“ Maexistslining parties, and moderation of ite extreme”
rilitancy in the near future’ appears unlikely. The PRSC has
-devélozed a small but talented cadre of leadership, primarily
fron'the university ranks , and is buttressed by the strongest

“QLASC affiliate (CASC) in the Hemisphere.

i be “thie ‘Panamanian PDC was registered some five years
ago snd polled only’3.1 percent of the votes in 1964. Although
it ccntinues 4 miniscule party, it has made significant
Orgenizational strides and its philosophy of. social justice
gives it roots lacking by most Panamanian parties, which are
larsely pérsonalistic or tied to financial interests. “If the
Panena CD-succeeds in expanding its middle-class base and
“attracts militants ‘froa-the predominantly negro and mestizo
population, it could become a force of some importance,

¢. While the Brazilian PDC polled a mere 4 percent of
“the vote in 1964, the Party has significant strength in three
sey, states of the Center-South (Parana,’Sao Paulo, and
Gusenabsra). Like all other pre-Castello Branco political
parties, the PDC was unable to campaign under its own banner
in the. presidential and parlimentary elections of late 1966.
Expandéd political activity will probably be permitted after
the seating of President Costa e Silva in March 1967, but it
is expetted that the number of legally recognized political
parties will be limited, It appears likely. that the PDC will
have to merge with another party 4f it is to compete in the
legislative life of the country. If the. PDC joins with a
perty that has strength outside the present PDC atrongholds,
and the PDC cessage and mystique seta the. tone for such a new
political entity, the net result could be expanded importance
for Caristian Democracy in Brazil,

a, The Guatemalan PDC was.only recently recognized as
a legaily constituted party. This nascent group has good
steength in the youth and ‘student movement and growth
pots ial in the important campesino sector, Current direction
of the party leaves much to be desired; PDC leader Rene de
Leoa cepears honest and intdligmt . but he has little organ=
izational flair or charisma, His. leadership is being challenged
by a group of militant "Young Turks" on the left. With more
vigorous leadership and the development of middle echelon

caézes the party could develop significantly,

4, Parties of Insignificance, The remaining nine Christian

Dexceratic parties -- in Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Costa Rica,

5. Cd Stronsth in ‘Universities Ahead of Party Stréngth, As
with all political’s: groups in-Latin Averica, the vast majority of
ca party militants are drawn froa the. ranks of student appendages

active in. the local universities, .In most countries of the hémi-.
sohere, CD voting stréagth on the cacpus is much more significant
han the political strength of the parent party. A.few examples.
illustrate this: point: ‘Panama, the Party: polled 3.1 percent
of the vote. in 1964 (and"probably would poll not more. than 5
percent today), while’ its University youth got-12.8 percent in the
January’ 1966 election, ..The Dodinican PRSC received 5.4 percent of
thé vote ‘in 1962 (and its present strength could well be lower
because of internal divisions and leadership conflicts), but its
youth wing on the ¢ampus garnered 40,2 percent of the vote in
tay 1956, In-Venesucla,*COPEI polled 22 percent of the vote in
1953; its student wing on the campus of the Central University,
housvor, polled 40.2 percent of the vote in 1966, These comparitive
figures suggest soaa conclusions which are presented in Paras. 19
acd 20 below.

6. Radicalization of Youth Wings. Sevé¥al CD leaders, most
motebly Frei and Céldcra, have expressed considerable concern over
the growing. radicalization of party youth wings, That youth groups
of every political stripa assume positions to the left of their
partics is nothing new, but the situation in several CD groups has
gotten badly out of hand. In several countries only an opaque line
divides the positions assumed by CD youth groups (or important wings)
froma the stance assuzed by Marxist youth elements, “In Venezuela,
the wing of the COPEL youth headed by Marta Sosa is so "far-out"
it has camed the sobriquet "the Astronauts." Chilean President
Frei reportedly told a German Christian Democrat that his youth
wing is in danger of becoming Marxist. In Panama, the dominant
wing of the CD youth has assumed positions at least as radical as
the Communists. And in the Dominican Republic the Social Christian
group in the National University is allied with the Comounist
students.

7. Youth qenaradies to Push Parties Further Left. The great
concerm of responsible party cty leaders is that youth-input to the
perties will swell the ranks of the radical wings and push the
parties further left. Soe observers believe that the CD youth

once they participate directly in party life and cope with hard
political reality, While this is partially true, we would take
issue with this relaxed view.. Tho raw-material to be molded is

to. the evelopment of well-organized CD political parties in the.

to’cause harm'to the movecent." Few would argue thst how the CD
tovemént fares and the imaso it projects depend in not insignificant
teasure.on. the posture assuzed and progress achieved by CLASC.”
More oftcn than not, the judgement of a mass movement is based on
the worst, clement comprising it += and in this regard CLASC is
challenged only by the party ‘youth and student wings. As an
organized labor force CLASC has been a dismal faflura (with the
exception of its campesinos ara); its only impact and sole raison
up to this timo has beca.as a political action instrument
with primary appeal to the working classes, It is unlikely that
CLASC, under Maspero leadership, will mellow as do parties when
they achieve the responsibility of government,

10. CLASC Ras Maintained Posture of Independence. Despite its
"Christian label, CLASC has consistently maintained that it is not
subservient to the Christian Democratic movement or any venber
perty. The statement cannot be disputed, for while CLASC is guilty
of most of the seme aberrations as the least responsible of the'CD
parties, it invariably comits its follics independently, (often,
in fact, setting en example that is emulated by the parties), But
while CLASC can defend its claim of independence, it is also true
that CLASC does not discourage the belief that it is the chosen
labor instrument.of the Christian Democratic movement, although
this label has never been formally bestowed. i

11. Closer Ties Between CL‘SC and CD Movement Appesr Likely,
It appears likely that a cere organic participation of CLASC in CD
affairs is in the offing... A Seminar was held in Montevideo from
11 = 23 April (sponsored by the Christian Democratic Formation
Institute -- IFEDEC) for officials of CLASC who are also officers
of Christion Democratic partics, The Seminar, called fos the
specific purpose of arranging closer coordination between the CD
political moveaent and the Christian labor movement, resulted in
the signing of the "Carta ce Montevideo" on 20 April, The Act
calls for formal representation of ODCA in both tha Christian

a Coorcinating Comittee was formed -- the Comite Relscicnador ¥

CHRISTIAN GEMOCRACY: IN LATIN ANERICA

The. decisive. victory of Eduardo Frei inthe Sep-
tember -1964 Chilean presidential election led many to
hope that Christian Democracy would develop signifi-
cantly throughout Latin America, competing with Com-

i ; gical grounds and offering an alterna=
tive, democratic route to social and economic progress.

No such trend has yet developed. The Christian
Democratic movement's appeal is.to students and middle
class, a relatively small pércentage of the pepulation

‘dn most Latin American countries. -Its concepts of

‘basic social refora and the dignity of the human person
may. appeal to the workers, but they still cast their
voté on a pragmatic basis for the least objectionable
of the established parties that have an immediate chance

of governing:

The riovement's progress is likely to be hampered
by its lack of strong leaders and effective labor or-
ganizations to congete against the entrenched posi+
tions of other political movements.

Current Balance Sheet

The Christian Democratic
movement is generally agreed to
be of current political signi
cance in only four Latin American
countries--Chile, Peru, Venezuela,
and El Salvador.

.. In_only one of -these--Chile--
is the Christian Democratic Party
(PDC) the governing party. frei's
solid victory in the 1964 presi~
dential election was foltowea by
an ‘even more impressive showing
in the March 1965 congressional
election. However, the part:
reform program has run into
ficulty in the upper house of
Congress, which is still con-
trolled by the opposition; no
progress has been made in weaken-

ing Marxist domination of the
urban labor force; and-Frei's
moderation has been increasingly
challenged by the left wing of
his own party, which may capture
control in the next two or three
years,

The only other Christian
Democratic party with a claim to
a role in government is the one
in Peru. It was brought into a
pre-election coalition by the
dominant Popular Action Party
in 1963 and, although it gained
only four percent of the votes,
it holds two cabinet posts. Its
voting strength has been weakened
recently by the defection of a
dissident faction which formed a
separate Popular Christian Party.

Of duplicating the victory of the
Chilean party in 1968 and appear
to. have narrowed the gap between
their 22 percent of the. eléctor-

. ate in 1963 and the_governing

Democratic Action's 32 percent.
COPEI Secretary Géneral Rafael
Caldera, one of the few Latin
American CD leaders. of interna-
tional stature, is expected ‘to
be the party's standard’bearer -
in his fourth try for tae presi-
dency. tle has recently come out
in favor of a politically expe=
dient move to the right, thus
filling the vacuum of the center-
right of the Venezuelan political
spectrum and opening new sources
of support.

In El Salvador, the PDC
garnered 31.2 percent of the
votes in the March 1966 legisla-~
tive election’ and one of its
leaders, Jose Napoleon Duarte,
retained the mayoralty of San
Salvador. In less than six years
the PDC has become the leading
Opposition party, It has little
chance of capturing the presi-
dency in‘ 1967, but should be a
strong contender by 1972, with
Notre Dame ~ educated Mayor
Duarte the likely candidate,

Applying even the most gen-

-erous criteria to the judgment

of potential, -there are not more
than four other CD parties--in
the Dominican Republic, Panama,
Brazil, and Guatemala--that might
develop as moderately important
forces ‘over the next five years,

The Dominican Revolutionary
Social Christian Party (PRSC),

led by Coanabo Javier, has aban
Goried, at least for the time being,
the irresponsible policies it :
adopted after the April 1965 re-
volt and has moved toward the po-
litical center. The party has

madé “its opposition to the Bala-
guer.. government clear, but has

alsé indicated that.it intends to
operate’ within. bounds acceptable

to the President, The PRSC hopes
that this moderate line will in-
crease its following and enable

it to improve on the poor showing
it made in. the 1966 elections,

The party has developed a small

but talented cadre, primarily

from the university ranks.

The Panamanian ppc was req-
istered some five years ago and
polled'only 3.1 percent of the
votes in 1964. Although it con-
tinues a minuscule party, it has
made significant organizational
strides and its philosophy of
social justice gives it roots
lacked by most Panamanian parties,
which are largely personalistic
er tied to financial interests.
The POC is currently negotiating
with the mass-based Panamenista
Party of Arnulfo Arias--Panama's
largest--in hopes of forming a
coalition for the May 1968 elec-
tions. The CDs have offered to
provide the Panamenistas with
much-needed administrative skills
in return for a share of the as-
sembly seats in the next election,
A long-range goal would be to
acquire support within Arias*
party and inherit his mass fol-
lowing when he passes from the
scene.

The Brazilian PDC polled

1962, but the party had signifi-
€ant strength in three important
South-céntral states. (Parana,
Sad-Paulo, and Guanabara). Like
all other Brazilian parties, it
was abolished during a political
reorganization ufAder the Castello
Branco administration, Most of
its members then affiliated with
the progovernment ARENA party

and campaigned under its banner
in the November 1966 congressional
elections. It is unlikely that.
there will be any significant ex-
pansion in the number of politi-
cal parties--the new Brazilian
constitution sets down stringent
standards that virtually eliminate
the possibility of a repetition
of the former proliferation of
parties. The former POC has made
RO attempt to reconstitute itself,
but its former members “will prob-
ably join with. like-minded con-
gressmen to pursue policies con-
sistent with Christian Democratic

“ideology.

The Guatemalan PDC was only

recently recognized as a legally

constituted party. This group,
which is being financed by Cath-
lic sources in Germany and Bel-
gium, has some strength in the
youth and student movement and
Some growth potential among the
campesinos who make up more than
half the population. Current
direction of the party leaves much
to bedesired; its leader, Rene de
Leon, appears honest, but he has
little organizational flair or
Popular appeal. With more vigo-
rous leadership and the develop-
ment of.a middle-echelon cadre,
the party might develop signifi-
cantly--particularly if the in-
cumbent Revolutionary Party (PR)
administration fails to resolve
basic problems confronting it.

0 Foreign Disoem

The remaining nine Chris-
tian Democratic parties--in Ar-
gentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Costa
Rica, Ecuador, Mexico, Nicaragua,
Paraguay, and Uruguay--show scant
promise of developing into forces
of national importance over the
next five years. Leadership of
even modest stature exists only
in Argentina (Salvador Alende,
Horacio Sueldo) and Bolivia
(Remo di Natale).

Party Youth Wings

: As with all political groups
in Latin America, the vast major-
ity of CD party militants. coma
from-student organizations in the
local universities, In most
countries of the hemisphere, CD
voting strength on the campus is
much greater than the political
strength of the parent party,

A few examples illustrate this
point: In Panama, the party
polled 3.1 percent of the national
vote in 1964 (and probably would
poll not more than 5 percent to-~
day), but its university youth
got 12.8 percent in the January
1966 campus election and 24.4
percent in January 1967, The
Dominican PRSC received 5.4 per-
cent of the vote in 1962'(and its
present strength could well be
lower because of internal divi-
sions and leadership conflicts),
but its youth wing on the campus
garnered 40.2 percent of the

vote in May 1966. In Venezuela,
COPEI polled 22 percent of the
vote in 1963; its student wing on
the campus of Central University,
however, polled 40.2 percent of
the vote in 1966,

The great concern of respon-

students, as they progress from

the ranks of the radical wings
and push.the parties further left.
Other observers, however, expect
the "hotheads" to mellow once

can be defended. Some mellowing
is inevitable, but in the past

A major ‘influence in the
development of the Christian
Democratic movement will be the
actions and attitudes of its
labor organization, the Latin
American Confederation of Chris-
tian Trade Unionists (CLASC),

So far, as an organized force, it
has been.a dismal failure except
among the campesinos. Its only
impact and sole purpose up to
this time has been as a political
action instrument with primary
appeal to the working classes.

In this role, it hag earned a
reputation for independent action
and irresponsibility that has re-
flected negatively-on the whole
movement despite CLASC's vigorous
claims that it is not subservient
to the Christian Democratic po-
litical ledders,

that.both the CD party labor de- -

The Role’

In its 17 yeats of existence,
OBCA has not. evolved beyond a
sort.of fraternity held together
more by-negative factors such as
hostility to the’US, to capital-
ism, and to the oligarchies, than
by any basic agreement among it's
members on doctrine or principles.
Moreover, the individual parties
have made very clear that they
will fight -any. effort--whether
initiated by ODCA or by the Eu-
ropean financial backers of the
CD movement:--to impose standards

and ‘controls that will impinge
on their freedom of action.

In gencral, ODCA takes a
Slightly less hostile line on
US“ policies than that of its
membér ‘parties, This probably
results from-the influence of
its president, Rafael Caldera of
Venezuela, -Thé organization's
two vice presidents are Hector
Cornejo Chavez of Peru and Rene
De Leon of Guatemala. Tomas Reyes
Vicuna of-Chile is its secretar:
general,

Only in Central America has
there been any move toward a
more cohesive unit geared to area
problems. A smaller regional
group, the Christian Democratic
Union of Centra] America, was or-
ganized last July. . It now has
five member parties, in Guatemaia,
£1 Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica,
and Panama, and a sixth may be
formed in llonduras,

European Role and Influence

Although Latin American
Christian Democracy like the Eu-
ropean variety, has its roots in
the profoundly humanistic and
democratic ideas of the French
philosopher Jacques Maritain, it
does not contain the Europea
fascist concept of the corporate
state. The European reaction to
the growth of: Communism in the
1930s had little effect on the
Latin American COs; consequently
the Americans were moving to the
political left as. the Europeans
were moving to the right.

cbs ‘attempt, to coordinate inter-
national CD activity through an
organization they: called the New
International Team (NEI). This.
organization never, achieved any
significance because European *
influence in Latin America had
already been‘undermined by a basic
difference in political philosophy
and because the Latin American
parties had been maintaining in-
Gividial relations-with the var-
fous European groups. These ties
were strictly-on vague. ideological
grounds and for financial reasons.

The two heaviest European
contributors to the Latin Ameri-
can parties are the Institute for
International Solidarity. (IIS) and

- the International Solidarity

Foundation (FIS). Between them
they will contribute an estimated
$800,000 to. $1,000,000 to the
American CD parties and CLASC in
calendar year 1967. In addition,
it was recently reported that
the COPEI party of Venezuela will
receive $480,000 for the 1968
election from FIS.

he. IIS, under the direction
of Adolf Herkenrath, is an arm
of the West German Christian
Democratic Union with the bulk
of its budget coming directly
from the German government. It
maintains several ‘permanent rep~—
resentatives in Latin America
and supports youth and student
groups, political training insti-
tutes, and CLASC organizations.

qhe PIs, under the leader-
ship of Dr. Johannes Schauff,
operates as an arm of the European
Christian Democratic Union (ECDU),
successor to the NEI. Since.its

an

creation ‘in 1964, Germans and
Italians ‘have contributed ‘almost
its entire budget. FIS appears
to be the exclusive European
channel fer organizational support
to the Latin American parties.

Tt has assumed: this responsibility
because it, is composed of repre-
sentatives of all the European
parties. Thus the responsibility
for support to certain contro~
vergial Latin parties is watered
down and distributed among the
European CDs collectively. Fur-
thermore, a Latin American gov~
ernment or party in’ competition
with the local CDs “cannot formally
protest its funding activities

to the Gernan government.

Outlook

The modest progress made by
the Christian Democratic movement
in the past two-and a half years
suggests that its development
will be much slower and less ex~
tensive than many anticipated in
the first flush of enthusiasm
following the Frei victory.

One major problein is its
failure to reach the lower so-
cial Classes and to develop &
significant worker base. Its
strength in the universities
and its ability to compete with
Communist groups on the campus
create unfounded optimism, The
"inspirational" approach that
attracts the college student
has no congarable appeal among
the inadequately educated lower
classes.

@. The military department of the NPC set forth its views in a
document dated 29 May. This document included the following
- pointe:

a. Discontent is becoming evident because of the lack of
activity which, in turn, results from the lack of funds.
The sum rentioned is $10,090.

hE
b. Wo change in United States policy regarding “eet!
apeinst.Cuba-fromthe-t-3. is anticipated. A base of

operations outside of the United States is considered
to bé so vitally important that the military department
would be willing to operate an illegal base if the
resources were, made available.

(1) The -CADELLO I is docked across from Brito's Boat Yard
at Stock. Island, Flarida.@~ The boat is in need of
repairs on the deck and superstructure, and the instal-
lation of clectronic navigational equipment would be.
required to put it in operational condition. Current

: docking and routine maintenance costs are not being

suite paid. Efforts tojmake commercial use of this boat have
E not. been successful. Thio boast is considered ideal for

activities which might be undertaken if there were a
Bente base from which to operate, but under the present cir-

: cumstances the expense which this boat represents ig
“. not justifiable. ‘It is recommended that consideration

be given to selling the CADELLO I if an operational

. base isnot established within four months. =~. _

~.(2) The KYA-ORA7 which was donated to the MDC by a mer
: of the military department, is in drydock at Nuta's
Boat Yard in Miami. There are leaks in the hull.

(3) The LANCHA AZUL8is in need of repairs, as well as trailer.
Repairs on this boat are being given priority, and will
proceed as money becomes available.

d. Informal discussions have been held with representatives-of
~ the Directorio Revolucionario Estudiantil (DRE, Students? é

“principle” to coordinate future actions. There is no political
commitment.

At the tire of his departure, Batista told

[ inmittee thar he was going directly to Caracas,
: Tt was not until after his return that it was
dearned that he had not gone to Caracas or to Guatemala ss

he had planned. He later explained that while he was in
Puerto. Rico he telephoned his relative in Guatemala and was
informed that the latter had “failed in his efforts." Ee

Also, the amount of money requested was reduced to $10,000.

The letter, which was signed and composed by AYMOP/1 and which
was accompanied by transcripts of the speech, condemned Castro's
attack on Chilean President Eduardo Frei; requested ‘support for
Frei's position; and asked the recipients to join the struggle
tiaintained by the Cuban people to overthrow Fidel Castro and
prepare for the freedom of Cuba from Communism.

2. The youth wing of the AMMOP group, headed by AMCRIB/1,
mailed a letter to its Identity A youth contacts based on the

statements made by Identity B. Copies of both letters dre for-
warded under separate. cover.
