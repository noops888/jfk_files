I. KENNEDY's murder and its causes‘, :
A. Since the announcement of the assassination, there
have been rumors in diplomatic circles, and‘ in some of the newspapers
and radio broadcasts and various other quarters about the facts and
motives of the event and the position o€ the Dallas: authorities
toward it, etc, ra = :

Some are of the opinicn that the crime was arranged
by some radical right-wingers who had been aroused by KENNEDY's
policy which advocated racial equality, by his position toward some
of the big industrial forces, particularly steel, and by his
strategy which [Part’2] calted for a truce with the! Soviets and
for finding spheres’ of coroperation with them, Othérs believe that
the crime was set up by, the radical Commmists who oppose the policy
of peaceful coexistencé. One faction of that [group} said that the
crime was an individual act committed by a fanatic or a deranged

also reported today ¢ Judiciary Committee would in
turn request an investigation of the mtter and also discussion, of
legislation to make the murder of a President a federal crime

h would not fall under the legal jurisdiction of any state,

Cc. It is hoped that the coming investigations will reveal
the following: [Part 4] f

Was OSWALD the killer and what were his motives? If
OSWALD was not the killer, who committed the crime? Was ita
conspiracy or an individual act? Was it an American or an inter-
national conspiracy? f

The prevailing view among circles known for conser-
vatism is that it is essentiai to make a meticulous and public
investigation to forestall rumors and in order to dispel unjustified
suspicions, elevate the power of thé law and protect American honor
in the eyes of the world and history,

II. The new President and his policy: [Part 5]

The leaders of Congress from both parties and the top officials
in the government and the press and radio worked energetically
to prevent division and confusion{(A)) life to normal, after it had
almost come to a standstill, by supporting the new President and
advocating unity and working for the future, In order to restore
confidence and clarify mtters, the President hastened to announce
his domestic and foreign policy in a speech which he delivered to
Congress in joint session, with the chiefs of the diplomatic
missions and representatives of the international and American press
also present. {Part 6]

He announced that his foreign and domestic policy would be a
continuation and implementation of the policy of his predecessor:

A. From the international standpoint, he stated thit he
supported the policy of seeking peace and exploring spheres of
co-operation, even with antagonists, offering aid to emerging
nations, bolstering the Western alliance and fulfilling America's
obligations from South Viet Nam to Berlin, H& summarized his foreign

policy by saying that Americz would be ready for peace or war,

B. From the domestic standpoint, he aiso adhered to
KENNEDY’s program and urged [Part 7] Congress to hasten to enact
the racial equality bill, the tax reduction bill, the’ education law,
etc, : Af

This spéech is the first official document’ which, at least on
the surface, reveals thit the new President Mill adhere to KENNEDY’s
foreign and domestic policy, The view which’ is current in som
Western diplomatic circles is that the new President is an expert
in the metheds and the directing of American partisan policy and
that he was extraordin: his handling of the various currents
in Congress; however, [Part 8] he has not been sufficiently exper-
ienced in foreign affairs and he leans more toward the conservatives
than the liberals, Som of these éixcles have also stated som
apprehensions about him and have said that he is from the re-
caléttrant, conservative South, ead that his connection with the
oilmen in Texas is weil known’ and that his long service in the Armed
Forces Committee in the Senate has mde him closely connected with
the top men of the armed,forces, and these persons do not like
KENNEDY’s policy which advocated trying to reach an understanding
with the Rissians, Then, his friendship.with the American Ambassador
in Bonn, [Part 9] Mr, MCGHEE, who leans toward ADENAUER's views on
Moscow, might make him more inclined toward a policy of toughness,
not truce, with regard to the Communist camp.

Some Britons think it possible that KHRUSHCHEV will have no
confidence in him and that DE GAULLE may seize thé opportunity to
activate his. plans in Europe, They, therefore, advocate that
Britain take the initiative in playing a more prominent role in the
Western camp in the directing of international policy,

Nevertheless, the prevailing view here at present--if nothing
happens to force him to changee-is that he will not change KENNEDY’s
foreign policy [5G] [Part 10] nor in method and [6G] to give
assurance, He, therefore, will retain most of KENNEDY's advisers,
the most important being his number-one adviser in/international
affairs, BUNDY, Since the new President has a propensity for
domestic political affairs, they expect him to rely more on the

‘Secretary of State, Tt is well known that JOHNSON especially
abpreciates RUSK,

\Political circles here also believe that [Part 11] he will
continue the domestic policy of his predecessor, at léast until the
presidential elections, It is, therefore, (B val supposed ) that he
(B val will retain) most of his Cabinet and will enter the election
campaignon the basis of KENNEDY's program, Also, they think it
most likely that JOHNSON will be the candidate’of the Democratic
Party in the, coming presidential elections at the end of next year.
They think that the chances cf GOLDWATER, the right-wing Republican,
have iassened and that the Republicans might nominate ROCKEFELIER or
NIXON and that the latter's chances have increased, [Part 12]

It is risky to\make any predictions new about the results of
the coming presidential campaign, Nevertheless, it appears that
it will be between JOHNSON and a middle~of-the-road Republican
not a vadical rightowinger, becsuse the prevailing sentiment of
public opinion is a demand.to repair the breach and close the wound
and to raise [to higher priérity] the policy of reconciliation
atid interest in domestic affairs.

Some of Peking's supporters “in North Viet Nem, Laos and North
Korea are reiterating that KENNEDY's murder reveals a victory of
reactionary trends, It is to be noted that at present there is an
increase in the activity of the Viet Cong forces in South Viet Nam.
(Part 13] Also, the press of North Koréa and the Pathet Lao in
laos have intensified their attack on Washington, They explain the
position of Peking and its supporters [4G] that on the one hand, their
view my be represented in [the statement] that the policy of the
new President will be less flexible than that of his predecessor but,
on the other hand, perhaps the attack is a means of.testing the’ |
vigidity of the new American administration,

Some circles in Britain believe that JOHNSON is an astute
politician who is skiliful in figuring and evaluating and a con-
servative who is practiced in conducting a policy of conciliation,
(Part 14].

KHRUSHCHEV, on the surface, appears sympathetic but he hides

‘ . Per
“heart that is unyisiding,

III, The Embassy's observations:

A. KENNEDY's death has created a new situation’ America
and on the iuternational scene , the landmarks of which’: are at
present wnelear, Therefore, it appears to us that the position
which prevails fn Western and Eastern diplomatic ck Seles and in the
neutral groupis one based on watchfulness and acting with extreme
care and caution and attempting ts begin a careftl operstion to
disclose, on the * ‘one hand, the real leanings (Part 15] of the

new administration\and its method cf operati, Lon and the forces which
can influence it, while working on tha het hand to establish
friendly, constructiv p\reia tions with far as possible.

B, This has beth clear in the’ ‘contacts of MIKOYAN in
Washington and his s tatements about his government's desire to
continue the policy ef x avstanding end in the reports
of som Russian diplomats that * ‘KARI SHCHEV and JOHNSON must meet, etc.
The same attitude is to be note th the British, the French,
the Yugoslavs, etc, [Part 16] : saat ‘

Z

C, Matters will remain moldy as long as the circum
stances, mtives and forces behind KENNEDY' s death remain
undefined, Then, any basic surprise in this regard might have a
jong-range effect on domestic and external ° ‘conditions. The present
[situation] is that KENNEDY and his top aides, sensed the toughness,
and (B val despair) of the forces which opposed. their liberal,
realistic policy and, therefore, hed not concealed that from us,
something which ye had explained fully to the Ministry.

CG. tee) Despite the obvious difference in’ “the
personalities’ of KENNEDY and JOHNSON-the former was a blend
[Part 171 of ideilism, and realism, rare intelligence,. broad
knowledge ,’ (deep understanding of the developments of history
and the secrets of human psychology at its highest and lowest,
loyalty to the welfare of the world and his country and of'courage
and fidelity te the rule of reason and the bond of friendship;
also, he [1 wd GJ] drawing around him domestic and foreign policies
while JOHNSON has more of an inclination and adherence than KENNEDY

to. the dconomic sy tarprise and, theréfore,
dis\more inclined @ iParc 183 and closer to the
conservative policy and the past generation and further from the
Lek wing which is more intellectual and possesses long-range
imagination and which KENNEDY had led--despite this, ‘it is {1 wd G]
at present to mike any predictions about the final course which the
new President will follow, The prevailing view here is that there
will be no basic change in KENNEDY's policy until ‘the presidential
elections sre held-the.end of next year, Never! éheless, it depends
on the devel pent of events, [Part 19}, \

D. Signs that KENNEDY’s policy will be continued aprear
in the speech of \the new President before Congress, the statements
of top officials Here in the State Depaztaent, ghe writings of top
weiters and the retention, 80 far, cf the members of KENNEDY's
cabinet and his trop advisers and confidents in‘the White House,
the Stzte Department and other departments,

E, Then,’ the many complications domestically and exter-
nally would make any minor, change, particular lys: toward Mosgow, easy
practically but dangerous realistically. {Pare’ 20]

Since it is likely that the new President will be less (B val
able) to resist pressure than his predecessor and since, because
of his long service in domestic politics, he may by nature be more
prone to keep considerations of domestic politics in mind and to
proceed in Conformity , arith their (B val requizements) and to endeavor
to satisfy them and because his philosphy and his methods are
different from thos¢ of his predecessor, It would therefore be
to our interest until the presidential elections are held to follow
a policy which would not expose him to pressure or embarrassment so
as not to enablé our enemies to draw hin (Part 21] over to their
side, This is the essence of the matter at present, It would appear
that our opponents -will:try at the first opportunity to complicate
matters betiveen us and the new administration by exploiting: the
situation, in Yemen; or the Algerian-Moroccan dispute and our
position’ ‘toward it; or the Arab-Israeli dispute if Phey find a
Sr to raise it; etc. '

In the light of the above paragraph, it would/appear to us

at present that JOHNSON may continue the policy of his ‘predecessor
toward us. He may be encouraged to do that by thd [Part 22]
positive results achieved by the policy of his prddecessor in this
regard and by the supporters of this policy both in and outside
the government, the most important being Secretary of State RUSK
and FULBRIGHT, Uhairman of thé Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, a confidant of JOHNSON-and one of the first ones who
supported him as a ‘candidate for president in the!1960 electiuns.
