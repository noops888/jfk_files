December 8, 1995

Status of Document:

Postponed in Part

Number of releases of previously postponed information: 7

Reason for Board Action: The Review Board's decision was premised on several factors

including: (a) the significant historical interest in the document in question; (b) the

absence of evidence that the release of the information would cause harm to the United

States or to any individual.

Number of Postponements: 3

Postponements: All the postponements in this document represent Social Security numbers.

Reason for Board Action: The text is redacted because the public disclosure of the redaction could

reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, and that invasion of

privacy would be so substantial that it outweighs the public interest.

We have received Form CA-1 reporting an injury and your agency's response

to the evidence submitted. It has been determined that:

1. The facts of the injury and employment support the employee's

contention that he/she was a Federal employee who sustained

traumatic disabling injury in the performance of duty. You

should, therefore, continue his/her pay for the period of dis-

ability not to exceed 45 days.

2. The information of record is insufficient to make a decision on

the case; however, you should continue the employee's pay without

interruption.

Additional information is required as noted on the

reverse of this letter.
