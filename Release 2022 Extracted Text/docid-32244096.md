Employee: Selleck Elizabeth K.

Noncontroverted Controverted [__]

Washington, DC. 20515

We have received Form CA-1 reporting an injury and your agency's response
to the evidence submitted. It has been determined that:

1.

The facts of the injury and employment support the employee's
contention that he/she was a Federal employee who sustained a
traumatic disabling injury in the performance of duty. You
should, therefore, continue his/her pay for the period of dis-
ability not to exceed 45 days.

The information of record is insufficient to make a decision on
the case; however, you should continue the employee's pay without
interruption. Additional information is required as noted-on the
reverse of this letter.
