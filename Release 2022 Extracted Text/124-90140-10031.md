English to be able to afford a room costing $0.00 per month, a telephone

and riding lessons, plus the usual normal living expenses»

be DE CASTRO returned to Sweden, penniless, in about 1958, Ona
visit to Helsinki later that year he stated that he had not been able to
find a job in Sweden, During the course of his entire stay in Finland
for about seven years, he gave no indication why he was remaining there
for that length of time and he did not advance himself in any discernible
way. He never visited his mother in England, although he did receive a
visit from his aunt, who is also an Englishwoman,

Ce Subject never expressed any political opinions, but his entire
behavior aroused unfavorable speculation as to why he was in Finland.
