3. The very fact that A/5, & SUBARX agent, and COLUB, a known RISali,

are 'in contact with each other, has implications which warrant close scrutiny.

While it my ba a bit too early to ponder the direction GoLuBts interest could

take, (Is GOLUB siring up N/5 for recridtent, or is he falling for her, gem

Inely?) the fallowing comments are offered in the knowledge that they ase, by

with A/5, which follows the not unecmen modas operandt al a gilt, dimmers,

moviess an appeal to the intellect, language lessons, and a Ilttlo liaison

inittated through the "jilted husband" routine. All of these contacts have

revolved around A/5's apartmenty which brings up the queation of the Finish

Perhaps Costille has already satisfied himsell on this point, but Head

L. GOLUB has made provocative remarky to both N5 and Costille, including

sons pertaining to the 1/5-Costille relationship, A/5's trip to the

inbassy idta resultant inquiries instigated by Costille, and to the possibility

that A/5 was reporting on her contact with CaLus to the U.S. Enbassy.

doustedly the thought has occurred to the station that GOLUB may well have

pressions. It might be interesting to see whether after a while he turns over

the Costille contact to someche else, such as Viktor Matreyevich ZIGAL,

he has introduced Costille. In this context, it is interesting to consider the

Embassy report received as an attachment to OFHA-4067. In this report, Costillo,

says that CHALKOVSKY, ZEGAL and GOLUB seem to be maintaining the majority of

contacts with Americans. Sone time ago we at Headquarters wondered if CHALKUVSKIY

might be plaming to specialize in Americaa contacts, since he was the one who took

over the Tiffany contact.

And ZEGAL, has spent considerablo time in the united:

States, so he light be something of an American specialist, too.

5. It is difficult to say whether the following is relevant or not, but we

were interested tojad a recent Copenhagen dispatch concerning & luncheon in

volving a KuBArker and two known RIS officers. At this luncheon the suspect KGB

Rezident in Denmark alleged that one out of every three American visitors to the

USSR is a spy. Here we have the suspect Kis Residents In two Scandinavian countries

simaltaneously expressing the sams thoughts to and about Americans. We realize

that ons shouldn't try to make too much out of these coincidences, but It is worth

noting that in Dermark the RIB Rexident has subsequantly turned over the contact

with the AlS officer to an underling at the same time that COLUB is Introducing

Costille to lidal, who may, in tun, carry on the contacts. le plan to point out

this coincidence to the Copenhagen Station.

6. To get bacis to the case in points The pattern of A/5's contacts

suggests that the latter has spotted and is in the process of assessings and

coltivating A/5. It may be that GOLUB is trying to involve A/5 in a romantic re-

Lationship in which emotional control could be exercised, since lt is quite un

likely that this shrewd Intelligence operator "Iikes her for her mind". It would

also seem that the Soviets have a contiming interest in Costille and assuning

that they are aware of at least some of the Costille /5 contacts, they may have

in mind recruiting A/5 toget information on Gostille and other American targets.

GOLUE certainly appears to be trying to get A/5 on the "hooky, be it for herself

or to get information on the AIS, or both.

To Costille says he has never been seen with A/5 and that all contact with

her has been held in his apartment or car.

However, It appaars quite possible

that their meetings have been observed, if the RIS bad an inclination to do go,

and it nay well be that GOLUB is aware of the contact.. It is requested that

Costille advise Headquanters, for record purposes, as to the means of contact

employed by him and 1/5: telephone, meeting plans for a certain day of each week

or alternate days, etc.

Also, does she come unaccompanded to his apartment ee or.

does he meet her at a designated place, what is the usual hour (daylightor dark)s

duration of visit; if meeting is in his car, where do they meet, do theydrive

around, where does he drop her off? All of this could be surveilled by the Sovlets,

were so inclined.

GE standpoint it would be appropriate to discourage ary further contact

•A/5 and GOLUB.

he wight just contime to fish around for occasional items of

operational intelligence, and we see nothing to be gained from the contact.

might have anough of a sense of mission to allow herself to be egged on into a

conversation from which GOLUB nould derive more benefit than she or we. If COLUB

wants to defect, he won't need A/5's help, and he's probably too sharp, and she

¡too untutored, for us to be the winner in a contimation of this relationship.

At this point, lt is suggested that Costille himself be careful in his relations!

with COLUB and report indetail on all such contacts.

9. The REDSKIN angle concerning A/5 will be covered in a separate dispatch.
