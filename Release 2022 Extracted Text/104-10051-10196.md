pressions.’ It might be interesting to see whether after a while he turns over
the Costille contact to someone else, auch as Viktor Matveyevich ZEGAL, to whom
he hag introduced Costille. In this context, it is interesting to consider the
Eubassy report received as an attachment to OFAA-l)067, In this report, Costille,
says that CHALKOVSKIY, ZEGAL and GOLUB seem to be maintaining the majority of
contacts with Americans. Some time ago we at Headquarters wondered if CHALKOVSKIY
might be planning to specialize in American contacts, since he was the one whe took
over the Mffany contact. And ZECAL has spent considerable time in the Jnited
States, so he might be something of an American specialist, too.

5. It is difficult to say whether the following is relevant or not, but we
were interested toxread a recent Copenhagen dispatch concerning a luncheon in~
volving a KUBARKer and two known RIS officers, At this luncheon the suspect KGB.
Rezident in Denmark alleged that one out of every three American visitors to the
USSR is a spy. Here we have the suspect KGB Residents in two Scandinavian countries
simoltaneously expressing the sams thoughts to and about Americans. We realize
that one shouldn't try to make too much out of these coincidences, but it is worth
noting that in Demaark the KGB Resident has subsequently turned over the contact
with the AIS officer to an underling at the same tims that GOLUB is introducing
Costille to ZEGAL who may, in turn, carry on the contacts. We plan to piint out
this coincidence to the Copenhagen Station.

6. To get back to the cass in point: The pattern of A/5's contacts with
GOLUB suggests that the latter has spotted and is in the process of assessing, and
cultivating A/5. It may be that GOLUB is trying to involve A/5 in a romantic re~
lationship in which emotional control could be exercised, since it is quite un
Likely that this shrewd intelligence operator “likes her for her mind". It would
also seem that the Soviets have a continuing interest in Costille and assuming
that they are aware of at least some of the Costille~A/5 contacts, thsy may have
in mind recruiting 4/5 togt information on Coatille and ether American targets.
GOLUB certainly appears to be trying to get A/S on the “hook!', be it for herself
or toget information on the ATS, or both.

7. Costille says he hag never been seen with A/5 and that all contact with
har has been held in his apartment or car. However, it appeare quite possible
that their meetings have been observed, if the RIS had an inclination to do so,
and it may well. be that GOLUB is aware of the contact. It is requested that
Costille advise Headquasters, for record purposes, as to the means of contact
employed by him and 4/5: telephone, meeting plans for a certain day ofeach weck
or alternate days, etc. Also, does she come unaccompanied to his apartment efor’
does he met her at a designated place, what is the usual hour (daylightor dark),
guration of visit; if meeting is in his car, where do they meet, do theydrive
around, where does he drop her off? All of this could be surveilled by the Soviets,
Af they were so inclined,

8, If our suspicion is correct that GOLUB has A/S and Costille tabbed, from a
CE standpoint it would be appropriate to .discourage any further contact between
«4/5 and GOLUB. He might just contime to fish around for occasional items of
‘operational intelligence, and we see nothing to be gained from the contact. A/S
might have enough of a sense of mission to allow herself to be egged on into a
conversation from which GOLUB would derive more benefit than she or we, If GOLUB
cwants to defect, he won't need A/S's help, and he's probably too sharp, and she
too untutored, for us to be the winner in a continuation of this relationship,
st this point, it is suggested that Costille himself be careful in his relations’:
arith GOLUB and report indetail on all such contacts.

9. The REDSKIN angle concerning 4/5 will be covered in a separate dispatch.
