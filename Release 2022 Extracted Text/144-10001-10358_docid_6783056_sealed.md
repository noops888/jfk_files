I attended ail the ceremonies, the ptocession, the mass, the
burial, the reception by the KENNEDY famtly, and the reception by
the President, I saw the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs
from Tunisia, who assured me that Tunistia will send us an acknowledge-
ment to our request for recognition, but he is not able to give
an approximate date, He will remain in New York to attend [a
meeting of] the Security Council. Therefore, I asked BAHI LADGHAM,
the number two man to President BOURGUIBA, to accelerate [matters].
He promised me to take care of it when he returns to Tunis, which
will be ina few days, I have also asked WAHLEN, Head of the Swiss
Department for Policy, which is the same as the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs, who also promised me to-see about an acknowledgement of
receipt if this has not yet been dene.

At the customary presentaticn President DE CAULLE asked me
£ things were improving in oir country, I told him they were
etting better, .
