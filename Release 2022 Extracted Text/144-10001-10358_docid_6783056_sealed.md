SUMMARY OF ACTIVITIES IN UNITED STATES

FR Washington: TRAN CHANH THANH

TO Saigon: SECRETAE

Msg NI: 106 / TU/SVBAME

I attended all the ceremonies, the ptocession, the mass, the

burial, the reception by the KENNEDY family, and the reception by

the President.

I saw the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs

from Tunisia, who assured me that Tunisia will send us an acknowledge-

ment to our request for recognition, but he is not able to give

an approximate date.

He will remain in New York to attend [a

meeting of the Security Council. Therefore, I asked BAHI LADGHAM,

the number two man to President BOURGUIBA, to accelerate (matters].

he promised me to take case of it when he returns to Tunis, which

will be in a rew days. I have also asked WAHLEN, Head of the Swiss

Department for Policy, which is the same as the

• Ministry of Foreign

Affairs, who also promised me to see about an acknowledgement of

receipt if this has not yet been done.

At the customary presentation President DE GAULLE asked me

It things were improving in air country. I told him they were

getting better.
