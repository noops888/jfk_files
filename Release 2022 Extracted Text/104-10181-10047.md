individuals suld be reported to USAREUR Intelligence suthar!tles.

The nethod of nuthentication employe? in both cases involved sonza

broadcast at a certain time over the Group of Soviet Forces,

Germeni (G3FO) radio facilities. The phraseology und contents •

indicated that the letter. had been prepered by the same agency and

possibly written by the same person.

The sinilsrity to earlier

approach letters, tentstirely identified as having been written by

the Cornittee for State Securlty (KGB), suggests that the KGB was

also involved in these uperations.

"The lead on the cirilion employee apparently was provided by

USAREUR Intelligence jeector Vlad inir SLOBODA, who deserted la

August 1960 and snucht asylum in the USSR. The initlal telepbove
