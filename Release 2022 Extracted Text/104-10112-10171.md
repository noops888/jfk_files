the Agency was completely covert.

During the late

1950's, he developed personal relationship with Che

Guevera, Fidel Castro and other Cuban revolutionaries.

The Subject's knowledge of those Cuban leaders became

a matter of public record in newspapers, periodicals

and so forth at that time.

the Subject's Agency affiliation was never disclosed

publicly.

Following his employment termination, the

Subject obtained

a job in the Office of the Postal

Inspector, U. S.

Post Office Department, Washington,

D. C. That is his current employment.

representative of the 20th Century Fox

Movie Firm

Guevera.

discuss the following two matters to him: -

how much and how well the Subject

habits, and so forth;

b. what contribution the Subject could

make with regard to the promotion and marketing

of the

film.

any further information attributable to the Agency.

In that connection, the Subject explained that the

reason he contacted the Agency was to obtain approval

to use the cover he was

given during his Agency

29

activities in the late 1950's, to wit:!

• He said as far as ne knew,

that cover was never blown and it is now defunct.

told the Subject I would check the matter out and let

him know.

5. Following a review of the Subject's file,

I co-ordinated this matter with the following

individuals:

Fred Bucci, WH/SO

Davis Phillips, WH/COG

Tom Strange,

Joseph Goodwin, Assistant to the DCI

6. On 15 January 1959, I called the Suhiert and 24

gave him permission

to use thel

cover in dealing with the movie film people. Further,

I requested that he not make any attribution to the

Agency, or furnish any operational or classified material.

The Subject

stated he understood that and indicated that

he did not intend to damage or embarrass the Agency in

any way.

Then, I told the Subject as a matter of personal

curiosity, I would appreciate hearing from him as to how

he "made out".

7.

On 27 January 1969, I contacted the Subject and

he advised that he had met on 16 January 1969 with a

Mr. Marshall of the 20th Century Fox Movie Firm, New

York City. Apparently, their talk was exploratory and

According to the Subject, Mr.

Marshall left with a, "We'll call you; don't you call us",

understanding.

The Subject indicated strong doubts that

anything further would develop in this matter.

On 27 January 1969 I advised Mr. Bucci of what

I had learned from the Subject and he stated that he

would pass it on to Mr. Phillips.

No further action

is contemplated and this memorandum is submitted for

record purposes.
