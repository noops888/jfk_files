Dear Scotty:

On the occasion of retirement, it has
been the custom to send a letter to our
employees in appreciation for their services.
While your retirement has been stretched a
bit by your willingness to help us on the
transition to your successor, I do not want
the occasion to passa without this recognition.

I sincerely regret the publicity which
surrounded: your retirement and the circum-
stances under which it occurred. These should
not, however, conceal tne fact that you have
made a real contribution to your country, to
this Agency, and to the intelligence profession
in your many years of service. We do appre-
ciate this contribution and wish you the best
of satisfaction and enjoyment in the years
ahead.

Sincerely,

W. E. Colby

1, This is a recommendation for promotion for Mr. Miler

2, The carcerof this officer has becn notably marked through-
out “ith relatively important responsibilities for his age. His youth,
intense drive, initiative, self-assurance, capacity for work, natural
talent for determining the objectives, recognizing the problem,
organization of the work to be done, administering and supervising
the effort, have long been evident to those for and with whom he has
worked, Years of service during which he has steadily matured has
resulted in a'recognition, by supervisors and subordinate fellow-
workers alike of his unusually wide experience, proven soundness of
judgement, organizational administrative and executive talent coupled
with powers of expression both oral and written and demonstrated
capacity for work, «He is unquestionably a very outstanding officer.

3, Having entered on duty as a Code Clerk (GS-05) in October
1946 following an A,B, degree ir, Economics from Dartmouth College
in a Navy V-12 Program, he was soon assigned to Shanghai where he

remained a short period before a TDY assignment to

Manchuria from April 1947| \where despite being

barely 21 years of age and an official designation as Code Clerk as
Grades e 2 o. SSR_and

cases with X-2 officers. His talents were recognized and after TDY
training at Headquarters, he was assigned to Shanghai as an Intelligence
Officer. There he performed as a Case Officer and engaged in stay
beyond planning, supervision of other junior Case Officers, and assisted
in the evacation of other CIA officers, Before he wae 25 years of age,

he established the station and served as Chief of for

seme 20 months (1949-51),



SD anid

-2.

4, He has successfully engaged in all types of operations -
FI, Gl, CA including PM and PW, but his principal talents have been
in the Counter Intelligence, particularly Counter-Espionage field,
His experience includes service as Chiefs of Station, Senior-Case
Officer, Senior Staff Officer, and since September 1964, Deputy
Chief of the Special Investigations Group of the Cl Staff where he
has had a major responsibility in the supervision of senior grade
Counter Intelligence Officers as well as being personally and directly
active in matters of agreat complexity and highest security consid-
erations, In his service in that capacity he has demonstrated his
outstanding abilities as a Counter Intelligence officer. He has
carried a substantial portion of the work load of his office including
supervision of both clerical and officer personnel, liaison with all
elements of the Agency and other intelligence and security services
of the government as appropriate, It is strongly recommended that he
be promoted to Grade GS-16,

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Africa Division
SUBJECT: Recommendation for Promotion = Newton Scott Miler

1, It is recommended that Newten Scott er be promoted
from his present grade of GS-14 to GS-15. Miler was assigned
to tho Africa Division on 9 July 1961 and assumed his present
position of Chief of Station, Addis Ababa, in September 1961,
He has been in grade since 24 March 1957, In accepting his
present assignment Miler assumed responsibility for a very com=
plicated operational program requiring considerable reorientation
and modification, In a short time he has been able to give
purpose and direction to operations which previously had been
the subject of considerable controversy within DD/P, It is
worthy of note that Miler has accomplished this with an almost
entirely new team, few of whom had any previous experience in

African operations,

2. Under normal circumstances, the Supervisor would be
inclined to delay a promotion recommendation pending further
opportunity to observe first hand the performance of the
individual, It is felt that Miler is a justifiable exception
to this rule, Prior to his assignment to the Africa Division,
Miler had been recommended for promotion by his former Supervisor
who is presently Deputy Chief, CI-CE Staff, This man had
apparently felt so strongly about Miler's performance that he
had siggeeted that Miler be the one man on the CI-CE staff who
should be given a jump promoticn to supersradc. If acccessary a
memorandum supporting the remarks made can be obtained.

3, In addition to the above, the Supervisor has been
ussuciated with Miler in a professional relationship since 1946.
The only gap in continuity was from the period 1956 to 1959. It
4s folt, therefore, that the Supervisor's evaluation of Miler's
knowledge, ability, experience, and potential bears weight,

MEMORANDUM FOR: Acting Chief, CI Staff

SUBJECT: Recommendation for Promotion of
Newton Scott Miler

1, It is recommended that Mr. Miler be promoted to Grade 15,

2, During the two years that he has been an officer of the
Operations Group of the Cl Staff Mr. Miler has demonstrated an
exceptional ability to interpret counterintclligence experience and
practice in guiding operations in this area throughout the divisions
of the DD/P, He has applied field experience gained in one area,
combined with expertly informed Headquarters knowledge, to
intricate and sensitive problems affecting U. S. security ina
variety of geographic areas from the Far East to the Western
Hemisphere and Europe with outstanding skill and sureness of
judgment. He is aggressive, devotes long hours uncomplainingly
to his tasks, and willingly contributes his guidance iv officers of
less experience, In perconal relationships throughout the
Clandestine Services he is admired, respected, and well-liked.
His recommendations are eagerly sought and contribute in major
fashion to increased efiectiveness 1n carrying out the Ci mission,

Ha It is again strongly recommended that he be promoted to GS-15.

MEMORANDUM in Lieu of Fitness Report

SUBJECT: Newton Scott MILER
(i April 1969 ~ 31 March 1970)

1, During the current rating period Mr, MILER was transferred

- from his previous positiun as Deputy Chief of the Special Intelligence

Group of the Counter Intelligence Staff to the position of Chief of the
Operations Group of the same Staff, This was a new position and as such
required unusual skills and vigor to give dimension to the job to be don!

Mr, MILER approached hia task with imagination and energy. He inherited
an incohesive group of capable officers and immediately began the task of
trying to define common denominators for their operational activities, ‘to
weed out duplicatory and marginal tasks, to establish clearly delineated
guidelines and tu provide a sense of discipline, all aimed toward giving
better countcrintelligence guidance and support to the operations of the
area divisions and the operational components of the CA Staff.

2. At the same time Mr. MILER has continued to handle, under
the direct guidance of the Chief, Counter Intelligence Staff, a number of
extremely sensitive cases to which he has contributed analytically and |
developmentally. The cases required not only keen operational sense in:
their handling, but a strong feeling for liaison as many of the cases involved
frequent high-level discussion and negotiation with other components of
CIA as well as with outside agencies and departments, In fulfilling these.
responsibilities, Mr. MILER has worked without regard to hours or to his
personal convenience, - He has assiduously tried to reflect the thinking of
the Chief of the CI Staff and to relate it to the operational problems he is
handling, He has also given mature, insightiul supervision and encourage-
ment to the orientation and development of a Deputy Chief, Operations,
another important innovation in the Staff's organization,

3. As a member of the Program Review Panel Mr. MILER con-
tributed fully in examining, reviewing and commenting on the programs
of the operating components within the Clandestine Service. He, together;

SECRET
EYes G



‘with other members of the Pancl have striven to devise a formula to

give management a clear, concise picture of what we intend to do and
what we are doing and have done to make those intentions reality,

5. While being able to adjust his own thinking wien and aw
required by a given situation, Mr, MILER has strong personal con-
victions on operational matters and does not hesitate to advance his

opinions or to push for his recommended solutions.

6. Mr. MILER is currently directing an office which includes
in its complement one GS-16 and dite GS-15s, He is also responsible
for the career development offm' more junior case officers. The
above is in addition to the normal supervision of the remaining group
staff, In performing these functions, he is cost-conscious and econo-
mizes in the expenditure of government funds and the valuable time of

senior officers,

7. Mr. MILER would be the first to admit that many problems
remain for him in his current assignment. He would also readily ack-
nowledge that he has not yet been able to clearly define each of these
problems or to provide the perfect solution for every one which has
been isolated. Progress, however, is being made every day and Mr.
MILER clearly demonstrates that his promotion to GS:16 ia 1969 was
deserved and that it will not be the last which he will merit. This ig
an officer of high professional integrity and dedication. He is a self-
starter, he works and thinks realistically. He speaks his mind when
he has something to say - including critical things, yet retains a good
sense for the craftsman's side of the CI job. He is not adept just at
identifying problems, he finds the solution,

7 duties must be described, if

: Mr. Miler is-an alert, intelligent, and experienced officer
who has worked hard to produce, results in what has proved over
the past years to be an extremely difficult area in which to
operate. With some notable exceptions, the station -under his
direction has failed to surmount these environmental problems
and to develop productive operations against high priority
targets. This should not be interpreted as meaning that the
station has failed to mount new operations; merely that fewer
key operations have been mounted than Headquarters would have
desired. wane

Mr. Miler-has been rated as adequate in his liaison with the
Ambassador and other members of the country team despite the fact

that. the Ambassador, in a private conversation with Lites eee
indicated his dissatisfaction and that of the

officers, i

with what the Ambassador described as Mr. Miler's
failure to participate in activities and his failure
to establish a satisfactory working relationship with the Ambas-
sador, On the basis of the Ambassador's comments Mr. Miler might
have been given a rating of "Weak" on this point. However, in
view of the problems which sometime develop in the field in
