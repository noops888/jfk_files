Status of Document: Postponed in Part

Number of releases of previously postponed information: 11

Reason for Board Action The Review Board's decision was premised on several factors
including (a) the significant historical interest in the document 1n question, (b) the
absence of evidence that the release of the information would cause harm to the United
States or to any individual

Number of Postponements: 10

Postponements All the postponements in this document represent Social Security numbers

Reason for Board Action The text 1s redacted because the public disclosure of the redaction could
reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, and that invasion of
privacy would be so substantial that it outweighs the public interest
