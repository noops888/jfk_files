Re request 3/26/76 from FBI to IPS to confirm our previous
concurrence in'release of Warren Commission Document #1247:

|
FBI Report ‘dated 22 June 1964, at Dallas, Texas, .
Subject: Lydia Dymitruk, Internal Security - R.

As a result of a December 1975 request from the FBI for a
determination on FBI reports in the Oswald case held at NARS,
some unknown person in CI Staff advised DDO/PIC that FBI

report identified as Warren Commission Document #1247 could

be declassified. (See FBI memorandum dated 12 December 1975.)
This declassification of Warren Commission Document #1247

did not take place and FBI, on review, came to the decision
that it might not be wise to declassify the entire report.
Ihave this date concurred in the suggestion of Mr. Howard,
FOI/FBI, that FBI not release this report at NARS since the
source of most of the information is the elgian Servic: Mr.
Howard indicated he would record the fact that the CIA source
document for this information is in our Oswald release. -

For Your Information: Declassification of Warren Commission
Document #1247 (based on Warren Commission Document #844)
was authorized as reflected in Mr. Briggs' memorandum of

19 December 1975 to IPS. (Warren Commission Document #844 --
CIA Memorandum to J, Lee Rankin of Warren Commission, dated
24 April 1964 -- was not processed against the Oswald 201 and
appears neither in the released nor denied list of documents. A
check with NARS reflects that Warren Commission Document

#844 was authorized for release in its entirety earlier in 1975.)



The same information is reflected in the Oswald package as
Item #282 (partial declassification) identified as:

CSCI to FBI dated 22 April 1964, Subject: Assassina-
tion of President John F, Kennedy - Bio Info on Lydia
Dimytruk.

Since Warren Commission Document #844 is declassified in
its entirety, it appears Oswald Document #282 should be con-
sidered for declagsification, in its entirety.
