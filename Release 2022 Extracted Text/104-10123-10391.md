liaison with( intelligence representatives
involving numeroug trins to/Eurone, This Maison activity with 24
representatives jestablished a direct channel :

of communications resulting in a continuous exchenge of leads and.
a flow of operational data over the years of benefit to the Agency.

During the period of his work with the Security Research
Staff, in which he served as Deputy Chief from May 1957, Mr.-
McCord was the Agency's case officer in a number of double agent |”
cases involving Agency staff employees who had been contacted
and were being developed for recruitment by the Soviet intelligence
service, : ot

From 1962 to 1964, Mr. McCord served overseas as Chief (5-20 ”
of the Regional Security Support Staff located at(Frankfurt, Germany J. siuere
with reaponsibility for the overall personnel and physical security“ :
and audio countermeasures programs applicable to the Stations and
Bases of the European area. This assignment was followed by
attendance at the Air War College, August 1964 to June 1965. -

For the past five years, Mr. McCord has held two vital line
positions with world-wide responsibilities involving the Agency's
audio countermeasures and physical security programs. ==

As Chief of the Technical Division from 23 July 1965 to
10 Cctober 1968, Mr. McCord supervised a technicel operation
with considerable skill. Although not an engineer by training, be
spanned e difficult gap between the administrative and technical
demands of his responsibilities, guiding the development of useful
and esoteric equipment in the counter-audio field to a point where
the Agency became the recognized leader among Government depart-
ments in this area of activity. This leadership is evidenced by the

establishment of an Inter-Agency Technical Training Center under
the Executive Agency of the Technical Division for the Technical
Surveillance Countermeasures Committee of the United States
Intelligence Board. Much of Kir. McCord's ideas, talents, and
imagination went into the creation of thig training activity which
commenced operations about the time of his reassignment to the
Physical Security Division. : tee ees a cee a eer

: Mr. McCord participated with two subordinate employees
in the development of x-ray equipment for use by the Technical
Division in detecting and locating hostile audio devices implanted
in office appurtenances and walls of Agency occupied facilities.
The responsibility for ensuring that appropriate protective methods
for the safe use of thie equipment was also associated with this
development. The significance of this achievement was recognized
by the Agency when Mr. McCord and his participating colleagues
were awarded Certificates of Merit ~~" "tn October 1966,
‘In his current position as Chief, Physical Security Division,
Mr. McCord demonstrated his ability to quickly assimilate the
necessary details of a field in which he had relatively little ex-
perience. He showed initiative tn seeking out new ways and means
to harden the security of the Agency's domestic and overseas
facilities by tapping all possible technological resources, both in = -
and out of Government, to produce for the Agency a posture in the
physical security field which is the equal of, if not superior to, thoee
of other elements of the United States Government. Illustrative of
this effort is the expansion and improvement of the Agency's Security
Command Center relating to the protection of Agency assets in time
of demonstrations, riots and civil disturbances.

Throughout his Agency career, Mr. McCord has engaged

his curious and inventive mind to search out even better ways to
solve problems within his area of responsibility. As a result, his
