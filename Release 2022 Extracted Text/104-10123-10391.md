former Soviet intellisence personalities. Tile activity led to close

liaison with

Intelligence representatives

involving numerous trios to/Eurone.

"This liaison activity with 24

representatives

lestablished a direct channel

of communications resulting in a continuous exchange of leads and

a flow of operational date over the years of benefit to the Agency.

During the perlod of his work with the Security Research

Staff, in which he served as Deputy Chief from May 1957, Mt.:

McCord was the Agency'& case officer in a number of double agent

cases involving Agency staff employees who had been contacted

and were being developed for recruitment by the Soviet intelligence

service.

From 1962 to 1964, Mr. McCord served overseas as Chiel 15:20

of the Regional Security Support Staff located at Frankfurt, Germany

with responsibility for the overall personnel and physical security

and audio countermeasures programs applicable to the Stations and

Bases of the Europezn area.

This assignment was followed by

attendance at the Air War College, August 1964 to June 1965.

For the past five years, Mr. McCord has held two vital line

poitions with world-wide responsibilities involving the Agency's

audio countermeasures and physical security programs.

As Chief of the Technical Division from 23 July 1965 to

10 October 1968, Mr. McCord supervised a technical operation

with considerable skill. Although not an engineer by training, be

spanned a difficult gap between the administrative and technical

demands of his responsibilities, guiding the development of useful

and esoteric equipment in the counter-audio field to a point where

the Agency became the recognized leader among Government depart-

mente in this area of activity. This leadership is evidenced by the

establishment of an Inter-Agency Technical Training Center under

the Executive Agency of the Technical Division for the Tichnical

Surveillance Countermeasures Committee of the United States

Intelligence Board. Much of Mr. MeCord's ideas, talents, and

imagination went into the creation of this training activity which

commenced operations about the time of his reassigament to the

Physical Security Division.

Mr. McCord participated with two subordisate employeea

in the development of s-ray equipment for use by the Technical

Division in detecting and locating hostile audio devices implanted

in office appurtenances and walls of Agency occupied facilities.

The responsibility for ensuring that appropriate protective methode

for the safe use of this equipment was also associated with this

development. The significance of this achievement was recognized

by the Ageney when Mr. McCord and his participating colleagues

were awarded Certificates of Merit

in October 1966.

In his current position as Chief, Physical Security Division,

MI. McCord demonstrated his ability to quickly assimilate the

necessary details of a field in which he had relatively little ex-

perience. He showed initiative in seeking out new ways and means

to harden the security of the Agency'a domestic and overseas

facilities by tapping all possible technological resources, both 1: -

and out of Government, to produce for the Agency a posture in the

physical security field which is the equal of, if not superior to, those

of other elemente of the United States Government. Illustrative of

this effort is the expansion and Improvement of the Agency's Security

Command Center relating to the protection of Agency assets in time

of demonstrations, riots and civil disturbances.

Throughout his Agency career, Mr. McCord has engaged

his curious and inventive mind to search out even better ways to

solve problems within his area of responsibility.. As a result, his

Agency career is a record of sustained superior performance of

duty of high value.

The value of his exemplary performance over

the years has often been recognized and commended by senior

olficials of the Agency. It is on this basis that Mr. McCord is

nominated for the Certificate of Distinction upon the occasion of

his retirement.
