The CL is split into to factions.

a. Tho faction vhich is allied with the MIRR ig headed
by Jose A. Rajoy, and is composed of the majority
of the action-type members of the original organisation,

b. The faction which is affiliated with the CF is headed
by Ramon Font Satwell, Tais faction has a larger cunber
of the. menbers of the original organization, but feyer
of the action type. A significant nwober of the nesters
of this faction are adherents of Fulgencic Batista Zaldivar,
former President of Cuba, irraserieiaaee

Each faction controls part of the equipment which belonged
to the original organization.

The MRTN is split into three factions,

a. The faction which is allied with the SFNE is located
in New York, and is headed by Hiram Gonzalez Herrera.
Although this group has few members, 1€ is the test
organized of the three factions, The main activity of
this group is to collect meacy for the SFNE.

b. The faction which is associated with the OF is disorganized,
beset with internal dissetsiva, and has few meabers. Since
early summer 1966, two leaders of this factien hare resigned
because of internal problems, first Miguel Isa Fresseda,
then his successor, Luis Moreno Alvarez, Haul Horta is
now the leader of this faction, which is expected to
maintain its association with the CF.

ce. The third faction, which is called the Prank Pais
Revolutionary Movement (HRFP), is actually a phantca
organization, Arturo Gonzalez Gonzalez, the leaser,
uses the nane of this group in an effort to create the
impression that he nas a position of ‘leadership in the
emigre community, This faction is uot known to be
connected with any other organization, although at one
time it was associated with the Alinnza Revolucionaria
Dezocratica (ARD, Democratic Revolutionary Alliauce).

Fiold Comment, The NIRR has for somo time been planning
to. attack vessels of nations which trade with Cuba,
Besides sabotage on vessels in ports, members of ‘the

On 28 April.1966 Orlando Bosch Avila, leader of the Movimiento

that 20 men were located in various ports in the United States
and Latin America with orders to place explosives, which they
bave, on vessels of nations which trade with Cuba,” One of the
best'men is in Costa Rica, and the first act of sabotage
against a vessel may occiir theré, ie said that the men are

in touch with labor leaders at the ports where they are located,

According. to Bosch, he has received a voto of confidence from.
nombers of the UIRR to be solely responsible tor the planning
and execution of the sabotage of ships which will be carried
out by theso men, Only he can identify tho men and their
locations, and he is the only person who 1s in touch with
them, He said that not even the executive committee of the

MIRR knows the identities of the men,

Bosch said that one plan of the MIRR to attack a vessel on the
high seas which was engaged in Cuban trade failed when the
