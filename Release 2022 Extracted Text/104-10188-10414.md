5. Station Support.

d. On the morning of ! December 1963, PARMUTH assisted RESCIGNO

a installing audio microphones under the flouring of an LCHARVEST occupie

partment. ($co HMMA-22608, 11 Dec 63, para 5. d.) Lines leading from th

audio installation to the LP were strung and secured below the flooring which had

ample semi-crawling apace between the target area and the LP apartment.

RESCIGNO and PARMUTH entered thie crawling space by removing a small

section of flooring located inside the LP apartment. There is also a trap door

leading into the crawl space at the front entrance hall of the building although

the curious would be discouraged to enter this area because of atagnant water

six to ten inches deep on the floors at all times, cob webs, bugs, etc., etc...

Three audio microphones were installed on this operation.

b. During the period 2-14 December 1963, PARMUTH again handled

LIFIRES 4/5 while Marvin A. CABOT was on annual leave.

c. On 6 December 1963 PARMUTH forwarded to KURIOT/ WAVE

Headquarters two orders of envelopes (six month supply per each request)

and one request for stamps.

The envelopes were handcarried by Timothy A.

CAPRIOTT t WAVE Headquarters, avoiding a week's delay if the envelopes

were sent through the pouch from Mexico City. The stamps were handcarried

by another DYer to the States for mailing to Washington.

d. On 6 December 1963 PARMUTH was requested to re-enter the

LP. covering the LCHARVEST apartmerit as reported in para 5. a. of this report.

The purpose of this visit was to udlock a closed door which stured the LP equip-

ment which monitors LCHARVEST activitica in that apartment. Although the

basehouse keeper had a key which worked well for several days previously, the

lock would not open for the agent on the afternoon of 6 December. PARMUTH

entered the apartment at 0130 hours on 7 December and unlocked the door. It

was found that the throw bolt located inside the lock was broken. For security

purposes, two other locks were removed from other doors located in the same

room to check if these locks were in the same bad condition. In each case,

when the key was inserted into the lock and turned excessively, the throw bolt

snapped. A new lock of the same type manufacture was installed on the cioset

door by the basehouse keeper on 7 Deceinber 1963.

On the night of 7 December 1963, PARMUTH was requested by

the COS to install an extension phone at the COS residence. After a short

training period given by RESCIGNO at the MKCHARITY base, PARMUTH was

able to service this request satisfactorily.

This extension was one which

replaced one removed (for study) by KUSODA officials who inspected Mexico.

f. On 10 December 1963 PARMUTH photographed $23 frames, using

the Recordak to fulfill a monthly Staff D requirement for the Chief of Station.

b.

On the morning of 17 December 1963, SWINEHART, LIFEUD/22

and PARMUTII met at the LIERODE basehouse to install the 35mm SEQUENCE

camera and the VLS? trigger device. SWINEHART instructed both L-22 and
