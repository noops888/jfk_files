in installing audio microphones under the flooring of an LCHARVEST occupied
apartment, .(86e HMMA-22608, Il Dec 63, para 5.d.) Lines leading from the
audio installation to the LP were strung and secured below the flooring which had
ample semi-crawling space between the target area and the LP apartment,
RESCIGNO and PARMUTH entered thie crawling space by removing a small

section Gf flooring located inside the LP apartment. There is also a trap door
leading inté the crawl space at the front entrance hall of the building although
the curious would be discouraged to enter this area because of stagnant water
six to ten inches deep on the floors at all times, cob webs, bugs, etc., ete...
Three audio microphones were installed on this operation,

LLIFIRES 4/5 while Marvin A, CABOT was on annual leave,

Headquarters two orders of envelopes (six month supply per cach request)
and one request for stamps, The envelopes were handcarried by Timothy A,
CAPRIOTT two WAVE Headquarters, avoiding a week's delay if the exvelopes
were sent through the pouch from Mexico City, The stamps were handcarried
by another TDYer to the States for mailing to Washington,

d, On 6 December 1963 PARMUTH was requested to re-enter the
LP covering the LCHARVEST apartment as reported in para 5.a. of this report,
The purpose of thie visit was to unlock a closed door which stored the LP equip-
ment which monitors LCHARVEST activitics in that apartment, Although the
basehouse keeper had a key which worked well for several days previously, the
lock would not open for the agent on the afternoon of 6 December, PARMUTH
entered the apartment at 0130 hours on 7 December and unlocked the door, It
was found that the throw bolt located inside the lock was broken, For security
purposes, two other locks were removed from other doors located in the same
room to check if these locks were in the same bad condition, In each case,
when the key was inserted into the lock and turned excessively, the throw bolt
snapped, A new lock of the same type manufacture was installed on the closet

door by the basehouse keeper on 7 December 1963.

e. On the night of 7 December 1963, PARMUTH was requested by
the COS to install an.extension phone at the COS residence, Alter a short
training period given by RESCIGNO at the @BCHARITY base, PARMUTH was
able to service this request satisfactorily. This extension was one which :

replaced one removed (for study) by KUSODA officials who inspected Mexico,

the Recordak to fulfill a monthly Staff D requirement for the Chief of Station.

negatives, On the morning of 18 December 1963, L22 contacted PARMUTH and
explained that the Consulate door was now open to the public and receiving
visitors as of 1010-that day. PARMUTH and SWINEHART joined L-22 shortly
later at the LIERODE basehouse and found that the camera system was working
well and photographing people entering and leaving this target drea, SWINEHART
then processed this film at the Station lab and made sample prints of the day's
take to be prosented to the COS and C/PBRUMEN for their approval, Both were
‘very pleased with the photographic results using this type of camera equipment,
at the-LIERODE basehouse, As of this reporting, the SEQUENCE camera is
weing approximately 100 feet of Plus X film between 0900 and 1400 hours (office

traffic entering and leaving the front gate of the Embassy and is on duty from
