the United States does not get along with MRR leadersht
in Miami. :

y
On August 30, 1962, HIGINIO "NINO!
Place, Miami, Florida, advised

e MRR and a member of the CRC.
the underground movement in Cuba is no longer effective,
cannot operate, and at the present time could be conside:
non;existent. DIAZ claimed there are about 100 MRR memb
uerto. Rico that are loyal to the leadership ‘of ROBERTC
OCA in Puerto Rico and that ROCA looks to DIAZ for lead
ship and “Féprésentation to the CRC. DIAZ explained that

although the membership in Puerto Rico is restless and
anxious for some military action against Cuba, they. have
no immediate military plans because they lack sufficien
money, weapons, and transportation to effect a military

! operation. .

’
'

DIAZ continued in kis charges against /
leadership of sosp-Senact KLASAGA and_CE! BARO/ ESTEVAI(.; j
MRR leaders in~the United ‘States. DIAZ claimed that’ B:
wants to integrate the Roman Catholic Church with any Ede
new government of Cuba and make the Roman Catholic religion

mandatory instructions for small children in Cuba. DIAZ
maintains that the MRR in Miami is dominated by an elite.
