there, Date of HAHN's introduction to

ay George PARIS aka George PERIS was ertimated by Mr. Sayte to have been

inclinations toward sharing bis knowledge of romance with other:

GAs attachment herewith, the writer appends additional background
data on the professional intelligence activities and contacts of Valeatin HAHN
and family as noted during the oral briefing by Sayle.

7. On basie of the above, it can be safely assumed that tha George

PARIS known to HAHN ts identical with

George PERISTERCPOULOS aka

George PERIS, well-known Tokyo businessman and Honorary Deputy Coneal
of the Royal Greek Consulate in Yokohama, Japan, as reported in SCTCKY-63

and SCTOKY-64. It is noteworthy that
commencing ¥-th pis original reported
bis activities and coritacts in Shanghai,

PERIS' contacts throughout ais career.
employment in Tientsin, China, through
Cina, and Later in Tokyo, not exclud-

‘ing bis marriage to Aurelia CZERWINSKA, have been exclusively with
individuals of Russian or Eastern European background, many of them of
Ruslan Jewish background, who are eitber highly suspect or have been iden-
tiffed as long-time agente of Soviet Intelligence. PERIS' reported route of
arrival in Tokyo via Harbin, Tientsin and Shanghai, as well aa his employ-
ment by Sondovich Brothars and.contacts with individuals who tie in with th
Boris SOLOMONIK complex and Borsol Fur Trading Corporation, smacke
very strongly of the old Comintere Apparat of the 20's and 30's. Also it
parallels ibe travel patterns of a number of individuals involved in the SOBLE
Saee, principally the SOBLES themselves who were exfiltrated from the

Soviet Union via Tokyo, Japan, to the U.

also were under cover of operating a Bi

and who, most notably of all,
Business as ie Sondovich Brothers.

George PERIS ic alleged to have been a contact of William Hamilton MARTIN

in Tokyo, and to have offered MARTIN
ehip deal in connection with the rug bus

some type of job or business partner-
iness.

9. Mr. Carrico informally indicated that he personally suspects that

MARTIN

introduction to the fine art of masochistic torture by an unidenti-

fied Japanese female, as reported by Mro. Ardeile GASDA to FBI agents,

may have been effected at or through bit

8 patronage af the ‘Tomorrow is Too

Late" Club to which he may well have beon taken or introduced by bis friend
PERIS, This poselbility, however, is subject to further investigation.

A second cable to be pent by Privacy Lank to Seoul, Korea, has also been
Grafted, and requests check of PERIS' arrival, activities and contacte,
departure from Korea subsequent to 28 January 1960, This cable has beea
presented separately for your approval and may likely be eudject to revision,
wierefore no copy is attached. It io pias suggested that Cifice of Security
be authorized to pass to NSA Security Officiale working on this case the
information on PERIS relayed in above SCTOKY tables, suca information to
be properly sterilized of course, and that NSA in turn be requested to check
and obtain from U.S. Navy Personnel Records fuil copies in duplicate of the
ouginal reports on the specific duty stations or assignments, including dates
of service at each, to which MARTIN and MITCHELL were ¢etailed, also
detailed leave records, travel records, and other pertinent background data
Contained in such files, to cover the entire period of their respective service
with the U.S. Navy. It is also euggested that NSA officials be requested to
obtain similar detailed original reports in duplicate from the Denartment of
= fo weree sus porsoa of MAKLIN'S Civilian employment in Japan,
with special emphasis on any reports of MARTIN'S extra-curricular activitles,
contacts, club memberships, identified personal contacts with persons not
employed in his own office, leave travel, etc., which may be reflected in
official records. One copy of all auch reports are requested for thie Agency,
to permit further checking of known or newly identified contacts be may have
had in Japan.
