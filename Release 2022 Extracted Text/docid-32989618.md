At 9:55 a.m. on July 3, 1975, former Assistant Director
__-twan Conrad telephonically advis ed. me that he has been contacted and
requested 1 to ay appear for interview by the Senate Select Committee during
the week of July 7, 1975, concerning Martin Luther King. Mr. Conrad
expressed great concern about his appearance for such an interview and
requested guidance.

I told-him that the Director was cooperating with the Committee
in their inquiry, but that in regard to matters that would identify informants,
4 affect current operations, or compromise very sensitive techniques any

testimony may require limitation to members of the Committee or to the
Chairman rather than staff interviewers.

Mr. Conrad then asked whether he should respond in the
event questions were raised concerning sensitive matters regarding the
U.S. mails. I told him that in the event questions were asked which
appeared to be beyond the scope of the subject matter indicated for the A aad
interview, or which in his judgment would involve the three areas of ~—_ _
concern expressed above, it would be appropriate for him to request a
recess for the purpose of consulting with the Bureau.

Mr. Conrad inquired as to his possible criminal liability and
whether the FBI would furnish him counsel. I explaized to him the difficulties
imposed by conflicts of interest in that regard and that the FBI could not
furnish him personal counsel. I told him that if he felt the need for advice
as to his personal status, he should consider obtaining the services of a
personal counsel. He said that he would consider that and that although he
was specifically not.making a request at this time, he would consider in the
future requesting that the Bureau pay for, his private cc counsels ant yf fs) 4

Memorandum to Mr. Adams
Re: Senate Select Committee

Mr. Conrad was cordial and said he understood fully that
I was not in a position to furnish him legal advice. I suggested that he
contact the Bureau prior to his appearance for the interview in order to be
advised formally as to his release from the Bureau employment agreement
concerning secrecy and he agreed.

For information.

This is to record inquiry received from_Mr. Leon = Pes s'r—
<Ulman; Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal
Counsel, and recommend response to him,

On 7/22/75, Mr. Ulman called Assistant Director -
Legal Counsel J.A. Mintz ‘to request assistance concerning
an assignment he had been given by the Attorney General (AG)
| relating to the current investigation being conducted by the
| Senate Select Committee (SSC), In accordance with Mr. Mintz'
| referral to our Senstudy project group, Mr, Ulman was contacted
7/22/75 by Supervisor J. P. Thomas, Mr, Ulman said that the
AG had requested his office to prepare, by 7/25/75, the fullest
possible response to the question, "To what extent has the AG
been involved in consideration or approval of policies and
activities of U.S. foreign and military intelligence agencies?"
Mr, Ulman said that he had requested the Criminal Division
of the Department to conduct research on this matter but, being
unfamiliar with foreign intelligence matters, desired to know
whether we could in any way assist him, He was informed that 7” >
‘the FBI is basically not a U.S. foreign intelligence agency.
He responded that some of our operations involve foreign
intelligence and again asked if we could assist. He was told
that we certainly could not furnish any full answer, but would
attempt to see if we could contribute something to his assigp-
ment. It was also suggested to Mr, that sonsider
contacting Mr, K. William Sicoonor Pett, aes REE iz Oe vi
aspects of the SSC investigation for the Department, and might
be able to clarify the request or contribute to the LOSRARS pean” wee
and that he consider contacting CIA, He indicated hedid not
feel that contact with CIA would be productive. It wasSaghtbe@s 1975
that the inquiry appears to relate to the AG institutionally
rather than to any involvement of the incumbent, Mr. 7

Memorandum to Mr, W. R. Wannall
Re: Senstudy 75
62-116395

Inquiry of Intelligence Division personnel, who
might have pertinent information, developed the following
information which might be offered to Mr, Ulman: (1) The
only specific instance in which we are aware that the AG is
involved in consideration or approval of activities of the
FBI regarding foreign intelligence is that when we desire to
effect electronic coverage, for ourselves or on request of
another agency, for the purpose of obtaining positive foreign
intelligence information or foreign counterintelligence
purposes, we seek the approval of the AG. Other agencies
might do likewise. (2) The National Security Act of 1947,
approved by the President 7/26/47, created the National Security
Council (NSC). NSC Intelligence Diréétive (NSCID) No. 1 was
revised on 7/7/49 and added the FBI as a member of the  ._..
Intelligence Advisory Committee (IAC). By a subsequent revision
of NSCID No. 1 on 9/15/58, IAC became the United States
Intelligence Board (USIB), with the FBI still a member, USIB
concerns itself with foreign intelligence matters, However,
inasmuch as the FBI itself is a member of USIB, and historically
the FBI has not coordinated USIB matters with the AG* the
Bureau's role in USIB is not considered pertinent to the
inquiry regarding the involvement of the AG in foreign intelligence
matters. (3) Our records indicate that prior to the establishment
of the NSC, former FBI Director Hoover recommended that the
AG be a member of the committee which later became the NSC.
Apparently the National Security Act of 1947 did provide for
the AG to attend NSC meetings as a member if the President so
desired, Our records indicate the AG did attend some NSC
meetings as a member during the 1947-48 period. However, by
memorandum 8/19/49, AAG Peyton Ford informed Mr. Hoover that
the AG could no longer attend NSC meetings as a member because
of the amendment to the National Security Act made by Section 3
of Public Law 216, 81st Congress, approved 8/10/49. (4) On :
11/5/71, the White House announced the establishment of the
*except in important policy matters
such as the recent revision of
NSCID No. 9. 2

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall
Re: Senstudy 75
62-116395

National Security Council Intelligence Committee (NSCIC)

with the AG as a member. The President's 11/5/71 memorandum
stated the NSCIC "will give direction and guidance on national
substantive intelligence needs and provide for a continuing
evaluation of intelligence products from the viewpoint of the
intelligence consumer." Assistant AG Robert Mardian attended
a meeting of NSCIC on 12/14/71 as the AG's representative.

We cannot document it, but the recollection of FBI personnel
involved in NSCIC affairs is that Mr. Mardian reported thereafter
to the AG that NSCIC activities did not concern the Department
and that neither the AG nor Mardian were subsequently involved
in NSCIC affairs. On 4/24/74, the AG was still listed as a
member of NSCIC. However, in August, 1974, FBI inquiry of a
member of the U. ‘S. intelligence committee staff elicited the
opinion that the AG was no longer considered to be a member

of NSCIC because the AG's office had not been participating in’
NSCIC affairs or attending its meetings;’ further, the AG was
not among the addressees of papers being sent out in preparation
fot the next NSCIC meeting. However, it appears that the AG
May still be nominally listed as a member of NSCIC, (5) It
might also be useful for Mr. Ulman to consult Mr. Kevin Maroney
of the Internal Security Section of the Department inasmuch as
Mr. Maroney has ong been involved in matters relating to
internal ‘security and foreign intelligence, and may be aware

of the extent of the AG's involvement.

ve ACTION:
With your approval, Office of Legal Counsel will
convey the information in the preceding paragraph to Mr. Ulman,

Y who said he can be contacted by telephone on 187-2051. He
NG requested an expeditious response.

which advised we were preparing a report for Mr. Tom Charles

regarding our coverage of foreign communist support of
revolutionary youth activities in the United States te reach
him by 6/30/69, We advised Mr. Huston such a report would
be forthcoming. : iaueee
Gur report sets forth the traditional channel
for communist support of revolutionary activity in this
country by the established basic revolutionary groups under
foreign domination such as the Communist Party, USA, and the

-Socialist Workers Party. We also cover the capabilities of

hostizZe intelligence operations directed at the United States
by the Soviet Union, Cuba and Communist China.

Next we show the newer, bolder avenues of support
and directicn being utilized by revolutionaries, eften
without any attempt to conceal their purgose, These include
international conferences which in this period of history
are ostensibly for peace in Vietnam but which also have the
usual underlying goal of destroying United States prestige
in world affairs. The ease of international travel and
communication with revolutionary intent by New Lef¢ and black
aia oar adherents from the United States and abroad is thea
set forth.

Memorandum to Mr. W. C. Sullivan
RE: FOREIGN SUPPORT FOR REVOLUTIONARY PROTEST
MOVEMENTS IN THE UNITED STATES :

Our report shows that the FBI has been aware from
the inception of the New Left and black extremist movements
that they pose new and unique threats to oiir internal security.
it shows we have readjusted our investigative intelligence
efforts to cope with the new problems created. [t stresses
the fact that. these movements are developing increasingly
into hard-core revolutionary elements which will demand
still greater attention in ‘the form of increased coverage
as it appears there will be increasingly closer links between
these movements and foreign communists in the future. -

We have prepared a transmittal letter to Mr. Huston
submitting our report. Inasmuch as this document is not going

to Mr. DeLoach dated June 18, 1969.

Mr. Huston did come in yesterday. The first thing he said was
that he had made a mistake in going to Mr. J. Walter Yeagley as
Yeagley did not seem to know anything about the New Left. Mr. Huston
then went on to’say that. President Nixon called him in and discussed

ith him in some detail the need for the President to know in greater
depth the details concerning the revolutionary activi Ss stemming

rom the New Left. In particular, said Mr. Huston, President Nixon
Jis interested in all information possible relating to foreign
fantiuences and the financing of tne New Left. He said ie was
{requested by the President to also go to other members of the
intelligence community to develop whatever materials they may have
within their jurisdiction.

Mr. Huston said that on completing his work, it cone be
presented to the President for his use.

I told Mr. Huston that I was not in any position to make
commitments in this matter, that if he had such a request to make
it would be necessary for him to put it in writing and address his
letter to the Director who made the decisions in such areas,

PERSONAL AND CONFIDENTIAL

MEMORANDUM FOR THE DIRECTOR OF THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVE!

FROM: Tom Charles Huston :
Staff Assistant to the President |

The President has directed that a report on foreign
Communist support of revolutionary protest movements in this
country be prepared for his study. He has specifically requested
that the report draw upon all the resources available to the .
intelligence community and that it be as detailed as pessible.

i "Support" should be liberally construed to include
all activities by foreign Communists designed to encourage or
aati revolutionary protest movements in the United States

H On the basis of earlier reports submitted to the President
lon a more limited as. SPect of this problem, it appears that ov
ipresent intelligence collection cepabiliiices ik Uhis azea may
tbe inadequate. The President would like to know what resources
we presently have targeted toward monitoring foreign Communist
support of revolutionary youth activities in this country, how
oa effective they are, what gaps in our intelligence exist because
of either inadequate resources or a low priority of attention,
and what steps could be taken, if he directed, to provide
‘the maximum possible coverage of these activities.

; - ls
I have asked CIA, NSA, and DIA to submit their contributions ©
to me by Monday, June 30th. I would appreciate it ifthe Bureau
would provide their response to. the President's’ request by that
iaate. i aoe

This informative memorandum records information
telephonically furnished the morning of 7/17/75 to Supervisor
S. F. Phillips, INID, by former FBI Inspector Donald E. Moore.

At about 11:00 p.m., 7/16/75, Moore received a
telephone call at his residence from a Dave Martin (PH), who
identified himself with the AP (Associated Press), who asked
Moore if Moore was acquainted with the préss"atcounts of
Director Kelley's press conference on 7/14/75, particularly |,
as Mr. Kelley's remarks pertained to surreptitious entries \—j f;
principally at embassies. Moore told Martin that he had ae
read about the matter in the newspapers, Martin asked euaes
specifically about the "New York Daily News" of 7/16/75, and
Moore said he was not familiar with that account, Martin
then referred to the 7/16/75 "Washington Post" article and
referred Moore specifically to the newspaper referring to an
unnamed source. Martin wanted some comment from Moore which
the latter declined to give, Moore advising that any comment
should more properly come from the FBI.

Martin attempted to convince him he should make some
comment by stating that information about this matter would
eventually come out, and Martin was now offering Moore a charige
to put the matter in a better light. Martin then asked Moore
if Mr. Kelley was correct in his statement and Moore again
declined to comment. Martin said he thought that the "unnamed
source" referred to in the newspaper was Bill Sullivan
(obviously referring to former Assistant to the Director

William C, Sullivan). Martin asked Moore if ane gear ayes Wf
again Moore gave him a no comment reply. o “ff fe 3 we iad

Martin then asked whether Joe Purvis was at one
time the SAC in WFO. This being a matter of public record,
Moore said that Purvis had been SAC in WFO. Martin attempted
to determine Purvis' current whereabouts and Moore could be
of no assistance as he actually does not know, Moore was
asked whether Bob Kunkel had replaced Purvis and Moore said
that he thought he had. Martin then wanted to know who Purvis'
predecessor was in WFO. Moore referred Martin to the FBI.
According to Moore, their conversation was cordial but he
sensed that Martin hung up rather abruptly. Moore indicated
that he thought that the Bureau would be interested in the
foregoing and he said that any similar further inquiries made
of him would be'similarly reported to us. Moore was thanked
for bringing this matter to our attention.

ACTION:

None. For information.

Dear Mr. Attorney General: leye

On behalf of the Select Committee, we wish to
express our appreciation to you for meeting with us on
Wednesday afternoon. We recognize the need for the Com-
mittee to have a complete understanding of the concerns
of the Depar tment of Justice sq that our inquiry can
procéed in the most responsible manner. Our meeting
was extremely valuable in that respect, and you may be
sure that we have given Tuli consideration to your
views.

The Committee has been informed that Mr. John
f@. Elliff, leader of the Domestic Intelligence Task
Force, and members of his staff met yesterday with Mr.
K. William O'Connor, Special Counsel for Intellicance
coordination, and members of his staff to agree upon
procedures for delivery of and access to FBI materials
requested by the Committee. The proposed procedures
which resulted from that meeting are satisfactory to
the Committee.

We are pleased that your staff was able to meet
promptly with our representatives and that they reached
agreement without delay. The Committee expects that the
proposed procedures will, if implemented, expedite its
work during the coming weeks. As you know, ene of our
major concerns was that all of the problems with the
Committee's outstanding requests for materials

can fully prepare the materials for our use when we :
return. We believe the procedures are an appropriate HH
and practical accommodation of our mutual interests.

Indeed, we have instructed our staff to make every effort

to accomplish the work of the Committee within this

framework.

The prompt resolution of this matter demon-
strates a spirit of cooperation which we hope will .
prevail in all our future relations. The Committee looks
forward to working with you personally on issues of common
concern during the months ahead.

July 16, 1975

“K. William O'Connor, Esq.

Special Counsel for Intelligence Coordination
Office of the Deputy Attorney General

U.S. Department of Justice

Washington, D.C. 20530

Dear Mr. O'Connor:

: I have received your letter of July 15 regarding
access/delivery of documents requested in the Committee's
letter of July 9, 1975. The following relates specifically
to the procedure suggested for handling documents on the
so called "Kissinger 17" surveillance, which is also applied
in your letter to materials relating to electronic sur-
veillance of the Democratic National Convention in Atlantic
in August 1964, materi 1s relating to the electronic
and puoonibly the © & C files.

King,

I regard this suggested procedure as a major step
forward and a recognition that previous arrangements were
too cumbersome and time-consuming. Nevertheless, there
are certain practical problems with the procedure which may
be resolved by interpretation. For example, I assume that
application of the procedure to the Atlantic City conven
tion matters does not foreclose the Committee from receiving
for use at its offices actual documents or portions of
documents, as well as summaries. I understand that the
FBI has no objection to providing such documents on this
matter to the Committee for use at its offices. -

Therefore, in order that the procedure you suggest
may be applicable to all aréas of Committee inquiry claimed
by the Department to involve Senate! (alrieaia matters,
it should be interpreted as follows: . Committee staff
i all files_and_materials at FBIHQ:
select certain documents from the

files which it deems pertinent to the Committee's inquiry
. and necessary for the examination of witnesses or the es-
tablishment of certain facts during the course of the

inquiry; the FBI shall at that time designate specific
portions of such documents which might jeopardize par-
.ticularly sensitive sources or methods; with respect
to such specifically designated portions of documents,
the Committee staff will prepare appropriate excisions
or summaries of the information; the summaries will be
checked at that time with senior Bureau executives to
ensure the protection of particularly sensitive FBI
sources or methods; thereafter, the excised documents
and summaries will be removed to the Committee's offices;
the Committee staff may check back to the original documents |
as extensively as necessary; staff notes on the designated
specific portions of documents will not be removed from
FBIHQ; and Committee members may, of course, at.any time
see the documents which the staff has seen.

I believe this interpretation can serve as a work-
able framework for Committee access to particularly sensitive
FBI materials. You may be assured that the Task Force shares
your concern for the need to provide special handling tech-
niques to convey or secure any particularly sensitive
information or materials, as indicated in the Outline for
Inquiry Procedures. Wwe hope this interpretation wiil
facilitate the mutual effort by the Committee and the
Department of Justice to accomplish this purpose.

I would appreciate receiving your immediate advice
to me as to whether any further interpretation of this
matter is required. Any public:discussion of these arrange-

. ments and interpretations should be cast in such terms as
“will not jeopardize particularly’ sensitive FBI sources.

Sincerely, : : .

Director Colby of the CIA to the President dated 12/24/74 which dealt mainly \
with the issues discussed in a "New York Times" article of 12/22/74 by '
Seymour Hersh has been the subject of an FOIA request by Morton Halperin.
Wilderotter advised that attorneys for CIA had prepared the material for i a
release and that the material was now in the possession of The White House ~
for their review. He suggested that inasmuch as the FBI was mentioned SS
in some of the material that it would be desirable for the FBI to review the
material prior to its release. i

SA Fred J. Cassidy of the Intelligence Division reviewed this
material in Room 110 of the Old Gxecutive Office Building on 7/7/75. This
review determined that the FBI is mentioned throughout the material being
made available to Halperin and that most of the references to the FBI
included in the material appear in the Rockefeller Commission Report which

when we became aware of such a project through postal authorities,

| The only other item in the material to be furnished Halperin
which could possibly present future concern pertains to a memorandum
captioned "Restrictions on Operational Lists on Americans" which
was issued to CIA employees sometime subsequent to the CIA retrenchment
in activities brought about by allegations concerning CIA's involvement
in domestic activities. This memorandum concerned the discontinuance
of lists maintained on individuals who were of possible operational
interest to CIA such as doctors who studied abroad. The memorandum
noted that if such listings could not be made by CIA in a non-misunderstandable
manner arrangements should be made for the service to be performed by
line FBI or other service which can legitimately do this function. We
\maintain no such list and have not been requested by CIA to perform such
service. Under present day circumstances whether we could legitimately

perform such function is open to question.

At 9: 24 avnion duly-7;-1975; James | A. Wilder otter,
Associate Counsel to the President, telephoitically advised me that the
Colby Report to the President has been the subject of an FOIA request ,
by Morton Halperin, and attorneys for CIA have been preparing the material
4 , for release. Mr. Wilderotter identified the Colby report as a 7 or 8 page
(es addressed to the President dealing with the issues discussed in a news Ly

| article by Seymour Hersh. Included with the letter were nine enclosures _N
all of which were classified. This material has been reviewed and appropriate '
deletions made. 4)
S|
Mr. Wilderotter said that the material refers to FBI - CIA zp
liaison and the Bureau's Legats abroad. He said that he feels that the FBI J

{should review the material prior to its release. He said that the review
should be done today and that a Bureau representative should call Jay French,
at 145-2845, to arrange for the review which must be done in the Old Executive! 4

The Honorable Baward oe Levi

The Attorney General
U. S. Department of Justice
Washington, D. C. 20530

Dear Mr. Attorney General:

On April 28 I wrote to you concerning certain allegations
contained in Newsweek magazine pertaining to the removal from
the FBI of certain "personal and confidential" or "official and
confidential" files belonging to former Director J. Edgar
Hoover. The Select Committee did not receive eny acknowledgment
or response to the letter until one month leter on May 20, at
which time we received a memorandum from the FBI, That memo~
randum was unsigned and stated, in essence, that the FBI had no
knowledge of the matter although a former employee might. A
copy of my Letter of April 28, the FBI memorandum and a letter
of transmittal are attached.

As a result of conversations between members of my staff
and representatives of the Department of Justice and the FBI, the
Select Committee understood that the May 20 memorandum ended the
matter and that neither the Department nor the Bureau intended
to investigate further. We made it clear that we would proceed
with our investigation. In its May 14 comprehensive request of
your Department, the Committee had already specified several items
(items 21-23 of Appendix C) related to the so-called "Official
and Confidential" files which you had described in your testimony
of February 27, before the House Judiciary Committee. Further~
more, members of our staff have interviewed a number of persons
knowledgeable about the files maintained by Miss Helen Gandy,
Executive Assistant to Mr. Hoover, part of which apparently were
the "Official and Confidential" files which you had described
in your testimony.

7 On June & an article appeared in the New York Times ind
ing that the Department of Justice was undertaking an invest:

bx M6 SK He]
ENSLOSURE



NW 65360 Docld:32989618 Page 224

~2-

gation of the transfer of the files maintained in Miss Gandy's
office. The fact that the Department is conducting such an
investigation has been confirmed by representatives of the
Department and the Bureau.

We are pleased that you are investigating the matter and
trust that you now will be able to answer the questions posed
in my April 28 letter. In addition, we would appreciate your
“supplying any other information which comes to your attention
on the matter, including, of course, the results of your
investigation. In the meantime, however, our investigation
must continue. In that connection, representatives of the
Department have suggested that we should not interview current
Bureau employees during the course of the Department's investi-
gation. I am sure that you will agree that our investigation
shovld not be delayed by the pendency of the Department's
investigation. My hope is that we can work together on this
matter and, if you agree, would appreciate your indicating
that restrictions on our proceeding have been lifted.

Thank you for your cooperatien injthis matter.

Sancerely yours,

Tolson, J. Edgar Hoover's close friend and No.
2 man at the PBI, two FBI agents reportedly - aeacet
_.removed some documents from the late director's .
house in Washington, where Tolson had been liv-
ing. Officially, the FBI. denies taking any
“such action, and a friend of Tolson's says the
only Hoover documents Tolson had were,old can-
celed cheeks and tax returns.. But Newsweek had — ,
“ veported earlier that some of Hoover's private
dossiers, including information "very, vecy
damaging" to persons in the Nixon White House, .
were left in Tolson's custody, and a source. _°
told Newsweek this week that the materials were
carted away in a truck. - seer eSEmeEeER aa

of the so-called "Official and Confidential" files, your ~
testimony before the House Judiciary Committee on February

residence by FBI agents or former FBI agents after

Mr. Tolson's death. If agents of the FBI aid go to

Mr. Hoover's or Mr. Tolson's residence to remove files,
please provide the Select Committee with a complete des-—
eription of the docunients taken into custody by the FBI.
Were any such documents copies or originals of documents
relating to the business of the FBI? If so, please des-—
eribe the subject matter of each such document. Also
indicate the individual within the FBI.who has custody
over these files. Furthermore, I respectfully request on
behalf of the Select Committee that such files not be des-

notice.

INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

REQUEST FOR ACCESS TO OFFICIAL AND.
CONFIDENTIAL FILES OF FORMER DIRECTOR HOOVER yD

During a conference with the Deputy Attorney General at
1:45 p.m. on 6/23/75, the Deputy Attorney General requested the ae
Bureau to prepare summaries of summaries previously prepared
concerning the official and confidential files retrieved from the officé
suite following Mr. Hoover's death. The Deputy described a notebook
containing 164 summaries that had been made available to the Attorney
General. He requested that the 164 summaries be used as the basis
for preparation of summaries that may be made available for review
by representatives of the Senate Select Committee in lieu of direct
Committee access to the original files. He said that names and
identifying data should be deleted from the file summaries in order to
protect personal privacy, but that the material prepared should serve
to explain the statement made by Attorney General Levi concerning his
review of the official and confidential files.

Mr. Adams instructed that this request should be conveyed to
Mr. Bassett and that the summaries should be prepared by the Inspection
Division. I telephonically advised Mr, Bassett and during a subsequent
conference between Mr. Adams, Mr. Bassett and me, procedures for
preparation of the summaries were agreed upon.

RECOMMENDATION:

The summaries prepared by the Inspection Division should be

Transmitted herewith are three additional requests from the
Senate Select Committee, two under date of July 8, and one dated
June 30,. which I received yesterday.

Dp

The four-page, 21 item, statement of additional documenta-
tion requested in one of the July 8, letters, and the June 30, let-
ter raise a problem which pertains to "abuse" areas of the "notifi-
cation" letter of June 27. This issue is the subject of my previous
memo to you, and the considerations which are entailed, insofar as
witness testimony, should be, I think, observed here.

The second July 8, request is simply for Manual pages to be
made available.

Please arrange for the preparation of appropriate documentary
responses to the requests attached. In the event that there is a
serious problem with response to any of the itemized requests, early
advice to me of that fact would be appreciated, so that I can advise
the Committee and attempt to resolve the problem.

Please alert me to any third agency problems which may arise
with. regard to any of these requests; in a. cursory examination, no
such problem was patent to me. However, I realize that there may be
latent third agency issues, and I will appreciate your advice to this

effect. dh 37 5~

Dear Mr. ELLiff: : :

Your letter of July 8, 1975, requesting, in a four page
addendum, additional materials for the Senate Select Committee's
inguiry, has been received. I have today referred it to the
Federal Bureau of Investigation with a request for the assembly
of appropriate documentary responses. :

Your letter contains a reference, in paragraph 2, to "the
agreement to come forward...". I feel that it is important for me
to remind you that this “agreement to come forward..." was the sub-
ject of a discussion between us on July 2, 1975. at which time I
informed you that the Attorney General was considering a reply to
the reference to such “agreement to come forward..." set forth in.
the letter of June 27, 1975, by the Senate Select Committee. ..

It fs our contimed intention to be cooperative with the
Senate Select Committee, arxi we will, of course, move as expeditiously
as possible to prepare documents responsive to the requests of the
Comittee. However, as I advised you on July 2, the FBI follows,

~ quite properly, a careful clearance procedure as to intelligence mate-

rials which are to be assembled for transmission to the Comittee, or
for Committee access. This clearance procedure takes time, and
requires tne undivided attention of Sentor Bureau Executives. ‘These
Executives are woriing at full capacity in attemts to meet the exist-
ing requests fron the Committee and to carry out their other duties at
the same time. As you have suggested, in your letter of July 8, your

four page additional request will be so handled as to impose no more
delay on the previously requested itezs than is inevitable. ‘The
request will be accorded an appropriate priority to ensure that respon-
sive itens are supplied as they become ready for transmission to the
Senate Select Comittee.

Dear Mr. O'Connor:

Pursuant to Section III. A. of the notification:
attached to the Committee's letter of June 27, 1975, I am
forwarding herewith an additional-request for materials
which relate to this matter.

i" The specificity of this request is not, of :
course, intended to limit in any way the agreement to come
forward with.all relevant information and materials, includ-
ing documents, whether or not they have been brought tc the
Committee's attention or have been specifically requested

As Mr. Schwarz and I indicated in our meeting
with you a few days ago, there are still outstanding sev-
eral items relating to this matter which the Committee re-
quested some time ago. This request should in no way delay
.further the availability of the previously requested items,
and we would expect that individual items will be supplied
whenever they become separately ready for submission.

Your cooperation is appreciated.

Y

i " Attached is a request for further detailed information from
. Senate Select Committee, regarding’ COENTELPRO, from Mr. ELMiff dated

duly 1, 1975. .
“Please note that tigis matter is considered aii characterized
as an "abuse" (see page 21 of enclosures to SSC letter of. June 27,

previously forwarded); accordingly; any Agent interview would be an
“abuse interview" subject to the strictures set forth in the "Outline

for Inquiry’ Procedures" referenced in the SSC letter of June 27.
Bécause of this, I feel we should discuss the procedures for inter-
-° -°. view which may be sought under page 2, paragraph "Interviews" of
. Me. ELliff's attached letter. It may be that thé matter should be
. discussed with the Deputy Attorney General as well, after Mr. Levi
. has responded to the SSC letter of June 27. A significant legal
: problem may be presented by the compulsion of Agents' appearance.
Please also note the attached Departmentel decision on the interpre-
tation of "demand" in 28 C.F.R., 16.21 et. seq. This decision will

bear on our resolution of the pending legal problem.
In the meantime, please arrange for the preparation of an

appropriate reply’ enclosing a collection of appropriate documentary
material responsive to this letter; I have acknowledged Mr. E11iff's

‘ letter today (a copy of my letter is attached).

‘+ fhe meaning oF "demand!" is not, indicated, beyond subpoena, in

the C.F.R. sections inficated. This omission creates a need for an

interpretation, for purposes of uniform Department of Justice reaction.
Sfeerrnsee eatinter ;

Outlines for inquiry proceedings were agreed upon between the
White House and the Senate Select Committee on June 13, 1975, and a
copy of those procedures 1@s furnished to the Department on June 16,
1975. Under those guidelines, there is a general undertaking by the
Committee to identify witnesses to tne Agenty a reasonable time before
the interviews occur. This general rule includes current and former
employees; certain exceptions (not clearly defined) are indicated in
. the guidelines. The Committee is required to provide the witness with
. a copy of the procedures, and "relevant waivers of secrecy oaths or
. . | agreements for the purpose of this inquiry". The Conmittee is required
to give prior notice of an interview, generally, specifying: (a) sub-
_ Ject area; (b) periods of employment; (c) the date set for the interview.

Since these structured procedures, taken with the rules of the
Subcommittee, may create a requirement of testimony upon witnesses, it
seems to me clear that the paragraphs of 28 C.F.R., 8 16.21, et. sea.,
which refer to 'demand" should be interpreted to include any request
by any Committee staff member to interview any employee, former employee
or other person connected with the’ Department of Justice. ;

’ This interpretation requires certain action: (1) that the wit~
my ness be authorized to speak under 8 16.23 by an appropriate Department
"Official; and, (2) that an appropriate Department Official be designat:
I would think that the appropriate Department Official for the FBI show
be the Director of the FBI or the FBI General Counsel, in coordination
with this office. a

July 9, 1975

The Honorable Edward H. Levi ,
Attorney General

U. S. Department of Justice

Washington, D. C. 20530

Dear Mr. Attorney General:

We have received a letter from Clarence M. Kelley, Director
of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, dated July 7, 1975,
requesting to meet with us for a discussion of certain
materials pertaining to the FBI which were compiled by the
Commission on CIA Activities Within the United States and
may now be in the possession of the Select Committee. The
Committee welcomes this opportunity for discussion with

Mr. Kelley of these and other matters of concern both to
the FBI and to the Committee. Our reply to Mr. Kelley is
addressed to you because we believe it is essential that
you participate in this meeting in order to arrive ata
mutual understanding among the Justice Department, the FBI,
and the Committee.

Prompt discussion is especially important because of the
Committee's concern about the status of certain requests
for documents. On May 14, 1975, the Committee wrote to you
requesting documents pertaining to a number of areas of in-
quiry. The status of the May 14 request was considered by
the full Committee on July 8, 1975. The Committee's review
of the responses to this request indicates that, although
certain documents have been supplied, others in areas of
the most vital concern to the Committee are still outstand-
ing. A summary of the outstanding items from the May 14
request is attached.

The Honorable Edward H. Levi

Page Two : July 9, 1975

As has already been made clear to members of your staff,
the failure of the Justice Department and the FBI to
respond fully to the Committee's request has severely ham-
pered our investigative work. Since the Committee is now
receiving excellent cooperation from the White House and
other agencies on highly sensitive matters, and indeed
from the Justice Department and the FBI on assassination
matters, we are at a loss to understand what special diffi-
culties are presented by the May 14 request.

The Committee has concluded that these issues cannot ade-
quately be resolved by further staff discussions and,
accordingly, that the only responsible way to proceed is
for the Committee itself to take up the problem with you
and the Director of the FBI. Therefore, we are pleased
that FBI Director Kelley's request for a meeting gives us
an opportunity to.invite you and Mr. Kelley to appear be-
fore the Committee in executive session during the week of
July 14, 1975. The purpose of this meeting is to discuss
the matters of concern to Mr. Kelley and the steps which
might be taken to expedite response to requests for docu-
ments essential to the Committee's inquiry. :

The members of the Committee look forward to this meeting

as a way to resolve issues of common concern in a spirit

of comity between the Executive ong/figieletiys Branches.

Outstanding FBI Documents

On May 14, 1975, the Select Committee advised the Attorney
General and the FBI of its request for certain documents
which the Committee believed were necessary to begin an
effective investigation of FBI intelligence activities.
The following is a review of the responses of the Justice
Department and the FBI to this request as of July 8, 1975.
The topics in this outline are based on the case studies
included in the notifications submitted to the Attorney
General and the FBI on June 27, 1975. (The numerous addi-
tional requests addressed to the Attorney General and the
FBI since May 14, 1975,. are not included in this summary.)

"Use of the resources of the FBI to gather
political intelligence. Our review disclosed
a few documented instances in which the Bureau
at times during the course of an election
campaign was requested to provide -- and did
indeed provide -- information which could be
used as political intelligence information.

In one instance, this involved a check of FBI
files on the staff of a campaign opponent.

“Improper use of the FBI in connection with
the political process. In a few instances
recorded in Bureau files, an incumbent Presi-
dent caused the FBI to gather intelligence
relating to a political convention under cir-
cumstances that although cast in legitimate
law enforcement terms could-- and some would
say should -- have been suspected of being
politically motivated.

“Use of the FBI to report on certain activi-
ties of critics of an Administration's policies.
The FBI files document a few instances in which
an incumbent President caused the Bureau to
report on certain activities of Members of
Congress who were opposed to and critical of
his policies.

"Use of information in the FBI files to respond
to or discredit critics. Again, the Bureau
files document a very small number of instances
in which derogatory information legitimately
obtained by the Bureau was disseminated to
other members of the Executive Branch to enable
them to discredit their critics.

"Use of the FBI in connection with other legiti-
mate law enforcement activities. There was one
documented instance where the FBI was used to
conduct an inquiry for what might be described
as political purposes, relating to an investiga-
tion properly conducted by other Executive
Branch officials." (C.23.)
