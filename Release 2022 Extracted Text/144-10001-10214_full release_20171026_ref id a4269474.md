December 3, 1975

Mr. Thomas K. Latimer

Special Assistant to the Secretary

OSD 3E941, The Pentagon

Washington, D.C. 20301

Dear Tom:

We have reviewed the Oswald files you furnished by letter

oi November 20, 1975, and have the following additional requests

relating to this investigation.

1.

Oswald was hospitalized from October 27, 1957, to Novem-

ber 16, 1957, at the Naval Hospital at Yokosuka,

Japan, for treat-

ment of a gunshot wound. He later was court-martialed for the

wounding incident.

He was hospitalized again in October 1958.

We would like to obtain a copy of Oswald's Marine medical file,

as well as any other documents relating to the incident or treat-

ments.

We also would like to know whether his medical file was

furnished to the Warren Commission or to any other investigative

agency following his death.

2. The Oswald files we received do not include his Marine

pay records. Robert Anson, in his recently published They've

Killed the President, claims that Oswald's duty assignments, as

reflected in his pay records, do not coincide with the chronology

of his duty assignments given the Warren Commission.

Anson furch-

ex claims that a key portion of Oswald's pay records for August-

October 1958 are "censored." We would like someone familiar with

Marine Corps personnel and pay records

to review Oswald's to de-

termine whether any discrepancy exists and to report his

find-

ings to the Committee. We also wish to obtain a copy of Oswald's

pay records.

3.

Anson also claims that U.S. Army Intelligence was involved

in protecting the President in Dalias and a Special Agent James

W. Powell was in the Book Depository.

We would like to

interview

Mr. Powell and wish to have his current address. In addition, we

wish to. obtain a copy of the Department of Army's memorandum on

safeguarding the President which was prepared in response to a re-

quest from the Warren Commission but which OSD did not transmit

to the Commission because it did not agree with the memorandum.

4.

We would like access to all existing records of the

Army's 112th Military Intelligence Group as they relate to its

activities

in Dallas in 1963 and would like the name and current

address of the Commanding Officer of the Group and the agent in

charge of the Dallas field office in 1963.

5. We would like access to all Department of Defense rec-

ords, including those of Army and Air Force Intelligence, related

to Lee Harvey Oswald and to the assassination of President Kenne-

dy.

6. The files we received on Oswald do not contain several

documents referenced by other documents in those files

pertain-

ing to Oswald.
