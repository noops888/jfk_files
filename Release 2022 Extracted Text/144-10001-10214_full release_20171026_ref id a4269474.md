Mr. Thomas K. Latimer

Special Assistant to the Secretary
OSD 3E941, The Pentagon
Washington, D.C. 20301

Dear Tom:

We have reviewed the Oswald files you furnished by letter
of November 28, 1975, and have the following additional requests
relating to this investigation.

1. Oswald was hospitalized from October 27, 1957, to Novem-
ber 16, 1957, at the Naval Hospital at Yokosuka, Japan, for treat-
ment of a gunshot wound. He later was court-martialed for the
wounding incident. He was hospitalized again in October 1958.

We would like to obtain a copy of Oswald's Marine medical file,
as well as any other documents relating to the incident or treat-
ments. We also would like to know whether his medical file was
furnished to the Warren Commission or to any other investigative
agency following his death.

2. The Oswald files we received do not include his Marine
pay records. Robert Anson, in his recently published They've
Killed the President, claims that Oswald's duty assignments, as
reflected in his pay records, do not coincide with the chronology
of his duty assignments given the Warren Commission. Anson furth-
er claims that a key portion of Oswald's pay. records for Augus
October 1958 are "censored.'' We would like someone familiar wi
Marine Corps personnel and pay records to review Oswald's to de-
termine whether any discrepancy exists and to report his find-
ings to the Committee. We also wish to obtain a copy of Oswald's
pay records.

3. Anson also claims that U.S. Army Intelligence was involved
in protecting the President in Dalias and a Special Agent James
W. Powell was in the Book Depository. We would like to interview
Mr. Powell and wish to have his current address. In addition, we
wish to obtain a copy of the Department of Army's memorandum on
safeguarding the President which was prepared in response to a re-
quest from the Warren Commission but which OSD did not transmit

to the Commission because it did not agree with the memorandum.

4. We would like access to all existing records of the
Army's 112th Military Intelligence Group as they relate to its
activities in Dallas in 1963 and would like the name and current
address of the Commanding Officer of the Group and the agent in
charge of the Dallas field office in 1963.

5. We would like access to all Department of Defense rec-
ords, including those of Army and Air Force Intelligence, related
to Lee Harvey Oswald and to the assassination of President Kenne-
dy.

6. The files we received on Oswald do not contain several
documents referenced by other documents in those files pertain-
ing to Oswald.
