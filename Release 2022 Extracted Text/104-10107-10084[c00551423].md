the Office of Security, which carried with it the inference that

he had been privy to all the reports Roberts gave to the FBI.

Roberts was told that I had dealt with Mr. Hogan's office, the

New York District Attorney, and Mr. Morgenthau, the United

States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, and had

talked with Herbert Itkin personally Roberts was fully cooper-

ative during the entire debriefing and did not hesitate to discuss

any topics.

4. We concluded that (Roberts has not been involved in any

of Itkin's illegal activities since Roberts has been an employee of

CIA. It is my opinion that Boberts)is ah individual with a strong

sense of dedication to principles so long as they result in what he

considers a worthwhile sense of accomplishment.

significant to mention this asfessment sinceR obelta does not give

the impression of having been motivated solely by monetary rewards

in any of his activities.

This lack of concern for money was dis-

turbing during certain phases of the debriefing because Boberts)03

was rather vague about the amount of income he received from the

law firm of itkin, Roberts and Greenbaum)of He stated that he used

a drawing account and only took what was needed for his living

expenses!? Roberts) gives the impression of being a proud individual

who is not prone to admit to his personal deficiencies. The

O (LAGLOBE files contain several references to admonitions given

by station representatives to

" (Roberts)for non-achievement in the

operational field.

Although Roberts) did not allude to these

admonitions voluntarily, he did discuss them when asked.

5. It was our feeling that Roberts) did not discuss with

Herbert Itkin his employment with CIA, nor did he discuss with

Itkin his earlier reporting activities to the FBI.ยบ3Roberts)was

not aware of Itkin's relationship to CLA and did not know of

Mario Brod's affiliation with CIA.

6 After the debriefing had been concluded, (Roberts) was

told of the possible exposure of his employment with CLA by

Itkin's defense counsel, F. Lee Bailey, should Itkin be tried in

the New York state court. Roberts) appeared to be genuinely

disturbed and expressed bitter feelings toward Itkin since he

Mr. (Roberts left Frankfurt for Dakar the night of

21 February and was told to continue with his disengagement

plans as his departure from Dakar had already been announced

to his local contacts.

It was suggested that Roberts) take a boat 03

from Dakar to Marseille. After his arrival in Marseille, (Roberts)

was to proceed to Austria and take a ski vacation which is con-

sistent with earlier vacation plans when he traveled from Dakar

to Austria during the month of March for skiing in previous

years. Roberts has been instructed to remain in contact with

OLBGLOBE so that further instructions can be furnished him when

a firm estimate of future events with regard to the Itkin trial

can be decided.
