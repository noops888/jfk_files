SECRET.

?: MAP 1971

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Central Cover Staff

ATTENTION

SUBJECT

: Ms. Martin J. Lukoskie

: Robert A. MAHEU

03 1. On 3 March 1971 I received a telephone call from

(Frank Monas? an Agency omployee assigned to the Retirement

Affaira Division, Office of Personnel. He asked 11 I knew an

Ed Mullio, who was a formes Agency employee.. I replied in

the affirmative. He statod that Mullin had just called him and

was interested in talking with me regarding his present position.

He stated that Mullin la presently employed by an organization

known as Intertel. I immediately recognized this outfit to be the

group recently employed by Howard Hughes to take over the

operation formerly performed by Maheu Associates.

2. In my subsequent convereation with Mullio, be advised

that he recently retired from Government and bas taken employment

with Intertel. He described this organization as one that looks into

operations of large corporations to ascertain whether any of their

annots are being directed toward activities controlled by organized

crime. He cited the National Football League an one of their clients.

They also bave been engagod by Howard Hugher to look into hla Las

Vegas operation which was formerly managed by Mabeu. Mullin

who served in the DDP while in the Agency seemed to recall that

Maheu had some connection with us, but admitted he knew very

little about the association. He stated that he had spent several

weeks in Las Vegas going over the records pertinent to the tranaier

of the administration of the Hughes interests to his organization, and

he would like guidance from us as to what he should do should they

develop Agency connections with the Maheu organization.

3. One of the things that concerns Mullin le that in

perusing the material, they have noted that soveral of the recorde

are minning. They want to be sure that if Mahou states that these

particular records were purged from the files because they pertain

to sensitive Goverament operations, this in actually the case and

not a nubterfuge to withhold pertinent information which could be

uned in the forthcoming law sult involving Hughes and Maheu.

4. I told Mullin that we may have on certain occasions

used Maheu in the paat possibly for cover purpones. I further

told him that I was reasonably sure there wan no connection with

him at the present time.

5. He asked whom he should contact within the Agency

should any questions arito during the course of their investigation.

I told him that I should be the point of contact. He reiterated that

he wanted to do all he could to preclude any embarrassment or

compromise of Agency operations and would be in touch with me

for any guidance in this regard.

6. On 15 Marchil 971 Mullin called me from Las Vegas and

stated that in investigating one of Maheu's operations, he ran across

the name of(Michael Merbige) who purportedly recently represented

Maheu'e Interests in(Quito, Ecuador) In checking into the background

of this individual, he noted that he had previounly been associated

with an import-expost firm in Miami prlor to coming with Maheu.

He was calling to determine whether we had any interest in this

individual, and if so, how should he handle this facet of his Investi-

gation. I advised him that the name meant nothing to me, but l

would check and cell him back. He informed me that he was planning

to leave for (Quito in the next day or two, but in the meantime, could

be contacted at the Frontier Hotel, phone code 702, 135-9182.

7. Our secords show that (Merbige) war lasued a Covert

Security Approval on 19 December 1967 for utilization (n Ecuador)

1970.

8. A chock of Mullin's security file shows that he resigned

from CIA on 31 July 1961 to go with the Department of Justice.

An of 11 February 1969 an approval of lialson was lasuod to Mullio

who was then identifled as Chlef, Intelligence and Organized Crime

DiviBIon, Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drups, Department

of Justica. His security file in entirely clear.

9. While I have nover had a close assoclation with Mullis,

I have known him for approximately twenty-three years; first as

a fellow Special Agent in the FBI and later during bia tenure wita

the Agency. Nothing has ever come to my attention to question

his Integrity and concern to do what would be in the best interest

of his country. I am inclined to belleve that ble offer to assist us

1n any way to preclude the nurfacing of our utilization of Maheu ls

sincaro..

10. In discussing this matter with the Director of Security,

It was his feeling that we advice Mullin that the Agency bad an

Interest in some of Merbige 'activitles in (Ecuador) but they bavo

been terminated; and further, there in no Agency connoction with

the waheu organization at the present. However, should any further

questions arise concerning Merhige, me should ask him to contact

as for further discussion.

11. I have promised to call Mullin in the very near future

and would appreciate early comments on the handling of this matter.
