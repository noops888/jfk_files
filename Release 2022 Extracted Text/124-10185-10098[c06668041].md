The Legal Attache, Tokyo, reported by letter dated
September 22; 1958,/that Colonel Tenorio, Chief of Police,
Manila,\ was a paid, Nighly regarded, and very sensitive ae od
of CIA, JeThis information was given to the Legal Attache by
Colonel John B. Stanley,] G2 Head in Japan, According to (Stanley]©@ :
CIA did not want this information to be known to other agencies;
particularly the FBI. The Director's notation was, “Some more
of CIA double dealingy H." (Letter from Legat, Tokyo, dated
September 22, 1958, "Investigations in Hong Kong and Manila,
Philippines")

40. ALLEGED CIA INCOMPETENCE

During the period October 20-25, 1958, Bureau
representatives attended a seminar at Orlando, Florida, which, »- +.
was given by the U.S. Air Force. Among the activities was a Ee
lecture given by |John B. Corbett_of cra, ] Subsequent to the(S
briefing, General Millard Young of. the Air Force confided to
Bureau representatives and_expressed his displeasure with the ,
briefing given by (Corbett. ] He was particularly critical of
(Corbett 's [reluctance to fiirnish certain information, using the S)

Xcuse that the matter was of a "Top Secret" nature. General
Young stated that the position taken by Gorbe teas only an(S)
excuse for incompetence on the part of . . ~

' This item is being cited in the event we desire to
use the foregoing as evidence to support a position that we were
obliged to be circumspect in dealing with CIA. (Memorandum

Seminar, Orlando Air Force Base, Orlando, Florida, October 20-25,
1958") -

t

- The overthrow of the Batista Government on January ot

questions concerning the efficiency and competence of U.S. intel- -
sa ligence. Allen Dulles indicated that future developments would

show that many more people were involved in the Castro organi- -
zation than the U.S. Government had realized. Information

coming to-our attention suggested the possibility that both

State and CIA had failed to assess developments in Cuba properly.

The foregoing is cited in e event that we found
reason to question the competency os fata in Cuba] This coulé6)
be useful if we wanted to justify the existence of a Legal : oer
Attache office in Havana. One could also comment that poor ~
coverage in Cuba had an indirect and adverse effect on our
operations in the United States. :

; . 42, [lzsmar N. KOSTYUK

By letter dated April 25, 1959, we voiced our
objections to CIA for giving guidance to an individual with
whom we had been maintaining contact for, the purpose of developing
him as a double agent. The individual involved was/Dr. William
andoiph Lovelace II,]a well-known expert in the field of iS

43. ALLEGED BELITTLING OF COMMUNISM BY ALLEN DULLES

In July, 1959, Allen Dulles of CIA Spoke at the
National Strategy Seminar of the National War College. One '
N, of the professors handling the Seminar was critical of. Dulles. 7 i
i He claimed that Dulles had belittled the importance of the ;
communist problem.) ::

., On February 7, 1962, [SEGRE Sheffield Edwards,

Director of Security, CIA, informed the Liaison Agent that
CIA was preparing a report containing extremely sensitive
information. He stated that this information came: from a
sensitive source and he was not certain as to how it should
be handled, As a result of a discussion with Edwards on
February 26, 1962, it was afer owl ov that CIA had maintained

a technical surveillance onfKarlow{over an extended period.
Edwards explained that he had been reluctant to identify this
-gource at an earlier date because he feared that prosecution
could have been jeopardized and, furthermore, he did not want
his Agency embarrassed in the event the Bureau objected to

CIA maintaining a capability such as technical surveillances.

It was made emphatically.clear to Edwards that it was absolutely
necessary that we be provided with all the details and, further-
more, that CIA, at the outset, should have apprised us of the
lexistence of the coverage. The Director made the notation,

J"] only wish we would eventually realize CIA can never be
depended upon to deal forthrightly with us. Certainly my
skepticism isn't based on prejudice nor suspicion, but on
specific instances of all too many in number.’ Yet, there
exists wistful belief that the ‘leopard has changed his
spots,' H." (Memorandum Branigan to’ Sullivan February 27,
1962, ["Unknown Subject; KGB Agent Kaown 25 "sacha!" | 6)

56. é SAAC _MONCARZ 1 (9

In February, 1962, the Liaison Agent was requested

to discuss with CIA a case which, in our opinion, clearly
indicated CIA had failed to keep us appropriately informed
of developments, The Bureau's original interest was initiated
in Miami as a result of a discussion with CIA personnel in that
city. Attempts to get CIA replies via correspondence were

- negative, On February 13, 1962, the Liaison Agent discussed “
the matter with CIA and received a reply which did not adequately
satisfy the Bureau's request. (Memorandum Donahoe to Sullivan, 7

Sometime prior to the Bay of Pigs fia 7

sco, CIA had ae

become involved in a weird plan designed to bring about the
assassination of Fidel Castro. One of the principal ingredients
of this plan was to. be the utilization of U.S, hoodlums. CIA :
established contact with Robert Maheu, former Bureau Agent, who
served as. the intermediary in dealings with the notorious
hoodlum, Sam Giancana. (<) a :

The entire operation fell apart when we developed
information indicating that Maheu was behind a wire tapping
operation in Nevada, Potentially, there were elements for
possible violation of unauthorized publication or use of
communications, However, prosecution was out of the question
because of the tainted involvement of CIA. (Arthur James Balletti,
"Unauthorized Publication or Use of Communications" and memo-
randum from the Director to Mr. Tolson, dated May 10, 1962)

58. [aunin ODIO TAMA oKS)

In October, 1962, we lodged a protest with CIA
because the Agency initiated operation of Cuban agents in the
Miami area and in so doing violated Bureau jurisdiction,
Arrangements were subsequently effected where the source in
the matter was turned over to the Bureau for handling, (iMemo-

60, ALLEGED ATTACK ON BUREAU BY JOHN McCONE

‘ |
. . We received information in December, 1963, indicating
that John McCone, Director of CIA, allegedly was attacking the :
Bureau in what would appear to be a vicious and underhanded |
manner, McCone allegedly informed Congressman Jerry Ford and =
Drew Pearson that CIA had uncovered a plot in Mexico City :
indicating that Lee Harvey Oswald had received $6,500 to
assassinate President Kennedy. The story attributed to McCone
appeared to be related ‘to information which had come from one |
Gilberto Alvarado, a Nicaraguan national, Interrogation of nuh |
Alvarado, including a polygraph, disclosed that he had fabricated
his story. This had been made known to CIA and to McCone, There-
fore, if McCone had made the above statements to Ford and Pearson, |
it would appear that it would have been an obvious attempt to |
ridicule the Bureau, The Liaison Agent contacted McCone on
December 23, 1963, McCone vehemently denied the allegations. |
