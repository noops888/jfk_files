During the period October 20-25, 1958, Bureau

representatives attended a seminar at Orlando, Florida, which

was given by the U.S. Air Force.

lecture given by John B. Corbett_ of CIA. Subsequent to the S

briefing, General Millard Young of the Air Force confided

Bureau representatives and expressed his displeasure with

the

briefing given by Corbett. He was particularly critical of S

Corbett's reluctance to furnish certain information, using the

(S)

excuse that the matter was of a "Top Secret" nature.

General

Young stated that the position taken by Corbettwas only ans

excuse for incompetence on the part of CiA.

This item is being cited in the event we desire to

use the foregoing as evidence to support a position that we were

obliged to be circumspect in dealing

with CIA. (Memorandum

"Joint Strategic Planning

Seminar, Crlando Air Force Base, Orlando, Florida, October 20-25,

1958"')

41. CIA COVERAGE IN CUBA PRIOR TO OVERTEROW OF BATISTA GOVERMENT

The overthrow of the Batista Government on January 1,

1959, and the subsequent assumption of power by Castro raised

questions concerning the efficiency and competence of U.S. intel-

ligence. Allen Dulles indicated that future

developments would

show that many more people were involved in the Castro organi-

zation than the U.S. Government had realized.

Information

coming to.our attention suggested the possibility that both

State and CIA had failed to assess developments in Cuba properly.

The foregoing is cited in the event that we found

reason to question the competency of CIA in Cuba. This could

be useful if we wanted to justify the

of a Legal

Attache office in Havana.

One could also comment that poor

"coverage in Cuba had an

indirect and adverse effect on our

operations in the United States.

42.

MIKHAIL N. KOSTYUK (S

By letter dated April 25, 1959, We voiced our

objections to CIA for giving guidance to an individual with

whom we had been maintaining contact for the purpose of developing

him as a double agent.

The individual involved was Dr. William

Randolph Lovelace II, a well-known expert in the field of

(5)

medical research as It applied to space flying: Lovelace was

also a contract agent of ClA and had occasion to handle sensitive

matters for that Agency *Inapril, 1959, Lovelace was preparing

(5)

to make a trip to Moscow.

CIA briefed him on matters as they

applied to his trip. The Agency also interviewed him concerning

his relationship with the subject in Washington, D. C., and,

furthermore, gave him guidance concerning the relationship.

He objected to CIA giving any guidance to Lovelace concerningS

is contacts with the subject without first consulting with us.

43. ALLEGED BELITTLING OF COMMUNISM BY ALLEN DULLES

In July, 1959, Allen Dulles of CIA spoke at the

National Strategy Seminar of the National War College. One

of the professors handling the Seminar was critical of Dulles.

He claimed that Dulles had belittled the importance of the

communist problem.

The above is being cited in the event we desire to

utilize the information in justifying a position that it was

necessary to be circumspect with CIA. (Memorandum W. C. Sullivan

to Belmönt, August 14,

1969, "National Strategy Seminar, National

War College, July, 1959")

"TRUE" MAGAZINE ARTICLE - SEPTEMBER, 1959

In September, 1959, "True" magazine carried an

article captioned "Allen Dulles:

America's Global Sherlock,"

which included information of a derogatory nature concerning

the Director and the Bureau.

The article precipitated a crisis

## Page 6

On February 7, 1962; Colonel Sheffield Edwards,

Director of Security, CIA, informed the Liaison Agent that

CIA was preparing a report containing extremely sensitive

information.. He stated that this information came from a

sensitive source and he was not certain as to how it should

be handled.

As a result of a discussion with Edwards on

February 26, 1962,

it was ascertained that CIA had maintained

& technical

surveillance on/Karlow over an extended period. S

Edwards explained

that he had been reluctant to identify this

•source at an earlier date because he feared that prosecution

could have been jeopardized and, furthermore, he did not want

his Agency embarrassed in the event the Bureau objected to

CIA maintaining a capability such as technical surveillances.

It was made emphatically.clear to Edwards that it was absolutely

necessary that we be provided with all the details and, further-

more, that CIA, at the outset, should have apprised us of the

existence of the coverage.

The Director made the notation,

"I only wish we would eventually realize CIA can never be

depended upon to deal forthrightly with us.

Certainly my

skepticism isn't based on prejudice nor suspicion, but on

specific instances of all too many in number. Yet, there

exists

wistful belief that the 'leopard has changed his

(Memorandum Branigan to Sullivan February 27,

56.

ISAAC MONCARZ

In February, 1962,

the Liaison Agent was requested

to discuss with CIA a

case which, in our opinion, clearly

indicated CIA had failed to keep us appropriately inforned

of developments.

The Bureau's original interest was initiated

in Miami as a result of a discussion with CIA personnel in

city.

Attempts to get CIA replies via correspondence were

negative. On February 13, 1962,

the Liaison Agent discussed

the matter with CIA and received a reply which did not adequately

satisfy the Bureau's request.

February 27, 1962, and Brennan to Sullivan, March 2, 1962; Bureau

CIA WIRE TAPPING IN THE UNITED STATES

5,

Sometime prior to the Bay of Pigs fiasco, CIA had

becone involved in a weird plan designed to bring about the

assassination of Fidel Castro.

One of the principal ingredients

of this plan was to be the utilization of U.S. hoodlums.

CIA

established contact with Robert Maheu, former Bureau Agent, who

served as the intermediary

in dealings with the notorious

hoodlum, Sam Giancana.

Information indicating that Maheu was behind a wire tapping

operation in Nevada.

Potentially, there were elements for

possible violation of unauthorized publication or use of

communications. However, prosecution was out of the question

because of the

tainted involvement of CIA.

"Unauthorized Publication or Use of Communications" and memo-

randum from the Director to Mr. Tolson, dated May 10, 1962)

ALVIN ODIO TAMAYOIS

In October, 1962, we lodged a protest with CIA

because the Agency initiated operation of Cuban agents in the

Miami area and in so doing violated Bureau jurisdiction.

Arrangements were subsequently effected where the source in

the matter was turned over to the Bureau for

handling.

randum Brennan to Sullivan, October 29, 1962, "Alwin Odio

Tamayo"' ](5)

THELMA RINGTS)

On April 23: 1963: CIA requested that the Bureau

establish coverage on a visiting Panamanian national.

WeS)

immediately instituted investigation and then determined that

CIA actually had been instrumental in supporting the subject's

trip to the United States. CIA had been endeavoring to recruit

the subject. On April 29, 1963, a strong protest was lodged

with General Carter, Deputy Director of CIA. (Memorandum

Brennan to Sullivan, April 26, 1963, "Thelma Ring"'] (5)

60. ALLEGED ATTACK ON BUREAU BY JORN MCCONE

We received information in December, 1963, indicating

that John McCone, Director of CIA, allegedly was attacking the

Bureau in what would appear to be a vicious and underhanded

Manner. McCone allegedly informed Congressman Jerry Ford and

Drew Pearson that CIA had uncovered a plot in Mexico City

indicating that Lee Harvey Oswald had received $6,500 to

assassinate President Kennedy. The story attributed to McCone

appeared to be related to information which had come from one

Gilberto Alvarado, a Nicaraguan national.

Interrogation of

Alvarado, including a polygraph, disclosed that he had fabricated

his story.. This had been made known to CIA and to Mccone.

There-

fore, if McCone had made the above statements to Ford and Pearson,

it would appear that it would have been an obvious attempt to

ridicule the Bureau.

The Liaison Agent contacted McCone on

December 23, 1963.

McCone vehemently denied the allegations.

Brennan to Sullivan, December 23, 1963, "Relations

With CIA"')
