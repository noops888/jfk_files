supjrct: Attempted R.I.8. Penetration of Bell Telephone Labs
i i Ref: MY Reyorts 2908-3 and 2969-3 :

1. We thought the attached reports would be of interest to Lincoln
Staff froma Boviet realities standpoint. We also felt that they should
de brought to the attention of Division management because the M.0. out-
lined therein is becoming a mJjor factor in dealing with sources who have -
contact vith Scvbloc nationals. It has been our experience that the type
of activity outlined has been on a mrked increase, particularly since
the establishment of the KOB 10th Directorate. Although such activity
by Sov legals is taking place throughout the continental U.3., undoubtedly
its greatest impact is being felt in the Nev York and Washington, D.C.
“areas because of the largs Soviet Government establisharnts in both of
these cities. For this reason it vould seem imperative that both WAFO
and MYFO be extremely vigilant for auch activity in companies and insti-
tutions with which they are dealing in order that it my be recognized
im its earliest stages anf appropriate CI/CE countermeasures instituted.
In order to assist other offices in this reapect, ve plan to write in the
Bear futufe an article for the Division Newsletter, outlining sone of our
experiences along these lines.

_. 2+ We were somewhat disappointed in CI Staff's reaction to our
Tecent request for assistance in defensive briefing of the subject of
one of the attached reports. It seems to be quite clear nov that our
original assumption concerning his being R.I.8. targeted was quite correct
and that there ie a strong Likelinood that his current trip behind the
Curtain will be utilized by the opposition for provocation and/or an
actual recruitment attempt. We wonder in future cases of this nature
exactly vhat support ve may expect from Angleton's shop. Although we
“feel ‘that we have a fair capability for handling such matters hero in
Hew York; we do admit that, at least on this one, we would have felt
slightly more confortable had « CI specialist been along, if for no other
reason than to preclude any possible Monday morning quarterbacking by the

Subject: Attempted R.I.8. Penetration of Bell Telephone Laba

3. Judging dy the’ attached mterial, it vould appear that, despite
established Bell ‘policy (see our 16 May memorandum re Case 39,790), the
opposition :has seen fit to deflower at least tvo of Bell's scientific
virgins. We serfously wonder at this point just how many other Bell
people might be in the sane boat. Perhaps, as a result of all this,
some representation by Bell management to the KOB vill be forthcoming,
spelling out..to that organisation, as was spelled out to our own, estabd=
lished company policy pertaining to such mtters. In any event, it would
appear that at least one or two Bell scientists, and there are probably
more, have been giving the R.I.8. more cooperation and reporting than the
Agency. Let's hope that in the near future Bell management takes some
effective steps to rectify this rather ludicrous, and patently dangerous,
situation.

situations fabricated by the opposition, e.g., women, homosexuals,
purebaee of drugs for Sov citizens, black market activity, acceptance
of letters to mil outside the USSR, commitments to disaffected Sovs,
etc. In addition, we stringently admonished | | against any
notetaking or photography which could in any way be construed as con-
promising. We also alerted to the fact that some attompt
might be made to use his .rife's family as leverage in a recruitment
attempt. In this connection, we pointed out to | lthat there
vas a strong likelihood that the R.I.S. and/or Bulgarian service vould
make an approach to hin during his forthcoming visit to Sofia. An
approach in Bulgaria vould give the Sove on opportunity for disavowal
and also would provide the proper setting for maximm utilization of

US Legation in Sofia, (+ was told that, if any pressure were
applied concsrning his vife's family, his best reaction would probably
de a noncommittal, “I'll think it over vhen I get home?" All in all,
ve alerted ap best we could to the opposition M.0. and pre-
pared him on how best to avoid same of the not so obvious pitfalls
which might be in store for him.

13. Assesament of Subject, a very accomplished
scientist, heads up all acoustics research at Bell. He reads
Hussian and is fluent in German, French, Spanish, Italian, Dutch,
and Zoglish. He impresses us as being a rather savvy, discreet,
cooperative, mature, stable, vell motivated individual. We attrt-

japparent lack of discretion in his dealings with
ee Bove more to the subtlety of the Sov approach than to his om
naivete. It has been our experience that most US businesomen and
scientists are very susceptible and vulnerable to the opposition
approach mainly due to somevhat of a lack of realistic public
e@ucation.cohcerning contacts with Sovbloc nationals. We feel
that | degree of cooyerativeneas vith US services has
been enhanced considerably by his feeling thet he has really been
taken for a ride by the opposition.

Incidentally, when ve asked subject for permission to release this
information with source disclosure to the FBI, he was at firet some-
what apprehensive and expressed the desire to talk it over with one

of bie Bell superiors before he mde eny commitments. He finally
agreed, hovever, when ve convinced him that it vould certainly be in
his best interest to get on record vith the FBI as soon as possible.
of his apprehension about the FBI seemed to be attributable to
the fact that he has just been granted UB citizenship and, in addition,
is now comevhat concerned that bie activities with the Sove in some
way may effect his security status viich in turn could be very detri~

mental to hig career.

Based on our limited contact with we have every reason to
believe that he would be suitable for operational use, should the

bareau choose to pursue such a course.

1k. We would strongly recommend that all of the above be passed
to the Bureau in order that that organization may effect contact
vith snd provide him vith proper guidance concerning any
further approaches by Sov or Bloc nationals in this country.

Pavlov, who apparently was seeing off all of the Sov I.E.E.E. delegates.

Manhattan together and, on parting, exchanged addresses. a

3. A couple of weeks after their initial meting, Pavlov tele-
phoned at his home and told him that Tiel and Trutka had asked
him to send thotr varnest regards to and thank him for the
hompitality which he shoved them during their trip to this country.
During the conversation, Pavlov expressed an interest in renewing his
acquaintance with and suggested that he vould enjoy visiting
him at his home tn Madieon, ew Jersey. said that he would
enjoy seeing Pavlov, but that he wae currently preparing to leave on
a trip to the USSR and Europe and vas not scheduled to return to the

early June vould be a good time for them to plan on getting together.

3. During his recent trip to the USSR, it vould appear that

of opposition fabrication. One involved an approach by a Soviet
interpreter by the name of FHU Petrov, vho took eside and
asked him 1f he could do hima personal favor by getting him a sub-
