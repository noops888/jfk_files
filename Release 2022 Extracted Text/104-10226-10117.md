He thought the attached roports vould be of interest to Incola

Stall tron a soviet roalities standpoint. We also felt that they should

be brought to the attention of Ditialon mongement because the M.O. out -

lined therein 1s boconing & usjor factor 1n doallag with sourcos who have

contact vith sorblos nationals. It has been our experience that the type

of activity outlined has been on a miked Increase, particularly since

the establlahment of the KOB 10th Directorate. Although such activity

by sor logals 1s taking place throughout the continental U.3., undoubtedly

Its greatest impact la being selt in the lier lork and Hashingtos, D.C.

arcan because of the larga sortot dovermment establisherute la both of

these cittes. Por this sranon It rould seen imperative that both HAFO

3. Judging by the attached material, It would appear that, despite

astabliahed Ball policy (dee our 16 May memorandum re Case 39,790), the

opposition has seen ilt to dollover at least tro of Bell's scleatifle

Migli. He pariously yonder at this point just son many other jel

nome representation by Bell managanent to the KAB will be forthcoming,

spelling out to that organization, as vas spelled out to our on, estabi

linked company palley pertaining to such utters. In any evelit, it would

appear that at least one or two Boll sclentists, and there are probably

nore, have been gluing the R. I.8, more cooperation and reporting than the
