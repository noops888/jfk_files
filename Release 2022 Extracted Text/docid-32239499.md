Status of Document:

Postponed in Part

Number of releases of previously postponed information: 6

Reason for Board Action: The Review Board's decision was premised on several factors

including: (a) the significant historical interest in the document in question; (b) the

absence of evidence that the release of the information would cause harm to the United

States or to any individual.

Number of Postponements: 4

Postponements: All the postponements in this document represent Social Security numbers.

Reason for Board Action: The text is redacted because the public disclosure of the redaction could

reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, and that invasion of

privacy would be so substantial that it outweighs the public interest.

RE:

Tom Lambeth

Acting Staff Director

cone Researches

Chief Researche!

Na. Barbara i. Mosley OF

Please be advised that Ms. Barbara Mosley,

resume attached, has been interviewed by Gerald

Hamilton, Jackie

Hess and myself for the position

as secretary/typist assigned to the MLK Research

Task Force.

Ms. Mosley certainly qualifies for this posi-

tion, and we all agree that she is the mature indi-

vidual for whom we are searching to fill this spot.

She has been employed on Capitol Hill for some time

and surely knows the many ins-and-outs.

I strongly recommend that Ms. Mosley be hired

at $12,000 per annum and report for duty on Tuesday,

June Z1, 1977.

Tom, I certainly appreciate your consideration

on this matter. Thank you.
