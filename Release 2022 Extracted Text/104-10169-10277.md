Comment:

This latter Individual 18 now In one of our othor safo

houses and claims to know this man very well and has seen him

mary time's..

It 1a not possible for this individual to know

not use one until after ho had gone into the Argentine Embassy.

Subjoct was also asked 1f ho know the name which was dreamed up

by myself.

Subjoot did not tumblo, but tried to reason out who

1t was.

He apparently was not trying to deceive me on this 1n-

dividual.

Subjoot statod he had seen Raul Castro and Fidel Castro

on one occasion in the Presedential Palace on the 13th of Maroh,

1960.

Subjeot olaims never to have spoken to them or treatod with

them directly.
