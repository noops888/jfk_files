MEMOFARDUM FOR KECORD lO. 7

SUBJECT: General Points Covered in De-Briefing Subject.

1. Subject wes asked if he kmew arycne ty the name of
CARRILLO, Subject was noticably cautious, his reaction changed
quite sharply and then efter some ccnsiteration he said yes he
Amew a doctor by that name, CARKILLO, who was tne judge in a
Place called Guynia de Miranda. Subject stated this individual 7
was a judge for several years until he was taken prisoner and
is now on the Isle of Pines. (De-friefer's Comment: This was
in order to find out if he could come up with, name which }
follows now, Justo CAKRILLOs is ono which [Tom Hewitt}will rece
ognize as having perhaps some significance to this individual.
After somo mulling around he d@ he had heard of his own, I
aid not suggest the name of Justo, he sugrested it himself, -he
mulled it around and he said he had heard of this individual es
being a member of an organization, he had never seen him, he
does not know end he thinks that he is in the United States
The specific significance of this will be examined later. We
en use this as a control question in his examination.)

2. Subject was asked if he knew Aguedo LUGO y Rodriguez.
Subject claims no knowledge of this person at all. (De-Briefer's
Comment: This latter individual is now in one of our other safe
houses and claims to lmow this man very well end has seen him
â€œmany, many times. It is not possible for this individual to know
(for Subject to know) Aguedo by any war name, because the man did
not use one until after he had gone into the Argentine Embassy.)
Subject was also asked if he Imow the name which was dreamed up
by myself. Subject did not tumble, but tried to reason out who
it was. He apparently was not trying to deceive me on this in-
dividual. Subject stated he had seen Raul Castro and Fidel Castro
on one occasion in the Preserential Palace on the 13th of Maroh,

. 1960. Subject claims never to have spoken to them or treated with

. them directly.
