SUBJECT :  Paeszorte of Cubano

1, Mr, Devine, of tho State Department, called on 22 June
and referred to previous discussione with members of WH Divisio:
and of WH/4 concerning Miro Cardona's request for aome 100 psa!
ports of Cubans as well as other personal documents. It was
recalled that Miro Cardona snd Tony Varona, among othere in the
Council,. had raised this question in late April and early May with
Mr, Goodwin and later with Morales Carrion, At that time it wao
understood that'these paoaporte and documents were collected from
volunteers for the invasion forces in Florida ans. held possibly by
the FRO or tte "associates" under an agreement that eald passports
and documento would be turned over to no one other than the person
concerned or his heirs, It was also recalled by Mr. Devine that the
answer to the request of the Council for these documanta was that
aay individual who wanted his documenta should go to the entity to
which he gave it ond make application.. It was also paesed to the
Council that the passporta wore in the Florida area in custody and !
were immediately available to the individual or his heirs, Fora i
time thie seemed to suffice or, at any rate, the inquiries seemed to

stop.

2. Apparently with Miro Cardona's knowledge a fow days ago

a circular was prepared by some Cuban organization and cent to

all people in the Cuban community in Miami who might be interested

in documento or passports, stating that anyone wanting to recover

said documenta should apply to Mr. Hurowitz on the Cuban desk in

7 the Department of State, Mx. Hurowits received in the last day ov i
two some thirty lettero requesting docuinents of ono individual or
another and eventually decided to acknowledge them with a form
letter, stating that no responsibility for sald decuments rested with
the Rate Department. However, the Stata Department would do
what it could to assist in the locating of said documents. Meanwhile



secaet

someone in State has contacted Carlos Piad on the Revolutionary
Council, and has been assured that the circular which had been
going sround'to Cubans will be stopped and Pind will apparently act
88 the Council's point of coordination for the recovery of said

documents.

3. Mr, Devine would like to have ue provide him with some
moro apecial instructions than he presontly hag concerning the pro-
a cedures for the recovery of the documents; also, if we can short
circuit thie process of referral of cases to the State Department in

' Waahington ia any way, he would appreciate it.
