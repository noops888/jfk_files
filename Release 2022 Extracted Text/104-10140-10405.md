MEMORANDUM FOR: S. D. Breckinridge
Deputy Inspector General

FROM : E, H. Knoche, DDCI

SUBJECT : Downing Committee

I have read your memorandum of 14 October to the Deputy
Legislative Counsel. I agree with all the points you have
made in it and would like to be advised if you or Mr. Miller
encounter any problems in carrying out what you suggest.

I am particularly impressed with the need to count on the
full-time participation of members of your working group who are
actively involved in file research. I am interested also in
ensuring that appropriate registry operations are provided for.

Please keep me informed.
