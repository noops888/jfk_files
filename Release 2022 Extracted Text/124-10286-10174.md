Since the possibility exists that the subject may be

going to Israel for other purposes than to accompany her father

since these other purposes may be quite significant in deter-

mining the scope of her Chinese Communist activities, the Bureau is

requested to consider contacting the U. S. Department of State so

that the subject may receive her passport. her activities ir

Israel may then be covered by CIA. g)

relations with

Peking, andit wo

bid be quite signiticant it the
