The Fedora case i(h)(U)

For example, one Soviet officer (cede name Fedora)
began cooperating in May, 1962, He ia on officer of the RGB
{Committee of State Security of the USSR) assigned to the Soviet
Mission te the United Nations. He has gurnished information
regarding approzimately 60 agents being operated by KGB officers
in yarious countries of the world, Six of th: ave aetualiy

This officer eilge furnishes inside information fren
KGB headquarters, For example, John Butenke, an American
engineer, and igor Ivanov, a KGB Amtorg exployse, wore arrested
on eepionnge charges October 29, 1963, Three other KGB officors
attached to the Soviet Medion te the United Nations were expelled
from the United States for their complicity in the conspiracy.
Our defector was able te tell ue of the extrome consternation
at KGB headquarters, One third of the RGB scientific espionage
officers in Yew York bad been lest at one strake.(}(U)

espionage who uses fraudulent documents, elaborate codes, secret

Networks of illegal agenta serve to bolster the espionage activ-
ities of Soviet-blec officiais and are prepared te take over ali
espionage operations in the event of war or other emergency which
resulta in a break of diplomatic relations (3
