A Marr

In response to Mr. Fenn's letter of 14 November 1975 to

Mr. Frank Foster which posed

a number of questions on matters

related to President Kennedy's assassination, the following

information is provided:

NSA has identified some four foreign communications which

mention Lee Harvey Oswald, but has not identified any messages

to or from him.

The four identified messages are Cuban diplomatic

and contain official Cuban comments regarding press items which

discuss Oswald's activity in late September 1963 to obtain a

Cuban visa

to travel to Moscow and also comments on the assina-

tion itself.

The messages are dated in the last week of

November 1963.

NSA has not identified any communications to, from or

mentioning Marina Oswald, Jack Ruby or Earl Ruby.

The specific questions asked and responses follow:

1. Were any of the above names put on a watch list and,

if so, by which agency or individual of the Government?

ANSWER: The name of Oswald was used in searching our data

base immediately following the assassination.

Records from that

time period are virtually non-existent and it is not clear which

agency or individual of the Government requested the search to

be made.

2.

Was product or information concerning the individuals

cited above ever requested by any agency or individual of the

it sate canton

Government or of the Warren Commission? If so, what information

and by whom?

ANSWER: NSA has no record or recollection of such requests.

3. Was product or information concerning the individuals

cited above ever disseminated to any agency or individual of the

Government or of the Warren Commission? If so, what information

and to whom?

ANSWER: The four Cuban diplomatic messages cited above were

disseminated to CIA, DIA, STATE and elements of the Army, Navy

and Air Force.
