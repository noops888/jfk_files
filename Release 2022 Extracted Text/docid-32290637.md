in a shrimp boat operated by Felix Golina, Patterson, Louisiana.

the file review in your office for Felix Golina, Patterson,
Louisiana, and state whether or not there is any indication
he has had previous contacts or been in association with

Bureau informed of further developments.

NOTE: Above information furnished to the Bureau by New Orleans.
This has been the subject of memorandum for the Director and a
letter to the Attorney General. This airtel is submitted to
insure New Orleans remains alert for additional developments.
