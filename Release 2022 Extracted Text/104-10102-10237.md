4 PROJECT AMTRUNK OPERATIONAL REVIEW

I. STATUS REPORT ON TRAINING AND PROCESSING, 4-31 MARCH,

The AMTRUNK Team, consisting of AMICE/27, AMICE/14, AMTRUNK/2,
and AMTRUNK/3 were safehoused on 4 March 1963 at Safesite #164
on Plantation Key. Andrew S. PARMERS, KUROAR instructor from
headquarters, was already at the training site when the team
was brought there by the two case officers, Irving N, PEGGINS
and Hobart J. VANDEBORN. PARMERS remained at the safesite
until 16 March during which time he conducted training in

7 clandestine methods and techniques. This training included
security, cover and compartmentation, clandestine communica-
tions, agent spotting, selection, recruitment and management,
and operational planning and reporting. The training included
group discussion and participation in a series of ‘appropriate
operational situations, several problems, and daily physical
training. During this two week period, either PEGGINS or
VANDEBORN visited the safesite every day, spending an average
of two or three hours with the group in operational dis- .
cussions and processing. During the week of 18 thru 23 March,
both case officers spent a majority of the time with the group,
debriefing them in detail on their operational contacts, workin
out operational details of their infiltration, and continuing
their training on an informal basis. The week of 25 through

: 30 March was spent in PM-type training with emphasis on compass

fo and map reading, including two night problems, and on weapons

: familiarization and firing. During the period under dis-

* cussion the AMTRUNK group were all LCFLUTTERED, were assessed
by the KUROAR assessment team, were given an initial series
of immunizations, were issued clothing, were processed. for
alias documentation, were processed for disguises, and were
further processed on cover and finance problems. ‘The re-
sults of the LCFLUTTER examinations were sent to headquarters
under cover of UFGA-8111, on 13 March 1963. Based on DIR
26430, no further LCFLUTTER is planned at the present time,

the Communists from A secondary and subordinate
Wiission i8 to determine the climate prevailing among the
populace in Havana for organizing resistance elements capable
of either passive or active sabotage. This secondary mission
is exploratory in nature only, through the first phases of
the project. In order to accomplish the foregoitig missions
the operation has beén split into two initial phases, which
will be compartmented from each other. Phase One involves
the black infiltration of AMTRUNK/2_and coast

years, and in some degree experienced in clandestine opera-
tions. He attendedd@Rtngiien ) University in Havana for
two years, majoring in Social Studies. Prior to Fidel's
takeover A/2 was allied to student elements of the Partido
Autentico Which upheld the constitution of 1940, He supported
the revolution against Batista till it became apparent that
Castro had cast his lot for a Communist regime. During his
university years from 1959 to 1961 he was actively engaged
in supporting anti-Castro groups with weapons and materials.

underground were rolled up but A/2 avoided compromise, He

i -a-
2.2 @AMTRUNK/3 a GB ycar old Cuban,in contrast to a/2, is
Qlatile, “immature and impulsiv. On the other hand he is

quite loyal to A/2 and his quick wit is appealing to his
fellow team members. He worked under A/2 in the underground
as an action type, principally engaging in sabotage. His
underground work began while he was in secondary school
when in 1958 he supported the revolution against Batista,
In late 1960 he sided with the counter-revolutionaries and
began full time anti-Castro activities, After the crack
down following the Bay of Pigs invasion he avoided detection
and continued to engage in underground activities, Finally
when the situation became hopeless he left Cuba by air for

: Miami in: 1962, While A/3 has performed satisfactorily
in his tr2 mg up to date, his performance falls far short
of the other three members, A/3 feels KUBARK should onl
function as support for this opodetten and shouted TotTaCST and should not inter
fere in the actual plans of the operation. Fortunately his
role in this operation is comparatively minor and he appears
willing to comply with whatever A/2 decides. Nevertheless,

direct control of A/3 offers problems in the future.

B. TASKS

1. Conduct black infiltration landing at Punta La Jijira
(AMS 3785 I)_and establish contact with the tut manager at

in the(Galexp section

2, Through contacts of A/3 obtain transportation for A/2

to Guanaba or Havana.

3, Although not definite, A/3 may remain at his@ w\,

€Siwy and train assets in maritime reception and clandestine

H communications. Having completed this he would then be ex-
filtrated at Punta Jijira.

4, A/2 will go to Havana and obtain safehouse and operational
support through his contacts.

5. A/2 will contact and develop two potential assets with
high level connections within the Rebel Army.

6. A/2 will train support and operational assets in clandes-
tine communications as well as arrange for transportation for
his exfiltration..

“7. gxfiitration of A/2 at Punta La Jijira or Puerto Escondido

INFIL IL PL.
1. The tentative date for the infiltration of A/2 and 3 at
Punta La J: .is 18 Hay 1963. The infiltrees will make

their way to, @ farm one kilometer from the coast
and from there 4/2 will be provided with transportation to go
to Guanabo or Havana.

2. The exfiltration of A/3 will occur three days after his
infiltration. This arrangment, as yet, is not definite.

3, The exfiltration of A/2 is tentatively planned for 31
May 1963 at Punta La Jijira or Puerto Escondido, A/3 feels
that Puerto Escondido would afford a more secure point for
exfiltration but that a reconnaisance of the area would be
necessary before final decision is reached. Prearranged
telegram signal would indicate his preference.

4, The above dates fall within a favorable moon phase for
maritime operations. In addition the infil-exfil schedule
will allow for an extra margin beyond the 10 days which a/2
considers the minimum acceptable period of time to make his
contacts.

OPERATIONAL ASSETS WITHIN CUBA

1. Following the successful infiltration of A/2 and 3 the

Eventually he was given lesser assignments and A/2

He claims assisted his underground group
during 1961 by supplying trucks for transporting
weapons and materials.

COVER AND COMMUNICATIONS

Cover

A/2 will be issued documentation claiming he is an employee

of a local brewery in Havana. A/3 on the other hand will be
issued documentation as a bus driver within the city of Havana.
Both will also be issued drivers licenses and additional

items such as immunization certificates, Cuban receipts, etc.
The two men will also be outfitted with disguises.

Communications

Primary communications will be established through an SW
system, Both men will be given SW instruction and will be
issued accommodation addresses in Miami, This instruction
and these addresses in turn will be passed on to the recruited
assets in PBRUMEN for use as the operation develops. Pre-
arranged signals will also be devised for use by the team via
telegram to indicate their progress and confirm their place
and time of exfiltration. Both members will also be given an
OWVL system to provide them with quick instructions in case
of an emergency.

QPERATIONAL AND SECURITY EVALUATION

The operational aspects of Phase I portrays a mission which

has considerable potential but also considerable risk. The
area of infiltration is within five miles of a cruise missile
site and its accompanying radar. .In addition boat patrols are
kaown to work this portion of the coast at frequent intervals,
Once infiltrated the team will not have to travel far before

their first contact. However, A/3 is leary of staying at his

for any length of time and he does not want his

Gane to know of his présence in Cuba. For this reason the
“farm will not be able to serve as a safehouse, A/2 plans on
leaving the farm the s
problem of what to do

lands, This presents the
On approach is to take A/3



CRNAs, lala

tS Guanabo or Havana and safehouse him, This, howe:
jeopardize the operation because A/3 lacks the maturity an!
patience necessary to stay put while A/2 goes about his busi-
ness, He may take advantage of his visit to Havana to under-
take a clandestine assignment on his own, When A/2 and 3
step ashore in Cuba, control will vanish. Fortunately 4/2
has a sufficient resource of judgement to go about his busi-
ness competently. Unfortunately A/3 gives no such indication.
For this reason an attempt will be made to steer A/3 towards

developing assets around his @abenIsBiary with maritime
reception capabilities.

2. A/2, on the other hand, appears to have a sufficient numbe
of supporting assets to provide for his safety while in Havana
However, he has not seen nd for over a year. In
addition both men are presently outside of the Cuban Army
organization and this position may dampen their effectiveness
in recruiting within the Army. Station reports on con-
flict with A/2's evaluation of this man. While there is no
evidence to verify that is pro-regime, there has been
a recent report on him from AMLEO/3 which claims lis an
opportunist who might work for the highest bidder. a7z's
rebuttal to these remarks is that has assisted him in
the past’ and when the chips were down he continued to aid him
in his underground activities. This still leaves a question
mark next to the worth of which unfortunately can only
be resolved by direct contact between him and A/2. There are
other security implications which should be discussed in this
evaluation. Both A/2 and A/3 cannot bé considered truly se-
curity conscious, While safehoused A/2 wrote a letter to a
contact in Miami which was to be transmitted by his case
officer. The letter gave an indication that A/2 was seeking
contacts in Havana and conveyed the impression that a trip
was in the dfing. A/2 has written several other letters
not seen by his C Os which might have given the same impres-
sion._g/3 on thé other hand talked quite frecly about his
eration to four friends in New York prior to coming to”

d, He explained that he was poring
ra eE ae RUN TR SCARCE mS ‘an operation that would take them
first to Miami and then to Cuba. Once there they would go
to his @Bfhemisgfarm and begin to make contacts. A/3 also
stated that a man named would be one of their con=
tacts, This loose talk Goupled with A/3's attitude that
KUBARK exists only to serve him makes him a marginal candi-
date for this operation. However, if A/3 is exfiltrated
three-days after his entry into Cuba, the operation will
gain,his usefulness and eliminate some of the risk he
presents.

3.) The above evaluation stresses the operational and security
weaknesses in this operation. In contrast to these weaknesses
are the positive considerations of this mission. A/2 has the
intelligence, competence, and confidence to approach and re-
cruit two assets with the potential for developing anti-regime
operations at a high level within the Cuban Army. The results
which these anti-regime activities can accomplish is a matter
for conjecture but it appears that they carry potential.
Nevertheless, if the operation continues, it will bear close
watching. in terms of security and control for these factors
will jeopardize the operation as well as KUBARK's position

if not properly contained.

IV. PHASE II

A. AMTRUNK PERSONNEL

is a 41°
yearo Zen 7 family.
His father, now deceased, was a prominent individual in law
and politics and was at one time a senator. A/27 himself
graduated from law school in Habana and was a practising
lawyer. In 1959 he became legal adviser to Camilio Cienfuegos.
Following the disappearance of Cienfuegos in October 1959,
4/27 began to engage in counter-revolutionary activities.

In May 1961, at which time he‘held the Position of Under-
Secretary of Public Works, he felt that his underground
activities. had come to the attention of the government and

he took refuge along with his wife in the Venezuelan Embassy.
He was given safe conduct from the Embassy to PBPRIME in late
1961, Subject is intelligent, articulate, and highly moti-
vated. He has some experience in counter-revolutionary
activities and has demonstrated an excellent capacity for
learning clandestine techniques. He has a very large ego,

and aristocratic pride, is very sensitive, and is quick to
take offense e o state that he has a low opinion

and advice but will not accept KUBARK control, His attitude
although not hostile, is frequently critical, and he pre-
sents a difficult handling problem.

2, AMICE/14 is a 26 year old Cuban citizen who is also a
Taw graduate of the University of Havana. He has been in-
‘volved much of his adult life in clandestine activities.
Subject arrived by small boat in June 1961 in PBPRIME.He
is highly motivated, is intelligent and objective, and has
a very highly developed security consciousness, developed
