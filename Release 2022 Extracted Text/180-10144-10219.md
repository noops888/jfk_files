PERSONALITY TRAITS:

Howard Hunt praised Barker in his

book, Give Us This Day, for his eagerness, efficiency

and complete dedication. "Overall his help was invaluable."

The individual Who first recruited Barker in Havana

lauded his enthusiasm and his "puppy-dog loyalty" to his

case officers, but found he was inclined to indiscretion

"belligerent" pro-Americanism.. Another CIA

Indeed, Barker tended to broadcast his affiliation with

the CIA to the members of the Cuban exile community and.:

anyone else who might have been interested.

This was

tolerable prior to the Bay of Pigs when his assignment

as liaison between the FRD and the CIA was overt. However,

post Bay of Pigs CIA activities in the Miami area. -

required a more covert approach. Barker was:;

told to strengthen his cover as prize fight manager and

use "cut-outs" in his attempts to gather

information

about the activities of the exile groups.

Gradually,

he was to cease all direct contact with the exiles.

For

à man who had a "love/of the game", and an even greater

affinity for the more overt techniques of investigation

and interview, it became increasingly difficult to find

a niche in Miami CIA activities.

By the time he was

terminated from CIA employemnt in 1966, he had been

involved less and less with gathering information on

Cuban exile activities, and had spent the greater part

of his time debriefing

recent refagees:from Cuba.

He never seemed to adapt to the more covert requirements

of his job nor was he ever able to establish the collective

exile community perception that he was no longer affiliated

with the Agency.
