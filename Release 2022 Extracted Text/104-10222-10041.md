Luke Conein has applied for employmeny
with the Drug Enforcement Agency. The
Acting D/Pers asked for the attached info
from CIA.

Sent to D/Pers for signature. Conein
was very controversial, much in the news
about the overthrow of Ngo Dinh Diem and
has been mentioned by Howard Hunt in Hunt'g
PinsEssatater>" cana ' recent hearing before "Watergate" committed
: ‘ Dick Biladeau, Central Cover, affirms that

Conein is “opened up".

28 September 1973 ; :

Ben -

Stan Archenhold, x 7264, one of the Agency's drug cuordinators
with DEA, called me yesterday afternoon. DEA had requested a memo
verifying employment of Mr. Lucien E, Conein, whose name has
appeared frequently during the Watergate hearings, The attached
memorandum is what Archenhold wants,

Conein's service was verificd with ROB; his "honorable service"
wae cleared with SAS. Since he was under cover as contract, I dis-
cussed the cace with Dick Biladeau of Central Gover. CCS had
opened up Conein last year and Biladean approved release of the
information to DEA. We had verified this service to a Justice Depart-
ment investigator approximately one year ago when Conein was being
considered as a consultant for BNDD.

Archenhold offered to carry the memorandum to DEA.

THE NORTH AND THE SOUTH AS HAVING N ENGAGED {N VARIUUS INTELLI=
GENCE ACTIVITIES IN VIETNAM SINCE 1545, IN ADDITION, THE STATION
HAS JUDGED. THAT HIS BEST UTILIZATION HAS BEEN AS A REPRESENTATIVE
OF THE CHIEF OF STATION IN VARIOUS COMMITTEE MEETINGS ANDO LIAISONS
WHERE IT WAS NECESSARY HE CE IDENTIFIEO AS THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE

SCHWICKRATH'S CASE TO ATTEMPT TO HICE COMPLETELY HIS AFFILIATION

CREASING SKILL AND FAMILIARITY IN THE INTRICACIES OF, KUBARK STAFF
WORK, BOTH AT THE. INTER-STATION LEVEL ANO THE INTGA-MISSION LEVEL.
THIS 1S A NEW CAPACITY FOR SCHWICKRATH WHO HAS MERETOFORE BEEN
KNOWN AS A VERY AGGRESSIVE ACTION OFFICER, SCHWICKRATH HAS PER=
FORMEO THESE NEW OUTIES WITH CONSIDERABLE FINESSE DESPITE A VERY
RAPID BUILDUP OF PARAMILITARY ‘ASSETS WITHIN VIETNAM AND AN EXTREMELY

FLUID COMMAND RELATIONSHIP WITH THE COMMANDER OF THE U.S. MILITARY
ASSISTANCE COMMANO, VIETNAM. IT 1$ WORTH NOTING THAT SCHWICKRATH
NTATIVE IN A RECENT CONFERENCE CONVOKED

WAS THE ONLY STATION REPRESE

_ BY CINCPAC IN iIAWAIT TO RECOMMEND PROCEOURES FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF
A TEN MILLION DOLLAR PROJECT INVOLVING A YEAR-LONG TURNOVER OF
CIVILIAN IRREGULAR ASSETS IN VIETNAM FROM THE STATION TO MACV.
SCHWICKRATH'S PERFORMANCE AT THAT CONFERENCE RESULTED IN THE CON-
FERENCE'S ADOPTING ALL STJIVON RECOMMENDATIONS IN RESPECT TO ITS

FUTURE ROLE IN CIVILIAN IRREGULAR ACTIVITIES, AT THE SAME TIME

SCHWICKRATH'S PERFORMANCE WAS SUCH AS TO MAINTAIN CLOSE, HARMONIOUS

RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN KUBARK, CINCPAC AND MACV.

Te 1 HAVE PERSONALLY FOUND SCHWICKRATH TO BE AN INVALUABLE
MEMBER OF OUR STAFF WITH AN TNOISPENSABLE DEPTH OF KNOWLEDGE AND

BACKGROUNO ON SOUTH VIETNAM ANO ON ALL MATTERS PERTAINING TO
GUERRILLA WARFARE. IT 1S A DISTINCT PLEASURE TO HAVE HIM WORKING
