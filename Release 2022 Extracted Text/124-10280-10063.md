CUBANS DO NOT BELIEVE THE USG IS OR WOULD BE DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN

THE BOMBING OF THE CUBANA FLIGHT.

USG INVOLVEMENT. IN THE INCIDENT,

MARTINEZ SAID, WOULD: BE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO THE USG'S INTERESTS
: De
‘BECAUSE CUBAN PRIME MINISTER FIDEDS€c AS T ROJAQUZ WOULD SURELY

BREAK THE AIR PIRACY AGREEMENT, WHICH IS TO THE BENFIT OF THE USG.
