Mr, Scelso. Yes.

Mr. Goldsmith. Let us look at CIA number 211.

Mr. Scelso. What was the nature of that 9/27 contact?

Mr. Goldsmith. If you would like, you can review the

Why. do you think that, in paragraph 3, the person send-~

Oswald's contact to be important? The fact that he was aware

of it, and passing the information along would be important?

Mr. Scelso. You get into a psychological question. The

So, the result was, eventually, Winston Scott and

Mr. Scelso. Yes. But you do not always know whether

Mr. Scelso. Yes.

Mr. Goldsmith. Would you identify this document?

Mr. Scelso. This is a cover sheet for the cable from
the Mexico station.

Mr. Goldsmith. The cover sheet to the cable we just
veferred to?

Mr. Scelso. Yes.

Mr. Goldsmith. Winn Scott here indicates, due memo

Mr. Scelso. It is addressed to this person who is

Mx. Goldsmith. Scott? That is Scott's signature.

Mr. Scelso. Yes, he writes it back to himself and

reminds himself to write a memo on it.
Mc. Goldsmith. Did you ever see the memo?
Mr. Scelso. I do not think so.

Mr. Goldsmith. Did you ever talk to Scott about his

meeting with[titensor? |
Mx. Scelso. I do not recall having done so.

Mr. Goldsmith. In any event, by this time, the Mexico

City station still had not informed Headquarters of the 9-27

Mr. Scelso. This was all on the same day.

Mr. Goldsmith. The cable traffic was pretty heavy on

w

rs

that day, I would imagine.

Mr. Scelso. Right.

Mr. Goldsmith. This cable is the first time that the

oO

Mexico City station informs Headquarters about Oswald's

9/27 contacts.

a

Mr. Scelso. Yes.

Mr. Goldsmith. Do you think that there is any connec-

tion between the fact that this contact was recorded after

the Mexico City station became aware of the fact that] Litenser

knew about Oswald's contacts?

Mr. Scelso. I would imagine that there were probably
many -- several Mexicans [transcribing reels transcribing
things and some got finished before others.

Mr. Goldsmith. This was months ago. The conversations
have been transcribed and reviewed months earlier.

Mr. Scelso. What are the numbers of the various cables
They were all going out in Geeeeies! They may have had
several analysts in the Mexico Station working on them. One
said you take this one and write a cable and the other said

you take that one and write a cable, and so on, and they wenc

out and went into the COMM Center and the COMM Center sent

them out in some order. Here. .
