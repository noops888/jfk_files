HSCA WILL BE INVESTIGATING TELTAP OPERATIONS WHICH ARE STILLI

ONGOING CAUSES US CONSIDERABLE CONCERN.

DURING PAST YEAR,

WE HAVE ENCOUNTERED INCREASING SENSITIVITY ON PART OF OUR

LIAISON COUNTERPARTS AS RESULT OF REVELATIONS AND EXPOSES

CONCERNING CIA AND FBI ACTIVITIES IN MEXICO. ONE OF THE

MOST SENSITIVE OPERATIONS FROM THE MEXICAN POINT OF VIEW!

IS TELTAPS, AS SUCH ACTIVITY IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL-IN MEXICA

THE MEXICANS DRAT A VERY DISTINCT LINE BETWEEN REVELATIONS

ABOUT CIA ACTIVITIES ORIGINATING FROM CRITICS AND ENEMIES

AND THUSE BEARING THE IMPRIMATUR OF THE U.S. GOGERNMENT.

THE RELEASE OF THE FBI DOCUMENTS DREW A SHARP WARNING FROM:

THE PRESIDENTIAL ADVISOR ON INTELLIEGNCE MATTERS (CF. MEXICO

CITY 43110).

7• ANY PUBLIC REVELATION BY THE MSCA OF JOINT.

¡TELTAR ACTIVITY, JOINT OPERATIONS, OR LIAISON EDOPERATION

'IN INTELLIGENCE MATTERS, MAY WELL RESULI IN THE CURIAILMENT

OF THESE OPERATIONS AND

THE LIAISON WHICH HAS BEEN ASSIDUOUSLY

[DEVELOPED OVER THE YEARS; PLUS THE VERY REAL LOSS OF HIGH LEVEL

REPORTING SOURCES.
