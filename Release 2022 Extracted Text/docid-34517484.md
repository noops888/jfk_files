1. I have enclosed herewith, copies of correspondence requesting
certain documents and information which are necessary to the defense of
LTC Herlihy. :

2. As of this date, I have not received a reply to either of the
enclosed letters. JI therefore request that the board take action to
insure that I am provided with the requested information. \

OR has been brought to my attention that at least two other :
individuals were interviewed at SHAPE, Belgium, whose statements, for
some unknown reason, do not appear in the file made available to the
selection board. Those individuals presently known to me are as follows:

(afm. Peter Bagley, Chief of CIA, Belgium

(of %sgt Ortey, Office of the U. S. Military Representative -
Belgium. Both of these individuals were interviewed in approximately
May-June 1968. It is requested that the transcripts of these inter-
views be made available to me. |

4. The vague nature of the allegations against LTC Herlihy and the fact
_ that many material witnesses were either not interviewed, or their
ara statements ,destroyed, indicate that this entire investigation was not

carried out in the objective manner required by regulation. As pointed
out earlier in this letter, I have yet to receive an answer to my
letters requesting additional information on the missing statements
mentioned in the enclosed correspondence.

5. In light of the fact that LTC Herlihy has honorably served his
country for a period in excess of eighteen years, the action of the
selection board in recommending his appearance before a show cause
board based primarily upon the Statement of a woman of questionable
repute, is almost inconceivable. LIC Herlihy has in fact requested that
he be tried by General Court-Martial in order that he may be provided
an opportunity to prove his innocence in a judicial proceeding.

6. It is requested that action be taken upon my requests as quickly as
.possible and that I be notified in writing as to the disposition

thereof.
