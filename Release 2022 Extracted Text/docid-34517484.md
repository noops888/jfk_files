-

1. I have enclosed herewith, copies of correspondence requesting

certain documents and information which are necessary to the defense of

LTC Herlihy.

2. As of this date, I have not received a reply to either of the

enclosed letters. I therefore request that the board take action to

insure that I am provided with the requested information.

3."'It has been brought to my attention that at least two other

individuals were interviewed at SHAPE, Belgium, whose statements, for

some unknown reason, do not appear in the file made available to the

selection board. Those individuals presently known to me are as follows:

Mr. Peter Bagley, Chief of CIA, Belgium

(b) sgt Ortez, Office of the U. S. Military Representative -

Belgium. Both of these individuals were interviewed in approximately

May-June 1968. It is requested that the transcripts of these inter-

views be made

available to me.

4.

The vague nature of the allegations against LIC Herlihy and the fact

that many material witnesses were either not interviewed, or their

statements, destroyed, indicate that this entire investigation was not

carried out in the objective manner required by regulation. As pointed

out earlier in this letter, I have yet to receive an answer to my

letters requesting additional information on the missing statements

mentioned in the enclosed correspondence.

5. In light of the fact that IIC Herlihy has honorably served his

country for a period in excess of eighteen years, the action of the

selection board in recommending his appearance before a show cause

board based primarily upon the statement of a woman of questionable

repute, is almost inconceivable. LIC Herlihy has in fact requested that

he be tried by General Court-Martial in order that he may be provided

an opportunity to prove his innocence in a judicial proceeding.

6. It is requested that action be taken upon my requests as quickly as

possible and that I be notified in writing as to the disposition

thereof.
