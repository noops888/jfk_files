"Information from other sources of this

office and from sources of your office during

the period January - February 1966 has indicated

that MASFERRER has claimed that Subject is serving

as his 'military advisor' for the projected opera-

tion into Haiti.

Subject

states that MASFERRER

has made the above claim without the permission of

Subject, that Subject in fact has refused to act

as military advisor for the Haitian undertaking

or to participate in the operation in any role.

Based upon other information available, this office

believes that Subject's statements concerning the

above matter are truthful and accurate.

Although

this cannot be documented, it is the opinion of this

office that MASFERRER has made false statements

concerning Subject's alleged role in the Haitian

undertaking with the hope of impressing other parties

to the affair

who could be induced to contribute

to it.

"This office will continue to forward to your

office any information concerning the Haitian matter

which may come to the attention of subject.

In the

event that your office should wish to interview

Subject concerning the Haitian affair, this office

is prepared to make him available for interview.

The are CAn wAs Seen may be discussed

The above information was classified SECRET byCIA)

Inasmuch as the ROLANDO: MASFERRER ROJAS case

is under active investigation by U. S. Customs, UACB,

Miami will not interview SECEN in this matter.
