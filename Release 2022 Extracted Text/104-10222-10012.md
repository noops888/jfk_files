{2022 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992 |

15 September 1977

MEMOPANDUMN FOR: Chief, Information Services Staff

FROM : : Charles A. Briggs
DDO Information Review Officer
SUBJECT : Appreciation
eit

1, As you know well, on September 19th, I turn over.
responsibility for release or denial of DDO documents -under
the Frecdom of Information and, Privacy Acts. The experience
has been both frustrating and challenging, epitomizing the
issues in transition from'a totally classified past to a new
intelligence environment yet to be defined. The tension in

law between protection of sources and methods and. more open

governm was, apparent, daily, to those involved; good case
law was made as we sought to adhere to both principles and
to regain, through this Process, some credibility for the

Agency.

2. I've tried in the past to convey my appreciation
for the truly magnificent support I got from what is now
the Privacy and Information Action Group, through recommenda-
tions for the Unit Citation subsequently awarded by the DCI,
through QSI‘s. and promotions, and through personal comment,
All have worked long hard hours and all, those now in PLAG
and those ‘who have left, deserve credit for thoir professional
efforts in this arena; I want to express my thanks to you for
the assistance your peopte gave to me as the DMO Information

Review Officer.

3. At the risk of being unfair to some who are more
recent arrivals, I want to express particular and very
personal thanks to Win Brown, Cis Cass, Lou Dube, ‘Mary Felton,
Doris LeBaron, Fred McCann, Karen Rice, Helen Stilson, Jon

Wolfe and Mack Wood.

4, My debt to Fred i er been
made a matter of record on severa Tons. Let ‘me just
note here that any supervisor who has had the kind of

qualitative backing that’ those two gentlemen pave me Ss
fortunate indeed,

For OPF, Randall, Frederick



5. [In addition to the PIAG crowd, Paul Hacfner's people :
have had the endless and répetitive job of searching the reer
a. CHAOS files and helping me deal with that most sensitive :
j aspect of past history, [lcase express my thanks to them
and, most particularly, to Paul-himself,

6. Finally, let me make special note of the contributions :
from Joe Gigliotti and the retired officers handling the OSS
records requests. Their particular expertise was a welcome
addition to-the staff support received.

7. I'm sure ali will give Bob Owen, in his new role, iu |
the same high quality support that they gave to me, To state \
the obvious, although the win record is quite good, the race
is still on, H

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chairman, DDO Evaluation Board 7 tf iit
THROUGH: c/an ‘s
SUBJECT: | Promotion Recommendation - Frederick C. Randall to GS-15 H

1. This memorandum constitutes a formal recommendation that Fred
Randall, GS-14/8, now Chief of the DDO Privacy Information (DDO/PIC)
unit in Services Staff, be promoted to GS-15. The position calls for
that grade.

2. Mr. Randall is 49 years of age; entered on duty in CIA in
Septémber 1951'as a GS-7. assigned to OSO/FD2Z.. He is married; ‘has four
children, served briefly in the Air Force (1945-46); has. an AB in : ,
Government, an AM in Foreign ‘Affairs, and was a PhD candidate in
International Relations. His Agency service was in FE froin 1953 to
1965, including overseas tours in Djakarta and Tokyo; in DOD/FRD
> from 196$ to March 1975, including 2 years in the DC field office;
ne current assignment dates from 16 March 75. His date of grade is
june 1967.

3. The specifics of Mr. Randall's current assignment and all the
superlatives about it I have just recounted in a fitness report which
I prepared today, as well as in a QSI recommendation (apptoved) of
Cctober 1975 and an out-of-cycle promotion recommendation dated
8 August 1975: I rate his performance Outstanding and refer the
reader{s) to the reports cited for details. -I would note here that
Mr. Randall changed his home base and functional category in November
of 1975 and was rated number 1 of 4 Category C nominees from this Staff
by all four members of the SS Panel. I would note further that when
I submitted my August 75 out-of-cycle promotion recommendation, Mr.
Randall's career designation was B/OG; given his personal circumstances .
the DDO suggested that Randall change his career désignation to become
more competitive "and have an excellent cae on the next go round."
The QSI suggestion then resulted. :

SPEED LETTER

One-Time Reciana’ - Requested Randall Promotion

. As you-know, OB is not reticent about expressing his views, and in the informal
career development world, Fred had had it in FRD. I've known OB fairly well and re-
spect his candor and professionalism; we jyst worked very well together on the GS-
16/17 Panel, with an interestingly identical philosophy. Fred's performance did not
satisfy OB, and his Fitness Reports reflect that fact. It does not surprise me, since
Fred had been in FR from 1970-1975, that his Fitness Reports for the past years would

put him in a neutral middle, or even low middle, ranking among B/0G officers. But |
that's yesterday.

Today, as. I tried to say strongly in my 8 August memo, my view of his work is
that it is OutStanding--and I don't.so rate many officers. I would hope his present
work. could St @M its own merit, and project forward, expecting FOIA to be a way of

His
present and future peer competition~should be with the A/C crowd,-not the B/O§ group--
if that hurdle is determining.

At the risk of being irritating, I feel bound to state his case in what I con-
sider the appropriate competitive environment, to avoid an out-of-cycle suggestion
doing mischief to the system. Any ho

8 August 1975

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director for Operations
SUBJECT: Out-of-Sequence Promotion Recommendation:
: Fred Randall

1. We've spoken of the need to look further at both Agency
and DDO implications. of the Freedom of Information Act and, now,
the Privacy Act, inéluding the increased number of appeals and
litigation cases, and of the logic of collecting a coterie of
deponents or affiants to take some of the load off of both you
and me. The grade level of the appeals officers and the deponents

~ must include 14's and 15's, to incorporate the necessary clout
with the divisions and judgment vis-a-vis release of information
to the outside world.

2. Fred is a GS-14/7, He had just came to me at the time of
the last GS-15 panel exercise and had not been recommended for
promotion by FRD. I consider his performance over the past 6 months
to have been Outstanding. He is head and shoulders above the other
directorates" FI0s; I fave considerable laudatory testimony from
GC, OLC, O/DDA and within the DDO as to his professionalism, tact,
persuasiveness, analytic skills and realistic, while tough-minded,

* protection of DDO sources and methods. This includes occasional
arm-wrestling with DDO branch/division/staff chiefs, OGC and OLC
lawyers, FBI contacts and others above his current grade level.

3. I have discussed this proposed out-of-cycle promotion
recommendation to GS-15 with Ev, who, in turn, has mentioned it *~ *
to Gordon, The return signals I got sounded positive.

4, do, therefore, recommend that you, approve Fred's promotion
to GS-15, effective as soon as the action can he cut. i

SUBJECT + Frederick C, RANDALL, Recommendation
for Promotion to GS-4

1. It is recommended that Frederick C. Randall be
promoted from GS-13 to GS-14. Subject is in Step 6 of
his grade and has been a GS-13 since 1958. He entered
on duty at the US Station in August 1965. A current
Fitness Report is attached.

2. Subject's file indicates that he has been recom-
mended for promotion five times: four times by his
superiors in FE Division when he served in Japan, and
once by the US Station in February 1966. While realizing
that the 13 to 14 jump is traditionally difficult we feel
that Subject's performance over the past year, when coupled
with a consistently high calibre of work in previous years;
deserves much-belated recognition in the form of a promotion.
He continties to be responsible for the US Station's efforts
to exploit the Far Eastern target, and his. years of over-.
pa experience against this target have been reflected

laginative approach to operations in
His operational activity has required
e han ng Of persons of varied nationality and‘stature,

close contact with Headquarters representatives, liaison
with the Washington Ficitd Office of the FBI, and liaison
with the US Alr Force. His performance has been uniformly
"Strong" and his handling of the HASHARK case has been
outstanding. HASHARK, an has been a
contact of the Agency. for years, “bu was not until his
arrival in Washington afd his handiing by Subject that he
began to produce solid intelligence on his own country.
Subject's work on this casé nh. received a well-deserved
commendation from Headquarters. _



Subject's excellent relations with colleagues in FE
vision have been of considerable value in helping the
Statién to adjust its operational activity: in the FE
field to current and changing requirements. He has clearly
been performing at the GS-14 level for some time and we
urge that this promotion request be favorably considered
at the earliest possible meeting of your panel.

views from the IMS/FPG vantage, hut at this level, I want to
see more concern about the people ‘and activities of companion
INS elements, more brainstorming of common problems. He is
the least active of the four group chiefs in this area,
although he has the inquisitiveness und intellect to contribute

importantly in cross-discipline problems. 1 find no weakness
here, but Mr. Randall's contributions here do not measure up

In these other areas, covering duties 3
Randall and his group stimulated, staffed out and justified
three remarkably successful policy changes: a Presidential
Statement that sources and methods information need not be
classified to be protected; a DCI policy that DO records: ipso
facto are not releasable (despite an OGC opinion to the
contrary), and a policy allowing employees access to their
files without going through the FOIA or Privacy Act folderol.
While not individual accomplishments by Mr. Randall, they
bespeak Seem the leadership and guidance he gave, and they are
typical of the kind of case officer professionalism he has and
we have needed to help protect agents, operations and officers
from exposure. I do think it is sad to have to divert good
HO talent to disclosure law problems; but if we must, then
Mr. Randall's expericnce and abilities have counted a great

The merger of units which ‘created the Information Services Staff
brought Mr. Randall and his stast under my supervision for the first
time. Prior to that wé had been colleagues in Services Staff, whose
chicf wrote Mr. Randall's Fitness Report. No. change in function
accompanied the change in organization, however, and the praise
contuined in those earlier reports could be ccheed—here.- .

During 1977, Mr. Randall and his group have continued to render
this Directorate outstanding service in an arena where there is little
glory but the constant threat of disaster. In the preparation of
materials for release under FOIA, the Privacy Act or.£.0. 11652, the
researcher treads a fine, barely visible line between Protection of
operational Secrets and- revelation of matérial properly releasable
under the law. He is denied the easy choice of over-protection
because each decision is subject to the scrutiny of the courts, and
the Agency's credibility is on the line each time a judge challenges
a delction or the denial of a document. (That credibility is
apparently quite high in the courts. -We have yet_to..be reversed in.

‘ ‘ eA

cursory, and from the beginning there has been a high premium on
both technical accuracy and sound substantive judgment. As Mr.
Randall himself noted in a report on his deputy, we have an
enviable record as far as "flaps" are concerned; in a situation
fraught with danger of inappropriate release of information we
have had only five ‘cases where release has led to embarrassment -*
out of 7,000. "possibles." Mr. Randall, with typical modesty,
uses the’ statistic in praise of others; I choose to use it to
praise him. The Group's record to date is nothing short of .
astonishing, and Mr. Randall can take great pride in his team's

accomplishments.

He has built an extremely able and dedicated team, and he
is as quick as anyone I know to ascribe to individual members of
that team credit for actions, idcas or progress. They respond
to his fairness with ‘loyalty and affection, and their morale
in’ the face of constant harrassment and frustration is testimony

to his leadership.

New responsibilities for support to the Office of General
Counsel were ‘added to PiAG's burdens this year. Mr. Randall
opposed the move and argues (and lobbied) intelligently to
preclude it, to no avail. It is to his credit that, having urged
a different course of action, he set about to ensure that the
‘unpopular new function received the same careful attention which
has been the hallmack of PIAG's other work. As a consequence,
our OGC-related efforts, which are very demanding and
time-consuming, have the PIAG stamp of excellence on them.

Mr. ‘Randall created the system he manages, and continues
to.seck ways to improve upon it. Our move to an automated index
of reviewed and released documents was urged and supported by
Mr. Randall, and he has been equally supportive of-a new branch
chief's efforts to restructuce our Initial Review process. He
is also quick to see and to comment on the way our efforts
affect larger Agency and government cquities, and vice versa.

During this year his responsibilities were broadened by
the addition of our Declassification Review Branch to his Group,
a reflection of our recognition of the inevitable relationship
between scheduled declassification and selective declassification
and release under FOLA/PA/E.O. 11652.. This Branch will shortly
be absorbed by the new Records Review Branch ef the PDA, but PI
will continue to be the focal point for policy fornulation on
declassification of DO records.

AG



NARRATIVE COMMENTS - cont'd

Mr. Randall has expressed to me his concern about what
may be viewed as a drop in his rating from my predecessor's
"oO" to my "S." I have assured him, and assure the reader,
that this.change signals no diminution in his performance or _
effectiveness, but rather-a personal inclination to use
“QOutstanding" very rarely. The narrative comments above
should clearly attest to that fact that I view Mr. Randall's
performance as very strong, bordering on Outstanding. The
Agency and the DO have been fortunate to have\a man of this
caliber in charge of PIAG,

REVIEWING COMMENTS '- cont'd

Mr. Randall is one of the key policy makers in this area. His
policies have stood the test up to now as our excellent record
in the courts attests.

Having said this, it should be noted that Mr. Randall's
numerous accomplishments are partly because the job was there
to be created, Within the DO he cut the path which is now
followed when handling FOIA matters. He has corrected and

} . + improved upon that path several times over. Thus, the time
t is coming for him to be given a change in assignment; an
opportunity to use his managerial and supervisory skills
elsewhere. fle will have been in his present assignment three
years in March 1978, One grows stale reviewing, sanitizing
and making judgment calls in ‘the FOIA arena day after day.
Mr. Randall isn't stale yet but we should not wait until he
reaches that Stage to give him a new area in which to work.

My qualitative assessment and comments in Fred's February 1976 Fitness —

quantitative and administrative changes of the past year,

sophisticated FOIA requester group and judiciary, plus a highly organize

Mr. Randall supervises fhe unit responsible for developing the DDO answer to Freedom

increasingly, at the appeal and litigation levels. His organization is still less

to the past year's publicity about CIA, demanding great amounts of information. Last
March, Randall and i secretary played the role, then the T/0 went from to

professionalism and secms to have been made for it. As I said ina
memo last October which resulted in a QSI for him, in spite of the
ambiguity of the guidelines, constant pressure of short deadlines,
very large volume of work and cultural trauma generated by the Acts,
his performance has been Outstanding.

Earlier fitness reports, in a different context, stated or
implied some reservation about his energy or initiative or independent
action. [ can't imagine that we're talking about the same man. Close
to 95% of the mass of Agency FOIA receipts have involved the DDO. I
know all of the persons ‘involved in other directorates and said, only
6 months into this year, that Fred was head'and shoulders above the
others, combining professionalism, tact, persuasivencss, analytic
Skills, tough-mindedness and pragmatism in sources and methods protection.
Ile suggested policy, strongly influenced implementation, and debated,
usually successfully, with the lawyers, with DbO branch, division and
staff chiefs, with other Agency contacts and others above his current
grade level--all with a sustaining sense of humor.

As to management of his unit: he has consistently resisted empire-
building opportunities, trying to keep ifs staff small. When growth was
inevitable, he concentrated on quality im personnel selected for thi
atypical DDO work rather than accepting the short fix to the statistical
backlog problem because routine or "passable" effort is not good enough
in litigation. The best reflection of his minagerial ability can be
seen in an unsolicited testimony from his staff which I have attached
to this report to mike it a part of the official record; it is the First
of its kind to come to my attention in my 23 plus years in the Agency.
(IE some jaded cynics in these days of non-credibility doubt the
spontaneity and true feeling of Mr, fandall’s staff in this action,
and one or txo of my f have, [can only feel sad for then. This

is a breath of fresh air to me.) :

Randall has imde a singularly impressive shift in direction,
has changed career category and, in my judygnent, has unqalifiedly
demonstrated his commind ot the position he holds. 1 have reconumended

recognition of that fact.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Services Staff
SUBJECT: ~ — Fred Randall, C/DD0/PIC

1. This memorandum. is intended to state what we,
the staff of DDO/PIC, think of our Chief, Mr. Fred
Randall, Mr. Randall is not aware of this memorandum.

i 2. We believe he is outstanding as a manager and
“fellow worker! His sensitive understanding of human

- relationships is balanced by a no-nonsense firmness to
get the job donc. Using extraordinary patience, -brains,
tact, and diplomacy, along with long hours and weekend
time, he has set an example for his entire staff. Mr.
Randall's deep knowledge of operations, his grasp of
the implications of past operations on current activity,
his determination to protect the Agency and the DDO from
the devastating impact of unwarranted and unauthorized
release of information, and his Judgement of the fine line:
between what should and should not be released under
appropriate law and policy, haye forned.a major line of
protection for the USG and the Agency.

3. He has not hesitated to make decisions, nor to
disagree when he felt disagreement warranted. A strong
aversion to pyramid building has underlined his cost-
consciousness to get the most done with the least amount
of expenditures. Yet, his determination and firmness are
based upsn an open, objective mind, willing to listen to
difterent views, and to change his position if he is
convinced of the need for change.

e to aid employees in career

re-inforced by concrete actions, positive

defined tasks, and frequent chee ks to assess
ity of work produc

am: CONFIDENTIAL =~

5. The nature of. the task assigned to DDO/PIC
in¢ludes the word by word review of thousands of pages
of documents. The impact on the Agency, and the USG,
of unauthorized disclosure of secrets, adds to the weight
of constant decision making, and to the strain and tension
of defending a crucial perimeter. And this perimeter is. .
under an almost daily attack of erupting crises. Mr.
Randall's dedication and superior ability in handling an
onerous, difficult, and complex job, filled with frustra-
tions that would dismay and discourage others, has been

truly outstanding.

6. Mr. Randall has had his finger in the dike for
an incredibly long time. He has been operating in a
hazardous, high pressure environment, fraught with
penalties if he does not make the right decisions, and
little recognized when he does. Yet, his common sense
decisions have been accepted, and have become policy--
policy that ordinarily is made by very senior super-grade-
officers of thé Agency. An assignment in NDO/PIC can
burn out rapidly many competent individuals. Fred
Randall is still going strong, and continuing to do an

outstanding job!

MEMORANDUM IN LIEU OF FITNESS REPORT
SUBJECT: Mr. Frederick C. Randall, GS-14/7

1. This report is submitted as part of a package suggesting that
Mr, Randall be awarded a QSI for his performance since becoming the
DDO Frecdom of Information Officer in February of this year. In this
context, it is not appropriate that he see and sign this memorandum,
since I want this to-be a surprise. Nor, it scems, is it necessary
to have a Reviewing Official for this interim report; the DDO has’
suggested conmenting on my out-of-cycle recommendation of 8 August, 75
‘indall's promiotion, that a ‘cmorandun be submitted recommending

a QSI at this time.

2. I consider Mr. Randall's performance as DDO/FIO (now DNO/PIC, for
Privacy Act and FOIA Coordinator) to be Outstunding. As I have said
@lsewhere, he is, in my view, the most impressive of all the Agency FIO's
combining DDO professionalism, tact, perstusiveness, analytic skills and
an informed, tough-minded approach toward sources and methods protection.
I have received considerable Mnumaiadd comment about his work from OCC,
OLC, O/DBA and within the DO.

3. From a one-man operation with secretary, the FOIA activity expanded
in four months to an approved 1/0 of [with a pending request for § more;

REVIEWING OFFICIALS COMMENTS (Frederick C. Randall)

I concur generally with. the-comments of the rating officer.
I believe Mr. Randall has shown improvement in hie handling of his
Branch Chief responsibilities. I agree that he has shown greater
initiative in this reporting period than in the previous ones, however,
I would still like to see a somewhat greater and quicker recognition
on Mr. Randall's part of operational problem areas. Granted that this
is a talent that is frequently hard to develop, it is nonetheless, essential
for all Branch Chiefs in this Division to achieve a high degree of
operational perspicacity, Mr. Randall has the ability and needs only

additional experience to improve his focud
He is a thoughtful and considerate
pervisor, ¥ ed by his subordinates and he representa the Division
very well Indeed, Mr, Randall's career would be onhanced were he in
position to accept a field assignment which would get him into direct

* operational contact, i.e., recruiting and handling agents, Unfortunately,

for family medical reasons he will apparently be confined to the \
Headquartera area for an indefinite period, On balance, I consider him
to be a good Branch Chief who willingly works long hours and doos his
Job well. :

Mr. Randall has served under me fer slightly more than three
months and had just taken over his new position duties when

as Chief of one of our three operating branches. This branch

Branch level instead of allowing them to pass on up to the
ision Chief level for decision, but it is hoped that he.
will gradually develop his style in this direction as he

Branch Chief. The thorough test of his managerial skills,
however, will occur in this upcoming period when all the
Bases in his Branch become operationally active on a broad
front and will require a continuing high quality of super-
vision, guidance and support from the Branch Chief's office.
I would rate his performance to date as an overall "Strong".

3, Reviewing Official's Comments:

I concur generally with the above rating. I also observed in the
early days of Mr, Randall's assignment as Branch Chief, that his per-
formance could certainly have been stronger. It took him somewhat
longer than i had anticipated to really take charge of his Branch. However,
I feel that as he has continued in this assigninent he has made very definite
progress, He is now generally well informed on the operational activities
taking place in his area and hao begun to exercise a greater degree of
initiative and aggressiveness in handling the operational matters that cross
his desk, Had I been the rating officer I probably would have given Mr.
Randall a somewhat lower, moré qualified "Strong" rating. If he continues
to improve ih the months ahead as he has in the past several, I believe he
can earn an unqualified "Strong" rating for this performance,

desk work is done by his Intel Assistant, it is a tribute to his supervisory capability
that this service maintains a high rate of efficiency despite the significant increase ia

the law, a difficult balance must be achieved, On the
one hand, the rights of our citizens must be respected.
On the other, the obligation of the Agency to protect
its sources and methods must be honored. In meetin.
these rights arid obiigations, the Directorate of Operations
hus handled some 16,960 requests to date. In all instances
shere a-requester has gone to the federal courts, the
tO has never lost a case based upon our exemptions for

This assignment followed approximitely ten years of service with

FR Division, Mr. Randall's performunce since reporting to this

of 12 cployces and with the increasing responsibilities as a result
of the enactment of the Privacy Act it is anticipated that additional

3. Mr. Randall -has been responsive in the handling of ror

requests and is noted for his professionalism, tact,

4 Tt ts my opinion, und also Q&i's, that Mri Pandall's strengths
are in’a staff assignment such as his current one. : Therefore, follow-
ing discussions with Mr, Rundall, it was agreed that his home-Kase

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Personnel
THROUGH : Chairman, DDO QSI and Honor and Merit Awards Panel

‘SUBJECT : Request for a Quality Step Increase for Mr. Frederick
: C. Randall, GS-14

. ° 1. Qn the basis of the information presented below, it is
Lat oortites that a Quality Step Increase be approved for Mr. Frederick
. 11.

2, Mr. Randall has been employed by the Agency since September 1951.
He has spent his Agency carcer in the Operations Directorate serving with
Fast Asia and Foreign Resources Divisions. He has had field assignments
in Jakarta and Tokyo and spent four years at FR Base, Washington.

3. In early 1975, Mr. Randall was assigned to the Services Staff
to serve as the Freedom of Information Officer for the DDO. In spite of
the ambiguity of evolving guidelines, constant pressure of short deadlines,
a very large volume of work and the cultural trauma the Act and its
implementation generated, Mr. Randall's performance has been outstanding.
He'is noted for his professionalism, tact, persuasiveness, analytic skills,
and realistic, while tough-minded, protection of DIO sources and methods.
In addition to his FOI responsibilities, Mr. Randall was just designated
the Privacy Act Coordinator for the DUO. It is still too early to predict
the actual work requirements as a result of this Act, bat it is anticipated
that Mr. Randall will meet these added responsibilities’ in the sane
exceptional manner as he has fulfilled his FOI duties.

4. Consideration has been given to the granting of an Honor and
Merit Award, However, it is felt that a Quality Step Increase will
provide more appropriate recognition of Mr. Randall's outstanding
performace during the past seven months in a very chall ing and

demanding assigameit.

proposed approaches to collecting information, and in serv-

pattern of affective procedures for coordination of th rvicea!
clandestine collection operations. These procedures 9 Ing emtlated
wherever possibla throughout the Far East. Mt. Randall's tenacity and.

have worked to a distinct advantage for the Agency in the RAMPART field.
The Chief of ulation, Tokyo has stated that the vast improvement in the

fonally otrong manner and 19 expected to continue for the remainder of his
present and future aseignments. We have considered the presentation of an
Honor-or Merit Award; but the Division feels that a quality step increase
appears to be more appropriate in this particular case due to his extended
period of time in grade without promotion. Mr. Randall is scheduled for
reassigment in June 1965 and we feel the granting of a quality step
increase at this time will indicate our appreciation and recognition of

i
