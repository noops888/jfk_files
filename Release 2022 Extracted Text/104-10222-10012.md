Appreciation

B. il

responsibility for release

As you know well, on September 19th, 1 turn over

or denial of DDO documents under

the Freedom of Information and Privacy Acts. The experience

las been both trustrating and challenging,

epitonizing the

issues in transition from'a totally classified past to a new

intelligence environment

yet to be defined.

The

tension in

law between protoction of sources and methods and more open

government was apparent, daily, to those involved; good case

law was made as we sought to adhere to both principles and

to regain, through this process, some credibility for the

Agency.

I've tried in the past to convey my appreciation

truly magnificent support 1 got from what is now

the Privacy and Informution Action Group, through recommenda-

tions for the Unit Citation subsequently

awarded by

the DCI,

through Q5I's. and promotions, and

through personal comment.

All have worked long hard hours and all'or choir processional

efforts in this arona;

assistance your people gave to me as the DO information

In addition to the PIAG crowd, 'Paul Hafner's people

have had the endless

and répetitive job of searching the

aspect of past history.

Please express my thanks to them

and, most particularly, to Paul himself.

Finally, let mo make special note of the contributions

from Joe Gigliotti and the retired officers handling the OSS

records requests.

Their particular expertise was a welcome

addition to the staff support received.

I'm sure all will give Bob Owen,

in his new role,

the same high quality support that they gave to

C/CNG

THROUGH:

SUBJECT:

Promotion Recommendation - Frederick C. Randall to GS-15

1.

This memorandum constitutes a formal recommendation that Fred

Randall, GS-14/8, now Chief of the DDO Privacy Information (DDO/PIC)

unit in Services Staff, be promoted to CS-15. The position calls for

that grade.

Mr. Randall is 49 years of age; entered on duty in CIA in

September 1951 as a GS-7. assigned to OSO/FDZ..

He is married; 'has four

children, served briefly in the Air Force (1945-46); has. an AB in

Government, an AM in Forcign Affairs, and was a PhD candidate in

Interational Relations.

His Agency service was in FE fron. 1953 to

1965, including overseas tours in Djakarta and Tokyo; in DOD/FRD

from 1965 to March 1975, including 2 years

in the DC field office;

his current assignment dates from 16 March

75. His date of grade is

June 1967.

3.

The specifics of ir. Randall's current assignment and all the

superlatives about it I have just recounted in a fitness report which

I prepared today, as well as in a QSI recommendation (approved) of

October 1975 and an out-of-cycle promotion recommendation dated

8 August 1975:

I rate his performance Outstanding and refer the

reader(s) to the reports cited for details.

•I would note here that

Mr. Rindall changed his home base and functional category in Yovember

of 1975 and was rated number 1 of 4 Category C nominees fron this Staff

by all four memhers of the SS Panel, • I would note further that when

I submitted my August 75 out,-of-cycle promotion recommendation, Mr.

Randall's career designation was B/OG; given his personal circunstances

the DDO suggested that Randall change his career designation to become

more conpetitive "and have an excellent chance on the next go round."

The (Sl suggestion then resulted.

As the individual responsible for releasing or denying

thousands of DDO documents in response to FOIA requests, and subsequently

answering for DDO decisions in affidavits and court depositions, I know

nol nell fred does his work and how richly lie deserves this promotion to

Chief, Services Staff

SUBJECT: One-Time Reclama - Requested Randall Promotion

• As you know, OB is not reticent about expressing hig views, and in the incorma

career development world, Fred had had it in FRD.

I've known OB fairly well and re-

spect his candor and professionalism; we just worked very well together on the a-

16/17 Panel, with an interestingly identical philosophy.

Fred's performance did not

satisty OB, and his Fitness Reports reflect that fact.

It does not surprise me, since

Fred had been in FR from 1970-1975, that his Fitness Reports for the past years would

put him in a neutral middle, or even low middle, ranking among B/0 officers.

that's yesterday.

Today, as I tried to say strongly in my 8 August memo, my view of his work is

that it is

Outstanding--and I don't so rate many officers.. I would hope his present

work.could stand on its own merit, and project forward, expecting FOIA to be a way of

lite in the Do with ill the management challenge,

and headache, that poses.

present and future peer competition-should be with the A/C crowd, not the B/06 group-.

if that hurdle is determining.

At the risk of being irritating, I feel bound to state his case in what I con-

sider the appropriate competitive environment, to avoid an out-of-cyclo suggestion

doing mischief to the system. Any hope?

MENDRAVDM FOR: Deputy Director for Operations

SUBJECT:

Out-of-Sequence Promotion Recormendation:

Fred Randall

We've spoken of the need to look further at both Agency

and DDO implications of the Freedom of Information Act and, now,

the Privacy Act, including the increased number of appeals and

litigation cases, and of the logic of collecting a coterie of

deponents or affiants to take some of the load off of both you

and me.

The grade level of the appeals officers and the deponents

must include 14's and 15's, to incorporate the necessary clout

with the divisions and judgment vis-a-vis release of information

to the outside world.

2.

Fred is a GS-14/7.

ie had just come to me at the time of

the last GS-15 panel exercise and had not been recommended for

promotion by FRD.

I consider his performance over the past 6 months

to have been Outstanding.

He is head and shoulders above the other

directorates' FlOs; I have considerable laudatory testimony from

OGG, OLC, O/DDA and within the DDO as to his professionalism, tact,

persuasiveness, analytic skills and realistic, while tough-minded,

protection of DDO sources and methods.

This includes occasional

arm-wrestling with DDO branch/division/staff chiefs, OCC and OLC

lawyers, FBI contacts and others above his current grade level.

3. I have discussed this proposed out-of-cycle promotion

recommendation to GS-15 with Ev, who, in turn, has mentioned it'

to Gordon. The return signals I got sounded positive.

4. I do, therefore, recommend that you, approve fired's pronation

to GS-15, effective as soon as the action can he cut.

The workload is larger and more complicated than anything

remains only to be noted that Mr. Ramall is the perfect man for the job, combining

a remarkable match of leadership, operational sawly, legal and policy awareness and,

perhaps most important, negotiating ability with both the Agency lanyers and legisla-

transcends the Do's need-to-know practices (Top Secret and compartmented, higotted

Dedicated, discreet, smart, and honest, Mr. Randall is very likely one of

very few Do officers of his grade who could have handled this job from scritch, done

so with virtually

flawless output, and croated a body of judgments and nivice that is

trusted, proven and amounts to de facto Do policy on how to protect our secrets.

a Presidential

statement that sources and methods information need not be

classified to be protected; a DCI policy that DO records ipso

contrary), and a policy allowing employces access to

files without going through the FOlA or Privacy Act folderol.

Branch Chief responsibilities. I agree that he has shown greater

Initiative in this reporting period than in the previous ones, however,

I would still like to soe a somewhat greater and quickor recognition

on Mr. Randall's part of operational problem areas. Granted that this

Is a talent that is frequently hard to develop, it la nonetholess, essential

for all Branch' Chiefs in this Division to achieve a high dogree of

operational perspicacity. Mr. Randall has the ability and needs only

additional experience to improve his focus

He is a thoughtful and considerate

supervisor, respected by his subordinates and he representa the Division

very well indeed.

Mr. Randall's career would be onhanced were he in

a position to accept a field assignment which would got him into direct

operational contact, i.e., recruiting and handling agonte. Unfortunately,

for family medical reasons he will apparently be contined to the

Headquarters area for an indefinite period. On balance, I consider him

to be a good Branch Chief who willingly worke long hours and does hia

job well.

3. Reviewing Official'a Comments:

concur generally with the above rating. I also observed in the

early days of Mr. Randall's assignment as Branch Chief, that his per-

formance could certainly have been stronger. It took him somewhat

longer than i had anticipated to really take charge of his Branch. However,

I feel that as he has continued in this assigninent he has made very definite

progress. He is now generally well informed on the operational activities

taking place in his area and has begun to exercise a greater degree of

initiative and aggressiveness in handling the operational matters that cross

his dosk. Had i been the rating officer I probably would have given Mr.

Randall a somewhat lower, more qualified "Strong" rating. If he continues

to improve in the months ahead as he has in the past several, I believe he

can earn an unqualified "Strong"

rating for this performance.

desk work is done by his Intal Assistant, it is a tribute to his supervisory capability

that this service maintains a high rate of efficiency despite the significant increase in

COMMENTS ON SEVIENINO OFFICIAL

I concur, generally, with the narrative portion of this report.

However, I feel that it is somewhat overstated.

Specifically, I would

not rate his performancé of Duly lio, 1 as "putatanding", rather i .

would

rate it "atrong". I consider Mr. Randall a capable officor, but

feul hia overall performance falls somewhero on the border of a 'Jew

stroug" and & "high proficient". Let me hasten to add that lan: fully

aalisfied with Mr. Randall'" performance in hia piooons assignniene,

and 1 have avery confidenie that be will continue so do a complesily

Thie is Mr. Randall'a first fitness report for a Headquarterg assignment

The reporting poriod (of 3 1/2 months) is too short a timo to givo a fair evalua

tion of Subjoct's performance.

This much can be said.

SUBJECT

: Chairman, DDO QSI and Honor and Merit Awards Panel

Request for a Quality Step Increase for Nt. Frederick

C. Randall, GS-14

1. On the basis of the information presented below, it is

reconmended that a Quality Step Increase be approved for Mr. Frederick

C. Randall.

Mr. Randall has been employed by the Agency since September 1951.

He has spent his Agency carcer in the Operations Directorate serving with

East Asia and Foreign Resources Divisions.

He has had field

assignments

in Jakarta and Tokyo and spent four years at FR Base, Nashington.

In early 1975, Mr. Randall was assigned to the Services Staff

to serve as the Freedom of Information Officer for the DDO.

In spite

of

the ambiguity of evolving guidelines, constant pressure of short deadlines,

a very laige volune of work and the cultural trauma the Act and its

malementation sonerated, Mr. Randall's performance has been outstanding

le is noted for his professionalism, tact, persuasiveness, analytic skills

and realistic, while tough-minded, protection of DIO sources and methods.

In addition to his FOI responsibilities, 'ir. Randall was just designated

the Privacy Act Coordinator for the DDO.

It is still too carly to predict

the actual work requirements as a result of this Act, but it is anticipated

that si. Randall will mect these added responsibilities in the same

exceptional manner as he has fulfilled his FOI duties.

tonsideration has been given to the granting of an honor anc

Nerit Award.

Horever, it is felt that a Quality Step Increase wil

provide more appropriate recognition of Mr.

Randall's outstanding

the past seven months in a very challenging and

demanding assigment.
