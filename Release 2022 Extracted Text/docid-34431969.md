purpose of Artime's visit was to recruit certain individuals from Detachment 21 to go |
to a training camp in Nicaragua. Source did not know who was present at the meeting i

4, (C) Source has heard of the existence of a group of officers in the Cuban
Officer Training Program who are considering resigning from the Program in the near

| future, At LAFB, there are a number who are waiting for the termination of their

English course to resign, while others plan to turn in their resignation after
arriving at a new station, One of them is Rene F. Sones Fisuereas 2d Lt, C2312.
397, Source believes that the reason for their leaving is that they plan to trans-
er to Nicaragua, or another overseas base, in order to continue their fight against
Communist Cuba, This group.is in contact with Pedro Acebo-Rodriguez “4nd_Antonio
Iglesias-Pons,, both of whom resigned from the Cuban Training Program upon completion
of the Course at Fort Benning and who are in Nicaragua organizing anti-Castro regime
activities, (This group’ consists mainly of men who fought in the Bay of Pigs in-
vasion of Cuba)

5S. (S) There is a group within the Cuban Officer Training Program presently
undergoing training at LAFB who are planning to submit their resignations upon
completion of additional courses. One of these individuals is Ladislao George
Fernandez-Martinez, 2d Lt, C2 312 392, The motive for presénting their resignations
is to go to Nicaragua and organize an attempt to overthrow Castro, This group is
in contact through correspondence with Pedro Acebo-Rodriguez“and Antonio Eugenio

{ Iglesias-Pons,/both of whom resigned the course while at Fort Benning in August

1963, Fernandez is expecting to hear from Manolo Artime“in order to submit his
resignation,,in late November and go to Nicaragua, Artime revealed to Fernandez
-details about his conference with Charles de Gaulle of France and Conrad Adenauer
j of Germany. Artime showed documents and pictures to Fernandez corroborating his
conferences with de Gaulle and Adenauer, Artime told Fernandez that de Gaulle and
Adenauer have promised him help to establish a camp in Nicaragua for the purpose
of taking over Cuba. Such help should start to be received by Artime after Novem-
ber 1963, Alberto Maleo Munia-Boris, 2d Lt, C2 312 400, another officer who re-
signed from. the program in August 1963 and now residing in Miami, wrote a letter

to Federico Garcia-Geli, 2d Lt, C2 312 393, LAFB, explaining his reasons for

resigning the program and requesting that the letter be circulated among the fel-
low officers of the class at LAFB, The letter said that he (Muina) left the
course because many of the men who had applied for the various schools, such as .
the Intelligence and the Armored Schools, were still at Fort Benning wasting time,
Also, Muina had applied for a demolition course and after he was placed on orders
to go to the course, the orders were cancelled. Muina did not like this and de-
cided to get out. Source, who knows Muina well, is certain that Muina is working
for or with Artime also, Muina has indicated repeatedly to his friends and to
the officers undergoing the program that Cuba will not gain its liberty with the

‘ assistance of the United States, but needs to look for help from another country.

Muina believes that the United States has decided to apply the principle of co-
existence towards Cuba. Muina also has stated that the United States Government
lacks the ability to understand the Latin American problems, and that he is going
to join Artime,

- 7. (S)_ Diego Emiliano Borges-Torres, 2d Lt, C2 312 431, is attempting to
. find out if the ultimate purposé of the Cuban Officer Traiming-Program is identical

to the program which is controlled by Manuel Artime to train people in Nicaragua.
Upon obtaining this information, Borges-Torres is going to inform Source, If the
plan is the same, everyone in the program will immediately go to Nicaragua because
in Nicaragua the fight against Castro is more imminent. Help has been offered to
Artime by Somoza of Nicaragua and by de Gaulle of France, who apparently has
offered the Isle of Martinique for the operations against Castro. Manuel Artime
visited Columbus, Georgia, a few months ago and spoke to many Cuban officers and

‘ tried to recruit them as instructors to go to the camp in Nicaragua, Source was

not present at any of the meetings with Artime,

8, (S) There is a group of officers within the Cuban Officers Training
Program at LAFB who contemplates submitting their resignations if the United
States has not done anything for the freedom of Cuba by December 1963. Many offi-
cers have indicated their desire to resign in order to join Manuel Artime who is
supposedly organizing a training camp in Nicaragua. Artime has some contacts
among the officers undergoing training at LAFB, and for a long time, these officers
have been undermining the present training program by spreading dissension among
their fellow officers, These men also have developed/a recruiting campaign to
supply Artime with qualified leaders for the Nicaraguan camp. Artime's recruiters
at LAFB are: Diego Emiliano Borges-Torres, 2d Lt, C2 312 431; Ladislao George
Fernandez-Martinez, 2d Lt, C2 312 392; Leon Dilio Carrazana, Lt, C hi

Conrado Caballero~. Acosta, 2d Lt, C2 312352, Borges-Torres is the chief represen-
tative FB, He has made“sev€ral trips to Miami recently and has been

spending much money, He also has an expensive apartment in San Antonio, Texas,
which he shares with Fernandea=Martines, Next in cotmand in the above group is
Fernandez-Martinez, Carrazana has stated to Source that he intends to submit his
resignation in December 1963 to. join Artime. Carrazana also offered Source $250
salary, plus $25 for each child he might have, plus $25 for any position he may
hold in the training camp, if he resigns and goes to Nicaragua. ‘Antonio Iglesias-
Pons will be the man in charge of the of the training camp in Nicaragua, It is
being rumored that a Latin American country is going to buy planes from England
and make them available to Artime. It is also rumored that contacts exist with
France, but Source does not know if they are with the Franch government or with
private enterprises, The Somoza regime in Nicaragua has also promised assistance

“to Artime in the forthcoming operations against Communist Cuba. In early August

1963 while at Miami, Fernandez-Martinez offered Source $500 if Source would accept
a position in Nicaragua with Artime. On or about 25 October 1963, Fernandez-

Martinez told Source at LAFB that he (Fernandez-Martinez) wanted to talk to Source
about another offer similar to the first. Source did not stop to listen as he was

-in a hurry but promised to see Fernandez-Martinez later. Source was told by one

Heriberto Villamil, a Cuban national, Private, undergoing English instruction also
at LAFB, that Luis M, Fernandez-Barrios, Ensign, 672 450, has submitted his resig-
nation in order to go to Nicaragua. In Source's opinion, Borges-Torres persuaded
Fernandez-Barrios to resign.
