FIDEL CASTRO'S SPEECH:

Fidel Castro's two-hour speech on 23 November was what

he termed an "objective analysis" of the implications of

President Kennedy's assassination.

The speech reflected an

apprehension that US policy toward him may now become even

tougher.

He said the President's death was "serious and bad

which could lead

from "a bad situation to a worse situ-

ation." He pointed out that President Kennedy's alleged

promise not to invade Cuba had been strongly attacked by those

"ultrareactionaries" in the United States who, he said

now using the assassination to create a climate of "anti-

Soviet, anti-Cuban hysteria" designed to pressure the new

President toward a Cuban policy "highly prejudicial to the

interests of peace and of mankind."

Castro began his speech by stating that he "and the

immense majority of human beings" react with "repudiation" to

the assassination,

which is not "a correct method of struggle."

While the death of the imperialist system would make Cubans

"the death of a man, even if that man were our enemy,

cannot make us happy...we must not confuse the systems with'

the men."

He said,"we always cease our belligerency at death;

we always bow with

respect at death, even if it has to do

with

an enemy."

Castro declared that the assassination can only benefit

"those ultrarightist and ultrareactionary sectors, among which

President Kennedy could not be counted."

These "most reaction-

ary forces are now breaking loose within the United States,"

he declared. President Kennedy was a strong president who

was able to control these pressures, but the new US president,

because of the circumstances inherent in his assumption of

the presidency, will not have the same strength and

authority,

Castro said.

Castro then read a series of US news dispatches referring

to the Castro-Communist affiliations of the accused assassin.

He said this was all part of the "reactionary" effort to

create a climate of "anti-Soviet, anti-Cuban

hysteria" in

the United States.

This climate of hysteria, he said, is

designed to face the new President with an irresistible pres-

sure toward a "more aggressive policy."

Castro then devoted considerable

time in an attempt to

throw doubt on the guilt of the accused assassin and to in-

sinuate that Oswald, whether guilty or innocent, was actually

a tool of the extreme rightists.

"Is he really guilty? Is

he a scapegoat?

Is he a psychopath? Or is he perhaps a tool

of the most reactionary US circles? Who is this man?

FIDEL CASTRO'S SPEECH - cont'd

Why did he go into action precisely when circumstances were

least favorable for a left-wing fanatic to assassinate the

US President?"

Castro stated that his investigation of the

"reports, statements, and publicity" on the Fair Play for

Cuba Committee in the United States failed to indicate that

there was any chapter in Dallas or New Orleans and that "we

never in our life heard of him (Oswald)." Castro then re-

ferred to US press reports on Oswald's attempt last summer to

"infiltrate" the anti-Castro Student Revolutionary Directorate

in the US and to DRE statements that Oswald was thought at

that time to be "an agent of the FBI or the CIA." "They

them, what FBI and CIA agents look like," Castro stated.

CAstro

must know, because they have many dealings

Castro then declared that, while Oswald may or may not

be guilty, it is nevertheless possible that be was "an agent

for the CIA or the FBI, as those people suspected" and could

have been "a tool of the most reactionary sectors which may

have been hatching a sinister plan, which may have plotted

the assassination of Kennedy because they disagreed with his

international policy."

"What is behind all this? What sinister

maneuver are they hatching behind all this?

Who can be re-

sponsible for the assassination of President Kennedy? And who

benefits from the assassination...except the worst reaction-

aries?"

Castro warned that

it is not possible at this point

to answer these questions, "but we do say that it is suspect,

that we must be cautious and vigilant and alert."

Castro

closed with the usual expressions of confidence that the

Cubans will be ready to meet any new crisis with resolution.

OTHER CUBAN REACTIONS TO THE ASSASSINATION:

A clandestine source reports that the chargé of the Cuban

Embassy in Santiago de Chile said that there is no doubt that

the CIA or "other Yankees" assassinated the President and that,

as a result, a third world war will start.

He also emphasized

the need for Cuba to prepare for a possible US invasion.

Carlos Lechuga, Cuban UN ambassador, issued a statement

early on 23

stating: "Despite the antagonisms exist-

Revolution, we have received with profound displeasure the

news of the tragic death of President Kennedy.

Che Guevara, in a speech on 24 November, expressed

apprehensions similar to those stated by Fidel Castro the

night before. Guevara blamed President Kennedy's assassination

and the killing of Oswald on reactionary forces in the United

States and warned Cubans that a new,

tougher policy against

Cuba will be forthcoming from the United States.

"Everything

indicates that in the next months and years world peace will

be threatened by the most unscrupulous, ferocious, and warlike

monopolistic oligarchy--and with the most murderous potential

_-that the history of humanity has every known," Guevara said.

CUBAN SUPPORT OF EXTERNAL SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITIES:

A Venezuelan Government press conference tying the arms

cache found in Venezuela earlier this month to Cuba is scheduled

for Tuesday, 26 November, according to the US Embassy in Caracas.

This is to be followed by a report to the OAS, probably on

2 December. (Am Emb Caracas 601, 24 November, CONFIDENTIAL)
