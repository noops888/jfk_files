Considering the need now to maintain contact with "assetg"

in Cuba

we asfed Subject to write a letter innediately to

aMrAsH/i and including in it the fact that his girl frlend in

Hadrid wants to write to him but does not have his address and

to please provide it as soon as possible.

. By this message,

AHLASH should send an accommodation address to his Madrid drop

guickly, that 1s, 1f he intends to keep in touch with us. Judging

by the above actions of AHLASH, we are inclined to give him

the benefit of the doubt, and feels that perhaps he did actually

forget to provide & return address in his SW letter to Hadrid.

In any case this ulll give us an opportunity to test his trueib

Inclinations. It is noted that the
