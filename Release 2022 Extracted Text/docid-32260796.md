FACT SHEET ON NAVAL INVESTIGATIVE SERVICE, 1960-64

With regard to the last two paragraphs of the undated request
received In. the Office of the Secretary of Defense on March 20, 1978,
the Naval Investigative Service has been unable to identify any 7
personnel presently or formerly associated with Its Service, or its
predecessor organizations, who were involved in the activities described.
In general, the monitoring of activities or the utilization of sources
within the Cuban anti-Castro groups in Miami and New Orleans during
the period 1960 to 1964 was under the primary jurisdiction of the
Federal Bureau of. Investigation (FBI) and the Central Intelligence
Agency (CIA). :

The NIS was established in 1966 under the Naval Intelligence
Command (NIC). At that time, the Service assumed the basic mission
of what previously had been known as the Investigations Branch (Op-921D),
and the Counterintelligence Branch “(Op-921E) of the Security Division
(Op-921) of the Office of Naval.Intelligence (ONI). During the period
1960 to 1964, the primary activity of those branches involved criminal
investigations, counterintelligence investigations, and background
investigations of Navy military and civilian personnel and Department
of Defense civilian contractor personnel for security clearance.
Contacts with both current and former NIS personnel knowledgeable of
the activities of both Op-921D and Op-921E during the period in question
revealed no recollection of assignment of agents or other employees to
maintain sources or otherwise investigate or monitor the Cuban anti-
Castro groups in those cities. Their recollection was that the FBI and
CIA did investigate such activities.

As further background, it is noted that the establishment of the
Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) in the early 1960's created shifts
of mission and personnel from ONI to that organization. Prior to the
establishment of the DIA, the structure of ONI included, in addition
to the above-mentioned Security Division (Op-921), the Intelligence
Production Division (Op-922) and the Administrative Division (Op-923).
The former, Op-922, was sometimes referred to as the Foreign Intelli-
gence Division and most of its functions were transferred to DIA.”
That transfer of functions also included transfers of ONI personnel
and records. 0P-922H was the branch responsible for collection and
dissemination of foreign intelligence. A knowledgeable individual
currently assigned with the NIC stated that the activities of Op-922H
included interviews of anti-Castro Cubans at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, but
noted that any necessary contacts or utilization of anti-Castro Cubans
in Miami or New Orleans were required to be coordinated through the
FBI or the CIA, because of the jurisdiction of those organizations in
those geographical locations.

FACT SHEET ON APRIL 12 REQUESTS CONCERNING LEE HARVEY OSWALD

The following. information has been provided by the Naval
Investigative Service and responds to those portions of the April 12,
requests by the Select Committee for all records regarding: Lee
Harvey Oswald; any and all records concerning.or referring to investi-
gations into Oswald's background ‘conducted by the 112th Military
Intelligence Group, circa 1963; a detailed statement explaining why
a photograph of Oswald in the possession of the Navy was contained
in an envelope marked "Received 14 Nov 1963'' and "'CIA 77978," and
answers to other questions regarding actions in connection with the
photograph. — 7

A written list of those persons who were either connected with,
responsible for, or knowledgeable about the Office of Naval Intelli-
gence (ONI) file pertaining to Oswald is attached, as Appendix A.

All available records held by the NIS pertaining to Lee Harvey
Oswald have previously been made available to the Select Committee,
with the exception of records which were originated by or under the
release authority of the Department of State, the Office of the Attorney
General, the CIA, the FBI, and the DIA. The latter records were
referred to those agencies for processing and a direct response to
the Select Committee.

The NIS holds no records concerning or referring to investigations
into Oswald's background by the 112th Military Intelligence Group.
Copy pages of the NIS file numbered 253 through 255 (previously for-
warded to the Select Committee) consists of a U.S. Continental Army
Command (USCONARC) message. It contains Information concerning
Oswald which was provided to the "112th INTC GP'' by an Assistant Chief
of Police with the Dallas Police Department. 7

Enclosure (1) to Appendix B is a copy of the envelope which the
Select Committee referred to in connection with a’ photograph of Oswald.
The notations on the envelope refer to a Chief of Naval Operations
(CNO) message with a date/time group of 251800Z October 1963, which
readdressed.a CIA teletype numbered 77978. The ON! file on Oswald,
which is the file maintained by the NIS, did not contain a copy of
the CNO message in question, and it is not known why a copy of it
was not contained therein. On 25 April 1978 a representative of NIS
obtained a copy of CIA teletype number 77978 of 24 October 1963
(enclosure (2), appendix B). That copy fs in the format In which the
CIA has released it. to the public in response to Freedom of Information
Act requests. Enclosure (2), is addressed to the Department of the

NW 68261 Docld:32260796 Page 8


Navy; refers to a CIA teletype number 74673 of 10 October 1963
(referring the possible presénce of Oswald in Mexico City), and requests
that two copies of the most recent photograph of Oswald be provided to
the CIA for purposes of determining whether he and the Individual in
Mexico City were-one and the same. Enclosure (3) to appendix C is a
copy of CIA teletype number 74673 of 10 October 1963. It was also
obtained from the CIA on 25 April 1978, and is in the format In which
the CIA has released it to the public in response to Freedom of
Information Act requests. The ONI file on Oswald contained a copy

of a CNO message with a date/time group of 102012Z October 1963, which
readdressed CIA teletype number 74673. A copy of that CNO message was
one of the documents referred by NIS to the CIA on 15 August 1977.

To respond directly to the Select Committee's questions, the
reason that a photograph of Oswald was at one time contained in an
envelope marked ''Received 14 Nov 1963'' and "CIA 77978" appear to be
that it was obtained as a result of the request of the CIA set forth
in Enclosure (2) to appendix B. There is no documentation in the
Oswald file revealing the manner In which the identification photo-
graph of Oswald was obtained. References to the photograph appear on
copy pages numbered 268, 278, and 282 of the material that was for-
warded to the Select Committee. Those documents are dated 22 and 23
November 1963, the day of and the day following the assassination of
President Kennedy. The references to the photograph on the copy page
numbered 278 indicated that-Admiral Taylor, who was then the Director
of Naval Intelligence (DNI), would "....require at least two extra
copies of the photograph of Oswald, for forwarding by DNI to Mexico
City, by mail, and for Mr. McCone."

On 25 April 1978, the identification photograph of Oswald which
had been mailed to Mexico City, and the envelope in which it was
mailed, were viewed at CIA Headquarters, Langley, Virginia. The
photograph was a 3'' x 3" print which was stapled to a piece of paper
indicating it had been received at 1530, Mexico City time, on
26 November 1963. The envelope indicated it was mailed, Air Mall-
Special Delivery, by CNO (Op~923M) to an individual at the Embassy
of the United States of America, Mexico City, and was postmarked on
23 November 1963. (In 1963, Op-923M was the administrative code for
the General Services Branch, Administrative Division, ONI.)

PERSONS KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT THE ONI FILE ON OSWALD

For purposes. of providing background in regard. to the list of
persons who were connected with, responsible for, or knowledgeable about
the ONI file. on Oswald, it is necessary to. understand the structure of
the ONI during the period starting when Oswald defected to Russia (1959),
to the time of the assassination of President Kennedy (1963). During
that period of time, the ONI (Op-92) consisted primarily.of three divi-
sions, the Security Division (Op-921), the Intelligence Production
Division (Op-922), and the Administrative Division (Op-923). As explained
in the fact sheet on the.NIS, the Naval Investigative Service was estab-
lished in 1966, at which time the personnel and basic mission of what
had. previously been known as.the Investigations Branch (0p-921D) and the
Counterintelligence. Branch (Op-921E) of the Security Division, ONI were
assumed. There was no ONI file on Oswald prior to his defection to
Russia. Because of his inactive duty/civilian status from that time on,
the primary investigation jurisdiction in regard to. the counterintel-
ligence interest in him rested with the FBI. This is the reason the
bulk of the ONI file on Oswald consisted of. other agency.and administra-
tive documents, and newspaper clippings. The primary responsibility for
monitoring the file within ONI was with the Counterintelligence Branch
(Op-921E), or, more specifically, the Programs Section (Op-921E2) of the
Counterintelligence Branch. In reviewing the file in regard to identi-
fication of individuals who originated administrative documentation for
signature by individuals further up the chain of command, the names of
three junior naval officers appear. This indicates that. they probably
had the period between Oswald's defection and the assassination. The
file identifies those officers as Lieutenant Junior Grade -G. M. Fredrick-
son In 1960, Lieutenant Junior Grade P. C. LeSourd in 1962, and Ensign
J. A. Hazelton in 1963. Other individuals who, because of their positions
within the ONI, or more particularly, their positions within ONI at the
time of the assassination of President Kennedy, would have become con-
nected with and knowledgeable about the file are:

° Vice Admiral Rufus L. Taylor, USN (Retired), the DNI (Op-92)
at the time of the assassination;

° Captain Robert P. Jackson, Jr., USNR (Retired), the Assistant
DNI for Security (Op-921) at the time of. assassination;

° Captain Jack 0. Johnson, USN (Retired), the Executive Officer
to Captain Jackson at the time of the assassination;

° Captain John C. Lacy, USNR (Retired), Head, Counterintelligence
"Branch (0p-921E) in 19593,

° Commander William H. Clark, USNR (retired), Head Counterintel-

FACT SHEET ON LEE HARVEY OSWALD'S SERVICE IN THE MARINE CORPS
requested in undated letter recelved June 1, 1978)

C.1. Oswald's level of security clearance was "confidential."
On September 11, 1959, a Security Termination Statement (OPNAV FORM
5511-14) was executed by Oswald.

C.2. Oswald was separated from his unit overseas due to hospitali-
zation from October 27, 1957 through November 15, 1957, and again from
October 7, 1958 through October 15, 1958.

Oswald did not sail from Yokosuka, Japan, on September 16,
1958. He remained aboard NAS, Atsugi as part of the MAG-11] rear
echelon.

C.3. Oswald was confined at hard labor from June 27, 1958 until
he rejoined his unit on August 13, 1958.

For further clarification, Oswald received a sentence for
20 days confinement in April 1958 as a result of a’Summary Courts
Martial. The confinement was suspended for six months. If Oswald's
conduct was satisfactory for the period of suspension the sentence
would not have been executed. Oswald committed another offense in
June 1958, received another Summary Courts Martial and was awarded
confinement at hard labor for 28 days. This second offense caused
the suspension of the first sentence to be vacated resulting in an
accumulation of 48 days confinement at ‘hard labor minus any credit
for good behavior.

The offenses in April and June 1958 were those of:

1. Violation of Article 92, Uniform Code of Military
Justice; Violate a lawful general order by having in his possession
a privately owned weapon that was not registered.

2. Violation of Article 117, Uniform Code of
Military Justice; Wrongfully used. provoking words to a Staff
Non-Commissioned Officer.

FACT SHEET ON RADIOGRAPH REQUEST

With respect to the May 9, 1978, request for access to
radiographs taken the. week of November 22, 1963, at Bethesda Naval
Hospital by the same unit used to take radiographs at President
Kennedy's autopsy, hospital personnel have reported that none of
the radiographs are annotated to indicate the particular instrument
used; thus, no means are available to determine which radiographs
were taken on the same unit as that used during the President
Kennedy autopsy. Additionally, the radiographs unit used during
the aforementioned autopsy is no longer in use and after a search
could not be located.
