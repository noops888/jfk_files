ne sdversi ‘oration recurding Subject, 2b was sens 1
tioned, hovevur, by four informants that Subdject's father /
wos auspeczcd of having pro-Jorian leeninga during
War #1, but these suspicions ware not verified by tho
informants. Persons interviewed vouched for Subjects i
father's loyalty at the tine of the investigation. i

It was noted that Subjsct!s Personal History
Statement dated Pebruary 16, 1945 indicates that he was |

dome on Qsteter 7, WTS sel eettien, tats

tigation verified the fact, nowever, that Subject was dom
in Chihuahua, Hexico on October 30, 1915. :

In_@ casual conversation with another ofs

Fospect to records of iis virthplace, Subject stated that:
he had no birth certificate and had moved from Chihuahua
Mexico to El Paso, Texas, with his parents, when he war,
ed ane. Subject stated that he hed never
iized that he wes born in Tidiuahua,
in high school, having proviously prestmed thet
he was bom ‘fn the “locale in which is childhood was spent,
Vizy Willcox, Arizona.

Subject staved further thes he yave tuts i
birthplece as Villmox, Arizona on his upplication fer ene |
listnont in ROTC to eliminate conflict with any previous
records which woulé then require a. of "red tape” in
making what ke considered then a minor discrepancy of no
sonsequence, inasmuch ea Nis father's naturalization autos

matieally nede him (Subject) a citizen of the United States.

it was tho opinion of the offiloer makin: thé
above report on Subjuctts birthplace, that any confit ting!
records of Subdjoot's birthplace was not due to any motives
of subterfu;je, bit was uost probably due to Subject's desire
‘to expedite his entrance into college without oncountering j
