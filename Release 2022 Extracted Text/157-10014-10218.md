About six Months before Cotlieb retired, he Tequesteq that Boston
destroy any Tecords Pertaining to a TSD Project, MKULTRA. Gotlieb
did not tell Boston why these Tecords Were to be destroyed, Boston

Was aware that these were Contract files, funded under a Special funding

Mechanism Which would not show CIA or S0vernmenta} interest, The
MEKULTRA files Consisted of 152 files dated from April 1952 through
May 1967, Boston called up al Of these fj

ORD had been keeping a list of such drugs. This Was also the primary
Source of drugs by Edgewood Arsenal which was the Army's installation +
for ©Xperimentation in chemical warfare,

Testing on Animals

In the early 1960s, Boston himself conducted Many tests of drugs on
animals, Much of this ©xPerimentation was undertaken by Contractors

Testing With Humans

Boston only knows of three materials which Were tested on humans while
he was with CTS. These were all tested on voluntary subjects from the

Agency or from Bacaville Correctional Center in Bacaville, California,

The three are as follows:

loa fluorescent chemical which when mixed with shampoo would
leave fluores cent traces on the hair, This was used for identification
Purposes, :

None of these tests caused any bad Side effects on the Subjects, Boston
has not heard of any tests every Conducted by TSD or CTS which resulted
“in bad side effects on humans. He has heard Tumors that certain tests
Were at one time conducted on unwitting subjects but he knows of none

of the Specifics,

LSD Program
a egram

Boston is aware of an Lsp Program run in the 1950s under Dr. Hank
Bortner. Dr, Bortner left the Agency many years #80 and is since
deceased, He told Boston that he had taken LSD himself during the

conducted on unwitting subjects.

It is the Office of Technical Services! Policy today not to conduct tests
of any type of Product on unwitting Subjects, no matter how harmless,
Boston believes that it has always been the Policy of TSD and CTS to
test potentially harmful drugs (such as those which influence behavior)
only on witting subjects, He would have frowned upon tests of such
Products on unwitting subjects,

The Biological Branch

The Biologica) Branch existed from 1961 through 1968. He engaged in
the following activities:

3. Animal training Programs, Started by ORD, were continued by
TSD. In particular, ravens were trained to deliver Packages, etc,

4. The Branch also engaged in an ongoing analytical Program
Wherein they would analyze any Substance brought to the Agency by

nW


The Biological Branch has never engaged in “ny positive chemical war-
fare or biological warfare activity, They would have relied on Edgewood

Warfare materials. Both these installations Were Army installations

and have been closed down,
The Chemica} Branch
nical Branch

Since 1968 the Biological Branch remerged with the Chemical Branch,
Boston states that the Chemical Branch has engaged in the following

l. The development of power Sources. This is by far the Chemical
Branch's most important activity, taking up about two-thirds of its time.
These power Sources are the types which are used by agents in trans.
mitters, etc., used in the field, These batteries must be of long-life
and of special Configurations for concealment Purposes,

2. The analytical facility previously operated by the Biological
Branch is now operated by the Chemical Branch,

c 3. training activities are carried out to trai to retrieve

4. An Agency Security pouch System has been developed which can-
not be opened without CIA being able to detect the fact that it has been
Opened,

5. Several Programs in the development of adhesives have been
undertaken to Permit the quick Planting of audio devices and to create
an adhesive for use in disguise,

6. The chemical warfare technical Surveillance Previously Carried
on by the Biological Branch is now Carried on by the Chemical Branch,

7. Some nuclear technical Surveillance is Conducted in conjunction
with the Systems Branch,

HW 50955 DocId:32423606 Page 8


8. The Branch has developed component parts for other development
and engineering branch projects.

9. The Branch is involved in a radiation health badge service for
personnel overseas.

The Chemical Branch has not been engaged in any experimentation with
drugs which influence the mind or behavior. They have not been involved
at all with drugs that would in any way affect humans. If any branch
would carry on such activity, it would be the Chemical Branch.

( The Manufacture of Poison Capsules

If poison capsules had been manufactured by CIA, the most likely place
for such manufacture would have been the Biological Branch of CTS or
TSD. Boston states that the Branch did have some capsules when he *
first came aboard (he doesn't know who developed them; they have since
been destroyed). These were hydrogen-cyanide capsules for suicides.
They could not be given to a human unknowingly as the person taking
the capsule had to crush a gas capsule with his teeth and then suck back
sharply.

Boston is not aware of any other poison capsules which have been manu-
factured by the Chemical Branch. or by the Biological Branch between
1961 and 1968. Boston reiterated that if a tasteless poison were to be
developed in capsule form, with a delayed lethal reaction, it would
almost surely be developed by the Biological Branch of TSD.

Boston stated that the Biological Branch was working with Fort Dietrich
on a dart launcher which would shoot a tiny dart which could not be felt
by the victim. The dart was large enough to carry lethal material but
it was being developed to simply immobilize victims and it apparently
was not large enough to carry sufficient amounts of knock-out material.

Boston believes he would have heard of a poison capsule project but he

is not sure. The requirement may have come to a specific individual
if it was a sensitive job.
