that DDO is referring the entire matter to the FBI and State
Department.

6. Office of Security indices are negative in pertinent
variations of the name of ZIMERI or Robert HEMMING.

7. From the name, physical description, activity, and
alleged employment, it is apparent that Gerald Patrick HEMMING
is identical with the subject of.\0ffice of Security file
429 229, who has been described as six-foot five, 250 pounds,
who is a notorious mercenary and soldier of fortune and who as
of May 1975 was ostensibly employed by a private investigation
company, TEPCOL Security (Office of Security--no record) in
Miami, Florida.

the Office of Security Miami Field Office, and JMMAVE. On

long-time record of falsely claiming Agency affiliation. In

« the late 1550's HEMMING and STURGIS, both former U.S. Marines,
joined Fi CASTRO in Cuba but returned shortly thereafter -
Claiming ¢ lusionment with the CASTRO cause. Soon thereafter,
STURGIS anized a group of mercenaries for Caribbean and

involving HEMMING, you are referred to attachments to instant
memorandua, to wit: a memorandum by the writer dated 10 June
1975 in the name of Frank STURGIS and Everett Howard HUNT, Jr.;
and an’extract from a book published in early 1976 written by
Michael CANFIELD and Alan J. WEBERMAN. The book Coup d'etat

with the assassination of..President KENNEDY. One of the najor
links attempted by the authors is through Everett Howard HUNT,”
Jr. to Frank STURGIS to Gerald Patrick HEMMING to Loran Eugene
HALL. Loran Eugene HALL was a. member of HEMMING's Interconti-
mental Penetration Force. Loran Eugene HALL received nationwide
publicity in 1967 when New Orleans District Attorney "Jin"
GARRISON alleged that HALL (and the Intercontinental Penetration
Force) was involved in the assassination of President KENNEDY
and that members of this unit were connected with CIA. GARRISON
shortly thereafter dropped his interest in HALL, but it is
interesting that he did so after Gerald Patrick HEMMING and
another cohort, Robert K. BROWN, joined GARRISCN's investigation.
