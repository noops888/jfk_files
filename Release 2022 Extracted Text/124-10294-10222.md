CIA, CARACAS,

CANNOT STATE DEFINITELY THAI THE SHOI WAS FIRED

BY MORALES OR SOMEONE ACTING FOR HIM, BUI THIS IS NOT BEYOND THE

REALM OF POSSIBILITY®

CIA, CARACAS,

SEL IEVES THAT THE ONLY PURPOSE THE ASSASSINATION

OF

'COULD HAVE SERVED WOULD HAVE BEEN TO STRAIN PELATIONS

BETWEEN VENEZUELA AND THE UNITED STATES, AND MOST CERTAINLY WOULD

NOT HAVE AIDED

TAKEN UP RESIDENCE IN AN APARIMENT, THE COST OF WHICH IS PROHIBITIVE

MORALES CONTINUES TO BE PAID BY DISIP, POSSIBLY AS A CONTRACT EM

PLOYEE, BUT HIS STANDARD OF LIVING CERTAINLY INDICATES ANOTHER

SUBSTANTIAL SOURCE OF INCOME, IF HE IS, IN FACT, PAYING HIS CURRENI.

BILLS.

CARACAS BELIEVES THAT IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, AND

THE

19?

VITUPEROUS ATTACKS MORALES HAS MADE AGAINST IHE CIA AND THE FBI,

THE POSSIBILITY CERTAINLY EXISTS THAT HE IS MENTALLY UNSTABLE, AND

MAY VERY LIKELY BE A CASTRO DOUBLE AGENT. P

LEGAT FEELS VERY STRONGLY THAT ANY CONTACT WITH MORALES BE

VERY CIRCUMSPECT, AND ANY INFORMATION FURNISHED BY HIM OR ATTRIBUTED

TO MIM, BE CAREFULLY ANALYZED BEFORE BEING ACCEPTED AS FACT. A(U).

ADMINISTRATIVE: FOR THE INFORMATION OF THE BUREAU, ORLANDO

GARCIA IS CURRENTLY CONFINED TO BED AT HIS RESIDENCE DUE TO VERY

SERIOUS LIVER PROBLEMS, HE MAS BEEN ADVISED BY HIS DOCTOR THAT IF

HE DOES NOT STOP DRINKING IT WILL KILL HIM IN SHORT ORDER. DU)

GARÇIA IS MORALES' PROTECIOR IN DISIP, AND SHOULD HE EXPIRE

OR BECOME INCAPACITATED, MORALES WOULD MOST CERTAINLY LOSE HIS

INFLUENCE WITH GENERAL GIMENEZ GAINZA AND BE COMPLETELY SEPARATED
