photographic truck was utilized on 13 September. “Photographic
coverage was requested of the!DIZTAG installation, and atcnough
the Station operates a photographic basehouse targeted against ©
this installation, HARRIDGE desired coverage of the front gate
from an angle other than that supplied by the basehouse. The
LIFIRE truck, driven by Joseph M, RESCIGNO, was parked approxi-
mately & block from the target gate. During the four hours that
the truck was "on location", Hugh T. FRANCOTTE succeeded in
photographing all individuals entering and departing the front
gate of the;DLZTAG installation. From these negatives, selected
1.D. photographs were obtained for the Station's use.

b. In preparation for a large scale photographic
operation planned for the morning of Sunday, 4 October, Gerald
F. GESTETNER requested FRANCOTTE to case and photograph a
downtown section of Mexico City where the operation is scheduled
to take place. Photographic coverage will be required from both
the LIFIRE truck and a room in a nearby hotel. The photographs
and casing report greatly assisted in. selecting the most
advantageous parking area for the truck, and the most suitable
hotel room.

c. The LIFIRE photo truck was again utilized on
23 September at the request of Phineas F. SLINKARD. 2Since there

is no longer a photographic basehouse covering the (BEDOX Embassy,
SLINKARD was intent onobtaining photographs of recently assigned
"staffers" of this installation. The LIFIRE truck, driven by
Joseph M. RESCIGNO, was parked for a period of three hours,
approximately 1/4 block from the ng Gmbassy gate, During this time
FRANCOTTE photographed numerous*BEDOX officials, enlargements

of which were incorporated into the Mexico City Station "mug" book

d. On a dark rainy morning of 28 September, FRANCOTTE
received an urgent request from Jeremy L. NIARCOS to photograph
the exterior of one of the Station basehouses targeted against
the FUSTEAL Embassy. Owing to the proximity of the target buildings,|
the photography had to be accomplished from a moving automobile
and only one pass could be attempted. FRANCOTTE, positioned in
the rear seat of a sedan and utilizing one of the new Pentax
cameras, recently supplied from KUBIOT Headquarters, was successfu
in obtaining the necessary coverage.

e. At the request of the Deputy Chief of Station and
Michael C, CHOADEN, FRANCOTTE was instructed to evacuate the
LIONION basehouse of all photographic equipment and supplies.
With the recent publication of the Warren Report, and in the
interest of security, it was felt that all photographic equipment
should be removed for a period of 6 to 8 weeks. Under the cover
of darkness on 26 and 27 September and with the aid of a rented
sedan, FRANCOTTE removed all equipment and- supplies from. the
basehouse. The lower bathroom, utilized by LIFEUD/22 as a complete
darkroom facility, and the upper bedroom and ajoining bath, used
to house the Pulse camera, Balscope and Pako print dryer, were
stripped of all work tables, shelving and cabinets and restored
to their original condition. Black-out drapes were removed and
window glass repainted. LIFEUD/22 and 23 were asked to leave
Mexico City and spend a short vacation at a nearby resort area.
They have just recently returned, and until such time that it is
deemed advisable to reinstall the Photographic equipment in the
LIONDN basehouse, LIFEUD/22 will be ocgupied in performing other
support functions for the Station.

f. During the month of September, FRANCOTTE held twenty-
two agent meetings, and was summoned to the LIONION basehouse in
an effort to repair the Pulse camera. The unusually high number
of agent meetings was attributed to the fact that FRANCOTTE was
in close contact with LIFEUD/22 during the final two weeks of

saa) September, With the malfunctioning of the Pulse camera, replace-
ment of the Exakta camera with a new Pentax, plus the necessity

b. Andrew F, MERTON, Chief of Base, Merida, was in
Mexico City for consultation of 15 September. A portion of his
