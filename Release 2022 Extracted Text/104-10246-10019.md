the request of the Deputy Chief of Station and

Michael C. CHOADEN, FRANCOTTE was instructed to evacuate the

LIONION basehouse of all photographic equipment and supplies.

With the recent publication of

the Warren Report, and in the

interest of security, it was felt that all photographic equipment

of darkness on 26 and 27 September and with the aid of a rented

sedan, FRANCOTTE removed all equipment and- supplies from the

basehouse.

darkroom

facility, and the upper bedroom and ajoining bath, used

to house the Pulse camera, Balscope and Pako print dryer, were

During the month of September, FRANCOTTE held twenty-

and was summoned to the LIONION basehouse in

an effort to repair the Pulse camera.

The unusually high number

of agent meetings was attributed to the fact that FRANCOTTE was

in close contact with LIFEUD/22 during the final two weeks of

September.
