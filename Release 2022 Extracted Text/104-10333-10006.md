Questions for Follow-up DO Records Briefing

April 1, 1997

1. At what point did the DDP begin to keep records of destroyed records? For

example, in a Cold Warrior footnote, Tom Mangold reports that as any of Angleton's

files were destroyed, "a complete record was carefully maintained about what had been

done. (George) Kalaris signed off on every file and the DCI's office was notified."

(p. 143) Where are these records?

2. Could an archival search be run on specific topics for retired records at the CIA's

Record's Center? Perhaps an ARRB staffer could be present during the search to review

the abstracts and to suggest other fields or topics to be searched?

3. Could a crypt search for records containing relevant crypts be run through

cryptographic reference? How would queries need to be framed and stated?

4. Why is it so difficult to develop a list for all personnel (official, contract,

administrative, or TDY) assigned to the post referenced in RIF 104-10065-10199 from

1959-1964?

5. We have been working to identify all technical and surveillance operations in and on

the Cuban and Soviet consulates and embassies in Mexico City between September 1

and December 1, 1963. How can we frame a search query to determine if we have a

comprehensive and complete list of all operations at that time?

6. How can a search query be framed to document all electronic take produced by the

Mexiço City Station in the immediate wake of the assassination (the first month) and

during the period of Oswald's visit? How can we verify that what exists in the

Sequestered Collection represents all records of the technical production that was

available at the time of the assassination? If additional records or original production

still exists, where would it be stored or filed? What searches could be conducted to

retrieve any additional records? If such electronic take has been destroyed, do records

exist of the destruction?

7. Could you describe the process by which operational funds are proposed, approved,

received, and distributed (circa 1963). What funding and disbursement records exist?

How are they organized? How should a request be formulated to institute a reasonable

search of these records?

8. We have seen DDP monthly operational reports which contain information on the

allocation/distribution of operational funds. Are there other DDP records which would

reflect how certain projects utilized their funding? How are these records organized?

How should a search query be framed?

9. Various open sources have linked the CLA to various journalists and publishing

companies during the 1960's. How should a query be framed to search for connections

between the Agency and journalists or publishing companies?

10. Did the Agency have any relationship, projects, or contacts with publishing houses

during the time of the assassination and in the aftermath of the Warren Commission?

How would a search be formulated to determine whether or not the Agency had a

relationship with any of the same publishing houses that were also publishing books

about the assassination?

11. How would a query be framed to search for files on any office or person dealing

with organized crime and Cuba? How should a request be formulated to institute a

reasonable search on this topic?

12. Is there a comprehensive record or list detailing the identities of individuals on the

(Interagency Source Register? How are these records organized? How can a search

query be framed to ascertain whether or not a particular individual appears in the

Register,

13. How could a search query be framed to ascertain whether or not a particular

individual was given access to classified information by DCD (then OO)? What kind of

files are assembled in the process of clearing non-Agency contacts/ sources for access to

classified information?

14. ARRB's Request for Additional Information and Record No. CIA-13, dated

November 1, 1996, contained the following questions:

A.

B.

What forms of backchannel communications were there between the

Mexico City Station (including the COS), JMWAVE, or Headquarters

during 1963? By "backchannel" we mean, inter alia, any administrative,

senior staff, or restricted access communications, or any written or

electronic communications other than regular cables or dispatches (of the

type included in the JFK Collection).

Were there, in fact, any backchannel communications between the Mexico

City Station (including the COS), JMWAVE, or Headquarters during the

time periods 27 Sept - 16 Oct 1963 and 22 Nov - 30 Nov 1963?

c..

To the extent that there were any backchannel communications for the

time periods 27 Sept - 16 Oct 1963 and 22 Nov - 30 Nov 1963 (other than

those currently contained in the JFK Collection), please make such records

available for review.

Why has it been so difficult to answer these questions?

15. ARRB's Request for Additional Information and Record No. CLA-14, dated

December 23, 1996, documented our request for the annual or biannual Station reports

for Mexico City Station for 1963 and 1964. Why has it been so difficult to provide these

reports?

16. The attached Agency document released in 1996 contains the paragraph:

11. A memorandum marked only for file, 16 March 1967, signed M.D.

Stevens, says that J. Monroe SULLIVAN, #280207, was granted a cover

ecurity approval on 10 December 1962 so that he could be used in Projec

QKENCHANT. (Clay) Shaw has # 402897-A.

What do these numbers mean? What does the "A" at the ends of Shaw's number

signify?. Do the files identified by these numbers still exist? Why was Sullivan granted

a covert security approval?

17. During the period 1959-1963, what was the purpose or goal of QKENCHANT?

18. Under what circumstances were non-agency employees given covert security

clearances for the QKENCHANT project?

19. Did Clay Shaw receive a covert security approval for the QKENCHANT project?

Why was one needed? Did Clay Shaw receive covert security clearances for any

project other than QKENCHANT

20. What did Clay Shaw do within the QKENCHANT project?

21. Do records exist to account for the disposition of all files on Clay Shaw?

22. Did Howard Hunt have any involvement with the QKENCHANT project prior to

19647

23. Did J. Monroe Sullivan have any involvement with the QKENCHANT project prior

to 1964?

Types of Questions for Follow-up DO Records Briefing

March 17, 1997

1. At what point did the DDP begin to keep records of destroyed records? For

example, in a Cold Warrior footnote, Tom Mangold reports that as any of Angleton's

files were destroyed, "a complete record was carefully maintained about what had been

done. (George) Kalaris signed off on every file and the DCT's office was notified."

(p. 143) Where are these records?

2. Could an archival search be run on specific topics for retired records at the CLA's,

Record's Center? Perhaps an ARRB staffer could be present during the search to review

the abstracts and to suggest other felds or topics to be searched?

3. Could a crypt search for records containing relevant crypts be run through

cryptographic reference? How would queries need to be framed and stated?:

4. Why is it so difficult to develop a list for all personnel (official, contract,

administrative, or TDY) assigned to the post referenced in RIP 104-10065-10199?

5. We have been working to identify all technical and surveillance operations in and on

the Cuban and Soviet consulates and embassies in Mexico City between September 1

and December 1, 1963. How can we frame a search query to determine if we have a

comprehensive and complete list of all operations at that time?

6. How can a search query be framed to document all electronic take produced by the

Mexico City Station in the immediate wake of the assassination (the fist month) and

during the period of Oswald's visit? How can we verify that what exists in the

Sequestered Collection represents all records of the technical production that was

available at the time of the assassination? If additional records or original production

still exists, where would it be stored or filed? What searches could be conducted to

retrieve any additional records? If such electronic täke has been destroyed, do records

exist of the destruction?

7. Could you describe the process by which operational funds are proposed, approved,

received, and distributed (circa 1963). What funding and disbursement records exist?

How are they organized? How should a request be formulated to institute a reasonable

search of these records?

8. We have seen DDP monthly operational reports which contain information on the

allocation/ distribution of operational funds. Are there other DDP records which would

reflect how certain projects utilized their funding? How are these records organized?

How should a search query be framed?

9. Various open sources have linked the CIA to various journalists and publishing

companies during the 1960's. How should a query be framed to search for connections

between the Agency and journalists or publishing companies?

10. Did the Agency have any relationship, projects, or contacts with publishing houses

during the time of the assassination and in the aftermath of the Warren Commission?

How would a search be formulated to determine whether or not the Agency had a

relationship with any of the same publishing houses that were also publishing books

about the assassination?

11. How would a query be framed to search for files on any office or person dealing

with organized crime and Cuba? How should a request be formulated to institute a

reasonable search on this topic?

12. Is there a comprehensive record or list detailing the identities of individuals on the

Anterageng Source Register? How are these records organized? How can a search

query be framed to ascertain whether or not a particular individual appears in the

Register,

13. How could a search query be framed to ascertain whether or not a particular

individual was given access to classified information by DCD (then OO)? What kind of

files are assembled in the process of clearing non-Agency contacts/ sources for access to

classified information?

SUBJECT: ARRB Questions Submitted for DO Briefing

I would like to address some of the concerns that you expressed at our meeting

yesterday, where we briefly discussed the Review Board's Proposed Questions for the

March 17 briefing regarding DO records. We understand that you have some concerns

about the scope of the topics raised. We very much appreciate your recognition of the

importance that we attach to the ARRB's independence and we again wish to

emphasize the fact that we fully understand your proper concern for the protection of

information that is unrelated to the Kennedy assassination.

I would like to emphasize that the questions that we sent to you were not intended as in

depth research queries, but rather as topical talking points for discussion. We prepared

the questions, at your request, in order to give the persons conducting the briefing an

understanding of the types of issues in which we were interested. They represent issues

that we wish to explore in our quest for additional information and records to facilitate

the completion of the ARRB's responsibilities under the JFK Act:

We appreciate your acknowledgment that the ARRB is not necessarily obligated to

justify to CIA the questions it deems relevant to the assassination. Nevertheless, in

order to facilitate and coordinate our efforts, we are very willing to offer the following

additional explication of those questions that we understand may häve been considered

by the Agency to be excessively broad:

Question # 5:

We have been working to identify all technical and surveillance operations in and on the

Cuban and Soviet consulates and embassies in Mexico City between September 1 and

December 1, 1963. How can we frame a search query to determine if we have a

comprehensive and complete list of all operations at that time?

Until very recently, we had seen no evidence that CIA had microphone surveillance of

the Cuban compound. However, Dispatch HIMMW 12454 (no IDEN number attached)

found in Box 23, Folder 9 of the Sequestered Collection, makes reference to LICOOLS

(concealed microphones inside the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City). Though the

dispatch reports that the last LICOOL ceased functioning in 1961--before the period in

question-the prior existence of this capability and the fact that the dispatch discusses

the possibility of reactivation prompts the question of whether all technical and'

surveillance operations against the Cuban and Soviet Consulates have been identified

to the ARRB. In addition, the dispatch refers to MKTRAP, a telephone hot mike

operation which was re-actuated from a basehouse in November 1963. The specific hot

mike telephone PRIMPULSE appears to have been in operation during 1963. Are there

records from this operation? Are there any other operations that may have picked up

Oswald's visit?

Question # 6:

How can a search query be framed to document all electronic take produced by the

Mexico City Station in the immediate wake of the assassination (the first month) and

during the period of Oswald's visit? How can we verify that what exists in the

Sequestered Collection represents all records of technical production that were available

at the time of the assassination? If additional records or original production still exists,

where would it be stored or filed? What searches could be conducted to retrieve any

additional records? If such electronic take has been destroyed, do records exist of the

destruction?

This question is a follow up to question # 5. If MKTRAP was in operation from

September 1-December 1, 1963, where are the records or transcripts describing the take?

Was the take ever retained or reviewed? Do any original tapes or transcripts still exist?

Where might these records be found? Were any other technical operations in progress?

The various project files for the technical operations known to exist during this period

are spotty and incomplete. How can the ARRB know if it has reviewed records of all

the technical operation take for the relevant time period?

Question # 9:

Various open sources have linked the CIA to various journalists and publishing

companies during the 1960's. How could a query be framed to search for connections

between the Agency and journalista or publishing companies?

The two 1967 Ramparts articles mention connections between the Agency and

journalists worldwide. The primary focus of this question is on any connection between

the Agency and any journalist who might have covered the assassination domestically.

Additionally, we would be interested in any publishing company involved in

publishing books about the assassination. HSCA staff notes (RIF 180-10142-10087)

summarize several files dealing with contacts between the Agency, publishing houses,

and authors. For example, the file identified as QKOPERA/Liaison ZRBLESS outlines

a memo by (Gunnar W. Beckman CA/PROP on the status of negotiations between

Praeger Püblishing/and Milovan Djilas. ZRBLESS is identified as a subproject of

WUBONBON. Further, the staff notes mention a project involving "Praeger and

publication" [sic], a separate project involving "the Freedom Fund and distribution"

(sic], and a third project to provide news service to the foreign press through

Continental Press. Each of these projects appears to have been in operation in 1963-64.

Question # 10:

Did the Agency have any relationship, projects or contacts with publishing houses

during the time of the assassination and in the aftermath of the Warren Commission?

How would a search be formulated to determine whether or not the Agency had a

relationship with any of the same publishing houses that were also publishing books

about the assassination?

This question is a follow up to question # 9.. One record that is already in the collection

(RIF 180-10142-10087) summarizes the Project File of WUPUNDIT and notes two 'one

time only' operations in 1963-WURAISIN and WUTRANSIT which were responsible

for publishing two books each. In addition, WUSENDER is reported to be a 'one time

only' operation responsible for three books in 1964. If these books have domestic

implications or are on subjects related to the assassination, they would be relevant

documents.

We hope that this additional explication may help you and the DO understand our

approach to the issues raised in our questiong. Should any of our requests impose or

you or your staff a burden that we may not have anticipated - or which would entai

work of dubious value or benefit — please advise us so that we can work with you to

modify or amend the requests accordingly.
