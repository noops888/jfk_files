We Discover Lee OSWALD in Mexico City

CIA did produce one very significant piece of information on Lee
OSWALD before he shot President Kennedy. On 1 October 1963, our Mexico
City Station intercepted a telephone call Lee OSWALD made from someplace
in Mexico City to the Soviet Embassy there, using his own name. Speaking
broken Russian and using his true name, OSWALD was talking to the Embassy
guard, OBYEDKOY, who often answers the phone. OSWALD said he had visited
the Embassy the previous Saturday (28 September 1963) and spoken to a
consul whose name he had forgotten, and who had promised to send a tele-
gram for him to Washington. He wanted to know if there were “anything
new." ‘The guard said if the consul was dark it was (Valeriy Vladmirovich)
KOSTIKOY. The guard checked with someone else and said that the message
had@ gone out but no answer had been received. He then hung up.

This piece of information was produced from a telephone tap center

which we operate jointly with the office of the President of Mexico. It



SECRET

is highly secret and not known to Mexican security and law enforcement
officials, who have their own center. Our joint center produces great
masses of telephone intercepts which are transcribed and reviewed by our
small staff in Mexico City. By 9 October, the OSWALD telephone conversa-
tion of 1 October had been transcribed and a summary of it cabled to
Washington. The name Lee OSWALD meant nothing special to our Mexico
City Station, but in their report they did judge him to be an American
male.

The cabled report was received in Washington on 9 October and checked
in our files, where it was immediately noted that the Lee OSWALD phoning
the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City was probably the Lee OSWALD who haa ~
defected to the Soviet Union in 1959 and returned to the USA in 1962. On
10 October 1963, the day after the report from Mexico City, CIA Headquarters
sent out a cabled report about Lee OSWALD's phone call to the Soviet
Embassy; the report went to the FBI, the Department of State (because
OSWALD was a US citizen), and to the Navy Department (because he was a

former Marine.) ‘The cabled report to these agencies highlighted the



13-00000

SC. geet €

liklikood that the Lee OSWALD mentioned was probably the former defector.
A copy of this same cable was delivered by hand to the Immizration and
Naturalization Service, with which we have no cable link. The same day
a long cable went out to Mexico City informing Aer Station of the back-
ground of defector Lee OSWALD and asking for more information. Our Station
was instructed to pass its information on the phone call to the Mexico
City offices of the FBI, the Embassy, the Naval Attache, and the Immigra-
tion and Naturalization Service. This was done.

In its original report of 9 October, Mexico City had said it had a
photograph of an apparent American male leaving the Soviet Embassy on
1. October 1963, the day OSWALD phone there. A very sensitive operation
in Mexico City provides us with secretly taken photographs of many but not
all visitors to the Soviet Embassy there, taken with telephoto lenses.
Accordingly, we cabled the Navy Department on 24 October 1963 asking for
a@ photograph of Lee OSWALD from his Marine Corps days so we could compare
photos. We had not received this photograph by 22 November 1963, but in

any event, it turned out that the man photographed outside the Soviet

al

Embassy was not OSWALD anyway. As chance would have it, none of our
several photo obsemation points in Mexico City had ever taken an identi-
fiable picture of Lee OSWALD.

Our Mexico City Station very often produces information like this
on US citizens contacting Soviet bloc embassies in Mexico City. Frequently
the information we get is extremely incriminating, and@ on one or two
occasions we have even been able to apprehend and return to the USA
American military personnel who are attempting to defect. In all such
cases, our Headquarters desk requests and obtains the special permission of
the Deputy Director for Plans to pass the derogatory information on a US
citizen to other government agencies. Derogatory information on Americans
is not treated routinely; in each case the DDP or his Assistant personally
scrutinize the information, make sure it is credible, and decide whether and
to whom it will be passed. Only in absolute emergencies is the Mexico City
Station authorized to pass such information directly to the FBI office in
the U.S. Embassy.

At this writing (13 December 1963) we do not know what action the FBI



13-00000

on

and other agencies may have taken based on our report. We surmise that the
FBI may have made local checks through Mexican authorities to see if
Lee OSWALD was actually in Mexico City on 1 October. Indeed, later in-
vestigation has confirmed all the details of his trip, where he stayed,
and what he did. To avoid crossing lines with the FBI, our Mexice Station
undertook no local investigation of its om. As we now know, OSWALD left
Mexico on 3 October and was no longer there when our report was put out.
Since this telephone tap operation is a joint one with the Mexican
Presidency, the Mexicans also had the 1 October intercept on Lee OSWALD,
but it apparently slumbered in their files until the assassination took
Place.
22 November 1963
When word of the shooting of President Kennedy reached the offices
of our operating divisions and staffs on the afternoon of Friday 22 Novem-
ber 1963, transistor radios were Leanna on everywhere to follow the
tragedy. When the name of Lee OSWALD was heard, the effect was electric.

A phone message from the FBI came at about the same time, naming OSWALD



13-00000

- SECRET
as the possible assassin and asking for traces. The message was passed
on at once by the Chief CI, Mr. Angleton, to Mr. Birch O'Neal of his
Special Investigations Unit. Mrs. Betty Egeter of this Unit immediately
recognized the name of Lee OSWALD and went for his file. At the same
time, Mrs. Bustos of the Mexico Desk, who had written our first report on
OSWALD on 10 October recognized the name from radio reports and went
after the same file. Mr. Reichhardt, Mexico Desk Chief, who was home on
leave, heard the news and phoned in a reminder that we had something on
OSWALD. While we were preparing a cable to Mexico City asking them for
more information on OSWALD, Mexico City itself heard OSWALD's name on the
Voice of America broadcast and cabled to us a reminder of the information
the Station had sent in on him.

For the next week, a dozen people in the Agency were continuously i
engaged in handling incoming messages on the case, writing reports te be
cabled out, tracing the names mentioned, and researching files. Within a
week, 27 cabled reports had gone out to the White House, the State Depart-

ment, and the FBI. Many cables of guidance and inquiry had been sent to



13-00000

our overseas stations, and many pieces of information on OSWALD and his
wife had been received back. The Mexico City Station researched its
telephone taps very thoroughly and came up with several more conversations
probably involving OSWALD, but not actually mentioning this name; these
connected him also to the Cuban Consulate in Mexico City. Several Mexicans
were arrested and questioned about his activities, giving a good picture
of what he was really up to. Many conferences were held with the FBI
liaison officer who asked us for certain actions and passed us information
from the FBI investigation. On the minus side, a host of fabricators,
some anonymous, bombarded overseas embassies with spurious tips on the case,
most of which we investigated. All of these are soon discredited, but they
are still coming in.

During this phase of our work, we served primarily in support of the
FBI, which was entrusted by the President with the major responsibility for
the investigation. The FBI was too busy to supply us with much of ite
own information, but answers were given to specific questions we posed to

assist our investigation. The Department of State did photograph its entire

file on OSWALD and pass them to us, and the FBI gave us a copy of the
Soviet Consular file on OSWALD which ha@ been publicly given by the Soviet
Ambassador to the Secretary of State. On Friday 6 December 1963, Deputy
Attorney General Katzenbach invited us to review the FBI's comprehensive
report on the case to make sure our sources were not jeopardized and that
our information was correctly quoted. We found the report highly
interesting and no threat to our security, as long as it was read only
by the authorized investigative bodies.

After the first few days, the CIA investigation of the case was

| handled at Headquarters by a small staff usually charged with investigation

and analysis of the most important security cases, and by a few officers
and analysts of our Western Hemisphere Division.
Reports From Mexico

As soon as our Mexico City Station realized that Lee OSWALD was the
prime suspect, it began re-screening all the written telephone transcripts

in its files covering the Soviet. Embassy for the pertinent period. The

actual tapes were also reviewed, but many of them had been erased after the

normal two weeks wait. Several calls believed to involve OSWALD were
discovered and their contents cabled to Washington, where they were
disseminated to the Waite House, the State Department, the Federal
Bureau of Investigation.
OSWALD's name was not actually mentioned in these ad@itional calls,
but similarity of speech and various plain points of content link them
to him. These calls are summarized below in chronological order.
They cover the period from 27 September 1963 to 3 October 1963, the whole
span of OSWALD's visit to Mexico City as later learned from travel records.
| 27 September - A man phones the Soviet Military Attache and
says he needs a visa to go to Odessa. Man answering says he should’ call
15-60-55 and ask for the Consul. Caller asks for the address, and it is
given to him. (There is no special reason for linking this call to OSWALD.)
27 September, 4305 PM - The Cuban Consulate phoned the Soviet
N
Consulate. Silvia Duran, Mexican national clerk of the Cuban Consulate
talked to a Soviet official, saying that a male American citizen was at the

Cuban Consulate asking for a transit visa to pass through Cuba on his way


13-00000

- “SECRET

to the Soviet Union. She wants to know to whom he talked in the Soviet
Consulate and who told him he would have no problem about it. If a Soviet
visa is assured, the Cuban Consulate can grant him a transit visa and
simply notify Cuban immigration authorities. The Soviet first asks her
to walt, and then she has to explain the whole thing over again to another
Soviet official, who takes her telephone number and promises to call her
back. Silvia DURAN concludes this call by telling the Soviet she herself
has moved and gives her new address for the Soviet Embassy bulletin. He
asks her to phone (Sergey Semenovich) KUKHARENKO (Second Secretary who puts
out the Bulletin) to give him the new ad@ress and he asks who the Cuban
Cultural Attache is. Silvia DURAN gives the Attache'ts name as Teresa
PROENZA and adds her telephone number.

27 September, 4:26 PM - A Soviet official calls Silvia DURAN
back and tells her that the "American" had been to see the Soviet's and
shown them a letter from the Soviet Consulate in Washington indicating that
he had been waiting for visas for himself and his wife to go to the Soviet

Union for a long time, but that no answer had come from Washington, adding



13-00000
( Cc
"SECRET

that the wait was sometimes four or five months. ‘The "American" had
shown the Soviets a letter showing he was a member of an organization in
favor of Cuba and had claimed that the Cubans could not give him a visa
without a Russian visa. Silvia DURAN rejoins that they have the same
problem; the "American" is still at the Consulate; they cannot give him a
transit visa unless he is assured of a Soviet visa, even though he just
wants to go to Cuba to whit there for his Soviet visa to be granted. He
does not know anyone in Cuba. They end the conversation on this note.
Silvia DURAN says that she will note this on his "card," and the Soviet
Ed concludes by saying, "Besides he is not known." He excuses himself for the
inconvenience he has caused and Silvia DURAN says it is all right.
28 September - Silvia DURAN calls the Soviet Embassy from the
Cuban Consulate. She says that she has the American with her again. The
Soviet answering asks her to wait. When another Soviet takes up the phone,
Silvia puts the American on. The American tries to talk Russian to the
Soviet who answers in English. The American aks him to speak Russian. ‘The

American says that he had been in the Soviet Embassy and spoken with the

Consul, and that they had taken his address. The Soviet replies that he
knows that. The American then says, somewhat enigmatically: "I did not
know it then. I went to the Cuban Embassy to ask them for my ad@ress
because they have it." The Soviet invites him to stop by again and give
them the address, and the American agrees to do so. (In this conversation,
the American was speaking hardly recognizable Russian. )

As far as our records show, OSWALD did not phone the Soviet or Cuban
Embassies again until Tuesday 1 October 1963. ‘The intervening days were a
Sunday and a Monday. The contents of his later calls seem to show he
aid not contact the Soviets on those days.

1 October, 10:31 AM - A man calls the Soviet Military Attache in
broken Russian and says he had been at their place the previous Saturday
(28 September) and talked to their Consul. They had said they would send
e@ telegram to Washington, and he wanted to know if there were anything new.
The Soviets ask him to call another phone number and gives him 15-60-55, say~ .
ing to ask for a Consul.

used his true name and which was therefore cabled to Washington on 9
October 1963.) Lee OSWALD called the Soviet Embassy and announced his
own name, saying he had visited them the previous Saturday and spoken
with a Consul. They had said they would send a telegram to Washington,
and he wanted to know if there were anything new. He did not remember
the name of the Consul. The Soviet, who was Embassy guard OBYEDKOV
replied: "KOSTIKOY; he is dark." OSWALD replied: “Yes, my name is
OSWALD." ‘The Soviet excused himself for a minute and then said they
badn't received anything yet. OSWALD asked if they hadn't done anything
and the guard replied they had sent a request but that nothing had been
received as yet." OSWALD started to say: “And what...", but the Soviet...
hung up.

3 October 1963 - Aman speaking broken Spanish at first and then
English phoned the Soviet Military Attache and asked about a visa. The
Attache's office referred him to the consulate, giving the number 15-60-55.

The caller wrote it down. The attache official shrugged off another

13-00000

ED

question about whether the caller could get a visa, and the conversation
ended. (There is no special reason to tie this in with OSWALD, who is now
known to have re-entered the US at Laredo the same day.)

Since the operation through which we tap the Soviet. Embassy phones
in Mexico City is managed jointly with the office of the President of
Mexico, the information on Lee OSWALD also came to the attention of
President LOFEZ Mateos after 22 November. The next day, 23 November, he
called it to the attention of our Chief of Station, who was already
working feverishly on the case. Similarly, the Mexicans noticed the

| involvement of Cuban Consular employee Silvia DURAN, a Mexican national.
Our Station suggested that she be arrested and interrogated about OSWALD.
The Mexican authorities had the same idea and she and her husband were
arrested on 23 November 1963, in the midst of a party at their home. ALL
the guests were soon released but Silvia and her husband were questioned
and released on 25 November 1963.
Silvia's husband, Horacio DURAN Navarro, an industrial designer,

said under police interrogation that when OSWALD was named as the assassin



13-00000

* SECRET

of President Kennedy, his wife had recognized the name and recalled she
had waited on OSWALD when he came to apply for a Cuban transit visa;

he remembered she had said she dealt with the Soviet Consulate as well

to find out whether he had a Soviet visa. Horacio DURAN recalled his wife
had said OSWALD became angry and she had to call out the Cuban Consul,
Eusebio AZCUE, to quiet him.

Silvia DURAN told the same story. She was a leftist sympathizer with
Buba and had worked for the Mexican-Cuban Institute of Cultural Relations.
She recalled OSWALD well, described him accurately, related how he had
wanted a Cuban visa but could not get one without the assurance of a Soviet
visa, and remembered his tiff with the Consul. She admitted she had phoned
the Soviet Embassy about him.

The sum total of the statements of Silvie DURAN and her husband was
to confirm that OSWALD was in Mexico to get a Cuban visa so he could wait
in Cuba for his Soviet visa. The Soviet Consular file passed to the State
Department in Washington by the Soviet Embassy confirms a long exchange

between first, Mrs. Marina OSWALD, and later her husband, and the Soviet



13-00000

Consulate in Washington about their Coan for permission to return to
the Soviet Union. OSWALD was still writing to the Soviets - Washington
about this as late as 9 November 1963.

Silvia DURAN was arrested again on 27 November and held until 29
November. She told essentially the same story over again.

Well-placed sources within the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City stated
that when Silvia DURAN was released from police arrest the first time on
25 November, she was quite pleased with herself. She told her colleagues
the same story set out above, adding only that the Mexican police had
threatened to extradite her to the United States to confront Lee Harvey
OSWALD. The reaction within the Cuban Embassy to the news of President
Kennedy's death was sombre. To date, there is noK credible information in
CIA files which would appear to link Lee OSWALD with the Cuban government
or the Cuban intelligence service,

The whole question of whether Lee OSWALD had any secret connection
with the Soviets or Cubans in Mexico cannot yet be answered, but certain

parts of the evidence indicate to the contrary. Silvia DURAN and the

SECRET



13-00000

SECRET

Soviet Consular officials spoke of him as a man with "no friends in Cuba"

on the one hand, and as a man not "known" in the Soviet Embassy, on the
other. The very openness of his visits and the phone calls speak against any
secret role. His trip to Mexico was not itself a secret act; he traveled
under his real name or a close variant of it, lived openly in Mexican

hotels, and corresponded with the Soviets through the open mailg about

it when he got back to the US. His trip to Mexico was apparently made
necessary because it was the nearest Cuban diplomatic installation where

he could apply for a visa.

& A perplexing aspect of OSWALD's trafficking with the Cubans and
Soviets in Mexico City is his assertion in his call of 28 September that he
did not know his address when he was at the Soviet Consulate and came to
the Cuban Consulate because they had it. It is hard to explain just what
he meant, but it should be remembered that he was talking in Russian, a
language he could not manage, and that when he came to Mexico he was in the
process of moving from New Orleans to Texas. He may not have memorized

his new address in Texas, whatever it was, and may not have been able to



13-00000

-.seemet

lay hands on it when he was in the Soviet Consulate that day. Perhaps
he had earlier given the address to Silvie DURAN and wanted to look it
up on her card.

A particularly sinister aspect of OSWALD's dealings with the Soviets
in Mexico City arises from the liklihood that he met with Soviet Consul
Valeriy Viadimirovich KOSTIKOV. In his 1 October phone call to the
Soviet Embassy, the guard OBYEDKOV suggests that the Consul OSWALD had
talked to was KOSTIKOV if he was dark. OSWALD seems to agree with this,
but the identification is very casual. In his 9 November letter to the
Soviet Consulate in Washington, OSWALD gives the name of the man he dealt
with as "KOSTIN," but there is no person of that exact name in the Soviet
Embassy in Mexico City. KOSTIKOV is accredited as a Consular Attache and
does actually do a lot of consular work, but he is believed to be a
Soviet KGB officer, and it is believed that he works for Department 13 of
the KGB, the Department charged with sabotage and assassinations. The
suspicion that KOSTIKOV is a KGB officer arose from his work habits, and

his association with other KGB officers. It was hardened when it was

CERICE



13-00000

found that he handled a Soviet agent who was trained to do sabotage
work and that he turned this agent over to another KGB officer who is
definitely known to work for the 13th Department. It is generally true
in KGB work that sabotage agents are handled only by 13"Department
officers.

Embassy guard Ivan Ivanovich OBYEDKOV is himself believed to be a
KGB man from previous assignments as a bodyguard and sureillent. But
unless some direct evidence of Soviet complicity is discovered, it is
most likely that OSWALD's dealing with KGB men OBYEDKOY and KOSTIKOY was
nothing more than a grim coincidence, a coincidence due in part to the
Soviet habit of placing intelligence men in the Embassies in positions _
where they receive a large portion of the visitors and phone calls. ALL
of the five consular officers in the Soviet Embassy are known or suspected
intelligence officers. Certainly 1f OSWALD had been a Soviet agent in
training for an assassination assignment or even for sabotage work, the
Soviets would have stopped him from making open visits and phone calls to

the Soviet Embassy in Mexico after he tried it a couple of times. Our



13-00000

experience in Mexico, studying the Soviet intelligence service at close
range, in@icates that they do make some mistakes and are sometimes insecure
in their methods, but that they do not persist in such glaring erecres

Some insight on the Cuban attitude toward the arrest of Silvia DURAN
and the involvement of the Cuban Consulate in the OSWALD case can be
gained from two intercepted phone calls made between Cuban President
Osvaldo DORTICOS and Cuban Ambassador to Mexico Joaquin HERNANDEZ Armas on
26 “Movember 1963, the day after Silvia DURAN was released from her first
arrest. At 09:40 AM that morning, President DORTICOS phoned the Ambassador
from Havana and asked him several questions about a report which the

Ambassador had sent in on the arrest of Silvia DURAN and the Lee OSWALD ~-

ease. The whole conversation is consistent with the theory that OSWALD

merely wanted a visa, The Ambassador did mention the altercation which

OSWALD had with Consul AZCUE, an@ he says thet Mexican police bruised

Silvia DURAN's arms a little shaking her to impress her with the importance

of their questions. They had asked her if she had been intimate with

OSWALD and she had denied it. President DORTICOS twice asked Ambassador


C _ Cc
SECRET

HERNANDEZ whether the Mexican police hed asked Silvie DURAN questions
about "money," and the President apparently wanted to know whether the
Mexicans thought the Cubans had paid OSWALD money. HERNANDEZ insisted
the Mexicans had not offered Silvia DURAN money, and DORTICOS gave

us trying to put across his point. President DORTICOS instructed
HERNANDEZ to keep on questioning Silvia DURAN and to phone him back.

At 7:39 PM that evening Ambassador HERNANDEZ did call President
DORTICOS back, saying he had questioned "that person" again and she has
nothing new to add. President DORTICOS returns to the issue of whether
“they had threatened her so that she would make a statement that the
Consulate had given money to the manti"that American." But Ambassador
HERNANDEZ persists in misunderstanding DORTICOS, answes in the negative,
and says: “Absolutely nothing was given to her." DORTICOS seems to give
up, and the conversation dies out after a few more general remarks.

We do not know for sure what made President DORTICOS press for informa-
tion about Cuban money passed to OSWALD, but rumors were current in Mexico

and even, we understand, in the USA, thet OSWALD had returned from Mexico

City with about $5,000. Perhaps DORTICOS was trying to learn whether
the Mexican police believed that the Cubans had financed OSWALD. In any
event, the Cuban Government sent the Mexicans a stiff note of protest
over the arrest and detention of Silvia DURAN, but the Mexicans

rejected the note.
