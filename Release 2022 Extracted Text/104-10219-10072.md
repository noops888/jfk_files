MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: "American Defectors to the USSR"

1, ‘The attached material was part of a soft file entitled
"American Defectors to the USSR", which was eet up by SR/6
(Support) around 1960 and maintained by various SR co:npoaents
untilca, 1963, The compilations were derived from a variety
of sourccs, and contain both classified and overt data,

2, Inthe fall of 1966, the files were turned over to CL
Staff, In most instances, basic information was then abstracted
for the US Defector Machine Program, In all instances in which
the material was unique, or represented a valuable collation effort,
it has been incorporated into the appropriate 201 file, along with
@ copy of this memorandum,

3. It ie suggested that any disseiaination of this data should
be coordinated with SB Division and with CIStaff (CI/MRO), in
view of the frequently inadequate sourcing and of the fact that
disseminations have alresdy been made through the US Defector
Machine Program,
