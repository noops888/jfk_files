I. As you will note in paragraph 7 of the Reference, we

asked SMABOVE to give us compiled information that they have on

various MHCHAOS targets. At the time they said that these con-

tained their own internal source information and could not be

passed. They promised, however, to furnish us the same material

in a form that could be passed.

The attached two books entitled

"The Black Power Movement in Canada" and "Unrest in the Academic

Community (Canada)" were recently passed to us in response to

this request.

2.

From a cursory review of the material it appears that

some of it is already known to you.

Some is overt information

while other items reflect results of SMABOVE investigations and

thorough checking. We are also attaching SMABOVE's letter of

transmittal which updates some of the information. You will note

that they invite our comments.

3. We feel that this is somewhat of a break through with

SMABOVE •

We have not received this kind of complete report from

them recently.

We intend very soon to offer some comments to

them and especially offer our appreciation. Your comments also

would be appreciated.

4. We do not know for sure if LNERGO was also given these

books.

We assume they were not.

If we determine that they were

passed to LNERGO we will let you know.

Leroy Hoger BUTCHER - student, SGWU

BUTCHER, a West Indian and a member of the SwU

Caribbean Students

Society, attended the Black University Conference

(BUC) at Howard University,

Washington, on 13 to 17 November 1968

where he stated that only by working together would Black people

achieve their objective - total liberation, black nationality and

black identity.

BUTCHER was elected Chairman of the International

was following BUTCHER's return to Montreal that the Black Students

Association was organized.

BUTCHER was one of the key leaders

during the occupation of the computer Centre at sow and was one

of those arrested during the riot.

Sidney COONTZ - Associate Professor, SFU

COONTZ, a U.S.A. citizen who was granted landed

immigrant status in Canada in 1966, became an Associate Professor

of Mathematics at SFU in January 1968. COUNTZ has a history of

Communist involvement which, although sporadic, dates back to the

1930 's.

Laughlin Bernard CURdlE - Professor, SFU

Communist fellow traveller in the mid-1940 espionage trials in the

United States and subsequently went to Colombia where he took out

citizenship.

Following this, in May 1967, he came to Canada and

has since obtained landed immigrant status. CURRIE was responsible

for a position at SFU and purposefully played down

Marxist leanings, claiming that HALPERIN had been a victim of cir-

cumstances.

1967 to attend university at SGWU.

He is considered by some parties to be extremely dangerous and.

capable of drastic actions.

He was active in organizing the

occupation oi the Computer Center at SGwU and was one of tlose

arrested during the riot.

Maurice HALPERIN - Professor, StU

HALPERI N was born on 3. March 1906 at Boston, Massachusett:

and entered Canada in the spring of 1468.

In late 1953 he left the

United States for Mexico in order to avoid testifying before a

United States Senate internal sub-committee.

In 195%, when the

Mexican Government began deporting United States Comnunists,

HALPErIN went to the Soviet Union, and became a visiting professor

at the U.J.S.N. Academy of Sciences.

He went to Cuba in Uctober

ly62 as

a professor of Economy at the University of Havana, where

he remained employed until coming to Canada.

He is currently

employed with the Faculty of Education, Behavioural Science *

Foundation, at Simon Fraser University. As noted above,

Laughlin

Bernard CURHIE lobbied very hard to have HALPERIN accepted by.

Simon Fraser University. CURRIE was aware of HALPENIN's background

and "watered it down" to get him the appointment.

Of particular interest in this case is the fact that

CURRIE and HALPERIN were associated with the same espionage group

in the United States. His application for landed status

was the

subject oi an objection by the RCMP and, as yet, no final decision
