SUBJECT: SSC Subcommittee Draft Report on Intelligence Agencies’
Support for the Warren Commission Inquiry

1. The main oroblem posed for. the Agency by the draft report
is its presentation of the AMLASH operation. It is a classic example
of selective use of quotations and of quotation out of context. Essential
features of the record are omitted, and in some instances negative
interpretation is used in place of positive facts. The chronology is
blurred in some instances, when it relates to the substantive evolution
of the Agency's’ relations with AMLASH/1. The resulting picture varies
significantly from the true nature of the operation, in terms of what
happened when.

2. ‘The SSC Subconmittee draft may well] make a valid point, in
contending that the Agency did not do a detailed review of possible Cuban
involvement in President Kennedy's assassination, in contrast to the
exhaustive analysis of possible Soviet involvement. The draft report makes
the point that ‘the Warren Commission did not ask it, and the Agency did not
do it on its own initiative. The preliminary reaction of the DDO representatives
who read the draft report, is that the draft is correct in ngting the limited
effort on the subject of Cuban involvement. While there areavariety of
explanations for this, the fact remains that it is explanation instead of a :
record of performance. What such an inquiry would show -- or not show -- is
not the question, but whether an inquiry was made. This point, while made
in the draft report, becomes almost subihimimal to the heavy emphasis given
the significance of the AMLASH operation. The fascination with the operation,
and: its detailed’ erroneous ‘treatment, does a disservice to the purpose of
the paper. Its extensive, repetitive treatment has been made such a part
of so much of the paper that only highly competent editorial revision can be
expected to correct it in the time reportedly available.

3. The focus of the SSC Subcommittee draft report is not fixed on the
scope of CIA operations against Cuba and Castro, and the failure of the
Agency to review these activities in the context of the Warren Commission
inquiry. It emphasizes one particular operation in support of its main
conclusion. Most of those familiar with the operation will agree that it
eventually developed into assassination plotting. Some Agency personnel --
directly involved at the time -- will not accept this characterization, drawing
a line in their own minds as to how far they went. However, to most of those
not so involved, the AMLASH operation did progress to the point that CIA
agreed to provide equipment for an assassination attempt against Castro, this

support constituting participation in whatever was to follow. The

key point, in considering the SSC Subcommittee paper, is when AMLASH/1
could reasonably have believed that he had official U.S. support for

such ‘specific action, ‘and.when Castro could have learned of this in ~
reference to the assassination of President Kennedy. The question _
presented-in the draft report ‘is whether the AMLASH operation reasonably
could: have ‘led to the President's assassination, and. whether CIA therefore

_ Should have reported it, as such, to the Warren Commission.

4. The draft report seeks ‘to establish that (1) the AMLASH
operation’ was an assassination plot on’ the part of CIA for a substantial
period preceding. President Kennedy's assassination, and (2) it was so
insecure that Castro not only could have, but most likely did, become aware
of it in time to serve as a motive for retaliatory action against President
Kennedy. If, in.fact, CIA's posture vis-a-vis AMLASH/1 provided no reason-
able grounds for him ‘to’ believe that he had U.S. support for the assassination
of Castro during the period preceding Kennedy's assassination, this central
thesis of the report suffers at its inception. As a matter of interest, at
this time the report appears ‘to accept the operations with the criminal
Syndicate'as successfully secure. :

5. There is a‘relatively objective basis for testing the various
interpretations to be offered at this time. In 1967 the Office of the
Inspector General investigated’ CIA plots against Castro (among others)
and prepared a report on the subject. That was done to record the
essential aspects of the operations, and not in anticipation of an issue
such as the present one.* The reports were in considerable detail; in
fact, they presented considerably more detail on the substantive develop-
ment of the AMLASH relationship than is included in the draft report of the
SSC Subcommittee. Written for.most limited dissemination (one copy only,
for the DCI) at a time apart from the present issue, it cannot easily be
dismissed as special pleading today. Where its reported facts contradict
assertions of the draft report they should be faced head on. :

6. The attached package consists of a series of preliminary comments
on the SSC Subcommittee. draft report. Some are simple editorial critique
(although the first couple of pages include relevant portions of the 1967
report by the CIA Inspector General), some raise questions of fact for
internal CIA checking, and others present points for possible security
consideration. Copies are being sent to the representatives of the Office
of Security, Cl-Staff, LA Division and to Mr. Bolten. We should be prepared
to discuss our approach Tuesday afternoon at 1400 in the Review Staff
Conference Room.

Line ll. The word "agents" may describe FBI employees,
but it is not a term ordinarily applied to CIA staff
employees.

2d complete paragraph, 2d line. The phrase "backed by
CIA," in describing the Bay of Pigs operation, is im-
precise. CIA was the government instrument for con-
ducting the operation, but there was considerable other
participation in an operation that was "backed" by the
government,

Characterization of the Castro plots as another method
of achieving a change of government" is imprecise; it
suggests a degree of separation from other government
activities that is not that clear. The so-called first
phase of the operation involving the criminal Syndicate
was coincident with the Bay of Pigs and more logically
part of that overall government program, however
compartmented in its own activity. The so-called second
phase was moze than coincidental, the case officer being
the CIA representative in MONGOOSE activity. It may
be an interesting editorial phrase, but imprecise.

The statement that the FBI knew about these plots by at
least May 1962 needs some elaboration. These plots
didn't involve AMLASH/I at that time, so far as
assassination was concerned. This also has to be
reconciled with the statement at page 12 that gives the
date of FBI learning of it as July 1964. The first was
prior to AMLASH/I's involvement in plotting assassination
with CIA, and the second is long after the Kennedy
assassination. If reference is to FBI knowledge of the
involvement of the criminal Syndicate, it has to refer to
more than knowledge of the contacts, but also the substance
of the operations. Something is amiss here.

2nd and 3rd paragraphs. The status of operational
activity in June 1973 was that there was no activity in

. the Syndicate operations for months (it had been agreed

that they were discontinued), and there had been no
contact with AMLASH/1 since August 1962. In the latter

-case AMLASH/1 was given no encouragement 6n his

thoughts that Castro had to be killed, so far as U.S.
support for it was concerned. Statements by Castro
about retaliation for "terrorists" had to apply to other
activities.

Paragraph bottom of page (continuing to page 9).
References by Castro (12 September 1963) to "covert
activity" undoubtedly referred to the not-so-covert
activity of MONGOOSE operations. This mixing of
general operational aggression--short of open war--
and individual operations, makes the editorial treatment
of the draft report difficult to read. It is pretty loosely
done.

Bottom of page, speaking of 29 October 1963 meeting
‘between AMLASH/1 and Fitzgerald, the draft report
says". . . within weeks of this meeting CIA escalated
the level of its covert operations, telling AMLASH the
United States supported his plan."

This misrepresents what AMLASH/1 was told,
and tries to raise the inference of a connection
between that version of what was said and other
operational activity. There is.no planning
relationship between the inconclusive relationship
with AMLASH/1 and what was then going on urider
MONGOOSE.

The meeting with Fitzgerald, preparing for it,

and what followed, is key. to how the relationship:
with AMLASH/1 was at that point,

In advance of the meeting, as shown in the 1967
IG report, the written plan was that AMLASH/1 be
given "assurance of full U.S. support if there is

a change of the present government in Cuba. "'

The record of what happened at the meeting was
recorded afterwards as follows: "Fitzgerald
informed (AMLASH/1) that the United States is
prepared to render all necessary assistance to
anti-communist Cuban group which succeeds in
neutralizing the present Cuban :leadership and
assumes sufficient control to invite the United
States to render the assistance it is prepared to
give. It was emphasized that-the above support
will be forthcoming only after a real co! been

effected and the group involved is in a position to

request the U.S. (probably under OAS auspices)
recognition and support. It was made clear that
the-U.S. was not prepared to commit itself to
supporting an isolated uprising as such an up-
rising can be extinguished in a matter of hours
if the present government is in-tontrol of Havana
- . . ' Emphasis supplied.

Recollections of the meeting amplified the written
report, as recorded in the 1967:IG report. AMLASH/1
wanted a high-powered rifle with telescopic sights
to kill Castro. Fitzgerald wanted no part of such a
scheme and told AMLASH/1 that the U.S. simply
does not do such things; Interesting confirmation
of this is found at page 134 of the Subcommittee
draft report, in a summary of an FBI report of
July 1964, some eight months after Fitzgerald met
with AMLASH/1 in Paris. The Subcommittee

draft cites that report to prove something else, ~
but it really is relevant here. —

AMLASH/1 is quoted in July 1964 as saying
that Robert F. Kennedy had refused U. S.
involvement in the assassination of Castro.
And where would AMLASH/1 have obtained that
impression? At the 29 October 1963 meeting
where Fitzgerald had represented himself as
speaking for Robert F. Kennedy.

At a subsequent meeting between AMLASH/1

and the case officer, AMLASH/I1 professed
satisfaction with the policy discussions (he had
been told, as noted above, that an anti-communist
coup group, if successful would be supported)

and was reported as follows: "but now desired to
know what technical support we could give him."
He didn't give up easily! But the author of the
SSC Subcommittee draft sees this as the condition
by him for further meetings--or so he said in
discussions of the draft paper. AMLASH/I's
views were relayed 14 November 1963 through a
close friend in the U.S., expressing his dis-
satisfaction with U.S. unwillingness to provide
"technical assistance. "'

As of this time it should be reasonably clear
that AMLASH/1 had no basis for thinking that

he had: U.S. --or CIA--support for assassination
of Castro. Whatever developed later, this is
significant in how one treats the operation as a
basis for what Castro could have learned if he
knew what AMLASH/1 knew.

On 19 November 1963 Fitzgerald approved--in
Washington--providing AMLASH/1 a cache in
Cuba, with high-powered rifle and telescope.
Also plans were made to prepare a Papermate
pen with a hypodermic that could be used in
administering poison to Castro. AMLASH/1
did not know of these developments until he
‘was met by the case officer on 22 November 1963
in Paris, the date of President Kennedy's
assassination, The development was too late
to provide a basis for any retaliatory action by
Castro against Kennedy, if he learned of it.

. As a matter of added relevance, it is noted
that the ublic trial of AMLLASH/1 contained no
reference to this phase of his activity. Nor did
the book provided by Castro to Senator McGovern
about plots against his life contain any reference
to this period, so far as AMLASH/1 involvement
was concerned, referring to the later period
instead.

The full chronology of the AMLASH/1 operation
makes it clear that the SSC Subcommittee draft

is in error in attempting to make the AMLASH
operation the basis for a claim that it could, Becerreen'e
of itself, have led to a retaliatory act by Castro :
because of its threat on his life. It simply does

not fit.

Page 12. Allen Dulles "probably did not know about the AMLASH
operation, '' as stated in the SSC Subcommittee draft
report. However, even if he had, the chronology above
would have led him to consider it irrelevant to the task
of the Warren Commission,

Page 12. Line 8. Reference to FBI first learning of the AMLASH
operation in July'1964 (see page 8 for statement it first
learned in May 1962).

Page 13. Ist complete paragraph. This states that the AMLASH
plot was "of far greater relevance to the Warren
Commission work.'' That, of course, is the issue. Further,
those willing to testify to the AMLASH plot would have
had to be knowledgeable of it in detail, or what they said
would have had to take into account the sequence of events
as they relate to when it associated the Agency with
AMLASH/I1's plans, which were following the Kennedy
assassination.

Page 14. "Moreover, there is evidence that CIA's investigators
made requests for files which should have given knowledge
of the AMLASH operation, but for some reason they did
not acquire that knowledge."

To check. What was requested, and how would
the request have produced information on
compartmented operations that those involved
may not have considered related?

Page 15. "Although this report (1967 IG Report) raised the
questions of a possible connection between the CIA's
plots against Castro and the assassination of President
Kennedy, the report was apparently not furnished to CIA
investigators who had been ordered that year to review
again the assassination investigation. Once again, although
these CIA investigators requested information that should
have led them to discover the AMLASH operation, they
apparently did not receive the information."

First, what was requested, to whom? Second,
the report will be read again to see what
connection it saw between the various plots

and the eventual assassination--there may have
been some recognition of the concept, but at this
writing I recall only noting possible connections
between people in the various operations.

‘Thus, the Select Committee has found that the CIA on
several occasions failed to investigate the possibility
of a connection between its own assas sination plots,
especially the AMLASH plot, and the assassination of
President Kennedy.."'

The fact is that the possibility was not investigated,
at least so far as I know. It probably would be
less dramatic, but more responsible, to observe
that there was no investigation of possible
connections between all CIA activities against

Cuba and the Kennedy assassination. In any

event, the "especially" aspect of the AMLASH

plot is treated above.

quarters on September 7,"'

The author, in discussions, revealed that he
sees the significance of this passage in terms
of CIA dealing with AMLASH/1 on his requests,
and therefore being compromised by accepting
them as a basis for the next meeting.

The draft report, commenting on the Harker interview
with Castro, says "AMLASH not being a terrorist."
We agree, and it might be suggested that the statements
on page 8 be made consistent with this.

The draft report also says - "none of this other

Did the FBI learn the "details" of the AMLASH operation in
duly 19642 Perhaps the contact, but what details? The
eri summary most likely takes a few liberties
with this.

If Alvarado is "D", this tells who he is, if it is important.

It isn't clear from the text whether it was the Mexican’ police
or-CIA that denied the FBI's repeated requests to interrogate "D".

Did CIA "usually" check with the FBI before supplying information
to the Warren Commission?

Footnote*. "FBI documents also reveal that James Angleton of
the CIA passed information he received about the Warren
Commission investigation to the FBI. On 5/13/64 he contacted
William Sullivan stating 'that it would be well for both McCone
and Hoover to be aware that the Commission might ask the same -
questions, wondering whether they would get different replies
from the heads of the two agencies.'" He is then described as
giving some sample questions and answers: Was Oswald ever a

a CIA agent? No.-- Is there any evidence of a conspiracy? No.

What was Angleton's record during this period.
Did he try to fix the responses, as inferred?

The report notes that while CI Staff was responsible for
liaison with the Warren Commission, it says "They were:not,
at this time, affiliated with CIA's Cuban affairs staff,"
although later SAS is described as having its own CIA Staff
which coordinated with Angleton's shop. Perhaps we should
ask that the statements be reconciled.

Footnote*. "The counterintelligence Staff of CIA at that
time handled al] matters relating to the activities of
hostile intelligence agencies, except for the activities
of Cuban intelligence."2???

The report notes the Soviet orientation of "CIA's staff,”
presumably the CI Staff, and makes the point that there was
no corresponding analysis of pro-Castro or anti-Castro groups.

In October 1963 the FBI could have had no factual

knowledge of the "assassination aspect of the AMLASH" -
operation, as CIA had no such relation with AMLASH/1 at
that time. The report should be corrected here (see supra).

The report cites a July 1964 FBI (from the CIA contact with
AMLASH/1?) quoting. AMLASH/1 in his being disgruntled over
Robert F. Kennedy having refused to support Castro's
assassination. This is cited to show something else, but
in fact it supports the 1967 IG report in what Fitzgerald
told AMLASH/1 at the Paris meeting in October 1963.

How could a "desk officer" who was unaware of the AMLASH
operation at the time it was going on, and didn't learn of it
until he was testifying (when’what he knew of ‘it was the
characterization of the questioners then) have.a relevant

opinion to the Kennedy assassination? Yet he is quoted as an

authority. :
Now really!

The quoting of David Belin about assassination, when he was
speaking generically (as it appears in the text of the report)
and not about AMLASH, seems a bit strained, so far as relevance
is concerned. The same applies to Griffin, whoever he is.

That Halpern viewed AMLASH/1's being offered the hypodermic pen
in Paris as "ironic," isn't relevant to the significance of the
incident, which is that it was 22 November 1963, the date of
President Kennedy's assassination, too late to have affected
Castro's opinion on-an operation against the President. This
is a bit of editorial self-indulgence on the part of the writer.

If AMLASH/1 were a “provocation,” as suggested briefly, would

othe logic of itihave:led Castro to be.so upset. by the results of

his own "provocation" that he would then send an assassin'to the
U.S.? And then fail his own, provocateur for several years?

AMLASH/1 was about prior to Kennedy's death.
This really gets the time sequence mixed up.

Who is "A''? It quotes him as having views that
really are not supported by where CIA's relations

-with AMLASH/1 stood at the critical time. . He has

to be identified somewhat better than this to be given
credibility. SU aurea AS slatemeutt
This section claims nptfone lity on CIA's part to see
a possible connectiomin 1965 and the AMLASH security
in 1963. It also says that the FBI made a connection

between A's 1963 activities and his 1965 knowledge.
Can we throw any light on this presentation?

Attorney Morgan named. Does this matter to us?

The report says that the 1967 IG report treated "the
AMLASH operation from 1963 through 1965 as an
assassination operation." :

The 1967 IG report did characterize the operation
as an assassination operation. But at the time

of its writing no one claimed it to be nor not to be
that sort of activity at any particular point in time,
The detailed recitation shows the transition of the
relationship from a general one, in which CIA

was saying "no" to AMLASH/I's request for
support in both his coup and the assassination of
Castro, to-the time that it was giving him limited
equipment in the post-assassination period. It is

correct to say that the relationship assumed the
character of association with AMLASH/I's plans
for assassination in 1963, but that was not known
to AMLASH/1 until the very day of the Kennedy
assassination, This is hardly a bit of professional
responsibility on the part of the author of the
report,

General, Cables are quoted, date and time group given, and IN
and OUT numbers as well as DIR numbers. The SSC
report on alleged assassination handled this by giving
the dates of the cables, stating the sender (Kinshasha,

‘ etc.) and quoting without paraphrasing. That seems
a proper way to handle this.

General. Names of Agency employees already reported in the ©
report or alleged assassination are repeated here. Names
reported and not identified: Alvarado, Griffin. As noted,

Morgan's name may have been printed by error, as he is
otherwise identified as an attorney.
