In early 1467, BROSE received a Canada Council grant for research

on Mexican politics and, in the fall of 1967, visited Cuba.

BROSE, one of the first exponents of academic freedom and tenure

of appointments at SFU, was a key spokesman during the CAUT censure

. of the SFU administration issue. He supported the radical group's

= attempts to push faculty demands on academic and administration
matters to the extreme.

Leroy Roger BUTCHER ~ student, SGWU

BUTCHER, a West Indian and a menber of the SGWU
Caribbean Students Society, attended the Black University Conference
(BUC) at Howard University, Washington, on 13 to 17 November 1968
where he stated that only by working together would Black people
achieve their objective - total liberation, black nationality and
> black identity. BUTCHER was elected Chairman of the International
‘Black Student® Union organized at the BUC and plans were made for the
Union to operate in every university in the Western Hemisphere. It
was following BUTCHER's return to Montreal that the Black Students
Association was organized. -BUTCHER was one of the key leaders
during the occupation of the Computer Centre at SGWU and was one
of those arrested during the riot. o

ZH Laughlin Bernard CURRIE - Professor, SFU.

CURRIE, formerly an American citizen, was implicated as a
Communist fellow traveller in the mid-1940 espionage trials in the_
United States and subsequently went to Colombia where he took out
citizenship. Following this, in May 1967, he.came to Canada and
has since obtained landed immigrant status. CURRIE was responsible
for interviewing and recommending Maurice HALPERIN, described below,
for a position at SFU and purposefully. played down HALPERIN's
Marxist leanings, claiming that HALPERIN had been a victim of cir-
cumstances, .

Kennedy Jerome FREDERICK - student, SGWU

FREDERICK, a West Indian, arrived in Canada in August
1967 to attend university at SGWU. FREDERICK is a member of the
militant Negro movement at the University and advocates violence.
He is considered by some parties to be extremely dangerous and
capable of drastic actions. He was active in organizing the
occupation of the Computer Center at SGwU and was one of those
arrested during the riot.

YE Maurice HALPERIN - Professor, SFU

: HALPERIN was born on 3 March 1906 at Boston, Massachusettg
and entered Canada in the spring of 1968. In late 1953 he left the
United States for Mexico in order to avoid testifying before a

, United StatessSenate internal sub-committee. In 195#, when the
Mexican Government began deporting United States Communists,
HALPzrIN went to the Soviet Union, and became a visiting professor
at the U.5.S.n. Academy of Sciences. He went to Cuba in October
ly62 as a professor of Economy at the University of Havana, where
he remained employed until coming to Canada. He is currently
employed with the Faculty of Education, Behavioural Science
Foundation, at Simon Fraser University. As noted above, Laughlin
Bernard CURHIE lobbied very hard to have HALPERIN accepted by

Simon Fraser University. CURRIE was aware of HALPERIN's background
and "watered it down" to get him the appointment. 1

Of particular interest in this case is the fact that
CURRIE and HALPERIN were associated with the same espionage group
in the United States. His application for landed status was the
subject oi an objection by the RCMP and, as yet, no final decision
has deen made by tne Minister of Immigration.

f Alfred Alan HERZOG ~ graduate student, McGill University

HERZOG, a U.S.A. citizen, travelled to several Canadian
university campuses with gRobert CRUISE, a leader of the Inter-
nationalists (pro-Chinese Communist), in their promotion of the
Canadian Student Movement. He is a member of the Intellectual
and Patriotic Workers of Quebec (les Intellectuels et Ouvriers
Patriotes du Quebec - IOPQ), was involved in the occupation of SGwW
in February 1964 and is a close associate of the leader of the :
Incernationalists H.S. BAINS (see APPENDIX 14).



é ia = acu -

‘ of the SDU at SFU, consists of left-wing activists? in this
category. Martin LONEY, who was one of the student leaders
during the SFU incident, entered Canada as a British citizen in
August 1966. Dr. Thomas Burton BOTTOMORE , a leading Marxist
and author on Marxism as well as a British citizen, took up
employment at SFU in 1965 as head of the Department of Political
Science, Sociology and Anthropology (PSA). BOTTOMORE, as head of
the PSA, was responsible for the hiring of Kathleen ABERLE, a
British citizen, and of Thomas Harold BROSE, John William Carl
LEGGEIT, Mathan POPKIN and Martin NICOLAUS; all U.S, citizens,

Although the largest concentration of foreign radicals
at SFU was in the PSA, other activists did take positions in
other departments.2 These included Sidney COONTZ, Michael Allan
LEBOWITZ, Paul Edward IVORY, and Maurice HALPERIN, all U.S.
citizens, and Laughlin Bernard CURRIE, a citizen of Colombia.

Mordgcai BRIEMBERG, who took over as head of the PSA
Department after BOTTOMORE tendered his resignation in 1967, has
expressed a desire to remain as Department head in order to keep =
his hand in on the hiring. In this regard, Gerald SPERLING is, Ze
through BRIEMBERG, making efforts to get ‘Maicoim SY) SYLVERS,.an American
Marxist university professor who apparently worked for r the Communist
bk hee in Italy during the early 1960's, into SFU.

Professor Donald E. EPSTEIN of the Political co
Department at the University of Waterloo, an American citizen
described as a draft dodger and.an SDS member prior to his arrival
- Canada“in 1967, as previously indicated, has been active in
organizing and directing students in tacties and methods by: which
, they could take physical possession of university buildings. :
! / EPSTEIN, who has been active in student power activities at
Waterloo, has apparently been refused tenure at that University
and there are indications that activist students intend to challenge
| administration in this regard.

Professor Norman STRAX, 2 an American who was employed
‘as an Assistant Professor of Physics at the University of New
Brunswick, precipitated the crisis at that University. STRAX was =~
instrumenta] in the formation and activities of the SDS branch at
that point.
