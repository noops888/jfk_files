GAMBLING INTEREST IN GUATEMALA AND BRITISH GRAND BAHAMAS

NO T-33 advised on May 14 and 41,

, 1964, that he had"

received information that CARLOS MARCELLO had an interest in, a

gambling casino that had recently opened in the British Grand

Bahamas.

This source stated he did not know if it were true,.

but that MARCELLO had once had a casino in Guatemala and therefore

should have sufficient contact to set himself up in a casino in the

Bahamas. Source advised that he had no details regarding either

casino.

The source advised that some local gambling contacts were

trying to obtain work in the Grand Bahamas and it was through these

sources that he had obtained this information.

ATTEMPT OF MARCELLO TO INFLLTRATE THE JEFFERSON

PARISH SHERIFF'S OFFICE

On June 8, 1964, NO T-32 advised that approximately one

month previously he

arrived in New Orleans and approached VICTOR

MARCELLO, whom he had met in the past years through his former

wife. He told VICTOR MARCELLO that he was presently unemployed,

having spent the last six months on a farm at Pine Hill, Alabama,

(which is true) and was desirous of getting with someone where he

could make some quick money. VICTOR MARCELLO referred him to

CARLOS MARCELLO and NO T-32 went to the Town and Country Motel,

1225 Airline Highway, Metairie, Louisiana. NO I-32 stated that

told CARLOS that he had been referred to him by VICIOR MARCELLO

and he was, as he had told VICTOR, desirous of making some quick

money.

NO T-32 said that CARLOS told him to check into the Town

and Country Motel and he would consider giving him something to do.

Approximately two weeks ago, after several conversations with

CARLOS MARCELLO, CARLOS told

him to go to ALWYN CRONVICH, newly.

elected Jefferson Parish Sheriff, and apply for a position as

deputy sheriff.

CARLOS stated that he wanted to infiltrate the

Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office so that he would be aware of

What was going on there. NO I-32 stated he has informed CARLOS

as well as CRONVICH that he had formerly worked furnishing infor-

mation to the FBI, as well as having been a police officer and

having worked for several county solicitors offices in the state

of Alabama.

He stated he also told CRONVICH that the latter

could check him out through the FBI.

On

Thursday, dune 4, 1964, upon the suggestion of CARLOS

MARCELLO, NO T-32 returned to CRONVICH to determine what happened

to his application

for employment and was told by CRONVICH that he

was still checking and,

in addition, was having some trouble with

the parish officials in

that they wanted him to limit his

employees to individuals from within Jefferson Parish. CRONVICH

told NO T-32 that he would be able to give him a definite answer

as to his employment with him within three weeks.

NO T-32 stated that he reported this back to CARLOS

MARCELLO and CARLOS told him that he was satisfied. CARLOS also

told NO T-32 that the three parish commissioners from the area

known as the West Bank were all his men and that he "owned" the

Highway Patrol from the top down.

NO T-32 stated that he has

received no bill for his living quarters and further he has made

telephone calls to individuals, and from conversations he has

had with CARLOS MARCELLO and another individual who works where

NO T-32 lives, whom NO I-32 does not know

and who advised him he

was not the son of CARLOS MARCELLO but that CARLOS MARCELLO had

raised him, that CARLOS MARCELLO receives a report on each

telephone call that NO T-32 makes.

NO T-32 advised he felt that CARLOS MARCELLO already

controls Sheriff CRONVICH to an extent. He stated that he bases

this belief on two things:

1. CARLOS MARCELLO made the statement to him that when

CRONVICH was seeking election, CRONVICH sent word to

MARCELLO asking MARCELLO what he wanted in the event CRONVICH

were elected and, according to NO T-32, CARLOS MARCELLO stated,

"Not a G... D... thing:"

2..

When NO T-32 was last at the Sheriff's Office

to discuss his

prospéctive employment with CroNviCh,

he saw another individual whom he has seen in contact with

CARLOS MARCELLO, at the Sheriff's Office. NO T-32 stated he

was not sure whether this individual was

working at the Sheriff's

Office or just another individual in the same position as he,

that is, applying for employment.

NO T-32 stated that on the morning of June 8, 1964,

CARLOS MARCELLO asked him if he could get any information from

the FBI at Mobile, Alabama, and NO T-32 replied in the affirma-

tive, stating he

felt that

he could. MARCELLO then requested

NO T-32 to determine anything derogatory about a hit-and-run
