FROM :
SUBJECT : OU agested Graphological Assessment of OSWALD
Handwriting

1, I discussed this informally with Mr, Arthur Tooley, CI Staff,
who is knowledgeable on the OSWALD Case, Mr. Pooley mentioned that a
graphological assessment had not. been done to his knowledge to determine
if personalii
Mr, Dooley questioned whether such an assessment would really nake a
worthwhile or reliable contribution to the issue of OSWALD's motivation,
and warrant the time and expense involved; that if such an assessment - |
was attempted in any formal sort of fashion, the "official results .. |
may only add confusion to the motivation issue, since such results i
would not have truly scientific validity. He noted that the samples,
to his recollection, represented various environmental conditions ranging !
from nontal passport applications, to condensed diery notations and notes; j
that @ child's handwriting changes from grade school to college as the j
speed of notetaking increases and the pressure mounts. In this case you |
are dealing with a disturbed mentality as well, a ||
|
2. Based on his familarity with the case Mr. Dooley feels that
CSHALD!s motivation is largely explained in tenns of his neurotic background, |
his failure to achieve status, and his very deep resentment to all authority. /
After his stay in the Soviet Union, CSWALD's writings indicate that ho felt |
neither society had sch to offer; and in effect, he rejected both. yop
3.. Mr. Dooley noted that undoubtedly other factors came into play to
formulate CSNALD's idea to assassinate the President. For example, OSWALD |
Saw a movie on TV about an attempted presidential assassination with a rif]. |
shortly before his deed, which could have sparked him into action. As the
Warren Commission has indicated, the real motive may never be known. |

4, Mr, Dooley said that the files are available for inspection by ari
SB officer at any time to look for handwriting samples or. any other purpose,

Gegviey of the obove, he did not feel that anything could be proved for
stan therefore questioned the merit of the suggestion at this time.
