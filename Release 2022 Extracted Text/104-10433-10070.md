DIRECTOR 49260

1. Forwarded herewith is a pamphlet prepared by the Japan.
"Peace for Vietnam” Committee (BEHEIREN) for distribution to U.S.
Servicemen stationed in Japan or visiting Japan. . BEHEIREN activists
are distributing these pamphlets outside major U.S. bases throughout
Japan. BEHEIREN had planned to drop copies of this pamphlet over
the USS ENTERPRISE and the U.S. Navy Base at Sasebo during the
ENTERPRISE's visit there this month. However, this planned action
fell through due to BEHEIREN's inability to obtain the cooperation
of a Japanese newspaper, MINAM KYUSHU SHIMBUN, in obtaining a
helicopter for the exercise. POFRAGRAN obtained this pamphlet
from BEHEIREN headquarters in Tokyo on 16 January.

\. 2. FSTA-53886, which forwarded & locally distributed BEHRIREN

\ propaganda poster, was not designated MHPASHA but might appropriately

[have been so designated.

3.. Also forwarded herewith is a clipping from the JCP's
AKAHATA, Sunday edition, 21 January: (identical article also appeared
in SRABATA daily,.13 January). This article announced that
GENSUIKYO printed up 10,000 leaflets, copies of an advertisement
placed in the Chicago Daily News, May 1967. A sample of this

advertisement Was sent to GENSUIKYO by Fred@”Bachiyuruta (phonetic) ,
