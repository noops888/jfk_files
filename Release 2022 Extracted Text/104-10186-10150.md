‘source, A former Cuban IS officer who served with the Cuban Intelligence
Service until April 1964.

1, The Direccion General de Inteligencia (General Directorate of
Intelligence - DGI) overseas field-station chief has no respon-
sibility for physical or other security of the Cuban Embassy or
Mission, nor does any member of his staff.

2. The DGI would not use ¢ regular foreign-service officer in the
field because he has not been cleared and briefed and is not,
therefore, considered qualified for intelligence tasks. If a
foreign-service officer is bricfed, it may be assumed that he
has been cleared and that he is thereafter considered a member
of the DGI (at least by the DGI). On returning to Havana per-
manently, Such a foreign-service officer bricfed for a field
assignment normally would be sent to DGI Headquarters rather
than to the Ministry of Foreign Relations,
