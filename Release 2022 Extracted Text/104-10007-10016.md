2022 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992

5 October 1964

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Army Request for Information on Statements in

Warren Commission Report re Joseph DUTKANICZ

and Vladimir SLOBODA

1. On 1 October 1964, Jane Roman of CI/Liaison telephoned

Lee Wigren to say that the Army had reacted to certain state-

nents (on page 266 of the Warren Commission Report about the

assignment, KGB involvement and Army security investigation

The statements were contained in a classified memorandum of

6 April 1964 from CIA to the Commission. Through an error

by the Commission staff, this memorandum was quoted in the

report instead of a sanitized version which had been provided

for the purpose.

CI/Liaison requested the factual background

of the statements as set forth

in our classified memorandum.

Additional

details on the Army's inquiry are set forth in

Jane Roman's memorandum for the record of 2 October (Attach-

ment A) â€¢

Late_ in the afternoon of 1 October, Jane Roman explained

in detail to Jane Curtis] of SR/CI/R what was needed. Since

SR/CI/R keeps only a skeleton file on defector cases, some time

was required to find the exact sources and procure copies of

reference documents. This was done on 1 and 2 October.

Jane Roman informed Jane Curtis at mid-morning on

2 October that the Army wanted a written reply and that Chief/

CI/R&A would prepare one if we provided the facts. Accordingly,

Jane Curtis prepared a memorandum (Attachment B) and hand-

carried it to Jane Roman at 1200 hours.

4. Note: It was not possible to attach copies of all

documents cited in our memorandum because in one case a document

is in 00 files and in other cases there are only thermofax

copies available in the 201. This was explained orally to

Jane Roman.
