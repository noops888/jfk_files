HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE

ON ASSASSINATIONS

INTERVIEW OF

SPECIAL AGENT DAVID N. JELLISON

On March 29, 1978, I, David N. Jellison, Special

Agent with the Miami OIlice of the federal Bureau o1

Investigation, was interviewed by Richard C. Wrose,

Mark speiser, and Wendy Collins, investigators, and

Peter G. Beeson, Stail Counsel, for the United States House

• of Representatives Select Committee on Assassinations.

This interview took place at the House of Representatives

Select Committee Office Building, Washington, D.C.

At the outset, I identified myself as a Special

Agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and obtained

names and titles of the interviewing officials. I also

furnished my date of birth, Social Security Number, and general

background information relating to my FBI career to date.

specifically furnished the date I commenced my assignment in

the Miami Division as June 1966. Upon arriving in Miami, I was

assigned to the investigation of civil rights and extremist

matters as they existed in the Miami Division at that time.

In this regard, I was assigned to handling the Martin Luther King

murder investigation as leads developed in the Miami Division

in 1968.

I was asked to comment on any contact I had with

William Sommersett, an extremist source in the Miami Division

at the time I was assigned to investigate extremist matters.

To my recollection, regular contact with Somersett had been

discontinued prior to my arrival in Miami due to his unstable

behavior and to avoid possible embarrassment to the Bureau.

I am of the opinion that for some years prior to 1966,

Sommersett had furnished reliable information to the Bureau

relating to both extremist and criminal matters. Any direct

contact I had with Sommersett was initiated by Sommersett,

and any information developed as

a result was accepted at

face value and either verified or discredited, as the case

may have been.

Sommersett. was not paid

for any information he furnished to the FBI during my tenure

handling extremist matters.

Whatever contact the Miami Police Department had

with Sommersett is unknown to me with the exception of a

bombing matter which fell under the jurisdiction of the Miami

Police Department and of which Sommersett apparently had

direct knowledge.

I was shown a memorandum by the House of

Representatives interviewing officials which was allegedly

written by an Officer Sap of the Miami Police Department on

April 25, 1968, to Chief of Police Headley, wherein Officer

Sap

stated he had developed information from Sommersett on

April 3, 1908 indicating that Martin Luther King would be

Killed in Memphis, lennessee. I never met Officer Sap and

never saw this nemorandum.

I do not recall Sommersett or

any Miami Police Department official relating any of the

information contained in this memorandum to me.

Prior to the conclusion of this interview, I was

asked about several names which were unknown to me and was

interrogated about any knowledge I might have regarding an

FBI "Cointell" (phonetic) Program as it pertained to the Miami

Division. I have no knowledge of this program in the Miami

Division or anywhere else in the Bureau.

At the conclusion of the interview, I was advised

that I would be notified of any further inquiries in this

matter wherein my presence or testimony would be necessary.

DETAILS: On 3-23-78, Mr. Robert Keuch, Deputy Assistant Attorney

General, Criminal Division, Special Counsel to the Attorney General for

matters relating to captioned Committee, advised that the staff of the

HSCA had asked,, because of numerous excisions in material received from

the FBI concerning the Martin Iut afforded Mr. Blakey; Congressmen Louis

Stokes, Chairman of the HSCA; and Samuel L. Devine, Ranking Minority,

it was subsequently decided co beter only t. Blakey, who indifaded

that such might preclude necessity of briefing the two Congressmen.

On 4-12-78, at 11:30 a.m., this briefing was held in the

Director's Office.

Attending were:

Re:

Following the briefing, Mr. Blakey proposed several questions

concerning the operation and King. These questions were appropriately

answered. (U)

Mr. Blakey expressed satisfaction with the briefing and with

the Bureau's reasons for excising documents furnished the HSCA. He

stated the early association of King and Levison is crucial to the

HSCA's investigation. He acknowledged that the FBI had a basis to

investigate King and to install telephone surveillance of him. However,

he believed the investigation of King continued for too long a period

and information developed by the FBI concerning King was disseminated

too widely. (U)

Mr. Blakey desired that Congressmen Stokes and Devine be

furnished the same briefing at a future date. (U)

The Bureau also advised Atlanta in referenced

Bureau telephone call, that the HSCA wanted Atlanta to

first furnish those documents in KING's Atlanta security

file that covered the period 1/1/68 through 4/30/68, and

when these were xeroxed, they were to be sent to FBIHQ right

When this phase was completed, then the remaining

documents in KING's Atlanta file were to be xeroxed and sent

to FBIHQ.

The Atlanta file on MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.,

consisted of 81 volumes and the documents in this file

covering the period 1/1/68 through 4/30/68 were in volumes

14 through 80. Since the KING file only contained 81 volumes,

Itlanta submitted volumes 74 through 81 with referenced Atlant

letter to FBIHQ, 4/11/78.

As the Bureau will note in the above list, in a

number of volumes of the KING file, there are many serials

listed that cannot be accounted for. For the information

of the Bureau, back in 1977, Atlanta had a massive project

of retrieving communications containing electronic surveillance

(elsur) information

regarding MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR., and

the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) per a

court order in the case captioned,

"BERNARD S. LEE V.

CLARENCE M. KELLEY: ET AL (U.S.D.C., D.C.) CIVIL ACTION

NO. 76-1185 AND SOUTHERN CHRISTIAN LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE

(SCLC) V. CLARENCE M. KELLEY; ET AL (U.S. D.C., D.C.) ,

CIVIL ACTION NO: 76-1186". In this project, Atlanta

had to

review hundreds of volumes of Atlanta files and retrieve

thousands of communications containing this elsur information

so these communications could be sent to FBIHQ, for eventual

transfer to the National Archives per the court order.

Atlanta in carrying out this project, had to use a large

number of Atlanta personnel, many being unfamiliar with

security type work and communications.

These people had been instructed to list each serial

removed from the file on a form that Atlanta devised for each

volume reviewed in project, however, it was felt that in many

instances where a cover airtel and LHM were removed from the

files, both these items would be stapled together, resulting

in only the cover airtel serial number being listed on the

form; the LHM serial number would not be noted by the person

removing this

communication and as a result it was not recorded.
