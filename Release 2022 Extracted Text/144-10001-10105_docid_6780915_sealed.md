Restricted.

The Mexican Government through its Embassy in Havana

has returned the note delivered to that' Embassy by the Cuban

Government protesting the detention in this capital of a Mexican

woman employed at the Cuban Embassy in the course of the

investigations surrounding the assassination of KENNEDY.

The above-mentioned note, the text of which was revealed

in Havana, was written in extremely violent terms. '

The

Mexican Government does not contest the fact that the:

employee was detained and a house search made on the day

following the Dallas crime, when it was learned that the

assassin had been here and

had visited the Cuban Embassy as

well as that of the Soviet Union. Both of those

diplomatic missions reported that the visit involved à request

for visas for the two countries. It also appears certain that

the search in the home: of the employee of the Cuban Embassy

was carried out with,a certain brutality, which, moreover,

is usual in such cases here:

The aspect [4G/M] Cuban. Government

seems to want to exploit here is that the search was made by

order of the official candidate for the Mexican presidency,

at the time still the Minister of the Interior, who, as I

reported in my."

(A)) is opposed by the leftists.
