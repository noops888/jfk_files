MEXICAN AUTHORITIES “eqnpuct ae SEARCH AFTER KENNEDY
ASSASSINATION . .

Msg Nr: 311

Restricted,

The Mexican Government through its \Enbassy in Havana
has returned the note delivered to that’ Ebassy by the Cuban
Government protesting the detention int ‘this capital of a Mexican
woman employed at the Cuban Embassy | dn: “the course of the
investigations surrounding the assagsination of KENNEDY.
The above-mentioned note, the tex’ of which was revealed
in Havana, was written in extremely | wielent terms, The
Mexican Government does not contest the fact that the!
employee was detained and a hguse search made on the day
following the Dallas crime, When dt was learned that the
assassin had been here and Had visited the Cuban Embassy as
well as that of the Sovies* Union, Both of those
diplomatic missions reported that the visit involved 4 request
for visas for the two countries, It also appears certain that
the search in the home’ of the’ employee of the Cuban. Embassy
was carried out with. certain brutality, which, moreever,
is usual in such cages here; The ‘aspect [4G/M] Cuban: Government
seems to want to exploit hgre is that the search was thade by
order of the official candidate for the Mexican presidency,
at the time stizl the Mini ster of the Interior, who, as I
reported in my, [(A)) is opposed by the leftists.
