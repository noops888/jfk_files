SUBJECT + Retirement Planning

1. In order to assist employees in planning for their even-

= tual retirement, it is the practice of the Agency to notify each

s : employee well in advance of the date he is scheduled for retire-
> H ment. I am, therefore, taking this asta to advise~ you~

i that you are scheduled to retire on § Octoher 1979.

i 2. ‘The prospect of retirement from the Agency deserves
serious thought and careful planning so that you may make the

i . transition to the next phase of life with purpose and confidence.
~To assist you in this regard, the Agency offers various resources

hich are attuned to the needs of prospective retirees. You

‘will, in the near future, be invited by the Retirement Counselor
for your Directorate to an individual pre-retirement counseling
session, or more than one if you wish. This phase of retirement
planning will be tailored solely to your own particular situation
and circumstances and will be within the context of the retirement
system under which-you will retire.. The individual counseling
sessions are intended to give you a wide range of information on
such matters as estimates of your annuity, survivor benefits,
life and health insurance, Social Security, taxes, relocation
and movement of houschold effects and assistance in obtaining
other employment. In addition, you will be invited to attend a
Retirement Information Seminar that wili be, offered in the

autunn of 1974,

: 3. Some persons who wish to retire voluntarily prior to the
: scheduled date and who wish to commence their planning as early
as possible, prefer to work with their Retirement Counselor well
before the time he would normally contact them. If you believe
you would benetit from such an earlier start on your personal
i planning, you are entitled to contact the Retirement Counselor
responsible for your Directorate at the Retirement Affairs Division,
212 Magazine Building, on telephene extension 3328.

[couwente OF Ravigwine OFFICIAL
I concur in Mr. Watts' evaluation, Mr. Moore is a very

good administrator and his office has performed its collection
mission very well and provided excellent operational services and
support. They have not been tested in our emigre program because
of a lack of potential but I am confident they will do the job
well as required. I rate Mr. Moore superior in his ability to.
represent CIA and the Intelligence Community on the outside and
he does a very good job in representing PED within CIA and the
Community. In a pinch I fecl that I could depend on Mr. Moore
more than almost any other DCD field chief of his grade.

e es ident Office in ‘Tulsa -and a Residency in Austin. The
louston Resident Office. wis: raised to Field Office status ,
on 1 September 1976, and the New Orleans Resident Office
was placed under. the newly formed Houston Field Office:
Both of these offices were formerly subordinate to the
Dallas Field Office,

Moore's. able direction, thé Dallas |~
ontinued, to perform the full range of.

p 1¥ prepared reports on subjects of
‘priority intelligence interest. Mr. Moore is a quiet”
and efficient manager with high personal and professional
standards. He is well liked and: respected.

a
03

3: During this rating period, Mr. Moore and the
“Dallas Field Office were formally commended by the Office
of Strategic Research for timely reporting of information
which resulted in substantial improvement of an estimate
on Soviet military medical staffing. The information
supplied by Mr. Moore"..-resulted in a reduction of over

0,000 in the Community's estimate of the total number

of Sovict military personnel.”

4. Extraordinarily fine work has been done under
Mr. Moore's direction during this rating period supporting
‘the activitics of the FR Base. The FR Base is relatively
new and has depended heavily on Mr. Moore's readiness to
support it in the carly stages of development. In
November 1976, Mr. Moore was formally commended by the
FR Base Chief "...for his outstanding support to the new
Dallas Base during the period October 1975 to October 1976.
++-The level of overall support from DCD Dallas was consis-
tently outstanding.” Under Mr. Moore's management, the
Dallas Office support of FR objectives is!among the most
effective and comprehensive in DCD. t

MEMORANDUM IN LIEU OF FITNESS REPORT
J. Walton Moore, 10 February 1977

Mr. Moore is a strong supporter of the Emigre
Task Force Program,:and the Dallas Office is- responsive.
to cases and requests assigned by this project. The H
potential in the Dallas arcu is not as great as in other
major cities of equivalent size, but the office ‘has
performed very well against those targets available.

6. Mr. Moore is an experienced and effective
officer; the Dallas Field Office under his careful and
tactful management is a productive and smooth functioning

ESUMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL
Mr. Moore's long and unique experience in the FBI, OSS, and CIA coupled with

his background in China and his admirable personal qualities make him a very valuable
asset to OCD. When he recormends something to me, I know he will be correct; when
he is asked to represent the Agency in some highly important contact, I know he
will do it well and rake an excellent, professional impression, and I can count

on him to run a very good office with a high level of productive activity.

I feel very comfortable and very confident with Jim Moore in Dallas.

who performs well and has growth potential but who is difficult to work with and has,
on occasions, apparently been on the brink of a physical breakdown brought on by
tension, overwork and. other factors. In his approach to this problem, Jim has been

concertied, compassionate, responsible, and thoroughly professional.
Under Jim's direction, the Dallas complex has achieved a high ranking among DCD

MEMORANDUM ‘IN LLEY OF FITNESS REPORT.

SUBJECT: MOORE, J.” Walton

1, Jim Moore continued in his,assignaent as Chief of the
DCD Field Office in Dallas during the period under review, with
responsibility for the supervision of Resident Offices in Houston,
New Orleans and Tulsa, and a new Regidency in Austin, His Letter
of Instruction dated ? November 1973 remains current.

2. The Dallas Ficld Office with tts Tour satellite offices

represents the most complicated field office structure in DCD.

. While Mr. Moore's staff consists of only nine officers and seven
secretaries, more than half dre located outside the field office.

.. The Dallas Office requires a chief who 1s experienced in resident
office operations, is able to sorivate ‘and’ ésnage’ people from a
distance, and who can keep personally familiar with a wide variety
of activities. Mr. Moore is admirably qualified. He has been able
to, coordinate these essentially independent activities most
efficiently. His entire organization perforns in a responsive
and highly effective manner and produces timely, well balanced

report ing.

3, Although Mr. Moore's staff was relatively stable during
1974, two of his key officers were incapacitated for extended periods,
both at times when the work load was especially heavy. The operating
procedures which he has established enabled the offtce involved to
continue to handle priority matters effectively in each instance,

4. On at least two occasions in 1974 Nr. Moore had to intercede
in complicated and difficult situations, and in each instance his
Judgment and highly professional approach resulted in successful
solutions.

that comes’ only :from experience and past success, 1 believe that
tt fs largely due to Mr. Moore's personal reputaticn that so many
of our junior officers want to work in Dallas. :

6. During 1976" Mr. Moore recommended the establishment of a

‘one-man residency ‘in Austin as a more efficient way to handle our

responsibilities in that part of Texas: We agreed, and the Residency
was established in mid-1974. Although it has bech in operation only
a few months, the wisdom of Mr. Moore's recommendation 1s already

Mr. James Walton Moore is hereby nominated for a
Careez Intelligence ‘Medal in recognition of his substantial
contributions to the missions of the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, the Office of Strategic Services, the
Strategic Services Unit and the Central Intelligence Agency
for more than 37 years.

J. Walton (Jim) Moore spent most of his boyhood (1920-27,
in Shantung Province, China with his missionary
pareats. Following graduation from Hardin-Simmons University
in 1920, Jim joined the FBI and served as a Special Agent in
both Chicago and San Francisco, During the latter assign-
ment he reported on pro-Communist clenents in Chinatown and
directed a US Government pancl to interview aliéns and US
citizens returning home to cnsure that enemy agents were not
Slipping into the US as refugees or forcign businessmen.

Jin joined OSS in November 1944 and was commissioned
as an Ensign, USNR. His first assignment was in Kunming
where he recruited and trained Chinese agents to infiltrate

chute training

and of August 17, 1945 jumped into the Japanese internment
camp at Neihsein. Following evacuation of refugees he
‘became Chief of Nission in Tsingtao. Returning to the US
in December 1946, he was reassigned as Vice Consul and
Chief of Station in Dairen. Sovict intransigence prevented
his reaching Dairen so he remained in Tsingtao Yor an
additional year until transferred as Chief of Station in
Calcutta, arriving there in April, 1948.

Jin returned to the United States in October 1949 and
joined the Contact Division, Office of Operations, CIA.
cb/00 policy favored continuity and Jim was no exception.
Fron 1839 to 1954 he served in the Houston Field Office and
from 1934-1977 as the Resident Officer in Dallas. The
Contact Division evolved into the Domestic Contact Service
and a reallocution of resources raised the Dallas Resident
Office to Field Office status, Jim was the obvious choice
for the job. After nine wonths training and preparation in
Wash ton (where he performed admirably) he was a signed
as Chief of the new office with responsibility als for
Resident Offices in Tulsa, Houston, New Orleans and, even-

tually, Austin.

“E2 IMPDET CL BY 010650

COMFIGENTIAL



“Section € (cont inued)

Jim's work. in Dallas“has been: consistently excellent.
Under his: leadership the Dallas complex has provided timely
foreign intelligence in response to worldwide priorities
‘and requirements: As an-example, in April 1975 the Acting
Director, Stratetic ReSearch commended Jim for “outstanding
performance”. for urgent special efforts to obtain information
which resulted in a reduction of over 500,000 in the
Intelligence Community's estimate of the total number of

Soviet military personnel.

_ Similarly, the Dallas Office has provided excellent
support to the Clandestine Service. In November, 1976 the

Chief, FR Division commended Jim and his staff for "outstanding

suppor from October 1975-October 1976 in efforts which
were "indispensable" to the establishment of FR assets in
Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana and in identifying and
assesSing prospective targets for recruitment.

There are very~ few persons-of- potential, consequence. to.
the Intelligence Community in Texas who Jin Moore does not

Know and little that he cannot accomplish there on behalf

of Community and Agency requesters.

The assassination of President Kennedy in Dallas in
November 1963, the subsequent allegations against CIA’ and
Jim Moore's iong association with Agency interests and
programs in Texas have made him a repeated target for media
attention and scurrilous innuendo. Although under various
forms of severe. external pressure as a result, Jim Moore
never lost his ¢aln, cool demeanor and has been absclutely

dependable in adversity.

An experienced professional, a true gentleman, a delight -
ful person, and an example to be emulated, Jim Moore has
been a real credit to the intelligence profession. AS he
approaches retirement, he richly deserves recognition in the
form of the cer Intelligence Nedal.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Domestic Collection Division,
DDO

SUBJECT : Appreciation for Outstanding DCD
Performance

1, I want to express the appreciation of the
Office of Strategic Research for the special effort
recently made for us by J. Walton Moore of your Dallas
{field office. Mr. Moore responded quickly to- our
urgent request to obtain information on Soviet military

from DS-2172 and provided it to us on

very short notice.

~ 2. Let me give you some background. The subject

of Soviet emerged as an important
issue in a recent community-wide effort to reassess

total Soviet military manpower. The community reassess-
ment was stimulated by DIA reporting of several months
ago that existing estimates of total Soviet military
manpower were low by almost one million men. If correct,
the DIA appraisal had potentially serious implications
for the ongoing MBFR negotiations as well as a host of
intelligence judgments about the dimensions of the ~
Soviet military threat. -

3. During the ensuing interagency review of the
individual éstimates contributed by various agencies
in*the Washington area came to the conclusion that
the number of Soviet estimated by an
Army intelligence group was much too high. A rapid
search of headquarters’ files turned up barely enough -
intelligence to prepare an estimate of a portion or the

but no direct evidence on total

At this point it became clear to us
that an improved estimate might be made with information
from DS-2172. As we had to present our case to the
manpower study Stecring Group carly in the week of
March 24, speed in contacting the Soviet source was

essential.

CULE



eit aLliint

4, The data subzitted by the Dallas field office
as a result of a specially arranged debriefing pro-
vided.us with the’ basis for a much improved estimate
of Soviet military Furthermore, Mr.

~izMoore's questions ‘elicited. some néw information of value
“sto future work.. Most important, the results of DCD's
efforts con buted: significantly to convincing’ the
o working group that the original Army cstimate was far
too high.. Eventually the estimate we submitted based
upon the information supplied by DS-2172 was accepted
by the manpower Steering Group and resulted in a
reduction of over 500,000 men in the intelligence
community's estimate of the total number of Sovict
military personnel. : .

5. The efforts of your people struck a mighty
blow for good intelligence. Many thanks.

Tos Chief, SFB. PPD” :
Subjecti Hr. J. Welton Moore, Agent, Contact Cffice, Dallas, texas

I should like to call attention to the outstanding
cooperation given our activities in Dallas by J. dalton hoore,
resident representative in Dallas, Texas.

Mr. Mcore has not only extended the normal hospitality of
his ofrices, but has.gohe out cf his way to nowinate and talk ~
with exceptional pecple whe cowe to his attention es potential
euployes for the Agency. Xr. Nocre has contacted we from time
to tiae with names and cozzents on individuals, and in every way
attezpted to serve as an active sersonnel scout in his area. I
foul his efforts and tine consuzed in interviewing people have
gore a good deal beyond the norgal expectations of cur agency,
and that thie attitude best represents the unified type of
teamwork which our érganization subscribes to in this work.

hile my experiences with the resident offices in ay area
have been uniformly a pleasant: experience, it is a matter of
real satisfaction to find a man who is thinking in terms of the
Agency aa a whole and not of one sharply defined activity. I
believe the spirit thot br. Moore shows should be brought to the
attention of his superiors as a prize example of teamwork in the
field. It 1s not only a rersonal satisfaction to do business
with Hr. Moore, but it greatly contributes to the morale of our,
efforts by knowing that other of:ices are as concerned as ve

are in producing results.

Sincerely,
