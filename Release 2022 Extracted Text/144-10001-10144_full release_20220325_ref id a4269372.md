November 1978
MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: 8 November Meeting with Mr. Blakey

1. On 8 November, Ed Sapp visited Mr. Robert G. Blakey,
Chief Counsel and Staff Director for the House Select Committee
on Assassinations, to receive questions concerning a former
Air Force enlisted man's allegation that he had intercepted
information linking an assassination plot against President Kennedy
with a figure in organized crime. Mr. Blakey had been referred to
NSA (GC, Dan Silver) by Ms. Judy Miller, Special Assistant to
John Kester, OSD. -

2. Mr. Blakey indicated that David F.- Christensen had
communicated with a friend of his named Sgt Michael B. Stevensen
at "Corry" Field, Florida. Mr. Christensen has been committed to
a mental institution due, he asserts, to pressures arising from
an incident occurring in 1963.

3. At that time, Christensen was in the Air Force assigned
to Kirknewton, Scotland. Sometime before November, 1963, in his
work as an interceptor of international commercial communications,
he intercepted the communications referred in paragraph 1. Mr. Blakey
Stated that he did not know who the crime figure is. Christensen's
supervisor, Sgt Praeter (actually "Prater") refused to send this
traffic to NSA and this, he alleges, eventually caused him to have
a mental breakdown.

4. Mr. Blakey stated that NSA had already acknowledged the
existence of such a facility during this period, but he didn't
indicate to whom such a statement had been made.

5. Mr. Blakey posed the following questions for NSA:

(a) What is NSA's capability for retrieving communications
from this time and place?

“(b) How quickly can we make this retrieval?
(His Committee completes its work in December. If
NSA can easily provide the answers to a number of
questions, he will do some preliminary. investigation
before formally requesting the information, but if
- we indicate that much time will be required, he will
task us now) .

(c) What additional information does NSA need.from Mr.
Blakey to speed the retrieval process?

(ad) Is the data still available for retrieval?

ae

(e) Was Christensen really employed by the Air Force,
working for Praeter (Prater), and actually doing this kind of work
at that location during that. period?

6. He asked for the responses, or at least, a status of what
can be provided and how soon, by Monday, 13 November.

7. On 7 September, the General Counsel sent a copy of David
Christensen's letter to the FBI (GC/335/78), along with a letter
from AF Security Service (to which Sgt Stevensen had-sent the letter).
In the General Counsel's letter he noted that Security Service was
intercepting international commercial communications at Kirknewton
in 1963 and that links between Lisbon and other parts of the world
were monitored.

8. On 9 November, Ed and I met with Dan Silver and decided
Dan should respond initially to Mr. Blakey's questions by phone.
After coordinating with EXEC/DDO, Ed asked G9 to provide input
for a response.

9. Harold Pa h (5649) of G809 condjsgh « an initial review
of the availability of data from USA-SS covering the first eleven
months of 1963. From a computer file listing maintained by N3, 20 boxes
of data were identified. Cross-checking assures that this is all and
the contents column helped eliminate 17 of the boxes. The remaining
three wil be manually reviewed on 13 November. If they, in fact, do
contain traffic there will be some 2000 sheets per box.

10. I notified Baa d Mr. Blakey with the news,
