7-2, who has furnished reliable information in the past, advised
on March a4, 1958:that the subscriber to Pittsburgh telephone
GRant 1-4453, which numbér has been called in the past from the
LA. ROCCA residence, is Margiotti and Casey, attorneys, 720 Grant
Building, Pittsburgh, Pa. It is to be noted that both men

have represented the subject in the past and that VINCENT CASEY:
is presently handling all legal affairs of the subject.

‘Miss FRANCES PRIAM, 4310 Vista View, West Mifflin, Pa., paramour
of SEBASTIAN: JOHN LA-ROCCA, Pittsburgh top hoodlum, was
interviewed at length by SA ROBERT A. VOEGE on February 19, 1958.

‘. She adyised that she has known LA ROCCA and his brothers for
approximately fourteen years,-having met "Big John", as she calls -
him, when her brother-in-law. extended LA ROCCA oredit for

utomobile: gasoline. This brother-in-law, whom. she. did not
wish to identify further than to say his name is "CHANCE"

. and that he had served time at.the Lewisburg Federal Penitentiary,

operated a filling station on Baum Boulevard in Pittsburgh

at that time. PRIAM, who is approaching thirty years of. age,

said LA. ROCCA “had eyes for her" when she was. sixteen and that

she has always appeared at least five years older than her actual

age. She said he has approached her on more than one occasion :

during the past three years and asked her to be “his girl" but that
she has not. seen her way clear to take him up on this proposal.

She said she has met-his wife,-a very retiring and suppressed

woman, and has always admired LA-ROCCA for his conservative and

gentlemanly manner. His.proposal was made more difficult, she
admitted, by the fact that she has been "going steady" for
approximately nine years with JOE FOREMAN, a Pittsburgh. racketeer
who..does not care for any of the East Liberty “musclemen"; as he

calls. then. a

PRIAM, the- youngest of fifteen children born to a mother who came

to the United States from Hungary when eighteen years of age,

recalled that: approximately seven or eight years ago FOREMAN and,
LA ROCCA had avehement disagreement over a property settlement
h and that MIKEA@ENOVESE and his brother "PHIL", also known as FELIX,
were sent tos AN as a threat to a- “going over" She said
No sabes prevented violence by contacting LA ROCCA directly and

challenging him-to a personal. fight and that he has referred to the
GENOVESE boys. as "musclemen" since that time.

PRIAM adviséda that she is an accomplished Waitress who has

worked at “all the best places in Pittsburgh and is a member of the
local union. For the past three years and up until two weeks
prior to this interview she was the main waitress, in: the Genovese
Gocktail Lounge at 412 Larimer Avenue. She also worked at the
Holiday House in Monroeville for a time during 1957 and is well
acquainted with’ the Italian element operating that establishment.
She intimated that she ace "dates" on a selective basis. .and
prefers racketeers who are willing to spend a great deal of money
on her. She placed "Young John" LA ROGCA in this category and
stated that she preferred to date him more than anyone else except
FOREMAN, "Young John" was described by PRIAM as being "Big John's
younger brother who controls the. rackets in Uniontown, Pennsylvania
with an-tron hand. She said "Young John" telephones her long
: regularly-and that she is his date whenever he arrives
in Pid sburgh for a meeting with other racketeers. She said he
is divorced, has childrén.and is a “very eligible catch." ‘She said
LA ROSCA 's other two brothers, JOE and TONY are barbers in the °. -
Pittsburgh vicinity having absolute no tie-in with the rackets,
t : ,

“tiew because of the fact.
rlal in Allegheny County

PRIAM seemed disconcerted during the i:
that-her boyfriend JOE FOREMAN was on
Cours for burglary, receiving stolen goods, illegal possession

of acfirearm.” She advised thi he is a used ~ salesman on Baum
Boulevard, is married and has four grown children. FOREMAN

telephoned her during ‘the | Are erview and expressed the wish that he had
money’ ‘to: “buy off someone" because he felt that he was being
“railroaded" on the burglary charge. : ‘

. PRIAM advised that she quit at the Genovese Lounge because she had

to wash dishes and-because the GENOVESE brothers seemed to be
getting "tight" financially. ‘She said there has been very little
business at the lounge "since that Apalachin thing" and _that.she
was unable to clear even four dollars a night in tips. She 1
estimates that a waitress with obligations must clear atleast
seven dollars a day in this regard in order for 16, to. be profitable
to work at all.

She recalled receiving a telephone call approximately three ‘to four
weeks prior to this interview from Mrs, CARMELLA GENOVESE in
Galifornia who wanted to speak person-to-person to MIKE GENOVESE,

_ =18-,

¢

from whom she .is divorced. It.should be noted that at about this
same time CARMELLA GENOVESE was interviewed by Bureau Agents in
California and she was uncooperative’ in furnishing information ‘
about her former husband.

PRIAM recalled that. at Christmas time, 1957, the entire GENOVESE
family; including the mother and father of the GENOVESE brothers,
gathered in the dining room of the lounge and that she received ~
a large tip for serving them. I% had previously been reported that.
old Mrs. GENOVESE had died.

his brothers and LA ROCCA want to keep him "clean." Informant
advised that’ ARCHIE NELSON; another of Pittsburgh's top hoodlums,
does not attend the meetings either, nor do "BOOTS" BELLINI,

‘a numbers baron, and CHUCK TEEMER, another Pittsburgh top

hoodlum. All of the aforementioned individuals have been fe
observed by the informant at the lounge at one’ time or another.
Informant advised that arrangements had been made for a close girl-
friend of the informant to purchase a car through HYMIE MARTIN,
approximately two weeks prior to. this interview, but that the
informant had seen none of the other racketeers recently with

the exception of PHIL and FIORE GENOVESE, "JO JO" PECORA and

LOUIS VOLPE, who. frequents the Holiday House almost nightly.

The informant: had' no knowledge of the numbers or "sports book"
arrangements of the GENOVESES but had recently received a
telephone call for PHIL GENOVESE from a Jewish racketeer working
along Fifth Avenue to whom PHIL ostensibly owes money. Informant
could not ‘recall this individual's name but promised to endeavor
to locate.it.among some check stubs on which a notation’ was made.
Informant recalled that. during September or October, 1957, two or
three racket. men from New York City visited the Genovese’

Cocktail Lounge and were closeted with the GENOVESE brothers

and LA ROCCA for a period of time. . Following the meeting, one

of ‘these men, who introduced himself as JIMMIE” (last name ~
unknown), spoke with the informant.for sometime. Informant
described JIMMIE as an immaculately dressed Italian man in his
fifties and thinks his name can be determined through PHIL
GENOVESE, who has confided in the informant during the ‘recent
opast.

“Informant advised that PHIL. or FELIX GENOVESE, as he is sometimes
‘called, ts definitely not. "top dog" in the GENOVESE family
although he is close to the MANNARINO brothers. \In the opinion ~

, of the informant, his overindulgence in extra-marital relations,

his’ preference for drinking grea’ quantities of scotch, and his
violent temper’ and strong arm tactics will prevent .PHIL GENOVESE
from éver obtaining "big" status in the group. Informant’ advised
that a girl named EVELYN, whose nickname is "PEPPER", and who

“is‘employéd on a part-time basis. as a waitress at the Merry-Go-Round.

Restaurant in Pittsburgh is known to everyone as "PHIL's. girl"
and no one else dares to touch her... Informant advised that. PHIL

,GENOVESE dates EVELYN two or three timés a week openly and helps

support ‘her. According to the informant, the 1957 Ford now. being
driven by PHIL ‘GENOVESE was given to him as.a Christmas gift
by KELLY MANNARINO, Pittsburgh top hoodlum, in December, 1956. |

.

The informant advised that the girlfriend of "BIG. JOHN" LA: ROCCA
whose name is not recalled, died approximately ten years ago
from an illness which LA ROCCA tried.to cure by securing the
best medical aid money could obtain. Informant. advised that
MIKE GENOVESE is a quiet individual who does not date openly
but forces his common-law wife. ALICE to remain home alone
constantly in a house "in the middle of nowhere." Informant:
advised that none of the wives of the racket men accompany
them at. their hangouts and seem to be reconciled to remaining
in the background while their husbands date and. support other
women. openly.

GEORGE "MOON" MESSER, a. well-known and self-admitted Pittsburgh
numbers writer. who is now sixty-three years of age, was. inter-
viewed at his residence, 124 Elysian Street, Pittsburgh

(Emerson 1~6684 or Emerson 1-5332) by SA VOEGE on February. 27,
1958. He advised that he began his numbers activity during

"the olduclearing: house days of 1928" and is still active in
this regard. He said that most of Pittsburgh's present day

big racket men once depended on him solely for protection
purposes since he knew local and state police. figures and
recalled that JOHN LA ROCCA was. one of these racketeers. MESSER
stated. that LA ROCCA became acquainted with him-in about 1941
or 1942.when LA ROCCA was handling all the numbers activity in
the. East Liberty. section of Pittsburgh and had set himself up

as A "little God." . When LA ROCCA became, dissatisfied with his
financial gains he left Pittsburgh on a trip to Chicago to.see
friends about paste reel machines with which he felt he could
make more money. MESSER said a paste reel was similar to a
"one-armed bandit" with the exception that.a small paper-wrapped
mint was dispensed after the coin was placed in. the slot and the
play was registered. Its Chicago manufacturers got around the
“strictly for gambling purposes" phraseology in the law in. that
manner, he explained.

Waile. DA ROCCA was in Chicago MESSER moved into East Liberty
and took over the entire numbers operation. He turned in to
GEORGE CHRISTY (now deceased) in Pittsburgh. When.LA ROCCA
returned he became angry at the MESSER move and had a car run
over MESSER one night when he was.crossing a street. When
MESSER got out of the hospital he found his automobile had
numerous bullet holes in it. Because he thought he'd make money
MESSER stayed in .East Liberty and actually forced LA. ROCCA out
of the, numbers business. MESSER recalled that SAM LEVINE, a

-29-

NW 68262 Docld:32333121 Page 7



PG. 924226

Pittsburgh top hoodlum, turned in to him during the early numbers
days but said that he has not seen LEVINE in years, although he
is familiar with his McKees Rocks book. He said he was. friendly.
with LEVINE's brother RALPH, a promising dentist who is a United
States Army officer at present.

MESSER advised that he and LA ROCCA became friendly following
their feud and that in approximately 1943 LA ROCCA invited him
to sharé equally in the ownership of the Coin Machine. Distributing
Company which later set up offices at 46° Baum Bovlevarda ‘in
Pittsburgh. He recalled that LA ROCCA was completely bankrupt
because af numbers setbacks but managed to raise enough money
to pus up his share He personally visited Chicago. to arrange
for the purchase of the mach s and made a verbal agreement with

He “said the other
LA ROCCA NOES
MC GINLEY, SAM MANNARIN
from Chicago.

MESSER advised that the comps was doing well financially before
Allegheny County authorities raided establishments where the
machines had been placed and forced it out of business. He
recalled that. although each of the six owned an equal share in

the company MANNARINO and LA ROCCA seemed to run everything and
held meetings at. which important subjects were discussed in Italian.
AMATO and several other Italians attended these meetings but MESSER
aid not understand Italian. He advised that he realized that

LA. ROCCA was only using him for his proven protection methods and
did not mind-as long as.he got his cut out of the profits. He

said his chief protection was the then Superintendent.of Police
SCOTT,

MESSER recalled that during 1946 or 1947 MIKE GENOVESE came on
the scene. MIKE had been a pickup man for LA ROCCA and.was a
tough kid whe, according to MESSER, "was almost begging to go to
jail. :

PG 92-226

MESSER, who admittedly ran "moon and numbers joints" in the
early thirties and was well acquainted with "Big Mike" SPINELLI,
who killed ARTHUR, JIMMY and JOHNNY VOLPE, advised that there
is absolutely no numbers organization in the metropolitan
Pittsburgh area. He said that there are numerous independent
books which are well distributed and that there are no con~
cessions or defined areas. MESSER stated that anyone with
money can operate as he pleases and that the police. prefer

it. this way because they can collect protection money easier.

He said the police will not allow any organization now.

MESSER advised that at one time he saw "Monkeyface Joe" ROSA,

FRANK .VALENTI and. TONY RIPEPI, all top hoodlums, daily, but

that he has gotten away from the Italian element now with

the exception of the GENOVESES and NELSON. He recalled that
VALENTI and RIPEPI visited. the offices of the Coin Machine
Distributing Company regularly. and always took orders. from
MANNARINO. and LA ROCGA, He said RIPEPI was a more important
racket man than VALENTI and that LA ROCCA seemed to be tthe key
man. in the Pittsburgh area. MESSER would place LA ROCCA and
MANNARINO as the two men who control the rackets in Western
Pennsylvania and he sees MIKE GENOVESE as the Tae successor
to the. top position.

MESSER, who drives a 1955 blue and white Oldsmobile sedan,

1957 Pennsylvania license. E3914, recalled that in about. 1947
labor leader NICK STIRONE visited the company offices to visit:
his ¢lose friends. LA-ROCCA and MANNARINO. He asked SAM.MANNARINO
to get "gorillas" to handle some men who were giving STIRONE ~'
labor trouble.on a highway being built in the Monroeville: section:

,and more specifically to give the dissenters’a "going over"

while upsetting their equipment. The job was done for STIRONE .
by MANNARINO who.became incensed when: he learned his gorillas

had hurt some older Italian men. MESSER said MANNARINO was. under-:;

the impression that the men who had defied STIRONE were young punks
and he let STIRONE know what he thought. of him in’ front,« “OF SSSSERY

T-3 advised that MIKE GENOVESE had left. town during ‘the early
portion of February, ostensibly with his wife, and that: he:
learned from other racketeers that GENOVESE and LA ROCCA ‘went
to Florida and were there during the months of February and
March, 1958... It was his opinion that they might remain there
until after a Pittsburgh Grand Jury to, investigate rackets has.
finished its deliberations. It should be noted that MIKE
GENOVESE. and his wife returned to the Pittsburgh area during
the first week of March, 1958 and that T--7 subsequently
advised that, it was rumored among the Pittsburgh racketeers
that they had been in Cuba as Well as Florida.

On March -24, 1958, JUDD MECHLING, Chief Deputy U.S. Marshal,
Pittsburgh, advised. that when Deputy Marshal RAY ECHEMENT .
tried to serve’a subpoena on the subject at his residence on
‘that date, he. was informed that the subject'was "vacationing
down south and would definitely be home for the Easter season.”
He advised that. ECHEMENT contacted Mrs. JOHN LA ROCCA in this
regard and was treated very cordially, although he was not
allowed to enter the house.

On this same date SA ROBERT A, VOEGE observed the 1957 cream
colored Gadillac belonging to. the subject.parked in his garage
and it still bore 1957 Pennsylvania licefise 11FM1.

The Albany office advised on March 15, 1958 that TROY WILLIAMS,
Manager of the Arlington Hotel at Binghamton, N. Y., had advised
SA. PATRICK A. MUNLEY on February 21, 1958 that all records
pertaining to the subject had been taken by an investigating
committee .but he recalled the fact that the subject. and (FNU)
GENOVESE were. at the hotel on November 14, 1957,. the date of the
Apalachin meeting, and ‘had two bedrooms. and a living room
which would call for-a rate of $22.00. He stated. that the.
rooms were: paid for in cash and were not charged to Canada Dry
Bottling Company of Endicott, N. Y. He related. further that
there was only. one telephone call placed from the rooms occupi
by ‘the. subject and that.call was to, Pittsburgh telephone =:
Forest 4+5296; which’is the home telephone of the subject. He
stated that he had located a duplicate telephone ticket which
Shows the call was made on November 13, 1957 but he advised
that ‘the telephone operator evidently was in error in view of
. _ fact that the subject registered at 8:58 AM on November 14;
