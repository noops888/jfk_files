BUFFALINI had a product, an insulated cream :
pitcher, which he was trying to sell. She said MICHAEL
DRAKE had some connection with this firm, but she does
not exactly know what it was. She said that DRAKE is
a character actor about 50 years of age who is married
to a woman in her early 20s and who is about the same
age as MIKE DRAKE's son, ALLEN DRAKE,

PALEY said that BORODKIN was a "terrible liar"
and would tell things as fact which were absolutely false.
She recalled that he was going for a short time with a
girl named DOROTHY ELLIS and on one occasion ELLIS came
to the office and BORODKIN told her definitely that he had
made arrangements for a screen test for her at some studio
on the following day and ELLIS was quite excited. However,
after she left, BORODKIN admitted that. he had made no such
appointment and did not have the contacts to make such an
appointment.

On August 18, 1965, PALEY said that she heard
that BORODKIN was presently in the San Diego area trying
to sell the automatic shoe shine machine.
