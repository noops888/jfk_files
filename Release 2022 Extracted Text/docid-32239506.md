Status of Document: Postponed in Part

Number of releases of previously postponed information: 8

States or to any individual.

The Honorable Frank Thompson, Jr.
Chairman

Committee on House Administration
House of Representatives
Washington, D.C. 20515

Dear Mr. Chairman:

I have approved a salary increase of $1,980.00 per year

effective April 1, 1978 for Louis Parisi, a staff investigator
for the Select Committee.

As Mr. Parisi's basic salary and benefits are paid by
the New Jersey State Police, his additional salary from the
House is paid in the form of a monthly expense allowance per
prior agreement with your staff and the Clerk of the House.
This was to avoid Mr. Parisi from earning retirement benefits
from both the Federal Government and the State of New Jersey.

Accordingly, Mr. Parisi's monthly expense allowance will
increase from $625.00 to $790.00 effective April 1, 1978.
