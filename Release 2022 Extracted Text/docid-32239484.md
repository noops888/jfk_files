Assassination Records Review Board
Final Determination Notification

AGENCY : HSCA
RECORD NUMBER : 180-10060-10476
RECORD SERIES : STAFF PAYROLL RECORDS
AGENCY FILE NUMBER :

December 8, 1995
Status of Document: Postponed in Part

Number of releases of previously postponed information: 10

Reason for Board Action: The Review Board's decision was premised on several factors
including: (a) the significant historical interest in the document in question; (b) the
absence of evidence that the release of the information would cause harm to the United
States or to any individual.

Number of Postponements: 4

Postponements: All the postponements in this document represent Social Security numbers.

Reason for Board Action: The text is redacted because the public disclosure of the redaction could
reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, and that invasion of
privacy would be so substantial that it outweighs the public interest.

Substitute Language: SSN

Date of Next Review: 2017

MEMORANDUM 12, t00

June 15, 1977

TO: Tom Lambeth H
Acting Staff Director 4 ;
«6K a
FROM: Donovan L. Gay .y) wa H \
Chief ResearcheryY~ | \

RE: Margaret C. Mason - Secretary/Typist |

Please be advised that Ms. Margaret C. Mason
has been interviewed by Mr. Tiny Hutton, Ms. Jackie
Hess, and myself for the position as typist for the
JFK Research Task Force.

I have spoken with Mr. Tom Howarth and have
been advised that the budget does in fact allow for
our Research Unit to have assigned to them from the
two task forces, a typist for each task force at a
salary up to $12,000.

Therefore, based on Ms. Mason‘*s resume, refer-
ences, and background, and our interviewing of her, I
recommend that she join our staff on Monday, June 20,
1977 at the rate of $12,000 per annum. Please note
| that her current salary range is $19,500.

Thank you for your consideration.
