December 8, 1995

Status of Document:

Postponed in Part

Number of releases of previously postponed information: 10

Reason for Board Action: The Review Board's decision was premised on several factors

including: (a) the significant historical interest in the document in question; (b) the

absence of evidence that the release of the information would cause harm to the United

States or to any individual.

Number of Postponements: 4

Postponements: All the postponements in this document represent Social Security numbers.

Reason for Board Action: The text is redacted because the public disclosure of the redaction could

reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, and that invasion of

privacy would be so substantial that it outweighs the public interest.

Substitute Language: SSN

Chief Researcher

RE:

Please be advised that Ms. Margaret C. Mason

has been interviewed by Mr. Tiny Hutton, Ms. Jackie

Hess, and myself for the position as typist for the

I have spoken with Mr. Tom Howarth and have

been advised that the budget does in fact allow for

our Research Unit to have assigned to them from the

two task forces, a typist for each task force at a

salary up to $12,000.

Therefore, based on Ms. Mason's resume, refer-

ences, and background, and our interviewing of her, I

$12,000 per annum. Please note

that her current salary range is $19, 500.

Thank you for your consideration.
