SUMMARY

1. During the reporting period the LIANCHOR leftist
writer press service produced 35 individual articles and
serialized political feature articles which were distributed
to 20 newspapers throughout Latin America and are known to
have been published regularly by at least 12 newspapers.
Despite this acceptable production rate, the project has not
achieved the objectives set for it by the Mexico Station and
in the Project Outline.

2. Prior to submission of a project renewal request in
late June, 1968, the Mexico Station will attempt to convert
the LIANCHOR operation into a more effective and politically

“more leftist operation. Four of,six LIANCHOR press service
writers will be dropped and P/A(LINLUCK will be replaced,
hopefully by Identity-1, a respectedlindependent leftist
Mexican editorialist for the prestige center-left daily
“BXCELSIOR". If by the end of June, 1968, the operational

the late fall of 196%,LINLUCK) spent six weeks in

WOFIRM as partial reimbursement of the costs of pub-
lishing the JMROD book. During the visit to Guatemala,

O\(LINLUCK) was told by ARRIAGA and other Guatemalan
_ government officials that he could expect a consular
appointment by the summer of 1965.

b. Headquarters and the Mexico Station were agreed
that as soon as he eotde organize LIANCHOR and find a
suitable replacement! INLUCK) should be terminated and
leave Mexico. Following the’receipt of the LIANCHOR
project approval in early 1968, the LIANCHOR case officer
told,(LINLUCK) that he was expected to find a replacement
meeting WOFIRM approval and be ready to turn the opera-
tion over to his replacement by the end of March, 1968.

o\(LINLUCK) proposed Identity-4, who had shown the most
interest in the LIANCHOR press service and had been the
firet to submit articles. By accident the case officer mae
was forced to: listen te an hour's conversation between “|
Identity-4 and, (LINLUCK after Identity-4 came to (LINLUCK's
home, interrupted a meeting between the case officer and

ol LINLUCK) and the case officer sat trapped in a separate
room uibeknownst to Identity-4. From the conversation

political rightist, bel teved,(INLUGK) to be an LNHARP

movement and was married to a neurotic woman who had
hired a private detective agency to check on her husband's
activities | (LINLUCK) was instructed to quietly case
Identity-4 out of LIANCHOR, to cease holding group meet-
ings of LIANCHOR writers and to try to prevent further
contact between Identity-4 and other members of LIANCHOR.

¢.0|Identity-5 was selected as the next candidate to
replace (inLuck)as P/A. Identity-5 was technically,
linguistically,” intellectually and professionally well
qualified to head LIANCHOR. During the period of develop-
ment and assessment of Identity-4 by INLUCK),°ltdentity-5
wrote an excellent article on Soviet intelléctual piracy.
However, Identity-5 proved difficult to contact and
control and turned out to be leading a personal life
which would have detracted seriously from his ability
to administer LIANCHOR 0((LINLUCK) was told to keep in
touch with Identity-5, but to look for still another
candidate. 7

there was any possibility that he could be kept on after
30 June 1968 for an indeterminate period as LIANCHOR P/A
until some outside job showed up. The case officer said
he would discusa the matter with feadquarters, but felt
that in the interests of(LINLUCK'# family and his own
career it was high time“that (LINLUCK strike out on his own.
Replacements were again reviewed and'it was decided that ,
the best candidate would be Identity-1, who had turned
down membership {in LIANCHOR because he wanted immediate
fees for anything he wrote. Identity-6 of the LIANCHOR
group, a friend of Identity-1, wac queried as to Identity-1's
personal life and, as far as can ke discovéred, Identity-1
lives a quiet life with his wife aud family and is highly
respected in Mexican intellectual circles both as an author/
editorialist and as an independent leftist. Reference "B"

7. Erma Involvement in Covert Action Operations Targetted
Against Soviet Poet Yevgeny farch-Apr 3

ce)

a. In warch (orm) drafted an open letter to Soviet
poet Yevgenyi YEVTUSHENKO asking the Russian to use his
influence to persuade the Soviet government to-end the
persecution of Soviet intellectuals, artists, writers and

- poets.0| (LINLUCK managed to obtain the signatures of stu-
dents, professors, actors, dancers, writers and intellec-
tuals for his open letter and then persuaded the publisher
of his books to print thousands of copies, which were
distributed by other assets of the Mexico Station. A
copy of the open letter was published in "EXCELSIOR" on
the day of YEVTUSHENKO's arrival in Mexico for what was
originally billed as a personal trip. Because of the
open letter and critical press coverage of YEVTUSHENKO 's
rude behavior towards the press on arriving at Mexico
City airport, the Russian Eubassy called a special press
conference the evening of the day of the poet's arrival.
At the press conference YEVTUSHENKO spoke with outrage
of the open letter, carefully dodging a number of questions
asked by the letter, and chided the signers of the letter
for claiming there was absolute literary freedom in Mexico,
asking how there can be freedom anywhere in the world as
long as there is no freedom in Vietnam. YEVTUSHENKO 's
remarks about the open letter left no doubt that he had
come to Mexico as a Soviet propagandist and not as a rebel
poet,

ol .

b. Gintuc®) a1so produced a handbill quoting the
telegram by Soviet intellectuals to the "Consultative
Conference of Communist Parties" at Budapest, asking for
an end to Soviet persecution of intellectuals in the USSR.
The handbill featured two pen and ink drawings of imprisoned
Soviet poets Sinyavsky and Daniel. He also arranged for
the printing in Spanish of an authoritative study of inci-
dents surrounding the Galanskov-Dobrovolsky trial in

i

c. Vin Identity-4(LINLUCK)passed guidance material
to Mexico's top female poet, Margarita MICHELENA,
‘concerning YEVTUSHENKO. MICHELENA published a series
of professional criticisms of YEVTUSHENKO as a poor™ ,
poet and opportunist in the Mexican press. In April,
immediately following YEVTUSHENK)'s departure, & con-
densation of the MICHELENA critiques of YEVTUSHENKO were
published in the leftist political illustrated magazine
"IMPACTO" by LILISP-E.

d. Identities 3 and 6 of the LIANCHOR group also
published articles against YEVTUSHENKO in the rightist
daily "EL SOL", but the Station felt the articles were
too vitriolic and unobjective to be a credit to LIANCHOR.
In fact, because of these articles the Station plans to
remove both Identities 3 ana 7 from LIANCHOR; for it is
obvious that both persons have long since lost all traces
of their former leftism and are extreme rightists.

. 8. Views on LIANCHOR Effectiveness by Owner/Director of
Guatemala Daily "EL IMPARCIAL™:

oO
a. During intuck'3) Easter visit to Guatemala City

aan he wag told by the owner of “EL IMPARCIAL" that the 2}

newspaper was only interested in publishin GINLUCK's)

articles. The newspaper owner stated thee NLUCK was

@ well-known personality in Guatemala and also wrote |

interestingly. The owner also said that he had pub-

lished one series by Identity-4 because Identity-4 was

a Guatemalan who at one time had been important. However,

the owner pointed out that the other LIANCKOR writers

were unknowns and did not write well, He singled out

Identity-3 as. being a "menace to journalism” because much

of what she wrote amounted to libel or slander.

b. The "EL IMPARCIAL" owner said that he received
the newspapers "EL DIA" of Honduras, "LA PRENSA GRAFICA"
of El Salvador, "LA PRENSA" of Nicaragua, "LA REPUBLICA"
of Costa Rica, "LA ESTRELLA" of Panama and "ULTIMAS
NOTICIAS" of Caracas and had noted that these newspapers.

knowledge, published articles by any of the other LIANCHOR
writers,

~LIANCHOR, the "BL IMPARCIAL" man told ‘LINLUCK) that he ©
could never hope to collect fees for His news service .
until the service became both famous and sought after.
The "EL IMPARCIAL" owner advised INLUCK) to find writers
tter known in Latin America. fe suggested that if .
ol LINLUCE) could not afford to pay his writers fees, he
should’persuade first class writers to contribute to
Bias LIANCHOR purely for the prestige of having their material
published arqund Latin America. ° .

press group. Of nine persons who belonged to the group
as of 15 January, three subsequently dropped out because

of differences of opinion which developed at group meet=
ings. In addition?|@INLUCK) learaed that persons he had
selected partly because of their leftist records (Iden-
tities 3, 4, 7 and 8) had:long since ceased being leftists
and were prone to submit manuscripts with texts politically
harmful to the image of LIANCHOR. Confused political
thinking and poor writing resulted in rejection of over

20 manuscripts during February-April by INLUCK) and the
case officer, Rejection of manuscriptslin turn angered

and insulted some of the writers.

b. The personalities and cbhmracter,of some of the
writers have presented problems to(LINLUCK in directing
and developing the LIANCHOR group into,a productive unit.
Identities 3, 5, 6, 7 and 8 had jo be goaded continually
by (LINLUCK)to turn in manuscripts on assigned themes.
BothgIdent ty-3 and Identity-7 turned out to be emotional
extremists, suffering at times from deep melancholy and
at other times from inexplainable rages which were re-
flected in their writings. As of this writing the Station
feels that the only reliable members of the group are
Identities 6 and 9, who should be kept as members of the
group as long as LIANCHOR is run as a group cooperative
press service. The unreliable but brilliant and versatile
poet/writer/lexicographer Identity~5 should be continued
as a contact of LIANCHOR for occasional emergency use
provided(LINLUCK'S replacement can obtain any cooperation
from Identity-5.°\ In summary the LIANCHOR group composed
of Identities 3, 4, 5, 7 and 8 has proved ineffective and
not too productive and the ineffective members should be

replaced. ol

10. Effectiveness of P/A(LINLUC

°

a. The list of articles and features by GINLUCK)
under Separate Cover Attachment "B" is by no means the
measure of the agent's writing and production capability.
After the agent dusted off and mailed out several of his
old article series in December 1968 the case officer
instructed,(LINLUCK) to reduce his production in ratio to
the manusétipts of other LIANCHOR writers which were
mailed out, The case officer was concerned that LIANCHOR
would appear,to wuven's)} client newspapers to be primarily

a vehicle for(LINLUCK's)lengthy political essays in con-
trast to the statement in the LIANCHOR prospectus that
LIANCHOR was a press service combining articles on cultural,
educational, economic and social as well as political topics
by many writers. During the agent's two final months of
service he has been given authorization to write as much
as be can on the Vietnam issue and other topics for the
purpose of building up his name in Guatemala before he

returns there to enter politics.
)

b. While production of articles was not (urmvcx's|
weak point, his selaction and handling of the LIANCHOR
press service writers appears to have been weak. He has
been too long on the fringes of the foreign exile group
in Mexico and his contacts among leftists in Mexico are
no longer significant, In addition, the agent appears to

Gaga REP,

have gone the way of many former Latin American Communists
in that his theoretical solution to some of the political,
economic and social problems of Latin America can no longer
be termed leftist. ‘

- c.. As a penetration of a Communist Party Crmuck
was a singleton. - Although as 3 former Communist leader
he has had experience in handling people, he has not
had experience in handling sub-agents for WOFIRM. There
was evidence during the reporting period that (LINLUCK) 2 |

probably did as well as he could in controlling his

of co-workers.

ll. Effectiveness of LIANCHOR articleshnd Features: in
the Station's opinion those articles which(LINLUCK) wrote were
forceful and effective, but too long. ‘fhe articles written by

ol INLuck' 5) co-workers apparently were ineffective to the point

‘that they were not considered worth pu»lishing. e Capriles
newspaper chain of Venezuela apparently felt that LINLUCK 500
articles were well worth running, despite the fact that they
had to be published in installments. The leading newspapers
in,each of the Central Américan republics appeared to believe
tht(LINLucK's) articles merited automatic publication. It is
assumed that LINLUCK's)articles were published regularly in

Bolivia du®lto La Paz~Station assistance. However, because no 9°

ts)

newspaper felt like paying fees to LIANCHOR or answering (LINLUCK
correspondence, it has not been possible to ascertain whether
LIANCHOR articles have been published with any regularity in
Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Colombia or Ecuador, It is too much
to ask third country stations to scan the press daily for articl
by seven different people. The Mexi¢ ation] appreciated
the assistance received from the (arkbasl) gabsddeend Guatemala

SECURITY

12,. There have been no incidents of security nature
hazardous to the LIANCHOR project during the reporting period,

FINANCE AND SUPPORT

13, Finance: During 1 October - 30 May the LIANCHOR

ments to(LINLUCK ‘at U.S. $700 per month and U.S. $119 in cost

standing in the Mexican press, pechaps can publish in
Mexico. -

b. If Identity-1. rejects recruitment, the next candi-
date for LIANCHOR chief is Identity-10, who has already
told @€u.uek that he is prepared to take over LIANCHOR
on a pro o\.ionary. basis to see whether it will enhance his
reputatio.. The Station feels that Identity-10 would be
easier to recruit than Identity-1. However, Identity-10
is not too well known in Mexico and is totally unknown
abroad. One of Identity-10's virtues is the-fact that he
never formally quit the Communist Party and has done nothing
to irritate the Party. As economic and general reporter for
“EXCELSIOR” he offers placement potential, If Identity-1
does accept recruitment, the Station still intends to try
to recruit Identity-10 as a singleton under Project LIANCHOR,
possibly steering Identity-10 to Identity-1 and the LIANCHOR
press service after due consideration. The Station is also
interested in the possibility of recruiting Identity-10 in
order to send him to the World Youth Festival at. Sofia,
since it is believed by\(LINLUCK) that Identity-1 still has
access to some worthwhilé contacts in Central. American
young Communist circles. mre

16, Testing for Indications of Effectiveness to Determine
Future Direction of LYANCHOR Project:

a, It i8 estimated that it will not cost over U.S.
$200 to hire clipping services in Buenos Aires, Montevideo,
Santiago and Bogota for a three month trial period to test
whether newspapers which receive LIANCHOR material in those
cities are publishing the LIANCHOR material, The clipping
services will be asked to watch for articles with the
LIANCHOR by-line, the by-lines of LIANCHOR writers and the
headlines or titles which are assigned by LIANCHOR to the
articles mailed to the newspapers.

b, If the clipping service tests show that newspapers
or periodicals in two of the above cited countries are
publishing LIANCHOR material, Station will continue .to
pursue the development of a small and responsive leftist
writer group as one phase of the LIANCHOR operation. The
rationale behind this decision is that there is little
justification in operating a press service, even a cheap
one, with a readership limited to Mexico, Central America,
Venezuela and Bolivia. However, if the press service can
acquire, or has acquired, readership in any two of the
countries in 16—a above then it is felt that the total
areu coverage is significant and worth maintaining.

17. Conversion of LIANCHOR to Temporary Roof Project for

Singleton Leftist Writer Assets: If as a result of clipping

service tests the decision is reached not to continue develop-
ment of a leftist writer group press service, LIANCHOR will be
converted to a roof project for the administration and funding
of singleton writer agents. Identity-l, if recruited, will be
told to use the LIANCHOR stationery and list of publishing
newspapers to develop hi: own prestige and readership abroad,
but he will not be ask. . to find additional writers for the
press service. At the cnd of FY 1969 the LIANCHOR project will
be terminated as such and its funds and such agents as have
been developed under LIANCHOR wiil be documented under Project
LILISP-E for FY 1970, , Le ! fh
