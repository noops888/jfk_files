1. Since the last week in Aucust. 1957 this station has been trying to induce
~ the Mexican Government to deport subject (an American Communist who, for a time after
his departure had power of attorney for Alirod Ks Stern) fron Nexico. This effort

hag.been mocnted through LIKAYsK-2.

2. ‘In mid Septembér LIKAYAK-2 reported that he had svcceeded in cetting this
matter to the attention ef the President of Mexico through one of the President's
personal advisors named Jose Lorenzo G.SsI, Through this channel the President
was cenerally informed on Nalperints Communist affiliations and his connection with
Stern, Recontendations were also made by the stztion that Stern's money (which he
had left in Fexico) be frozen if possible and that llalperin be dezorted,

3. In the three months following tliese developments, repeated requests’ for
news on the matter were made tc LIKIYAx=-2, who stcted each tine that he had done al)
he could when he brought the ratter to the resident's attention and that he could _
not force the point further. "Me did, hodever, mention it fran tine te tine to beth:
Fernando XCKAN Lugo, Undersecretary of Interiar, and to COSSIO,

&. At the end of Ausust and beginzing of September, Halzerin was
freely expressing confidence that his Mexican imrigrant.capers would be
precessed through in quick time and he anticirated no trouole becatsé of ;
his associaticn witi: Stern. Towsris the end of Seotember, liovaver, and uae
thereafter, Halrerin's confidence declined as his pavers were ‘continually :

: the Mexican baxks involved insisted they were bound by invemmstional banking
i laws and coli not do this, A transfer cf $659,000 (U. 5.) was mede; but
the Swiss bank refused to accert it, retumed it to Mexico,

5S. On 2 Decender 1957 LINAYik=2 passed to the case officer s list of ten or so

that since the Halzerin natter had hung fire fer so long he thous’ is

quite confident that in would be aventually deported but stated he would
again look into the ratter.

the case must be very clear thot tio foreigner has operates 3g2inst

Mexican interests.” nother is that the case must be very streaz since

applicable in this case, is that tho Governnent does not vi:

criminal. Tie gevernzent isi respectink the Nexican princinle of

. On the other hand, LIKAYAK-2 states ‘that the Government has a
Teccurde wiich is not as blunt aa Article 33 but is ustially sufficient to

the subject the Mexican Governnent's dissatisfaction with having him in

- gan vary frm a couple of weeks to several months. This, incidentally,
was the means used to obtain the departure of the Nicaracuan Conmunist
