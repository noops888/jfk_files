Mr. Averell Harrizan,
Us. S. Special Representative, .
Economie Cooperation Adminiatration,
Hotel Talleyrand,

Paria, Frances

Dear Averell:

On'the point of departure from Vienna, I want to resord
with you my appreciation of the services rendered me in thie
Mission over the 1: ‘ew weeks by Mr. Howard Hunt, Information
Orfiver, temporarily assigned here from your staff.

Hunt hee not only carried the duties and responsibilities
of Informetion Officer, pending appointment of Mr. Wilson to
that post, but he has, additionally, carried a 1 load for me
in connection with the Roes murder incident. He has acted as a
persons] aide, to all intente and purposes, at a time when,
understaffed s¢ thie Mission 1s, we were faced with a concentra-
tion of vitally important work in connection with our normal
Mission operations.

1 think Huat has “shown a broad-gauged grasp of what ERP is,
what ECA do, and what Information work in behalf of both should
be. Besides thie, he is the right kind of person to havo in this
great ECA underteking. I hops you wil] be able to keep him ond to
Give him opportunities to express his abilities fully.

Sincerely, tillbeerc

Weetmore Willcox
Chief of Special Mission

MEMORANDUM IN LIEU OF FITNESS REPORT

SUBJECT : Howard E, Munt, GS-15, Employee
Number 015842, DOB: October 1918; ~

_EUR/CA; Career; Servico Designa=
tion: ‘D.
PERIOD UNDER REVIEW : 22 Juno 1968 - 31 March 19687

MONTHS UNDER MY SUPERVISION: 7

OVER-ALL RATING : Strong

1, Mr. Hunt took on his present duties as EUR/CA in ~
July 1968, Wis performance in this position has beon con-
sistently Strong.

2. From the period of his previous assignment to EUR's
Special Activities Staff, Mr. Hunt has made a substantial
contribution to the refinement and recasting of CA operational
concepts which has been underway in the Division since the
termination over the past two years of many long established
projects. He has a fine political senso and a sound grasp of
European realities and evolutions, While con¢erned with the
role and methods of political action, his mind is essentially
operational, imaginative, and perhaps at its happicst in the
recognition of opportunities and tho stimulation of specific
action in the field, In both these areas he has shown a power
of original thought, persuasiveness in presenting his views,
and persistance and vigor in Helping get action underway.

3. There are three primary aroas in which Mr, Hunt has
played an important role in the Division's business, The
first is in providing consistent staff assistance to Branches
and Stations in the conduct of on-going CA action, and the
modification and relocation of certain activities of concern
to the Senior Staff and other divisions, He has brought to
this work a balanced view of Division and Senior Staff equi-
ties, an cxcellent arareness of realities in the field and of
the practical Himits imposed by the ficld priorities, manpower,

and the requirements of sectirity, *



4.° Secondly, Nr. Hint has cafried with him from SAS

a continuing participation in the work of-that staff in its
two aspects: the countering of Sovict political action and
a reawakened and redefined concern with Communist Party
operations. Ho has contributed to the definition of ‘these
interests and worked. closely with the Branches in identi:
fying opportunities. , Neither of these areas are of a-nature
that-has made for prompt common understanding between Hedd=
quarters and the field. Yr. Hunt's TDY's have been ‘of

major assistance in furthering this understandings

Mr, Hunt has assumed a particularly im-
portant role in responding to-requirements for memoranda, -
studies and suggestions which the Division has been asked
to produce since the beginning of a new national Administra>
tion in January, Intimately coupled with this is direct
support to the Chief of the Division in the latter's par-
ticipatton in the Interdepartmental Group, and the annlyses
and studies which have derived from that partictpation,

5. Thirdly, Mr,

6. In all these duties, Mr, Hunt's performance has

reflected sagacity, balance, and imagination, He has had,
- t6 Bis crédit, the idvantage of exccllent give and take

with the Diviston's branches and a sound knowledge of branch
people and capacities. He has drawn with equal offective-
ness upon a broad range of personal associations in other
divisions and senior staffs, and upon a deep experience of
the mechanics, nuances and occasional delicacies of getting
business done at Headquarters.

7. In summary, Mr. Hunt's has been the performance of
a very competent, tough-minded senior professional in a
period which has somewhat changed the nature of tho CA
officer's duties within the Division.

REVIEWING- OFFICER'S COMMENTS:

Although I would not differ from the evaluative
comment on this.officer, I would be inclined to rate his
over-all pérformance as highly PROFICIENT rather than
Strong, in view of his broad experience and grade. This
officer has had a series of personal and taxing problems,
beyond his control, which have tended to dull his cutting
edge just enough to be noticeable.

Before Subject assumed direct responsibility for this project, it had suffered from .

NARRATIVE COMNENTS :

* Mr: "Hunt continued to diréct the propaganda activities of thé DOPiviaion
in.a superior professional ‘manner until’ 12 October 1964, when'he was incapacitated
by illriess. On his return from sick leave on 7 December, he Was tailed to the
Office of the DD/P and officially transferred to that office on 28 Feb ‘dary 1965. DO
Division can only view this transfer with considerablé regret,

Mr, Hunt, by virtue of his personal background, has a unique flair and com-
petence in the propaganda field, Over and above, but complementary to these special
skills, his extensive experience in the CS, his sound judgment, high and creative
intellect and other commendable personal qualities contributed significantly to the
successful prosecution of DO's efforts in the media field. These same atributes,
attest, in my judgment, to his suitability for employment as a Station Chief or in any
other position requiring broad knowledge of and skill in the CS business, He is very
cost conscious and an effective supervisor,’ He enjoys the respect of all personnel
under his supervision, official and non-official, as well as that of all his co-workers

in the Division and Station,

MEMORANDUM IN LIEU OF FLUTNESS REPORT
: Howard E. Hunt, GS-15, Employee

SUBJECT E el
Number 013842, DOB: October 1918;
EUR/CA; Career; Servico Designa-
tion: D. 7
PERIOD UNDER REVIEW : 22 June 1968 - 31 March 19687

MONTHS UNDER MY SUPERVISION: 7
OVERALL RATING : Strong

1, Mr, Hunt took on his present duties as EUR/CA in
July 1968. His performance in this position has been con-

sistently Strong.

2. From the period of ‘his previous assignment to EUR's
Special Activities Staff, Mr. Hunt has made a substantial
contribution to the refinement and recasting of CA operational
concepts which has been underway in the Division since the
termination over the ‘past two years of many long established
projects. He has a fine political sense and a sound grasp of

“European realities and evolutions, While concerned with the
role and methods of political action, his mind is essentially
operational, imaginative, and perhaps at its happiest in the
recognition of opportunities and the stimulation of specific
action in the ficld, In both these areas he has shown a power
of original thought, persuasiveness in presenting his views,
and persistanco and vigor in helping get action underway.

3. There are three primary areas in which Mr. Hunt has
played an important role in the Division's business, The
first is in providing consistent staff assistance to Branches
and Stations in the conduct of on-going CA action, and the
modification and relocation of certain activities of concern
to the Senior Staff and other divisions. He has brought to
this work a balanced view of Division and Senior Staff equi-
ties, ah excellent awareness of realities in the field and of
the practical limits imposed by the tield priorities, manpower,
and the requirements of security.



SECRET

a L)

4 ieqeeauiy! Mr. Hunt has carried with him from SAS
a continuing participation in the work of that staff in its
two aspects:- the-countering of Soviet political action and
a reawakened and redefined concern with Communist Party _
operations; He has contributed to the definition of these
interests and worked -closely..with the Branches in tdenti-
fying opportunities, Neither of these areas are of a nature
that has made for ‘prompt common understanding between Head=-
quarters and the field. Mr. Hunt's TDY's have been of
major assistance in furthering this understanding.

5. Thirdiy, Mr. Hunt has assumed a particularly im-
portant role in responding to requirements for memoranda,
studies and suggestions which the Division has been asked
to producé since the beginning of a new national Administra-
tion in January. Intimately coupled with this is direct
support to the Chief of the Division in the latter's par-
ticipation in the Interdepartmental Group, and the analyses
and studies which have derived from that participation,

6. In all these duties, Mr. Hunt's performance has
reflected sagacity, balance, and imagination. He has had,
to his credit, the advantage of excellent give and take
with the Division's’ branches and a sound knowledge of branch

- people and capacities. He has drawn with equal effective-
hess upon a broad range of personal associations in other
divisions and senior staffs, and upon a deep experience of
the mechanics, nuances and occasional delicacies of getting
business done at Headquarters.

7. In summary, Mr, Hunt's has been the performanes -of
a very competent, tough-minded senior professional in a
period which has somewhat changed the nature of the CA
officer's duties within the Division,

REVIEWING OFFICER'S COMMENTS: |

Although I would not' differ from the evaluative
comment on this officer, I would be inclined to rate his
over-all performance as highly PROFICIENT rather than
Strong, in view of his broad experience and grade, This
officer has hada series of personal and taxing problems,
beyond-his control, which have tended to dull his cutting
edge just enough to be noticeable.

Mz, Hunt is an officer with real ability, creative and MWAdumial. During
the period under review, he has done a great deal to tighten up the operaticn of
his shop, The amorphous aspects of some projects he inherited have been
eliminated or cut down to size, He has a pleasant and engaging personality

and a broadly based background,

Uf there are any areas of weaknéss in his performance it is only beca
his potential is s0 considerable. For example, it is possible that the staff and
planning aspects of his job could receive more attention although, admittedly,
there is a large grey area between the responsibilities of the CA Staff and the

responsibilities of DODS in this respect.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT; Mr. E, Howard Huot

1, On 21 June 1972 Mr. Robert Tegetholf, INR, Department of
State, informed Mr. James Franklin, Chief, CCS/OC3, that the
Department of State:had-received press inquirtes in regard to Mr.

E,. Howard Hunt's service with the Department of State, INR had
arranged for withholding any Department of State replies until CIA
had been consultéd.’ Mr. Hunt's cover record. showed that he was‘Ia

. integrated Department. of State status ta Mexico from 1950 until 1953

and b from 1937 until 1960, He also had nominal domestic
Department of State cover from 1966 urtil he retired tn 1970, Upon

- retirement, Mr. Hunt was " opened up " as a CIA employee back to
“EOD. in November 1949, .

2. Inthe absence of both Messrs. Osburn, Director of Security,
and Geiss, Deputy Director, I discussed the State Department request
with Mr. Leo Dunn, Acting Deputy Director of Security for Personnel
Security, He concluded that everything considered, the Department
should say that Mr, Hunt way assizacd to the Department while in
integrated status but, when pressed, not deny his basic CLA status,
‘While trying to clear this Itue.with the ADDP, Mr. Geiss called and
at the end of our discusslon, cautioned that any guidance to the
Department of State In regard to Mr, Hunt should be cleared with the

pel,
3. [then talked to Mr. Sam Halpern, EA/DDP, to determine

the whereabouts of Mr. Meyer. He recommended that [ raik to both:
Messrs. Meyer and Colby who were in the OPPB think tank,



SLUNCE

whlch were | wade to the Department of State fa the afternoon of
: + £0 Jang 1972, ‘These -inguirtes-had particular ‘reference to-Mr. Hunt's

t jessra. Unuinb and King igreed the press should be laformed
that he was fot onthe Stare Department's payroll during the period,
- “Mr, Unum confirmed this arrangement when I called him and said
that-he had added that Mr, Huct rettred tn good standing from CIA
‘ig April 1970. -1 alsa ’cleared the proposed guidance ‘vith Mr, Ted
Shackley, Gilef, WH Division.

5. Ithen.saw Messrs, Colby and Méyer, outlined'the Department
of State's request and our proposed reply that Mr. Hunt, duriag his
: integrated service li. Mexico and Iwas assigned to the *
Department of State,’ This inJormatton would. nét be volunteered by the
Department of Staté, and Mr, Hunt's basic:status as a CIA employee
“would not be denied Lf raised. by members of the press. Meséra, Colby
and Meyer-agreed thar this was.the only feasible line totake, [then —
asked: Mr. Colby. whether additional clearance from the DCI was required.
He repiled that tt was not, and that he would brief the DCI. i

: 6, I informed Mr, Geiss of Messrs. Colby's and Meyer's decision

Attachment to Fitness Report of Howard Hunt 31 March 63 ~ 31 March 64

Section C (Continued)

Special mention should be made of Subject's objectivity and integrity in
carrying out-his responsibilities, These were best demonstrated when
he promptly and swiftly terminated a large and effective radio broadcast
ing project, to éstablish which he and his subordinates had labored hard,
immediately upon belated discovery that insuperable, practical obstacles
precluded realization of the project's theoretical potential,

Subject's professional background has attuned his constant attention to

FI operational opportunities arising in the course of his current CA
activities, a practice consistent with hia habit of seeking maximum benefit
for every.dollar apent in time, effort or cash.
