Dear Mr. Houston:

On January 15, 1967, agents of the Bureau of Customs
arrested three men at Tamiami Airport, Dade County, Florida,
as they were preparing to depart in an airplane carrying bombs,
napalm, and some small arms. The men were charged with violating
Title 22, United States Code, Section 1934. The United States
Attorney for the Southern District of Florida is presenting this
matter to a grand jury and will seek an indictment which probably
will charge offenses under 22 U.S.C. 1934, 18 U.S.C. 960, and
49 U.S.C. 1522. The following individuals are possible defendants
under the prospective indictment:
