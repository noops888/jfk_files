PETER COHEN

SF T-5 has reported that on December 7, 25, PETER
COHEN made the following statement in Berkeley:

The struggle to build the American re-
volution is as much a struggle to save

the human race from nuclear destruction

as it is one for socialism. America is
not a healthy society. I defend terrorism.
Bank robbery is fine, but it does little
to weaken the gov ment: it -only outs
money into hands of revolutionaries. As
for the killing of President K DY, shoot-
ing the President is a legitimate, left-
wing act of terror.

issued by the VDC and printed by the "“erkelev Free Press.

A Xerox.copy of the leaflet follows.

eo cee

NW 64954 Docld:34530150 Page 29


You may soon be sent to Vietnam. You have heard about the war in the news;

your officers will give you pep talks about it.

But you probably feel as confused and

uncertain as most Americans do. . Many people will tell you to just follow orders

and leave the thinking to others.

But you have the right to know as much about this

war as anyone, After all, it's you—not your congressman—who might get killed.

WHY ARE WE FIGHTING IN VIETNAM ?

We are supposed to be fighting to protect
democracy in Vietnam, and yet our own gov~
ernment admits that South Vietnam is run by
a dictatorship. General Ky, the latest mili-
tary dictator, is as badas they come. Ina
recent interview he said: "People ask me
who my heroes are. I have only one -- Hit-
ler. I admire Hitler because he pulled his
country together when it was in a terrible
state." (London Sunday Mirror, July 4, 1965).

General Ky doesn't mean much tous; we're
not even sure how to pronounce his name, but
the South Vietnamese have lived under men
like him for years. As far as the Vietnamese
are concerned, we are fighting on the side of
Hitlerism; and they hope we lose.

‘WHO IS THE ENEMY?

U.S. military spokesmen have often said
that their greatest problem is finding the ene-
my. The enemy, they say, is everywhere.
The oldwoman feeding her chickens may have
astock of hand grenades in her hut. The lit-
tle boy who trails after the American sol-
diers during the day slips out to give informa-
tion to the guerillas at night. ‘The washer-
womanat the Americanair base brings a bomb
to work one day. It is impossible, say the
military, to tell which are the Viet Cong and
which are the civilians.

Andso, because the whole Vietnamese peo-
ple seem to be the enemy, the military is
taking no chances. They use tear gas -- a
weapon designed for use against civilians.
They order American troops to fire at women
and children -- because women and children,
after all, arefiringat American troops. Am-
erican fighter planes destroy civilian villages
with napalm; American B-52's are flattening
whole regions. That is why the war in Viet-
nam is so often called a "dirty war."

When the South Vietnamese people see you
in your foreign uniform, theyqwjlj think of

youas their enemy. You are the ones bomb-
ing their towns. They don't know whether
you're a draftee or a volunteer, whether
you're for the war or against it; but they're
not taking any chances either.

FREE ELECTIONS

The Vietnamese would like to vote the for-
eigners out of their country, but they have
been denied the chance, According to the
Geneva Agreement of 1954, there were sup-
posed to be elections throughout Vietnam in
1956. But the U.S, government was certain
that our man in Vietnam, Premier Diem,
would lose. So we decided not to allow any
election until we were. sure we could win.
Diem set up a political police force and put
all political opposition -- Communist and
anti-Communist -- in jail, By 1959, it was
clear there weren't going to be any elections,
and the guerillas known as the Viet Cong be-
gan to fight back, By 1963 our government
wasfedup with Diem, but still wasn't willing
torisk elections. Our CIA helped a group of
Vietnamese generals to overthrow Diem and
killhim. Since then there have been a series
of "better" military dictators. General Ky --
the man who admires Hitler -- is the latest
one.

FIGHTING FOR DEMOCRACY

Your jobasa soldier is suppc'sed to be "to
win the people of South Vietnam." Win them
towhat -- democracy? No, we keep military
dictators in power. What then? The Ameri-
can way of life? But why should they care
any more about our way of life than we care
about theirs? We can't speak their language
or even pronounce their names. We don't
Imow anything about their religion or even
what it is, We never even heard of Vietnam
until Washington decided to run it.

You are supposed to be fighting "to save
the Vietnamese people from Communism."
Certainly Communist influence is very strong

in the National Liberation Front, the rebel
government. Yet most of the ople support
the NLF. Why? Many ofthe sd: people who
now lead the NLF led the Vietnamese inde-
pendence movemenf against the Japanese dur-
ing World War Il, and then went on to fight
against French colonial rule. Most Vietnam-
ese think of the NLF leaders as their coun-
try's outstanding patriots. Infact, many anti-
Communists have joined the guerrilla forces
in the belief that the most important thing is
to get rid of foreign domination and military
dictators. On the other hand, very few Viet-
namese support the official government of
General Ky. His army has low morale and a
high desertion rate.

THE GUERRILLAS

The. newspapers and television have told
us again and again what a tough fighter the
Vietnamese guerrilla is. Short of ammuni-
tion and without any air cover, he can beat
forces that outnumber him five or ten to.one,
Why do they have such high morale? They
are not draftees; no draftees ever fight like
that. They are not high-paid, professional
soldiers. Most of them are peasants who work
their fields; they can't even spare the amniu-
nition for target practice.

Their secret is that they know why they
arefighting. They didn't hear about Vietnam

=

asked himself why they were shooting at him.

When a certain +n became a center of re-
sistance activity, /e followed his orders and
destroyed the whole town. He knew that SS
men were torturing captured resistance fight
ers, but it wasn't his business to interfere.

FOLLOWING ORDERS

‘Asa soldier you have been trained to obey
orders, but as a human being you must take
responsibility for your own acts. Interna-
tionalandAmerican law recognize that an in-
dividual soldier, even if acting under orders,
must bear final legaland moral responsibility
for what he does. This principle became a
part of law after World War I, when the Al-
liednations, meeting in London, decided that
German war criminals must be punished even
if they committed war crimes under orders.

_This principle was the basis of the Nurem-

berg trials. We believe that the entire war
in Vietnam is criminal and immoral. We be=
lieve that the atrocities which are necessary
towage this war against the people of Vietnam
are.inexcusable. ae

OPPOSE THE WAR

We hope that you too find yourself, as a
human being, unable to tolerate this night-

. mare war; and we hope that you will oppose

inthe newspapers; they've livedthere all their ~

lives. While we were in high school, they
were living under the Diem regime and hating
it. Now American planes are bombing their
towns and strafing their fields; American
troops have occupied their country; and if
they complain out loud, an American- sup-
ported dictator sentences them to jail or the
firing squad. Is it any wonder that they fight
so fiercely ?

CRUSHING THE RESISTANCE

‘The war in Vietnam is not being fought ac-
cordingtothe rules, Prisoners are tortured.
Our planes drop incendiary bombs on civilian
villages. Qur soldiers shoot at women and
children, Your officers will tell you that it is
all necessary, that we couldn't win the war
any other way, And they are right. Ameri-
cans are no more cruel than any other peo-
ple; American soldiers don't enjoy this kind
But if you are going to wage war
ainstan entire people, you have.to become
cruel.

The ordinary German soldier in occupied
Europe wasn't especially cruel, either. But
as the resistance movements grew, he be-
came cruel, He shot at women and children
because they were shooting at him; he never

295

it... We don't know what kind of risks we are
taking in giving you this leaflet; you won't
know what risk you will be taking in opposing
the war. A growing number of Gls have al-
ready refused to fight in Vietnam’ and have -
beencourt-martialed. They have showngreat
courage. We believe that they, together with
other courageous men who will join them, will
have influence far out of proportion to their
numbers.

There may be many other things you can
do; since you are in the service, you know
better than civilians what sorts of opposition
arepossible, Butwhatever youdo, keep your
eyesopen. Draw your own conclusions from
the things you see, read and hear. At orien-
tation sessions, don't be afraid to ask ques-
tions, and if you're not satisfied with the
answers, keep asking. Take every chance
you get to talk to your fellow soldiers about
the war.

You may feel the war is wrong, and still
decide not to face a court-martial. You may
then find yourself in Vietnam under orders.
You. might be forced to do some fighting --
but don't doany more than you have to. Good
luck.

concerning "Citizens Committee for Constitutional Liberties

1. "On the basis of its investigations and
hearings to date, the committee concludes that the
National Assembly for Democratic Rights and a co-
ordinating and organizing group in support thereof,
titled the 'Citizens Committee for Constitutional
Liberties, are communist fronts. Created, dominated
and controlled by members and officials of the Communist
Party, the National Assembly for Democratic Rights and
the Citizens Committee for Constitutional Liberties were
organized as propaganda devices for the conduct of
‘mass activity’ in support of the avowed objectives
‘of ‘reversal or nonapplication' of the Supreme Court
decisions of June 5, 1961, which upheld the constitution-
ality of the registration and disclosure provisions of
the Internal Security Act of 1950 as applied to the
Communist Party, and the Smith Act membership clause
making punishable active and purposive membership in
the Communist Party."

7 se objective of the Citizens
Committee for Constitutional Liberties is to serve as
the vehicle for concealed communist participation in,
and direction of, propaganda and agitational activities
aimed to nullify the Internal Security and Smith Acts."

FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTEE

The April 6, 1960, edition of "The New York Times"
newspaper contained a full-page advertisement captioned
“What Is Really Happening in Cuba," placed by the Fair Play
for Cuba Committee (FPCC). This advertisement announced
the formation of the FPCC in New York City and declared the
FPCC intended to promulgate “the truth about revolutionary
Cuba" to neutralize the distorted American press.

"The New York Times". edition of January 11, 1961,
reported that at a hearing conducted before the United States
Senate Internal Security Subcommittee on January 10, 1961,

Dr. CHARLES A. SANTOS-BUCH identified himself and ROBERT TABER
as organizers of the FPCC. He also testified he and TABER
obtained funds from the Cuban Government which were applied
toward the cost of the aforementioned advertisement.

On May 15, 1963, a source advised that during the
first two years of the FPCC's existenée there was a struggle
between Communist Party (CP) and Socialist Workers Party (SWP)
elements to exert their power within the FPCC and thereby
influence FPCC policy. This source added that during the
past year there had been a successful effort by FPCC leadership
to minimize the role of these and other organizations in the
FPCC so that their influence as of May, 1963, was negligible.

The SWP has been designated by the Attorney
General of the United States pursuant to
Executive Order 10450.

On May 20, 1963, a second source advised that
VINCENT "TED" LEE, FPCC National Office Director, was then
formulating FPCC policy and had indicated that he had no
intention of permitting FPCC policy to be determined by any
other organization. This source stated that LEE believed
that the FPCC should advocate resumption of diplomatic
relations between Cuba and the United States and should
support the right of Cubans to manage their revolution without
interference from other nations. LEE did not advocate
supporting the Cuban revolution per se.

FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTEE (cont'd.)

: The November 23, 1963, edition of "The Hew York
Times" reported that Senator THOMAS J. DODD of Connecticut
had called FPCC "the chief public relations instrument of
the Castro network in the United States." It is to be noted
that Senator DODD was a member of the Senate Internal
Security Subcommittee which twice conducted hearings on the
FPCC.

The December 27, 1963, edition of "The New York
World Telegram and Sun" newspaper stated that the pro-Castro
FPCC was seeking to go out of business and that its prime
activity during its lifetime had been sponsorship of pro-
Castro street rallies and mass picket lines, and the direction
of an active propaganda mill highlighting illegal travel-to-
Cuba campaigns. Its comparatively brief span of life was
attributed to mounting anti-Castro American public opinion,
the 1962 Congressional hearings which-~disclosed FPCC financing
by Castro's United Nations Delega n,eand ultimately, the
bad publicity which the FPCC received from disclosure of
activities on its behalf by suspected Presidential assassin
LEE H. OSWALD.

On February 6, 1964, the previously mentioned
second source advised that V. T. LEE had recently remarked
that the FPCC was dead and that there were no plans to
organize another similar organization.

On April 13, 1964, a third source advised that
there had not been any FPCC activity in many months and that
the FPCC had been dissolved. :

A source has advised that on October 26-27, 1963, a
conference of members of the Communist Party (CP), including
national functionaries, met in Chicago, Illinois, for the purpose
of setting in motion forces for the establishment of a new
national Marxzist-criented youth orgenizatien which would hunt
for the most peaceful transition to socialism. The delegates
to this meeting were cautioned egainst the serm of anti-Soviet
and anti-CP ideologies. These celesates were also told that it
would be reasonable to assume that the voung socialists
attracted into this new organization would eventually pass into
the CP itself,

A second conference of over 20 persons met in Chicago
on Necember 28-29, 1963, for the purpese of initiating a "call"
to the new youth érgani zation and vlanning for a founding
convention toe be held in June, 1964,

A second source has advised that the founding convention

for the new youth organizetion wes held from June 19-21, 1964,

at 150 Colden Cate Avenue, San Francisco, California, at which
time the name “, E. EB. Dubois Clubs of America (DCA) was adopted.
Approximately 500 delegates from. throughout the United States
attended this convention. The aims of this organization, as set
forth in the preamble to the constitution, are, "It is cur

belief that this nation can best solve its problems in an
atmosvhere of peaceful coexistence, complete disarmament and true
freedom for all peoples af the world, and that these solutions
will be reached mainly through the united cinta of all democratic
elements: in our country, composed essentially of the workins people
ellied in the unity of Negroes and other minorities with whites.
We further fully recognize that the ereatest threat to American
democracy comes from the racist and right wing forces in

coalition with the most reactionary sections of the economic power
structure, using the tool of anti~Communism to divide and destroy
the unified struegle of the working veople. As young people in
the forces struggling for democracy, we shall actively strive to
defeat these reactionary and reo-fascist elements and to achieve
complete freedom and democracy for all Americans , thus enabling
each individual to freely choose and build the society he would
wish to live in. Through these strugsles we feel the American
people will realize the viability of the socialist alternative."

YOUNG SOCIALIST ALLIANCE (known in

the San Francisco Bay area as’ the

Bay Area Young Socialist Alliance, aka
the Bay Area Committee of the Young
Socialist Alliance, Zay Area Committee
for the Young Socialist)

A source advised on May 16, 1960, that the Bay Area
Young Socialist Alliance (BAYSA) was foraed in February, 1958,
as the Bay Area Committee for the Young Socialist (BACYS). At
a later stage in its development prior to adoption of tne name
BAYSA, the organization was known as the Bay Area Committee of
the Young Socialist Alliance (BACYSA).

The source advised that as a result of a national
convention held April 15-17, 1860, at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,
the BAYSA became a branch of the national organization to be
known as the Young Socialist Alliance (YSA) and will carry out
in the Northern California area the policies of the YSA.

The source advised August 19, 1965, that the BAYSA is
currently active and is composed of three locals, the San
Francisco YSA, the Berkeley YSA, and the San Jose YSA.

The source advised that the BAYSA, although ostensibly
an independent organization, is in reality controlled by the
San Francisco Branch, Socialist Workers Party (SWPP) and Oakland
Branch SWP.

The SWP has been designated by the
Attorney General of the United States
pursuant to Executive Order 10450.

YOUNG SOCIALIST ALLIANCE

The May, 1960, issue of the "Young Socialist” C"YS™),
pege 1, column 3, disclosed that during April 15-17, 1960, a
national organization entitled "Young Socialist Alliance" (YSA)
was established at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. This issue stated
this organization was formed by the nationwide supporter clubs
of the publication "ys."

The above issue, page 6, set forth the Founding Declaration
of YSA. This declaration stated YSA recognizes the Socialist
“Yorkers Party (SWP) as the only existing political leadership
cn class struggle principles, and that the supporters of the "YS"
have come into basic political solidarity with the SWP on the
principles of revolutionary socialism.

A source advised on May 7, 1365, tHat the original
YSA was an organization formed during October, 1957, in New York
City, by youth of various left-socialist tendencies, particularly
members and followers of the SWP., The leaders of this group were
the guiding forces in the establishment of the national organization.

The source further advised on May 7, 1965, YSA is dominated
and controlled on a national basis by the SWP through having SWP
members comprise exclusively the National Executive Committee (NEC)
and through an official SwpP vepresentative at all YSA NEC meetings.
The YSA, in reality, is the youth and training section of the SYP
and the main source of new'SWP members.

The headquarters of the YSA is located in Room 631,
41 Union Square West, New York City.

The SWP has been designated pursuant to Executive Order
10450.

- 16 Cee LEAGUE aoe

The March 1, 1954, issue of the "Young Socialist Challenge,"
published as page three of "Labor Action," an official publication
of the Indpendent Socialist League (ISL), contained an article
concerning the creation of the YSL, which pointed out that at a
unity conference occurring February 12-14, 1954, at Labor Action
Hall, New York, New York, a merger occurred between the Young
People's Socialist League (YPSL) and the Socialist Youth League
(SYL). The new organization was named the YSL,

A source on June 15, 19544, made available the minutes of
the YSL's National Action Committee meeting of April 13, 1954,
which reflected that one-S. SITEMAN, "Chairman of SP (Socialist
Party) Youth Committee," had objected to a statement appearing in
"Commerce," a New York University journal, which indicated that
the YPSL merged with the SYL to form the YSL, He explained that
the YPSL did not merge with anyone; that it continued to exist as
the youth section of the Socialist Party. He explained that a
small group of the YPSL was dropped, expelled, or suspended from
that organization and joined the SYL, which he characterized as the
youth group of the "Trotskyite ISL." He explained trat after these
few former members of the YPSL joined the SYL, the SYL then pro-
ceeded to change its name for its own purposes.

: On April 9, 1956, a source advised as follows: The YSL
has frequently worked in close sympathetic cooperation with the
ISL toward similar objectives, although each major issue given
mutual consideration is decided upon by these organizations
individudally. The YSL serves as an apprenticeship for the ISL,
but the ISL selection of members from YSL ranks is made man
individual and personal basis. In many instances YSL members are
also members of the ISL, The YSL and the ISL utilize the same
printing house in New York City and the YSL publication is printed
as an insert in “Labor Action." Frequently, lecturers before the
YSL are ISL members.

The September 22, 1958, issue of “Young Socialist
Challenge," which appeared as page five of "Iabor Action," contain-
ed an undated statement from the National Committee of the YSL
which indicated that the YSL had been dissolved. The setement
appeared under the caption "Join the Young Peoples Socialist League."

The YPSL is publicly known as the youth affiliate of the
Socialist Party - Social Democratic Federation.

A source advised on June.12, 1958, that the Berkeley,
California, unit of the YSL was formed in 1954, following the unity
convention held in New York in February 1954, which combined the
forces of the SYL and the YPSL. The source stated that the YSL
in the San Francisco Bay Area continued to operate under the
leadership and guidancecf ISL members.

A source advised on October 9, 1958, that the YSL Branch
dissolved itself in line with the YSL national organization, and
the branch members joined the YPSL.

The May 4, 1942, issue of “Labor Action", then an official
publication of the Workers Party (3P), carried an article which
reflected that the YP was formed in April 1940, as a result
of a split within the leadership of the Socialist Workers Party (SIP).
The article stated that when the Hitler-Stalin Pact was signed and
Poland invaded, the minority group within the SYP, in proclaiming
the formation of the WP, condemned the pact as being imperialistic
in nature and stated it would not support either imperialist camp.

The April 25, 1949, issue of “Labor Action“ contained
an account of the Fifth National Convention of the WP, held March
24-27, 1949, in New York City, which reflected the change of name
of the organization from the WP to the Independent Socialist League
<ISL) in order to emphasize the character of the group as a
oropaganda group for the spreading of socialist ideas and not as a
full-fledged political party.

The July 14, 1958, issue of “Labor Action", an official
gublication of the ISL, contained an article captioned "Tne ISL
?rogram in Brief." The article indicated: “The ISL stands for
socialist democracy and against the two systems of exploitation
vhich now divide the world: capitalism and Stalinism. The ISL,
as a Marxist movement, looks to the working class and its ever-present
struggle as the basic progressive force in society. The ISL is
organized to spread the ideas of socialism in the labor movement and
among all other sections of the people. There can be no lasting and
senuine democracy without socialism and there can be no socialism
without democracy."

The September 22, 1958, issue of “Labor Action" contained
an undated statement signed by the Political Committee of the ISL
which indicated that the ISL had been dissolved. The statement
arged former ISL members to join the Socialist Party - Social
Democratic Federation.

The SWP has been designated by the Attorney General
of the United States pursuant to Executive Order |
10450.

A source advised on May 21, 1958, that the San. Francisco
3ay Area Branch, Independent Socialist League, was an adjunct of the
National Organization. The Branch had representation on the National
committee of the Independent Socialist League; it participated in
the campaigns of the Independent Socialist League, and contributed
financially to the support of the National Organization.

The source advised on August 11, 1958, that the San
‘rancisco Bay Area Branch, Independent Socialist League, had
lissolved itself and the members had joined the Local Branch of the
socialist Party - Social Democratic Federation.

YOUTH FOR JOBS (YFJ), aka
Youth for Jobs Committee

A source advised in July 1963, that several recent :
graduates and dropouts of high schools in Oakland and Berkeley,
California, had on April 17, 1963, attended the organizing meeting
of Youth for Jobs (YFJ) in Oekland, California, in response to:
letters prepared by ROSCOE PROCTOR and DOUGLAS WACHTER. At this
meeting, WACHTER gave reports on the unemployment problem among
youth and the need for an organization of this type. FROCTOR also
spoke at this meeting.

In May 1963, a second source advised that
ROSCOE PROCTOR attended meetings of the
National Executive Committee of the Communist
Party (CP), USA, during May 1963, in New
York City.

In January 1963,athird source identified
DOUGLAS WACHTER as the Chairman of a CP re-
cruiting class held in January 1963, in
Berkeley, California.

In May 1963, the first source advised that in May 1963,
a l2-page pamphlet entitled "Youth for Jops#Aims and Purposes"
was distributed. This pamphlet described YFJ as an independent
organization of young people working together to find solutions to
current vocational, social and recreational problems; it specified
that YFJ is not affiliated with any other organizations, but would
fully support the labor movement and any other organizations striv-
ing to combat unemployment and to increase Job security for all
employees.

In June 1963, the third source advised that at a meeting of
the Political Committee of the CP of the East Bay Region (Alameda
and Contra Costa Counties, California) held in June 1963, VIRGINIA
PROCTOR, member of that Committee, gave a report on a draft docu-
ment read before the National Committee, CP, USA, by GUS HALL, mem-
ber of the National Committee, CP, USA, In connection with the
portion of the report dealing with youth, PROCTOR said "A report
from this area on the activity around Youth for Jobs organized by
ROSCOE PROCTOR will be included in the final document, as one of
the signs of the Party work in organizing the unemployed."

On May 3, 1965, a fourth source advised that ROSCOE
PROCTOR has promoted and guided YFJ since its inception and contin-
ues to do so. The source stated that meetings of YFJ are held at
the YFJ Club House, 1095 - 59th Street, Oakland, California, and
at homes of individual members. ,
