Publication of Itens Relating to Cuban Operations

1, We met with Grayston Lynch, a retired Agency etaff exployes
en 7 January 1976 at his hors in » Florida, Lynch hed requested
‘the meeting through contact with OCC. One itea.of interest to Lynch
-eoneceras a bea he-wishes to-write on Cuban operations dutiag the _
Period. 1961-67. Lynch currently 1s in the process of preparing one
‘book (n: tha Bay of Piga) for publication, Recently, however, he
spoke vith George Crile, who ie vriting a book on Watergate burglars
Bugenia Martines and Bernari Barker. Crile indicated he and co-author
Tayler Branch plan to follow that book with ona on the Agency's Cuban
operations, and focus on Lynch.and William Roberteon, tvo major figures
in the Bay of Pigs invasion, “Sines Hartines wae deeply involved vith
Lynch as a-ship captain during the Bay of Pigs and in subsequent
operations ageinst Cuba, he will be tho primary source for the book.

2. Lynch. believes the story Nartinex vill provide will be soxewhat
inaccurate because bo only aa developments-from the- vantage point “of
@ ohip captain. Lyaca (whese cohort Roberteon te deceased) believes
only ba ear provide an accurate recounting. The Martinez book is
echedeled for printing ia the sumer of 1976. Lynch would Lika to
beat Crile and Branch to the punch. Indeed, he believes they will nor
pebdligh their book 1f tney know he ta going to publish one on tha. sama
subject. What Lynch wishes issn indication of ganeral Agency reaction
to any wanuseript he might write on the period. :

3. Lynch wiebed to write about the operations of the AMLILAC ~
group (Commandos Monbise!) during the period 1961-67, when Lyoch
conducted about 100 infiltration and exfiltration operations in Cuba,
Any mamecript he. dréfes will, of course, ba submitted to the Agency
for review. Ha doea not wish to get into the writing Job, however,
if there ia.a blanket prohibition on describing Agency operations
whieh occuvred in that ‘period and place. He notes that Martiner, sot
fettered Ly Agency restrictions, will provide Crile and Branch with
his recolieetions. Lynch believes he ‘can cover the miterial in a way
which wll not hurt ‘anyoue or expose anything, He had n0 intentions
of gett‘ng into the comiande raid recoumting businesa until he heard
froa Crile recently. :

4. Since tim is importaat on this mtter, Lynch shall appreciate
a fairly quick response on this question. He recognizes no final
decision on his manuscript ean be mede util Agency officials review
it. At the sang time, howaver, it my not be too difficnit:to ascsrtain
the presence or absence of @ blanket restriction on writing about this

Quality Uranium Deposits in*
Cuban Mine

‘This report is believed to contain information of operational interest and may not be disclose¢ to. personnel outside
the Directorate of Operations without the prior permission of the Domestic Collection Divison.

1. Bulegio Centitto, | ] 1
is a former Cuban general. In 1956, when
ete he was the Chief of the Cuban Air Force under Cuban dictator Batista,
Bae ny . Centillo’a uncle cems to him with an ore sanple the uncle had
uncovered in an abandoned former Spanish mine in Cuba. The mcle
suspected the ore vas uraninm. Cantillo brought the specimen to
the US, where it was assayed by an unnamed US survey company as
being the richest uranium sumple the fira had ever tested. Cantilo
aad the mele, who were the only Individuals aware of the location’
of the mine, recognized archaic Cuben lave did not protect their
find, 20 the general attempted to get Batista to change the mining
statutes. Batista suspscted tha gsneral had come across somthing
sigificent, andhhe sent a tean of}men to tha Pinar del Rio area
for six months on a search, The team uncovered nothing. Batista
. also tried to work out a deal vheré he vould be a partner in the
H wenture as a pre-condition to changing the mining lays. He was .
i unsuccessful. in convincing Cantillg to permit him to become a
partner. At that time, the revolution reached full intensity, and . 7 ee
Batiota left the country.

23 Cantillo's uncle is still in capa. | Despite Cantdllo’s imprisonment
by the Fidel Castro regime for nine years, he has never told snyone
about.bis uncle's find, Avproximately one year ago, Cantillo
approached a retired Agency staff employee and informed hin of the
uncle's find. He did eo after all ithese years because of the on
developing relations between the US:and Cuba, Cantillo feels the as
US may te able to make use of informatica. that Castro does not
possess about the riches that exist in his om nation, end that
Castro and the USSR would capitalize on the find if they were to a
Decome avare of it. In his viey, the 0S shoula knov of this
potentiad before it conducts negotiaticas with Castro. The general
is willing to provide the name of the assay company, so that ia
documentation can ba obtained on the purity of the uranium.

3. The’ general's US contact notes Cantillo is not the sort of mn vho

5 speaks inaccurately abevt thingd och as this. He describe! Cantillo e
bd ass “solid my", and says tha information Cantillo has provided a I
7 probably is reliable. ; 3
