and focue on Lynch and Willlam Robertson, two Enjor figures

1i tha Bas of Plga Invasion. Since Martines van deeply Iavolved with

Lach as a ship esptain during the Bay of Pigs and In subsequent

operstions ágainst Cuba, he uill he cho primary surce for the book.

2.

wach ballaves the story Martines will provide will be somewhat

Insccurate becauss ba only saw developnentg from the vantage point of

a ship captain.

Lyacia (shose cohort Robertion 1a daceased) ballaves

only ba ear provide an accurate recounting.

Tha Martines book 18

beat Colla and Branch to the punch.

Indeed, he belleves they sill not

1. John Greaney, OGC, called this date to advise that ex-cla

natone wants re consult ays a bit officer on some under tele protes

concerning other ex-CIA employees..

it seems that Lynch, who was

involved in

the Bay of Plas operation and is an open protagonist of

CIA, is writing a book. He is in contact with Greaney with respect

to OGe's need to revier the book before it is published.

Greaney, who belleves that Lynch may be connected with

Dave Philips: Ex-CIA Employces Association, asked if we could have

a DCD officer from the Miant Field Office visit Lynch In Tampa,

some importance and urgency to his request and indicated that it :

would be advantageous for the Agency to remain on nood terms with Lynch.

I told him I would pass his request on to higher DCD

authority and let him krow what is decided. Lynch's address 1s:

8709 Bay Point Drive, Tampa, Florida, telephone: 813-884-8610.
