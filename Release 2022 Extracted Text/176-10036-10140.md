2. COLONEL THAO SAID THAI THE COUP D'ETAT GROUP TO WHICH HE BELONGS IS

PLANNING CAREFULLY AND MOVING CAUTIOUSLY TOWARD A COUP SINCE THEY WISH TO BE

REASONABLY CERTAIN OF SUCCESS. HE STATED THAT THE GROUP WILL TAKE ACTION WHEN

THE RIGHT COMBINATION OF UNITS IS ACHIEVED. HE CLAIMED THAT THE MOVEMENT OF

MILITARY UNITS TO SUPPORT AN ATTEMPIED COUP WAS GOING FAIRLY WELL AND THAT THE

GROUP WAS NOW TRYING TO OBTAIN THE SUPPORT OF THE ARMORED UNITS IN SAIGON, WHICH

WOULD MAKE A SUCCESSFUL: COUP MUCH EASIER TO ATTAIN AND WOULD CAUSE LESS BLOODSHED.

3. THAO REMARKED THAT THE DEPARTURE OF TRAN KIM TUYEN, FORMER DIRECTOR OF

THE PRESIDENTIAL SECURITY SERVICE, FROM SOUTH VIETNAM WILL PROBABLY HAVE AN

ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE TUYEN GROUP COUP D'ETAT PLANNING, BUT MIGHT PROVE BENEFICIAI

TO THAO'S GROUP AS NGO DINE NHU MIGHT RELAX IN THE KNOWLEDGE THAT ONE OF THE

GOVERNMENT OF VIETNAM'S MOST DANGEROUS ENEMIES IS OUT OF THE WAY.

4. THAO MAINTAINED THAT. THE GENRALS OF THE ARMY OF THE REPUBLIC OF VIETNAM

ARE UNDEPENDABLE; THEY CLAIM THAT THEY ARE AWAITING A POSITIVE INDICATION THAT THE

NGO FAMILY IS PLACING PRESERVATION OF THEIR OWN PERSONAL POWER ABOVE THAI OF THE

COUNTRY, AND/OR POSITIVE PROOF THAI NHU IS DEALING WITE THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF

VIETNAM. THAO REMARKED THAI THESE ARE MERELY EXCUSES AND THAT THE GENERALS ARE

AFRAID OF LOSING PRIVILEGED POSITIONS.

5.. THAO REMARKED THAI, IN HIS OPINION, NEU MIGHT THINK THAT HE CAN MAKE A

DEAL WITH THE COMMUNISTS AND END UP BY TRICKING THEM. THAO CLAIMED, HOWEVER, THAT

IF NHU ACTUALLY BELIEVES SUCH A THING, HE IS VERY MUCH MISTAKEN. THAO STATED THAT

NEU COMPARED WELL WITH HIGH-RANKING COMMUNISTS, BUT THAT HE MAKES UNILATERAI

DECISIONS WHILE THE COMMUNISTS MAKE DECISIONS ONLY AFTER DISCUSSIONS, THUS

PRECLUDING SERIOUS ERRORS. THAO SAID THAT, WHEN SPEAKING WITH NHU, HE HAS OFTEN

FELT TRAT HE WAS SPEAKING WITH A COMMUNIST SINCE NEU IS ALSO DEVIOUS, DISRESPECI-

FUL OF LEGALITY; AND WILL DO ANYTHING TO FURTHER HIS OWN GOALS.

6.

THAO COMMENTED THAT. NHU RECENTLY TOLD THAI LANG. NGHIEM, A CLOSE. FRIEND

OF NEU, THAT HE WAS GOING TO DO SOMETHING SOON THAT WOULD BE VERY SURPRISING,

BUT THAT IT WAS TOO EARLY TO DIVULGE WHAT HE HAS IN MIND. THAO HAD NO IDEA WHAT

NHU HAD IN MIND, BUT SPECULATED THAT IT MIGHT BE SOMETHING TO DO WITH NORTH

VIETNAM.
