1. By reference dispatch we zenticned an intriguing turn of events
in the Costille/Golub relationship concerning the latter's request for
Gostitle te fix hin up with 2 girl, However, we vould first like to bring
you completely up to date on our contact with Golub. We have recently been
ha er of consular xatters which we havedealt with through Golub.
A nunber of Americans have been calling at the U, S. Fabassy who have not
previously applied for Soviet visas and express e desire to travel to the
USSR, Costille has been referring these Anericans directly to Golub at the
Soviet Rabasey, a8 Golub once told Costille that he had the authority to
grant visas without prior approval fren Hoscow. As long as the Americans
had nade travel arrangenénts through a locel travel bureau, as well as hotel
reservations, he stated he had ne objections in giving them a visa in a
matter of minutes, We have had four occasions to try Golub out in thie
matter, and a0 fer he has fulfilled his promise, Golub. on 3 August invited

Costille for drinks ina local bar, and Costille asked hin again if he was
still. willing to continue handling the Americans that he referred to Golub
at the Soviet Consulate. Golub stated that he was because he was interested
in having Americans visit the Soviet Union. "And besides," he edded, "since
you are allowing Khrushchev to visit the U. S., there is no reason why I
can't let ordinary Acericans cone to the USSR." Golub then began asking
about the official functions of an American Consulate and began comparing his

duites with ours, bhen he listed his typical duties, he added that it was
his responsibility as a Soviet Consul to hendle Soviet defectors who cone to
Finlend. Golub mentioned that he had just returned from one of his more un-
pleasant’ duties of recovering the tody of a Soviet sailor, who had gone berserk
‘and had shot and killed a number of Soviet citizens on an island off the ccast
of Estonia, stole a small rotor launch and headed for Finlend, His body was
found in the sea by a Finnish fishermen near the Finnish island of Mustatavenen
with a Finnish life jacket on, (This was reported in most of the Finnish
newspapers.) Hvidently, the Soviet had attempted to swim for it cnd drowned.
Golub stated that he had to go to this island, recover the body and bring it
back to Helsinki where it was put into 2 mortuary, The cause of death was
definitely drowning, The body only had a Finnish life jacket and a pair of
swirming trunks on. They later found the motor boat, but the motor was gone
and there was rothing in the boat. Later a Soviet destreyer came to Helsinki
to retrieve the body, It was evidently Golub's responsibility to make ell

of these crrengenents. Golub stated on this evening that he would like to
make a call on the U. S. Consulate sometime. Costille said that he was welcome
at any tine, The next moming Golub. phoned Ccstille to say he would like to
wuxer come over. He arrived carrying a nurber of Soviet visa and other. forms,
He recained in the Ccnsulate for abeut an hour and asked =any questions as

to consular duties and U.S, citizenship. He departed inviting Costille to
pay a sintlor call on hin et the Soviet Consulate. The next day Costille
phoned Golub to ask if ke sight coze over te see the Soviet Consulate. We

alse wanted to introduce to Golub an Enbassy ezployee, Edward Berg, who is

in Helsinki through the sumer fren the U, §, Bubassy in Peris on TOY for the
purpose of helping the Babassy with the nuxber of YIP and other Acerican
tourists ezing to the U.S. fair in Moscow. Since he has alse been handling
sone visa prebiers, we wanted hin te meet Gelub, Golub welcomed Costille

and Serg at the Scviet Consulate eni teok thes inte his office where the three
chatted fer abcut 20 minutes. Costille clso had with hin the vises of tro
Anericcn women whe wented to spend one rere day in the Scviet Union and to

take the train rather than fly. Golub made the necessary ctanges cn their
vieas without a question, At this tine Colub invited Ccstille and erg to

have lunch with Rin on 10 august.
