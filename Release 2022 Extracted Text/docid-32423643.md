Date: November 21, 2022

From: National Archives and Records Administration

Subject: Reconstructed Califano Papers RIF 198-10001-10012

To: The File

This memorandum briefly summarizes the status of missing records in the "Califano Papers"

series in the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection (JFK Collection) and

documents the National Archives and Records Administration's (NARA) efforts to reconstruct or

potentially identify duplicate copies of documents located in the Califano Papers.

According to the JFK Assassination Records Collection database, the Collection includes 16

documents that are part of the Office of the Secretary of the Army series titled "General

Counsel's Files."

NARA cannot locate any documents in the Collection that were transferred as General

Counsel's Files. After an exhaustive search, we have determined the following:

It appears that the Army began indexing these records under the series title "General Counsel's

Files."

At a later date, they determined that these records should be identified as "Califano

Papers." Rather than changing the original metadata, they reentered the metadata for the

documents under the "Califano Papers" series. Sixteen documents were entered twice into the

system, but the hard copies of the documents were transferred to NARA as "Califano Papers."

In almost all instances, NARA successfully identified the original Record Information Form (RIF)

number in the General Counsel's Files and the corresponding RIF number in the Califano

Papers. According to the original General Counsel's Files metadata, RIF 198-10001-10012

consists of two pages of briefing papers or notes prepared by staff for Secretary McNamara's

testimony to the Stennis Committee. After comparing the metadata and existing documents, we

feel confident that RIF 198-10001-10012 corresponds to or is closely related to RIF

198-10004-10025 in the Califano Papers.

The documentation for RIF 198-10001-10012 consists of the original Record Information Form,

an explanatory administrative memorandum, RIF 198-10004-10025 from the Califano Papers,

an agency review sheet, and the two-page document. Although the agency review sheet shows

a handwritten 198-10004-10026 identification number in the upper right corner, the sheet was

numbered incorrectly. The subject description clearly matches RIF 198-10004-10025.

rapidly, in my opinion /if we don't get the Communists

out of Cuba/'.

Prepare a sophisticated analysis of the strengths and

veaknesses and future prospects of communism in Latin

prospects could be influenced by either continuationfof a

Communist government in Cuba

d. "Our evidence is that there is activity going on in Cuba at

an increasing tempo which is directed toward insurgency

operations from Cuba toward Latin American countries,

designed to disturb and overthrow the political regime in

those countries."
