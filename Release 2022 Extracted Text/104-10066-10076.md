1. Ben Colling phoned to say that one of the fellowsin jail
is still around, and after he got out he inquired around and got no
indication that McCord was ever involved. None of the other OTS people
have any recollection of McCord's involvement,

‘the Security man with TSD at the time had a job of hand-yolding with
the families of the three mens there may be some TSD record of that.
which would lead to someone who would Inows

Be Colling was pulled out of a staff meeting to talk to me and

said he would call back later’.
