believe that WINKLER was in fact, the SAO.

The above information is set forth in

Milwaukee

Letter and tid, dated November 25, 1914,

captioned "SAo."

Milwaukee had never developed any positive

link between MINDELL and the SAO, and in view of the

literature found in the possession of WINKLER,

Milwaukce

felt no further investigation was warranted

regarding MANDELL.

1975, Detective ALBERT ROEHLING,

Madison, Misconsin Polica Department, advised that

on October 31, 1914, WhiNeDR had been committed to

the University of visconsin hospital, Madison,

Wisconsin, for psychiatric examination, and has since

been found competent to stand trial ior the above

charges.

He was

subsequently released to the custody

of his parents, Mr. & Hrs. EDWARD WINKLER, Watertown,

trial.

ROELLING stated that the literature found

other information of any individuals who could be connected

to the SAO.

On March S, 19/4, the Madison Police department

received five typewritien

letters from the circulation mana-

ger of the

paper.

These letters were signed SAO.

They advised that

this was a warning against them. The latters stated that

the latest issue of

"Takeover"

lavished praise on the

Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA) and has endorsed Marxist

terror.

The letter stated. that there would be a boycott

by advertisers and that the addressees have no choice in

The letters warned

that the advertisers had until

the next issue to decida. The letters concluded that this

"On June 21, 1973, Jerry Lynn'Davis, former Southern California

Coordinator of the Secret Army Organization was granted probation

as a result of a psychiatric and social study conäucted by the

California/Department of Corrections.

Thus ends the last of the

Watergate implications of Secret Army cases.

Other's are seriously.

concerned with the wrongdoings of those who acted with implied

or explicit authority of the United States Government. These

men remain free.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation informant, Howara Berry

Godfrey, remains free.

At various times and places he aamitted

to a number of major felonies.

These include the following:

possession of illegal explosives

_- these are the explosives.

which Yakopec allegealy used to blow up the Guild Theater and

they are the same explosives which are the basis for davis' i

conviction; detonating incendiary device (admitted at the Yakopec

trial); burglary laamitted

at the Hoover hearings); sale of explosives

(admitted at the Yakopec trial); concealing evidence of a felony

(admitted at the Hoover trial).

Diana!

Mr. Godfrey has admitted these felonies yet he is free.

How can

the District Attorney of San Diego County sleep with his conscience

when this man remains free?

Or, is Mr. Edwin Miller governed by the

Watergate standard of ethics and morality? MI. Godfrey acted for

the best of all possible motices.

He did commit some crimes.

"his aims anâ ideas were good.

Therefore, he should not be

punished for his crimes but shoula, like Mr. Barker and Mr. Hunt,

This Feâeral employee willingly and wantonly violated the

laws of this State.

He knew what he was doing.

Had he advised

the local police of the Tharp shooting, the Guild Theater would

never have been bombed.

Had he not permitted Godfrey to

•possess illegal explosives in his home, the Guild The ter would

never have been bombed.

Without Mr. Christiansen there would

never have been any number of crimes committed in this community.

For the best of all

possible motives, he too possessed a

watergate mentality and justified everything on the basis of

the results. To him, apparently, the "result justifies the

means."

Regaraless

of how much lawbreaking there was.

is not the District Attorney of this county seeking an indictment

âgainst Mr. Christiansen?

Does it. Christiansen claim "exuctive

immunity" as did the Watergate consgiratoss? Was the Feceral

government justified in this sort of illegality and immocality,

how?

The only possibility is that we citizens of this County

and of this National must accept immoral and illegal acts on

the part of our civil servants, justified because they act on

a higher morality than we near mortals. Or, alternatively, we

may pose the question:

How deeply was the United States involved

in the Godfrey-Christiansen conspiracy? Did Godfrey have

permission from the Federal Bureau of Investigation to violate

the law?

Was the Secret Army Organization really an arm of the

SAO was partly organized and financed by Godfrey and that while beir

and burglaries. It sets forth information indicating Donald H.

Segretti had been in the company of SAO members during the Summer o1

1971 and discussed kidnaping "radicals" who might disrupt the

Republican National Convention.

The SAO was formed in san Diego, California, in 1971 by

Jerry Lynn Davis as an anticommunist, paramilitary group to replace

the white extremist Minutemen.

Godfrey, an FBI informant since 196;

was targeted to penetrate the SAO and subsequently became a leader ‹

'this group. He was cautioned, as are all extremist informants, not

to becone directly involved in violent confrontations or activities

We have no information in our files indicating his active participa

Re:

Secret Army Organization (SAO)

157•23577

SAO member who fired shots into the home of a local college professor

active in planning demonstrations at the Republican National Convention

The shots resulted in the wounding of Tharp. Godfrey, in january, 1975

advised SA Steven I. Christensen of the shooting and gave him the gun

used.

Christensen retained this weapon without advising the Bureau of

its existence.

on 7/5/72, after Godfrey was turned over to the

San Diego Police Department in order to obtain prosecution of several

SAO members, the existence of the gun was learned and it was recovered.

SA Christensen, on 7/6/72, after acknowledging receipt of the gun,

submitted his resignation.

Investigation of the SAO and testimony by former informant

Godfrey, Christensen and Special Agents of our San Diego Office during

local prosecution of SAO melibers, were coordinated with the office of

Legal Counsel and Kevin I. Maroney, Deputy Assistant Attorney General,

Internal security Division.

By memorandum from C. I. MC Gowan to MI. R. E. Gebhardt, dat:

6/15/73, captioned "Donald Henry Segretti," you were furnished informa-

tion indicating the "San Diego DOOr," an underground publication, made

inquiry of former SA Christensen regarding attempts by Segretti to

recruit the SAO to work for reelection of the president and that Davis

former SAO leader, stated he had no information regarding alleged

recruitment.

San Diego is being

ORGANIZATION STRUCTURE

On October 8, 1972, JERRY LYNN DAVIS,

leader of

the Secret Army Organization

(SAO) who is generally known

as

SAM DAVIS, advised that the SAO is now "dead" as far as

San Diego is concerned.

(SD T-I, October 8, 1972)

During late October, 1972, JERRY LYNN DAVIS stated

that because of court proceedings against SAO members in

San Diego, California, the SAO has become a defunct

oxganization.

A small pocket of SAO members continue to

exist in Los Angeles, California, and two members remain

Call torna

in the Seattle, Washington, area.

The unaffected elements

may possibly band together but under a different label.

(SD T-1, October 27, 1972)

On January 16, 1973, JERRY LINN DAVIS waS interviewed

by Special Agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)

at San Diego, California. He advised that the SAO is now

no longer active because of the arrests of members in San

Diego and because of the demoralizing effect of learning

that HOWARD BARRY GODFREY was reporting to the FBI concerning

the activities of the SAO and its members.

He said San Diego

had been the headquarters of the SAO.

Both the National

Headquarters and the San Diego Unit of the SAO have ceased

to exist.

The only remaining group of SAO members might

possibly be a small group operating independently in

Los Angeles, California, under a leader who DAVIS would

not identify.

DAVIS said he is completely disenchanted with

right-wing activity and will no longer participate in such

activity.

He intends to cooperate fully with law enforcement

agencies. He complained that when he was arrested recently,

only one or two of his "right-wing friends" stood by him.

He intends to move out of the State of California and live

hut or the vang

in Mississippi where he has relatives.

AT PHOENIX, ARIZONA

The state coordinator of SAO activity at Phoenix,

Arizona, has been instructed to include the state of New

Mexico in recruiting efforts for the SAo.

(SD T-I, May 10, 1972)

In Arizona the SAO has mailed a considerable

amount of literature pertaining to

the SAO to "conservative"

thinking people, but has not at this time received response

from the type of people they wish to affiliate. Consequently,

no formal chapter or nucleus around which to organize has

been formed in Arizona.

However, a coordinator has been

named and is operating. Not all

former Minutemen will be

accepted into the SAO.

The SAO foresees a decentralized type of operation

in each state, where in a revolutionary situation brought

about by treasonous communist elements, the SAo could

present a militant front immediately.

Recent bulletin

material from SAO Headquarters in San Diego has introduced

the thought that "the basic battle facing our country

today is the one between individualism

and collectivism.

In its political form it appears as personal freedom versus

police-state regimentation.....In times of emergency, our

members

are not going

to depend on General Headquarters

for training material, bulletins and printed propaganda

items.

Local units and often the lone individual will

have to improvise all these things.

Communications to

and from higher commands may be uncertain and the transmission

of organization orders may be slow.

We must have people

who think for themselves.

Equally important, we must

have people who

can see

what needs to be done and. get at

it without being told."

When discussing

ecret Army Organization "Comba

ream", we usually think

of a small group of pooole mao live very close to one another. Such an arrangement

has certain advantages, slich as case of communication and travel for collective

training and team operations, but there are also several disadvantages.

- "Among the disadvantages are these: Team members may be well acquainted

with only a small gpographica! arca. I forced to leave this aren the team may be

placed at a serious disadrautoge. I is horder for i team of SO members who

live closely togither to racy from attracting areation, thus unit security may be

poor. If one or cater of ihe toam is ever discovered and arresied by the enemy,

= chances are that all members of the team will be rounded un together.

These considerations have caused us to esperiment with a new arrangemoni that

we refer to as i "Dispersed Team". Such a team hos the same number of members

(usually six) as a regular Cordbai Team. Bac. team is split into wo sections as is

--the old team. The members have the same ipe of individual spcciaities and dudes.

The big difierence lies in the faci that the team mombers may be located over

a comparatively largot area - perhaps as much as 25 to 50 miles in diameior. In

urban areas one team: member may live in each of six dilferent cities. Thus the

teant may range over a fairly large geographical nrea with at icast one team menbcr

being familiar with the immediate territory through which tey are trareling.

When retire es part of an underground movemes: (as opposed to the classical

forras of guerrilla varior) the Dispersed Inam has several other advaniagos.

• For example, if one merahar of the team gets too "hoi" in his area, he automatically

bas five othor bide-ours to which he can go for essistence or to whieh he can sond

his family for temporary safety.

Ine Dispersed Team can conveniently cover a

larger arca in the lolds of recruiting, psycbologicul verfare, and propazarde.

Operations oi saborage, survsillance and horarsinent of communist personnel,

raids, and ocher comoar ipe operations can be suecessiully cordleted while moving

a minimum of people over a minimum distance.

During the present period of deliborate delay the activities of the team wil

naturally be dirterent leom some future period in which all out warfare boteen our

pressue io a sloited ley as shown in Figure No. t.

Explosion of the priner cap alone is not sufficient to de-

Charac-

cris-

ties, uses and manufacture of explosives will be dealt with in

another chapter.

A very simple device can be made from a screen door spring

that will explode an ordinary rifle cartridge when activated by a

trip wise. Although the "explosion" is almost harmless it can be

very nerve racking to an approaching enemy.

A more deadly booby trap consists of a short piece of pipe

which is driven into the ground, & plunger cype trigger rechanism

is dropped into the pipe and

an ordinary rifle cartridge placed

point in in the pipe so that porhaps one-half inch is excosed

above the ground, The weiglit of a man stepping on the bullet

releases dio triggei and fires the cartridge which wiii penetrate

well up into the leg or the body.

Some maunanical triggurs are activated by friction just

like striking & maich on che rough matorial of the match cover.

Figure do. I shows a cut-away drawing of the U.s. Army firing

devies, puil friction type M-2. The coated wire is covezed with .

a skitty substance much like the strip on a book of matches.

When this is palled out through a container of flash compound

(chenically similer to the match heads) the friction ignites the

flash compound which may be used either to lighi a fuse or fire

a blasting cap.

crude üu: effective friction dovice can be prepared by

sticking the end of a fuse in some small cylinder Billed wich

cardioard with a friction strip fron match books glued io both

In fleid use the friction type ignitor can be hidden in

many ways connected with trip wires or attached to movable objects

to set off cither instant or delayed charges.

PeEral, IGNITORS, In some cases the ignitor, (fuse or primer)

can bo used as a trigger mechanism.

for example in lorid War iI

the Germans were known to tear down fireplaces and cement thea

back together with hidden charges that wouid ignite when a fire

was built.

A simple hand grenade or mitar shell hidden in a

hollow log by a burned out fire rould, of couse, explode if the

log' tere used

the projectile of an artillery shell is the only part of any

valuc.

Useful sizes include 75mm, 20mn, 105mm, and 155cm. In

those necillary cells where the prjoctile is attached to the case,

it is senorcily best to renove the projecifle and diccard the case.

Artillery sholl projectiles may be fused eithér in clie nose or

find among your oun acquaintaces many who are tired of talk and who will be glad to find

some construetive action which they can enter into.

AS YOU FORM YOUT OUN GROUP KEEP THESE FACTS IN MIND:

(1) The underground needs all kinds of people, young and old, men and women. Those

who the ener "old never suspoct" can act as

spies and messengers. The underground

needs many difterent things in addition to fighters : sources of supply, lines of commu:-

icutions, a multitale of skills that can be supplied by many differon kinds of people.

(2) To roluntarily star training in the use of arms, especially in the absence of a dir

clared state or car, requires a decy personal conviction thai this must be done now foi

the salvation of ourscives and via' country. If you do not believe this yourself you wil

neror be able to pass the necessary conviction to other members of your group.

(3) 1 smail group that is resolute and dedicated will be more effective than a large

group containing people tal my coubt the importance of their causc.

For a batalliun of men to attack the chemy in the face of gunfire requires courage. Fos

one or tro men to light alone in the dark requires bravery. For the wives of such mea

to spond the night waiting and wondering requires even greaier bravery. These are lie

UTe of people vos MEST colleci bout you,

It is natural for living things do want to keep on living. The kind of bravery we are tal-

ing about is rot something woogie are hom with. It is something that a person musi de-

velop swhin himself. It comes caly foin the absoluie belich that our cause for freedom

is more important that anything else in this world.

Where can you find such people? You lind them among your neighbors; among the people

you work with, among your friends and your relatives.

You might never guess it as jou

move among these people in their daily lives but there are countless numbers of nor-

iccas who share this belief with you.

This does not mean that such people are going to be immediately enthusiastic abolit

forming in underground. Some mas, but others may never have had an opportunity.to

learn the true lets about our nationd and international situation. That's where you

corn in. Ion must do able to ronsince such people that they cannot afford to wait intil

the last minuie before the sel prepared.

fers only to information that is false and misleading. Propaganda refers only to the use

of information to attract people to your way of thinking. Truth is the best possible kind of

propaganda.

Here then are the step-by-slop suggestions on how to go about forming your own group:

I. know the truth. De able to back up your view of the current situation with facts

and referchces.

• 2. Make a list of everyone you know even casually: friends, fellow workers, noigh-

ebors, lodge or church menhers and relatives.

3. Reno: old acquaintances. Got to reaily know these people. Feel them out on

current events, politics, and world aftairs. Let them now where you stand,

1. Do not choose people just because you think they would be willing to join yow

groip. Choose insted those that you want in your group. Remember that if fight-

ing actually starts these people will be closely associaled with you and themselves

for long periods of time. Miminato the braggarts. Pick the quict confident people

that son't get on each other's nerves when the going gots tough.

Aftor you have decided on alist of five to elve people you are ready to give

thom: you soles isli". You can do this with each one individually or you can get

them together as a group for this purpose. If you talk to them singly you can main-

tain a gronic degice of secrecy about other members of the group.

Group discussion has the advantages that each prospect is more likely lo take your

vier poini seriously is he 1s sitting down among other people who seem to be taking;

it seriously also. Since you want be taking up anything too secret during you

first ivo or three moclings. there will be plenty of time to eliminate any doubtfuls,

or more lisely, they will eliminate themselves.

:

G. Whether you talk to your prospective group members singly or as a group: your

first discussion should convince them of these things:

a. That the fee world is losing the cold war against communism.

be. That as things are now going we will keep right on losing and that sooner or.

later americans may be forced to defond their oun property.and their own

families by wintever means are still available to them.

∞ c. That your small glod indy not be able to do anything to change this situation

but in any dress you should get top tor regularly for at least i few meetings

do cramine any posibilitics that may exist.

d. Le willing to acuit that things may not actually be as bad as you belicio but

get you prospectise coup incincts to al least admit that they owe it to their

colora lo decover the tois.

People who arc

sympathetic do your cause ad willing to help in their own way although they should

know no more about four members or operations than necessary to gain their coopera-

lion. They will turn an auxiliary force to work with the individun group member who is

responsible for their special iciivity.

The group leader, il'he is to successfully maintain his position must by one means or

another make certain that all sis of these activities are provided for.

ORGANiZATION:

she organization of the group is primarily the responsibility of the group leader. Ic

must intervie, personally each now prospoctire member and make certain that thoy are

suitable material. This means more than simply being loyal to the United Siates. The

prespective member must be unpressed with the fact that he is undertaking a grave

resporciate to must be made io undersiand thet even though he has joined the group

on "Tish" zather than from complete Inowledge of its overall activity: that withdrawing

froin the croug will noi be easy and that if he should in the future withdraw from the

group thet he sali ever alter be considered as suspect by the other group members.

The

prospecuse grotp member must be a type that will get along well with other people.

12 must noi be & hraggart or a show-off. Under no circumstances must he become in-

toxicated or loose-mouthed. ie must be a willing worker and ready to assume his share

of the lo.r.

The group leader shodd determine the skilis and interest of his members. He should

talk orea iith them ie caricus tasks thai need to be performed and ask for volunteers

until cach icember has a responsibility that they are intcrested in and that they are

capable ri fufiling. Since inembership in the organization is essentially voluntary the

group leader cannot force any member to porform any activity against his will and

slould not attempt to do so.

When a member assumes responsibility for a certain field

of activity he must realize that he will be expected to fulfill shat task successfuly ie-

gardices of any other conditions that may arise. If a nicher is unwilling to assume

responsibility on this basis, he should be given another responsibility that better fits

his copabilities or should be gracofilly eased out of the organization.

INTELLIGRICK:

Intolligenee meludes all types of iformation that may be of value at either the national

or locol level. Scraps and bits ef information that may scem of little value alonc nay

eventually tit into pattern that will someday provide important information for cither

defensire os odeneiro activil, either propaganda or opon warfaro.

The group member in charge of intelligonce should enlist the assistance of several

am-embolant to help gather this information. One of dief esc

should road all

A aclivities to guard against

communist infiltration in these areas. A reading and study group should be set up lo

study schoot textbooks and teaching methods in your arca for colleetivist-socialisi-

comminist sianting.

An auxillary member should carofully evaluate all of the "Lotters to the Editor" that

appear in various papers in the area. Those who express especially patriotic senti-

ments and those who an outspoken in their defense of the merican constitution and

way of life shoutd he truand pics to the recruiting officer who can contact then as puier-

ti: mambo's or auxilary members. Those who advocate collectivism in any form shou!

be turned over to the sectrity officer who can look up their full names, addresses, eic..

and file them away among the potential turncoals.

The inteiligence viticer should evaluate ali the information sent to him by his auviliary

members to detormine the sentiments of people in his area especially those in politics

or in a position in intuence other people. He should pass on to the regional headquarters

any informition that involves national or international figures or organizations where in

turn it will be complied with other information and sent on to the national headquarters.

SECURITY:

The security officer mustbe responsible for secrecy within the group and about the

group. We have lourned that those members whose memborship or identity becomes

krown will in all probability be subject to abuse and harrassment from the libcrals

and conmusisis. Themlore; one major duty of the security officer is to prevon: the

identity of the groug's dota members from becoming lown.

He should also review from time to time the methods of communications between member-

of the group. He should insure the secrecy of the mecting places and the training sites.

He should arrange for at least two of more secrat addresses for receipt and delivert oi

mail hetween grcups and

particularly the regional coordinaior. He shoudd be carcivi

that the amount of mail, frequency of meetings, number of parked cars and similar eir-

cumstances. do not cras attention to the group or its activities.

One of the sectity officers most important projects is to arrange for a number of "sale

houses". These are people iothin city and rural arcas who have no contact with group

member's at all and who are quite ordinary in their daily life and yet have a strong syni-

pathy for the organization. They must be willing to care for wounded members or pro-

vide niding places for group members that have been discovered by the choniy. if the

communists litie over this country from within it is quite possible that the underground

J'ROPAGANDA:

"Until such time as fighting mig

ctually break out we must especi

engage in a con-

tinuous propaganda wartare against the communists, communist sympathizers and dupes

within our borders. Our ultimate victory or defeat. may depend on the outeome of the

propaganda battles that we are fighting right now.

By planted newspaper articles and by slanted programs over radio and TV the enemy is

cren now trying to "sinear" us out pi existence. They are also starting an all-out cam-

paign to outlaw the use and ownership of firearms by civilians.

During the cold war period the propagenda officer should act as a public relations man

for the organization in his locality.

It is important that this individual make a good per-

sonal appearance and be able to speak and write well. Without actually admitting that

ho is a member of the orgunization, he can still contact various news media, television,

cle, and ast thom to find out the true facts ahout the organization before blindly to-

peating half truths and insinuations that come ovei the wire services or that they read

In other papers and maguzines..

Whenever loend popors cars articles detrimental to the organization, he should har

all menbers, auxillory members, their friends, rclatives, and associated groups food

that paper, radio or TV station as the case inay be with both signed and unsigned letter's

demanding a retraction.

In cases where some particular news media makos a habit of slandering the organizalion

or' when some particular nows commentaior or TV persomlity does so repeatedly, then

the organization should write repeaterly to the companies that place advertising with

them to domand a retraction.

Articles or comments which are aclually libelous should be forwarded to the regional

headquarters for investigation and the possibility of law suits against the offending per-

The propagande officer should prepara himself to speak publicly and showd arrange lo

give talke to various civic organizations ou the importance of tie citizen's right to self

defense.

RECRUITING:

The recruiting officer should discuss with other' members of the group what additional

shills are nooded and with their help should attempt to enlist the assistanee of people

who hure such skills. He should cooperate with the security olficer to delermine wiether

or not prospective members are loyal to their coutry and have ideals in leeping with

our organization. He should recrire from the intelligence officer names of prospective

membera d associates and contact them to cvaluate their possible uscfulness lo the

group, If new groups do new group members are accruited through advertising, he

should work with the propagands officer to propare efiective material. A recruiting

Together with the secu

officer he should attempt to find

printer locally who will

supply the group with literature on an absolutely confidential basis. All of the oiher

members of the group should be contacted by the recruiting officer and passed on by the

security officer after checking an y information lnown about the prospective member with

the intelligece officer.

MEDICAL:

This man may he i ductor or one skilled in first aid. In the latter case, he should make

contact with a physician who will work with the group to provide necessary drugs, medi-

cal supplies and confidentiai assistance in time of need.

This member will also be respunsible for obtaining medical supplies and keoping adequal

rescives ca hand. Ho should give consideration to the general health of all group mem-

bers and should encourage each member lo maintain a maximum degice of physical

fimess for cir' age and circumstances. A medical officer should make all group mem-

bors keep on hand a large amount of special rugs or medicine each member must for

his boath.

CONDONICATIONS:

This member of the group should have or obtain a working knowledge of all radio equip-

ment, field telephone, codes and signals. If he is not an amatues ranio operator himself.

he should work with the scoruiting officer to enlist the aid of onc or more amalear ¿adio

operators citter as group members or as associales. He should be responsible for pass

words and other words of identifying frichly supporters. Ic should arrange suitable

code phrases by wrich esscutial information can be given over the iclephone between group

mombers without giving it away in case the phone is tapped.

ARMANENT AND DEMOLITION:

The armanent officer, with the assistance of other group members should see that

all of the groups cquipment is sale to use and kept in good repair. lle should have sui-

Ticient knowledge of firearms and weapons to instruct other members in their use and

maintenance.

He may designate other members to become specialists in certain types

of weapous and so forth.

Al least one group member should make him self an expert in the use of all typos of

explosives, body traps, time fuses, and similar material. In cooporation with the

armament officer and other group members he should dotermine both immediate and

funds neods and sources ofauch maicrials along with means to obtain such items and

a also the raw materials from which these items can be quickly manufactured.

SUPPLIES:

The supply officer should keep in mind thet the organization has no legal status excopt

stried as raising an army which would be a violation of the law.

A

sugh ho may coor-

dinute the stock piling or obtaining of material, it must be clearly underslood by all that

each individual item is owned ly some individual member. The supply officer is pri-

marily responsible for the storage of reserve materials.

Each group should prepare a number of escape and crasion kits. These showd be of

thrce types:

1:

A very small kit which cach member can carry on his person.

2. A suitcase size kit that can be liept in the car or home at all times.

3. An inexponsive lit that can be buried at strategie places or hidden in other

strategic localities.

The training schedule may be arranged for by the group leader or he may elect to

assign this responsibilily to a training specialist. In either case an inventory should

be made of the various stilis, talents, and kowledge of each member. All members

should discuss logother the thrity different paris of the initial training program. They

shold diade those sections up among thosloves so that some member can road and

siudy caci subject prior io the training session and be prepared to instruct the other

members in his oin speciality.

FIXANGES:

Although the individual group members must be self sustaining

as far as their individual

equipment is concerned, there will be many expenses that must be met collectively. To

fight the propaganda war requires printing, postage, trarel, and so forth. Although the

individuai group members may be able to meet this espense to a minimum degree they

will not in most cases ba able to finance the maximun effert that is required. The fin-

ance officer should thercfore consult with the other group members as to means of rais-

ing additional money. One possible source will be from peopic who will agree with the

aims of the organizatich in theory but who are unwilling or unable to take an active

part in the program. Such people may be willing to set up a serics of regular monthly

contributons to hely finance our fight against communism.

In small groups one member may have to doubie up ou tiro of these duties. In Jarger

groups, the division of responsibility may he spread. among a greater number of indi-

viduals did still other duties may be assigned to individual members,

The important thiag is to modi regularly and discuss your mutual problems. If euch

meither has a job he is interested in and leeps busy it, morale wid stay high and you

will really set trings done. Without such team work the group members will soon lose

interest and becoie discomraged..

There are i great many wogs in which women can be a valuable aid to the group cither

as members or assoc

as. Each group should obtain by

means the part time service

of one os more secretaries who can type up literature to be printed, articles to the

newspapers, communications betwech groups and so on. Much of the intelligence work

can be hundled by women. Thcy can assist the propaganda effort by handing out litera-

ture, giving talks to women's clubs, PIA associations and so forth.

It is felt that it would be a mistake to sot down hard and fast rules for the group's con-

duct and activities. To do so would run the risk of making each group a carbon copy of

every uli.cr group and possibly of stiling individual ingenuity. One of the greaiest ac-

vantages that an underground has is the simple fact that the enemy never knows what he

Is up against.

'Thie group leader must costinually merit the respect and confidence of his members. This

respect is the only incans ho has of maintaining discipline. Before taking any action,

all members of the group should hare an opportunity to voice their opinions. But it must

he mutually understeod that when the discussion is over, the group leader must make the

final decision. His decision must be compiied with and in return for the compliance, he

must bear responsibility for the groups ultimate failure or success.

Past experience has shown that the successful underground leader: must possess certain

minimal qualifications:

1. He must have a strong personal conviction as to the righteousness of the cause

- 1or which he is Oguting.

2. He must have the ability to infuse other members of his group with this same

conviction.

3, Ile must be able to exercise effective command orer his group through personal .

loyally and political enthusiasm when no other means of discipline are avaluble.

10

He must be able to keep secrets and organize cven quite important actions so

that as few people as possible lalow his plans.

5. He should be a born conspiralor, capable of decciving not only the enemy but

even his members of his own group if this is necessary to insure absolute security.

6. He must be able to act inventively and imaginatively so as to constantly seize

the initiative away from the enemy.

%. He showd hare risen to his position of leadership through his own abilities and

execution.

S. He should he physically vigorous and self-denying so that he can accommodate

himself to primitive surroundings.

9. He should have no addictions or strong habits that might distract him it some

crucial municat.

10. He must have the bulldog tenacity to seo that important tasks are completed

no maller what difficuities or obstacles may be placed in his path.

11, He must have the patience to remain inaclive when such is the best course and to

wait for exachly the right time to strike.

12, He must have the moral courage to accept full responsibility for his own actions

and those of his group.

You should think these requirements over carefully. How do you measure up? I's best

if,we aumil our weak suots to ourselves and start now to sirengthen ourscives for the

trials ahead. With advance preparation, seli-discipline and a firm resolve we eau meet

the test.

The human roce is much inclined to wishfud lunking. Even though the communist have

lold is that they will never rest until they have conqured the whole worid, most people wil

no allow themselves to even consider this possibility. as war clouds gather on the horizon,

most peopie focus their attention all the more on other things and hope that if they just

ignore the threat of war it will sonchow disappear.

When the time for underground warfare suddenly comes there will be a hundred civilians

wanting to fight for every one that is trained or equipped to do so. Under these conditions

each member of ou on ganization and similar groups that are making ready for this

emergency will sureiy ind himself acting as leadce of an underground group. As & pari

of your seif-training it is thus recessary to give some thought as to how you can quickly

train new recruits, how you can maintain discipline and security. In short, you must give

some serious advance thought as to your own abilities and possible short-comings as an

underground loader.

Depending on the methed of manufacture ammonium nitrate may occur as inregular

Erals, fakes, small crystals or so ail round "prills". Any of those types can be raci

but prided an atonium nitrole is most eficient. J'ortunatoly, the prilled type is also

the most common.

Explosive mixtures may be mede by mixing antonium nitrate with such organic

compounde as fudl oil, powerca cool, lamp black, eir.

Its quite possible that powered

sugar, starea, and nihy similar compounds could also be used but further osperimen:-

Several other factors effect the efficioney of AN-TO (ammonium

nitrate-lucl oil)

mixture's.

Among these are the amount of explosive used in a single charge, degree

of confinemen, moisture content, particle sire temperature, etc.

AN-FO mixtures are commonly used in mining rock or ore from large open pits.

In this application, holes are drilled back into the rock and the 1N-FO misture is poured

into the holes. Normally, the ammonium nitrate and the luel oil are carrica separately

to the mine and are mixed together just before they are used. The holes into which the

AN-FO mixitro is poucer are usualiy several icet long. In this case the diameter of the

hole has considerable effost on the caplosive lonce generated. A hole diamcier less than

three inches will not explode with suiticiont force to carry itscli along the bore hole. The

• maximum detonation velocity reonires that the hore hole be at least six inches diameter.

In using smaller amounts oi AN-FO mixtures the charge should be kept approximately

equal in is length, want

and depth, In practical application a container about the -ize

Suppose the objective was to destroy a large briage. A dozen five gallon cans of

should be provided with its own primer and all the primers should be lied together with

do lengths of prima cord.

Moisture content of the ammonium nitrate is very important. This chemical absorbs

should cocain to more than 12 water and if the moisture content exceuds To it may not

Before the organization can even bogin to issue counter-propaganda, or

the actual cells, etc. Ground work information is available io evaryone through the

The question of lotting for a mecting must be thoroughly planned. It is particularly

important that underground members know how in lease their homes quite naturally at

both a rcasonble and required lime, how to explain their visits to certain public places,

and how in make tneir "spot checks" along the route. The continuity and regularity of

underground commications depend on such planning.

Daponding on conditions, one should start for a meeting well ahead of time. Onc

musi check along the stipulated route to detect any sucreillance by counter-intelligence

personnel. I surveilance is dotceted, one must carry out his cover rcason for leaving,

then return to the point of departure to attempt to make another secure departure.

Recommendations For The Conduct Of SAO Officers

Engaged In Personal Comminications

Conduel of a meeiig is the basic phase of resistance operations. Mectings play

an impert: role in the iraining of the individual resistance member.

Therefore they

shouli be conducied in & precise, well-planned manner, with a thorough knowledge of

the case and paying artention to all circumstances. During the meeting the officer must

not oniy describe the oider of the meeting with the member and the cover story lor the

necting, perior the instructions for the alicate meeting, hear the member's report,

and assign him iastes, but he must also instruct him in various mattors, lister to his

questions, and give him competent answers. The officer must take a constant interest

in the member's personal affairs and situation so that the member can be cautioned in

advance, if neat be, about possible errors in his conduet.

Because mootings should not be too longihy, the officer musi be well prepared for

each meeting. During the meeting he must be alert to caich the most fleeting changes

in the member's mood.

To a large estent, an otricer's authority depends on his con-

duel, his discussion of operational matters, the ability in conceal the fatigue which he

might be fecling after a long irip and many security chocks. Nor should he show any

nerrousness, whaterer the external reusons might be. If the offieer exhibits stability

and self-control, the member will acquire confidence in working with our organization.

The conduct of an officer bears dircotly on his work with members. The people

with whom the officer comes in contact must be convinced that all this actions and his

bearing are determined he his job, by the nature of his persoual life, and is his cultura!

i choose meeting places, dend us

s, and locations for

pusting signals, and lo select and confirm routes along which cheers can be made for

surveilance.

It he detects surveilance, the olticer must act according to a previougly

conceived cover plan.

It would be helpful if an underground inciher could give the impression that he is

fond of taking walls about the cil!.

At the same time, he must try to learn the methods

of suicilance, in oeder not io seor his faniliarity with the modus operandi of encuy

counter-inteiligence person.cl.

Similarly, an underground member who is uncier sur

veilance must set exhibi: nectanoness oi do anything which is unnatural.

Every SAO officer who hamiles other members must have previously selected and

well-learned routes which afford the most favorable opportunitics for the detection of

surveilance.

A chech route may include travel by autobile (which can then be parked on a side

atroci or in some city garage, the use of uncrowded stroets, especially in those areas

where arabel surveilance is impossible; travel by subway or bus with severai tans'urs

al quite stations; visits to large stores and other buildings with numerous entrances and

exits. At the sume time that such routes are being selected, a good cover story should

also be developed so esplain tre undorground member's presence in a certain area.

When difterent members of a resistance movement meet each other for the first time,

the identity of each should be confirmed by prearranged signs and countersigns. The best

sign is a question, ond the countersign, the answer to the question.

Both sigu and coumi-

cisign have prodctormined "caus or phrases.

These predetermined sords cas be the

names of people,

movies, libraries, neuspapers, magazines, eic.

Both the question

and the marcy must be short and simple in content and in pronunciation.

In arranging for a recognition meeting and, above all, for the recognition sigus and

countersigns, the resistance officer has sufficient opportunity to exhibit his resourcefui

ness, initiative, and creativity, and to solve all problems with originality and with due

consideration to local conditions.

Communications Through Cut-Outs And Live Drops

In indiridual cases it becomos necessary lo resort to cut-outs and live drogs as a

moans of errangio, communicitiolis. In each operation, the unit leader very earcfully

2. IMPERSONAL COMNILNICATIONS

Under the complex operating conditions that will confront any resistance movement in

the. Unitod States, most communications will be by indirect methods. Experience has

shown tha; this is the most secure type of communication, beczuse there in no direct con-

tact between members,

Impersonal communication is used to pass operational materials, to assign missiors,

and to pass material (tecnnical supplies), to the unit leader and individual member.

The basic forms of impersonal communications are radio communications, dead drops;

postal-telegraph systems, telephone, press, und communications via signals.

Radão Communications

Untrashortware fülify radio sets may be used for communications under some condit-

• ions. These sets greatly improve the efficiency of undergiound communications.

They

have a small operating radius. Nevertheless, while on the air, accidental or intentional

radio monitoring is possible; and the resistance movement cannol afford to ignore this

coasideration,

The use of specially devised codes, ciphers, signal system, and operating

schedule, makus the use of this set complerly secure, Radio communications can be used

to call members together for an emergency meeting, to inform a member when a dead drop

hus been loaded or unloaded, to notify him about a change in dend drops, etc.

UlF radio

Dead-Drop Communications

Dead drops may be extens

"lised for com mnications with

an underground noisork.

The use of dead drops in communications with members has several adrantages over per-

sonal meetings. Some of those advaniages are:

1. Doad drop communications are safer as licie is no direct contact botween officer

and member.

Z. They are more secure, because the member need not know the officer with whom

he is in contact via the dend drop.

3. When necessars: it is possible to replace or substitute one officer with another.

*1. There is the possibility of wide flexibility in time.

The use of dead drops, however, is not without drawbacks. The dead drop is a

intermerinte links hotween the officer and member, and materials placed in a dead dio!

are outside their entrol for a certain longu of time. Therefore we must reduce to a

minimum the length of lime during which materials are located in a dead drop.

In psactice, stationary, portable, and mobile dead drops are used. Stationary dead

drops are selected ca specially prepared in parks and squares, in trees, in the ground,

in feuces, in benches, in monumenis, in public buildings, and beyond populated places

such as foresis, fields, seashores, riverbanks, etc.

In selecting and preparing a dend drop in a park, one must bear in mind that squirrels

or other animals can destroy the rond drop (especially in holio: trees) or carry the mossage

off. As a rule, a dead drop is used only one time,

atter which a different one is used. It

is preferable to adopi a system consisting of a verias of dead drops for each member. Oue

should work out a schedule for using doad drops so that the member will know the dend drop

1o be used in dandato, the one to be used in Ecbrunis, etc. The schedule can be propared

for a half yeas or for a full year, depending on the lumber arailaole.

The use of portable doad drous is more worthy of consideration because it is consider-

ably easier io find places for them. We have no particulai ditficulty in finding places that

contain many discarded objects (boxes, tubes, boliles, cans, match boxes, cigarcite packs,

papers, cie.). Oiten these objects lie about in plain sight for long periods of time without

arousing any interest. Among such objects, which are of no ise to anybody, and which.cam

be found in vards, in parks, etc., an underground ofticer can leave a similar objeet with

material for a member concealed in it at a preselecied place to have it picked up later y

the member.

• Americun houschold articles, medicines, and many other items are packaged in ali

kinds of boxes, cans, tobes, cases, and made of cardhoard, melal and plastic. flenee

there is an extremely wide selection of packages which can he used as poriable doad drop.

Among the dema winch can be used as portable dend cops and which can he propared in

advanco are picces of unod, stone, brick, clay, coment, plastic, and others.

inte the terminal there.

In communications through a dead drop the member receives his assignments in

written form. These member assignments must be cocoded or enciphered. Also, the

material itself nilst be in a form suitable for pussing through a dead drop. Therefore

we must train the underground member in the use of ciphers, codes, the preparation

of soft emulsion film, microdot, and secret writing.

The types of signals and the places for posting them in connection with dead drop

communications are the same as those wich were discussed in the section on personal

mectings. Here we need only to emphasize the particular importance and convenience

of radio in exchanging signals.

several hours bofore the operation (no later than two hours) the officer travels to

the city.

He uses the time available for & thorough check to determine whether or not

he is under surveilance. At ihe same time, he checks a prearranged place to see if a

danger signal has been posted.

As a rule, the choc!: for a danger signal is made in an

area oer than the area where the dead drop is located.

Having dotermined that he is not under surreilance and that there is no danger signal,

the officer goes to the dead drop. In the immediate vicinity of the doad drop ho must

once more confrm that conditions are right; then, without losing any time, so to the

dead drop, load (unload) it, and proceed on the prescribed course.

Ou his return irip the rosistance officer can place his signal that the dead drop has

boon louded aulnaded). Those same rules hold true for individual members ingaged in

using dead drop communications.

The Clandestine Use Of Postal,

Telegraph And Telephone Systems

•The postal and telegraph system are inost valuable in the sending of concealed under-

ground massages. Secist messages must in no way differ from an urdinary letter, either

in superficant appearance or in their overt contents. When making clandestine use of the

postal und leiegraph system to send organizational mossages, members of tie resistarce

morement must make full use of ciphers, codes, secret sriting, and other means of

concealing the message being sent.

The most convenient telephones for an underground member te lse are those located

in large department stores, train or bus stations, crugatores and outside pay phones.

By moans of inocent sounding code words it is possible to use a underground member's

phone even sion it's loped.

He ermple, mue member could call nother mombor it

Do within the contost of the conversation.

Experionce shows that individual members not infrequently forget the communications

arrangements, zesulting in a brenk of the work routine. It is, therefore, advisable to

check periodically the member's knouledge of indivicual parts of the communications system,

including code words and their meaning.

If the unit officer plans to use a telophone when organizing a communications network,

he reust give : rious consideration to the use of cui-out telephones. As a rulo, a cut-out

telephone is called from a publie tolophone.

such conversations ar. in code and should

correspond in the cut-ou telophone owner's work so that they will not vary in the least fron!

the owner's dails teleplione conversations.

Signals can be given over the telephone ( by

voice or by rinse). In transmitting signals over the telephone, we must pay attention to

the time set for the signal; the time of das, code phrases, and the number of rings should

be changed frequently.

The Use Of The Press As A Sigmiing Systein

The United States has about two thousand daily neuspapers with a circulation of abo.it

fifty-seven million, and more than seven thousand magazines. Most give considerable

space io adrertisements and all kinds of announcements.

Many advertisements can be adapted quite casily to the transmitlal of incormation.

Among the code words which can be used arc: the names or description of a lost article:

a discelption of the circumstanoes; the place and time lost; the size of the raward offered

for ila return, etc.

In arranging communications insolving the use of the press, it is necessary to specity

the purticular rowspaper or magazine in which the coded intolligence information will sppsur,

the approximate dale uf publication, anc the form of the correspondence (advertisemont or

anneancenient).

The Use O: Signals

as i rule, signaling plays an auxiliary role in organizing communications. When

using dear drops and when holding personal meetings and recognition meetings, under-

ground members use signaling a great deal.

Signals should be varied as much as possible. We must make sure that the signals

are natural and do not attract the attention of in outsider. They must be sufficiently cloas

and precise to preclude any misinterprciation.

a Numbers can exchange signals at a distance while in sight of each other. Various

obicers mu be used lor tbis (handkerchiofs, gloves, cigarettes, ete.) as well as certain

coint of clothing and othor means.

For earmple, if a membed on foolinout duty rentered

his jackel, it could serve as a warning to othor's engaged in an assignment or raid.

Lastly, sound signals can be sent by radio or telephone.

Thus,

signals can be sublinided imo graphie, object, light, sound, and personal signals.

Graphic signals are prearranged marks in the form of geometric figures, letters,

lines, ciphers, ete., written in percil, chalk, or some other sharp object in a specific,

prearranged place or way.

Obicut signals are vrious small objects put in a specific, prearranged place. The

object itself may serve as a signal: us can its position; or the object and its position to-

gether may be a signal.

A thorough studs of the specific features of the local conditions enables one to scioci

the most natural signals. Signals can also be made by sending the underground member

books, magazines, or merchandise from self-service stores (markets) where it is the

practice to deliver these things to the home.

A lurge variety of signals allows great diversification in the use of signals and pre-

vents pattorns..

Certain signals (graphic and objeci) are used with dead drops; others

(light signals, and sound signals tensmited by phone or radio) are used to call a member

for a meeting and to warn of danger.

The third group (siguals given by radio and signals

given through the mails or pross) is used for communicating with the commands IQ or wit

members living in another city.

Thus, the selcetion of signals and the methods for their transmission depends on the

circumstances, the assignment, and the operational situation.

There are three principle types of direct communications that can be used between a

' unit lender and his rarious members: radio communications, courier communications,

and commmications through the use of the postal-telegraph system. A brief description

of cact lype follows:

i-or-miss sabotage is noù nearly

as effective as coordin-

ated sabotage that sirikes systematically at some few essential

industries of activities vital. to the enemy at that particular tina.

42. Targets for raids and sabotage must be carefully selected to

achicve maximum danage to the cheny with loast risk to the guerrilla

band. If the enemy has an abundance of guns but is low on aurunition

then buning a varchouse full of guns will not count

burning a warehouse full of ammunicion would ba a vital blow.

43. Each military action against the enemy must be planned in such

a manner that the ancunt of ammunition and supplios capturad are at

totally unexpected manner he can continuously catch the enouy in a

47. Guerrilla forces must remain widaly dispersed throughout the

entire area of enemy occupation. They must novar accumulate in large

numbers in a given area that the enemy can surround and eventually

starve them out or gradually close in on them.

48. Guerrilla forces must be always alert to possible anti-

Re:

Secret Army Organization (SAO);

Tax Rebellion Committee (TEC)

With respect to the National Association to. Keep and Bear

Arms referred to in referenced airtel, you should through established

scarces discreetly ascertain nature of its activities, identities of

its officers, relationship with SAD cr other extremist groups, and

any other pertinent information which will assist in making a

determina-

tion as to whether an extremist-type investigation should be initiated.

Expedite and furnish IJIliQ your reconmendation in this regaid.

Sacramento and Los Angeles review indices and conduct a

discreet inquiry through established soirces to identify Faverend Cail

mentioned on Page 3 of referenced airtel. Los Angeles make a

recommendation as to whether

active investigation should be conducted.

San Diego conduct necessary investigation to identify

INFORMANT

and determine the extent of his

involvement in extremist activity. It is noted Calvin Hendell fox,

Bufile 157-2033, SDfile 157-3170, is a known associate of the SAO.

- .

NOTE:

The TRC is an organization ostensibly designed to challenge

taxation and embargass the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Limited

investigation to date suggests the possible involvement or influence

of the extremist SAO, Minutemen organization, and a group calling

itself National Association to Keep and Bear Arms on the TRC and/or

its nembership. Gillings, 41-year-old male Caucasian who operates

a service station in Iracy, California, has been involved with the

IRC and has stated the country is on the verge of collapse and some

people in the movement were planning to assassinate the President,

Vice President, and others of "leftist tendencies." Gillings is also

being investigated in a Threat Against the President matter.

NOTE

Calvin Hendell Fox in May, 1972, was identified by former

Bureau informant Howard Barry Godfrey as one of the most rabid and

violent new members of the paramilitary, ultraconservative, anti-

*communist SO. Godfrey furnished information that soon after the

attempted assassination of Presidential candidate George Wallace, Fox

indicated he was going to Washington, D. C., to do some demonstrating

of his own. Investigation to develop background information and the

license number of Pox's autonobile. resulted in SA Arthur J. Hooper

and former SA Steven L. Christensen making inquiry at Fox's service

station where an employee of: Fox's looke through Fox's file cabinet

in a futile attenpt to find the license number of Fox's automobile.

As indicated above,

Fox, during testinony in the trial of Willian

Francis Yakopec, alleged the FBI had planted a document in his personal

files on 5/18/72. Fox, because of his testimony, has been indicted

for perjury. Testimony by SA Hooper, during the

Yakopec trial, and

testinony by For's forter employee, Gregory 1. Pitnan, refuted

Fox's

allegation.

This matter has been coordirated with SA James L. Williamso

of the Office of Legal. Counsel.

Report by MaRANT

Palruary 1, 1975

SUBJECT: Fon Eddy; George Mitchell Hoover.

It has been ascertained that at this time Ron Eddy of Poway

is not interested in trying to form or lead any type of security force

for any right-wing extremist group. When asked by James K. Warner

01 Los Angeles (via Dennis LOSO of Escondido) if he would do this,

Eddy stated that he would llke to see the formation of a security

Force with teeth in lt but does not consider himself to be enough

of a leader to do it himsell.

While declining to lead a Security Force, Eddy did say thai

the only way to stop fBI infiltration of rightist groups would be

sox one of the infiltrators to "wind up in the river" someday. Eddy

is positive that Iom Knight's San Diego unit of the Nazi Party has

a regular FBI infiltrator. The only three men of whom he is not. eus

picious are Mickey Walefield, Ray Wilson and Gerald Smith. Said Eddy,

"Those three men aropped out of the thing and so I figure they're okay

bựt you can bet that the fink is still in there pushing".

Ioso said that the whereabouts of people like Barry Godfrey

should be leared and they should be telephoned and intimidated.

Eddy said he thinks such intimidations would be a waste of time and

that people like Godfrey should

be killed. Mickey Wakefield of San

Marcos went along with iday's suggestion. Ron Eddy also mentioned

having had an encounter with an FBI agent named Peterson in San Diego

but did not elaborate.

Eddy firmly believes that any man who commits himself to one

organization in the Far Right should not be involved with others.

He says he would be very suspicious of anyone mho is. He is also

somewhat suspicious of Tom Knight. He says that Joe Brinker gave

Knight the name of a man interested in Nazism and two weeks later

the FBI interviered the man. Also, Eddy wonders how Knight

saved

his federal job in the face of his continued Nazi activities. Eddy

Leels that any regular rightiet extremist who stays on with the fazi

Party now ruut warrant heavy suspicion of being an ill informant.

On Friday night, January 31, 1975 Fon Eidy net Tom Metzger Of

Fallbrook for the first time. letzger shower judy some pictures and

slides of lew Christian Crusade activities aud the two seemed to hit

it off pretty well. Metzger told Eddy, Wakerield and loso of a viait

he received at his home on January 17, 1975 from agents of the Istemal

George Mitchell Hoover

Here is one last bit of information. The New Christian Crusade

people are very concerned about the imprisonment of George Hoover of

the Secret army Organization.

At one of their banquets the NCC had

four unoccupied places set at the table which were in honor of four

men whom they hold to be absent heroes. These four men were Joe Mccar

George Hoover, Charles Lindbergh and a man named R. Miles.

Anyway, it has been learned that a man whom lom Metzger knows

¿s going to take a dossier of the Hoover case to some congressran

In Washington, D.C. who is part of a committee currently scheduled

• to investigate the FBI. The dossier consists of newspaper clippings

and other material pertaining to Hoover's activities in the SAO, his

arrest, conviction, appeal, etc. They are hoping to stir up a big

publicity stink to give the FBI a bad name due to Barry Godfrey's

activities and in so doing hope to effect an eventual release of Hoove:

{rom

¡Prison. By the way, the He people do not refer to Hoover by.

his correct name. For some reason they all call him Mickey Hoover.

That is about all for now. I hope this will be of some nelp

SUBJEOTS: NO pic'se

sorder; thoughts on NCS; Wei

ounds.

Here is some more Infornation regarding the lational Christian Crusade picked

which took place it the U.S.-'axico border in San Isidro on December 8, 1974. CE

the 16 men who took part in this uniformed picket, 10 were from the San Diego area

and 6 vere from los ingeles. It was nistakenly stated in yesterday's report on this.

• demonstration that 10 of the men were identified. In reality, 11 were fully identica.

1 partially identified, and 4 unidentified. The 4 unidertified were all from L...

• Also, the members of this picket were divided into tvo contingents, los ingeles

and San Diego. Commanding the San Diego group was Tom letzger of Fallbrook and in

charge of the Lai, men was Rick Norton. Also, Norton was in overall command of the

operation.

Two other things which were not mentioned in the earlier report are as ¿ollons.

First, orton told his ten that if attacked, they should form into a back to back

square and "let her rio". Also, after the conclusion of the deronstration, fortor.

conducted a very brief prayer.

As to my thoughts on the iCC, I feel that this group has the potentiel to

comrand much more support from a broader base of people than most of the righting

extremist groups. It

seens significant to this informant thet men like Vic dalton

and Bill Miller would actually get up the nerve to take to the streets in unifor

a thing they never did for the Nazi Party although both supported it.

It is also soteworthy that the iCe was able to draw supporters from so many

other extremist groups. Taking part in this demonstration were elements fron the

Nazi Party, the lar Rebellion Connittee, the National States Rights Party, the MinistI.

of Christ Church and the old Secret irmy Organization.

Also, this group does not automatically get adverse responses fron the public

In the streets. Indeed, many fassersby indicated their support for the group's airs

In the demonstration of the Sth. The leadership is more intelligent and more

approachable than that of groups Ilke the NSWPP or MCC. They more easily establict

& good rapport with the public in general and are not so blunt in stating their racier.

Jul

1974

PCT: Posse

Conitatus.

During the last two years this informant has spent a great deal

ime studying the tactics, personalities and stated goals of both

National Socialist White People's Farty and the Ministry of Christ

ich. Until recently I considered the liSiPP to be more of a threat

he security of peace and law in the United States than the Nce but

events of recent months have caused me to change my view of these

groups about 180 degrees. I now regard the tich to be a far greater

sce than the is'fp is likely ever to become.

The main reason for my change of relative attitudes toward these

groups has been the incrcased preoccupation of certain MCC members.

• Posse comitatus. Also known as the Christian Posse Association,

a organization serves as the paramilitary arm of the NOC. The goals

its most ardent activists seem to be very similar to those of the

is but their tactics are quite different. Instead of wrapping them-

res in the swastika, they uphold the Christian Cross as their symbol.

ike the head-on street clashes which many of the lazis seem to relish,

bers of

Posse Conitatus generally tend

to preier being secretive ara

destine in their operations. They generally seem to fancy themselves

pe revolutionaries and as fanatical as some of them appear, I believe

potential exists or the Posse to become a truly revolutionary group.

Dennis Loso was at one vime a major financial supporter of the

PP. He has renounced that coup since 1972 but not because of its

poses but only because he considers it to be ineffective. He is now

edicated supportor of the lico and its national leader, "illiam Gale.

• almost never misses an ICC meeting in San Diego, frequently visits

Glendale meetings of MCC, and more recently attended the MCC seminar

kanassa Ranch in Mariposa. If loso is not already an officer within

se Conitatus, then the potential certainly exists for him to become

•. Loso is also an admirer of Jack Fredericks and vas just elected to

San Diego County Central Conniutco of the Amorican Independent Party.

Welt Kendall, another ex-Nazi, supporter who has turned to the Mcc,

also a potential activist fox Posse Conitatus. Rendall attends perhaps

#of Gale's meetings in San Diego and is definitely not bothered by

prosocat of using violence to attain political goals. He once sug-

ded that sherifi John Duffy of San Diego County should be assassinated.

Jerry Busch, a..a. Marl Roverts, is another man to watch. He

ast to participate in such events. Herriet is definitely the brains

his infomant does noi consider either one of them to be capable of a

reneditated act of violence.

Eddy stated, however, that he is very distrustful of anyone whom

he has not known for a very long time and would definitely do some exter-

sive clicire lute a person's background before trusting him as a

con-

federate in any terririst activity. Eddy seems to enjoy violence but

he is also a clever, intelligent man and should never be underestinated.

I regard him as being one of the most dangerous people named in this

report even though I do not believe him to be a member of Posse Comitatus

as yet.

Vic Walton is another figure who is likely to have a hand in the

organization of Posse Comitatus in San Diego County. This attorney,

in this informant's opinion, presents no threat of physical violence

whatever but he serves as a sort of liaison man. between the various

right-wing extremist groups in the southern Califomia area. He is

intelligent and

seems to be fairly well off financially. Through rim

many others can be reached as Walton has been involved with people in

the NipP, the MCC, the SAO, Conparet's group and virtually any other

extremist outfit in the right-wing which one might think of in this area.

I hope this report will give you some idea as to the current status

of Posse comitatus in San Diego County. At least I believe it to be a

fairly accurate description of some of the prime-movers

of Posse Comitaiü

as of the present. Due to the more underground nature of this group,

It is more difficult to keep tabs on than is the openly Nazi Party.

However, as this organizational arn of the MCC makes the attempt to

establish itself as a force to be reckoned with and to consolidate

whatever power it might gain, certain characteristics of it are bound

to surface and becone more clear. This informant will do his best to

learn as much about this emerging group as quickly as possible and to

relay the information to you as accurately as can be done. One thing

seens to be very certain and that is that San Diego County seems to be

extrenely fertile soil for the flourishing of a group like Posse Comitatu

That is all for now.

Report by INFORMANT

Meeting of Colonel WILLIAM GALE at

O'Neira Hall on the Evening of

March 28, 1974, San Diego, California

4/5/74

Approximately 75 persons were present at that

meeting. It included, among others, GEORGE UDVARY,

VICTOR B. WALTON, MICKEY WAKEFIELD, J. ANDREW SIMPSON,

ELLEN ADAMS, BILI MILLER, JONATHAN WEST, JOE BRINKER,

HARRIET BRINKER, JANET BRINKER, COlonel VILLIAM GALE, ANN

NUTTER, and others who are very old and very inactive.

There were a number of individuals present who are as yet

unknown to me.

GEORGE UDVARY does not seem to have made his

move yet--permanent move out of the area. He's still in

process, I believe, as best I can tell at this time. MICKEY

WAKEFIELD came down from Escondido, was hoping to run

Into some of his para-military friends, one or two of whom

did not evidently arrive. He did run into VICTOR WALTON

who he' is close to. BILL MILLER was there and very involved--

on the surface at least. ELLEN ADAMS was distributing

literature. JOE and HARRIET BRINKER came in from Escondido

and of course are primarily responsible for putting on that

monthly meeting and so they were working with that.

There was security that night-more so than

would ordinarily be expected. A fellow by the name of

DENNIS was inside wiüh a 23-channel, five watt Citizens Band

walkie-talkie, Realistic brand, sold by Radio Shack. He

kept monitoring another individual whose name I do not have

who was outside. He had a two or three channel Citizens

Band walkie-talkie, Midland brand, and they were checking

to see if anyone would give them any trouble. This was

because of a publication that indicated where their meeting

would be held. They didn't indicate what they would do if

such trouble arrived.

Colonel GALE discussed an article on himself and

the identity movement as wiitten up in Volume V, Issue 14,

of a bi-monthly publication, called the San Diego Door.

I believe thai's a March, 1974 issue. Colonel GALE read

directly from the article and made comments and corrections

as he went.

• He said, now I will read--follow this and read as

much as possible that seems relevant. He read fxom the

• article: "But the public meetings are only part of the

• package. Whenever GALE speaks, he recruits followers into

the para-military part of his organization. That part is

called 'Identity' and has so far incorporated many old

Minutemen and secret army elements in Southern California."

To that, Colonel GALE indicated that "Identity"

was the name of his church publication--he thought it was

NW 68262 Docld:32989523 Page 251

## Page 252

very humorous. that they thought it was something else.

The term is used to describe their philosophy.

The para-military part of their operation is under

such titles as the "Christian Posse Association."

I will make another quote here from the publication:

"JERRY LYNN DAVIS, the ex-head of the SAO in California,

has been reported at GALE's public meetings." According

to MICKEY WAKEFIELD who was sitting next to me during this

meeting, DAVIS had not, as far as he knew, ever been to a

San Diego meeting.

Another quote Colonel GALE made: "Identity is

organized in similar fashion to other underground organizations-

i small cells communicate through a series of

intermediaries

and blind post office boxes." Golonel GALE did not comment

further; however, the mailing network for the rational tape

groups, the Christian Posse Association groups, and the

amateur radio network are the primary communication links

Of GALE's group.

• Another quote Colonel GALE made from the articie:

"In San Diego, GALE can be heard speaking to his congregation

on the fourth Thursday of every month at the O'Neira Club

on Holly Street" or something of that nature "between 34th

and 35th Streets, one block south of Adams Avenue." The

street was incorrectly quoted--it's Hawley, and Colonel

GALE made an observation on that, indicating he thought

the information was transferred to the person at this publication

NW 68262 Docld:32989523 Page 252*

---

## Page 253

by telephone and that he figured, he had that all figured

out that way because the person must have misunderstood

the name and got it wrong.

The next quote from the publication: "According

to one law enforcement source, Identity has about 50 members

In the San Diego area, including members of the San Diego

Sheriff's Department and reserve police officers." Colonel

GALE indicated support from and for law enforcement-indicated

he has an assistant pastor in Glendale who has an important

position in the los Angeles County Sheriff's Office, and

that he claims support from a number of law enforcement

areas.

Another quote he indicated: "As for GALE, he

, pretends to be a minister of his church and operates through

it as his front. GALE was one of the driving forces behind

the militant Christian Defense League (CDL) in the 60's.

He had formed the small California Rangers in the late 50's.

The California State Attorney General's Office described

the Rangers as," then they put a quote in here, in this article,

" 'A secret underground guerrilla force, linked with other

non-military organizations by a common ideology and leader-

ship.'

Colonel GALE indicated at this meeting the Rangers

vere registered with the state and had support of California

law enforcement.

Another quote from the article that the Colonel

NW-68262-Docld:32989523 Page 253

---

## Page 254

made: "GALE's

strategy to recruit member-

through veterans

organizations was thwarted in 1963 when the long Beach Press

Telegram exposed his efforts to convert the American Legion

Post in Signal Hill into a Ranger front. It was after this

that one of the Rangers was arrested for selling a machine

gun and a stem gun to undercover agents." Colonel GALE

indicated that he was involved to some extent with this

particular post, with this particular veterans group, that

he transferred from the Hollywood post. Also, he said that

the Ranger's, that particular

Ranger's arrest, was an

entrapment and an unfortunate error on that Ranger's part.

Another quote he made: "The CDI was quite an

• organization when GALE was a part of it. It grew to

include the Klan, the National States' Rights Party, and

many other Right Wing groups." Colonel GALE admitted

connection with the Christian Defense League, indicating

that he was very active.

Another quote: GALE has ample experience to

found a para-military organization. In addition to more

than 20 years involvement in right wing circles, GALE is

a retired Lieutenant Colonel, U. S. Army. He served with

the MAC ARTHUR command after World War. II in the counter-

insurgency staff," and it goes on. But Colonel GALE corrected

this counter-insurgency information. He indicated that he

was on the staff of MAC ARTIUR in Japan, but previous to

NW 68262 Docld:32989523 Page 254

## Page 255

that was when

he was involved in counter- insurgency and

that was with the guerrilla activities in the Philippines,.

which was also indicated in this article.

Then, another interesting thing, he quoted: "The

SAO was in large part organized by HOWARD B. GODFREY, an

FBI Agent." He didn't have arything notable to say about

GODFREY.

Actually, one of the things he indicated, too,

in this discussion of his was that there is a lot of diffi-

culty getting different right wing groups to cooperate in

a military fashion and that that is very necessary and I

get the impression that he is attempting and wishes to whip

these groups into line in a really efficiènt military manner

that will be very effective and efficient. 'That is the pri-

mary problem. He also indicated his willingness to cooperate

with law enforcement, of course on his terms no doubt;

and he said he was ready and they were ready to face those

Jews and their articles and their so-called

exposes and

whatever else they might happen to want to do; that they

are ready to communicate with their people and take care of

anyone who gives them any trouble. He indicated that he

had communication links all over--that

Exom his car he

could talk immediately with his link in Saugus--I don't

know what link he was referring to, but it was in Saugus,

and in Glendale and other areas like that, which he mentioned.

That covers much of his comments at that particu-

lar meeting. There was quite a lot of response--the people

enjoyed that immensely. It was a reaction

similar to a

grandstanding and I think he was milking it for all he

could get.

J. ANDREW SILIPSON resides at 229 Kalmia Street,

San Diego, California 92101, telephone number in San Diego

232-5658.

There were some questions and answers during

this session. JOE BRINKER was passing out blank piaces

of paper so that people could write their comments and

questions on the papers which were then passed up to Colonel

GALE. Along with those blank pieces of paper, JOE BRINKER

had a throw-away on the tax revolt. The heading was "Sunny

• San Diego Invites You to 1974's Biggest Tax Expo" and then

another heading, "Tax Foes Tell Why and How They Stopped

Paying Income Fax," etc., etc. It talked about meetings in

the San Diego area on that. Registration forms for special

get-togethers, in this case, Sheraton Inn-Airport on

Friday, April 5th and Saturday, April 6th, 7 PoM. to Il Poll.

on Fxiday, April Sth; 9 A.M. to 5 P.M. Saturday, April 6th.

For those who wish to write for information, they'a write to

Avenue, El Cajon, California 92021. Now whether this point

was being stressed more by JOE BRINKER or whether it was also

under

the tacit approval of Colonel GALE, I do not know.

SECT: Thugs attack SAO member.

As you can tell by the content of the enclosed letter, terrorist

¡rity seems still to be going on in San Diego County. II true, What

letter says definitely refutes Paul Fuplinger's denial that he vas

a member of the secret Army Organization.

This beating incident also seems to bear out this informant's sus-

Ions that there is a leftist underground SAo type organization operating

the Sun Diego area. Perhaps these assailants who attacked the Ruplinger:

their friend were the same group who shot up the mobile home park in

ondião where Mickey Wakefield resides. In any event, this latest

lence is bound to heighten tensions between the warring factions.

Ray Wilson is obviously very pleased that the Zionist headquarters

New York was bombed. It was news to this informant to learn that

• Nilson's landlady is a close friend of the Ruplingers. This means

it she must be at least semi-politically aligned with the Ruplingers

possibly even Wilson himself.

That'is about it for now. Hope this will help.

THE STRANGE TALE OF

THE SECRET ARMY

ORGANIZATION (USA)

an Diego is a strange town, where the niceties of West-

ern civilization cannot hide the power of the buck

and the hint of brute force. It is the city built with

the largesse of twenty-five years of imperial sway: a

stronghold, a haven of anticommunism, a base for racke-

teers. Richard Nixon considered it his lucky city. He

wanted the Republican. Convention to be held there, and

though the city fathers and the people of San Diego were

not terribly enthusiastic, the plans went forward until May

1972, when the President abruptly changed his mind.

Included in these plans, it turns out, was a tumultuous,

massive, bloody riot-on such a scale as to justify the most

extraordinary preventive measures, including burglary, bug-

•ging, sabotage, and perhaps even kidnapping. Watergate, we

learn from the likes of John W. Dean, was simply part of a

strategy to maintain domestic tranquility in the face of a

serious left-wing threat.

Presumably, this Red Menace existed in San Diego as

well as Miami. But San Diego has never been a radical

stronghold, and while local activists did undertake extensive

preparations for anti-war demonstrations during the GOP

convention, the Committee to Re-elect the President seems

to have had a far higher opinion of their organizing suc-

cesses than they themselves dared to entertain.

Unless, of course, CREEP and its local San Diego allies

were hell-bent on making certain that bedlam did in fact

occur. That is precisely what a defecting agent provocateur

named Lewis Tackwood suggested almost two years ago.

Tackwood told an incredible story back in October and

November 1971, one which suggested the Republicans were

doing their utmost to turn San Diego into a bloodbath

during, the convention, with the sim of annihilating the left,

smearing the Democrats, and coasting comfortably into

four more ycars of conservative rule. Iis allegations were

regarded as the ravings of a madman until testimony in the

Senate caucus room appeared to corroborate some of his

wildest stories. He told of preparations to seal off and then

bomb 100,000 demonstrators attending a rock concert on

Fiesta Island in Mission Bay, San Diego. All sorts of may-

hem was supposed lo occur. Bombs were to be smuggled

into Convention Center in hollow furniture, which was al-

ready being built in Los Angeles. At least one major Repub-

lican official would perish in the melee. The Democratic

Party would be tied in to the events, discredited, possibly

outlawed. The Republican candidate would then win an

easy victory with the overwhelming support of an Outraged

citizenry. Today, Tackwood sticks by his original story (10

be published in September by Avon as The Glasshouse

Tapes), though he now adds that the plan also called for

blowing up the podium as President Nixon was making his

acceptance speech!

(CIVIL WAR IN SAN DIEGO]

ncredible as the Tackwood scenario seemed back in

1971, it sounded less outlandish to San Diego radicais

than to those on the outside. For two years, they had

quite literally been engaged in protracted warfare

with

right-wingers determined to drive them out of the

area.

As early as 1970, activists associated with the San

Diego Street Journal, an underground newspaper, were liv-

ing in an armed fortress which they guarded around the

clock against the attacks of night riders who would shoot

into their houses, firebomb their cars and threaten their

lives. (Curiously, this terror campaign intensilied as the

paper exposed more and more illegal activities of San Diego

kingpin C. Arnholt Smith.) On one occasion, for example,

sentries spotted two men crouched behind

a car with a

high-powered rifle trained on the house. It was late at night, •

but they were prepäred for such emergencies. At a signal,

they switched.on floodlamps which bathed the house in

light and they announced over & loudspeaker system thai

they would open fire if the men did not withdraw. The

gunmen waited a moment, then dismantled their rifle, and

drove off into the night.

By late 1971, the vigilantes had stepped up their attacks

and had chosen their principal targets. One of these was a

certain Peter Bolmer, a radical who at the time was teach-

ing economics at San Diego State College. He began receiv-

ing threatening phone calls, and on November 13. 1971, i

car parked in front of his house was firebombed. Then sin

December 27, 1971, a group calling itself the Scorer Army

Organization put out a Special Bulletin on Peter Bohmer.

Alter listing his anti-war activities, and his background, the

letter said: "For any of our readers who may care to look

physical description.

"Now, in case any of you don't believe

Or January 6, 1972, cross-hair

stickers (the symbol of the SAO) were

placed on the doors of three San Diego

State College professors, including

Bohmer. Then, an anonymous caller

telephoned Bohmer's residence to say,

"This time we left a sticker, next time

we may leave a grenade. This is the

SAO." Bohmer's friends were called

and told to say goodbye to him. That

evening, two

shots were fired into

Bohmer's home and a woman named

Paula Tharp was wounded.

The right-wing terror campaign con-

tinued for six more months, marked

by death threats, menacing phone

calls, and warning messages. Its climax

came on June 19, 1972, when an SAO

member bombed a local porno movie

• house, the Guild Theatre. This last

: event

finally aroused the San Diego

police to drive the group underground.

Police action brought a halt, at least

temporarily, to right-wing terrorism in

San Diego. But this is not the end of

the tale. For in the months that fol-

lowed a very bizarre story began to un-

ravel, one which involved the SAO, the

FBI, and some mysterious contacts

between the terrorists and agents of

CREEP. The pieces began to appear as

early as mid- 1972, but it is only in re-

cent months that they have been

pulled together by reporters for

another San Diego alternative news-

paper, the Door.

(THE FBI CONNECTION]

S

AO thrived in San Diego until the

June 1972 bombing of the Guild

Theatre led to the group's fall

from grace. A former Birchite named

William Francis Yakopee was arrested

and charged with the bombing, and in

September 1972, he was brought to

trial in the Superior Court of the State

• of California in San Diego, before

Judge Robert W. Conyers. Much to the

astonishment of the SAO supporters,

the

star, witness against

Yakopec

turned out to be San Diego Com-

mander Godfrey. Then a local fireman.

Godfrey admitted he had worked for

the FBI since early 1967 as an under-

cover agent. He did it, he said, because

"I felt it was my duty to my country."

Before accepting the role, he had

- talked it over with J. Clifford Wallace,

then the Stake President of the Mormon

Church for San Diego, and more

recently a federal judge by appoint-

ment of Richard Nixon. Wallace put

Godfrey in touch with the FBI, and he

was assigned to agent Steve Christian-

son, to whom he reported verbally

- every day. Godfrey was to

work on

the militant right wing, and was paid

$250.00 per month by the FBI. At

first he was assigned to the Minute-

men, and then with the demise of that

group in San Diego, he helped start®

--and sun the SAO in November 1971.

Godfrey testified that his FBI contacts

knew all of his activities, including his

- stockpiling of illegal explosives in his

house. This, he said, was done with

their permission. (He later gave some

of the explosives to Yakopec 1o "save

them for after the Communist take-

over of this country.")

Godfrey functioned as a one-man

plumbers' operation within the SAO.

He knew how to pick locks, burglarize,

bomb and handle guns. The FBI paid

his dues and covered his expenses. All

this enabled him to carry on eftective-

Xy as a terrorist. At Yakopec's trial, he

said that he actively recruited for the

group. What kind of people did he

look for? "People with previous right

wing conncctions." Did he enlist po.

tentially dangerous elements? "Yes,

Apparently, Godfrey himself was

- among the more dangerous elements in

the SAO, and

agent Christianson

NW 68262 Docld:32989523 Page 267

grises of the operation. During the

Yakopec trial, Godfrey admitted that

he had driven the car from which

another SAO member, Gerrge Hoover,

had fired into Buhmer's house, wound-

ing Paula Tharp. Subsequently, he had

taken the weapon to Christianson,

who had hidden it for six months.

(This

was

evidently

insufficient

grounds for the FBI to take disci-

plinary action against agent Christian-

son. He continued as Godfrey's con-

tact until the bombing of the Guild

Theatre, at which point he was re-

moved by L. Patrick Gray himself. He

currently resides in Kanosh, Utah.)

In addition, Godfrey confessed to

publishing a certain leaflet on Febru-

ary 18, 1972, the day on which Presi-

dent Nixon left for China. The bulletin

was headlined "Wanted for Treason,"

and it featured a picture of Nixon and

an inflammatory text which accused

the President of high treason because

of his China policy. The SAO symbol

appeared at the bottom of the text,

and the group distributed it in 15

cities-including San Diego, Phoenix,

Yuma, San Francisco, and Bellinghan,

- Washington.

At the Yakopec trial, Godfrey testi-

fied that he had paid the printer for

the posters, picked them up, and was

reimbursed by the FBI, and that the

FBI understood the nature of his ex-

penditures and saw all of his SAO pub-

lications. As for poor Yakopec, who

had joined the SAO through Godfrey,

his next door neighbor, he admitted to

owning several of the posters: he said

he stored them under his mattress.

Why there? "I thought they were kind

of corny." Later, he testified that he

kept a bomb with the Nixon posters.

Did he generally keep bombs under his

bed? "No, I like to sleep. too well."

(When I visited the San Diego Court

House to see the exhibit in question,

the custodian located a stack of 33

posters, with the bomb casing still at-

tached!)

It was not noted at the time, but in

fact these posters bear a remarkable

resemblance to leatlets which were dis-

tributed in Dallas. Texas, just one or

no days prior to the assassination of

President Kennedy. That poster like-

wise bore the headline "Wanted for

Treason" and it also featured pictures

(front and protite) of JFK and an in-

Mammatory text about the President's

allegedly treasonous activities. On the

hunch that the leatlet night have some

connection with the assassination, the

Warren Commission sent Secret Ser-

vice agents to track down its author

and printer.

They worked from late

November 1963, 1o May 1904, until

they found that Robert G. Klause had

printed the flyer and

that Robert

Allan Surrey, an associate of Gen.

Walker, had ordered it. When Surrey

testified before the Commission

on

June 16, 1964, he pled the Fifth

Amendment on all questions concern-

ing the leaflct. The late Hale Boggs, a

member of the Warren Commission,

pointed out that Surrey "is the only

witness out of hundreds who has pled

the Fifth Amendment." Klause denied

any interest in or involvement with the

contents of the leaflet, and there the

matter was allowed to rest. By that

point, the Warren Commission was

determined to prove that Oswald had

acted alone, and therefore lost interest

in trying to connect the assassination

with the leaflet.

Godfrey's surfacing as an FBl agent

• rattled the remnants of the SAO. They

were angry at having been set up by

the FBI, and when reporters for the

Door began approaching their old ad-

versaries for information earlier this

year, they found that many were will-

ing

to cooperate; some were even

friendly. And as the SAO began to

open up, a pattern began to emerge

which seemed to link the San Diego

events to Watergate.

(BREAKTHROUGH]

T The breakthrough came

this

spring when an editor of the

Door made contact with a

former SAO militant named Jerry

Busch. From November 1969 to the

summer of 1971, said Busch, Howard

Berry Godfrey made frequent visits to

the Gunsmoke Ranch in El Cajun. "It

was also during June, July, and August

of 1971 that Berry Godirey and

Donald

Segretti (posing as

'Don

Simms') visited Gunsmoke and though

supposedly not knowing each other,'

they spoke together on at lease one de-

casion," in a quiet conversation aside.

The Segretti connection is important

in itself; it is particularly interesting in-

sofar as-according to Busch's account

-Sergretti was in touch with SA0

---

## Page 268

while contacting his old college chums

Chapin and Strachan in June

1971,

but before commencing work as

dirty trickster in September 1971.

Busch did not say what Segretti dis-

•cussed at the Gunsmoke Ranch, but he

did report that following "these casual

conversations" Godfrey came up with

bizarre ideas to take care of what he

called "those sed punks" -in the event

that the GOP held its convention in

San Diego. Among Godfrey's plans in

October 1971, were:

1) the use of massive dosages of LSD,

cyanide or strychnine introduced

into the punch at anti-war group

meetings;

2) bombing

of the VVAW head-

quarters, the Guild Theatre, and

several porno shops;

3) bombings of the homes or offices

of anti-war leaders:

4) kidnapping or assassination of anti-

war leaders and activists;

5) fire bombing of vehicles and other

• property belonging to anti-war ac-

tivists.

By November and December 1971,

Busch continued, Godfrey had become

more ambitious: he wanted to acquire

drone planes which would carry pay-

• loads of high explosives and phospho-

rus to be dropped on the demon-

strators. In addition, Godfrey spoke of

using similar air craft, loaded with

TNT or C-4 plastique, to blow up Air

Force One and assassinate Nixon. The

• idea was to fly a bomb into the Presi-

dential jet as it landed either at Lind-

bergh Field or at El Toro Marine Base.

Busch claimed. that he had expressed

horror at the suggestion and told God-

frey he had lost his mind suggesting

anything as insane as an attempt on

the life of the President. Shortly there-

after, Busch and Godirey parted ways

after the former grew suspicious that

he was being set up to take the rap on

the shooting of Paula Tharp. By

March 1972, he had left San Diego

and has not yet returned.

Even before Busch left the SAO,

the "Wanted for Treason" leaflet was

printed

and distributed. Another

former SAO member corroborates that

in this same crod-January-February,

1972-Godf.ry tried to find someone

10 build a pline that would

carry a

load of high explosives. (In addition,

he was apparently trying to obtain

another plane. for the purpose of gas-

sing or bombing demonstrators un

NW 68262 Docld:32989523 Page 268

Fiesta Island.) After Busch's depar-

ture, the SAO issued its April 1972,

bulletin, which began with a quote at-

tributed to Abraham Lincoln, "A ty-

rant would not come to the United

States from across the sea. If he

comes, he'll ride down Pennsylvania

Avenue from his inauguration and take

up legal

residence of the

White

House." Then followed detailed in-

structions on the manufacture of ex-

plosives which might be used to de-

stroy a large bridge (Tackwood's

land) and on various methods of

forced entry into buildings.

(A SINISTER PLOT?]

Tas there a right-wing plot to

kill the President? Tackwood

says so. Busch says that FBI

informer Berry Godfrey talked about

it. The "Wanted for Treason"

poster

certainly indicated no loss of love be-

tween the extreme right and the Presi-

dent, and Godfrey was checking out

the availability of drone planes.

There are other curious, if admit-

tedly inconclusive, clues as well: The

day Nixon went to China, E. Howard

• Hunt was working as a public relations

man on a Julie Nixon Eisenhower TV

spot. He raged about the China trip,

"We should not send people to China,

we should send bombs to China." This

from a man supposedly involved in a

secret scheme to re-elect the President

by illegal means.

Or take this item which appeared in

the March 9, 1972, issue of the N.Y.

Times (10 days after Nixon's return

from China):

WAR ALERT SENT IN HOAX

BY A COAST GUARDSMAN

"New Orleans, March 8 (UPI)-An en-

listed man standing watch sent a hoax

message to ships at sea during Presi-

dent Nixon's visit to China, saying the

President had been assassinated and

the Vice President had declared World

War Ill, the Coast Guard revealed yes-

"The authorities said that the hoax

message had not been taken seriously

and that the man who sent it from a

small Coast Guard station in Texas had

been confined and was

underguing

medical evaluation.

"I le message was sent February 27

by selecype to 22 slips in the Gull of

•xico."

There was no further story on this

that I have been able to find. It the

hoax message had gone out to a Polaris

submarine, Hunt might have gotten his

wish, that bombs would be sent lo

China.

Then, the L.A. Times reported on

July 13, 1973 that a former Minute-

man had requested political asylum in

Fiji, saying he had secret information

on Watergate and feared assassination.

All

of

this proves nothing,

course, but it suggests that the Dirty

Tricks operation may have been much

more complex than we have been led

to believe. Perhaps there was a plot to

kill Nixon, and then again Godfrey's

plot may have been a further hoas

aimed at discrediting the left and the

Democratic Party. What did Segretti

discuss with Godfrey, and why and

how did he meet Godfrey in the first

place? How did it happen that the FBI

financed a threat on the life of a Presi-

dent (a crime which carries a penalty

of up to live years in jail and a 51,000

fine)? In the past, the Secret Servive

has taken such threats very seriously.

A check of the New York Times index

shows that at least 11 people were ar-

rested between January, 1972 and

May 1973 for doing much less than

Godfrey. Most seem to have been

psychopaths or drunks, with no posi-

tive plan-just verbal threats.

But then there are other instances:

Arthur Bremer's Ottawa visit on April

13-14, 1972, for example, when he

supposedly stalked Nixon. On May 30,

three bombs demolished the tomb of

the father of the Shah of Iran an hour

before Nixon was scheduled to lay a

wreath there. On August 11, a certain

A. B. Topping was arrested in New

York after paying an undercover agent

$1,000 to kill Nixon. Topping, it

developed, was well-to-do, of

American Nazi political persuasion,

and interested in having the President

killed the week after the pay-olf. do

trial has been held. And then in late

May 1973, one of Nixon's helicopters

went down in the Bahamas. It subse-

quently came out that the President

has three helicopters ready at all limes

and chooses which to use one minute

before the flight.

Watergate has uncovered an ad-

ministration racked by lackonalism.

degree that Hoover was willing to use

•secret documents to blackmail the

President. In addition, Nixon was

having his difficulties with the leaders

of the CIA, and James McCord wrote

to John Caulfield at Christinas, 1972.

that if Nixon pushed out Helms and

involved the ClA in Watergate,

"every

ree in the forest will fall." Could

there have been other tensions as well?

Were there elements which opposed®

Nixon for his policy of rapprochement

with China and Russia, and which

would have preferred; say, Spiro

Agnew as President?

After returning from San Diego in

July 1972, acting FBI director, L.

Patrick Gray, talked to Nixon and

said: "Mr. President, there is some-

thing I want to speak to you about.

Dick Walters and I feel that people on

your staff are trying to mortally

wound you by using the ClA and the

FBI ..." His words may have carried

greater import than any of us have

• heretofore suspected.

*

In August of this year, Godfrey

reportedly admitted to the San Diego

Door that there was a real plot to kill

Nixon. He blames the plan on his erst-

while cohort, Gary Lynn Davis.

•Calvin Fox runs a Gulf Service Station in ElCajon.

Fox stated that he was approached many times by Berry Godfrey

who said he wa, Lt. Commander in the Secret Army Organization.

He tried to seil Fox illegal weapons, etc. and invited him to

join. the S.A.0.

Berry Godfrey vas

a paid agent for the I'BI for at least 5

years and was assigned to investigate Right-wing Organizations.

Fox said that codfrey hung around his station alot but that ne

did not join as he was doubtful of the organization.

In May, Fox west to Washington to march with McIntyre in the

May 20th. protest, "To win the War"

¡While he was alay, FBI agents through an informer, Mr. Pittman

working for Fox, went through various files without permission.

Upon his return from Hashington, Fox tried to discover why all

the interest fron the FBI.

After many phone calls and many

days ha was told that since ho was a former menber of the

Minutemen, involved with the S.A.O, a known wallace supporter,

since wallace ias shot and ir. Fox was not far from the area,

that. he was suspect and they were trying to get his license

number to give to the secret Service.

Ho was a character witness

for Yakopic but because of some

"panica" evidence he will

pe tried for perjury.

this time (right after the theatre bombing) Fox stated

the 1'I vent to Proy laughton's motiers home in hallosa aná dia

some citonsive digging in the backyard and found nothing, they

then left with no explanation.

Fox also made the comment that Tackwood, Los Angeles Police Dept.

Undcrcover igent, quit recently and stated he diá so vecause,

•I don't want to plant bombs and kill delegates to the convention

to be hold in San Diego"

• Tackwood, has written a boox called,

*Glass House"

, soon to be rolcased, it deals with that aspect of

his life.

Fox frels the FBI and Godfrey are : ecruiting-and pushing to involva

rigil-vingers in illegal operation; along with the police depart-

ment (bombing and laying the blame on the right ving), were setting

the stage for a riot so.Marshall Law could be called and U.N.

• In carclusion:

• There were no real points made, or a moral or even much of

They

maâo a

pitch for funds to holp fox

pay for his perjury trial

(95,100.00) .

Those in attendance seemed to enjo! the talk: but nothing con

struciive came out of the meeting.

I alss sensed that Rod Duff is trying to pull himself out of...

a slump or depression.

when menticning it to Julie Hanna,.

she agreed saying that her friend lick Rogers nas also stated

same (he is a member).

He fell short as a leader in my opinion, as he asked the group

what chey would like to do and wha: type of meetings they

wantes- he should have told them that he had going and got the

people busy and active right then.

I asked him, after the meeting, what the dues ware and did he

do for the council or did the council do for him and the move-

ment - he looked startled and

replica, "I'm afraid right noir I

do for the council". - looks to me like he needs the up and

coming seminar to put him back on l is feet.

One other note - fox feels like Yalopic was paid off as his

wife seems to have alot of

Informed by them that they had discovered his gate open

the Secret Army Organization trials, HOWARD BARRY GODFREY

had testitied that JERRY LYNN DAVIS had known about the

weapons stolen from MARSHALL. MARSHALL could not recall

whether GODFREY had testitied that he had actually at

the time seen these weapons or had testified that he had

merely been informed oi these weapons by DAVIS.

MARSHALL stated that he desired to know

whether or not the FBI had any intormation regarding his

weapons and his primary interest was to recover his

weapons -

MARSHALL was advised that all information

furnished by HOWARD BARRY GODFREY to the FBI regarding

violations of local or state statutes had been disseminated

to the appropriate local or state agency, and that he

should contact the San Diego County Sheritt's Oftice as

that agency would have jurisdiction over the burglary

which occurred at his residence. He said he had been in

contact with the San Diego County Sheritt's Oftice, and had

been advised that his weapons had not been recovered and

that the Sheritt's Office had no information regarding

the whereabouts of these weapons.

MARSHALL further advised that he is aware of the

Location of the Gunsnoke Ranch, but does not trequent

ot person and sated at de secret as never mean

except RICHARD FLEURY. He turther advised that FLEURY has

a considerable number of weapons at his residence, including

shot guns, rifles, and automatic pistols. He has made

-

statements to the ettect that he will not again be taken

alive. MARSHALL expressed his personal point that FLEURY is

mentally unbalanced, and turther advised that FLEURY is

highly critical of all law entorcement in general, and of

the EBl, Inparticular. He said l'LiuRy plans to file sult

against the San Diego, Calitornia, Police Department

01: the San Diego County Sheritt's

Ottice for the

return of weapons which were seized from him at the

time of his arrest.

He said that FLEURY also talks

about going to South America and is highly critical

of the United States Government in his conversations.

MARSHALL further advised that GENEVIEVE FLEURY

in con-

versation with other neighbors which have been related

tO MARSHAlL: has indicated that she thinks her husband,

RICHARD FLEURY, is planning to do something "out of the

ordinary"

• MARSHALL said he did not know what she meant

by out of the ordinary, and further advised that he has

no direct conversation with her, but has been hearing

these rumors from other people, and he expressed the

opinion that FLEURY's depacture from the Ünited States

may be what these rumors refer to.

He said that GENEVIEVE

FLEURY has indicated to neighbors

that RICHARD FLEURY

thinks that she will accompany him to South America,

but, in fact, she does not plan to go with him if he does

leave this country.

MARSHALL advised that he is not on friendly

terms with FLeURy, in that he somewhat suspects fLEURY of

burglarizing his

home, and he feels that FLEURY does not

trust him.

he said he would relay any intormation regarding

FLEURY's activities to this office, but said that because

of his relationship with FLEURY, he would not bee in a

position to actively seek information regarding FLEURY's

plans.

"What country can preserve its liberties, if its rules are not warned from time to time that the

people preserve the spirit of resistance?" -THoMAs JEFFERSON

NUMBER 151

LYNCH

Evidence is accumulating that if

you are. Jewish or Negro, you can

PARTIES

break the law with impunity, but if

you are White and a patriot, you

are a second-class

citizen. There

is a growing

double standard of justice in the U.S.-harsh pun-

ishment for patriots (secured by the perjury of

federal agents) and leniency for the Left.

Last month saw two outrageous miscarriages of

Justice in San Diego. On Icembe:

21, ten tax

protestors were declared "guilty" of "conspiracy

to rescue seized property" by a jurv which

followed the promptings of a federal judge.

Judge Leland C. Nielsen clearly had received

orders from higher-ups to convict the ten de-

fendants, no matter what he hac to do. He show-

ed open contempt for the rights of the accused,

refusing even to recognize that the Heck Ware-

house- the focus of the picketing that led federal

agents to physically assault the patriots and ar-

rest them on trumped-up charges-had not even

been legally seized by the IRS until the day after

the arrest of the defendants!

• The federal agents involved perjured themselves

on the witnesss stand but the jury (composed in

large part of 'bureaucrats and others whose salaries

are paid for by tases) refused to believe that FBI

and Treasury agents would act in the criminal

manner they.dit and then lie under oath.

Although prosecution testimony was inconsist-

ent, distorted and contradictory, Nielson brusquely

dismissed defense motions and objections and

upheld the prosecution throughout.

The other lynching bee in San Diego concerned

two men who were admittedly entrapped by un-

dercover FBI agent-provacateur Howard Godfrey.

Undisputed are the facts that Gudfrey incited.

William F. Yakopec into bombing a porno movie

house, and even supplied the dynamite.

Yakopec was convicted of the bombing on

Godfrey's testimory. A witness for Yakopec, Cal-

vin H. Fox, was subsequently convicted of per-

jury on Godfrey's testimony, although the evidence

clearly indicacted that Fox was celling the truth

shattering year in Amcricas inter-

ArView national relations. President Nixon

abruptly reversed his previous anti-

• Communist stince. The machinations of his for-

eign policy mentor, Dr. Henry A. Kissinger, re

julted in a detente with Peking and Moscow

was enthusiastically supported by the

"liberal" news media and paved the way for

Nixon's highly publicized trips to Red China and

Suviet Russia. The general public, bemused and

confused by an avalanche of promotional publicity

featuring world peace as the ultimate goal, was

cajoled into accepting the bland assurances of the

Kissinger-Nixon team. WO readers had been fore-

warned about the Nixon-Kissinger scheme of

Soviet-American convergence as the first step in

the 'Grand Design of One World Government.

In reviewing the many exclusive news items of

WASHIINCTON OBSERVER in the course of 1972 it

will be noticed that on March 15, 1972, WO ex-

clusively reported that Nixon's bagman and po-

litical mastermind, Murray M. Chotiner, was

surreptitiously channelling funds to the pro-Com-

munist People's Party. The purpose of the oper-

ation was to draw left-wing iotes from Democrat

candidates. This was the first repoxted act of

sabotage against the Democrats.

On May 1, 1972, WO exclusively reported:

"... In his desire to run as the 'Peace President'.

in November 1972, President Nixon has let the

Kremlin leacers know that he is ready to grant

them-and heln them assert-suzerain rights in

all Western Europe, as well as in Germany and in

the Soviet-occupied countries of Central and

Eastern Europe.

" The current conference on

European security in Helsinki and the moves afoot

to recognize the Soviet puppet regime of East

Germany as a sovereign government doom the

hopes of the reunification of Germany which were.

Does Mr. Buckley get his anti-toxin shots

from ADL? He seems to be immune from

i character assassination. Senators Goldwater,

the late Robert A. Taft, Sr., Joe McCarthy,

Gen. MacArthur, Gov. Wallace, and patriotic

groups inciuding LIBERTY LOBBY never escape

the poison pen of ADL. So maybe perfidy

and duplicity is not so forzign to his political

stance. At any rate, WASHINGTON OBSERVER

NEWSLETTER has about convinced me. Al

least, Mr. Buckley's conservatism doesn't go

beyond the point of: "Hang your clothes on

One of the most frequent complaints heard

around election time is "there's no real choice;

you just have to nick the lesser of awo evils."

How often does it occur to us that the

lesser of two evils is siill evil? And that's

the whole point: The present election system

doesn't really give us a choice. In many cases,

"there ain't a dime's worth of difference"

berween the Democrat and Republican can-

didates.

What we need is one more pesition on the

ballot for each elective office. We need a

block labelled "NONE OF THE ABOVE"

so we can reject ALL of the "me-too" candi-

dates who offer us no real choice.

the present election system and appropriate

Editor:

Your articles in AMERICAN MERCURY have

been very interesting although those on "The

Economy" and

"The Money Supply" are

partially hogwash. I don't object when a

writer expresses. his opinion even though

different from mine. but when you make a

statement in your Newsletter which is in error

($145, Sept. 15t, 1972, last page) quote,

"for every

dollar

the national

debt

which has been manufaciured by bookkeeping

entry," you are in error. The real truth is

that the entry is not manufactured but is

very real.

The process is that the U.S. Treasurer has

a supply of unsigned engraved U.S. Govern-

ment

Bonds which when the Fed "buys

bonds"" are taken to the U.S. Treasurer who

signs them, returns them and then the Fed

"buys" them by running off on a printing

press an equivalent amount of fiat paper

iabelled "Treasury Notes" such as used by

the public. These notes are no longer "re-

deemable in lawful money of the U.S." as

they used to be because there is none. Only

a relatively small amount of illegally debased

coinage. These. notes have no value being

merely paper with ink on them.

Meanwhile, the American Public pays in-

terest on the U.S. Govemment Bonds to the

tune of over $15,000,000,000 (Fifteen Billion

Dollars) every year.

That certainly is not a nanufactured book-

keeping entry. The Treasury notes are phoney

but the Bonds in possession of the Fed are

very real, also the interesi as it comes due.

He did this to warn Brown

that he thought the Cuban Guerrilla

that he had just nailed a letter but would send anouher one rigit

away with more details as the first letter had none on the cubans.

Commanding Cfficer,

Brown ought to know it for his own safety.

The first letter from Walker only contained unimportant information

and a crazy poem.

The second letter which was written after the phone calls was

more lengthly and gave information on the Cuban Group and Walker's

reasons for thinking that the leaders are Communists

He also

asked for copies o1

Enclosed

with this report you will find a copy of some literature

wich demands, among other things, the release of all persons who were

rested in connection with activities of the Secret Army Organization.

le author of this literature is Gerald I. Smith of the National Socialist

lite People's Party.. This letter not only defends the actions of the

o but also condenns most law enforcement agencies for their parts in

prehending SAO members.

It also blames the actions of the SAo on the

slure of the authorities to

stop Leftist lawlessness. The leaflet

SUBJECTS: Activities c

Dennis Loso--Joint activ:

es of NSWPP 8e SAO.

Enclosed you will i nd a newspaper clipping & 1 photograph which

describes the opening of the John Schmitz for president headquarters

in Escondido. As described in the clipping, Dennis Loso 1s the second

nan from the right. It figured that loso would be involved in this

because he was a great Schmitz supporter long before this presidential

race. The other three men I do not know. However, there are some of

his hunting and political associates of which I could tell you something..

One is Wesley Rounds. This man hag been worked on for a long time by

Ioso. Politically, he has always tended toward the right, but loso has

succeeded in bringing him much farther along toward National Socialism.

Rounds is manager of the Californian Motel. It is located in Escondido

ut the northeast comer of. Hwy. 395 and Washington Avenue. Rounds' exact

age I do not know but I would guess him to be somewhere in his 40s.

ometime back loso took Rounds to his first William Gale service at Oneira

all in San Diego. Rounds seemed impressed with Gale.. Nes is married.

Another man who periodically visits loso is Al MeDonald.. Al is 40

"ears old and is a friendly, congènial type of person, He 1s single and

spends much of his

time in Montana "living the good life." In never he

runs low on money, he comes down to Escondido

and works for Dennis for

3, while. He claims that he managed to live on just 93,000 last year.

IcDonald also spends a fair amount of time living in Montague, Califomia.

this town is located in Siskiyou County near the Oregon border. MeDonald's

parents also live there. they very much disapprove

of his Nazi sympathies.

m one occasion, his Mother lound a large swastika in his cabin nile he

asn't there.. She threw it in his wood burning stove and would have burmed

It except that she couldn't find any matches. His most recent visit to

iscondido

was in July and August at which time he gave the swastika flag

10 Loso for safe keeping. Loso allowed McDonald to stay rent free in

one of his unoccupied apartments.

I learned from Gerald Smith recently that as long as one year ago,

there were joint target practice sessions. between members of the NSWPP

and the SAO. The site of these little excursions was the Gunsmoke Fanch.

serald says the place is virtually a stronghold of the Minutemen, Farti-

ipants in the target shooting sessions nost frequently were Gerald Smith,

Ray Wilson, Urs. Ray Wilson, Stanley Lcdade, Jerry Lynn Davis and Georse

1. Hoover. Gerald says Hoover is a crack shot with either a rifle or

pistol. Gerald himself qualified as an expert rifle shot in the service.

Dear Mir. Shroder:

In connection with the investigation and prosecution of the

shooting of Paula Tharp, for which Geroge M. Hoover has been indicted,

I have received correspondence from Mr. Hewicker of the San Diego

County District Attorney's Office asking whether I would be willing to

testify in this matter.

The purpose of this testimony would be to

substantiate the reliability of Howard Godfrey as an informant and to

provide information as to the custody of the weanon involved. I have

Indicated to Mr. Hewicker that I would not be unwilling to furnien

such testimony but would be somewhat reluctant due to my present

circumstances. It would appear to me that the interests of the Bureau

and the District Attorney's Office, as well as myself, would be better

served if this informstion was furnished by someone still connected

with the FBI. Godfrer's reliability should be a matter of record to

which Earl Petersen could easily testify. Furthermore Mr. Petersen

has some first-hand knowlege as to the location of the weadon, and,

because of the nature of the incident, I imagine my testimony

in this

respect would need

as much substantiating as Godfrey's.

Another decided disadvantage for me would be the disclosure

_ of my oresent whereabouts to individuals such as representatives of the

"Door", to whom you made reference in your letter of the Fifteenth.

I do not desire to be located or contacted by thase or similar neoble.

However, if this should occur, I intend to state merely that I left

the Bureau on the adyice of my personal physician, which would have

been an actuality within a period of a few weeks or months anyway.

I would certainly appreciate it if such a course of action

as I have mentioned could be made feasible.

Sincerely!

GENERAL, HEADQUARTERS

JUNE 1972

'" The people never give up their liberties but under some delusion". Edmund Burle

Fellow members,

At a recent meeting of the SAO General Staff a very important problem was discusse

and the decision to issue a nev Organizational Directive made. The problem is tha: of

new members who join our organization and then immediately become totally inactive.

Typically these new members submit a well qualified application form together with

their membership fee. Unfortunately, after being accepted, as provisional members

they never pay a month's dues or send in any report forms.

It would really heip us to

know why some of these people have acted in this way. Did our organization turn out

to be something different than they expected? Did they expect a fancy uniform and rial:

to be handed to them on a silver platter ? Or did they suddenly become afraid to stick

their neck out ?

Whatever the reasons, it isn't fair to our good members to waste time and money cr

those who do nothing to help or support the organization.

Therefore, effective imes-

iately, the following rules shall apply to such cases as mentioned above.

1. If, three months after submitting an application to the SAO and being accapid 2!

a provisional member, the new member has not begun the basic correspondence trainin

submitted monthly report forms, paid monthly dues, or provided a reasonabic encura

for not having done the above, their file shall be turned over to our Intelligence Section

for special attention.

2. If, after six months, the member in question dosen't respond they shall be dro.

from our rolls and their names shall be circulated to all members as a potential see i

risti.

We don't mean to imply that a member can't resign from the Secret Army Diganisiti

However, we do require that a monther notity us of there intent and reasons fi dui::

If this new Organizational Directive applies to any member in particular let hire laid ir.

and govern himself accordingly.

HOW TO FREPARE GUNS FOR STORAGE & BURYING

Although cosmoline can be purchased in many surplus stores, ii may be more

practical to make your own from the following directions. Ore advantage to malang

your own preparation is that it is much easier to apply while it is in a warm state.

Heat non-bleached petroleum jelly (ember-vaseline) in a small pan or can. Add

30 or 40 weight motor oil to obtain the proper consistency. Using an inexpensive

throw-away paint brush as an applicator, brush the warm solution over the weapon.

While the solution is still warm it can also be poured into those hard-to-get-at-areas.

One large jar of peiroleum jelly and approximately one-hali quart of motor oil

is surficient to prepare several weapons.

When the solution has cooled it will set and form a protective coating over the

weapon which should then be wrapped in sheet plastic ( available in most hardere or

paint stores) or in a G.i. plastic gun case (available in inost supplus stores ). Wrap

well and seal with black elecirical or plastic tape. : It is also wise to enclose a small

sach of silicagel crystals to keep the moisture out.. These crystals can be purchased

at any industrial chemical house or most applicance stores will give them away as they

come with cartons of appliances when shipped and they usually have an abundanca on

supply.

Long guns which cannot be easily torn down can be stored in surplus rocket type

boxes readily available in most surplus stores.

Try to obtain aluminum or stainless

: steel containers since they will not tend to rust when buried. 20mm ammunition cans

are adequate and a convenient size container for burying smaller weapons and other

items. They should be well sealed. The cans should be wrapped in plastic io prevent

rust.

Buried containers should haye ai least one and a half fest of earth over them. Oue

should be careful also in selecting an area to bury material. Areas that could be tooted !

during even the most unusual weather conditions should be avoided.

Buried containers should be in such a position that they can be found easily and

quickly ivithout the use of maps. This can be done by correlacion babween two oi mera

specific points that will remain in tact, such as trees, large rocks, etc. To assis:

your memory, paces should be marked eif by using the day, month, and year of your

birth or that oi some family member which you can easily remember.

Another suggestion would be for burying contuiners along or near rondways which

are marked with numbered signs indicating the foolage of road per county.

Those 44:25

are permanent, but it must be remonibered thut the state has a 500 foot right arog en

most roads which means tha brush may be cleared or the existing road might he widened.

All material which is buried should be chocied within three tn sis works for souls

or sinking of the ground.

GENERAL RULES OF GUERRILLA WA

4RB

1. The first rule of guerrilla warfare is to dispense with any

rule or set of rulas which results in routine or predicable activity.

Any time the enemy conmander can anticipate what the guerrilla band

will do next, ha can then lay a trap by which his supariority of

numbers and equipment may be brought to bear upon then with devasta

ting effect.

2. Military action by guerrilla bands cannot achieve maximun

effect unless intalligence and security capabilities are developed to

an equal degree of perfection, principally through the cooperation of

friendly nor-combatants.

3. Propaganda warfare is one of tha guerrillas most effective

weapons. It must be waged continuously to decoralize the eramy,

enlist support of the civilian population and to justify the existence

•and actions of the guerrilla bands.

4. Each member of the underground movement must be rendered: :

Immune to the enemy's propagenda by continuous counter-propaganda.

They nust realize that the enemy is certain to spread lies about their

leaders, to try and break the bands up by encouraging petty jealousies

and dissensions, to make them feel their fight is hopeless, to encoursge

then to get on the winning side, to offer mercy and rewards to those

sho voluntarily surrendei.

Most of all enemy propaganda will be aimed

as destroying the individual organization nembar's faith in the honesty,

capability and true.motives.of other members of the underground nove-

ment.

5.

Surprise is the main element of successful guerrilla warfare.

No matter how vigilant the enemy may be there will be times your band

can take hin by surprise. Perhaps he is tired, perhaps sleeping,

perhaps he is in an area where he feels so completely safe that he

lets down his guard-- that's when you hit him.

6. •Any guerrilla that wants to keep on living aust constantly

remind himself that war is not a sporting proposition never give the

communists an

even break.

7. Genarally speaking guerrillas must work in sall bands. From

five to flfteen Is usual but even here its best not to gei into a rut.

If the encay commander in your area knows you always work in small

groups he can then divide his available anti-guerrilla forces into.

groups of 1s to 25 and thus cover more ground than if he had to main-

tain groups of two or three hundred to make certain his forces would

always out number any guerrilla band they happened ucon.

8. The guerrilla leader must always keep its chiaking one atep

ahead of the enemys.

Hace are some exemples:

apparently dead, aprailed in

ne middle of

the highway.

The car stops and the enomy cificois got out to in-

vestigate.

Suedenly the "corpse" rolls over and cues them down

with a machin gun.

This little trick might work several times but eventually the

enemy will figure ir out.

The driver of a truck full of erony troops

sees a "corpse" lying in the road.

Quickly he stops the truck. The

troops pile out of the truck and riddle the "corpse" with bullets.

Too late they discover its only a dummy made of old clothes and straw.

They are caught in a murderous crois-fire between guerrillas hidden

along both sides of the road.

Post are killed but one lives long

enough to

tell what happened.

A few days later another truc! of troops sees a "corpse" lying

in the middle of the highway.

The driver has been forewarned so he

knows better than to stop. Instead he steps on the gas, runs over

the dummy as he speeds on around the next. curve in the road- perhaps.

into a hidden land-mine. Or perhaps into a chain stretched between

two trees.

Or perhaps onto a part of the highway that has been

covered with fresh oil which sends the truck skidding over an embank-

ment.

What will the next truck full of troops do? What can you figure

out so you will still ba thinking one step ahead of the enemy?

9. Generally speaking the guerrilla band must avoid suparior

forces. When attacked by a superior force the guerrillas must quickly

• retreat or disperse.

Nhen the

enemy stops, they may return to harass

him-- or perhaps they won't. When the enemy is exhausted they may

attack-- but again they may not. When the enemy retreats the guerrillas

may give chase-- but only if they can be very sure they are not being

led into a trap.

10. Guerrillas must always fight at a time and place of their own

choosing-- never at a time or place of the enemy's choosing.

* 11. Before any raid on enemy troops or installations the guerrilla

leader must obtain complete and accurate intelligence on the number

of

the enemy on hand, the number near enough to ba called on for assistance,

amount and type of enemy armament. location of sentries, scouts or

protective patrols and all other information that will effect the plan-

ning of conduct of the raid.

12. All raids against the enemy must be exactly planned and cara-

fully rehearsed. It is aftin desirable to draw a miniature copy of che

enemy installation so that all memburs of the raiding party can play

out their respeciiv: duties severa: times to make sure they do rot

forget or become cor.fused in the heat of battle.

13. Evirything that could josibly so wron; must be anticipated

nd alcernare plans made to cope ..irh any evencunlily.

14. Guerrillas

should strike a violent ligh

ng blow that leaves

the enemy stunned

at least long enouji for them to male a safe retreat.

15. In no case must tha guerrilias allow themselves to be drawn

Into a long pitched battle wich enemy ercops.

16. So long as friendly forces of the conventional military

are able to retain their offensive potential it is expedient for

guerrilla forces to coordinate their activities with such friendly

troops.

17. Guerrilla bands must always nove in secret - their whereabouts

must always be hidden from the civilian population as well

aspiron

-enemy troops.

• 18. When possible always attack the enemy at places which are

distant from centers of population as this will reduce the possibility

of his making reprisals against friendly civilians.

19. If a lone enemy soldier is way-laid in the city or suburbs it

is best

to carry his body. away where it can be buried and the grave

camouflaged so his commander will not know whether he has been killed

or has deserted. Take his uniform and hide it carefully where it can

be later retrieved. It might come in handy.

20. The guerrillas must always operate in their home territory

where they have intimate knowledge of their surroundings. If driven

from their own territory by a superior enemy force they should return

as soon as they safely can, provided that their main hida-out has not

been discovered and there is no chance of an enemy ambush.

21. Guerrillas must make every effort to stay friendly with any

civilian population in their territory as the civilians may be their

best source of food, other supplies, or valuable information about

nearby enemy forces.

22. It is almost essential that the guerrilla band have at least

one secure hide-out where they can test up, store their supplies and

care for their wounded.

This hide-out may be in some large forest or

mountainous area but such is not always necessary. During World War II

one Russian guerrilla band had their headquarters in a storm sewer.

Another band headquartered in the basement of a hospital in one of the

smaller towns. Another operated from an abandoned coal nine.

23. The guerrilla band should have one or more alternate hide-outs

and be ready to move quickly and quietly to another prepared location

in case their main headquarters is discovered. To preserve maximum

security the location of these alternate hide-outs should be known to

the least possible number af their own band.

24. To operate successfully over long periods of time tho

guerrilla band must have plunty of space in which to manuever-

preferably a large enough area that the enemy is incapable of

covering all of it with anti-guerrilla forces at one cime.

25. Guer.

activity is must suilably e

aucted in muuncsins,

swamp and other

nas of tarrain that are inace

ible to tanks,

large guns and

mechanired forces nut with proper strategy at least

some guurrilla activity can be suited to almost any type area- even

large cities. Furthermore, due to the widespread use of ligit weight

weapons such as the bazouka and recoilless rifle it must be capecied

that mountains will piovida somewhat less protection to guerrillas

in future wars than they have in the past.

Therefore it is essential.

that underground activity be directed against the enemy under every

possible condition and ovar the widest possible area so as to prevent

his concentrating iis forces for a complate "mop-up" operation in

any one district.

26. Guerrilla furces cannut ordinarily afford to take prisoners.

If you are lucky enough to captura a high-ranking officer or party

official he may ba held for ransom or as

a hostage to guarantee against

extreme brutality by the enary or raprisals by the enomy against tha

civilian population. With extreme caution he may be traded for

guerrillas held prisoner by the enemy.

Most commonly any captured enemy must be shot. If prisoners are

taken they must ba kept in chains and closely guarded day and night.

If one were to escape he would certainly lead the enemy back to your

hideout.

27. Due to their superior forces, the

enemy may make several.

mistakes and still fight affectively.

For the guerrilla band a single

mistake may lead to complete annihilation. Therefore every activity

must be conducted with extreme caution and complete secrecy.

28. Guerrillas must be extremaly tidy housekeepers. Garbage

thrown out around camp may attract birds which in turn may alert the

enemy. A tin can, carelessly tossed aside may catch the sun just

right to be seen by a

scouting airplane. While on the march a bioken.

branch

or a thoughtlessly dropped maich cover may give your presence

away to the enemy who could radio ahead to set up an ambush.

29.. Each member of the band must be constantly alert that his

own action does nor give away the guerrilla position to the enemy.

In remote areas the smeli of smoke may carry for many miles.

Even

cigarette smoke can give away cha sentries position to a quistly

approaching enemy scout:

can be seen

for 300 yards. "ith a good pair of binoculars it can

be seen for

a mile.

30. A single carloss or obstinate member must not be allowan to

endanger the lives of the ocher membars of the band.

31. Gucrrilla forces canont afford defeat and are poorly

equipped to care for casualties.

Therafore, action against the

enemy must be Laken only under such condicions as insure maxinum

usual sense.

Instead they sack to dominate the territory by con•

tinuous raids, ambushas

sed harassment of enemy croops to such an

extent that continued occupation by enemy forces is no lorger osti

the price they must pay.

36. Success in guerrilla warfare depends largely on superios

mobility.

Transport and movement are therefora of great importance to the

guerrilla band. So long as the civilian population is allowed to usa

their automobiles the suecrillas can (wich forged identity cards)

do likewise. If the civilion population Is rigidly controlled ot

largely enslaved then the guerrillas must depend on. other machods of

transportation.

Bands that must move on foot are limited in the distance over which

thay can operate. Possible targets for sabotage must be within two

or three nights narcin. Even chen cha guarrillas are apt to be badi;

fatigued before they go into action and they will have trouble gacting

away without being discovered,

Suppose that a guerrilla scout reports that a poorly guasied

supply column is camped 30 milos awa:.

The guerrilla band may sead

these supplies desperately but it they must travel by foot the enemy

will likely have moved on before they can get there. These are

serious problems for which eaci band nus" find solutions depanding

on their own conditions and tacricory.

37. Close cooperation beiveen different bands is seldom roquired

and may be undesirable. Tacrefore it is more important that coini

cation between bands be secure than choi it be fast.

38. Each guerrilla tend is rasponsible for its own actions et:

41. Hit-or-miss sabotage is not nearly as effective as coordin-

ated sabotage that strikes systematically at some few essential

industries of activities vital to the enemy at that particular tine.

42. Targets for raids and sabotage must be carefully selected to

achieve maximum damage to the enemy with least risk to the guerrilla

band. If the eneny has an abundance of guns but is. low on ammunition

then burning a warchouse full of guns will not count for much whereas

burning a warehouse full of armunition would ba a vital blow.

43. Each military action against the enemy must be planned in such

a manner that the amount of armunition and supplies captured are at

least enough to replenish the amount expended in that action.

44. Both offensive and defensive guerrilla activity is vitally

dependent upon accurate knowledge of the enemy's strength, location,

movements and so far as possible his intentions which is usually

best obtained first hand by guarrilla scouts.

.'

45. In the event that troops have settled down in the guerrilla

area for a long and routine occupation, efforts should be made to

determine whether or not they are completely loyal to the foreign

Ideology before antagonizing a possible potential ally.

46. The guerrilla must be continuously imagining himself in the

shoes of his enemy.

He must get to know how the enemy is likely to

•react in any given situation.

He must be able to guess what the

enemy commander will expect his band to do next. In this way he can

often anticipate what the enemy will do. By then acting in some

totally unexpected manner he can continuously catch the enemy in a

series of embarrassing situations.

47. Guerrilla forces must remain widely dispersed throughout the

entire area of enemy occupation. They must never accumulate in large

numbers in a given area that the enemy can surround and eventually

starve them out or gradually close in on them.

48. Guerrilla forces must be always alert to possible anti-

guerrilla action. that may be taken against them and constantly

•Prepared to take suitable evasive action...

49. The guerrilla bands most essential function is to guarantee

its own continuation. The very existance of the guerrilla band

. requires the enemy to guard against then and in so doing they are

drained of manpower, supplies and equipment which the enemy forces

50. Clear-cut victory is seldom possible either with or against

guerrilla warfare-- the side that hoids out longest will be the

ultimate winner.

PLASTIC

Potassium Chlorate

Petroleum Jelly (Vascline)

A round wooden stick or rolling pin

Spread the Potassium Chlorate thinly on a hard surface. Roll the round stick (rulling pin) over the

crystals to crush them into a very fine powder (until it looks like face powder). Take 9 parts of the.

powdered Potassium Chlorata and one part of vaseline, and kread them together until a uniform

paste is obtained. Detonate with a blasting cap or with a .30 caliber fused blank.

BLACK POWDER

Potassium Nitrate - 25 parts

Charcoal - 3 parts

Sulphur - 2 parts

Dissolve the Potassium Nitrate in an equal amount of water. Pulverize the charcoal and sulphur.

and add the Potassium Nitrate solution to obtain a thoroughly wet paste. Allow to dry.

FAST BURNING FUSE

Twist soft cotten string into three strands. Moisten black powder to form a paste and rub the

paste into the twisted string. Burns 30 to 40 inches per minute.

SLOW BURNING FUSE

Dissolve one part of Potassium Nitrate or Potassium Chlorate and one part of sugar (granulated)

in two parts of hot water.

Soak the string in this solution. Twist the string into three strands and

allow to dry. Burns about 2 inches per minute.

• FUSES

Fuses can be made by soaking course paper in a solution of gun powder and acutone (nail polish re-

mover) overnight, then drying. Cut strips and twist together. Alsn, by coating a cotton string with

a sticky substance, then dipping into gunpowder, coating all surfaces. A time delay fuse that can

be used without a match is made as follow's: Make a small pile of potassium permanginate and make

a small pile of it on the ground, making a hole in the center of it. Next pour in the hole about an

equal amount of straight glycerine. A flash will occur in about one minute. This mothod is best

used when gun powder has to be used as a fuse... or for starting fires.

JELLIED GASOLINE

Pour the contents of one bottle (1 pint 3 o%.) of Dynamo concentrated liquid laundry delergent into a

bucket or large mouthed can of about two to five gallon size. Fill the detergent bottle twice, shaking

well to rinse it out with gasoline (any grace) and ace it to the detergent. You will now have about

3 1/2 pints (57 07) of material in the bucket. The detergent will be at the bottomandthe gasoline on

the top. Stir this rapidly with a wooden or wire paddle so as to mix in as much air as possible. Soun

the mixture will take on the appearance of soft vasoline.

Now add in a gallon of gasoline and stir again until the mixture thickens. At this point, transfer the

mixture to clean containers. No return iype beer and soda bottles are ideal. For chemical land

nines, use two gallon oil cans.

The container should be filled approximately one third full of the

mixture.

Finish filling the container with gasoline leaving a little air space at the top.

Place your

finger or hand over the opening and shake well until the gasoline and mixture amalgamate. You can

verify this by looking at the finger or hand occasionally lo see if a film of jellied gasoline about an

eighth of an inch thick clings to it. When proper consistency is reached, the bottles may be capped or

corked. Cans should have tight fitting lids screwed on.

This may be stored up to two weeks. Tie

a rag around the neck of each bottle being careful not to leave the ends of the rag too long or too loose.

If necessary, this mixture can be "eut" SU.? with gasoline or other petroleum product. The tendency

to "cling" will sutter slightly, but consistency can he maintained by pouring off the excess gasoline

whenever the detergert refuses to "take" any more.

To use, saturate the rag with gasoline or the mixture from the bottle.

Keep the flamable material

off of your person and clothing. Lighi the rag with match or cigarette lighter and immediately serve.

Throw hard against a solid object such as masonry, concrete. or metal.

In using the mixture in

a chemical land mine, wrap three or four wraps of pri macord around a to gallon can and tie the prim:

acord under the can around a pound of explosive. This may be exploded either electricaily ir by a per-

cussion such as a booby trap device or anti-personell fuse.

Do not contact wires to the blasting

machine until after you have carefully removed all traces of your work and camouflaged the position.

Never us any plastic article in contact with the above mixture.

ARMOUR PIERCING BULLETS

Reloaders can drop a 25 caliber steel ball bearing into a . 30 caliver bullet mould and thus have an

armour piercing bullet. It is also a duplex bullet as the ball bearing will keep going after the lead

has stopped.

We granted the interview with the newspaper women I wrote you about. It should be

out in a week or so, will send you a copy when its printed.

We really put on a show for

this girl, the seciet contact, mceting place, radio communications, etc. The whole secret

agent bit. During the intervic she told us that the police had been out to see her after the

first article. The San Diego Police wanted to know syno she had talked too (we mailed the

information for the first story to her). Later she had a visit from the feds asking her if

she would infiltrate our organization for them. They must be getting hard up for information

when they have to go out and try to recruit people.

This girl might be alright, but we are

not going to trust her anyway. Its getting here I can count the people I trust on one hand

and still have four fingers leît.

••

Enclosed are three more letters for you, two wrong addresses, and one hate letter.

Just so you will not think that you are the only one who gets these letters, I have enclosed

one ive received a few days ago. If the literture we send out gets these types (religous

nuts and love creeps) so upset, then we must be on the right track.

Sorxy about the delay in mailing you the May Bulletins, we just did not have

the funds to pay for the printing until now. If nothing go's wrong we will be able

to print-up the Security Training Program and your Mail Drop Transier Letter

this coming weekend. Hope to have the funds available for the Special Bulletin

the following weekend.

I have enclosed a copy of the first part of the newspaper interview we gave.

Will send you the other articles as they are printed. The way we understand it

is that it will be a three piece article, The first one is not to bad. We have

been receiving articles from other papers in the area too, but they have all been

of the smear type.

On the subject of bulletins; when would you be able to write another one, and

what subject would you be covering. Also would like for you to write the foremat

(one or two pages) for some of the bulletins. We have been trying to keep the

bulletins between 10 to 12 pages long. The only original bulletin we have put-out

so far is the one you wrote on lock picking. I am fairly good at stealing material

and rewriting it, but have trouble writing anything orginal.

Would like to set-up another meeting with you in the near future. There are

some things we need to talk over with you that we cannot put in a letter. Let me

know when you will have some time off and we will try to make some arrangements.

The shit hit the fan here this week again. We put out a Special Bulletin containing

information about some of the San Diego City officials. The fuzz was out to see me two

days after we mailed it out. They told me that the city had assigned to detectives on

full time duty to keep an eye on SAO activities. The left fired bombed one of their own

cars and tryed to blame it own us, plus one of the city councilmen received a threating

phone call. The detectives told me that one high ranking left winger had call the police

and demanded they assign him policemen to protect him.

We have been making some real good headway in setting up new groups in California.

Some of the new people we are getting are working out real well, others are the hanger-on

types. We are having a little trouble with some DePugh types up in Los Angeles. They

don't like the idea of us organizing up there. If they start any trouble we will give then

more than they are looking for, you can bet on that.

We should have the May Underground Bulletin ready to mail out to you by the first of

the month. We are reprinting the Communications Bulletin. Rewrote it to fit our group.

If we have the money I will try to print up both of the letters at the same time.

Sorry to here about you being out of work again, no how it is trying to make ends meet.

I can only draw eight unemployment checks then I will have to go back to work. Sure wish

some fat cat would finance a few of us to work full time on organization activities. Guess

there is no danger of that thou.

SECRET ARMY ORGANIZATION

SPECIAL BULLETIN

As most of the citizens of San Diego County are no doubt aware many liberals, pinks,

reds, and other fuzzy thinking types. will be bringing themselves and there gas masks here

in August for a "peaceful" protest during the Republican National Convention.

While local left-wing groups are preparing for the "peaceful" protest by stock piling

gas masks, flak vests, firearms and ammunition the city of San Diego is rolling out the

red carpet (aptly named) for these profession revolutionaries. Yes, as strange as it

may seem some members of the San Diego City government are going out of their way to

make sure these communist revolutionaries are made welcome here.

Mavourneen O'Connor, twin sister of City Councilwomen MAUREEN O'CONNOR

• (Home address: 5821 Lauretta, San Diego, Telephone: 295-8693), is one of the more

prominent members of the community who is engaged in this strange behavior. Miss

O'Connor is employed by the Southern California First National Bank as a Community

Relations officer, taking time off last year to run the campaign of her sister Maureen.

Her new duties are setting up a central headquarters for the protestors to use during

the convention. The Unconventional Center (also aptly named) is to be this headquarters.

Located at the corner of Jefferson and Riley Streets just six blocks from the Sports Arena

• •

the site of the convention, the 7, 800 foot warehouse is being stocked with the expected

services that may be needed by the protestors.

These include; transportation, facilities

for the printing of propaganda, a telephone message center, legal aid services, and a

medical aid center:

These last two are odd, considering its to be a "peaceful" protest.

The bill for all this is being picked up by the Southern California First National

Bank who's chairman is ROBERT OSCAR PETERSON (Home address: 567 Gage Lane,

San Diego, Telephonc: 222-1835). Mr. Peterson has not always been a supporter of

these left-wing type activities, in fact as late as January 1970 he was on the recciving

end of a smear article done by the San Diego STREET JOURNAL. The Strect Journal

for those citizens lucky cnough not to have seen an issue is one of many pro-communist

underground newspapers that operate in the San Dicgo area.

The article on Peterson exposed his business dealings with a number of large com-

panies; Foodmaker Corporation (owners of Jack In The Box drive-ins), and the Ralston

Purin: Corporation among others. At the end of the article the Street Journal made the

NW 68262408610132985525pagearticle would expose other of his business dealings.

---

## Page 414

Needless to say, the article never appeared.

One can only wonder now that Mr.

Peterson is supporting these same type of people if some kind of blackmail was not used.

Many of the members of the staff of the street Journal live at a commune supported by

the paper at 173 4th Avenue in Chula Vista.

The first news conference of the Unconventional Center was attended by these noted

prominent

city officials: Couneilmen Gil Johnson and Jim Bates, and city manager Kimball

Moore.

Others not quite so prominent attending were a long haired representative from

the Community Congress and Shari Whitehead, 24, a representative from the Convention

Coalition. The Convention Coalition is the group that plans to coordinate the activities of

protestors expected to arrive for the convention. While Mayor Wilson was not able to

attend this inceting in person he later made this comment on Mavourneen O'Connor's pro-

demonstration activities " I commend her for her energy and her efforts ".

• Of all the organizations preparing to protest at the convention the Convention Coal-

ition is probably the most active.

Some of the leaders of the coalition are: Peter Bohmer,

the off again, on again, economics professor at San Diego State, seen recently at 4931

Coronado Street, San Diego: Michael Kenneth, address $777 Fairmont, San Diego; Pam

Williams, also seen at the Coronado Street address: and last, but not least, Doug Porter,

recently seen at 2445 Albatross, San Diego. Headquarters for the coalition are at 309

6th Street in San Diego.

While the Intelligence Branch of the San Diego Police Department has reported to

city officials the militant activities (stock piling weapons and explosives) of these leftest

groups the city fathers have annoy all warnings. Instead of spending every dime the

city can spare on weapons and equipment to help the police put down a possible riot the

powers to be believe the money can better be spent for SENSITIVITY TRAINING.

While the left is planing a full scale'battle the public officials of San Diego spend the

tax payers money on sensitivity training for the police department. And guess who they

pick to teach this garbage, a foreign born (Iran) Professor of Psychology who was kicked

off the staff at San Diego State because of his profanity and teaching of left-wing views.

JAUAD EMAMI was a Assistant Professor at SDS before having been removed, he and

his wife Minou live at 3850 American Avènue in La Mesa. The 5'10", 190 pound, black

hair, brown eye professor was educated at UCLA and the University of Arizona. Emami

drives a white van (California %MJ 151) and is payed $25 an hour to teach our policemen

to talk nice to these creeps that will be invading San Diego in August.

• Instead of hiring this fuzy headed professor the SAO believes the City of San Diego

should have hired Lieutenant Cally, then at least the police would have receiyed some

expert training on how to handled RED TRAITORS.

Dear Mr. Gibson:

As I am a former FBI Agent, one of my friends forwarded

to me information which she received through the mail from

a "Secret Army Organization."

You probably have this back-

ground information, but if not, I felt that it deserves

your consideration

and attention.

Mrs. Lusk does not know why the literature was forwarded

to

her.

She is employed by the Pacific Telephone Company

and several weeks ago she wrote a letter to the Editor

which was published in the Union Iribune on the subject of

amnesty for the draft dodgers.

If you desire any further information concerning this matter,

please give me a call.

Very truly yours,

Dear Fellow American,

At the request of a mutual friend we are sending you this invitation to

Join the Secret Army Organization.. Those of us who have been members for

some time sincerely believe that our organization can be of real value in pre-

serving for future generations the land of freedom and opportunity which our

forefathers handed down to us.

It is the belief of our organization that the communist-socialist con-

spiracy has infiltrated the United States Government to such an extent that the

American people cannot rely on this country's elected leaders to protect them

from communist domination and slavery.

We believe that the time will come when the American people will have

to fight for their lives and their liberty. In this belief, we have formed in

advance a secret underground army with but one objective, to defend our con-

stitutional republic and to help our fellow Americans to do the same.

We do no want lukewarm members. We are an organization of people

willing to make any sacrifice necessary for our country. If you feel the same

way, we invite you to join us.

Mistory of

Secret Army Organiz

DiY

Oue carly morning in February, 1070, a group of six Minutemen leaders from

four states mot secretly in Northern Arizona to discuss the crisis that the arrest and

imprisonment of two top MI:nutemen leaders and the assassination of a third had

brought on the organization. Although some of these men had met before in their roles

as Minutemen group leaders, others were meeting for the first time.

After much discussion, two principal points were agreed upon. First, that the

Minutemen as a national coordination organization of militant right-wing groups had

effectively been destroyed by the pro-communist ciements inside the Justice Depart-

ment. While individual units still existed throughout the country, few had the financial

support or leadership to be really effective. Second, that the need for such a coordi-

nating organization wasgreater than ever in view of the increased revolutionary activity

by communists in the United States.

With these two points in mind, suggestions were pit forward on a course of

action to be followed. After a meeting that lasted all that day and far into the next

morning, an overall plan of action was finally agreed upon. All present agreed to

merge their individual units together and form a new organization under the command

of one leader elected from among themselves, with the other five to be members of a

General Staff that would advise and assist the new leader.

While retaining the basic programs and policies of the Minutemen, it was

decided that not only should this new organization have a different name, but also a

completely new chain of command and organizational structure. If the new organiza-

tion was

going to survive the attacks that befell the old one, a whole new approach

would be needed. Never again could the arrestor death of a few leaders be allowed to

cripple the entire organization.

For this reason it was decided that only a highly disciplined military type

orgainization with a definite chain of command would have any chance of success. This

then, was the beginning of the Secret Army Organization. Beginning with an original

force of hard corepatriots that numbered fewer than two hundred, the Secret Army

Organization began the job of picking up the pieces and continuing to fight for national

and individual freedom. Using this cadre of dedicated personnel as a nucleus, the

S. A. O. has becn rccruiting and training new members in the skills they will need as

the freedom fighters of tomorrow.

The leaders of the S. A. O. have no idea of fighting a last ditch stand. We have

no desire to commit suicide ourselves or to let our members do so. We have a

strategy which we believe will ultimately lead to victory. Ouly one thing is essential.

We must start preparing and training NOW! We of the S. A. O. believe that our country

is worthy of any sacrifice. If you fecl the same way, we invite you to join us.

TO P

pective Members Of The

SECRET ARMY ORGANIZATION

The Secret Army Organization is the most active, most complctcly dedicated and

most selective in its membership of all the many patriotic organizations in America.

We are willing to make any sacrifice for our country and ie fully expect that some of

us will have to make the ultimate sacrifice before victory is achieved. Our very lives

depend on each other. There is no place in this organization for bunglers, playboys or

lukewarm conservatives. If you join the Secret Army Organization, there might easily

come a time that your life would depend on how competently some other member had

• learned his job.

Unless you are

especially well informed on the domestic and world political

situation, it is probable that you have a lot to learn about the present threat our nation

faces. Unless you have had many years experience in actual underground warfare,

there is undoubtedly a lot you can learn from the experts in our organization who have

developed and supervised our training program.

OUR NATION IS IN IMMEDIATE DANGER

It is possible that within a very few years, perhaps even within months, our

nation could be conquered and enslaved by the communists. To prevent this we must

know as much as possible about our enemies. Unless we know who they are and what

they are doing we will not succeed in our efforts to maintain a free America.

THE RESISTANCE MOVEMENT

In driving an invader from your land the resistance involved goes through three

stages of development.

1) The Underground Network

2)

Active Guerrilla Warfare

• 3) Open or Conventional Warfare

The conventional warfare stage uses everything in the way of weapons that the

enemy does but must also have active guerrillas and underground agents working against

the enemy, too. In the present state of military tactics conventional warfare cannot

succeed unless these other two ingredients are used simultaneously.

The first step is to form an underground network. An active guerrilla system

must have the support of an underground network of approximately three times its own

size. This underground must supply the active guerrilla fighter with supplies, con-

cealment, information, etc. An underground network starts with departments of

intelligence, security and propaganda in that order.

Sabotage, espionage, subversion, infiltration, escape and evasion, training,

clandestine fabrication of supplies, counterfciting encmy documents, recruiting, com-

munications and propaganda are

other phases of underground activily. Each member

of the Secret Army Organization, to be cilective, must have a working knowledge of

all these tactics as well as the military tactics more commonly associated with guerril-

Ia activities.

## Page 423

ASSIGNMENT TO UNITS

Many people that inquire about membership in the Secret Army Organization

scem to have an idea that they will be immediately accepted into an active unit.

Look at it this way. Suppose you had spent a year or more carcfully recruiting and

training until you had a hard hitting team where every individual was rcliable, dedi-

cated, and had contidence in his fellow unit members. Wouldn't it make you mad to

have the national or regional organization assign some rank amateur to your unit

that you you knew little or nothing about?

Before any new member is assigned to an active unit or to an important under-

ground project, hemistundergo a period of training. During this training he will be

directed through the mails by an experienced member and some of his activities may

be observed by other members without his knowiedge. Only when a new member

proves himself to be conscientious, trustworthy, self-disciplined and able to operate

effectively alone will he be accepted as a "secure member" and invited to participate

with other unit members in a teamwork operation.

EXPENSES

Unfortunately, most good things don't come cheap. Although we make every

effort to keep down the expense of membership in the Secret Army Organization, you

must expect to pay your own way.

Dues to the Secret Army Organization are $3.00 per month. This money is

absolutely necessary for use to maintain our central files and headquarters, for

postage and printing, to finance our extensive intelligence network, and to maintain

training areas.

Each member will have other expenses depending on the type of activity he is

engaged in. Every member will be expected to buy his own gun, amnunition and

other basic combat equipment. During training the new member may be expected to

buy certain books or subscribe to certain magazines that his work requires. During

this time the new member will also be supplied with reading material on the strategy

and tactics of guerrilla warfare. This home work will make it possible for him to

fit in quickly to an active unit and participate effectively in actual maneuvers,

marksmanship training, etc.

following this preliminary training a member may be either assigned to an.

existing unit, assisted in organizing his own unit if he has shown sufficient leadership

qualities or become part of an underground network.

Upon your acceptance into the Secret Army Organization you will be given a

definite scries of projects described inwriting so you will know exactly what will be

expected of you.

We hope that you can succed in this effort because your country desperately

needs patriots at this time.

NIXON

DESCRIPTION

FULLNAME: Richard Milhous Nixon. DATE OF BIRTII: January 9, 1913 at Yorba Linda,

California. FORMER OCCUPATIONS: Used car salesman, law clerk, second rate congress-

man, and mediocre Vice President. PRESENT OCCUPATION: Professional liar and double

crosser (part time employment as United States President). WEIGHT: 170 pounds. EYES:

brown. HAIR: black. HEIGHT: 5'11", ' RACE: White. NATIONALITY: Claims American

citizenship but actions prove this unlikely. LAST KNOWN ADDRESS: 1600 Pennsylvania

Avenue, Washington, D.C. (Rumored to have a California hideout. )

CRIMINAL RECORD

RICHARD NIXON (alias Cry-Baby Nixon, alicas Tricky Dicky) is an expert in disguises and

has successfully passed himself off as an anti-communist in the past. He may again try using

this disguise if pressed for votes in 1972. Saying one thing, then doing the opposite is Nixon's

MOA. While he campaigned in 1968 on a platform of curtailing socialism he has in fact done

more to establish a socialistic dictatorship than either of the last two Democrat administra-

tions. His economic policies have continued to enrich Big Industrialists while rising prices

and higher taxes have all but reduced the average worker to a state of financial slavery. This

criminal has even made vicious attacks on small children (forced busing to acheive "racial

balance"') and has caused the destruction of local school systems. WARNING: Nixon suffers

from an EMPEROR COMPLEX and becomes extremely dangerous when criticized.

CAUTION

Trickery and deceit are Nixon's trade-marks. At the present time Nixon and his chief hench-

man HENRY (CZAR) KISSINGER are engaged in forming an alliance with another gang of

criminals, the Red Chinese. The RED CHINA GANG have slaughtered an estimated fifty

million of their own people since coming to power. This Godless horde of barbarians killed

thousands of Americans in the Korean War (shooting captured soldiers and starving and tor-

turing prisoners of war). The RED CHINA GANG have been supplying the NORTH VIETNAM-

ESE BANDIT'S with weapons and bullets to kill American soldiers in another no-win war in

Vietnam. The very fact that Nixon is dealing with these ARCH ENEMIES OF FREEDOM IS

enough to convict him of treason. DO NOT LET THIS CRMINAL STEAL YOUR FREEDOM.

DEMAND HIS ARREST BY PROPER AUTHORITIES AND HIS TRIAL FOR THE CRIME OF ISN - 2815

Dear. Mr. Belmont:

Since reading about the FBI files and records being stolen by

Radicals, I Implore Jag to either destroy my last letter about

the Secret army Organization or send it back to me, and not to keep

1 in your regular files,

• if this 1s what 1s done with all

correspondence.

Also, it's hard to say who will be the next director

of the EBI, or

whether he, or the people he appoints will be able to

be trusted-as j. Edear Hoover and his mon. Thore will never be

au man as good or competent as J. Edgar. Hoover. And I fear for the

safety of our Country, 11 and when he retirest (I do not trust Nixon,

I don't even respett him, and he is not, what many people used to

think he was!)

If tho SAO, are truly dedicated Counter-Revolutlonary's, then they

are your only hope, and mine,

and 1t would seem that every 10jal

Polico Officer and

FBI agent

In the U.Sado, would have to join in

the battle with us, shoubd we be taken over--or Civil War break out.

Therefore,

It would be in your best interosts to either destroy

Bro the see Dept. Datesal tafter tone fedente

I fool more confident,

that

they are all I hoped thoy would be, and also, out to help the Police

and to protoct them.

Because of Govt' interference I'm sure the SAO wouldn't have wanted

no writing to you, not because they don't trust FBI agents or

Jotagar Hoover lI'm sure but because they know there are Red's high

up In the fort.

and they don't trast AllY Attornoy General's anymore,

for which I don't blame them!! (Any Attorney General who would quit

to try to get Nixon elected, has to be very left of center--to put it

mildly! Except for J. Edgar Hoover and you FBI agents, and the

I Would nover botray the sio, and I guoss I shouldn't havo written to

own

longer protect us, because they have been rendered helpless and useless

by the courts. The Réds in the Supreme court have destroyed America.

I don't intend to break any laws--but some laws were made by Communist

It seems logical, that 1f our Government is taken over complotely

Otherwise they will kill all of you. Please don't let that happen.

It sooms like an unreal, hollish nightmare to so many of us.

REPORT OF JEROME

February 6, 1970

I talked tó BILL CLAY last night. He has

• been out of touch since last Friday night, and could

not be reached by telephone and was never at home

when I went by.

.

Apparently some member of the Minutemen

Organization or another right winger is being watched

or surveilled and CLAY is quite excited about It.

He

thinks the FBI is doing the watching and he wants to place

• surveilLance on the san Diego FBL Orlice for the pur.

ose of determining the times of arrival and departur

of the employees and obtaining the descriptions and

license plate number of FBI autonobiles.

to try to get

several people together who will be able

to spend time

watching

the FBI Office.

REPORT OF JEROME

February 5, 1970

I learned today that FRANK YAKOPEC found a

• dead skunk on the road yesterday which he picked up,

placed in a cardboard boi, which he then wrapped in

plastic bag, and born paper on the outside.

He mailed

• this package from the Del Mar post Office yesterday

addressed to JAN DIEPERSLOOT at the Peoples Cormune.

..

He was told that the Minuteren are going

to try to begin printing a news leaflet that publi-

cizes names and activities

of interest amoung the left

wingers.

I talked to PAUL RUPLINGER this morning

who said he would like to get some kind of harassment

•going again against Professor MARCUSE at UCSD.

RUPLINGER

also said that his son PETER RUPLINGER has a close

personal friend who he knows has been informing on both

left and right wingers for the FBI, for about a

year. RUPLINGER said he intends to make this person's

name

known to a number of people so as to destroy his

_activities as an informant.

MARCH 6: 1970

PY JEROME

I attended the CMC planning meeting in Balboa

Park last night.

I got there at about 7:10

but the meeting did not get going til 7:35.

There were approximately 50 to 60 people present.

•The meeting wes chaired by the Reverend BILL COATS.

•I saw FREITJOF THY GISON "there, however, he left early,

In disgust.

L also recognized ALAN STANCLIFE, SYLVLA

SHAPIRO and BERNIE SENTER in the crowd.

Also present

was a young white individual in his early 20s with long

dark brown hair. He was wearing a fatigue jacket with

red

stars on the collar.. I heard him refer to as "ILOYn"(Lowell

and he said he was a representative of the San Diego

Barame!

Street Journal.

Two other persons who spoke at the meeting

claimed to be representatives of MDM. One was a

clean

5'9 tall male with a military look,

medium build, about

he nas light colored hair and wearing

a Mao-

tse-tung

style quilted cap.

The other was also about

5'9" tall, medium build, long blond hair who wore gold..

rimmed glasses; a red jacket and camouflage pants.

It was decined there would be city wide peace

activity. during the week of April 13 to 18, 1970. However,

there

was a lot of arguments and backbiting as to whether

the actual peace march should take place on April 15 or

April 18, 1970.

It was agreed the march should probably

start at noon and that it would be a flop if less than

8,000 people showed up.

The MDM representative with the Mao tse-tung

cap was screaming that people from the military and people

with jobs could not come of the rally was held on the 15th,

a Heanesday,

and finally the NDM and Street Journal prople

walked out of the neeting.

After they left, there was

some discussion about a possible compromise where the rally

would be held on Wednesday evening and servicemen would

be bussed to it.

Before they left, the people from the Street

Journal announced that they had moved into new offices

but were evicted the same day after the police department

talked to their new landlord. They said that they had an

offset place which they would use to make posters

the April demonstration.

(Lowell Bergmans)

"ILOYD" from the Street Journal predicted

there would be a breakup in san Diego in the near

future due to polico department harassment.

During the meeting, it was announced that there

would be efforts made to organize a city wide student

strike at high schools on April 15, 1970.

It was also announced that MDM would have a

mock trial of the military on April 1, 1970, which will be

composed of active duty GIs and with MARK LANE as prosecutor.

It was eventually decided that the April demon-

stration would again consist of a march from downtown San

Diego to a rally in Balboa Park.

People were asked to volunteer to work on the

various planning committee.

One interesting thing that occurred was a

speech by a man from the audience who claimed that

the November 15, 1969, demonstration in San Diego

was nothing more than a disorganized mob. He said

the planning for the peace demonstration was all wrong

and

that the demonstration should be held on a weekend

SO

workers could join in. He said the people at the meeting

should due as had been done where, he said, groups of

30,000 to 40,000 workers had been organized

to march down

the

streets chanting.

This individual seemed to be well known, was a

white male, about 60 years old, gray hair, 5'7"

•and

stocky built. He had a flat, round face and spoke with

a heavy European accent.

There were no colored people at the meeting.

I stopped by the MDM Office at 429 J Street

last night at about 6:45. PM.

The place was in mass

confusion as there was a camera and some CBS TV Channel

2 people.

'I learned that they were filming coverage

the near future.

I also learned that SMC may be planning some

A demonstration began today at San Diego State

College and students from the school took over part of

"the administration building and at one time there were

close

•to 700 students there with more expected to arrive

after 4:00 p.m, when classes were out. It has the earmarks

of lasting for a long time.

The demonstration was touched off at about noon

by a speech given by KARL KELLER at a rally on the library

loan.

The students are protesting administrative action

taken by the school against four professors there.

Food including apples, oranges, carrots, punch

and loaves of bread is being passed around in the building

and is apparently being prepared at the Wesleyan Foundation

Building.

Signs have been put up in the building indicating

that the

restrooms have been "liberated" and are now co-educational

Some marijuana was seen being passed out free. About 100

students have elected to stay over night and are going home

in shifts to obtain sleeping bags and other items.

The demonstration appeared to be well planned and

some organizers, incluaing RHETrA ALexANDER Ior one, were

seen communicating with walkle-talkies. Other persons

observed taking part in the demonstration wee RON BREEN,

I stopped by State College about 11:00 p.m. last

There were about 75 students in the halls of the

administration building who were painting 30' long banners

and placing them on the walls of the administration building.

They were also printing leaflets announcing a rally at noon

today an campus:

LEON NOWER was observed there holding hands

with a young girl. BERNARD STREIFF, the french student

who claims to have participated in the french student

revolt, was also there.

APRIL 15, 1970

BY JEROME

I met an interesting individual at BILL, CLAY'S

house last

night.

He Is called "The Judge" and his

first name is JERRY.

i's about 5'10"

, to 5'11" tall,

230 pounds, has heavy built, ruday complexion and is

35-45 years old.

He has black hair which is receding,

a pus nose, round face and heavy jowels. He carries

a brown and

32 automatic pistol and is apparently

an excellent

shot.

He said he spent 8 years in military intelligence

following which he

worked for the CIn and then for the FBI

ät san Diego as an informant. He claimed he vas a paid

assassin for the CIA. He

seemed to be highly intelligent

and I was told he was good at make-up and voice imitations.

He said he had worked at Hollywood as a bit player.

He claimed that when he worked for the FBI

at San Diego, he was assigned to watch TROy HOUGHTON

and that he quit at about the time of the watts riot

in LosAngeles.

He said he was never a close acquaintance

of HOUGHTON but he had followed HOUGHICh a lot and

came to the personal conclusion HOUGHTON was a Communist.. m-

He seems almost to have convicted CLAY of this also.

As CINY staled, he had verified that HOUGHTON

had been meeting some known members of the Communist

Party.

BUSH and CLAY were thinking DE PUGH may have

become aware of this ana had HOUGHION eliminated.

this Is so, cual said he was thinking about contacting

DE PUGH and humbly apologize for pa trying to break away

Irom the national Mi organization.

"The Judge" is supposed to be from Virginia, although

he has no accent, and apparently hates colored people. He

speaks fluent German and

Spanish.

CLAY

stated he believes one of the leading Leftists

in the area is MORRIS KOMINSKY who lives at. 400 Last Franklin

Street, Elsinore, california.

He has written a

book which

is being advertised in papers like the Iree Door and the

Street Journal.

KOMINSKY allegedly moved in high circles

in the Federal

and local Governments aù one time and has

Government people, including Congressien, senators, and Presi

CLAY said he wants some local Right Wing neonle

to visit KOMINSKY and somehow get his signature.

Today, I went with "The Judge" to see MORRIS

KOMINSKY •

KOMINSKY is an order man, 00-70 years of age,

about 5'9" tall, curly black hair which has a lot of gray

In it, blue eyes. He weights 160-170 pounds, has poor

posture, as he slouches and has a pot belly.

statements, I gathered that he is very much in favor of

what the san Diego Street Journal is doing. He said he

gave all his records to the Street Journal

and claimed

that it took 5 Street Journal staff members 8 hours to

copy his notes of the San Diego area alone. He claimed

he had much mose information on Right Wing activities

in America and claimed he has spent five years researching

information for his new book which will be called

Down, USA. "

He said the first volume of this book which

be an expose on fascism in the United States, will

be 800 pages long and the second volume will be 1300 pages

He seemed to be pleased

to talk about his work and

as we reported ourselves to be fans of the Street Journal,

opposed to fascism, he talked quite freely.

He told us of contacts he has in the San Diegn

Police Department, of the San Diego District Attorney's

Office, and also claimed to have a source of information

in the

San Diego FBI Office.

KOMINSKY said he formerly had high placed friends

in Government and claimed he had been visited at his home

in Elsinore by Presidents of the United States such as

TRUMAN, EISENHOWER, and KENNEDY.

1970,

BY TEROME

Today, I went to a meeting at the Greek

Bowl at

State College to find out about the march route

for the anti-war demonstration to be held tomorrow.

There were about 60 people in attendance at the meeting

which started about 3:00 Pil.

These included BILL COATS,

ALAN STANCLIFF, FREITJOS, THY GESON, GARY GULLEY, JACKQUELYNE

TUMBURG, and a

reverend from the Wesleyan Foundation.

There was a big hassle about the choice of the

march route; the ChC wanted to march from Horton Plaza in

downtown San Diego, along Broadway to the 1lth Naval District

Headguarters for some speeches and then to the old ferry

SMS and the other students voted this down and

CMC almost walked out. A long debate followed resulting

considerable uneasiness between CMC and SMIC. ALAN STANCLIFE

was selected as monitor captain.

Afterwards, I went with BILL CLAY to Grossmont

College where another anti-var rally was taking place and

picked up some leaflets, which are attached.

We noted that they were passing out free food.

BILL CLAY went and got some

syringes and FRANK YACOPEC

bought some pickles which wers injected with rubbing

alcohol and castor oil and were passed out to the students

who were seen eating them. It is not noted if any of

them became ill.

FRANK YACOPEC set fire to a trash can in a rest-

wearing Army helmets.

Today, approximately 5,000 people, mostly long

hairs and hippies participated in an anti-war march and

demonstration in San Diego.

They marched from the downtown

area to Balboa Park where a rally was held. It was noted

that MDM marched as a separate unit in the demonstration

and was trying to cause trouble.

BILL CLAY, who was present recognized two "long

hair" Minutemen in the middle of the MDM group trying to

rabble rouse.

CLAY had mobilized between 100 and 200

right wing individuals and there appeared to be a

lot of

right wing agitation.

There also appeared to be about the

same number of Marines out witing for a fight and several

were seen in front of the Federal Building holding coke

bottles and waiting for the hippies to come along.

I was told

that the demonstration march was stopped

at the 5th Avenue Bridge over Interstate Highway 5 and that

BILL CLAY and his friends were the ones who stopped it.

BILL CLAY got into a discussion with FREITJOF

THYGESON, who appeared to be very disgusted with the repetitive

nature of the demonstration and the

location of the

march.

Persons observed present at the demonstration

included HERBERT MARCUSE, BILL MILSON, WARREN NIELSEN,

PETER CARTWRIGHT, BILL COATS aNd ALAN

STANCLIFF.

SYLVIA SHAPIRO was the Master of Ceremonies and

STUART INNERST was the main speaker. JAN DIEPERSLOOT and

RON BREEN also spoke. Dr. GEORGE ABBOTT was also there and

had organized an emergency medical corps: using walkie-talkies

and with ambulances available.

Sergeant BILL, COOK of the La Mesa Police Department,

and the Captain of the Security Guards at Convair (NFI)

were there and were taking good photographs of the demonstration.

It was learned that BILL CLAY "liberated" two rolls

of exposed film from, someone participating in the demonstration.

It was noticed that apples and oranges

were being

passed out and afterwards the Minutemen made plans to load

up some oranges

with anti-freeze

and donate them to the

upcoming MDM rally at Oceanside.

KAY* 27; 1970

BY JEROME

I was talking to BILL CLAY last Saturday.

He seemed agitated and said he had needen

to use a

lot

of caution.

He said however, he wanted his name

used and known as

the local Minutemen (MM) leader

and that he wanted

this done to attract Federa.1

attention in order to protect

someone else in the

background.

He is still talking about a new Right Wing

organization and claimed to have contacts with groups

in 11 western states and

said these people are trying

to establish a communications network and said the

name American Resistance Movement (ARM) had been

selected for this organization.

CLAY

got to talking about DE PUGH and said he

had been aware of DE PUGH's whereabauts when he was in

hiding.

He said he now has reason to believe TROY HOUGHTON

may still be alive and probably connected with ARM. He

said he believes HOUGHTON may have wanted out of the MM

organization, for some reason, and had to disappear to do so.

CLAY also talked about setting up a meeting with

the Leftist student group at University of California at

San Diego during the regular week and he would like himself,

BARRY GODFREY, SAM DAVIS, and GEORGE HOOVER to meet with

four students from that group.

I have learned that HOOVER always carries a

savage .380 pistol when he is away from home.

I have learned there is a new information center

at UCSD, similar to Messenger Information Center.

It has

been in

operation about two months and you reach it by

dialing 453-EDNA. This information center is simply called

EDNA.

It has been learned that BARRY GODFREY and FRANK

YACOPEC are going to see BILL CLAY this morning at about

11:00 a.m. to listen to a right wing speaker at UCSD.

This Friday GODFREY is supposed to help CLAY

move to his new apartment in Pacific Beach.

The photograph of ALDEN EDWARD WILLIS is not

famillar, ault the one of GEORGE HOOVER iS. HOOVER previously

had a goatee beard, but has now shaved it off. In persor

he looks much meaner and heavier than he appears in the

He always has the same wide-eyed expression on

his face.

It has been learned that BARRY GODFREY has been

picked by the San Diego fire Department to go to a school on

bombs and explosives and he will probably be on the new

fire department bomb disposal squad.

CLAY had a large quantity of personal belongings

and junk to move and has rented a garage near Second and

Ivy (between Ivy and Juniper on the east side of Second

there is a row of four garages and CLAY has the second from

the left where he is storing some of this stuff.

oLd It was also learned that GEORGE HOOVER waS at BILL

CALY's few apartment Friday evening and was in a talkative

mood as he was dead drunk. HOOVER apparently works at the

same place as SAM DAVIS. HOOVER said DAVIS was recently

in Texas on vacation and coming back his automobile broke

down at Gila Bend,

Arizona, and HOOVER bad to go out there

to

assist him.

Their boss at

the fence-company, is also supposed

to be a Minutemen and HOOVER and DAVIS are probably getting

some of their explosives from the fence company.

HOOVER nOW

uses a .45 Automatic Pistol which he even

takes to bed with him. He claimed his boss recently put

up $400 to get him out of some legal trouble.

HOOVER Said he had been living with a girl (NFI)

who in the recent past, had walked out on him and had said

she was going to contact the FBI. HOOVER seemed to be

worried about this.

HOOVER was getting more drunk all the time and

began rambling about "the ranch" where he lives. He said he

had just moved out of the hotel into one of the smaller

He kept talking about his horse and

asked CLAY to call "WILLIE" at the ranch and ask him to feed

the horse.

HOOVER uses the nickname "Mick" and usually

hangs out at the "341 Club" on Second Street in El Cajon.

He also kept talking'about a ROGER who went with him to

get SAM DAVIS.

This ROGER may live or work with HOOVER.

During thé evening CLAY approached HOOVER about

doing something to PETER CARTWRIGHT for spilling the beans

on the undercover police officer named JOHN MURRAY.

It was also learned that many Minutemen, knowing

that law enforcement officers are prone to handcuff people

behind their backs, are now carrying handcuff keys attached

to the inside rear waist band of their pants where they

can avoid being detected

in a

frisk.

Attached is a copy of the May issue of a new newspaper

named "The Orange County True Press" which is

I have learned that BILI CLAY has been approached

by a group of leftist students at University of California

.at San Diego who are allegedly fed up with the left wing

tactics which have been-used at university of california

at San Diego and are supposed to want to form an alliance

with right wing groups and individuals to deal with the

Government. BILL CLAY seems to be enthusastic about such

an alliance as he feels there is a considerable amount of

agreement between right and left wing groups as to the

goals they would like to achieve and their general disillu-

sionment with the Government and the established order.

CIAY is giving the matter. careful thought and may recon-

tact this group of students at a future time.

An acquaintance, ARTHUR HANSEN, told me today

•there is a house at 711 Fern Glen, La Jolla, about two

houses from HANSEN's home which is occupied by "three

weirdo men" who live, there together.

They have many

stop signs, apparently stolen from intersections around

town which

they have nailed to the fence in their back

yara.

HANSEN said he recently observed one of these men

In the back yard at 711 Fern Gleh wearing a housecoat and

a red wig.

HANSEN also told me that the night before the

"pig Invasion" of la Jolla, his sleep was disturbed by

loud noises, at approximately 3:00 a.m. and looking out

his bedroom window he saw many cars arriving in front of

the house at 711 Fern Glen to the point that the street

was filled up with cars. He said each car carried two

to five male individuals and he estimated a total of 50

to 60 people entered the house at 711 Fern Glen. HANSEN

said he watched this incident until approximately 5:00 a.m.

when he went back to bed and as yet none of the individuals

had left the house. He said, however, when he awoke the

next day the cars appeared to be gone. HANSEN thought

this incident might have had some connection with the yippie

invasion of la Jolla the following day.

REPORT BY JEROME

On August 7, 1970

Yesterday, August 6, 1970, I went to watch

the National tipple

Day at Disneyland. Many long hairs

and hippie type people were at the gate and parking lot

all day long but there were never enough there at one

time to make a big croud and most left after milling

around fos a while.

It appeared that they just did not

have enough money to get in..

FRANK YACOPEC, JERRY TARTAGLIO and others got

and many other rignt wingeis ifs.

Orange county area. The group to several hundred photo-

gra' is and shot two rolls si movie films.

The only serious incident occurred at about

6:30 p.m., when 300 or 400 yippies got together and started

marching fron place to place in Disneyland.

There were

several scuffles with the police who were called in at

about 7:00 p.M., and one girl was yelling "Kill the Pig,

Kill the Pig.

The yippies made an attempt to tear down the

flag in the fort but JaPRY TARTAGLIO and "CHUCK"

stood

against the flag pole and stopped them.

One of the apparent. leaders of the yippies was

about 45 years old with long hair and beads.

He got into

a scuffle with the police and a cop grabbed

him by the

hair, which caine right off showing hin to be very bald.

It looked to me as if there would have been

serious trouble if the yippies had been able to get a few

more people in there.

However, they backed right down

when they were confronted by the police. A lot of threats

were made and obscenity used.

During the day I noted about six rippies in front

of the gate with 15 - 20 ticket books passing out tickets

to other yippies to get in. Someone put out a lot of

money fos a lot of yippies to get in.

REPORT BY JERONE

August 27, 1970

This morning I was talking to General WTLLIAM

LEMLY who lives at 1536 Glorietta Place, Coronado.

•He clained to have been part of a Military underground

•organization since 1921s which was strong because di

rears in the Military of Communist takeover in this

country.

He told me that AVG actually stands fos

American volunteer Government.

He explained that

lates on the organization felt a need for an above-

ground front organization and so established the American

Volunteer Group, with HEDRIC "BUD" JOHNSON as the leacer

and with an savisory Council of 13 Military officers.

•These included Connander BALDORE who refused to go to

Vietnam because

the Government would not fight to win,

General "CHESTY" PULLER, General CUSTIS LE MAY, and

others.

According to LINTY, membership in American

Volunteer Groups was to be opened to civilians but

restricted only to those referred to the organization

by the Military Council and those who were already

members.

When "sUD" JOHNSON died, under mysterious

circuastances, JOHN ZENANIC and his secretary, HELEN

GRANT,

took over.

ZOMANEC and GRANT then threw the

menbership open to the general public upon which the

Military Council dropped out, and as far as the Military

is concerned, that part of AvG is now defunct.

LEtiLy told me chat the nane A. DUNN which

appears on old AvG bulletins and letterhead stationery

is a pseudony for a woman from Seattle. He said she

is an agent for a private investigative

grous which

has its headquarters on the east coast.

This

investi-

Lative group is run by a tormer is Agent named FRAN

CAPELO phonetic and investigates left ming activities.

CAPELO is suppose to be in the San Diego area

in the near future, and LiLY said he would refez ie

to hin foi possible enployuent as an Agent on the west

coast.

LEMLY claimed that he and ROBERT WELSH,

• leader of the John Birch Society are good friends

and communicate frequently.

LaNLY clained that he

is Vice-President of the National Liberty Amendment

Conmittee, which is a isont group for the John Birch

Society.

The Liberty Anenament represents the

elimination of

income tax and LaMLy clained he was

testifying last week before a California State Senate

Gioup about the amendment.

I saw ISHLY on PAUL RUPLINGER's secommendation.

IEMLY claimed he and PAUL• RUPLINGER aze also good friends.

LElTY again talked about the American Volunteer Governent

and said the purpose of the organization is to bring

'about a Military coup in this country if it becomes

necessary.

He said the organization's headquarters

are located in or near Washingion, D.C.

LElLY said that JOHN ZEMANIC was formerly

Chief of security of the above ground organization undes

JOH:SON and his secretary, HELEN GRANT, was suppose to

be a teacher but Inly's group was never able to verify

this. LaiLy said that because of the peculiar circum-

stances surrounding JOHNSON's death, his group dia a

Licule investigating ard found that

ZEMANIC waS a

Long Shorman and belonged to HARRY BRIDGES Long Shorman

Union. LENLY said that ZuMANEC might actually have

been a left wing infiltzatoi.

Ily appeared to be very Military, anti-leit

and pro-minute-nen and way form an alliance with the

Minute-nen in this area.

LENLY Who was in ONI for several years, also

• claimed to have access to Canadian and British Intelligence

Reports iron all over the world, through a friend who is

still in Washington, D.C.

After talking to LEtty, I saw BILL CLAY who

told ne that he is now working in some big national

moveinent and can no longer spare the time to be deeply

involved in local Ninute-nen activities.

CLAY passed on to me all of the stuff he

had been using including blank Bisth and Marriage

certificates, selecuive service registration cards,

stationery from many companies around the country,

FBI Letterhead Stationery, forms to fill out snowing

receipt si Marine Corps Good Conduct redals.

He also

gave me

a plate burner for making stencils for an

off set press.

CLAY said he would continue to give local

Minute-men any help and support necessary both nece

and in other places

and said he would set up a Post

Office Box in Las Vegas for the local Minute-en group.

REPORT BY JEROIT

August 31, 1970

I found out this morning in talking wiüh

DALE HERSCHLAR that the manager oi Les Girls who was

• supporting one Face Door financially backed out two

weeks ago and the paper is now in trouble.

For the

first time the Door is planning to charge foi the

newspaper, they still may not nave enough noney to

print it.

They have decided to stop carrying sex

oriented adas in the paper.

I also learned that the Sunrise newspaper

lost at least $3,000 on the rock concert it sponsored

and does not have enough

money to go on printing.

I talked to General LINLY Of AVG again who .

told me that "BUD" JOHNSON, former leades of AVG,

was

in the process of putting together a big expose

on the Connunist Party in the United States at the

time of his death.

his information from a former Military Intelligence

Communist penit salà Jonary Intelligence

Officer who was also connected with AVG.

LENLY said

he and other officers in the Military part of AVG

suspect JOHN ZEMANEC may have had JOHNSON done in and

the Military part of AvG is out to get ZEMANEC and

the civilian AVG organization if they can.

LEMLY claimed he and some right wing friends

were responsible for putting togetehr and passing out

the leaflets announcing the Yippie Pig National Invasion

of La Jolla early in the summer.

Innily said althougn

they did not think anyoning would actually nappen, it

turned out better than expected as many La Jollans

were turned against the left and have indicated

support for right wing activities.

The new Minute-nen

stickers were printed at

Alex Rapid Print in La Mesa,

California.

REPORT BY JERONE

On September 8, 1970

I was talking to PETER RUPLINGER this

. morning and he told me about DEPUGH holding sone of.

the people in cages. when he was captured by the FBT.

PETER is no longer living with Professor

FRED AKERS

and has terporarily sented an apartment

in

El Cajon using the name DON FREEDMAN. He is going to

try to sent one or two. Post Office Boxes using that

name.

PETER is suppose to get married October 23,

1970, and will then rent an apariment in his own name.

PETER told me that he, FRANK YACOPEC and

BARRY GODFREY had a meeting to make out future right

wing strategy. It was decided that they would continue

to harassing left wing individual and organizations

but would avoid hurting anyone or getting involved in

any real violence.

PETER said that he made contact

with a person naned "TRAVIS"

who he said is a lefty

but who he is converting. PETER said TRAVIS told hi

on September 3, 1970, about a person named R. J. WORK,

who lives on lincoln Avenue who had infiltrated

activities for the left.

He also told me about an individual at the

University of California at san Diego where a construction

worker dropped a five gallon bucket of tas from the

fifth floor oi the new hospital building into a group

of hippies. Apparently the bucket of tar broke and

sprayed all over the hippies.

HERE RUPLINGER, posing as a prospective

nothing which night possibly nave been connected with

YSA and added that the landlady told him she had

just told the tenants to get out of one of the

apartments and had re-rented

REPORI BY JEROME

September 9, 1970

I saw BILl CLAY this morning and received from

• him negatives and other material for making phony draft

cards, selective Service Cards, California State Birth

•. Certificates, Missouri and California Drivers Licenses

and many other papers for making phony identifications.

CLAY again said he is trying to do some work on a

nation wide movement.

The Minutemen are very interested in finding

out if Mecha-Maya and the black students council at San

Diego state college are still to get the proceeds from

the first to home football games which San Diego State

college prays.

CLAY also asked me to get a new Post Office Box

for him which I: agreed to do and I will furnish the

combination and number as soon as I get it..

REPORT BY JEROME

September 17, 1970'

.

I have learned that Message Information Center has

a comline or telephone extension to New Iducational Aclult

Community at 1924 Island.

MIC has a three digit rotary

switch board and gets an extremely large number of calls

every day.

The head operator and the person who apparently

runS MIC is named PHIL PLYMATE. However, it looks to me

as though MIC is completely controled and directed by

New Educational Community.

I have learned that the keys to the MIC Office

are kept at 1924 Island. MIC is in operation every day

from 9:00 A.M., till midnight.

Last night I tried to call LEON NOWER at his

home at about 11:00 P.M.; a babysitter answered the phone

and said he was not home,

but in an emergency could be

reached at 443-5869, or at 442-2163.

While I was at MIC today I learned that MDM had

a new telephone installed today which is 234-1190, and

which is supposed to be kept confidential

REPORT BY JEROME

September 18, 1970

This morning I went to Message Information Center,

arriving there at about 10:30 AM. Already there were TOM

HYDE and a young high school kid named STEVE (LNU) who was

learning how to be a MIC operator.

I shot the breeze with HYDE for about an hour.

He told me he is now Acting Co-ordinator for MIC. He said

, there will be a change in MIC leadership as he, HYDE, will

be leaving in about a month. He did not say where he is

going.

The former MIC co-ordinator, PHIL PLYMATE, 1S

supposed to be going to work full time with the san Diego

Street Journal. According to HYDE, both the Street Journal

and Sunrise are supposed to be out again in a few weeks.

HYDe said there will be mostly new people on the Street Journal

staff.

HYDE also talked about MIC's

"Fugitive File"

' This

file contains information on how to help deserters and draft

dodgers get out of San Diego. He said the file had been taken

out of MIC and hidden because many of the people connected

with this work had been questioned about it recently by the law.

gerome

NW 68262 Docld:32989523 Page 623

## Page 624

He said that when things cooled down, the file

will be improved and put back into MIC. He said one of

the things they planned to do is to ask anyone who calls

for help if he is a Federal Agent, thus hoping to trap him.

He also said that apparently some of the servicemen who

were helped in the past spilled the whole story about MIC

and other people when they got back to their Base.

I stayed at MIC until about one o'clock. After

awhile HYDE left, and I spent the rest of the time showing

STEVE how to do the work. I received and gave out a lot

of weird messages. I was able ta obtain the following

interesting information:

HYDE's telephone number is 582-8203. PLYMATE'S

telephone number is 232-8657. New Adult Communities new

telephone number is 239-2119, and RICK PHELPS' new address

and emergency only telephone number are 2810 31st Street,

telephone number 283-1934.

I agreed to pull another shift at MIC this Thursday

from 1:00 to 5:00 PM.

Some right wing people are excited about the

SIp rally on Detober 3, 1970,

and may attempt to create

a 1i0tle excitement.

one of the suggestions made was to

place black powder or primacord in the cracks along the

railroad. tracks over which the marchers will pass and

ignite it as they go by.

I learned that approximately one month ago FRANK

YACOPEC shot a large size steal nut through a window of the

Commune at 2nd and Thorn striking a hippie inside squarely

on the side of the head.

The hippie dropped as if shot

but nothing has been heard about it since.

GEORGE HOOVER has been very quiet lately and no

Whe Including BILI CLAY seems to know where he is of

he as doing.

I learned this afternoon that SIP 1s going

to hold a meeting at the and and Thorn Commune at 3:00 P.M.,

OCTOBER 5,

last

I discretely observed

• the STP denonstration

saturday.

The march and rally looked like a failure

to me because

they only had 200 people participating when

they had announced that they expected 4,000 or 5,000 to

join in.

I was really surprised at the hostility of the

bystanders and onlookers toward the marchers.

Many of

them were yelling

• "Communist"

, "pigs"

, and "Go to Russia"

at the marchers.

The sailors and Marines along Broadway

were very menacing and several times I thought there were

going to be fist fights.

The demonstrators did not stop at the 11th Naval

District Headquarters building or at the Police Department

headquarters but just walked by chanting and shouting

obscenities.

There were three speakers for the rally at Newtown

Park. The first was RON NIBBE, who apparently had just

been arrested by the police and

talked about his arrest

and how it was unjustified. He said everyone should be

good Communist comrades and buy guns.

He said that the

people should oppose and defeat the police and completely

eliminate them.

He said it was unwise to seek community

control of the police aed by having them live in the communities

becuase then they would know what was going on all the time.

The next speaker was a young male Negro individual

•who said he was a representative of the Committee to Free the

Soledad Brothers.

He said the Soledad brothers trial

is going to be moved to San Diego and that as much of the

committee as possible would also be moved to San Diego.

said however, that many people who belonged to and worked with

the committee up north won't be able to come to san Diego

and that the committee needs volunteers from the san Diego

area to carry on its work. I didn't know what this person's

name was.

The last speaker was CARLOS CALDERON who said he

wanted to organize the Chicano movement and truth about

the great heritage of the Latinos and gave several examples

such as CHE GUEVARRA with whom he apparently was very impressed.

These people said that there is

a new discussion meeting each Sunday on "Challenge"

and ILP and wrote down the address and phone number down

for me, 3993 Broadway, San Diego, telephone 263-1465.

FRANK YACOPEC was also at the rally wearing an

old felt had shot full of holes, a phoney FU MANCHU mustache

and a fatigue jacket. No one paid any attention to him.

Leaving the rally, I almost got into a fight with

three people who were very uptight and thought I must have

been a Lefty.

JIM STEWART, the fellow who has in his possession

SYLVIA SHAPIRO'S CMC mailing list, is about 19 years old, clean

cut, short hair, seems to be very intelligent and I believe

he is a student. He lives near the beach and it looks like he

is a person who is mainly responsible for organizing the anti-

war demonstration in San Diego on 10/31/70.

I heard some very interesting information about a

store

at Julian named the Mountain Market Grocery.

Apparently the

are openly advising for the

Minutemen

organization and are selling minutemen and other right-wing

literature over the counter at the store. Idas also told

that collections for DE PUGH'S legal defense are also being

taken at the store. I will probably goi up there soon and see

what's going on.

I learned from BARRY GODFREY that GLENN MOORE picked uL a

hippie female hitchhiker earlier in the week.

She was

apparently very radical, but MOORE got friendly with her and she

told him that the recent fires in the mountains were mostly

set by leftists and were part of a lettist plot.

I also learned that there is going to be a showing

of a film and a fund raising event at the Kent Theater on

10/15/70 to raise money and to make plans for the anti-war

demonstration on 10/31/70.

While I was at MIC today I learned about an individual

who is believed to be an undercover police officer by

leftists.

This individual is 40 to 50 years old, has dark

greying hair, is unshaven and goes by the name BODINE Or BOLIVAR

or some such

similar name.

Apparently he showed up several

weeks ago looking for a ride to the east coast.

He claimed

to

have been connected with ahiree school somewhere in California

and also at Santa Barbara. He always carries a sleeping bag

with him and "crashes" wherever he can. The people here have

been checking on him and contacted the free schools at Santa

Barbara and in Colorado and found out that he wasn't known

there.

This plus the fact that he is still around after having

looked for a ride to the east coast makes him believe he is

• with the police.

I also saw and met PHIL PLYMALE.

He is extremely

weird looking and has a very strange beard and hair-do even

for the people at Message Information Center.

He impresses

me as being very paranoid and is highly suspicious of everyone.

Last Friday, I went up to Jullan to the Mountain

Market Grocery Store

and met the owner, whose name is MARGie

MC NICKLES.

MC NICKLES sells Minutemen, Ku Klux Klan and

other similar literature and material across the counter at

her

store.

She is also working with the Patriotic Party in San

Diego and told me that she is going to try to form a chapter

of the Patriotic Action Legion in San Diego.

Her son is supposed to be President of the Young

Republicans Organization at Grossmont College.

She told me that ROBERT DE PUGH has been on trial

for all the Federal charges against him at Albuquerque, New

Mexico, and has been held in the City Jail there.

She said

DE PUGH was to have been sentenced on 10/9/70 and said that

he was asking for a total of ten years each on nine separate

counts.

win to

MC NICKLES said that the jailors at the Albuquerque

City Jail are taking very good care. of DE PUGH as most of

them are very sympathetic to him:?. MC NICKLES also made a

statement to the effect that it DE PUGH is sent to Laavenworth

he will never get there which I took to mean that there may

be an escape attempt.

MC NICKLES also said that she KnowS JOHN ZEMANEC Of

• AVG and GLENN JACKSON of the Patriotic Party at Los Angeles.

She showed me an open letter which DE PUGH wrote to ZEMANEC

telling him to get completely out of right-wing activities.

She also had some other stuff which she claimed to have just

recently received from DE PUGH.

MC NICKLES also told me there is a commune at Julian

not far from her place.

she said these people are long hairs,

but clean and drive nice cars.

She said they moved in several

months ago paying $32,000 cash money for the house.

She said

• NW 68262 Docld:32989523 Page 646;

---

## Page 647

that although the former owner of the house told her he

sold the house to a woman she has seen only male individuals

at the house. She said there are only a few individuals who

stay at the 'house during the week, but that several carloads

of male individuals arrive each Friday evening and stay over

until Monday morning.

She said she and her husband feel

that some kind of

training is going on at the commune as

they have been able to hear radio Morse Code signals from the

house in the evenings when the wind is right..

She said the person who is always at the house, which

is located on Whispering Pines Drive, drives a Car with

California License TXL 136 which also has a Yale sticker

on it. She said cars with the following license plates have

shown up there on the weekends:

VGL 342

OKU 316

RGD 465

WTH 134

I have learned that SUNRISE now has a bookstore

at 4855 El Cajon Boulevard.

FRANK YACOPEC has been talking

about breaking the windows of the store.

JIM STEWART, address 5854 Ithaca Place, telephone

453-4867, has apparently been connected with a group called

the Non-violent Action Center.

pu =

"The San Diego Street Journal" has a brand new

telephone number which is 235-4478.

BILL CLAY went out of town Friday night and did not

get back until late Sunday night. He now has his pilot's

license and is certified to fly solo and wherever he went he

flew.

CLAY told me that the Minutemen lost some stuff

during the recent fires in the back country.

He said included

in the losses were a Lewis Machine Gun and several other

small machine guns and some ammunition and explosives which

NW 68262 Docld:32989523 Page 647

---

## Page 648

weren't buried deep enough. He said the losses weren't serious

and that most of the stuif

weren't hurt. He was talking about

running a survey to locate all the buildings and warehouses

and other places in the county where ammunition and explosives

are stored so that these places could be cleaned out or

blown up in the event it looked like the left was serious

about starting the revolution.

He was also talking about unburying 500 pounds of

explosives to have ready to use in the event of an emergency.

He also said the Minutemen in the area have acquired a new

20mm Caliber Lahti anti-tank rifle.

It has been learned that BERRY GODFREY waS

in contact with SAM DAVIS last Saturday. Apparently

he and GEORGE HOOVER and several other people are

planning to change their names, occupations and so

on and

try to disappear.

They are supposed to be

going "north"

, however the exact location is not

known.

Their purpose in doing this is to start

a Minutemen Commune as a base of

operations against

the Left. They have photographs

which they claim

were taken of people at Communes in the Northern

California area wearing. fatigues and practicing with

rifles.

They will try to locate these communes

and conduct terrorist activities against them.

It was also learned that DAVIS attended a

recent gun show at ll faso, texas. He reportedly said

he would put GODFREY in touch with his suppliers, who

can get anything in the way of weapons, ammunition

and explosives and other articles when

he leaves.

Apparently DAVIS and HOOVER will put this

plan into effect during the first part of 1971.

• It is known that HARRY RUJA, Professor at

San Diego State College, has been more active lately.

He has been involved in trying to organize some sit

ins and some protests against the arrest of LEON NOWeR.

He looks as though he may be trying to take NOWER's place

as the radical faculty leader at San Diego State College.

It was also learned that a Datsun pickup truck

which RUJA drives to work was burned up on his driveway

last saturday night. It is suspected that some of the

local Minutemen may have been responsible.

It was also learned that over the last weekend

the windows at the Sunrise Book Stre were broken.

Attached is an SMC leaflet which I recently

picked up at SDSC.

It appears that GEORGE HOOVER and SAM DAVIS

are bosom buddies.

They invited me to go to the Gunsmoke

Ranch In Harbison Canyon last Sunday.

They were both

there and I also met ROGER WILLIS.. In addition there

were three women and two other males at the ranch whose

names I did not learn.

DAVIS waS In Mississipp1 recently and at the

ranch he was driving a green Chevrolet van with Mississippt

license F/6192030.

He apparently broke down somewheres

In Texas one the way back and HOOVER went to rescue him.

On the ranch there is a pistol range

and a

range with phagst

Ephs up and running targets but that

part was burned down in a recent fire.

The range is

being rebuilt.

There are also two muzzle loading cannons

on the ranch and there is a bunker or open mine shaft

type of thing in the side of ahill.

I could see shoring

and supports inside but was not allowed to get close enough

to see. what. it.

was..

HOOER and DAVIS were practicing quick-draw

always armed at least with .22 caliber derringer pistol.

SAM DAVIS has many M-2 carbine parts which he

will sell at a good price..

He gets alot of his stuff

from a place in Los Angeles, and he has approached BERRY GODFREY

asking him to stop at that place the next time he is in

Ios Angeles and obtain some hand grenade casings. The casings

are apparently being sold for $1.00 a pixe.

I learned that the house HOOVER lived in on the

ranch was burned in the fire. I also learned that

there are two fellows named SIAN (INU) and DAVE (LNU)

who live on the ranch.

While I was there SAM was thirking about staging a

punitive raid on the SDPD in retaliation for the arrest of

ISSAC CANTRELL.

He said however he did not know CANTrELL.

Jerome

NW 68262 Docld:32989523- Page-656

## Page 657

DAVIS sald he feels that the FBI and SDPD

are, communist controled and he wants to neutralize

them.

In particular DAVIS has a special hate for

Agent O'BRIEN of the FBI. He said he knows that most

of the Agents are decent people who are just doing

their job.

However he feels that O'BRIEN iS

persecuting the Minutemen as a vengeance and said he

would give anything to get O'BRIEN's home address

and telephone number.

DAVIS said he was going to price some tear

gas grenades and said he could get primacord in 500 feet

lengths for $30.00.

It was learned that the SMC anti-war march

11/1/70 was a complete failure.

There were only 150 - 200

people who participated in the

march, with a few more

attending the rally. Nothing of interest happened

and the speeches given were aull and uninteresting.

I was in contact with PETER REPLINGER

yesterday. He said there has been evidence of many

students

in the school turning against the new left

movement He said apparently the Street Journal and its

staff had been caught. In some bad lies which had caused

many students

to be disillusioned.

It was also learned that SAM DAVIS wants to order

10000 .223 caliber bullets through BARRY GODFREY's contact

which will cost $255.

It was also learned that FRANK

YACOPEC wants to order 1000 M-1 carbine bullets.

I was told that BERRY GODFREY was In touch

with BILI, CLAY today. CLAY claims that there have been

the beginnings of some right wing activities at UCSD.

He said that the SDS there tried to stage a protest

against the Marine Corps Recruiter which was scheduled

to come to the campus.

He said one SDS member dragged

an American flag across the quad and for his efforts was

beaten up by a couple of members of a new right wing

group at the school.

The SdS had planned to protest the number of

Negro Marines who have been killed in Vietnam, however

the Marine Corps set a Negro Recruiter to the school

which really threw water on their plans.

According to CLAY it appears that a real confrontation

may be brewing between the conservative and radical students

at UCSD. It was also learned that CLAY now has his private

pilots license.

It has also ben learned that BERRY GODFREY and

other members of the Minutemen group may be present at the

SMC march and rally on 11/1/70.

I was in contact with PETER REPLINGER last

Saturday.

He told me he has agreed to take charge

of all the Minutemen records which are presently being

kept by BERRY GODFReY.

PETER is getting ready for his

upcoming wedding and consequently has not been to active

lately.

I have noticed that someone has been painting

a number of pro-Minutemen slogans on bridge abutments

and overpasses around the La Mesa and El. Cajon area.

lately.

I had a chance to talk to BILL CLAY this

morning.

He Is still upset about MELVIN CRAIN:

He thinks CRAIN is behind a large part of the left

wing activities in the county.

He said he believes

CRAIN has a lot of weapons and ammunition stored away

on his Hollyoaks Ranch In Harbison Canyon.'

CLAY also mentioned that KENNETH GOFF was

In town yesterday. He said GOFF was and probably

still is a close associate of DE PUGH. CLAY said

GOFF is sort of a religious fanatic.

GOFF may have concealed DE PUGH forawhile when. DE

PUGH was in hiding. He said GOFF was here to speak

to a group of right wing people and said about 40

individuals attended the speech.

CLAY said GOFF told him of the existance

of a left wing revolutionary army which is operating

In this country. He said this army uses the name "Largo"

said the code used is supposed to be based on the sixth

and seventh chapters of one of the books of Moses in the

bible, which is somehow inserted into the IV program's

script. He also said there have been references to

Attached are copies of some new Minutemen

stickers and posters

which the local group has been

putting out.

They are supposedly printed by Alex

Rapid Print in La Mesa.

They are being mailed out to

rany people and are also handed out locally around town.

It is known that BETTIE HOUGHTON was in contact

with BARRY GODFREY last night. She was very excited about

the posters and stickers and

said she was very glad to see

some activities getting started.

She said she is reorganizing

some of her contacts and group and said that the new posters

and stickers had caused such a flury in town that the whole

Minutemen organization might really get going again.

She said LOU CONDE had apparently received some of the

stickers and posters and was excited about them. It looks

as though there are many people just sitting around waiting

for something like this to happen so they could get involved.

It was aiso learned that BETTIE Gave GODFREY

some plates with which to make some big Minutemen posters.

She also said she has nearly 500 negatives which can be

use to make plates for printing posters and leaflets.

I had a chance to talk to BILl CLAY again.

He maintained that there may have been some comection

between DAVIS and ISSAC CANTRELL awhile ago.

CANTRELL

is the one who was arrested by local and fèderal authorities

for unlawful possession and manufacture of automatic

weapons.

NOVEMBER 18, 1970

BY JEROME

The photo of JAMES RICHARD BUSs is totally un-

familiar to me and I don't believe I have ever seen this

individual before. His name is also not familiar to me.

I was fairly well-acquainted with STEPHAN SMITH.

He was in the San Diego area for a period of approximately

a year and left six to eight months ago. I was told that

he went back north, which I assume to mean los Angeles or

San Francisco.

SMITH was married and lived with his wife at Rancho

Bernardo while he was in this area.

He was very involved in

the Right vs Leit confrontation, which took place in Poway

last year over the make up of the Poway School Board. He was

Involved there with colonel shit, the NoRMaNs, and other

people who were opposed to DANIEL. PREDOVICH aS

School Board

Chairman and some of whom who were considering ways of getting

ILd Of PREDOVICH.

While SMITH was in this area, he was closely associated

with known members of the Minutemen organization, such as MICHAEL

VEJBODA, PAUL RUPLINGER and LOU CONDE. I do not know if SMITH

Is or was a member oi the Minutemen organization, out II not,

be was not a member in name only as he appeared to be in total

agreement with the far Right extremist, radical, political

philosophies of VEdBODA, RUPLUNGER and CONDE.

SMITH's wife

was also extremely Right Wing and on one occasion helped pass

out Minutemen organization leaflets. SMITH was involved as a

partner with LOU CONDE in a business, which was named DIGISCAN.

DIGISCAN was supposed to have been an electronics research and

manufacturing outfit, the main purpose of which was to develop

sell a police communications systen whereby each individual

police officer could,

at all times, be in constant touch with

some police base station.

SMITH and CONDE apparently had a

quarrel about the business and split up, and I believe there

may be a law suit pending over ownership of some of the equip-

went, which belonged to the company.

As a sidelight, SMITH would build monitoring and

"bugging" devices for a price. He also had electronic equip

ment for use in searching buildings and other places for

hidden electronic monitoring devices or "bugs".

I heard recently that MICHAEL VEJBODA is presently

I was in contact with SAM DAVIS last Saturday

evening.

For some reason he was quite upset and was

talking

about making plans for a tactical squad of six or so individuals

with which to nartass and terrorize left wing sympathizers in

the San Diego area.

He said he wanted to have a meting this"

coming Friday evening to try to map out some strategy. In

particular, he seems to want to conduct a raid on MELVIN CRANE'S

ranch.

He said he would shoot the Doberman Pincers CRAig has .

guarding the place, ransack the house then burn it down.

He was also talking about another place in Harbison

canyon, I will try to get the address later, where he claims

Communist Party meetings are being held.

Among others, he claims

that SI CASADY and DOROTHY HEALEY (phonetic) have ceen meeting

there. He says he wants to raid that place too.

He was also talking about a 'Doc Roberts" who he says

has many weapons contacts and who may have access to machine

guns and hand grenades. He may put me in touch with this person

Later on.

• I have also been talking to FRANK YACOPEC: YACOPEC

says he has learned of a possible existence of some bunkers

which were buried and abandoned oy General PATTON at the start

of the secona World war.

He says the bunkers are supposed to

still be full of ammunition and explosives. He claimed he

was told of the existence of

the bunkers by a former aide of

General PATTON. He told me that he, BILL CLAY and BARRY GODFREY

may fly up to the location at a later date and look it over.

uncers are

Apparently these bunkers are located somewhere in the desert

east

of 29 Palms.

I was also in touch with PETER RUPLINGER on Saturday.

He stated he has obtained 50 hand grenade fuses and wants to

go to Los Angeles to buy 50 hand grenade casings ana he will

then activate the hand grenades.

PETER claimed he has a friend

who works at the Frontier Gun Shop in San Diego who is a

right wing individuals and is selling unregistered ammunition

and firearms. PETER has been carrying a 3 caliber revolver

lately.

I also learned that SAM DAVIS has an unknown quantity

of expendable rocket launchers with rounds which he will sell

for $25 each.

He is

supposed to se looking for anti-tank

weapons and mortars in the hundreds or thousands.

DAVIS apparently

has a brother who is also very militant and is working

with him.

I am supposed to see BETTIE HOUGHTON this evening.

She will put out 500 of the new posters and stickers (see

attached) •

The advertising from the posters and stickers has

On 12/1/70

BY JEROME

I was in contact with MARGE MC NICKLES at

Julian last Wednesday and talked to her for about three

hours.

We discussed DE PUGH's status.

She said that

representatives of the Minutemen organization anâ the

Patriotic Party have been talking to former Chief of

Police REDDIN at Los Angeles alleging that DE PUGH Is

innocent of the bank robbery conspiracy charges on

which he was recently convicted.

She said she was

told REDDIN is sufficiently convinced of the possibility

of DE PUGH's innocence that he may search out evidence

• In this regard on which to base a program for his

television show.

She also talked about a JIM MOORE who she said

Is in California and is on one of MC NICKIES' mailing

She also mentioned an older man in Los Angeles

named FREED who is a leader of the Patriotic Party. She

said that DE PUGH's mother is also a Patriotic Party

leader and told me that DE PUGH has asked GLENN JACKSON,

of Los Angeles, to resign as co-National Patriotic

Party Chairman.

MC NICKLES said that she herself is Secretary-

Treasurer of the Western Region of the Patriotic Party

which covers 1l states.

She said in the event of a

spllt in the Patriotic Party between DE PUGH and JACKSON,

she will side with DE PUGH. She said she has the bank

account and the membership list for the Western Region

of the Patriotic Party in her possession.•

She also told me that the Minutemen National

Headquarters continues to function under BOB DE PUGH, JR.,

and RAMONA VAN DE PUGH.

She said there is a courier

traveling between Los Angeles and the Minutemen National

Headquarters weekly.

She asked that her son, DANT. MC NICKLES,

a student at San Diego State College, be

used at

Right wing activities and made arrangements for me

to meet him this evening at 8:00 p.m., in. La Mesa.

MC NICKLES told me there is a woman living

In the Julian commune and said she has seen others

coming and going there. She gave me the license

numbers of two more of the cars she has seen at the

commune•

One was an out of state license, white back-

ground with blue figures XVC 316, which was on a dark

green car with white racing stripes, possibly a Mustang,

which was at the commune on October 11, 1970. The

other was a tan over brown Volkswagen bus with California

license MHD 097 which was at the commune on November 2,

1970 .

On Friday I saw BILL CLAY and told him about

MARGE MC NICKLES.

I asked him if he thought we should

try to use her to re-establish contact with the Minute-

men National Headquarters.

CLAY

said "I don't know.

We'll have to ask SAM about that.

• 11

I was definitely

impressed from the way he made the statement that perhaps

he has been taking orders in the Minutemen organization

from SAM DAVIS all along.

We then went together to see DAVIS and discussed

MC NICKLES with him.

He said that we should continue

to case that

talking with MC NICKLES to see what contact with her

would produce.

CLAY and DAVIS then got to talking

about breaking DE PUGH out of jail at Albuquerque and

I related to them what MC NICKLES had told me before

about going to Alaquerque to visit DE PUGH. CLAY and

- DAVIS became very upset and jumped all over me because

I had not told them about MC NICKLES being there and

about knowing the layout of the Albuquerque City Jail.

After this they started talking idley about

getting DE PUGH out of prison at Fort Levenworth.

DAVIS then

stated he had seen DENNIS MOWBER not

too long ago and at that time MOWER was hiding out a

girl who was allegedly a former secretary for dE PUGH.

He said MOWER told him that for some reason DE PUGH had

people looking for this girl to kill her and that also

she was being sought by the FBI.

DAVIS continued talking and indicated the

possibility he hold a higher position in the Minute-

men organization in the State of California than we

previously suspected. He said he has been using the

name SAM WILLIAMS in

some of his other contacts and

Minutemen activities.

CIAY then mentioned a former San Diego area

Minuteman named ED ANDREWS who he thought had always

been very reliable.

He sid he had previously understood

ANDREWS to be somewhere in the State of Arkansas but

Said VIC WALTON had told him that ANDREWS was back at

Ramona, California, some time ago.

They also talked about HOWARD CLARK as a

reliable Minuieman member. He also apparently lives

at Ramona and

is employed

at Convair.

MC NICKLES IS

also well acquainted with CLARK and they said we should

uSe CLARK as a reference to MC NICKLES to gain her

confidence.

CLAY and DAVIS want to have another meeting

soon for the purpose of setting up a schedule or list

targets in the San Diego area

to hit in the event it

appears that a communist or other totalitarian

in this country appears imminent.

From my contact

with CLAY and DAVIS it appears that there has been

considerable improvement in the communications and

coordination among the Right Wings in this area.

Additionally, regarding my contact with MC NICKLES,

she told me she is Neo-Nazi. She also said she is

in contace with JOSEPH BRINKER and also said that HENNING

VON BECK is in town.

She said he is the son of a General

VON BECK who was in the German army and was executed at

the Nurenberg trials.

She said he sold her that last

week some one IIred a rifle bullet through the windshield

of his automobile and regularly gets letters from Jews

announcing they are out to get him..

She also told me that the local telephone

Installer at Julian, a man 40 - 45 years old, 1s also

a Minuteman and that he checks her telephone for her

to determine if it is being bugged.

He was in contact with GEORGE HOOVER yesterday

who apparently has not been doing much of anything. He

also saw JERRY GETER last night who claimed he has made

contact with a Minutemen group at Los Angeles which is

involved in buying and selling weapons. He told many

about some new Minutemen business cards which are coming

out of Los Angeles. We got around to talking about hand

grenades and GEIER said that although he did not openly

solicit hand grenades. for money, he would obtain some for

money If he happened to run across any.

:

I am not aware

of anyone connected with

the

Minutemen organization placing Minutemen stickers and posters

around MORRIS STARSKY's apartment

house of on his car.

However, people like LOU CONDE, FRANK YACOPEC and the

RUPLINGERS are always good suspects in things like that.

MARTINI of the Accuracy Gun Shop, FRANK YACOPEC and BARRY

GODFREY. It Is expected as many as 50 or 60 other individuals

may join the skirmish group, some who will be rightwing.

oriented people and may who will be just plain gun nuts.

These will include JERRY GETER, ROGER WILLIS and others

probably including some from the Patch and Ball Gun Shop

crowd.

I have also learned that GEORGE HOOVER and SAM

DAVIS have three operational Civil War field artillery

pieces which are located on ROGER WILLIS' Gunsmoke Ranch

property in Harbison Canyon and may actually belong to

him. STAN MCDADE Is bullding a 4th artillery piece.

He

has the gun carriage assembly and has ordered the barrel

for the weapon..

According to HOOVER, the beauty of organizing

such a skirmish group is that it will allow the right

wingers and Minutemen to use the group as an above ground

organization and to openly drill and train with weapons.

Members would have their own uniforms and the organization

would be set up in a military fashion with officers, ranks,

etc., assigned to the members. Persons joining the

organization will be protected from police and other

outside harassment by being assigned the name of an actual

CivIl War officer or soldier to use while they are participating

• In the organization's activities. The existence of the

organization will also give the right wingers an excuse to

have large quantities of black powder and percussion caps

• on hand to use for their weapons.

In addition the organization could be used to

provide an honor guard to be present at local appearances

of right wing speakers and to set up counter-demonstrations

against left wing activities.

This skirmish group would be controlled and direct-

ed by an underground nucleus of 6 or 8 solid Minutemen members

who are not generally known to other members of the skirmish

group.

HOOVER and DAVIS are apparently becoming less

wing activitles. According to them, he is too busy now

adays with his own personal affairs to be of much use.

For this reason, they have said they don't want him in the

underground group of Minuteman members who will direct

the Civil war skirmish.

It has come to my attention that JERRY BUSCH

has fallen out of favor with most of the Minutemen members

who do not like or trust him. SAM DAVIS has even threatened

to shoot him: GEORGE HOOVER still likes him though and

BUSCH spends most of his weekends at the Gunsmoke Ranch with

HOOVER and WILLIS. Could their be a romance brewing?

told me he is trying to revitalize the Virtue in America

Group (VIA). He said he has been talking to LOU CONDE in

an attempt to gain his participation and support for VIA.

He also said if he is successful with VIA he may possibly

BY JEROME

::

I was at Julian today talking to MARGE

MO NICKLES.

She said she had sent a letter to one of

my Post Office Boxes asking me to come and see her.

She said It looked as though there had been another

split in the Minutemen organization, and

showed me a

bulletin which she had received from what looks like

a new Minutemen group.

The bulletin was printed on

the original Minutement letterhead paper and was post

marked December 15, 1970. She said she received the

bulletin about a week ago.

Regarding the bulletin, MC NICKLES said that

In the past there was always talk about DE PUGH and

other people in the Minutemen organization regarding

an Executive Committee of advisors to DE PUGH. According

to the bulletin, it had been sent out by that Executive

Committee and announced that during the month of December

of 1970, no date given,

there had been a meeting of

Regional Coordinators

of the Minutemen organization at

Chicago, Illinois.

The bulletin said the Executive

Committee was gratified at the large attendance at the

meeting and went on to announce that control of the

Minutemen organization was being taken away from DE PUGH

and

the res's of the National Headquarters Group at

Norborne, Missouri. The bulletin said this action was

being taken as it had been learned that funds of the

Minutemen organization had

been mis-used, that nalucinatory

drugs had been purchased and that effective leadership

was lacking at the Norborne Headquarters. s

The bulletin said that DE PUGH and his

associates should no longer be considered as part of

the Minutemen organization.

The bulletin aâvised

that

• all Minutemen literature which had not been copyrighted

was being re-printed and was always available for

distribution.

grome

NW 68262, Docld:32989523 Page 695

## Page 696

- She said the copyrighted Minutemen lIterature

was being reviewed for changes so as to avoid the

copyright and would been be re-printed.

The bulletin also advised that as a result

of the December meeting the country had been divided

Into ten regions with a Regional Coordinator appointed

for each.

The bulletin said that the Regional Coordinator

would be

the individual member's contact with the

National Headquarters. The bulletin had a return

adaress of Post Office Box 090, Elgin, Illinois, with

a note that

the second address appearing on the

was that of the receiving members Regional Coordinator.

The note went on to say that if no second address

appeared on the bulletin the receiving member was to

send all Minutemen organization mail to the Elgin,

Illinois, address from where it would be forwarded

to the Regional Coordinator.

There was no second

address on MC NICKLES' Copy of the bulletin.

Enclosed with the bulletin were a number of

the original Minutemen report forms which are to be filled

out and returned. Also enclosed were a number of the

origional Minutemen application forms which are suppose

to be distributed to interested persons.

MC NICKLES told me

she has heard of several

other people (no names given) in our area who also

received the bulletin.

She said, however, that apparently

none of the JOHN ZEMANEC-GLENN JACKSON grOUp at Los

Angeles got them.

With regard to DE PUGh, MC NICKLEs toLd me

• that the charges against him in the State of Washington

have been thrown out of court for lack of evidence.

MC NICKIES said she communicates regularly with DE PUGH'S

wife and received a

letter from her not too long ago

which requested more money for DE PUGH's legal defense. •

She said, however,

there has been no visible action in

this regard and pointed out that the above described

bulletin implied that DE PUGH's wife is "blowing" the.

money which is being received for his defense.

gerome.

NW 68262 Docld:32989523 Page 696

## Page 697

She said she has also heard a rumor to the

effect that DE PUGH's wife is running around on him

while he is in prison, but she said she does not believe

this is true.

mentioned

MC NICKLES said DE PUGH's wife had previously

a person named JESSE STEPHENS who may possibly

be connected with the group al Elgin, Illinois.

She said STEPHENS supposedly started a Right

Wing group some years ago, possibly in the Northwest

but was never recognized by DE PUGH.

She said she does not know if STEPHENS is

actually connected with the Elgin, Illinois, group.

I will send a letter to the group at Elgin,

Illinois, regarding what their plans are. I will use

the name JERRY MORAN and the Post Office Box Number 76

at spring valley, california.

County Administration Building tomorrow morning.

It was

I have not been in contact with LOU CONDE in some-

cime; nowever, I understand he is still politically active

especially in the group named Taxpayers Concerned.

REPLINGER is still in regular contact with CONDE.

CONDE has always had a reputation as a "blabber

mount", but actually only talks about little things which

• are not

very important.

CONDE is a clever, dynamic ,. ambitious

and hardworking person. He has a lot of money and

is very

himselr.

CONDE has many Cuban exile contacts and is a Cuban

In particular, he is close to the Alpha 66 group

and can get them out to do things for him.

CONDE is in very tight with the local tuna boat

association and I would imagine he also has many contacts

among the shrimpers and tuna sievers.

This is because he

has a marine engine and shipfitting business and does much

work for the fishing boats.

It is entirely likely that CONDE may be involved in

some way with illegal arms shipments on some of these fishing

boats between here and some Latin American countries.

If this

Is happening, I doubt that the weapons are coming to the

United States through the Latin American countries, but are

probably being purchased here and shipped to Cuban guerrilla

organizations

in Central and South America.

It is also possible

that CONDE may secretly be doing some work

to.arm some of the

tuna boats to protect them against seizure by such countries

as Peru and Ecuador. He mentioned something about this to me

about a year ago.

It looks as though I may be going to the Gunsmoke

Ranch this coming weekend.

they had a shotgun shoot at skeet. The group at the Gunsmoke

I have learned that sometime ago, FRANK YACOPEC

and JERRY TARTAGLIO were in contact with a retired Army

colonel who claimed he was some kind of an aide to General

PATTON, or otherwise connected with him, when PATTON was

Involved In desert maneuvers and training in the Palm Springs,

California, area at about the beginning of the second world

According to what this colonel said, PATTON and his

troops received urgent orders requiring them to pack up and

ship out to go overseas with only two days notice. Because

of such short notice, rather than taking their heavy equipmert

and supplies with them, they simply abandoned and buried ther:

Intolesale quantities.

I understand that many trucks and

tanks were part in ravines and gullies and dirt was bulldozed

over them.

There are a lot of recorded instances where people

have found such buried supplies in the desert out beyond

Palm Springs.

This area is still all Government property

that is very llttle inhabited any any time.

Apparently the

Government has either lost its records, forgotten about, or

simply doesn't care about all the stuff that is supposed to

be buried out there.

In particular, this colonel told YACOPEC and TARTAGLIO

about a large concrete bunker with big double steel doors which

he said was filled with ammunitions and explosives and also

buried.

He apparently told TARTAGLIO and YACOPEC how to locate

the bunker and I understand that they went out to the desert

and after digging through about six feet of sana, actually

found the steel doors to the bunker. Following this, they

covered the bunker up again and have not been back since.

On the 27th of this month, a group Including YACOPEC,

BARRY GODFREY and PETER REPLINGER are going to go out to the

desert to try and relocate the bunker and dig it out. I

understand that REPLINGER has access to a portable jackhammer

and some other heavy equipment which he will use to dig out

the bunker.

If it is at all possible, I will try and go along

with them to see what they actually find.

ON JANUARY 25, 1971, BY JEROME

I was at the Gunsmoke Ranch in Harbison Canyon

yesterday..

When I got there, there were already 15 people

present, most of whom I did not know and as I was leaving,

three more people, STAN MC DADE and his two sons, arrivea.

Those I knew among the others present were JERRY

BUSCH, SAM

DAVID, GEURGE HOOVER and ROGER WILLIS.

Iwo of the others that

I noticed inparticular were a young fellow in his early 20's

tall, 130 pounds, dark brown hair, who was called

GEORGE, and a big fellow with shoulder length

Boatee beard who was about 45 years old, 8l 5" tall, 300 pounds

and. bald. I believe he may have been referred to by the name

ROYAL.

There did not seem to be any organized activity in

progress.

Most of the people were just more or less milling

around and talking with each other.

Most were carrying pistols

and most were shooting muzzle loading weapons at one time or

another.

While I was there, I got to talking to SAM DAvIS about •

HOWARD CLARK who lives at Ramona.

DAVIS stated he felt he could

trust CLARK completely and backed this up saying that CLARK is

storing some weapons for him. DAVIS said he had also been working

on some machine guns with CLARK at Ramona at one time andaded

that: ebAht can get 211 of the TNT and t-4 plastic explosives ho-

DAVIS said he would get a list of prices of this stuff

BaR eLARa on February 45, 1971, and added that he, DaVIs, has

to go to court that morning to answer charges on three traffic

warrants.

• DAVIS also told me he will be going up to Mud River,

Idaho, sometime in the early part of this summer with several

other

people to live.

He said he will give me his address there

when it becomes available to him as he wants to stay in touch

with me.

It appears this may be a Minutemen commune he has been

talking

about starting for several months now.

ON JANUARY 26, 1971, BY JEROME

This morning I answered an ad in the newspaper

and purchased a .22 calibre Remington rifle for $20.00.

I bought the gun from a Negro individual by the name of

MAURY (ph) (LNU) who is presently residing at 5880 University,

Apartment #9. He looked to me to be in his late 20's, about

5' 9" tall and slender and was wearing a goatee beard and a

moustache. He wore his hair in a modified Afro style and

resembled comedian BILL COSBY very much, both in physical

appearance and mannerisms.

He told me he had just moved to san Diego from Los

Angeles and is looking for work.

While I was at his apartment, I noticed he had large

quantities of Black Panther and other black militant literature,

including books by ELDRIDGE CLEAVER and copies of the Black

Panther Party newspaper.

--

In addition to the .22 calibre rifle, he also had

in his possession a •32 calibre automatic pistol which is a

cheap imitation of the French MAB and is made in Spain.

It has been learned that there is a San Diego Police

Department officer named BOB SISK who claims he is a member of

the Minutemen organization.

I was in contact with GILBERT MC GILL Sunday. He is

Source also learned there was to be a closed

meeting at 3:00 p.m., on 2/11/71, to plan for the

Sunday evening meeting.

Following this the microphone was opened to

the audience but only one individual, a young male

Individual with long hair and wearing no shirt or shoes,

took advantage of the opportunity.

He spoke against

carrying the Viet Cong flag and against trying to destroy

the system saying he believed the necessary changes

could be made within the established frame work. He

was not too well received..

Source also acquired a leaflet distributed by

members of the Student Mobilization Committee (SMC) at

the University of California at San Diego (UCSD).

The

leaflet called for a massive demonstration against the

local draft board office on Park Boulevard and

starting

with a "mass-in" at the local board building at 10:00 a.M.,

on 2/16/71.

The leaflet indicated that persons interested

in participating should assemble in the Urey Hall parking

Iot at UCSD at 9:15 a.m., on 2/16/71. Other persons

desiring to attend should find their own transportation.

For further information interested persons were requested

to call telephone number 453-3362.

The leaflet stated that SMC desired to obtain

the signatures of enough people so that during the period

2/16/71 - 2/19/71, 20 persons per hour could be assigned

to be present at the draft board for harassment

purposes.

: The leaflet indicated that there are many legal

forms of harassment which should be engaged in such as

bringing any kind of garbage or miscellaneous articles

to be filed in a registrant's folder as Selective Service

law states that a registrant may place anything in his

folder which he feels is pertinent to his draft status.

The leaflet urged registrants to appear at

the draft board simply to examine their file, or to

ask any of a numoer of questions regarding their draft

status or the Selective Service System itself.

The leaflet urged females to appear at the

draft board and demand to be allowed to register for

the draft denouncing the Selective Service System as

sexist and racist

; or to f10od the place

with tears

asking that their boy friends, brothers, etc., be

exempted from the draft.

The leaflet also urged interested persons to

deluge the draft board with letters requiring file

searches and return correspondence in an effort to

tie up the system.

It pointed out that females by

using their first

initial and last name could request

Information from their non-existant files without

being traced.

In addition, the leaflet urged persons to

tie up the draft board telephone lines with many

miscellaneous telephone calls.

Also obtained was a leaflet requesting help

ana support in the case of SAMUEL C. MILIER, a prisoner

in the brig at the 32nd Street Naval Station.

The

leaflet was issued by Concerned Officers Movement and

Indicated the group has a house at 3700 Tenth Street,

Today I checked the Minutemen Post Office

Box at upring valley, calliornia, and lound a letter

addressed to AFSC.

The person

sending the letter

used regular Minutemen precautions in sending it,

such as double wrapping the message.

The message itself was written on a two inch

1o0ks. very interesting and I plan to go ahead and make

the contact as requested on the note.

I have learned recently that SAM DAVIS and TOM

FORREST have been doing a lot of business together for

some time.

The name RONALD TIMOTHY DOMENICK Or DOMINIC iS

not familiar to me but the name "PAUL"

and the description

you gave me sounds like an individual who hangs around

with FORREST and some of the other gun people.

I also have heard a rumor before that FORREST is

operating some kind of

' a shop on the Mexican boarder and

FORREST allegedly deals in a lot of illegal stuff.

FORREST has had two large boats and lost both

of them.

There is a story around which I believe is

probably true that his second boat was bombed as a result

of a quarrel or something over smuggling. I have never

heard anything about him having any hand grenades on the

buat but he may have had some kind of high explosives

on it.

With regard to the Gun Smoke Ranch being for

sale, it is my understanding that all of the

people at

the ranch including DAVIs, HOOVER,

WILLIS and several

others will eventually be

going to the Mud Rives, Idaho,

area..

Yesterday at 7:00 a.m.s I contactea the

individual who sent the note in the mail as he had

requested.

We made arrangements to meet together at

the Denny's Restaurant in El Cajon. I plan to have

SAM DAVIS Or GEORGE HOOVER or both there to watch

the meeting and make sure nothing funny happens.

The person I talked to on the telephone gave

me what he said was

his Minuteman Serial Numoer.

subsequently checked this number with BETTIE HOUGHTON

who said the number is a good one and falls within a

block of numbers which she said she knows was legitimately

issued. She said she has access to some files which

may include this number so that possibly she can find

out who the person is.

While I was making the call I had FRANK YACOPEC

watching the telephone booth up at Alpine.

to have a flat tire by stopping about a half a mile down

the road from the telephone booth where he let some air

....out of one of his tires. He then drove his car to an air

pump at a service station near the telephone booth where

he was able to watch the person who received the call.

After the call was. over he followed this individual to

a side street named Marshall Road. When he got to the

road and looked the person had disappeared. He said there

were only two cars on the road which looked like they

had been driven recently which had the following license

plate numbers:

WAB 703

and

YCB 714

obtained the following information:

He said that one PAUL HUNT at Santa Monica,

California, is the person who is actually in charge of

the Minutemen in the State of California or at least

in that area and he has been so in charge since the

disappearance of TROY HOUGHTON. He added that DENNIS

MOVER is only a public figurehead and added that he

thinks PAUL HUNT is a

On the subject of TROY HOUGHTON, I have learned

from both DAVIS and BILL CLAY that HOUGHTON's contacts

may have been much more widely spread than I thought.

specifically, they told me that HOUGHTON was behind an

attempt several years ago by 18 "hunters" in the State

of New York to conduct sabotage and terrorist attacks

on New Left Groups.

These 18 individuals were supposedly

arrested and a large quantity of weapons and ammunition

was confiscated.

I also talked some more with DAVIS about TOM

FORREST and it appears that they know each other extremely

DAVIS said he had some business dealings with

FORREST involving some machine guns and other items.

DAVIS apparently has decided not to get rid

of as much of his explosives and so forth as

he originally

said.

he has a small quantity of I.N.I. and also some

C4 Plastic explosives which he will sell at $10 a pound

which is too high a price.

He said he can also obtain a military weapon

which is like a bazooka and has a self-contained 3.5"

rocket sound in an expendable launcher. He said the price

of this is $25.

of Ios Angeles (via Dennis loso of Escondido) if he would do this,

Eddy stated that he would like to see the formation of a security

Force with teeth in it but does not consider himself to be enough

of a leader to do it himself.

While declining to lead a Security Force, Eddy did say that

the only way to stop iBi infiltration of rightist groups would be

is positive that Ion Knight's San Diego unit of the Nazi Party has

a regular FBI infiltrator. The only three men of whom he is not sus-

picious are Mickey Wakefield, Ray Wilson and Gerald Smith. Said Eddy,

"Those three men dropped out of the thing and so I figure they're okay

but you can bet that the fini is still in there pushing".

Ioso said that the whereabouts of people like Barry Godfrey

should be learned

and they should be telephoned and intimidated.

Eddy said he thinks such intimidationg would be a waste of time and

that people like Godfrey should be killed. Mickey Wakefield of San

Marcos went along with iddy's suggestion. Ron Eddy also mentioned

having had an encounter with an FBI agent named Peterson in San Diego

but did not elaborate.

Eddy firmly believes that any man who commits himself to one

organization in the Far Right should not be involved. with others.

He says he would be very suspicious of anyone nho is. He is also

somewhat suspicious of Tom Knight. He says that Joe Brinker gave

Here is one last bit of information. The New Christian Crusade

people are very concerned about the imprisonment of George Hoover of

the secret Army Organization. At one of their banquets the NCC had

four unoccupied places set at the table which were in honor of four

men whom they hold to be absent heroes.. These four men were Joe licCart:

George Hoover, Charles Lindbergh and a man named R. Miles.

Anyway, it has been learned that a man whom Iom Metzger knows

1s going to take a dossier of the Hoover case to some congressman

In Washington, D.C. who is part of a committee currently scheduled

to investigate the FBI. The dossier consists of newspaper clippings

and other material pertaining to Hoover's activities in the SAO, his

arrest, conviction, appeal, etc. They are hoping to stir up a big

publicity stink to give the FBI a bad name due to Barry Godfrey's

activities and in so doing hope to effect an eventual release of Hoover

from prison. By the way, the NCC people do not refer to Hoover by..

his correct name. For some reason they all call him Mickey Hoover.

That is about all for now. I hope this will be of some help

to jou.

two shots were fired

through Bohmer's window. His triend, Paula Tharp

was wounded in the elbow.

As a result, police began to investigate the SAO.

The informer told how Yakonec met him at the

fence between their yards, still flushed from his

bombing exploit of the previous night.

Godfrey testified Yakopec described " ... the

sound, the blast, how the dust hung over the air at

the theater ... how he stood down at the end of the

block and listened to the blast. He then described to

me how he placed the bomb, what type of a bomb he

used, and how he carried it down the alley and

planted it."

Frederick Hetter. Yakopec's attorney, believed

his client might have had grounds for pleading

entrapment but the jury found Yakopec guilty

anyway.

Godfrey's friendship

Yakopec, a former Minuteman sympathizer,

became Godfrey's lieutenant in the SAO. Together.

they discussed their mutual hate of pornography and

communism and explored their common loves -

guns and explosives.

it was Godfrey who sold Yakopec the explosives he

used to bomb the Guild Theater. Godtrey said he

reported the transaction te the FBI.

But Godfrey maintained he advised his lieutenant

"he should bury them an save them for after the

Communist takeover."

Conviction

Upheld In

Shooting

The state Supreme Court

has upheld the conviction of

George Mitcheil Hoover, 37,

a key figure in a series of

triais here in 1972 involving

alleged members of the

right-wing paramilitary Se-

cret Army Organization.

The Supreme Court ruling,

was announced by the

office of Dist. Atty. Edwin L:

Miler, follows an Oct. 30,

1915, decision by the Fourth

District Court of Appeal.

reversing the conviction of

Hoover. The attorney gener-

al's office took the case to

the Supreme Court.

Hoover,

formerly of:

Santee, was sentenced to

five years to life in state

prison in January. 1973, fol-

lowing his conviction in Su-

perior Court on charges of

•assault. with

a deadly.

weapon, firing into an occu-

pied dwelling and possession

of a billy club.

Hoqver appealed the con-

viction through Appellate

Defenders, Inc., questioning

the credibility of a key pro-

secution witness. The wit-

ness was Howard Barry Go-

direy, a former San Diego

fireman who was a paid FBI

informant assigned to infil-

trate extremist groups..

Hoover contended the Su-

perior Court jury should

nave been allowed to weigh

whether Godfrey was work

ing as a "double agent" with

'both the FBI and the Secret

Army Organization, finally

deciding to testify for the

state to protect himself.

The charges

against

Hoover stemmed from the

firing. of a bullet into the

home of Peter Bohmer. then

a former assistant professor

•at San Diego State Universi.

- ty; on Jan. 6, 1972. The bullet.

struck a friend of Bohmer;

Paula Tharp, 23, wounding

her in the arm. Bohmer re-

sided on Muir Avenue in

Ocean Beach at the time.

It has been learned that Jack I. Du long attended

a meeting of the Greater Los Angeles Area Citizens

councils held on this date in the Sparton Room of

the Olympian motor Hotel at 1903 West Olympic Blvd.

In Los Angeles California. Ine meeting was set for

8pu and did start within a few minutes of 8pm. A

total of 19 or 20 people were on hand for the meeting.

Roderic Duff conducted the meeting. He is the GLAACO.

leader. He announced that this was the first GLAACU

meeting in a year and a hall. He indicated that GIdduC

had interested itself with local issues during this

time. He outlined work in monrovia involying the schools

and a local election. Duff stated he planned an

important meeting in two nonths, in late January 1913.

He did not state why there would be another meeting

so soon alter this gathering. It would be unusual

riew of the fact that this meeting was the first

in eighteen months. Duff discussed the "blood program"

that was mentioned in their mail out report of last

week in which GLAAUC members would donate blood to

other GIACC members only when needed and then direct

from dowry to donor. in brief the plan is to prevent

a GINAUi member ITOl receiving blood from a black. It

appears ine meeting was called only to hear two speakers.

First to speal was a man believed to be named kick Horioz.

Report by DON CLARK

Meeting of Colonel WILLIAM GALE at

O'Neira Hall on the Evening of

March 28, 1974, San Diego, California

4/5/34

Approximately 75 persons were present at that

meeting. It included, among others, GEORGE UDVARY,

VICTOR B. WALTON, MICKEY WAKEFIELD,

ELLEN ADAMS, BILL MILLER,,

JONATHAN VEST, "JOE BRINKER,

HARRIET BRINKER, JANỆT BRINKER, COlonel WILLIAM GALE, ANN

Nullek, and

others who, are

very old and very inactive.

There were

number of individuals present who

are as yet

GEORGE UDVARY does not seem to have made his

move yet--permanent mongou

of the area. He's still in

process, I believe,

best I

.can tell at this time. MICKEY

WAKEFIELD

came down

"from Escondido, was hoping to run

into some of his para-military friends, one or two of whom

did notjevidently arrive. He did runtinto VICTOR. WALTON

who he is close to. BILL MILLER was there and very involved

on the surface at least. • ELLEN ADAMS

was distributing

literature. JOE and HARRIET BRINKER came in from Escondido

and of course are primarily responsible for putting on that

monthly meeting and so they were working with that.

## Page 771

There was security that night--more so than

would ordinarily be expected. A fellow by the name of

DENNIS was inside wiih a 23-charmel, flyatt ertizens Band

walkie-talkie, Realistic brand,so

sold by Radio Shack.

He

kept monitoring another individual whose name I do

not have

He had a two of three channel Citizens

Band walkie-talkie, Midland brand, land they were checking

to see lI anyone would give them any trouble.

This was

because of a publication that indicated where their meeting

would be held. They didn't indicate what they would do if

such trouble arrived.

Colonel GALE discussed an article on himself and

the identity movement as written up in Volume V; Issue 14,

of a bi-monthly publication, called the San Diego Door.

I believe that's a March, 1974 issue. Colonel GALE read

directly from the article and made comments and corrections

as he went.

He said, now I will read--follow this and read as

much.

as possible that

article:

agens relevant I e read from the

"But the pubit meetings are only part of the

the

para-military part/os his orsanization

That part is

called Identity' andhas so far incorporated many old

Minutemen and secret army elements in Southern California."

To that, Colonel GALE indicated that "Identity"

was-the name of his church publication--he thought it was

was sometning else.

Thelor gil Eary part at their operation is under

such titles

as the "Christian Posse

Association

I will make another quote here from the publication:

"JERRY LYNN DAVIS, the ex-head of the SAO in California,

has been reported at GALE's public meetings." According

DENTITIE

to MICKEY WAKEFIELD who was

meeting. DAVIS had not, as far. as he knew, ever been to a

San Diego meeting.

Another quote Colonel GALE made: "Identity is

organized in similar fashion to other underground organizations-

small cells communicate through a series of intermediaries

and blind post office boxes.'

Colonel CAlE did not

Another quote Colonel GALE made from the article:

"In San Diego, GALE can be heard speaking to his congregation

on the fourth Thursday of every month at the O'Neira Club

on Holly Street" or something of that nature "between 34th

and 35th Streets, one block south of Adams Avenue." The

street was incorrectly quoted--it's Hawley, and Colonel

GALE made an observation on that, indicating he thought

the information was transferred to the person at this publication

NW 68262 Docld:32989523 Page 772

---

## Page 773

telephone and that he figured, he had that all figured

out that way because the person must have misunderstood

the name

and got it wrong.

The next quote from the publication:

"According

to one law enforcement source, Identity has fabout 50 members

in the San Diego area, including members of the

Another quote he

Indicated:

"As for GALE, he

pretends to be a minister

of his church and operates through

It as his tont. CAll was one of the driving forces behind

the militant Christian Defense League (CDL) in the 60's.

He had formed the small California Rangers in the late 50°s.

The California

State Attorney General's Office described

the Rangers as,

,," then they put a quöte in here, in this article,

•: "A secret inderground guerrilla force, linked with other

non-military organizations by a common ideology and leader-

ship.'

Colonel GALE indicated at this meeting the Rangers!

were

registered with the state and had support of Californial

law enforcement.

Another quote from the article that the Colonel

MW 68262 Docld:32989523 Page 773

## Page 774

made

"GALE's strategy to recruit members through veterans

organizations was thwarted in 1963 when the long Beach Press

include the klan, the National States' Rights Party, and

jany other Right Wing group's." Colonel GALE admitted

that he was very active.

this, counter-insurgency information. He indicated that he

that was with the guerrilla activities in the Philippines,.

which was also indicated in this article.

Then, another interesting thing, he quoted: "The

SAO was in large part organized by HOWARD B. GODFREY, an

FBI Agent." He didn't have anything notable to say about

GODFREY.

Actually, one of the things he indicated, too,

In this discussion of his was that there is a lot of diffi-

culty getting different right wing groups to cooperate in

a military fashion and that that is very necessary and

set the impression that he prattemptins,

and wishes to whip

He also indicated his

anyone who gives them any trouble. He indicated that he

had communication links all over -that from his car he

could talk immediately with his link in Saugus--I don't

know what link he was referring to, but it was in Saugus,

and in Glendale and other areas like- that, which he mentioned.

That covers much of his comments at that particul

lar meeting. There was quite a lot of response--the pepple

enjoyed

that immensely. It was a reaction/similar to a

grandstanding and I think he was

milking

for all he

could get.

San Diego, Caiifornia, 92101, telephone number in San Diego

232-5658.

answers during

this session. JO BRINER was bassinz/out blank pieces

of paper

so that people

blank pieces of paper, JOE BRINKER

a throw-away.

the tax revolt. The heading was "Sunny

San Diego Invites

You to 1974's Biggest Tax Expo" and then

anothernheading, "Tax Foes Tell. Ihy and How They Stopped

Paying Income Tax," etc., /etc. It talked about meetings in

the

San

Diego area on that. Registration forms for special

get-togethers, in this case, Sheratom Inn-Airport on

Friday, April Sth

and Saturday, April 6th, 7 P.M. to 11 P.M.

on Friday, April 5th; 9 A.M. to 5 P.M. Saturday, April 6th.

For those who wish to write for information, they'd write to

(for registration or information) to Tax Expo, 1570 Lily

Avenue,

Cajon, California 92021. Now whether this: point

was being stressed more by JOE BRINKER or whether it was also

inder the tacit approval of Colonel GALE, I do not know.

intrustworthy. Walton says Godfrey was too pre-occupied with firearms

to appeal to the SAO affiliates.

That is all for now.

Feels that the author is wrongto use a religious apora

to try

to provide an answer to what is essentially a political and racial

problem. Makefield thinks the book's greatest weakness. is the fact

it so vehemently attacks Christianity. He believes that most rightists

who have any religious sense of being at all would reject thishas quickli

as most Americans already reject the Swastila. Smith has not yet become

acquainted with the book and so had no opinion to offer.

Vic' Walton's Attitude

Vic Walton recently expressed his opinion of Ceorge Mitchell Hooves

He said of Hoover, "He is not the kind of man I would ever want to have

for an enemy because I don't think he would hesitate to do you in".

Walton continued, "However, Hoover seems like a real nice guy". "He

is very quiet and doesn't have much to say".

Walton is very anxious to have Ron Eddy of Poway read Nature's

Eternal Religion. Walton is really making a determined effort to push

this book. Its author, Ben Klassen; seems to think Hitler was the best

thing that ever happened to the world and concludes his book by saying

that ultirately the wite race will have to occupy all the usable land

on Earth. That kind of tells you something without really saying it.

Walton says that Barry Godfrey once told him that his (Walton's) telepho

was bugged.

That's it for now.

Walton has recently been geeing a lot of a man named William Drexel.

Drexel is said to be as ex-judge who was disbarred in December, 1973

Drexel is apparently very much opposed to

the Federal Reserve System and during his judicial tenure, he once had

that he also earns money by purchasir

It is knight's hope to try to sell copies of white pover newspaper at this

meeting. Walton and Mickey Wakefield have also been requested by fright

to attend this affair.

Walton believes that Rick Stanley has a small amount of non-White

I disturbing the peace on Wednesday, November 21, 1973. Eddy also

iceiterated his hope that bail on George Hoover will be lowered suffic-

jently to get him out. Eddy said he would be willing to borrow money

fIom his credit union and put up the equity in his house as collateral

to get Hoover out of jail. Eddy says that the only way to prevent people

from serving as informants for the FBI is to make examples of some of

them. Eddy believes that Hoover would murder Barry Godfrey i1 he could

find him and I think he is hoping something like that will happen.

When it becomes necessary for Godfrey to return to San Diego, I cannot

over-emphasize the importance of maintaining heavy security for him.

If he thought he had half a chance of getting away with it, I believe

Eddy himself would murder Godfrey just to "make an example".

That 1s about all that is known to have happened in the past couple

of days. I hope it is of use to you.

Has the news media blackout in San Diego got you down? Well, it's got u!

down too. Last issue the DOOR ran a story about the activities of CREEP spy

Donald segretti in San Diego. The srory was imporiant enough for the New

York Times (see below) to pick it up. In addition, it has been reprinted in the

Washington Post and a number of other places.

All week the DOOR has been

getting phone calls trom around the

country about our story. It has all been very rewarding. — but also very

frustrating. Here we are sitting on a major news story and with the exception

of KGB — no San Diego news outlet has picked it up, or even called us to

check the story out!!!

The DOOR will continue its investigation into San Diego's Watergate

connections. And we will print whatever we find out! We hope that the

other news media in San Diego will get off their asses and do some work.

We will be glad to take them under our wing and give them a lead or two. Im

any event, you can read all about it right here in the DOOR.

We are reprinting the article from the New York Times so our readers can.

Davis told the -

According to Davis, Godfrey hoped

do provote a rior and possibly a counter-

riot by the pole. The purpose of such a

The DOOK in crissation has learned

that there was a rond nirried effort by

"CRLEP, the FBI, are oiner governmen-

would disrupt the Republican FlAsCO.

It appears that these plans wore drawn

would have blamed any violence on

Muskie supporters.

When it became

nomination lorked up and that the ITT

scandal had forced the convention 1o

clearly toned. down. It is our theory that

Nixon and his staff felt that they could

On 1/12/72 Informant was contacted by writer at

which time he furnished the following information.

Recently the Secret Army Organization prepared and •

distributed a special bulletin regarding PETER GEORGE BOHMER.

Response from Right Wing sympathizers to this bulletin has

been very encouraging and consequently, on 1/5/72, source was

given an assignment by JERRY LYNN DAVIS, leader of the SAO,

to conduct a surveillance of the residance of BOHMER at 5155

Vuir, Ocean Beach, for the purpose of obtaining additional

"Intelligence information, such as license plate numbers and

descriptions of occulants. F

this information was

to be used in the preparation of a future

Intelligence bulletin of the SAO.

In order to avoid going on this assignment alone,

source contacted GEORCE M. HOOVER, an associate of members of

the SAO, and requested that he accompany source:

that the

incident had come as a complete surprise to him,

was

available in as discreet a manner as possible. He said

he is estremely upset and dismayed at the turn of events

and would like to end his association with these individuals,

but, as before, could see no practical way of doing so at this

time.

It is noted that Informant has been repeatedly

injury or death for any individual.

HOOVER are presently aware of the incident. He said it is

his understanding the gun involved has been permanently dis-

have caased HOOVER to become quite "fires up"

and to be ready

for a violent confrontation with the police if he should be

approached on the mitter. Source said he doubts HOOVER will

discuss the matter with

anyone else but cannot be sure of

this.

He said tha ZOOVER has never been interviewed before

FROM

SAC ROBERT W. EVANS (170-411)

SUBJECT: EXTREMIST INFORMANTS

EXTREMIST MATTERS

A recent article appearing in the Black Panther

Party (BPP) Cleaver Faction publication "Right On!" calls

for swift and unmerciful retaliation against current and

former extremist informants.

• This article contains numerous

inflammatory statements and

may well. signal the initiation

of widespread retaliation

against our informants.

Recently seized items from the Republic of New

Africa (RNA) included instructions to RNA members concerning

the indoctrination of those members suspected of being law

enforcement informants.

the completion of a personal questionnaire form and background

investigation.

Each agent should recognize the continuing possibility

of infiltrators within our extremist informant ranks.

There

have been attempts in the past to penetrate informant ranks,

and we can logically expect there will be attempts in the

future in this regard.

Therefore,. all agents are reminded of

the importance of in-depth background investigation and personal

knowledge of each informant, as well as the necessity for

careful verification and evaluation of information furnished

by extremist informants.

Each agent handling an extremist informant,

including extremist ghetto informants, should be thoroughly

alert to the absolute necessity for handling these informants

under the most secure conditions in order to eliminate the

possibility of these informants being exposed.. All agents

should also bring to the attention of their informants the

Republic of New Africa's methods of disclosing infiltrators

in order that our informants will be, forewarned.

Dear Mr. Evans:

Thank you for your letter of July ¿6, 1971.

I advised all párties to our conference on July 23,

1971, that the Attorney General has beer given statutor any

authority by Congress to provide witness protection

facilities if necessary.

The Attorney (eneral's statutory

authority in this matter is the Organized Crime Control Act

of 1970.

However, before any implementation of this act

takes place, the United States Attorney's Office must con-

sult with the

Criminal Division of the Department of Justice.

Should it become necessary that your informant testi-

fies in the ATFD case, the matter of this informant's safety

will be brought to the attention of the Department of Jus-

tice.

If you have any further questions, please do not hesi-

tate to contact me.

Very truly yours,

discussed with their son their son's possible relocation

The parents stated that they were

the possibility of relocating SD 1155-R to that state inas-

During

this conversation, Mr. GODFREY mentioned

of the

""Phantom Militiaormant sald the bulletin bore he name

, and was to be distributed on a

completely anonymous basis. About two days after publication

of the bulletin and before distribution had taken place, CLAY

contacted HAYWARD and others and indicated the paper should not

be distributed, although it was noted that one copy had already

been distributed to the front door of the Good Morning Teaspoon.

Informant subsequently determined that CLAY's reason for

removal of these bulletins was that one of the names indicated

on the list was known only to CLAy and publication of this man's

name and background would have positively identified CLAY as the

source of information relative to this individual's activities.

Informant, on 12/6/68, Indicated he had attended a

meeting of the lakeside Conservative Council held at the weslian.

Church, Lakeside, on River Street, attended by approximate 26

individuals.

The film was shown on gun control laws which film

was made available by the Patriotic Society. Informant identified

some of those present as WALT HAYWARD, BILL CLAY, STAN MC DADE,

• JERRY GIYER, ROBIE ROBINSON, and this ROBINSON is employee of

the telephone company, and others whose names were unknown to

informant.

Informant

indicated he believes MC DADE 1s active

in the Patriotic Society, and describea him as a white male,

approximately 45 to 50 years of age, 5' 9"

, 225 pounds, dark

hair, wears a goatee and mustache.

Informant furnished the address of WALTER HAYWARD aS

12067 Riverside Drive, Lakeside, California, telephone 448-2954.

He indicated that at a

meeting on 12/6/68,

HAYWARD, CLAY and

others present, discussed ways and means of agitating the Peace

and Freedom Party and the Black Panther Party to get them to

fight among themselves.

Informent said that the latest publication

of the Patriotic Party had been a survival bulletin which contained

direct quotations from

Staff Publication.

Informant said that since the gun control law has become

so common that numerous individuals have been attempting to obtain

and hide as many weapons and as much ammunition as possible.

Informant said he had recently determined that JERRY GIYER in

addition to possessing many other weapons, has a .50 callber Colt

machine gun, an anti-tank rifle, a line-throwing gun, and an

M-14 rifle.

Informant advised on 12/9/68, that WALT HAYWARD and

notifying WALT HAYWARD of thi, HAYWARD made several telephone

calls, attempting to agitate the Black Panthers and to create

know all other members, efforts are being made to develop

additional quality informant coverage to insure complete

The San Diego Division has intensified its

investigation into members and suspected Minutemen members

for the purpose of determining

the total membership in the

It is felt that this intensified investigation

contact was made with a thira party, EUGENE BRIN, a reporter

for the "Anaheim Bulletin" and an associate of members of the

Minutemon oxganization in the Los Angeles, California, area,

During the show, several arrests were made, some by

the icchol, Tobacco and Fiscarms Division (NTD). Because

of these arrests and long held attitudes on the part of

DAVIS and BROWN that, although Communism and Socialism pose

threats to their security, the government of this country is

their real

enemy, a decision was reachea by BROWN and D.VIS

that retaliation

should be made against the govechment by

bomoing : TID and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) offices.

Plans were made for the three to meet again the following

Saturday evening at a motel in or near the City di El Cajon,

California, the exact time and place not then specified.

At

this meeting, final plans would be made for the bombing and

specific targets selected, one in the ios Angeles, California,

area which BROWN would handle, and one at San Diego, california,

which DAVIS would handle.

In apparent furtherance of this schene, DAVIS

delivered to the informant on two occasions, two metal

ammunition cans for storage and safekeeping. These cans were

found to contain several pounds of INT explosives, 18 hand

grenade fuse assemblies, two rifle grenades, approximately

275 blasting caps of various sizes and types, a military hand

illuminating grenade, a number of parts for converting i-l

and M-15 riiles to the corresponding i2 and i-16 fully

such as photographs and tape recordings substantiating

the conspiratorial

meeting to take place on the evening of

June 26, 1971, would be necessary.

For as yet unexplained

reasons, subject Brown did not appear for the meeting on the

evening of June 26, 1971, and has not suosequently been seen

or heard icon by either the informant or subject DAVIS. Informant

197 the into mot

has advised that to his knowleäge no additional plans

have been

made or work done toward carrying out the above-described

bombings.

on July 20, 1971, subject DAVIS requested that the

hand illuminating grenade included in the explosives given by

him to the informant, be returned to him on the weekena of

July 24 - 25, 1971, indicating he had some use for the weapon

but not elaborating further on the matter.

on July 23, 1971, following consultation with Assistant

U.S. Ettorney ROBERT

P. RISSO, newly appointed Chief of the

Criminal Complaint Section, and with representatives of the San

Diego ITFD office, authorization was granted by RISSC and by

aTFD for the hand illuninating grenade to be returned to DAVIS

through the informant. This was only to be done on the condition

that the illuminating grenade was effectively deactivated.

•at this same time, RISSO stated he saw no possible

way so obtain successful pirsecution of DAVIS in this matter.

Furthermose,

he avised that he would in no way authorize

return of the remaining items of explosives to DAVIS.

On july 23, and 26, 1971, the source pointed out

that DIVIS' request that the land illuminating grenade be

returned to him points up the tact that his request for other

parts or all of the items entrusted by him to the informant

is imninent.

Because of his asscciation with D. VIS, whon

the infcinant believes to be bordering on being mentally

irrational, infermant is convinced that for whatever reason,

when it becomes necessary for him in tell DiVIS he cannot return

these materials io him it will becone obvious to DAVIS that the

informant is exactly that of has in some other way betrayed him,

and that DiVIS will then take reprisal of a violent nature

against the inforrant and his family.

FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

San Diego, California

August 2, 1971

JERRY LYNN DAVIS;

EUGENE BROWN

The following is information in addition to our

communication dated July 27, 1971:

On Jüly 26s

1971, the informant who has furnished

the previous information in this case, was approached on

the

subject of relieving him of custody of certain explosive

materials previously furnished to him by subject DAVIS, by

the

use of a search

warrant for the explosives at his home.

The search warrant,

it was felt, would serve the purpose of

explaining to DAVIS why this informant could not produce. the

explosives. After lengthy consideration, the informant

declined to accept this suggestion as a workable solution to

the

problem.

The informant is convinced that regardless of

the

reason given, when he advises DAVIS he no longer has

possession of the explosives, DAVIS's anger. will cause him to

become irrational to the point that he would commit some act

or acts of violence against the informant or his family.

Informant continued to be of the opinion that due to the fact

the explosives could not be made available for return to DavIs,

the only safe course of action for him and his family would

be relocation in an area where the informant and his family

would be out of DAVIS's reach.

On July 28, 1971, the informant's parents tele-

phonically contacted

the San Diego Division of the FBI.

They

advised that based on their knowledge of JERRY LYNN DAVIS,

and other individuals with whom their son had been associating,

they felt his concern for the personal safety of both himself

and his family was completely justified.

The parents advised

that they contemplated moving to the state of Hawaii in the

near

future for reasons of health.

JERRY LYNN DAVIS;

EUGENE BROWN

In addition, the parents indicated they were not

satisfied solely with

the possibility of the informant's

relocation to Boise, Idaho, and felt that in

addition to

relocation, the federal Bureau of Investigation should secure

a job for

the informant at the place of relocation comparable

to the $12,000 a year job he presently holds at San Diego:

The parents advised they had suggested to intormant the

possibility of his relocation in Hawaii, as they felt there

should be an abundance of employment opportunities with the

U.S. Government in that state and that the Federal Bureau of

Investigation should

be able to get one for their son without

too much diificulty.

During this conversation, the informant's father

advised he (the father) has friends in Washington, D.C., and

that if

it appeared help might be necessary in obtaining

authorization for relocation and the securing of employment

for the informant, he would be glad to contact these people

for any assistance they might be able to render.

On July 29, 1971, the informant was recontacted at

which time he stated

he had continued to give the matter of

relocation considerable thought. He pointed out that his

for some time, been trying to convince him of

the desirability of moving to the state of Hawaii. He explained

that his parents have resided and visited in that state several

times, and are contemplating moving there permanently in the

near future for health and business reasons.

Informant

advised he personally continues to feel that relocation at

Boise, Idaho, would be more advantageous to him. He stated

he would appreciate assistance from the Federal Bureau of

Investigation in finding employment there.

Informant further advised that the home in which

he lives at San Diego is being purchased through a Federal

Housing Administration (FHA) loan and has a current market

value of approximately $20,000.

said that subsequent to

making the original estimate of

$1,500 to $2,000, as

the cost

of relocating him to another place, the points required

for liquidating FHA loans have raised from 2 to 10.

He said that this meant that while originally it would have

cost him only $400 to pay off his FHA loan, he is now faced

with the problem of paying $2,000 to do the same thing. The

informant

feels that it will now cost him approximately

$3,000 to $3,500 to relocate at Boise, Idaho.

This is to advise of information developed by captioned

informant disclosing a shooting incident arising from activities

of the newly organized white extremist Secret Army Organization.

By menorandum dated 1/11/72, you were advised of the

formation and accivities oi the newly formed ultraconservative

white extremist paramilitary group known as Secret Army Organiza-

tion (SAO). SAO has targeted for harassment San Diego State

College Professor Peter Bohmer. Bohmer's residence is a well-known

New Left commune, whose occupants, along with Bohmer,

are planning

demonstrations at the Republican National Convention

scheduled at

San Diego for August, 1972.

Captioned informant, a 28-year-old white male operated

since August, 1967, has been recently targeted to penetrate the

extremist-oriented SAO. On January 6, 1972, informant was

requested by SAO leader to surveil. Bohmer's residence in order

obtain intelligence information. Accompanying informant on/

surveillance was SAO associate George M. Hoover. The surveillance,

held during the evening of January 6, 1972, was discontinued after.

*the Bohmer residence appeared unoccupied.

However, prior to

discontinuance, an SAO sticker was left at the front door. While

passing in front of the house in informant's automobile, Hoover,

without warning and to the complete dismay of informant, fired

two shots into the house. The informant strongly protested and

they sped away. A female occupant of the house reportedly

sustained minor gunshot wound in her elbow.

Informant furnished details of the shooting, which

would not have been available through any other source, and

cautioned that Hoover is "fired up" over the incident and ready

for a violent confrontation should police approach him on this

i matter.

Identities of those involved in shooting not known to

San Diego police; however, witnesses did furnish description of

informant's automobile.

This informant, during his utilization, has furnished

exceptionally valuable information on the Minutemen and has been

completely reliable. He has been previously cautioned, as all

extremist informants are, not to become directly involved in

violent confrontations or activities.

He is the only Bureau

source covering the violence-prone SAO, San Diego has advised

that pertinent information developed by informant will be

furnished to the San Diego Police Department but informant's

identity withheld unless disclosure bacomes necessary. There

appears to be no objection to this, and San Diego will be

instructed to closely follow this matter and promptly report

pertinent developments.

Brownfield to Jenkins Memo

RE: LAURITZ P. MILLER

of the San Diego Office August 10, 1967, while employed as

an equipment-checker for Pacific Telephone and Telegraph

Company, San Diego, California. A gun hobbyist, Army trained

in the use of explosives, he became associated with the top

echelon of the Minutemen as well as the Secret Army Organization

(SAO), furnishing excellent information to the FBI regarding

these

and other extremists groups.

By communication dated November 20, 1972, the

San Diego Office discontinued Godfrey as an informant. Godfrey

had testified in San Diego County Superior Court in the trial

of George Mitchell Hoover, SAO member charged with attempted

murder, and in the trial of William Francis Yakopec, who was

Found guilty of the bombing of the Guild Theater in San Diego.

At that time, Godfrey also was scheduled to testify against

Jerry Lynn Davis, SAO leader charged with illegal possession

of explosives.

SA Petersen also testified in Hoover's trial and

had been Godfrey's contacting Agent.

As a result of Godfrey's

appearances as a prosecutioi

witness, his identity as an FBI informant was publicized in the

news media. (137-17222, 157-17513-10)

Regarding Miller:

Our files show that by letter dated November 30,

1971, Miller requested information regarding crimes committed

by juvenile females.

He was furnished a Uniform Crime Reports

Bulletin.

Miller wrote to Acting Director Gray August 11,

1972, furnishing information regarding what he considered

to be a world-wide communist conspiracy ior revolution,

including direct communication between U. S. revolutionaries

and the Japanese.

Miller stated that some American servicemen

were sympathetic with the world revolutionaries and were being

used as couriers. Miller explained he had developed this

information while doing research in Japan.

He requested

information as to whether the FBI knew of the "situation."

By airtel

August 21, 1972, the Los Angeles Office

was advised of Miller's August Ilth letter and was instructed

to interview him.

The LoS Angeles Office further was instructed

to advise Miller of the confidential nature of information contained

in Bureau files and to alert him regarding the jurisdictions of

the respective military services over their personnel.

Sullivan said that because

Mardian as saying he trans-

warned that Hoover "might

Informant has been a gun hobbyist all of his

Iife and was also trained in the use of explo

sives while serving in the United States Army

from 1/18/62 to 1/17/63.

Because of this back-

ground he has a thorough knowledge of firearms,

ammunition and various explosive devices.

though he does not have any close associates

who would be considered to be known criminals,

he maintains acquaintance with numerous indivi

duals who own and operate gun stores and also

other people who are interested in buying and

selling firearms and military type equipment.

His interest and associations have put him into

contact with numerous individuals of possible

interest to this Bureau both because of possible

theft of government property and also due to the

interests of various militant and subversive

groups who have an interest in obtaining firearms

and explosives.

In September 1970, source advised of the opening

of several Post Ofrice

boxes by the MM organization and

furnished the number of the Post Office boxes and the

fictitious names under which they were rented.

In September, source also provided advance infor-

mation on efforts to republish the new left underground

Miscellaneous: (Furnish any change in residence and employment, steps being laken

to advance informani, and any other pertinent information which should

be brought to Bureau's allention.)

Informant has been instructed to report on compensation

received from the Bureau for services as income when filing

his income tax return and he has agreed to comply.

Informant continues to be encouraged to take

advantage of any opportunities to improve his coverage of

activities of interest to the Bureau in the San Diego area.

Due to the somewhat di sorganized nature of the MM organization

and related groups in the san Diego area because of the fugitive

status and arrest of ROBIRT BOLIVAR DE PUGH, National MM leader,

informant has been able to assume a position of leadership among

many right wing oriented individuals in this area.

JERRY LYNN DAVIS,

Also Known is Sam Davis;

EUGENE BROWN

The following is information in addition to our

communications dated June 29, 1971 and July 7, 1971.

-

For the past four and one-hali years, the San

Dierjo Division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation has

bee: operating an informant who has been highly successful

in

enetrating the Minutenan organization in the san Diego,

Callincnia,

In this capacity, informant has performed

an outstanding service to the government and to the nation

in acquiring and making available a large volume of infor-

mation segarding the activities of the Minuteman organization

and reinted groups. In addition, due to the nature of his •

employment, informant has been successfully targeted.

against other unrelated activities and has

provided coverage

and penetration of a number of New Left oriented groups and

demonstrations. The scope of information provided by the

source has often extended beyond the immediate San Diego

area to other parts of the nation. He also has been

instrumental in identifying and following the activitics of

many individuals who are of interest to the rederal Bureau

of Investigation.

Informant has at all times been found

to be stable, trustworthy and reliable.

The Minutemen is a paramilitant group

organized in June, 1960, by ROBERT B.

DE

PUGH in Norborne, Missouri, as a resistance

to the spread of communism

in the United

States by use of guerrilla tactics.

DE PUGH

is currently incarcerated in a Federal

penitentiary

for violation of the federal

Fircarms ACt.

On June 23, 1971, source advised that on the previous

Saturday, June 19, 1971, he was in attendance at a gun show

held at pasadena,

Califcrnia.

JERRY LYIN DAVIS, ALSO INTOWN AS

SAM D. VIS; EUGENS BROWN

WaS JERRY LYNI DiVIS, known to the informant for several years

as a member of the Minutenon organization.

At the show,

contact was made with a third party, EUGENE BROWN, a reporteI

for the "Änaheim Bulletin" and an associate of members of the

Minuteman organization in the los

Angeles, California, area,

if not a member himself.

During the slow, several arrests were made, sore by

the Alcohol, Tobacco and Fircarms Division (AIFD).

Because

of these arrests and long helâ attitudes on the part of

DAVIS and BROWN that, although Communism and Socialism pose

threats to their security, the government of this country is

their real enemy, a decision was reached by BROWN and D-VIS

that setaliation

should be made against the government by

bombing ATFD and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) offices.

Plans were made for the thiee to meet again the following

Saturday evening at a motel, in or near the City of El Cajon,

California, the exact time and place not then specifiea. At

this meeting, final plans would be made for the bombing and

specific cargets selected, one in the Los Angeles, California,

area which BROWN would handle, and one at San Diego, California,

which DAVIS would handle.

In apparent furtherance of this scheme, DAVIS

delivered to the informant on two occasions, two metal

ammunition cans for storage and safekeeping. These cans were

found to contain several pounds of INT explosives, 13 hand

grenade fuse assemblies,

two rifle grenades, approximately

275 blasting caps of various sizes and types, a military hand.

converting il

and k-15 rifles to the corresponding I2 and M-16 fully

automatic weapons and other miscellaneous items.

material was turned over to the Federal Bureau of Investigation

by the informant on June 25, 1971, and was in turn given to

ATFD for possible use as evidence by that agency.

Assistant U.S. Attorney STEPHEN G. NELSON, then

Chief of the Complaint Section,

U.S. Attorney's Office, San

Diego, california, was contacted on June 25, 1971, and

stated that, as then developed, the facts in this case did

not represent a prosecutable violation and that additional

evidence,

such as photographs and tape recordings substantiating

the conspiratorial meeting to take place on the evening of

June 26, 1971, would be necessary.

Ior as yet unexplained

reasons, subject BROT did not appear for the meeting on the

evening of June 26, 1971, and has not subsequently been seen

or heard from by either the informant or subject DiVIS.

Informant

has advised that to his knowledge no additirnal plans have been

made or work done toward carrying out the shove-described

bombings:

on July 20, 1971, subject DAVIS reuested that the

hand illuminating grenade included in the explosives given by

him to the informant, be returned to him on the weekend of

July 24 - 25, 1971, indicating he had sone use for the weapon

•but not elaborating further on the matter.

on July 23, 1971, following consultation with Assistant

U.S. Attorney ROBERT P. RISSO, newly appointeä Chief of the

Criminal Complaint section, and with sepresentatives of the San

Diego ATFD office, authorization was granted by RISSC and by

ATED Ecr the hand illuminating grenade to be returned to DiVIS

through the informant.

This was only to be done on the condition

that the illuminating grenade was effectively deactivated.

At this same time, RISSO stated he saw no possible

way to obtain successful prosecution of D:VIS in this mattes.

Furthermore, he advised that he would in no way authorize

return of the remaining items of explosives to DaVIS.

On July 23, and 26, 1971, the source pointed out

that DiVISi request that the hand illuminating grenade be

returned to him points up the fact that his request icr other

parts or all of the items entrusted by him to the informant

is imminent.

Because of his association with DaVIS, whom

the iníormant believes to be bordering on being mentally

irrational, informant is convinced that for whatever reason,

when it becomes necessary for him to tell D.VIS he cannot return

these materials to him it will become obvious to DAVIS that the

informant is exactly that of has in some other way betrayed him,

and that D.VIS will then take reprisal of a violent

nature

against the informant and his family.

SIM DIVIS; BUGLUE BROWN

Inasmuch as the explosives cannot be returned, the

informant has petitioned that he and his farily be relocated

in some other part of the country out cE DiVIS' reach.

To

this end, informant is willing to leave his home and an

excellent

employment but does not ask for another job.

Informant has stated a personal preference for relocation

at Boise, Idaho, which he feels would be a safe location

as it is not a place to which he would be expected to go.

On July 27, 1971, Special Investigator STEVE

LOGAN, ATFD, San Diego, was contacted regarding the matter

of relocating the informant. LOGAN stated that he was not

in a position to make a determination on a question of that

nature but stated he did not believe that AFD would accept

such a responsibility unless the informant had served as

a witness in an ATED prosecution.

explaining to DAVIS why this informant could not produce the

explosives. After lengthy consideration, the informant

declined to accept this suggestion as a workable solution to

The informant is convinced that regardless of

reason given, when he advises DAVIS he no longer has

possession of the explosives, DAVIS's anger will cause him to

become irrational to the point that he would commit some act

or acts of violence against the informant or his family.

Informant continued to be of the opinion that due to the

fact

the explosives could

not be made available for return to DaVIS,

the only safe course of action for him and his family would

be relocation in an area where the informant and his family

would be out of DAVIS's reach.

On July 28, 1971, the Informant's parents tele-

phonically contacted the

San Diego Division of the FBI.

They

advised that based on their knowledge of JERRY LYNN DAVIS,

and other individuals with whom their son had been associating,

they felt his concern for the personal safety of both himsel

and his family was completely justified.

The parents advised

that they contemplated

moving to the

In addition, the parents indicated they were not

a job for the informant at the place of relocation comparable

to the $12,000 a year job he presently holds at San Diego.

The parents advised they had suggested to informant the

possibility of his relocation in Hawall, as they felt there

should be an abundance of employment opportunities with the

U.S. Government in that state and that the Federal Bureau of

Investigation should

be able to get one for their son without

too much difficulty.

During this conversation, the informant's father

advised he (the father) has friends in Washington, D.C., and

that if it appeared help might be necessary in obtaining

authorization for relocation and the securing of employment

for the informant, he would be glad to contact these people

for any assistance they might be able to render.

On July 29, 1971, the informant was

recontacted at

which time he stated

he had continued to give the matter of

relocation considerable thought.

He pointed out that his

parents have,

for some time, been trying to convince him of

the desirability of moving to the state of Hawaii. He explained

that his parents have resided and visited in that state several

times, and are contemplating moving there permanently in the

near

future for health and business reasons.

Informant

advised he personally continues to feel that relocation at

Boise, Idaho, would be more advantageous to him. He statec

he would appreciate assistance from'the Federal Bureau of

Investigation in finding employment there.

Informant further advised that the home in which

he lives at San Diego is being purchased through a Federal

Housing Administration (FHA) loan and has a current market

value of approximately $20,000.

estimate of

$1, 500. to $2,000, as

He said that this meant that while originally it would have

cost him only $400 to pay off his FHA loan, he is now faced

with the problem of paying $2,000 to do the same thing.

$3,000 to $3,500 to relocate at Boise, Idaho.

This is to'advise of information developed by 'captioned

Informant disclosing a shooting incident arising from activities

of the newly organized white extremist Secret Army Organization.

By memorandum dated 1/11/72, you were advised of the

formation and activities of the newly formed ultraconservative

white extremist paramilitary group known as Secret Army Organiza-

tion (SAO). SAO has targeted for harassment San Diego State

College Professor Peter Bohmer.

Bohmer's residence is a well-known

New left commune, whose occupants, along with Bohmer, are planning

demonstrations at the Republican National Convention scheduled at

¡San Diego for August, 1972.

Captioned informant, a 28-year-old white male operated

since August,

1967, has been recently targeted to penetrate the

extremist-oriented SAO. On January 6, 1972, informant was

requested by SAO leader to surveil Bohmer's

residence in order

obtain intelligence information. Accompanying informant on/

surveillance was SAO associate George M. Hoover. The surveillance,

held during the evening of January, 6, 1972, was discontinued after

the Bohmer residence appeared unoccupied.

However, prior to

discontinuance, an SAO sticker was left at the front door. While

passing in front of the house in informant's automobile, Hoover,

without warning and to the complete dismay of informant, fired

two shots into the house. The informant strongly protested and

they sped away. A female occupant of the house reportedly

sustained minor gunshot wound in her elbow.

Informant furnished details of the shooting, which

would not have been available through any other source, and

cautioned that Hoover is "fired up" over the incident and ready

for a violent confrontation should police approach him on this

matter. Identities of those involved in shooting not known to

San Diego police; however, witnesses did furnish description of

informant's automobile.

This informant, during his utilization, has furnished

exceptionally valuable information on the Minutemen and has been

completely reliable. He has been previously cautioned, as all

extremist informants are, not to become directly involved in

violent confrontations or activities. He is the only Bureau

source covering the violence-prone SAO. San Diego has advised

that pertinent information developed by informant will be

furnished to the San Diego Police Department but informant's

identity withheld unless disclosure bacomes necessary. There

appears to be no objection to this, and San Diego will be

instructed to closely follow this matter and promptly report

partinent developments.

its ties to revolutionary groups throughout

the world.

on 8/23/72, Mr. MILLER was interviewed concerning

Our motive for writing this. book is to alert the general

Godfrey wants to lay out the nation network of communication

between extremist groups, both right and left wing.

He plans to recount as much detail as possible of his years

as a member of these extremist groups, explaining the recruiting,

training, assignment and some actual operations accomplished by

them.

It would be of great assistance to us if you would authorize

me to interview Agent Peterson in San Diego. This would not constitute

an endorsement of our Book, but would help me io understand more

about Godfrey, the general situation, and the position of the F.B!l.

Brownfield to Jenkins Memo

RE: LAURITZ P. MILLER

of the San Diego Office August 10, 1967, while employed as

an equipment-checker for Pacific Telephone and Telegraph

Company, San Diego, California.

A gun hobbyist. Army trained

in the use of explosives, he became associated with the top

echelon of the Minutemen

as well as the Secret Army Organization

(SAO), furnishing excellent information to the FBI regarding

these

and other extremists groups.

By communication dated November 20, 1972, the

San Diego Office discontinued Godfrey as an informant. Godfrey

had testified in San Diego County Superior Court in the trial

of George Mitchell Hoover, SAO member charged with attempted

murder, and in the trial of William Francis Yakopec, who was

found guilty of the bombing of the Guild Theater in San Diego.

At that time, Godfrey also was scheduled to testify against

Jerry Lynn Davis, SAO leader charged with illegal possession

of explosives.

SA Petersen also testified in Hoover's trial and

had been Godfrey's contacting Agent.

As a result of Godfrey's appearances as a prosecution

witness, his identity as an FBI informant was publicized in the

news media. (137-17222, 157-17513-10)

Regarding Miller:

Our files show that by letter dated November 30,

1971, Miller requested information regarding crimes committed

by juvenile females.

He was furnished a Uniform Crime Reports

Bulletin.

Miller wrote to Acting Director Gray August 11,

1972, furnishing information regarding what he considered

to be a world-wide communist conspiracy for revolution,

including direct communication between U. S. revolutionaries

and the Japanese.

Miller stated that some American servicemen

were sympathetic with the world revolutionaries and were being

used as couriers. Miller explained he had developed this

information while doing research in Japan. He requested

information as to whether the FBI knew of

the "situation."

August 21, 1972, the Los Angeles Office

was advised of Miller's August llth letter and was instructed

to interview him.

The Los Angeles Office further was instructed

to advise Miller of the confidential nature of information contained

in Bureau files and to alert him regarding the jurisdictions of

the respective military services over their personnel.

•Brownfield to Jenkins Memo

RE: LAURIT? P. MILLER

Miller was subsequently advised by the Los Angeles

Office per instructions and the information he furnished was

forwarded to the Legal Attache, Tokyo.

Miller also furnished similar information directly

to the Japanese National Police Agency (NPA), in August, 1972.

The NPA in October, 1972, advised the Legal Attache, Tokyo,

that NPA's inquiry failed to substantiate Miller's allegations.

(62-115275)

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:

On March 6, 1973, ASAC Clark F. Brown, San Diego

Office, was telephonically advised of Miller's request to

interview SA Petersen in connection with the projected book.

ASAC Brown was

advised that interview of SA Petersen would not

be authorized in view of regulations regarding revealing

information in Bureau files.

This matter has been coordinated with the Intelligence

Division and James I. Williamson of the Office of Legal Counsel.

RECOMMENDATION:

That the attached reply be sent to Miller.

policical party hendquartered in Harietta, Georgie, which is

composed of past manbors of blan-type organizations. TI is

ediie by Dr. Edvard R. Fields who is NSRI National Secretary.

The lead article is captioned "FBI Turned Into Secret

Folice." It discusses a lengthy vricten report allegedly given by

former IBI Assistant to che Director Willian C, Sullivan to the

White fiouse, in which Sullivan "revealed" former Director lioovve

iras not of

sound nind in his last years"; how Disector Hoover

allegedly "kept files on Congressien and blacknailed

I them"; and

how the FI allegedly comnitted illegal acts in "prosecuting thise

pacrious" for many yoars.

The arcicle alleges that fomer

hite House aide John Dean III gave a copy of Sullivan's report

to the Sonate Watengate Committee (SWC) ; howeves, the SWC has

allogedly suppressed it. Honders are urged to volte their

Congressmen and the STiC demanding xelease of che "Sullivan Report,"

The article further alleges the FBI has been "wrecking

patriotic organizations" while only "giving lip service to the fight

against conmunisu," and has experienced a "loss of reputation."

Purpose of this memorandum is to advise that a San Diego

Division extremist informant furnished information resulting in

the solution of a bombing perpetrated by a member of the Secret

Arhy Organization (SAO), a white ultraconservative, paramilitary

group clandestinely formed in Arizona in 1971, and the confiscation

of explosives.

On 6/20/72, End advised that William Francis Yakopec,

a member of the SAO, El Cajon, California, said he personally,

without the knowledge of other SAO members, was responsible for the

6/19/72 bombing of the Guild, a movie

theater specializing in

pornographic films, 3827 Fifth Avenue, San Diego, and he identified

foux pornography-oriented establishments as potential future bombing

targets.

this information was turnished to the San Diego Police

Department (SDPD).

- On 6/25/72, Yakopec told the informant the location of

explosives he had concealed in a vacant lot behind his residence.

This information was also furnished to the SDPD and a search of the

lot resulted in the confiscation of one two-and-one-quarter-pound

block of C-4 military plastic explosives, two one-pound canisters

of primer charges, approximately 30 mechanical caps, andian unknown

quantity of safety

fuses.

BEC59' 157-15527-315° Heed

LA: 6426/72, based on information furnished by the source

and Yakopec's known involvement in SAO activity, the SDPD executed

search warrants at the home of Yakopec and SAD members George

Mitchell Hoover and Richard Fleury. The searches produced large

quantities of SAO and Minutemen literature dealing with explosives

, and the construction of mines and booby traps, 14 weapons, several

thousand rounds of ammunition, and approximately 50 pounds of

gunpowder.

Memorandum to Mr. E. S. Miller

Re:

Secret Army Organization

Yakopec and Hoover were arrested and charged with attempted

murder and improper storage of gunpowder in excess

of 20 pounds

without a license. Fleury and his wife, Genevieve, were arrested and

charged with improper storage of gunpowder in excess of 20 pounds.

All four subjects are currently incarcerated in the San Diego County

Jail.

The source has expressed willingness to testify in this

matter if necessary to secure prosecutive action. The SDPD has

stated should the source's testimony become necessary steps would be

taken by that Department to insure protection of the source and his

family and that they would be relocated and suitable employment

obtained for the source.

Inasmuch as the preliminary facts regarding the bombing of

the Guild Theater failed to indicate involvement of members of a

terrorist of revolutionary group, under existing guidelines the

incident was one within the primary jurisdiction of the Alcohol,

Tobacco and Firearms Division and that agency was immediately

advised.

Pertinent portions of this information will be furnished

to the Internal Security Division of the Department of Justice and

to Secret Service.

SECRET ARMY ORGANIZATION

on April 26, 1972, a confidential source, who has

provided reliable information on numerous occesions in the past,

advised no recent developments have been made in plans by Jerry

Lynn Davis and the Secret Army Organization (SAO) for disruptions

during the Republican National Convention (RNC).

The source

explained that due to the time interval until the advent of the

RNC, such plans had only reached e speculation or discussion stage.

Furthermore, actual plens and activities by the sAo would depend

greatly on the nature of conditions existing during the kid .e.s

number of New Left demonstrators, riots, police retallation, etc.

The Secret Army Organization (SAO) is a para-military

organization formed during the early part of

October, 1971, by former members and supporters

of the

Minutemen Organization, for the purpose

of replacing that organization, now considered

defunct.

With its headquarters located at San

Diego, California,

the SAo intends to work towards

becoming a nationwide organization.

Jerry Lynn

Davis, 2393 Weshington, Spring Valley, California,

is the leader of SAO in the San Diego area.

JERREL

The Minutemen Organization is a parp-military

group orgenized in June, 1960, by Rooert B.

Depugh in Norborne, Missouri,

as a resistance

to the spread of communism in the United States

by use of guerrilla tectios.

DePugh is currently

Incarcerated in a Federal penitentiary for violation

of the Federal Firearms Act.

The Patriotic Party

has been the political arm of the Minutemen.

The source had previously received information to the

effect that four cannons of a type similar to those used in the

Civil War might be available for use by davis and his associates.

on April 20, 1912, the source stated that two of these are

iront yerd of the Gunsmoke Ranch, 1509 Harbison

Canyon Road ih san Diego County area.

Alden Edward Willis, not a member of

the SAO,

however, he is

politically sympathetic and Iriendly with Davis.

source

is not sure how readily available these weepons might now be to

the SAO.

A third cannon, previously referred to es being under

construction, is now complete and 1s located in the backyerd of

SAO member Stanley Don MeDade, 3220 Sweetwater Road, Lemon Grove,

California.

SECRET ARMY ORGANIZATION

The source advised he was only told of the existence

of the fourth cannon and does not know its owner or location.

The source said he understands these weapons are legal under

both State and Federal law.

The source stated to his knowledge, Davis is not

presently manufacturing or selling firearms

or explosives In

violation of Federal or California law.

The source advised that

epproximately six months ago he observed Davis in possession

of a fully automatic AR 18 rifle in 223 callber which was

received earlier the seme day by Davis from one Richard Miller,

7186 Glenroy, San Diego.

Miller's source of the AR 18 is not

known but source said it is rumored that he has contact with cALlf,

a stockholder of the manufacturer,

Armalite Company, and has

also had AR 180 rifles (legal civilian version of the AR 18

rifle) for sale when no one

else could get them.

Davis showed the source that the safety lever on his

AR 18 hed the third position for fully automatic fire. The

source could not obtain the serial number.

On or about Merch 20, 1972, the source observed

Davis take delivery of a fully

automatic M-2 carbine in .30

caliber from Cy Anderson, 1948 Northeest 168 Place, Bothell,

washington, who is knowr

to source as

a trafficker

in firearms

and other items of questionable legality. The source observed

the fully automatic fire control lever on the weapon but was not

In a position to obtain its serial number.

The source advised

he is sure Davis still possesses

• the AR 18 rifle but Davis

•SECRET ARMY ORGANIZATION

epproximately the first of April, 1972.

On April 27, 1972, Special Agents of the FBI at

San Diego, using a suitable

pretext, observed two Civil War

style cannons on the premises of the Gunsmoke Ranch.

One

cannon, obviously nina mede or nome made, haa a barrel

approximately two feet in length with about a two inch bore

and was mounted on a smell four wheel carriage of an old Navy

style.

The second cannon appeared to be an original Civil War

piece with about a three foot barrel having about a three inch

bore.

A third cannon wes observed by these Special Agents

the same day in the backyard of the McDade residence by driving

up a driveway commonly shared by three houses. This gun had a

barrel of approximately four feet with close to a four inch bore

and was mounted on a home made two wheel carriage.

On April 28, 1972, Donald Grossmeyer, Special

Investigator, Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Department (ATFD),

San Diego, advised neither he nor his office had ony knowleage

regarding

Richard Miller or his aotivities. Grossmeyer stated

that the three cannons are legal under Federal law but thought

they might possibly have to be registered to be legal under

California law.

On May 26, 1972, Special Agent James Berrian, California

Bureau of Criminal Investigation and Identification, Sen Diego,

made available copies of records maintained by his Bureau,

pertaining to transactions involving sales of handguns by

Individusls using the name Jerry L. Davis or Jerry Lynn Davis.

In excess of twenty such transsctions were found which were

identifiable with Davis. In no two of these transactions wes

the second party to the sale the seme individual. Special Agent

Berrian pointed out that due to the dates involved, many of

these weapons would appear to have been resold by Davis.

On June 7, 1972, the first source advised that with

the RNC having been

changed to Miami, Floride, the activities

of the SAO had entered into a relatively quiet period and that

the organization would at least temporarily concentrate on

recruitment and propagandizing..

He stated he had not yet been

able to determine the location of any illegal explosives

weapons.

camoflage clothing.

When investigated by his department,

it was determined that at that time ANDERSON was

involved

in what was referred to as "simulated maneuvers" in the

woods. around the Bothell, Washington area which PLANCICH

described as being heavily populated by farms and related

businesses.

Also during the summer of 1969, a Bothell

Police Officer observed ANDERSON in the company of several

other white males who were once again conducting some sort

of maneuvers.

At this time the officer observed a shotgun

in one of the vehicles, which when measured was just 1/2 inch

over the legal limit.

During the early fall of 1969,

ANDERSON approached an officer of the Bothell Police

Department

with a weapon to determine if it was legal and under the

current interpretations of both Federal and state law, it

was opined that the weapon ANDERSON had was legal, but no

record was maintained as to the type of weapon.

PLANCICH stated that ANDERSON, in the past, has

purchased old Bothell Police Department vehides and it was

PLANCICH's opinion that ANDERSON did this to satisfy some

unknown egomania that he felt ANDERSON had.

PLANCICH

stated that he knew of no violent acts committed by ANDERSON

at any time.

PLANCICH stated that the only close friends and

SECRET ARMY ORGANIZATION

PX T-I advised on April 26, 1972, that during

his contact with members of the Secret Army Organization

(NAU) In Lebruary, Lyla, sam DaViS, also known as Jerry

Davis, and one Cy

Anderson, posed the question to an sAu

group

as. to what measures could be taken by the SAo to

counter disruptions by revolutionary groups at the

Republican National Convention.

This question was never

discussed at great length, but

in this connection, one

member suggested that old junk-type cars be parked at

strategic

in the event of confrontation

with dissident elements,

locations where the SAO members could have access

to the necessary weapons hidden in the cars.

Since the

time of

the above discussion, however, SAO leadership

appears to have had second thoughts on the matter because

the latter have been heard to say that they are going

to stay out of San Diego entirely during the Republican

National Convention in order to preclude any untoward

incident that could be attributed to the presence of

the SAO and redound to the discredit of the sAo.

Informant advised that he has not been present

when sources of weapons may have been discussed by the

but states that he is aware of the tact that Leaders

of the SAO have attended gun shows at every opportunity,

notably at luma, Arizona, on October 15, 16, 1971, and

again at Yuma on February 25, 26, 1972, and

at Phoenix,

Arizona, on March 25, 26, 1972.

Source advises that the Secret Army Organization

is a new paramilitary group that has been

formed in California to replace the Minutemen:

organization.

It is composed of ex-Minutemen

under the direction of Jerry Davis of the

San Diego area.

exemplify the necessity of such an organization, we quote

the 1960 Annual Reportof the Committee on Un-American

Activities as follow's:

evidence that the American people cannot rely completely

on this country's armed

from communist domination and slavery.

. because our military forces lack the power or the will to

defend this country, but rather because the nature of the

attacks being made on the United States by its major and

only signiücant enemy are so designed as to render con-

defense purposes."

Starting..from

rothing

50 years ago, commuaism.

now rigidly controls one-third of the human race and has

subverted to varying degrees the remaining two-thirds.

In the past 20 years the communists have conquered 20

sovereign nations, one by armed conquest and 19 by in-

ternal subversion or negotiation.

There is not one of these countries in which the

comminists rule by the consent of the people. Every-

where they must perpetuate themselves by terror.

police state tactics.

The communists consider their party workers

not simply as an accessory to armed conquest but as the

actual spearhead

ot any invasion into new territory.

From this point of view the United States was "invaded"

by Soviet troops more than 30 years ago.

It has been

authoritatively estimated that the communists now have

an army of 500, 000 combatants already landed on Ameri-

can shores and alroady working by the most insidious

means to destroy our American way of life.

The cold war is very real. It must be fought and

won.

The only alternative is to lose and to lose means

that future Americans for generations to come must live

in terror and in slavery.

Appeasement is futile.

cannot bargain with moral barbarians who never have and

never will know the meaning of honesty.

Communism must be defeated, not merely resist-

ed. We must rid our country of traitors and fellow trave-

lers. We must embark on a massive offensive turning

every communist trick - from propaganda to infiltration-

against our mortal enemy. This is the one and only way

to win the struggle for survival.

WANTED

FOr TREASON

NIXON

DESCRIPTION

FULL NAME: Richard Milhous Nixon. DATE OF BIRTH: January 9,1913 at Yorba Linda,

California. FORMER OCCUPATIONS: Used car salesman, law clerk,

second rate congress-.

man, and mediocre Vice President. PRESENT OCCUPATION: Professional liar and double

crosser (part time employment as United States President). WEIGHT: 170 pounds. EYES:

brown.

HAIR: black. HEIGHT: 5'11". RACE: White. NATIONALITY: Claims American

citizenship but actions prove this unlikely. LAST KNOWN ADDRESS: 1600 Pennsylvania

Avenue, Washington, D.C. (Rumored to have a California hideout.)

CRIMINAL RECORD

RICHARD NIXON (alias Cry-Baby Nixon, alieas Tricky Dicky) is an expert in disguises and

has successfully passed himself off as an anti-communist in the past. He may again try using

this disguise if pressed for votes in 1972. Saying one thing, then doing the opposite is Nixon's

MOA. While he campaigned in 1968 on a platform of curtailing socialism he has in fact done

more to establish a socialistic dictatorship than either of the last two Democrat administra-

tions. His economic policies have continued to enrich Big Industrialists while rising prices

and higher taxes have all but reduced the average worker to a state of financial slavery. This

criminal has even made vicious attacks on small children (forced busing to acheive "racial

balance") and has caused the destruction of local school systems.

WARNING: Nixon suffers

from an EMPEROR COMPLEX and becomes exiremeiy dangerous wien criticized.

CAUTION

Trickery and deceit are Nixon's trade-marks. At the present time Nixon and his chief hench-

man HENRY (CZAR) KISSINGER are engaged in forming an alliance with another gang of

criminals, the Red Chinese. The RED CHINA GANG have slaughtered an estimated fifty

million of their own people since coming to power. This Godless horde of barbarians killed

thousands of Americans in the Korean War (shooting caplured soldiers and starving and tor-

turing prisoners of war). The RED CHINA GANG have been supplying the NORTH VIETNA I-

ESE BANDITS with weapons and bullets to kill American soldiers in another no-win war in

Vietnam. The very fact that Nixon is dealing with these ARCH ENEMIES OF FREEDOM is

enough to convict him of treason. DO NOT LET THIS CRMINAL STEAL YOUR FREEDOM.

DEMAND HIS ARREST BY PROPER AUTHORITIES AND HIS TRIAL FOR THE CRIME OF

HIGH TREASON.

We note from your letterhead memorandum dated

March 8, 1972 from Phoenix, Arizona, that Jerry Lynn Davis

and other members of the Secret Army Organization met in

Yuma, Arizona, and discussed preparations for the forth-

coming Republican National Convention in San Diego, California.

It is also noted from the report of SA Steven L. Christensen

dated March 8, 1972 in San

Diego, California, that Davis

viewed the convention as "his big chance to do something that

would be remembered;" and further that he had planned a

sophisticated alibi to cover any bombings or other terrorist

activities that he may engage in during the convention.

In this connection, it is requested that we be

advised as expeditiously as possible of any further develop-

ments in Davis' plans for the convention including his

acquisition of any weapons or explosives.

The report of SA Christensen also contains

additional information from sources SD T-2 and SD T-3 pointing

out that Davis said that he had ready access to illegal weapons

and explosive materials. This report further advised that

Davis had purchased $500 worth of M-2 Carbine parts in May,

1971 for the purpose of making M-2 "enforcers," that Davis

in

September; 1971 had a cache of several hundred pounds of

explosives including INI, C-4, and rifle grenades and further

that his group was in possession of three operational Civil

War field artillery pieces with a fourth under construction.

no recent developments in the plans of Davis and the SAO and thet

due to the time interval until the Republican National Convention

plans had only reached the speculation os discussion stage, This

and explosive materials. It was requested these sources be reinter

viewed to determine if Davis is presently manufaccuring, selling

or in possession of any illegal weapons, explosives, or explosive

devices. Ic was further requested that the caliber and present

location of four Civil War arcillery pleces, one which was under

construction, be determined.

Our Sen Diego Office utilized SD T-Z and SD I-3 in the

above report to further conceal the identity of one informant.

This Informant tras recontacted on April 26, 1972, and stated Davis

is not presently known to be manufacturing or selling firearms or

explosives in violation of Federal or California laws. Infomant

claims approxinately six months ago Davis was observed in possession

of a fully automatic AR-18 rifle, "223 caliber, which was seceived

that same day from Richard Miller, 7186 Glenroy, San Diego.

Davis advised informant this weapon was altered

to fire seni

automatic only.. Its present location is not know.

On or about larch 20, 1972, Che intorant observed Davis

receive a FuLly automacie li-2 Carbine, •30 caliber, from ay Anderson,

10418 Northeast 168th Place, Bothell, Washington.

The source

observed the fully automatic fire control lever on this weapen

and claims Davis assured him this rifle was also altered to fire

semi-auconetic only. This carbine is maintained in Davis' bedroon

at his residence, 2393 Washington Street, Spring Valley, California.

On September 29, 1971, the informant observed Davis in

possession of two blocks of C-4 plastic explosive, veighing ino

and one-fourth pounds each; about four pounds of INT in one-half-

and one-pound blocks; and about two pounds of MPD primers in

one-third-pound blocks. Informant claims these items were last

seen approximately April 1, 1972, at the residence of SAO member

George Mitchell Hoover, 8721 Magnolia, Santee, California.

On April 26, 1972, the informant furnished the location

of three Civil Was type cannons and

stated he had been told about

the fourth one but did not know its locacion.

On April 27, 1972,

Special Agents of the I'BI observed cro Civil War style cannons on

the premises of the Gunsmoke Ranch, 1509 Harbison Canyon load,

san Diego county, Califomnia.

One cannon, obviously homemade, had

a barrel approximately two feet in length, with about a two-inch

bore, and was maintained on a snall, old Navy style four-wheel

carriage. The second cannon appeared to be an original Civil War

cannen with about a three-foot barrel and having about a three-

inch bore.

This ranch is oned by Alden Edward Willis, who is not

& member of the SAO but is politically sympathetic and friendly

with Davis. A third cannon was observed by Special Agents in the

back yard of SA0 member Stanley Don McDade, 3220 Sweetwater load,

Lemon Grove, Califernia. This cannon had a barrel approximately

four feet in length with about a four-inch bore and was mounted

011 & homemade two-wheel carriage.

The informant stated he understands these cannons are

legal under both state and Federal law.

Cn April 28, 1972, Donald Grossmeyer, Special Investigator,

Alechol, Tobacco and Firearms Division, Department of the Treasury,

San Diego, California, advised his office had no knowledge regarding

the previously mentioned Richard Miller.

Nc. Grossmeyer stated

that the above three cannons are legal under Federal law buc thought

they might possibly have to be registered to be legal under

California law.

• The informant, who has furnished information regarding

weapons and explosives and activities of the SAO, has stated on

several occasions he will not testify against Davis and other SAO

members and associates for fear of his life.

Where cases are shown to be closed, previous investi

necessary criteria for inclusion on the ADEX.

Source advised that based on statements made by JERRY

LINN DAVIS, Leader of the sAo at san Diego, he believes DaVIS

may have several other individual members of the sAo in the

San Diego area who are not known to source.

Source explained

that each person holding an official or leadership position in

the SAO is encouraged

to recruit members on his own who

generally would not have become known to other people in the

organization.

In this regard he advised DAVIS recently claimed

that a new SAO member was recruited through EDWARD ANDREWS.

This individual was described to source,

and was a retired

military man, who recently completed training in insurance

investment and is to begin work soon with a large insurance

company in the San Diego area.

Los Angeles, California, Area

Source advised that according to DAVIS, one SAM

NAPIER has recently joined the SAO and is allegedly assisting

DAVIS in his attempts to organize the SAO in the Los Angeles,

California, area.

Source said that according to DAVIS,

NAPIEE

was

formerly associated in the Los Angeles area with

the National Socialist American Workers Party (NSAWP) under

Scott wiNchesteR, but left that group. DAVIs claimed NAfteR

has allegedly recruited

another SAO member whose name is not

known to the source. Furthermore, DAVIS claims to have three

additional SAO members in the Los Angeles area, one who resides

at Carson, California, and another who is supposed to move to

the State of Oregon in the near future. The identities of

these three individuals are not known to the source.

Seattle, Washington, Area

Source advised that according to DAVIS, CY ANDERSON

and another individual named (FNU) BAGWELL are allegedly

members of the SAO in that city.

DAVIS claims

ANDERSON

has recruited additional members for the organization there.

Phoenix, Arizona, Area

Source advised that an individual named EVERETT

MOORE at Phoenix

members is supposed to be located at Phoenix under the

direction of MOORE. Source said DAVIS has indicated that

SAO recruiting literature which is distributed in Arizona

its own separate Post Office Box number in the San Diego

area, this number not being known to the source.

Mail received

at this post office box is picked up by DAVIS and sent, sealed

to MOORE for his use.

In addition

DAVIS claims that the individual who

was formerly leader of the Bishop Faction of the Americar

Nazi Party at Phoenix, Arizona,

and one of his associates.

have joined the SAO and sent a full year's dues at one time.

This

first individual was also alleged to be State Director

for the State of Arizona for SCOTT WINCHESTER's group, the

NSAWE O

According to DAVIS, these individuals left the NSAWP

in order to join the SAO.

Las Vegas, Nevada, Area

Source advised he is not exacily sure what is happen-

ing with regard to the SAO at Las Vegas, and added DAVIS has

indicated he thinks he will have to make another trip to Las

Vegas in order to get things going well there for the SAO.

Source advised that the SAO appears to have been

receiving a considerable quantity of mail from several places

in the United states,

but primarily from the Western states.

le said most membership fees and dues have been sent by money

order

and that DAVIS has

a business establishment located in

El Cajon, California, which will allow him to cash these money

orders signing any name to them he wishes.

Source said that as a rough estimate he would guess

that approximately 40 membership applications have been

received so far by the SAO. He said he felt the identities

of many of these may never

come to his attention.

LEADS

All receiving orIices are requested to alert appropriate

informants and sources of information to the SAO to identify

actual and potential members of this organization.

Thereafter,

individuals identified should be promptly and thoroughly

investigated to determine their potential for violence and

disruptive activities during the Republican National Convention.

include statement whether sufficient informant coverage of SAO is

available, and if not, what corrective steps are being taken.

San Diego reopen Investigations of those members named in

referenced airtel which have been closed in order that cheir

activities can be followed.

In view of the efforts to recruit new members, San Diego

and recipient offices should take advantage of this opportunity to

increase informant coverage so that a more complete analysis of

this group can be made. San Diego, particularly, should expand its

informant coverage so that all SAO members can be identified and

advance plans for violence can be determined.

NOTE:

The SAO is an ultraconservative, paramilitary organization

clandestinely formed during the Fall of 1971 in Arizona. The organi-

zation, which is headquartered in the San Diego territory, has

confined its organizational efforts to the Rocky Mountain states.

Estimated membership is approximately 40. Several former Minutemen

are members and they use much of the same training material as the

Minutemen.

Immediate', investigation is necessary to identify members

and plans of this group as Jerry Lynn Davis, SAO leader and organi-

zer, plans disruptive action at Republican National Convention.

You should be alert during these investigations to possible

Submit by airtel names of all individuals identified as

On March 7, 1972, Confidential Source Px I-1, who

has furnished reliable information in the past, advised

that five members of the Secret Army Organization (SAO) met

a second time at the fairgrounds at Yuma, Arizona on February

25 and 26, 1972, incidental to the gun show which was in

progress there, as sponsored by KIWANIN.

Those who met

together were Jerry. savis, also known as Sam, Davis; Barry

Godfrey, also known

Gulette and one other unward codtrey; Star McDade; Bill

person.

California vehicles

bearing license plates 99704-F and VES-494 were noted as belonging

to this group.

At the meeting, Davis discussed the Republican

National Convention which will be held in San Diego this

year and which could be beset with problems from dissident

groups with intent to disrupt the convention.

In this

connection, Davis spoke in terms of having an SAO training

session some time before the convention for the purpose of

preparing to control and counter dissident elements in the

event the latter should get out of hand.

Source advised that the SAO is confining its recruiting

efforts to the Rocky Mountain states, but that the group has

established contact with former Minutemen in Michigan and

Maryland.

Source, who is familiar with the political philosophy

of the Minutemen, advised that the training material being used

by the SAO is Minutemen material with an SAO caption to it;

that, however; the political philosophy of the SAO is somewhal

nebulous and in the formative stage.

CONFIDENTIAL

SECRET ARMY ORGANIZATION

On January 31, 1972, a confidential source who

has furnished reliable information in the past, made "under-

ground bulletin" material available concerning captioned

organization. This material bears the date,

"January 1972."

The material has been photocopied and is made a part of this

memorandum

The source advises that the leader of the above

organization is one Jerry Davis from San Diego, California,

who attended a gun show at Yuma, Arizona on October 15 through

October 17, 1971.

Invéstigation at Yuma, Arizona develops

that one Jerry Davis occupied Room #12 of the Thunderbird

votel in luna, Arizona, starting from October 15, 1971 to

October 17, 1971. At that time, he recorded that he was

driving a Ford vehicle bearing California license QNB-857

and that his residence was at 2393 Washington, Lemon. Grove,

California.

Source advises that the Secret Army Organiza-

tion is a new paramilitary group that has been

formed in California to replace the Minutemen

organization. It is composed of ex-Minutemen

under the direction of Jerry Davis of the San

Diego area.

The Minutemen Is a paramilitant group organized

in June, 1960, by Robert B. Depugh in Norborne,

Missouri, as a resistance to the spread of

communism in the United States by use of guerrilla

tactics.

DePugh is currently incarcerated in

a Federal penitentiary for violation of the Federal

Firearms Act.

UNDERGROUND BULLETIN

GENERAL HEADQUARTERS

JANUARY 1972

"God grants liberty only to those who love it and are always willing to guard and

defend it"'.

Daniel Webster

Fellow members,

This month's bulletin will deal mostly with "Booby Traps". Because of the

Length of this article we are only sending out the first half this month. The second

half will be published in next month's bulletin. Future bulletins this coming year

will contain material on psychological warfare, urban warfare tactics, communi-

cations, survival-equipment, first aid, explosives, weapons, codes, and other r

lated warfare subjects.

Those members who have not yet completed or started on the organization's

basic training programs are hereby urged to do so. We cannot, in most cases,

assign any member to an important underground project or to an organized team

or group until they have completed this training program.

While headquarters canuot assign a member in the above classification to

an established unit, any member can (and is encouraged to) recruit and form their

own combat team (see December 1971 Bulletin). In many cases this may be the

best policy in regards to personal security as the member would be working with

the people he personally knows and trusts.

It any member would like to form their

own unit they should write to their assigned mail drop and the organization will send

them further instructions along with a Team Recruiting Packet. The article on

"The Dispersed Team" in this month's bulletin should help those members who

wish to form their own Combat Team.

We are enclosing a small number of S. A. O. stickers with this month's

bulletin. Please put them in your shirt pocket or billfold and as soon as possible

stick them up in phone booths, at bus stops, or other public places that you visit.

The stickers are alrcady gummed and when wet will adhere firmly to glass, metal,

or any other smooth surface. If our members would use these stickers along with

the leaflets that are available, it would have a real psychological impact on the

rest of the American people and give them evidence that there are still those among

them who are willing to fight for the re-establishment of a Constitutional Republic.

These first stickers are being sent to each member frce, additional stickers and

leaflets can be ordered on the monthly report form.

HE

DISPERSED TEAM

Gon

When discussing a Secret Army Organization "Combat Team", we usually think

of a small group of people who live very close to one another. Such an arrangement

has certain advantages, such as ease of communication and travel for collective

training and team operations, but there are also several disadvantages.

Among the disadvantages are these: Team members may be well acquainted

with only a small geographical area. If forced to leave this area the team may be

placed at a serious disadvantage. It is harder for a team of SAO members who

live closely together to keep from attracting attention, thus unit security may be

poor. If one ember of the team is ever discovered and arrested by the enemy,

chances are that all members of the team will be rounded up together.

These considerations have caused us to experiment with a new arrangement that

we refer to as a "Dispersed Team". Such a team has the same number of members

(usually six) as a regular Combat Team. Each team is split into two sections as is

the old team. The members have the same type of individual specialties and duties.

The big difference lies in the fact that the team members may be located over

..a comparatively larger area - perhaps as much as 25 to 50 miles in diameter. In

urban areas one team member may live in each of six different cities. Thus the

team may range over a fairly large geographical area with at least one team member

being familiar with the immediate territory through which they are traveling.

When active as part of an underground movement (as opposed to the classical

forms of guerrilla warfare) the Dispersed Team has several other advantages.

For example, if one member of the team gets too "hot" in his area, he automatically

has five other hide-outs to which he can go for assistance or to which he can send

his family for temporary safety. The Dispersed Team can conveniently cover a

larger area in the fields of recruiting, psychological warfare, and propaganda.

Operations of sabotage, surveillance and harassment of communist personnel,

raids, and other combat type operations can be successfully conducted while moving

a minimum of people over a minimum distance.

During the present period of deliberate delay the activities of the team will

• naturally be different from some future period in which all out warfare between our

organization and our country's communist enemies develops.

If the team is to achieve its ultimate objectives the following activities must

be provided for: (1) organization of and within the team, (2) communications between

the team and higher command, (3) maintaining secrecy of team members, (4) main-

taining a continuous and effective propaganda effort, (5) obtaining the necessary sup-

plies and equipment for present and future needs, (G) training of the team in general,

and of individual members in their own specialties.

When the required personnel are not available to form a full team, a three

man section should be formed. When additional people are recruited the unit can

then be expanded in an orderly fashion.

BOOBY TRAPS

Broadly defined a booby trap can be any kind of apparatus

&n which a reaction unfavorable to the enemy is brought about

when he unintentionally makes some act which triggers the re-

action. The most common types of booby traps used in warfare

involve an explosive charge which is set off by movement of a

trip wice or the moving of some object which is connected to

the trigger mechanism.

On occasion the explosive charga may be replaced by

signal flares, gas, smoke or other chemical agents.

The trigger

méchanism may be either electrto, mechanical, thermal or chemical.

ELECIRICALLY OPERATED TRIGGERS. Such trigger mechanisms

are very easily arranged wherever a supply of electric blasting

caps are available and also a suitable source of electricity.

One of the most common electric type booby traps is to simply

Interrupt the electrical circuit in some building so that when

the lights are turned on the explosive is detonated. This

simple procedure applied to an automobile with a few sticka of

dynamite has marked the end of more than one gangland hoodlum.

To booby trap a car in this manner one side of the electric

blasting cap can be attached to any metal part of the car while

the other side is attached to a spark plug or the "cold side"

of the ignition switch.

In the first case the cap detonates the

dynamite when the starter-motor is turned over or if attached to

the key switch detonating occurs when the ignition is turned on.

Any novable object can be booby trapped so that when it

18 moved some simple type electrical switch contact is closed

•to complete a circuit between a dry cell battery and the de-

tonator. A very simple example would be to have one wire tacked

along the edge of a door and the other wire tacked to the frame

and extending out far enough that contact is made between the

two when the door is opened, A slightly more refined trigger

Involves two small springs separated by some thin plece of in-

sulation at one end as shown in Figure No. l. When pressure

Is applied, the springs are held apart and when the pressure

Is released, the springs come together to make electrical con-

tact. This may be placed in a door which is then closed to open

the switch while the explosive is wired into the circuit.

When

the door is opened pressure is released and the charge explodes.

This simple trigger can be placed under the leg of a chair,

& wooden box or any other movable object of sufficient weight.

It the chair is moved or the box lifted the release of pressure

• will close the electrical circuit.

A person skilled in the placement of booby traps will not

leave any part of the switch, wires or charge visible. Instead of

NW 68262 Docld:32989523 Page 1319

## Page 1320

connecting the wires to the door itself he will take off the door

frame, place the trigger mechanism at the edge of the door and

then replace the frame so that the entire mechanism is hidden when

the door 1s closed.

• By taking off the frame of a window and drilling a hole

sout through the window casing the trigger mechanism can' be placed

zo, that the charge will be detonated by either raising or lowering

half open window.

A simple time delay mechanism can be arranged by placing

sonic of these triggers under a glass jar filled with water. When

enough

"öf the water evaporates, the weight of the jar will no

longer be sufficient to hold the contacts open.

Figure No. 2 shows another simple electrical trigger made

from a spring clothes pin. The improvised contacts are held

apart by a small wooden wedge in the jaws of the clothes pin.

This wedge can be attached to a trip wire or other movable object.

• When it is withdrawn the clothes pin

shuts and the electric cir-

cuit is completed.

A trigger of this type can be used to make a time delay

10÷27

mechanisn

in many different ways. The wedge may be connected by

a loose cord to the end of a spring which is also attached to a

tin can. Above this a second tin can fuli of sand or water is

placed with a hole in the bottom so that the contents gradually.

" fall through into the second can. When the weight of the lower

can becomes enough to stretch the spring sufficiently the wedge

will be pulled from the clothes pin. As an alternate method the

spring may be already stretched out and held there by a second

cord attached to some other solid object.

The cord holding the

spring. could be placed through a candle so that it will be burned

in two when the candle burned down a certain distance.

An active

imagination can devise countless ways for activating this type

of trigger either by instant action or delayed action.

A clever derivative of this simple trigger is used in the

"British book trap"

• In this case a book is hollowed out to

contain a small battery and a quarter pound block of TNT which

Is detonated by an electrical blasting cap. The circuit passes

through two contacts attached

to opposite pages of the book but

are held apart by some insulating material which is attached to

the back of the bookcase. If the book is withdrawn from the case

the contacts come together and the INT is detonated]

A British ball bearing contact switch is shown in Figure No.

• 3. This type of contact is very useful in placing charges entirely

within a movable object.

For example, a suitcase could be laid

on its side with the contact positioned inside in such a way that

when the suitcase was picked up the ball bearing would roll forward

• and complete the contact. Similar electrically activated booby

traps could be pl

aved in closed gasoline cans, canteens,

ammuni

tion boxes or dozens of other objects which an enemy would place

right side up before opening. A plastic or glass test tube

could be used instcad of a metal case by sticking two wires through

the cork in such a manner that the ball bearing would come in

contact with both of them.

A surprisingly accurate timing device can be made with a

tube of this type.

Holding the tube with the open end up, first

pour in a quantity of dried peas, then a measured amount of

water, drop in the ball bearing (in this case a wad of tin foil

could be used as well), finally put the cork in the top with the

wire sticking down through.

The water will cause the dried peas

to swell which will push the ball bearing (or wad of tin foil)

up until it makes contact with the two wires to complete the

circuit. The time can be regulated from a few minutes to several

hours depending on the length of the tube, the amount of water, and

the quantity of peas used.

Far more sophisticated types of electrical triggers are manu-

factured some of which operate by photoelectric cell or even more

difficult to recognize mechanisms. These may be used to.safeguard

record centers, important military or missile bases, etc. but are

seldom encountered under battlefield conditions.

MECHANICAL TRIGGERS. These may be operated either by impact

or by friction. The ordinary hand grenade employs an impact

trigger.

When the handle is released a spring operated lever snaps

against a cap (similar to the priming cap in a shotgun shell)

-which in turn starts a short fuse to burn. This fuse leads to a

blasting cap centered in an explosive charge.

The trigger mechanism of a "potato masher" hand grenade

operates much like the firing pin of a bolt action rifle. In

this case a spring activated plunger strikes a detonator.

The

plunger may be released by pulling out a pin as shown in Figure

No. 4, by cutting a wire as shown in Figure No. 5 or by applying.

pressure to a slotted key as shown in Figure No. 6.

Explosion of the primer cap alone is not sufficient to de-

tonate most military explosives.

Generally a booster charge of a

fairly sensitive explosive is detonated by the primer and this in

turn detonates the main charge.

In military use TNI is by far the

most common explosive used in the main charge of booby traps.

So called "plastic explosive" or "Composition C-3" contains

78

percent RDX and 22% plasticizer made up of mixture of dinitrotolune,

TNT, nitrocellulose and dimethylformamide. RDX is cyclotrimethy-

lenetrinitramine which is manufactured by nitrating hexamethylene-

tetramine (which is obtained by the rcaction of formaldehyde and

ammonia).

.

Booster charges where necessary are usually tetryl or PETN.

Common explosives used in primers are lead azide, lead styphnate

or the now largely discontinued mercury fulminate.

Characteris-

tics, uses and manufacture of explosives will be dealt with in

another chapter.

A very simple device can be made from a screen door spring

that will explode an ordinary rifle cartridge when activated by a

trip wire. Although the "explosion" is almost harmless it can be

very nerve racking to an approaching enemy.

A more deadly booby trap consists of a short piece of pipe

which is driven into the ground. A plunger type trigger mechanism

is dropped into the pipe and an ordinary rifle cartridge placed

point up in the pipe so that perhaps one-half inch is exposed

above the ground. The weight of a man stepping on the bullet

releases the trigger and fires the cartridge which will penetrate

well up into the leg or the body;

Some mechanical triggers are activated by friction just

like striking a match on the rough material of the match cover.

Figure No, I shows a cut-away drawing of the U.S. Army firing

device, pull friction type M-2. The coated wire is covered with

a gritty substance much like the strip on a book of matches.

When this is pulled out through a container of flash compound

(chemically similar to the match heads) the friction ignites the

flash compound which may be used either to light a fuse or fire

a blasting cap.

.. ..

-.---...

A crude but effective friction device can be prepared by

sticking the end of a fuse in some small cylinder filled with

match heads through which is placed a small strip of tin or heavy

cardboard with a friction strip from match books glued to both

• sides.

In field use the friction type ignitor can be hidden in

many ways connected with trip wires or attached to movable objects

to set off either instant or delayed charges.

THERMAL, IGNITORS. In some cases the ignitor, (fuse or primer)

can be used as a trigger mechanism.

For example in World War II

the Germans were known to tear down fireplaces and cement them •

back together with hidden charges that would ignite when a fire •

was built. A simple hand grenade or

mortar shell hidden in a

hollow log by a burned out fire would, of course, explode if the

log were used as fuel without being inspected.

A common trick is for a retreating army to leave behind coal

oil lamps or lanterns filled with

gasoline. An unthinking person

who touches a match to such a lantern will nearly always be burned

to death.

CHEMICAL TRIGGERS. These are more frequently used in the

construction of time bombs than in booby traps.

shows an Italian chemical delay Igniter. The upper chamber

contains acetone. When the piercing pin is pushed downward it

penetrates the lead disc and allows the acetone to flow into the

lower chamber.

The acetone gradually dissolves the celluloid

washer which holds back the striker. The time delay can be varied

by placing different numbers of cellophane washers on the striker

rod.

In several similar types of delayed mechanisms the striker

is held back by a thin metal wire which is gradually dissolved

when a solution of acid is allowed to surround it.

Other types of delay mechanisms may be constructed where a

liquid is allowed to drop through a small' hole into a lower con-

tainer having a reactive substance attached part way up one wall.

The liquid level in the chamber gradually raises until it comes

in contact with the reactive substance which is the igniter.

One

suitable combination is sulfuric acid for the liquid and a mixture

of potassium chlorate and sugar for the solid. Another suitable

combination is plain water for the liquid and metallic sodium for

the solid.

There are many other combinations which

a chemist might

improvise from materials at hand.

There are some explosives so sensitive that they can be used

as trigger mechanisms. Ammonium tri-iodide can be made from

ordinary household ammonia and iodine crystals. If the iodine

crystals are not available they can be obtained by evaporating

sufficient volume of tincture of iodine in a flat glass dish.

Place two or three teaspoons of iodine crystals in a piece

of kleenex and wet thoroughly with strong ammonia solution. A

small amount of ammonia may be added from time to time making

certain that it does not have the chance to dry out. After three

or four tablespoons of ammonia solution have been absorbed and

partly evaporated from the iodine it can be left to dry out.

While

wet ammonium tri-iodide is reasonably safe to handle. When dry,

it is so sensitive that it detonates at the slightest touch. It

may be exploded by a person walking on a wooden floor several feet

away or a door being closed in the same building. The amount

described above will produce a violent explosion and should be

treated with extreme caution.

Several similar compounds will be

mentioned in the chapter on explosives.

One or two teaspoonsful of mercury fulminate of silver

fulminate mixed (very gently) with ten percent coatse sand can

be placed in a small packet of paper and attached to the upper

side of an automobile tire with adhesive tape.

When the tire rolls

over it the fulminate will explode with sufficient power to destroy

even a husky truck tire. These combinations also are very danger-

ous to handle.

ONETOWN

READY MADE BOOBY TRAPS

All national armies are supplied with a variety of

manufactured trigger devices, charges, etc. to be used

specifically as booby trap material.

Most firing devices

are threaded on onc end with a standing size that allows them to

be used either with prepared charges or with improvised charges

made from mortar or artillery shells.

Figure No. 9 shows a

simple firing device attached

to a hand grenade.

An antipersonnel mine of French manufacture is shown in

Figure No. 10. The apparatus at the left side is a trigger

mechanism that can be operated by a trip wire.

When it is fired

the flash

passes through the "j" tube which propels a 60mm

grenade into the air and at the same time ignites a 1/5 second

delay pellet. The grenade explodes a few feet off the ground

to shower metal fragments over a wide area. Total weight of

mine is 5-1/2 pounds.

Guerrilla bands have sometimes used artillery shells or

mortar shells in demolition work by placing them in a large

pile of wood or other combustible material and building a bond

fire around them until they exploded. For booby traps use, however,

the projectile of an artillery shell is the only part of any

Useful sizes include 75mm, 90mm, 105mm, and 155mm.

In

those artillery shells where the prjectile is attached to the case,

it is generally best to remove the projectile and discard the case.

Artillery shell projectiles may be fused either in the nose or

in the base.

For most efficient use, the regular fuse must be

unscrewed

and a standard firing device (Ml0 Universal destructor)

put in its place.

IMPROVISED BOOBY TRAPS

Standard hand grenades can be used alone in booby traps

• In a number of methods. •The simplest is to carefully remove

the handle and wedge the grenade between two heavy objects

strong enough to hold the spring in the cocked position.

Another trick is to cover a hand grenade with wet mud with

just the safety pin ring sticking out. After the mud has hardened,

it will hold the handle in place and the safety pin ring can be

withdrawn. These harmless looking clumps of mud scattered along.

a dirt road will, of course, break open when hit by an automabile

tire which will relcase the handle and fize the grenade. A similar

trick is to place grenades in glass jars tight enough to hold the.....

handle in place when the safety pins are withdrawn.

At night these i

may be strung on a wire across a road and may not be seen by a

car traveling at night with its lights off.

When the bottles

break the grenade handles are released and they soon explode.

BONTIDENITKE

"It seems doubtful that man's ingenuity will

ever be

exhausted when it comes to improvising traps of various types.

A rusty nail stuck to a board left where it will be stepped

on by a running enemy may be just as deadly to that one indivi-

dual as an atomic bomb.

Open pits (sometimes with-sharp stakes

ai the bottom; covered with flimsy camouflage is much older than

the bow and arrow, but were still used by the Japanese' in World

Har II.

"Dead falls" made from heavy tree limbs that fall when a

victim releases them by tripping over a jungle vine can still

be useful in guerrilla wartare.

Leaving behind poisoned food or bottled drinks is common.

Alcoholic drinks are easily diluted with wood alcohol (temporary

type antifreeze) equal to 1/4 their content of ethyl alcohol

without detection.

A total intake of 2 or 3 ounces will cause

blindness or death in a few hours. Soft drinks can be easily

poisoned with ethylene glycol (permanent type antifreeze) at

the rate of 2 ounces per bottle.

This dose is usually fatal

and once symptoms develop there is no known antidote.

• When five parts of potassium permanganate is mixed with

one part of powdered sugar it forms a combination that will

either explode' (if confined) or burn with a flash if ignited in

the open.

A new idea might be to put three or four tablespoonsful

of this material in an ash tray covered with

a thin dust of cig-

arette ashes.

The first person to put his cigarette out in that

particular ash tray would be burned bad enough to be out of

commission for quite some time. Black powder, if available, would

actually explode if used in this way.

- USE OF BOOBY TRAPS

It is obvious that the use of booby traps favors an army in

retreat, and one of their greatest uses is to slow down pursuit.

For most efficient use the laying of booby traps must be done in

a planned and coordinated method. When time permits the entire

area to be booby trapped should be reconnoitered and the placement

of available material planned in such a way as to confuse the enemy,

impede his progress and cause maximum number of casualties.

Generally speaking a large number of small booby traps are

preferred to a few large ones.

Iwo or more triggers may be

autached to a single charge.

Variety of types and settings is

essential to effective use of booby traps in iarge numbers.

In the event that friendly troops or your own personnel

may re-enter such an area later on, it is desirable

that a written

record and detailed maps be kept as to where boody traps are

placed. When U.S. Army troops discover a place that is booby

trapped they mark it with a sign which consasts of a red triangle

-7-

CONFIDENT V

• pointed downward with a white circle in the middle and the word

booby traps painted in white across the top.

When anti-vehicle mines are placed by regular army forces

it is common practice to booby trip the mines so they will ex-

plode when being renoved by personnel attempting to clear the

area.

•The use of booby traps is very adaptable to boch guerrilla

and counter-guerrilla activity. Guerrilla warfare involves

two

basic types of action: ambushes and raids. When the guerrillas

ambush regular army forces, they are the ones that will make use

of the booby traps. In raiding an enemy garrison or supply depot

they must beware of booby traps that the regular forces have

placed to protect their fixed positions.

The ambush may start when the leading vehicle of an enemy

column strikes a mine or drives on to a bridge which is dynamited.

Perhaps time delay booby traps activated by the first vehicle in

the column may be used to destroy other vehicles several positions

behind. Troops riding in a truck convoy may be expected to seek

cover in ditches beside the road or other points of natural pro-

at the rose c ot

tection. If these ditches have been booby trapped beforehand, they

will be killed in the very process of seeking shelter.

Before making any raid on a fixed enemy position, guerrilla

forces should carefully consider the potential danger of booby

traps.

When regular army forces are being harrassed by guerrillas

they may be expected to leave supplies badly needed by the guerrillas

in slightly protected warehouses as traps. These supplies may be

heavily booby trapped and counter guerrilla forces may be waiting

& short distance away to take pursuit.

To guard against these

things, the guerrilla should attempt to keep their target under

surveillance for

several hours or days before making the raid.

They should observe the coming and going of enemy personnel.

If

the enemy is very careful to always come and go by the same route

it may mean that other routes are booby trapped. If the supplies

are not added to or taken from regularly; this may indicate that

they are being used to bait a trap.

By scouting the general area

guerrilla forces should guard against surprise by other enemy

forces waiting

within danger distance.

After making either a raid or an ambush, guerrilla forces

should place booby traps behind them to slow up pursuit.

Real

booby traps can be interspersed with imitation traps.

safe the enemy will have to go around or de-activate the imitations

and take just as much time doing so as if they were real. If the

enemy becomes careless in handling your imitation traps, he will

run the danger of getting killed by a live one.

In. planning the

path of their retreat guerrilla forces should booby trap alternate

• routes which enemy forces might use to cut them off.

SECRET ARMY ORGANIZATION

UNDERGROUND BULLETIN

GENERAL HEADQUARTERS

JANUARY 1972

"God grants liberty only to those who love it and are always willing to guard and

defend it'.

Daniel Webster

Fellow members,

This month's bulletin will deal mostly with "Booby Traps". Because of the

length of this article we are only sending out the first half this month. The second

half vill be published in next month's bulletin. Future bulletins this coming year

will contain material on psychological warfare, urban warfare tactics, communi-

cations, survival equipment, first aid, explosives, weapons, codes, and other re-

lated warfare subjects.

Those members who have not yet completed or started on the organization's

basic training prograins are hereby urged to do so. We cannot, in most cases,

assign any member to an important underground project of to an orgarized team

or group until they have completed this training program.

While headquarters cannot assign a member in the above classification to

an established unit, any member can (and is encouraged to) recruit and form their

own combat team (see December 1971 Bulletin). In many cases this may be the

best policy in regards to personal security as the member would be working with

the people he personally knows and trusts. If any member would like to form their

own unit they should write to their assigned mail drop and the organization will send

them further instructions along with a Team Recruiting Packet. The article on

"The Dispersed Team" in this month's bulletin should help those members who

wish to form their own Combat Team.

We are enclosing a small number of S. A. O. stickers with this month's

bulletin. Please put them in your shirt pocket or billfold and as soon as possible

stick. them up in phone booths, at bus stops, or other public places that you visit.

The stickers are already gummed and when wet will achere firmly to glass, metal,

or any other smooth surface. If our members would use these stickers along with

the leaflets that are available, it would have a real psychological impact on the

rest of the American people and give them evidence that there are still those among

them who are willing to fight for the re-establishment of a Constitutional Republic.

These firsi stickers are being sent to each member free, additional stickers and

Icaflets can be ordered on the monthly roport form.

DISPERSED TEAM

When discussing a Secret Army Organization "Combat Team", we usually think

of a small group of people who live very close to one another. Such an arrangement.

has certain advantages, such as ease of communication and travel for collective

training and team operations, but there are also several disadvantages.

Among the disadvantages are these: Team members may be well acquainted

with only a small geographical area. If forced to leave this area the team may be

placed at a serious disadvantage. It is harder for a team of SAO members who

live closely together to keep from attracting attention, thus unit security may be

poor. If one ember of the team is ever discovered and arrested.by the enemy,

chances are that all members of the team will be rounded up together:

These considerations have caused us to experiment with a new arrangement that

we refer to as a "Dispersed Team". Such a team has the same number of members

(usually six) as a regular Combat Team. Each team is split into two sections as is

the old team. The members have the same type of individual specialties and duties.

The big difference lies in the fact that the team members may be located over

a comparatively larger area - perhaps as much as 25 to 50 miles in diameter. In

urban areas one team member may live in each of six different cities. Thus the

team may range over a fairly large geographical area with at least one team member

being familiar with the immediate territory through which they are traveling.... ....

When active as part of an underground movement (as opposed to the classical

forms of guerrilla warfare) the Dispersed Team has several other advantages.

For example, if one member of the team gets too "hot"' in his area, he automatically

has five other hide-outs to which he can go for assistance or to which he can send

his family for temporary safety.

The Dispersed Team can conveniently cover a

larger area in the fields of recruiting, psychological warfare, and propaganda.

Operations of sabotage, surveillance and harassment of communist personnel,

raids, and other combat type operations can be successfully conducted while moving

a minimum of people over a minimum distance.

During the present period of deliberate delay the activities of the team will

naturally be different from some future period in which all out warfare between our

organization and our country's communist enemies develops.

If the team is to achieve its ultimate objectives the following astivities must

be provided for: (1) organization of and within the team, (2) communications between

the team and higher command, (3) maintaining secrecy of team members, (4) main-

taining a continuous and effective propaganda effort, (5) obtaining the necessary sup-

plies and equipment for present and future needs, (6) training of the team in general,

and of individual members in their own specialties.

When the required personnel are not available to form a full leam, a throe

man section should be formed. When additional people are recruited the unit can

then be expanded in an orderly fashion.

BOOBY TRAPS

Bxoadly defined a booby trap can be any kind of apparatus

In which a reaction unfavorable to the enemy is brought about

when he unintentionally makes some act which triggers the re

action.

The most common types of booby traps used in warfare

Involve an explosive charge which is set off by movement of a

tilp wire or the moving of some object which is connected to

the trigger mechanism.

On occasion the explosive charge may be replaced by

signal flares, gas, smoke or other chemical agents. The trigger

mechanism may be either electric, mechanical, thermal or chemical.

ELECTRICALLY OPERATED TRIGGERS. Such trigger mechanisms

are very easily arranged wherever a supply of electric blasting

caps are available and also a suitable source of electricity.

One of the most common electric type booby traps is to simply

Interrupt the electrical circuit in some building so that when

the lights are turned on the explosive is detonated. Thia

simple procedure applied to an automobile with a few sticks of

dynamite has marked the end of more than one gangland hoodlum.

To booby trap a car in this manner one side of the electric

blasting cap can be attached to any metal part of the car while

the other side is attached to a spark plug or the "cold side"

of the ignition switch. In the first case the cap detonates the-

dynamite when the starter motor is turned over or if attached to

the key switch detonating occurs when the ignition is turned on.

Any movable object can be booby trapped so that when it

18 moved some simple type electrical switch contact is closed

to complete a circuit between a dry cell battery and the des

tonator, A very simple example would be to have one wire tacked

along the edge of a door and the other wire tacked to the frame

and extending out far enough that contact is made between the

two when the door is opened. A slightly more refined trigger

Involves two small springs separated by some thin piece of in

sulation at one end as shown in Figure No. 1. When pressure

18 applied, the springs are held apast and when the pressure

is released, the springs come together to make electrical con-

tact. This may be placed in a door which is then closed to open

the switch while the explosive is wired into the circuit.

the door is opened pressure is released and the charge explodes.

This simple trigger can be placed under the leg of a chair,

a wooden box or any other movable object of uufficient weight.

If the chair is moved or the box lifted the release of pressure

• will close the electrical circuit.

A person skilled in the placement of booby traps will not

leave any part of the switch, wires or charge visible. Instead ne

connecting the wires to the door itself he will take off the door

• frame, place the trigger mechanism at the edge of the door and

then replace the frame so that the entire mechanism is hidden when

the, door is closed.

By taking off the frame of a window and drilling a hole

out through the window casing the

trigger mechanism can' be placed

so that the charge will be detonated by either raising or lowering

a half open window.

A simple time delay mechanism can be arranged by placing

one of these triggers under a glass jar filled with water. When

enough of the water evaporates, the weight of the jar will no

longer be sufficient to hold the contacts open.

Figure No. 2 shows another simple electrical trigger made

from a spring clothes pin. The improvised contacts are held

apart by a small wooden wedge in the jaws of the clothes pin.

This wedge can be attached to a trip wire or other movable object.

cuit

is completed.

A trigger of this type can be used to make a time delay

mechanism in many different ways. The wedge may be connected by

a loose cord to the end of a spring which is also attached to a

tin can.

Above this a second tin can full of sand or water is

placed

with a hole in the: bottom so that the contents gradually. .

fall through into the second can. When the weight of the lower

can becomes enough to stretch the spring

sufficiently the wedge

will be pulled from the clothes pin.

As an alternate method the

spring may be already stretched

out

and held there by a second

cord attached to some other solid object.

The cord holding the

spring.could be placed througi a candle so that it will be burned

in two when the candle burned down a certain distance.

An active

Imagination can devise countless ways for activating this type

of trigger either by instant action or delayed action.

A clever derivative of this simple trigger is used in the

"British book trap". In this case a book is hollowed out to

contain a small battery and a quarter pound block of TNI which

is detonated by an electrical blasting cap. The circuit passes

through two contacts attached to opposite pages of the book but

are held apart by some insulating material which is attached to

the back of the bookcase. If the book is withdrawn from the case

the contacts come together and the TNT is detonated.

• A British ball bearing contact switch is shown in Figure No.

• 3. This type of contact is very useful in placing charges entirely

within a movable object.

For example, a suitcase could be laid

on its side with the contact positioned inside in such a way that

when the suitcase was picked up the ball bearing would roll forward

• and complete the contact. Similar electrically activated booby

traps could be placed in closed gasoline cans, canteens, ammuni-

tion boxes or. dozens of other objects which an enemy would place

right side up before opening. A plastic or glass test tube

could be used instead of a metal case by sticking two wires through

the cork in such a manner that the ball bearing would come in

contact with both of them.

A surprisingly accurate timing device can be made with a

tube of this type. Holding the tube with the open end up, first

pour in a quantity of dried peas, then a measured

amount of

water, drop in the ball bearing (in this case a wad of tin foil

be used as well), finally put the cork in the top with the

vire sticking down through. The water will cause the dried peas

to swell which will push the ball bearing (or wad of tin foil)

up until it makes contact with the two wires to complete the

circuit.

The time can be regulated from a few minutes to several

hours depending on the length of the tube, the amount of water, and

the quantity of peas used.

Far more sophisticated types of electrical triggers are manu-

factured some of which operate by photoelectric cell or even more

difficult to recognize mechanisms. These may be used to safeguard

record centers, important military or missile bases, etc. but are

seldom encountered under battlefield conditions.

MECHANICAL TRIGGERS. These may be operated either by impact

or by friction. The ordinary hand grenade employs an impact

trigger.

When the handle is released a spring operated lever snaps

against a cap (similar to the priming cap in a shotgun shell)

which in turn starts a short fuse to burn. This fuse leads to a

blasting cap centered in an explosive charge.

The trigger mechanism of a "potato masher" hand grenade

operates much like the firing pin of a bolt action rifle. In

this case a spring activated plunger strikes a detonator. The

plunger may be released by pulling out a pin as shown in Figure

No. 4, by cutting a wire as shown in Figure No. 5 or by applying

pressure to a slotted key as shown in Figure No. 6.

Explosion of the primer cap alone is not sufficient. to dema

tonate most military explosives.

Generally a booster charge of a

fairly

sensitive explosive is detonated by the primer and this fi

turn detonates the main charge. In military use TNT is by far the

most common explosive used in the main charge of booby traps.

So called "plastic explosive" or "Composition 6-3" contains 78.

percent RDX and 22% plasticizer made up of mixture of dinitrotolune,.."*

TNT., nitrocellulose and dimethylformamide. RDX is cyclotrimethy

lenetrinitramine which is manufactured by nitrating hexamethylen2

tetramine (which is obtained by the reaction of formaldehyde and •

ammonia).

Booster charges where necessary are usually tetryl or PETN,

Common explosives used in primers are lead azide, lead styphnate

or the now largely discontinued mercury fulminate. Characteris-

tics, uses and manufacture of explosives will be dealt with in

another chapter.

A very simple device can be made from a screen door spring

that will explode an ordinary rifle cartridge when activated by a

trip wire. Although the "explosion" is almost harmless it can be

very nerve racking to an approaching enemy.

A more deadly booby trap consists of a short piece of pipe

which is driven into the ground. A plunger type trigger mechanism

is dropped into the pipe and an ordinary rifle cartridge placed

point up in the pipe so that perhaps one-half. inch is exposed

above the ground. The weight of a man stepping on the bullet

releases the trigger and fires the cartridge which will penetrate

well up into the leg or the body.

Some mechanical triggers are activated by friction just

like striking a match on the rough material of the match cover.

Figure No. 7 shows a cut-away drawing of the U.S. Army firing

device, pull friction type M-2. The coated wire is covered with

a gritty substance much like the strip on a book of matches.

When this is pulled out through a container of flash compound

(chemically similar to the match heads) the friction ignites the

flash compound which may be used either to light a fuse or fire

a blasting cap.

A crude but effective friction device can be prepared by

sticking the end of a fuse in some small cylinder filled with

match heads through which is placed a small strip of tin or heavy

cardboard with a friction strip from match books glued to both

sides.

In field use the friction type ignitor can be hidden in

many ways connected with trip wires or attached to movable objects

to set off either instant or delayed charges.

THERMAL, IGNITORS. In some cases the ignitor, (fuse or primer)

can be used as a trigger mechanism. For example in World War II

the Germans were known to tear down fireplaces and cement cham :?

back together with hidden charges that would ignite when a ftre...

was built.

simple hand grenade or mortar shell hidden in a

hollow log by a burned out fire would, of course, explode if the

log were used

as fuel without being inspected.

A common trick is for a retreating army to leave behind coal

o11 lamps or lanterns filled with gasoline.

An unthinking person

who touches a match to such a lantern will nearly always be burned

to death.

CHENICAL TRIGGERS. These are nore frequently used in the

construction of time bombs than in booby traps. Figure No. 8

shows an Italian chemical delay igniter.

The upper chamber

contains acetone. When the piercing pin is pushed downward it

penetrates the lead disc and allows the acetone to flow into the

lower chamber.

The acetone gradually dissolves the celluloid

washer which holds back the striker.

The time delay can be varied

by placing different numbers of cellophane washers on the striker

rod.

In several similar types of delayed mechanisms the striker

is held back by a thin metal wire which is gradually dissolved

when a solution of acid is allowed to surround it.

Other types of delay mechanisms may be constructed where a

liquid is allowed to drop through a small hole into a lower con-

tainer having a reactive substance attached part way up one wall.

The liquid level in the chamber gradually raises until it comes

in contact with the reactive substance which is the igniter.

One

suitable combination is sulfuric acid for the liquid

and a mixture

of potassium chlorate and sugar for the solid. Another suitable

combination is plain water for the liquid and metallic sodium for

the solid.

There are many other combinations which

a chemist might

improvise from materials at hand.

There are some explosives so sensitive that they can be used

as trigger mechanisms.

Ammonium tri-iodide can be made from

ordinary household ammonia and iodine crystals. If the jodine

crystals are not available they can be obtained by evaporating

sufficient volume of tincture of iodine in a flat glass dish.

Place two or three teaspoons of jodine crystals in a piece

of kleenex and wet thoroughly with strong ammonia solution. A

small amount of ammonia may be added from time to time making

certain that it does not have the chance to dry out. After three

or four tablespoons of ammonia solution have been absorbed and

partly evaporated from the iodine it can be left to dry out. While

wet ammonium tri-iodide is reasonably safe to handle. When dry,

it is so sensitive that it detonates at the slightest touch. It

may be exploded by a person walking on a wooden

floor several feet

away or a door being closed in the same building. The amount

described above will produce a violent explosion and should be

treated with extreme caution.

Several similar compounds will be

mentioned in the chapter on explosives.

One or two teaspoonsful of mercury fulminate of silver

fulminate mixed (very gently) with ten percent coarse sand can

be placed in a small packet of paper and attached to the upper

side of an automobile tire with adhesive tape.

When the tire rolls

over it the fulminate will explode with sufficient power to destroy

even a husky truck tire. These combinations also are very danger-

ous to handle.

READY MADE BOOBY TRAPS

All national armies are supplied with a variety of

manufactured trigger devices, charges, etc. to be used

specifically as booby trap material. Most firing devices

are threaded on one end with a standing size that allows them to

be used either with prepared charges or with improvised charges

made from mortar or artillery shells. Figure No. 9 shows a

simple firing device attached to a hand grenade.

An antipersonnel mine of French manufacture is shown in

Figure No. 10. The apparatus at the left side is a trigger

mechanism that can be operated by a trip wire.

When it is fired

the flash

passes through the "U" tube which propels a 60mm

grenade into the air and at the same time ignites a 1/5 second

delay pellet. The grenade explodes a few feet off the ground

to shower metal fragments over a wide area. Total weight of

mine is 5-1/2 pounds.

Guerrilla bands have sometimes used artillery shells or

mortar shells in demolition work by placing them in a large

pile of wood or other combustible material and building a bond

fire around them until they exploded. For booby traps use, however,

the projectile of an artillery shell is the only part of any

value.

Useful sizes include 75mm, 90mm, 105mm, and 155mm.

In

those artillery shells where the prjectile is attached to the case,

it is generally best to remove the projectile and discard the case.

Artillery shell projectiles may be fused either in the nose or

in the base.

For most efficient use, the regular fuse must be

unscrewed and a standard firing device (Ml0 Universal destructor)

put in its place.

IMPROVISED BOOBY TRAPS

Standard hand grenades can be used alone in booby traps

in a number of methods. The simplest is to carefully remove

the handle and wedge the grenade between two heavy objects

strong enough to hold the spring in the cocked position.

• Another trick is to cover a hand grenade with wet mud with

just the safety pin ring sticking out. After the mud has hardened,

it will hold the handle in place and the safety pin ring can be

withdrawn.

These harmless looking clumps of mud scattered along

a dirt road will, of course, break open when hit by an automobile

tire which will release the handle and fire the grenade.

A similar

trick is to place grenades in glass jars tight enough to hold the

handle in place when the safety pins are withdrawn.

At night these

may be strung on a wire across a inad and may not be seen by a

car traveling at night with its lights off. When the bottles

break the grenade handles are released and they soon explode.

It seems doubtful that man's ingenuity will ever be

exhausted when it comes to improvising traps of various types.

A rusty nail

stuck to a board left where it will be stepped

on by a running enemy may be just as deadly to that one indivi-

dual as an atomic bomb.

Open pits (sometimes with sharp stakes

ai the bottom; covered with flimsy camouflage is much older than

the bow and arrow, but were still used by the Japanese in World

War II.

"Dead falls" made from heavy tree limbs that fall when a

victim releases them by tripping over a jungle vine can still

be useful in guerrilla warfare.

Leaving behind poisoned food or bottled drinks is common.

Alcoholic drinks are easily diluted with wood alcohol (temporary

type antifreeze) equal to 1/4 their content of ethyl alcohol

without detection. A total intake of 2 or 3 ounces will cause

blindness or death in a few hours. Soft drinks can be easily

poisoned with ethylene glycol (permanent type antifreeze) at

the rate of 2 ounces per bottle.

This dose is usually fatal

and once symptoms develop there is no known antidote,

• When five parts of potassium permanganate is mixed with

one part of powdered sugar it forms a combination that will

either explode (if confined) or burn with a flash if ignited in

the open.

A new idea might be to put three or four tablespoonsful

of this material in an ash tray covered with a thin dust of cig-

arette ashes. The first person to put his cigarette out in that

particular ash tray would be burned bad enough to be out of

commission for quite some time. Black powder, if available, would

actually explode if used in this way.

USE OF BOOBY TRAPS

It is obvious that the use of booby traps favors an army in

retreat, and one of their greatest uses is to slow down pursuit.

• For most efficient use the laying of booby traps must be done in

a planned and coordinated method. When time permits the entire

area to be booby trapped should be reconnoitered and the placement

of available material planned in such a way as to confuse the enemy,

impede his progress and cause maximum number of casualties.

Generally speaking a large number of small booby traps are

preferred lo a few large ones.

Iwo or more triggers may ba

autached to a single charge.

Variety of types and settings 1s

essential to effective use of booby traps in large numbers.

In the event that friendly troops or your own personnel

may re-enter such an area later on, it is desirable that a written

record and detailed maps be kept as to where boody traps are

placed.

When U.S. Army troops discover a place that is booby

trapped they mark it with a sign which consists of a red triangle

ril

pointed downvard with a white circle in the middle and the word

booby traps painted in white across the top.

When

anti-vehicle mines are placed by regular army forces

it is common practice to booby trap the mines so they will ex-

plode when being removed by personnel attempting to clear the

area.

The use of booby traps is vory adaptable to boch guerrilla

and counter-guerrilla activity. Guerrilla warfare involves two

basic types of action:

ambushes and raids. When the guerrillas

ambush regular army forces, they are the ones that will make use

of the booby traps.

In raiding an enemy garrison or supply depot

they must beware of booby traps that the regular forces have

placed to protect their fixed positions.

The ambush may start when the leading vehicle of an enemy

column strikes a mine or drives on to a bridge which is dyramited.

Perhaps time delay booby traps activated by the first vehicle in

the column may be used to destroy other vehicles several positions

behind.. Troops riding in a truck convoy may be expected to seek

cover in ditches beside the road or other points of natural pro-

tection.

If these ditches have been booby trapped beforehand, they

will be killed in the very process of seeking shelter.

Before making any raid on a fixed enemy position, guerrilla

forces should carefully consider the potential danger of booby

traps.

When regular army forces are being harrassed by guerrillas

they may be expected to leave supplies badly needed by the guerrillas

in slightly protected warehouses as traps.

These supplies may be

heavily booby trapped

and counter guerrilla forces may be waiting

a short distance away to take pursuit.

To guard against these

things, the guerrilla should attempt to keep their target under

surveillance for

several hours or days before making the raid.

They should observe the coming and going of enemy personnel.

If

the enemy is very careful to always come and go by the same route

it may mean that other routes are booby trapped. If the supplies

are not added to or taken from regularly, this may indicate that

they are being used to bait a trap.

By

scouting the general area

guerrilla forces should guard against surprise by other enemy

forces waiting within danger distance.

After making either a raid or an ambush, guerrilla forces

should place booby traps behind them to slow up pursuit. Real

booby traps can be interspersed with imitation traps.

safe the enemy will have to go around or de-activate the imitations

and take just as much time doing so as if they were real. If the

enemy becomes careless in handling your imitation traps, he will

run the danger of getting killed by a live onc.

In planning the

path of their retreat guerrilla forces should booby trap alternate

routes which enemy forces might use to cut them off.

DAVIS was continually talking about the plans he was making

to start a new organization.

considered the MM organization to be defunct, at

in the san Diego area and in most of the Western

states,

and felt the need to organize a new Right Wing group to

fill the power vacuum which it had left.

He indicated that

he knew people in Phoenix, Arizona; Portland, Oregon; Seattle,

Washington, and Las Vegas, Nevada, who he wanted to contat

regarding such an organization, feeling that they would be

highly interested in helping to organize and get it going.

He said his plans included having Post Office boxes rented

for the new organization in all these cities and having

leaflets and stickers regarding the organization printed

using the respective Post Office box numbers.

On a pre-determined

day, press releases would be made in each of these cities

announcing the formation of the organization with the leaflets

and stickers being put up in the cities on the same day.

This would be done for the purpose of disguising the location

of the national headquarters, which would be actually located

in San Diego, California.

It was also reported that, in addition to the

Letterhead stationery and application forms, several thousand

copies of the history leaflet and the first

bulletin had also

been printed at the same time as well as a number of stickers

advertising for the SAO. The printing of these materials was

done by BETTIE HAUGHTON on an offset press which she had

maintained since the time her husband was in the MM organization.

Many copies of these printed materials have been sent out to

people known in the past to have been MM members or other

Right Wing sympathizers.

The meeting mentioned in the first paragraph of the

history leaflet is actually a disguised reference to the meeting

which took place in the motel room at Yuma, Arizona, on

October 17, 1971.

SECRET ARMY ORGANIZATION

GENERAL HEADQUARTERS

Dear T'ellow American,

At the request of a mutual friend we are sending you this invitation to

join the Secret Army Organization. Those of us who have been members for

some time sincerely believe that our organization can be of real value in pre-

serving for future generations the land of freedom and opportunity which our.

forefathers handed down to us.

It is the belief of our organization that the communist-socialist con-

spiracy has infiltrated the United States Government to such an extent that the

• American people cannot rely on this country's elected leaders to protect them

from communist domination and slavery.

We believe that the time will come when the American people will have

to fight for their lives and their liberty. In this belief, we have formed in

advance a secret underground army with but one objective, to defend our con-

stitutional republic and to help our fellow Americans to do the same.

We do no want lukewarm members. We are an organization of people

willing to make any sacrifice necessary for our country. If you feel the same

way, we invite you to join us.

GENERAL HEADQUARTERS

Dear: Fellow American,

Your letter of inquiry concerning the Secret Army Organization was

received a few days ago. We havehad so many iuquiries during the past few

months that it has been impossible to answer each of them promptly with a

personal letter.

We certainly appreciate your interest in our organization and we hope

you will join us in our battle for national and individual freedom. As you

• learn more about the Secret Army Organization I'm sure you will come to

realize that we are not radicals, but are far more inclined tobe quietly ded-

icated and clear thinking individuals.

Enclosed is some further information about our organization, its

history, objectives and programs. After you have given this material

careful study, we hope you will use the enclosed application form to join our

organization.

When sending in your application, do not put your return

address or name on the outside of the envelope.

Aitor your membership application has been processed, we would

cextainly welcome having you work with one of our local units, or better

still, helpyou organize your own unit with our assistance after you have

completed preliminary training.

Sincerely yours,

Mistory

Secret Army Organt

One carly morning in February, 1970, a group of six Vinutemen leaders from

Sour states met secretly in Northern Arizona to discuss the crisis that the arrest and

imprisonment of two top Minutemen leaders and the assassination of a third had

brought on the organization. Although some of these men had met before in their roles

as Minutemon group leaders, others were meeting for the first time.

After much discussion, two principal points were agreed upon. First, that the

Minutemen as a national coordination organization of militant right-wing groups had

effectively been destroyed by the pro-communist elements inside the Justice Depart-

mant. While individual mits still existed throughout the country, few lad the financial

support or leadership to be rcally effective. Second, that the need for such a coord.-

nating organization wasgreater than ever in view of the increased revolutionary activity

by communists in the United States.

With these two points in mind, suggestions were put forward on a course of

action to be followed. After a meeting that lasted all that day and far into the next

morning, an overail plan of action was finally agreed upon. All present agreed to

merge their individual units together and form a new organization under the command

of one leader elcoted from among thenselves, with the other five to be members of a

General Staff that would advise and assist the new leader.

While rotaining the basic programs and policies of the Minutemen, it was

decided that not only should this new organization have a different name, but also a

compleicly now chain of command and organizational structure. If the new organiza-

lion was going to survive the attacks that befell the old one, a whole new approach

would he needed: Never again could the arrestor death of a few leaders be allowed io

cripple the chlize organization.

• For: this reason it was decided thai only a highly disciplined military type

orgainization with & definite chainnf.command would have any chance of suecess. This

then, was the beginning of the Secret Army Organization. Beginning with an original.

force of hard core patriots that numbered fewer than two hundred, the Secret Army

Organization began thejob of picking up the pieces and continuing to fight for national

and individual feedom. Using this cadre of dedicated personnel as a nucleus, the

S. A. O. has bech recruiting and training new members in the skills they will need as

the freedom fighters of tomorsow.

The leaders of the S. A. O. have no idea of fighting a last dilch stand. We have

no desire to cominit suicide ourscives or to let our members do so. We have a

stantess which we believe will ultimatcly load to victory. Only one thing is essential.

We must start preparing and training NOW! We of the S. A. O. believe that our country

is worthy of any sacrifice. If you feel the same way, we invite you to join us.

exemplity the neuessityof such a: organization, we quote

the 19G0 Annual Roportof the Committee on Ua-American

Activilies as follow's:

"Ivents of the past year have provided convincing

evidence that the Amorican people canuot rely completely

on this

country's armed torces to protect themselves

from communist domination and slavery.

This is not

because our military forces lack the power or the will to

defend this country, but rather because the nature of the

attacks being made on the United States by its major and

only significant. enemy are so designed as to ender con-

ventional military forces as ineffective as possible for

defense purposes."

Starting from nothing 50 ycars ago, cominunism

in the past 20 years the communists have conquered 21

sovereign nations, one by armed conquest and 10 by in

There is not one of these countries in which the

communists rule ty the consent of the people. Every-

where they must perpetuate themselves by terror. They

remai; in power onls throligh the use of the most brutal

police state tactics.

The communists consider their party workers

not simply as an accossory to armed conquest but as the

, actual spearhead of any invasion into new territory.

From this point of view the United States was "invaded"

by Soviet troops morc thau 30 years ago.

It has been

To

pective Members Of The

SECRET ARMY ORGANIZATION

The Secret Army Organization is the most active, most completely dedicatel and

most selective in its membership of all the many patriotic organinations in America.

We are willing to make any sacrifice for on' country and we fully expect that some of

us vill have to make the ultimate sacrifice before victory is achieved. Our very lives

depend on each other. There is no place in this orgunization for bunglers, playboys or

lukewarm conservatives. If you join the Secrct Army Organization, there might easily

come a time that your life would depend on how competently some other member had

learned his job.

Unless you are especially well informed on the domestic and world political

situation, it is probable that you have a lot to learn about the present threat our nation

faces. Unless you have had many years experience in actual underground ivarfare,

there is undoubtedly a lot you can learn from the experts in our organization who have

developed and supervised our training program.

OUR NATION IS IN IMMEDIATE DANGER

It is possible that within a very few years, perhaps even within months, our

nation could be conquered and enslaved by the communists. Io prevent this we must

know as much as possible about our enemies. Unless we know who they are and what

they are doing we will not succeed in our efforts to maintain a free America.

THE RESISTANCE MOVEMENI

In driving an invader from your land the resistance involved goes through three

stages of development.

1) The Underground Network

2) Active Guerrilla Warfare

3) Open or Conventional Warfare

The conventional warfare stage uses everything in the way of weapons that the

enemy does but must also have active guerrillas andunderground agents working against

the enemy, too. In the present state of military tactics conventional warfare cannot

succeed unless these other two ingredients are used simultaneously.

The first step is to form an underground network. An active guerrilla system

must have the support of an underground network of approximately three times its own

size. This undorground must supply the active guerrilla fighter with supplies, con-

cealment, information, elc. An underground network starts with departments of

intelligence, security and propaganda in that order.

Sabotage, espionage, subversion, infiltration, escape and evasion, training,

clandestine tabrication of supplies, couterteiting enemy documents, recruiting, com-

munications and propaganda are other phases of underground activity. Each member

of the Secret Army Organization, to be effective, must have a working knowledge of

all these tacties as woll as the military toetics more commonly associated with guerril-

la activities.

ASSIGNMENT TO UNITS

Many people that inquire about membership in the Secret Army Organization

seem to have an idea that they will be immeditely accepted into an active unit.

Look at it this way.

Suppose you had spent a year or more carefully rccruiting and

training until you had a hard hitting team where every individunl was reliable, dedi-

cated, and had confidence in his fellow unit members. Wouldn't it make you mad to

have the national or regional organization assign some rank amateur to your unit

that you you knew little or nothing aboul?

Before any new member is assignedto an active unit or to an important under-

ground project, he mistundergo a period of training. During this training he will be

directed through the mails by an experienced member and some of his activities may

be observed by other members without his knowledge. Only when a new member

proves himsell to be conscientious, trustworthy, self-disciplined and able to operate

effectively alone will he be accepted as a "secure member" and invited to participate

with other unit members in a teamwork operation.

EXPENSES

Unfortunately, most good things don't come cheap. Although we make every

effort to keep down the expense of membership in the Secret Army Organization, you

must expect to pay your own way.

Dues to the Secret Army Organization are $3. 00 per mouth. This money is

absolutely necessary for use to maintain our central files and headquarters,

for

postage and printing, to finance our extensive intelligence network, aud to maintain

training areas.

Each member will have other expenses depending on the type of activity he is

engaged in. Every member will be expected to buy his own gun, am nunition and

other basic comhat equipment. During training the new member may be expected to

buy certain books or subscribe to certain magazines that his work requires. During

this time the new member will also be suppliedwith reading material on the strategy

and tactios of guerrilla warfare. This home work will make it possible for him to

fit in quickly to an active unit and participate ellectively in actual maneuvers,

marksmanship training, etc.

Following this preliminary training a member may be either assigned to an

existing unit, assisted in organizing his own unit if he has shown sufficient leadership

qualities or become part of an underground network.

Upon your acceptance into the Secret Army Organization you will be given a

definito series of projects described inwriting so you will know exactly what will be

expected. of you.

We hope that you can succeed in this offori because your country desperately

necds

patricts at this time.

• drops. The mail drop is an address listed in a fictitious name of a person or

company not connected with the organization. Each member is assigned one that

ho will use in sending all reports, correspondence, materials, etc., to the organ-

ization. Your assigned mail drop is:

We have a tremendous job_ahead of us. Certainly, none of us pretend to

know what the future holds for ourselves or for our native land. We do feel, how-

ever, that our freedom is gravely threatened. It is not always possible to know

the best thing to do. But we do know this - our forefathers have given us a life of

frecdom and opportunity such as never existed before in all history. We musi

strive to pass this heritage on to future generations intact.

Our organization is not suggesting or doing anything more than Americans

have always done - starting in 1776.

Enclosed is some further information about our organization, its history,

objectives, and programs. Your record has been turned over to our training ser-

tion and you should receive your first training program within two weeks.

Sincerely yours,

Captain Patrick McDonald

THE COMBAT TEAM

General Outline

The "Combat Team" is the smallest organizational unit uscd by the Secret

Army Organization. When organized in the proper manne! it is capable of opera-

tionalinitiative when detached from the parent orgarization. When developed to

its highest degree of efficiency the Combat Team is almost totally self-sufficient

and able to perform any one of several missions. To attain these aims the follow-

ing elements are essential:

a.

Equipment should be well-chosen and standardized as much as pos-

sible.

Communications, internal and external, must be capable of rapid.

transmission, be varied

in nature, and be exercised with prime

emphasis on security.

c.

Iuternal coordination shouid be automatic in response. Confidence

among members of the team must be developed.

d.

Selection of each position on the team should be based on psycholog

ical aspects as well as technical competence.

Training of the men in each function should be at regular intervals

and continuous. Field problems should be given dry runs in detail.

f.

The logistics problem should be studied with care, and made simple

and direct.

%.

Eachteam will have a "leader" (Lieutenant) and an"assistant leader"'

(Sergeant). These men shall be given special training by the Secret

Army Organization at "leadership seminars".

.h.

Tean "marshalling points" should be selected in advance and be

well defined. Practice "alerts" will determine the team's efficiency

in response and security.

i.

Terrain familiarity within the expected operational radius of the

team must be developed.

Weapons familiarity must beobtained throughlivefirings at various

targets.

Team action must be stressed as well as individual com-

petence.

k.

The team loader should see that a constant flow of information is

provided to tean members on the ideological struggle. This will

• heip induce the proper frame of mind in each member.

Teamn missions and largets must be identified and the proper train-

inge equipment made available for each assigument.

- 1. -

NW 68262_Docld:32989523 Page 1377

## Page 1378

m.

The leam leaders will be responsible for maintaining the overall,

security of the unit. Personal feelings should not affect decisions

involving reprimandor dismissal of men from the tean for reasons

that endanger its operation or securily.

n.

•

Intelligence gathering as an important part of each team member's

duties should be stressed. Information on the location and move-

ments of local communist and left-wing enemies of the organization

should be sent to either Regional or General Headquarters.

The team leaders will be responsible for maintaining contact with

higher command and for the transmission of orders from same.

ORGANIZATION

The "Combat Team" will consist of six men. These six men will be divid-

ed into two sub-teams (Sections). Number One Section will consist of the Team

Lieutenant and two other team members. Number Two Section will consist of the

Team Sergeant and the two remaining team members. When completely assembled

the wit will act directly under the command of the Team Lieutenant. When split

into sections the Team Sergeant will carry out the orders of the Team Lieutenant

during missions but will be in immediate command of the Number Two Section,

In the absence of the Team Lieutenant the Sergeant will take command of the Unit.

TRANSPOSTATION

Transportation of the Combat Team will be effected by the use of to car-

riers. Interception and/or destruction of one carrier will not, then, immobilize

the team. In addition, each carrier can serve as a scouting element for the other.

Motorized carriers should be as inconspicuous as possible and still serve their

purpose. Jeeps

and pickup trucks should be used only where such vehicles are

owned and used commonly by the general population or where the terrain makes

their

use necessary. Most often an ordinary passenger car will suffice. The

model selected should have a good road clearance so it can be used on dirt roads.

Tire chains (il needed), hydraulic jacks, extra gas, water, and suitable tools

should be stored in the vehicle.

TRAVEL PROCEDURES

Underway, Carrier #1 will lead and Carrier #2 will trail, The "interval"

will vary with conditions. In cities close-aboard trailing will be used. Open road,

by day, will require an interval of approximatoly 300 yards. At night this will

be reduced to approximately 100 yards. During travel, all equipment (especially

arms and ammunition) should be kept out of sight. Spocial team equipment and

weapons should be locked in the trunk of the vehicle until needed. The trunk key

should be carefully hidden so as to make it difficult to search the trunk in case

law enforcement agonis should stop the car on some protext with the intention of

searching it illegally.

WEAPONS AND EQUIPMENT

Selection of weapons and supplies should give the Combat Team masimum

flexibility to meet any condition that may be encountered in either rural or urban

warfare. Consideration should be given to all possible situations that may de-

velop relating to both traditional guerrilla warfare and modern underground war-

fare techniques. It should be kept in mind that the Combat Team is a functional

part of a resistance nework. It's activities should be coordinated with other

teams to take maximun advantage of its striking powers.

Disregarding the inclusion of weapons peculiar to a given mission, the

standard distribution of men and weapons could be as follows:

#1

(Team Lieutenant) AR-180 Assault Rifle, automatic pistol, sheath

knife, flare gun, and binoculars. 300 rounds of ammunition load-

ed in clips should be carried for the rifle, plus 50 extra rounds of

ammunition for the pistol.

#2• (Tean Member) Riot Shotgun, automatic pistol, sheath knife, and

wire cutters (with insulated handles), 100 rounds of No. 4 Buck-

shot in pouches for the shotgun, and 50 rounds of pistol ammunition.

#3

(Team Member) AR-180 Assault Rifle, automatic pistol, sheath

knife, and smoke grenades or flares. 300 rounds of armunition

in clips for the rifle, and 50 rounds of pistol ammunition.

#4

(Team Sergeant) AR-130 Assault Rifle, automatic pistol, sheath

knife, flare gun, and binoculars. Ammunition requirement is

the same as i1 man.

#5

(Team Member) M1903 Springfield Rifle with sniper scope, auto-

matic pistol, sheath life, aud entrenching shovel. 100 rounds of

AP ammunition in bandoleers for the rifle, and 50 rounds of pis -

• tol ammunition.

#6

(Team Member) AR-180 Assauli Rifle, automatic pistol, sheath

• knife, and 30 feet of climbing rope with grappling hook.

nition requirement is the same as #1 man.

PRACTICAL SECURITY MEASURES

1. Use deceptive moasures. Subsoribeto one or more left wing periodicals

or get on the mailing list of soing "peace movement". This will keep the postal in-

specoirs guessing as to which side you are really on. While doing this our members

can be of great assistance in searching this left-wing litcrature for names and ad-

dresses of fellow travelers and forwarding this information for our Central Intelli-

gence files. We desperately need poople to assist in this work. Please inquire as

to detailed instructions for such activity.

2.

Alvays use livo envelopes in sending mail to any patriotic organizations or

to any other member of our onorganization. Do not put a return address on the

outer envelope. Put your return address on the inside envelope with the words,

"return postage guaranteed".

3. Place some opaque material such as tin foil, carbon paper, etc. between

the inner and outer envelopes to prevent your mail from being read by intra-rea

cameras.

4. Send all letters from corner mail boxes or from post offices where you

are not known.

5. Be careful in the use of the telephone. Avoid telephoue calls to knowi

members of the organization as

much as possible.

6. Prepare telephone codes ahoad of time for future protection.

i. In recruiting new members always learn as much as you can about tie

prospective recruit and make sure he is not an infiltrator before you identify your-

self as & member of the organization.

8. Members of the organization in each area should be divided into four

groups:

A. Those who have been identified publicly or by law enforcement agencies

as members of the Secret Army Organization.

B. Those persons not known as members of this organization but who are

generally known as being patriots.

C. Those pursons who have kept their political beliefs hidden.

D. Members who profoss to be liberal for the purpose of infiltrating enemy

organizations.

All members should be very caroful in making contact with persons in a

different category than themselves.

for example, people in Class D should be

very secret in their contacts ind communications with persons of Class A or Class

NW 68262 Docld:32989523 Page 1380

---

## Page 1381

B. Tach member must res

et the security of every other men

I'. Do not, under

any circumstances, identify one membes of the organization even to other membors

without his expressed permission on each and every occasion.

9. Avoid loose talk. Do not discuss organizational plans in public places

where you could be overheard. Do not even hint at such a discussion in the pre-

sence of non-members.

10. Do not write patriotic letters lo newepapers or magazines under your

• own name. To do so achieves very little except to identify you to the enemy.

11. If you are already known as a patrioi, or as a member of this organiza-

tion you may find itadvisable to spread the rumor that you have become disillusioned

with the right-wing or for you to pretend a gradual loss of interest.

12. Classify your various members addresses, you communications and

your other activities as "iop secret", "secret" or "restricted". Use your most

secret lines of communication only for the most important messages rather than

flooding them with unimportant material.

13. Demand obedience to all security measures from all members.

Per-

sistent disregard for security measures should be cause for disciplinary action.

14. Check your lines of communication from time to time by sending phoney

messages to make certain they are not intercepted.

15. Change mail drops, meeting places, etc. frequently.

16. Piepare secret sendevous

points, mail drops, etc, now that may be

used in time of some future emergency.

17. Each unit should assign some member the rank of Security Officer and

should set up a system of lines or other penalties for failure to comply with secur-

ity precautions:

18. Obsorve the "need to know" rule. Each member should be given only

that information which is needed by hiin in the performance of his duty or which

he will need in cooperating with other members of the unit. No member should

feel "left out"' because he is denied such information. Instead every member

should willingly avoid information which he does not need.

19. Be careful that you are not followed in going to and from meeting places

or in making conteet with other members of the organization.

20. Kep all records ad correspondenco carofully hidden and in a manner

that they can be easily destroyed. Records ahona be kept in code whenever possi-

ble.

GENERAL HEADQUARTERS

Dear Fellow American,

Enclosed with this letter is your Preliminary Training Program. This

first program is only a brief outline of some of the material that will be cover-

ed in later programs. There are four basic programs used by the Secret Army

Organization: Intelligence, Security, Propaganda, and Recruiting, in that

order. Each program will cost the new member $3. 00 and will take between

one to three weeks to complete.

The correspondence training program serves a number of purposes,

but the two major purposes are:

I. It lets us know which members of the organization have the patience

and determination to finish assignments given them.

2. It lets us be certain that the members have the necessary basic

training in intelligence, security, etc., which is essential to al-

most any imporiant task which we could assign a member in under-

ground warfare.

Proper training in these four basic slills is absolutely essential for

every member of an underground army. A member may be an experi in sur-

vival techniques, use of weapons, urban warfare tactics and all the rest but

experience has shown that without these other basic skills they seldom do much

fighting - they just commit suicide.

For those of you who wish to become active and trusted members of the

Secret Army Organization, let us emphasize again that the quickest way of do-

ing so is to begin and diligently complete the basic training programs.

After you have comploted the five work projects listed in the Preliminary

Training Program send $3.00 in to your regular mail drop and we will send you

the first training program on Intelligence.

In view of the urgent situation we

now face some of our new members may receive special assignments after

having completed the first two training programs. If this happons please try

to redouble your efforts so that your special assigoments can be taken care of

while continuing to complete your regular training program.

PRELIMINARY TRAINING PROGRAM

It would be a mistake to think that our enemies have one set plan for the con-

• quest of the United States. They are maintaining many continuous attacks on many

fronts at the same time - political, education, business, labor, aud even religion.

They are continuously probing for weak spots in the defenses of our nation. During

the past fourly rears so many openings have been left to them by the stupidity and

collusion of vur national leaders that they have been able to adrance almost at will.

There is little we can do to change this

situation at this time. Rather than

deplete our limited resources on futile attempts to do so, we must concentrate on

building a workable anti-communist underground army based on rcalities rather

than wishful thinking and organized on the tried and proven principles of underground

warfare.

The communists have fifty yoars experience in supressing anti-communist

underground activity. It we are to light them successfully - if we are to hold out.

until the final victory of freedom over iranny - then our underground army is going

to have to be the most skillful and dedicaied that the world has ever known. There

is only one kind of member that can qualify for such an army - the very best!

This will require intensive training and practice. There is no short cut to

perfection. By drawing on the talents of several of our more experienced members

We think we now have a training program that can develop that kind of underground

army.

In this program four different types of training will be involved:

1. Corespondence and printed material.

2. Tape recordings, picture sides, charts, etc., sold or loaned to S. A. O.

units or members.

3. Actual expericnce - "On the job" training by carrying oul assignments

under supervision of more experienced members.

1. Training mancuvers - Duc to the difficulty of keeping large training ses-…...

sions seerct the General Staff has decided that such training sessions will be held

only for sinall select groups that have already completed sufficient preliminary

training it the loead lovel.

INTELLIGENCE - SECURITY - PROPAGANDA

This preliminary training losson is designodto give our members basic know-

ledge and practice in intelligenes, securityand propaganda. This firstlesson is basic

""

proparation for adranced

training in those three important activities which will be

dealt with in greater detail further on in the training program.

INTELLIGENCE

Underground warfire, as we customarily think of it, cannol succeed unless it

is supported by a well developed organization comprising all the essential functions

of intelligence, security, propaganda, communicalions, supply, medical services,

Of all these, intelligence is must important. Let's consider one example:

Suppose you pickes! up a telephone bool, opened it up to any page at random, closed

your eyes and put your finger on one name. Now.

suppose you read that name for

the first time and said to yourself, "Sometime in the next 30 days I'm goingto kill

this man."

Consider the situation - one man, picked at random is marked for death. He

might be the most powarful, the wealthiest, the most influential man in that city but

none of thes things woul help him in the least. Ha would be defenseless. Why?Be-

cause you would have one thing that he did not have - intelligence. You would know

his identity and he would not know yours. So long as that condition continued, there

would be no possible ivay in which he could arrange an adequate defense against you.

Exacily the same situation exists between ourselves and our communist and

socialist enemies. Our success will be directly proportionate to our knowledge of

them sod inversely proportionate to their knowledge of us.

Whatever a member's principal job may be in the Seerci Army Organization,

he must have a basic knowledge of intelligence techniques. This subject is there-

fore the first to be considered in our training program.

The word "intelligence", when used in a military sense refers to those

metheds that can be used lo gain useful information. We usually think of this as

knowledge of the enemy but il also includes information about the terrain, general

population, available supplies and all other facts that will help in planning future

activities.

Intelligence is roughly divided into three parts:

I. Observation. During a hoi war this includes scouting and patrolling,

observation of enemy troop movements, ele. On the cold war front this includes

shadowing of enemy personnel, surveillance of cnemy ofticers, tapping of telephones,

interception of messages, ele.

2. Research and Analysis. Collecting and cataloging all possible useful

information trom general sources, newspapers, radio, trade magazines, cie.,

then-matching up isolated scraps of information until an accurate picture is obtained

of somo situation that would not themrise be know.

3. Espionage. This involves the placing or recruiting

ot agonts within the

enemy persomel where they can learn the onemy's plans first hand, steal the chemy's

documents or materials, influence or misdirect the enemy's plans or policios.

Suppose you had a chance to seesome important document for just a few

minutes. How quickly could you sean it for its essential content? How well could

you separaie the important from the unimportant? Could you record this informa-

tion in a written message that can be easily read and will not be misinterpreted?

Imagine that you are the leader of a patrol sent forward to observe and

track an

enemy column prior to a possible ambush. From time to time you will

need to send back your observations in written form. Each S. A. O. member must

develop the ability to put his thoughts on paper in such a way that they will be casily

read and unmistakable.

The first two projects are designed to give the new member an opportunity

to test those skilis while learning (or reviewing) basic elements of espionage

activity. When theschave been completed more advanced material will be furnished

to the member directly. Useful intelligence projects of increasing complexity and

imporiance will be assigned to those wishing to specialize in this works.

SECURITY

It is obvious what a great advantage we can gain over our chemies by proper

information about their plans and activities. It is equally true that much of this

advantage will be lost unless we can keep our plans and activities secret from them.

•This is the basic purpose of all security activities. Overall secruity operations of

an underground movement can be divided into five basic parts:

1. Protecting the identity of underground personnel and their families.

2. Keeping secret the location, movements and plans of underground units.

3. Keeping secret the location of underground headquarters, alternate

hideouts and supply depots.

4.

Protecting the identity of civilians, or individual members of the popu-

lation that are friendly to underground forces.

5. Maintaining secrecy of communications..

As we have alroady said il is difficull to even guess what forms the coming

conflict will take. Nevertheless, the strategy of all successful underground move-

ments must salisty these three basic principles:

First, is the "Principle oi Deliberato Dolay". During this statc, the undor-

ground gathers its forces, checks its security, prepares its intelligence, establishes

its lines of communications and wails for the enemy tobecome complacent and over-

confident.

Secondis the "Prin

ple of Provocation'. At the beginn

of this stage only

a fors real patriots ate villing to take port inunderground aetivity. The vast mujor

ity of the population is still wishfully thinking that they can "get along" with the

oppressive forces. They want only lobe lott alone and will not take action until thoy

are personally threatened. Duringthis stage the underground conducts a series of

actions which provoke the caemy forces into making harsh repressive measures on

the general population. This turns the goneral population against the oppressive

forces and convinces them that the underground is rcally their only hope.

Stage Thrce may be called "Principle of Natural Allies". When the govern-

ment's action against the goneral population becomes sufficiently brutal then large

numbers of peopic will be willing to help or join the underground.

Their reasons

ior doing so may he numborous and their ideology man not always be the same as

the basic underground movement. During this stage minor differences between

different underground groups must be minimized and all of our natural allies must

be rallied to the cause of freedom.

The intolligence branch of our organization is well aware of the communist

infiltration and control of the present United States government. It can rightly be

said that we are now partially controlled by a foreign ideology. Thus, we are al

ready engaged in Phase I of this conflict. How long this will continue until open

warfare breaks out is anyone's guess. Once again, the best prediction of our in-

tellignece department is that Stage Il will last for several months, perhaps even .

years. This will be a time of assassination and courter assassination, terror and

counter lerror. During this phase the "average citizen" may avoid direct-conflict

at the price of his dignity and individual freedom. Known patriots will be in ex-

treme danger.

- For most people membership in the

Secret Army Organization will not

materially increase their danger during this time. For many years our enemies

have carefully catalogued the name and address of every person who has ever

written a patriotic letter to a newspapei. The membership lists of the more prom-

inent "conservative" organizations havelongbeen available to communist infiltrators

• in these organizations.

-

Continued activity and membership in other conservative organizations by

members of the S. A. O. is desirable in many cases but those individuals should not

identity themseives as mombers of the Secret Army Organization. For most of our

own members it will be bost if you do not take part in the activitics of these other

organizations. Although muny of you are already "marked" men a cerinin degree

of security can still be achiovod by quietly dropping out of other right-wing activities

and keeping your membership in the S.A. O, secret from all except your most

trusted follow numbers.

Thore may come a time when the average American is still. able to go about

his business with little regimentation but daring which you as a known or suspected

patriot, may he sought oud for arrest or assassinaion.

Project Ill listed at the end of this chapter ma: make it possible for the or-

ganivation to contact you and render assistance should you ever find it necessary lo

go into hiding with little advance nolice.

Project IV is a first step toward learning mure about your enemies and at

the same lime, confusing them as to which side you are really on.

PROPAGANDA

Another essential function of the underground is to convincingly inform the

general public of what they stand for and thus gain the support of the general popu-

lation.

This must be done through propaganda, both written and spoken. Under

conditions of enemy «ccupation the spreading of anti-communist propaganda would

obviously be very dangerous. Even son there are certain phases of our propaganda

effort that is bast rone by surreptitious means. Thus, observation, communication

and propaganda are three elementary duties of every underground member.

Never bofore has propaganda been so imporiant to the ultimate ouicome of a

major conflict. The ulitmate object of any war is to force your desires-on the minds

of your enemies. Our enemies are attempting to do this by the non-violent means

of psychological varfare.

PRELIMINARY TRAINING LESSON

Projuct No. 1

Look over the various books in your local public library that have been

written on intelligence and espionage.

Select two that seem best and read them

carefully.

• Project No. 2

Write a brief outline of these ilo books and send it to your regular assign-

ed mail drop or to General Headquarters.

Project No. 3

Get in touch with one trusted friend that you do not ordinarily see too

often. Preferably one that does not live in your present neighborhood. Inform

him that hẹ may, in the future, receive letters with an inner envelope with your

name on it: Make sure he vill keep these envelopes confidential and will secretly

pass them on to you or hold them until you can pick them up. Letus know

this alternate address in case we need to contact you in extreme circumstances.

Projeci No.

4.

Make necessary preparations to use a fictitious name for receipt of left-

wirg literaiure

and correspondence. An important part of each members duties

is to keep yourself and our organization informed on left-wing and communist

activity in your area.

A phoney organization that includes the word "Peace" as part of its namo

is always a suitable cover. The address can be a P. O. Box, that of a friend, or

even your own address. Mail soveral letters to the name and address you de-

cide on to get the postal employees accustomed to it now. Then you will be ready

to use it for the real thing.

Project No. 5

While working in the library, place the enclosed Secret Army Organiza-

tion leallets in between the pages of various books where they will be found and

read by others:

TRAINING PROGRAM

INTELLIGENCE

We are faced with a dangerous enemy who has repeatedly boasted of his

plans to destroy our Constitutional Prepublic and to ensiave our people.

For more than fourty years they have been infiltrating their agents into

the most sensitive areas of labor, press, entertainment, education, law, com-

munications, religion, industry and government. The degrec of their success

is made obvious by our government's failureto oppose communisro internation-

ally and by our fellow citizens' lack of interest in their own preservation.

We already know

a considerable amount about this enemy; their origin,

objectives, approximate strength, organizational structure and general meth-

ods of operation.

There are four areas where we especially need additonal information:

1. Details of the techniques used in espionage, infiltration and subver-

sion by individual agents, including the methods by which they control their

fellow travelers.

2 The equipment used for surveillance, communication, assassination,

sabotage, etc., by individual enemy agents.

3. Working details of their short range programs either in operation or

planned for the near future.

• 4. The actual identity of enemy agents, fellow travelers and sympathi-

zers along with details regarding their work, place of residence, cover opera-

tion, means of transportation, travel pattern, personal appearance, mental

characteristics, personal lives, business and organizational activities.

Our ultimate victory or defeat may depend on our

ability to obtain

enough of this vitally important information.

There are literally thousands of sources from which bits of valuable in-

formation can be obtained. These range from such extremes as the local news-

papers to documents stolen from the enemy's guarded vaults.

• The methods of guthering intolligence are roughly divided into two

groups: 1) Research and Analysis, and 2) Espionage.

Espionage includes all the "illogal" means of obraining information, such

as wire-tapping, intereception of mail, stealing of documents, secretly photo-

graphing records, infiltrating spies into enemy organizations, bribing or black-

mailing individuals of the enemy apparatus.

Research and Analysis includes the careful systematic search of all

newspapers, magazines, trade journals, house organs, political pamphlets,

books, public records, etc., to sift a few "needles" of valuable intelligence

from several "haystacks" of general information.

Professional intelligence organizations obtain about 95% of their infor-

mation from Research and Analysis and only about 5% from Espionage. When

espionage techniques are used, they prove most effective when a specific mis-

sion is carefully planned out in advance which takes advantage of all possible

background information that may be obtained by research methods.

Let's examine how these various techniques might be used to obtain

additional information of the four basic types we need most.

1. Details of the techniques used in espionage, infiltration and subver

sion by individual agents including methods by which they control their fellow

travelers..

An agent trainee may learn something of the general espionage methods

used by communist agents who have defected from the party and have then

written about their experiences. Beyond this they are of very little value.

The

actual details of such techniques are uniformly neglected.

More useful information can be obtained from the study of past court

records in which evidence has been presented in espionage cases. Hints and

clues may occasionally be picked up from continuous and careful study of the

regular news media. Really basic information of this type, however, must be

ohlained by infiltration and espionage techniques.

•2. The cquipment used for surveillance, communications, assassination.

sabotage, etc., by individual agents.

Hints about the type of hidden microphones, short wave transmitters,

miniture tape recordo's, ete. used in surveillance and communication by es-

pionage agents sometimes are mentioned by chance in the regular press or

news magazines, in connection with reported spy cases. Technicil details and

construction plans occasionally are given in the electronics or "Popular Science"

type magarines. Other information may be reposted directly from the manu-

incturers of such equipment.

The typc of short acting or long acting poisons best suited for assassina-

tión under various conditions might be anticipated by a careful study of toxicol-

ogy; from "Chemical Abstracis" and Biological Abstracts'; from current mag-

zines on pharmacology, as wellas from such magazines as "Scientific Monthly"

and "Science Newsletter", all available from larger city libraries.

Information on explosives is available fror ordinance journals, litera-

túre from manufacturers, technical books, mining and drilling magazines, etc.

Naturally, such special fields of interest are best pursued by some per-

son who already has an aptitude in each particular line.

This is one of the things that makes us feel that the American people are

uniquely equipped to form a deadly effective underground. Nowhere else in the

world does any population have as many useful hobbies and avocations that could

be adapted to underground warfare. Many by products of these hobbies can be

used as sabotage instruments. Just one typical example - the dust from grind-

ing wheels in metal shops should be saved to mix with grease for the bearings

of enemy machinery.

Working details of their immediate and future plans and activities.

Advance information about "peace marches" and racial demonstzations

car be had by subscribing to appropriate commmist front publications. Details

as to the size of the demonstration and degree of violence anticipated must be

obtained by infiltrating such organizations. Communist plans for future propa

ganda campaigns, subversion, espionage, blackmail of government officials,

etc., may be learned directly by infitration or may be deduced from a close

study of their past activities.

4 Identity and personal information about enemy agents.

This requires the full scope of counter espionage activity; research and

analysis of enemy publications, monitoring. of communist sponsored meetings,

survillance of party offices, infiltration of enemy apparatus, recruitment of

double agents, interception of enemy communications, otc., etc.

TECHNIQUES OF EFFECTIVE RESEARCH

1. Every researcher should be constantly on the alert for useful infor-

mation in the general news media - radio, TV, magazines, etc.

2. Each researcher should have one field of interest to which he gives

special attention.

- 3-

4/2

## Page 1392

For example:

One researcher: might read every book available on "escape and evasion"

and all the stories oi articles writtenonprison escapes, looking for ideas that

might someday help our members escape from a concentration camp.

Another researcher might continuously search the communist front

publications for names of fellow travelers; for anouncements of future meet-

ings, rallies or similar activities; for additional information that would tie

suspected communists to known communist organization; for friendships, bus-

iness connections and family relationships between known communists and un-

known communists.

Each city should have one researcher that carefully reads the daily

papers to extract such information as: names of speakers at left wing meei-

ings, names and addresses of both left and right wing letters to the editor,

social functions attended by known communists, names of persons who might

be potential recruits, news of coming "peace marches" and similar demonstra-

tions, expressions of either pen or anti communict sentiments by local public

officials, educators, businessmen, ministers, etc., evidence of communist

inspired violence, sabotage or biackmail.

There is an almosi endless variety of areas that need to be covered.

Based on his or her own interests and abilities each researcher should choose

the specialty for which they are best qualified.

3. Be as specific as possible. Look for details. Include blue-prints,

drawings or photographs of all technical equipment when possible. Don't ex-

pect your analyist to be a "mind reader". Include all the fac!s, Continuously

ask yourself the questions: Would this information be of value to the Secret

Army Organization? To individual espionage agents? To other members?

To our technical specialists?

4. Avoid editorial opinions and general news items as these are of

little value and needlessly swamp our limited staff of analyists.

5. Do all the work locally that you possibly can. If the person is local,

looks thom up in the telephone hook or cross index. Double check to make sure

the address is correct and that they still live there. Type cards if possible,

otherwise, print plainly. Inelude phone numbers and licence numbers of cars

Whenever possible.

6.

Use standard $ x 5 inch index cards for sending in information on

individuals. Clip pages el magazines or photostat importaut articles. In

otlining books, be sure important facts are fully covered.

No doubt most citizens of San Diego are aware of the controversy surrounding the act

vities of San Diego State Economics Professor PETER G. BONER. For any of you who are

munist activities behind him, has made it his policy to give lover grades to students

un his classroon who do noù share his left wing views. One of his students was a veteran

aí the Vietnam War, with a fine combai record. This student vos a specisi target of

tomer, who never missed an opportunity to ridicule and insult thia students

belief's.

A quick look at Bolmer's record will show why he hated this student. In I970 Boher's

record will show 45 days in the pokey for anti-war protesting. This was when he was

graduate student at MIT in Massachusetts. The demonstrntion that earned him his jail

ras against defeuse research conducted on the KIT campus... He was also a menber of

and a supporter of the Black Fanther Party while at Farvard and MIT. It does seen

strange that San Diego State was not able to find another professor sonerhers who was

not a commist jail bird.

The purpose of this memorandum is to advise that a new

group known as "Secret Army Organization" (SAO), a small ultra-

conservative paramilitary organization recently formed in the

San Diego, California, area, reportedly has been involved in

extremist acts.

A confidential source recently furnished infornation

regarding a clandestine meeting and plans to form a new white-

hate organization called SAO which reportedly would take. the place

• of the Minutemen grnup in San Diego. '

The Minutemen, also a para-

- military group, was organized in Missouri during 1960 to act as

a resistance to the spread of communism by use of guerrilla tactics.

During the evening of 1/6/72, two shots were fired,

injuring one person, at the residence of Peter Bohmer, a San Diego

State College professor. Shots reportedly came from the direction

of a passing automobile and were fired by a white male described

as being in his mid twenties.

Bohmer and others at his residencel

Jat the time of the shooting reportedly are active in the San Diego

Convention Coalition which is a New Left group formed during the

Fall of 1971 to organize demonstrations at the Republican National

Convention scheduled to be held in San Diego during August, 1972.

Bohmer reportedly has indicated that on 1/6/72 prior to the

shooting he received two threatening telephone calls from persons

stating they were members of SAO.

A sticker of SAO was also

pasted to the door of Bohmer's office.

Some SAO organizers appear to be identical with individ- '

uals who were formerly involved in Minutenen activities.

Five former members of the Minutemen organization

met in secret in October, 1971, for the purpose, in their

words, of effecting "an organization of loyal Americans

dedicated to the preservation of both national and individual

freedon."

According to source, this is predominantly a

Minutemen oriented movement which couches its statement of

principles as follows in a piece of its literature captioned

"Join the Secret Army Organization":

I) To prepare the means of personal defense

and survival in case of enemy attack.

2) To resist and expose the spread of communist

influence and propaganda within our own national

boundaries.

3) To investigate by means of our own secret

memberships the infiltration of communist sympathizers

into American organizations of government, business,

labor, religion and education.

GENERAL HEADQUARTERS

SATION

Dear Fellow American,

• Your application for membership in the Secret Army Organization has been

processed and approved. It is our profound hope that your membership in the

S. A. O. will prove to be a benefit to the organization and yourself as well. A

dedicated member will find that his association with our organization is a way of

life that is far more rewarding than the ordinary mediocre existence of his fellow

enlightened citizens.

For security purposes all records regarding individual members are listed

by numbers only. Your number will be

_ Please sign all future

correspondence addressed to the organization with this number. You need not list

your address unless it is different from the one in our records.

Another security measure employed by our organization is the use of mail

drops. The mail drop is an address listed in a fictitious name of a person or

company not cornected with the organization. Each member is assigned one that

he will use in sending all reports, correspondence, materials, etc., to the organ-

ization. Your assigned mail drop IS:

We have a tremendous job_ahead of us. Certainly, none of us pretend to

know what the future holds for ourselves or for our native land. We do feel, how-

ever, that our freedom is gravely threatened. It is not always possible to know

the best thing to do. But we do know this - our forefathers have given us a life of

freedom and opportunity such as never existed before in all history. We must

strive to pass this heritage on to future generations intact.

Our organization is not suggesting or doing anything more than Americans

have always done - starting in 1776.

Enclosed is some further information about our organization, its history,

objectives, and programs. Your record has been turned over to our training sec-

tion and you should receive your first training program within two weeks..

Sincercly yours,

ARIZ:

HI.

CON

PRACTICAL SECURITY MEASURES

1: Use deceptive measures. Subscribeto one or more left-wing periodicals

or get on the mailing list of some "peace movement". This will keep the postal in-

specotrs guessing as to which side you are really on. While doing this our members

can be of great assistance in searching this left-wing literature for names and ad-

dresses of fellow travelers and forwarding this information for our Central Intelli-

gence files. We desperatoly need people to assist in this work. Please inquire as

to detailed instructions for such activity.

2. Always use'two envelopes in sending mail to any patriotic organizations or

to any other memher of our ownorganization. Do not put a return address on the

outer envelope. Put your return address on the inside envelope with the words,

"return postage guaranteed".

3.

Place some opaque material such as tin foil, carbon paper, etc. between

the inner and outer envelopes to prevent your mail from being read by infra- red

• cameras.

4. Send all letters from corner mail boxes

or from post offices where you

are not known.

*5.

Be careful in the use of the telephone. Avoid telephone calls to known

members of the organization as much as possible.

6. Prepare telephone codes ahead of time for future protection.

7. In recruiting new members always learn as much as you can about the

prospective recruit and make sure he is not an infiltrator before you identify your-

self as a member of the organization.

8. Members of the organization in each area should be divided into four

groups:

A.

B.

Those who have been identified publicly or by law enforcement agencies

as members of the Secret Army Organization.

Those persons not known as members of this organization but who are

generally known as being patriots.

• C. Those persons who have kept their political beliefs hidden.

D. Members who profess to be liberal for the purpose of infiltrating enemy

organizations.

• All members should be very careful in making contact with persons in a

different category than themselves. For oxample, people in Class I should be

very secret in their contacts and communications with persons of Class A or Class

9. Avoid loose talk. Do not discuss organizational plans in public places

where you could be overheard. Do not even hint at such a discussion in the pre-

sence.of non-members.

10. Do not write patriotic letters to newspapers or magazines under your

own name. To do so achieves very little except to identify you to the enemy.

11. If you are already known as a patriot, or as a member of this organiza-.

tion you may find it advisable to spread the rumor that you have become disillusioned

with the right-wing or for you to pretend a gradual loss of interest.

12: Classify your various members addresses, you communications and

your other activities as "top secret, "secret" or "restricted". Use your most

secret lines of communication only for the most important messages rather than

flooding them with unimportant material.

13. Demand obedience to all security measures from all members. Per-

sistent disregard for security measures should be cause for disciplinary action.

14. Check your lines of communication from time to time by serding phoney.

messages to make certain they are not intercepted.

15. Change mail drops, meeting places,

etc.

frequently.

16. Prepare secret rendevous points, mail/drops, etc. now that may be

used in time of some future emergency.

17. Each unit should assign some member the rank of Security Officer and.

should set up a system of lines or other penalties for failure to comply with secur-

ity precautions.

18. Observe the "need to know" rulé. Each member should be given only

that information

which is needed by him in the performance of his duty or which

he will

need in cooperating with other members of the unit. No member should

feel "left out" because he is denied such information. Instead every member

should willingly avoid information which he does not need.

19. Be careful that you are not followed in going to and from meeting places

or in making contact with other members of the organization.

20. Keep all records and correspondence carefully hidden and in a manner

that they can be easily destroyed. Records should be kept in code whenever possi-

ble.

Dear Fellow American,

Enclosed with this letter is your Preliminary Training Program. This

first program is only a brief outline of some of the material that will be cover-

ed in later programs. There are four basic programs used by the Secret Army

Organization: Intelligence, Security, Propaganda, and Recruiting, in that

order. Each program will cost the new member $3. 00 and will take between

one to three weeks to complete.

The correspondence training program

serves a number of purposes,

but the two major purposes are:

I. It lets us know which members of the organization have the patience

and determination to finish assignments given them.

2. It lets us be certain that the members have the necessary basic

training in intelligence, security, etc., which is essential to al-

most any important task which we could assign a member in under~

ground warfare.

Proper training in these four basic skills is absolutely essential for

every member of an underground army. A member may be an expert in sur-

vival techniques, use of weapons, urban warfare tactics and all the rest but

experience has shown that without these other basic skills they seldom do much

fighting - they just commit suicide.

For those of you who wish to become active and trusted members of the

Secret Army Organization, let us emphasize again that the quickest way of do-

ing so is to begin and diligently complete the basic training programs.

After you have completed the five work projects listed in the Preliminary

Training Program send $3.00 in to your regular mail drop and we will send you

the first training program on Intelligence. In view of the urgent situation we

now face some of our new members may receive special assignments after

having completed the first two training programs. If this happens please try

to redouble your efforts so that your special assignments can be taken care of

while continuing to complete your regular training program.

PRELIMINARY TRAINING LESSON

Project No. 1

Look over the various books in your local public library that have been

written on intelligence and espionage. Select two that seem best and read them

carefully.

Project No. 2

Write a brief outline of these two books and send it to your regular assign-

ed mail drop or to General Headquarters.

Get in touch ivith one trusted friend that you do not ordinarily see too

often. Preferably one that does not live in your present neighborhood. Inform

him that hẹ may, in the future, receive letters with an inner envelope with your

name on'it: Make sure he vill keep these envelopes confidential and will secretly

pass them on to you or hold them until you can pick them up.

Letus know

this alternate address in case we need to contact you in extreme circumstances.

Project No.

Make necessary preparations to use a fictitious name for receipt of left-

wirg literature and correspondence. An important part of each members duties

is to keep yourself and our organization informed on left-wing and communist

activity in your area.

A phoney organization that includes the word "Peace" as part of its name

is always a suitable cover. The address can be a P. O. Box, that of a friend, or

even your own address. Mail several letters to the name and address you de-

cide on to get the postal employees accustomed to it now. Then you will be ready

to use it for the real thing.

Project No. 5

While working in the library, place the enclosed Secret Army Organiza-

tion leaflets in between the pages of various books where they will be found and

read by others.

• PRELIMINARY TRAINING PROGRAM

It would be a mistake to think that our enemies have one set plan for the con-

quest of the United States. They are maintaining many continuous attacks on many

fronts at the same time - political, education, business, labor, and even religion.

They are continuously probing for weak spots in the defenses of our nation. During

the past fourly years so many openings have been left to them by the stupidity and

collusion of our national leaders that they have been able to adrance almost at will.

There is little we can do to change this situation at this time. Rather than

deplete our limited resources on futile attempts to do so, we must concentrate on

building a workable anti-communist underground army based on realities rather

than wishful thinking and organized on the tried and proven principles of underground

warfare.

The communists have fifty years experience in supressing anti-communist

underground activity. If we are to fight them successfully - if we are to hold out

until the final victory of freedom over tyranny - then our underground army is going

to have to be the most skillful and dedicated that the world has ever known.

There

• is only one kind of member that can qualify for such an army - the very best!

This will require intensive training and practice.. There is no short cut to

perfection. By drawing on the talents of several of our more experienced members

we think we now have a training program that can develoy that kind of underground

army.

In this program four different types of training will be involved:

1. Correspondence and printed material.

2. Tape recordings, picture slides, charts, etc., sold or loaned to S. A. O.

units or members.

3. Actual experience - "On the job" training by carrying out assignments

under supervision of more experienced members.

4. Training maneuvers - Duc to the difficulty of keeping large training ses-

sions secrct the General Staff has decided that such training sessions will be held

only for small soloct groups that have already completed sufficient preliminary

training at the local level.

INTELLIGENCE - SECURITY - PROPAGANDA

This preliminary training lesson is designedto give our members basic know-

Jedge and practice in intelligenee, security and propaganda. This first lesson is basic

preparation for advanced training in these three important activities which will be

dealt with in grenter detail further on in the training program.

INTELLIGENCE

Underground warfare, as we customarily think of it, cannot succeed unless it

is supported by a well developed organization comprising all the essential functions

of intelligence, security, propaganda, communications, supply, medical services,

etc.

Ot all these, intelligence is most important. Let's consider one example:

Suppose you picked up a telephone book, opened it up to any page at random, closed

your eyes and put your finger on one name. Now suppose you read that nama for

the first time and said to yourself, "Sometime in the next 30 days I'm going to kill

this man,"

Consider the situation - one man, picked at random is marked for death. He

might be the most powerful, the wealthiest, the most influential man in that city but

none of thes things woul help him in the least. He would be defenseless. Why? Be-

cause you would have one thing that he did not have - intelligence. You would know

his identity and he would not know yours. So long as that condition continued, there

would be no possible ivay in which he could arrange an adequate defense against you.

Exactly the same situation exists between oursolves and our communist and

socialist enemies. Our success will be directly proportionate to our knowledge of

them and inversely proportionate to their knowledge of us.

Whatever a member's principal job may be in the Secret Army Organization,

he must have a basic knowledge of intelligence techniques. This subject is there-

fore the first to be considered in our training program.

The word "intelligence"', when used in a military sense refers to those

methods that can be used to gain useful information. We usually think of this as

knowledge of the enemy but it also includes information about the terrain, general

population, available supplies and all other facts that will help in planning future

activities.

, Intelligence is roughly divided into three parts:

• 1. Observation. During a hot war this includes scouting and patrolling,

observation of enemy troop movements, etc. On the cold war front this includes

shadowing of enemy personnel, surveillance of enemy officers, tapping of telephones,

interception of messages, etc.

2. Rescarch and Analysis. Collecting and cataloging all possible useful

information from general sources, nowspapers, radio, trade magazines, etc. ,

then matching up isolated scraps of information until an accurate picture is obtained

of some situation that would not therwise be known.

3. Espionage. This involves the placing or recruiting of agents within the

enemy perso.nel where they can learn the enemy's plans first hand, steal the enemy's

documents or materials, influence or misdirect the enemy's plans or policies.

Suppose you had a chance to seesome important document for just a few

minutes. How quickly could you scan it for its essential content? How well could

you separate the important from the unimportant? Could you record this informa-

tion in a written message that can be easily read and will not be misinterpreted?

Imagine that you are the leader of a patrol sent forward to observe and

track an enemy column prior to a possible ambush. From time to time you will

need to send back your observations in written form. Each S. A. O. member must

" develop the ability to put his thoughts on paper in such a way that they will be easily

read and unmistakable.

The first two projects

are designed to give the new member an opportunity

to test these skills while learning (or reviewing) basic elements of espionage

activity. When these have been completed more advanced material will be furnished

to the member directly. Useful intelligence projects of increasing complexity and

importance will be assigned to those wishing to specialize in this work.

SECURITY

It is obvious what a great advantage we can gain over our enemies by proper

information about their plans and activities. It is equally true that much of this

advantage will be lost unless we can keep our plans and activities secret from them.

This is the basic purpose of all security activities. Overall secruity operations of

an underground movement can be divided into five basic parts:

1. Protecting the identity of underground personnel and their families.

2. Keeping secret the location, movements and plans of underground units.

3. Keeping secret the location of underground headquarters, alternate

hideouts and supply depots.

4. Protecting the identity of civilians, or individual members of the popu-

lation that are friendly to underground forces.

• 5. Maintaining secrecy of communications.

As we have already said it is difficult to even guess what forms the coming

conflict will takc. Nevertheless, the strategy of all successful underground move-

ments must satisfy these three basic principles:

First, is the "Principle of Deliberate Delay". During this state, the under-

ground gathers its forces, checks its sccurity, prepares its intelligence, establishes

its lines of communications and waits for the enemy to become complacent and over-

confident.

10

to:

Second is the "Principle of Provocation". At the beginning of this stage only

a few real patriots are villing to take part inunderground activity. The vast major-

ity of the population is still wishfully thinking that they can "get along" with the

oppressive forces.

They want only tobe left alone and will not take action until they

are personally threatened. During this stage the underground conducts a series of

actions which provoke the enemj forces into making harsh repressive measures on

the general population. This turns the gencral population against the oppressive

forces and convinces them that the underground is really their only hope.

Stage Three may be called "Principle of Natural Allies". When the govern-

ment's action against the general population becomes sufficiently brutal then large

numbers of people will be willing to help or join the underground. Their reasons

for doing so may be numberous and their ideology man not always be the same as

the basic underground movement. During this stage minor differences between

different underground groups must be minimized and all of our natural allies must

be rallied to the cause of freedom.

The intelligence branch of our organization is well aware of the communist

infiltration and control of the present United States government. It can rightly be

said that we are now partially controlled by a foreign ideology. Thus, we are al-

ready engaged in Phase I of this conflict. How long this will continue until open

warfare breaks out is anyone's guess. Once again, the best prediction of our in-

tellignece department is that Stage II will last for several months, perhaps even

years. This will be a time of assassination and counter assassination, terror and

counter terror. During this phase the "average citizen" may avoid direct conflict

at the price of his dignity and individual freedom. Known patriots will be in ex-

treme danger.

For most people membership in the Secret Army Organization will not

materially increase their danger during this time. For many years our enemies

have carefully catalogued the name and address of every person who has ever

written a patriotic letter to a newspaper. The membership lists of the more prom-

inent "conservative" organizations havelong been available to communist infiltrators

in these organizations.

Continued activity and membership in other conservative organizations by

members of the S. A. O. is desirable in many cases but those individuals should not

identify themselves as members of the Secret Army Organization. For most of our

own members it will be best if you do not take part in the activities of these other

organizations. Although many of you are already "marked" men a certain degree

of security can still be achieved by quietly dropping out of other right-wing activities

and keeping your membership in the S. A. O. secret from all except your most

trusted fellow members.

There may come a time when the average American is still able to go about

his business with little regimentation but during which you as a known or suspected

patriot, miy be sought out for arrest or assassination.

Project IlI listed at the end of this chapter may make it possible for the or-

ganization to contact you and render assistance should you ever find it necessary to

go into hiding with little advance notice.

Project IV is a first step toward learning more about your enemies and at

the same time, confusing them as to which side you are really on.

PROPAGANDA

Another essential function of the underground is to convincingly inform the

general public of what they stand for and thus gain the support of the general popu-

lation. This must be done through propaganda, both written and spoken. Under

conditions of enemy occupation the spreading of anti-communist propaganda would

obviously be very dangerous. Even now there are certain phases of our propaganda

effort that is best done by surreptitious means. Thus, observation, communication

and propaganda are three elementary duties of every underground member.

- Never before has propaganda been so imporiant to the ultimate outcome of a

major conflict. The ulitmate object of any war is to force your desires on the minds

of your enemies. Our enemies are attempting to do this by the non-violent means

of psychological warfare.

TEAPONS AND EQUIPMENT

Selection of weapons and supplies should give the Combat Team maximum

flexibility to meet any condition that may be encountered in either rural or urban

warfare. Consideration should be given to all possible situations that may de-

velop relating to both traditional guerrilla warfare and modern underground war-

fare techniques. It should be kept in mind that the Combat Team is a functional

part of a resistance network. It's activities should be coordinated with other

teams to take maximum advantage of its striking powers.

Disregarding the inclusion of weapons peculiar to a given mission, the

standard distribution of men and weapons could be as follows:

#1

(Team Lieutenant) AR-180 Assault Rifle, automatic pistol, sheath

knife, flare gun, and binoculars. 300 rounds of ammunition load-

ed in clips should becarried for the rifle, plus 50 extra rounds of

ammunition for the pistol.

#2

(Team Member) Riot Shotgun, automatic pistol, sheath knife, and

wire cutters (with insulated handles). 100 rounds of No. 4 Buck~

shot in pouches for the shotgun, and 50 rounds of pistol ammunition.

$3

(Team Member) AR-180 Assault Rifle, automatic pistol, sheath

knife, and smoke grenades or flares.

300 rounds of ammunition

in clips for the rifle, and 50 rounds of pistol ammunition.

#4

• (Team Sergeant) AR-180 Assault Rifle, automatic pistol, sheath

knife, flare gun, and binoculars. Ammunition requirement is

the same as #1 man.

#5

(Team Member) M1903 Springfield Rifle with sniper scope, auto-

matic pistol, sheath knife, and entrenching shovel. 100 rounds of

AP ammunition in bandoleers for the rifle, and 50 rounds of pis -

tol ammunition.

#6

(Team Member) AR-180 Assault Rifle, automatic pistol, sheath

knife, and 30 feet of climbing rope with grappling hook. Ammu-

nition requirement is the same as #1 man.

ADDITIONAL MATERIAL

In addition to the weapons and supplies already listed each team member

should have the following basic equipment:

Sleeping bag and waterproof ground cloth

Canteen (1 quart army type)

C.

Survival rations for three days

First aid kit

e.

m.

The team leaders will be responsible for maintaining the overall

security of the unit. Personal

feelings should not. affect decisions

involving reprimand or dismissal of men from the team for reasons

that endanger its operation or security.

n.

Intelligence gathering as an important part of each team member's

duties should be stressed. Information on the location and move-

ments of local communist and left-wing enemies of the organization

should be sent to either Regional or General Headquarters.

The team leaders will be responsible for maintaining contact with

higher command and for the transmission of orders from same.

ORGANIZATION

The "Combat Team" will consist of six men.

These six men will be divid-

ed into two sub-teams (Sections). Number One Section will consist of the Team

Lieutenant and two other team members. Number Two Section will consist of the

Team Sergeant and the two remaining team members. When completely assembled

the unit will act directly under the command of the 'Team Lieutenant. When split

into sections the Team Sergeant will carry out the orders of the Team Lieutenant

during missions but will be in immediate command of the Number Two Section.

In the absence of the Team Lieutenant the Sergeant will take command of the Unit.

TRANSPORTATION

Transportation of the Combat Team will be effected by the use of two car-

riers. Interception and/or destruction of one carrier will not, then, immobilize

the team. In addition, each carrier can serve as a scouting element for the other.

Motorized carriers should be as inconspicuous as possible and still serve their

purpose. Jeeps and pickup trucks should be used only where such vehicles are

owned and used commonly by the general population or where the terrain makes

their use necessary. Most often an ordinary passenger car will suffice. The

model selected should have a good road clearance so it can be used on dirt roads.

Tire chains (if needed), hydraulic jacks, extra gas, water, and suitable tools

should be stored in the vehicle.

TRAVEL PROCEDURES

Underway, Carrier #I will lead and Carrier #2 will trail. The "interval"

will vary with conditions. In cilies close-aboard trailing will be used. Open road,

by day, will require an interval of approximately 300 yards. At night this will

be reduced to approximately 100 yards. During travel, all equipment (especially

arms and ammunition; should be kept out of sight. Special team equipment and

weapons should be locked in the trunk of the vehicle until needed. The trunk key

should be carefully hidden so as to make it difficult to search the trunk in case

law enforcement agents should stop the car on some pretext with the intention of

searching it illegally.

THE COMBAT TEAM

General Outline

The "Combat Team" is the smallest organizational unit used by the Secret

Army Organization. When organized in the proper manner it is capable of opera-

tional initiative when detached from the parent organization. When developed to

its highest degree of efficiency the Combat Team is almost totally self-sufficient

and able to perform any one of several missions. To attain these aims the follow-

ing elements are essential:

a.

Equipment should be well-chosen and standardized as much as pos-

sible.

b.

C.

d.

e.

1.

h.

ari

j.

k.

Communications, internal and external, must be capable of rapid

transmission, be varied in nature, and be exercised with prime

emphasis on security.

Internal coordination should be automatic in response. Confidence

among members of the team must be developed.

Selection of each position on the team should be based on psycholog-

ical aspects as well as technical competence.

Training of the men in each function should be at regular intervals

and continuous. Field problems should be given dry runs in detail.

The logistics problem should be studied with care, and made simple

and direct.

Each team will have a "leader" (Lieutenant) and an "assistant leader"

(Sergeant). These men shall be given special training by the Secret

Army Organization at "leadership seminars".

Team "marshalling points" should be selected in advance and be

well defined. Practice "alerts" will determine the team's efficiency

in response and security.

Terrain familiarity within the expected operational radius of the

team must be developed.

Weapons familiarity must be obtained throughlivefirings at various

targets. Team action must be stressed as well as individual com-

petence.

The team leader should see that a constant flow of information is

provided to team member's on the ideological struggle. This will

help induce the proper frame of mind in each member.

1.

Team missions and targets must be identified and the proper train-

ing equipment made available for each assignment.

2. To resist and expose the spread of

3. To investigate by means of our own

6. To form in

8. To pursue these programs as privale

citizens motivated only by patriotism and to

remain entirely free of goverument subsidies

or control.

• The Secret demy Organization is a national rigga-

Lation of patriotic americans who are preparing then:

selves as a last line of defense agninst communism.

To

exemplify the necessity of such an organication, ve quole

the 1960 Annual Report of the Commitice on Us-Imerican

Activities as follo's:

"Events of the past yoar have provided convincing

evidence that the American people cannot rely completely

on this country's armed forces to protect themselves

from communist domination and slavery.

because our military forces lack the poiver or the will to

defend this country, but rather because the nature of the

attacks boing male on the United States by its major and

only significani cuemy are so designed as to render con-

ventional military forces

as ineffective as possible for

defense purposes. "

Starting from nothing 50 years ago, communism

now rigidly controls one-third of the human race and has

subverted to varsing degrees the remaining two-thirds.

In the past 20 years the communists have conquered 20

sovereign nations, one by armod conquest and 19 by in-

ternal subversion or negotiation.

There is not one of these countries in which the

communists rule by the consent of the people. Every-

there they must perpetuate themselves by terror.

They

remain in power only through the use of the most brutal

police state tactics.

The communists consider their party worsers

not simply as an accessory to armed conquest but as the

actual spearhead

of any invasion into new territory.

From this point of vies the United States was "invaded"

by Soviet troops more than 30 jears ago. It has been

authoritatively estimated that the communists now hare

an army of 500, 000 combatants already landed on Ameri-

can shores and already working by the most insidious

means to destroy our American way of life.

The cold war is very real. It must be fought and

won.

The oaly alternative is to lose and to lose nicans

that future Americans for generations to come must live

in terror and in slavery.

Appeasement is futile. He

cannot bargain with moral barbarians who never have and

never will know the meaning of honesty.

Communism must be defeated, not merely resist-

. ed. We must ridour country of traitors and fellow trave-

ler's. We must embark on a massive offensive turning

every communist trick - from propaganda to infiltration-

against our mortal enemy. This is the one and only way

to win the struggle for survival.

We are faced with a dangerous enemy who has repeatedly boasted of his

plans to destroy our Constitutional Republic and to enslave our people.

For more than fourty years they have been infiltrating their agents into

the most sensitive areas of labor, press, entertainment, education, law, com-

munications, religion, industry and government. The degree of their success

is made obvious by our government's failure to oppose communism internation-

ally and by our fellow citizens' lack of interest in their own preservation.

We already know a considerable amount about this enemy; their origin,

objectives, approximate strength, organizational structure and general meth-

ods of operation.

There are four areas where we especially. need additonal information:

I. Details of the techniques used in espionage, infiltration and subver-

sion by individual agents, including the methods by which they control their

fellow travelers.

2. The equipment used for surveillance, communication, assassination,

sabotage, etc., by individual enemy agents.

3. Working details of their short range programs either in operation or

planned for the near future.

4. The actual identity of enemy agents, fellow travelers and sympathi-

zers along with details regarding their work, place of residence, cover opera-

tion, means of transportation, travel pattern, personal appearance, mental

characteristics, personal lives, business and organizational activities.

Our ultimate victory or defeat may depend on our ability to obtain

• enough of this vitally important information.

There are literally thousands of sources from which bits of valuable in-

formation can be obtained. These range from such extremes as the local news-

paper's to documents stolen from the enemy's guarded vaults.

groups: 1) Research and Analysis, and 2) Espionage.

Espionage includes all the "illegal" means of obraining information, such

as wire-tapping, interception of mail, stealing of documents, secretly photo-

graphing records, infiltrating spies into enemy organizations, bribing or black~

mailing individuals of the enemy apparatus.

Research and Analysis includes the careful systematic search of all

newspapers, magazines, trade journals, house organs, political pamphlets,

books, public records, etc., to sift a few "needles" of valuable intelligence

from several "haystacks" of general information.

Professional intelligence organizations obtain about 95% of their infor-

mation from Research and Analysis and only about 5% from Espionage. When

espionage techniques are used, they prove most effective when a specific mis-

sion is carefully planned out in advance which takes advantage of all possible

background information that may be obtained by research methods.

Let's examine how these various techniques might be used to obtain

additional information of the four basic types we need most.

1. Details of the techniques used in espionage, infiltration and subver-

sion by individual agents including methods by which they control their fellow

traveiers.

An agent trainee may learn something of the general espionage methods

used by communist agents who have defected from the paxty and have then

written about their experiences. Beyond this they are of very little value. The

actual details of such techniques are uniformly neglected.

More useful information can be obtained from the study of past court

records in which evidence has been presented in espionage cases. Hints and

clues may occasionally be picked up from continuous and careful study of the

regular news media. Really basic information of this type, however, must be

obtained by infiltration and espionage techniques.

2. The equipment used for surveillance, communications, assassination,

sabotage, etc., by individual agents.

Hints about the type of hidden microphones, short wave transmitters,

miniture tape rocorders, etc. used in surveillance and communication by es-

pionage agents sometimes are mentioned by chance in the regular press or

news magazines, in connection with reported spy cases. Technical details and

construction plans occasionally are given in the electronics or "Popular Science"

type magazines. Other information may be requested directly from the manu-

facturers of such equipment.

CONITOENTTAT

The type of short acting or long acting poisons best suited for assassina-

tion under various conditions might be anticipated by a careful study of toxicol-

ogy; from "Chemical Abstracts" and Biological Abstracts"; from current maga-

zines on pharmacology, as well as from such magazines as "Scientific Monthly"

and "Science Newsletter", all available from larger city libraries.

Information on explosives is available from ordinance journals, litera-

ture from manufacturers, technical books, mining and drilling magazines, etc.

Naturally, such special fields of interest are best pursued by some per-

son who already has an aptitude in each particular line.

This is one of the things that makes us feel that the American people are

uniquely equipped to form a deadly effective underground. Nowhere else in the

world does any population have as many useful hobbies and avocations that could

be adapted to underground warfare. Many by products of these hobbies can be

• used as sabotage instruments. Just one typical example - the dust from grind-

ing wheels in metal shops should be saved to mix with grease for the bearings

of enemy machinery.

3. Working details of their immediate and future plans and activities.

Advance information about "peace marches and racial demonstrations

can be had by subscribing to appropriate communist front publications. Details

as to the size of the demonstration and degree of violence anticipated must be

obtained by infiltrating such organizations. Communist plans for future propa-

ganda campaigns, subversion,*

espionage, blackmail of government officials,

etc., may be learned directly by infiltration or may be deduced from a close

study of their past activities.

4. Identity and personal information about enemy agents.

This requires the full scope of counter espionage activity; research and

analysis of enemy publications, monitoring of communist sponsored meetings,

surveillance of party offices, infiltration of enemy apparatus, recruitment of

double agents,

interception of enemy communications, etc., etc.

TECHNIQUES OF EFFECTIVE RESEARCH

1. Every researcher should be constantly on the alert for useful infor-

mation in the general news media - radio, IV, magazines, etc.

2. Each researcher should have one field of interest to which he gives

special attention.

GONPIDENTIAT

For example:

One researcher might read every book available on "escape and evasion"

and all the stories or articles written on prison escayes, looking for ideas that

might someday help our members escape from a concentration camp.

Another researcher might continuously search the communist front

publications for names of fellow travelers; for announcements of future meet-

ings, rallies or similar activities; for additional information that would tie

suspected communists to known communist organization; for friendships, bus-

iness connections and family relationships between known communists and un-

known communists.

Each eity should have one researcher that carefully reads the daily

papers to extract such information as: names of speakers at left wing meet

ings, names and addresses of both left and right wing letters to the editor,

social functions attended by known communists, names of persons who might

be potential recruits, news of coming "peace marches" and similar demonstra-

tions, expressions of either pro or anti communist sentiments by local public

officials, educators, businessmen, ministers, etc., evidence of communist.

inspired violence, sabotage or blackmail.

There is an almost endless variety of areas that need to be covered.

Based on his or her own interests and abilities each researcher should choose

the specialty for which they are best qualified.

3. Be as specific as possible. Look for details. Include blue-prints,.

drawings or photographs of all technical equipment when possible. Don't ex-

pect your analyist to be a "mind reader". Include all the facts. Continuously

ask yourself the questions: Would this information be of value to the Secret

Army Organization? To individual espionage agents? To other members?

To our technical specialists?

1. Avoid editorial opinions and general news items as these are of

little value and needlessly swamp our limited staff of analyists.

5. Do all the work locally that you possibly can. If the person is local,

• look them up in the telephone book or cross index. Double check to make sure

the address is correct and that they still live there. Type cards if possible,

othervise; print plainly. Include phone numbers and licence numbers of cars

Whenever possible.

6. Use standard 3 x 5 inch index cards for sending in information on

individuals. Clip pages of magazines or photostat important articles. In

outlining books, be sure important facts are fully covered.

It is noted that BURTON has been described as a

"dangerous man" and "unstable"

who reportedly is armed at

all times. An informant stated that BURTON would not only

engage in violence but would probably provoke it.

JACK CONAN DOYLE, JR. has been described by

sources as a person likely to provoked into irresponsible

acts of violence and is not above using violence.

addition, the file reflects that DOYLE has a working

knowledge of explosives, particularly dynamite and has been

an amateur miner.

In January, 1966, he allegedly gave a

demonstration in the use and handling of dynamite, safety

fuse, primer cord and blasting caps at a local Minutemen

training session held in the Nevada desert near Las Vegas.

- History of the Secret Army Organization

One carly morning in Ichruary, 1970, a group of six Minutemen leaders from

four states met secretly in Northern Arizona to discuss the crisis that the arrest and

imprisonment of two top Minutemen leaders and the assassination of a third had

brought on the organization. Although some of these men had met before in their roles

as Minutemen group leaders, others were meeting for the first time.

After much discussion, two principal points were agreed upon. First, that the

Minutemen as a national coordination organization of militant right-wing groups had

effectively been destroyed by the pro-communist elements inside the Justice Depart-

ment. While individual units still existed throughout the country, few had the financial

support or leadership to be really effective. Second, that the need for such a coordi-

nating organization wasgreater than ever in view of the increased revolutionary activity

by communists in the United States.

With thesc two points in mind, suggestions were p'at forward on a course of

action to be followed. After ameeting that lasted all that day and far into the next

morning, an overall plan of action was finally agreed upon. All present agreed to

merge their individual units together and form a new organization under the command

of one leader elected from among themselves, with the other five to be members of a

General Staff that would advise and assist the new leader.

While retaining the basic programs and policies of the Minutemen, it was

• decided that not only should this new organization have a different name, but also a

completely new chain of command and organizational structure. If the new organiza-

tion was going to survive the attacks that befell the old one, a whole new approach

would be needed. Never again could the arrestor death of a few leaders be allowed to

cripple the entire organization.

For this reason it was decided that only a highly disciplined military type

orgainization with a definite chain of command would have any chance of success. This

then, was the beginning of the Secret Army Organization. Beginning with an original

force of hard corepatriots that numbered lewer than two hundred, the Secret Army

Organization began thejob of picking up the pieces and continuing to fight for national

and individual

feedom. Using this

cadre of dedicated personnel as a nucleus, the

S. A. O. has been recruiting and training new members in the skills they will need as

the freedom fighters of tomorrow.

The leaders of the S. A. O. have no idea of fighting a last ditch stand. We have

no desire to commit suicide ourselves or to let our members do so. We have a •

strategy which we believe will ultimately lead to viclory. Only one thing is essential.

We must start preparing and training NOW! We of the S. A. O. bclieve that our country

is worthy of any sacrifice. If you fecl the same way, we invile you lo join us.

pective Members Of The

SECRET ARMY ORGANIZATION:

CON

The Secret Army Organization is the most active, most completely dedicated and

most selective in its membership of all the many patriotic organizations in America.

We are willing to make any sacrifice for our country and we fully expect that some of

us will have to make the ultimate sacrifice before victory is achieved. Our very lives

depend on each other. There is no place in this organization for bunglers, playboys or

lukewarm conservatives. If you join the Secret Army Organization, there might easily

come a time that your life would depend on how competently some other member had

learned his job:

Unless you are especially well informed on the domestic and world political

situation, it is probable that you have a lot to learn about the present threat our nation

faces. Unless you have had many years experience in actual underground warfare,

there is undoubtedly a lot you can learn from the experts in our organization who have

developed and supervised our training program.

OUR NATION IS IN IMMEDIATE DANGER

It is possible that within a very few years, perhaps even within months, our

nation could be conquered and enslaved by the communists. To prevent this we must

know as much as possible about our enemies. Unless we know who they are and what

they are doing we will not succeed in our efforts to maintain a free America.

THE RESISTANCE MOVEMENT

In driving an invader from your land the resistance involved goes through three

stages of development.

1) The Underground Network

2) Active Guerrilla Warfare

3) Open or Conventional Warfare

The conventional warfare stage uses everything in the way of weapons that the

enemy does but must also have activeguerrillas and underground agents working against

the enemy, too. In the present state of military tactics conventional warfare cannot

succeed unless these other two ingredients are used simultancously.

The first step is to form an underground network. An active guerrilla system

must have the support of an underground network of approximately three times its own

size. This underground must supply the active guerrilla fighter with supplies, con-

cealment, information, etc. An underground network starts with departments of

intelligence, security and propaganda in that order.

Sabotage, espionage, subversion, infiltration, escape and evasion, training,

clandestine fabrication of supplies, counterfeiting enemy documents; recruiting, com-

munications and propaganda are other phases of underground activity. Each member

of the Secret Army Organization, lo be offéctive, must have a working knowledge of

all these tactics as well as the military tactics more commonly associated with guerril-

la activities.

ASSIGNMENT TO UNITS

G0)

Many people that inquire about membership in the Secret Army Organization

seem to have an idea that they will be immediately accepted into an active unit.

Look at it this way. Suppose you had spent a year or more carefully recruiting and

training until you had a hard hitting team where every individual was reliable, dedi-

cated, and had confidence in his fellow unit members. Wouldn't it make you mad to

have the national or regional organization assign some rank amateur to your unit

that you you knew little or nothing about?

Before any new member is assigned to an active unit or to an important under-

ground project, he mastundergo a period of training. During this training he will be

directed through the mails by an experienced member and some of his activities may

be observed by other members without his knowiedge. Only when a new ember

proves himself to be conscientious, trustworthy, self-disciplined and able to operate

effectively alone will he bo accepted'as a "secure member" and invited to participate

with other unit members in a teamwork operation.

• EXPENSES •

Unfortunately, most good things don't come cheap. Although we make every.

effort to keep down the expense of membership in the Secret Army Organization, you

must expect to pay your own way.

Dues to the Secret Army Organization are $3. 00 per month.

This money is

absolutely necessary for use to maintain our central files and headquarters, for

postage and printing, to finance our extensive intelligence network, and to maintain

training areas.

Each member will have other expenses depending on the type of activity he is

engaged in. Every member will be expected to buy his own gun, amnunition and

other basic combat equipment. During training the new member may be expected to

• buy certain books or subscribe to certain magazines that his work requires. During

this time the new member will also be supplied with reading material on the strategy

and tactics of guerrilla warfare. This

home work will make it possible for him to

fit in quickly to an active unit and participate effectively in actual maneuvers,

marksmanship training, etc.

Following this preliminary training a member may be either assigned to an

existing unit, assisted in organizing his own unit if he has shown sufficient leadership

qualities or become part of an underground network.

Upon your acceptance into the Secret Army Organization you will be given a

definite series of projects described in writing so you will know exactly what will be

expected of you.

We hope that you can succeed in this effort because your country desperately

needs patriots at this time.
