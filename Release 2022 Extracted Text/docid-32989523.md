\ + Items found in the possession of WINKLER,
| at the time of his arrest, and in the subsequent

i believe that WINKLER was in fact, the SAO.

ES The above information is set forth in
: Milwaukee letter and LUM, dated November 25, 1974,
captioned “SA0," :

Milwaukee had never developed any positive
link between MANDELL and the SAO, and in view of the
literature found in the possession of WINKLER,
Milwaukee felt no further investigation was warranted
regarding MANDELL.

On January 3, 1975, Detective ALBERT ROEHLING,
Madison, Wisconsin Police Department, advised that
on Cctober 31, 1974, bs ER had been committed to
the University of Wisconsin Hospital, Madison,
Wisconsin, for psychiatric examination, and has since
been found competent to stand trial for the above
charges,

He was subsequently released to ‘the custody
of his parents, Mr. & Mrs. EDWARD WINKLER, Watertown,
Wisconsin, pending trial.

i‘ ROEHLING stated that the literature found
in the possession of WINKLER, and in his room, which
was not needed in court, had been turned over to his
parents. He has no idea as to what the final
disposition his parents had made of the literature.

Milwaukee will report WINKLER's prosecution

comparison of Winkler's handwritig in the notebook _
-recovered from him at the time of original detention
with the materials accumulated over the period of

the past year that there can be deduced a strong

opinion that Winkler is, in fact, the SAO in Madison, -
Roehling fuxther stated that it appears that Winkler
operated as a lone individual as they cannot locate

any individuals with whom he has associated. Roehling
further advised that when Winkler was arrested, contained
in his wallet was a membership card for the National

SECRET ARMY ORGANIZATION

For background purposes, a typewritten letter, un-
dated, signed "Secret Army Organization" (SAO) was sent to
the "Wisconsin State Journal,” a Madison, Wisconsin daily
newspaper, with the envelope bearing the postmark, "U. S.
Postal Service - Watertown, WI - 9/17/73." The’ letter stated
that action would begin in Madison against anti-American and
anti-white organizations on September 17, 1973. The letter
targeted Mayor Paul R.”Soglin; Mel. Cohen; and the Wisconsin
Alliance, a small local political party. The Madison Police
Department has been conducting investigation in connection
with this letter but with negative results. The letter was
submitted to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)
Laboratory which identified the lettering as coming from
either a Smith Corona typewriter or R. C. Allen standard
typewriter.

Investigation at Watertown, Wisconsin, has been
negative’in identifying any individuals connected with any
type of organization known as SAO. ROBERT Lew ITE, a for-
mer mayor, and DELYIN~HINTZMANN, operator of the Watertown
Cab Company and who loys many young persons as drivers,
were unable to furnish any positive information concerni
the activity of individuals who. may have attempted to xm
& an organization similar to SAO. Reviews of the “Watertown,

: Daily Times," a local newspaper, did not reveai the identi-
ties of any individuals or organizations that couid be con-
sidered connected with SAO. Records of the Watertown Police
Department failed to disclose arrest or complaints or eny
other information of any individuals who could be connected
to the SAO.

Ga March 5, 1974, the Madison Police Department
received five typewritten Letters from the circulation mana~-
ger of the "Badger Herald," a student newspaper, University
of Wisconsin (UW) - Madison, that were left on the news
racks at the Student Memorial Union, UW - Madison. These
letters were addressed to five advertisers whose advertise-
ments appeared in "Takeover," a Madison underground news-
paver. These letters were signed SAO, They advised that
this was a warning against them. The letters stated that
the latest issue of "Takeover" lavished praise on the
Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA) and has endorsed Marxist
| terror. The letter stated that there would be a boycott

by advertisers and that the addressees have no choice in

taking part. The letters warned that if advertisers failed
i to remove all of their advertising from the next issue of
"Takeover, ' SAO would be left with no choice but to take
sane action to insure that advertisements would never be placed
; again. The letters warned that the advertisers had until
pos the next issue to decide. The letters concluded that this

was the first and only warning to be sent and that their
futures in business depended on the advertisers’ actions
now. The advertisers receiving these letters were the
Capitol and Majestic Theaters; Mid-Nest Hi-Fi; Cunique
Billiards; and the Focal Point Co-op. The Madison Police
Department is submitting these letters and envelopes to
the FBI Laboratory for comparison examinations with the
first letter received.

Inspector Reynolds also mentioned that his
department currently has under consideration an application
for the position of police officer from a Steve Alderman,

a former Marine trained in demolitions. This application
is still in the srocess of being considered but Reynolds
is possibly going to recomnend non-accsptance due to the
juvenile record on file with the department for Alderman.
This record concerns many complaints of Alderman making
pipe bombs. 5

Heibel has also developed information that an Aloise
E. Muellex, Watertown, Wisconsin, could also be considered

as a suspect. Mueller is the forrer Executive Secretary

of Local 695, Teamsters, Madison. Mueller has a reputation
of being very anti-liberal and is very upset with the

eurrent political leans of the officers of Local 695.

It is veported that Mneller is currently carrying a

firearm.

HPD is continuing their investigation at the

“Mr. Godfrey has admitted these felonies yet he is free. H

Memorandum ~- vac
June 22, 1973

‘this Federal employee willingly and wantonly violated the

laws of this State. He knew what he was doing. Had he advised

the local police of the Tharp shooting, the Guild Theater would

never have been bombed. Had he not permitted Godfrey to

- possess illegal explosives in his home, the Guild Theeter would

never have been bombed. Without Mr. Christiansen there would

never have been any number of crimes committed in this community.

For the best of all possible motives, he too vossessed a
re Watergate mentality and justified everything on the basis of
the results. To him, apparently, the “result justifies the
means." Regardless of how much lawbreaking there was.
is not the District Attorney of this County seeking an
against Mr. Christiansen? Does Mr. Christiansen claim "ex
immunity" as did the Watergate conspirators? Was Pea
government justified in this sort of illegality and immora
how? The only possibility is that we citizens of this County
and of this National must accept immoral and illegal acts on
the part of our civil servants, just ed because they act on
a higher morality than we near mortals. Or, aiternatively, we
may pose the question: How deeply was the United States involved
in the Godfrey-Christiansen conspiracy? Did Godfrey have
permission from the Federal Bureau of Investigation to violate
the law? Was the Secret Army Oxganization re vy an arm of the
F.B.I? Was it used by the F.B.I to do acts the FB.I. itself could
not do? Please -- Mr. Richardson -- answer the question.

I information relating to the attached article concerning the SAQ and
Howard Barry Godfrey, former FBI informant, which appeared in the
6/24/73 edition of "The New york Times."' The article alleges the
SAO was partly organized and financed by Godfrey and that while beir

and burglaries. It sets forth information indicating Donald 4.
Segretti had been in the company of SAO members during the Summer oi
1971 and discussed kidnaping "radicals" who might disrupt the

\ Republican National Convention, ee

The SAO was formed in San Diego, California, in 1971 by

Jerry Lynn Davis as an anticommunist, paramilitary group to replace
the white extremist Minutemén. Godfrey, an FBI informant since 196;
was targeted to penetrate the SAO and subsequently became a leader ¢]

A to become directly involved in violent confrontations or activities |
We have no information in our files indicating his active participa
tion in fire bombings, burglaries, or violent actions by SAO.

Specifically, we have no information relative to burglaries at “The

Re: Secret Army Organization (SAO) i
157-23577

’
SAO member who fired shots into the home of a local college professor
active in planning demonstrations at the Republican National Conventior
The shots resulted in the wounding of Tharp. Godfrey, in ganuary, 1972
advised SA Steven L. Christensen of the shooting and gave him the gun
used. Christensen retained this weapon without advising the Bureau of
its existence. on 7/5/72, after Godfrey was turned over to the

San Diego Police Department in order to obtain prosecution of several
SAO members, the existence of the gun was learned and it was recovered.
SA Christensen, on 7/6/72, after acknowledging receipt of the gun,
submitted his resignation.

Investigation of the SAO and testimony by former informant
Godfrey, Christensen and Special Agents of our San Diego Office during
local prosecution of SAO members, were coordinated with the office of
Legal Counsel and Kevin T. Maroney, Deputy Assistant Attorney General,
Internal security Division.

By memorandum from C, L, Me Gowan to Mr. R. E. Gebhardt, dat:
6/15/73, captioned "Donald Henry Segretti," you were furnished informa-
tion indicating the "San Diego Door," an underground publication, made
inquiry of former SA Christensen regarding attempts by Segretti to
recruit the SAO to work for reelection of the President and that Davis
former SAO leader, stated he had no information regarding alleged
recruitment. ;
}

San Diego is being instructed to promptly furnish any infor-
mation indicating statements in the article regarding Godfrey's actuai
involvement in illegal activities may be true.

I. ORGANIZATION STRUCTURE

On October 8, 1972, JERRY LYNN DAVIS, leader of
the Secret Army Organization (SAO) who is generally known
as SAM DAVIS, advised that the SAO is now "dead" as far as

* San Diego is concerned.

(SD T-1, October 8, 1972)

During late October, 1972, JERRY LYNN DAVIS stated
that because of court proceedings against SAO members in
San Diego, California, the SAO has become a defunct
organization. A small pocket of SAO members continue to
exist in Los Angeles, California, and two members remain
| in the Seattle, Washington, area. The unaffected elements
| may possibly band together but under a different label.

(SD T-1, October 27, 1972)

On January 16, 1973, JERRY LYNN DAVIS was interviewed
by Special Agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)
at San Diego, California. He advised that the SAO is now
no longer active because of the arrests of members in San
Diego and because of the demoralizing effect of learning
that HOWARD BARRY GODFREY was reporting to the FBI concerning
the activities of the SAO and its members. He said San Diego
had been the headquarters of the SAO. Both the National
Headquarters and the San Diego Unit of the SAO have ceased

. to exist. The only remaining group of SAO members might
. possibly be a small group operating independently in —
Los Angeles, California, under a leader who DAVIS would
not identify.

DAVIS said he is completely disenchanted with
yvight-wing activity and will no longer participate in such
activity. He intends to cooperate fully with law enforcement
agencies. He complained that when he was arrested recently,
only one or two of his “right-wing friends" stood by him.

He intends to move out of the State of.California and live
_in Mississippi where he has relatives.

surveillance has ended. He said he has. decided to bomb "Genies
Massage Parlor", El Cajon, Califorria, on the evening of
June 23, 1972. He asked his neighbor, HOWARD GODFREY, to

this bombing because of the surveillance on his home.

(HOWARD BARRY GODFREY,
June 23,,1972)

On June 25, 1972, YAKOPEC advised that because of
the continuing surveillance he had decided to conceal some
explosives he had in his residence under a pile of scrap
lumber located in a vacant lot behind his residence. He
then left for Los Angeles, California, where he was to
leave his wife with relatives.

The explosives consisted of one 2 1/4 pound block
of C-4 military plastic explosive; two one pound canisters of
Du Pont HPD primer charges; about 30 electric caps ina

out" by the police and that officers surveilling his,
YAKOPEC's, home had been advised that he is a psychopath.

On “September 25, 1972, San Diego County Superior

JESSIE CLAYBURN STEVENS, who operated the Minutemen
Organization there, had formed an alliance with the SAO.

not known to be active in that area.

AT LAS VEGAS, NEVADA

AT PHOENIX, ARIZONA

The state coordinator of SAO activity at Phoenix,
Arizona, has been instructed to include the State of New
Mexico in recruiting efforts for the SAO.

(SD T-1, May 10, 1972)

In Arizona the SAO has mailed a considerable
amount of literature pertaining to the SAO to "conservative"
thinking people, but has not at this time received response
from the type of people they wish to affiliate. Consequently,
no formal chapter or nucleus around which to organize hes
been formed in Arizona. However, a coordinator has been
named and is operating. Not all former Minutemen will be
accepted into the SAO.

The SAO foresees a decentralized type of operation
in each state, where in a revolutionary situation brought
about by treasonous communist elements, the SAO could
present a militant front immediately. Recent bulletin
material from SAO Headquarters in San Diego has introduced
the thought that "the basic battle facing our country
today is the one between individualism and collectivism.

In its political form it appears as personal freedom versus
police-state regimentation.....In times of emergency, our
members are not going to depend on General Headquarters

for training material, bulletins and printed propaganda
items. Local units and often the lone individual will

have to improvise all these things. Communications to

and from higher commands may be uncertain and the transmission
of organization orders may be slow. We must have people
who think for themselves. Equally important, we must

have people who can see what needs to be done and. get at

it without being told."

that there has never been any SAO unit or activity in
Sacramento, California.

AT SEATTLE, WASHINGTON

During June and August, 1972, sources in Seattle,
Washington, advised that no known SAO activity had occurred
in that area.

Iv. FINANCES

The SAO has received $300 to $400 in donations,
membership applications fees and monthly dues. Most of
this money has been spent on printing costs and postage.

(HOWARD BARRY GODFREY,
March 8, 1972)

The SAO intends to use the following breakdown
of money contributed to units of the SAO outside of
San Diego.

Dues $3.00 per month, $2.00 kept by the receiving
unit and $1.00 to be forwarded to headquarters at San Diego.

Membership $5.00, $3.00 to be retained and $2.00
to be sent to headquarters.

Contributions of members sent in to the unit
accompanying report forms, half to be kept by the unit and
-half to be forwarded to headquarters.

Any other contribution is retained by the unit
receiving it.

At (SD T-1, March 21, 1972)
The SAO has a policy of retaining sufficient funds

in the hands of the various unit coordinators to allow them
to operate as independent organizations. The only expenses

The use of dead dreps in communications with members has several advantages over per-

1. Dead drop communications are safer as there is no direct contuct between officer
and member, .
.

2. They are more secure, because the member need nol know the officer with whom
ke is in contact via the dead drop. si

8, When necessary, it is possible to replace or substitute one officer with another,

. There is the possibility of wide Mexibility in tima.
The use ef deed drops, however, is not without drawbacks, The dead drop is ax

In communications through a dead drop the member reecives his assignments in
written form. Tnese member assignments must be encoded or enciphered. Also, the
materia itself must be ina form suitable for passing through a dead drop. Therefore
we must train the underground member in the use of ciphers, codes, the preparation
of soft emulsion film, jmicrodot, and secret writing, : .

HOTE:

The TRC is an organization ostensibly designed to challenge
taxation and embaryass the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Limited
investigation to date suggests the possible involvement or influence
of the extremist SAO, Minutemen organization, and a group calling
itself National Association to Keep and Bear Arms on the TRC and/or ©
its membership. Gillings, 41-year-old male Caucasian who operates
a service station in Tracy, California, has been involved with the
TRC and has stated the country is on the verge of collapse and some
people in the movement were planning to assassinate the President,
Vice President, and others of "leftist tendencies." Gillings is also
being investigated in a Threat Against the President matter. Liaison
being maintained with Secret Service and IRS.

NOTE:

: Calvin Hendell Fox in May, 1972, was identified by former
Bureau informant Howard Barry Godfrey as one of the most rabid and
violent new members of the paramilitary, ultraconservative, anti-

attempted assassination of Presidential candidate George Wallace, Fox
indicated he was going to Washington, D. C., to.do some demonstrating
of his ow Investigation to develop background information and the
license rv of Fox's automobile. resulted in SA Arthur J. Hocper

and former SA Steven L. Christensen making inquiry at Fox's service
station where an employee of: Fox's lookea through Fox's file cabinet
.in a futile attempt to find the license number of Fox's automobile.

Report by (lSUseyt ae = 1, 1975

SUBJECT: Ron Eddy, George Mitchel] Hoover. : i

It has been ascertained that at this time Ron Eddy of Poway
js not interested in trying to form or lead any type of security force
for any right-wing extremist group. When asked by James K. Warner
of Los Angeles (via Dennis Loso of Escondido) if he would do this,
Eddy stated that he would like to see the formation of a Security
Force with teeth in it but does not consider himself to be enough
of a leader to do it himself.

While declining to lead a Security Force, Baay did say that —
the only way to stop FBI infiltration of rightist groups would be
for one of the infiltrators to "wind up in the river" someday. waay
is positive that Tom Knight's San Diego unit of the Nazi Party has
a regular FBI infiltrator. The only *hree men of whom he is not eus~
picious are Mickey Wakefield, Ray Wilson and Gerald Smith. Said Ba ay,
"Those three men dropped ont of the thing and so I figure they're okay
but you can bet that the fink is “still in there ‘pushing".

Toso said that the.whereabouts of people like ‘Barry Godfrey
should be learned and they should be telephoned and intimidated.
Eady said he thinks such intimidations would be a waste of time and
that people like Godfrey should be killed. - ‘Mickey Wakefield of Saa
Marcos went along with iddy's. suggestion. Ron Eady also menticned
having had an encounter with an EBI agent named Peterson in San Diego”
but did not elaborate. : 7

Eddy firmly believes that any man who ee to one’
oxganization in the Far Right should not be involved with others.
He says he would be very suspicious of anyone who ‘is. He is also
gomewhat suspicious of Tom Knight. He says that Joe Brinker gave
Knight the name of a man interested in Nazism and two weeks later
the FBI interviewed the man. Also, Eddy wonders how Fnight saved
his federal job in the face of his continued Nazi activities. Eady
feels that any regular rightist extremist who stays on with the Kazi

| Party now must warrant heavy suspicion of being an FBI informant.

-On Friday night, January 31, 1975 Ron Hay met Tom Metzger of
Pallbrook for the first time. Metzger showed Zidy some pictures and
slides of New Christian Crusade activities and the two seemed to hit
it off pretty well. Metager told Eddy, Wakefield and Loso of a visit
he received at his home on January 17, 1975 from agents of the Internal -

7 7 : “Page 2 cf
. George Mitchell Hoover
Here is one last bit of information, The New Christian Crusade
people are very concerned about the imprisonment of George Hoover of
the Secret Army Organization. At one of their banquets the NCC had

four unoccupied places set at the table which were in honor of four

men whom they hold to be absent heroes, These four men were Joe Near *

George Hoover, Charles Lindbergh and a man named R. Miles.

: Anyway, it has been learned that a man whom Tom Metzger knows
is going to take a dossier of the Hoover case to some congressman
in Washington, D.C. who is part of a committee currently scheduled

- to investigate the FBI. The dossier consists of newspaper clippings
and other material pertaining to Hoover's activities in the SAO, his
arrest, conviction, appeal, etc. They are hoping to stir up a big
publicity stink to give the FBI a bad name due to Barry Godfrey's
activities and in so doing hope to effect an eventual release of Hoove:
from prison. By the way, the HCC people do not refer to Hoover by.
his correct name. For some reason they all call him Mickey Hoover.

‘That is about all for now. “I hope this will be of some help

to you, ;

7 SUBJECTS: NCC picke ‘ oorder; thoughts on NCC; Wer 9. ounds.

Here is some more “information regarding the National Christian Crusade, picket
which took place at the U.S.-Mexico border in San Ysidro on December 6, 1974. Cf

the 16 men who took part in this uniformed picket, 10 were fron the San Diego area

and 6 were from Los «ngeles, It was mistakenly stated in yesterday's report on t:

. demonstration that 10 of the men were identified. In reality, 11 were fully igen
4 partially identified, and 4 unidentified. The 4 unidentified were all from Low.

Also, the members of this picket were divided into two contingents, los angeles

$3]

and San Diego. Commanding the San Diego group was Tom Metzger of Fallbrook end ij
charge of the L.A. men was Rick Norton, Also, Norton was in overall command of the

operation.

Iwo other things which were not mentioned in the earlier report are as follows.

First, Norton told his men that if attacked, they shoul form into a back to back

square and "let her rip", Also, after the conclusion of the dexonstretion, Norton

conducted 2 very brief prayer.

"hs to my thoughts on the NOC, I feel that this group has the potentiel to q

comnand much more support from a broader base of people than most of ‘the right-

extremist groups. Te seems significant to this informant that men like Vie “alton 5
and Bill Miller would actually get up the nerve to take to the streets in uniform,
a thing they never did for the Nazi Party although both supported it.

Tt is also noteworthy that the NCC was able to draw supporters from so many

other extremist groups. Taking part in this denonstretion were elements fron the

Nazi Party, the Tax Rebellion Committee, the: Netional States Rights Party, the Ministr.

! of Christ Church and the old Secret Army Organization.

Also, this group does not automatically get adverse responses from the public 5
dn the streets. Indeed, many passersby indicated their support ‘for the group's ains ‘

_ dn the demonstration of the Eth. The leadership is nore intelligent and more

. approachable than that of groups like the NSWPP or MCC, They more easily

a good rapport with the public in general and are not so blunt in stating +t

ROT: Posse Comitatus.

During the last two years this informant has spent a great deal

lime studying the tactics, personalities and stated goals of both

Hational Socialist White People's Farty and the Ministry of Christ

toh. Until recently I considered the NSWPP tc be more of a threat

he security of peace and law in the United States than the MCC but

events of recent months have caused me to change my view of these

groups about 180 degrees. TI now regard the HCC to be a far greater

kce than the NSWPP is likely ever to become.

_@he main reason for my change of relative attitudes toward these

groups has been the increased preoccupation of certain ECC members

: Posse Comitatus,. Also known as the Christian Posse Association,

organization serves as the paramilitary arm of the MCC, The goais

hts most ardent activists seem to be very similar to those of the

ka but their tactics are quite different. Instead of Wrapping them-

ves in the Swastika, they uphold the Christian Cross as their symbol.

ike the head-on street clashes which many of the Nazis seem to reli Ay

bers of Posse Comitatus ‘generally tend to prefer being sécretive and

ndestine in their opexations. ‘They generally seem to’ fancy themselve

be revolutionaries and as fanatical as some of them appear, I believe

potential exists for the Posse to become a truly revolutionary group.
Dennis Loso was at one time a major financial supporter of the

PP, He has renounced >» since 1972 but not because of its

ses but only because he considers it to be ineffective. He is now

edicated eupportcr of the MCC and its national leader, William Cele.

» almost never misses an KCC meeting in San Diego, frequently visits

Glendale meetings of HCC, and more recently attended the NCC sem

Wanassa ‘Ranch in Mariposa. If Loso is not already an officer within

se Comitatus, then the potential certainly exists for him to become

« Toso is also an admirer of Jack Fredericks and was just elected to

San Diego County Central Comittee of the American Independent Party.
Welt Kendall, another ex-Nazi supporter who has turned to the KOC,

also a potential activist for Posse Comitatus. Kendall attends perhaps

+ of Gale's meetings in San Diego and is definitely not bothered by

‘prospect of using violence to attain political goals. He once sug-

Sed that Sheriff John Duffy of San Diego County should be assassinated.
Jerry Busch, a.k.a. Mark Roberts, is-another man to watch. He

utetde the realm of oe correspondence, Two-way radio contact
ems to be his favorite. Busch once stated his desire to murder Deputy
fatrict Attorney Hewicker of San Diego. Busch is very suspicious
Hd paranoid of everyone... : :

Sian McDade, former Secret Army Organisation affilicte, is definitel; |

i: the Posse Comitatus picture. He occasionally attends MCC meetiags *

San Diego. A friend of George Hoover, McDade made a feeble write-in
pmpaign for sheriff against John Duffy bus it never amounted to much.
: ncepived came from affiliates of the Posse,

Brinker are almost sure to be members of Posse
supporters of the MCC, they never miss a mecting

and have often a€riven long distances across count
ins n such events. Harriet is definitely the brains

ims

in spite of their very radical political stance, however,

his informant does not consider either one of them to be capable of a
remeditated act of violence. :

George Metzger seems to be very. deeply involved in Posse Comitatus.
p is an organizer, a "take charge" man and a pretty good speaker both.
i-private and before groups. He is not dyn c but speaks carefully, |
Hliberately and with en air of sincerity and believability. Certainly
‘s actions shou ieee

1d be observed, : :

Joe Reedy is a close associate of Metzger. He seldom has much to |
“y and appears merely to be a faithful follower who would be willing i
go along with whatever the others decide. j

Bill Miller is very closely tied with the NCC and has been for a
mg time. However, he is definitcly not the violent type. He tapes
‘ery one of Gale's sermons and-never misses a meeting. Gerald Smith
eked Miller ont.of the NSYPP because he considered him to be cowardly .
i more interested in promoting the MCC than the NSYWPP.

Ron Eddy is a men who owes allegiance to no particular group or
ader but who could very likely become involved in a group like Posse {

imitatus. He has been a long time supporter, if a sporadic one, of

vc USWUPP, At one time Eddy was a Gale follower but he has had nothing
1 do with the LCC since 1972 because he now considers Gale to be a phony. |
am sure that Eddy would have no scruples at all about assassinition
“he thought the chances of getting away with it to bé feasible. He

Eddy stated, however, that he is very distrustful of anyone whom
he has not knovm for a very long time and would definitely do some ex
give ches! a person's background before trusting’him as a con-
federate in any terrorist activity. Eddy seems to enjoy violence but

he. is also a clever, intelligent man and should never be underesti :
I regard him as being one of the most dangerous people named in this

report even though I do not believe him to be a member of Posse Comitat

as yet. He : . : .. Pasa
Vic Walton is another figure who is likely to have a hand in the
organization of Posse Comitatus’ in San Diego County. Tais attorney,
in this informant's opinion, presents no threat of physical violence
whatever but he serves as a sort of liaison man. between the various
right-wing extremist groups in the Southern California area, He is
intelligent and seems to be fairly well off financially. Through hin
many others can be reached ag Walton has been involved with people in
the NSWPP,. the’ ECC, *% . SAO, -Comparet's group and “virtually any other

>

extremist outfit in the right-wing

ich one might think of in this
TI hope this report will give you some idea as to the current

of Posse Comitatus in San Diego County. At least I believe it to be a
fairly accurate description of some of the prime-movers of Posse Comit:
as of the present. Due to the more underground nature of this group,
it is more difficult to keep tabs on than is the openly Nasi Party.
However, as this organizational arm of the MCC makes the attempt to
establish itself as a force to be reckoned with and to consolidate
whatever power it might gain, certain characteristics of it are bound
to surface and become more clear. This informant will do his best to
“learn as much about this emerging group as quickly as possible and to
relay the information to you as accurately as can be done. One thing
seems to be very certain and that is that San Diego County seems to be

en-

extremely fertile soil for the flourishing of a group like Posse Conitatn.,

That is all for now.

Report by ineeamant Ws “
Meeting of Colonel WILLIAN GALE at

O'Neixra Hall on the Evening of :
March 28, 1974, San Diego, California

Approximately 75 persons were present at that
meeting. It included, among others, GEORGE UDVARY,
VICTOR B. WALTON, MICKEY WAKEFIELD, J. ANDREW SIMPSON,
ELLEN ADAMS, BILL MILLER, JONATHAN WEST, JOE BRINKER,
HARRIET BRINKER, JANET BRINKER, Colonel WILLIAM GALE, ANN
NUITER, and others who are very old and very inactive.
There were a number of individuals present who are as yet
unknown to me. ;
GEORGE UDVARY does not seem to have made his
fove yet--permanent move out of the area. He's still in
process, I believe, as best I can tell at ‘this time. MICKEY
WAKEFIELD came down from Escondido, was hoping to run
into some of his para~military friends, one or two of whom
did not evidently arrive. He did mm into VICTOR WALTON
who he’ is close to. BILL MILLER was there and very involved--
on the surface at least.- ELLEN ADAMS was distributing
literature. JOE and HARRIET BRINKER came in from Escondido

and of course are primarily responsible for putting on that ;

monthly meeting and so they were working with that.

There was security that night+-more so than

would ordinarily be expected. A fellow by the name of

“DENNIS was inside with a 23-channel, fiv-watt Citizens Band

walkie-talkie, Realistic brand, sold by Radio Shack. He
kept monitoring ‘mother individual whose name I do not have

who was outside. He had a two or three channel ‘Citizens
Band walkie-talkie, Midland brand, and they were checking i
"|. to see if anyone would give them any trouble. This was
because of a publication that ‘indicated where their meeting
would be held. They didn't indicate what they would do if.

such trouble arrived.

Colonel CALE discussed an article on himself and :

“4 the identity movement as written up in Volume V, Issue 14,

of a bi-monthly publication, called the San Diego Door.

a believe that's a March, 1974 issue. Colonel GALE read

directly from the article and made comments and corrections

‘as he went. : ne fe |
’ He said, now I will read-~follow this and read as

much as possible that seems relevant. He read from*the

article: "But the public meetings are only- part of the

+ package. Whenever GALE speaks, he recruits followers into

the para-military part of his organization. That part is

called ‘Identity’ and has so far incorporated many old
Minutemen and secret army elements in Southern Califomia."
To that, Colonel GALE indicated that “Identity”

_ was the name of his church publication--he thought it was

NW 68262 Docld:32989523 Page 251



de

very humorous. that they thought “it was something else.
The term is used to describe their philosophy.

The para-military part of their operation is under
such titles as the "Christian Posse Association."

I will make another quote here from the publication:
"JERRY LYNN DAVIS, the ex-head of the SAO in California,
1

has been reported at GALE's public meetings." According

. to NICKEY WAKEFIELD who .was sitting next to me during this

meeting, DAVIS had not, as far as he knew, ever been to a
San Diego meeting. ;

Another quote Colonel GALE made: "Identity is

organized in similar fashion to other underground organizations--

small cells communicate through a series of intermediaries
and blind post office boxes." Golonel GALE did not comment
further; however, the ‘mailing network for the rational tape
groups, the Christian Posse Association groups, and the |
amateur radio network are the pimary communication links
of GALE's group. oe

. another quote Colonel GALE made from the article:

"In San Diego, GALE can be heard speaking to his congregation.

on the fourth Thursday of every month at the O'Neira Club
on Holly Street" or something of that nature "between 34th
and 35th Streets, one block south of Adams Avenue." The
street was incorrectly quoted-~it!s Hawley, and Colonel

GALE made an observation on that, indicating he thought

_NW 68262 Docld:32989523 Page 252)

_the information was transferred to the person at this publication



;
i

” NW_68262_Docld:32989523 Page 253

Q-
e

by telephone and that he figured, he had that all figured

out that way because the person must have misunderstood

the name and got it wrong.

The next quote from the publication: “According

to one law enforcement source, Identity has about 50 members

in the San Diego area, including members of the San. Diego
Sheriff's Department and reserve police officers."' Colonel
GALE indicated support from and for law enforcement-~indicated
he has an assistant pastor in Glendale who has an important
position in the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Office, and
that he claims support from a number of law enforcement
areas. : 7

Another quote he indicated: "As for GALE, he
pretends to be a minister of his church and operates through

it as his front. GALE was one of the driving forces behind

.the militant Christian Defense League (DL) in the 60° Se

He had formed the small California Rangers in the late 50's.
The California State Attorney General's Office described

" then they put a quote in hete, in this article,

the Rangers as,
a !A secret underground guerrilla force, linked with other
non-military organizations by a common ideology and leader-
ship.' " !

Colonel GALE indicated at ‘this meeting the Rangers
were registered with the state and had support of California
law enforcement. ; :

Another quote from the article that the Colonel



ON oy

made: ngats's Meatesy to recruit eres, Meee veterans
organizations was thwarted in 1963 when the Long Beach ‘Press
Telegram exposed his efforts to convert the American Legion.
Post in Signal Hill into a Ranger front. It was after this
that one of the Rangers was arrested for selling a machine

gun and a stem gun to undercover agents." Colonel GALE

indicated that he was involved to some extent with this

particular post, with this particular veterans group, that

he transferred from the Hollywood post. Also, he said that

the Ranger's, that particular Ranger's arrest, was’ an-

“entrapment and an unfortunate error on that Ranger's part.
Another quote he made: “The CDL was quite an

- organization when GALE was a part of it. rt ee to

include the Klan, the National States! Rights Party, and |

many other Right Wing groups.“ Colonel GALE admitted i

_ connection with the Christian Defense League, indicating

that he was very active.

émother quote: GALE has ample experience to
found a para-military organization. In addition to more

than 20 years involvement in right wing circles, GALE is

a retired Lieutenant Colonel, U. S. Army. He served with
the MAC ARTHUR command after World War.II in the counter-
+  dmsurgency staff," and it goes on. But Colonel GALE corrected i

this counter-insurgency information. He indicated that he

was on the staff of MAC ARTHUR in Japan, but previous to ~ '

Newt
that was when he was involved in counter~-IMsurgency and .
.that was with the guerrilla activities in the Philippines,
which was also indicated in this article.

; Then, another interesting thing, he quoted: "The
SAO was in large part organized by HOWARD B. GODFREY, an
“FBI Agent." He didn't have anything notable to say about
GODFREY. : aezreee ‘

Actually,” one of the ‘things he indicated, too,

in this discussion of a was that there is a lot of diffi-

culty getting different “right wing groups to coopexate in

a military saan and that that is very, necessary and I

get the impression that he is attempting and wishes to whip

these groups into line in a really efficient military manner
: that will be very effective and efficient. That is _the pee
aes problem. He also indicated his willingness to ‘cooperate

with law enforcement, of course on his terms no doubt; :
'. and he said he was ready and they were ready to face those
Jews and their articles and their so-called exposes and
whatever else they might happen to want to do; that they
are ready to communicate with their people and take care of
anyone who gives them any trouble. He indicated that he
had communication links all over-~that from his car he
could talk immediately with his link in Saugus--I don't
know what link he was referring to, but it was in Saugus,

and in Glendale and other areas like that, which he mentioned.

_ That covers much of his comments at that particu-
lar meeting. There was quite a lot of response--~the people
enjoyed that immensely. It was a reaction similar to a
-grandstanding and I think he was milking it for all he
could get.

_.There were some questions and answers during
this session, JOE BRINKER was passing out blank pieces
of paper so that people could write their comments and
questions ‘on the papers‘which were then passed up-to Colonel |
: GALE. Along with those blank pieces- of paper, JOE BRINKER
had a throw-away on the tax revolt. The heading was “Sunny
. San Diego Invites You to 1974's Biggest Tax Expo" and then
another heading, “Tax Foes Tell. Why and How They Stopped
Paying Income Fax," etc., etc, It talked about meetings in
the San Diego area on that. Registration forms for special
get-togethers, in this case, Sheraton Inn-Airport on
Friday, April 5th and Saturday, april 6th, 7 P.M. to LL P.™
on Friday, April 5th; 9 A.M. to 5 P.M. Saturday, April 6th.
For those who wish to write for information, they'd write to

(for registration or information) to Tax Expo, 1570 Lily et

was ‘being stressed more by JOE BRINKER or whether it was also

saad fated tacit approval of Colonel GALE, I do not know.



Among the other literature and material which was
picked up at that meeting, I acquired an application for
the Identity seminars, “Second ani Third National, Identity

THE STRANGE TALE OF

THE SECRET ARM

ORGANIZATIO

an Diego is a strange town, where the niceties of West-
ern civilization cannot hide the power of the buck
and the hint of brute force. It is the city built with
the largesse of twenty-five years of imperial sway: a
stronghold, a haven of anticommunism, a base for racke-
teers, Richard Nixon considered it his lucky city. He
wanted the Republican, Convention to be held there, and
though the city fathers and the people of San Diego were
not terribly enthusiastic, the plans went forward until May
1972, when the President abruptly changed his mind.

Included in these plans, it turns out, was a tumultuous,
massive, bloody riot~on such a seale as to justify the most
extraordinary preventive measures, including burglary, bug-
-ging, sabotage, and perhaps even kidnapping. Watergate, we
Tear from the likes of John W. Dean, was simply part of a
strategy to maintain domestic tranquility in the face of a
serious left-wing threat.

Presumably, this Red Menace existed in San Diego as
well as Miami. But San Diego has never been a radical
stronghold, and while local activists did undertake extensive
preparations for anti-war demonstrations during the GOP
convention, the Committee to Re-elect the President seems
to have had a far higher opinion of their organizing suc-
cesses than they themselves dared to entertain.

Unless, of course, CREEP and its local San Diego allies
were hell-bent on making certain that bedlam did in fact
occur. That is precisely what a defecting agent provocateur
named Lewis Tackwood suggested almost two years ago.
Tackwood told an incredible story back in- October and
November 1971, one which suggested the Republicans were
doing their utmost to turn San Diego into a bloodbath
during the convention, with the aim of annihilating the left,
smearing the Democrats, and coasting comfortably into
four more years of conservative rule. His allegations were
regarded as the ravings of a madman until testimony in the
Senate caucus room appeared to corroborate some of his
+ wildest stories. He told of preparations to seal off and then
* bomb 100,000 demonstrators attending a rock concert on

Fiesta [sland in Mission Bay, San Diego, All sorts of may-
hem was supposed to occur. Bombs were to be smuggled
into Convention Center in hollow furniture, which al-

G being built in Los Angeles. At least one major Repub-
lican official would perish in the melee. The Democratic
Party would be tied in to the events, discredited, possibly
outlawed. The Republica candidate would then win an
easy victory with the overwhelming support of an outraged
citizenry. Today, Tackwood sticks by his original story (to
be published in September by Avon as The Glasshouse
Tapes), though he now adds that the plan also called for
blowing up the podium as President Nixon was making his
acceptance speech! 7

{CIVIL WAR IN SAN DIEGO]

Ty neredible as the Tackwood scenario seemed back in
iE 1971, it sounded less outlandish to San Diego radicais
fi than to those on the outside. For two years, they had

quite literally been engaged in protracted warfare
with right-wingers determined to drive them out of the
area. As early as 1970, activists associated with the San
Diego Street Journal, an underground newspaper, were liv-
ing in an armed fortress which they guarded around the
clock against the attacks of night riders who would shoot
into their houses, firebomb their cars and threaten their
lives. (Curiously, this terror campaign intensified as the
paper exposed more and more illegal activities of San Diego
kingpin C. Arnholt Smith.) On one occasion. for example,
sentries spotted two men crouched behind a car with a
f°
but they were prepared for such emtergencies. Ata signal,
they switched-on floodlamps which bathed the house in
light and they announced over a loudspeaker system that
they would open fire if the men did not withdraw. The
gunmen waited a moment, then dismantled their rifle,-and
drove off into the night.

By late 1971, the vigilantes had stepped up their attacks
and had chosen their principal targets. One of these was a
certain Peter Bohmer, a radical who at the time was teach-
ing economics at San Diego State College. He began receiv.
ing threatening phone calls, and on November 7a
car parked in front of his house was firebombed. Then on
December 27, 1971, a group calling itself the Secret Army:
Organization put out a Spe Bulletin on Peter Bohmer.
After listing his anti-war activities, and his background, the
fetter said: “For any of our readers who may care to look
up this Red Scum, and say hello, here is some mfucmation

“Now, in case any of you don’t believe

On January 6, 1972, cross-hair

Bohmer’s home and a woman named
Paula-‘Tharp was wounded.
The right-wing terror campaign con-
~ tinued for’ six more months, marked
by death threats, menacing phone

came on June 19, 1972, when an SAO
member bombed a local porno movie
- house, the Guild Theatre. This last
event finally aroused the San Diego
police to drive the group underground.
Police action brought a halt, at least
temporarily, to right-wing terrorism in
San Diego. But this is not the end of
the tale. For in the months that fol-
lowed a very bizarre story began to un-
ravel, one which involved the SAO, the
FBI, and some mysterious contacts
between the terrorists and agents of
CREEP. The pieces began to appear as
early as mid-1972, but it is only in re-
cent months that they have been
pulled together by reporters for

paper, the Door,

+" [SECRET ARMY-USA]

he SAO, it seems, grew out of

| the demise of the Minutemen.
According to a recently dis-
covered document entitled “History of
the Secret Army Organization,” it all
began one morning in February, 1970,
when “... a group of six Minutemen
leaders:from four states met secretly ii
Northern Arizona to discuss the crisis
that the arrest and imprisonment of
two top Minutemen leaders and the
assassination of a third had brought on
the organization. , Although some of
these men had met before in their
roles as Minutemen group leaders,

others were meeting for the first *

time.” These men agreed that “the
Minutemen as a national coordination
organization of militant right wing
groups had effectively been destroyed
by the pro-communist elements inside
the Justice Department,” and they fur-
ther agreed that the need. for a co-
ordinating organization was greater
than ever “in view of the increased
revolutionary activity by communists

“in the United States.” The new organi-

zation was the Secret Army Organiza-
tion, and it would save America from
its leftward drift ‘wnder | Nixon’s
regime. an :

The initial SAO documents speak
of the immediate need to set up para-
military groups to carry on guerrilla
warfare, and even open and conyen-
tional warfare. A letter from “General
Headquarters” dated November 8,
1971, outlines the ‘nature of SAO
operations—combat teams, organiza-
tion, transportation, travel procedures,
weapons and equipment, training les-
sons, intelligence work, security, etc.
They say that the country has entered

ora etal

“Stage UI”: a time when most people
still think they can still get along with
the government, but “a few real
patriots are willing to take part in
underground activity.” Stage Il “will
be a time of assassination and counter-
assassination, terror and counter
terror.” It is a period marked by “the
communist infiltration and control of
the present United States govern-
ment.” 7

SAO thus set out to wage total re-
sistance to communism, a small band
determined to risk all in the struggle
for America. Nationwide, the group
probably numbered less than 200
members, 30 of whom were active in
San Diego county. There the group
was founded by two men—Jerry Lyna
Davis (Southland Coordinator) and
Howard Berry Godfrey (San Diego
Commander and Intelligence Officer).

In late 1971 and the first half of
1972 the SAO put out bulletins on
how to make ‘booby traps, how to use
ammonium nitrate in high explosives,
and how to gain forced entry into
buildings. (Much of this information

was taken from Department of the _

Amny Technical Manuals on “Uncon-
ventional Warfare Devices and Tech-
niques.”) The San Diego SAO also pur
out bylletins about local liberals, radi-
cals and anti-war activists, all of whom
were lumped together as communists.
(These missives went out to a mailing
list of 227 names in the area. including
a nayal commander, a county super
visor, a vice admiral, a Marine Corps
brigadier general, a rear admiral, and
some San Diego police officers.)

The group was organized into smail,
semi-autonomous cells. Members were
listed by code numbers, and were
given mail drops for their contacts.



(THE FBI CONNECTION]

June 1972 bombing of the Guild
Theatre led to the group's full
” from grace. A former Birchite named
| William Francis Yakopee was arrested
and charged with the bombing, and in
September 1972, he was brought to
trial in the Superior Court of the State
- of California in San Diego, before
Judge Robert W. Conyers. Much to the
astonishment of the SAO supporters,
the star, witness against Yakopec
tumed out to be San Diego Com-
mander Godfrey. Then a local fireman,
Godfrey admitted he had worked for
the FBI since early 1967 as an under-
cover agent. He did it, he said, because
“J felt it was my duty to my country.”
Before accepting the role, he had
- talked it over with J. Clifford Wallace,
then the Stake President of the Mormon
Church for San Diego, and more
recently a federal judge by appoint-
ment of Richard Nixon. Wallace put
Godfrey in touch with the FBI, and he
Was assigned to agent Steve Christian-
| son, to whom he reported verbally
> every day: Godftey was to work on
‘the militant ‘right wing, and was paid
$250.00 per month by the FBI. At
first he was assigned to the Minute-
men, and then with the demise of that
group in San Diego, he helped start
j--and run the SAO in November 1971.
- Godfrey testified that his FBI contacts
knew all of his activities, including his
- stockpiling of illegal explosives in his
house. This, he said, was done with
their permission. (He later gave some
_ of the explosives to Yakopec to “save
them for after the Communist take- _
over of this country.”)
. Godfrey functioned as a one-man
plumbers’ operation within the SAO.
_ He knew how to pick locks, burglarize,
- bomb and handle guns. The FBI paid
his dues and covered his expenses. All
_ this enabled him to carry on effective-
ly as a terrorist. At Yakopec’s trial, he
said that he actively recruited for the .
group. What kind of people did he
look for? “Peuple with previous right
wing connections.” Did he enlist po-
tentially dangerous elements? “Yes,
sir.”
Apparently, Godfrey himself was
= among the more dangerous elements in
the SAQ, and agent Christianson
among the more dangerous eminences
NW 68262 Docid:32989523 Page 267

5 Ss thrived in San Diego until the

grises of the operation. During the
Yakopec trial, Godfrey admitted that
he had driven the car from which
another SAO member, Gecrge Hoover,
had fired into Buhmer’s house, wound-
ing Paula Tharp. Subsequently, he had
taken the weapon to Christianson,
who had hidden it for six months.
(This was evidently — insufficient
grounds for the FBI to take disci-
plinary action against agent Christian-
son, He continued as Godfrey’s con-
tact until the bombing of the Guild
Theatre, at which point he was re-
moved by L. Patrick Gray himself. He
currently resides in Kanosh, Utah.)

In addition, Godfrey confessed to
publishing a certain leaflet on Febru-
ary 18, 1972, the day on which Presi-
dent Nixon left for China. The bulletin
was headlined “Wanted for Treason,”
and jt featured a picture of Nixon and
an inflammatory text which accused
the President of high treason because
of his China policy. The SAO symbol
appeared at the bottom of the text,
and the group distributed it in 15
cities—including San Diego, Phoenix,
‘Yuma, San Francisco, and Bellingham,
Washington.

At the Yakopec trial, Godfrey testi-
fied that-he had paid the printer for
the posters, picked them up, and was
reimbursed by the FBI, and that the
FBI understood the nature of his ex-
penditures and saw all of his SAO pub-
lications. As for poor Yakopec, who
had joined the SAO through Godfrey,
his next door neighbor, he admitted to
owning several of the posters: he said
he stored them under his mattress.
Why there? “I thought they were kind
of corny.” Later, he testified that he
kept a bomb with the Nixon posters.
Did he generally keep bombs under his
bed? “No, | like to sleep, too well.”
(When I visited the San Diego Court
House to see the exhibit in question,
the custodian located a stack of 33
posters, with the bomb casing still at-
tached!)

It was not noted at the time, but in
fact these posters bear a remarkable
resemblance (o leaflets which were dis-
tributed in Da S, just one or
two days prior to the assassination of
President Kennedy. That poster like-
wise bore the headline “Wanted for
Treason” and it also featured pictures
(tront and profile) of JFK and an in-
Hammatory text about the President's

allegedly treasonous activities. On the
hunch that the leaflet might lave some
connection with the assassination, the
Warren Commission sent Secret Ser-
vice agents to track down its author
and printer. They worked from late
November 1963, to May 1904, until
they found that Robert G. Klause had
printed the flyer and that Robert
Allan Surrey, an associate of Gen.
Walker, had ordered it. When Surrey
testified before the Commission on
June 16, 1964, he pled the Fifth
Amendment on all questions concern-
ing the leaflet. The late Hale Bo:
member of the Warren Commi
pointed out that Surrey “is the only
witness out of hundreds whé has pled
the Fifth Amendment.” Klause denied
any interest in or involvement with the
contents of the leaflet, and there the
matter was allowed to rest. By that

point, the Warren Commission was

determined to prove that Oswald had
acted alone, and therefore lost interest
in trying to connect the assassination
with the leaflet. .

Godfrey’s surfacing as an FBI agent

+ rattled the remnants of the SAO. They

were angry at having been set up by
the FBI, and when reporters for the
Door began approaching their old ad-
versaries for information earlier this
year, they found that many were will-
ing to cooperate; some were even
friendly. And as the SAO began to
open up, a pattern began to emerge
which seemed to link the San Diego
events to Watergate.

“[BREAKTHROUGR]

he breakthrough came __ this

| spring when an editor of the
Door made contact with a
former SAO militant named Jerry
Busch. From November 1969 to the
summer of 1971, said Busch, Howard
Berry Godfrey made frequent visits to
the Gunsmoke Ranch in, El Cajon. “It
was also during June, July, and August
of 1971 that Berry Godfrey and
Donald etti (posing as ‘Don

Simms’) visited Gunsmoke and though ~

supposedly not “knowing each othe:
they spoke together on at least one oc-
casion,” in a quiet conversation aside.
The Segretti connection is important
in itself’ it is particularly interesting in-
sofar as—according tu Buseh’s account
-Sergretti was in touch with SAO



—NW 68262 Docld:32989523 Page 268 _

* while contacting his old college chums
“Chapin and Strachan in June

1971,

but before commencing work as a

dirty trickster in September 1971.
Busch did not say what Segretti dis-

cussed at the Gunsmoke Ranch, but he

did report that following “these casual
conversations” Godfrey came up with
bizarre ideas to take care of what he
called “those red punks”—in the event

" . that the GOP held its convention in

San Diego. Among Godfrey’s plans in

October 1971, were:

3) the use of massive dosages of LSD,
cyanide or strychnine introduced
into the punch at anti-war group

” meetings;

2} bombing of the VVAW head-
quarters, the Guild Theatre, and
several porno shops;

3) bombings of the homes or offices
of anti-war leaders:

“4) kidnapping or assassination of anti-

war leaders and activists;

3) fire bombing of vehicles and other
roperty belonging to anti-war ac-
ivists.

. By November and December 1971,
Busch continued, Godfrey had become
more ambitious: he wanted to acquire
drone planes which would carry pay-

. loads of high explosives and phospho-

mus to be dropped on the demon-

. strators. In addition, Godfrey spoke of

using similar air craft, loaded with
TNT or C-4 plastique, to blow up Air

_ Force One and assassinate Nixon. The
* idea was to fly a bomb into the Presi-

dential jet as it landed either at Lind-
bergh Field or at El Toro Marine Base.
Busch .claimed. that he had expressed
horror at the suggestion and told God-
frey he had lost his mind suggesting
anything as insane as an attempt on
the life of the President. Shortly there-
after, Busch and Godfrey parted ways
after the former grew suspicious that
he was being set up to take the rap on

“the shooting of Paula Tharp. By

March 1972, he had left San Diego
and has not yet returned.

Even before Busch left the SAO,
the “Wanted for Treason” leaflet was
printed and distributed. Another
former SAO member corroborates that
in this same “es?od—January-February,
1972-Godf.ey tried to find someone
to build a pline that would carry a
load of high explosives. (ln addition,
he was apparently trying to obtain
anotlier plane for the purpose of gas-
sing or bombing demonstrators on

f Pisses :
Fiesta Island.) After Busch's depar-
ture, the SAO issued its April 1972,
bulletin, which began with a quote at-
tributed to Abraham Lincoln, “A ty-
rant would not come to the United
States from across the sea. If he

comes, he'll ride down Pennsylvania”

Avenue from his inauguration and take
up legal residence of the White
fouse.” Then followed detailed in-
structions on the manufacture of ex-
plosives which might be used to de-
stroy a large bridge (Tackwood’s
scenario included the demolition of
two bridges on and off of Fiesta Is-
land) and on various methods of
forced entry into buildings.

. [ASINISTER PLOT?) _

23 there a right-wing plot to
i Kill the President? Tackwood

says so. Busch says that FBI

informer Berry Godfrey talked about,

it. The “Wanted for Treason” poster
certainly indicated no loss of love be-
tween the extreme right and the Presi-
dent, and Godfrey was checking out
the availability of drone planes.

There are other curious, if admit-
tedly inconclusive, clues as well: The
day Nixon went to China, E. Howard

> Hunt was working as a public relations

man on a Julie Nixon Eisenhower TV
spot. He raged about the China trip,
“We should not send people to China,
we should send bombs to China.” This
from a man supposedly involved in a
secret scheme to re-elect the President
by illegal means.

Or take this item which appeared in
the March 9, 1972, issue of the V.Y.
Times (10 days after Nixon’s return
from China):

WAR ALERT SENT IN HOAX

BY A COAST GUARDSMAN
“New Orleans, March 8 (UPI)-An en-
listed man standing watch sent a hoax
message to ships at sea during Presi-
dent Nixon’s visit to China, saying the
President .had been assassinated -and
the Vice President had declared World
War Hil, the Coast Guard revealed yes-
terday.

“The authorities said that the hoax
message had not been taken serivusly
and that the man who sent it from a
small Coast Guard statiun in Texas had
been confined and was undergoing
cal evaluation. a

“Tic message was sent February 27
by teletype to 22 ships in the Gulf of

°..

There was no further story on this
that I have been able to find. If the
hoax message had gone out to a Polaris
submarine, Hunt might have gotten his
wish, that bombs would be sent to
China.

Then, the L.A. Times reported on
July 13, 1973 that a former Minute-
man had requested political asylum in
Fiji. saying he had secret information
on Watergate and feared assassination.

All of this proves nothing, of
course, but it suggests that the D ty

Tricks operation may have been much

more complex than we have been led
to believe. Perhaps there was a plot to
kill Nixon, and then again Godfrey's
plot may have been 4 further hoax
aimed at discrediting the left and the
Democratic Party. What did Segretti
discuss with Godfrey, and why and
how did he meet Godfrey in the
place? How did it happen that the FBI
financed a threat on the life of a Presi-
dent (a crime which carties a penalty
of up to five years in jail and‘a $1,000
fine)? In the past, the Secret Service
has taken such threats very seriously.
A check of the New York Times index
shows that at least 11 people were-ar-
rested between January, 1972 and
May 1973 for doing much less than
Godfrey. Most seem to have been
psychopaths or drunks, with no posi-
tive plan—just verbal threats.

But then there are other instances:
Arthur Bremer’s Ottawa visit on April
13-14, 1972, for example, when }
supposedly stalked Nixon. On May 39,
three bombs demolished the tomb of
‘the father of the Shah of Iran an hour
“before Nixon was scheduled to lay a
wreath there. On August 11, a certain
A.B. Topping was arrested in New
York after paying an undercover agent
$1,000 to kill Nixon. Topping
developed, was well-to-do, of
American Nazi political persuasion,
and interested in having the President
killed the week aftpe the pay.
trial has been held: And then in {até
May 1973, one of Nixon’s helicopters
went down in the Bahamas. 11 subse-
quently came out that the President
has three helicopters ready at all times
and chooses which to use one minute
before the tight.

Watergate has uncovered an ad-
Ministration racked by factionalism.
Under Hoover, the FBI was at odds
with the White House~to such a



1

eegree that Hoover was willing to use
secret documents to blackmail the
President. In addition, Nixon was
‘having his difficulties with the leaders
of the CIA, and James McCord wrote
to John Caulfield at Christmas, 1972.
that if Nixon pushed out Helms and ~
involved the CIA in Watergate, “every
tree in the forest will fall.” Could
there have been other tensions as well? |
Were there elements which opposed
Nixon for his policy of rapprochement
with China and Russia, and which
-, would have preferred, say, Spiro
+, Agnew as President? :
After returning from San Diego in
July 1972, ‘acting FBI director, L.
Patrick Gray, talked to Nixon and
said: “Mr. President, there is some-
: thing I want to speak to you about.
Dick Walters and I feel that people on
your staff are trying to mortally
wound you by using the CIA and the aeauee
FBI ...” His words may have carried
eseeaat greater import than any of us have
“heretofore suspected.

group together with his mailing list, contributors, and
Fight wing contacts. : :

The name card file listed the following identifying
data ‘regarding the subject:

and is acquainted with only one person affiliated with the
Secret Army Organization, that being RICHARD FLEURY, who
is his next-door neighbor. He stated that the reason

informed by them that they had discovered his gate open
and his front door unlocked during the day time hours

on June 1/, 19/2. He further advised that in one of

the Secret Army Organization trials, HOWARD BARRY GODFREY
had testified that JERRY LYNN DAVIS had known about the
weapons stolen from MARSHALL. MARSHALL could not recall
whether GODFREY had testitied that he had actually at

the time seen these weapons or had testified that he had
merely been informed ot these weapons by DAVIS.

MARSHALL stated that he desired-to know
whether or not the FBI had any intormation regarding his
weapons and his primary interest was to recover his
weapons. .

MARSHALL was advised that all information

_furnished by HOWARD BARRY GODFREY to the FBI regarding
violations ot local or state statutes had been disseminated
to the appropriate local or state agency, and that he
should contact the San Diego County Sheritt's Oftice as
that agency would have jurisdiction over the -burglary
which occurred at his residence. He said he had been in
contact with the San Diego County Sheritt's Oftice, and had
been advised that his weapons had not been recovered and
that the Sheritt's Oftice had no information regarding

- the whereabouts ot these weapons.

MARSHALL turther advised that he is aware of the
location of the Gunsmoke Ranch, but does not frequent

this location, and again advised that he has never met any ~ -

ot the persons aftiliated with the Secret Army Organization
except RICHARD FLEURY. He turther advised that FLEURY has

a considerable number of weapons at his residence, including
shot guns, ritles, and automatic pistols. He has made
statements to the ettect that he will not again be taken
“alive. MARSHALL expressed nis personal point that FLEURY is
mentally unbalanced, and turther advised that FLEURY is
highly critical ot all law entorcement in general, and otf
the FBI, imparticular. He said FLEURY plans to tile suat

against tne San Diego, Calitornia, Police Department
or the San Diego County Sheritt’s Ortice tor the
return of weapons which were seized from him at the
time of his arrest. He said that FLEURY also talks
about going to South America and is highly critical

of the United States Government in his conversations.
MARSHALL further advised that GENEVIEVE FLEURY in cone
versation with other neighbors which have been related
to MARSHALL, has indicated that she thinks her husband,
RICHARD FLEURY, is planning to do something “out of the
ordinary". MARSHALL said he did not imow what she meant

no direct conversation with her, but has been hearing

these rumors from other people, and he expressed the

opinion that FLEURY's departure from the United States :

7 may be what thesé fumors refer to. He said that GENEVIEVE
. FLEURY has indicated to neighbors that RICHARD FLEURY
thinks that she will accompany him to South America,

- but, in fact, she does not plan to go with him if he does
leave this country. : :

MARSHALL advised that he is not on friendly

terms with FLEURY, in that he somewhat suspects FLEURY of
burglarizing his home, and he feels that FLEURY does not
trust him. He said he would relay any information regarding
FLEURY's activities to this office, but said that because
of his relationship with FLEURY, he would not bee in a
Posse to actively seek information regarding FLEURY's
plans. Sect

ed open contempt for the rights of the accused,
‘refusing even to recognize that the Heck Ware-

cajoled into accepting the bland assurances of thé

warned about the Nixon-Kissinger scheme of
Soviet-Americon convergence as the first step in
the ‘Grand Design of One World Government.,

In reviewing the many exclusive news items of

surreptitiously channelling funds to the pro-Com-

ation was to drat left-wing votes from Democrat

‘The process is that the U.S. Treasurer has
a supply of unsigned engraved U.S. Govern-

they used to be because there is none. ‘only

On Septenber 29, 1972, Roger Saith, Intelligence
Agent, Internal Revenue Service, U. S. Repartment of
Treasury, frosno, California, advised that Seott continues
. to reside at 482 North voplar, Apartaent C, fresho,
Californié, and that he still mainteins his insurance
office at 1843 Hast Belmont, fresno. Saith advised that
L on Septesber 25, 1972, Scott was arrested for viclation of
| : two counts of Titla 26, U. S. Coda, fection 7203 (wilful .
failure to file income tax returns) for the years, 1969
‘+ gnd 1970. Bond was set at $10,000 and later recuced to
\- $5,000 corporate surety bond which Scott posted.

. Assistant U. S. Attorney, Thomas Couris, Fresno,
aé@vised that Scott's trial on above violation was scheduled
for April 17, 1973.

Z On Rovember 3, 1972, a confidential scurce who
is in a position to know advised that Ccott is the Netional-
Chairman of the Income Tax Rebellion Comaittee which
advocates the nonpaynent of texes as a protest and a means
of combat against’ the Federal Income Tax.

a This source further advised that Scott clains to

have many unregistered firearas, one of which he keeps in

his car end one he keens in his top right desk draver.

Scott told this source that if anyone came to confiscate

\ his guns or to atrest Itha, he vould shoot then. He further
stated that he vould not personally hate the officers, but
what they reoresent.* : - 8

American Volunteer Groups

Brown wrote to John Zemanek (Huntington Beach, Calif.), Head
of the AVG. He asked Zemanek to send-him any information that
he has on the Secret Army ranization in California. He ‘also
asked how the aVG's new front, a foundation,was coming along.

He also asked Zemanek's opinion of the H.S.5 Ss. RP. P. and its"leaders.

: "Communist Activities

Donald Welker (Los Angeles, Calif.), a member of the Patrict
Militia, called Dr. Roy Brown on the evenings of 2nd and 4th
of October, 1972 While Dr, Brown was still in Christoval, Texas.
He did this to warn Brown that he thought the Cuban Gu ilia
Group that he was mixing with was headed by wii, ‘stated
that he had just mailed a letter but would s

anoiuer one right
away with more details as the first letter had none on the Cuban nS.
He stated that as he had given the Cuban Leader, Juan Araujo ,
Commanding Officer, Cuban 2505 Brigade, Brown's. address and that
Brown ought to know it for his own sarety.

The first letter from Walker only contained ce ea ant information
and a craz¥ poem.

The second letter which was written after the phone calls was 7 4
more lengthly and gave information on the Cuban Group and Walker's ]
.Teasons for thinking that the leaders are Cdmmunis <a . He also”
asked for copies of Bill Hanson's (Vere Beach, Florida) book,
City Survival-City Resistance aS he wanted them for some of his
Survival, Anti-Commyst st converts. ze :

rrevl (Houston, Texas), an old timer of the
Waterfront section ot the Communist Party and a former leader
nist urovun running the Hational Maritime Union from
piion in 1937 until 1947, sheved up as @ Delegate | at the
fexas State Democratic Party Convention in Houston, Texas that
wask held in Septenber, 1972. de was still up to his “oud ratble
rousing ways and gave out the 014 commie line to his fellow
Democrat delegates. An intepSting note to it is that he eet it
a@ current paid up dues receint in the Masters, Mates % Pilot
Union. This neans that he holds # current license as a ueck
officer issued by the United States Coast Guard. This is strange
as ALL Comsunists were supposed to have gad their merchant mariue
papers taken away from them in the late 1940's, This was as a.
national s curity me sure te iusure that 20 commies would be on
American merchant ships. evidently still has his viogletion

SUBIECTS + Activities c ¢ @enite boao--Josnt activi@ce of NSWPP & SAO,

: Riclosed you. will a..ad a newspaper clipping 6.4 photograph: which
describes the opening © he John Schmitz for President headquarters
in ‘Escondido. As. described: in the clipping, Dennis Loso is the second
men from the right. ~ It figured that ‘Loso would be involved in this
because he was a great: Schmitz supporter long before this presidential
race, The other three men I do not know. However, there are some of |
his hunting.and political associates of which I could tell you something.
One is Wesley Rounds. This man has been worked on for a long time by
Topo. Politically, h he has always tended toward the right, but Loso has
succeeded in bringing him much farther along toward National Socialism.
founds is manager of the Californian Motel. It is located in Escondido
st the northeast comer of Hwy 395 and Washington Avenue. Rounds! exact
age I do not know but I would guess'him to be somewhere in his 408.— :
sometime back Loso took Rounds to‘his first William Gale service at Oneira
‘a11 in'San Diego. Rounds seemed ‘impressed with Gale. Wes is married.
Another man who periodically visits Loso-ig Al MeDonald.. Al is 40
rears old and is a-friendly, congenial type of person. He is “single and
spends mech of his time in Montana "living | the good life." Whaever he”
rans low on money, he comes down to Escondido. and works for Dennis for
2 while. He claims that he managed to live on just $3 ,000 ‘last year.
fcDonald also spends.a fair amount of time living in Montague, California.
fhis town is located in Siskiyou County near the Orezon border UeDonald's
parents also live there. they very much disapprove of hig ae sympathies.
om one occasion, his Mother found a large. svas tika in his cabin while he
vasn't there.. ‘Ske threw it in his wood burning stove and would have burned
it except that ‘she couldn't find eny matches. His most recent visit-to
Escondido was in July and August at which time he gave the swastika flag
20 Loso for safe keeping. Loso allowed McDonald to stay he free in
me of his unoccupied apartments. 7
: I learned: from Gerald Smith recently that as long as ‘one year ago,
there were joint target practice sessions. between’ members of the NSWPP
and the SAO. The site of these little excursions was ‘the Gunsmoke Fanch.
yexald says the place is virtually a stronghold of: the Minutemen.” farti-
-ipanis in the target shooting sessions most frequently were Gerald Smith,
Ray Wilson, Lrg. Ray Wilson, Stanley McDade, Jerry Lynn Davis and Georg

witnesses in any criminal prosecution and the nature of the
subjects involved dictate they be brought to the bar of justice.

-thereof you will arrive ata mutually agreeable course of
action, ]

Pass I would like to mention that any proposed trial testimony

- regarding information developed as a result of your official
duties as a Special agent of the FBI must ke identified and
furnished to the Department of Justice in order that considera-
tion can be given as to whether information is to be disclosed
by you. SA Earl M. Petersen will coordinate this matter and will
assist you in any way possible, este F

With hopes that the ends of justice will be served with

-the minimum of inconvenience to you, and that you and your family
are adjusting to your new environment, I am,

Rex Ie Shroder

Special Agent in Charge
Federal Buresu of Investigation
San Diego, California 92105

Dear Mr. Shrodert

In connection with the investigation and prosecution of the

“shooting of Paula Tharp, for which Geroge M. Hoover has been indicted,

I have received correspondence from Mr. Hewicker of the San Diego
County District Attorney's Office asking whether I would be willing to
testify in this matter. The purpose of this testimony would be to
substantiate the reliability of Howard Godfrey as an. informant and to
provide information as to the custody of the weavon involved. TI have
indicated to Mr. Hewicker that I would not be unwilling to furnieh
such testimony but would be somewhat reluctant due to my present
circumstances. It would appear to me that the interests of the Bureau
and the District Attorney's Office, as well as myself, would be better
served if this information was furnished by jsomeone still connected
with the FBI. Godfrey's reliability should lbe a matter of record to
which Earl Petersen could easily testify. Furthermore Mr. Petersen
has some first-hand knowlegs as to the location of the weavon, snd,
because of the nature of the incident, I imagine ny testimony in this
Yesvect would need a8 much substantiating as 3 Godfrey! 8

G Another decided disadvantage for me would be the disclosure
of my oresent whereabouts to individuals such 2s revresentatives of the
"Door", to whom you made reference in your letter of the Fifteenth.

I do not desire to be located or contacted by these or similar neovlee

NW 68262 Docld:32989523 Page 370

However, if this should occur, I intend to state merely that I left
the Bureau on the adyice of my versonal physician, which would have
been an actuality within a veriod of a few weeks or months anyway.

I would certainly appreciate it if such a course of action
as I have mentioned could be made feasible.

Sincerely,

Gamat RULES OF GUERRILLA WA RE

1. The first rule of guerrilla warfare is to dispease with any
rule or set of rules which results ia routine or predictable activity,
Any time the enemy commander can anticipete-what the guerrilla band

“will do next, he can then lay a trap by which his superiority of

numbers and equipment may be brought to bear upon them with devasta-
ting effect. : aaeeer)

2. Military actioa by guerrilla bands cannot achieve maximum

ty capabilities are developed to
an equal degree of perfection, principally thr aa the cooperation of
friendly non-combatants.

3. Propaganda warfare is one ‘of the gue rillas most! ef
weapons. It must be waged continuously to dezoralize the en: my ,
enlist support of the civilian population and to justify the existence

‘and actions of the guerrilla bands.

4. Each member of thé underground movement must be rent
immune to the enemy's: propaganda by continuous counter~p
They must realize that the enemy is certain to spread lies ‘about thes

“leaders, to try and break the bands up by encouraging petty jealousies
and dissensions, to make them feel their fight is hopeless, to encourage
“them to get on the winning side, to offer mercy and rewards to those

who voluntarily surrender. Most of all enemy propaganda will be aimed
as destroying the individual organization member's faith in the honesty,
capability and true.motives-of other members of the underground move-
ment.

5. Surprise is the main element of successful guerrilla warfare.
No matter how vigilant the enemy may be there will be times your band
can take him by surprise. Perhaps he is tired, perhaps sleeping,
perhaps he is in an area where he feels so completely safe that he
lets down his guard-- that's when you hit h:

. 6. “Any guerrilla thar wants to keep on living must constantly
remind himself that war is not a sporting, Lasbe: debeehoeauitae never give the
communists an eyen break.

7. Generally speaking guerrillas must work in smsll bands. ¥rom
five to fifteen is usual but even here its best not to get into a ret.
If the eneay commander in your area knows you always work in small
groups he can then divide his available anti-guerrilla forces into,
groups of 15 to 25 and thus cover more ground than if he had to matn~
tain groups of two or three hundred to make certsin his forces would
always out number any guerrilla band they happened upon.

8. The guerrilla leader must always keep his thia aking one step
ahead of the enemys. Hece are some exemples:

vestigate. Suddenly the "corps

"zolls over and
with a machine gun. . :

This little trick might work several times but eventually the
enemy will figure it cut. The criver of a truck full of enemy troops
sees a “corpse” lying in the road. Quickly he stops the truck. The
troops pile out of the truck and riddle the "corpse" with bullets.

Too late they discover its only a dummy made of old clothes and straw.
They are caught in 2 murderous cross-fire between guerrillas hidden
along both sides of the road, Most are killed but one lives long

enough to tell what happened.

A fow days leter another truck of troops sees a "corpse" lying
in the middle of the hi ay. The driver has been forewarned so he
knows better than to stop. Instead he steps on the gas, runs over
ds on around the next curve in the road-- perhaps .
erhaps into’ a chain stretched ace

covered with fresh oil which sends the truck eae over an enbank-
ent. oe : 7

What will the uext truck full of treeps do? What can you figure
out so you will still be thinking one step ahead of the enemy?

: 9. Generally speaking the guerrilla band must avoid superior
forces. When attacked by a superior force the guerrillas must quickly
+ retreat or disperse. When the enemy stops, they may return to harass
him-- or perhaps they won't. When the enemy is exhausted they may
attack-~ but again they may not. When the enemy retreats the guerrillas”
may give chase-- but only | if they can ae very sure they are not being

Jed into a trap.

10. Guerrillas must always Fight at a time and place of their own
choosing-- never at a time or place of the enemy's choosing.

x» ll. Before any raid on enemy troops or installations the guerrilla
leader must obtain coniplate and accurate intelligence on the number of
the enemy on hand, the number near enough to be called on for assistance,
amount and type of my armament, location of sentries, scouts or
protective patrols and all other information that will effect the plan-

ning or conduct of the raic.

22, All raids against the éneay must’ be exactly planned and care-
. fully rehearsed. Tc is often desirable to draw a miniature cepy of the
enemy installation so thot all members of the raiding party can play
out their respective duties setera! times to make sure they do not
forget or become confused ta the heat of battle.

bly go wrony must be anticipated
rho any eventuality.

14. Guerrillse should strike a violent lig - oe blow that leaves
the enemy stunned at least long enough for them to make a safe retreat,

: 15. In no case must the guerrilias allow themselves to be drawn
into a long pitched battle with enemy treops.

16, So long as friendly forces of the conventional military
are able to retain their offensive potential it is expedient for
guerrilla forces to coordinate their activities ‘with such friendly

troops... eeeeseieuey

17. Guerrilla bands must always move in secret-~ their whereabouts
must always be hidden from the civilian populetion-as well as..from
.enemy troops. : Benes eL SUSREEESNEECZEESE!

18. When possible always attack the enemy at places which are

distant from centers of population as this will reduce the possibility
_ of his making reprisals against friendly civilians.

19, If a lone enemy Soldier is way-laid in the city or suburbs it
is best to carry his body.away where it can be buried and the grave
cawouflaged so his commander will not know whether he has been killed

-or has deserted. Take his uniform and hide it carefully where it can
be later retrieved. It might come in handy. ©

20. The guerrillas must always operate in their home territory
where they have intimate knowledge of their surroundings. If driven
from their own territery by a superior enemy force they should return

*.as soon as they safely can, provided that their main hide-out has not
. been discovered and there is no chance of an enemy ambush.

21, Guerrillas must make every effort to stay friendly with any”
civilian population in their territory as the civilians may be their
best source ‘of food, other idee or valuable information about

nearby enemy forces,

22. It is almost essential that the guerrilla’ band have at least
one sécure hide-out where they can rest up, store their supplies and
care for their wounded. This hide-ouc may be ifn some large forest or
mountainous area but such is not always necessary.
one Russian guerrilla band had their headquarters in a storm sewer.
Another band headquartered in the basement of a hospital in one of the
“smaller towns. Another operaced from an abandoned coal mine.

23, The guerrilla band should have one or more alternate hide-outs

and be ready to move quickly and quietly to another prepared location
in case their main headquarters is discovered. To preserve naxinum
security the location of these alternate hide-outs should be knowa to
the least possible number af their own band.

24. To operate successfully over long periods of time the
guerrilla band must have plenty of space in which to manucver--
preferably a large enough area thac the enemy is incapable of
covering all of it with anti-guerrilla forces at.one time.

large guns and mec ed foresees but with proper strategy at least
some guerrilla act can be suited to almost any type area-~ evan
large cities. Furthermore, due to the widespread use of light weight
weapons such as the bazooka aad recoilless rifle it must be expected
that mountains will provide somavhat less protection to guerrillas
in future wars than they have the past. Therefcre it is essential
that underground activity be directed against the enemy under every
possible condition and over the widest possible area so as to prevent

* 40, Ther is a big difference between sa' ‘age and wanton de-
‘struction, oe activities must be “gc so as to
cause minimal datige to private property. : :

41, Hit-or-miss sabotage is not nearly as effective as coordin-
‘ated sabotage that strikes systematically at some few essential
industries of activities vital to the enemy at that particular time.

42, Targets for raids and sabotage must be carefully selected to
achieve maximum damage to the enemy with least risk to the guerrilla
“band. If the enemy has an abundance of guns but is, low, on jail
then burning a warchouse full of guns will’ not count for
burning a warehouse full of ammunition would be a vital blow.

43. Each military action against the enemy must be plarmed in such
a manner that the amount of ammunition and supplies captured are at
least enough to replenish the amount expended in that action.

44. Both offensive and defensive guerrilla activity is vitally
dependent upon accurate knowledge of the enemy's strength, location,
movements and so far as possible his intentions which is usually
best obtained first hand by guerrilla scouts.

45. In the event that treops have settled down in the guerrille
area for a long and routine occupation, efforts should be made to
determine whether or not they are completely loyal to the foreign
“ideology before antagonizing a possible potential ally.

_ 46. The guerrilla must be continuously imagining himself in the
shoes of his enemy. He must get to know how the enemy is likely ro
‘react in any given situation. He must be able to guess what the
enemy commander will expect his band to do next. ‘In'this way he can
often anticipate what the enemy will do. By then acting in some
totally unexpected manner he can continuously catch the enemy in a
Series of embarrassing situations.

47. Guerrilla forces must remain widely dispersed throughout the
entire area of enemy occupation. They must never accumulate in large
numbers in a given area that the enemy can surround and eventually
starve them out or gradually close in on them. -

48, Guerrilla forces must be always alert to possible anti-

guerrilla action, that may be taken against them and constantly
prepared to take suitable evasive action.

49. The guerrilla bands most essential function is to guarantee
its own continuation. The very existence of the guerrilla band
.Yequires the enemy to guard against them and in so doing they are
drained of manpower, supplies and equipment which the enémy forces
might be needing badly in some other area. . :

50. Clear-cut victory is seldom possible either with or against
guerrilla warfare-- the side that hoids out longest will be the
ultimate winner,

JELLIED GASOLINE

Pour the contents of one bottle (1 pint 3 0z.) of Dynan concentrated liquid laundry deter;
bucket or large mouthed can of about two to five yallonsize. Fill the detergent bottle twice, shaking
well to rinse it out with gasoline (any grade) and add it to the detergent: You will now have about

3 1/2 pints (57 oz) of material in the bucket. The detergent will be at the bottomundthe gasoline on
the top. Stir this rapidly with a wooden or wire paddle so as to mix in as much air as possible, Soun
the mixture will take on the appearance of soft vasoline. = :

Now add in a gallon of gasoline and stir again until the mixture thickens. At this point, transfer the
nixture to clean containers. No return type beer and soda bottles are ideal, For chemical land
mines, use two gallon oil cans. The container should be filled approximately one third full of the
nixture. Finish filling the container with gasoline leaving a little air space at the top. Place your
finger or hand over the opening und shake well until the gasoline and mixture amalgamate. You can
verify this by looKing at the finger or hand occasionally lo see if a film of jellied gasoline about an
eighth of an inch thick clings to it. When proper consistency is reached, the bottles may be capped or
corked. Cans should have tight fitting lids screwed on. This may be stored up to two weeks. Tie

a rag around the neck of each bottle being careful not to leave the ends of the rag too long or toa loose.

If necessary, this mixture can be "cut" 50°% with gasoline or other petroleum product. The tendency
to "cling" will suffer slightly, but consistency can he maintained by pouring off the excess gasoline
whenever the detergert refuses to "take" any more.

To use, saturate the rag with gasoline or the mixture from the bottle. Keep the flamable material
off of your person and clothing. Light the rag with match or cigarette lighter and immediately serve.
‘Throw hard against a solid object such 2s masonry, concrete. or metal. In using the mixture in

a chemicel land mine, wrap three or four wraps of primacord around a two gallon can ahd tie th

acord under the can around a pound of explosive, This may be exploded either electricuily ar by a per-
cussion such as a booby trap device or anti-personell fuse. Do not contact wires to the blasting

Will send you the other articles as they are printed. The way we understand it
is that it will be a three piece article, The first one is not to bad. We have
been receiving articles from other papers in the area too, but they Pave all been
of the smear type:

On “On the subj ect of bulletins; when would you be able to write another one, and
what subject would you be covering. Also would like for you to write the foremat

bulletins betveen 10 to 12 pages long. The only original bulletin we have put-out
so far is the one you wrote on lock picking. Iam fairly good at stealing material
_ and rewriting it, but have trouble writing anything orginal,

“Would like to set-up another meeting with you in the near future. ‘There are

SECRET ARMY ORGANIZATION 7
SPECIAL BULLETIN |

As most of the citizens of San Diego County are no doubt aware many liberals, pinks,
veds, and other fuzzy thinking types. will be bringing themselves and there gas masks here
in August for a "peaceful" protest during the Republican National Convention.

While local left-wing groups are preparing for the "peaceful" protest by stock piling
gas masks, flak vests, firearms and ammunition the city of San Diego is rolling out the
red carpet ( aptly named ) for these profession revolutionaries, Yes, as strange as it
may seem some members of the San Diego City government are going out of their way to
make sure these communist revolutionaries are made welcome here.

Mavourneen O'Connor, twin sister of City Councilwomen MAUREEN O'CONNOR
_ (Home address: 5821 Lauretta, San Diego, Telephone; 295-8693), is one of the more
prominent members of the community who is engaged in this strange behavior. Miss
O'Connor is employed by the Southern California First National Bank as a Community
Relations officer, taking time off last year to run the campaign of her sister Maureen.

Her new duties are setting up a central headquarters for the protestors to use during
the convention. The Unconventional Center (also aptly named) is to be this headquarters.
| Located at the corner of Jefferson and Riley Streets just six blocks from the Sports Arena
"the site of the convention, the 7,800 foot warehouse is being stocked with the expected
services that may be needed by the protestors. These include; transportation, facilities
for the printing of propaganda, a telephone message center, legal aid services, anda
medical aid center. These last two are odd, considering its to be a "peaceful" protest.

The bill for all this is being picked up by the Southern California First National
Bank who's chairman is ROBERT OSCAR PETERSON (Home address: 567 Gage Lane,
San Diego, Telephone: 222-4835). Mr. Peterson has not always been a supportet of
these left-wing type activities, in fact as late as January 1970 he was on the recciving
end of a smear article done by the San Dicgo STREET JOURNAL. The Street Journal
for those citizens lucky cnough not to have seen an issue is one of many pro-communist
underground newspapers that operate in the San Diego area.

\ ;
The article on Peterson exposed his business dealings with a number of large com-

panies; Foodmaker Corporation (owners of Jack In The Box drive-ins), and the Ralston

Purina Corporation among others, At the end of the article the Street Journal made the

NW v ositaersenlsduben-e-eujau article would expose other of his business dealings.



e
sy in

Needless to say, the article never appeared. One can only wonder now that Mr.
Peterson is supporting these same type of people if some kind of blackmail was not used.
Many of the members of the staff of the Strect Journal live at a commune supported by
the paper at 173 4th Avenue in Chula Vista.

The first news conference of the Unconventional Center was attended by these noted .
prominent city officials: Councilmen Gil Johnson and Jim Bates, and city manager Kimball
Moore. Others not quite so prominent attending were a long haired representative from |
the Community Congress and Shari Whitehead, 24, a representative from the Convention
Coalition. The Convention Coalition is the group that plans to coordinate the activities of
protestors expected to arrive for the convention. While Mayor Wilson was not able to

attend this meeting in person he later made this comment on Mavourneen O'Connor's pro-

demonstration activities "I commend her for her energy and her efforts ".

Of all the organizations preparing to protest at the convention the Convention Coal-
ition is probably the most active. Some of the leaders of the coalition are; Peter Bohmer,
” the off again, on again, economics professor at San Diego State, seen recently at 4931
Coronado Street, San Dicgo; Michael Kenneth, address 3777 Fairmont, San Diego; Pam
Williams, also seen at the Coronado Street address: and last, but not least, Doug Porter,
recently seen at 2445 Albatross, San Diego. Headquarters for the coalition are at 309
6th Street in San Diego. : 7

While the Intelligence Branch of the San Diego Police Department has reported to
city officials the militant activities (stock piling weapons and explosives) of these leftest
groups the city fathers have annoy all warnings. Instead of spending every dime the
city can spare on weapons and equipment to help the police put down a possible riot the
powers to be believe the money can better be spent for SENSITIVITY TRAINING.

While the left is planing a full scale'battle the public officials of San Diego spend the
tax payers money on sensitivity training for the police department. And guess who they
pick to teach this garbage, a foreign born (Iran) Professor of Psychology who was kicked
Off the staff at San Diego State because of his profanity and teaching of lefi-wing views.
JAUAD EMAMI was a Assistant Professor at SDS before having been removed, he and
his wife Minou live at 3850 American Avénue in La Mesa, ‘The 5°10", 190 pound, black
hair; brown eye professor was educated at UCLA and the University of Arizona. Emami
drives a white van (California ZMJ 481) and is payed $25 an hour to teach our policemen
to talk nice to these creeps that will he invading San Diego in August,

- Instead of hiring this fuzzy headed professor the SAO believes the City of San Diego
should have hired Licutenant Cally, then at least the police would have received some
expert training on how to handled RED TRAITORS, 7

SECRET AREY ORGANIZATION
GENERAL HEADQUARTERS

Dear Fellow American,

At the request of a mutual friend we are sending you this invitation to
Join the Secret Army Organization. _ Those of us who have been members for
some time sincerely believe that our organization can be of real value in pre-
serving for future generations the land of freedom and opportunity which our
forefathers handed down to us.

It is the belief of our organization that the communist-socialist con-
spiracy has infiltrated the United States Government to such an extent that the
American people cannot rely on this country's elected leaders. to protect them
from communist domination and slavery. 7

7 We believe that the time will come when the American people will have
to fight for their lives and their liberty. In this belief, we have formed in
advance a secret underground army with but one objective, to defend our con-
stitutional republic and to help our fellow Americans to do the same.

We do no want lukewarm members. We are an organization of people
willing to make any sacrifice necessary for our country. If you feel the same
way, we invite you to join us. et eens

History of @e Secret Army OrganiMMon

One carly morning in February, 1970, a group of six Minutemen leaders from
four states met secretly in Northern Arizona to discuss the crisis that the arrest and
imprisonment of two top M:nutemen leaders and the assassination of a third had }
brought on the organization. Although some of these men had met before in their roles

_ a8 Minutemen group leaders, others were meeting for the first time.

After much discussion, two principal points were agreed upon. First, that the

Minutemen as a national coordination organization of militant right-wing groups had

. effectively been destroyed by the pro-communist ciements inside the Justice Depart-

ment, While individual units still existed throughout the country, few had the financial

support or leadership to be really effective. Second, that the need for such a coordi-

nating organization wasgreater than ever in view of the increased revolutionary activity
by communists in the United States. _

With these two points in mind, suggestions were put forward on a course of

action to be followed. After a meeting that lasted all that day and far into the next

. morning, an overall plan of action was finally agreed upon. All present agreed to
merge their individual units together and form a new organization under the command

of one leader elected from among themselves, with the other five to be members of a

General Staff that would advise and assist the new leader. |

While retaining the basic programs and policies of the Minutemen, it was i
decided that not only should this new organization have a different name, but also a 4
completely new chain of command and organizational structure. If the new organiza— H
tion was going to survive the attacks that befell the old one, a whole new approach

would be needed. Never again could the arrestor death of a few leaders be allowed to i
cripple the entire organization. : 7 H

For this reason it was decided that only a highly disciplined military type
orgainization with a definite chain of command would have any chance of success. This
then, was the beginning of the Secret Army Organization. Beginning with an original
force of hard corepatriots that numbered fewer than two hundred, the Secret Army
Organization began the job of picking up the pieces and continuing to fight for national E
and individual freedom. Using this cadre of dedicated personnel as a nucleus, the

8. A.O, has been recruiting and training new members in the skills they will need as if i
|; the freedom fighters of tomorrow.

The leaders of theS, A. O. have no idea of fighting a last ditch stand. We have '
no desire tocommit Suicide ourselves or to let our members do so. We have a i
strategy which we believe will ultimately lead to victory. Only one thing is essential.
We must start preparing and training NOW! We of the S. A. O. believe that our country
- is worthy of any sacrifice. If you fecl the same way, we invite you to join us.

pective Members Of The @
SECRET ARMY ORGANIZATION

.
The Secret Army Organization is the most active, most complctcly dedicated and
most selective in its membership of all the many patriotic organizations in Amorica.
We are willing to make any sacrifice for our country and we fully expect that some of
us will have to make the ultimate sacrifice before victory is achieved. Our very lives
depend on each other. There is no place in this organization for bunglers, playboys or
lukewarm conservatives. If you join the Secret Army Organization, there might easily
come a time that your life would depend on how competently some other member had
- learned his job.

Unless you are “especially well informed on the domestic and world political
situation, it is probable that you have a lot to learn about the present threat our nation
faces. Unless you have had many years experience in actual underground warfare,
there is undoubtedly a lot you can learn from the experts in our organization who have
developed and supervised our training program.

OUR NATION IS IN IMMEDIATE DANGER

It is possible that withina very few years, perhaps even within months, our

” nation could be conquered and enslaved by the communisis. To prevent this we must

know aS much as possible about our enemies. Unless we know who they are and what
they are doing we will not succeed in our efforts to maintain a free America.

THE RESISTANCE MOVEMENT

In driving an invader from your land ‘the resistance involved goes through three
stages of development,

1) The Underground Network
2) Active Guerrilla Warfare
- 8) Open or Conventional Warfare

The conventional warfare stage uses everything in the way of weapons that the
enemy does but must also have active guerrillas and underground agents working against
the enemy, too. In the present state of military tactics conventional warfare cannot
succeed unless these other two ingredients are used vas hvunianaan de

The first step is to form an underground network. An active guerrillasystem
” must have the support of an underground network of approximately three times its own
size, This underground must supply the active guerrilla fighter with supplies, con-
cealment, information, cte. Anunderground network starts with departments o £
intelligence, security and propaganda in that order.

Sabotage, espionage, subversion, infiltration, escape and evasion, training,
“elandestine fabrication of supplics, counterfciting enemy documents, recruiting, com-
munications and propaganda are other phases of underground activity. Each member:
of the Sceret Army Organization, to be effective, must have a working knowledze of
all these tactics as well as the military tactics more commonly associated with guerril-

la activities.
NW 68262 Docld:32989523 Page 422°

ASSIGNMENT TO UNITS

Many people that inquire about membership in the Secret Army Organization
seem to have an idea that they will be immediately accepted into an active unit.
Look at it this way. Suppose you had spent a year or more carcfully recruiting and
training until you had a hard hitting team where every individual was reliable, dedi-
cated, and had confidence in his fellow unit members. Woulda‘t it make you mad to
have the national or regional organization assign some rank amateur to hae unit

_ that you you knew little or nothing about? _ _

Before any new member is assigned to an active unit or to an important under-
ground project, he mustundergo a period of training. During this training he will be
directed through the mails by an experienced member and some of his activities may

“be observed by other members without his knowledge. Oaly when a new member
proves himéelf to be conscientious, trustworthy, self-disciplined and able to operate
effectively alone will he be acceptedas a “secure member" and invited to participate
with other unit members in a teamwork operation.

EXPENSES

Unfortunately, most good things don't come cheap. Although we make every
effort to keep down the expense of memership in ‘the SecretArmy Organization, you
must expect to pay your own way, -

Dues to the Secret Army Organization are $3. 00 per month. This money is
absolutely necessary for use to maintain our central files and headquarters, for
postage and printing, to finance our extensive intelligence network, and to maintain
training areas,

Each member will have other expenses depending on the type of activity he is
engaged in. Every member will be expected to buy his own gun, ammunition and
| other basic combat equipment. During training the new member may be expected to

* buy certain books or subscribe to certain magazines that his work requires. During
this time the new member will also be supplied with reading material on the strategy
and tactics of guerrilla warfare. This home work will make it possible for him to
fit in quickly to an active unit and participate effectively in actual maneuvers,
marksmanship training, etc.

Following this preliminary training a memher may be either assigned to an.
existing unit, assisted in organizing his own unit if he has shown sufficient leadership
qualities or become part of an underground network.

: Upon your acceptance into the Secret Army Organization you will be given a
_ definite serics of projects described in writing so you will know exactly what will be
. expected of you.

We hope that you can succeed in this effort because -your country desperately
needs patriots at this time,

DESCRIPTION

FULL NAME: Richard Milhous Nixon. DATE OF BIRTH: January 9,1913 at Yorba Linda,
California. FORMER OCCUPATIONS: Used car salesman, law clerk, second rate congress~
man, and mediocre Vice President, PRESENT OCCUPATION: Professional liar and double
erosser (part time employment as United States President). WEIGHT: 170 pounds. EYES:
brown. HAIR: black. HEIGHT: 5'11", “RACE: White. NATIONALITY: Claims American
citizenship but actions prove this unlikely. LAST KNOWN ADDRESS: 1600 Pennsylvania
Avenue, Washington, D.C. (Rumored to have a California hideout. ) 7

CRIMINAL RECORD

RICHARD NIXON (alias Cry-Baby Nixon, alicas Tricky Dicky) is an expert in disguises and
has successfully passed himself off as an anti-communisi.in the past. He may again try using
this disguise if pressed for votes in 1972. Saying one thing, then doing the opposite is Nixon's
MOS. While he campaigned in 1968 on a platform of curtailing socialism he has in fact done
more to establish a socialistic dictatorship than either of the last two Democrat administra-
tions. His economic policies have continued to enrich Big Industrialists while rising prices
and higher taxes have all but reduced the average worker to a state of financial slavery. This
criminal has even made vicious attacks on small children (forced busing to acheive "racial
balance") and has caused the destruction of local school systems. WARNING: Nixon suffers
from an EMPEROR COMPLEX and becomes extremely dangerous when criticized.

CAUTION

Trickery and deceit are Nixon's trade~marks. At the present time Nixon and his chief hench-
man HENRY (CZAR) KISSINGER are engaged in forming an alliance with another gang of
criminals, the Red Chinese. The RED CHINA GANG have slaughtered an estimated fifty
million of their own people since coming to power. This Godless horde of’barbarians killed
thousands of Americans in the Korean War (shooting captured soldiers and starving and tor-
‘turing prisoners of war). The RED CHINA GANG have been supplying the NORTH VIETNAM~
ESE BANDITS with weapons and bullets to kill American soldiers in another no-win war in
. Vietnam. The very fact that Nixon is dealing with these ARCH ENEMIES OF FREEDOM is
enough to convict him of treason. DO NOT LET THIS CRIMINAL STEAL YOUR FREEDOM.

Mr. Belmont

FBI
659 Escondido Blvd.
Escondido, California

Dear Mr. Belmont:

Since: reading about the FBI files and records being stolen ‘by

' Radicals, I implore yay,.to either destroy my last letter about

“the Secret Army OrzaniZation or send it back to me, and not to keep
it in your regular files, if this is what is done with all-
correspondence. Also, it's hard to say who will be the next director
of the FBI, or whether he, or the people he appoints will be able to
be trusted--as J. Bdgar Hoover and his men. There will-never be

& man as good or competent as J. Edgar.Hoover. And I fear for the
safety of our Country, if and when he retirest (I do not trust Nixon,

I don't even respett him, and he is not, what many people used to
think he was.) :

If the SAO, are truly dedicated Counter-Revolutionary's, then they
are your only hope, and mine, and 1% would seem that every loyal
Police Officer and FBI agent in the U.S.Ae, would have to join in
the battle with us, shoub@ wo be taken over--or Civil War break oute
Therefore, it would be in your best interests to either destroy

_ the letter I gent inquiring about the SAO, (after talking to Nancy

Bera, of the Sheriff's Dept. Deputy B¥rd) I feel more confident, that
vl

ey are all I hoped they would be, and also, out to help the Police
and to protect them. : ' 7

Because of Govt! interference I'm sure the SAO wouldn't have wanted
me writing to you, not because they don't trust FBI agents or
JeEdgar Hoover {I'm sure) but because they know there are Red's high

up in the @ovt. and they don't trast ANY Atborney General's anymore ,,

-for which I don't blane them!t (Any Attorney General who would quit. -
to try to get Nixon elected, has to be very left of center--to put it
mildlyt Except for J. Edgar Hoover and you FBI agents, and tte
Conservatives-~Washington D.C. is rotton to the corslil!

Ne EE REE

.

I would nover betray the SAO, and I guess I ‘shouldn't have written to

“you about them, in case the FBI records get into the #wRONG HANDS, but

Zi just wanted to find out your professional opini

on on them, and also
find out, if I actually walked into a Red trap. :

March 7, 1972 ®

ZI sincerely hops you can indeed, have ny previous letter in regard -
te the SAO destroyed. If it ever got into enemy hands, which it j
surely would if a leftist were to be appointed as director of the FB,
I would be assasinated, and perhaps my children killed tso-.

Much to my shock the Neds already know sbout the SAO, (but HOW, I don't
know, as thoy maintain the utmost in secrecy and security.) and if

the Communksts. hate them, (or us) as much as. ee say they do, the
they. mst be wonderful psoplet ,

If the SAO are true patriots, with high principles and standards, and if
thoy have faith in God to deliver us from our brutal deadly enemics,
then I would de all I could to help them-«within the Law.

The only reason I revealed all this information to you, and to my

friends: in the San Diege County Sheriff's Dopt., is because, as I said

te Sgt» Paul Franklin, I know I can trust you, and we are on the same

gide. I never would have given this information to the Sheriff's Dopt,
Ef I didn't know him, and many of his men personally, and in fact I
worked on his campaign to elect him Sheriff, as did many a John

. Birch Society member, who mew for sure he was a loyal Americm, and
aman for LAY AND ORDER, and an Anti-Communist¢ By him, T mean

: Sheriff John Duffy.)

I asked Sgt. Franklin, to keep the SAO material out of the regular
1

filos. All we can do is HOPE, that the Sheriff's Dept., and other ,

| Law Enforcoment agencies aren't infiltrated with Rodst

After much studying and serious reflecting, I can see no hope fer
America, unless we ALL band together in a highly organized Counter-
Attack, in a strong purpeseful underground group and fight for cur

liberty and cur lives--or else be reduced to a satellite slave nation.

- Who could know the inside story better, than the top military men,
who are leading the Counter-Revolutisnary's? They were net allowed

te win the Korean or Vietnam wars, and had towatch sur fine young men

Gis--in vain. “(50,000 they! 6, in the Vietnam war, alone, not

to mention the Korean fiasco.) The bloed from these men--cries out

fer ‘justice, and for recompense, from the criminals who ordered them

to die--for nothing--or for the Viet Cong, or Soviet KGBL~ |

Surely God will grant eventual justice fer these men--as well as all

‘the murdered American Policemen, and those of the rest of the free

world also. The traitors should not ge freee

MAY GOD HELP US--

Very Respectfully,

‘Dear Honorable Sir:

ZI am seeking your expert advice, as to the SECRET ARMY ORGANIZATION,

and to whether or not it is within the Law, It is: a Counter-Revolutionsar:
. militant group. I have considered becoming active in it, if they are

truly what they claim to be. If, indgéed they ARE on the side of the

Police, and the F.BeI. Or, I'am wondering--could they be a Red trap? |

faey have sent me literature on electronic surveillance, counter-
revolutionary combat training, infiltration tactics, etc. :
I told them, if they “were on the side of the Police and FBI I:.wow
be glad to join them, they therefore sent me an applications (Which
at once verified that they were on the side of the Police and FST,
After I sent the application in, the thought davmed on me, that maybe
‘it's a trap. Maybe they are infiltrated, how do I mow?

Hre Belmont, we at war with Communism. It seems so tragic to me, that

we no longer have any ederal protection, because of the permissive
“eourts, and traitorous judges, and now, no death penalty even. :
What are those of us, who insist on living in freedom, the "Pursuit s
of Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness"~--supposed to do? k
Are we supposed to sit back and wait for the seeming inevitable e
| Seath warrant for those of us who have sworn to resist a takeover to

In my profound grief ¢ heartache, and frustrat@n over our
National situation, I“Mave joined this Pro-Ameri: militant groupe

The SECRET ARMY ORGANIZATION. cee EEE i

But, I repeat--are they really Pro-American, or have I walked into
& TRAP? The Communists have succeeded in causing_unprecedented
SUSPICION and FEAR, in our once great and glorious Nation. Now

we are reduced to suspicious and wary warring factions--a CIVIL WAR!

As I have said before--I would rather that we (my children and I) die,
than to live under Communism. (The next world, with God, will be
better than this one anyway) :

If Red China is going to take us over (and 1t looks like soon) then I'd
rather work in an underground Resistance movement--and die like a

true American with Red blood in my veins, instead of a yellow stripe
down my back. (Though I'm not saying I'm not scared--or maybe even
paranoid--by now!) ., ;

I never thoughtduch a disgusting thing would happento our beloved
America. Truly, it looks like the days of the Vigilantes--has
been forced upon us--{probably deliberately!)

Many people I imow, are confused, terror stricken, and "their hearts
failing them for fear.” :

In my present economic situation I suppose I have no right to
complain ‘about’ "big Governnent", bit=--the rights of the people, the
freedom's and the liberty are slipping away from us. Should we let
4% all go down the drain--without a ficht to the death?
Conservatives who are patriotic and love america have been silenced
and even persecuted for their beliefs. - :

{I realize you know all this.)

Religion, God, and the Bible is now being attacked,as is ‘the sanctity
of the home. 7 7 :

I joined this group{S.A.0.) in the belif, that they are Pro-American,
Pro-Police, and Pro-FBl, : :

‘May I please hear from you (I also wrote to Sgt. Paul Franklin, of
Vice & Intelligence.) as since doing some reflecting and pondering
over the literature they sent me, I am wondering if.I did the right
thing, or if I did walk into a TRAP.

It is my profound desire not do anything that would be frowned upon
by the true American FBI or truly dedicated Police. (I'm sure MCST:
of them can be trusted--but I am now begining to wonder if the SAO
believes this.) 7 zl

there has to be something wrong with them, and in that case, I want

something like this. Right? Z-don't see what choice you will have.
Otherwise they will kill all of you.e Please don't let that happen.

No matter what our status in life, or economic bratket, everyone of us,

REPORT OF JEROME
February 6, 1970

.

: I talked tO,BILL CLAY last night. He has
‘peén out of touch since last Friday night, and could
not be reached by telephone and was never at home
when I went by. + eee

Apparently some member of the Minutemen
Qrganization or another right winger is being watched
or surveilled and CLAY is quite ‘excited about it. He
thinks the FBI is doing the watching and he wants to place
a surveillance on the San Diego FBI Office for the pur-
pose of determining the times of arrival and departure
of the employees and obtaining the descriptions and
license plage number of FBI automobiles. He is going
to try to get several people together who will be able
to spend time watching the FBI Office.

REPORT OF JEROME
February 5, 1970

I learned stoday that FRANK YAKOPEC found a

. @ea@ skunk on the road yesterday which: he picked up,
placed in a cardboard box, which he then wrapped in a
‘plastic bag, and born paper on the outside. He mailed

- this package from the Dél Mar Post Office yesterday

addressed to JAN DIEPERSLOOT at the Peoples Commune.

He was told that the Minutemen are going
oC try to begin printing a news leaflet that publi-
cizes names and activities of interest amoung the left
wingers.

I talked to PAUL RUPLINGER this morning

who said h@ would like to get some kind of harassment
«going again against Professor MARCUSE at UCSD. RUPLINGER
also said that his son PETER RUPLINGER has a close
personal friend who he knows has been informing on both

left and right wingers for the FBI, for about a

year. RUPLINGER said he intends to make this person's
name known to a number of people so as to destroy his
activities as an informant. : - SESEEEEESE

\ I attended the CHC planning meeting in Balboa
Park last night. I-got there at about 7:10
. but the meeting did not get going til 7:35.
There were approximately 50 to 60 people present,
‘The meeting was chaired by the Reverend BILL COATS,
-I saw FREITJOF THY GESON * there however, he left early,
in disgust.

I also recognized ALAN STANCLIFF, SYLVIA
SHAPIRO and BERNIE SENTER in the crowd, ‘Also present
Fi was a young white individual in his early 20s with long
{ dark brown hair, He was wearing a fatigue jacket with
i red stars on the collar, . I heard him refer to as "tLoen" (Lowe ff
! and he said he was a representative of the San Diego Ba
Street Jounal,

ret eH

Two other persons who spoke at the meeting
claimed to be representatives of MDM, One wes a clean
cut white male with a military look, medium build, about
5'9" tall, He has light colored hair and wearing a Mao-
tse-tung style quilted cap, The other was also about
5'9" tall, medium build, long blond hair-who wore-gold . .
rimmed glasses; a red jacket and camouflage pants,

It was decited there would be city wide peace
activity. during the week of April 13 to 18, 1970. However,
there was a lot of arguments and backbiting as to whether
the actual peace march should take place on April 15 or
April 18, 1970. Jt was agreed the march should probably
start at noon and that it would be a flop if less than
8,000 people showed up.

The MDM representative with the Mao tse-tung
cap was screaming that people from the military and people
with jobs could not come of the rally was held on the 15th,
a Wednesday, and finally the MDM and Street Journal people
walked out of the meeting. After they left, there was
some discussion about a possible compromise where the rally
would be held on Wednesday evening ana servicemen would
be bussed to it,

Before they left, the people from the Street
Journal announced that they had moved into new offices
put were evicted the same day after the police department
talked to their new lanilord. They said that they had an
offset place which they would use to make posters for.

ue (Lowell Bere wan )

f : "LLOYD" from tHe Street Journal predicted
a there would be a breakup in San Diego in the near
3 future due to police department harassment,

5 During the meeting, it was announced that there
fl , would be efforts madé to organize a city wide student
strike at high schools on April 15, 1970,

It was alSo arinounced that MDM would have a
“mock trial of the military on April 1, 1970, which will be
composed of ell duty GIs and with MARK LANE as prosecutor,

It vas eventually decided that the April demon-
stration would again consist of a march from downtown San
Diego to a rally in Balboa Park,

2 People were asked to volunteer to work on the

various planning committee.
One interesting thinl§ that occurred was a

speech by a man from the audience who claimed that
the November 15, 1969, demonstration in San Diego
was nothing more than a disorganized mob, He said
the planning for the peace demonstration was all wrong
and that the demonstration should be held on a weekend so
workers could join in, He said the people at the meeting
should due as had been doe where, he said, groups of
30,000 to 40,000 workers had been organized to march down
the streets ghanting.

There were no colored people at the meeting.

7 A demonstration began today at San Diego State
College and students from the school took over part of

the administration building and at one time there were
close to 700 students there with more expected to arrive
after 4:00 p.m, when classes were out. It has the earmarks
of lasting for a long time, is

The demonstration was touched off at about noon
by a speech given by KARL KELLER at a rally on the library
loan. The students are protesting administrative action
taken by the school against four professors there.
fi Food including apples, oranges, carrots, punch
and loaves of bread is being passed around in the building
and is apparently being prepared at the Wesleyan Foundation
Building. Signs have been put up in the building indicating

that the restrooms have been "liberated" and are now co-educational

Some marijuana was seen being passed out free. About 100
students have elected to stay over night and are going home
in shifts to obtain sleeping bags and other items.

The demonstration appeared to be well planned and
some organizers, including RHETTA ALEXANDER for one, were
seen communicating with walkie-talkies. Other persons
observed taking part in the demonstration wae RON BREEN,
STEVE NYSTROM, BERNIE SENTER, ALAN STANCLIFF, SUKUMO and

I stopped by State College about 11:00 p.m. last
night. There were about 75 students in the halls of the
administration building who were painting 30' long banners
and placing them on the walls of the administration building.
They were also printing leaflets announcing a rally at noon
today m campus. LEON NOWER was observed there holding hands
with a young girl. BERNARD STREIFF, the french student
who claims to have participated in the french student
revolt, was also there.

I met.an interesting individual at BILL CLAY's
house last night, He is,called "The Judge" and his
first name is JERRY, He is about 5'10", to 5111" tall,
230 pounds, has heavy built, ruddy complexion and is
‘%5-45-years old, He has black heir which is receding,

@ pug nose, round face and héavy’ jowels, He carries
@ brown and 32 automatic pistol and is apparently
an excellent shot,

He said he spent 8 years in military intelligence
following which he worked for the CIA and then for the FBI
at San Diego as an informant, He claimed he was a paid
assassin for the CIA, He seemed to be highly intelligent
and I was told he was good at make-up and voice imitations,
He said he had Worked at Hollywood as a bit player,

He claimed that when he worked for the FBI
at San Diego, he was assigned to watch”TROY HOUGHTON
and that he quit at about the time of the Watts riot
in LosAngeles. He said he was never a close acquaintance
of HOUGHTON but he had followed HOUGHTC:! a lot and
came to the personal conclusion HOUGHTON was a Communist, .._
He seems almost to have convicted CLAY of this also.

As CLAY stated, he had verified that HOUGHTON
had been meeting some known members of the Communist
Party. BUSH and CLAY were thinking DE PUGH may have
become aware of this and had HOUGHION eliminated, If
this is so, CLAY said he was thinking about contacting
DE PUGH and humbly apologize for == trying to break away
from the national MM organization,

“The Judge" is supposed to be from Virginia, although
he has no accent, and apparently hates colored people. He
speaks fluent German and Spanish.

CLAY stated he believes one of. the leading Leftists
in the area is MORRIS KOMINSKY who lives at. 400 East Franklin
Street, Elsinore, California, He has written a book which
is peing advertised in papers like the Free Door and the
Street Journal, KOMINSKY allegedly moved in high circles
in the Federal and local Governments at one time and has
supposedly been visited on numerous occasions, high placed
Government people, including Congressmen, Senators, and Presi-
dents such as TRUMAN, EISENHOWER, and KENNEDY.

CLAY said he wants some local Right Wing neonle
to visit KOMINSIY ana somehow get his signature,

Today, I went yith "The Judge" to see MORRIS
KOMINSKY, KOMINSKY is an.order man, 60-70 years of age,
about 5'9" tall, curly black hair which has a lot of gray
‘jin it, blue eyes, He weights 160-170 pounds, has poor
posture, as he slouches and kas a pot belly, From his
statements, I gathered that he is very much in favor of
what the San Diego Street Journel is doing. He said he
gave all his records to the Street Journal and claimed
that it took 5 Street Journal staff members 8 hours to
copy his notes of the San Diego area alone, He claimed
he had much more information on Right Wing activities
in America and claimed he has spent five years researching
information for his new book which will be called "Count
Down, USA," He ,said the first volume of this book which
will be an expose on fascism in the United States, will
be 800 pages long and the second volume will be 1200 pages
long. He seemed to be pleased to talk about his work and
as we reported ourselves to be fans of the Street Journal,
opposed to fascism, he talked quite freely,

He told us of contacts he has in the San Diego
Police Department, of the San Diego District Attorney's
Office, and also claimed to have a source of information
in the San Diego FBI Office,

KOMINSKY said he formerly had high pleced friends
in Government and claimed he had been visited at his home
in Elsinore by Presidents of the United States such as
TRUMAN, EISENHOWER, and KENNEDY. :

ON MAY 8, 1970,

Today, I vent to a meeting at the Greek
Bowl at State College ‘to find out about the march route
for the anti-war demonstration to be held tomorrow,
There were about 60 people in attendance at the meeting
which started about 3:00 Pi, These included BILL COATS,
ALAN STANCLIFT, FREITIOF, THYGESON, GARY GULLEY, JACKQUELYNE
TUMBURG, and a reverend from the Wesleyan Foundation.

There was a big hassle about the choice of ths
march route; the CMG wanted to march from Horton Plaza in
downtown San Diego, along Broadway to the llth Naval District
Headquarters for some speeches and then to the old ferry
Janding for a rally,

SMS apd the other students voted this down and
CMC almost walked out. A long debate followed resulting
considerable uneasiness between CMC and SMC, ALAN STANCLIFF
was selected as monitor captain, : .

Afterwards, I went with BILL CLAY to Grossmont
College where another anti-war rally was taking place and
picked up some leaflets, which are attached.

We noted that they were passing out free food,
BILL CLAY went and got some syringes and FRANK YACOPEC
bought some pickles which were injected with rubbing
aleohol and castor oil and were passed out to the students
who were seen eating ehea It is not noted if any of
them became ill, :

FRANK YACOPEC set fire to a trash can in a rest-
room to cause a little extra excitement. After this, we
drove by the People's Commune and saw three male individuals
wearing Army helmets,

5/9/70 : .
by Jerome ae

Today, approximately 5,000 people, mostly ‘Long

shairs and hippies participated in an anti-war march and

demonstration in San Diego. They marched from the downtown
area to Balboa Park where a rally was held. It was noted
that MDM marchéd as a separate unit in the demonstration
and was trying to cause trouble.

BILL CLAY, who was present recognized two “long
hair" Minutemen in the middle of the MDM group trying to
rabble rouse. CLAY had mobilized between 100 and 200
right wing ‘individuals and there appeared to be a lot of
wight wing agitation. There also appeared to be about the
same number of Marines out waiting for a fight and several
were seen in front of the Federal Building holding coke
bottles and waiting for the hippies to come along.

I was told that the demonstration march was stopped
at the 5th Avenue Bridge over Interstate Highway 5 and that
BILL CLAY and his friends were the ones who stopped it.

BILL CLAY got into a discussion with FREITJOF
THYGESON, who appeared to be very disgusted with the repetitive
nature of the demonstration and the location of the march.

Persons observed present at the demonstration
included HERBERT MARCUSE, BILL MILSON, WARREN NIELSEN,
PETER CARTWRIGHT, BILL COATS and ALAN STANCLIFF.

SYLVIA SHAPIRO was the Master of Ceremonies and
STUART INNERST was the main speaker. JAN DIEPERSLOOT and
RON BREEN also spoke. Dr. GEORGE ABBOTT was also there and
had organized an emergency medical corps * using walkie-talkies
and with ambulances available. ‘

Iwas talking to BILL CLAY last Saturday.
He seemed agitated and sgid he had néeded to use a
lot of caution, He said however, he wanted his name
used and known as the local Minutemen (MM) leader
‘and that he wanted this done to attract Federal
attention in order to protect someone else in the
background,

. He is still talking about a new Right Wing
organization and claimed to have contacts with groups
in 11 western states and said these people are trying
to establish a communications network and said the
name American Resistance Movement (ARM) had been
selected for this organization,

.

, CLAY got to talking about DE PUGH and said he
had been aware of DE PUGH's whereabauts when he was in
hiding. He said he now has reason to believe TROY HOUGHTON
may still be alive and probably connected with ARM. He
said he believes HOUGHTON may have wanted out of the MM
organization, for some reason, and had to disappear to do so,

CLAY also talked about setting up’a meeting with
the Leftist student group at University of California at
San Diego during the regular week and he would like himself,
BARRY GODFREY, .SAM DAVIS, and GEORGE HOOVER to meet with
four students from that group.

I have learned that HOOVER always carries a
savage .380 pistol when he is away from home. DAVIS
usually caries a .380 or ,22 automatic pistol, CLAY
usually has a ,22 automatic pistol, FRANK YACOPEC always
has a ,32 MAB, "The Judge" (JERRY BUSH) usually has a
~380 automatic pistol, and PETER RUPLINGER carries a
222 MAP,

It has been learned that BARRY GODFREY and FRANK
YACOPEC are going to see BILL CLAY this morning at about
11:00 a.m. to Jisten to a vight wing Speaker at UCSD.

This Friday GODFREY is supposed to help CLAY
move to his new apartment in Pacific Beach.

The photograph of ALDEN EDWARD WILLIS is not
familiar, but the one of GEORGE HOOVER is. HOOVER previously
had a goatee beard, but has now shaved it off. In person
‘he looks much meaner and heavier than he appears in the
photograph, He always has the same wide-eyed expression on
his face. :

It has been learned that BARRY GODFREY has been
picked by the San Diego Fire Department to go to a school. on
- bombs and explosives and he will probably be 6n the new
fire department bomb disposal squad.

It has been learned that with the help of BARRY
GODFREY, BILL CLAY moved last Friday, June 5, to his new
apartment at 4113 Ingraham, San Diego. This is supposed

to be Ingraham’ Villae~ No one is supposed to know about this
address. CLAY had a large quantity of personal belongings
and junk to move and has rented a garage near Second and
Ivy (between Ivy and Juniper on the east side of Second
there is a row of four garages and CLAY has the second from
the left) where he is storing some of this stuff.

. oty It was also learned that GEORGE HOOVER was at BILL
CALY's -new apartment Friday evening and was in a talkative
mood as he was dead drunk. HOOVER apparently works at the
same place as SAM DAVIS. HOOVER said DAVIS was recently

in Texas on vacation and coming back his automobile broke
down at Gila Bend, Arizona, and HOOVERIm@d to go out there to
assist him. Their boss at the fence-company, is also supposed
to be a Minutemen and HOOVER and DAVIS are probably getting
some of their explosives from the fence company.

HOOVER now uses a .45 Automatic Pistol which he even
takes to bed with him. He claimed his boss recently put
up $400 to get him out of some legal trouble.

HOOVER Said he had been living with a girl (NFI)
who in the recent past, kad walked out on him and wad said
she was going to contact the FBI. HOOVER seemed to be
worried about this.

HOOVER was getting more drunk all the time and
began rambling about “the ranch" where he lives. He said he
had just moved out of the hotel into one of the smaller
houses on te ranch. He kept talking about his horse and
asked CLAY to call "WILLIE" at the ranch and ask him to feed
the horse. .

pore’

| NW 68262 Docld:32989523 Page 575



“ HOOVER uses the nickname "Mick" and usually

hangs out at the "341 Club" on Second Street in El Cajon.

, He also kept talking*‘about a ROGER who went with him to
get SAM DAVIS. This ROGER may live or work with HOOVER.

During thé evéning CLAY approached HOOVER about
doing something to PETER CARTWRIGHT for spilling the beans
on the undercover police officer named JOHN MURRAY.

It was also learned that many Minutemen, knowing
that law enforcement officers are prone to handcuff people
behind their backs, are now carrying handcuff keys attached
to the inside rear waist band of their pants where they
ean avoid being detected in a frisk.

Lad

. Attached is a copy of the May issue of a new newspaper
named "The Orange County True Press" which is being printed

by right wingers in the Santa Ana and Anaheim area. The

names of these people appear in the newspaper. The paper:

was acquired from JERRY TARTAGLIO through FRANK YACOPEC,

Bee I have learned that BILL CLAY has been approached

‘ by a group of leftist students at University of California
.at San Diego who are allegedly fed up with the left wing

, tactics which have been-used at University of California
at San Diego and are supposed to want to form an alliance
with right wing groups and individuals to deal with the

| Government. BRILL CLAY seems to be enthusastic about such

| an alliance as he feels there ib a consideabk amount of

agreement between right and left wing groups as to the

goals they would like to achieve and their general disillu-

sionment with the Government and the established order.

CLAY is giving the matter careful thought and may recon-

tact this group of students at a future time.

An acquaintance, ARTHUR HANSEN, told me today
‘there is a house at 711 Fern Glen, La Jolla, about two
houses from HANSEN's home which is occupied by "three
weirdo men" who live, there together. They have many
‘stop signs, apparently stolen from intersections around
town which they have nailed to the fence in their back
yard, HANSEN said he recently observed one of these men

in the back yard at 711 Fern Glen wearing a housecoat and
ared wig.

HANSEN also told me that the night bdbre the
"pig invasion" of La Jolla, his sleep was disturbed by
loud noises,at approximately 3:00 a.m. and looking out
his bedroom” window he saw many cars arriving in front of
the house at 711 Fern Glen to the point that the street
was filled up with cars. He said each car carried two
to five male individuals and he estimated a total of 50
to 60 people entered the house at 711 Fern Glen. HANSEN
said he watched this incident until approximately 5:00 a.m.
when he went back to bed and as yet none of the individuals
had left the house. He said, however, when he awoke the
next day the cars appeared to be gone. HANSEN thought
this incident might have had some connection with the yippie
invasion of Ia Jolla the following day.

oF REPORT BY JEROME
on July 8, 1970.

‘ ’
.

I was at JERRY GEYER's house on the evening
‘of July 6, 1970. GEYER,said he was given some gun
“parts by a person named "DOG" who is an ex-serviceman
and a friend of LYLE NANNING, GEYER said according to
DOC, these parts belonged to SAM DAVIS and SAis was
suppose to get” in touch with him later about the parts.
The parts are for a World War II German automatic
assault rifle and are illegal to own. G#YseR said
following this a person who gave his name as SAM
WILLIAMS called on the telephone and asked about some
other gun parts, GEYER recognized the voice, however
as being that of SAli DAVIS and GEYER is now suspicious
‘of DAVIS because he does not know what he is uo to.
He said DAVIS was looking around for 50 H-2 Trip Levers.

; It has been rumored’DAVIS is paying high,
prices for guns and gun parts but is selling low to
TOM FORREST, FORREST is the biggest gun dealer in town,

REPORT BY JS201G
On August 7, 1970.

.

as Yesterday, August 6, 1970, I went to watch
.the National Yippie Day et Disneyland. any long hairs
and hippie type peonle were at the gate and parking lot
“all day long but there were never enough there at one
time to make a big crowd and most left after milling
around for a while, It appeared that they just did not
have enough money to get in.. 7

FRANK YACOPEC, JaRRY TARTAGLIO anc others got
in using Press Cards from the Anaheim Bulletin. Also there
was ZUGZNE BROWN from the’ Or Press, STEVE
FRANKS froy VIVA and many other right wingers Frou the
Orange County area. The group took several hundred photo~
‘gra’ “Ss and shot two rolls of movie films.

|
1
i
:
|

The only serious incident occurred at about
6:30 p.m., woen 300 or 400 yippies got together and started
ae marching from place to place in Disneyland. There weve
several scuffles with the police who were called in at
about 7:00 p.u., and one girl was-yelling "Kill the Pig,
Kill the Pig."

The yippies made an attempt to tear down the
flag in the fort put JERRY TARTAGLIO and “CHUCK" stood
against the flag pole and stopped them,

One of the apparent, leaders of the yippies was
about 45 years old with long hair and beads, He got into
a scuffle with the police and a cop grabbed him by the
hair, which came right off showing him to be very bald.

It looked to me as if there would have been
serious trouble if the yippies had been able to get a few
-more people in there. However, they backed right down
when they were confronted by the police. A lot of threats
were made and obscenity used.

During the day I noted about six yippies in front
of the gate with 15 - 20 ticket books passing out tickets
to other yippies to get in, Someone put out a lot of
money for a lot of yippies to get in.

After the’ ve thrown out, there
was some rock throwing f sate and an attenpted
. march on the Disneyland Hotel which the police broke
: up. It was later announced that people with long hair
5 “would no longer be allowed admittance into Disneyland.

REPORT BY JUR0M@
August 27, 1970

,

. This morning I was talking to General WILLIAM
LEMLY who lives at 1536 Glorietta Place, Coronado.

‘He claimed to have been part of a Military underground

-organization since 1927, which was strong because of
fears in the Military of Communist takeover in this
i country.

-

He told me that AVG actually stands for

American Volunteer Government. He explained that
: later on the organization felt a need for an above-
: ground front organization and so established the American
Volunteer Group, with i=DRIC "BUD" JOHNSON as the leaser
and with aft Advisory Council of 13 Hilitary officers.
‘These included Coanander BALDORF who refused to go to
Vietnam because the Government would not fight to win,
General "CHESTY" PULLER, General CUSTIS LG MAY, and
others, : oi

According to LaMLY, membership in American
Volunteer Groups was to be opened to civilians but - - --
restricted only to those referred to the organization
by the Military Council and those who were already
members. :

When "BUD" JOHNSON died, under mysterious
circuustances, JOHN ZEMANZC and his secretary, H&LEN
GRANT, took over. Z&xAWEC and GQANT then threw the
meabership open to the general public upon which the
Military Council dropped out, and as far as the Military
is concerned, that part of AVG is now defunct.

LEMLY told me that the name A, DUNN which
appears on old AVG bulletins and letterhead stationery
is a pseudonyi for a woman from Seattle, He said she

‘is an agent for a private investigative group which

has its headquarters on the east coast. This investi-
gative group is fun by a former FBI Agent named FRANK
CAPELO (pnonet i ) and investigates left wing activities.

CAPELO is suppose to be in the San Diego area
in the near future, and L&LY said he would +e
to him for possible eaployuent as an Agent on
coast.

.

LEMLY Sn stan that he fae ROBERT WELSH,

resident of the Nata
ee, which a front up for the John Birch
‘ Society. The ha exty Amend represents the

i elimination of income tax and LaiLY claimed he was

i testifying last week before a California State Senate
: Group about the amendnent.

I saw L&WLY on PAUL aUPLINGER's recomaendation,
LEMLY Sepaate he and PAUL: RUPLINGER ave also good friends
LELLY aga alked about the American Yoluntees Gove pnzent
and said one _puspase of the organizati is to bring
‘about a i ery coup in y it becomes
necessary. “He said the organization's headquarters
are located in or near Washington, D.c.

LEHLY said that JOHN ZEMANIC was formerly
Chief of Security of the above ground organization under
JOHUSON and his secretary, HELEN GRANT, was suppose to
be a teacher but LaMLY's group was never able to verify
this, L&uLY seid that because of the peculiar circun-
stances surrounding JOHNSON's death, his up did a
little investigating ard found that ZEMANSC wes a
Long Shormaa and belonged to HARRY BaAIDGES Long Shorman
Union, LEMLY said that ZEiiANEC might actually have
been a left wing infiltvrator.

LEMLY appeared to be very Militery, anti-left
inute-sen and way form an alliance with the
Minute-men in this area.

LEMLY who was in ONI for several years, also
_ claimed to have access to Canadian and British Intelligence
Reports f 1 over the world, through a friend who is
still in ¥ ngton, D.C.

After talking to LSHLY, I saw BILL CLAY wao
told me that he is now working in some big national
movement and can no longer spare the time to be deeply
involved in local Minute-men activities

FBI Letterhead Stationery, forms to fill out snowing
receipt of ne Corps Good Conduct Medals. He also
gave me a platé burner for making stencils for an
off set press.

CLAY said he would continue to give local
Minute-men any help and support necessary both here
and in othgr places and said he would set up a Post
Office Box in Las Vegas for the local Minute-Men group.

MPA REPORT BY J#2013
/ August 31, 1970

’
7 I found out this morning in talking with
DALE H@RSCHULER that the manager of Les Girls who was
ro / Supporting the F Door financially backed out two
_weeks ago and tne paper is now in trouble For tne
first time the Door is planning to charze for the
newspaper, they still may not have enough ney to
print it. They have decided to stop carrying sex
oriented adds in the paper.

I also learned that the Sunrise newspaper
2 lost at least $8,000 on the rock cone it sponsored

: and does aad have enough money to go on printing,

: i talked to General LEMLY of AVG again who .
{ “told me that "BUD" JOHNSON, former leader of AVG,
was in the process of putt ng together a big expose
on the Communist Party in the United States at che
7 time of his death, LILY said JOHNSON was getti
; his information from a former Military intelligence
Officer who was also connected with AVG. LELLY said
he and other officers in the Military part of _AVG
Suspect JOHN ZaMANEC may have had JO MSON Gone in and
the Military part of AVG is out to get ZEMANEG and
the civilian AVG organization if they can,

LEMLY claimed he and some right wing friends
were responsible for putting togetehr | and passing out
the leaflets announcing the “yippie Pig National Invasion
of La Jolla early in the summer, LEE SLY said althougn
they did not think anything would actually happen, it
turned out better than expected as many La Jollans
were turned against the left and have indicated
support for right wing activities,

The new Minut en stickers were printed at
Alex Rapid Print in La Mesa, California.

I learned this afternoon from Message Information
. Center that an unidentified group of individuals in the
, San Diego area is preparing for a large scale anti-Vietnan
war demonstration tomorrow during the festivities sur-
rounding the visit and State dinner of Presidents NIXON

pO According to MIC plans for the demonstration call
i for participants to gather in the Hotel Del Coronado
j parking let for a rally and march beginning at 9:00 A.M.

I have also learned that a large number of
right wing oriented individuals mostly older female mem-
bers of the John Birch Society. will also be present in
Coronado tomorrow to carry signs and protext against left
wing groups.

REPORT BY JEROME
On September 4, 1970

’ : i.
T went ove? to Coronado yesterday to
watch the parade in honor of President NTXON and
‘President ORDAZ and while there I noticed six
suspicious male indivi-uals, three colored, two
white and one Mexican, Tney were roaming through
the crowds trying to agitate and stir people up.
I followed them to the Del Coronado Hotel, They
finally got into a Pontiac with California license
KMY 364 and I saw one or two rifles in the car.
I imnediately contacted a California Highway Patrol
Officer who put this information out on his car
radio. 7

«

. According to PETER RUPLINGER, who was with
me, he previously observed one of these Negro males
acting as Master of Cermonies when ABBY HOFFMAN appeared
at San Diego State College to. speak several months

‘PORT BY J#ROME
On September 8, 1970

’
.

I was talking to PETER RUPLINGER this
. morning and he told me about DEPUGH holding some of.
_ the people in cagese when he was captured by the FBT.

PETER is no longer living with Professor
FRED AKERS and has tenuporarily rented an apartment in
El Cajon using the name DON FREZDMAN, He is going to
try to rent one or two Post Office Boxes using that
name,

PETER is suppose to get married October 23,
1970, and #i11 then rent an apartment in his own name.

PETER told me that he, PRANK YACOPEC and
BARRY GODFREY had a meeting to make out future right
wing strategy. It was decided that they would continue
to harassing left wing individual and organizations
but would avoid hurting anyone or getting involved in
any real violence, PETER said that he made contact
with a person named "TRAVIS" who he said is a lefty
but woo he is converting, PETER said TRAVIS told hia
on September 3, 1970, about a person named 2, J. WORK,
who lives on Lincoln Avenue who had infiltrated
activities for the left.

He also told me about an individual at the
University of California at San Diego where a construction
worker dropped a five gallon bucket of tar from the
fifth floor of the new hospital building into a group
of hippies. Apparently the bucket of tar broke and
Sprayed all over the hippies.

PAUL

BBP22 RUPLINGER, posing as a prospective
buyer, went to the house at 1362 Union Street, San
Diego, California, on September 2, 1970. Ue said he
found the place was divided into four apartments,
Some of which he did not see. He said he observed
nothing which might possibly have been connected with
YSA and added that the landlady told him she had
just told tne tenants to get out of one of the
apartments and had re-rented it.

REPORT BY JEROME
September 17, 1970’,

: I have learned that Message Information Center has
‘a comline or telephone extension to New Eéucasieonat Actul

Community at 1924 Island, MIC has a three digit als
switch board and gets an extremely large number of calls

:

every day. .

The head operator and the person who apparently
runs MIC is named PHIL PLYMATE, However, it looks to me
as though MIC is completely controled and directed by
New Educational Community.

I have learned that the keys to the MIC Office
are kept at 1924 Island. MIC is in operation every day
from 9:00 A.M., till midnight.

Iast night I tried to call LEON NOWER at his
home at about 11:00 P.M.; a babysitter answered the phone
and said he was not home, but in an emergency could be
reached at 43-5869, or ab We 2163.

While I was at MIC today I learned that MDM had
a new telephone installed today which is 234-1190, and
which is supposed to be kept confidential

REPORT BY JEROME
September 18, 1970

.
.

This morning I went to Message “Information Center,
‘arriving there at about 10:30 AM, Already there were TOM
HYDE and a young high school kid named STEVE (LNU) who was
jearning how to be a MIC operator.

I shot the breeze with HYDE for Se an hour.

He told me he is now Acting Co-ordinator for MIC. He said

*
_ there will be a change in MIC leadership as he, HYDE, will

be leaving in about a month. He did not say where he is
going. ; :

The former MIC co-ordinator, PHIL PLYMATE, is
supposed to be going to work full time with the San Diego
Street Journal. According to HYDE, both the Street Journal
and Sunrise are supposed to be out again in a few weeks.

HYDE said there will be mostly new people on the Street Journal
staff. :

HYDE also talked about MIC's "Fugitive File". This
file contains information on how to help deserters and draft
dodgers get out of San Diego. He said the file had been taken
out of MIC and hidden because many of the people connected

with this work had been questioned about it recently by the law.



Nw 68262 Docld:32989523 Pagé 624 7

| tel

He said that when things cooled down, the file

will be improved and put back into MIC. He said one of

“the things they pldnned to do is to ask anyone who calls

for help if he is a Federal Agent, thus hoping to trap him.
He also said that apparently some of the servicemen who
were helped in the past spilled the whole story about MIC
and other people when they got back to their Base.

I stayed at MIC until about one olclock. After
awhile HYDE left, and I spent the rest of the time showing
STEVE how to do the work. I received and gave out a lot
of weird messages. I was.-ableta.obtain the following
interesting information:

HYDE's telephone number is 582-8203. PLYMATE's
telephone number is 232-8657. New Adult Communities new
telephone number is 239-2119, and RICK PHELPS! new address
and emergency only telephone number _ 2810 31st Street,
telephone number 283-1934,

I agreed to pull another shift at MIC this Thursdey
from 1:00 to 5:00 PM.

f ’

/ .

BARRY GODFREY told me that he contacted

i 7 . BILL CLAY yesterday who gave him three boxes of A

. papers belonging to the SDS Group at the University
of California at San Diego. CLAY apparently got
them from one of the janitors out there.

CLAY has almost completed his pilots train-
ing and will get a pilot's license next month. After
that he intends to use his license to fly various places

i to carry on right wing activities.

Q «A possible new Minute-man member is WYNHAM
ov WYNDMAN ARTHUR HENS who lives at 1902 Guy Street,
in the Mission Hills area of San Diego, with telephone
number 298-4480, He and several other peoole including
a woman named LYLIA BUCK, a group from Scott norial
Baptist Church and a group from the Christin Anti-
Communist Crusade the leader of which is Dr, FRED
SCHWARTZ, are planning to go to the Victory march

in Washington, D.C., on October 3, L970. The group
from the Baptist Church is chartering an airplane

to fly there.

When I talked to BILL CLAY yesterday I told
him what I was doing at ilessage Information Center and
he suggested putting some kind of listening device on
the telephone theré. He said he would start experimenting
around at work today to see what he could come up with.

He told me he has gotten ahold of some new
three strand wire which is transparent to the eye and
can only been seen under certain lighting conditions.
He said this wire is being used in some expériments
at the University of California at. San Diego.

-who said he was a representative of the Committee to Free the

OCTOBER 5, e@ :

. I discretely observed the STP demonstration
last Saturday, The march and rally looked like a failure
to me because they only had 200 people participating when
they had announced that they expected 4,000 or 5,000 to
join in. : :

Iwas really surprised at the hostility of the
bystanders and onlookers toward the marchers. Many of
them were yelling "Communist", "Pigs", and "Go to Russia"
at the marchers, ‘The sailors and Marines along Broadway
were very menacing and several times I thought thexewere
going to be fist fights. : 7

The demonstrators did not stop at the 11th Naval
District Headquarters building or at the Police Department
headquarters but just walked id iauadactrae and shouting
obscenities. 7

There were three speakers for the rally at Newtown -
Park. The first was RON NIBBE, who apparently had just
been arrested by the police and talked about his arrest
and how it was unjustified. He said everyone should be

ood Communist comrades and buy guns. He said that the
deople should oppose and defeat the police and completely
eliminate them, He said it was unwise to seek community
control of the police asd by having them live in the communities
becuase then they would Imow what was going on all the time,

The next speaker was a young male Negro individual

Soledad Brothers. He said the Soledad brothers trial
is going to be moved to San Diego and that as much of the 7
committee as possible would also be moved to San Diego. He i
said however, that many people who belonged to and worked with

the committee up north won't be able to come to San Diego -f
and that the committee needs volunteers from the San Diego
area to carry on its work, I: didn't know what this person's |
name Was.

‘The last speaker Was CARLOS CALDERON who ata he
wanted to organize the Chicano movement and truth about
the great heritage of the Latinos and gave several examples !
such as CHE GUEVARRA with whom he apparently was very impressed.



It was announced that Experimental college
at San Diego State College is going to ini a workshop
* course on Communisn this fall. -

" At the rally, there was a guy going around
selling a copy of "Challenge" saying that it was a
Communist newspaper. I believe I heard someone call
him by: the name of MIKE, He was about 6'1" tall, 220
pounds, brown hair, receding at the forehead, 28 years
old. He was accompanied by a girl name KATHY, who is
apparently connected with Women's Liberation and PLP,
KATHY was about 5'5", in her early 20's, curly brown
hair, very slim build, These people said that there is
a new discussion meeting each Sunday on "Challenge"
and PLP and wrote down the address and phone number down
for me, 3993 Broadway , San Diego, telephone 263-1465,

: . FRANK YACOPEC was ‘also at the rally wearing an
ola felt had shot full of holes, a phoney FU MANCHU mustache
and a fatigue jacket. No one paid any attention to him. :

by Jerome 7 oe

JIM STEWART, the fellow who has in his possession
_ SYLVIA SIAPIRO's CMC mailing list, is about 19 years old, clean
cut, short hair, seems to be very intelligent and I believe
he is a student. He lives near the beach and it looks lil» he
is a person who is mainly responsible for organizing the anti-
war demonstration in San Diego on 10/31/70.

I heard some very interesting information about a
store at Julian named the Mountain Market Grocery. Apparently the
‘people at the-store are openly advising for the Minutemen «
organization and are selling minutemen and other right-wing
literature over the counter at the store, r#4e also told
that collections for DE PUGH's legal defense are also being :
taken at the store. I will probably got up there soon ‘and see
what's going on. a

I learned from BARRY GODFREY that GLENN MOORE picked uw a
hippie female hitchhiker earlier in the week. She was
apparently very radical, but MOORE got friendly with her and she
- told him that the recent fires-in the. mountains were mostly
set by leftists and were part of a leftist plot. Oe

I also learned that there is going to be a showing
of a film and a fund raising event at the Kent Theater on
10/15/70 to raise money and to make plans for the anti-war
demonstration on 10/31/70,

While I was at MIC today I learned about an individual
who is believed to be an undercover police officer by the
Leftists. This individual is 40 to 50 years old, has dark
greying hair, is unshaven and goes by the name BODINE or BOLIVAR
or some such similar name. Apparently he showed up several
weeks ago looking for a ride to the east coast. He claimed to
have been connected with ahfree school somewhere in California
and also at Santa Barbara. He always carries a sleeping bag
with him and "crashes" wherever he can. The people here have
peen checking on him and contacted the free schools at Santa
Barbara and in Colorado and found out that he wasn't known
there. This plus the fact that he is still around after having
looked for a ride to the east coast makes him ent he is

-with the police. .

I also saw and met PHIL PLYMALE. He is coe
weird looking and has a very strange beard and hair-do even
‘for the people at Message Information Center. He impresses

me as being very paranoid and is highly.suspicious of everyone. “_

Last Friday, XY went up to Julian to the Mountain
Market Grocery Store and met the owner, whose name is MARGIE —
MC NICKLES, MC NICKLES sells Minutemen, Ku Klux Klan and
other similar literature and material across the counter at
her store. canes
D She is also working with the Patriotic Party in San
iego and told me that she is going to try to form a dare debe
of the Patriotic Action Legion in San Diego.

i Her son is supposed to be President of the Young
Republicans Organization at Grossmont College.

She told me that ROBERT DE PUGH has been on trial
‘for all the Federal charges against him at Albuquerque, New
. Mexico, and has been held in the City Jail there. She’said .
DE PUGH was to have been sentenced on 10/9/70 and said that~
he was asking for a total of ten years each on nine separate
counts. : 7

MC NICKLES said that the jailors at the Albuquerque
city Jail are taking very good care.of DE PUGH as most of
them are-very sympathetic to him MC“NICKLES also made a
statement to the effect that if DE PUGH is sent to Leavenworth
. he will never get there which I took to mean that there may
| : be an escape attempt. = Guu senususssersS0e20U0er J00008 oy
; MC NICKLES also said that she knows JOHN ZEMANEC of
-AVG and GLENN JACKSON of the Patriotic Party at Los Angeles.
She showed me an open letter which DE PUGH wrote to ZEMANEC aes
telling him to get completely out of right-wing activities. ae
She also had some other stuff which she claimed to have just
recently received from DE PUGH.

: MC NICKLES also told me there is a commune at Julian
not far from her place. She said these people are long hairs,
but clean and drive nice cars. She said they moved in several
months ago paying $32,000 cash money for the house. She said’

: NW 68262 Docld:32989523 Page 646



NW 68262 Docld:32989523 Page 647 —

that although the former owner of the house told her he

sold the house to a woman she has seen only male individuals
at the house, She said there are only a few individuals who
stay at the ‘house during the week, but that several carloads

" of male individuals arrive each Friday evening and stay over

until Monday morning. She said she and her husband feel

that some kind of training is going on at the commune as

they have been able to hear radio Morse Code signals from the
eeatinnd in the evenings when the wind is right..

: She said the person who is always at the house which
is located on Whispering Pines Drive, drives a Car with
California License TXL 136 which also has a Yale sticker
on it. She said cars with.the following license plates” have
shown up there on the weekends:

It has been learned that BERRY GODFREY was
in contact with SAM DAVIS last Saturday. Apparently
he and GEORGE HOOVER and several other people are
planning to change their names, occupations and so
on and try to disappear. They are supposed to be
going "north", however the exact location is not
known. Their purpose in doing this is to start
a Minutemen Commune as a base of operations against
the Left, They have photographs which they claim

“were taken of people at Communes in the Northern

California area wearing, fatigues and practicing with
rifles. They will try to locate these communes
and conduct terrorist activities against them.

It was also learned that DAVIS attended a
recent gun show at El Paso, Texas. He reportedly said
he would put GODFREY in touch with his suppliers, who
can get anything in the way of weapons, ammunition
and explosives and other articles when he leaves,

Apparently DAVIS and HOOVER. will put this
plan into effect during the first part of 1971.

- It is known that HARRY ROTA; .Professor at
San Diego State College, has been more active lately.
He has been involved in trying to organize some sit~
ins and some protests against the arrest of LEON NOWER,
He looks as though he may be trying to take NOWER's place
as the radical faculty leader at San Diego State College.

It was also learned that a Datsun pickup truck
which RUJA drives to work was burned up on his driveway
last Saturday night. It is suspected that Some * of the
pata Minutemen may have been _respons ible.

. It was also learned that over the last weekend
the windows at the Sunrise Book Stre were broken,

fore



nee -“ BEYTTE HOUGHTON has not been seen for several
months. She is-not reported to be doing anything and it
7 looks as though everyone is more or less staying away

11/3/70 - -

By Jerome

: Attached is an SMC leaflet which I recently
picked up at SDSC,

It appears that GEORGE HOOVER and SAM DAVIS
are bosom buddies. They invited me to go to the Gunsmoke
Ranch in Harbison Canyon last Sunday. They were both
there and I also met ROGER WILLIS,. In addition there
were three women and two other males at the ranch whose

‘names I did not learn. :

DAVIS was in Mississippi recently and at the
ranch he was driving a green Chevrolet van with Mississippi
license F/6192030. He apparently broke down somewheres
in Texas one the way back and HOOVER went to rescue him,

“On the wanch there is a pistol range and a : i
range with promeLeeies up and running targets but that ‘

part was burned down in a recent fire, The rangé is
being rebuilt. There are also two muzzle loading cannons
on the ranch and there is a bunker or open mine shaft - ec
type of thing in the side of ahill. TI could see shoring oie :
: 4 and supports inside but was not allowed to get close bere

too. GO ‘Ree. what :it. was., 3 |

. HOOER and DAVIS were ee auick-draw :
shooting and hip shooting and are supposedly good :
shots with a .45 caliber automatic pistol. They are
always armed at least with .22 caliber derringer pistol.

SAM DAVIS has many M-2 carbine parts which he
will sell at a good price, He gets alot of his stuff :
from @ place in Los Angeles, and he has approached .BERRY GODFREY
asking him to stop at that place the next time he is in :
Los Angeles and obtain some hand grenade casings. . The casings
are apparently being sold for $1.00 a piwe, ©

I learned that the house HOOVER lived in on the
ranch was burned in the fire, I also learned that
there are two fellows named STAN (LNU) and DAVE (LNU)
who live on the ranch.

While I was there SAM was thirking about staging a
punitive raid on the SDPD in retaliation for the arrest of
ISSAC CANTRELL. He said however he did not know CANTRELL,

7

~ NW 68262 Docld:32989523-Page-656—



NW 68262 Docld:32989523 Page 657

DAVIS said he feels that the FBI and SDPD
are, communist controled and he wants to neutralize
them, In particular DAVIS has a special hate for
Agent O'BRIEN of the FBI, He said he Imows that most
of the Agents are decent people who are just doing
their job. However he feels that O'BRIEN is
persecuting the Minutemen as a vengeance and said he
would give anything to get earn home aes
and telephone number.

DAVIS said he was going to price some tear
gas grenades and said he could get primacord in 500 feet
lengths for $30.00.

It was learned that the SMC anti-war march
11/1/70 was a complete failure. There were only 150 ~- 200
people who participated in the march, with a few more
attending the rally, Nothing of interest happened

ae and the speeches given were dull and uninteresting.

Iwas in contact with PEIER REPLINGER-

_yestérday. .He said there has been evidence of many

students in the school turning against the new left
movement.He said apparently the Street Journal and its
staff had been caught. in some bad lies which mack eceueee:
many students to be disillusioned. :

It was also learned that SAM DAVIS wants to order
10000 .223 caliber bullets through BARRY GODFREY's contact
which will cost $255, It was also learned that FRANK
YACOPEC wants to order 1000 M~1 carbine bullets.

AES 1S ESCALATION

HOY WITHDRAWAL

This war is costing you, the taxpaying citizen, $2 million each
and every day, that is approximately 81500 B year for every man, woman
and child in this country.

Because a. war economy is non~productive inflation has run wild,
10% per year nationwide. Because of this war the average citizen
made less real money this year than last despite pay increases. Our
paychecks buy less end less each week.

This is a rich man's war. How many of the "Big Brass" get shot
up? How many millionaires lose a son or father to keep this war going?
FOR VHAT?

Many of the sailors on this ship realize this and do not wish
to go. They will be gone today but the fight to end the war goes
on. Disgust with the war is rampant within the military itself.

So long as the apathetic state of the people contimes so will
the war. The time to sit passively and watch has passed. Now is
the time for responsible action to end the war in Vietnam.

Servicemen and civilians are working together to end this war
for the first time in history. Show your support for the servicemen today.

BRING ALL TH TROOPS HOME NOW!

I was told that BERRY GODFREY was in touch
with BILL CLAY today, CLAY claims that there have been
the beginnings of some right wing activities at UCSD.

He said that the SDS there tried to stage a protest
against the Marine Corps Recruiter which was scheduled
to come to the campus. He said one SDS member dragged
an American flag across the quad and for his efforts was
beaten up by a-couple of members of @ new right wing-
group at the school.

The SDS had pianned to pene the number of
Negro Marines who have been killed in Vietnam, however
the Marine Corps set a Negro Recruiter to the school ~
which really threw water on their plans.

E . According to CLAY it appears that a real confrontation
may be brewing between the conservative and radical students
at UCSD, It was also learned that CLAY now has his private
pilots license. ;

ae It has also ben learned that BERRY GODFREY and
"other members of the Minutemen group may be © present at the

I was in contact with PETER REPLINGER last
Saturday. He told me he has agreed to take charge
of all the Minutemen records which are presently being
kept by BERRY GODFREY, PETER is getting ready for his
upcoming wedding and consequently has not been to active
lately.

I have noticed that someone has been painting
@ number of pro-Minutemen slogans on bridge abutments
.and overpasses around the La Mesa and El.Cajon area.
‘lately.

aa a I.had a.chance to talk to BILL CLAY this
morning. He is still upset about MELVIN CRAIN;
He thinks CRAIN is behind a large part of the left
wing activities in the county. He said he believes
CRAIN has a lot of weapons and ammunition stored away
‘on his Hollyoaks Ranch in Harbison Canyon. °

7 . CLAY also mentioned that KENNETH GOFF was
in town yesterday, He said GOFF was and probably
still is a close associate of DB PUGH, CLAY said
GOFF is sort of a religious fanatic. He suspects
GOFF may have concealed DE PUGH forawhile when, DE
PUGH was in hiding. He said GOFF was here to speak
to a group of right wing people and said about 40
individuals attended the speech.

i : : :
| CLAY said GOFF told him of the existance
of a left wing revolutionary army which is operating
| in this country. He said this army uses the name "Largo"
7 and allegedly obtains its orders and instructions by
i : code through a TV Program named "Dark Shadows". “He :

: : said the code used is supposed to be based on the sixth
and seventh chapters of one of the books of Moses in the
bible, which is somehow inserted into the TV program's :
Script. He also said there have been references to "Largo"

NW'68262 Docld:32989523- Page-662 =



in recent issues of "News Week" and "Saga" magazines.

If he can find out what issues it was in, he will try
and get them.

Attached are copies of some new Minutemen
stickers and posters which the local group has been
putting out. They are supposedly printed by Alex
Rapid Print in La Mesa. They are being mailed out to
many people and are also handed out locally around town.

It is known that BETITE HOUGHTON was in contact
with BARRY GODFREY last night. She was very excited about
the posters and stickers and said she was very glad to see
some activities getting started. She said she is reorganizing
some of her contacts and group and said that the new posters
and stickers had caused such a flury in town that the whole
Minutemen organization might really get going again.

She said LOU CONDE had apparently received some of the
stickers and posters and was excited about them. It looks
as though there are many people just sitting around waiting
for something like this to happen so they could get involved.

It was also learned that BETTIE Gave GODFREY
some plates with which to make some big Minutemen posters.
She also said she has nearly 500 negatives which can be
“ussl to make plates for printing posters and leaflets,

I had a chance to talk to BILL CLAY again.
He maintained that there may have been some correction
between DAVIS and ISSAC CANTRELL awhile ago. CANTRELL
is the one who was arrested by local and féderal authorities
for unlawful possession and manufacture of automatic

weapons.

NOVEMBER 18, 1970
_BY_JEROE

The bee of JAMES RICHARD BUSS is totally un-
familiar to me and I don't believe I have ever seen this
individual before. His name is also not familiar to me.

Iwas fairly well-acquainted with STEPHAN SMITH.
He was in the San Diego area for a period of approximately
a year and left six to eight months ago. I was told that
he went back north, which I assume _ mean Los Angeles or
San Francisco. .

SMITH was married and lived with his wife at Rancho
Bernardo while he was in this area. He was very involved in
the Right vs Left confrontation, which took place in Poway
last year over the make up of the Poway School Board. He was
involved there with Colonel SHIMP, the NORMANS, and other
people who were opposed to DANTET, PREDOVICH as school Board
Chairman and some of whom who were becca cee of getting
rid of PREDOVICH. :

- While SMITH was in this area, he was closely ge seietad
--with known members of the Minutemen organization, such as MICHAEL
VEJBODA, PAUL RUPLINGER and LOU CONDE. I do not know if SMITH
is or was a member of the Minutemen organization, but if not,
he was not a member in name only as he appeared to be in total
agreement with the far Right extremist, radical, political
philosophies of VEJBODA, RUPLINGER and CONDE. SMITH's wife
Was also extremely Right Wing and on one occasion helped pass
out Mimtemen organization leaflets. .SMITH was involved as a
partner with LOU CONDE in a business, which was named DIGISCAN.
DIGISCAN was supposed to have been an electronics research and
mamifacturing outfit, the main purpose of which was to develop
and sell a police communications system whereby each individual
police officer could, at all times, be in constant touch with
some police base station. SMITH and CONDE apparently had a
quarrel about the business and split up, and I believe there
may be a law suit pending over ownership of some. zt the equip-
ments which belonged to the arsed : :



|

Docld:32989523 Page 670°

As a stdelight, SMITH would buila monitoring and
“pugging" devices for a price. He also had electronic equip-
ment for use in searching buildings and other-places for
hidden electronic monitoring devices or "bugs".

I heard recently that MICHAEL VEJBODA is presently

living in Salt Lake City.

There is to be a big gun show.in Campo on the
weekend of November 21, and 22, 1970, and from the talk I
have heard, it sounds as though it will be a regular gather-
ing of the Minutemen organization and other Right Wingers in
this area. JERRY GBIER, I Jmnow will be besuiaiel with eeteae :
to show and sell.

BENNY, the barber who has all the machine guns
and rifles in his barber shop, is located on the west side
of 30th Street, about 14 blocks north of El Cajon Boulevard.

by JEROME

I was in contact with SAM DAVIS last Saturday
evening. For some reason he was quite upset and was talking
about making plans for a tactical squad of six or so individuals
with which to hartrass and terrorize left wing sympathizers in
the San Diego area. He said he wanted to have a meting this”
coming Friday evening to try to map out some strategy. .In
particular, he seems to want to conduct a raid on MELVIN CRANE's
ranch. He said he would shoot the Doserman Pincers CRAW@ has .
guarding the place, ransack the house then burn it down.

He was also talking about another place in Harbison
Canyon, I will try to get the address later, where he claims
Communist Party meetings are being held. Among others, he claims
that SI CASADY and DOROTHY HEALEY (phonetic) have ceen meeting
there, He says he wants to raid that place too.

He was also talking about a 'Doc Roberts" who he says
has many weapons contacts and who may have access to machine
guns and hand grenades, He may put me in touch with this person

a on.

“£ have also: been talicing ‘to FRANK YACOPEC. YACOPEC
says he has learned of a possible existence of some bunkers
which were buried and abandoned by General PATTON at the start
of the second World War, He says the bunkers are supposed to
still be full of ammunition and explosives, He claimed he

“was told of the existence of the bunkers by a former aide of

General PATTON. He told me that he, 3ILL CLAY and BARRY GODFREY

“may £ly up to the location at a later date and lok it over.

Apparently these bunkers are located somewhere in the desert
east of 29 Palms.

I was also in touch with PETER RUPLINGER on Saturday.
He stated he has obtained 50 hand grenade fuses and wants to
go to Los Angeles to buy 50 hand grenade casings and he will
then activate the hand grenades, PETER claimed he has a friend
who works at the Frontier Gun Shop in San Diego who is a
right wing individuals and is selling unregistered ammunition
and firearms. PETER has been carrying a ,#3 caliber revolver
lately. . RA



T also learned that SAi DAVIS has an unknown quantity
of expendable rocket launchers with rounds which he will sell
for $25 each. He is supposed to se looking for anti-tank

weapons and mortars in the hundreds or thoysands, DAVIS apparently

has a brother who is also very militant and is working with him.

: I am supposed to see BETTIE HOUGHTON this evening.
She will put out 500 of the new posters and stickers (see
attached). The advertising from the posters and stickers has
obtained response from as far away as Los Angeles where #3 @
person named FRANK W. CORRIGAN wrote requesting information.

On 12/1/70 Bee et earce
By JEROME So a

I was in contact with MARGE MC NICKLES at
sultan last Wednesday and talked to her for about three
hours. We discussed DE PUGH's status. She said that
representatives of the Minutemen organization and the
Patriotic Party have been talking to former Chief of
Police REDDIN at Los Angeles alleging that DE PUGH is
innocent of the bank robbery conspiracy charges on
which he was recently convicted. She said she was
told REDDIN is sufficiently convinced of the possibility
of DE PUGH's innocence that he may search out evidence

- in this regard on which to base a program for his
television show.

She also talked about a JIM MOORE who she said
is in California and is on one of MC NICKLES!' mailing
list. She also mentioned an older man in Los Angeles
named FREED who is a leader of the Patriotic Party. She
said that DE PUGH's mother is also a Patriotic Party :
leader and told me that DE PUGH has asked GLENN JACKSON,
of Los Angeles, to eee as to-National Patrlotic

: Party Chairman.

MC NICKLES said that she herself is Secretary~
Treasurer of the Western Region of the Patriotic Party
which covers 11 states. She said in the event of a
split in the Patriotic Party between DE PUGH and JACKSON,
she will side with DE PUGH. She said she has_the bank
account and the membership list for the Western Region
of the Patriotic Party in her possession. -

She also told me that the Minutemen National
Headquarters continues to function under BOB DE PUGH, JR.,
and RAMONA VAN DE PUGH, She said there is a courier
traveling between Los Angeles and the Minutemen National

Headquarters weekly.

Barman inne man

She asked that her son, DAN T. MC NICKLES,
a student at San Diego State College, be used at
Right Wing activities and made arrangements for me
-to meet him this evening at 8:00 p.m., in La Mesa.

MC NICKLES told me there is a woman living
in the Julian commune and said she has seen others
coming and going there. She gave me the license
numbers of two more of the cars she has seen at the
commune. One was an out of state license, white back-
ground with blue figures XVC 316, which was on a dark
green car with white racing stripes, possibly a Mustang,
which was at the commune on October 11, 1970. The
‘other was a tan over brown Volkswagen bus with California
- license MHD 097 which was at the commune on November 2,
1970.
On Friday I saw BILL CLAY and told him about
MARGE MC NICKLES, I asked him if he thought we should
try to use her to re-establish contact with the Minute-
men National Headquarters. CLAY, said "I don't know.
We'll have to ask SAM about that." I was definitely
impressed from the way he made the statement that perhaps
he has been taking orders in the Minutemen organization
from SAM DAVIS all along.

We then went together to see DAVIS and discussed

MC NICKLES with him. He said that we should continue
talking with MC NICKLES to see what contact with her
would produce. CLAY and DAVIS then got to talking
about breaking DE PUGH out of jail at Albuquerque and |
I related to them what MC NICKLES had told me before
about going to Albguerque to visit DE PUGH. CLAY and

. DAVIS became very upset and jumped all over me because
I had not told them about MC NICKLES being there and
about kmowing the layout of the Albuquerque City Jail.

: After this they started talking idley about
getting DE PUGH out of prison at Fort Levenworth.

: DAVIS then stated he had seen DENNIS MOWRER not
too long ago and at that time MOWBER was hiding out a
girl who was allegedly a former secretary for DE PUGH.

He said MOW&ER told him that for some reason DE PUGH had
people looking for this girl to kill her and that also

she was being clita by the FBI.

DAVIS continued talking and indicated the
possibility he hold a higher position in the Minute-
men organization in the State of California than we
previously suspected. He said he has been using the

- name SAM WILLIAMS in some of his other contacts and

Minutemen activities.

CLAY then mentioned a former San Diego area
Minuteman named ED ANDREWS who he thought had always
been very reliable. He aid he had previously understood
ANDREWS to be somewhere in the State of Arkansas but
said VIC WALTON had told him that ANDREWS was back at
Ramona, California, some time ago.

They also talked about HOWARD CLARK as a
reliable Minuceman member. He also apparently lives
at Ramona and is employed at Convair. MC NICKLES is
also well acquainted with CLARK and they said we should
use CLARK as a reference to _ NICKLES to » gain her
confidence. : 7

CLAY and DAVIS want to have another meeting
soon for the purpose of setting up a schedule or list of

‘targets in the San Diego area to hit in the event it

appears that a communist or other totalitarian takeover
in this country appears imminent. From my contact
with CLAY and DAVIS it appears that there has been
considerable improvement in the communications and
coordination among the Right Wings in this area.

Additionally, regarding my contact with “MC NICKLES,

" she ‘told me she is Neo-Nazi. She also said she is

in contact with JOSEPH BRINKER and also said that HENNING
VON BECK is in town. She said he is the son of a General
VON BECK who was in the German army and was executed at
the Nurenberg trials. She said he sold her that last
week some one fired a rifle bullet through the windshield
of his automobile and regularly gets letters from Jews
announcing they are out to get him...

She also told me ita the local telephone
installer at Julian, a man 40 - 45 years old, is also

_ a Minuteman and that he checks her telephone for her

to determine if it is being bugged.

REPORT BY JEROME

He was in contact with GEORGE HOOVER yesterday
who apparently has not been doing much of anything. He
also saw JERRY CGEIER last night who claimed he has made
contact with a Minutemen group at Los Angeles which is

. involved in buying and selling weapons. He told many
“about some new Minutemen business cards which are coming

out of Los Angeles. We got around to talking about hand

grenades and GEIER said that although he did not openly
solicit hand grenades. for money, he would obtain some for
money if he happened to run across any.

I am not aware of anyone connected with the

around MORRIS STARSKY's apartment house or on his car.
‘However, people like LOU CONDE, FRANK YACOPEC and the
! RUPLINGERS are always good suspects in things like that.

REPORT BY JEROME :
JANUARY 7, 1971

I = talking with GEORGE HOOVER day before ,

yesterday. We discussed an idea which he and SAM DAVIS

have had regarding setting up a Civil War Confederate
skirmish group similar to other such groups which have
been established in other parts of the country. This
group_will be set up by HOOVER, DAVIS, STAN McDADE, (INU)
MARTINI of the Accuracy Gun ‘Shop, FRANK YACOPEC and BARRY

, GODFREY. It is expected as many as 50 or 60 other individuals
may join the skirmish group, some who will be rightwing - ;

oriented people and may who will be just plain gun nuts.

These will include JERRY GEIER, ROGER WILLIS and others
probably including some from the Patch and Ball Gun Shop

cron. eau eine
I have also learned that GEORGE HOOVER and SAM
DAVIS have three operational Civil War field artillery

pieces which are located on ROGER WILLIS! Gunsmoke Ranch
property in Harbison Canyon and may actually belong to

him. STAN McDADE is building a 4th artillery piece. He
has the gun carriage ‘assembly and has ordered the barrel

for the weapon..

NW 68262 Docid:32989523 Page 689 :



According to HOOVER, the beauty of organizing
such a skirmish group is that it will allow the right -
wingers and Minutemen to use the group as an above ground

" organization and to openly drill and train with weapons,
Members would have their own uniforms and the organization
would be set up ina military fashion with officers, ranks,
etc., assigned to the members. ‘Persons joining the
organization will be protected from police and other
outside harassment by being assigned the name of an actual
_Civil War officer or soldier to use while they are participating
- in the organization's activities. The existence of the

organization will also give the right wingers an excuse to

have large quantities of black powder and percussion caps
- on hand to use for their weapons.

In addition the organization could he used to
provide an honor guard to be present at local appearances
of right wing speakers and to set up counter-demonstrations
against left wing activities,

This skirmish group would be controlled and direct=
ed by an underground nucleus of 6 or 8 solid Minutemen members
who are not generally knowm to other members of the skirmish
group.

HOOVER and DAVIS are apparently becoming less
interested in BILL CLAY as a member and participant in right |

NW 68262 Docld:32989523 Page 690 i



wing activities. According to them, he is too pusy now
adays with his own personal affairs ‘to be of much use.

For this reason, they have said they don't want him in the
underground group of Minuteman members who will direct

the Civil War skirmish.

It has come to my attention that JERRY BUSCH
has fallen out of favor with most of the Minutemen members
who do not like or trust him, SAM DAVIS has even threatened
to shoot him; GEORGE HOOVER still likes him though and
BUSCH spends most of his weekends at the Gunsmoke Ranch with
HOOVER and WILLIS, Could their be a romance brewing? 7 :

On 1/13/71
By JEROME

I was at Julian today talking to MARGE

MC NICKLES, She said she had sent a letter to one of
my Post Office Boxes asking me to come and see her.
She said it looked as though ‘there had been another
split in the Minutemen organization, and showed me a
pulletin which she had received from what looks like
anew Minutemen group. The bulletin was printed on
“the original Minutement letterhead paper and was post
marked December 15, 1970. She said she received the
bulletin about a week ago.

Regarding the bulletin, MC NICKLES said that
-in the past there was always talk about DE PUGH and
other people in the Minutemen organization regarding
an Executive Committee of advisors to DE PUGH. According
to the bulletin, it had been sent out by that Executive
Committee and announced that -during the month of December
of 1970, no date given, there had been a meeting of
Regional Coordinators of the Minutemen organization at
Chicago, Illinois. The bulletin said the Executive
Committee was gratified at the large attendance at the
meeting and went on to announce that control of the :
Minutemen organization was being taken away from DE PUGH
and the res’ of the National Headquarters Group at
Norborne, Missouri. The bulletin said this action was
peing taken as it had been learned that funds of the
Minutemen organization had been mis-used, that halucinatory
drugs had been purchased and that effective leadership
was lacking at the Norborne Headquarters. s

The bulletin said that DE PUGH and-his :
associates should no longer be considered as part of
the Minutemen organization. The bulletin advised that

* all Minutemen literature which had not been copyrighted
was being re-printed and was always available for

ot Qistribution.
Ce

__ NW 68262, Docid:32989523 Page 695°



"NW 68262 ‘Docld:32989523 Page 696 -

- She said the copyrighted Minutemen literature
was being reviewed for changes so as to avoid the
copyright and would been be re-printed.

The bulletin also advised that as a result
of the December meeting the country had been divided
into ten regions with a Regional Coordinator appointed
for each, The bulletin said that the Regional Coordinator
would be the individual member's contact with the
National Headquarters. The bulletin had a return
address of Post Office Box 896, Elgin,‘ Illinois, with
a note that the second address appearing on the bulletin
was that of the receiving members Regional Coordinator.
The note went on to say that if no second address
appeared on the bulletin ‘the receiving member was to
send all Minutemen organization mail to the Elgin,
Illinoic, address from where it would be forwarded
to the Regional Coordinator. There was no second
address on MC NICKLES' copy of the bulletin.

Enclosed with the bulletin were a number of
_the original Minutemen report forms which are to be filled
out and returned. Also enclosed were a number of the
origional Minutemen application forms which are suppose
to be distributed to interested persons.

7 MC NICKLES told me she has heard of several
other people (no names given) in our area who also
received the bulletin. “She said, however, that apparently
none of the JOHN ZEMANEC-GLENN JACKSON group at Los ~
Angeles got them,

With regard to DE PUGH, NC NICKTES told me
.that the charges: against him in the State of Washington
have been thrown out of court for lack of evidence.
MC NICKLES said she communicates regularly with DE PUGH's
wife and received a letter from her not too long ago :
which requested more monéy for DE PUGH's legal defense. -
She said, however, there has been no visible action in
this regard and pointed out that the above described
bulletin implied that DE PUGH's wife is "blowing" the
money which is being received for his defense.

Gs



rere

She said she has also heard a rumor to the
effect that DE PUGH's wife is running aromd on him
while he is in prison, but she said she does not believe
this is true.

: MC NICKLES said DE PUGH's wife had previously
mentioned a person named JESSE STEPHENS who may possibly
be connected with the group at Elgin, Illinois.

She said STEPHENS supposedly started a Right
Wing group some years ago, -possibly in the Northwest
but was never recognized by DE PUGH.

She said she does not know if STEPHENS is
piace connected with the Elgin, Illinois, group.

ny will send a letter to the group at Elgin,
Illinois, regarding what their plans are. I will use
the name JERRY MORAN and the Post Office Box Number "76
at Spring hist California.

ON JANUARY 18, 1971, BY JEROME Prac UBmeeCJENes

I have not been in contact with LOU CONDE in’ some-
time; however, I understand he is still politically active
especially in the group named Taxpayers Concerned. PAUL
REPLINGER is still in regular contact with CONDE.

CONDE has always had a reputation as a "blabber
mount", but actually only talks about little things which
.are not very important. CONDE is a clever, dynamic,. ambitious
ani hardworking person. He has a lot of money and is very
‘willing to put some of it into right wing activities.

CONDE has many Cuban exile contacts and is e Cuban
himself. In particuler, he is close to the Alpha 66 group
and can get them out to do things for him. 7

CONDE is in very tight with the local tuna boat
association and I would imagine he also has many contacts
among the shrimpers and tuna sievers. This is because he
has @ marine engine and shipfitting business and does much
eae for the fishing boats.

It is ‘entirely likely that CONDE may be involved in
some way with illegal arms shipments on some of these fishing
boats between here and some Latin American countries. If this
is happening, I doubt that the weapons are coming to the
United States through the Letin American countries, but are
probably being purchased here and shipped to Cuban guerrilla
organizations in Central and South America. ‘It is also possible’
that CONDE may secretly be doing some work to.arm some of the
tuna boats to protect them against seizure by such countries
as Peru and Ecuador. He mentioned something about this to me
about a year ago. : 5

It looks as though I may be going to the Gunsmoke
Ranch this coming weekend. They're-going to have a pistol
shoot there with quite a few people attending. Last weekend
they had @ shotgun shoot at skeet. The group at the Gunsmoke

ON JANUARY 18, 1971, BY JEROME

I have learned that sometime ago, FRANK YACOPEC

and JERRY TARTAGLIO were in contact with a retired Army
colonel who claimed he was some kind of an aide to General
PATTON, or otherwise connected with him, when PATTON was

. involved in desert maneuvers and treining in the Palm Springs,
_ California, area at about the beginning of the second World
War. According to what this colonel said, PATTON and his
troops received urgent orders requiring them to pack up end
ship out to go overseas with only two days notice. Because

- of such short notice, rather than taking their heavy equipment
and supplies with them, they simply abandoned and buried ther
inwholesale quantities. I understand that many trucks and
tanks were part in ravines and gullies and dirt was bulldozed
over them. There are a lot of recorded instances where people
have found such buried supplies in the desert out beyond
Palm Springs. This area is still 311 Government property
that is very little inhabited any any time. Apparently the
Government has either lost its records, forgotten about, or
simply doesn't care about a11 the oeuee ee is Supposed to
“be buried out there. : :

| : In particular, this colonel told YACOPEC ‘and TARTAGLIO
7 about a large concrete bunker with big double steel doors which
he said was filled with ammunitions end explosives and also

buried. He apparently told TARTAGLIO and YACOPEC how to locate
the bunker and I understand that they Went out to the desert

| and efter digging through about six feet of sand, actually

| . found the steel-doors to the bunker. Following this, they

covered the bunker up again and have not been back since.

On the 27th of this month, @ group including YACOPEC,
BARRY GODFREY and PETER REPLINGER are going to go out to the
desert to try and relocate the bunker and dig it out. I
understand that REPLINGER has access to a portable jackhammer
and some other heavy equipment which he will use to dig out
the bunker. aoe

: : If it is at all possible, I will try and go along
with them to see what they actually find.

ON JANUARY 25, 1971, BY JEROME SERRE’

I was et the Gunsmoke Ranch in Herbison Canyon
yesterday. When I got there, there were already 15 people
present, most of whom I did not know and as I was leaving,
three more people, STAN MC DADE and his two sons, arrived.
Those I knew among the others present were JERRY BUSCH, SAM
DAVIS, GEORGE HOOVER end ROGER WILLIS. Two of the others that

_ I noticed inparticular were a young fellow in his early 20's

about 5' 6" tall, 130 pounds, dark brown hair, who was called
GEORGE, and a big fellow with shoulder length hair and a
goatee beard-who was about 45 years old, 6' 5" tall, 300 pounds

‘and.bald. I believe he may have been referred to by the name
” ROYAL. : ; :

7 There did not seem to be any organized activity in
progress. Most of the people were just more or less milling
around and talking with each other. Most were carrying pistols
and most were shooting muzzle toading weapons at one time or
another. eee :

While I was there, - I kot to talking to SAM DAVIS about”
HOWARD CLARK who lives at Ramona. DAVIS stated he felt he could

“ trust CLARK completely and backed this up saying that CLARK is

storing some weapons for him. DAVIS said he had also ‘been working
on sOme machine guns with CLARK at Ramona at one time-end.edded
Shat-0baniean get atiof she IND and-c-4-piestic—exphosives he-

-wants. DAVIS said he would get a list of prices of this stuff

@vom=GLARK on February €5, 1971, and added that he, DAVIS, has
to go to court that morning to answer charges on a traffic
warrants.

DAVIS also told me he will be going up to Mud River,
Idaho, sometime in the early part of this summer with several
other people to live. He said he will give me his address there

“when it becomes available to him as he wants to stay in touch

ON JANUARY 26, 1971, BY JEROME Deecesneuuue cues -

“This morning I answered an ad in the newspaper
and purchased a .22 calibre Remington rifle for $20.00.
I bought the gun from a Negro individuel by the name. of
MAURY (ph) (LNU) who is presently residing at 5880 University,
Apartment BS He looked to me to be in his late 20's, about
51 9" tall and slender and was wearing e goatee beard and a
moustache. He wore his hair in a modified Afro style and
resembled comedian BILL COSBY very much, both in physical
appearance and mannerisms.

He told me he had just moved to San Diego from Los

Angeles and is looking for work.

While I was at his apartment, I noticed he .had large
quantities of Black Panther and other black militant literature,
including books by ELDRIDGE CLEAVER and copies of the Black

: Panther Party newspaper.

In addition to the .22 calibre rifle, he also hed
in his possession 2 .32 calibre automatic pistol which is a
cheap imitation of the French MAB and is made in Spain.

It has been learned that there is a San Diego Police
Department officer named BOB SISK who claims he is @ member of
the Minutemen organization.

I was in contact with GILBERT MC GILL Sunday. He is
still employed at the Telephone Company. He told me he has
been helping to tap some telephone lines and that it is still
a@ common practice for Telephone Company employees to listen in
on telephone conversations in the San Diego area.

Regarding the possibility of a big Minutemen meeting
during the middle of December, 1970, I was unable to get in
touch with BILL CLAY during almost the entire last half of
December and it is possible he may have gone to the Chicago
meeting. It is also possible that SAM DAVIS may have gone as
I am-frequently unable to contact him for several days at a
time.

On 2/11/71, source observed a rally on the
San Diego State College campus which began at 11:00 a.m.,
“ with a meeting on the library lawn. Following this,
between 500 and 1,000 students marched across the campus
chanting Slogans against the current military operations i
in Laos. : .

’

Source said folloiwing the march the rally
continued with a skit put on by a group known as the
Chicano Guerilla Theatre. Following this a young male
individuals named "SKIP" who said he was from MDM, spoke
to the crowd urging them to harass the Marine Corps at
Camp Pendleton, California, diring the upcoming courts

‘ martial of two MDM members there. 7

Following this a young girl got up and announced
| there would be a meeting Sunday evening, 2/14/71, to plan
for a big rally on San Diego State College campus Wednesday,
| 2/11/71. She indicated that persons desiring to attend
_ the meeting should gather "down by the trees" and from
| there they would march to the meeting place,

| 7 She further stated that an additional purpose
| “of the meeting would be to organize a new radical group
on the San Diego State College camous which would cover
all issues rather than having several organizations each Lo
interested in only one specific issue.

Source also learned there was to be a closed
meeting at 3:00 p.m., on 2/11/71, to plan for the
Sunday evening meeting. :

Following this the microphone was opened to
the audience but only one individual, a young male
individual with long hair and wearing no shirt or shoes,
took advantage-of the opportunity. He spoke against
carrying the Viet Cong flag and against trying to destroy
the system saying he believed the necessary changes
could be made within the established frame work, He
was not too well received. |

Source also acquired a leaflet distributed by
members of the Student Mobilization Committee (SMC) at
the University of California at San Diego (UCSD). The
leaflet called for a massive demonstration against the
local draft board office on Park Boulevard and starting ©
with a "mass-in" at the local board building at 10:00 a.m.,
on 2/16/71. : :

The leaflet indicated that persons interested
in participating should assemble in the Urey Hall parking
lot at UCSD at 9:15 a.m., on 2/16/71. Other persons
desiring to attend should find their own transportation.
For further information interested persons were requested
to call telephone number 453-3362. =H :

The leaflet stated that SMC desired to obtain
the signatures of enough people so that during the period
2/16/71 - 2/19/71, 20 persons per hour could be assigned
to be present at the draft board for harassment purposes.

The leaflet indicated that there are many legal
forms of harassment which should be engaged in such as
bringing any kind of garbage or miscellaneous articles
to be filed in a registrant's folder as Selective Service
law states that a registrant may place anything in his
folder which he feels is pertinent to his draft status.

SD 170~286. 4

The leaflet urged registrants to appear at
the draft board simply to examine their file, or to
ask any of a numoer of questions regarding their draft
status or the Selective Service System itself.

The leaflet urged females to appear at the
draft board and demand to be allowed to register for
the draft denouncing the Selective Service System as
sexist and racist or to flood the place with tears
asking that their boy friends, isahitinnaiatifg etec., be
exempted from the draft.

The leaflet also urged interested persons to
deluge the draft board with letters requiring file
searches and return correspondence in an effort to
tle up the system. It pointed out that females by
using their first initial and last name could request
information from their non-existant files without .
being traced.

In addition, the leaflet urged persons to
tie up the draft board telephone lines with many
miscellaneous telephone calls.

Also obtained was a leaflet requesting help
and support in the case of SAMUEL C, MILLER, a. prisoner
in the brig at the 32nd Street Naval Station. The
leaflet was issued by Concerned Officers Movement and
indicated the group has a house at 3788 Tenth Street,
San Diego, California, telephone numoer 291-4062,

Source also obtained a leaflet indicating
there will be some kind of a “teach-in" on the war in
Southeast Asia with news film clips and other material
at San Diego.State College on 2/11/71 and 2/16/71, at
7300 p.m.

OQ

On February 4, 1971
By JEROME

Today I checked the Minutemen Post Office
Box at Spring Valley, California, and found a letter
addressed to AFSC, The person sending the letter .-
used regular Minutemen precautions in sending it,
Such as double wrapping the message.

The message itself was written on a two inch
by four inch piece of paper in grease pencil and said,
"Make contact February 7, 7:00 a.m., uhs9570". This
looks. very interesting and I plan to go ahead and make

-the contact das requested on the note.

- I have learned recently that SAM DAVIS and TOM
“FORREST have been doing a lot of business together for
some time, The name RONALD TIMOTHY DOMENICK or DOMINIC is
not familiar to me but the name “PAUL" and the description
you gave me sounds like an individual who hangs around
with PRREST and some of the other gun people.

a I also have heard a rumor before that FORREST is
operating some kind of a shop on the Mexican boarder and
FORREST allegedly deals in a lot of illegd stuff.

“FORREST has had two large boats and lost both
of them. There. is a story around which I believe is .
probably true that his second boat was bombed as a result
of a quarrel or something over smuggling. I have never
heard anything about him having any hand grenades on the
boat but he may have had some kind of high explosives
on it.

With regard to the Gun Smoke Ranch being for
Sale, it is my understanding that all of tne people at
the ranch including DAVIS, HOOVER, WILLIS and several

- others will eventually be going to the Mud River, Idaho,

area...

Notes

On February 5, 1971, it was determined that telephone
number 445-9570 is a public pay telephone located in
the front of a liquor and grocery store at 2262 High-
way 80 by Alpine, California. The location of this
telephone number was furnished to informant so that he
might have it watched in an effort to determine the
individual's identity he would be contacting.

On February 8, 197.
By JEROME

Yesterday at 7:00 aom., I contacted the
individual who sent the note in the mail as he had
requested. We made arrangements to meet together at
the Denny's Restaurant in Bl Cajon. TI plan to have’
SAM DAVIS or GEORGE HOOVER or both there to watch
the meeting and make sure nothing funny happens.

The person I talked to on the telephone gave
me what he said was his Minuteman Serial Numoer. I
subsequently checked this number with BETTIE HOUGHTON
who said the number is a good one and falls within a
block of numbers which she said she knows was legitimately
issued, She said she has access to some files which
may include this number so that possibly she can find
out who the person is.

While I was making the call I had FRANK YACOPEC
watching the telephone booth up at Alpine. FRANK pretended
to have a flat tire by stopping about a half a mile down
the road from the telephone booth where he let some air

--out of one of his tires. He then drove his car to an air

pump at a service station near the telephone booth where

- he was able to watch the person who received the call.

After the call was.over he followed this individual to

a side street named Marshall Road, When he -got to the
road and looked the person had disappeared, He said there
were only two cars on the road which looked like they

had been driven recently which had the ican license
plate numbers : i

WAB 703

~ and

‘YOB 714

I also had a long talk with SAM DAVIS today and
obtained the following information:

im


was confiscated,

On February 8, 1971 Hee
By JEROME i eaigiin Se

He said that one PAUL HUNT at Santa Monica,
California, is the person-who is actually in charge of
the Minutemen in the State of California or at least
in that area and he has been so in charge since the
disappearance of TROY HOUGHTON, He added that DENNIS
MOWER is only a public figurehead and added that he
thinks PAUL HUNT is a very dangerous man,

On the sudject of TROY HOUGHTON, It have learned
from both DAVIS and BILL CLAY that HOUGHTON's contacts

May have been much more widely spread than I thought.

Specifically, they told me that HOUGHTON was behind an
attempt several years ago by 18 "hunters" in the State .

“ of New York to conduct sabotage and terrorist attacks

on New Left Groups. These 18 individuals were supposediy
arrested and a large quantity | of weapons and ammunition

I also talked some more with DAVIS about TOM

FORREST and it appears that they know each other extremely

well. DAVIS said he had some business dealings with
FORREST involving some machine guns and other items.

DAVIS apparently has decided not” to get rid
6f as much of his explosives and so forth as he originally

‘said, He has a small quantity of T.N.@. and also some

NVW-68262—Docld:32989523-Page 725_._ _

c4 Plastic explosives which he will sell at $10 a pound
which is too high a price.

He said he can also obtain a military weapon
which is like a bazooka and has a self-contained 3.5"
rocket round in an expendable launcher. He said the price
of this is (425.

‘It has deen ascer@nea that at this, time R of Poway
_y not interested in trying to form or. lead any type of security force
for any right-wing extremist group. When asked by James K. Warner
of Los Angeles (via Dennis Loso of Escondido) if he-would do this, ~
Eddy stated that he would like to see the formation of a Security :
Force with teeth in it but does not consider himself to be enough
of a leader to do it himself.

While declining to lead a Security Force, Eddy did say that :
the only way to stop FBI infiltration of rightist groups would be
for one of the infiltrators to “wind up in the river" someday. Eddy
is positive that Tom Knight's San Diego unit of the Nazi Party has
a regular FBI infiltrator. The only three men of whom he is not sus
picious are Mickey Wakefield, Ray Wilson and Gerald Smith. - Said Eddy, |
"Those three men dropped out of ‘the thing and so I figure they' re okay
but you can bet that the fink is still in there ‘pushing".

: Ioso seid that the whereabouts of people like Barry Godfrey
should be learned and they ‘should be telephoned and‘ intimidated. :
Eddy said he thinks such intimidetions would be a waste of time and’.
| that people like Godfrey should be killed. ‘Mickey Wakefield of San
| Marcos went along with hddy's suggestion. ‘Ron ‘Eady ‘also mentioned
‘having had an encounter with an. #BI agent named Peterson in San Diego
but did not elaborate. :

Eddy firmly believes that ‘any * man’ who commits himself to one
organization in the Far Right should not be invoived. with others.

He says he would be very suspicious of anyone who is.- He is also
somewhat suspicious of Tom Enight. .He says that Joe Brinker gave
Knight the name of a man. interested in Nazism and two weeks later
the FBI interviewed the’ man. “Also, Eddy wonders how Knight saved-
his federal job in the face of his continued Nazi activities. Eddy
feels that ary regular rightist extremist who'stays on with the Nazi ©
Party now mist warrant heavy suspicion. of being an FBI informant.

On Friday night, January 31, 1975 Ron Eddy met Tom Metager of
‘Fallbrook for the first time. Metzger showed Zddy some pictures and
slides of New Christian Crusade activities and the two seemed to hit
“at off pretty well. Metzger told Eddy, Wakefield and Loso of a visit
he received at his home on mincaneetied 7s 1975 from agents of. the , Internal

Here is one last bit of information. ‘The New Christian Crusade’

people are very concerned about the imprisonment of George Hoover of

the Secret Army Organization. At one of their banquets the NCC had
four unoccupied places set at the table which were in honor of four
men whom they hold to be absent heroes, These four men were Joe McCart>

George Hoover, Charles Lindbergh and a man named R. Miles.

Anyway, it. has been learned that a man whom Tom Metzger knows

is going to take a dossier of the Hoover case to some congressman

in Washington, D.C. who is part of a committee currently scheduled

to investigate the FBI. The dossier consists of newspaper clippings

and other material pertaining to Hoover's activities in the SAO, his

arrest, conviction, appeal, etc. They are hoping to stir up a big
publicity stink to give the FBI a bad name due to Barry Godfrey's
‘activities and in so doing hope to éffect an eventual release of Hoover

from prison. By the way, the NCC people do not refer to Hoover by. .

. his correct name. For some reason they all call him Mickey Hoover.
That is about all for now. I hope this will be of some help
to you. ie :

members of an earlier paramilitary group, the.

Steve Christiansen, a phoenix was rising from the
Minutemen ashes — the Secret Army Organization.
Christiansen was interested — and Godfrey was back
in the informer business. 7

Every bit a virulent and fanatical as’ the
Minutemen, SAO members were committed to

. armed resistance of leftist “enemies.” Units were
active in 11 western states, with San Diego sporting
an especially dedicated, it smali, group of activists.

Godfrey fingered Jerry Lynn Davis (also known as

and local coordinator.

Godfrey recrusted members making great
pretense of concealing their identities. He testified
he had nine men in his cell. There was also a 10th

On iearning the FBI had funneled money into the
SAO, Jerry Davis commented acidly. “You might
say we were a federally funded poverty program of,
the right.”’

According to both leftists and’ lawyers who later
defended SAO members. Godfrey had the best of
both worlds — he could indulge in paramilitary fun
and games while pocketing government money.

Godfrey assisted his SAO subordinates in
spreading | hate literature attacking leftis:
sympathizers and porongraphv. Members of his cell
also committed a series of capers that, in two cases,
nearly ended in tragedy.

With students organizing protests against the
Vietnam War. young radical demonstrators figured
near the top of the SAO “enemies’ list.

In one interview. Godirey allegedly claimed the
SAO accumulated vast tiles on local leftists.
sometimes by breaking into their homes. Godfrey
passed this infotmation onto the FBI.

In late 1971, Peter Bohmer — a former economics-
instructor at San Diego State and an active war
beri — began receiving death threats from the’

readers to “stop by and.deal with the Redscum."*

On another occasion. an anonymous caller left
Bohmer a message: ~*Wish-Pete a Merry Christmas.

. This will be his last. This is the Secret aia

Organization.”



Other death threats followed.

: Finally, on Jan. 6. 1972. two shots were fired

| through Bohmer’s window. His triend, Paula Tharp
j was wounded in the elbow.

Asa result, police began to investigate the SAO.
But.the FBI wasn’t ready to blow Godfrey's cover.
Six months later, Godfrey admitted he had
- witnessed the shooting. He told a court he had driven
to Bohmer’s house in Ocean Beach on a
“surveillance” ion. Another SAO member.
George M. Hoover, had fired two shots from
Godfrey's car and would have fired more if his gun
hadn't jammed. said the informant.

. _ Godfrey had then taken the tell-tale pistol_and
Hoover's jacket to FBI agent Christiansen, who hid
the evidence in his home until the SAO was exposed
later that year. e .

The final straw that broke the SAO was the wildcat
bombing of the Guild Theater on June 19. 1972. No

‘The informer told how Yakopec met him at the |
fence between their vards, still flushed from his :
bombing exploit of the previous night. -

Godfrey testified Yakopec described “ ... the |

* the theater ... how he stood down at the end of the

block and listened to the blast. He then described to
me how he placed the bomb, what type of a bom he
used. and how he carried it down the alley and
planted it.”

Frederick Hetter, Yakopec's attorney, believed
his client might have had grounds for pleading
entrapment but the jury found Yakopee guilty
anyway.

SA FARL M. PETERSEN

HOWARD BARRY GODFREY
INFORMASDN CONCERNING

HOWARD BARRY GODFREY has applied for a position as Arson
Investigator for the State of California. He scored the top
grade in his test and is now being investigated by the California
Bureau of Investigation for this position. He is presently working
for the State of California in a similar positon. SA FRANK M.
THOMPSON, CBI is conducting the investigation:

The following information which has all been made public
was given to SA THOMPSON upon authority of the SAC:

HOWARD BARRY GODFREY, Born July 1, 1943, at Portsmouth,
England, was an informant of the FBI from August 10, 1967.
to November 1)., 1972. He reported to the San Diego office.
This service was entirely voluntary on his part. During this ~
period of time he furnished a volume of highly reliable information |
about right wing type groups such. as the Minutemen and the
Secret Army Organization. He was reimbursed for his service
in amounts ranging £x=mx up to $250.00 per month.

On June 22, 1972, GODFREY furnished informatian indicating
that one WILLIAM FRANCIS YAKOPEC intended to hemb "Genies Massace |
Parlor" in El Cajon. Due to the vonsibility of loss of life if
this bombing was carried out, it was decided to make GODFRHY
available to testify in the trial of YAKOPEC who had placed a
bomb in the Guild Theatre in San Diego on June 19, 1972. As a

Walton is very anxious to have Ron Eddy of Poway read Nature's ;

Ron Eddy of Poway states he has all of the coming week off and that

desires to accompany Wakefield and Knight to their scheduled trial
og disturbing the peace on Wednesday, November 21, 1973. Eddy also

geiterated his hope that bail on George Hoover-will be lowered suffic-
‘Aently to get him out. Eddy said he would be willing to borrow money
from his credit union and put up the equity in his house as collateral

to get Hoover out of jail.
from serving as informants for the FBI is to make examples of some of
them. Eddy believes that Hoover would murder Barry Godfrey if he could
Lind him and I think he is hoping something like that. will happen.
When it becomes necessary for Godfrey to return to San Diego, I cannot
over-emphasize the importance of maintaining heavy security for him.
If he thought he had half a chance of getting away with it, I believe

Eddy himself would murder Godfrey just to "make an example".

The man convicted of wounding.

George Mitchell Hoover, Secret Army

years to fife. His conviction, was aimost

:.entirely due to the testimony of Howard

both informer and accomplice) was in

that Godirey’s role in the shooting

which time he furnished the following information.

Sa?

aan Recently the Secret Army Organization prepared and-
Gistributed a special bulletin regarding PETER GEORGE BOHMER.
Response from Right Wing sympathizers to this bulletin has
been very encouraging and consequently, on 1/8/725 source was
Biven an assignment by JERRY LYNN DAVIS, leader of the SAO,

It is'’noted that tnat source
drives a 1989 Rambler American, ceciu. olue, whicn would
renerally match the description of the shooting vehicle
as previously furnished to the police. Source has explained
shat he was reluctant to discuss this matter in its entirety
wein vorevious tel ephonic contacts with writer sebutedeeabiciee
Cc aries ear as tee wife was present at the t
and he did not wish to gpset her unnecessarily, He stated
that the incident had come as a comolete- surprise to him,
and that he hed ho intention or desire to take any action
at BOHFER's residence other than to obtain. whatever information
was availeble in as discreet a manner as possible. He said
he is estremely upset and dismayed at the turn of events 7
and would like to end his association with these individuals,
but, as before, could | See no practical way of doing so at this
time.

“It is noted that Informant has been repeatedly
cautioned,on previous occasions to avoid becoming directly
involved jn any activities which might result in psrsonal
injury or death for any individual. Saurce has wholeheartedly
agreed with this and has consistently furnished all information

sd in his possession regarding the possibility of such incidents
occuring, Writer believes that source was totally unaware
that HOOVER might shoot into the houss Before the incident
hapoened, EE « .
Peet » Source has been advised to avoid all
future ‘contact with LOOVER, as much as possible, and has
‘agreed that this would appear to be She best course of action.
Ee advised that to tae best of his kmowlese, only he and
HOOVER are presently aware of the incident. He said it is
his understanding %. gun involved has been permanently dis-
posed of. Source eointed out that the incident agpears to
have caased HOOVER to become quite "fired up" and to be ready
for a violent confrentation with the police if he should be~
approached on the r.tter. Source said he doubts HOOVER will
discuss the matt ith anyone else but cannot be sure of
this. ie said t quOOVER has never deen interviewed before
vy Law enforcement “and would advise® against such an inter-

view in view of hi.N\unoredictablzity. - 3

FROM ae ROBERT W. EVANS (170-411)

sunject: EXTREMIST INFORMANTS
EXTREMIST MATTERS

A recent article appearing in the Black Panther
Party (BPP) Cleaver Faction publication "Right On!" calls
for swift and unmerciful retaliation against current and
former extremist informants. This article contains numerous
inflammatory statements and may ‘well. signal the initiation
of widespread retaliation against our informants.

Recently seized items from the Republic of New
Africa (RNA) included instructions to RNA members concerning
. the indoctrination of those members suspected of being law
\ enforcement informants. These instructions basically involve
the completion of a aan IIN questionnaire form and background
investigation. ;

\" : Each agent shoud recognize the continuing possibility

- of infiltrators within our extremist informant ranks. There

|. have been attempts in the past to penetrate informant ranks,
and we can logically expect there will be attempts in the
future in this regard. Therefore,.all agents are reminded of -

|. the importance of in-depth background investigation and personal
Knowledge of each informant, as well as the necessity for

| eareful verification and eval uation of | information furnished
by extremist informants. : ana

. Each agent handling an extremist informant,
,|ineluding extremist ghetto informants, should be thoroughly
i: . . ‘lalert to the absolute necessity for handling these informants
under the most secure conditions in order to eliminate the
| ’ ‘possibility of these informants being: exposed. . All agents
should also bring to the attention of their informants the
Republic of New Africa's methods of‘ disclosing infi ltrators
in order that our informants will be. - forewarned.

Dear Mr. Evans:
Thank you for your letter of galy 26, 1971.

I advised all parties to our conference on July 23,
1971, that the Attorney General has beer given statutory
authority by Congress to provide witness protection...
facilities if necessary. The Attorney General's statutory
authority in this matter is the Organized Crime Control Act
of 1970. However, before any implementetion of this act
“takes place, the United States Attorney's Office must con-
sult with the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice.

Should it become necessary that your informant testi- ;
fies in the ATFD case, the matter of this informant's safety
- will be brought to the attention of the Department of Jus-
*. ‘tice. :

If you have any further questions, please do not hesi-
tate to contact me.

Very truly yours,

On 7/30/71, I telephonically furnished the

- saaee i ‘of the Civil Rights Section at the Bureau.

Mr. KELLY advised that the information contained in
the memos should be incorporate in ‘an LHM and furnished to
the Bureau under the informant's aption.

Mr. KELLY furth: suggested that the results of the
423/71 conference between /ATFD and the U.S. Attorney's Office,
an Diego, be furnished to/the Bureau in an LHM for transmittal
o the Department. Mr. LY noted that the Department and the
FD in Washington, D. Cs, feel that the delivery of the
minating grenade by SD_1155=R to DAVIS would constitute a
violation under ATFD jurisdiction. It was pointed out to Mr.

LLY that as set forth in referenced nitel, AUSA RISSO at
San Diego disagreed with that view and did not consecee such
a set of facts a prosecutable violation.

The LHM should include information from ATFD or ‘the
informant to the effect that the é{fiminating grenade has or
has not been delivered by the informant to subject DAVIS.

oe permanently in the near future for health and business feasons.

“He stated that he still feels that ndtwithstanding
the foregoing, relocation at Boise, Idaho, would be more
advantageous for him. He advised he would appreciate assistance
from the Bureau in finding employment there.

a aseee Source further advised that on 7/27/71 the points
irae -pequired for selling a house with an FHA loan on it rose from

LAN

7/28/71, Mr. and Mrs. CHARLES GODFREY, the
parents of SD_1155aketelephonically advised that they had
discussed with their son their son's possible relocation
to Boise, Idaho.

. The parents stated that they were not satisfied
i i with the possibility of their son's relocation to Boise and
i felt that in addition to the relocation, the FBI should secure

‘a job for SD in Boise comparable to the $12,000 a year
| job he praghitly, holds at San dieg 5 i
Gtr. and Mrs, CHARLES eon REY intend to move to .

- Hawaii for health reasons in the Aear future and suggested
| the possibility of relocating SD'1155-R to that state inas-

, Much as they feel there is an abundance of U. S. Government
jobs in Honolulu, one of which the FBI could get for their
son without too much difficulty.

During this conversation, Mr. GODFREY mentioned

‘that he has many "friends" in Washington whom he would be
\glad to contact if it was felt it would help the FBI to help

is son. The inference of this remark was interpreted as

eing that-if the FBI did not help SD 1155-R, Mr. GODFREY

ight seek the assistance of his "frie ads™ - Washington.

|. It was pointed out to the parents that as of 7/26/71,
their son indicated that all he desired was relocation to
Boise, but that their feelings in this nacker would be made

a matter of record.

No assurance of any sort was.made to the parents

inention of the group to distribute these pamphlets to various
groups, particularly including liberal organizations so that

it would be well known that these individuals were known to
right wing groups. Informant said the bulletin bore whe name
of the "Phantom Milicia", and was to be distributed on a
completely anonymous pasis. About two days after publication
of the bulletin and before distribution had taken place, CLAY
contacted HAYWARD and others and indicated the paper should not
pe distributed, although it was noted that one’ copy had already
been distributed to the front door of the Good Morning Teaspoon.
Informant subsequently determined that CLAY's reason for

removal of these bulletins was that one of the names indicated
on the list was known only to CLAY and publication of this man's
name and background would have positively identified CLAY as the
source of information relative to this individwl's activities.

Informant, on 12/6/68, indicated he had attended a
meeting of the Lakeside Conservative Council held at the Weslian.
Church, Lakeside, on River Street, attended by approximate 26
individuals. The film was shown on gun control laws which film
was made available by the Patriotic Society. Informant identified
some of those present as WALT HAYWARD, BILL CLAY, STAN MC’ DADE, ~

- JERRY GIYER, ROBIE ROBINSON, and this ROBINSON is employee of

the telephone company, and others whose names were unknown to
informant. Informant indicated he believes MC DADE is active
in tre Patriotic Society, and described him as a white male,

approximately 45 to 50 years of age, 5! 9", 225 pounds, dark

hair, wears a goatee and mustache. :

Informant furnished the address of WALTER HAYWARD as
12067 Riverside Drive, Lakeside, California, telephone 448-2954,
He indicated that at a meeting on 12/6/68, HAYWARD, CLAY and
others present, discussed ways and means of agitating the Peace
and Freedom Party and the Black Panther Party to get them to
fight among themselves, Informant said that the latest publication
of the Patriotic Party had been a survival bulletin which poneaee
direct quotations from Staff Publication.

Informant said that since the gun control law has become
so common that numerous individuais have been attempting to obtain
and hide as-many weapons and as much ammunition as possible.
Informant said he had recently determined that JERRY GIYER in
addition to possessing many other weapons, has a ,50 caliber Colt
machine gun, @n anti-tank rifle, a line-throwing gun, and an

“M-14 rifle. Informant advised on 12/9/68, that WALT HAYWARD and

BILL CLAY had recently attended a Swap Meet where they sold
approximately fifteen dollars of miscellaneous items and intended



SD 134-914

to use the cash raise in a publication not of various bulletins.
Informant said that he learned that a Black Panther Party
meeting had taken place the previous Friday evening and on
notifying WALT HAYWARD of thi., HAYWARD made several telephone
calls, attempting to agitate the Black Panthers and to create
friction between the Panthers and the Peace and Freedom Party.

Informant said LYLE MANNING recently advised that an
individual by the name of MARCUS from Phoenix, Arizona, has been
in San Diego, and is interested in selling weapons. Informant
indicated it appears that MARCUS is well imown as a weapons
Gistributor and has been known to sell weapons to the Israeli
Government, He indicated MARCUS had a recoilless rifle 106
millimeter, which he was asking $3000 for. Informant said he
| learned thai MARCUS was willing to stash a large number of weapons

in a cache in the San Diego area, if right wingers in this erea

could prove to him that there were a sufficient number of
dangerous left wingers to create a need for such a weapons supply.

MANNING and FRANK YODUS, the local area representative for

Liberty Arms, co-owners of the Hanging Tree Swap Shov, continue

in business. Informant said he does not know the extent of their

. Buccéss in this new business as yet. MARCUS was further described
i --. » a8-@ wholesale meat packer and an owner of at least one
t - ‘ department store in the Phoenix, Arizona area.

: Informant said MIKE VEJVODA has someone who is assisting
; him financially in printing numerous handbills which bills are
being passed out in left wing neighborhoods in an attempt to
agitate and create disturbances. VEJVODA is apparently very
interested in making an example of some left winger and has
indicated he plans to burn someone's house down or possibly take
EEC Some individual out into the desert to kill them to make an
example out of them. Informant said he advised BILL CLAY of this
information and CLAY told VEJVODA that if he should do such 2
: thing, his life would be taken himself. Informant advised that
BETTIE HAUGHTON is completely inactive in Minutemen activities
at this time and no information has been received regarding the
. whereabouts of ROBERT DE PUGH or PEYSON. >

by Minutemen. They also discussed the possibility of obtaining

of a phantom militia to be established as a front for the
Mnutemen and it was indicated that such names as "The Fox",
"Secret American Militia", " Blue Ox Society", and "Swamp-

Fox" were considered as names for this phanton militia.
Informant said the purpose for this phantom militia would be

to write letters and conduct other business in an anonymous .

discussion with BILL CLAY indicated a push toward the
phantom militia considering publication of black power

against black organizations.

the office of the ROTC, Madison High School, San
Diego, California. The above guns were subsequent-
ly discovered to be buried in a remote area east of
El Cajon, California and were recovered and return-
ed to the school. Investigation to locate the ammu~
nition was conducted. On 4/13/67, informant advised
that he had observed GERALD GIYER selling large
quantities of .22 caliber ammunition at a swap meet
at a drive-in theater in El Cajon, California during
a recent weekend. Investigation was conducted to
determine if this ammunition was identical with that
stolen from the ROTC office; however, no conclusion
could be reached inasmuch as the ammunition could not
be identified.

Informant has furnished numerous copies of.
articles and material obtained by him from the re-
sidence of TROY HAUGHTON. ‘The material deals primar- \
ily with instructions regarding military type opera-
tions as well as considerable ant-Semetic literature.

On 7/27/67, informant reported. that he had
accompanied BILL CLAY, active in Minutemen activities,
on the previous weekend when CLAY traveled throughout
the remote areas east of San Diego, California on
various Indian Reservations during which time CLAY
was attempting to discover abandoned mines and any
other appropriate areas deemed to be useful in storing
arms caches, Informant reported that during this time
while with CLAY, CLAY referred to the theft of Browning 1
automatic rifles a machine gun and ammunition stolen from i
the ROTC at Madison High School during February, 1967.
CLAY said that if these weapons had been hidden better H
they would never have been found by Police Offices.
Informant reported that CLAY did not specifically say
he knew who had been responsible for the theft of these
weapons and ammunition but did give the general impress~
ion that he had such knowledge.

On 5/19/67, informant advised that several
thousand "hippies" planned to congregate at Ramona,
California during 5/20 - 21/67. Informant reported
that the "Minutemen" planned to create trouble among
the "hippies" so that as a result of this, the "hippies"
would try to take over the town of Ramona, California.

Informant reported that the idea behind the
"Minutemen" participating in the activity was so the
people of Ramona would become alert to the fact that
"it can happen in their town".

Informant advised that the "Minutemen"
planned to spread sugar cubes throughout the town
of Ramona to give the impression that thecubes con-
tained LSD, They intended to change highway signs
and road markers to create confusion and to direct
arriving "hippies" to local Indian Reservations thus
creating the possibility of clashes between local
Indians and the "hippie groups". Informant said the
"Minutemen" planned to collect bags of dog waste
material and distribute this throughout the city of
Ramona so that the "hippies" would be blamed for this .
act. All information furnished by informant was fur-
nished to local law enforcement agencies. On the first

. day of the scheduled "love in" the San Diego County

Sheriff's office and California Highway Patrol es-
tablished a command post in the vicinity of Ramona
Oaks Ranch, Ramona, California following which ten
arrests were made of adults and juveniles for poss-
ession of marijuana and LSD. A road block was set
up in the vicinity by the California Highway Patrol
to check on the safety of vehicles traveling in the
vicinity. It was reported that this apparently dis-
couraged a number of individuals from attending the
"love in" at Ramona Oaks Ranch as the attendance did
not exceed more than 300 or 400 participants. The
informant reported following this activity that the
members of te "Minutemen" group who attempted to cause
trouble in the area were dissuaded because of the law
enforcement officers being present in the community.

mation.regarding the activities of the Minuteman organization

against other unrelated activities and has provided coverage
end penetration of a number of New Left oriented groups and

was JERRY LYNN DAVIS, known to the informant for several years
as a member of the Minuteman organization. At the show,
contact was made with a third party, EUG: BRIM, a reporter
for the "Anaheim Bulletin" and an associate of members of the
Minuteman organigation in the Los Angeles, California, area,

if not a member himself.

During the show, several arrests were made, some by
the lcchol, Tcbacco and Firearms’ Division (ATFD). Because
of these arrests and long held attitudes on the part of

ZVIS and BROWN that, although Communism and Sccialism pose
threats to their security, the government of this country is
their real enemy, a decision was reached by BROWS and DAVIS
that retaliation should be made against the government by
bombing TFD and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) offi
Plans were made for the three to meet again the following
Saturday evening at a motel in or near the City of El Cejon,
California, the exact time and place not then specified. At,
this meeting, final plans would be made for the bombing end
specific targets selected, cne in the Los Angeles, California,
area which BROWN would handle, and one at San Di ego, California,
which DAVIS would handle. —_—.

In apparent furtherence of this scheme, DAVIS
delivered to the informant on two occasions, two metal
ammunition cans for storage and safekeeping. These cans were
found te contain several pounds of TNT explosives, 18 hand
grenade fuse assemblies, two rifle grenades, approximately
275 blasting caps of various sizes and types, a military hand
illuminating grenade, a number of parts for converting M1
and M15 rifles to the correspending M-2 and 1+16 fully
automatic weapons and other miscellaneous items. This
material was turned over to the Federal Bureau of Investigation
by the informant on June 25, 1971, and was in turn given to
ATFD for. possible use as evidence by that agency.

ASsistant U.S. Attorney STEPHEN G. ELSON, then
Chief of the Complaint Section, U.S. Zttorney's Office, San
Diego, California, was contacted on June 25, 1971, and
stated that, as then developed, the facts in this case did
not represent a prosecutable violation and that additional

evidence, such as photographs and tape recordings substantiating
the ccnspiratorial meeting to take place on the evening of

June 26, 1971, would be necessary. For as yet unexplained
reasons, subject BROWN did not appear for the meeting on the
evening of June 26, 1°71, and has not subsequently been seen

or heard from by either the informant. or subject DAVIS. Informant
has advised that to his knowledge no additional plans have been
made or work done toward carrying out the above-described
ponbings.

On duly 20, 1971, subject DAVIS requested that the
hand illuminating grenade included in the explesives given by
him to the infcrmant, be returned to him cn the weekend of
July 24 - 25, 1971, indicating he hed some use for the weapon
but not elaborating further on tne matter.

: On July 23, 1971, following consultation with Assistant
U.S. ZSttorney ROBERT P. RISSO, newly appointed Chief of the
Criminal Complaint Section, and with representatives of the San
iDFD office, authorization was granted by REISSC and by

DED for ¢ the hand illuminating grenade to be returned tc DVIS
through the informant This was only to be done on the condition
that the illuminating grenade was effectively deactivated.

-At this same time, RISSO stated he saw no possible
way to obtain successful presecution of DAVIS in this matter.
Furthermore, he acvised that he would in no way avthorize
return of the remaining items of explosives to DAVIS.

On July 23, and 26, 1971, the source pointed out
chat DAVIS' request that the hand illuminating grenade -be
returned to hi ints up the fact that his request for other
parts or all of the items entrusted by him tc the informant
is imminent. Because of his association with DAVIS, whom
the infcrmant believes to be bordering on being mentaliy
irrational, infcrmant is convinced that for whatever reaso ny,
when it becomes necessary for him to tell DAVIS he cannot return
these materials te him it will beccne obvi
informant is exactly that or has in some other way betrayed him,
and that DAVIS will then teke reprisal of a violent nature :
against the informant and his family.

JERRY LYM DVIS, ALSO RNCWN 1S
Sih D..VIS; ZUGENE BROWS

Inasmuch as the explosives cannot be returned, the
informant hes petitioned that he and his fanily be relocated
in some other part of the country out of DVIS! reach, To
this end, informant is willing to leave his home and an
excellent employment but does not asi for another job.
Informant has stated a personal preference fo. relocation
at Boise, Idaho, which he feels would be a safe location
as it is not a place to which he would be expected to go.

On July 27, 1971, Special Investigator STEVE
LOGAN, ZTFD, Sen Diego, was contacted regarding the matter
of relocating the informant. LOGAN stated that he was not
in a position to make a determination on a cuestion of that
nature but stated he did not believe that #TFD would accept
such a responsibility unless the informant had served as
a witness in an ATFD prosecution.

For the Bureau's information, it is noted that the
parents offep 115$:R)have been aware of his accivities in
behalf of The Bureau, inasmuch as informant counselled with
them at the time he was initially approached with regard to
performing services for the TBI. Over the years, through
casual contact, informant's parents have become fairly

well acquainted with many of the individuals with whom the
informant has associated in his capacity as a source of
information, including JERRY LYNN DAVIS, Based on their
knowledge of these individuals they have expressed considerable
concern, not only for the safety of their son and his family,
but also for other members of their own family.

i No assurances: with vegard to relocation or securing
employment for the informant have been made either to the
informant or his parents.

With regard to the remark cf the informant's father
as to his "friends" in Washington, D.C., the inference of this
remark was interpreted as being that if the FBI did not help
SD 1155-R as to relocation, Mr. GODFREY might seek the
assistance of his "friends" in Washington, This remark was
not further pursued with Mr. GODFREY.

File No. August 2, 1971

JERRY LYNN DAVIS;
EUGENE BROWN

The following is information in addition to our
communication dated July 27, 1971:

On July 26, 1971, the informant who has furnished
the previous information in this case, was approached on
the subject of relieving him of custody of certain explosive
materials previously furnished to him by subject DAVIS, by
the use of a search warrant for the explosives at his home.
The search warrant, it was felt, would serve the purpose of
explaining to DAVIS why this informant could not produce. the
explosives. After lengthy consideration, the informant
declined to accept this suggestion as a workable solution to
the problem. The informant is convinced that regardless of
the reason given, when he advises DAVIS he no longer has
possession of the explosives, DAVIS's anger will cause him to
become irrational to the point that he would commit some act
or acts of violence against the informant or his family.
Informant continued to be of the opinion that: due to the fact
the explosives could not be made available for return to DAVIS,
the only safe course of action for him and his family would
be relocation in an area where the informant and his family
would be out of DAVIS's reach.

On July 28, 1971, the informant's parents tele-
phonically contacted the San Diego Division of the FBI. They |
advised that based on their knowledge of JERRY LYNN DAVIS,
and other individuals with whom their son had been associating,
they felt his concern for the personal safety of both himself
and his family was completely justified. The parents advised
that they contemplated moving tothe state of Hawaii in the
near future for reasons of health,

In addition, the parents indicated they were not
satisfied solely with the possibility of the informant's
relocation to Boise, Idaho, and felt that in addition to
relocation, the Federal Bureau of Investigation should secure
a job for the informant at the place of relocation comparable
to the $12,00U a year job he presently holds at San Diego,
The parents advised they had suggested to informant the
possibility of his relocation in Hawaii, as they felt there
should be en abundance of employment opportunities with the
U.S. Government in that state and that the Federal Bureau of
Investigation should be able to get one for their son without
too much diificulty.

During this conversation, the informant's father
advised he (the father) has friends in Washington, D.C., and
that if it appeared help might be necessary in obtaining
authorization for relocation and the securing of employment
for the informant, he would be glad to contact these people
for any assistance they might be able to render.

On July 29, 1971, the informant was recontacted at
which time he stated he had continued to give the matter of
relocation considerable thought. He pointed out that his
parents have, for some time, been trying to convince him of
the desirability of moving to the state of Hawaii. He explained
that his parents have resided and visited in that state several
times, and are contemplating moving there permanently in the
near future for health and business reasons. Informant
advised he personally continues to feel that relocation at
Boise, Idaho, would be more advantageous to him. He stated
he would appreciate assistance from'the Federal Bureau of
Investigation in finding employment there.

Informant further advised that the home in which
he lives at San Diego is being purchased through a Federal
Housing Administration (FHA) loan and has a current market
value of approximately $20,000. He said that subsequent to
making the original estimate of $1,500 to $2,000, as the cost
of relocating him to another place, the points required
for liquidating FHA loans have raised from 2 to 10.

He said that this meant that while originally it would have
cost him only $400 to pay off his FHA loan, he is now faced
_with the problem of paying $2,000 to do the same thing. The
informant feels that it will now cost him approximately

$3,000 to $3,500 to relocate at Boise, Idaho.

EXTREMIST INFORMANT 7 pte

This is to advise of information developed by captioned
informant disclosing a shooting incident arising from activities
\of the newly organized white extremist Secret Army Organization,

By memorandum dated 1/11/72, you were advised of the
formation and accivities of the newly formed ultraconservative
white extremist paramilitary group known as Secret Army Organiza- ..
tion (SAO), SAO has targeted for harassment San Diego State
College Professor Peter Bohmer. Bohmer's residence is a well-knowm
New Left commune, whose occupants, along with Bohmer, are planning |
demonstrations at the Republican National Convention scheduled at
San Diego for August, 1972.

Captioned informant, a 28-year-old white male operated
since August, 1967, has been recently targeted to penetrate the
extremist~oriented SAO. On January 6, 1972, informant was
requested by SAO leader to surveil. Bohmer's residence in orde f is)
obtain intelligence information. Accompanying informant on. “i
.surveillance was SAO associate George M. Hoover. ~The surveillance,
,held during the evening of January 6, 1972, was discontinued after.
*the Bohmer residence appeared unoccupied. However, prior to
discontinuance, an SAO sticker was left at the front door. While
passing in front of the house in informant's automobile, Hoover,
without warning and to the complete dismay of informant, fired

two shots into the house. The informant strongly protested and
they sped away. A female occupant of the house reportedly

d hy d he Lb
sustained minor gunshot wound in her elbow. /3 fos ie 7. 2 wy /4- a

Memorandum to Mr. E. S. Miller
Rez SD 1155-E
134-17222

Informant furnished details of the shooting, which
would not have been available through any other source, and
cautioned that Hoover is "fired up” over the incident and ready
for a violent confrontation should police approach him on this
matter, Identities of those involved in shooting not known to
San Diego police; however, witnesses did furnish description of
‘informant's automobile.

This informant, during his utilization, has furnished
excéptionally valuable information on the Minutemen and has bee
completely reliable. He has been previously cautioned, as all
extremist informants are, not to become directly involved in
violent confrontations or activities. He is the only Bureau
source Govering the violence-prone SAO. San Diego has advised
that pertinent information developed by informant will be
furnished to the San Diego Police Department but informant's
identity withheld unless disclosure becomes necessary, There
appears to be no objection to this, and San Diego will be
instructed to closely follow this matter and promptly report
pertinent developments.

to be a world-wide communist conspiracy for revolution, {
including direct communication between U. S. revolutionaries
and the Japanese. Miller stated that some American servicemen i

“were sympathetic with the world revolutionaries and were being i
used as couriers. Miller explained he had developed this : \

- information while doing research in Japan. He requested Fy
information as to whether the FBI knew of the “situation.”

By airtel August 21, 1972, the Los Angeles Office . i
was advised of Miller's August llth letter and was instructed
to interview him. The Los Angeles Office further was instructed
to advise Miller of the confidential nature of information contained
in Bureau files and to alert him regarding the jurisdictions of

MATTER “= TSR

Page 8 of

the February, 1974, issuc of "The Thunderbolt"
(IT), a monthly

svaper of the NSRP, contains three articles

eritical of the FSI and, in part, of former Director J. Edgar :
Hoover. The NSRY is an antiblack, anti-Sonitic, white racist ]
political party headcuartered in Marietta, Georgla, which is
composed of past members of klan-type organizations. TT is
edited by Dr, Edward R. Fields whe-is SRY National Secretary.

The Lead article is captioned "FBI Turned Into Secret .
Police." It discusses a len-thy written report allepedly given by +
former FEI Assistant to the Director William C. Sullivan to the
White House, in which Sullivan "revealed" former Director Hoover
"was net of sound mind in his last years"; how Director Hoover i
allegedly "kept flles on Consressmen and blackmailed them; anc
how the FRI allegedly comaitted illegal acts in "prosecuting white
patriots'' for many years, The article alleges that former
White House aide John Dean III gave a copy of Sullivan's report Sy
to the Senate Watergate Committee (SHC); however, the SWC has yy
allogedly suppressed it, keaders axe urged te write their ¥
Congressmen and the SWC demanding release of the "Sullivan Report." >}

The article further alleses the FBI hes been “wrecking
patriotic organizations" while only “siving lip service to the
against communisa," and has experienced a “loss of reputation."

Newsparer "Lhe Thunderbolt!

ft says a need exists to repeal antigun and similar laws that
enable Federal agents to "impose a police state,“ An analosy
is made between allered FBI tactics and Russian "seeret poliaa”
tactics. Yhe article closes by urging readers te refuse to
ensver questions from "federal arents."

The second article is e reprint from the "Atlante
Journal," 5/15/73 issuc, by Jack Nelson, captioned "FBI's loover
Called ‘Hot OF Sound Mind.'' The article essentially states
that wiretap files Located by the FRI in a Nhite Nouse safe vere
kept from former Dircetor Hoover because he was "not of sound
mind in his last years." Former FBI official Willie. Sullivan
reportedly turned the files over to then Assistant Attorney General
Lobert Hariian, before “Hooyer forced Sullivan to retire frou
tLe FRI om October 6, 1971," since the Late Director "eould
not bi trusted to keep the records confidential." Sullivan is
quoted as saying former Director Hoover "was a master blackneiler.....
with considerable finesse, despite the deterioration of his mind."

The third article 1s captioned "FBI Framcup Fails."
It relates thot George M, Hoover, a member of the Secret Army
Organization (340) was convicted last year of firing into the
hone of a “ierxist radical" of S5an Diego, Cal This
conviction vas overturned on aypeal on the basis the jury should
heave been informed the sole witness testifying against Hoover

was a "paid PBI infomiant.'"' This informant is identified as
Howard Berry Godfrey, and the article all

es Godfrey "constantly
encouraged violence," was "allowed" by the FBI to participata in
acts of violence, and used "entrapment"! to involve Hoover in
the shooting incident, It is stated this sucecasful appeal by
Hoover of his "Framcup" is an “outstanding victory for patriots
everywhere, and exposes "how far Government agents wlil so to
wrees petriotic groups."

at a drive-in theater in El Cajon, California during

- be identified.

_ Sidence of TROY HAUGHTON. The material deals primar-
ily with instructions regarding military type opera-
tions as well as considerable ant-Semetic literature.

ion that he had such knowledge.

On 5/19/67, informant advised that several
thousand "hippies" planned to congregate at Ramona,
California during 5/20 ~ 21/67. Informant reported
that the "Minutemen" planned to create trouble among
the "hippies" so that as a result of this, the "hippies"
would try to take over the town of Ramona, California.

Informant reported that the idea behind the
“Minutemen" participating in the activity was so the
people of Ramona would. become alert to the fact that
"it can happen in their town".

Informant advised that the "Minutemen"

planned to spread sugar cubes throughout the town
of Ramona to give the impression that thecubes con-
tained LSD. They intended to change highway signs
and road markers to create confusion and to direct
arriving "hippies" to local Indian Reservations thus
creating the possibility of clashes between local
Indians and the “hippie groups". Informant said. the
"Minutemen" planned to collect bags of dog waste

7 5 material and distribute this throughout the city of
Ramona so that the “hippies” would be blamed for this
act. All information furnished by informant was fur-
nished to local law enforcement agencies. On the first
day of the scheduled “love in" the San Diego County
Sheriff's Office and California Highway Patrol es-
tablished a command post in the vicinity of Ramona
Oaks Ranch, Ramona, California following which ten
arrests were made of adults and juveniles for poss-
ession of marijuana and LSD. A road_block was set
up in the vicinity by the California Highway Patrol
to check on the safety of vehicles traveling in the
vicinity. It was reported that this apparently dis-
couraged a number of individuals from attending the
"love in" at Ramona Oaks Ranch as the attendance did
not exceed more than 300 or 400 participants. The
informant reported following this activity that the
members of te "Minutemen" group who attempted to cause
trouble in the area were dissuaded because of the law
enforcement officers being present in the community.

JERRY LYNN DAVIS,
Also Known as Sam Davis;
EUGENE BROWS

-The following is information in addition to our
communications dated June 29, 1971 and July 7, 1971.

For the past four and one-half years, the San
wiedo Division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation has
been operating an inferment who has been highly successful
in penetrating the Minutenan organization in the San Diego,
California, area, In this capacity, infcrmant has performed
an outstanding service to the government and to the nation
in acquiring and making available a large volume of infor-
mation regarding the activities of the Minuteman organization
and reated groups. In addition, due to the nature of his
employment, infermant has been successfully targeted
against other unrelated activities and has provided coverage
and penetration cf a number of New Left oriented groups and
demonstrations. The scope of information provided by the
source has often extended beyond the immediate Sen Diego
area to other parts of the nation. He also has been
instrumental in identifying and following the activities of
many individuals who are of interest to the Federal Bureau
of Investigation. Informant has at all times been found
to be stable, trustworthy and reliable.

The Kinutemen is a paramilitant group

organized in June, 1960, by ROBERT B, DE

PUGH in Norborne, Missouri, as a resistance

to the spread of communism in the United

States by use of guerrilla tactics, DE PUGH

_is cirrently incarcerated in a Federal

penitentiary fer violation of the Federal

Firearms Act.

: On June 23, 1°71, source advised that on the previous
Saturday, June 19, 1°71, he was in attendance at a gun show
held at Pasadena, Califernia. Accompanying him to the show

“was JERRY. LYM DAVIS, known to the informant for several years
as a member of the Minuteman organization. At the show,
contact was made with a third party, BUCLEE BROWN, a reporter
for the "Anaheim Bulletin" and en associate of members of the
Minuteman organigation in the Los Angeles, California, area,
if not a member himself.

During the show, several arrests were made, sone by
the Alcohol, Tcbacco and Firearms Division (ATFD). Because ‘
of these arrests and long held attitudes on the part of qd
DAVIS and BROW that, altheugh Communism and Socialism pose t
threats to their secur , the government of this country is
their real enemy, a decision was reached by BROWN and DVIS
that retaliation should be made against the government by
bombing ATFD and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) offices. i
Plans were made for the three to meet again the following .
Saturday evening at a mote]. in or near the City of El Cajon, 7
California, the exact time and place not then specified. At, i |
this meeting, final plans would be made for the bombing and Hf
specific targets selected, one in the Los Angeles, California, i
area which BROWN would handle, and one at San Diego, Californie,
which DAVIS would handle. aa |

In apparent furtherance of this scheme, DAVIS
delivered to the informant on two occasions, two metal
ammunition cans for storage and safekeeoing. These cans were
found to contain several pounds of TNT explosives, 18 hand
grenade fuse assemblies, two rifle grenades, approximately
275 blasting caps of various sizes and types, a military hand
illuminating grenade, a number of parts for converting M1
and M-15 rifles to the corresponding M2 and M-16 fully
automatic weapons and other miscellaneous items. This

terial was turned over to the Federal Bureau of Investigation |
by the informant on June 25, 1971, and was in turn given to |
ATED for, possible use aes evidence by that agency.

ASsistant U.S. attorney STEPHEN G. NELSON, then }
Chief of the Complaint Section, U.S, Attorney's Office, San H
Diego, California, was contacted on June 25, 1971, and
stated that, as then developed, the facts in this case did

_ not represent a prosecutable violation and that additional

evidence, such as photographs and tape recordings substantiating
the conspiratorial meeting to take place on the evening of

June 26, 1971, would be necessery. Yor as yet unexplained
reasons, subject BROW did not epyear for the meeting on the
evening of June 26, 1°71, and has not subsequently been seen .
or heard from by either the informent or subject DVIS. Informant
has advised that to his knowledge no additicnal plans have been
made or work done toward carrying out the above-described
bombings.

On July 20, 1971, subject DAVIS requested that the
hand illuminating grenade included in the explosives given by
him to the infcrmant, be returned to him cn the weekend of |
July 24 ~ 25, 1971, indic ng he had some use fcr the weapon
but not elaborating further on the matter.

On July 23, 1971, following consultation with Assistant
Attorney ROBERT P, RISSO, newly appointed Chief of the
Laint Section, and with representatives of the San
Diege ice, authorization was gre mted by RISSC end by
ATED fcr’ the “hand illuminating grenade to be returned to DVIS
through the informant. This was only to be done on the condition
that the illuminating grenade was effectively deactivated.

at this same time, RISSO stated he saw no possible
way to obtain successful prosecution of DVIS in this. matter,
Furthermore, he advised that he would in no way avthorize
return of the remaining items of explosives to DAVIS.

On July 23, and 26, 1971, the source pointed out

that DAVIS! request that the hand illuminating grenade be
returned to him points uo the fact that his request fcr other
parts or all of the items entrusted by him te the informant

minent. Because cf his assceciation with DAVIS, whom
the inicrmant believes to be bordering on being mentally
irrational, infermant is convinced that for whatever reason,
when it becomes necessary for him to tell DVIS he cannot return
these materials to him it will become cbvious to DAVIS that the
informant is exactly that or has in some other way betrayed him,
and that DAVIS will then take reprisal cf a violent nature :
against the informant and his family.

Inasmuch as the explosives cannot be returned, the
informant hes petitioned that he and his fanily be relocated
in some other part of the country owt cf DVIS! reach. To
this end, infcrmant is willing to leave his home end an
excellent employment but does not ask fer another job.
Informent has stated a versonal preference for relocation
at Boise, Idahc, which he feels would be a safe location
as it is not a place to which he would be expected to go.

On July 27, 1971, Special Investigator STEVE
LOGAN , éDFD, Stn Diego, was contacted regarding the matter
of relecating the informant, LOGAN stated that he was not
in a position to make a determination on a question of that
nature but stated he cid not believe that ATFD would accept
such a responsibility unless the informant had served as
a witness in an ATFD prosecution.

EUGENE BROWN

The following is information in addition to our
communication dated July 27, 1971:

On July 26, 1971, the informant who has furnished
the previous information in this case, was approached on
the subject of relieving him of custody of certain explosive
materials previously furnished to him by subject DAVIS, by
the use of a search warrant for the explosives at his home.
The search warrant, it was felt, would serve the purpose of
explaining to DAVIS why this informant could net produce the
explosives. After lengthy consideration, the informant
declined to accept this suggestion as a workable solution to
the problem. The informant is convinced that regardless of
the reason given, when he advises DAVIS he no longer has
possession of the explosives, DAVIS's anger will cause him to
become irrational to the point that he would commit some act
or acts of violence against the informant or his family.
Informant continued to be of the opinion that: due to the fact
the explosives could not be made available for return to DAVIS,
the only safe course of action for him and his family would
be relocation in an area where the informant and his family
would be out of DAVIS's reach.

On July 28, 1971, the informant's parents tele-
phonically contacted the San Diego Division of the FBI. They
advised that based on their knowledge of JERRY LYNN DAVIS,
and other individuals with whom their son had been associating,
they felt his concern for the personal safety of both himself
and his family was completely justified. The parents advised
that they contemplated moving tothe state of Hawaii in the
near future for reasons of health.

JERRY LYNN DAVIS;

In addition, the parents indicated they were not
satisfied solely with the possibility of the informant's
relocation to Boise, Idaho, and felt that in addition to
relocation, the Federal Bureau of Investigation should secure
a job for the informant at the place of relocation comparable
to the $12,000 a year job he presently holds at San Diego.
The parents advised they had suggested to informant the
possibility of his relocation in Hawaii, as they felt there
should be an abundance of employment opportunities with the
U.S. Government in that state and that the Federal Bureau of
Investigation should be able to get one for their son without
too much difficulty.

During this conversation, the informant's father
advised he (the father) has friends in Washington, D.C., and
that if it appeared help might be necessary in obtaining
authorization for relocation and the securing of- employment
for the informant, he would be glad to contact these people
for any assistance they might be able to render.

On July 29, 1971, the informant was recontacted at
which time he stated he had continued to give the matter of
relocation considerable thought. He pointed out that his
parents have, for some time, been trying to convince him of
the desirability of moving to the state of Hawaii. He explained
that his parents have resided and visited in that state several
times, and are contemplating moving there permanently in the
near future for health and business reasons. Informant
advised he personally continues to feel that relocation at
Boise, Idaho, would be more advantageous to him. He stated
he would appreciate assistance from'the Federai Bureau of
Investigation in finding employment there.

Informant further advised that'the home in which
he lives at San Diego is being purchased through a Federal
Housing Administration (FHA) loan and has a current market
value of approximately $20,000. He said that subsequent to
making the original estimate of $1,500. to $2,000, as the cost
of relocating him to another place, the points required
for liquidating FHA loans have raised from 2 to 10.

i 5 He said that this meant that while originally it would have

i cost him only $400 to pay off his FHA loan, he is now faced

: with the problem of paying $2,000 to do the same thing. The
informant feels that it will now cost him approximately
$3,000 to $3,500 to relocate at Boise, Idaho.

informant disclosing a shooting incident arising from activities

{ * This is to advise of information developed by captioned
5 in:
tof the newly organized white extremist: Secret Army Organization.

’ By memorandum dated 1/11/72, you were advised of the
formation and activities of the newly formed ultraconservative
white extremist paramilitary group know as Secret Army Organiza-
tion (SAO). SAO has targeted for-harassment San Diego State
College Professor Peter Bohmer. Bohmer's residence is a well-known
New Left commune, whose occupants, along with Bohmer, are planning
demonstrations at the: Republican National Convention scheduled at
{San Diego for August, 1972. :

i Captioned informant, a 28-year-old white male operated
since August, 1967, has been recently targeted to penetrate the
extremist~oriented SAO. On January 6, 1972, informant was
requested by SAO leader to surveil Bohmer's residence in orde: i
-obtain intelligence information. Accompanying informant on/ :
;surveillance was SAO associate George M. Hoover. ~The surveillence,
held during the evening of January 6, 1972, was discontinued after
the Bohmer residence appeared unoccupied. However, prior to
discontinuance, an SAO sticker was left at the front door. While
passing in front of the house in informant's automobile, Hoover,

ag without warning and to the complete dismay of informant, fired
two shots into the house. The informant strongly protested and
they sped away, A female occupant of the house reportedly

sustained minor gunshot wound in her elbow. a 4}

Memorandum to Mr. E, S. Miller

134~17222

Informant furnished details of the shooting, which
would not have been available through any other source, and
cautioned that Hoover is "fired up" over the incident and ready
for a violent confrontation should police approach him on this
matter, Identities of those involved in shooting not known to
I San Diego police; however, witnesses did furnish description of
informant's automobile.

: This informant, during his utilization, has furnished
exceptionally valuable information on the Minutemen and has been
completely reliable. He has been previously cautioned, as all
extremist informants are, not to become directly involved in
violent confrontations or activities. He is the only Bureau
source covering the violence~prone SAO. San Diego has advised
that pertinent information developed by informant will be

— furnished to the San Diego Police Department but informant's
identity withheld unless disclosure becomes necessary. There
appears to be no objection to this, and San Diego will be
instructed to closely follow this matter and promptly report
pertinent developments.

* Brownfield to Jenkins Memo
JRE: LAURITZ P. MILLER

of the San Diego Office August 10, 1967, while employed as

an equipment-checker for Pacific Telephone and Telegraph
Company, San Diego, California. A gun hobbyist, Army trained
in the use of explosives, he became’ associated with the top

' echelon of the Minutemen as well as the Secret Army Organization
(SAO), furnishing excellent information to the FBI regarding

i “these and other extremists groups.

By communication dated November 20, 1972, the
San Diego Office discontinued Godfrey as an informant. Godfrey
shad testified in San Diego County Superior Court in the trial
of George Mitchell Hoover, SAO member charged with attempted
murder, and in the trial of William Francis Yakopec, who was
found guilty of the bombing of the Guild Theater in San Diego.
At that time, Godfrey also was scheduled to testify against
Jerry Lynn Davis, SAO leader charged with illegal possession
of explosives.

SA Petersen also testified in Hoover's trial and
. haa been Godfrey" s contacting Agent.

en As a result of Godfrey's appearances as a prosecution
witness, his identity as an FBI informant was publicized in the
news media. (137-17222, 157-17513-10)

* Regarding Miller:

Our files show that by letter dated November 30,
1971, Miller requested information regarding crimes committed
by juvenile females. He was furnished a Uniform Crime Reports
Bulletin.

Miller wrote to Acting Director Gray August 11,
1972, furnishing information regarding what he considered
to be a world-wide communist conspiracy for revolution,
including direct communication between U. S. revolutionaries
_and the Japanese. Miller stated that some American servicemen
were sympathetic with the world revolutionaries and were being
used as couriers. Miller explained he had developed this
- information while doing research in Japan. He requested
information as to whether the FBI knew of the "situation."

By airtel August 21, 1972, the Los Angeles Office
was advised of Miller's August 11th letter and was instructed
to interview him. The Los Angeles Office further was instructed
to advise Miller of the confidential nature of information contained
in Bureau files and to alert him regarding the jurisdictions of
the respective military services over their personnel.

-Brownfield to Jenkins Memo
RE: LAURITZ P. MILLER

ao Miller was subsequently advised by the Los Angeles
f Office per instructions and the information he furnished was
forwarded to the Legal Attache, Tokyo.

Miller also furnished similar information directly
to the Japanese National Police Agency (NPA), in August, 1972.
The NPA in October, 1972, advised the Legal Attache, Tokyo,
that NPA's inquiry failed to substantiate Miller's allegations.
(62115275)

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:

On March 6, 1973, ASAC Clark F. Brown, San Diego
Office, was telephonically advised of Miller's request to
interview SA Petersen in connection with the projected book.
ASAC Brown was advised that interview of SA Petersen would not
be authorized in view of regulations regarding revealing
information in Bureau files.

This matter has been coordinated with the Intelligence
Division and James L. Williamson of the Office of Legal Counsel.

RECOMMENDATION:

That the attached reply be sent to Miller. _

allowed Godfrey to participate
in the shooting, several fire-

before they arrested several
others using Godfrey as. their

_ Godfrey was so convincing
that he rose to: Assistant State

he was able to prove his.
“loyalty” to the, organization..
The court deemed this an act of
“entrapment.” The FBI pimp

superiors had the power to stop
them before they occurred.

It is the rec endation of the San Diego Office
that the Justice Department represent GODFREY as an agency
relationship existed. Also GODFREY's defense by Departmental
attorneys would establish continuity to the -answers to the

his role as an FRI informer would not be nade public and place

a member of the SAO, El Cajon, California, said he personally, fiz>
without the knowledge of other SAO members, waszesponsible for the
6/19/72 bombing of the Guild, a movie theater specializing in
pornographic films, 3827 Fifth Avenue, San Diego, and he identified
four pornography-oriented establishments as potential future bombing
targets. This information was furnished to the San Diego Police
Department (SDPD). ’

- On 6/25/72, Yakopec told the informant the location of
"explosives he had concealed in a vacant lot behind his residence,
This information was also furnished to the SDPD and a search of the
_Llot resulted in the confiscation of one two~and~one-quarter-pound

Memorandum to Mr. E, S. Miller
Re: Secret: Army Organization

Yakopec and Hoover were arrested and charged with attempted
murder and improper storage of gunpowder in excess of 20 pounds
without a license. Fleury and his wife, Genevieve, were arrested and
charged with improper storage of gunpowder in excess of 20 pounds. :
All four subjects are currently incarcerated in the San Diego County
Jail.

The source has expressed willingness to testify in this
matter if necessary to secure prosecutive action, The SDPD has
stated should the source's testimony become necessary steps would be
taken by that Department to insure protection of the source and his
family and that they would be relocated and suitable ieetene tia
obtained for the source,

Inasmuch as the preliminary facts regarding the bombing of
the Guild Theater failed to indicate involvement of members of a
terrorist or revolutionary group, under existing guidelines the
incident was one within the primary jurisdiction of the Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms Division and that agency was immediately
advised.

camoflage clothing. When investigated by his department,

it was determined that at that time ANDERSON was involved

in what was referred to as "simulated maneuvers" in the
woods.around the: Bothell, Washington area which PLANCICH
described as being heavily populated by farms and related
businesses. Also during the summer of 1969, a Bothell ©
Police Officer observed ANDERSON in the company -of several
other white males who were once again conducting some sort
of maneuvers. At this time the officer observed a shotgun

in one of the vehicles, which when measured was just 1/2 inch
over the legal Limit. During the early fall of 1969,
ANDERSON approached an officer of the Bothell Police Department
with a weapon to determine if it was legal and under the
‘ current interpretations of both Federal and state law, it
was opined that the weapon ANDERSON had was legal, but no
record was maintained as to the type of weapon.

PLANCICH stated that ANDERSON, in the past, has
purchased old Bothell Police Department vehides and it was
PLANCICH's opinion that ANDERSON did this to satisfy some
unknown egomania that he felt ANDERSON had. PLANCICH
stated that he knew of no violent acts committed by ANDERSON ari
at any time. |

group has been endeavoring to take on an organizational
structure since October, 1971. He states that, while the
group is motivated by the same principles which brought the
Minutemen into existence, the Secret Army Organization (SAO)
is taking a more cautious approach than the Minutemen in
its recruitment of membership, in order t6 avoid the
assimilation of people of poor reputation,

In California, notably in San Diego, the SAO
has recently had to sift the letters and applications being
received there because of the obvious eccentric type person
endeavoring to find acceptance in the group.

Concerning Arizona, source advised that the SAO
has mailed a considerable amount of literature pertaining
to the SAO to "conservative" thinking people, but has not
at thig time received response from the type of people they .
wish to affiliate. Consequently, no formal chapter or !
nucleus around which to organize has been formed in
Arizona, However, a coordinator has been named and is
operating.. Source advised that not all former Minutemen”
will be accepted into the SAO,

Source advised that the SAO foresees a decentralized
type of operation in each State, where in a revolutionary
situation brought about by treasonous communist elements,
the SAO could present a militant front immediately. Recent

SECRET ARMY ORGANIZATION

PX T-1 advised on April 26, 1972, that during
his contact with members of the Secret Army Organization
(SAO) in February, 1972, Sam Davis, also known as Jerry
Davis, and one Cy Anderson, posed the question to an SAO
group as to what measures could be taken by the SAO to
counter disruptions by revolutionary groups at the
Republican National Convention, This question was never
discussed at great length, but in this connection, one
member suggested that old junk-type cars be parked at ;
strategic locations where, in the event of confrontation +
with dissident elements, the SAO members could have access s
to the necessary weapons hidden in the cars, Since the nea
time of the above discussion, however, SAO leadership
appears to have had second thoughts on the matter because
he latter have been heard to say that they are going
to stay out of San Diego entirely during the Republican
National Convention in order to preclude any untoward ‘i
incident that could be attributed to the presence of 7 i
the SAO and redound to the discredit of the SAO. :

te eieitat teeta

7 Informant advised that he has not been present
when sources of weapons may have been discussed by the
SAO, but states that he is aware of the fact that leaders
of the SAO have attended gun shows at every opportunity,
notably at Yuma, Arizona, on October 15, 16, 1971, and
again at Yuma on February 25, 26, 1972, and at Phoenix,
Arizona, on March 25, 26, 1972.

Source advises that the Secret Army Organization
aaa ; is a new paramilitary group that has been
. formed in California to replace the Minutemen:

This is in response to your recent referral of a

“Secret Army Organization."

a The “Secret Army Organization" is apparently a
-paramilitary group with headquarters in San Diego,
California. The organization is currently mailing
unsolicited material of the type which ¢py€.gouezl received.
While the nature of this group and the materials they are
publishing are offensive to a vast majority of Americans,
groups such as this are guaranteed the right to organize
“and publish their views under the First Amendment to the-
Constitution guaranteeing freedom of speech ar.d of the
press. However, I hope you will assure fionf. Sus that
where evidence is developed which reflects a violation
, O£ Federal law, the Government will take the appropriate
- action. : F ss

> TheSecret Avmy Ozganization is a national‘orgari-
ization of patriotic Americans who are preparing:them-
selves asd last line of defense against comniunism. To
exemplify the necessity of such an organization, we quote
the 1960 Annual Reportof the Committee on Ua-American
Aptivities as follows:

“Events of the past year have provided convincing
evidence that the American people caunot rely completely
on this country's armed forces to protect themselves
from communist domination and slavery. This is not

« because our military forees lack the power or the will to

defend this country, but rather because the aature of the
attacks boing made on the United States by its major and
only significant enemy are so designed as to render con-
ventional military forces as ineffective as possible for
defense purposes."

Starting, from nothing 60 years ago, commuaism-
now rigidly coatrols one-third of the human race and has
subverted to varying degrees the remaining two-thirds.
In the past 20 years the communists have conquered 20
sovereign nations, one by armed conquest and 19 by in-
ternal subversion or negotiation,

There is not one of these countries in which the
commsnists rule by the consent of the people. Every-
where they must perpetuate themselves by terror. They

“Femain in power only through the use of ‘the most brutal

police state tactics. : ‘

‘The communists consider their party workers
not simply as an accessory to armed conquest but as the
actual spearhead of any invasion into new territory.
From this point of view the United States was "invaded!"
by Soviet troops more than 30 years ago. [t has baen
authoritatively estimated that the communists now have
an army of 500,000 combatants already landed on Ameri-
can shores and already working by the most insidious
means to destroy our American way of life,

‘The cold war is very real, It must be foight and
won, The only alternative is to lose and to lose means
that future Americans for generations to come must live
in terror and in slavery. Appeasement is futile. We
cannot bargain with moral barbarians whonever have and
Rever will know the meaning of honesty.

Communism must be defeated, not merely resist-
ed. We must rid our country of traitors and fellow trave-
Jers. We must embark on a massive offensive turning
everycommuaist trick - from propaganda to infiitration~
against our mortal enemy, This is the one and only way
to win the struggle for survival.

RICHARD NIXON (alias Cry-Baby Nixon, alieas Tricky Dicky) is an expert in disguises and
has successfully passed himself off as an anticommunist in the past, He may again try using
this disguise if pressed for votes in 1972. Saying one thing, then doing thie opposite is Nixon's
MOA. While he campaigned in 1968 on a platform of curtailing socialism he has in fact done

a more to establish a socialistic dictatorship than either of the last two Democrat administra-

tions. His economic policies have continued to enrich Big Industrialists while rising prices

and higher taxes have all but reduced the average worker to a state of financial slavery. ‘This
criminal has even made vicious attacks on small children (forced busing to acheive "racial
balance") and has caused the destruction of local school systems. WARNING: Nixon suffers
from an EMPEROR COMPLEX and becomes exiremeiy dangerous wien criticized.

bent . CAUTION .

: \*" telekery and deceit are Nixon's trade-marks. At'the present time Nixon and his chief hench-;

: a man HENRY (CZAR) KISSINGER are engaged in forming an alliance with another gang of

Pramnn i Cs thousands of Americans in the Korean War (shooting caplured soldiers and starving.and tor-

Gaaee turing prisoners of war). The RED CHINA GANG have been supplying the NORTH VIETNAM-

ESE BANDITS with weapons and bullets to kill American soldiers in another no-win war in

Vietnam, The very fact that Nixon is dealing with these ARCH ENEMIES OF FREEDOM is

Acmy Grganization (SAO) to engage in disruptive activities at the
forthcoming Republican National Convention in San Diego, were z
recontacted April 26, 1972, regarding latest developments in theseQ
plans. CGne informant indicated that 540 leaders appear to have =
had second thoughts regarding appearing at the Republican National .;-
Convention and thet they hava said they are going to stay out of
Sen Diego during the Convention to preclude any incident that a,
could be attributed to the presence of the SAC which would dis- sl
credit the organization. Another informant reported there were ;
no recent developments in the plans of Davis and the SAO and thet
| due to the time interval until the Republican National Convention
plans had enly reached the speculation or discussion stage, ‘This
informant indicated actual plans and activities of the SAG would

and claims Davis assured him this rifle was alse altered to fire
semi-automatic only. This carbine is maintained in Davis' bedroom
at his residence, 2393 Washington Street, Spring Valley, California.

Gn September 28, 1971, the informant observed Davis in
possession of two blocks cf C-4 plastic explosive, weighing two

This individual was described to source, and was a retired
military man, who recently completed training in insurance
investment and is to begin work soon with a large insurance
company in the San Diego area.

Los Angeles, California, Area

Source advised that according to DAVIS, one SAM
NAPIER has recently joined the SAO and is allegedly assisting
DAVIS in his attempts to organize the SAO in the Los Angeles,
California, area. Source said that according to DAVIS,
NAPIEF was formerly associated in the Los Angeles area with
the National Socialist American Workers Party (NSAWP) under
SCOTT WINCHESTER, but left that group. DAVIS claimed NAPIER
has allegedly recruited another SAO member whose name ‘is not
known to the source. Furthermore, DAVIS claims to have three
additional SAO members in the Los Angeles area, one who resides
at Carson, California, and another ‘iho is supposed to move to
the State of Oregon in the near future. The identities of
these three individuals are not known to the source.

Seattle, Washington, Area

Source advised that according to DAVIS, CY ANDERSON
and another individual named (FNU) BAGWELL are allegedly
members of the SAO in that city. DAVIS claims ANDERSON
has recruited additional members for the organization there.

Phoenix, Arizona, Area

Source advised that an individual named EVERETT
MOORE at Phoenix, Arizona, is allegedly a member of the SAO.
Source said DAVIS claims that the jorgest single group of SAO :
members is supposed to be located at Phoenix under the iy
direction of MOORE. Source said DAVIS has indicated that
SAO recruiting literature which is distributed in Arizona
has its own separate Post Office Box number in the San Diego
area, this number not being known to the source. Mail received
at this post office box is picked up by DAVIS and sent, sealed
to MOORE for his use.

In addition, DAVIS claims that the individual who
was formerly leader of the Bishop Faction of the American
Nazi Party at Phoenix, Arizona, and one of his associates,
have joined the SAO and sent a full year's dues at one time.
This first individual was also alleged to be State Director
for the State of Arizona for SCOTT WINCHESTER's group, the
NSAWP, According to DAVIS, these individuals Tete the NSAWP
in order to join the SAO.

Las Vegas, Nevada, Area

Source advised he is not exacvly sure what is happen-
ing with regard to the SAO at Las Vegas, and added DAVIS has oi
indicated he thinks he will have to make another trip to Las fs
Vegas in order to get things going well there for the SAO, 7

Source advised that the SAO appears to have been :
receiving a considerable quantity of mail from several places y
in the United States, but primarily from the Western states.
He said most membership fees and dues have been sent by money
_order and that DAVIS has a business establishment located in
El Cajon, California, which will allow him to cash these money
orders signing any name to them he wishes.

Source said that as a rough estimate he would guess
that approximately 40 membership applications have been
received so far by the SAO. He said he felt the identities
of many of these may never come to his attention.

LEADS

All receiving offices are requested to alert appropriate
informants and sources of information to the SAO to identify
actual and potential members of this organization. Thereafter,

= individuals identified should be promptly and thoroughly
investigated to determine their potential for violence and
disruptive activities during the Republican National Convention.

authority is received to determine their informant potential and
whether they present a threat of violence. Las Vegas should be

alert for information regarding the formation of an SAO chapter

within its territory, and upon receipt of such information, immediately
advise the Bureau and initiate an investigation in line with the

above instructions. ;

Phoenix, Los Angeles and Seattle are to submit results of
investigations in form suitable for dissemination regarding SAO to
reach Bureau no later than 5/19/72. In cover communications list
names of members and whether investigation being conducted. Also
include statement whether sufficient informant coverage of SAO is
available, and if not, what corrective steps are being taken.

San Diego reopen investigations of those members named in
referenced airtel which have been closed in order that their
activities can be followed,

In view of the efforts to recruit new members, San Diego
and recipient offices should take advantage of this opportunity to
increase informant coverage so that a more complete analysis of
this group can be made, San Diego, particularly, should expand its
informant coverage so that all SAO members can be identified and
advance plans for violence can be determined. :

NOTE:

The SAO is an ultraconservative, paramilitary organization
elandestinely formed during the Fall of 1971 in Arizona, The organi-
gation, which is headquartered in the San Diego territory, has
confined its organizational efforts to the Rocky Mountain states.
Estimated membership is approximately 40. Several former Minutemen
are members and they use much of the same training material as the
Minutemen. Immediate’ investigation is necessary to identify members
and plans of this grovp as Jerry Lynn Davis, SAO leader and organi-
zer, plans disruptive action at Republican National Convention.

SECRET ARMY ORGANIZATION (SAO)

On March 7, 1972, Confidential Source PX T-1, who
has furnished reliable information in the past, advised
that five members of the Secret Army Organization (SAO) met
a second time at the fairgrounds at Yuma, Arizona on February
25 and 26, 1972, incidental to the gun show which was in
progress there, as sponsored by KIWANIS, Thosg who met.
together were Jerry™Bavis, also known as 8 , avis;. Barry
dafirey, also known as Howard < sodirey ; StabiMcDade; Bill
ette and one other unknowi pérson, Califorhia vehicies
Caring license plates 99704~F and VES-494 were noted as belonging
té this group.

At the meeting, Davis discussed the Republican
National Convention which will be held in San Diego this
year and which could be beset with problems from dissident
groups with intent to disrupt the convention. In this
connection, Davis spoke in terms of having an SAO training
session some time before the convention for the purpose of
preparing to control and counter dissident elements in the
event the latter should get out of hand.

Source advised that the SAO is confining its recruiting
‘efforts to the Racky Mountain States, but that the group has
established contact with former Minutemen in Michigan and
Maryland,

Source, who is familiar with the political philosophy
of the Minutemen, advised that the training material being used
by the SAO is Minutemen material with an SAO caption to it;
that, however, the political philosophy of the SAO is somewhat
nebulous and in the formative stage, Source explained that
the SAO appears to be playing down the anti-communist fight

and to be injecting themselves into any political matter
which they deem to be un-American or fraught with political

intrigue,

In this connection, the SAO has produced a Wanted

Flyer captioned, "WANTED FOR TREASON-NIXON" wherein the
SAO depicts President Nixon with photograph as a criminal
for having gone to China to "form an alliance with another
gang of criminals, the Red Chinese." A copy of this flyer
is being made a part of this memorandum,

captioned,

The Minutemen is a paramilitant group organized
in June, 1960, by Robert B. DePugh in Norborne,
Missouri, as a resistance to the spread of
communism in the United States by use of
guerrilla tactics. DePugh is currently
incarcerated in a Federal penitentiary for
violation of the Federal Firearms Act.

The Patriotic Party has been the political arm
of the Minutemen, i

basic training programs are hereby urged to do so. We cannot, in most cases,
assign any member to an impoztant underground project or to an organized team
or group until they have completed this training program.

While headquarters caniot assign a member in the above classification to
. an established unit, any member can (and is encouraged to) recruit and form their
own combat team (see December 1971 Bulletin). In many cases this may be the °
best policy in regards to personal security as the member would be working with
‘the people he personally knows and trusts. If any member would like to form their
own unit they should write to their assigned mail drop and the organization will send
“them further instructions along with 2 Team Recruiting Packet. The’article on .

wish to form their own Combat Team. :

We are enclosing a small number of S.A. 0. stickers with this month's
bulletin. Please put them in your shirt pocket or billfold and as soon as possible
stick them up in phone booths, at bus stops, or other public places that you visit.
The stickers are already gummed and when wet will adhere firmly to glass, metal,
or any other smooth surface. If our members would use these stickers along with
the leaflets that are available, it would have a real psychological impact on the
rest of the American people and give them evidence that there are still those among

* them who are willing to fight for the re-establishment of a Constitutional Republic.
These first stickers are being sent to cach member free, additional stickers and
leaflets can be ordered on the monthly report form.

wo... ° y+ aHE DISPERSED TEAM —uxi

: When discussing a Secret Army Organization "Combat Team", we usually think
-of a small group of people who live very close to one another, Such an arrangement

has certain advantages, such as ease of communication and travel for collective
training and team operations, but there are also several disadvantages.

Among the disadvantages are these:’ Team members may be well acquainted
‘with only a small geographical area. If forced to leave this area the team may be
*, placed at a serious disadvantage. It is harder for a team of SAO members who
live closely together to keep from attracting attention, thus unit security may be
poor. If one yp ember of the team is ever discovered and arrested by the enemy,
* chances are that all members of the team will be rounded up together.

: These considerations have caused us to experiment with a new arrangement that
we refer to as a "Dispersed Team". Such a team has the same number of members
-(usually six) as a regular Combat Team, Each team is split into two sections as is
the old team. The members have the same type of individual specialties and duties.

The big difference lies in the fact that the team members may be located over
..4 comparatively larger area - perhaps as much as 25 to 50 miles in diameter. In
urban areas one team-member may live in each of six different cities. Thus the
team may range over a fairly large geographical area With at least one team member
being familiar with the immediate territory through which they are traveling.

. -When active as part of an underground niovement (as opposed to the classical
. forms of guerrilla warfare) the Dispersed Team has several other advantages.
* For example, if one member of the team gets too "hot" in his area, he automatically
has five other hide-outs to which he can go for assistance or to which he can send
his. family for temporary safety. The Dispersed Team can conveniently cover a
larger area in the fields of recruiting, psychological warfare, and propaganda.
Operations of sabotage, surveillance and harassment of communist persomnel,
‘raids, arid other combat type operations can be successfully conducted while moving
a minimum of people over a minimum distance. : ae
During the present period of deliberate delay the activities of the team will
- naturally be different from some future period in which all out warfare bee or
organization and our country's communist enemies develops.

am If the team is to achieve its ultimate objectives the following activities must
be provided for: (1) organization of and within the team, (2) communications between
the team and higher command, (3) maintaining secrecy of team members, (4) main-
taining a continuous and effective propaganda effort, (5) obtaining the necessary sup-
. plies and equipment for present and future needs, (6) training of the team in general,
and of individual members in their own specialties,
When the required personnel are not available to form a full team, a three
maa‘section should be formed. When additional people are recruited the unit can
then be expanded in an orderly fashion.

BOOBY TRAPS

Bréadly defined a booby trap can be any kind of apparatus
an which a reaction unfavorable to the enemy is brought about
when he unintentionally makes some act which triggers the re-
action. The most common types of booby traps used in warfare
involve an explosive charge which is set off by movement of a
t£ip wire or the moving of some object which is connected to
the trigger mechanism.

On occasion the explosive charge may be replaced by peanuusueeet inuaes
signal flares, gas, smoke pr other chemical agents, The trigger
méchanism may be cither electric, mechanical, thermal or chemical,
: ‘+ ELECTRICALLY OPERATED TRIGGERS. Such trigger mechanisms
- are very easily arranged wherever a supply of electric blasting
caps are available and also a suitable source of electricity.

- One of the most common electric type booby traps is to simply
interrupt the electrical circuit in some building so that when
the lights are turned on the explosive is detonated. This
simple procedure applied to an automobile with a few sticka of

., @ynainite has marked the end of more than one gangland hoodlum.

. to booby trap a car in this manner one side of the electric
blasting cap can be attached to any metal part of the car while
the other side is attached to a spark plug or the "cold side"
of:the ignition switch. In the first case the cap detonates the
dynamite when the. starter-motor is turned over or if attached to
the key switch detonating occurs when the ignition is turned on,

Any movable object can be booby trapped so that when it 7 a

is moved some simple type electrical switch contact is closed
| .to complete a circuit between a dry cell battery and the de=
tonator. A very simple example would be to have one wire tacked
along the edge of a door and the other wire tacked to the frame
and extending out far enough that contdct is made between the
two when the door is opened. A slightly more refined trigger
involves two small springs separated by some thin piece of in-
sulation at one end as shown in Figure No. 1. When pressure
is applied, the springs are held apart aad when the pressure
is released, the springs come together to make electrical cone
tact. This may be placed in a door which is then closed to open
the switch while the explosive is wired into the circuit. When
the door is opened pressure is released and the charge explodes.

This simple trigger can be placed under the leg of a chair,
& wooden box or any other movable object of sufficient weight.
If the chair is moved or the box lifted the release of pressure
. will close the electrical circuit.

A person skilled in the placement of booby traps will not
leave any part of the switch, wires or charge visible, Instead of

oy

_NW 68262 Docld:32989523 Page 1319



;fonnecting the wires to the door itself he will take off the door
frame, place the trigger mechanism at the edge of the door and
hen replace the frame so that the entire mechanism is hidden when
“the. door is closed. .

- By taking off the frame of a window and drilling a hole
put* through the window casing the trigger mechanism can’ be placed
Spo_that the charge will be detonated by either raising or lowering
ia half open window.

A simple time delay mechanism can be arranged by placing
sone.of.these triggers under a glass jar filled with water. When
“*eneagh Of the water evaporates, the weight of the jar will no
longer be sufficient to hold the contacts open.

“Figure No. ‘2 shows another simple electrical trigger made
from a. spring clothes pin. The improvised contacts are held
8part by a smali wooden wedge in the jaws of the clothes pin.
This wedge can be attached to a trip wire ‘or other movable object,

- When it is withdrawn the clothes pin shuts and the electric cir-
cuit is. completed.

A trigger of this type can be used to make a time delay
mechanism in many different ways. The wedge may be connected by~
a loose cord to the end of a spring which is also attached to a
: ~ =» $i can, -Above this a second tin can fuli of sand or water is
| 2... .. placed with a-hole in the bottom. so. that the contents gradually-

~ £all through into the second can. When the weight of the lower
ean becomes enough to stretch the spring sufficiently the wedge
will be pulled from the clothes pin. As an aiternate method the
: spring may be already stretched out and held there by a second
4 ~-cord attached to some other solid object, The cord holding the
spring. could be placed through a candle so that it will be burned
f, in two when the candle burned down a certain distance. An active
imagination can devise countless ways for activating this type
of trigger either by instant action or delayed action.

A clever derivative of this simple trigger is used in the

“British book trap", In this case [a book is hollowed out to

~eontain a small battery and a quarter pound block of TNT which
is detonated by an electrical blasting cap. The circuit passes
through two contacts attached to opposite pages of the book but
are held apart by some insulating material which is attached to
the back of the bookcase. If the book is withdrawn from the case
the contacts come together and the TNT is detonated.]

A British ball bearing contact switch is shown in Figure No,
-3. This type of contact is very useful in placing charges entirely
within a movable object. For example, a suitcase could be laid
On its side with the contact positioned inside in such a way that
when the suitcase was picked up the ball bearing would roll forward
+ and complete the contact. Similar electrically activated booby

oe Tr , o2- ot ;

traps could be pl¥€ed in closed gasoline cans, canteens, ammuni-*
tion boxes or dozens of other objects which an enemy would place
right side up before opening. A plastic or glass test tube

could be used instead of a metal case by sticking two wires through
the cork in such a manner that the ball bearing would come in
contact with both of them.

A surprisingly accurate timing device can be made with a
tube of this type. Holding the tube with the open end up, first
pour in a quantity of dried peas, then a measured amount of
water, drop in the ball bearing (in this case a wad of tin foil
could be used as weil), finally put the cork in the top with the
wire sticking down through. The water will cause the dried peas
to swell which will push the ball bearing (or wad of tin foil)
up until it makes contact with the two wires -to complete the
circuit. The time can be regulated from a few minutes to several
hours depending on the length of the * tube, the amount of water, and
the quantity of peas used,

Far more sophisticated types of electrical triggers are manu-
factured some of which operate by photoelectric cell or even more
@ifficult to recognize mechanisms. These may be used to. safeguard
Yecord centers, important military or missile bases, etc. but are

. seldom encountered under battlefield conditions. i

or by friction. The ordinary hand grenade employs an impact
trigger. When the handle is released a spring operated lever snaps
‘against a cap (similar to the priming cap in a shotgun shell)
-which in turn starts a short fuse to burn, This fuse leads toa
blasting cap centered in an explosive charge.

He Pees MECHANICAL TRIGGERS. These may be operated either by impact”
|
1

The trigger mechanism of a "potato masher" hand -grenade
> ‘operates much like the firing pin of a bolt action rifle. In
i soe this case a spring activated plunger strikes a detonator. The
plunger may be released by pulling out a pin as shown in Figure
"No. 4, by cutting a wire as shown in Figure No. 5 or by applying
.. pressure to a slotted key as shown in Figure No. 6.
Explosion of the primer cap alone is not sufficient to de-~
tonate most military explosives. Generally a booster charge of a
fairly sensitive explosive is detonated by the primer and this in
turn detonates the main charge. In military use INT is by far the
most common explosive used in the main charge of booby traps,
“ So called "plastic explosive" or "Composition C~3" contains 78
: percent RDX and 22% plasticizer made up of mixture of dinitrotolune,
TNT, nitrocellulose and dimethylformamide. RDX is cyclotrimethy~
lenetrinitramine which is manufactured by nitrating hexamethylene-
tetramine (which is obtained by the reaction of formaldehyde and
ammonia).

Booster charges where necessary are usually tetryl or PETN,
Common explosives used in primers are lead azide, lead styphnate

or the now largely discontinued mercury fulminate. Characteris-
tics, uses and manufacture of explosives will be dealt with in
another chapter,

A very simple device can be made from a screen door spring
that will explode an ordinary rifle cartridge when activated by a
trip wire. Although the "explosion" is almost harmless it can be
very nerve- racking to an approaching enemy.

A more deadly booby trap consists of a short piece of pipe a
which is driven into the ground. A plunger type trigger mechanism
is dropped into the pipe and an ordinary rifle cartridge placed
point up in the pipe so that perhaps one-half inch is exposed
above the ground. The weight of a man stepping on the bullet
releases the trigger and fires the cartridge which will penetrate
well up into the leg or the body,

Some mechanical triggers are activated by “friction “just
like striking a match on the rough material of the match cover.

Figure No. 7 shows a cut-away drawing of the U.S. Army firing
‘' . device, pull friction type M-2, The coated wire is covered with

i ’ a gritty substance much like the strip on a book of matches.

. When this is pulled out through a container of flash compound
(chemically similar to the match heads) the friction ignites the
flash compound which may be used either to light .a fuse or fire
8 blasti cap. : : :

: A crude but effective friction device can be prepared by
sticking the end of a fuse in some small cylinder filled with
match heads through which is placed a small strip of tin or heavy
cardboard with a friction strip from match books glued to both
- sides.

In field use the friction type ignitor can be hidden in
. Many ways connected with trip wires or attached to movable objects
to set off either instant or delayed charges. :

THERMAL IGNITORS. In-some cases the ignitor, (fuse or primer) au
can be used as a trigger mechanism. For example in World War II
the Germans were known to tear down fireplaces and cement them -
on back together with hidden charges that would ignite when a fire ¢
was built. A simple hand grenade or mortar shell hidden in a
re 7 hollow log by a burned out fire would, of course, explode if the s
: log were used as fuel without being inspected. E

4 common trick is for a retreating army to leave behind coal
oil lamps or lanterns filled with gasoline. An unthinking person
who touches a match to such a lantern will nearly always be burned
to death. :

Other types of delay mechanisms may be constructed where a
_ quid is allowed to drop through a small hole into a lower con~
tainer having a reactive substance attached part way up one wall,
* The liquid level in the chamber gradually raises until it comes
in contact with the reactive substance which is the igniter. One
suitable combination is sulfuric acid for the liquid and a mixture
of potassium chlorate and sugar for the solid, Another suitable
fou combination is plain water for the liquid and metallic sodium for
i the solid. There are many other combinations which a chemist might
eon ‘ improvise from materials at hand,

‘There, are some explosives so sensitive that they can be used.
as trigger mechanisms. Ammonium tri-iodide can be made from
ordinary household ammonia and iodine crystals. If the iodine _
erystals aré not available they can be obtained by ‘evaporating
sufficient volume of tincture of iodine in a flat glass dish.

i Place two or three teaspoons of iodine crystals in a piece
1 of kleenex and wet thoroughly with strong ammonia solution. A
oe small amount of ammonia may be added from time to ‘time making
certain that it does not have the chance to dry out. After three
_ or four tablespoons of ammonia solution have been absorbed and
partly evaporated from the iodine it can be left to dry out. While
_ wet ammonium tri-iodide is reasonably safe to handle. When dry,
_it is so sensitive that it détonates at the slightest touch. It
may be exploded by a person walking on a wooden floor several feet
away or a door being closed in the ‘same building. The amount
described above will produce a violent explosion and should be
treated with extreme caution. Several similar compounds will be
‘mentioned in the chapter on explosives,

. One or two teaspoonsful of mercury fulminate of silver
fulminate mixed (very gently) with tem percent coarse sand can
be placed in a small packet of paper and attached to the upper
side of an automobile tire with adhesive tape. When the tire rolis
over it the fulminate will explode with sufficient power to destroy
even a husky truck tire. These combinations also are very danger-
ous to handle,

READY MADE BOOBY TRAPS

All national armies are supplied with a variety of ©
manufactured trigger devices, charges, etc. to be used
specifically as booby trap material. Most firing devices
are threaded on one end with a standing size that allows them to
be used either with prepared charges or with improvised charges
made from mortar or artillery shells. Figure No, 9 shows a

- simple firing device attached to a hand grenade.

‘An antipersonnel mine of French manufacture is shown in
Figure No. 10. The apparatus at the left side is a trigger
mechanism that can be operated by a trip wire. When it is fired
the flash passes through the "U" tube which propels a 60mm
+ grenade into the air and at the same time ignites a 1/5 second
delay pellet. The grenade explodes a few feet off the ground
to shower metal fragments over a wide area. Total weight of
mine is 5-1/2 pounds, 7 : ‘
a Guerrilla bands have sometimes used artillery shells or
---mortar shells in demolition work by placing them in a large

fire around them until they exploded. For booby traps use, however,

the projectile of an artillery shell is the only part of any

value. Useful sizes include 75mm, 90mm, 105mm, and 155mm, In _

those artillery shells where the prjectile is attached to the case,
.. it is generally best to remove the projectile and discard the case,

Artillery shell projectiles may be fused eithor in the nose or

in the base. For most efficient use, the regular fuse must be

unscrewed and a standard firing device (M10 Universal destructor)

put in its place. .

IMPROVISED BOOBY TRAPS

Standard hand grenades can be used alone in booby traps
-in a number of methods. -The simplest is to carefully remove’
the handle and wedge the grenade between two heavy objects
strong enough to hold the spring in the cocked position.

Another trick is to cover a hand grenade with wet mud with
just the safety pin ring sticking out. After the mud has hardened,
it will hold the handle in place and the safety pin ring can be
withdrawn. These harmless looking clumps of mud scattered along. —
a dirt road will, of course, break open when hit by an automobile
tire which will release the handle and fire the grenade. A similar.
trick is to place grenades in glass jars tight enough to hold the,
handle in place when the safety pins are withdrawn. At nt cht thee
may be strung on a wire across a road and may not be seen by a

+ car traveling at night with its lights off. When the bottles
break the grenade handles are released and they soon explode.

"5° + USE OF BOOBY TRAPS | citeestatet ierseee fecal

It is obvious that the use of hooby traps favors an army in
retreat, and one of their greatest uses is to slow down pursuit,
H For most efficient use the laying of booby traps must be done in
‘a planned and coordinated method. When time permits the entire -
area to be booby trapped should be reconnoitered and the placement
of available material planned in such a way as to confuse the enemy,
impede his progress and cause. maximum number of casualties.

Generally speaking a large number of small booby traps are
peanu preferred to a few large ones. ‘Two or more triggers may be

f attached to a single charge. Variety of types and settings is
essential to effective use of booby traps in iarge numbers,

vo In the event that friendly troops or your own personnel

may re-enter such an area later on, it is desirable that a written
. record and detailed maps be kept as to where boopy traps are
placed. When U.S, Army troops discover a place that is booby
trapped they mark it with a sign which consasts of a red triangle

“booby traps painted in white across the top.

When anti-vehicle mines are placed by regular army forces
it is common practice to booby trap the mines so they will ex-
plode when being foneyed by personnel attempting to clear the

area, : : seaeeee

‘The use of booby traps is very adaptable to bech guerrilla
and counter-guerrilla activity. Guerrilla warfare involves two
basic types of action: ambushes and raids. When the guerrillas
ambush regular army forces, they are the ones that will make use
of the booby traps. In raiding an enemy garrison or supply depot
they must beware of booby traps that the regular forces have

‘ placed to protect their fixed positions. .

The ambush may start when the leading vehicle of an enemy
column ‘strikes a mine or drives on to a bridge which is dynamited.
Perhaps time delay booby traps activated by the first vehicle in
the column may be used to destroy other vehicles several positions
behind. Troops riding in a truck convoy may be expected to seek
cover in ditches beside the road or other points of natural pro-
tection. If these ditches have been booby trapped beforehand, they

+ will be killed in the very process of seeking shelter.

Before making any raid on a fixed enemy “position, guerrilla

“forces should carefully consider the potential danger of booby
traps. When regular army forces are being harrassed by guerrillas
they may be expected to leave supplies badly. needed by the guerrillas
in slightly protected warehouses as traps. These supplies may be
heavily booby trapped and counter guerrilla forces may be waiting
a short distance away to take pursuit. To guard against these
things, the guerrilla should attempt to keep their target under
surveillance for several hours or days before making the raid.
They should observe the coming and going of enemy pérsonnel, If
the enemy is very careful to always come and go by the same route
it may mean that other routes are booby trapped, If the supplies
are not added to or taken from regularly; this may indicate that
they are being used to bait a-trap. By scouting the general area
guerrilla forces shou ld guard against surprise by other enemy
forces waiting within danger distance.

After making either a raid or an ambush, guerrilla forces
should place booby traps behind them to slow up pursuit. Real
booby traps can be interspersed with imitation traps. To be
safe the enemy will have to go around or de-activate the imitations
and take just as much time doing so as if they were real, If the
enemy becomes careless in handling your imitation traps, he will

“run the danger of getting killed by a live one. In. planning the
path of their retreat guerrilla forces should booby trap alternate
. routes which enemy forces might use to cut them off,

SECRET AARIV ORGANIZATION

UNDE: REROUND BOUETIN :

GENERAL HEADQUARTERS —— JANUARY 1972

"God grants liberty only to those who love it and are always willing to guard and
defend it", Daniel Webster

Fellow members,

This month's bulletin will deal mostly with "Booby Traps". Because of the
length of this article we are only sending out the first half this month. The second
half will be published in next month's bulletin. Future bulletins this coming year
will contain material on psychological warfare, urban warfare tactics, communi-
cations, survival equipment, first aid, explosives, weapons, codes, and‘other re-
lated warfare subjects.

. Those members who have not yet completed or started on the organization's
basic training programs are hereby urged to do so. We cannct, in most cases,
assign any member to an impovtant underground project or to an organized team
or group until they have completed this training program.

While headquarters cannot assign a member in the above classification to
an established unit, any member can (and is encouraged to) recruit and form their
own combat team (see December 1971 Bulletin), In many cases this may be the 1
best policy in regards to personal security as the member would be working with c
the people he personally knows and trusts. If any member would like to form their j
own unit they should write to their assigned mail drop and the organization will send
them further instructions along with a Team Recruiting Packet. The article on H
"The Dispersed Team" in this month's bulletin should help those members who
wish to form their own Combat Team.

° : We are enclosing a small number of S. A.O. stickers with this month's
bulletin, Please put them in your shirt pocket or billfold and as soon as possible
stick, them up in phone booths, at bus stops, or cther public places that you visit.
The stickers are already gummed and when wet wili adhere firmly to glass, metal, © i
or any other sraooth surface. If our members would use these stickers along with
the leaflets that are available, it would have a real psychological impact on the
rest of the American people and give them evidence that there are stil] those among
them who are willing to fight for the re-establishment of a Constitutional Republic.
These first stickers are being sent to cach member free, additional stickers and
leaflets can be ordered on the monthly reg form. ASEH

i @. DISPERSED’ TEAM

When discussing a Secret Army Organization "Combat Team", we usually think
of a small group of people who live very close to one another. Such an arrangement.
has certain advantages, such as ease of communication and travel for collective
training and team operations, but there are also several disadvantages,

Among the disadvantages are these: Team members may be well acquainted
with only a small geographical area. If forced to leave this area the team may be
placed at a serious disadvantage. It is harder for a team of SAO members who
live closely together to keep from attracting attention, thus unit security may be
poor. If one rember of the team is ever discovered and arrested by the enemy,
chances are that all members of the team will be rounded up together,

These considerations have caused us to experiment with a new arrangement that
we refer to as a "Dispersed Team". Such a team has the same number of members
(usually six) as a regular Combat Team. Each team is split into two sections as is
the old team. The members have the same type of individual specialties and duties.

The big difference lies in the fact that the team members may be located over
a comparatively larger area - perhaps as much as 25 to 50 miles in diameter. In
urban areas one team-member may live in each of six different cities. Thus the
team may range over a fairly large geographical area with at least one team member
being familiar with the immediate territory through which they are traveling. ___

When active as part of an underground movement (as opposed to the classical
forms of guerrilla warfare) the Dispersed Team has several other advantages.
For example, if one member of the team gets too "hot" in his area, he automatically
has five other hide-outs to which he can go for assistance or to which he can send
his family for temporary safety. The Dispersed Team can conveniently cover a
larger area in the fields of recruiting, psychological warfare, and propaganda.
Operations of sabolage, surveillance and harassment of communist personnel,
raids, and other combat type operations can be successfully conducted while moving
a minimum of people over a minimum distance.

During the present period of deliberate delay the activities of the team will
naturally be different from some future period in which all out warfare between our
organization and our country's communist enemies develops.

If the team is to achieve its ultimate objectives the following activities must
be provided for: (1) organization of and within the team, (2) communications between
the team and higher command, (3) maintaining secrecy of team members, (4) main-
taining a continuous and effective propaganda effort, (5) obtaining the necessary sup-
plies and equipment for present and future needs, (6) training of the team in general,
and of individual members in their own specialties.

When the required personnel are not available to form a full team, a three
maa‘section should be formed. When additional people are recruited the uait can
then be expanded in an orderly fashion.

BOOBY TRAPS

Broadly defined a booby trap can be any kind of apparatus
4n which a reaction unfavorable to the enemy is brought about
when he unintentionally makes some act which triggers the re~
action, The most common types of booby traps used in warfare
involve an explosive cherge which is set off by movement of a
trip wire or the moving of some object which is connected to
the trigger mechanism,

On occasion the explosive charge may be replaced by
eignsl flares, gas, smoke or other chemical agents, The trigger
mechanism may be either electric, mechanical, thermal or chemical.

ELECTRICALLY OPERATED TRIGGERS, Such trigger mechanisms
are very easily arranged wherever a supply of electric blasting
.caps are available and also a suitable source of electricity.
One of the most common electric type booby traps is to simply
interrupt the electrical circuit in some building so that when
the lights are turned on the explosive is detonated. This
simple procedure applied to an automobile with a few sticks of
dynamite has marked the end of more than one gangland hoodlum.
To booby trap a car in this manner one side of the electric
blasting cap can be attached to any metal parc of the car while
the other side is attached to a spark plug or the "cold side"

_ Of the ignition switch. In the first case the cap. detonates the-.-- -- s+) is. 2.4
“dynamite when the starter motor is turned over or if attached to
the key’ switch detonating occurs when the ignition is turned on,

Any movable object can be booby trapped so that when it . =
is moved some simple type electrical switch contact is closed 7 “3
to complete a circuit between a dry cell battery and the deo
tonator, A very simple example would be to have one wire tacked
along the edge of a door and the other wire tacked to the frame
and extending out far enough that contact is made between the
two when the door is opened. A slightly more refined trigger
involves two small springs separated by some thin plece of ine
suletion at one end as shown in Figure No. 1. When pressure -
is applied, the springs are held apart and when the pressure
is released, the springs come together to wake electrical cone
tact. This may be placed in a dooy which is then closed to open
the switch while the explosive is wired into the circuit. When
we the door is opened pressure is released and the charge explodes.

This simple trigger can be placed under the leg of a chair,
a wooden box or any other movable object of aufficient weight.
If the chair is moved or the box lifted the release of pressure
. will close the electrical circuit.

A person skilled in the placement of booby trape will not
leave any part of the switch, wires or charge visible. Instead of

wl

NW 68262 Docld:32989523 Page 1331 :



connecting the wires to the door itself he will take off the door
- frame, place the trigger mechanism at the edge of the door and

then replace the frame so that the entire mechanism is hidden whea :
the, door is closed.

By taking off the frame of a window and drilling a hole
out through the window casing the trigger mechanism can’ be placed
so that the charge will be iia by either raising or biting
a half open Mosel

A sinple time delay mechanism can be arranged by placing
one of these triggers under a glass jar filled with water. When
enough of the water evaporates, the weight of the jar will no s
longer be sufficient to hold the contacts open.

Figure No. ‘2 shows another simple electrical trigger made
from a-spring clothes pin. The improvised contacts are held
-apart by a small wooden wedge in the jaws of the clothes pin.

This wedge can be attached to a trip wire or other movable object.
When it is withdrawn the clothes pin shuts and the electric cir-
cuit is: completed.

A trigger of this type can be used to make a time delay
mechanism in many different ways. The wedge may be connected by
a loose cord to the end of a spring which is aiso attached to a
tin can, Above this a second tin can full of sand or water is
placed with a hole.in the: bottom .so that’ the contents-graduakly- -- | -—--- o-oo
fall through into the second can. When the weight of the lower
ean becomes enough to stretch the spring sufficiently the wedge
will be pulled from the clothes pin. As an alternate method the
spring may be already stretched out and held there by a second
| ‘cord attached to some other solid object. The cord holding the
| spring could be placed through a candle so that it will be burned
in two when the candle burned down a certain distance. An active
‘imagination can devise countless ways for activating this type
of trigger either by instant action or delayed action.

A clever derivative of this simple trigger is used in the
| "British book trap", In this case a book is hollowed out to
contain a small battery and a quarter pound block of TNT which
" is detonated by an electrical blasting cap. The circuit passes
through two contacts attached to opposite pages of the book but
are held apart by some insulating material which is attached to
- the back of the bookcase, If the book is withdrawn from the case
the contacts come together and the TNT is detonated.

“A British ball bearing contact switch is shown in Figure No.
+3, This type of contact is very useful in placing charges entirely
within a movable object. For example, a suitcase could be laid
on its side with the contact positioned inside in such a way that
when the suitcase was picked up the ball bearing would roll forward
+ and complete the contact. Similar electrically activated booby

traps could be placed in closed gasoline cans, canteens, ammuni-~
tion boxes or. dozens of other objects which an enemy would place
right side up before opening. A plastic or glass test tube

could be used instead of a metal case by sticking two wires through
the cork in such a manner that the ball bearing would come in
contact with both of them.

A surprisingly accurate timing device can be made with a’
tubé of this type. Holding the tube with the open end up, first
pour in a quantity of dried peas, then a measured amount of
water, drop in the ball bearing (in this case a wad of tin foil
could be used as weil), finally put the cork in the top with the
wire sticking down through. The water will cause the dried peas
to swell which will push the ball bearing (or wad of tin foil)
up until it makes contact with the two wires to complete the
circuit. The time can be regulated from a few minutes to several
hours depending on the length of the tube, the amount of water, and
the quantity of peas used.

Far more sophisticated types of electrical triggers are manu-
factured some of which operate by photoelectric cell or even more
difficult to recognize mechanisms, These may be used to safeguard
record centers, important military or missile bases, etc. but are
seldom encountered under battlefield conditions,

MECHANICAL TRIGGERS. These may ‘be operated either by impact
or by friction. The ordinary hand grenade employs an impact
trigger. When the handie is released a spring operated lever snaps
against a cap (similar to the priming cap in a shotgun shell}
which in turn starts a short fuse to burn. This fuse leads to a
blasting cap centered in an explosive charge.

The trigger mechanism of a "potato masher" hand grenade
operates much like the firing pin of a bolt action rifle. In
this case a spring activated plunger strikes a detonator. The
plunger may be released by pulling out a pin as shown in Figure
No. 4, by cutting a wire as shown in Figure No. 5 or by applying

_pressure to a slotted key as shown in Figure No, 6.

Explosion of the primer cap alone is not sufficient. ta dew.
tonate most military explosives. Generally a booster charge ofta~
fairly sensitive explosive is detonated by the primer and this in
turn detonates the main charge. In military use TINT is by far the
most common explosive used in the main charge of booby traps.
So called "plastic explosive" or "Composition C-3" contains 78°
percent RDX and 22% plasticizer made up of mixture of dinitrotolune,
TNT, nitrocellulose and dimethylformamide. RDX is cyclotrimethy~
lenetrinitramine which is manufactured by nitrating hexamethylene.
tetramine (which is obtained by the reaction of formaldehyde * “and
ammonia).

Booster charges where necessary are usually tetryl or PETN,
Common explosives used in primers are lead azide, lead styphnate

73. °



or the now largely discontinued mercury fulminate. Characteris-
tics, uses and manufacture of explosives will be peste with in
another chapter,

A very simple device can be made from a screen door spring
that will explode an ordinary rifle cartridge when activated by a
trip wire. Although the "explosion" is almost harmless it can be
very nerve racking to an approaching enemy.

A more deadly booby trap consists of a short piece of pipe
which is driven into the ground. A plunger type trigger mechaaism
is dropped into the pipe and an ordinary rifle cartridge placed
point up in the pipe so that perhaps one-half. inch is exposed
above the ground, The weight of a man stepping on the bullet
releases the trigger and fires the cartridge which will penetrate -.
well up into the leg or the body.

Some mechanical triggers are activated by friction just
like striking a match on the rough material of the match cover.
Figure No. 7 shows a cut-away drawing of the U.S. Army firing
device, pull friction type M-2. The coated wire is covered with
7 a gritty substance much like the strip on a book of matches.

7 When this is pulled out through a container of flash compound
(chemically similar to the match heads) the friction ignites the
flash compound which may be used either to light a fuse ox fire

. a blasting cap. anne . 7 7 ReEDonaeD

. - A crude but effective friction device can be prepared: by
sticking the end of a fuse in some small cylinder filled with
match heads through which is placed a small strip of tin or heavy
cardboard with a friction strip from match books glued to both
sides.

In field use the friction type ignitor can be hidden in
many ways connected with trip wires or attached to movable objects
to set off either instant or delayed charges,

THERMAL IGNITORS. In some cases the ignitor, (fuse or primer) “*

can be used as a trigger mechanism, For example in World War_LT.
the Germans were known to tear down fireplaces and cement thom
back together with hidden charges that would ignite when a fire.
was built. A simple hand grenade or mortar shell hidden in a Hf

aaa : hollow log by 2 burned out fire would, of course, explode if the
log were used as fuel without being inspected.

A common trick is for a retreating army to leave behind coal
oil lamps or lanterns filled with gasoline. An unthinking person
who touches a match to such a lantern will nearly always be burned
to death. : .

CREMICAL TRIGGERS, These are more frequently used in the
construction of time bombs than in booby traps. Figure No. 8

whe.

NW 68262 Docld:32989523 Page 1334



shows an Italian chemical delay igniter, The upper chamber
contains acetone. When the piercing pin is pushed downward it
penetrates the lead disc and allows the acetone to flow into the
lower chamber, The acetone gradually dissolves the celluloid
washer which holds back the striker. The time delay can be varied
by placing different numbers of cellophane washers on the striker
rod, :

wee . In several similar types of delayed mechanisms the striker
is held back by a thin metal wire which is gradually dissolved
when a solution of acid is allowed to surround it.

Other types of delay mechanisms may be constructed where a
liquid is allowed to drop through a small hole into a lower con-
tainer having a reactive substance attached part way up one wall.
The liquid level in the chamber gradually raises until it comes
in contact with the reactive substance which is the igniter. One
suitable combination is sulfuric acid for the liquid and a mixture
of potassium chlorate and sugar for the solid, Another suitable
combination is plain water for the liquid and metallic sodium for
the solid. There are many other combinations which a chemist might
improvise from materials at hand.

There, are some explosives so sensitive that they can be used
as trigger mechanisms, Ammonium tri-iodide can be made from
ordinary household ammonia and iodine crystals. If the iodine
crystals are not available they can be obtained by evaporating ny
sufficient volume of tincture of iodine in a flat glass dish.

Place two or three teaspoons of iodine crystals in a piece
of kleetex and wet thoroughly with strong ammonia solution, A
small amount of ammonia may be added from time to time making
certain that it does not have the chance to dry out. After three
or four tablespoons of ammonia solution have been absorbed and
partly evaporated from the iodine it can be left to dry out. While
wet ammonium tri-iodide is reasonably safe to handle. When dry,
it is so sensitive that it detonates at the slightest touch. It
may be exploded by a person walking on a wooden fioor several feet
away or a dcor being closed in the same building. The amount
described above will produce a violent explosion and should be
treated with extreme caution. Several similar compounds will be
“mentioned in the chapter on explosives.

. One or two teaspoonsful of mercury fulminate of silver
fulminate mixed (very gently) with ten percent coarse sand can
be placed in a small packet of paper and attached to the upper
side of an automobile tire with adhesive tape. When the tire rolls
over it the fulminate will explode with sufficient power to destroy
even a husky truck tire, These combinations also are very danger-
ous to handle.

READY MADE BOOBY TRAPS : |

All national armies are supplied with a variety of
manufactured trigger devices, charges, etc. to be used
specifically as booby trap material. Most firing devices
are threaded on one end with a standing size that allows them to -
be used either with prepared charges or with improvised charges :
made from mortar or artillery shells. Figure No. 9 shows a
simple firing device attached to a hand grenade.

An antipersonnel mine of French manufacture is shown in 40°
Figure No, 10. The apparatus at the left side is a trigger
mechanism that can be operated by a trip wire. When it is fired
the flash passes through the "U" tube which propels a 60mm
grenade into the air and at the same time ignites a 1/5 second
delay pellet, The grenade explodes a few feet off the ground
to shower metal fragments over a wide area, Total weight of
mine is 5-1/2 pounds. :

age

c= 7 7 Guerrilla bands have sometimes used artillery shells or
mortar shells in demolition work by placing them in a large
pile of wood or other combustible material and building a bond
fire around them until they exploded. For booby traps use, however,
the projectile of an artillery shell is the only part of any
value, Useful sizes include 75mm, 90mm, 105mm, and 155mm. In
those artillery shells where the prjectile is attached to the case,
it is generally best to remove the projectile and discard the case,
Artillery shell projectiles may be fused either in the nose or
in the base. For most efficient use, the regular fuse must be
unscrewed and a standard firing device (M10 Universal destructor)
put in its place.

IMPROVISED BOOBY TRAPS

Standard hand grenades can be used alone in booby traps
in a number of methods. The simplest is to carefully remove
the handle and wedge the grenade between two heavy objects
strong enough to hold the spring in the cocked position.

Another trick is to cover a hand grenade with wet mud with |

just the safety pin ring sticking out. After the mud has hardened,
can it will hold the handle in place and the safety pin ring can be

withdrawn. These harmless looking clumps of mud scattered along

a dirt road will, of course, break open when hit by an automobile

tire which will release the handle and fire the grenade, A similar

trick is to place grenades in glass jars tight enough to hold the

handle in place when the safety pins are withdrawn, At night these

may bé strung on a wire across a road and may not be seen by a

ear traveling at night with its lights off. When the bottles

break the grenade handles are released and they soon explode.

It seems doubtful that man's ingenuity will ever be
exhausted when it comes to improvising traps of various types,
A rusty nail stuck to a board left where it will be stepped
on by a rurining enemy may be just as deadly to that one indivi-
dual as an atomic bomb. Open pits (sometimes with sharp stakes
at the bottom) covered with flimsy camouflage is much older than
the bow and arrow, but were still used by the Japanese’ in World
War it.

"Dead falls" made from heavy tree limbs that fall when a
victim releases them by tripping over a jungle vine can still
be useful in guerrilla warfare,

Leaving behind poisoned food or bottled drinks is common,
Alcoholic dzinks are easily diluted with wood alcohol (temporary
type antifreeze)’ equal to 1/4 their content of ethyl alcohol
without detection. A total intake of 2 or 3 ounces will cause
blindness or death in a few hcurs. Soft drinks can be easily
poisoned with ethylene glycol (permanent type antifreeze) at
the rate of 2 ounces per bottle. This dose is usually fatal

“and once symptoms develop there #s no known antidote.

z “ When five parts of potassium permanganate is mixed with
one part of powdered sugar it forms a combination that will
either explode (if confined) or burn with a flash if ignited in
the open, A new idea might be to put three or four tablespoonsful
_of this material in an ash tray covered with a thin dust of cig-
‘arette ashes. The first person to put his cigarette out in that
“particular ash tray would be burned bad enough to be out of
commission for quite some time. Black powder, if available, would
actuaily explode if used in this way.

USE OF BOOBY TRAPS

It is obvious that the use of hooby traps favors an army in
retreat, and one of their greatest uses is to slow down Pursuit.
-For most efficient use the laying of booby traps must be done in
a planned and coordinated method. When time permits the entire
area to be booby trapped should be reconnoitered and the placement
of available meterial planned in such a way as to confuse the enemy,
impede his progress and cause maximum number of casualties,

Generally speaking a large number of small booby traps are
preferred to a few large ones. Two or more triggers may be
avtached to a single charge. Variety of types and settings is
“essential to effective use of booby traps in large numbers.

In the event that friendly troops or your own personnel
may re-enter such an area later on, it is desirable that a written
record and detailed maps be kept as to where boopy traps are
placed, When U.S, Army troops discover a place that is booby
trapped they mark it wath a sign which consists of a red triangle

oJ

i
F



pointed downward with a white circle in the middle and the word

booby traps painted in white across the top.

When anti-vehicle mines are placed by regular army forces
it is common practice to booby trap the mines so they will ex-
plode when being removed by personnel attempting to cléar the
area,

The use of booby traps is very adaptable to bech guerrilla
and counter-guerrilla activity, Guerrilla warfare involves two
basic types of action: ambushes and raids. When the guerrillas
ambush regular army forces, they are the ones that will make use
of the booby traps. In raiding an enemy garrison or supply depot
they must beware of booby traps that the regular forces have
placed to protect their fixed positions,

“The ambush may start when the leading vehicle of an enemy
column strikes a mine or drives on to a bridge which is dynamited.

‘Perhaps time delay booby traps activated by the first vehicle in

the column may be used to destroy other vehicles several positions
behind.. Troops riding in a truck convoy may be expected to seek .
cover in ditches beside the road or other points of natural pro-
tection. If these ditches have been booby trapped beforehand, they
will be killed in the very process of seeking shelter.

Before making any raid on a fixed: enemy position, guerrilla
forces should carefully consider the potential danger of booby
traps. When regular army forces are being harrassed by guerrillas
they may be expected to leave supplies badly needed by the guerrillas
in slightly protected warehouses as traps. These supplies may be
heavily booby trapped and counter guerrilla forces may be waiting
a short distance away to take pursuit. To guard against these
things, the guerrilla should attempt to keep their target under
surveillance for several hours or days before making the raid.
They should observe the coming and going of enemy personnel. If
the enemy is very careful to always come and go by the same route
it may mean that other routes are booby trapped, If the supplies
are not added to or taken from regularly, this may indicate that
they are being used to bait a trap. By scouting the general area
guerrilla forces shou ld guard against surprise by other enemy
forces waiting within danger distance.

After making either a raid or an ambush, guerrilla forces
should place booby traps behind them to slow up pursuit, Real
booby traps can be interspersed with imitation traps. To be
safe the enemy will have to go around or de-activate the imitations
and take just as much time doing so as if they were real, If the
enemy becomes carelcss in handling your imitation traps, he will
run the danger of getting killed by a live one. In planning the
path of their retreat guerrilla forces should booby trap alternate
routes which enemy forces might use to cut them off,

DAVIS was highly interested in forming a new Right Wing
group to organize people in various localities and to°

due to oppression or communist influence.

(SD T-1, May 5, 1971)

- On January 7, 1972, it was reported that the SAO
‘intended to conduct intelligence-type operations and to
‘offer training in urban guerrilla warfare to be used against
Geft Wing groups and suspected enemies of the United States.

| A leaflet entitled, "Join the Secret Army
j Organization" was made available which offered the srepniblis
statements of purpose:

"1) To prepare the means of personal defense
and survival in case of enemy attack.

2) To resist and expose the spread of communist
influence and propaganda within our own Sienna
boundaries.

3) To investigate by means of our own secret
memberships the infiltration of communist sympathizers
into American organizations of government, business,

- labor, religion and education.

4) fo resist by any and.all means the passage of
laws which regulate the private ownership of
firearms or which detract from the individual's
ability to defend his own family and personal
property.

5)" To promote knowledge and skill in the use of
arms by our own members and by the general
public. 7

6) To form in advance of actual need a secret
underground organization equipped to spy upon,
harrass and destroy troops of any fordgn power
that might occupy United States territory.

_’possible to other resistance organizations, domestic
or foreign, opposing communist expansion or
subversion.

8) -To pursue these programs as private citizens
motivated only by patriotism and to remain entirely
free of government subsidies or control."

(SD T-2, January 7, 1972)

D. Officers

On January 7, 1972, it was reported that, if the
organization continues to progress as originally envisioned,
it will eventually be operated by a General Staff. This
General Staff will be composed of JERRY LYNN DAVIS, 2393
Washington, Spring Valley, California, with the title of

- "Commander," and the leaders of various area: groups who will.

E. Summary of Overall Activities

On May 5, 1971, it was reported that JERRY LYNN

DAVIS was continually talking about the plans he was making
to start a new organization. According to DAVIS, he
considered the MM organization to be defunct, at least
in the San Diego area and in most of the Western’ states,
and felt the need to organize a new Right Wing group to

~ £111 the power vacuum which it had left. He indicated that
he knew people in Phoenix, Arizona; Portland, Oregon; Seattle,
Washington, and Las Vegas, Nevada, who he wanted to eontat
regarding such an organization, feeling that they would be
highly interested in helping to organize and get it going.
He said his plans ‘included having Post Office boxes rented
for the new organization in all these cities and having
leaflets and stickers regarding the organization printed
using the respective Post Office box numbers. On a pre-determined
day, press releases would be made in each of these cities
announcing the formation of the organization with the leaflets
and stickers being put up in the cities on the-same day.
This would be done for the purpose of disguising the location
of the national headquarters, which would be actually located
in San Diego, California.

(sD T-1, May 5, 1971)

On September 13 1971, it was ‘reported that DAVIS
had become very interested in the National Socialist White
Peoples Party (NSWPP) as a possible answer to the need for a

-6-

NW 68262 Docld:32989523 Page 1355



SD 157-2815

Right Wing group in the San Diego area. He was reportedly
; studying that organization and considering becoming a -
.memper,. 5

oa . : . (8D 2-2, September 13, 1971)

& Phot

The National Socialist White Peoples Party, —
also known as The American Nazi Party, $a
American Nazis, and The George Lincoln
Rockwell Party, was organized on February 26,
1956, at Arlington, Virginia, based upon
the concept of an international "National Socialist"
movement as espoused by the German Nazi Party

7 headed by Adolf Hitler. The organization supports

: and follows the line of hatred against Negroes,
Jews, and communists through various propaganda
media seeking a legitimate dominant political
party in the United States and foreign countries.

7 in RS~ :
fot On September i: 1971, it was reported that,
while very interested in the NSWPP, DAVIS was still considering
going ahead with plans for the new orgenization. In addition,
DAVIS indicated that he expected to obtain membership lists
and the necesary materials for setting up application forms,
bulletins and training literature for the new organization : i
i * from BETLTE HAUGHTON, wife of TROY-HAUGHTON., DAVIS said }
- ..~° he would attempt to have the billetins, training materials,
INVA and membership application forms printed in the near future
and that, tentatively, the responsibility for making the
monthly mail-outs would alternate between DAVIS and GODFREY.
DAVIS advised that 0.,.A,<ALEXANDER of Alex Rapid Print, 7609 i
El Cajon Boulevard, La Mesa, California, had agreed to print
some of these materials. ALEXANDER was described as a former
MM supporter who had allowed TROY HAUGHTON to use his printing
facilities for the benefit of the West Coast MM organization.

; Other plans for the new organization included
eventually setting up two membership lists which would be
recorded on microfilm. One of the lists would be maintained
by DAVIS and the other by GODFREY. The purpose in placing

“Jo.

NW 68262 Docld:32989523 Page 1356



SD 157-2815

the membership lists on microfilm was for easy destruction. FH
Two lists were to be maintained to guard against the
possibility of one being lost or destroyed.

Ye

: On October 8, 1971, it was reported that DAVIS had
chosen the name "Secret Aruy Organization" for his new group.
In addition, it was learned DAVIS had had 1,000 copies each
of letterhead stationery and membership application forms
for the SAO printed up the previous weekend. DAVIS also
advised that he, GODFREY, and other associates would attend
the. Annual Yuma Gun Show at Yuma, Arizona, on October 16 and
October 17, 1971, at which time he expected contact would be
made with people attending the gun show from Phoenix,
Arizona, and Seattle, Washington, regarding the SAO.

(SD T-1,- October 8, 1971)

On October 16, and October 17, 1971, DAVIS, GODFREY,
and STANLEY DON MC DADE, a prospective member of the SAO residing:
at 4114 Massachusetts, La Mesa, California, were in attendance
at_the Yuma Gun Show. Following the gun show, a meeting was
held in a motel room at Yuma, Arizona, with persons in

| attendance, including the above three individuals and EVERETT
MOORE and his wife from Phoenix, Arizona, and CY ANDERSON

\ from Seattle, Washington, The topic of discussion was the SAO
and those attending the meeting were in general agreement
that a new cohesive force was. necessary among Right Wing
groups as a result of the power vacuum left by the disintegration
of the MM organization. MOORE and ANDERSON tentatively agreed
to having their respective groups join the SAO subject to the
approval of the members of these groups. Copies of printed
material of the SAO, including a leaflet entitled, "History

ee of the Secret Army Organization," a copy of the first bulletin

sae of the SAO entitled, "To Prospective Members of the Secret

Army Organization," and membership application forms were passed

around among the group.

It was decided that subsequent contacts regarding
expansion of the SAO would be made and that the San Diego area

* "En route to the gun show, CY ANDERSON's automobile
had broken down some place in the dtate of Nevada and it had
been necessary for him to hire transportation from there to
the gun show. After the gun show, DAVIS drove to Las Vegas,
Nevada, accompanied by ANDERSON, to make contact with people

known to him regarding the SAO.

ae It was reported that DAVIS, who is part American

Indian, had abandoned the idea of joining the NSWPP when he

learned in late September, 1971, that the NSWPP is adamantly

opposed to persons having American Indian blood, considering
them to be of an inferior race. It was felt that this fact
was responsible for DAVIS' decision to finally go ahead

and organize the SAO, 7 :

SCEEEEt It was also reported that, in addition to the

Dear Fellow American,

At the request of a mutual friend we are sending you this invitation to
join the Secret Army Organization. Those of us who have been members for
some time sincerely believe that our organization can be of real value in pre~
serving for future generations the land of freedom and opportunity which our.
forefathers handed down to us. :

ft is the belief of our organization that the communist-sogialist con-
spiracy has infiltrated the United States Government to such an extent that the
- American people-cannot rely on this country's elected leaders to protect them
frora communist domination and slavery.

We believe that the time will come when the American people will have
to fight for their lives and their liberty. In this belief, we have formed in
advance a secret underground army with but one objective, to defend our con-
stitutional republic and to help our fellow Americans to do the same.

We do no want lukewarm members. We are an organization of people
willing ta make any sacrifice necessary for our country. If you feel the same
way, We invite you to join us. : -

: ti story ofBhe Secret ‘Avay Orga i Wtion ‘

One early morning in February, 1970, a group of six Minutemen leaders from
four states mot sceretly in Northern Arizona to diseuss the crisis that the arrest and
imprisonment of two top M:nutemen leaders and the assassination of a third had
brought on.the organization. Although some of these men had met before in their roles

_ 48 Minutemen group leaders, others were meeting for the first time.

After much discussion, two principal points were agreed upon. First, that the
Minutemen as a national coordination organi: on of militant right-wing groups had
effectively been destroyed by the pro-communist elements inside the Justice Depar
ment, While individual units still existed throughout the country, few had the financial
support or leadership to be really effective. Second, that the need for such a coor
nating organization wasgreater than ever in view of the increascd revolutionary activity
by communists in the United States,

With these éwo pointS in mind, suggestions were put forward on a course of
action to be followed. After ameeting that lasted all that day and fay into the next
morning, an overall pian of action was finally agreed upon. All present agreed to
merge their individual units together and form 2 new organization under the command
of one leader elected from among themselves, with the other five to be members of a
General Staff that would advise and assist the new leadev.

While retaining the basic programs and policies of the Minutemen, it was
decided that not only should this new organization have a different name, but also a
compleicly new chain of command and erganizational structure, If the new organiza
tion was going to survive the attacks that befell the old one, a whole new approach
would be needed. Never again could the arrest or death of a few leaders b he alowed to
eripple the cntire organization,

* For this reason it was decided that only a highly disciplined military type
orgainization with a definite chain ofcommand would have any chance of success. This
then, was the beginning of the Secret Army Organization. Beginning with an ‘original
force of hard core patriots that numbered fewer than two hundred, the Seeret Array
Organization began thejob of picking up the pieces and continuing to fight for national

nd individual freedom. Using this cadre of dedicated personnel as a nucleus, the
8.A.O, bas been recruiting and training new members in the skills they will need as
_ the freedom fighters of tomorrow,

The leaders of theS. A. O. have no idea of fighting a last ditch stand. We have
no desire fo comimit Suicide oursclves or to let our members do so. We have a
- strategy which we believe will ulfimately lead to victory. Only one thing is essential.
We must start preparing and training NOW! We of the S. A. O. believe that our country
is worthy of any sacrifice, If you feel the same way, we invite you to join us.

ective Members Of The a)

SECRET ARMY ORGANIZATION” © ae

The Secret Army Organization is the most active, most completely dedicated and
most selective in ils membership of all the many patriotic organizations in America.
We are willing to make any sacrifice for our country and we fully expect that some of
us will have to make the ultimate sacrifice before victory is achieved. Our very lives
depend on each other. There is no place in this organization for bunglers, playboys or
lukewarm conservatives, If you join thé Secret Army Organization, there might easily
come a time that your life would depend on how competently some other member had
learned his job. .

Unless you are especially well informed on the domestic and world political
situation, itis probable that you have a lot to learn about the present threat our nation
faces. Unless you have had many years experience in actual underground warfare,
there is undoubtedly a lot you can learn from the experts in our organization who have
developed and supervised our training program.

OUR NATION IS IN IMMEDIATE DANGER

Itis possible that within a very few years, perhaps even within months, our
nation could be conquered and enslaved by the communists. To prevent this we must
Imow as much as possibie about our enemies. Unless we know who they are aad what
they ave doing we will not succeed in our efforts to maintain a free America.

THE RESISTANCE MOVEMENT

In driving an invader from your land the resistance involved goes through three
stages of development.

1) The Underground Network
2) Active Guerrilla Warfare
8) Open or Conventional Warfare

The conventional warfare stage uses everything in the way of weapons that the
enemy does but must also have active guerrillas andunderground agenis working against
the enemy, too. Inthe present stale of military tactics conventional warfare cannot
succeed unless these other two ingredients are used simultaneously.

The firs st step is to form an underground network. An active guerrillasystem
must have the support of an underground network of approximately three times its own
size. This underground must supply the active guerrilla fighter with supplies, con-
cealment, information, ele. Anunderground network staris with cee ea of
intelligence, security and propaganda in that order. ‘

Sabotage, espionage, subversion, infiltration, escape and evasion, training,
clande ‘ion of supplies, vounterfeiling cnemy documents, recruiting, com-
munications and propaganda are other phases of underground activity. Each member
of the Si ol Army Organization, to be effective, must have a working knowledge of
se lactics as well as tho military tuclies mere commonly associated with guerril-

ASSIGNMENT ‘TO UNITS

Many people that inquire about membership in the Secret Meiiie Organization
seem to h an idea that they will be immodi:tely accepted inio an active unit.
Look at it this way. : Suppose you had spent a year or more carefully recruiting and
training until you had a hard hitting team where every individual was reliable, dedi-
cated, and had confidence in his fellow unit members. Wouldn't it make you mad to
have the nafional or regional organization assign some rank amateur to your unit
that you you knew little or nothing about?

a Before any new member is assigned to an active unit or to an important under-
ground project, he miwstundergo a period of training. During this training he will be
directed through the mails by an experienced member and seme of his activities may
be observed by other members without his knowledge. Oaly when a new member
proves himself to be conscientious, trustworthy, self-disciplined and able to operate

effectively alone will he be accepted as a "secure member" and invited to participate
with other unit members in a teamwork operation.

EXPENSES

Unfortunately, most good things don't come cheap. Although we make every
effort to keep down the expense of piiaclecuaiitted in the Secret Army Organization, you
mrust expect to pay your own way,

Dues to the Secret Army Organization are $3.00 per month, This money is

“absolutely necessary for use to maintain our centyal files and headquarters, for
postage and printing, to finance our Cxtenasve intelligence network, aud to maintain
training areas.

Each member will have other expenses depending on the type of activity he is
-engaged in. Every member will be expected to buy his own gun, amnunition and
other basic combat equipment. During training the new member may be expected to
buy certain books. or subscribe to ceriain magazines that his work requires. During
this time the new member will also be supplied with reading material on the strategy
and tactics of guerrilla warfare, This home work will make it possible for him to
fit in quickly to an active unit and participate effectively in actual maneuvers,
marksmanship training, ete. .

Following this preliminary training a member may be either assigned to an
A “existing unit, assisted in organizing his ownunit if he has shown sufficient leadership
qualities or hecome part of an underground network. .

Upon your acceptance into the Secret Army Organization you will be given a
definite sexicy .of projects deseribed in writing so you will know exactly what will be
expected of you

We hope that you can suceced in this effort bevause your country desperately

" THE COMBAT TEAM qariaiad

General Outline

The "Combat Teain" is the smallest organizational unit used by the Secret
Army Organization. When organized in the proper manner it is capable of opera-
tional initiative when. detached from the parent organivation. When developed to
its highest degree of efficiency the Combat Team is almost totally self-sufficient
and able to perform any one of several missions. ‘To attain these aims the follow-
ing elements are essential:

ae Equipment should be bieaeiaesiabai and standardized as much as pos-
sible,

b \ Communications, internal and external, must be capable of rapid.
‘ivensmission, be varied in nature, and be exercised with prime
emphasis on security.

a Internal coordination should be automatic in response. Confidence
among members of the team must be developed.

da Selection of each position on the team shouldbe basedon mn psycholog-
ical aspects as well as technical competence,

& Training of the men in each function should be at regular intervals
and continuous. Field problems should be given dry runs in detail,

f. The logistics problem should be studied with care, and made simple
and direct,

g. Rach team will have a"leader"' (Lieutenant) and an"assistant leader"
(Sergeant). These men shall be given special training by the Secret _
Army Organization at "leadership seminars". :

Th Team "marshalliug points" should be selected in advance and be
well defined. Practice'talerts" will determine the team's efficiency
{| in kesponse and security.

i. ° Terrain familiarity within the expected operational radius of the
7 team must be developed.
| ‘ je Weapons familiarity must be obtained through live firings at various
| : targets. Tear action raust be stressed as well a3 individual com-
petence,
Ke Tho team leader should see that a constant flow of information is

provided to team members on the ideological struggle. This will
» heip-induce the proper frame of mind in each member,

1 Team missions and largets must be identified and the proper train~
ing equipment made available for cach assignment.

coy

mm. The team leaders will be responsible for on ee the overall, |
: sdcurity of the unit. Personal feelings should not affect decisions 7
involving reprimand or dismissal of men from the team for reasons :
that endanger its operation or security. : | a

n Intelligence gathering as an important part of cach team member's
duties should be stressed. Information on the location and move-
ments of local communist and Ieft-wing enemies of the organization
should be sent to either Regional or General Headquarters.

o., The team leaders will be responsible for maintaining contact with
higher command and for the transmission of orders from same.

ORGANIZATION

The "Combat Team" will consist of six men. These six men will be divid-
ed into two sub-teams (Sections). Number One Section will consist of the Team
Lieutenant and two cther team members. Number Two Section will consist of the
Team Sergeant andthe two remaining team members. When completely assembled
the unit will act directly under the command of the Team Lieutenant, When split
into sections the Team Sergeant will carry out the orders of the Team Lieutenant

* during missiens but will be in immediate command of the Number Two Section,
In the absence of the Team Lieutenant the Sergeant will take command of the Unit.

7 TRANSPORTATION

‘Transportation of the Combat Team will be effected by the use of two car-
viers, Interception and/or destruction of one carrier will not, then, immobilize
the teara. In addition, each carrier can serve as a scouting elernent for the other,
Motorized carriers should be as inconspicuous as possible and still serve their
purpose. Jeeps and pickup trucks should be used only where such vehicles are
owned and used commonly by the general population or where the terrain makes
their use necessary. Most often an ordinary passenger car will suffice. The
model selected should have a good road clearance So it can be used on dirt roads,
Tire chains (if needed), hydraulic jacks, extra gas, water, and suitable tools
should be stored in the vehicle.

TRAVEL PROCEDURES

Underway, Carrier #1 will lead and Carrier #2 will trail, The "interval"
* will vary with conditions. In cities close-aboard trailing will be used. Open road,
by day, will require an interval of approximaicly 300 yards. At night this will
be reduced to approximately 100 yards. During travel, all equipment (especially
arms and ammunition) should be kept out of sight. Special team equipment and
weapons should be locked in the trunk of the vehicle until needed. The trunk key
should he carefully hidden se as to make it difficult to search the trunk in case
law enforcement agenis should stop the car on some pretext with the intention of
searching il illegally.

vEAPONS AND EQUIPMENT ;

, Selection of weapons and supplies should give the Combat Team. maximum
flexibility to meet auy condition that may be encountored in either rural or urban
warfare, Consideration should be given to all possible situations that may de-
velop relating to both traditional guervilla warfare and modern underground war-
fare techniques. It should be kept in mind that the Combat Team is a functional
part of a resistance network. it's activities should be coordinated with other
teams to take maximum advantage of its striking powers.

Disregarding the inclusion of weapons peculiar to a given mission, the
standard distribution ef men and weapons could be as follows:

cam (Team Lieutenant) AR-180 Assault Rifle, automatic pistol, sheath
knife, flare gun, and binceulars. 300 rounds of ammunition load-
ed in clips should be carried for the rifle, plus 50 extra rounds of
ammunition for the pistol,

#2. (Team Member) Riot Shotgun, automatic pistol, sheath knife, end
wire cutters (\ insulated handles), 100 rounds of No. 4 Buck-
shot in pouches for the shotgun, and 50 reunds of pistol amraunition.

#3 (Team Member) AR~-180 Assault Rifle, automatic pistol, sheath
7 knife, and smoke grenades or flares. 300 rounds of aramunition
in clips for the rifle, and 50 rounds of pistel ammunition.

#4 (Team Sergeant) AR-180 Assault Rifle, automatic pistel, sheath
7 knife, flare gun, and binoculars. Ammunition requirement is ~
the same as #1 man.

#5 (Team Member) Mi908 Springfield Rifle with sniper scope, auto-
matic pistol, sheath knife, and entrenching shovel. 100 reunds of
AP ammunition in bandoleers for the rifle, and 50 rounds of pis-
* tol ammunition,

#6 (Team Member) AR-180 Assault Rifle, automatic pistol, sheath
- - knife, and 30 feet of climbing rope with grappling hook. Ammu-
nition requirement is the same as #1 man.

a ADDITIONAL MATERIAL

In addition to the weapons and supplies already listed each team member
should have the following basic equipment;

ae Sleeping bag and waterproof ground cloth
b Canteen (1 quart army type)

GQ Survival rations for three days

a. First aid kit

e Gas mask with extra filter

f, . Flashlight with eatra batteries

Dear Fellow American,

Enclosed with this letter is your Preliminary Training Program. This
first program is only a briof outline of some cf the material that will be cover-
ed in later progra. ‘There are four basic programs used by the Secret Army
Organization: Intelligence, Security, Propaganda, aud Recruiting, in that
order. Each program will cost the new member $3.00 and will take between
one to three weeks to complete.

: The correspondence training program serves a number of purposes,
but the two major purposes are:

1. It lets us know which members of the organization have the patience
and determination to finish assignments given them.

2, It lets us be certain that the members have the necessary basic
training in inieHigence, security, etc., which is essential to al-
most any important task which we could assign a member in under-
ground warfare.

Proper training in these four basic skills is absolutely essential for
every member of an underground army. A member may be an expert in sur-
vival techniques, use of weapons, urban warfare taetics and all the rest but
experience has shown that without these other basic skills they seldom do much
fighting - they just commit suicide. a

Fer those of you who wish to become active and trusted members of the
Secret Army Organization, let us emphasize again that the quickest way of do-
ing so is to begin and diligently complete the basic training programs.

After you have complcted the five work projects listed in the Preliminary
Training Program send $3.00 in to your regular mail drop and we will send you
the first training program on Intelligence. In view of the urgent situation we
now face some of our new members may receive special as signments after
having completed the first two training progsains. If this happens please try
to redouble your efforts so that your special assigamonts can be taken caye of
while continuing to complete your regular training program.

PRELIMINARY TRAINING PROGRAM

It would he a mistake to think that our enemies have one set plan for the con-
‘quest of the United States. They are maintaining many continuous attacks on many
fronts at the same time - political, education, business, labor, aud even religion.
They areGontinuously probing for weak spots in (he defenses of our nation. Daring
the past fourly years so many openings have been left to them by the stupidity and

collusion of our national leaders that they have been ablé to advance almost at will.

There is litle we can do to change this situation at this time. Rather than
deplete our limited resources on futile attempis to do so, we must concentrate on
building a workable anti-communist underground army based on realities rather
than wishful thinking aad organized on the tried and proven principles of underground
warfare,

The communists have fifty yoars experience in supressing anti-commuist
underground activity. If we are to fight them successfully - if we are to hold ont .
until the finai viclory of freedom over tyranny - then our underground army is going
to have to be the most skillful and dedicated that the world has ever known. There
is only one kind of member thai can qualify for such an army - the very best!

This will require intensive training and practice. There is no shert cut to
perfection. By drawing on the talents of several of our mere experienced members

.we think we now have a training program that can develop that kind of underground
army. :

In this program four different types of training will be involved:

1. Correspondence and printed material.

2. Tape recordings, picture slides, charts, etc., sold or loaned to S, A. O.
units or members. :

3. Actual experionce - "Oa the job" training by carrying oul assignments
under supervision of more experienced members.

4, Training mancuyers - Duc to the difficulty of kecping large training ses- ~-:”
sions scerct the General Staff has decided that such training sessions will be held
only for small select groups that have alxeady completed sufficient preliminary
training at the local level. :

INTE. > SECURITY - PROPAGANDA

7 This preliminary training le

sonis designedio give our members basic know-
apapanda, This firstlessenis be

oa



preparation for advanced training jn these three important activities which will be
dealt with in greater detail further on in the training progran..

Underground warfare, as we customarily think of it, cannot succecd unless it
is supported by a well developed organization comprising all the essential functions
of intelligence, security, propaganda, communications, supply, medical services,
ete, 7 .

Of-all these, intelligence is most important. Let's consider one example:
Suppose you picked up a telephone hook, opened it up to any page at random, closed
your eyes and put your finger on one name, Now, suppose you read that name for
the first time and said to yourself, "Sometime in the next 30 days I'm going to kill
this man, "'

Consider the situation - one man, picked at random is marked for death, He
might be the most powerful, the wealthicst, the most influential man in that city but
none of thes things woul help him in the least. He would be defenseless. Why ?Bs-
cause you would have one thing that he did not have - intelligence. You would imow
his identity and he.would not know yours. So long as that condition continucd, there

would be no possible way in which he could arrange an adequate defense against you, a

Exactly the same situation exists between ourselves and our communist and a “s
‘socialist enemies. Our success will be directly proportionate to our knowledge of i
them sud inversely proportionate to their knowledge of us. :

Whatever a member's principal job may be in the Secrei Army Organization,
he must have a basic knowledge of intelligence techniques. This subject is there-
fore the first to.be considered in our training program, :

The word "intelligence", when used in a military sense refers to those
metheds thal can be used to gain useful information. We usually thinkof this as
knowledge of the enemy but it also includes information about the terrain, general
population, available supplies and ail other facts that will help in planning future
activities.

Intelgence is roughly divided into three parts: .

1. Observation, During a hoi war this includes scouting and patrolling,
observation of enemy troop movements, cte. On the cold war front this includes
shadowing of enemy personnel, surveillance of enemy officers, tapping of telephones,
interception of messages, cle.

2. Research and Analysis. ‘ Colleeting and cataloging all possible useful
information from general sources, newspapers, radio, trade magazines, cto. ,
then-matehing up isolated scraps of information untilan accurate picturcis obtained
of some situation that would nol therwise be known,

NW 68262 Docid:32989523 Page 1384 : neues toe vee 5



“9. Espionage, This involves the placing or: ees, agents within the
enemy personel where thoy can learn the enemy's plans first hand, steal the enemy's
documents or materials, influence or misdirect the enemy's plans or policies,

Suppese you had a chance to secsom2 important document for just afew
minutes. How quickly could you scan it for ils essential content? How well could
you separate the important from the animportant? Could you record this informa-
tion in a written message that ean be easily read and will not be misinterpreted?

Imagine that you are the leader of a patrol sent forward to observe and
track an enemy column prior to a possible ambush. From time to time you will
need to send back your observations in written form. Each $.A.O. member must
develop the ability to put his thoughts on paper in such a way that they will be easily
read and unmistakable.

The first two projects are designed to give the new member an opportunity
to test these skilis while learning ( or reviewing) basic elements of espionage
activity. When theschave been completed more advanced material will be furnished
to the member directly. Useful intelligence projects of increasing complexity and
importance will be assigned to those wishing to specialize in this work. :

SECURITY

. It is obvious what a great advantage we can gain over our enemies by proper
information ‘about their plans and activities. It is equally true that much of this
advantage will be lost unless we can keep our plans and activities secret from them,

“This is the basic purpose of all security activities. Overall secruity operations of
‘an underground mévement can be divided into five basic parts:

1. Protecting the identity of underground personnel and their families.
2. Keeping secret the location, movements and plans of underground units.

3. Keeping secret the location of underground headquarters, alternate
hideouts and supply depots.

_ 4 Protecting the identity of civilians, or individual members of the popu-
lation that are friendly to underground forces.

BR Maintaining secrecy of communications,

As we have alroady said ii is difficult to even guess what forms the coming
conflict will take. Novertheless, the strategy of all successful underground move-
meats mvét satisly these three basic principles:

First, is the cineiple of Deliberate Delay", During this state, the undor-
ground gathers ifs forces, checks ifs security, prepares ils intelligence, estublishes
ils lines of communications and wails for the enemy tohecame complacenLand over-
confident. :

3 3h

NW 68262- Docid:32989523 Page 1385



Secondis the mn of Provocation". At the regina or this stage only,
a fow real patriots aye willing to take part inundergratnd activity, The vast mijor-
ily of the poyitlation is still wishfully thinking that they can "get slong" with the
oppressive forces. They want only tobe tell alone and will not take action until they
are personally threatened. During ihis stage the undcrground conducts a series of
actions which provoke the enemy forees into making harsh repressive- measures on
the general population. This turns the gencral population against the oppressive
forces and convinces them:that the underground is really their only hope.

r

Stage Three may be called "Principle of Natural Allies". When Lhe govern-
ment's action against the general population becomes sufficiently brutal then large
numbers of people will be willing to help or join the underground, Their reasons
for doing so may ba aumberous and their ideology man not always be the same as
the basic underground movement. During this stage minor differences between t
different underground groups must be minimized and all of our natural allies must
be rallied to the causa of freedom.

The inteliigence branch of our organization ‘is well aware of the communist
infiltration and control of tho present United States government. It can rightly be
said that we are now partialiy controlied by a foreign ideology. Thus, we are al~
i ready engaged in Phase J of this conflict. How long this will continue until open
warfare breaks out is anyone's guess. Olce again, the best prediction of our in-
tellignece department is that Stage Il will last for several months, perhaps even-
years, This will be a time of assassination and courter assassination, terror and
counter lerror. During this phase the "average citizen! may avoid direct-conflict
at the price of his dignity and individual freedom. Known patriots will be in ex-
treme danger.

-For most people membership in the Secret Army Organization will not
imate ially increase their danger during this time, For many years our enemies
have carefully catalogued the namo and address of every person who has ever
written a patriotic letter to a newspaper. The membership lists of the more prom~
inent “conserva ie oeeeneete have long been available to communist infiltrators
in these organizations,

Continued activity and membership in other conservative organizations by
members of the S.A,O. is desirable in many cases but those individuals should not
identity themselves as mambors of the Sceret Army Organization. For most of our
own members it will be best if you do not take part in the activitics of these other
organizations. Although’ muny of you are already "marked" men a certain degree
of security can still be achieved by quietly dropping of other right-wing activities
and keeping your membership in the S.A.Q. secret from all except your most
trusted felow members.

There may come a time when the average American is still able to go about
his business with little reyimentation bat during which you us a knowa or suspected
patriot, may be sought out for arrest or ussassinaiiun.

1 ‘Project TT listed al the end of this chapter may make it possible for the or-
ganization lo contact vou and render assistance should you ever find it necessary lo
go into hiding with litUe advanee notiec.

Project IV is a first step toward learning more about your enemies and at
the same time, confusing them as to which side you are really on.

PROPAGANDA

Another essential, function of the underground is to convincingly inform the
general public of what they stand for and thus gain the support of the general popu-
lation. This must be done threugh propaganda, both written and spoken. Under
conditions of enemy cecupation the spreading of anti-cemmunist propaganda would
obviously be very dangerous. Evea now there are certain phases of our propaganda
effort thal is best done by surreptitious means. Thus, observation, communication
and propaganda are three clementary duties of every underground meraber.

Never before has propaganda been so important to the ultimate ouicome of a
major confiict. The ulitmate object of any war is to force your desires-on the minds
of your enemies. Our enemies are attempting to do this by the non-violent means
of psychological warfare,

‘TRAINING PROGRAM

INT. IGENCE

We are faced with a dangerous enemy who has repeatedly boasted of his
plans to destroy our Constitutional Republic and to ensiave our peopie.

For more than fourty years they have been infiltrating their agents into
the most sensitive areas of labor, press, entertainment, education, law, com-
munications, religion, industry and government. The degree of their success
is made obvious by our government's failure to-oppose communisra internation-
ally and by our fellow citizens' lack of interest in their own preservation.

_ We already know a considerable arnount about this enemy; their origin,
objectives, approximate strength, organizational structure and general meth-
ods of operation. : Ht :

There are four areas where we especially need additonal information:

q 1. Details of the techniques used in espionage, infiltration and subver-
sion by individual agents, inciuding the methods by which they control their

fellow travelers.

2. The equipment used for surveillance, communication, assassination,

‘ sabotage, ete., by individual enemy agents.

3. Working details of their short range programs either in operation or
planned for the near future,

‘4, The actual identity of enemy agents, fellow travelers and sympathi-
zers along with details regarding their work, place of residence, cover opera-
tion, means of transportation, travel pattern, personal appearance, mental
characteristics, personal lives, business and organizational activities.

Our ultimate victory or defeat may depend on our ability to obtain
enough of this vitally important information,

There are literally thousands of sources from which bits of valuable in-
formation can be obtained. These range from such extremes as the local news-
papers to documents stolen from the enemy's guarded vaults.

oa acs



A +The methods of gathoring intelligence are roughly divided into two
groups: 1) Research and Analysis, and 2) Fspionage.

Espionage includes all the "illogal" means of obraining information, such.

_ a8 wire-tapping, intereception of mail, stealing of documents, secretly photo-

graphing records, infiltrating spies inte enemy organizations, bribing or black-
mailing individuals of the enemy apparatus.” :

Research and Analysis includes the careful systematic search of all

_ hewspapers, magazines, trade journals, house organs, political pamphlets,

books, public records, ete., to sift a few "needles" of valuable intelligence
from several "haystacks" of general information. .

Professional intelligence organizations obtain about 95% of theiz infor-

. mation from Research and Analysis and only about 5% from Espionage. When

espionage techniques are used, they prove most effective when a specific mis-

sion is carefully planned out in advance which takes advantage of all possible
background information that may be obtained by research methods.

Let's examine how these varicus techniques might be used to obtain
additional information of the four basic types we need most.
7 1. Details of the techniques used in espionage, infiltration and subver~
Sion by individual agents including methods by which they control their fellow
travelers. :

An agent trainee may learn something of the general espionage methods
used by communist agenis who have defected-from the party and have then
wriiten about their experiences, Beyond this they are of very little value. The
actual details of such techniques are uniformly neglected. :

More useful information can be obtained from the study of past court
records in which evidence has been presented in espionage cases, Hints and
clues may occasionally be picked up frem continuous and careful study of the
regular news media. Really basic information of this type, however, must be
ohtained by infiltration and espionage techniques. :

a

"2, ‘The equipment used for surveillance, communications, assassination,

Hints about the type: of hidden microphones, short wave transmitters,

pionage agents sometimes mentioned by chance in the regular press or
news magazines, in connection with reported spy cases, Technical-details and
construction plans occasionally are given in the electronics ox "Popular Science"
type magazines. Other information may be requ directly from the manu-
facturers of such equipment,

‘The type of short acting or long acting poisons best suited for assassina- * .~
ticn under various conditions might be anticipated by a careful study of toxicol~ «
egy; from "Chemical Abstracts" and Biclogical Abstracts"; from current maga-
zines on pharmacolegy, aswellas from such magazines as "Scientific Monthly"
aud "Science Newsletter", all available from larger city libraries.
Information on explosives is available from ordinance journals, litera-
ture from manufacturers, technical books, mining and drilling magazines, etc.

Naturaily, such special fields of interest are best pursued by some per-
son who alreai ndy has an aptitude in each particular line.

This is one of the things that makes us feel that the American people are
uniquely equipped to form a deadly effective underground, Nowhere else in the
world does any population have as many useful hobbies and avocations that could
be adapted to underground warfare. -Many by products of these hobbies can be
used as sabotage insirnments, Just one typical example - the dust from grind-
ing wheels in metal shops should be saved to mix with grease for the bearings
of enemy machinery. :

3, Working details of their immediate and future plans and activities. .

Advance information about "peace marches" and racial demonstrations
gar be had by subscribing to appropriate communist front publications. Details
as to the size of the demonstration and degree of violence anticipated must be
obtained by infiltrating such organizations. Communist plans for future propa-
ganda campaigns, subversion, espionage, blackmail of government officials,
gic,, may be learned directly by infiltration or may bededuced from a close
study of their past activities. ~

4, Identity and personal information about enemy agents.

This requires the full scope of counter espionage activity; research and
analysis of enemy publications, monitoring. of comraunist sponsored meetings,
surveillance of party offices, infiltration of enemy apparatus, reeruitmont of
double agents, interception of enemy communications, ete, , ete.

’ TECHNIQUES: OF EFFECTIVE RESEARCH —

1. Every researcher should ‘be constantly on the alert for useful infor-
mation in the general news media - radio, TV, magazines, etc,

2, Each researcher should have one field of interest to which he gives
special attention.

Ye

-=NW68262- Rogld:32889' 523-Rage:



ne arom ay

For example:

One researcher night read every hook available on "escape and evasion"
and all the stories or articles written on prison escapes, looking for ideas that
might someday help cur members escape from a sdivcesiiieeiini camp.

Another gosearcher might continuously search the communist front

_ publications for names of fellow travelers; for amouncements of future meet-

ae rallies or similar activities; for additional information that would tie

suspected communists to luown communist t organization; for friendships, bus-

iness connections and family relationships belween known communists, and un-
known communists. 7 .

" Bach city should have one researcher that carefully reads the daily
papers to extract such information as; names of speakers at left wing mee! oe
ings, names and addresses of both lefi and right wing letters to the editor,

social functions attended by known communists, names of persons who might . t
: be potential recruits, news of coming "peace marches" and similar demonstra- i . !
tions, expressions of either peo or anti communist sentiments by local public “y
officials, educators, businessmen, ministers, etc., evidence of communist ot
inspired violence, sabotage or blackmail. 7 et

- "There is an almost endless variety of areas that need to be covered.
Based on his or her own interests and abilities each researcher should choose
the specialty for which they are best qualified.

8. Be as specific as possible. Look for details. Include btlue-prints,
drawings or photographs of ail technical equipment when possible, Don't ex-
“pect your analyist to be a "mind reader‘', Include -all the facts. Continuously ae
ask yourself the questions: Would this information be of value to the Secret FE
Army Organization? To individual espionage agents? To other members ? j

To our technical specialists? oo

4, Avoid editorial opmions and general news items as these are of
little value and needlessly swamp our limited staff of analyisis.

5, Do all the work locally that you possibly can. If the person is local,

look thom, np in the telephone book or cross index, Double cheek to make sure

7 the address is correct mid that they still live there. Type cards if possible,

otherwise, print plainly, Include phone numbers and. licence numbers of cars
whenever possible. : : 7

6. Use standard 8 x 5 inch ‘index cards fox sending in information on
\ individuals. Clip pages of magazines or photostat import: articles, In
outlining buoks, be sure important facts are fully esvered,

EXTREMIST MATTERS

ple

The purpose of this memorandum is to advise that a new
group known as "Secret Army Organization'' (SAO), a small ultra-
conservative paramilitary organization recently formed in the
San Diego, California, area, reportedly has been involved in

extremist acts. aoa .

A confidential source recently furnished information
regarding a clandestine meeting and plans to form a new white-
hate organization called SAO which reportedly would take. the place

‘ of the Minutemen group in San Diego. The Minutemen, also a para-
" . military group, was organized in Missouri during 1960 to act as
a resistance to the spread of communism by use of guerrilla tactics.

During the evening of 1/6/72, two shots were fired,
injuring one person, at the residence of Peter Bohmer, a San Diego
State College professor. Shots reportedly came from the direction
of a passing automobile and were fired by a white male described (?
as being in his mid twenties. Bohmer and others at his residencel~ {
at the time of the shooting reportedly are active in the San Diego
Convention Coalition which is a New Left group formed during the
Fall of 1971 to organize demonstrations at the Republican National i
Convention scheduled to be held in San Diego during August, 1972. I
‘Bohmer reportedly has indicated that on 1/6/72 prior to the
shooting he received two threatening telephone calls from persons
stating they were members of SAO, A sticker of SAO was a
- pasted to the door of Bohmer's office.

£4,

Some SAO organizers appear to be identical with individ- °

uals who were formerly involved in Minutemen « ‘activities, Our ‘

r San Diego Office has been instructed to vigorously purs ue all af

a SECRET ARMY ORGANIZATION

A confidential informant has made background
information available concerning the emergence of a new
“patriotic" group under the name "Secret Army Organization",

7 Five former members of the Minutemen organization
met in secret in October, 1971, for the purpose, in their
words, of effecting "an organization of loyal Americans
dedicated to the preservation of both national and individual
freedom," 7 aaa

According to source, this is predominantly a
Minutemen oriented movement which couches its statement of
principles as follows in a piece of its literature captioned
"Join the Secret Army Organization”:

1) To prepare the means of personal’ defense 7
and survival in case of enemy attack,

2) To resist and expose the spread of communist
influence and propaganda within our own national
boundaries,

3) To investigate by means of our own secret
memberships the infiltration of communist sympathizers
into American organizations of government, business,
labor, religion and education,

Senay ARRY ORGAN MT TION -
GENERAL HEADQUARTERS

- Dear Fellow American,

- Your application for membership in the Secret Army Organization has been
processed and approved. Itis our profound hope that your membership inthe
S.A.O. will prove tobe a benefit to the organization and yourself as well. A
dedicated member will find that his association with our organization is a way of
life that is far more rewarding than the ordinary mediocre existence of his fellow
enlightened citizens.

For security purposes all records regarding individual members are listed
by mtimbers only. Your number will be _ . Please sign all future
correspondence addressed to the organization with this number. You need not list y

_ your address unless it is different from the one in our records. 8

Another security measure employed by our organization is the use of mail

7 drops. -The mail’drop is an address listed in a fictitious name of a person or
compariy not connected with the organization. Each member is assigned one that
he will use in sending all reports, correspondence, materials, etc., to the organ-
ization. Your assigned mail drop is:

We have a tremendous job_ahead of us. Certainly, none of us pretend to
Imow what the future holds for ourselves or for our-native land. We do feel, how-
ever, that our freedom is gravely threatened. It is not always possible to know
the best thing to do. But we do know this ~ our forefathers have given us a life of
freedom and opportunity such as never existed before in all history. We must
strive to pass this heritage on to future generations intact. :

Qur organization is not suggesting or doing anything more than Americans
meee have always done ~ starting in 1776.

Enclosed is some further information about our organization, its history,
objectives, and programs. Your record has been turned over to our training sec-
tion and you should receive your first training program within two weeks.

. Sincerely yours, Age

NgkA sak PRACTICAL SECURITY MEASURES

1: Use deceptive measures. Subscribe to one or more left-wing periodicals
or get on the mailing list of some "peace movement". This will keep the postal in-
specotrs guessing as to which side you are really on. While doing this our members
can be of great assistance in searching this left-wing literature for names and ad-
dresses of fellow travelers and forwarding this information for our Central Intelli-
gence files. We desperately need people to assist in _ work. Please inquire as
to detailed instructions for such activity.

“2. Always usetwo envelopes in sending mail to any patriotic “organizations or
to any other member of our own organization. Do not put a return address on the

outer envelope. Put your return address on the inside envelope with the words,
"return postage guaranteed".

7 . 8, Place some opaque material such as tin foil, carbon paper, etc. between
the inner and outer envelopes to prevent your mail from being read by infra-red
-cameras. :

A Send all letters from corner mail boxes or from post offices where you

are not known. -

“5. Be careful in the use of the telephone. Avoid telephone calls to known
members of the organization as much as possible.

6. Prepare telephone codes ahead of time for future protection,
; “a In recruiting new mentbers always learn as much as you can about the
prospective recruit and make sure he is not an infiltrator before you identify your-
self as a member of the organization. :
: 8. Members of the organization in each area should be divided into four
groups: :

AL Those who have been identified publicly or by law enforcement agencies
“' as members of the Secret Army Organization.

faa B. Those persons not known as members of this organization but who are
generally known as being patriots.

vs C.* Those persons who have kept their political beliefs hidden.

D. Members who profess tobe liberal for the purpose of infiltrating enemy
organizations.

All members should be very careful in making contact with persons ina
different category than themselves. For example, people in Class 1) should be
very secret in their contacts and communications with persons of Class A or Class

B. Each membe aust respect thesecurity of every o member. Do not, tinder
any circumstances, identify one member of the organization even to other members
without his expressed permission on each and every occasion. aeeriiels

9. Avoid loose talk. Do not discuss organizational plans in public places“
where you could be overheard. Do not even hint at such a discussion in the pre-
sence.of non-members. 7

10. Do not write patriotic jetters to newspapers or magazines under your
.  ownhame. To do so achieves very little except to identify you to the enemy.

11. If you are already known as a patriot, or as a member of this organiza-- ee
tion you may find itadvisable to spread the rumor that you have become disillusicned 7
with the right-wing or for you to pretend a gradual loss of interest.

12: Classify your various members addresses, you communications and-:
your other activities as "top secret", "secret" or "restricted". Use your most
secret lines of communication only for the most important messages rather than
flooding them with unimportant material.

13. Demand obedience to all security measures from all members. Per-~
sistent disregard for security measures should be cause for disciplinary action.

14. Check your lines of communication from time to time by sending phoney :

Dear Fellow American,

Enclosed with this letter is your Preliminary Training Program. This

‘first program is only a brief outline of sorne of the material that will be cover-

ed in later programs. There are four basic programs used by the Secret Army
Organization: Intelligence, Security, Propaganda, and Recruiting, in that
order. Each program will cost the new member $3. 00 and will take between
one to three weeks to complete.

The correspondence training program serves a number oft purposes,
but the two major purposes are:

1. It lets us know which members of the organization have the patience
and determination to finish assignments given them.

2, It lets us be certain that the members have the necessar y basic
training in intelligence, security, etc., which is essential to al-
most any important task which we could assign a member in under-
ground warfare.

Proper training in these four basic skills is absolutely essential for
every member of an underground army. A member may be an expert in sur-
vival techniques, use of weapons, urban warfare tactics and all the rest but
experience has shown that without these other basic skills they seldom do much
fighting - they just commit suicide. :

For those of you who wish to become active and trusted members of the
Secret Army Organization, let us emphasize again that the quickest way of do-
ing so is to begin and diligently complete the basic training programs.

After you have completed the five work projects listed in the Preliminary
Training Program send $3.00 in to your regular mail drop and we will send you
the first training program on Intelligence. In view of the urgent situation we
now face some of our new members may receive special assignments after
having completed the first two training programs. If this happens please try
to redouble your efforts so that your special assignments can be taken care of
while continuing to complete your regular training program.

“PRELIMINARY TRAINING PROGRAM

Tt would he a mistake to think that our enemics have one set plan for the con-

~ quest of the United States. They are maintaining many continuous attacks on many
fronts at the same time - political, education, business, labor, and even religion.

They are continuously probing for weak spots in ihe defenses of our nation. Daring

the past fourly years so many openings have been left to them by the stupidity and

collusion of our national leaders that they have been able to advance almost at will.

There is little we can do to change this situation at this time. Rather than
deplete our limited resources on futile attempts to do so, we must concentrate on
building a workable anti-commanist underground army based on realities rather
than wishful thinking and organized on the tried and proven principles of underground
warfare.

The communists have fifty years experience in supressing anti-communist
underground activity. If we are to fight them successfully - if we are to hold out
until the final victory of freedom over tyranny - then our underground army is going
to have to be the most skillful and dedicated that the world has ever known. There
-is only one kind-of member that can qualify for such an army - ‘the very best!

This will require intensive training and practice.. There is no shori cut to
perfection. By drawing on the talents of several of our more experienced members
we think we now have a training program that can develop that kind of underground
army.

In this program four different types of training will be involved:

1. Correspondence and printed material. : .

‘2. Tape recordings, picture slides, charts, etc., sold or loaned to S.A, O.
units or members.

3. -Actual experience - "Oa the job" training hy carrying out assignments
under supervision of more experienced members.

4, Training maneuvers - Due to the difficulty of kecping large training ses-
sions secret the General Staff has decided that such training sessions will be held
only for small select groups that have already completed idnaneeniiiae preliminary
training at the local level.

LLIGENCE . pa ‘

Underground warfare, as we customarily think of it, cannot succeed unless it §
is supported by a well developed organizalion comprising all the essential functions
of intelligence, security, propaganda, communications, supply, medical services,
ete.

O£ all these, intelligence is most important. Let's consider one example:
ee » Suppose you picked up a telephone book, opened it up to any page at random, closed
your eyes and put your finger on one name. Now suppose you read that name for
the first time and said to yourself, "Sometime i in the next 30 days I'm going to kill
. this man," 7

Consider the situation - one man, picked at random is marked for death. He

. might be the most powerful, the wealthiest, the most influential man in that city but
none of thes things woul help him in the least. He would be defenseless. Why?Be-
cause you would have one thing that he did not have - intelligence. You would know
his identity and he would not know yours. So long as that condition continued, there
would be no possible ivay in which he could arrange an adequate defense against you.

Exactly the same situation exists between oursolves and our communist and
-Socialist enemies, Our success will be directly proportionate to our knowledge of
them and inversely proportionate to their knowledge of us.

Whatever a member's principal job may be in the Secret Army Organization,
he must have a basic knowledge of intelligence techniques. This subject is there-
fore the first to be considered in our training program. :

The word "intelligence", when used in a military sense refers to those

“ methods that can be used to gain useful information, We usually think of this as

knowledge of the enemy but it also includes information about the terrain, general

population, available supplies and all other facts that will help in planning future
bassist

Intelligence is roughly divided into three parts:

1. Observation. During a hot war this includes scouting and patrolling,
observation of enemy troop movements, etc, On the cold war front this includes
shadowing of enemy personnel, surveillance of enemy officers, tapping of telephones,
interception of messages, etc. ‘

2. Research and Analysis, Collecting and cataloging all possible useful
information from general source's, newspapers, radio, trade magazines, ete. ,
then matching up isolated scraps of information until an accurate picture is obtained
of some situation that would not therwise be known.

8. Espionage. This involves the placing or recruiting of agents within the
. enemy personnel where they can learn the enemy's plans first hand, steal the enemy's
- documents or materials, influence or misdirect the enemy's plans or policies.

Suppose you had a chance to seesome important document for just afew
minutes, How quickly could you scan it for its essential content? How well could
you separate the important from the unimportant? Could you record this informa-
tion in a written message that can be easily read and will not be misinterpreted?

Imagine that you are the leader of a patrol sent forward to observe and
track an enemy column prior to a possible ambush. From time to time you will
need to send back your observations in written form. Each S.A.O. member must

* develop the ability to put his thoughts on paper in such a way that they will be easily
+ read and unmistakable, .

The first two projects are designed to give the new member an opportunity

* to test these skills while learning ( or reviewing) basic elements of espionage

activity. When these have been completed more advanced material will be furnished

to the member directly. Useful intelligence projects of increasing complexity and
importance will be assigned to those wishing to specialize in this work. -

SECURITY f

It is obvious what a great advantage we can gain over our enemies by proper
information about their plans and activities. It is equally true that much of this
advantage will be lost unless we can keep our plans and activities secret from them,
This is the basic purpose of all security activities. Overall secruity operations of
an underground movement can be divided into five basic parts:

1. Protecting the identity of underground personnel and their families.

2. Keeping secret the location, movements andplans of underground units.

‘ 7 : 7
3. Keeping secret the location of underground headquarters, alternate
hideouts and supply depots.

4, Protecting the identity of civilians, or individual members of the Popu-
lation that are friendly to underground forces,

- 5. Maintaining secrecy of communications,

. As we have already said it is difficult to even guess what forms the coming
conflict will take. Nevertheless, the strategy of all successful underground move-
meats must satisfy these Unree basic principles:

First, is the "Principle of Deliberate Delay", During this state, the under-
ground gathers its forces, checks ils security, prepares its intelligence, establishes
its Lines of communications and waits for the on to become complacent and over-
confident, . ; 70

ope | “CORRE

IT TA een et eng en ent ret

sata



" Secondis the "principle of Provocation", At the beginning of this stage only
a few real patriots are willing to take part inunderground activity. The vast major-
ity of the population is still wishfully thinking that they can "get along" with the
oppressive forces. They want only tobe left alone and will not take action until they
are personally threatened. During this stage the underground conducts a series of
actions which provoke the enemy forces into making harsh repressive measures on
the general population. This turns the gencral population against the oppressive on
forces and convinces them: that the underground is really their only hope.

Stage Three may be called "Principle of Natural Allies". When the govern-
* ment's action against the general population becomes sufficiently brutal then large
numbers of people will be willing to help or join the underground. Their reasons
for doing so may be aumberous and their ideology man not always be the same as =
the basic underground movement. During this stage minor differences between
different underground groups must be minimized and all of our natural allies must
be rallied to the cause of freedom.
i
z
i
i

The intelligence branch of our organization is well aware of the communist
infiltration and control of the present United States government. It can rightly be
said that we are now partially controlled by a foreign ideology. Thus, we are al-
ready engaged in Phase I of this conflict. How long this will continue until open
warfare breaks out is anyons's guess. Once again, the best prediction of our in-
tellignece department is that Stage I will last for several months, perhaps even Tae
years. This will be a time of assassination and counter assassination, terror and
counter terror. During this phase the "average citizen" may avoid direct conflict
at the price of his dignity and individual freedom. Known patriots will be in ex~
treme danger.

For most people membership in the Secret Army Organization will not
materially increase their danger during this time. For many years our enemies
have carefully catalogued the name and address of every person who has ever
i written a patriotic letter to'a newspaper. The membership lists of the more prom-
inent "conservative" organizations have long been available to communist infiltrators
in these organizations.

_ Continued activity and membership in other conservative organizations by
members of the S.A. O, is desirable in many cases but those individuals should not led
identify themselves as mémbers of the Secret Army Organization. For most of our .
own members it will be best if you do not take part in the activities of these other
organizations. Although many of you are already "marked" men a certain degree _
of security can still be achieved by quietly dropping out of other right-wing activities sie
and keeping your membership in the S.A.O. secret from all except your most
trusted fellow members. 7 ;

There may come a time when the average American is still able to go about
his business with little regimentation bat during which you as a known or suspected
patriot, may be sought out for arrest or agsassination. .

Project mr listed at the end of this chapter may make it possible for the or-
ganization to contact you and render assistance should you ever find it necessary to
go into hiding with little advance notice.

Project IV is a first step toward learning more about your enemies and at
the same time, confusing them as to which side you are really on.

PROPAGANDA

Another essential function of the underground is to convincingly inform the
general public of what they stand for and thus gain the support of the general popu-
lation, This must be done through propaganda, both written and spoken. Under
conditions of enemy occupation the spreading of anti-communist propaganda would
obviously be very dangerous. Eveéa now there are certain phases of our propaganda
-effort that is best done by surreptitious means. Thus, observation, communication
and propaganda are three elementary duties of every underground member.

- Never before has propaganda been so important to the ultimate outcome of a
major conflict. The ulitmate object of any war is to force your desires on the minds
of your enemies. Our enemies are attempting to do this by the non-violent means
of psychological warfare,

Selection of weapons and supplies should give the Combat Team maximum

* flexibility to meet any condition that may be encountered in either rural or urban

warfare, Consideration should be given to all possible situations that may de-

velop relating to both traditional guerrilla warfare and modern underground war-

fare techniques. It should be kept in mind that the Combat Team is a functional

part of a resistance network. It's activities should be coordinated with other
teams to take maximum advantage of its striking powers.

: Disregarding the inclusion of weapons peculiar to a given mission, the
standard distribution of men and weapons could’ be as follows:

: #1 (Team Lieutenant) AR-180 Assault Rifle, automatic pistol, sheath PRES
7 knife, flare gun, and binoculars. 300 rounds of ammunition load- ci
ed in clips should becarried for the rifle, plus 50 extra rounds of
ammunition for the pistol. .

- #2 (Team Member) Riot Shotgun, automatic pistol, sheath Imife, and
wire cutters (with insulated handles). 100 rounds of No. 4 Buck-
shot in pouches for the shotgun, and 50 rounds of pistol ammunition.

_ #8 (Team Member) AR-180 Assault Rifle, automatic pistol, sheath
knife, and smoke grenades or flares. 800 rounds of ammunition
in clips for the rifle, and 50 rounds of pistol ammunition.

: . #4 | (Team Sergeant) AR-180 Assault Rifle, automatic pistol, sheath
knife, flare gun, and binoculars. Ammunition requirement is
the same as #1 man.

#5 (Team Member) M1903 Springfield Rifle with sniper scope, auto-
matic pistol, sheath knife, and entrenching shovel. 100 rounds of
AP ammunition in bandoleers for the rifle, and 50 rounds. of pis-
tol ammunition. 7

#6 (Team Member) AR-180 Assault Rifle, automatic pistol, sheath
knife, and 30 feet of climbing rope with grappling hook. Ammu-
nition requirement is the same as #1 man.

ADDITIONAL MATERIAL

in addition to the weapons and supplies already listed each team member

aa should have the following basic equipment:
a Sleeping bag and waterproof ground cloth
b. Canteen (1 quart army type)
G Survival rations for three days

,? SECRET ARMY ORGANIZATION



m. The team leaders will be responsible for maintaining the overall
security of the unit. Personal feelings should not. affect decisions
involving reprimand or dismissalof men from the team for reasons
that endanger its operation or security.

nets Intelligence gathering as an important part of each team member's
duties should be stressed. Information on the location and move-
ments of local communist and left-wing enemies of the organization
should be sent to either Regional or General Headquarters.

o The team leaders will be responsible for maintaining contact with
higher command and for the transmission of orders from same.

ORGANIZATION

The "Combat Team" will consist of six men. These six men will be divid-
ed into two sub-teams (Sections). Number One Section will consist of the Team
Lieutenant and two other team members. Number Two Section will consist of the
Team Sergeant andthe two remaining team mem ers. When completely assembled
the unit will act directly under the command of the Team Lieutenant. When split
into sections the Team Sergeant will carry out the orders of the Team Lieutenant
during missions but will be in immediate command of the Number Two Section.
In the absence of the Team Lieutenant the Sergeant will take command of the Unit.

TRANSPORTATION

Transportation of the Combat Team will be effected by the use of two car-
riers, Interception and/or’ destruction of one carrier will not, then, immobilize
the team. In addition, each carrier can serve as a scouting element for the other.
Motorized carriers should be as inconspicuous as possible and still serve their
purpose. Jeeps and pickup trucks should be used only where such vehicles are
owned and used commonly by the general population or where the terrain makes
their use necessary. Most often an ordinary passenger car will suffice. The
model selected should have a good road clearance so it can be used on dirt roads:
Tire chains (if needed), hydraulic jacks, extra Bas, water, and suitable tools
should be stored in the vehicle. 7

. "| PRAVEL PROCEDURES

Underway, Carrier #1 will lead and Carrier #2 will trail, The "interval"
will vary with conditions. In cities close~aboard trailing will be used. Open road,
by day, will require an interval of approximately 300 yards. At night this will
be reduced to approximately 100 yards. During travel, all equipment (especially
arms and ammunition) should be kept out of sight. Special team equipment and
weapons should be locked in the trunk of the vehicle until needed. The trunk key
should be carefully hidden so as to make it difficult to search the trunk in case
law enforcement agents should stop the car on some pretext with the intention of

searching it illegally. We .

THE COMBAT TEAM

_ General Outline

The "Combat Team" is the smallest organizational unit used by the Secret
Army Organization. When organized in the proper mamner it is capable of opera-
tional initiative when detached from the parent organization. When developed to
. its highest degree of efficiency the Combat Team is almost totally self-sufficient
and able to perform any one of several missions. To attain these aims the follow- ~
ing elements are essential:

Equipment should be well-chosen and standardized as much as pos-
sible,

Communications, internal and external, must be capable of rapid

“ transmission, be varied in nature, and be exercised with prime

emphasis on security. 5 .
2 a

Internal coordination should be automatic in response. Confidence
among members of the team must be developed.

Selection of each position on the team shouldbe based on psycholog-

ical aspects as well as technical competence.

‘Training of the men in each function should be at regular intervals
and continuous. Field problems should be given dry runs in detail.

The logistics problem should be studied with care, and made simple
and direct. : :

‘Each team will have a"leader” (Lieutenant) and an"assistant leader"

(Sergeant). These men shall be given special training by the Secret
Army Organization at "leadership seminars".

Team "marshalling points" should be selected in advance and be
well defined. Practice "alerts" will determine the team's efficiency
in response and security.

. Terrain familiarity within the expected operational radius of the

team must be developed.

Weapons familiarity must be obtained through live firings at various
targets. Team action must be stressed as well as individual com-
petence. 7

- The team leader should see that a constant flow of information is

provided to team.members on the ideological struggle. This will
help induce the proper frame of mind in each member.

Team missions and targets must, be identified and the proper train-
ing equipment made available for each assignment.

selves as a last ling of defense against communism. To
exemplify the necessity of such an organiz: we quote
the 1960 Annual Report of the Commiltce on merican,
Activities as follow:

“gvents of the past year have provided convin
evidence that the American people cannot rely complete!
on this country’s armed ferces to protect themselves
from communist domination and slavery. This is not
because our military forees lack the power or the will to
defend this country, but rather because the nature of the
attacks boing nia.le on the United States by its major and
only significant enemy are so designed as to render con~
ventional military forces as ineffective as possible for
defense purposes."

Starting from s.othing 50 years ago, communism
now rigidly controls one-third of the human race and has
subverted to varying degrocs the remaining two-thirds,
I the past 20 years the communists have conquered 20
sovereign nations, one by armed conquest and 19 by ia-

ternal subversion or negotiation,

‘There is not one of these countries in which the
communists rule by the consent of the people. Every=
where they must perpetuate themselves by terror. They
remain in power oaly through the use of the most brutal
police state tactics.

The communists consider their party workers
not simply as an accessory to armed conquest but as the
actual spearhead of any invasion into new territory.
From this point of view the United States was "invaded"
by Soviet troops more than 30 years ago. It has beea
authoritatively estimated that the commtnists now have
an army of 500,000 combatants already landed on Ameri-
can shores and already working by the most insidious
means to destroy our American way of life.

never will know the meaning of honesty.

Communism must be defeated, not merely resist-

‘TRAINING PROGRAM

eee sn
INTELLIGENCE

We are faced with a dangerous enemy who has repeatedly boasted of his
plans to destroy our Constitutional Republic and to enslave our people.

For more than fourty years they have been infiltrating their agents into
the most sensitive areas of labor, press, entertainment, education, law, com-
munications, religion, industry and government. The degree of their success
is made obvious by our government's failure to oppose communism internation-
ally and by our fellow citizens' lack of interest in their own preservation.

We already know a considerable amount about this enemy; their origin,
objectives, approximate strength, organizational structure and general meth-
ods’ of operation.

There are four areas where we especially. need additonal information:

1. Details of the techniques used in espionage, infiltration and subver- _

sion by individual agents, including the methods by which they control their
fellow travelers.

2. The equipment used for surveillance, communication, assassination,
sabotage, etc., by individual enemy agents.

8. Working details of their short range programs either in operation or
planned for the near future. :

4, The actual identity of enemy agents, fellow travelers and sympathi-
zers along with details regarding their work, place of residence, cover opera-
tion, means of transportation, travel pattern, personal appearance, mental
characteristics, personal lives, business and organizational activities.

Our ultimate victory or defeat may depend on our ability to obtain
enough of this vitally important information.

There are literally thousands of sources ‘from which bits of valuable in-

formation can be obtained. These range from such extremes as the local news-
papers to documents stolen from the enemy's guarded vaults.

“i

CONF —
4g



The metudds of gathering intelligence are *. sughly divided ‘into two

groups: 1) Research and Analysis, and 2) Espionage.

Espionage includes all the "illegal" means of obraining information, such
as wire-tapping, inlereception of mail, stealing of documents, secretly photo-
graphing records, infiltrating spies into enemy organizations, bribing or black-
mailing individuals of the enemy apparatus. -

Research and Analysis includes the careful systematic search of all
newspapers, magazines, trade journals, house organs, political pamphlets,
books, public records, etc., to sift a few "needles" of valuable intelligence
from several "haystacks" of general information.

Professional intelligence organizations obtain about 95% of their infor-
mation from Research and Analysis and.only about 5% from Espionage. When
espionage techniques are used, they prove most effective when a specific mis-
sion is carefully planned out in advance which takes advantage of all possible’

_ background information that may be obtained by research methods.

Let's examine how these various techniques might be used to obtain
additional information of the four basic types we need most.

1. Details of the techniques used in espionage, infiltration and subver-
sion by individual agents including methods by which they control their fellow

travelers,

An agent trainee may learn something of the general espionage methods
used by communist agenis who have defected-from the party and have then
written about their experiences. Beyond this they are of very little value. The
actual details of such techniques are uniformly neglected.

More useful information can be obtained from the study of past court
“records in which evidence has been presented in espionage cases. Hints and
clues may occasionally be picked up from continuous and-careful study of the
regular news media. Really basic information of this type, however, must be
obtained by infiltration and espionage techniques. :

2. The equipment used for surveillance, communications, assassination,
| * sabotage, etc., by individual agents.

Hints about the type of hidden microphones, short wave transmitters,
niiniture tape recorders, ete. used in surveillance and communication by es~
pionage agents sometimes are mentioned by chance in the regular press or
news magazines, in connection with reported spy cases. ‘Technical details and
construction plans occasionally are given in the electronics or "Popular Science"
type magazines. Other information may be requested directly from the manu~
facturers of such equipment.

The type of short acting or long acting poisons best suited for assassina-
tion under various conditions might be anticipated by a careful study of toxicol-
ogy; from "Chemical Abstracts" and Biological Abstracts"; from current maga-
zines on pharmacology, as wellas from such magazines as "Scientific Monthly"
and "Science Newsletter", all available from larger city libraries.

Information on explosives is available from ordinance journals, litera-
ture from manufacturers, technical books, mining and drilling magazines, ete.

Naturally, such special fields of interest are best pursued by some per-
* son who already has an aptitude in each particular line.

This is one of thethings that makes us feel that the American people are
uniquely, equipped to form a deadly effective underground. Nowhere else in the
world does any population have as many useful hobbies and avocations that could
be adapted to underground warfare. Many by products of these hobbies can be |

- used as sabotage instruments. Just one typical example - the dust from grind-
ing wheels in metal shops should be saved to mix with grease for the bearings
of enemy machinery. 2

3. Working details of their immediate and future plans and activities. -

Advance information about "peace marches" and racial demonstrations
-can be had by subscribing to appropriate communist front publications. Details
as to the size of the demonstration and degree of violence anticipated must be
obtained by infiltrating such organizations. Communist plans for future propa-
ganda campaigns, subversion, espionage, blackmail of government officials,
ete,, may be learned directly by infiltration or may be deduced from a close
study of their past activities. if

4, Identity and personal information about enemy agents.

This requires the full scope of counter espionage activity; research and
analysis of enemy publications, monitoring of communist sponsored meetings,
surveillance of. party offices, infiltration of enemy apparatus, recruitment of
double agents, interception of enemy communications, etc., etc.

TECHNIQUES OF EFFECTIVE RESEARCH

1, Every researcher should be constantly on the alert for useful infor-
mation in the general news media - radio, TV, magazines, etc,

2, Each researcher should have one field of interest to which he gives
special attention.

For example:

One researcher might read every book available on "escape and evasion"
and all the stories or articles written on prison escapes, looking for ideas that
might someday help our members escape from a concentration camp.

Another researcher might continuously search the communist front
publications for names of fellow travelers; for amouncements of future meet-
ings, rallies or similar activities; for additional information that would tie
suspected communists to known communist organization; for friendships, bus-
iness connections and family relationships between known communists and un-
known communists.

Each city should have one researcher that carefully reads the daily
papers to extract such information as; names of speakers at left wing meet~
ings, names and addresses of both left and right wing letters to the editor,
social functions attended by known communists, names of persons who might

be potential recruits, news of coming "peace marches" and similar demonstra-~

tions, expressions of either pro or anti communist sentiments by local public

officials, educators, businessmen, ministers, etc., evidence of communist .

inspired violence, sabotage or blackmail.

There is an almost endless variety of areas that need to be covered.
Based on his or her own interests and abilities each researcher should choose
the specialty for which they are best qualified.

8. Be as specific as possible. Look for details. Include blue-prints,.
drawings or photographs of all technical equipment when possible. Don't ex-
pect your analyist to be a "mind reader", Inciude all the facts, Continuously
ask yourself the questions: Would this information be of value to the Secret
Army Organization? To individual espionage agents? To other members?
To our technical specialists ?

4, Avoid editorial opinions and general news items as these are of
little value and needlessly swamp our limited staff of analyists.

5. Do all the work locally that youpossibly can. If the person is local,

- look them up in the telephone book or cross index. Double check to make sure

the address is correct and that they still live there. Type cards if possible,
otherwise; print plainly. Include phone numbers and licence numbers of cars
whenever possible,

6. Use standard 3 x 5 inch index cards for sending in information on
individuals. Clip pages of magazines or photostat important articles. In
outlining books, be sure important facts are fully covered.

7. Always state the source ofall information reported to the organiza-



Printed below is a sample index card showing the propor placement of
information. Use it as a guide when making out your cards,

: : A review of Las Vegas files indicates that JOE
BURTON is probably identical to JOHN OWEN BURTON, aka, a
former SI subject of the Las Vegas Office because of his
past Minutemen activities. In March, 1971, Oklahoma City
became origin in the BURTON case after investigation showed
that he had permanently changed residence to Tulsa, Oklahoma.
(Bureau file 100-448471, Oklahoma City file 157-975). a

Las Vegas files further indicate that CRU) DOYLE |
-is possibly identical to JACK CONAN DOYLE, JR. (Las Vegas
file 157-553, Bureau file 105-175539). DOYLE in 1965-66
was a self-admitted member of the Minutemen. Investigation
showed that subject dropped out of the organization in 1968
and has had no further association with it since that time.

_-v History of the Secret Army Organization
One early morning iri February, 1970, a group of six Minutemen leaders from
four states mot secretly in Northern Arizona to discuss the crisis that the arrest and
imprisonment of two top Minutemen leaders and the assasSSinationof a third had

‘brought on the organization. Although séme of these men had met before in their roles
as Minutemen group leaders, others were meeting for the first time.

After much discussion, two principal points were agreed upon. First, that the
Minutemen as a national coordination organization of militant right-wing groups had
effectively been destroyed by the pro~communist elements inside the Justice Depart-
ment, While individual units still existed throughout the country, few had the financial
support or leadership to be really effective. Second, that the need for such a coordi-
nating organization wasgreater than ever in view of the increased revolutionary activity
by communists in the United States.

With these two points in mind, suggestions were put forward on a course of
action to be followed. After ameeting that lasted all that day and far into the next
morning, an overall plan of action was finally agreed upon. All present agreed to
merge their individual units together and form a new organization under the command

". of.one leader elected from among themselves, with the other five to be members of a
Genéral Staff that would advise and assist the new leader.
While retaining the basic programs and policies of the Minutemen, it was
- decided that not only should this hew organization-have a different name, but also a
completely new chain of command and organizational structure. If the new organiza-
tion was going to survive the attacks that befell the old one, a whole new approach
would be needed. Never again could the arrestor death of a few leaders be allowed to
cripple the entire organization. .

For this reason it was decided that only a highly Secu military type
orgainization with a definite chain of command would have any chance of success. This
then, was the beginning of the Secret Army Organization. Beginning with an original
force of hard corepatriots that numbered fewer than two hundred, the Secret Army
Organization began thejob of picking up the pieces and continuing to fight for national
and individual freedom. Using this cadre of dedicated personnel as a nucleus, the
8.A.O. has been recruiting and training new members in the ceed they will need as
the {freedom fighters of tomorrow.

The leaders of the S. A. O, have no idea of fighting a last ditch stand. We have

“ no desire to commit suicide ourselves or to let our members do so. We have a -

strategy which we believe will wltimately lead to viclory. Only one thing is essential.
We must start preparing and training NOW! We of the S. 4. O. believe that our country
is worthy of any sacrifice. If you fecl- the same way, we invite you to join us,

: The Secret Army Organization is the most active, most completely dedicated and
most selective in its membership of all the many patriotic organizations in America.
We are willing to make any sacrifice for our country and we fully expect that some of
us will have to make the ultimate sacrifice before victory is achieved. Our very lives
depend on each other. There is no place in this organization for bunglers, playboys or
lukewarm conservatives, If you join the Secret Army Organization, there might easily
come a time that your life would depend on how Some some other member had
learned his job!

Unless you are especially well informed on .the domestic andworld political
situation, it is probable that you have a lot to learn about the present threat our nation
faces, Unless you have had many years experience in actual underground warfare,
there is undoubtedly a lot you can learn from the experts in our organization who have

‘OUR NATION IS IN IMMEDIATE DANGER

It is possible that within a very few years, perhaps even within months, our
nation could be conquered and enslaved by the communists. To prevent this we must
know as much as possible about our enemies. Unless we know who they are and what
they are doing we _ not succeed in our efforts to maintain a free America.

THE RESISTANCE MOVE ‘MENT

In driving an invader from your land the resistance involved goes through three
stages of development. :

1) The Underground Network
2) Active Guerrilla Warfare
3) Open or Conventional Warfare

‘The conventional warfare stage uses everything in the way of weapons that the
enem, y does but must also have active guerrillas and underground agents working against
the enemy, too. In the present state’ of military tactics conventional warfare cannot
succeed unless these other two ingredients are used simultancously.

The first ‘step is to form an underground network. An active guerrillasystem
_must have the support of an underground network of approximately three times its own
size. This underground must supply the active guerrilla fighter with supplies, con-
cealment, information, etc. Anunderground network starts with departments of
intelligence, security and propaganda in that order.

Sabotage, espionage, subversion, infiltration, escape and evasion, training,
clandestine fabrication of supplies, counterfeiting enemy documents, recruiting, com-
munications and propaganda are other phases of underground activity, Each member
of the Sceret Army Organization, to be offective, must have a working knowledge of
all these tactics as well as the mililary taclics moré commonly associated with guerril-

la activitics. Conrrpeepas.

\ ; Boe Peeeees He ASSIGNMENT ‘TO UNITS

’

| : Many pcople that inquire about membership in the Secret Army Organization
seem to have-an idea that they will be immediately accepted into an active unit,
Look at it this way. Suppose you had spent a year or more carefully recruiting and
training until you had a hard hitting team where evory individual was reliable, dedi-
cated, and had confidence in his fellow unit members, Woulda't it make you mad to
have the national or regional organization assign some rank amateur to your unit
that you you knew little or nothing about?

Before any new member is assigned to an active unit or to an important under-
ground project, he mustundergo a period of training. Daring this training he will be * Hy
directed through the mails by an experienced member and some of his activities may
be observed by other members without his knowledge. Oaly when a new member
proves himself to be conscientious, trustworthy, self-disciplined and able to operate
effectively alone will he be acceptedas a "secure member" and invited to participate
with other unit members in a teamwork operation,

- EXPENSES .-

Unfortunately, ‘most good things don't come cheap. Although we make every.
effort to keep down the expense of membership in the SecretArmy Organization, you
must expect to pay your own way,

Dues to the Secret Army Organization are $3.00 per month. This money is
absolutely necessary for use to maintain our central files and headquarters, for
postage and printing, to finance our extensive intelligence: network, and to maintain
i - tyaining areas.

Each member will have other expenses depending on the type of activity he is
| : engaged in. Every member will be expected to buy his own gun, ammunition and
other basic comhat equipment. During training the new member may be expected to
- buy certain books or subscribe to certain magazines that his work requires. During
this time the new member will also be supplied with reading material on the strategy
and tactics of guerrilla warfare. This home work will make it possible for him to
fit in quickly to an active unit and participate effectively in actual maneuvers,

marksmanship training, ete.

ca Following this preliminary training a member may be either assigned to ar
existing unit, assisted in organizing his own unit if he has shown sufficient leadership
qualities or hecome part of an underground network,

Upon your acceptance into the Secret Army Organization you will be given a
definite series of projects described inwriting so you will know exactly what will be
7 expected of you.

* We hope that you can succeed in this effort because your country desperately
needs patriots at this time.
