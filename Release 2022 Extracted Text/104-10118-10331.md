Forwarded as Attachment One under separate cover

are reports

prepared byiWalica B. RO:TON on the activities of LIRING-3, dated 9,

13, 22, 23, 25, 26 and 27 May 1967. Fonlarded as Attachment Trol also

under separate cover, are photocopies of correspondarce exchanged between

LIRING-3 in texico City and Paz rESeEJO in Havana.

nant Three hezewith, is a pamphlet obtaihed by LIRING-3 vhich contains

the text of the nessage allegedly sent the Tri "Continental organiaation

by Ernesto "Cha" GUEVARA.

There is little question that'lthINg 3 mst often ask himsel

just where his association with ROVTON is taking hin and must speculate

about just what RONTON is after.

to conjectures

There ere obviously times then, left

and suppositions,

LIRING-3 must feel lixe

"guitting,"

Yet, the ascendancy gradually developed by ROnToN over LIELG-3 has

reached the point where LIRING-3 is unilling to go back to the crab;

uninteresting life he lived before meeting ROUtON. the result of LIRING-3"s

"secgnd thoughts" has up to now been a desire, in the end, to collatorate

cation of the confusion which exists in LIRING-3*s mind as a result of

the contacts he maintains at PONTON's urging with the Cubans, Guatemalan

rebels, and various shades of Mexican and Central Amertean leftists.

In addition LIRING-3, La professional artist finds himself involved in

the development of a conmercial venture, an undertaking for which he is

ill equipped....

This chines shortcoming requires very close guidance by

ROWTON and, in turn, makes LIRING-3 even pore dependant on his case officer.

Thus, while LIRING-3 occasionally thinks of returning to painting and 08

giving art lessons land develops qualms about, taking money from RottoN for

what he considers to be little result, LIRIN-3 keeps levolving himselt

deeper and deeper in activities of interest to RovroN.

The above does not mean that firing-y's activities should not

be subjected to every operational control possible, on the contraty.

LIRING-3's story concerning the manner in which birth certisicates dan

It now appears, on the other baud, that

"LiRING-3 is convinced he. can lay

on a meeting with CARCIA in advance so that ROUTON can have a look at

thé Guatemalan.' In spite of GARCIA's cautiousness, swch a meeting has

to take place sooner or later. The Stationis ready. It also appears

staff was improving. Rowton suggested that it might be the right time to give

IIRING/4 some compensation for her efforts. IIRING/3 agreed' and promised to

ask LIRING/4 to be at the safehouse at 1000 on 2? May, so that Rowton could

again talk privately with her and give her the money ( Rowton suggested 500

contacts he had had in the past that were on the periphery of the official

Cuban gircle. He mentioned specifically the case of Silvid and Horacio Dura:

5. Rowton counseled LIRING/3 against any further contact with the Durans on

the ground that it migut put him under some sort of suspicion

was to be gained fron such

a contact.

Anibastrolor

of the Commission in Mr. Whitten' office. This meeting had been

requested to ask for a fresh translation of the taped conversation

between Cuban President Dorticos alld Ambassador Armas.

Win Scott bad told the Commission staff visiting Mexico City that

his translators, in the rush at that time, might have misconstrued

certain nuances of meaning in what was a difficult recording In

viewv of this, Mr. Slawson asked that a ne translation be made,

if possible, by a person knowledgeable of the Cuban dialect.

According to Mr. Slawson, only y

essrs. Rankin,

Willens, Coleman (2) and he presently low of the telephone taps

in Mexico City. Slawson, Willens and Coleman were briefed on

the taps during their visit to Mexico City.

3. In about three weeks the staff will begin presenting to

the Commission evidence on the conspirational aspect of the

assassination. At this time, apparently, their evidence is against

the existence of a plot. They will wish to present to the Commission

the Armas - Dorticos conversation. Slawson suggested the possibility

that a kno wedgeable CIA man could make this presentation; interpreting

the conversation in the light of our study:

Mr. Wilton said that we will again translate the tape,

using the best available Cuban linguist, and oned again study the

nuances of the conversation.

Any presentation to the Commission,

howevet, would have to be referred to Messa

Malins and Roçca

According faMI, Slawson, no member of the

Commission now knows of the telephone taps in Mexico City (he did

not mention MI. Dulles).

. Mr. Whitten carefully briefed Mr. Slawson (probab

rebrieled nim) on the importance of these telephone taps to U.S

security and the grave damage that would be done to U.S. - Mexican

relations if ki

rowledge of their existence became public.

6. Mr. Slawson quite clearly,was a bit unhappy that certain

information could not be used, sinde the laps were the only source.

OSWALD's very bad Russian was the example he used. & asked

what opinion Mrs. OSWALD had of her husband's Russian. She"

thought that he spoke it very well.

:?: Mir. Slawson asked if the retranslation of the Dotticos - Armas

conversation could be made available to him by the end of next week.

(201-746720

According to MI. Slawson, the Commission Staff had come

up with the ided that Silvia DURAN might be invited to the United

States, ostensibly to be interviewed by a periodical, and then

questioned by the Commission. The Chief Justice turned down the

proposal at once, on the ground that she wab a Communist and

U,S. - Mexican relations might be damaged This idea has been.

abandoned.

9 FromMr,. 'Slawson's remarks it is evident that the

preparation of the Commission's report has begun, and is in its

initial stages •

work of retranslating the Dorticos-Armas conversation from the

tape had started.
