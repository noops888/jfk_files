I Do RELEASE Wy PART
4A SAMUEL MANNARINO, ska. Cl TOTAL DENIAL”

It is noted that on 6/29/61 agents of IRS, Pittsburgh, took
part in what the press alleged was a nationwide series of
raids on gamblers. Local IRS agents concentrated their raids
at about 2:00 PM in the Turtle Creek Valley section of
Allegheny County, about 10 miles East of Pittsburgh, appre-
hending some 25 small numbers operators.

on 7/6/61, PG 612-C advised SA THOMAS G. FORSYTH, III:

The MANNARINOS knew of the impending raids by IRS agents at
9:30 AM on.6/29/61, several hours before the raids occured.
This information was relayed quickly to all numbers writing
and/or horse bookies who turn in to the MANNARINOS throughout
the New Kensington-Arnold=Vandergrift, Pa., area. Apparently
the MANNARINOS did not know where the IRS agents would raid,
merely that raids would come off. : W

BOTH SUBJECTS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED’ ARMED AND DANGEROUS.:
