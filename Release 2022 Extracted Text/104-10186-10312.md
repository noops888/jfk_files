Introduction : pie c eed

1, The Cuban foreign intelligence service, the General Directorate of
Intelligence (Direccion General de Inteligencia - DGI), in dis-
charging its function of protecting Cuban interests and security
And promoting the poligiss of the Cuban Government, employs agents

i of many nationalities. Although its activities extend to Europe
and Africa, tts principal agent strength is in Latin America,
Agents have in gengral two types of assignments: collection of
infcrmation on the local government and the local situation, and
promotion of revclutionary activity, including guerrilla warfare.
Ali DGU agents abroad are therefore divided into two basic cate-
gories according to fuiction: intelligence agents charged with
collection cf ifformation and penetration of local governments and
organizations, who are truly clandestine, i.e., are not’ known in
their target countries as Cuban agents; and guerrilla warfare and
sabotage agents, charged with directing and supporting revolution-
ary activities, who are often known as Cuban agents to the local
Communist and leftist groups with which they work, The two types
of agents are trained separately and are controlled by different
departments in the DGI neadquarters in Havana, ‘intelligence agents
by the Illegal Department (Departamento Ilegal,called Ilegal) and
guercilla agents by the LN or National Liberation Department.

recruited by that department, Of three known agents in this cate-

gory, one was a nember of the Cuban internal security service, the

Department of State Security (Departamento de Seguridad del
Estado - DSE), Julio Danasu Vasquez. He was a trained parachutist
at the time of his rec ment. Two other known agents, Rafael
Guzman and “Chino” (name unknown), were recruited because they
were friends of one of: the [llega Department officers, Saul
Gonzalez, One criterion for recruitment is that the agent sball
not have a wide circle of acquaintance,

Agents of other nationalities are usually recruited by agreement
between a DGI officer and the local Communist or leftist organiza
tion to which the person belongs, but there are other possibie

- Sources,

a. Foreigners visiting Cuba. Most foreign visitors to Cuba are
handled by the Cuban Institute of Friendship with Peoples
(Institute Cubano del Amistad con los Pueblos - ICAP), which
arranges for their travel to Cuba, their itineraries, lodging,
and cntertainzent while there; and their return travel to
their hones or other destinations. The DGI has an arrangement
with ICAP under which members of the DGI MO Department
(Department of Illegal Centers - Departamento Centros Ilegales)
mect and interview foreign visitors for the purpose of extract-
.ing any information of valve to Cuba and of assessing them as
potential agents. Contacts are so well camouflaged as normal
ICAP courtesies that few of the visitors realize that they are
in touch with an intelligence agency, Thc DGI docs not deal
with foreign diplomats, who are the responsibility of the DSE,
but it has access to any other foreigners. If the MO Depart-
ment considers any visitor a potential agent, especially if he
shows a Narxist or extreme leftist attitude, it reports his
name and whatever it has learned about him to either the
Tllegal Department of the DGI, which handles intelligence
agents not in contact with local Communist or leftist groups,
or the LN Department, which works with guerrilla agents in
contact with such groups. Referral is made on the basis of
membership in or attachment to an organized group. In no case
does the MO Department recruit the agent; that privilege is
reserved for the operational departments,

b. Foreigners resicent in Cuba. The BC Section (Colonial Bureau ~
Buro Colonial) of the SI Department (Department of Information
Services - Departamento Servicios de Informacion) of the DGI
is responsible for screening foreigners residing in Cuba
(except diplomats) for potential agents, Like the MO Depart-
ment, the BC Section makes no actual recruitments, but reports
potential agents to the Illegal or LN Department, according to
whether they are or are not affiliated with an organized group.

c. Fersons volunteering infornation from abroad. The MO Depart-
ment is also responsible for screening letters fror persons
abroad who volunteer information or support to the Cuban
Governzent, Its principal aim is to extract any useful in-
formation from such letters, but it also notes any persons who
appear to have agent potential aad refers them to the proper
operational department for consideration.

consulate.? Since there are no official Cuban missions in Central
America, the agent nogmally makes his way to Mexico and obtains
his Cuban visa there, In order to keep secret from the author-
icies in his own country that he is going to Cuba, the agent
candidate gives another destination, and the Cuban consular
offices help by issuing his Cuban. visa on a sgparate sheet of
paper instead of stamping it in -his passport. The agent candi~
date may pay his own passage, but usually he is supplicd funds or

-an airline ticket through a local DGI agent or the leftist group
; to which he belongs; thé ‘funds are issued by the Central Process-

ing Section, Whether hé is issueda ticket or given money to buy
his own, ‘the funds originate with the DGI and are forwarded to
the candidate's area through the DGI representation in the Cuban

Embassy in Mexico.

DGI officers attached to Cuban consulates. are alerted to assist
agent candidates in’ their travel. The agent is given a password,
which varies from place to place; agents from El Salvador, for
example, are told to mention “Mauricio.” When a DGI officer at a
consulate interviews visa applicants, he expedites the visa for
anyone using the proper password; if the password is not used, he
stalls the applicant for several days while he cables Havana for
authority to issue a visa, If the visa is issued in Mexico, the
agent trainee is given a plane ticket on Cubana, the Cuban Govern-
ment airline, and is told when he is to leave, Accommodations and
subsistence are provided if the trainee has to wait for passage.
Agent candidates from British Guiana sometimes travel to Cuba by
small boats, not regular shipping service,

Agent trainees going to Cuba use a variety of cover stories, For
the local authorities, their travel is to some other destination,
often as tourists, students, or laborers, For their own group,

no cover story is required; for their families and friends, tour-
ist or student travel is the usual explanation. For persons out-
side the group, if Cuba is known as the destination, the cover
story is a scholarship for study at a Cuban school or university.
Groups of trainees from the same leftist organization often travel
together fron their own country to Mexico and thence to Cuba, but
intelligence agent trainees always travel alone,

Upon arrival at the Havana airport, trainees are met by DGI
officers appearing as ICAP officials, The DGI has an 2rrangement
with the Cuban immigration authorities under which persons of DGI
interest are cleared through entrance formalities without compli-
cations, The trainees are placed in hotels while final training
arrangements are made, then are transferred to the schools where
their training will be given, or to private houses or apartments
if they are intelligence trainees, The case officer.from the DGI
department which will thenceforth control their activities is re-
sponsible for them during their stay in Cuba, Using the .funds
allotted by the department, he provides them lodging, food, per-
sonal expenses, medical care, and anything else ‘they neet’ during
thé training period; shoes, clothing, and personal items are
drawn for them from the DGI warehouse. :

As far as possible, DGI trainees live the normal life of students
and use thé cover story that they are studying on Cuban Government
scholarships, Their movements in Havana are not restricted,
except that arrangements are made to keep them away from fellow~
citizens visiting or living in Cuba, Since most of their train-
ing is given in Havana, and-the course is intensive, they do not

completed, if there is any delay in returning students to their

and financed by the DG] liaison officer in (CAP, During delay

Upon arrival in Cuba, each agent_is assigned a pseudenym, which
he uses throughout his training. Actually, within the guerrilla
schools, Students in either large cr small groups use their real
names, Since their identitis ary usaaily krewn to their fellows

Courses last three to Six months, depending on ths type of train-
ing and the ultimate mission of the agents, but in special cases
may last as long as a year (two Guatenalars were trained that
Jong), The instructors ar# ail milxtary, didwa from the Cuban
army; there is one for each military specialty, and a political

instructor,

Training covers all aspects of guerrilla warfar>, weapons hand-
ling, explosives, sabotage, demolition, military tactics, combat
engineering, etc., as well as means of countering anti-gterrilla
activities, Weapons are of both Amfrican and Communist-Bloc
provenance. Some specialized training 1s given; for example,
there is a school for frogmen at the scuth of the Jaimanitas River
in Barlovento, west of Havana, and two ,Guatemalans and a Dominican
were trained as frogmen during 1963, Guerrilla agents do not
normally, however, receive any communications training (secret
writing, radia, etc,): when chey returs home, their channel of
communication for sending information and receiving instruction
and support is through the organized group to which they belong.

Practice’ in guerrilla warfare and weapons and explosives handling
is given on the school premises in Havana, In addition, both dur-
ing the course and near its conclusion, groups of students are
taken to the Escambray Mountairis in, Las Villas Province to put
their training into practice and to learn to live off the country.
They are integrated into regular Cuban army units for short i:
periods and take pact in any military activities then in progress,
During 1963, for example, a group of Guatemalans and a group of
Salvadorians were taken separately to the Escambray: and partici-
pated in the operations then being conducted by the Cuban army
against anti-Castro guerrillas in the area,

Guerrilla students are required to meet a standard of complete
familiarity with a2) the tnformation and material forming part of
their instruction, Examinations are given regularly; students |
cho fail them are required to repeat the instruction, A student
may have to repeat the entire course if he cannot pass the neces-
sary examinations. There are many failures, An agent candidate
who proves completely incapable of mastering the course is
removed from the school, and an effort is made to find him a
special job elsewhere, During the course, the instructors issue
monthly reports to the school administration, both on the course
as a whole and on the performance of each student. A copy is sent
to the case officer, Reporting on students covers personal
attitude, discipline, capability in study, political level, etc,

While guerrilla training is in progress, two special preparations
for the future are made, The first is the arrangement of the
agent's-travel to his target area, cither his own country or
another, Passports and other documents are prepared for his use
on the return trip; funds are allocated for his future activity;
and provisions are made for his carrying money or possibly special
equipment back with him if that is required, The second thing 18
the assessment of the traince for other possibilities. . Through-
eut the course he is observed and evaluated; if he shows more than
usual aptitude and ability, he comes under consideration as a
potential intelligence agent for collection of information or
penctration of his home government. If a trainee is assessed as
Suitable for intelligence-agent work, he is removed from the
guerrilla course and receives special instruction for more
clandestine and more complicated tasks,

Training of Intelligence agents

wz,

Intelligence (illegal) agents, from whatever source they are drawn
(foreigners visiting or resident in Cuba, contacts of DGI agents
or organizations abroad, or guerrilla trainees selected for
Superior abilities), come under the DGI Illegal Department, which
is responsible for their recruitment, training, and subsequent
handling, Since they are truly clandestine agents, their rela-
tionship with the DGI requires special security from its incep-
tion, They travel to Cuba alone rather than in a group, and in +
Cuba they are kept apart from other persons of their own aatton-"
ality and from one another, Agents of Cuban nationality are also
kept apart from other nationalities and during training lead
normal lives as far as possible, Both Cubans and foreigners are
kept from contact with the Cuban Government or official circles
to avoid suspicion of any government connection. As with guer-
rilla trainees, agents are assigned pséudonyms for use with the
general public in Cuba and for use in field operations later,
Agents are not allowed any. knowledge of any DGI installations

except the ones to which they are specifically assigned for train-
ing, and never.enter any DGI official establishment or the case

officer's home,

A foreign agent candidate arriving in Cuba is first debriefed by
the case officer on his background and qualifications, since up
to that time the BGI has only advance notice of his selection and —
knows little about him. The interview 1s recorded, but without
the trainee's knowledge, On one occasion in early 1964 a case
officer arranged to meet a new trainee in a Havana restaurant for
the preliminary interview, Tho case officer provided himself with
a pocket tape recorder, which he tested 1n advance and found was
in good order, When he started to record the interview, however,
he discovered that he had cither forgotten to adjust the mechan-
ism after he had tested it, cr he pushed the playback instead of
the record buttdn; the restaurant was suddenly electrified by a
voice saying: "Testing, one, two, three; testing, one, two,
three," The interview was hastily concluded and was rescheduled
the next day in the safehouse where the agent, a Guatemalan, was
lodged; in this case, of course, the agent was aware that it was
being recorded, The results of the interview are entered in a
biographical questionnaire covering all aspects of the agent's
family situation, political views, background and education,
employment experience, connections, and intelligence potential;
the document forms the basis of the agent's DGI personal file,

In addition, the agent is required to weite a complete report on
the operational situation in his country, including types and
styles of dress, cating habits, working heurs and holidays,
location of public buildings and places of entertainment, the
press and its type and circulation, urban and rural transporta-
tion, sducational facilities, airlines, perseaal documents for
Adestification, and lccal linguistic idioms,

In cases where an intelligence agent is selected from among
guerrilla trainees, he may romain under the jurisdiction of the
LN Department, which retains ham as a guerrilla agent but arranges
for his training as an illegal agy ining for intel-
ligence work, however, is always s¢pasate from guerrilla training
and is not revealed to the Conmunist Party or leftist group
sponsoring the agent, who becomes, in effect, a Semi-overt Cuban
agent in guerrilla activities and a clandestine agent in intel-
ligence reporting or other functions, One such agent, trained in
Cuba in 1963, was returned to thé Dominican Republic about mid-
1963; he carries on revolutionary activities with the Dominican
Popular Movement wimiento Popular Deminicane - MPD) as a known
Cuban-trained guer “tire works as an illegal
agent (under the LN Department), without the knowledge of his MPD

colleagues, as a penetration of the MPD,

The case officer from the Illegal Department arranges for the, com-
plete support of the agent during training, providing him, lodging
in a private house or apartment, supplying his food and clothing
and personal equipment fcom the DGI warekouse as is done for
guerrilla agents, and keeping. him in pocket reney, If the agent
is married, the expenses of his dependent fanily are also covered
by the DGI. The case officer does not give any instruction, but
arranges with the MI Department (Department of Technical Opera-
tional Support) of .the DGI for training the agent in the skills
he will require tor his future mission, The Ni Department has no
schools or regular training sires but uses private houses or
apar(ments, which are precured and maintained oy the DGf General

Administration Department. The same safchouse is used for suc-
cessive agents, but only one is trained there at a time. Follow-
ing the agent's operational plan as laid down by the case officer,
the MI Department provides instruction‘in the necessary skills
through its own sections and various departments of the DGI out-

‘side the operational departments,

All. illegal agents are trained in normal tradecraft elements such
as clandestine meetings, clection and use of dead drops, recruit-
ment of agents, establishment and operation of agent nets (only
for agents specifically intended for network direction), use of
informants and collaborators, photography, and some form of com-
Practice 1n operational techniques such as surveil-

in appropriate sections of Havana. Each agent in addition is in-
struétod--on ‘matters relating to his particular mission, and is
given whatever communications training he will need. Communica-
tions receives special emphasis because all arrangements must be
made during the training period, Techniques include secret writ-
ing, codes and ciphers, radio transmission and reception, micro-
dots, and microfilm, Only a few agents are trained in the latter
two techniques,.and not all are tra‘ned ‘in radio, but almost all
receive instruction on secret writing, which 1s the most widely
used means of communication between. agents in the field and their
case officers, The type of communications training the agent will
recelye is usually discussed with the case officer by the MI
Department, but sometimes the MI Department decides without con-
sultation and sometimes {t consults the SI Department for opera-
tional background on the country where the agent will work,

The ST Section (Technical Section - Seccion Tecnica) of the MI
Department has the main responsibility for agent communications
training and itself conducts the training in secret writing. It
first requests the LG Section (Chemical Laboratory - Laboratorio
Quimico) of the MI Department “to devise and prepare a secret

writing system for the agent's use, Most systems depend on
sympathetic inks made with salt, blood, urine, and other materials;

the type assigned the agent is determined by his mission and
operational situation. Each agent receives a different system,
although two agents working in the same operation use the same
system, An agent normally learns two systems, one for incoming
correspondence, development only, and one for outgoing corres=
pondence, preparation only. In addition, if he is to direct an
agent network of his own which requires internal clandestine com-
munication, he is taught a third system, both preparation and
development, for use in the network. The case officer not only
does not participate in the training but knows very little about
the secret writing systems, since the processing of messages fron
agents in the field is handled by the ST Section and he receives
only the developed text, and the ST Section, for reasons of
security and compartmentation, refuses to tell the case officeé
anything specific about communications.

The ST Section trains the agent thoroughly on the materials and
methods he is to use and gives him practice in processing messages
under direction, then in preparing test messages and in developing
and interpreting test messages prepared by the instructor, The
training period varies according to the complexity of the system
and the requirement for competence from the agent, In cases

agent is expected to attain a high Standard of performance. An
ager: who fatls the course may have to repeat it, if the opera-
tional plan requires it and his schedule permits, Training
normally continues until the agent has achieved the desired pro-
ficiency; an evaluation of his ability is included in his personal
ftle, Actually, however, secret writing traiiing has not been
uniformly successful in DGI experience; in some cases, communica-
tions from the agent in the field could not be read at headquarters
because the secret writing was improperly prepared, and agents
have also had difficulty 1m. deciphering messages. sent to them.

Agents never write directly to DGI headquarters; all their mail
in both diréttions goes through accommodation addresses, usually
in another country, Instruction in selection and use of accom-
modation addresses is given by the MS Department (Department of

Legal Centers - Depa o Centros Legales), which handles DGI
field stations and t Fondence, because accommodation

addresses are usually in countries where Cuba has official repre-
sentation and the field station services the letter drops, Out-
going communications to agents go by diplomatic pouch to the field
Station and are mailed from there to the agent. Agent letters to
headquarters go to an, accommodation address, where they are picked
up by the field station and forwarded by diplomatic pouch. The
country used for incoming communications 1s usually different from
that for outgoing; an agent in El Salvador, for example, may send
his reports to Havana via Mexico and receive headquarters direc-
tions and replivs via Paris, The MIS Department controls the
assignment of accommodation addr-ssys, Since the DGI believes
that there is less darg-r of xposing the agent if his cover
letters containing secret writing are as realistic and natural as
possible, the agent is bricfed rot only on th» accommodation
address to which he is to write, but alse on the persons who
actually live there--ages, Fackgrcund, r=lataonships, etc.--so
that he can reter te birthdays and personal int-cests or family
events, The agent 15 also taught s*lection of plausible but not
genuine return addresses for his outgeing communications,

Tc

Agents who are to learn ccdes and ciphers and radio transmission
and reception are trained by th- ST Section, which has its own
radio transmitter for instruction purposes, The radios the
agents use in training are precured in their own countries and

by the ST Section; most such
equipment is Western-made, ard much of it is American, The agent
learns transmission and reception and also is taught how to adjust
a commercial radio to his andividual requirements and how to make
minor repairs on it, H- may learn the standard Morse code but
usually is taught a numerical code arranged in groups. As with
secret writing, the case cfficer knows little about the actual
mechanics of the radic communications arrang-ments because radio
messages are processed cutsidt the operational departments and
reach him only in the ferm of clear text, and because compart-
mentation keeps him from acquiring vechnical knowledge. i
Similarly, he knows little abcut the proficiency required of the
agent and sees only the finai evaluation report prepared by the
ST Section for the agent's personal file.

If the agent is also to receive training in microfilm and micro-
dot techniques, the ST Section arranges with the LF Section
(Photographic Laboratory ~ Laboratorio Fotografico) of the MI
Department for the use of equipment and the asSignment of a
system and then itself gives the training. The LF Section has

all the necessary equipment. Only a few selected agents are
given such instruction. One clandestine agent in the Dominican
Republic, who spent a considerable time.in Cuba and was extremely
well trained, was provided microfilm and microdot equipment for
preparing and-developing messages, but his case is exceptional,
He was also taught how to make devices for transmitting microfilm
and microdot material securely, The preparation of concealment
devices and instruction tn their use are handled by another
section of the MI- Department, the EMB Section (Concealment Devices
Section - Seccion Embutidos), which also prepares for the agent
any devices he will need for carrying materials or codes back to

his own country when‘he returns,

Final Briefings

27.

28,

When guerrilla. agents have completed their training, the LN
Department case officer-bricfs the group on its mission in its
home area, which is usually support of local revolutionary
activities; The briefing includes assignment of tasks, explana-
tion of what support the group may expect and how it 18 to be

-Suppliog, directions for reporting to the sponsoring group,

advice cn security and self-protection, and the travel route to
be followed, In addition, the group leader receives a special
briefing on means of communication with DGI headquarters, special
arrangements for supplying the group or its sponsoring organiza-
tion, and perhaps the transportation to its home area of propa-
ganda or sabotage materials from Cuba, Although agents are
allowed to take notes during their training, they are not permitted
to carry any compromising material on their return home, All
final instructions are given orally and are memorized by the
agent. Actually, however, guerrilla agents do not always observe
security precautions about materials, One Salvadorian guerrilla
agent succeeded in hiding in his luggage a copy of the Manual of
Guerrilla Warfare he had used in his training course, even though
the case officer inspected the luggage while it was being packed,
Tho case officer commented that unless another inspection was
made at the time the agent left his quarters to depart the
country or at the airport just before boarding the plane, it was
impossible to prevent agents from carrying off such classified

matter,

Illegal agents receive a more intensive final briefing. The case
officer reviews with the agent the general mission and specific
tasks ho'is to undertake, all of which have been covered during
training, such as collection of information én his home govern-
ment or specific organizations, penetration of cfficial organs in
the country or perhaps the local Communist Party or a leftist
group, assistance in communications and forwarding of material,
etc, The briefing includes advice on security and self-protection,
refresher instruction on accommodation addresses for secret | _
writing correspondence, an explanation of the travel route for the
return journey and the documents to be used, and specific instruc-
tions for reporting to a group or commencing his assignment after
arrival, with a schedule for initiating communications, depending
on his mission and his return ttinerary, Illegal agents receive
their final instruction on communications two or three days be-
fore leaving Cuba, Instructions about frequencies, which are
assigned by the MI Department, and codes for radio communication,
procurement and preparation of secret writing materials, etc., are
Photographed and prepared for the agent to carry with him in a
concealment device, One agent returning to Salvador received his

radiv frequency data on film, which was rolled ard put into a

falss heel on one shoe, prepared by the EMB Sects: Agents who
are to use radios do not take sets with then; the DGI prefers to
have then purchase their communications equipment in their own
country: and provides money for the purpose; the radios are thus
not attributable to Cuba, The agent usually carries with him the
funds needed for procurement of small equipment and may occasion-
ally act aS a courier carrying special messages or funds, Normally,
however, large sums for the purchase of large eqeipment or arms
for guerrilla operations are sent by diplomatic pouch or are ¢
carried by clandestine couriers, In Septenber 12 for example,
the DG! sent U.S,.S$25,000 concealed in the lining of a suitcase
carried to Mexico by a diplomatic courier; there it was turned
over to an agent for the purchase of arms to support revolutionary
activity in Nicaragua.

If agents are not able -to-leave Cuba at once when they have com-
pleted their training, they remain under the orders of the school
if they are guerrillas, or cf their case officer if they are

illegal agents. They are permitted to travel in Cuba or are
assigned to public “voluntary” campaigns; the case officers try

to keep them busy, partly, at least, as a security precaution, ’
Delays in departure may be due to lack of suitable documentation,
difficulties in arranging air schedules, special situations in

the home country, or physical disability of the agent--one agent
broke his leg while in Cuba and had to wait until he was able to

travel,

The principal cause of delay in returning home is lack of suit-
able documents, The DGI case officer is responsidle for procur-
iag passports for his agents' travel, but he is often short one
or two passports of the proper nationality, because procurement
requires a longer time than the usual training pericd, For
example, of a group of abcut 25 guerrilla agents from the
Dominican Republic who completed six months of tra:ning near the
end of 1963, about ten e still in Cuba in April 1964 because
the DGI had been unable either ro provide passports for their
travel or to arrange for their return hom? illegaily. at that
time the case officer was trying to have additional passports
collected and sent to Cuba via the DGI station in Mexico so that
tae stranded Dominicans could travel,

Return Travel

31.

As noted abeve, while his training is in progress, arrangements
are made to return the agent to his operational area, For
guerrilla agents, this iS their own country and sponsoring group;
for illegal agents normally 1t is their own country, but occasion-
ally, although rarely, one 18 assigned to another area. Guerrilla
agents who have been trained together may travel back as a group;
illegal agents always travel alone, -Al]l agents start their
journey by air to Prague, on Cubana Airlines, usizz false Cuban
passports, which they turn over to Czechoslovak auttorities on
their arrival in Prague.® From there, agents travel on passports
of their own or some related nationality, or even tzeir own pass-~
ports, containing entries carefully made to accouat for their
period of absence from their country without show any connec-
tion with Cuba, Both passports are provided the acest by the case
officer at the time of the final briefing, when the travel route.

The second stage of the journey, from Prague to ‘the agent's own
country, is arranged by the DGI Central Processing Section. The
agent's departure from Cuba and the first leg of the trip, to’
Prague, are arranged by ICAP, where the DGI has a liaison
officer, pseudonym “Ricardo”, to handle such matters. When
guerrilla, agents are preparing to depart, the case officer
notifies “Ricardo”, personally, by telephone, or by-official docu-
ment; and allocates the funds they will need during the rest of
their stay in Cuba and for.their travel. The case officer in-
structs the agents to go to ICAP and establish contact with
"Ricardo", who thereafter ‘is responsible for them as long as they
remain in the country. If they are delayed, he arranges for
travel in Cuba, and in any case he provides them subsistence and
pocket money, -He also, through ICAP, procures their required
immunizations; an ICAP request for vaccination for a traveler is
an indication that the person is of interest to the Cuban intel-
ligence services, since the ordinary departing visitor or resident
secures his immunization through normal civilian channels, i
"Ricardo" also obtains airline tickets and flight reservations;
the DGI reimburses ICAP for any funds expended by “Ricardo” for
agent travel and handling, ’

The processing of illegal agents is somexhat different from that
of guerrillas, They do not go through ICAP or come into “Ricardo's"
hands; the case officer, working through the DGI Central Process-
ing Section, takes care of procuring their immunizations, plane
tickets, and reservations, They are thus not exposed to any
Cuban agency outside of the DGI, The agent travels vin Prague to
Western Europe and thence to his own country, At the final stage
of his journey, he may enter his own country tllegally. As soon
as he is back and established, he is ready to initiate communica-
tions with DGI headquarters in accordance with the instructions
he has received and using the schedule he carried with him ina
concealment device, which is opened only when he reaches home,

A Cuban sent abroad as a DGI agent is considered an illegal agent
and does not go through ICAP processing for travel, He may leave
Cuba illegally: if he departs legally, he uses the normal route
via Prague but travels on a passport of another nationality than
Cuban, Of three known Cuban agents prepared for assignment
abroad, one was scheduled to go to Mexico during 1964; the assign-
ments of the other two were not known, A Cuban agent abroad
uses the same sort of communications channels as an agent of
another nationality, according to the training he has received in
Cuba, He is reimbursed through the usual channels--funds sent
through a DGI field station, which for Latin America is always
Mexico; and in addition his family is supported by the DGI during
his entire period of overseas service, An agent of foreign
nationality, once trained, is not expected to return to Cuba and
is considered an independent operator with no communication with
Cubans except through his clandestine channels, although in an
emergency he is permitted to appeal ‘to a DGI officer in an
official establishment if one is available, The policy regarding
agents of Cuban nationality had not been decided in early 1964,
since no such illegal agents were then operating abroad, It was
not certain, for example, how long the Cuban was expected to
remain in place abroad nor whether he would be allowed access to

DGI officers in the field,

From 1959 to 1962 the Cuban foreign-intelligence service made
considerable use of shipping for sending its agents out of Cuba,

ican area and to the north coast

of South America. Since 1962; however, the practice of sending
agents home as crewmen has materially declined and in 1964 was

used only occasionally,

Effectiveness of Training

36, The capabilities of both guerrilla-and tllegal agents trained by
the DGI vary greatly because of differences in background, native
capacity, and adjustment to discipline, The DGI has successfully
trained a few highly efficient agents, but some of its trainees

have not come up to expectations,

One agent with an excellent

training record, of whom the case officer had high hopes, was
arrested for participation in illegal activities after only a
short period of operation following his return home, Several
agents who were considered promising proved disappointing when
released from training supervision; one who was given funds to
purchase a radio spent the money on himst1f and was in trouble
with the group with which he was affiliated because of his lack
of discipline; another was accused of having misused funds en-
trusted to him for arms procurement and was also distrusted by
his group as cowardly and spiritless, As noted above, instruc-
tion in secret writing has not always been productive of readable

reports,

The main difficulty appeors to lio not with the quality

of the training but with thy lack of discipline and loyalty of
the trained agent.

For a discussion cf the organization of the DGI and the
functions of its departmists, from the same source, see

Cuba has diplonatic relations, and hence consulates, in
Latin America only in Mexico and Jamaica (relations were
maintained with Brazil until May 1964, with Chile until
July 1964, with Bolivia until August 1964, and with
Uruguay until September 1964). Visas for Cuba can be
obtained only in those countries; most are issued in
Mexico, because that country has the only direct air
connection with Cuba,

Cuban handling of visas and documentation is discussed
at length by the same source in CS-311/00866-64,

During 1963, many travelers from Latin America were
taken to Cuba on chartered fiights by Cuban aircraft
arranged to bring delegations to and from Cuba for Cuban
celebrations and for the convention of the International
Union of Architects in Havana in September. For the
latter occasion, the Soviet. ship NADEZHDA KRUPSKAYA
called at Santos, Brazil, to embark passengers for, “!
Havana, Among the traveling delegations were Cuban
agents,
