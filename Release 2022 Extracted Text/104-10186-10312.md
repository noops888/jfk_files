Introduction

The Cuban

foreigr Intelligence service, the General Directorate of

Intelligerce (Direccion General de Inteligencia - DGI), in dis-

charging 1ls functior of protecting Cuban interests and security

and promosing see pollgass of the Cuban Government, employs agents

of many nationalities.

Although its activities extend to Europe

and Africa, its principal agent strength is in Latin America.

Agents have ir general tuo types of assignments:

collection of

local government and the local situation, and

promorion of revolutiorary activity, including guerrilla warfare.

Ali bit agents abroid ars therefore divided into two basic cate-

gories according to suriction:

intelligence agents charged

collection of erformation

and penetration of local governments and

organirat1ons, who are truly clandestine, 1.e.,

are not known in

ecuntries as Cuban agents; and

guerrilla warfare and

charged with directing and supporting revolution-

aty activities,

who are often known as Cuban agents to the local

Communist and leftist groups with which they work.

The tho types

of agents

the Cuban internal security service, the

Departnent of State Security (Papartamento de Seguridad del

He was a trained parachutist

at the time of his recruitment.

Guzman and

"Chino" (name unknoon), were recruited because they

Gonzalez.

One criterion for recruitment is that the agent shall

not have a wide circle of acquaintance.

(Institute Cubano del Amistad con los Pueblos - ICAP), which

arranges for their travel to cuba;

their homes or other destinations.

The DGI has an arrangement

with ICAP under which members of the DGI MO Department

Since there are no official Cuban missions in Central

America,

the agent nogmally makes his way to Mexico and obtains

his Cuban visa there.

In order to keep secret from the author-

candidate gives another destination,

paper instead of stamping it in his passport.

They are integrated

usual aptitude and ability, he comes under consideration as a

If a traince is assessed as

he is removed from the

officer's home.

A foreign agent candidate arriving in Cuba is first debriefed by

the case officer on his background and qualifications,

to that time the OGI has only advance notice of his selection and

know's little about him.

The interview is recorded, but without

the trainee's knowledge.

On une occasion in early 1964 a case

officer arranged to meet a now trainee in a Mavana restaurant for

the preliminary intervies.

The case officer provided himself with.

a pocket tape recorder, which he tested in adance and found was

in good order. When he started to record the interview, however,

he discovered that he had cither forgotten to adjust the mechan-

1sm after he had tested it, or he pushed the playback instead of

the record button: the restaurent was suddenly electrified by a

voice saying:

"Testing, one, two, three: testing, one, two,

lodged; in this case, of course,

the agent sas aware that it was

being recorded.

the interview are entered in

biographical questionnaire covering all aspects of the agent's

family situation,

political vliws, background and education,

employment experience, connections, and intelligence potentinl;

the document forms the basis of the agont's DGl porsonal file.

In addition, the agent is required to write i complete report on

the operational situation in his country: ircluding types and

styles of dress, eating habits, working hours and holldays,

location of public buildings and places of cntertainment, the

press aid its type and circulation,

urban and rural transporta-

In cases where an intelligence agont is selected from among

guerrilla traindes, he may romail ulider the

for his training as an illegal abint also.

Training for intel-

ligence work,

however, is almays sapadle for guerrilla training

and is not revealed so the Communist Party or leftist group

sponsoring the agent, who becomes, in effect, a semi-overt Cuban

agent in guerrilla activities and

a clandestine agent in Intel-

One such agent, trained in

Cuba in 1963, was returned to the Dominican Republic about mid-

works as an illegal

agent (under the LN Depariment), without the knowledge of his MED

collcagues, as a penetration of the MPD.

The case officer from the Illegal Department arranges for the. com-

he will require for his furure mission.

The briefing includes assignment of tasks, explana-

tion of what support the group may expect and how it is to be

supplied, directions for reporting to the sponsoring group,

advice on security and self-protection, and the travel route to

be followed.

In addition, the group

arrangements for supplying the group or i's sponsoring organiza-

tion, and perhaps the transportation

allowed to take notes during their training, they are not permitted

final instructions are given orally and are memorized by the

agent.

Actually, however, guerrilla agents do not always observe

security precautions

about materials.

One Salvadorian guerrilla

agent succeeded in hiding in his luggage a copy of the Manual of

Guerrilla Warfare he had used in his training course, even though

the case officer inspected the luggage while it was being packed.

Tho case officer commented that unless another inspection was

made at the time the agent left his quarters to depart the

country or at the airport just before boarding the plane,

it was

impossible to prevent agents from carrying off such classified

matter.

Illegal agents receive a more intensive final briefing. The case

officer reviews with the agent the general mission and

tasks ho is to undertake,

all of which have been covered during

training, such as collection of information on his home govern-

ment or specific organizations, penetration of official organs in

the country or perhaps the local Communist Party or a leftist:

The case officer in-

"Ricardo", who thereafter is responsible for them as long as they

remain in the country.

If they are delajed, he arranges for

travel in Cuba, and in any case he provides

them subsistence and

pocket money. He also, through ICAP, procures their required

immunizations; an ICAP request for vaccination for a traveler is

an indication

that the person is of interest to the Cuban intel-

ligence services, since the ordinary departing visitor or resident

secures his immunization through normal civilian channels.

"Ricardo" also obtains airline tickets and flight reservations;

Since

however,

the practice of sending

agents home as crewmen has

materially declined and in 1964 was

used only occasionally.

Effectiveness of Training

36.

The capabilities of both guerrilla and tilegal agents trained by

the DGI vary greatly because of differences in background,

native

capacity, and adjustaent to discipline.

The DGI has successfully

trained a few highly efficient agents,

but some of its trainees

have not come up to expectations.

One agent with an excellent

training record, of whom the case officer had high hopes, was

arrested for participation in illegal activities after only a

short period

of operation following his return home.

Several

agents

who were considered promising proved disappointing when

released from

training supervision; one who was given funds to

purchase a radio spent the morey on himself and was in trouble

with the group with which ho was affillated because of his lack

of discipline; another was accused of having misused funds en-

trusted to him for arms procur ment and was also distrusted by

his group as cowardly and spiritless.

As noted above, instruc-.

tion in secret writing has not always been productive of readable

reports.

The main difficully appears to lie not with the quality

of the training but with thy lack of discipline and loyalty of

the trained agent.
