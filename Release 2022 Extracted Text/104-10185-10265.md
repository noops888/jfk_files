On’Sunday (1000), 5 Aug 62, LITAMIL-9 called

te report the “paper” was ready and he would dike to see me, A mtg

was set fa 1830 at his apartment. WO SECURITY PROBLEMS NOTER.
L-9 provided the paper re Mexican supporters

CASTRO regime (copy attached), He asked that I be careful not to use

material in paper as this would put hin "on spot”,
Re requirements in DIR A75SOS, L-9 reported as

follows:
In asmuch as Ranon SINOBAS Casado, Cuban First Sec,

handles all matters with Foreign Office, ip difficult for him get’ any
info re high level Gov't fedling either for or against, He said that
one thing was clear and that the fact that the Mexican Government was
confiscating propaganda at the airport, In additim, he said thst: on
3 Aug at the airport ,. Salavador DE LA TORS Callejas, Cuban professor,
showed him a letter which was signed by Raul ROA and addressed to the
Mexican Arb in Brazil requesting that DS LA TORRE begiven a Mexican
visa. The Mexican Amb refused to honor RAS request and DE la TORRE
came, into Mexico without a visa, DE LA TORRE was furious, of course,

but I-9 was woke to arrange his departure for Havana without ary trouble.

- L-9 said that about 8 menths ago Pres, LOPEZ Mateos told Elvira VARGAS,

Mexico
Communist newspaperwomen that as long as he was President, EXK& ‘would

not break welaticna with Cuba, L°9 seid that Taresa PROENZA told bim

aN this, L9 added that the Embassy officials believe that LOPEZ is °

Pid

friendly with the regime and have €onfidence in him on this score,
When asked about Mexien Gov't omtacts L-9 said that LOPEZ was one
theargh Elvira VARGAS, L.9 said that theonly Mexican Gov't offictal

sees .Bohool “in Cuba. He said that he did hot attend and therefore had

no knowledge. of the situation concerning young diplomats,

Le9 said that he Knows nothing about any changes in
the. Foreign Office, He said that “When “he. was in Caoa the last ‘time,he
hoard that Faus CHABMONT was 1ét trusted by the Cuban Gov'g, in fact,
they talked about a possible defection innis mse, 9 believes that

he was recalled because.of this mistrust.

Tuesday,d did not have the other requirements in mind and so I had to
leave them until enother tine, ;

L.g provided fol info re Cuban Embassy dips and con~
tacts: :

is dying of cancer, L-9 said that she is the “nbassg's

AntonloM@ARCI Lara - L-9 said that GARCIA returaed from Cuba and waa
very enthusiastic, GARCKA told L_9 that he had gone to Santiagode Yuba for
the 26 of July celebration by plane,

that the U.S, should not overlook this mm, a friend of his. It is L-9's ~
opinion that although AZCUE an 6xtreme leftist he 1s not sympathetic,

at least ostensibly, with the Soviet cuuse, L-9 said thet recently

AzcvE defended the U.S, position WK ine dtscussion with Ana Marte
BLANCO, Ambassadérial gecretary. L-9 sd d that AZCUE 1s a very intell-

Ana Marta BLANCO

L.9 said that BLANCO brags about being a member of
Antonio MELLA group in Cuda. He considegs her an out snd out Gomnuhist.
When queried re security precaubicns in tne “mbassy, L-9 satd that ro-
cently BLANCO told him that the XA#M ribbon in her new electric type-
watter was made of paper and that it was mcessary because the printing
3602 remaina on the ribbon and this would be serious seourlty problem,

“ Apparently the ribbon is burned daily. The typewriter is from Bast

‘ H i that she was very anxious to stay with Prof. DE LA TORRE citedpreviously.

L-9 does not know BOCANEGRA but by description XXKXXS given the per-

apera in Mexico “ity.

tact with LITAIN-2 and AMSTET=1 - Bota mn suspect ber of being @2) _

BOCANEGRA is a Mexican,

Ranod GINOBAS Casaso ~ L_9 dislikes SINOBAS intensely. He considers
: him to be aman with 1itt@a on the ball but trying his best to play
: the big shot by “taking over” all important contatts ( Foreign Office
Ls personality
and Cuban bigwigs), L'9 sald that he has no KXtXXXsIIEKY¥to speak of |
and no freidns inthe “mbassy. AZCUE 1s particularly snti-SINUBAS,
‘calling him a member of the "nueva aasta”, 1.0. he's in tn select
group of Fidelistas who look down theri nosea at enyone who not “thin
this

MESK particuker group. L-9 said that wife is of the same 11k,

L-9.said that CUBEGA and hiswife continue to act very
¥reidnly to him and that LECHUSA’ also has shown more warmth in recent
days} L_9 4s in an inter- sting position because of his sister-in-
law » Comoha FERNANDEZ, Because of this relatios hip, L-9 believes that
many in the Entassy fens bim to a certain extent, respecting his in-
Tluence in the Cuban Seorprent. LECHUGA, who wantedytq higgave all his
wen pe>2ple in Mexico, waa not happy with L.9's reassignrent to Mexico but
possibly this problem fa not worht worrying about sny MAAXKXA more and
LECHUGA 1s befriending L-9 at this point.



Mexico as the Charge D'atfatres,. but. that Terésa PROENZA told & LECHUGA

_/'when she hoard this thiat she would leave the “mtassy if DAVID cane to

take over. Charge Job, 9 believes ‘that LECHUGA listened to PROENZA

and fearing that he might lose her, decided to hold off on DAVID, L-9

XHAMIE XSEHX said that PROENZA is a good friend of Juan MARINELLO and

that XXXOODINEX is is possible that PROENZA would leave Mexico to wook

for him in Cuba, As roted preivously, L.9 respects PROENZA greatly

and feels that LECHUGA would be making a mistake if he lets her get

away. L=9 said that PROENZA believes that she should be given Charge's

fob if anybody 18 to get it,

Le9 aaid that Maria ASOW “SOLO was at the Cuban Embassy on

—_—___—. .

the 26 of July- celebration.

L-9 gave me a copy of the book Antologia de los Novelistas

Cubanos on this date, At the previous mtg I told L-9 tiat £ would very

much like to have a copy of this book which I saw in his library, He |

said he would try and get me a copy, wnich he did, The book was pube

lished at the Imprenta Nacional in 1960, EXxXXXEXGX

I drove La9 to Kft Avenida Avila Camacho, where he was
the

going to join the family CUEVAS, fnu for dinner, He said that /CUEVAS

family, a very wealthy Mexican family, was very close to nim, in fact,

he said they aro probably his best friends, It is believed that G¥se Luis
=

Xewvas, a leftist painter, 1s a MMi member of this family.
=~

ALthough I tried to get L-9 to make a future mtg date, he

refused saying he wanted to rest up after his latest ordeal, i.s. getting

list of Mexican supporters,

but he didn't even accept this, He

I suggested that be call me in about a week
