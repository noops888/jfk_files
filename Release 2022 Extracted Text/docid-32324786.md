ARCADIA,

and their sentence.

grew out of another raid in which ARCADIA was apprehended, which raid

occurred on April 9, 1946, at 5114 Penn aveme, Pitusourgh. However,

ARCADIA was acquitted on

this charge after he and PERRINI both testified

that ARCADIA had taken a lease on the premises only to

accommodate PERRINI.

On November 4 and December 10, 1946, Confidential Informant

ANTHONY SCARIOITA advised Special Agent THOMAS A. MeQUAIDE that MILION JAFF™

and "OLD Nin" TARR, both of whom are mentioned on Page 50 of the report

subnitted October 15, 1946, are presently engaged as connission brokers with

offives in downtown Pittsburgh. They are in constant communication with

FROY NATHAN, a big time gambler who has his headquarters in the Willian Penn

Hotel. The value of this allignment is that upon information furnished by

JAPTE and FAREAR as to betting trends, NATHAN is able to make many coups.

The informant further advised that SAM MANNARINO, WILLIE SAM; and ART ROONEY,

who are mentioned on Pages 20, 21, 22, 43, 49, and 50 of the report submitted

October 15, 1946,

have all achieved the financial status of millionaires as

a result of their racket activities.

MANNARINO and SAM are located in New

Kensington, Pennsylvania, and ARI ROONY 13 located on the North Side, Pitte

burgh, Pennsylvania. The informant further advised that NAIE IBFT, Who 18

included in a group picture which, according to Confidential Informant JOE

GUS GANNI, 18 presently engaged in a legitimate enterprise, namely a gold

from Gallatin, Pennsylvania, and, FRANK VALUVII, Pittsburgh racketeer.

Pennsylvania.

Agent IMPORE then made discreet inquiries and determined that

TOMMY, HARRISON Of McKees Rocks had a large number of slot nachines in various

restaurants, bar rooms, etc. in the McKèes Rocks district.

HARRISON is the

same individual who is presently out on bail, being charged with receiving stolen

property by Sheriff WALTER C. MONAGHAN, which consisted of cigarettes stolen

from the N. Rice Cigar Company, which cigarettes were used in the cigarette

vending machines owned by HARRISON.

On October 29 and lovember 1, 1946, Sheriff MONAGHAN advised that a

new, swank gambling joint was opened at 5108 fenn avenue, fittsburgh.

owners of this club are BILLY CON; former heavyweight boxing championship con-

tender, his father-in-law, GRUENFIEID JIMMY SMITH, MILION JAFFE, & well-known

gambler and the brother of the owner of the only burlesque show in Pittsburgh,

and. ART ROONY, the owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers professional football tean.

All of the employees in the club were allegealy taken from the Bachelor's Club,

which was formerly

a former partner in the Bachelor's Club; with only some bank and chuck-a-luck

games:

This crew out of a feud between TURNER and SMITH, who are not on speaking

terme

at the, presenti

time

It has been learned recently from Detective JOE

BICKER, who has served as CON's bodyguard, that CON will shortly resume boxing

for financial reasons since cow has gone broke in the horse racing game.

On November 13, 1946, Confidential Informant MAIT CVETIC advised that

HENRY CROWLEY; horse racing news disseminator with Leadquarters in Steubenville,

Ohio,

and RED MYERS,

whose first name was unknown to the informant, are operating

a wire service in Pittsburgh as

a sideline to CROWliY's other activities.

Accord-

ing to the informant, the place in Pittsburgh caters to big bets only, taking

$1,000 as a minimum bet.

In an article appearing in the "Pittsburgh Press" written by feature

writer CHESTER FOITER in January, 1947, POTTER stated that there are at least

5,000 slot achines and other types of mechanized equipment for gambling in Alle-

gheny

Counts, Pennsylvania. He stated that a machine will pay for its own cost

within two or three weeks, after which each machine will avernge a $150 nét

income.

This figure does not include pinball machines, and if the estimate is

near accurate, the Federal Government is being defrauded out of approximately

half a million dollars since such machines require a $100 license.

According to

POrCER's article, the machines are manufactured by a Chicago firm, and by an

unwritten agreement the first $100 revenue therefrom is supposed to go to the

United States, Government for the license.

He stated that the distributing firm

80

## Page 5

for western Pennsylvania "is owned or controlled by two Allegheny County men,

both widely known in political, police and sport circles." Thie undoubtedly

refers to ART ROONEY,

owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers national professional

football team, and BARNEY McGINLEY, his associate in sport enterprises, who

1s also well known politically in Allegheny County.

The article suggested that

the best weapon against the machines, which predominantly appear in clubs having

liquor licenses, is by activities of agents of the State Liquor Control Board,

who do not need warrants to make inspections or corrections in such club premises

Under the regulations governing the issuence of liquor, licenses to clubs, liquor

control agents are duty-bound to cite any club for disciplinary action if

ganbling is found on the premises, which citation could result in the suspension

or revocation of the liquor license issued to such club.

the article went on to

state that under existing federal laws the Collector of Internal Revenue cannot

advise as to the number of $100 licenses issued since receipts from all coin

operated machines are lumped together, and these regulations forbid the Collector

from permitting perusal of the applications for a

license to count the number

relating to slot machines. The article stated that even police, fortified by

court order, are not permitted to see such applications.

In the "Fittsburgh Sun-Telegraph" issue of November 24, 1946, in an

article apparently written by DAVI JONES but bearing no by-line, it is stated

that the big time gambling joints and all other

types of rackets have been booming

in Pittsburgh since January, 1946, with at least a dozen new gambling Joints

opening up in the firet ten months of 1946.

The article also pointed out that

during the same period Pittsburgh witnessed its first three racket slayings in

recent years and witnessed the open return of the old-fashioned slot machines.

On December 10, 1946, Confidential Informant ANIHONY SCARLAIA advised

that former Chief of County Detectives JARPY DEASY, DONMY SIIVERBIATT, the

florist in the William Penn Hotel, and JOHN DUFFY, commonly, known as the "Wheeling

Kid," are operating a high-stake card game on

the seventh floor of the William

Penn Hotel regularly:

The informant also commented on the retirement of BILLY CONN, former

heavyweight boxing chempionship contender, as-follows:

BOB MATES, who is employed

at the Allegheny Sportsmen's Club, mentioned above, was at the training camp with

CONN prior to his bout with JOE LOUIS on June 19, 1946.

On the evening of the

fight, MArIS telephoned from New York to ANIHONY "HOT NOSE" GAUTAND end advised

GARIANO that MILTON JAFFE, who has a percentagé of CONN, had just bet $30,000 on

IOUIS and suggested that the smut money in Pittsburgh get on IQUIS but that no

bets could be placed in New York because all bets had closed.
