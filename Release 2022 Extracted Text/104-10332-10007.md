MEMORANDUM FOR: J. Barry Harrelson @ DA
FROM: Bryant Rogers
‘SUBJECT: MEETING WIT!
REFERENCE:

On 6 Jan we mat with fom the DO to discuss HRG concerns with regard to CIA's contacts in the 60's with well
known Cubans and Cuban Organizations.

‘The outcome of this discussion was that the DO agrees that we can release the names of those major players with whom CIA
worked with as long as we stay within the 60-63 time frame, with some overlap into 1964 for continuity, when needed. We then
discussed our relationships with major anti-Castro organizations. It was agreed that we could release the fact that as a funding vehicle
for. the US Govt, CIA provided support including funding in general terms. In some cases we may find it necessary to reveal gross ballpark
figures for annual budgets. The-00 would prefer that we continue to protect specific funding amounts where possible. They were
specifically concerned about releasing specific amounts paid to individuals or families of Bay of Pigs members where individuals could
claim that one was paid more than another. In supporting thase organizations it was acknowledged by the DO that we could release
generic operational activities such as publishing journals or financing goodwill tours by prominent exile Cubans to Latin America The DO
reminded us that in reviewing these relationships with Cubans and organizations, it was important to protect CIA personnel, agents and —
assets and any specifics on tradecraft.

When asked about Bay of Pigs training sites, Linda felt that the actual location should still be protected in spite of the fact that
they have been mentioned in open literature,

With regard to DO location numbers (19 for Cuba) she thought this was OK for the 60-63 time frame but would check with LA
Div. She had no problem with the release of the Bell location in cables since it was no longer used.

N

During the period since the ARRB last met, the DO “has

considered the four issues listed below that have not yet been
addressed with the Board. These issues appear throughout the JFK
collection and by stating our position up front we hope to
facilitate the Board’s review and to reach an agreement that will
be mutually satisfying to the Board and the Agency.

Cryptonyms ~ Except for cryptonyms related to ~
operational assets or activities involving Mexico or Miami,
the Agency will release the main component of cryptonyms and
withhold only the two-letter digraph.. Treating cryptonyms
in this manner will. protect the nationalities of individuals ©
and operations that are not pertinent to Oswald or the JFK
investigation and chetinenc an easier reading of the written ~
material.

Country File Designators - We will delete the first
element of operational activity and operational interest
files in those instances when the credibility of the :
narrative is not affected. The first element of the file

‘number corresponds to the alphabetical position of the

country name which is easily discernible, whereas the
subsequent two elements relate to type of activity or
interest and specific subject.

Action Indicator (Slug) Lines - Generally, we will

“xelease the entire-action indicator line of a document.

Occasionally, however, we will withhold portions when the

employees cited as serving in a field position. References

Re: ARRB requests for evidence
Dear John: ,

I thought that it might be helpful to you if I were to provide you with our current
assessment of the status of our review of the Agency's assassination records and point
to where we would like to proceed in the future.

I would like to begin by acknowledging the efforts made by the Historical Review
Group to facilitate our review of records. It has been, as you know, a difficult and time-
consuming process both for the Agency and the Review Board. We very much
appreciate the personal cooperation of you and your staff.

We continue to be concemed by the slow progress that has been made. Although we
perceive that the task has been more difficult and time-consuming than Cohgress
anticipated; we+have found that the careful education process in which we have been
involved has helped educate us with respect to your concerns and, we hope, has helped
demonstrate to you the Review Board's concerns.

We must, however, begin to pick up the pace. In many circumstances we are reviewing
and then re-reviewing the same documents over and over again. We are also

frequently put in the position of not being provided with evidence in a timely manner

so that we can make our presentations to the Board. While many of these difficulties

are understandable — and perhaps even inherent to the start-up of the process in which
we are engaged -- we must expedite the process. Rather than dealing with dozens of
records at Board meetings, we need to move towards a schedule where hundreds of
records will be reviewed at Board meetings. From our perspective, it seems that it is
essential that the Agency be prepared to allocate significant additional resources to the ~
process of reviewing the records and making evidence available to the Board.

We also believe that the Agency still is not providing the type of evidence that will be
the most convincing to the Board. Where issues exist that the Board has not yet
addressed, and where the Agency would like to see postponements upheld, specific
information must be provided to support a postponement. General statements, while
useful in identifying the underlying issues involved, do not provide the Board with the
complete knowledge and understanding of the issue that is necessary to make an
informed judgment regarding release of the information.

The Board is looking forward to receiving the CIA’s evidence in support of the
postponement of true names. As you know, we have planned for some time to devote
the Deceniber (12 and 13) meeting to this important issue.

Additionally, you will find enclosed with this letter the next in our series of information
requests, covering boxes 7-9 of the Oswald collection. We are submitting these requests
now in an attempt to give HRG as much advance notice as possible.of which records we
will be reviewing for the January 4 meeting. Evidence for records to be reviewed
January 4 should be provided no later than December 13, 1995.

We hope that during HRG’s review of the January documents, the standards outlined in
this letter will be kept in mind. If at any point an issue is deemed so sensitive that a
briefing is required, ARRB staff will meet with you at your convenience.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

March 20, 1996 CIA HAS NO SEHECTION To
To: -. Review Board oe DOCUMENT
cc: David Marwell

CIA Team
From: T. Jeremy Gi
Subject: Board Guidelines on

‘The Staff understands the Review Board to ‘accept the following general guidelines on
the release of true names of CIA officers:

When the true name of a CIA officer (i.e.. past or present employee of CIA) appears in a
document, the Board will bring to its review a presumption that the true name will be
released. In order to overcome this presumption of release, CIA must provide evidence
demonstrating that release of the name would be harmful. In order to meet its burden
of proving harm, CIA must tailor the evidence to satisfy one of the three categories
identified in Part I (below). However, when the name of an officer is of such
importance that the public interest would not be served in postponing a name, the
Board may release the true name consistent with the principles identified in Part I
(below).

Part I. Categories of Officers.

1. Living afficers. For living (present or former) officers, CLA must prove that:
(a) the officer is living outside the United States (or reasonably is expected to
reside or travel outside the United States in the foreseeable future); (b) the officer
is either working or is retired under cover; attd (c) the officer objects to the
release of his or her true name. If CIA satisfies this burden, the Board
presumptively (see Part II below) will release a pseudonym and postpone the
officer’s true name until the year 2010.

2. Where current status of former officer is unknown. Where CIA has been
unable to contact the former officer because his or her location is unknown, CIA
must present a good faith showing that reasonable attempts have been made to
locate the officer. If the Board is convinced that CIA has made a good faith
showing that it was unable to locate the former officer, the Board will postpone
the true name until June 1, 1997. However, the Board may postpone the true


13-00000

name beyond June 1, 1997, if CIA provides to the Board, prior to May 1, 1997,
additional evidence that satisfies the criteria of either category 1 (above) or
category 3 (below). :

3. Names having effect on current intelligence interests. If CLA believes that
the release of a true name may compromise currently existing intelligence
operations or might otherwise cause an identifiable harm, it must provide
evidence that: (a) the officer currently is engaged in clandestine activities; (b) the
release of the true name would compromise ongoing intelligence operations or
would compromise operations with current intelligence value; (c) the release of
the true-name would reasonably be expected to cause significant harm to a living
person (including family members), or (d) the release of the true name would
cause a significant harm to the national security or the foreign relations of the
United States. If CIA satisfies this burden, the Board presumptively (see Part I
below) will release a pseudonym and postpone the true name until 2010 or until
such other date as CIA reasonably shows to be a date on which the release could
be made without causing harm.

Part II. Names of Officers Who Are Important to the Assassination Story.

The Board presumptively will postpone the release.of names consistent with
categories 1-3 of Part I. However, for certain persons whose names appear ina
context that is important to the assassination story, the Board may nevertheless
vote to release the true name. In all such instances, the Board will notify CLA of
the importance of such a person and provide CIA with the opportunity to
provide additional information in support of postponing the release of the
names. These names shall be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, with due
consideration being given to the importance of the person to the assassination
story and such evidence of harm as CIA may provide.

NOTE FOR:

FROM:
DATE:
SUBJECT: JFK --Central Cover appeal

The General Counsel and | met with the JFK Review Board on Friday and discussed, among other things, how to deal with the potential
public release of the identities of former employees retired under cover. The Board clearly wants to do the right thing here, but they feel

they are not getting enough information to make that decision.

Jeremy Gunn (JFK Board's General Counsel) will soon provided me with some of the Board's suggestions on how to deal with this which |
will pass on to you (including how to deal with Whitten). 1 would at the very least like to be able suggest that we attempt contact again
{either through CIA or the Board) with those retirees who have not yet responded to our letter. Of course; any suggestions you have at
this point will be extremely helpful. My sense is that this issue of protecting retirees is something everyone at CIA will want to appeal
just on the principal of it, but that we should do everything possible to avoid an appeal. [Until we work out an agreement with the Board,
you should continue to prepare that appeal you are drafting]

In the meantime, can you please provided me the following figures:

1. The # of people we sent letters to regarding the potential Board releases. {isn't it 150?) and the following breakdown if
available: ,
-# living abroad
- # of those retired under cover vs. those whose cover has been rolled back or lifted
- # of those who still work for us in covert/overt capacity
2. The # of responses we recived to date.
‘3. The # of responses to date requesting that we don't release.
4, The # of responses to date saying that they didn't care.

realize you are all out of the office these days, but | would appreciate getting this as soon as you can. Thanks.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief Historical Review Group

FROM: Fredrick C. Wickham, Jr.
DO, Focal Point for ARRB

SUBJECT: Proposal for Dealing with Employees' Names

1. Cover mechanisms are an integral part of conducting
clandestine operations. We are concerned about individuals that
continue to.be dependent on particular cover legends and on the
organizations. that. cooperatively work with us to provide those
cover legends. The following proposal is offered to streamline
the process of handling names and minimize the potential damage
an inappropriate release could cause.

A. Incomplete and Unidentifiable names:

a. We will release the occurrence of a name when a
common last name appears by itself or in conjunction
with a common first name such that it does not tend
to specifically identify the individual.

b. We will release the occurrence of a name if it
remains unidentified after a reasonable search is
conducted.

B. Identifiable names for employees that retired
overtly:

In most cases, overt employees’ names will be released,
but. in some cases overt employees may have a

portion of their employment remain under cover. Such
cases will require the same review as that of an
employee who remained under cover into retirement.

ADMINTS PRAPLVE..<_T NTRBNDI_Ucr nny


SUBJECT: Proposal for Dealing with Employees' Names

C. Identifiable names for employees that retired
covertly:

a. We will make a reasonable attempt to locate a
current address and contact the person. If the person
objects to the release of his or her name for reasons

“associated with current life style issues, we will
object to the release of the name. If the person does
not have objections based upon personal circumstances we
will review the name for organizational issues ;-- (See
ede Cc. c.) ce 3

b. If reasonable efforts fail to locate the
current address, but it can. be determined that the
individual is still receiving a pension, insurance or
other benefit based upon:cover legend, we will need to
continue to protect the name since source of income or
benefits can not be altered without prior notification
to the individual. If we fail to identify a pension or
other active benefit, we will review the name for
organizational issues. (See para C. c.)

c. We will make a. reasonable attempt. to review the
name to look for identifiable harm to. the person's
safety, family, ongoing operational activities, national
security. or foreign relations. Assuming that none of
the previous concerns are identified, we will review the
potential damage to the cover mechanism or cover
provider by the specific occurrence of. the name if
released.

“2. Because families of deceased employees could be the
beneficiary of pensions or insurance provided under the employees
cover legend, we must review them the same as we would the
employee. We also have second and third generation officers
following in the footsteps of their parents that could be
negatively impacted by the revelation.

3. Our efforts to locate current addresses will include. all
internal record systems maintained by Office of Personnel
Security, Retirement Branch and Insurance Branch. We will
include a checklist reflecting completion of these searches

within the documentation when requesting continued protection of
the name.

4. We considered options of contacting IRS or OPM during
our attempts to locate current addressing information, but based
upon the_fact that these offices would be unwitting of the cover
arrangement for the individual, it was determined to be an
unreasonable risk to the cover of oe officers.

CIA SPECIAL COLLECTIONS
RELEASE IN FULL :
2000

11 February 1997 .
MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
FROM: Gary M. Breneman, IC
SUBJECT: Comparison of ARRB and DO Memoranda re
Treatment. of CIA Officer Names in JFK
Collection

1. This memorandum is in response to an assignment to
compare a 20. March 1996 ARRB memorandum written by T. Jeremy
Gunn and The Directorate of Operations response ‘dated: 20
July 1966, authored by Fredrick C. Wickham, Jr. Both deal
with the treatment of CIA officer true names which appear in
the JFK collection -- when they will be postponed and when
they Will be released.

2. First the ARRB Memorandum. Gunn describes in legal
terms the Board's position on the postponement or release of
CIA officers' true names. He makes a proffer which states
that there is’a presumption in £avor of release akin to a
legal evidentuary iule which causes a burden ‘to shiflt to the
other Party (CIA) to prove something. In this instance, it
is factual evidence/proof sufficient to shift..the burden not

only back to neutral but to the other side of neutral which

permits postponement .

_“°3. The Gunn memorandum then sets out the criteria

required to meet the burden under several situations.


13-00000

A. For officers who are still alive he states that the

proofs required to postpone release of a name are three in

number and all three must be met:

ii. The officer is either working ... (presumably
a current staff officer, contract employee,

or independent contractor) ... or is retired

iii. The officer objects to the release of his or

COMMENT: Mr. Gunn's criteria are a little confusing

and reach beyond the Board's authority.. First, note again

that! the three elements are joined by an # AND meahing all
ae

ae)
elements must be met to satisfy a postponement. Second, the
first requirement of living or traveling outside of the U.S.
is not tied to % cover. Many officers who do not work

under cover all of the time are, in fact, provided cover

for.overseas TDY's. Thus, any officer who might

% reasonably' be expected to travel outside of the U.S.

would warrant postponement of his true name. This would


13-00000

seem to include every CIA employee, contract employee and
independent contractor past and present.

With respect to the third element, Mr. Gunn and the
Board are simply in error. To my knowledge they have no ,
authority to require that an individual be consulted
concerning his or her wishes to maintain cover, thus having

his or her true name postponed, or to give up his cover,

_thus having the name released. This decision does not lie

in.the first instance with the individual but is an
institutional decision which lies solely within the purview
of the Agency and the executive branch of the government.
CIA as an executive agency charged with the creation,
maintenance, and dissolution of cover mechanisms is the only
entity competent to make such a decision. It alone knows if
release of an officer's true name will compromise an
existing cover mechanism which will, in turn, expose others
who share or have shared the same cover. It alone knows if

release ‘of an officer's name will expose CIA sponsorship. (a

Lae *
ity) of*a sensitive activity. It alone knows if

release of an officer's name will violate a promise of

“confidentiality to a commercial cover sponsor which could

gause both embarrassment and possibly, financial hardship to

the: sponsor and, in turn, substantially hinder the Agency's

: &
ability to secure subsequent commercial cover sponsors.

- :
“Turning next to the wishes of a particular officer
(either current or retired) vis a vis staying with his or

her cover, these thoughts come to mind. For current


13-00000

employees, the decision is again not entirely theirs. If,
after careful review, the Agency does not have a strong
position on the employee maintaining the cover, the officer
should be permitted to decide. He or she should be
counseled however, that an action to remove cover could have
an adverse impact on future assignments or TDYs. With
respect to retirees, if, after careful review, the Agency
does not object to the removal from cover, the individual
should be permitted to decide. Note, that the responses to
this inquiry will be mixed. As a historical note, the
Agency over the years has been on an ever~-swinging pendulum
with respect to # cover into retirement ,% % cover for
life,# etc. There will be officers who petitioned hard
unsuccessfully to have their cover removed when they retired
and will gladly consent to lifting the cover. .There will be

those. officers who do not want their cover lifted under any

_ gircumstance.

By way of summary, it is CIA not the Board and not the

sidual offitéer who makes the initial decision concerning

the: maintenance or lifting of cover.

ny B. Former officers, status unknown. While the

heading to this section would seem to suggest the CIA does
not=know the cover/non-cover status of some of its former
officers, the section does not rally deal with this issue.
Rather, within the section, Mr. Gunn simply recognizes the
fact the CIA may not be able to find all of its former

officers to ask if they want to be opened up or remain under

a *®


13-00000

cover. The test required by Mr. Gunn to satisfy the Board
and thus continue postponement until 1 June of this year is
a % good faith showing that reasonable attempts were made
to locate the officer and failed. '

The section contains the additional provision which
advises the Board may continue a postponement beyond 1 June
of this year (i.e., until 2010) if the CIA provides the

board with evidence which satisfies the criteria of either

category 1 or category 3. Such # additional evidence$ must

be provided by 1-May 1977.

The requirements or tests of this section for the
Agency are not onerous but should be set-out as a series of
uniform actions or check-off's taken in the attempt to
locate each $ current status unknown officer. The record
of these actions could then be presented to the ARRB in
support of a request for continued to postponement. The DO
Memorandum mentions of the possibility of asking the IRS or
the OPM for assistance in this regard and. this should
probably, be done: I recall however, that thé Service will
assist, “through cleared contacts at the National Office, but
only to the extent of determining the whereabouts of the
individual and then contacting him and ask that he be in
touch with his former employer. I have no current knowledge
of cleared: contacts at the OPM but they existed in the past
and os assume they continue.

Cc. Names having effect on current intelligence

interests. The Gunn letter appears to subscribe a higher
»
t


13-00000

level of concern to this section and its criteria than the
previous two, not recognizing the plain fact that the
criteria of all three sections are inextricable. It sets
out four separate criteria which, if CIA satisfies its
burden, i.e. provides sufficient evidence to prove any one
of them, will operate to postpone a true name until the year
2010. Note again, the criteria required are four separate
ones, each separated by a comma and between numbers 3 and 4
and “OR.” They are:

i. The officer must be currently engaged in
clandestine activities; OR,

ii. The release of the officer's name. would
compromise ongoing intelligence: operations or operations
with current intelligence value (presumably, the latter

permits a review into the officer's past activities, agent

relationships, and: cover positions) 7 OR;

The release of. the. officer's true name’ would
zeagonably be expected to” “cause gnificant harm to la living
gareds” Tacluaing family. members); (read broadly, this
proyision would include, the ind: ividual, former agents,
anyone who shared the same cover ‘or cover position, i.e. a

dediéated- Department of State alot” ‘within an embassy); OR,

iv.. The release of the CEticer: 8 name would cause a
significant harm to the national security or the foreign
relations of the U.S. (a criteria which is broad enough to

drive the proverbial Mack truck through) .


4. In Part II, the Gunn memorandum takes back part of
what it gave in the previous section. It sets up a test of
% importance to the assassination story vs. evidence of
harm.} Essentially, it advises that the Board will weigh
the CIA's evidence but, if within its view, the true name
being considered for postponement is important to the
assassination story, the Board will release it. This means
for those few individuals who may be viewed as $ important
to the story,# truly substantial evidence must be brought.
to bear. Absent such evidence, the Board will release, and
the only recourse left to the Agency would be an appeal to
the President.

5. The Directorate of Operations Memorandum. The

basic concern with the steps for handling names as contained

within the memorandum is as follows. For officers who

retired under cover, the first step will be to contact them

and ask if they want their true name released. Per the

comménts on page three supra, this should be the last step
er eee a :

of the réview, not the first.

A. Other Comments... ‘The resdurces and data bases

‘which will be researched for each name should be clearly

established and followed in a uniform manner. Deviation

| £rom: a set, orderly process will open CIA determinations to

criticism, objections and dismissal, i.e. release of a name
7

security, insurance lists -- consideration might be given
to the Northwest Federal Credit Union, and overt data bases

might not be able from a legal standpoint to provide an

an individual and ask that he be in touch.

universally releasing the true names of overt employees. To
the extent that any current employee, even overt employee,
may be sent overseas on TDY under light cover, the release
of his or her true name via these JFK documents which will
receive widespread review could jeopardize his overseas
mission and possibly, place his life in danger.

we commence to sort out the manner in which we will deal

5 March, 1997

Memorandum For: Chief/HRG 7

From: Barry Harrelson
Subject: Name Issue / Status of Review
Reference: Meetings with ARRB staff (Marwell & Gunn)

4 March 1997

Name Issue

I met with Gunn and Marwell (separate meetings) to
discuss the reopening of the names issue per my memo to you.
Both Gunn and Marwell reacted positively. They found the
proposal to be reasonable one and they are willing to work
with us in approaching the Board. However, both said they
could not predict the Boards reaction. Per Marwell, one
member of the Board (Anna Nelson) seems to believe that if a
person worked for the CIA it should be known.

Apparently our timing is excellent. Marwell is
planning to propose to the Board that they change the
process from the focus on individual postponements to
documénts. Under the new approach his staff would have the
authority to negotiate with the Agency on the release of
documents, and only issues/documents of disagreement would
be placed before the Board. Marwell is convinced that even
with an additional year they will not finish the project
with the current approach. He sees our proposal on the
names as an example of how the process would work.

Marwell recommends that we include examples of
documents containing names of little or no connection to the
story. Bob Skwirot (he was in the meeting with Marwell)
said that there were a number of names that appeared in only
one document and that the number of names had reached{ 590}
Marwell wants to start immediately on preparing a joint € List
of important/releasable individuals.

Action: Advise DO, OGC, upper management of our proposal to
reopen the name issue (how?). Need to decide what level
would sign the memo to the Board, and who would prepare the
memo. If you agree I can send a copy of my memo to you to
nda\ and Fred for background use.

HRG and DO team will collect examples of documents and
prepare (with ARRB staff) a list of individuals. The DO
should focus on any person on the list that needs protection
and prepare the evidence ASAP (i.e. not wait for the issue
to be resolved).

SECRET - WORKING PAPER

New _ARRB Review Process

Marwell and I spent some time discussing how a new
process would work. He would like to test the process for
the April meeting. The following is a rough outline with my
comments:

1) HRG reviewers would review the documents the same
as they do now (postponements would be blue highlighted).
[no change in our procedures]

2) ARRB staff would review the blue highlighted
document .

a) If they agree, they would stamp the document
“ARRB approved” and return it to HRG to process
for NARA.

b) If they disagree they would highlight in
yellow (creating green highlighting). If the two
staffs cannot resolve the issue, then the document
would go before the Board.

[Major change: ARRB staff would no longer record all the
proposed postponements, no DO damage review, no detailed
determination letter requiring HRG reviewers to use the

“grid” to determine what happen.]

3) Non-issue documents would be sent to the ARRB
staff when ready for NARA. At that time the ARRB staff
would prepare a simplified final determination notice and
letter to the Agencies.

[ No action would be required; HRG would file the final
determination notice with the document].

4) “Green” highlighted documents that go to the Board
would be handled the same as today.

[The expectation is that a lot less Getic would require
Board action. ]

Comments: With some fine tuning, I think this process could
work, and we would be able to complete the re-review of
documents released in 1993 and 1994 by Oct. 1998.

Completing the entire project will depend on how quickly the
“non-related” material and the “addition records” are
reviewed by the ARRB staff.

SECRET


SECRET - WORKING PAPER

Pending Issues

As part of the change in process, Marwell wants the
Board to focus on outstanding substantive issues as opposed
to micro managing the review. We discussed the following:

1) Nosenko. ARRB staff needs to review the non-related
material and make a recommendation to the Board. Marwell
leans toward not treating all of Nosenko as assassination
related. Could be a hard sell with some Board members.
Should we request that Nosenko meet with the Board? Marwell
thinks they would react favorably. .

2) Personnel Files. Again the first step is to have
his staff confirm that only a part of a file is related and
that those documents are in the released material.

3) (Gibson. FBI file issue; we need to present case to
the Board ~~

4) (LT 9h Continuing to protect will be a hard sell
given that(Newman has published) identity; we need to present
case to the Board. ~~ :

5) CRC Financial Files. ARRB staff needs to review

Ann Extension

Marwell ask me to draw you attention to the Annual
Report and the request for an extension. He would still
like a letter from the Agency (could be addressed to him)
along these lines: “reviewed Annual Report”

“note that the Board has ask for extension”
“support the request/feel it is in interest of
Agency and public /or something along these lines”

Other issues (not discussed with Marwell/Gunn)

(tina) (OGC) says CI Staff has ask Gunn to rewrite his
notes, and opposes Gunn's suggestion to release pages from

‘the CI histories he reviewed. Gunn indicated in his notes

that some of the pages should be released and might be
considered assassination records. We are going to run into
similar problems with the other histories. Gunn will be in
HQ tomorrow to re-do his notes. She will discuss the “pages
issue” with the goal of having him drop the request to
release. As to the question of designating the pages as
assassination records, she will inform him that CI will
oppose. If he insist, she will refer back to HRG.

Assassination Records Review Board
Guldelines for Review of Postponements in the Segregated Collections
Adopted: April 23, 1997

Background

In order to ensure that the Review Board will be able to complete Its task of reviewing
all identified assassination records, the Board recently took two significant steps. . First,
on November 13, 1996, it adopted guidelines with respect to reviewing “Segregated
Collections” with regard to information that is “not believed relevant” (NBR) to the
assassination. Second, in February 1997, the Review Board requested Congress to
extend its tenure for one additional year.

It is the Review Board’s judgment that, even with the assumption that our operations
may be extended through Fiscal Year 1998, the Review Board cannot hope to complete
review of postponements in the Segregated Collections under the current method of
teview. In particular, a reasonable modification of current postponement standards
would greatly expedite and facilitate the release of additional Information and records.
Otherwise, the Review Board might cease operations without having reviewed: claimed
postponements in tens of thousands of pages of FBI and CIA records.

Postponement Criteria for the Segregated Collections

In a further effort to enhance the Review Board's work, the Review Board now issues
these revised guidelines for the review of records in the Segregated Collections.'

(These guidelines do not affect the FBI's Core and Related Files or the CIA's 201 file on.
Oswald.) The-four principal factors that underlie these review guidelines are: first,
continuing, to the greatest reasonable extent, the Review Board's established

guidelines for postponements that have emerged over the past two years; second,
establishing guidelines.corisistent with the Review Board's decision regarding NBR
records; third, establishing reasonable and workable guidelines that will enable the

‘The regulations adopted by the Board on November 13, 1996, define
“Segregated Collections” as including first, FBI records that were requested by: (a).the
House Select Committee on Assassinations (“HSCA”) in conjunction with its
investigation into the Kennedy assassination; (b) the Church Committee in conjunction
with Its inquiry Into issues related to the Kennedy assassination; and (c) by other bodies
(e.g., Pike Committee, Abzug Committee, etc.) that relate to the Kennedy :
assassination; and second, CIA records including (a) the CIA's Sequestered Collection
of 63 boxes as well as one box of microfilm records and the microfilm records (box 64),
and (b) several boxes of CIA staff “working files.”

Review Board, the ARRB staff, the CIA, and the FBI to complete the significant amount
of work that remains; and finally, to provide reasonably consistent standards for the
review of postponements that would apply equally to CIA-and FBI records.

The following are,.in summary form, guidelines for reviewing postponements In the
Segregated Collections,”

CIA Source and FBI Informant and National Security Asset Postponements

There are, of course, similarities and differences between FBI informants and CIA
sources, Like FBI.informants and national security assets, CIA sources may or may not
be paid for the information that they provide and they may or may not be providers of.
information over the long-term. When providing Information to the Bureau, FBI
informants generally are understood to be cooperating with law enforcement officials for
a legal and legitimate purpose. It is.often the case, although not always, that FBI
informants understand that at some point their name might surface in conjunction with a
criminal prosecution and that they may need to‘testify in court. Foreign CIA sources
and FBI national security assets, however, are not necessarily deemed tobe »
cooperating with law enforcement officials but may, in fact, be committing the crime of
espionage. against their native country by cooperating with US authorities. Furthermore,
unlike FBI informants, CIA sources and FBI national security assets presume that thelr
names will not be released publicly and they certainly presume (in the ordinary course)
that thelr identities will not surface in criminal trials. As a practical matter, it is generally
much easier today for the FBI to locate a former informant who resides in the United
States than it Is for the CIA and FBI to locate former sources and national security
assets.

Despite these differences -- differences which would generally suggest a greater
degree of protection being owed to CIA sources and FBI national security assets -- the
issues in terms of postponements are fundamentally similar.

*The existing “NBR” guidelines allow the Review Board to remove from detailed
consideration those records or files that truly have no apparent relevance to the
assassination, Nevertheless, a significant number of files In the Segregated Collections
contain records that shed some light on Issues that the HSCA explored as potentially
relevant to the assassination of President Kennedy.. The following criteria would apply
to all records In the Segregated Collections, Including records containing some NBR
redactions,

CIA Sources

The Review Board established guidelines, during Its December 1996 meeting, for
handling CIA source issues and applied those guidelines at the January 1997 meeting.
These guidelines directed the protection of names and identifying information of CIA
sources in cases where the identity of the source Is of low public interest or Is peripheral
to the JFK assassination. The Board's decision was based on two factors: the concern
that since CIA sources generally live outside the United States, they could risk harm If
their identities were revealed. Moreover, many of the sources referenced In CIA
records appear infrequently and are of relatively low public interest. Therefore, In
records where the identity of the source Is of importance for understanding the
assassination, the CIA will be required to provide additional evidence to support the
protection of the source's identity.> In cases where the identify of the source is.
peripheral to the assassination story, the information will be postponed until 2017.

FBI Natlonal Security Assets
FBI national security assets should be treated in the same manner as CIA sources.

FBI informants

Informant issues represent the largest category of postponements In the FBI's
Segregated Collection, as they do in the “core” FBi assassination files, They also
provide the greatest opportunity for streamlining the review process. Currently, there
are ten. members of the Bureau’s JFK Task Fores who are responsible for researching
individual informants in response to evidence requests from the Review Board.‘ They
retrieve and review the informants’ files and attempt, through DMV, Social Security, and
other database. searches, to determine if the informant is alive. Under current Review
Board standards for “core” files, this work is necessary to provide evidence to support
redacting the Informant’s name, regardless of whether the informant provided
information. Removing the requirement of proving whether informants are alive in the
Segregated Collections would free up significant reeources that could be deployed to
reviewing unprocessed HSCA subject files.

The new approach to HSCA subjects Is to protect Informant-identifying information,

An example would be the case of John Scelso (pseud.), The Board found that
his identity is relevant to the assassination story and CIA offered evidence of a
continuing need to protect the identity. In this case, “Scelso” documents would
continue to be scheduled for release in five years.

‘Six work full-time on informant evidence, four devote about half their time to
Informant evidence,


13-00000

ay

without requiring the Bureau to make a showing that the informant is alive. This
protection would extend to individuals characterized as symbol-number informants,
"PSls,” “PCls,” “established Sources,” “panel sources,” and the like — designations that
indicate an ongoing relationship with the FBI. It would not extend to individuals who
requested that thelr identity be protected In an isolated contact with the FBI or to local
and state law enforcement officers.

The.“informant-identifying information” to be protected would Include the customary
(ée., informant-specific) portions of informant symbo!.numbers and file numbers,
informant names, and -- at least potentially -- descriptions of, and information received
from, the informant. How much, if any, of the latter type of information should be
redacted would be the principal focus of staff-level discussions with the FBI. The staff's
principal goal in this process, with regard to each informant, would be to release as
much information that is relevant to understanding the assassination as possible. In
discussions with the FBI, the staff would be prepared, if necessary, to concede
redaction of informant-identifying information that is unrelated to the assassination in
order to ensure that more pertinent information is released.>

The presumption will be that an informants identity will be released if the informant
provides “positive” information about an assassination-related Issue. To overcome this
presumption of release for informants with “positive” information, the FBI would need to
make a particularized showing that the identifying information should not be released.
To the extent that an informant's identity is protected, it will be postponed until 2017.

CIA Employee Name Postponements

Over the past year the CIA has addressed the employee name issue and has released
some names that it had previously asked the Board to postpone. But during that time

the list of names has grown to a size that had not been Imagined at the time the work

began. To date, the Review Board staff has identified in the JFK Collection over 650
names of CIA employees. These names appear in more than 1000 documents already
reviewed by the Board and numerous additional records that have not yet been
processed. While some of these employee names are important to the assassination
story, many appear only a few times in the entire JFK Collection and seem to add little,
if any, important information. :

5In HSCA subjects, there typically will not be information about Ruby, Oswald or
the assassination Itself. However, in a file on, for example, Sam Giancana, there may
be informant reports on Giancana’s support of anti-Castro activities, and reports from
the same Informant on day-to-day numbers operations in the Chicago area. The staff
would set a.higher priority on release of the former reports than on the latter.

-5-

CIA's argument to protect employee names emphasizes a number of points... First,
since many employees are “under cover,” the maintenance of that cover is critical to
gathering intelligence. GIA argues that identification of a name can identify the cover
provider and jeopardize operations, Second, although the majority of names are of
tetired CIA employees,.CIA has a confidentiality agreement with them and many do not
want their past Agency affiliation released. The argument here is that release may
jeopardize business relationships or personal safety. Such arguments have already
been presented to the Board. Their merit can only be determined on a case-by-case
basis. However, due to the volume of names in the JFK Collection, the individual
review and evaluation of each case would delay significantly the review of documents
and ultimately lead to less total Information becoming available to the public.

CIA has proposed, and the Review Board agrees, that CIA employee names be treated
in a manner similar to that applied to Source names: to postpone until 2017 those
employee names that are of low public interest or are of peripheral interest to the
assassination. It will be presumed that employee names will be released If their
identities are important to the assassination story unless the CIA Is able to provide
specific information of a potential harm of release. (CIA acknowledges the presumption
of release unless specific evidence Is provided to the Review Board that harm to
Hatalee security or to personal safety would result from the release of the employee
name.

FBI “Foreign Counterintelligence” Postponements

It is presumed that the FBI will, at least partially, carry over its post-appeal standards for
disclosing “FCI” activities targeting Communist-bloc nations. To the extent that the
HSCA subjects reflect “FCI” activities against other nations that have not been
addressed by the Review Board in the “core” filés, the FBI will be allowed to redact
direct discussion of such activities, unless the information in the proposed redaction
meaningfully contributes to-the understanding of the assassination.

FBI and CIA Foreign Lialson Postponements

The criteria for these postponements would not, in the abstract, depart significantly from
the Review Board’s current approach of releasing information received through liaison
channels, while protecting direct acknowledgment of the source of the information. In
practice, however, the staff would be more flexible in protecting text that implies,
although may not unambiguously state, that a foreign goverment Is the source of
particular information. Nevertheless, the more significant the Information is. to any
assassinatlon-related Issue, the more Information would be released under these

guldelines,


CIA Stations and Other Issues

Over the past two years the Review Board has establishéd other guidelines that will
continue to guide the review process, some of which will be outlined here. For CIA
stations, all locations related to the Mexico City story will be released during the period
1960-69. ‘Outside of that window, they will be released on a case-by-case basis should
the identity of the station be critical to understanding the assassination. Other stations,
except for those Identified as particularly sensitive, will be released from the beginning
of the Kennedy administration until the publication of the Warren Commission report,
(Le., January 1, 1961 to October 1, 1964). Outside of these windows, stations will be
postponed. Cable prefixes, dispatch prefixes, and fleld report prefixes would be
postponed or released according to the sare windows as the stations to which they
refer. CIA job titles also are redacted or a along with the station at which the
officer served.

Crypts would be released along lines similar to other information. All “LI” crypts, except
those considered particularly sensitive would be released through October 1, 1964, as
are “AM” crypts and U.S. government crypts. In other aréas, only the digraph Is
protected. Again, the exception is sensitive crypts, which would be protected in their
entirety. After October 1, 1964, the presumption shifts towards protection of the crypts,
except those that provide meaningful information about the assassination story. (For
example, crypts pertinent to. Garrison-era documents would likely carry the same
presumption of release as those generated during the Warren Commission.)

Surveillance methods will be released if the nature of the surveillance has a material
bearing on information related to the assassination unless CIA provides evidenca
demonstrating the political or operational sensitivity, in which case-the information will
be released In 2017.

MEMORANDUM FOR: David G. Marwell
Executive Director
Assassination Records Review Board

SUBJECT: CIA Employees

1. (U) Iseye. The purpose of this memo is to relate
CIA's concerns to the Review Board regarding the release of
the true names of CIA employees that appear in the JFK
Collection and to present a proposal on how this problem
might be addressed.

zr c 1 c) {2}

2. (U) To date, approximately 600 true names of CIA
employees have been identified in the JFK Collection. Some
of these employees are important to the JFK story, and CIA

‘ will continue to work with the Review Board to release as
many of these names as possible. Many names, however,
appear only a few times in the entire JFK Collection and
appear to add nothing to the historical record.

3. (U) Under guidelines adopted by the Review Board
on or about 20 March 1996, any names of CIA employees are
presumptively released: unless CIA provides spécific evidence
to the Review Board that harm to the national security or to
the employee would likely result from such release. Singe
these guidelines were adopted, it has become increasingly
clear that the number of names at issue, and, in most cases,
their tenuous connection to the JFK story, make this °
approach unworkable with regard to both CIA's obligation to

Subject: CIA Employees

protect national security information and the Review Board's
duty to inform the public about the JFK assassination in a
timely and accurate fashion. The task of locating and
informing hundreds of former employees scattered all over
the country and the world has been a formidable one. Some
employees have contacted us to report their concerns about a
“suspicious" letter purporting to be from CIA which they had
received. It would not be surprising, therefore, if many
former employees ignored the letter for similar reasons,
even though they might have legitimate needs to protect
their identities.

4. (U) Contacting every named employee and collecting
information on each of them to present to the Review Board
will clearly take more time and effort than any of us had
anticipated. This will have obvious ramifications for how
and when the Review Board releases information to the
public. More importantly, the decision to publicly
acknowledge employees who may have been living for over 30
yeare under cover is a critical one that should be made not
by default, but rather by careful planning and
consideration.

5. (U) Relevant to this discussion is the fact that
the Review Board and CIA have recently agreed upon a policy
for releasing true names of sources of intelligence
information. It was agreed at that time that there would be
a presumption of protecting source names; but in cases where
a source was particularly important to the JFK story and
there was no overriding national security interest, the name
would-be released. Although the CIA recognizes that there
are some sensitivities involved with sources that do not
apply to covert employees, there are also many legal and
operational similarities, which are described herein, that
justify similar treatment by the Review Board. As is
further detailed in Section IV, CIA, therefore, proposes
that the Review Board adopt a general policy of protecting
employee names that appear in the Collection, with .
exceptions for those individuals whom the Board believes are
important to the JFK story.

II, Legal Considerationa

6. (U) As both covert CIA employees and clandestine:
reporting assets are types of “human sources" of
intelligence, many of the same laws apply. Although Section
1l(a) of the JFK Act provides that, when the Act requires
release of information, it takes precedence over ail other
laws that would otherwise prohibit release, there are strong
governmental national security intereats in protecting the
true names of CIA employees. CIA believes that it is

APR 15 97 @4:56PM USGOVERNMENT
SECRET

Subject: CIA Employees

important for the Review Board to reconsider the laws which
protect classified information, because they clearly reflect
a larger US Government policy to protect covert CIA
employees from disclosure.

7. (UW) By Executive order and statute, the President
and Congress have made the Director of Central Intelligence
responsible for protecting sources of intelligence. In his
Directive of 22 January 1946 that established the Central
Intelligence Group, President Truman made the DCI
responsible for protecting sources.- With the establishment
of CIA, Congress also gave the DCT this responsibility. The
National Security Act of 1947, Section 103(d) (3), codified
at 50 USC §403(3) (c) (5), requires the DCI to protect
intelligence sources from unauthorized disclosure, In
addition, §403(3) (d) (2) requires the DCI to ensure that
risks to the United States and those involved in the
collection of intelligence through human sources are
minimized.

8. (U) Protecting the identity of individuals working
for CIA, not only covertly but overtly as well, has been of
particular concern to US lawmakers since the establishment
of the Agency. For example, with Section 6 of the Central
Intelligence Agency Act of 1949, 50 USC §403g, Congress :
specifically exempted the CIA from the provisions of any law
requiring the publication or disclosure of the organization,
functions, names, titles, salaries, or numbers of personnel
employed by the Agency.

9. (U) In 1980, Congress passed the Classified
Information Procedures Act (CIPA) which sets out pretrial,
trial, and appellate procedures for criminal cases involving
or potentially involving classified information. Working
with the Department of Justice and the courts, CIA has
successfully protected the names of CIA employees from
public release even in criminal trials where there are
heightened (i.e., constitutional) considerations favoring
disclosure to the defendant of all government information
relevant to the defense. CIPA allows for in camera ex parte
hearings in which the judge can rule on questions of
admissibility and relevancy of classified information,
including the identity of CIA employees who may have
information pertaining to the defense, before it is
introduced either to the defendant, defense counsel, or in
open court. In some cases involving CIA, the judge has
ordered that CIA information be turned over to the defense,
but only in some unclassified form-such as in’a eummary., In
other cases, judges have reviewed the classified information -
and ruled that the harm to national security outweighs the

Subject: CIA Employees

defendant's legal rights to the information. In still other
cases, the defense was never notified that CIA even had
information bearing on the case, as the judge ruled that the
mere fact that CIA possessed this information was classified
and outweighed any rights the defendant had. Moreover,
under CIPA, the Attorney General has the authority to drop a
prosecution in those cases where the risk to national
security is too great.

10. (U) In 1982, Congress again acted to protect CIA
employees by passing the Intelligence Identities Protection
Act of 1982, 50 USC §421 that criminalizes the revelation of ~~
a covert employee or the identity of a source. This act
subjects anyone who reveals information that identifies a
“covert agent" to prosecution and provides up.to 10 years in
prison and $50,000 in fines as punishment. This act
specifically defines a “covert agent" as including "an
officer or employee of an intelligence agency... ."

11. (U) Most recently, President Clinton signed
Executive Order 12958 on classified national security
information that became effective in October 1995. Although
it requires generally that agencies make greater
declassification efforts than under the prior executive
order, Executive Order 12958 affords human sources of
intelligence information, which would include employees,
extra protection from the declassification provisions.
Under £.0. 12958, information that is over 25 years old and
having historical value must be declassified within five
years. However, information revealing the identity of a
human source may continue to be protected.

12. (U). The above federal laws show a long-standing
practice by the US Government to protect CIA employees from
disclosure to the public. In carrying out its statutory
obligations, the Review Board should give serious weight to
this policy and afford the protection of CIA employees a
high priority. : : Sete

TIL, Operational Considerations

13. (U) For current CIA employees whose names may
appear in the JFK Collection, the operational considerations
for protecting their identity are similar to those for
sources. Many of these employees have worked “under cover"
for CIA. Cover ie used to disassociate entire installations
and offices from open linkage to intelligence activities, to
enable intelligence personnel to enter and work effectively
in foreign countries, to shield Agency employees and
authorized clandestine activities from attention by hostile
elements and from media exposure, to facilitate access to

certain individuals of intelligence interest, to prevent
embarrassment to host foreign governments, and to permit
Laerterpos denial of CIA's presence and activities in foreign
countries.

14. (U) The ability to maintain one's cover is
erucial to gathering intelligence. In either a "hostile" or
“friendly" country, should the local service become aware of
who the CIA employees are, it would increase surveillance
and make unilateral operations difficult if not impossible.
In some countries, the local government tolerates the CIA
presence and agrees to work with us as long as the local
population is not aware of the circumstances. Once it
becomes known among the locals that certain US Government
officials are actually CIA, pressure may be placed on the
government to el those Americans, disrupting liaison and
diplomatic relationships. More importantly, covert
employees and their families would face increased risk to
their personal safety. Even in "friendly" countries, our
employees could face some personal risks as well as risks to
ongoing operations from extremists who may be living among
an otherwise benign local population. In any of these
cases, should a covert employee's cover be publicly
compromised, that employee may have to be recalled from the
field; and it could be difficult to place him elsewhere in
an operationally and physically secure location. Thus,
maintaining cover is important toa case officer's
effectiveness and to the continuation of a career with CIA.

15. (8) Maintaining the confidentiality of cover is
also. important to cover providers. The Review Board will
recall from prior briefings by the Agency that covert CIA
employees, both in the United States and overseas, can work
under “official" (e.g. | cover or "non-
official" (e.g., yY cover. Disclosure of a
covert employee woulda not only pe official acknowledgment of
the specific cover mechanism employed by CIA but would also
negatively affect the governmental or business mission: of
the cover provider, especially those who provide non-
official cover. Acknowledgment of an employee who had been
under non-official cover in a host country and possibly in

(ae ees have a negative impact on the
|dnterests and activities. It would also
cast suspicion on that \ employees and

their families. Further, exposure Of cover providers could
affect the recruitment and cooperation of such providers by
the Agency and Intelligence Community.

16. (S) Although the majority of names that appear in
the Collection are retired CIA employees, the operational
considerations in revealing their affiliation with CIA are

Subject: CIA Employees

not diminished. Similar to sources, many former employees
still do not want their past affiliation with CIA revealed.
Perhaps their current txlends, family, or employers are not
aware of this past affiliation; and revelation of that fact
could negatively affect personal and professional
relationships. Some former employees still live, overseas
where a revelation of CIA affiliation poses risks to their
personal safety. Other former employees travel overseas on
business, where a revelation of a past CIA affiliation can
threaten their business interests and personal safety.

One example of an employee in this category is Robert
Fulton, whose name apparently app

Collection. Fulton retired under cover;
he currently has a consultant business and frequently
travels to China. Release of his name would jeopardize not

only his haps even his safety. A similar
example i: . who also retired under
cover. le is now working in Russia and several Fast

European countries for a private firm. He doea not want his
name published, because it could be damaging to his current
employer and his professional status.

17. (8). Even if a former employee agrees to the
revelation of his name in the JFK Collection, this might not
be possible for other reasons. In some cases, officially
acknowledging a covert employee could threaten ongoing
operations on which that employee worked. Foreign nationals
recruited by the employee and still providing information to
the US Government would be at risk of exposure. Public
acknowledgment could reveal the location of CIA stations
where the employee worked throughout his career, including
some not released by the Review Board. Any individuals who
had substantial contact with a former employee overseas and
may have believed they were legitimately providing
information to a US corporate representative would be upset
to learn they were, in fact, aiding the US Government.

18. (U) Finally, the identification of case officers
by their own service would have a chilling effect on
prospective assets. Prospective assets would be unlikely to
enter into a clandestine relationship with American
intelligence if they believe that CIA does not protect even
its own staff employees from public disclosure.

iW. Proposal

19. (U) In light of the foregoing, CIA believes it is
important to work toward a general policy of protecting CIA
employees identified in the JFK Collection, with exceptions
made for those individuals who are important to the atory of
the assassination. The Agency proposes that in most cases a

Subject: CIA Employees

substitution for the true name be used. If the Review Board
is concerned about tracking particular employees throughout
the records, a particular identifying substitution can be
used for a particular employee. .

20. (S) CIA believes that this approach will not
undermine the Review Board's. obligations under the JFK Act.
A review of the JFK Collection reveals that approximately 84
‘of the 600 names appear only once in the entire Collection.
In such cases, it is difficult to see how the individuals!
identity can add anything of significance to the historical .
record; yet there may be some security concerns ‘
associated with these individuals. For example,

[ |xetired under cover and is currently living in
Europe. When the CIA notified him that his name appeared in
the JFK Collection and was subject to public release, he
told CIA that he was opposed to having his name released and

- believed such a release could pose personal and security
problems. Furthermore, he could not understand why his name
even appeared in the Collection, since he had no
recollection of being involved in anything related to the
assassination.

21. (8) With regard to the approximately 500 names
that appear more than once in the Collection, the vast
majority of these individuals played almost no role in the
JFK story. One example of this is former DO officer
Alexander Brasko. His name appears approximately 20-30
times.in the Collection simply because he signed off on name
trace requests. Mr. Brasko was a covert CIA employee and
retired under cover. The public release of his name would
provide the public with no additional significant
information about JFK. Tom Flores ig another example of a
covert CIA employee whose name appears in the Collection but
has little or no connection to the JFK story. Flores
retired under cover, is living in South America, and objects
to the release of his name. Mr. Flores' recent letter to
CIA is also attached for your convenience.

22. (8) The Agency, of course, recognizes that some
namea may be particularly important to the JFK story
regardless of how frequently or infrequently they appear in
the Collection. One such example is former COS Mexico
Winston Scott who CIA has acknowledged as a CIA employee.
In such cases, the CIA will continue to work with the Review
Board for an appropriate resolution. The CIA proposes that
the Review Board and its staff identify those individuals
whom it believes are important to the JFK story and whose
names should be released to the public. These names would
carry a presumption of release unless specific evidence is
provided to the Review Board that harm would likely result

from such release. The CIA will conduct the appropriate
searches to determine whether release would pose national
security concerns for the US Government or personal safety
concerns for the individual. In this way, CIA and the Review
Board. can concentrate their efforts on individuals who are
significant figures in the JFK story, expediting the review
of the sequestered collection.

23. (U) It is our hope that the CIA and the Review
Board can agree on. and work out a mutually acceptable policy
regarding the identity of CIA employees that will not
undermine the important principle of protecting those who
work covertly for the US Government. My staff and I are
yeady to discues this matter with you at your convenience.

MEMORANDUM FOR: JFK Assassination Records Review Board

VIA: Associate Deputy Director for Operations
Associate Deputy Director for Operations/Human
Resources and Programs

FROM: Eric L. Qualkenbush
Chief, Office of Central Cover

SUBJECT: Proposed CIA Name Release

1. The Agency strongly objects to the release of names of
individuals presently under cover, whether active employees or
separated employees. As described below, this action would
breach Agency commitments to these individuals who agreed. to work
under cover in addition to breaching our obligations.to the cover
providers.

2. Employees sign a secrecy agreement (Attacnment A) upon
entering on duty with the Agency. This agreement pledges the
employee’s secrecy to information which is classified and has not
been publicly acknowledged by the Agency and requires the
employee to protect such information from unauthorized
disclosure. This secrecy agreement, as long as it remains in
force by mutual agreement, obliges CIA to protéct the identities
of Agency employees, our cover providers and covert activities.

3. Because this secrecy agreement creates a moral as well
‘as legal bond between the Agency and the employee, it is Agency
policy to protect the names of former employees who have
separated under cover unless the Agency and the employee mutually
agree to remove the cover. Identifying as CIA those employees
who are mandated by thi story, i.e.,

: or for their entire
genc eer aS well as into tneir years aIter separation from

the Agency, jeopardizes:

the cover and identity of other employees who worked
with the covert employee whose name is released as
CIA; and,

the protection of sources and methods (what
individual would agree to a clandestine relationship
with American intelligence knowing the secret
association would become public knowledge?) .

4. Examples of how identifying covert employees as CIA will
affect. individuals follows:

with his current employer, his position with the
firm and would be awkward at best regarding the host
countries. Attachment B is Mr.

acknowledgement that he was aware he would be denied
as a CIA employee and Attachment C is his signed
secrecy agreement.

Attachment D is a signed ackowledgement from Mr.
John Whitten who retired under cover in 1970 which
shows that he was aware that he would be denied as
an employee of the Central Intelligence Agency from
the date he entered on duty through the date of his
departure. Attachment E is a personal letter
received from Mr. Whitten after he was notified that
his name might be released in connection with
declassification of CIA documents. Attachment F is
Mr. Whitten’s signed secrecy agreement. It should
be noted that Mr. Whitten resides in Austria.

5. Our relationship with cover providers would be
jeopardized if it became publicly known that they were providing
cover to CIA employees. The could very well
raise objections to our future use of cover. Of increasing
importance to the Agency at this time is the critical use of
private sector (nonofficial) cover providers. The. private sector
would no doubt drop contact and avoid future dealings with us if
we reveal a covert relationship. Identifying covert
relationships with cover providers would paralyze Agency
operations which in turn could severely damage national security.
In addition, in the past it has exposed CIA to legal liabilities
and substantial monetary damages.

6. Headquarters Regulation (HR) 240-1 is the Agency’s
regulation on cover. It states that “cover is required for all
Agency operations, activities and installations abroad, including
personnel in PCS or TDY status.” HR 240-2, the Agency’s
regulation on cover after separation, states that “the
determination that an employee will retain all or a part of his
or her cover after separation from the Agency will be based upon
the judgment that separation in an overt status could result in
damage to the national security by compromising intelligence
sources, methods, activities, and/or information, or cause harm
to. foreign relations. This determination will be made on a case-

by-case basis.” Please note that

7. Release of names of former employees who separated under
cover will make the entire Agency cover program vulnerable and
detract from our continuing efforts to enhance cover and conduct
sometimes dangerous. activities necessary to carry out the’
Agency’s mission. We can accept the purpose of the JFK
Assassination Records Review Act to declassify documents for
public consumption; however, we submit that the release of true
names of former Agency employees adds no value to the documents
in addition to risking physical harm to these individuals from
our public detractors. We propose and emphatically encourage
that pseudonyms, aliases or generic job descriptions such as desk
officer be used in place of true names which would not diminish
the impact of the documents.

shows that he was aware that he would be denied as
an employee of the Central Intelligence Agency from

departure. Attachment E is a personal letter
received from Mr. Whitten after he was notified that
his name might be released in connection with
declassification of CIA documents. Attachment F is
Mr. Whitten’s signed secrecy agreement. It should
be noted that Mr. Whitten resides in Austria.

Attachment G is a Summary of Agency Employment (SAE)

5. Our relationship with cover providers would be
jeopardized if it became publicly known that they were providing
cover to CIA employees. The could very well
raise objections to our future use of cover. Of increasing
importance to the Agency at this time is the critical use of
private sector (nonofficial) cover providers. The private sector
would no doubt drop contact and avoid future dealings with us if
we reveal a covert relationship. Identifying covert
relationships with cover providers would paralyze Agency
operations which in turn could severely damage national security.
In addition, in the past it has exposed CIA to legal liabilities
and substantial monetary damages.

6. Headquarters Regulation (HR) 240-1 is the Agency’s
regulation on cover. It states that “cover is required for all
Agency operations, activities and installations abroad, including
personnel in PCS or TDY status.” HR 240-2, the Agency's
regulation on cover after separation, states that “the
determination that an employee will retain all or a part of his
or her cover after separation from the Agency will be based upon
the judgment that separation in an overt status could result in
damage to the national security by compromising intelligence
sources, methods, activities, and/or information, or cause harm
to foreign relations. This determination will be made on a case-

by-case basis.” Please note that

7. Release of names of former employees who separated under
cover will make the entire Agency cover program vulnerable and
detract from our continuing efforts to enhance cover and conduct
sometimes dangerous activities necessary to carry out the
Agency's mission. We can accept the purpose of the JFK
Assassination Records Review Act to declassify documents for
public consumption; however, we submit that the release of true
names of former. Agency employees adds no value to the documents
in addition to risking physical harm to these individuals from
our public detractors. We propose and emphatically encourage
that pseudonyms, aliases or generic job descriptions such as desk.
officer be used in place of true names which would not diminish
the impact of the documents.

with the Central Intelligence Agency. I realize that, by virtue of my duties
with that Agency, I have been the recipient of. information and intelligence which
concerns the present and future security of the United States of America.. I am
aware that the unauthorized disclosure of such information is prohibited by the
Espionage Laws (18 USC secs. 793 and 794), and by the ‘National Security Act of
1947 which specifically requires the protection of intelligence sources and
methods from unauthorized disclosure. Accordingly, I SOLEMNLY SWEAR, WITHOUT
MENTAL RESERVATION OR PURPOSE OF EVASION, AND IN THE ABSENCE OF DURESS, AS FOL-
LOWS: ef

1. I will never divulge, publish, or reveal cy writing, word, conduct, cr
otherwise, any information relating to the national defense and security and
particularly information of this nature relating to intelligence sources, meth-
ods and operations, and specifically Central Intelligence Agency operations,
sources, methods, personnel, fiscal data, or security measures to anyone, in-
cluding but not limited to, any future governmental or private employer, private
citizen, or other Government employee or official without the express written
consent of the Director of Central Intelligence or his authorized representative.

2. I have been invited to submit in writing any monetary claims which I
may have against CIA or the United States Government which may in any way neces~
sitate the disclosure of information described herein. I have been advised that
any such claims will receive full legal consideration. In the event, however,
that I am not satisfied with the decisions of CIA concerning any present or
future claims I may submit, I will not take any other action to obtain satis-
faction without prior written notice to CIA, and then only in accordance with
such legal and security advice as CIA will promptly furnish me.

3- I do not have any documents or materials in my possession, classified
or unclassified, which are the property of, or in custodial-responsibility of
the Central Intelligence Agency, having come into my possession as a result of
my duties with the Central Intelligence Agency, or otherwise.

4, During my exit processing and during my period of employment with the
Central Intelligence Agency I have been given an opportunity to report all in-
formation about the Agency, its personnel, and its operations which I consider
should receive official cognizance. Hence, I am not aware of any information,
which it is my duty in the national interest to disclose to the Central Intel-
ligence Agency, nor am I aware of any violations or breaches of security which
I have not officially reported, except as set forth on the reverse ‘side of this
