2. Maeting: A fame to my motel. room (503) on Friday
morning at 0900 and departed at 1645. During this time, beth o
sat in easy chayis in front of a picture widow on the 5th foor -

A lid 95% of. the talking. Weither of us got up dur this veriod,
a strech of almost 8 hours. A- was most intertaining, but o
ginally informative as to specific details on the questions proned
to him, Ho spins a good story and remembers people and places very
well. My bona fides for the meeting was a call from Ms, Sheila
O'Neil to A “fa day before I arrived in Tampa. A is a little
goosy, because of: a DEA connection (below), and checked mp ont thru
a phone call to the motel by his wife. Incidentally, I used tra
name with = A |

3. Results: & fovered the following topics with me:

a. Training: On Panama and the facilities used,& the best

[could remember, Ft. Sherman was open in about August or
September 1960 to train Cubans for about a 2 to. 3 month period.
There were about 40 to 50 men, mostly ARTIMé followers. When it was
decided a bigger group would be needed, which later became Brigade
2506, these people were sent to Rotalhulou (Guatemala) xndxnth in
abont November 1960. _Actually, the group was split, with some going
to Guatemala and others, to.the New Orleans area, As to other training
in Panama, A \has no knowledge. (HoTH: A jsurzested that Hr,

wm A, >, retired staffer currently in the New Orleans area,
might be a good source, Ax i was c/ops for the invasion Task Force,

fete as wo$l as Deputy for PM and C/Ops for JMWAYE at one time, )

“ bh. Supplies: As Lo explosives, bine del
conprel devisas, detonation mterials, ele. iven Lo thase
dd, “Look over the supply mamial for thal time.” APE
es wore given averything that was available and in lar
quantities, & {said ha just could not bagin to give me a list
i
of what had beon passed.

e. Infil T After the Bay of Piss invasion, AX | 7
worked with infiltra 3 Tha Agency worked with these te

from roughly 1953 to 1956. ‘Thay were in two catapories. The fir
wore unilateral teams, traininy and sponsored by the Agency. The
other calarory was “political” toans - that is cal. groups in

souttharn Florida who were sponsoring infiltr “Oo Cuba,

The Agency helped this lator m catanory by iv ng them supplios.

Tn the case of both, they usually made a caches in Cuba. The

unilateral team, as an example, would make a cache on-island, and

another group would pick it up and use it (compartnentation).

In some cases, teams. (both unilateral and political) would not

actually make the cache and keep the material in Flerida, to be -
used later at their own convenience, In addition, w& [was positive
that some of Castro's troops obtained some of thes caches, dus to
foul-ups and snitches, These caches containes pistols, rifles and
heavier, money and demolitions. Some of the teams cheated by going
to the Bahamas and buryinht their stuff on small islands and reporting
back to Florida that they had cached in Cuba, A stated several
timos that there was no effective control over the “political”
groups and therefore no control ofer the material riven them, from
this, me may surmize that agency equipment (demolition included) 1
in the hands of anti-Castro Cubans in south Florida, as well as
‘Castro's Rebel Army on-island.

es d, . Brigade. Training:...Further to demolition. training. to
Anti-Castro Cubans, A reminded me that shortly after the Brirade
was ransomed from Cuba, Brigade leaders were taken to Palm Beach
and talked with President Kennedy. At that time, the US Govt offered
Brigade members .the chance to join the U.S, army. This also included
infil team members, who were completely seperate from the Brigade, and
members of the Brigade airforce. The Army end of this training was
given at Ft. Benning, Georgia and began in early 1963. ‘There, Brinade
eed members entered the U.S. Army at roukly equivalent ranks - officers
were made 2nd Lts, They received Ranger training, plus. jump trainina.
Thus, A, Said, if any exiles were training in demolations and related
topics, théte best training was probably mivon at Ft. Benning. Tost
of these men were in the U.S, Army for either 6 months or one year.

©. Cubana Bonbing: & was specifically asked about tho
6 October 1976 bombing tha of the Cubana airliner in the Garibbean.

A i said the street-word ahong the Cuban community in south Florida
is that the bomb should have gone off in the plane on the ground. Tho i
bombers did not moan to kill all of those people. On BOSCH, the i
community does not particularly like him, but admires him because he
had been going at Castro tooth and nail for yoars. They do not like
the idea of terrorism and fault BOSCH and MORALES for this.

&. Assassinations by the Agency: A& said he had absolutely

no knowledge of assassinations, attempts or plans, by anyone in the
Agency during his tour, Not only were they prohibited iy the A
hey were counter-productive, Tk was explained to him during his
Agency tour that! there was a good chance of an assa nation back-
firing; that we (U.S.) are re vulmurable to a: inations than
the Cubans or Soviets. The pefore, as far as he wa concnrned, they
were strictly verboton. Editorializing, A: it was too bad
that the upper-echolonsilid not believe in this restriction, Qn top
of that, they approachél mafiosa to help them. (NOTE A ‘is
rather anti-Kennedy, especially Bobby, with whom he was in a shout
match during a hearing on the Bay of Pigs invasion. )

BSUS,

h. As Juan Jose Fernyero, a Bay
of Pigs veteran leader of the ade 2506, was runned dewn 1
week as he loft his home in Miami, A /said tho word on tho st
among the Orhan, community is that this was done by the DGL as a warnine
to the ant: RK ubans in Miami Foruyero had no enemies - he was not
into drugs, crimo, politics, ete, By killing him, the Cubans «ere
warning the community that thay could strike anywhere and anyono,
Thus, watch out and lay off Cuba and Cuban citizens. If anyono else
had been killed, perhaps the killing could have bean blamed on
the mafia, drug dealers, politicians, ete. A copy of an editorial
from the Tampa*Tribune of 14 Jan 77 is attached, below,

j. CRS _Show on Gn! A said CPS is planning a show
on the "Logasy of the Bay of Pigs," which should ta broadeast in

about. May 1977. CBS has already shot xeanx interviexs in Miami,
including ono with Peruyero (above) before he was killed, plus
covering the aftermath of his assassination. Currently, the CSS
crew is in Cuba - they hope to film the beaches at the Pay of Pirs -
which had been suggested to them by’ A. A& ‘has also been
interviowed and has given hls opinions for the TY showing. while
in Cuba, the CRS crew hopes to also interview Fidel -~‘also at the
sucpostion of The fellow behind the show is named CRILE amt
he has talked té A /extensivoly. According to A | the show
would have boon vory anti-Azency in its comments, bub he A}
has turnod this around almost 180 dezreest!! As planned, the ~
show will be two hours and shown in May 1977. :

k. Brigade 2506: On the Brigado, -& ‘said he had beon
an apolitical organization, Individuals of any political shade had
been mombers and politica had not ‘really entered Brigade Association
business. Last year, however, they joined with Orlando BOSCH , amone
others, to help form CORU. Now, the Brigade is embarrassed and wished
they had never joined CORU. They with-drew shortly after the Cubana
bombing in October 76. However, the damage has been done to the
Brigade Association, which A jconsiders a shame. On the CBS film
(above), A ‘said he was filmed attending an anniversary meeting.
This same meeting was where CBS filmed Peyuyero.

a A DEA: ‘hen A retired from the Agency, ho
moved to Key Wast. Ho came to the attention of DSA, especially to
Lou Conine, an ex-Agency 6fficer now with DEA, A ‘calls Coninoe
an SOB and.worse. He went into a long explaination of his activities
with DEA in Key West. -In summary, he was a P/A and ran a string of
informants, Because of internal DEA politics, he was blown and left
dangling on a’string in Key West. He had to leave town within 24
hours and left his people (informants) there without calling or
warning thon, As a result, he lost friends, prestige with his
informants (many of them Cyban exiles) and his business in Key West,
In general torms, he was treated very shabbily by D&A and regrots
ever having mixed with them. He is still in contact with one of

"Tho Bay of Pigs" before do vz Washinton, Lynch explained that
he had dictaled this paper amd had a couple of s tar type i
out, It is only in very rough form and he wanted to get his thouchts
down on papsr. As he indicates in the paper, hs wanted to get tie
facts straight. fe feels that since he was thero and part of the
invasion, he has+a unique vkew point of the Bay of Pies and wants
to see that history reflects his pobition, As indicated earlier,

A is-rather bitter amainst the New Frontier, the Kennedys ant
Camolot. This is reflocted in his manuscript, claimed that
much of his paper bad boen "stolen" in that he explained the inva ion,
for instance, to the CBS crew and they were using sono of his material
in the soon to hee be shown program dascribed above. In addition,

@& mentioned that he had spoken to the Agency historian - can't
recall his name - on who is also writing a book (classified) on the
invasion, As to publication, it seams to be in the distant future.
He does not plan to xo to a publisher, where he would xex receiv
royalty payments of around 5%, Rather, he. plans to publish on his
own, probably in Miami, and realize close to 100% profit. It micht
cost him kha in the area of $5,000, but he could realize a profit of
about $30,000 depending on sales.
