TAL REPORT

CONPIDEN

We have learned from a good and reliable source thst the Cuban government

ia thinking of discharging 5,000 members of the revolutionary arsy at the

end of November or beginning of December 195%- ‘he end purpose of tills ig to
have the discharged ran take part in invasions of Panana and the Doninican
Republics the Cuban gevernzent ‘could not be blamed for such acticns, since the
nen would not be menders of the regular Cuban Army. The invasions will be
carried out simltaneously, in order to obstruct any quick action by the
Organisation of Anericon States (048)- The same source indicates that 3,000
Well-armed men will take part in the invasion of Panama, and that the men
will come here under the conutnd of Commander Ernesto ("Che") GUSVARA, who
it appears received precise instructions while tm his trip to Egypt. It
appears that intentions are first to take over Panama, and, after that, tou

undertake an international campaign for NATICNALIZIMQ-the Panama Canal, Por

the latter campaign, they will have tie support of several Latin American and
several European countries, a3 well as of several Panamanian political groups,
including the Tercer Partido Nacionalista which already has declared itself

in that regard, The sac source indicates that, before the invasicns come about,
there will be an open publicity campaign to pave the way and to produce

intemal upheavals in Panana and the Dominican Republic, It appears that the

invasions will receive material, financial, and other support from the

Vensauelan governments
NOT! This information ean be verified by /PaPRIM/ intelligence services

and (EAcID7 offices in the countries concerned. In tine, it will be seen
Af the actions noted at the beginning of this report have happened, and, if
80, it will indicate that the rest will come about in due course. The

informant tells us that Cubs, Venesuelan, and Panamanian Cowmnists will take

a very active part in everythings
