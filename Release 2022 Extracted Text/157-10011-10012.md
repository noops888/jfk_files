With regard to paragraph 2 of Lansdale's memorandum to SCA dated 14 Nov.

1962 Harvey states:

"The statement that. Operation Mongoose had had no information on

this operation since early October was patently false. Specific references made to the

pen ultimate paragraph and Lansdale's memorandum concerning a report for the CIA which he

used as a basis for memorandum dated 31 Oct. 1962 to Oswald Kirkpatrick. This refers to

a telephonic conversation on-the evening of 30 Oct. 1962 between Lansdale and Cheever

which is referred specifically in paragraph 2 on pages 7 and 8 of my reference memorandu.

I have discussed this matter in detail with Cheever and clearly recollects that his

conversation with Lansdale on that date took place as reflected in my reference memorandum.

During this conversation there was no discussion of previous operations except a brief

discussion of the COBRA and FANUORID teams and Lansdale did not ask, according to Cheever's

recollection, any specific questions concerning assets inside or prior operations which

SOURCE: would logically have led to the discussions at the timp STAFF:
