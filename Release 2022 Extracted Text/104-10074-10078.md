SENTIMENT HAS BEEN PROMOTED BY THE BELIEF ON ABACO THAT MUCH

PRIVATE U.S. CAPITAL WILL SUPPORT A NEW, SMALL INDEPENDENT COUNTRY
AND IN ADDITION SOME ERSTWHILE NASSAU CAPITAL WILL ALSO MOVE TO i
ABACO. SOME ABACO RESIDENTS CLAIM THEY HAVE SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE \°
THAT BAY STREET MONIES WHICH ARE CONCEALED OR HAVE LEFT THE

BAHAMAS WOULD RETURN TO AN INDEPENDENT ASACO.

2. WHILE THERE IS SOME DISENCHANTMENT WITH ABACO sycrenan

WITH WELL-KNOWN ARMS DEALERS SUCH AS MLICHELL WERBELL, NEVERTHE- :
LESS ACCORDING TO A PALM BEACH. GUN DEALER THERE HAS BEEN AN UPSURGE
IN THE VOLUME OF WEAPONS ENTERING ABACO AND In ADDITION MORE AND
.MORE GUNS ARE FINDING THEIR WAY TO oPrositiot ELEMENTS ON THE
ISLAND OF NEW PROVIDENCE. .

3. THE NEW COMMISSIONER FOR ABACO, COMMISSIONER (STORR) HAS

BEGUN A REPRESSION AIMED AT WHITE OPPOSITION ELEMENTS. NORMAL

BUSINESS DEALINGS ARE MADE DIFFICULT, PERMITS NOT SIGNED AND
RECORDS MISHANDLED.

A SIMILAR ATTACK DIRECTED AT OPPOSITION”
ELEMENTS IS OCCURRING ON CAT KEY WHERE THE NEW COMMISSIONER, WHO
CONTROLS SOME LOCAL TRANSPORT, IS REFUSING TO HANDLE NERCHANDISE Hl
BELONGING TO FORMER DISSIDENT ELEMENTS. ; . i
4a.

JUST PRIOR TO INDEPENDENCE, ONE HUNDRED CASES OF DYNAMITE



14-00000

MYSTERIOUSLY DISAPPEARED FROM THE PREMISES OF SEABREEZES, LIMITED,
A CONSTRUCTION FIRM. ‘SENTIMENT EXPLAINING THIS DISAPPEARANCE

TAKES THREE FORMS, REGARDED AS LEAST LIKELY IS THAT OF A SIMPLE

THEFT UNRELATED TO POLITICAL ELEMENTS. A SECOND SCHOOL
BELIEVES THAT THIS MATERIAL, THE EQUIVALENT OF FOUR PICK-UP
TRUCK LOADS, HAS BEEN CACHED BY DISSIDENTS FOR FUTURE USE. fb

POPULAR INTERPRETATION, HOWEVER, HAS IT THAT THE POLICE REMOVED
THE DYNAMITE POSSIBLY TO MINIMIZE THE LIKELIHOOD OF VIOLENCE BY
REMOVING EXPLOSIVE MATERIAL. ABACO DISSIDENTS, HOWEVER, CLAIM!
TO BELIEVE THAT THE POLICE REMOVED THE DYNAMITE AS PART OF A
PROVOCATION WITH THE IDEA OF HOLDING THIS MATTER OVER THE HEADS
OF THE WHITE ABACO RESIDENTS FOR POSSIBLE FUTURE USE. THESE .
PEOPLE CLAIM THAT THE DYNAMITE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN REMOVED WITH- f
OUT POLICE COMPLICITY, SINCE THE AREA WAS WELL PATROLLED. ~ IN
ADDITION THE POLICE ARE KNOWN TO HAVE LEASED A PICK-UP TRUCK
AROUUD THAT TIME. a

5. A FURTHER UNSETTLING NOTE IS THE FACT THAT CHUCK MALL
WHO HAS BEEN FOMENTING VIOLENCE FOR SOME TIME AND WHO CLAIMS

RELATIOUSHIPS WITH U.S. INTELLIGENCE HAS QUIETLY INQUIRED ABOUT
RENTING A RESIDENCE ON ABACO. END OF REPORT.
