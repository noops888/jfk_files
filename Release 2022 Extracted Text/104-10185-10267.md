3. It is realized that an operational progress report end a cuntact

report are tho different items; however, in view of the detailed nature of

the LITAMILy Ca's the Station has felt that their submission has satisfied

the requirements of operational reporting. The eriticism of reference is

all the mure puzzling since auch visitors to the Station as Chester D.

Lainold, Chief, lit; torton A. Wolley,

erstrile Chiet of Operations, WiD;

uld thomas W. Luid, present lexic. branch ühief, have ill expressed their

approval of the detalled operational reporting on this peration darius

visits they have made to the Station at which time the repors in questlen

have neen brought to ther attention.

4.

Whea LITANTED next extts PERlai, the Statlon will begin to

prepare formal operational progress reports on the operation.

As for the questions raised in paragraph ê of reference regarding

operationai securliy, advance infortution on ITAlIL-l's recall came frau

IIiOr but he was not informed of the irminence of his. transfer urtli 1t

was reported routinely by LIPwill? ard wus ¿eerally mown by his collia-

los for the implication that INTAlIly was Infored of the Station's

capability to interiaft imassy talephore conversatiuns,

reading of the lemorandu: under critlque will show that no such aciciola

ledgement ras nade, IT'AlI was informed that "e have a scad chance

of being tuld abist such a conversation by wie of our friends," 1.e, that

word will probably bet around in Smbussy circles that IlPANIay 1s about

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

FROM

Lawrence F. Parker

SUBJECT.&

Meeting with LITAMIL?, 16 jen 6l,

made at other shed an heated - jas aftero eno

vicinity of the recentlr amulned safe apartment which will be used for this

operation in the future.

when he irarned that the neeting would be held in

an apartment he got a bad cage of nerves, said "I don't likè this one bit,"

and came very close to refusing. Rorker finally convinced him that this ono

meeting should be held there and tit 1f, after tallang things over, L-9

did not feel sare there the place hould not be used for lurther meetings.

B. entered the safe ajarirent at 2017 and Los showed up at 2046. By this timo

ho was almost sharing.-Eegtrring ty reminding l-9 that the two had always

worked together well by beire perfortly frank and open with each other; B

proposed that I-s state his ressons for being afraid of holding meetingo in

a safe apartment, after shich 8 would state his reasons in favor of the

proposition,

as the eid of stich L-? would be allowed to decide whether the

apartment should be used in the future.

2a La9 ranbled all erer the map, referred to his many meetingo with

his sarlier C/O Shryock, sorettres tho or three in one days said ha had

absolute confidence in B, but didn't trust other jeople, etce, eto. The

reasons for his allergy to safehouses did not becare evident so B began hís

spied and held forth on the good points of the new meetirg place -- L-9 and

B would never be together except tehind these walls - could not be seen

together u. a corer story for use if the apartment explained to the portera

B's presence (she could be counted on to spread it around a bit.), thero aro

tho good looking woven ilving in other apartments in the same building which

could explain Laf's havirg entered if anyone knowing him were to sea him go

in (he 1s a bachelor, the fersor frois whon the apartrent 1s aub-leased does

not kno Big-nate cr lderties; B's car wordd never be parked in front of the

house, etc., etc.

Los acinewledged all this but repeated his statement that

he doesn't

trust other people.

Then 1t finally cane out, he was under tho

Impression that the apartient was to be used by B for reeting numerous other

agents - apparently he coui? not conceiva of our obtaining an apartment to

use for meeting one lone agent.

As soon as he was assured that ho was the

maly agent who would be set thare he calred down and relaxed noticeably. In

his mind's eye he had been seeing a penetration agent point out the apartment

and causing it to be watched by in opposition which would eventually catch

Los going 1n. Los required S'a: asslirancos three different times during tho

meeting that other persers would not be met there.

This caused B to deliver

& short course on camarteeniation and show Los that we would considor 1t

folly to meet nore than rue agent in the lano place. (For the record, 1t

ahould be noted that agent DRIP ray be net there fron tire to tina -- 1t

18 not planned that the apartent will be apposed to any other saçoto).

3. Lal saplained that he would naun to leate sy 2200 hours since be had

to go to tis airpuri to seet an inraned Polia totmiciano

He showed o tins

cables racaired by the Embassy announcing that a "techico Polones" would

arrito by VARIO on 16 jasuary and that the Enbassy should meet him and arrango

—his traval to Havana on Cubass 20 ian. L-l las chosen to seet thia saa sho

picked it up and used 1t (surprisingly sturbling over it in his rawire Spanish

each time) and "agreed" that 1t fit lán to a "I."

his flazging spirits were about

back up to norral when the meeting eried.. It 1s clear that ho was absolutaly

terrifled at the thought of using a s:lo apartuent which he thought would to used
