12, (ADD) At the meeting of 21 July L-9 showed his C/O a letter he had just
received fron Teresa PROFWZA in which ste inforned him that she had talked over
with his sister-inelaw-the matter Le9 and Teresa discussed in Mexico (this refers

ee to an L-9 trip to Habana) and that the s-iel thought it wes a great idea and hoped
to seé him in Cuba soon, - This letter, flap wsesled, was delivered to L-9 by
Manuel VEDA who, of course, read it, i$ felt that Teresa's careful wording,
making the whole matter look 4 bit mysterious, wae good in that it helped maintain
the aura of mystery about hin, He felt, however, that in view of the late date he
would probabiy not get an invitation to the 26th of. July celebration,

de At the Staff meeting the Anbessador preised Aparicio
: fer having been elected as "Vocal = Zona del Caribe”
: : at a-recent AMOOSAC meeting. (L-9 said that these AMOOSAC
ede : “meetings are a farce, great mabers of Nicarsguans, Cubans,
so rs |. ets, turn out and pretend they are important while nost
ef i of the diplanats in tow who r ly deserve the title stay

great honor for Cuba but that-he felt that an apology to the
- Exbassy staff was in order since the staff as a body should
have mét before Aparioic accerted the nomination since this
is the démocratic way of doing things -- the socialist way.

were to be sent to sors other Embassy in two months, then
Cuba would lose this important AMCOSAC position,” 9
-found in this remark a faint hint that Aparicio might be

work and told of a letter. which had been received fren the

took all the credit 20 L-9, feigning anger, spoke up and re~
rarked that he had done‘his ehare — then began to enumerate
his contributions and took Aparicio to task for hogging the

Meeting vith LITAMIL<°, i Jan 6

A‘meeting was held With L-9 en the ht of: 16 Jan, Pickeup was
made at the corner of 2eforma and ital (Lomas) and L-9 was driven to the
vicinity, ef.the recently acquired safe apartoent which will be used for this
operation inthe future. wren he icarned that the neeting would be held in -
an apartment he got a bad cago cf“nerves, said "I don't like this one bit,®
and cané-verg close to refusing, Rorker finally convinced him that this one
meeting should be held there and that if, after talking things over, L-9
did not feel safe there the place would not be used for further meetings.
rirent at 2017 and, L=$ showed up at 2046, By this time
esicring ty reminding L-9-that the two had elwaye
worked together well by being perfectly frank and open with cach other; B
proposed that 1-5 state tis reasons for being afraid of holding mectings in
a safe apartnent, after which B would:state his reasons in favor of the
proposition, at the end of which L-9 would be allowed to decide whether the
epartment should be used in the future,

2. L-9 ranbled all ever the rap, referred to his many meetings with
his earlier C/O Shrycck, eoretiren’ two or three in one days eaid he had
absolute confidence in B, but didn't trust other people, etc., eto, The
reasons for his allersy to sefehouses did not becara evident so B began his
spiel and held forth on the ¢rod points of the new meeting place -= LS and
B would never'be together except behind these walls -- could not be seen
together «ea cover story for. ase cf the spartrent explained to the portera
Bts presence (she could be cetnted on to spread it around a bit)s there are
two good looking voren Living in ether apartments in the same building which
could explain L-S's tavirg entered if anyone knoving him were to seo him go
An (he 1s a bachelor); the rersen fro; vhon the apartment 49 oub-leased does
not know Bis-nare -cr identity; B's ca: would never te parked in front of the a
house, .ete,, ete, L-9 acknevledze? all this but repeated hie statenent that
he doesn't trust other pecplé, Then it finally cane out, he was under the
Ampression that the apartnent was to be used by B for meeting numerous other
agents =» apparently he coul2 not conceive of our cbteining an apartment to
use for meeting one loné agent. As soon as he was assured that he was the
only agent who would be met there he calmed dow and relaxed noticeably. In
his mind's eye he had been seeing a penetration agent point out the apartment
and causing it to be.watched by the opposition which would eventually catch
L-9 going in. L-9 required E's’ assurances three different times during the
neeting that other persens would not be met there, ‘This caused B to deliver
_& short course on coxrartmeniation and show L-9 that we would considor it
folly to meet more than cxe agent 4n the uazo place, (For the record, it
should be noted that agent DiURIP ray be met there fran time to time -- it
4a not planned that the apartzent .111 be exposed to any other assets),

3. Le9 expleined that he would hava te leave by 2200 hours since he had
to go to tio aineuré to neet an mmran: Zecinictain We showed 5 two
cables received by-the Exbassy announcing thet a "tecnico Polones" would

Le9 and a bit of bald flattery helpe< to do the trick, It was made clear to L=9
that, as he must already know, we are constantly looking for other agents within
the Cuban government and, naturally, in the same Enbessy where he works, He ws
teld that while it muss be apparent to anyone that a DSS officer would bs worth
nore from the standpoint of access to irformation of value than an officer in
L-9's position, Le9, because of his unusual perspicacity, was considered to be
an exceelingly valuable asset... This word —- perspicacity -— did ths trick: he
picked it up and used it (surprisingly stusbling ‘over it in his native Spanish
each time) and "agrecd” that it fit hin to a "I." His flagging spirits were atout
back up to norral when the meeting a ixd,. It 43 clear that he was absolutely
terrified at the thoicht of using a s7fo apartment which he thougi? vould be used
by other agents, Even though ho was <isabused of this idea he was not quite over
the shakes by the end of the evening. At the next necting B is going to digrese
a bit and discuss Spanish literature of the Golden Age with L-9 — anything to
