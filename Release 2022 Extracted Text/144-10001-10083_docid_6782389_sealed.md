ALERT IN ORIENTE PROVINCE BELIEVED TO BE. TERMINATED

The alert in Oriente Province (see 2/0 R196-63) is be-
lieved to be terminated. The alert, apparently -ptompted by
President KENNEDY'S death on 22'November, was pdssibly pre-
scheduled to'terminate on 25 November. There hdve been two orders
which suggest that the alert was destined to be ‘concluded on
25 November; they are:

1) Access to the Coastal Observation Host at Punta
Maisi (20-15N 74-09W) was restricted until 25 November’ because
of the alert (see 2/98[__YR667-63) ; and a

2) Subordinates of Banes, Headquarters: Eastern Naval
District, were to receive further orders on the 25th, presumably
concerning their alert status, (2/0
have been noted in communications. .

There have been no further,references in intercepted communi-
cations to the Alert since 0222Z,on 23 November -(2/991 R667-63) .

It is possible that the restricted access ty the Obsérvation
Post ‘at Punta Maisi extends to other Obsetvatior{ Posts in ‘Oriente
Province such as reported on 23 November when First Army Goastal
Observation Posts were placed in an‘alert $tatus:
(2/LRL R188-63), and that the restriction wad to be lifted on
25 November: py all those posts. . :

Further indigation that the alert has terminated is the fact
that the Cuban Navy-was engaged in an islands wide communications
exercise on 25 November. It is considered ulikély that such an
exercise would be conduéted under alert conditions.

There have been no éurthter references” fo ‘eng alert status
of the (D percent Santiago de Cuba) units which was first ‘ob-
served on 23 November (2/sL[__ yR05~63) » Alt cRAF and Soviet
Forces’Cuba conmunications appear. to be norma] ’ djing this
period, 22-26 November 1963.
