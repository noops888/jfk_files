Re: Superseded Sections of the

Manual of Instructions

NOTE:

Pursuant to a prior SSC request, we furnished them
current MOI Sections 36, 84, 86, 87, 88, 95, 97 and 122.
Due to the sensitive nature of Sections 105, 107 and 130,
these were made available for review only at FBIHQ.

Listed below are the Intelligence Division
representatives and the MOI sections reviewed for this
project:

Section 36-Espionage James W. Johnson cxr-1
Section 84-Registration Act Dennis R. Dickson CI-3
Section 86-Sabotage Louis J. Brune Is-2
Section 87-Investigations of Willian N. Preusse Is-2

Section 97~Voorhis Act.

The revisions.of the MOI requested by SSC consists
of approximately 2,200 pages and is approximately 9" in
height. Due to the bulkiness of these revisions, they are
not being attached to this memorandun.

(FBI) , ‘eaptioned ‘Protection of the President ~ White House
Inquiry."

In regard to the aforementioned, a thorough review of
the files of the Bewark Office of the FBI did not reveal the
existence of a file bearing the caption, "Protection of the
President - White House Inquiry." Hovever, this review did
disclose the existence of a file bearing the caption, "Protection
of the President.” A thorough review of this file failed ta
uncover any womoranda emanating from former SA Leo T. Clark at
any time.

Memorandum.

. By memorandum dated: 10-4-72, attached, it was
indicated that has suggested

a name change for the Crime Records Division to Office

of Public Information or some other more meaningful designation.

SEeueuS It was pointed out that @ suggestion
was in line with informal discussions you (Mr. Bishop)
have had with members of your staff concerning a possible
name change for the Division.
In this connection, Mr. Gray has noted that
he "can think of many reasons for changing the name.
What have been the nature of the reasons for change discussed?"

With the formation of the Computer Systems Division
and the resultant reassignment of the personnel and
the work of the Uniform.Crime Reporting Section, including
the National Crime Information Center/Computerized Criminal
istories file from Crime Records to Computer Systems,

the title "Crime Records," as ‘thas indicated,
is no longer meaningful insofar as the work of this .
Division is concerned. : 7
7 « : 5
“Office of Public Information," which was .
suggested by 7 would inaccurately reflect

the activities and responsibilities of this Division
and could result in confusion with the Office of Public
Information in the Department of Justice. This, of

*“ course, would be undesirable. aa

Reference is made to the memorandum 6f.Mr. Walters to Mr. Felt,

Milton A. Jones, has retired. I believe we can consolidate the Training Programs
Processing Section and the Research and Service Section at FBI Headquarters

This would eliminate one section chief.

As you know, we have recommended and it has been approved that the

SUPERVISORY REORGANIZATI!
NC'TIONS AND PERSONNEL

Reference is made to memorandum L. M. Walters to Mr. Felt,
dated December 14, 1972, in captioned matter.

Bureau Library at FBI Headquarters

A survey has been made of the library, its books, facility cud
personnel. At the present time, the library is housed in six rooms in the 4200
corridor at FBI Headquarters and has a iva of the following:

Inspector Bernand M.\Suttler, GS-16
Librarian Iona @xSwam, GS-9,

Assistant Libr

ow Plaonor
om Hicancr L, we

Secretary Connie.Hutchison, GS-4 (position is GS-5)
3 Librari ‘echnicians
AliéaBrand, GS-4 (on extended leave without pay - due to illness)
Alley Brand, G8 GS-3 (GS-4 position)
Ester Villanueva, GS-4

From a survey of the books, all books can be removed from the
library to the library at Quantico with exception to certain reference books.
and out-of-town telephone directories which are necessary to be maintained at FBI
Headquarters for ready-reference purposes by the Bureau staff at Headquarters.
From the survey, it was determined these books can be m: intained j “a two coms”
presently occupied by the library, thus freeing four roozh BS: surpl is spate” + -

In the library is a lending library which has about 100 members. |
These members pay $1 every six months for membership dues and have the privilege
of using the library. Because of the minor use of this lending library, .I am-proposin
that we phase out this part of the library during the next six months, removing the
books at the end of that period to Quantico.

Re: Supervisory Reorganization of
Functions and Personnel

Crime Research Division

From the‘survey; I believe that the two library technicians, who are.

a presently, assigned tothe lib: can handle the remaining reference books and
telephone directories and ‘that when Miss Brand retirns t6 work's decision cai
made as to what can be done with her.

Since practically all of the library will be transferred to Quantico,
it will be necessary to transfer certain employees of the library unit.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

(1) That all the, books with the exception of the reference books 7
lending library, and out-of-toitiy telephone directories be transferred to the Academy
at Quantico.

(2) That authority be granted to gradually phase out the lending
library over the next six-month period.

" (3) That Inspector Bernard M. Suttler be transferred to Quantico

WITED STA” GOVERNMENT

" SUBJECT

By memorandum dated 10~4-72, attached, it was ao
indicated that Fletcher D. Thompson, SAC, Omaha, has suggested

a name change for the Crime Records Division to Office
of Public Information or some other more meani gful designati

It was pointed out that Mr. Thompson's suggestion
was in line with informal discussions you (Mr. Bishop)

have had with members of your staff concerning a possible
name change for the Division.

In this connection, Mr. Gray has noted that
he "can think of many reasons for changing the name.
What have been the nature of the reasons for change discussed?”

5

With the formation of the Computer Systems Division
and the resultant reassignment of the personnel and
the work of the Uniform Crime Reporting Section, including
the National Crime Information Center/Computerized Criminal
Histories file from Crime Records to Computer Systems,
the title "Crime Records," as Mr. Thompson has indicated,
is no longer meaningful insofar as the work of this
Division is concerned. . sett :

"Office of Public Information," which was i
suggested by Mr. Thompson, would inaccurately reflect
the activities and responsibilities of this Division
and could result in confusion with the Office of Public
Information in the Department of Justice. This, of
course, would be undesirable. 7

FROM W. M, FELT : :

Pursuant to your instructions, Assistant Director Bishop is
being teraporarily attached to the Training Division at Quantico for special
assignment until the effective date of his retirement, 2-1-73,

seamen ty

Mr. Bishop will be assigned to the research and development of
a major case practical problem for use in the National Academy. This
is extremely important because our experience indicates that most of the
officers attending the Academy are unable to understand and handle the
ramifications of major cases. Mr. Bishop, with his extensive field back-

- ._ ground, plus his familiarity with news media problems, is ideally suited

v2 to handle this assignment.
te Tf he has time, Mr. Bishop will also analyze and develop

‘ meaningful practical cases which will enable new agents to meet present~

day needs.

I have arranged with Mr. Jenkins for suitable office facilities
to be used by Mr. Bishop at Quantico and haveAnstructed Bishop to.report
to Mr. Jenkins on Monday, 12-4-72.

Inspector Wilburnx}DeBruler is being diverted fron his current
inspection assignment in the Office of Legal Counsel to begin an immediate
survey of the Crime Research Division to determine the feasibility of the

_ transfer of its functions to other divisions or to your office.

OBSERVATIONS

Agent personnel and supervisory functions have been analyzed and dealt with
in the foregoing proposed reallocations; clerical functions have not; It is suggested -
.that clerical functions and personnel now simply move with the Agent desksand_-
‘units to which"they are ched, Questions of space also have not been covered.
and it is readily apparent that a substantial portion of the functions and personnel
suggested for transfer to Training Division might feasibly operate at Quantico”
(e.g, Library, Special Productions and Publications Unit), Five units of Training -.
Division are now located at Headquarters and the Research Unit of Research and :
Service Section proposed herein for transfer to Training Division, likewise should -
remain at Headquarters, Accordingly, SA Har old P, Leinbaugh, formerly.in the’
Front Office of Crime Research Division, has been pro transfer to Trainin
Division in order to act}, during this transition period, as a special
of functions that may be divided between Headquarters and Quantic

:

he questions of adequacy of clerical personnel, space reallocation, and

Nw BAS BUPR Maw and sunctions to Quantico demand greater study and Gene


* as Training Division is scheduled for regular annual inspection next.weék, these.
matters Will be gone into in depth in connection with that inspection and coordinated
in consultation with Administrative Division, It is the purpose of this mernorandum
to promptly effect the desired transfers of functions among affected Divisions in -
“- order‘to provide for- immediate: routing.of mail and. upper level xeview,.and,
ision, of the work product of all units previously composing Crime Research

Division,

wreadjust., Jagree that the Research and Sers

Division. Ido not believe that this Section should be transferred to Quantico,
however, because there is daily need for access to files and.other material ~~
. at Headquarters and occasional contacts with the public. Furthermore, there’-
aan _ is no available space at Quantico except in the Library Building. Accordingly, . ¢
wt liu 3 peeommend that the. FBIH@ Library be moved into.the, Library, Building at,
Quantico. We would need to retain at FBIHQ the telephone directories and
encyclopedias which are used on a daily basis by other Divisions. The
space into which the FBYIHQ Library was to have been-moved in the 9th and D -
a Building can be used and in fact is badly needed by the Domestic Intelligence : :
Division which is very crowded. : : : che

I recommend that you approve now the transfer of functions and
that any necessary realignment of personnel be considered by separate ~ eeaee
memoranda. ~ : : PEE eee

he vas asked how many men vorked under him on his Squad, he
told Epstein that he desired to etonsult with the FBI
representative who had accompanied him to the interview but
whe was not present ducing the actual interview, that
representative remaining in an outer lobby of the SSC quarters,
Belter requested this consultation privilege as he believed
the question vas outside the indicated scope of the interviai.
Epstein indicated he was withdrawing the question, thus
eliminating the necessity for the consultation,

: Belter vas questioned and furnished information
concerning the organization of WFO, from the Spécial Agent

in Charge down to the squad level, Belter indicated that
there vera several squads handling criminal cases, some
handling applicant-type investigations, and other squads
handling security work, He indieated that the seeurity squads
were under a security coordinator, Ludvig W. R. Oberndorf,
now deceased.

Epstein advised Belter that the SSC Staff had
vead Belter's deposition in the Halperin case, (Morton H.
Halperin, et al, vs. Henry A. Kissinger, et al, United States
District Court, District of Columbia Civil Action File
Number 1187-73.) On the basis of the deposition, Upstein
indicated he was familiay with the administrative procedure
for instituting telephone survelllances and asked Belter
about. the administrative procedures for instituting microphone
surveillances. It vas Belter's reply ‘that the administrative
procedures were essentially the same for both types of
surveillances.

Epstein then had Belter recite the procedure fron
when an SA would request from FBI Headquarters by form Letters

authority for installing a miccophone surveillance. Eelter
told how the Headquarters vould first authorize the ficld to

RE: INTERVIEW OF RETIRED FBI SA BY SSC

conduct a feasibility survey, results of which would be
furnished Headquarters. Thereafter, if the installation was
feasible and justified, Headquarters would authorize by
correspondence the installation. Epstein asked whether the
authorizing communication from Headquarters would mention

that the Attorney General (AG) had authorized the surveillance.
Belter told Epstein that in recent years he believed that the
Bureau communication authorizing a surveillance would indicate
that the AG authorization had been obtained; but Belter could
not recall whether or not this indication was shown during
1964. Belter also told Epstein that at one time he thought
that former FBI Director Hoover did not need to have AG approval
in advance for a specific microphone surveillance, Epstein
indieated he was already aware of this.

Epstein then inquired concerning a microphone
surveillance which the FBI had installed at the Willard Hotel
in Washington, D. C., concerning King. Belter was unable
to pinpoint when this occurred and told Epstein that he,
Belter, was bypassed in practically all .metters relating to
this surveillance, The entire matter was handled by Security
Coordinator Oberndorf and Belter never saw any of the correspond-
ence relating thereto, Belter was only asked to furnish some
support personnel from his Squad for the purpose of monitoring
the surveillance. In response to further specific questions,
Belter advised Epstein that he did not see any correspondence,
logs, tapes, or any other material relating to this surveillance.

Epstein inquired about the procedure of an Inspector
checking on such a surveillance at the time of a periodic
inspection of WFO. He asked if the Inspector would examine
the required correspondence relating to all microphone
surveillanees the office had conducted. Belter replied that
an Inspector would look over matters of this nature but that

~3-



SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)
RE: INTERVIEW OF RETIRED FBI SA BY SSC

in the case of the King microphone surveillance, as with
certain other extremely sensitive ones, Oberndorf would have
poasession of the correspondence and Belter would ba unaware
of any examination of such correspondence by an Inspector.
Belter explained that this was part of the security precautions
taken in highly sensitive matters which vere restricted

within WFO to a need-to-know basis.

Epstein inquired as to whether Belter knew of any
other microphone surveillance on King in the Washington, D. C.,
area at any time and Belter replied that he did not know of
any. Belter was asked if he wes aware of any interest or
participation by the Washington, D. C., Police Department in
the microphone surveillance at the Willard Hotel and he
responded that he was not aware of same,

Epstein inquired as to the actual installation of
the microphone surveillance at the Willard Hotel and wanted
to know who performed the installation. It was Belter's
reeollection that the installation was made by 84 Wilfred
Bergeron, probably assisted by SA William D, Campbell. Epstein
volunteered the name of SA Richard Suter and this refreshed
Belter's recollection to the extent that Belter indicated that
Suter also probably assisted. On Epstein's inquiry as to the
whereabouts of these three individuals, Belter advised that
Bergeron is retired, residing in Bethesda, Maryland; Campbell
is assigned at FBI Headquarters; and Suter is assigned to the
Houston Field Office.

Epstein inquired whether Bergeron mentioned King's
name when Bergeron asked for assistance of support personnel
for monitering purposes and Belter replied that King's name
was nentioned.

At the close of the interview, Epstein remarked that,
‘We may be in touch with you again."

By memorandum dated 6-4-75 you were advised that Me
@
{

captioned Committee was preparing what they termed case studies on {
COINTELPROS in four separate areas, The areas defined were Black fie
Panther Party in San Francisco, White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan of J BY “i
Mississippi, the Professor Morris J. Starsky incident, and the A
Fred Hampton case (Black Panther Party leader in Chicago who was

killed during a police raid in Chicago, Ilinois).

\

Mr, Lester B, Seidel advised SA Paul V. Daly 6-9-5 ’ Wy
that in addition to the aforementioned areas he also wanted to include the
Muhammad Kenyatta case.in Philadelphia. As.an observation, two of the
areas cited by Mr. Seidel are areas where the Bureau currently is facing { 4.
lawsuits, namely, the Hampton and Kenyatta cases, and a third area is
one which we could well be involved in a lawsuit, that being the Starsky «
ease. Mr, Seidel indicated the Bureau can expect correspondence from
the Committee concerning these matters.

The purpose of this memorandum is to advise that

On theevening of 5-29-75, Lester B. Seidell telephonically
advised SA Paul V. Daly of this Division that in accordance with the
"guidelines" existing between the Committee and the various intelligence
agencies under review, he was giving notice that he as a representative
of the Committee was going to San Francisco in approximately two to three
weeks, and it was his intention to interview SAC Charles W. Bates, former
SA David E. Todd, and former Assistant to the Director Alan H. Belmont.

steps to release the Agents from any existing employment or secrecy

of each of the interviewees as to their knowledge and participation in cane al
intelligence activities directed against the Black Panther Party. With rega:

to this discussion, he specifically mentioned a Bureau airtel to San Francisco
dated 5-11-70, titled “Counterintelligence and Special Operations (Research

in writing, which would coincide with the aforementioned topic of interview.
He described these interviews as being "abuse" interviews which according
to the Committee's understanding precludes the presence of an agency
representative during interview. However, an Agent may be available for
consultation purposes.

Mr. Seidell was advised by SA Daly that former Assistant

to the Director Belmont was in poor health and that before attempting interview
of Mr. Belmont, he should ascertain his current physical condition. Mr. Seidell
requested SA Daly determine Mr. Belmont's physical condition. Assistant
Director Cleveland advised SA Daly on 5-30-75 that Mr. Belmont was very
seriously ill and was suffering from the Shy Drager Syndrome. This informa-
tion was brought to the attention of John Elliff, Task Force Director on
Domestic Intelligence Activities of captioned Committee, and Elliff expressed
dismay that Seidell had made an inquiry concerning the interview of Belmont.
Elliff requested that we not take any action concerning Seidell's request as

O Belmont at this time.

Former SA David E. Todd had previously contacted this
Division and as set forth in memorandum dated 5-16-75 from Legal Counsel
to J. B. Adams, he was advised of his rights, the existence of an employment
secrecy agreement sighed by him, of the provisions of Attorney General
Order 501-73, and to his right to a private attorney. He was also advised
that an Agent would be made available for consultation during the interview
if he so desired. Mr. Todd did not indicate at this point whether he was
desirous of having a Bureau representative available for consultation during
interview. Todd, according to Seidell, stated he would not consider to be
interviewed in the absence of a release of a secrecy agreement by the Bureau.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

(1) That former SA David E. Todd, Assistant Director
Robert E. Gebhardt, and SAC Charles W. Bates be released from their
employment and secrecy agreement$for purposes of a staff interview concerning
our Cointelpro activities against the Black Panther Party.

This is to record meeting of Task Force (TF) Director Sec'y —
leaders with Mr. James Wilderotter, Associate Counsel to the
President, at the Executive Office Building on 6/13/75.

Aforementioned meeting was called and chaired by
Mr. Wilderotter, and was attended by representatives of The
White House, Justice, Defense, FBI, CIA, and State. Project
Manager W. 0. Cregar and Supervisor J. P. Thomas, Section CI-2,
INTD, represented the FBI. (vb

Mr. Wilderotter reported that the Senate Select f if
Committee (SSC) has agreed to specifically identify a limited
number of "abuse areas" which it will investigate from top to
bottom. “Notices” should be issued to agencies very shortly
este certain terms and specifying the SSC targets. If

these areas can be fully investigated, with assistance of the
intelligence community, the SSC agrees to not extend its inquiries
beyond the specified areas, If the SSC does so limit its
inquiries, this will be to the advantage of the intelligence
community in that it will minimize the SSC's straying into
various nonpertinent matters; the TFs can present the intelli-
.gence community's side on the topics examined; the TFs should

be able to expedite the Committee's inquiries and thereby limit
the duration of the SSC investigation.

The FBI has responsibility for the TBs on "Political
Abuses," TF leader Insp. H. E. Helgeson, and "Use of Notional
Organizations, " TF leader Supv. J. P. Thomas. We cannot fully
address either topic until receiving the SSC notices defining
the extent of the proposed inquiries.

Contrary to the initial concept of the TFs, they will
not prepare comprehensive papers regarding their topics, but in
some areas it may be advantageous for a TF to prepare an
"opening statement" type paper for the a

Memorandum to Me. W. R. Wannall
Re: SENSTUDY 75
62-116395

The purpose of the TF and functions of the TF
leaders were discussed. Briefly, each TF leader is to become
a substantive expert on the particular topic assigned to him
(e.g. political abuses), locate all documents, identify
potential witnesses, develop strategy for presenting subject
matter to the SSC and work to minimize any delays which might
be caused by the Third Agency Rule. TF leaders will not
themselves be witnesses unless their activities other than as
TF leaders are subjects of testimony. TF leaders will, in
consultation with legal counsel, define terms pertinent to
their topics. They will outline directly to the SSC staff,
insofar as the SSC is receptive, the scope and direction of
pertinent inquiry, who is and is not competént to testify,
what documents are available, and what areas may or may not be
pertinent to the Committee's interests. TF leaders will prepare
themselves to be able to answer any inquiries from the
White House on their topics. Although TF leaders must know
the location of a1l1 documents pertinent, the documents them~
selves will be made available to the SSC by the agency having
custody of same and each agency may negotiate with the SSC
regarding access by the Committee to material on a case by
case basis. The agencies will, of course, coordinate first
with their own legal counsel and then with the White House
before releasing documents.

On sensitive matters, such as notional organizations
or proprietary organizations, the SSC has agreed that it will
not be necessary for agencies to furnish the names of U. S.
citizens and companies who have cooperated with the U. S. unless
those persons or companies have received notoriety (e.g. Hughes
Tool Company, Sam Giancana). It is reportedly understood that
agencies must protect their ongoing operations. Agencies are
free to attempt to negotiate with the SSC regarding the extent
and form of their responses,

Attached is a copy of an intelligence community staff
memorandum 6/10/75 showing the TF assignments and, in the left
margin notes as to the agencies expected to have input into
each subject.

On 6-10-75, K. William O'Connor, Special Counsel for — Precter sec'y_—
Intelligence Coordination, Office of the Deputy Attorney General, furnished
Inspector John B. Hotis a copy of a letter from Senator Frank Church (D-Idaho)
to the Attorney General dated 5-28-75, requesting any files or documents
in the Department or the FBI concerning five members of the Senate Select
Committee on Intelligence Activities. The files requested pertain to Senators
Gary Hart (D-Colo.) , Walter D. Huddleston (D-Ky.), Charles McC. Mathias
(R-Md.), Walter F. Mondale (D-Minn.), and Robert Morgan (D-N.C.).
Senator Church emphasized that the request is made pursuant to Senate
Resolution 21, which established the Select Committee and not under the
Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).

Mr. O'Connor also provided a draft of a proposed response
to the Senator's letter by the Attorney General. General Levi pledges
cooperation in this matter and suggests that the scope of the request should
be clarified. He also states that while the request is not made under FOIA, _}
exemptions in the Act indicate the kind of concerns the Committee might —~
,{ want the Department to bring to its attention before disclosure is made.
‘The implication is that certain information in the files, particularly materials
hich would violate individual privacy may be withheld.

It should also be noted that the Attorney General intends to
advise Senator Church that he is preparing the necessary materials and
asks for early discussions to determine how best to proceed. Accordingly,
a it is felt that we should promptly review any files that might exist concerning
© each of the above-named Senators and be prepared to furnish appropriate

Dear Mr. Attorney” General:

On behalf of the Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental
Operations With Respect to Intelligence Activities, we write to
request the delivery forthwith to the members whose names are listed
Hi in the attachment hereto of any files on them or documents concern-
i ing them that are in the possession, custody or control of ‘the
Department of Justice, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

.This request is made pursuant to the mandate of the Senate,
contained in S. Res. 21. That Resolution requires us to investigate
the "conduct of.domestic intelligence or counterintelligence opera—
‘tions against United Stetes citizens by'the Federal Bureau of
Investigation or any other Federal agency".

One means of accomplishing this objective is to review the
material, if any, which the Department of Justice has gathered on
members of the United States Senate.

‘This request is made pursuant to the Committee's mandate and

not under the Freedom of Information Act. The exemptions to that 7
_ Act are designed to allow federal agencies and departments the

degree of confidentiality necessary to conduct the ongoing activities

of the Executive Branch, not to prevent a duly constituted Congres-

sional Committee from understanding the nature, legality, and

propriety of some of those activities. Whether as a matter of agree-

ment between the Committee and the Department some material that may

be in any such files should be withheld depends upon an analysis of

the weight of the particular reason put forward for the proposed

withholding balanced against the Committee's need. to exercise its {> EL

mandate.

I have just today received your letter dated May 28.
It apparently reached the Department’ of Justice on June 8.
It requests "the delivery forthwith to the members whose
: names are listed in the attachment hereto of any files on
them or documents concerning them that are in the possession,
custody, or control of the Department of Justice, including
the Federal Bureau of Investigation."
The Department wants to cooperate with you on this
Matter. But I think we first ought to clarify the scope
of your request. _T assume, for example, that your request
is not intended to encompass copies of all letters between
the membe: ; and the Department. I would suggest that we can
xreach an understanding on issues of this kind by consulta- :
tions between us.

, Your letter says that "Whether as a matter of agree-

ment between the Committee and the Department some material
J that may be in any such files should be withheld depends upon
San analysis of the weight of the particular reason put forward
for the proposed withholding balanced against the Committee's : |
Bad need to exercise its mandate." tt
I take that to mean you would like us to go over the
files and to raise with the Committee such problems with dis-

closure as may or may not exist. I realize this request is

ENCLOSURE}

not made under the Freedom of Information Act, but as we
: review the material in the file, exemptions in the act
indicate, I think, the kind of concerns the Committee might
want the Department to bring to its attention before dis-
closure is made. For example, if material in a file would
violate the privacy of an individual other than the member
if it were revealed, would the Committee insist that such
material be revealed?

We are beginning to prepare the material so that
no time will be wasted get would like discussions to
degin quickly so that we can agree on how to proceed. That

done, I would think that we could deliver the documents that —

you havé requested.

MEMORANDUM

SUBJECT: Electronic Surveillance Legislation

1, Over a dozen bills have been introduced in Congress to date
aimed at restricting electronic surveillance conducted on national security
grounds. Although impelled by concern for the Fourth Amendment rights of
American citizens, the major bills in this area (S. 743, H.R. 141, H.R. 214)
are characterized by a heavy-handed approach which poses a serious threat
to the exploitation of foreign SIGINT sources, both within the United States

and overseas. (Signals intelligence subsumes communications intelligence
and electronic intelligence.) :

: 2. The’ 1968 Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act (18 U.S.C.
2510, et seq.) established certain procedures which require the Government
to obtain a court order issued on probable cause prior to conducting wire or
oral communication interception in the investigation of certain offenses.. In
section 2511(3) of that Act, Congress specifically disavows any limitation on
the constitutional powers of the President in national security matters and
recognizes that the President has inherent constitutional eur to engage
in certain foreign intelligence activities:

(n)othing contained in this chapter or in
section 605 of the Communications Act of

1934 shall limit the constitutional power of
the President ... to obtain foreign intelli-
gence information deemed essential to the
security of the United States, or to protect
national security information against foreign
intelligence activities. (emphasis added)

The emphasized language implicitly recognizes that foreign intelligence
surveillances may be distinguished from national security surveillances
aimed at the discovery and prosecution of criminal conspiracies ‘and activity.

3. In reliance on these Presidential powers and congressional

recognition thereof, foreign intelligence signal and communication interceptions
may be conducted within the United States without judicial warrant.

4, Sentiment that the provisions of 18 U.S.C. -2511(3) (quoted above). -
are incompatible with Fourth Amendment rights has spawned a Senate bill and
over a dozen House bills (some of these identical) aimed at closing what the
sponsors view as "the national security loophole" in current surveillance laws.
A distinctive approach to national security surveillance is taking shape which
would prohibit the use of warrantless surveillance for any reason whatsoever,
treating national security surveillance under a single rubric, without distin-
guishing between gathering foreign intelligence on the one hand, and national
security surveillances aimed at the discovery and prosecution of criminality,

_on the other.

(a) ‘gs. 743 "743 by Senators Nelson and Kennedy would amend
18 U.S. Cc. 2510, et seq., seq., as follows: First, repeal 18 U.S.C.

’ 2511(3) thereby withdrawing whatever congressional recognition
that section gave the foreign intelligence surveillance powers of
the President. Second, prohibit intercepting the communications
of an American citizen or alien admitted for permanent residence
until a prior judicial warrant is obtained issued on probable cause
that a specific crime, e.g., espionage, has been or is about to be

‘committed. Third, prohibit intercepting the communication of a
foreign power or its agent until a prior judicial warrant is obtained
by establishing probable cause (a) that such interception is
necessary to protect the national defense (note narrower standard
than national security); (b) that the interception will be consistent
with the international obligations of the United States; and (c) that
the target is a foreign power or foreign agent. (A foreign agent is
defined as any person, not an American citizen or alien lawfully
admitted for permanent residence, whose activities are intended
to serve the interests of a foreign power and to undermine the
national defense. Each application for such an interception would
be made to the D. C. Federal District Court on personal and written
authorization of the President and would provide detailed informa-
tion on the target, the purposes and justification of the interception.)
Upon court approval, only the FBI would be authorized to intercept
the communication. Fourth, require that,every American citizen

_ targetted be informed of the specifics of the surveillance within a
month of the last authorized interception. (This disclosure could
be postponed if the Government satisfies the court that the target
is engaged in a continuing criminal enterprise or that disclosure
would endanger national security interests. A foreign power or
its agent need not be informed of interceptions.) Fifth, require the
Attorney General to report to the Congress, at least quarterly, the
details of each interception undertaken on national security
grounds, to be filed with the Senate Foreign Relations and
Judiciary Committees and the House International Relations and
Judiciary Committees. :

NW 65360- Docld:32989609 Page 125 ceUanen 2



(b) H. R. 141 by Rees aesare Kastenmeier, Chairman of
the House Subcommittee on Courts, Civil Liberties, and the
. Administration of Justice, which has legislative jurisdiction for
- surveillance, is similar to the above bill. It would repeal
18 U.S.C. 2511(3) and amend Title 18 to permit communications
interception in national security cases only under court order
issued on probable cause that an individual has committed one of
several enumerated offenses or is engaged in activities intended to
serve the interests of a foreign principal and to undermine the
national security. (From the language of the bill, it could be
a¥gued that the foreigri agent's activities would have to constitute
a criminal offense before a warrant could be issued.) The bill
~does not mention the communications of a foreign power.
Each application for an interception would have to be authorized
by the Attorney General and made to a Federal judge of com-
petent jurisdiction. The targetted individual would be informed
of the surveillance within ninety days. The President, Attorney
General, and all Government agencies would be required to |
supply Congress, through the Senate Judiciary and Foreign
:., Relations Committees and the House Judiciary and International
* Relations Committees, any information regarding any iva ena
‘applied for.

“(c) H. R. 214 by Mr. Mosher and seven identical bills
co-sponsored by over 70 Congressmen from both parties, would
prohibit any interception of communications, surreptitious entry,
mail-opening, or the procuring and inspection of records of
telephone, bank, credit, medical, or other business or private .
transactions of any individual without court order issued on
probable cause that a crime has been committed. Like S. 743
and H.R. 141, reviewed above, H.R. 214 would repeal 18 U.S.C.
2511(3). Unlike the above bills, H.R. 214 does not provide for non-
law enforcement surveillance. It would also strike out pro-
visions for summary procedures for intercepting communications
during emergenciés and would require that detailed information
on each application for a communication interception be reported
to _ House and Senate Judiciary Committees.

5. Intelligence Community Interests: These bills, through :
imposing judiciary administration over all surveillance, would impair existing

responsibility to conduct electronic surveillance in gathering foreign positive
intelligence, which now reaches wholly domestic communications, those both
transmitted and received within the United States; wholly foreign communications,
those both transmitted and received abroad; and transnational communications,
international communications received in or transmitted from the United States.

NW 65360 Docld:32989609 Page 126 : erpary



SIGINT provides a broad range of foreign intelligence ranging from early
warning indicators to the most mundane information. The importance of any
single intercept or series of interceptions cannot be anticipated in advance;
therefore, the probable cause standard and the proposed requirements of
"particularity" are inappropriate in connection with this method of foreign intelli-
gence collection. (Furthermore, the House bills would impair existing responsibility

for using other intelligence gathering techniques against foreign subjects within the
United States, e.g., medicepts, photo surveillance, etc.) i

Effect on Intelligence Community Interests: The bills reviewed above
would See restrict domestic communications interception for foreign intelligence’
gathering purposes; raise serious questions respecting authority to intercept
transnational communications; and would even raise questions concerning the

foreign intelligence community's authority to conduct electronic surveillance abroad
free from judicial intrusion or other conditions. (Moreover, the House bills

would restrict the use of other intelligence gathering techniques against foreign
targets within the United States.)

(a) Domestic Electronic Surveillance: An operation
mounted against a foreign target within the United States to
.. gather foreign positive intelligence would apparently not meet the .
* court test unless the specific message targetted involved an anti-
cipated, demonstrable and direct threat io the national defense.
S. 743 explicitly confers interception authority to the FBI alone.
It also explicitly raises the issue of the consistency of surveillance
., with international obligations, e.g., the Vienna Convention, and
thus challenges the position taken by the State Department that no
current international obligation precludes targetting foreign
facilities within the United States.

(b) Transnational Electronic Surveillance: Proposed
legislation would apparently subject the interception of trans-
national communications from a situs within the United States to
-the probable cause standard. It could also provide grounds for
arguing that interceptions of transnational communications from
facilities outside the United States would be subject to the same
standard. :

(¢) Foreign Electronic Surveillance: The bills
reviewed above are broadly written and the prohibitions are not

‘expressly limited to the territory of the United States. While the
reach of this legislation should be subject to the built-in limitation
that the authority of a federal court to issue warrants is confined
to its territorial limits, repeal of 18 U.S.C. 2511(3) and the
articulation of probable cause standards for foreign intelligence
gathering activities could have a grave impact on overseas
intelligence collection by bringing into play a body of exclusionary
rule case law (developed in ruling on the admissability in a
Federal criminal trial of evidence obtained overseas by electronic
surveillance). Suffice it, here, to say that this could result in

Y NW 65360 Docld:32989609 Page 127


" NW-65360 Docld:3298960: Page 128

subjecting overseas foreign intelligence surveillance to the proposed
probable cause standards as a test of the "reasonableness" required
by Fourth Amendment protections. Moreover, this legislation could
raise complex questions in situations where an element of the inter-
ception process falls within the jurisdiction of the federal court, e.g.,
the physical presence of the surveillance device. Even if these bills

‘would not directly affect authority to conduct foreign electronic

+ surveillance, they could ultimately weaken it by raising the
opportunity to argue that this authority rests only on three
bases-~assertion of inherent Presidential intelligence-gathering

- powers, congressional recognition and judicial acceptance. Repeal
of 18 U.S.C. 2511(3) may be viewed as weakening the argument that
Congress has recognized foreign intelligence gathering authority
inherent in the President and delegated to his Executive branch agents.

.%. Summary:

~-Proposed legislation would repeal 18 U.S.C. 2511(3) and would
impose judicial administration of a "probable cause" standard over foreign intelli-
: gence electronic surveillance. At the very least, this would restrict communications
_ interceptions against foreign targets within the United States to situations
involving an anticipated, demonstrable and direct threat to the national defense.
Also, this would probably subject the interception of transnational communica-
tions, from either an overseas or domestic situs, to the same judicial standards.
Finally, this would raise difficult questions concerning the ability of CIA, NSA,
and the service cryptologic agencies to conduct electronic surveillance overseas
against foreign targets without conforming to the standards of Fourth Amendment
"reasonableness" articulated in this legislation. In sum, enactment of proposed
- legislation would severely restrict the collection and processing of foreign -
SIGINT and would seriously impair the production of all-source intelligence.

--By repealing 18 U.S.C. 2511(3) and by introjécting the judiciary

into the field of foreign intelligence gathering, proposed legislation raises a

. constitutional challenge insofar as it purports to withdraw sanction of and
place limitations on the President's inherent power to conduct foreign
surveillance, This infringement could undermine the Executive sources of
authority upon which the intelligence community depends. To be sure, the
proposed requirement of prior judicial authorization of foreign intelligence

. surveillances is altogether impractical. But the fundamental constitutional
objection is that it purports to share Executive authority with judicial officers
having no expertise in or responsibility for national security or foreign

affairs. The nécessity of a foreign intelligence surveillance is simply
inappropriate for judicial resolution. It is a matter committed to the Executive
branch by-the Constitution and an area for which there are no judicially
manageable standards. An arrangement by which federal judges decide
what foreign intelligence the President may have in his conduct of foreign



relations is incompatible with the Chief Executive's inherent foreign .
intelligence gathering powers. Since this Presidential authority is
constitutional in nature and stems from a fundamental separation of
governmental powers, a Congressional attempt to require its sharing
with the judiciary would certainly lead to protracted constitutional
litigation. Moreover, Congress implicitly authorized the use of elec~
tronic surveillance in-foreign intelligence activities and this legislation
would circumscribe the very functions which Congress intended the
Agency to perform. :

The Attorney General

NOTE:

By memorandum 5/6/75, we advised the AG that the
position paper in question was an internal deliberative document
which was the direct basis for a formal statement on FBI
authority to conduct internal security investigations embodied
in a memorandum from the Director, FBI, to the AG dated
8/7/73, On this basis, we felt it was inappropriate that
the requested position paper be made available to the SSC,

In conversation between Deputy Assistant Attorney
General O'Connor and SA Daly, referred to above, O'Connor
indicated that it was the decision of the Department to make
this paper available to the SSC. Since we have already expressed
our position concerning the paper to the AG, it does not appear
that there would be any purpose served disputing his decision,
However, since it is an internal deliberative document, it is
felt that the paper should be made available for review rather
than given outright to the SSC, Also, we are setting a
condition that no notes be taken during the initial review,
subject to negotiation of further requests by the Committee,

SCOPE OF FBI AUTHORITY,
JURISDICTION AND RESPONSIBILITY IN
DOMESTIC INTELLIGENCE INVESTIGATIONS

BACKGROUND

Over the past several months there have been an increasing
number of public statements made from various quarters questioning
or contesting authority and jurisdiction of the FBI to conduct
domestic intelligence-type investigations, particularly where
there is no clear-cut’ legislative authority apparent. One of the
most searching inquiries was contained in a paper presented by
Professor John T. Elliff at a two-day conference at Princeton
University in October, 1971, sponsored by the Committee for Public
Justice.

Professor Elliff addressed himself to the matter of
FBI authority derived from legislative enactments as opposed to
that derived from Presidential directives. He went into some
detail in connection with the Presidential directive issued by
President Roosevelt in September, 1939, which was subsequently
reiterated on three occasions. Elliff questioned whether Roosevelt
was even aware that he was shifting FBI authority from congressional
enactment to Presidential directive when he issued the September,
1939, directive since he probably assumed he had granted such
authority in 1936 when he requested intelligence investigations
of fifth columnists. Elliff accused the FBI of magnifying the
September, 1939, directive into a definitive order

Over a long period of time Senator Sam J. Ervin has been
probing into the nature and extent of FBI gathering and retention
of domestic intelligence information. In April, 1971,

Senator Ervin made a request of the Department of Justice to

furnish detailed information concerning the Department's (the FBI's)
policy and practice on investigating and reporting the political
beliefs and activities of persons not under investigation for
violating the laws. Of particular interest was specific infor-
mation on the constitutional authority and power exercised by the
Executive Branch to conduct such investigations.

Subsequently, Senator Ervin announced that he intended to
propose legislation to prohibit the FBI from investigating any
person without his consent, unless the Government has reason to
believe that person has committed a crime or is about to commit
a crime. Other Congressmen have either introduced or announced
plans to introduce legislation or resolutions calling for special
activities, particularly in the area of domestic intelligence
operations.

NW 65360 Docld:32989609 Page 136



Based on these developments it became apparent that
an in-depth study was in order to clarify any misconceptions
which might have grown up concerning the scope of FBI intelligence
and investigative authority, particularly where it concerns
domestic organizations and/or individuals. A detailed and
exhaustive study has now been completed, and the following is
the result of that study.

AUTHORITY DERIVED PRESIDENTIAL DIRECTIVES

In the testimony of the late Director J. Edgar Hoover
before the House Subcommittee on Appropriations on March 2, 1972,
under the subject of justifications on page 2 the statement is
made that "The FBI's responsibilities in the domestic intelligence
field are authorized under legislative enactments, Presidential
directives and instructions of the Attorney General. They include
investigative jurisdiction over matters relating to espionage
counterespionage, sabotage, treason, sedition, subversion, and
related internal security functions. Subjects of investigation
include the activities of the Communist Party, USA, communist
front groups and other totalitarian organizations, including
individuals or groups who are alleged either to seek overthrow
of the Government of the United States by force or violence or to
conspire against the rights of citizens." Similar language has
appeared in Mr. Hoover's testimony in prior years.

It is assumed that the Presidential directives referred
to in Mr. Hoover's testimony are (1) Directive dated September 6,
1939, and reiterated January 8, 1943, July 24, 1950, and
December 15, 1953; (2) Executive Order 10450 dated April 27, 1953
(and amended but not yet implemented by Executive Order 11605
dated July 2, 1971).

It is believed that there is a misconception concerning
the extent of jurisdiction or authority which was conveyed to
the FBI by the Presidential directive dated September 6, 1939.
All of the succeeding directives appear to be hinged on the one
issued in September, 1939. Therefore, the language of that first
directive becomes a very important issue. Perhaps even more
important are the circumstances leading up to the issuance of f
that directive and the intent of the President at the time
it was issued.

Prior to the issuance of the September, 1939, directive
President Roosevelt issued a statement or confidential directive
to the heads of the various Government Departments on June 26,
1939, which stated, "It is my desire that the investigation of
all espionage, counterespionage, and sabotage matters be controlled
and handled by the Federal Bureau of Investigation of the
Department of Justice, the Military Intelligence Division of the
War Department, and the Office of Naval Intelligence of the
Navy Department. The Directors of these three agencies are to
function as a committee to coordinate their activities."

Sas

NW 65360 Docld:32989609 Page 137



"No investigations should be conducted by any investi-
gative agency of the Government into matters involving actually
or potentially any espionage, counterespionage, or sabotage,
except by the three agencies mentioned above."

"IT shall be glad if you will instruct the heads of all
other investigative agencies than the three named, to refer
immediately to the nearest office of the Federal Bureau of
Investigation any data, information or material that may come to
their notice bearing directly or indirectly on espionage,
counterespionage, or sabotage." _

It is to be noted that in this statement or directive }
the language, with the exception of the word "counterespionage"
deals with matters coming clearly within legislative enactments.

The September, 1939, directive stated, "The Attorney
General has been requested by me to instruct the -Federal Bureau
of Investigation of the Department of Justice to take charge of
investigative work in matters relating to espionage, sabotage,
and violations of the neutrality regulations.

"This task must be conducted in a comprehensive and
effective manner on a national basis, and all information must be
carefully sifted out and correlated in order to avoid confusion
and irresponsiblity.

"To this end I request all police officers, sheriffs,
and all other law enforcement officers in the United States
promptly to turn over to the nearest representative of the Federal
Bureau of Investigation any information obtained by them relating
to espionage, counterespionage, sabotage, subversive activities
and violations of the neutrality laws."

In this document it is particularly important to note
that the language says the FBI is to "take charge of investiga-
tions" and not "assume jurisdiction" or "have authority to
investigate" matters relating to espionage, sabotage, and
violations of the neutrality regulations. The statutory authority
to investigate the enumerated crimes was already present, but _the

“directive fixed responsibility for the FBI to conduct the

investigations. In other words, this directive conveyed no
authority not already possessed by the FBI by legislative enactment
but merely established that no other investigative agency should
handle the matters.

NW 65360 Docld:32989609 Page 138



'

The last paragraph of this particular directive, which
was actually a request of all local law enforcement agencies,
used the words "counterespionage" and "subversive activities."
However, the context of the statement appears to merely be
designed to broadly define activities which might touch on the
national security so that all such matters, irrespective of the
legal definition or name, would be turned over to the FBI.

A logical conclusion, based purely on examination of
the language used in the September, 1939, directive, is. that
the directive merely put everyone on notice that the FBI had the
responsibility to investigate the statutory crimes named; that
it provided no so-called "constitutional" or "executive
hority" for the FBI to investigate matters not covered by
islative enactment. This is not to say that the President
has no such constitutional authority (he has), but only that it
was not exercised here.

As a matter of particular interest, Professor Elliff,
in questioning whether President Roosevelt was aware.that he
was shifting FBI authority from Congressional enactment to
Presidential directive since he assumed that he had granted such
authority in 1936, was at least half correct. While no shift
of authority appears to have occurred as a result of the 1939.
directive, we have historical evidence to show that the President
instructed the FBI to conduct subversive intelligence-type
investigations of radicals in 1936. In this regard, there appears
to be little doubt that Roosevelt ea some degree of
Executive authority to the FBI.

AUTHORITY CONVEYED EVEN BEFORE 1939 DIRECTIVES

Confidential memoranda written by Mr. Hoover in August
and September, 1936, clearly reveal that President Roosevelt was a
very concerned about the subversive activities of fascists and
communists in the United States and discussed the matter with
Mr. Hoover during personal meetings. These memoranda indicate
that President Roosevelt was obviously cognizant of the lack of
statutory authority to conduct intelligence-type investigations
of fascism and communism. Yet, the President desired the FBI to
conduct such investigations. Mr. Hoover pointed out that the
FBI appropriation contained a provision for the FBI to conduct
such investigations if such matters were referred to it by the
Department of State. The President was hesitant of having a
formal request come through State Department, however, because
of the many leaks in the State Department.

However, during a meeting between the President,
Mr. Hoover and the Secretary of State on August 25, 1936, the
Secretary of State did ask the FBI to conduct investigations of
“Fascist and Communist activities, under the provisions of the
Appropriations Act. In the discussion preceding the request,
however, it must be noted that the President stressed the fact that
fascism and communism were international in scope, and that
communism in particular was directed from Moscow; that this was a
matter which fell within the scope of foreign affairs over which
the State Department would have a right to request an inquiry to
be made.

According to the information presently available

President Roosevelt agreed to place a handwritten memorandum of
his own in the White House safe, concerning the request of the
State Department for investigations of fascism and communism. The
President asked Mr. Hoover to speak to the Attorney General about
the matter and that the Secretary of State also discuss the
technique to be followed with the Attorney General. Mr. Hoover
recorded that he did inform the Attorney General on September 10,
1936, of a conference he had with the President on September 1, 1936,
at which time the Secretary of State was present, and at which time
the Secretary of State - at the President! suggestion - requested
of Mr. Hoover to have investigations made of the subversive

: activities in this country, including communism and fascism.
The Attorney General verbally directed Mr. Hoover to proceed with
the investigations and to coordinate these matters in the
possession of the Military Intelligence Division, the Naval
Intelligence Division, and the State Department. Mr. Hoover
considered this the authority upon which to proceed

The circumstances surrounding the manner in which the
President had the State Department request investigation very
likely explains why the September, 1939, directive did not contain
any language relating to subversive activities. President Roosevelt
was fully aware that the FBI was already conducting confidential
investigations of the activities of fascists and communists who
represethed a threat to the national security at that time. There
was obviously a private and understandable confidential agreement
between all interested parties, including the other Federal
investigative agencies who had an interest. There was no need
to mention subversive activities in the first part of the directive
since the pertinent Federal agencies were already on notice and
local agencies would turn over all matters relating to the
national security.

) : Based on the foregoing, reliance on the September, 1939,
directive or even the earlier confidential arrangement worked
out by the President, whether considered a Presidential directive,
Presidential mandate, or some other manifestation of Executive
power, for current investigative authority appears to be unwise.
Placing the 1939 directive and the earlier arrangement in their
proper perspective is very important. Both were laid in a period
when the world was on the brink of World War II. The concern for
national security was related to two international movements. There
were no laws, such as the Smith Act of 1940 or the Internal
Security Act of 1950. Although there were undoubtedly some purely
American groups which received no direction or control from abroad
there was no national comscrn for indigenous anarchists or other
groups desiring to overthrow the Government.

PRESIDENTIAL DIRECTIVES SUBSEQUENT TO 1939

As mentioned previously, the directive dated
September 6, 1939, was reiterated subsequently by directives
dated January 8, 1943; July 24, 1950; and December 15, 1953
The directive dated January, 1943, signed by President Roosevelt,
was simply a reaffirmation of the earlier 1939 directive and
was broadened only to the extent that it called on all patriotic
organizations and individuals as well as local law enforcement
officers to report information to the FBI. The July, 1950,
) directive, signed by President Truman, contained the phrase
“subversive activities and related matters," which on the
ace would indicate that President Truman intended to broaden
the scope.of authority it might convey to the FBI. However,
closer examination reveals that the Truman.directive actually
misquoted the earlier two directives of President Roosevelt and
included the phrase “subversive activities and related matters"
which did not appear in the Roosevelt directives.

Since no information is available concerning Executive
intent behind the issuance of the 1950 directive, it cannot be
determined whether President Truman was aware of the possible
additional authority he might have conveyed to the FBI as the
result of changing the language of the two prior directives to
include the phrase "subversive activities and related matters."
The fact of the matter is, the United States was at the
time engaged in the "police action" in Korea and there was
unquestionably a great deal of domestic subversive activity
at the time, most of which could be traced to the Communist Party.
We do know that President Truman signed the 1950 directive
on the advice of the National Security Council.

There is one document available which tends to reveal
the concern President Truman had relative to increased subversive
activity involving domestic cases. In a letter dated July 17,
1946, the Attorney General said he felt that in the troubled
period in international affairs, accompanied by an increase in

jNw 65360 Docld:32989609- Page 141 :



NW 65360 Docld:32989609 Page 142

subversive activity at home, it was imperative to use special
investigative measures (wire taps) in domestic cases. Mr. Truman

concurred with the Attorney General and authorized the special
investigative measures.

_ There is one important point, however, which bears on
any feelings President Truman might have had on the issue of
domestic subversive activity. When the Congress passed the
Internal Security Act of 1950, consisting of two subchapters, -
Truman vetoed the bill, citing as a reason that-Title II of
the Bill - The Emergency Detention Act - constituted a threat
to the democratic process. In "The American Constitution -

Its Origins and Development" by Alfred H. Kelly and Winfred A.
Harison, the authors declared that President Truman roundly
condemned the Internal Security Act as grossly unconstitutional
They said that his veto message called the registration provisions
of the law "the greatest danger to freedom of press, speech and
assembly since the Sedition Act of 1798." A drastic new sedition
statute, derived from the earlier Mundt-Nixon bill which was
bottled up in the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1948, was
incorporated in the Internal Security Act. Myr. Truman thought

the phrase prohibiting a person to "substantially contribute"

to the establishment of a totalitarian dictatorship so vague as

to cast grave doubts upon whether it met the standards of accuracy
necessary for due process in criminal statutes. These authors

did not even touch on the emergency detention subchapter of the
Act. The political climate at the time, however, in spite of
President Truman's censure and veto, was such that the Internal
Security Act was passed over the veto and became law.

While the 1950 directive of President Truman incorrectly
stated "On September 6, 1939, and January 8, 1943, a Presidential
Directive was issued providing that the Federal Bureau of
Investigation of the Department of Justice should take charge
of investigative work in matters relating to espionage, sabotage,
subversive activities and related matters.," the directive issued
by President Eisenhower on December 15, 1953, said nothing about
the FBI being responsible for such matters. Rather, the 1953
directive began by stating, "On September 6, 1939, January 8,
1943, and July 24, 1950, Presidential Directives were issued
requesting all enforcement officers, both Federal and State
to report promptly all information relating to espionage, sabotage,
subversive activities, and related matters to the nearest
representative of the Federal Bureau of Investigation."

This language can, of course, be interpreted to mean
that the FBI is responsible for investigating these matters
otherwise the directive would not have noted that enforcement
officers were requested to furnish all information to the FBI.



NW 65360 Docld:32989609 Page 143

The 1953 directive actually did not reiterate either of the

three previous directives except for the language quoted above.
Instead, it cited the FBI's responsibility to investigate all
violations of the Atomic Energy Act and requested all patriotic +
organizations and individuals as well as all enforcement officers
to report violations of the Atomic Energy Act to the nearest
representative of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

IMPLEMENTATION OF 1939 DIRECTIVE

All of the foregoing documents have obviously been
subject to various interpretations. However the language might
be interpreted, the September, 1939, directive, was implemented by
the FBI and Congress was made fully aware of the extent of
investigative activity the FBI was conducting as a result of the
directive. In Mr. Hoover's testimony on November 30, 1939, in
connection with an emergency supplemental appropriations bill,
he said, "In September, 1939, we found it necessary to organize
a General Intelligence Division in Washington. The establishment
of,this division was made necessary by the President's proclama-
tion directing that all complaints of violations of the national
defense statutes and proclamations be reported to the Federal
Bureau of Investigation. This division now has compiled extensive
indices of individuals, groups, and organizations engaged in
subversive activities, in espionage activities, or any activities
that are possibly detrimental to the internal security of the
United States.

"The indexes have been arranged not only alphabetically
but also geographically, so that at any time, should we enter
into the conflict abroad, we would be able to go into any of
these communities and identify individuals and groups who might
be a source of grave danger to the security of the country."

During the same testimony Mr. Hoover was asked if any

“of the funds being requested in the emergency supplemental

appropriation would be spent for any of the purposes’ for which
funds were denied at the previous session. Mr. Hoover .replied
they would not; that the entire sum would be spent fot intelli-

gence work.

Subsequently, in June, 1940, Mr. Hoover again testified
before a House Subcommittee on Appropriations. At that time he
referred to his appearance before the committee the previous fall
wherein he testified that authority had been requested to set up
a separate division with the FBI to handle national defense
matters under an assistant difector. Mr Hoover offered a chart
showing the organizational structure of five divisions of the
Bureau, one of which he referred to as the National Defense
Division. He said that this Division would handle and direct all
investigations dealing with espionage, sabotage, national defense
matters, and violations of neutrality statutues.



Mr.. Hoover testified that in line with the President's
order of the previous September (September 6, 1939) there had
been close coordination of all the intelligence services. He
pointed out that the President, on September 6, directed the FBI
to coordinate the functions on national defense matters in
intelligence work. Mr. Hoover also related that he wanted to
refer to a general intelligence index which he had mentioned in
previous hearings. He said that that index included the names
of persons who might become potential enemies to our national
security, such as known espionage agents, known sabotuers,
leading members of the Communist Party, and the bund. He
explained that this index had been compiled very carefully, and
it was confined solely to persons engaged in activities detrimental
to the United States.

Later, on February 19, 1941, when Mr. Hoover appeared
. before Congress in connection with a deficiency appropriations
bill for 1941, he went into some detail concerning the activities
of the FBI prior to the then national emergency. In response to
a question concerning this, Mr. Hoover replied that prior to the
emergency our activities covered generally the investigation of
all Federal statutes except counterfeiting, narcotics, income
tax, and postal violations. FBI jurisdiction, he said, included
kidnaping, extortion, bank robbery, white slavery, motor vehicle
theft, impersonation of Government officers, frauds against the
Government, antitrust investigations, etc.

Mr. Hoover then incorporated into the record a list of
major crime laws passed between 1934 and 1941, showing the
legislative jurisdiction of the FBI during the period. With
the exception of nine of these laws, all dealt with criminal-type
violations of law. The exceptions included a prohibition on
the exportation of arms and ammunition to Spain during the civil
war; the prohibition of making photographs, sketches or maps of
vital military and naval defense installations; the Hatch Act,
which among other things related to employment of individuals by
the Government who were members of political parties advocating
the overthrow of the Government; amendment of the act requiring
registration of agents of foreign principals; the Neutrality Act
of 1939; amendment of the Espionage Act; the Smith Act of 1940
act requiring registration of certain organizations (Voorhis Act);
and an amendment to the Sabotage Act. There was a special note
listed under the amendment of the act requiring registration of
agents of foreign principals. This called attention to the Presidential
directive dated September 6, 1939. From this structure inference
can be drawn that the directive was related to this amendment.

NW 65360 Docld:32989609 Page 144



EXPANSION OF AUTHORITY CONTALNED IN 1939 DIRECTIVE

Further in his testimony Mr. Hoover was asked if any other
agencies of the Government were covering the same work that
emergency employees of the FBI were covering. He replied that
he would like to leave the committee a publication listing the
statutes, proclamations and Executive Orders pertaining to

national defense matters. He then stated that the President in
1939 directed that all invest “ations dealing with espionage,
sabotage, subversive activit. _, and national defense activities,
would be handled by the FBI « ..ept those arising within the

Army or Navy. He. went on to say that other governmental agencies
were instructed under this Executive order to report to the FBI
any information showing any violation dealing with national
defense matters.

No Executive Order could be located which contains the
language used by Mr. Hoover in this instance. He might have’
been referring to either the directive or statement made by

‘President Roosevelt in June, 1939, or the directive dated

September 6, 1939. However,, the, above-quoted language is. _much
broader than used in either of these documents.

In considering the full impact of the June and September,
1939, Presidential directives, and how they subsequently influenced
FBI jurisdiction and responsibility, it must be borne in mind
that the Nation was at the very brink of World War II. President
Roosevelt issued a proclamation on September 8, 1939, declaring
that state of national emergency existed in connection with the
observance, safeguarding, and enforcement of neutrality, and
strengthening of the national defense within the limits of peace-
time authorizations. An Executive Order (No.8233) dated September 5,
1939, prescribed regulations governing the enforcement of the
neutrality of the United States. The War Department, Navy Department,
Treasury and Commerce Departments, and the Governor of the Panama
Canal were assigned certain enforcement duties. The Justice
Department (FBI) was given responsibility of enforcement of the
neutrality of the United States not especially designated to other
departments, independent offices and establishments of the
United States Government, and prosecution of violations of the
neutrality of the U. S. : :

Unquestionably in time of national emergency the broadest
possible interpretation was being applied to every statute, resolu-
tion, proclamation, Executive order, Presidential directive or other
lawful order or mandate in the interest of the preservation of peace,
the national defense and general welfare of the country. Undoubtedly
there are many other documents recording Executive intention,

KNW 65360 Docld:32989609 Page 145



Executive instructions concerning broad, sweeping authority for the
FBI, which cannot now be found for one reason or another. Certainly
there is indication that at least President Roosevelt had more than
one conversation with Mr. Hoover concerning the necessity for the
-FBI to conduct investigations beyond the statutory authority it
normally used.

DIRECTIVES SUPPLEMENTED OR SUPERSEDED BY STATUTES

Eventually, however, there were legislative enactments
which broadened the scope of our statutory authority, increased
our legal jurisdiction and added to our investigative responsi-
bility. Following the September, 1939, directive, which has
been used as a source of FBI authority to conduct certain types
of domestic intelligence investigations, the Smith Act of 1940
became law. Several successful prosecutions resulted from the
Smith Act, although some parts of it were invalidated by the
Supreme Court. The revised statute (Title 18, U.S.C. 2385) remains
on the books and is enforceable.

Legal Counsel's Office analyzed Title 18, USC 2385,
in June, 1972. It was noted that this statute contains the
substance of the original Smith Act. The House of Representatives
Committee on Judiciary, Report No. 1869, 74th Congress,
First Session, made clear the purpose of the original legislation:

"The reported bill is based on the natural right of
self-preservation inherent in every government. It simply
authorizes the exercise of the power of the government to defend
itself against those who seek by force and violence to destroy
it." Further clarification of the legislative objective was
made by Representative John W. McCormack, who said, "And by
the way, this bill is not alone aimed at communists; this bill
is aimed at anyone who advocates the overthrow of government
by violence and force."

VALIDITY OF THE SMITH ACT

The Supreme Court held in 1951 that teaching the
doctrine of forcible overthrow of the United States Government
was a violation of the Smith Act where there was a clear and
present danger that a substantial public evil would result.

-The Court further held that the Act did not violate the First
Amendment. Chief Justice Vinson, who wrote the majority opinion,
used language which must be considered at this time to be

very significant in deciding whether the Government may in

fact conduct preventive-type investigations in the interest

Of self-preservation. oes

__ NW 65360 Docld:32989609 Page 146

Justice Vinson wrote, "The rule we deduce from these
cases (a series of earlier Supreme Court decisions - namely the
‘question in every case is whether words used are used in such
circumstances and are of such nature as to create a clear and
present danger that they will bring about the substantive
evils that Congress has a right to prevent. ') is that where
an offense is specified by a statute in nonspeech or nonpress
terms, a conviction relying upon speech or press as evidence
of violation may be sustained only when the speech or publication
created a 'clear and present danger' of attempting or accom-
plishing the prohibited crime."

In this case, applying this rule, the court said,
"Obviously, these words cannot mean that before the Government
may act, it must wait until the putsch is about to be executed,
the plans have been laid, and the signal is awaited--we must,
therefore, reject the contention that success or probability
of success is the criterion."

In addition to the Smith Act of 1940, Congress also
passed legislation which further increased the authority of
the FBI to deal with subversive activities. The Voorhis Act
(superseded in 1948 along with original Smith Act) which is
now Title 18, USC 2386, provided for registration of organizations
subject to foreign control which engage in political activity
among other things. The Internal Security Act of 1950 was
passed over the veto of President Truman and provided not only
a prohibition of conspiracies or attempts to establish a
totalitarian dictatorship and a long list of measures having
to do with Communist organizations (Control of Subversive
Activities) but also for the emergency detention of suspected
security risks. Further, in 1954, Congress enacted the Communist
Control Act to provide additional investigative authority in

A dealing with the communist threat to national security.

DIRECTIVES VERSUS LEGISLATIVE ENACTMENT

These legislative enactments were unquestionably
designed to give the FBI a cloak of statutory authority to
investigate not only the communists, which were a grave concern

a to President Roosevelt when he requested investigations of
communism by the FBI in 1936, but also any other group which
engages in activity aimed at overthrow of the Government by
force or violence. And, whereas President Roosevelt relied
on the element of foreign relations and the international
character of the fascist and communist movements to have
State Deparment make a request for FBI investigation, the
statutes referred to above do not require a dependence on
foreign elements, notwithstanding the Congressional finding
of necessity in connection with the Internal Security Act of
1950 and the Communist Control Act of 1954.

The question to be resolved, then, is divided into
several interrelated parts. First, if the Presidential
directives described heretofore are actually valid. Secondly,
assuming that the directives are completely valid, why have
they been cited as one of the bases of FBI investigative
authority? Thirdly, if, as it appears from the foregoing, the
directives are valid, but do not convey the investigative
authority we have heretofore contended, what effect will this

have on our past and future domestic intelligence investigative
activity?

Insofar as the validity of the Presidential directives
is concerned, there can be no question but that each directive
‘was issued completely in accord with the President's executive

power. The evidence shows that the first directive in September, -

1939, was not only implemented with the knowledge of Congress,
but by appropriating money to the FBI for its implementation
Congress in effect gave the directive the full force of law.
None of the directives from September, 1939, to the one issued
by President Eisenhower in 1953 have been secret. As a matter
of fact, all were directed to the public at large, asking
support of local law enforcement officials and patriotic
organizations. Numerous times the directives have been cited
.in FBI appropriations testimony.

The second part of the question becomes more difficult
to answer. Over the years, whenever it has been necessary and
proper to describe our investigative authority, and this has
been a requirement in justifying our annual budget, we have used
what we have considered all of the different bases for such
authority. Although it now seems obvious that the September,
1939, and July, 1943, directives did not actually order the FBI
to take charge of any investigations not actually covered by
statute, i.e., espionage, sabotage, and neutrality laws, it did
request law enforcement officers to turn over to the néarest
representative of the FBI all information relating to subversive
activities and counterespionage as well as the three statutory
crimes listed. It is apparent that the language here was intended
as a catch-all so that law enforcement officers would turn over
information of any sort whatsoever _ it might affect the
national security.

In analyzing the language used in that first directive
of September, 1939, everything must be put into its proper
perspective. In 1939 the Nation had been conditioned to a state
of near-war. From January 30, 1933, when Adolf Hitler became
Chancellor of Germany, through the nonagression pact between
Germany and the Soviet Union in August, 1939, the specter of war

- 13 -

NW 65360 Docld:32989609 Page 148



hung over America. Anti-German, anti-Italian and anti-Soviet
sentiment swept over the country. People began to look for spies
under their beds. It-became very necessary to direct the
Nation's energies in that regard into a single channel. We could
not have every police officer, sheriff and special deputy sheriff
in the country running around investigating spies. By the same
token, it was very necessary for the Government's resources to be
directed towards identification and neutralization of very real
espionage rings and potential saboteurs. The June, 1939, directive
assured that the FBI would take charge of domestic internal
security instead of several agencies working at cross purposes.
The September, 1939, directive placed local law enforcement: on
notice and simultaneously provided for information of possible
value to be funneled to the FBI which was Te pone t bees for the
coordination and investigation.

The September, 1939, directive, although not’ conveying
any investigative authority to the FBI, did result in an
additional workload for the FBI by virtue of the fact that local
police and other Federal agencies were referring matters to the
FBI for investigative attention which were not previously called
to our attention. While some of the matters could be logically
fit into one of the statutory crimes of espionage, sabotage or
neutrality regulations, others could not be since the original
information was often nonspecific or so nebulous that it could
be categorized only after some inquiry was made locally.

e We were also faced with the reality of war and the

fact that Germany, Italy, Japan and the Soviet Union had espionage
apparatuses directed against the United States. While we might
not ordinarily institute an investigation before the commission

of a crime, such as the case of a bank robbery, motor vehicle
theft, etc., the crimes of espionage and sabotage relate to the
national security. It would havé not only been folly, it would
have been insane to wait until we had evidence of the commission
of crimes of espionage or sabotage. Rather than wait until

we had a complaint alleging the commission of one of these crimes
we went out and conducted intelligence-type investigations to
determine if there were espionage rings operating or if there

were persons conspiring to sabotage the national defense. So the
September, 1939, directive did affect our investigative operations.
Not by giving us some new investigative authority, but by assigning
us the responsibility of coordinating all investigative activity
in this regard. We were, of course, already in the intelligence-
gathering business as a result of the confidential arrangement
agreed upon in August and September, 1936, among

President Roosevelt, Director Hoover, and the Secretary of State.

NW 65360 Docld:32989609 Page 149 : 2



For these reasons, it can be seen why the FBI used the
September, 1939, directive as one of the bases for its investi-
gative authority. The unfortunate thing is that the 1939 directive
was never really updated, in spite of the reiterations of 1943,
1950, and 1953. It was really never broadened to incorporate the
Executive request made in 1936, and to reflect the Executive
intent that became so obvious in the succeeding years up to this
very time. It would be very difficult to convince someone

examining our legal authority for conducting intelligence-type
investigations that we derive any authority, particularly any © .
reiterating it. What we have, it appears, is a hold-over or
perpetuation of a concept of authority (or better, responsibility)
which had some basis in 1939, and perhaps even through the
Korean War years, but which has long since ceased to have any
bearing on FBI investigative operations.

This leads us to the third part of the question and
that is what effect the lack of authority derived from the
directives will have on past and future domestic intelligence
investigations. Although there is division of opinion by some
supervisors and officials in the Domestic Intelligence Division as
to how much investigative activity has in the past and will in
the future depend on the nebulous authority of the directives

i in question, examination of all the evidence leads to the

; conclusion that in the past our investigations have to some
degree depended, not on the language of any of the directives,
but rather, on the Executive request of President Roosevelt in
1936 andon basic authority derived from the many statutes
relating to the national security, both before and after the
issuance of all the directives in question.

INVESTIGATIONS UNDER STATUTORY AUTHORITY

Argument has been advanced by some in the Domestic
Intelligence Division that it will be impossible to carry out
our internal security responsibilities of conducting purely
intelligence-type investigations using statutory authority only;
that the only way we have been able to do this in the past was
from the authority contained in one or more of the directives
in question. If this were true, i.e., that we have conducted
some investigative activity solely on the basis of the directives, -
the FBI would be in for a rough time if the efforts on the part
of several congressional figures to look into our operations
ever come to pass. The fact of the matter is, we have had
ample authority to do just what we have done without the
directives. Administratively perhaps, we could have been more
precise in advertising our investigative jurisdiction and
authority. And unquestionably, we could have been more careful
in writing reports and other records of our investigative activity
to show that our investigations were predicated on information
indicating violation or possible violation of statutes.

This brings up another point mentioned: by
Professor Elliff in his study. E1lliff related that the
FBI had a policy from Mr. Hoover's appointment as Director
until 1936 of "closed end" investigations, but that this policy
gave way to intelligence coverage involving continuing investiga-
tive activity within a broad range of delegated authority. By
"closed end" investigations, Elliff means that a crime was
committed, a prosecutive opinion was received, an investigation
was conducted, a prosecutive opinion was sought and the case
was either prosecuted or closed for want of prosecution. On
the other hand, an intelligence-type investigation would involve

“continuing investigation without any thought of closing the

case by virtue of prosecution or inability to prosecute. In

a case involving a purely criminal act, it can be seen that

a "closed end" investigation is possible. But in the fast-moving
world of today, with its organized crime problem tied into space-
age concepts even in purely, criminal cases, the "closed end"
investigation is often far from a reality.

PREVENTIVE INVESTIGATIONS

In analyzing. the concept of "closed end" investigations
versus continuing intelligence-type investigations, several
factors must be considered, especially where the national security
is involved. Ordinary criminal acts such as the bank robbery,
theft, burglary, fraud, etc., can in no way be compared to crimes
involving the national security. Usually we would have no
occasion to conduct investigation prior to the commission of any
of the above-named crimes. But, a crime against national security
is an entirely different matter. No one but a fool or one
dedicated to the destruction of democracy would advocate that the
Government take no action to prevent a crime which could destroy
the Government. In other words, it would be an unusual case to
conduct a "closed end" investigation of an attempt to overthrow
the Government by force and violence. It would appear that the
FBI would have a constitutional obligation to conduct the
necessary preventive investigation (intelligence?) to insure that
an attempt to overthrow the Government does not occur.

Taking into consideration that any court in the land
would take judicial notice that the Soviet Union and its satellites
are engaged in espionage directed against the United States and
that it employs intelligence-gathering techniques: against us, it
logically follows that the same courts would take judicial notice
that the United States Government would have to employ counter-
espionage and counterintelligence methods to combat this threat.

It is believed that the same can,be said for other situations where
the facts are such to lead any prudent and cautious individual to
believe that a threat exists to commit sabotage; to incite to

se


insurrection or rebellion; to engage in seditious conspiracy; or
to plot the overthrow of the Government. Under such circumstances
it would seem that the FBI not only has the duty to conduct
investigations to prevent the crimes, but has the obligation to

do whatever is necessary within the law to neutralize such
threats.

It is true that this type of investigation might be
contrary to the established concept of investigating only after
there is evidence of crime. It is also true that such investi-
gations might take place over a long period of time without any
indication or prospect of presecution. However, as pointed out
by Legal Counsel in his memorandum dated 7/14/72 on Wiretapping,
that "Running through the whole (decision) is a golden thread
of philosophy that when the functions essential to the preservation
of a nation itself are at stake, the nation has the power to take
the action reasonably necessary to protect itself." While this
comment had to do with a particular court decision not related
to the national secuirty, it is very apropos. It would be
unrealistic to contend that the FBI could only investigate
crimes or potential crimes affecting the national security after
the crime has been committed. How ludicrous this would be.

Right on point in this regard is another part of the

a) majority opinion upholding the Smith Act convictions in 1951.
Chief Justice Vinson wrote, “Likewise we are in accord with...
the trial court's finding that the requisite danger existed. The
mere fact that from the period of 1945 to 1948 petitioners!
activities did not result in the attempt to overthrow the
Government by force and violence is, of course, no answer to the
fact that there was a group that was ready to make the attempt.

5 The formation by petitioners of such a highly organized conspiracy,
with rigidly disciplined members subject to call when the leaders,
these petitioners, felt the time had come for action, coupled with
the inflammable nature of the world conditions, similar uprisings in
other countries, and the touch-and-go nature of our relations
with countries with whom the petitioners were in the very least
ideologically attuned, convince us that their convictions were
justified on this score.

“And this analysis disposes of the contention that a
conspiracy to advocate, as distinguished from advocacy: itself
cannot be constitutionally restrained, because it comprises only
the preparation. It is the existence of the conspiracy which”
creates tie danger. (Emphasis mine) If the ingredients of the
reaction are present, we cannot bind the Government to wait until
the catalyst is added."

Some might say, "this is all very well and good where
prosecutive action is used or intended, but what of the cases
where the only purpose of the investigation is to produce
intelligence information, with no hope or intent of prosecutive
action?" There are unquestionably situations where prosecution
would be impossible, but it is doubtful if any situation could be
conjured up involving the national security where the elements of
one or more statutes would be present to lend statutory authority -
to an investigation or reason for investigation. :

INTELLIGENCE INVESTIGATIONS

Recently, in connection with a lawsuit filed by the
Fifth Avenue Peace Parade Committee because of investigation
by the FBI relative to a huge demonstration in Washington, D. C.,
the Department of Justice cited Title 28, USC 533, as the lawful
authority of the FBI to conduct the investigations in question.
The investigation at issue had to do with contacting various
transportation facilities in an effort to determine the nature
and size of groups traveling to Washington for the demonstration.
In a sense, this was purely intelligence-type investigation. The
statute cited was nothing more than the statute enabling the
Attorney General to direct the FBI to conduct investigations.

This same statute has been cited for other types of
investigations where the Department of Justice has requested the
FBI to conduct investigations where we might not have clearly
seen or understood the underlying authority or reason. It can be
seen, however, that under the statutory authority granted to the
President in Title 10, USC 331-333, to call up troops to assist
local governments to put down an insurrection or restore order,
the Attorney General would be within his statutory authority as
the President's Chief Legal Advisor to ask the FBI to provide all
possible information which might assist the President in making a
determination under Title 10. Thus, the FBI would conduct an
intelligence-type investigation under the statutory and constitu-
tional authority flowing from the President, through the
Attorney General to the FBI. In this case we might not immedi-
ately see the potential for prosecutive action, although with the
statutes covering antiriot and civil disorder we would no doubt
be alert for indications that riots or disorders would occur
and that evidence could be collected which would support prosecu-
tion. Here, we would be conducting investigation before a
violation takes place, not only for the intelligence data needed
by the President, but to determine if a Federal violation of law
might also occur.

EXECUTIVE ORDER 10450
What other authority is also available to the FBI? We
sometimes lump Presidential directives and Executive orders into

one category as if they were the same. This is a common practice,

- 18 -

NW 65360 Docld:32989609 Page 153



even on the Executive level. The Executive orders are numbered,
whereas the directives usually are not. From information
available it appears that Presidential directives and Executive
orders carry equal weight. They take on the force of law if
acknowledged by resolution of Congress and are published in the
Federal Register. All this leads up to a very significant
document which over the years has provided substantial investi-
gative authority to the FBI. It is commonly known as Executive
Order 10450, although it has been revised and will be known as
Executive Order 11605 if it is ever implemented. Executive
Order 10450 is captioned as "Security Requirements for Government
Employment" and, as the name implies, is related to employment
by the Government of individuals who might constitute a national
security risk. This Executive order grew out of Executive
Order 9835, dated March 21, 1947, which provided for an
investigative procedure affecting persons entering competitive
civil service. The order established a Loyalty Review Board

and procedures for handling of cases where loyalty of an
employee was questioned. Executive Order 9835 followed the
establishment of the President's temporary commission on loyalty
under Executive Order 9086, dated November 25, 1946. Executive
Order 10450, dated April 27, 1953, superseded and revoked
Executive Order 9835. ‘

The important thing about these two Executive orders is
that the Attorney General was required to furnish the Loyalty
Review Board current information concerning the subversive nature
of foreign cr domestic organizations, including totalitarian
groups. Thus, the FBI, acting under lawful authority of the
Attorney General, was bound to conduct the necessary investiga-
tions to enable the Attorney General to fulfill his responsibility
to the Loyalty Review Board. Executive Order 10450, in revoking
Executive Order 9835, also disbanded the Loyalty Review Board
and provided that the Attorney General would furnish the same
information regarding subversive organizations to the head of
each department and agency. The Attorney General was also
requested to render to the heads of departments and agencies
such advice as may be requisite to enable them to establish and
maintain an appropriate employee-security program.

Under Executive Orders 9835 and 10450. the
Attorney General had the responsibility to designate
organizations as totalitarian, fascist, communist or subversive,
or as having adopted apolicy. of advocating or approving the
commission of acts of force or violence to deny others their
rights under the Constitution of the United States, or.as seeking
to alter the form of government of the United States by uncon- |
stitutional means. Under provisions of Executive Order 11605,

NW 65360 Docld:32989609 Page 154



dated July 2, 1971, the Attorney General still has the responsi-
bility of furnishing names of organizations to the heads of
departments and agencies. ‘However, instead of the organizations
being designated by the Attorney General, the new Executive
Order provides that the Subversive Activities Control Board
shall, upon petition of the’ Attorney General, conduct hearings
to make the same determination formerly made by the

Attorney General. The new Executive Order also sets up a much

broader criteria for establishing the subversive nature of
organizations.

Unfortunately, the Subversive Activities Control
Board, which was initially established under the Internal Security
‘Act of 1950, is under attack from Congress. Congress refused
to provide any funds for the Subversive Activities Control Board
after July 1, 1972. There has been indication that Congress may
also take steps to repeal the remnants of the Internal Security
Act of 1950. Should this happen, we would’ lose a broad base of
current authority for conducting many of our security-type
investigations. Executive Order 11605 has not actually been
implemented; therefore, we are bound to the provisions of
Executive Order 10450. Basically, however, the responsibility
under 10450 (or even 11605 if it is ever implemented) falls on
the Attorney General, and for this reason the Department of Justice
} should now provide guidance as to what investigations are required
by the FBI to fulfill the Attorney General's obligations under
the existing Exeuctive order.

STATUTORY AUTHORITY AND PRESIDENT'S CONSTITUTIONAL POWER

What other investigative authority or jurisdiction do
we have? Attached to this study is a collection of statutes and
documents which grant investigative authority for conducting the
various types of investigations falling with the primary super-
vision og the Domestic Intelligence Division. Included in this
collection of laws are statutes such as civil rights statutes,
which are the basic responsibility of the General Investigative
Division, but which nevertheless convey statutory authority in
investigating totalitarian organizations such as the Ku Klux Klan
and other hate-type groups. Civil rights statutes might also
likely be involved in other situations where organized groups
act in such a manner as to deny other persons their constitutional
rights. The fraud statutes are included since many groups
engage in activities which are covered in one way or another
by such statutes. There are, of course, the basic statutes such
as espionage, sabotage, treason and foreign agents registration
act. But there are statutes, such as inciting to antiriot,
and others which cover an extremely broad spectrum of subversive
activity. But isn't there some additional authority under the

\ constitutional power of the President to protect the national
security?

- 20 -

NW 65360 Docld:32989609 Page 155 : ‘



It was under just such constitutional powers that
President Roosevelt requested the FBI to investigate the fascist
and communist movement. And, of course, it was under just such
constitutional powers that the President authorized the
Attorney General to approve without a warrant electronic sur-
veillances on both domestic and foreign organizations engaged
in activity detrimental to the national security. However, the
Supreme Court has considerably narrowed the President's consti-
tutional authority as a result of the Keith case. In essence,
the court stated that insofar as domestic organizations are
concerned, the President does not have the power to abrogate
the First and Fourth Amendments. In other words, the President
cannot order an act (investigation) which would interfere with
or abridge the First Amendment rights to assemble or redress
_gvievances, or to enjoy freedom of speech, or the Fourth Amend-
ment rights requiring the issuance of search warrant in connec-
tion with the seizure of evidence.

ond

The courts have considerably broadened their inter-
pretation of both the First and Fourth Amendments. Civil
libertarians have proclaimed that any activity on the part of the
Government which might have a "chilling effect" on an individual's
legitimate right to dissent constitutes a violation of First
Amendment rights. In some cases the courts have adopted this

1 view. By the same token, Fourth Amendment rights have been
broadened to include overhearings of conversation, and the issue
of invasion of privacy is being raised more and more. With all
these factors being considered there are, however, numerous
situations bearing on the national security where the President
unquestionably has the constitutional authority to have the
FBI obtain information which will enable him to fulfill his
broad responsibilities under the Constituion. With the exception
of the recent Keith decision, the courts have declined to define
or circumscribe the President's constitutional power.

Ordinarily, when we speak of the constitutional :
power of the President we think in terms of a specific order
such as a directive or Executive order or some other tangible

evidence.

However, over the years, beginning with the years

preceding World War II, Mr.

J.

Edgar Hoover established a

rapport with the President which resulted in the President

making requests of the FBI under his inherent Executive authority.
The request made by President Roosevelt in 1936 as described
herein is an excellent example of a long series of Presidential
requests extending through a long line of Presidents and at least
until Mr. Hoover's death. Presidents from Roosevelt to Nixon
have confided in Mr. Hoover and sought his advice and product of
FBI investigative skill, particularly in matters affecting the
national security. One very excellent example of the confidence
the President has had in the FBI is the confidential Presidential

ene ie

[ NW 65360 Docld:32989609 Page 156



directive of 1941 instructing that the FBI set up a Special
Intelligence Service covering the Western Hemisphere to handle
and coordinate all intelligence work within the hemisphere.
There are many other examples, but a more recent one is the fact
that President Nixon, in spite of responsibility assigned to
CIA, asked that the FBI establish Legal Attaches in several
countries where there had been a dearth of good intelligence
information.

SPECIAL WHITE HOUSE REQUESTS

Over a period of years the President came to rely on the
FBI to provide first-hand intelligence information concerning
both domestic and foreign situations bearing on policy affecting
the national security. As a result of numerous conferences in
which the various Presidents outlined to Mr. Hoover their needs
for information which would assist him and his staff in their
policy decisions, Mr. Hoover instructed that important developments
concerning the national defense or which might otherwise be of
value to the White House should be reported directly to the
President or one of his high-level staff members. In most
instances the same information was made available to the Attorney
General simultaneously. Over the years it became a common practice
for White House staff members to telephone requests for information
or investigations to Mr. Hoover's office or the office of one of
his officials. Such requests were usually considered as being
within the constitutional Executive power, and for the most part
such requests were completely legitimate and well within the
recognized scope of the FBI investigative authority.

o

Occasionally, however, requests were made - and complied
with - which in retrospect appear to have been beyond any recognized
Executive authority. An example is a telephone request to furnish
all available information to the White House concerning a forth-
coming Earth Day rally in 1970. The rally, which was sponsored by

_ groups concerned with pollution and ecology, attracted the
attention of a few subversive elements, but appeared to be very
much under the control of the sponsors. Senator Edmund S. Muskie
spoke at the rally in Washington, D. C., and Rennie Davis, an
antiwar activist with a subversive background, appeared on the
same platform with Senator Muskie. A few minor disturbances
erupted in some areas, but overall the Earth Day rallies were -
peaceful and attained their general objective, the calling of
attention to environmental problems. Senator Muskie, who learned
that the FBI covered the rally in Washington, was incensed that
the FBI was involved. We had a poor defense and in this case, at
least, it is doubtful that there was any legitimate Executive
authority to have the FBI involved. In any event, it would appear
that such requests should flow through channels, including the
Department of Justice where possible, to assure that unreasonable
and improper requests are made for investigative activity.

- 22 -

_ NW 65360 Docld:32989609 Page 157 i



L NW 65360 Docld:32989609 Page 158

It is quite understandable that various staff members
at the White House have assignments or projects to prepare
reports on a wide variety of matters relating to the welfare
of the country. It is also quite understandable that such
individuals would turn to the FBI to develop information through
investigative activity or from its files. However, the fact that
the FBI has specific responsibilities and jurisdiction under
the law may not be known to these staff members and in their
ignorance of the situation they could ask us to engage in activity
beyond the scope of our investigative authority.

Over a long period of time the FBI has disseminated
information directly to the White House as it was developed
when the information had a bearing on national defense or possible
foreign policy planning. The White House has come to expect this
kind of rapid. dissemination. Much of the information disseminated
has been of specific interest to the National Security Council
of which the President, Vice President and high level members of
his staff are members. Even though CIA has the basic responsibility
under the National Security Act of 1947 to coordinate all
intelligence data relating to national defense, the nature of
rapid changing situations makes it impractical to disseminate all
important intelligence information to the National Security
Council via CIA channels. It is not believed that the White House ~
would sit still for the FBI cutting off dissemination on nationai
security information.

NEED FOR CURRENT EXECUTIVE ORDER

Dissemination, however, is but the product of investi-

_gative activity. The question, then, is not to whom we should

or should not disseminate, but rather when and when not should

we investigate. All of which leads to the issue of what consti-
tutes Executive or Presidential authority under the constituion,
and how can such a determination be made? Granting that the
President does have broad constitutional powers which he can
exercise in the interest of national security, how can such

power be conveyed to the FBI to cover possible gaps in our
statutory authority? It is not believed that individual requests,
particularly from lower level White House staff members, actually
convey any power of inherent Executive authority, unless such
requests may have originated from the President himself

What appears to be sorely needed, then, is a clear-cut memorandum
of understanding - possibly in the form of a comprehensive
Executive order or Presidential directive - outlining areas of
investigative activity required and the investigative product
needed by the Executive to fulfill his national security
responsibilities.

i DEVELOPMENT OF INVESTIGATIVE POLICIES

By examining our investigative policies and procedures
over the years it can readily be seen that procedures adopted
out of necessity, such as those developing out of the period
preceding World War II, in time come to be accepted as gospel
both within and outside the FBI. The intelligence-type investi-
gations originally ordered because of circumstances existing in
1936 and even before, continued after World War II, and in reality
became necessary again during the Korean War pefiod. And although
the actual basis of authority in 1949 and 1950 was not the same
as in 1936, we evidently considered it the same and obviously the
Department of Justice and White House did also.- Even though the
Congress provided legislative authority to investigate subversive
acts, it appears that we did not feel that the type of investi-

_ gations necessary could be conducted except under an authority
which did not require collection and preservation of evidence with
a view of eventual prosecution, but rather to gather information
only for the purpose of determining the nature and extent of
subversive activity.

This is not to imply that the statutes were not used.

On the contrary, the statutes were used and*a large number of
top level Communist Party functionaries were convicted under the
Smith Act, but we still conducted investigations based on what

y we considered to be authority under constitutional power of the
President - investigations which Professor Elliff has called
continuing investigative activity within a broad range of delegated
authority. While this study has not gone into the procedures
and policies developed by the FBI in connection with investiga-
tions relating to our Emergency Detention Program, various
documents were examined and it is known that this program preceded
the Emergency Detention Act, which was a part of the Internal
Security Act of 1950. A great deal of investigative activity,
dating back to the 1930's, was conducted concerning the Securi,ty
Index, an integral part of the Emergency Detention Program. s a
matter of interest, the’ Emergency Detention Program, which was
a program devised to insure that individuals constituting a
threat to national security would be arrested and detained in the
event of a national emergéncy. The Department at one point felt
that. the constitutionality of such a program was highly question-
able. However, the program was implemented and was in existence
at the time the Internal Security Act of 1950 was passed.

And most curiously of all is the fact that even after
the Internal Security Act of 1950 became law, providing a legal
basis for the program in existence, it was not until the 1960's
that our Emergency Detention Program was switched over from an
emergency plan under Presidential powers to the authority
vested by statute. Of course, the part of the Internal Security Act

-~ 24 -

. NW 65360 Docld:32989609 Page 159

:



i  @ ee |

authorizing emergency apprehension and detention was repealed

in October, 1971. Under the Emergency Detention Program, while
it existed, a great deal of continuing investigative. activity
was conducted concerning thousands of individuals who were
believed to represent a‘threat to the national security in time

| of national emergency. Some of our investigative practices today
are based on criteria authority growing out of the original

i aa Emergency Detention Program.

j Now this is not to say that the FBI is in a position of

i having to defend its investigative policies or practices. If there
has been but a single thread of continuity running through our
investigative practices and procedures over the years it is that
the individual's constitutional rights are paramount; that nothing
\ is so important as a citizen's rights under the law. Legal

eee ‘Counsel pointed out an extremely important point last year at the
time of the Princeton Conference where a group of FBI critics
gathered to expose the FBI's faults. He noted that for years
preceding the Miranda decision and the Escobedo decision the FBI
had been warning persons of their rights prior to taking any kind
of statement. Every Special Agent knows that the first and
perhaps most important element in preparing for a prosecution is
preserve the individual's rights guaranteed under the Constitution.

The FBI has legally conducted investigations of individuals
and organizations whose philosophies inciude the overthrow or
destruction of the United States Government by force or violence.
Whether conducted under a Presidential order or statutory
authority any such investigations were absolutely necessary and
continue to be so. For administrative reasons documents reporting
results of investigations often have not always clearly shown the
authority, statutory or otherwise. A caption has usually been

_used for routing and supervisory purposes which is not clearly Sate

indicative of the nature or purpose of the investigative activity.

_ Such captions might well be confusing to one not connected with
the FBI and they might well lead to the conclusion that investi-
_gation was not based on any legal authority. For example, the
caption “Security Matter - Miscellaneous" or "Internal Security -
Revolutionary Activity" means little to someone outside the FBI.
To those in the Domestic Intelligence Divison such designations
identify the type of case and supervising unit at Headquarters.

In other words, there has been nothing wrong with the
_conduct of our investigations. . Only those deserving of investi-
_gation under statutory provisions have been investigated. While
we would have been more precise to predicate our investigations on
a specific authority, whether statutory or Executive order (10450),
we have not engaged in extra-legal investigative activity
simply because we failed to cite any specific authority to
conduct the investigation in such a way as to make it a "closed
end" investigation such as Professor Elliff described.

PREVENTIVE INVESTIGATIONS -

While there has been some disagreement by one or two
supervisory personnel in Domestic Intelligence Division as to
how long an investigation may be carried on under statutory
authority or whether a "preventive" investigation can be carried
on under that authority, it is my own contention that intelligence-
type investigations can be carried out under statutory authority;
that there is no constraint imposed by law governing the length
of time in which an investigation can be conducted. There are
many reasons why continuing investigative activity would be
necessary, even when a statutory violation is involved. In most
cases involving the national security a conspiracy of some sort
is involved. Conspiracies frequently go on for years. When

.the preservation of the Government is involved, who is to say that

we either prove a conspiracy within a specific period of time or
stop investigating.

Whether a conspiracy is evident or not, the FBI would not
open an investigation of any type unless information was first
received that a violation of Federal law was involved or that the
national security was threatened. This is how our so-called
intelligence-type investigations are usually started. A citizen,
an informant, or a law enforcement officer furnishes information that
there is a group in existence which includes in its philosophy an
advocacy of overthrow or destruction of the Government of the
United States by force or violence. It would appear to be entirely
logical that under at least three separate Federal statutes a
violation would occur if this group did attempt to overthrow the
Government. And the Supreme Court has said that the Government
does not have to wait until the putsch is about to be executed

and that proof that success or probability of success must be shown.

While the examples cited hereafter might not be good legal
analogy, there does not seem to be any reason why the preservation
of our Government warrants any less consideration under the law.
The courts have upheld cases, such as have been developed in the
Washington, BD. C., metropolitan area, where a nearby jurisdiction,
which prohibits importation of liquor from Washington, sets up a
surveillance near the larger purveyors of liquor. When a car
bearing Virginia or Maryland license plates is observed to be
loading up what is obvioulsy more liquor than can be imported into
these states, a surveillance is instituted and when the person
drives across the state line he is arrested and charged with
violation of state liquor laws. it can be argued that such is
possible only because of the broad police powers delegated to
the states by the Constitution. Perhaps. But under the same
Constitution it would appear that somewhere there is a rationale
that if a statute exists prohibiting the overthrow or destruction
of our Government, the Government should have the same degree
of power to see that persons do not overthrow it

SH Gattee



NW 65360 Docld:32989609 Page 162

But the same problem exists in many areas covered by
Federal statute. In the narcotics field tremendous intelligence
programs are in existence to stop the spiraling increase in drug
addiction and traffic in narcotics by organized crime. Even
broader intelligence programs are being planned. It is true that
violations are occurring. And some arrests are being made as the
result of excellent police work following the violations. But
the Government is also concerned with preventing drugs from even
getting into the United States, and from preventing any that do
get here from being sold to our children. So, we are conducting
preventive investigations in the narcotics field. We are conducting
intelligence-type investigations. Certainly prosecutions will
be sought wherever possible, but we are conducting the same type
of investigations in the narcotics area as we are in the field of
national security. We are doing what has to be done, and the
statutes are the basis of what has to be done.

In the field of organized crime we know that the Mafia
and the Cosa Nostra have spread like a cancerous growth into the
very economy of the Nation. Certainly there are violations of
law. Statutes of some sort are usually involved. Many of the
statutes involved are outside the primary investigative jurisdiction
of the FBI. What has to be done? The individuals controlling
the organizations of crime syndicates must be identified and the
nature of their activity analyzed to see what - if any - Federal,
or even local, crimes are being committed. In other words, we
know that syndicated criminals are engaged in crime, yet we do
not know exactly what crimes. We are therefore conducting
intelligence-type investigations to first identify the criminal
and then identify the crime. I fail to see why there isn't a
parallel between intelligence-type investigations conducted to
prevent criminal depredations on the public at large and the same
kind of investigations to protect the Nation from the nihilists,
anarchists, terrorists, revolutionaries and other subversives.

ia While drawing a parallel between criminal investigations
and national security investigations, there is no intent here to
show that both types of investigative activity can be or should be
conducted alike. The two types of activity are as diametrically
opposed as the two poles of the earth. One is concerned with the
individuals and organizations which are involved purely for
financial gain. The other is concerned with the individuals and
organizations which are involved purely for ideological and
philosophical reasons. There is a vast difference between the
two. Intelligence-type investigations are necessary in the

field of narcotics and other areas of organized crime and they

are conducted without the need for any inherent Executive power
being conveyed.

origin to the common-law concept of a sovereign's rights to
protect itself to the 1939 et seq, directives and Executive
Orders 9835 and 10450. Included in this group were (1) National
Association of Black Students (NABS) which originally had as its
stated purpose to. serve as an’ information center and communications
network. for blacks on college campuses. This was in 1969.

There was an enormous amount of violence and upheaval on college
campuses at that time. Damage and injuries from arson, sabotage
and malicious vandalism grew into the millions. In a number of
instances black students were in the center of the activity.

NABS was considered a potential source of danger during any major
strife, particularly since the national coordinator of the

group, Gwendolyn Marie Patton, had been a member of an extremist
group cited as an extremist group by the House Committee on
Un-American Activities. The Black Panther Party and other
revolutionary-type organizations attempted to organize and
penetrate black student groups such as this.

(2) The Center for Black Education (CBE) came under
investigation when its founder was determined to be a former member
of the Black Panther Party and described as one of the leading black
militants in San Francisco prior to his move to Washington, D. C,
CBE has been publicly described as an educational institution
designed to train technicians who will work to liberate the
African people and develop the African world. The CBE has as its
goal "the independence of the African People." Members have
engaged in firearms training.

(3) The Drum and Spear Bookstore (DSB) in
Washington, D. C., opened in 1968 and was publicly described as
@ retail bookstore having the largest collection of books about
Africa, Asia, and the Negro in America. It also had protest
literature and books concerning the socio-economic conditions in
the U. S. It was determined through investigation that the
bookstore was apparently not being used as a front for underground
or, subversive activity and investigation was closed.

(4) The Congress of African Péoples (CAP) was formed in
1970. It initially advocated the unification of all blacks, the
complete rejection of the "white imperialist, capitalist system,"
the establishment of a black nation, the formation of a National
African Party and ultimately a World African Party under the
revolutionary ideology of Pan-Africanism.

During a CAP conference in July, 1971, CAP leaders
vociferous ly advocated the need to engage in disruptions as a
means of ending "acts detrimental to blacks," the formation
of a paramilitary "defense unit," and the establishment of
communication lines with other black revolutionary movements
abroad. The CAP has established communication links with the
Chinese communist diplomatic establishment in Canada.

INTELLIGENCE INVESTIGATIONS AND CIVIL LIBERTY

One of the biggest distinctions between the criminal
and security-type investigations is the fact that national
security investigations, which involved the ideological factor,
are almost without exception concerned with the concept of
political ideology. No matter how radical the political ideology
might be, it is nevertheless considered by the people involved -
and often by many intellectual idealists - as a right guaranteed
under the Constitution. As a result of a great deal of liberal
thinking on the part of the civil libertarians and groups such as
the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), there is a much
greater hue and cry when intelligence-type investigations are

“surfaced and it developed that the purpose of the investigation
had something to do with an individual's so-called political
beliefs. The potential problem for the FBI in conducting purely
intelligence-type investigations, even when based on statutes,
is when the investigation broaches or gets real close to rights
protected under the First and Fourth Amendments.

As pointed out before, however, the Supreme Court has
emphatically stated that the President has no constitutional
power to abridge these two Amendments. Therefore, no Executive
order, no matter how broadly worded to convey investigative
authority for intelligence-type investigations, could enable the
FBI to avoid the same pitfalls regarding areas of activity
covered by the First and Fourth Amendments. Therefore, even though
a definitive Executive order would be desirable from the stand-
point of fixing our responsibilities and bridging any gaps between
statute and Executive necessity, the FBI would still be in a little
better position than it is at the present time under purely
statutory authority.

INTERPRETATION OF AUTHORITY BY SUBSTANTIVE SECTIONS

At this point it appears appropriate to introduce comments
offered by representatives of the various substantive Sections of
the Domestic Intelligence Division as to their interpretation of
Executive power flowing from the 1939 et seq, directives and
the types of investigative matters that possibly cannot be conducted
solely under statutory authority.

EXTREMIST INTELLIGENCE SECTION VIEWS

The Extremist Intelligence Section described four
investigative matters where it appears that investigation, at
least initially, would not or could not have been grounded in
specific Federal statutes, but where the FBI nevertheless was in
a sense fulfilling intelligence responsibility tracing its

cay aes



COMMENT - REBUTTAL

It is believed that in at least three of the above-
described situations the FBI would have been able to conduct
investigatons based on statutes relating to advocacy of over-
throw of the Government, seditious conspiracy, inciting to
insurrection or rebellion, civil disorders, antiriot,
neutrality laws (foreign relations) and perhaps sabotage. The
questionable case, the Drum and Spear Bookstore, would have
probably been brought adequately to our attention from various
public sources or through our informant coverage of overall
matters affecting the national security.

NATIONALITIES INTELLIGENCE SECTION VIEWS

The Nationalities Intelligence Section listed four
situations wherein, generally speaking, much of the FBI's
investigative activity has not been based on statutory authority,
but has been designed to develop intelligence data regarding
individuals and organizations which have established themselves
as a potential threat to the security and safety of the
United States Government or its citizens. Listed are the following:

(1) The Jewish Defense League (JDL). Although involved
in terror-type bombings covered by statute, FBI investigation of
JDL is also developing information regarding future plans and
activities, particularly violent acts against Soviet diplomats
and diplomatic establishments and pro-Soviet groups and indivi-
duais. In the case of JDL, Department of State has a specific
interest from the standpoint of U.S. relations with other
countries. Certain of our intelligence-type investigations of
JDL are aimed at satisfying State Department requirements.

(2) Al Fatah and Popular Front for the Liberation of

‘ Palestine are two organizations that are well known for violence
potential. In light of statements and actions of members and

leaders, it is obvious that the FBI should conduct intelligence
investigations when these organizations are active in the U.S.

(3) Revolutionary Union and Venceremos Organization are
two groups which adhere to a pro-Chinese communist political
philosophy and pledge overt action through use of weapons to
bring about revolution in this country. With this in mind, we
: have undertaken intelligence-type investigations to identify
those involved who may be responsible for carrying. out violence
directed against the U. S. Government or the citizens of this
country.

NW 65360 Docld:32989609 Page 165



(4) Puerto Rican independence groups, specifically those
who seek to bring about independent status for Puerto Rico by
means of force and violence, are the subject of intelligence-
type investigations. No groups seeking independence of Puerto Rico
by lawful means are investigated. The violence-prone groups have
committed acts ranging from attempted assassination of the President,
accompanied by murder, to acts of terrorism involving bombing,
arson, and shootings. Much of the violence-prone groups' activity
is planned in communist Cuba. Many of the leaders of the violent
pro-independence groups are communists or followers of Leninist-
Marxist philosophy.

Nationalities Intelligence Section is of the opinion that
the aims and activities of the above-mentioned groups and similar
organizations border on statutory violations; that while we do not
rely on statutory prohibitions for authority to investigate them,
it must be recognized that the reason investigations are initiated
closely approaches the elements involved in conspiracy violations.
Nationalities Intelligence Section opines that if we must look
toward actual written authority for this kind of investigation,
it appears we must rely on the Executive order (directive?) dated
September 6, 1939, and subsequent reaffirmations of that order,
noting that the 1939 directive and later supporting directives
were published at a time when this Counce was involved in armed
hostilities abroad.

Nationalities Intelligence Section observed that it
appears necessary at this time to seek a properly worded Executive
order which clearly sets forth the desires of the President in
his capacity as the chief administrator of our country. Such an
order should carefully distinguish between acts which are clearly
opposed to the constitutional basis under which we operate and
those which, no matter how unpopular, are nothing more than an
expression of ideas. Finally, Nationalities Intelligence suggests
that detailed guidelines from the Attorney General should be
issued, based on the Executive order or directive.

COMMENT - REBUTTAL

While I agree completely with the suggestion that a
detailed Presidential order is needed, along with guildelines
issued by the Attorney General, I disagree that we cannot investigate
the violence-prone Puerto Ricans and the Revolutionary Union and its
spin-off, the Venceremos Organization, under existing statutes.

I feel also that all we need to cover the JDL and the Arab terrorists

like a blanket is a request from the Secretary of State to the
Attorney General under the statutory authority relating to
foreign relations which has previously been described herein
and in accordance with Title 28, USC 533, set forth in the

a


exhibit accompanying this study. Some additional authority is
also present, at least for the time being, in Executive Order
10450 (based on Executive Order 9835). Additionally, there is
authority, particularly with respect to JDL, under statute
having to do with assaulting foreign diplomats.

| INTERNAL SECURITY SECTION VIEWS

The Internal Security Section pointed out that the
security investigations supervised within that Section are
conducted within the purview of authority set out in original
position paper of the Domestic Intelligence Divison dated
May 19, 1972, entitled "Investigations of Subversion," which
paper was to have been discussed during meeting of the Bureau's
Executive Staff with Mr. Gray at Quantico the last week of May.
The position paper was abandoned by Mr. Miller in favor of a
different position, the essence of which has been expressed
heretofore in this study.

The authority referred to by Internal Security Section
essentially is based on both statutory and Presidential documents,
including the 1939, et seq, directives. Internal Security pointed
out that it should be stated at the outset that while FBI
investigations conducted with specific reference to a statute
will develop some intelligence it is not possible to base all FBI
activities in the collection of intelligence on statutory
authority alone. Internal Security further points out that it is
true that the initial Presidential directive(s) of 1939 picked
up the term “subversive activities" as incidental to their
primary thrust, but that it is just as true that President Truman's
directive of July 24, 1950, however intentional or
unintentional it may have been specifically stated, said that the
FBI had charge of investigative work in matters relating to
espionage, sabotage, subversive activities and related matters.
Internal Security feels that whether or not the initial Presidential
directives fully embraced the concept of subversive activities
would appear irrelevant after such a definitive order signed
by Truman. Internal Security Section is of the opinion that whether
we had it spelled out beforehand is unimportant because obviously
Truman's order of July 24, 1950, made our investigative interest
in subversive activities valid at that time.

COMMENT - REBUTTAL

Without going into detailed rebuttal here, the Truman
directive is discussed in detail heretofore, it must be reiterated
that Truman's directive contained a misstatement of fact concerning
the previous directives, and I feel that under the magnification
of a critical analysis of the Truman directive, particularly by

ar gee

. NW 65360 Docld:32989609 Page 168

guideline and states clearly what I may do or not do.

individuals unsympathetic to the FBI, we cannot glibly state
that whatever the intention or unintention may have been, Truman
signed the order and therefore it made everything fine.

VIEWS CONTINUED

The Internal Security Section believes that reliance on
statutory authority alone for the collection of intelligence
would severely limit the scope of FBI activities to the detriment
of our national security. They feel that a statutory basis must
impose reasonable and definable limits and for the most part
investigations conducted with regard to statute are "closed end"
type. Internal Security points out that we investigate violations
or allegations of violations; that we do not investigate indefinitely
on the supposition or speculation that by "fishing" we may
find somebody who violates a Federal law. Internal Security notes
that such a concept is repugnant to the democratic process and
clearly indicates a police state mentality. They go on to point
out that on the other hand it is also clear that there are some
areas -- particularly where the integrity of the Government
is at stake -- where we must conduct intelligence-type investigations
to detect conspiracies and actual attempts which go to the very
heart of the Government's existence.

COMMENT - REBUTTAL

Here, again, I must interject with a point of rebuttal.
As pointed out before, I feel that investigation under statutory
or other legal authority does not require the so-called "closed
end" type of investigation in every case. But the most important
point I want to bring out is that I cannot see the logic of saying
that investigations based on the possibility of violations to
destroy the Government (intelligence investigations actually)
are repugnant to the democratic process when performed under
statutes forbidding such activity and are indicative of a police
state mentality, whereas there is nothing repugnant, nothing
wrong with conduct the same type of investigations under some
nonspecifie Presidential power to protect the integrity of
the Government. I personally, as a citizen, would rather
have a system wherein I could not be investigated unless there
was some indication that I was planning to violate the law,
or had already done so. As a law-abiding citizen-I have no
fear of intelligence-type investigations aimed at discovering
plots to violate the law. I would have fear of a government
system which permitted intelligence investigations based on
someone's - anyone's, Presidential or otherwise - interpretation
of what an individual may say, do or think. The law is a

Vague interpretations subject to the caprices of undisciplined
politicians could result in a virtual police state if the law is
not the basis of our investigative activity. ‘

VIEWS CONTINUED

Internal Security Section recognizes that our investi-
gations are conducted under both the authority conferred under
Executive orders (10450) and statutes and notes that as a
practical matter the statutory provisions cited as a basis for
intelligence-type investigative authority must bear a reasonable
relationship to the activity investigated and must be brought to
a logical conclusion within a reasonable period of time. They
also point out that it would be extremely difficult to justify
continued investigative interest in a mere member of the Communist
Party on the basis of the Smith Act or the Internal Security Act
of 1950. It is further pointed out that this points up again
the necessity for reliance not only on statutory authority but
for the broader.intelligence-type authority conferred by
Presidentail directives and Executive orders.

REVOLUTIONARY ACTIVITIES SECTION VIEWS

The Revolutionary Activities Section furnished several
specific examples of work of that Section which does not fall
within the purview of existing Federal statutes. Included in
those examples are the following:

Hee (1) Students for a Democratic Society/Worker
Student Alliance (SDS/WSA) is the largest faction of SDS
in existence at the present time. It has an estimated
membership of 750 members. This group is described as a revolu-
tionary, predominantly campus-based organization dominated and
controlled by the communist Progressive Labor Party. The group
has engaged in recent widespread anti-Government demonstrations
throughout the country which have led to numerous arrests,
property damage, and injuries to law enforcement officers. Major
purpose of our investigation of SDS/WSA is to obtain intelligence
data in order to have a day-to-day appraisal of the strength,
dangerousness, and activities of the organization and to keep
the Department. of Justice and other interested agencies advised.

Revolutionary Activities Section states that authority
for investigation of SDS/WSA is based on Executive Order 10450,
but that additional authority is derived from Presidential ae
directives dating from September 6, 1939, 28 Code of Federal
Regulations 0.85 (d) cites FBI authority to carry out Presidential
directives. They also note that "inherent" responsibility. of the
President derived from the Constitution to "insure domestic
tranquility," (Preamble) to "take care that the laws be faithfully
executed," (Article II, Section 3) and to protect the states
against invasion and domestic violence (Article IV, Section 4)
provide power to the President.

| (2) The Socialist Workers Party (SWP) is the inter-
national Trotskyist movement founded in the 1920's when Leon Trotsky
. lost out in a power struggle to Joseph Stalin for control of the
international communist movement. The basic philosophy of the SWP
is that only violent revolution can destroy capitalism; that

all political groups other than their own are counterrevolutionary
and must be destroyed. We rely on Executive Order 10450 for
investigative authority.

(3) The Venceremos Brigade consists of a loosely knit
group of over 1500 individuals who have travelled to Cuba in
separate contingents since November, 1969. Positive information
has been developed that the organization is being used by
various hostile intelligence services for spotting purposes
and recruitment of intelligence agents and support personnel.

The group is under investigation because it appears to be under
the control and domination of a hostile power.

Revolutionary Activities Section states that Presidential

directives (supposedly the 1939, et seq directives) have given
the FBI responsibility to investigate matters relating to the
internal security of the country. They point out that after the
first contingent returned to the U.S. in February, 1970, the
White House (nonspecific) instructed the Director to conduct an

. intensive investigation of the group te determine the extent of
indoctrination afforded these individuals while in Cuba and to
assess their potential dangerousness to the country. In addition,
the Department of Justice has requested information to support
indicia that members of various contingents have been trained as
espionage and intelligence agents for the Cubans and North Koreans
and may be operating as such in the U.S.

(4) Vietnam Veterans Against the War (VVAW) is a revo-
luationary antiwar group currently of major concern in view of
its potential for violence. The organization is made up of many
Vietnam war veterans who have advanced training in explosives and
weapons and many have records of narcotics use. One VVAW
national coordinator stockpiled arms and ammunition and advocated
“political elimination squads." Revolutionary Activities Section
relies on the Presidential directives (1939 et seq) and Executive
Order 10450 as a basis for investigation in the absence of
specific statutory authority.

(5) Weatherman is the name adopted by a group which is
a revolutionary Marxist-Leninist organization dedicated to the
overthrow of the Government through force and violence. A number
of Weatherman leaders are current Bureau fugitives in connection
.with violations of Federal antiriot laws, Bombing and Gun Law
statutes, as well as the Fugitive Felon Act. Revolutionary
Activities Section cites as specific authority for investigation

- 35 -

\ Nw 65360 Docld:32989609 Page 170



of the Weatherman organization that Presidential directives have
instructed the FBI to take charge of investigative work

relating to espionage, sabotage and subversive activities and that
Executive Order 10450 provides additional authority.

(6) Unaffiliated individuals who are a part of the New
Left Movement. Revolutionary Activities Section notes that
although the New Left Movement has no definable ideology of its
own, it does have strong Marxist, existentialist, nihilist and
anarchist overtones. In some instances there are individuals
without any organizational affiliation who by their revolutionary
activities and statements, establishing a rejection of law and
order, reveal the individual to be a potential threat to the
security of the U.S. Such individuals do, in fact, engage in
violence or unlawful activities and their potential dangerousness
to the internal security is clearly demonstrated by their state-
ments, conduct and actions. According to Revolutionary Activities
Section, specific authority to conduct our investigations of
unaffiliated individuals is derived from Presidential directives
of September 6, 1939, through December 15, 1953.

This Section states that in all these examples there is
a likelihood that evidence may be developed at some future date
that activities of these organizations and individuals constitute
violations of specific statutes. It is further stated that our
authority to conduct investigations in these cases cannot be
based on the speculation that evidence of some violation might be
developed; however, until such time as we obtain a substantial
allegation that a violation has occurred, we must base our a
"intelligence" investigations on the Presidential directives and
Executive orders issued by the President delineating our
responsibility in regard to national security.

COMMENT - REBUTTAL

At the risk of being monotonous, there appears to be
ample indication here that a great deal of statutory authority
is present, but not being cited. The Smith Act of 1940 and other
statutes dealing with the national security provide the basis for
investigating all of these groups. The espionage statutes
serve as basis for investigating the Venceremos Brigade. Certainly
the authority conveyed by Bxecutive Order 10450 is not questioned.
And in the case of the Weatherman group, the Fugitive Felon Act
_Zives us a tremendous latitude for conducting all the intelligence
investigation we may need in an effort to locate the Weatherman
fugitives.

OFFICIAL RECOGNITION OF INTELLIGENCE INVESTIGATION

Although the cold facts indicate that the Presidential
directives dating back to 1939 do not convey any authority to
the FBI which it did not have already by legislative enactment,
it is obvious that intelligence-type investigations are necessary
in the protection of the national security. Various documents
emphasize the necessity for developing intelligence data. For
example, the report of the National Advisory Commission on Civil
Disorders (Kerner Commission, 1968) emphasized that law enforcement
organizations must develop the means to obtain adequate intelligence
for planning purposes and that law enforcement.should "gather,
evaluate, analyze and disseminate information on potential as well
as actual civil disorders."

Similarly, the President's Commission on Campus Unrest
(1970) took special note of the need for intelligence in effective
law enforcement. The Commission stated in its report, "It is
an undoubted fact that on some campuses there are men and women
who plot, all too often successfully, to burn and bomb, and
sometimes to maim and kill." The report concluded that the
best, and sometimes the only, means law enforcement has to thwart
or prevent such plots is through "clandestine intelligence work."

A memorandum for the Director of the FBI from Attorney
General Ramsey Clark, dated September 14, 1967, stated that "In
view of the seriousness of the riot activity across the country,
it is most important that you use the maximum available resources,
investigative and intelligence, to collect and report all facts
bearing on the question as to whether there has been or is a
scheme or conspiracy by any group of whatever size, effectiveness,
or affiliation, to plan, promote or aggravate riot activity."

The memorandum went on to state that "In this connection
the following federal statutes could be applicable depending, of
course, upon the factual situation that develops." Ten Federal
statutes were then listed and it is particularly significant to
note that the Attorney General was instructing that the FBI
collect intelligence information - not on some specific allegation
that a crime had been committed, but to determine whether there
has been or is a scheme or conspiracy. In other words, the FBI
was instructed by the Attorney General to conduct intelligence
investigations to determine if any of the ten Federal laws might have
been violated in connection with riot activity.

FORMER STUDY OF FBI'S INVESTIGATIVE RESPONSIBILITIES

In an exhaustive study of the "role of the FBI in
Clandestine Foreign Intelligence Coilection in the United States,"
conducted and reported in a document dated April 29, 1966, by -

a committee more commonly referred to as the "Papich Committee"

Page fee

bw 65360 Docld:32989609 Page 172 Ef



considerable information was brought out concerning the FBI's
investigative authority. Of great interest is the impact the
National Security Act of 1947 had‘on the gathering of intelligence
in the United States. This Act, which is reported in 50 USC 401
et seq, established the National Security Council (NSC) and under
it the Centeral Intelligence Agency (CIA). The legislative
history of the Act notes the concern Congress had that CIA could
develop into a gestapo if permitted to become operational in the
U.S. James Forestal, then Secretary of the Navy, testified in

a hearing before the Committee on Expenditures in the Executive
Departments, that "The purposes of the Central Intelligence Agency
are limited definitely to purposes outside of this country, except
collation of information gathered by other government agencies."

He went on to say, "Regarding domestic operations, the
Federal Bureau of Investigation is working at all times in
collaboration with General Vandenberg (then head of CIA). He
relies upon them for domestic activities." The Papich Committee
study noted that there is tacit acknowledgement in Section 403 (e)
of the National Security Act of 1947 that the FBI gathers
information affecting the national security: "That upon the written
request of the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, the
Director of the FBI shall make available to the Director of Central
Intelligence such information for correlation, evaluation, and

' dissemination as may be essential to the national security."

The Papich Committee report reveals that there is ample
indication that Congress was aware of FBI intelligence functions,
particularly with respect to foreign intelligence activity in
the U.S, The Executive Branch was obviously depending on the FBI
to provide intelligence data which CIA, by law, could not collect
in the U.S. A task force headed by General Mark Clark in 1955
took notice of the fact that the FBI dealt in security intelligence.
The task force report cited the fact that the FBI was one of
four members of the Interdepartmental Intelligence Conference (IIC),
created by the National Secuirty Council, approved by the President,
March 23, 1949, to coordinate "the investigation of all domestic
espionage, counterespionage, sabotage, subversion, and other related
matters affecting internal security."

It was noted that the LIC charter did not disturb
responsibilities of its member agencies but made mandatory
action by those agencies deemed necessary to insure complete
investigative coverage in compliance with the needs of the IIC,
which had full responsiblity for coordination of the investigation
of all domestic espionage, counterespionage, etc., affecting
internal security.

The task force mentioned above, in commenting on the role
of the FBI, noted "The Federal Bureau of Investigation, however,
is the recognized center of the domestic aspect of internal
security including counterintelligence within the United States
and. its possessions." It its to be noted that this task force took

Sse

Linw 65360 Docld:32989609 Page 173 :



cognizance cf the fact that President Roosevelt as far back as
1939 had directed the FBI to coordinate and conduct domestic

counterintelligence activities. (Underlined part taken from

Papich Committee report and is not necessarily the actual language
used in the task force report. In-.any event, we know this is a
very broad interpretation of the 1939 directive.)

RECENT EXECUTIVE INTENT

Even more recently the White House exhibited its own under-
standing of the intelligence role and functions delegated to the
Attorney General and the FBI. By confidential memorandum from
the White House to the Secretaries of State, Defense, Treasury and
Commerce; the Attorney General; Director of CIA; Military Represen-
tative of the President; Administrator, Federal Aviation Agency;
and Chairman, Atomic Energy Commission, dated June 9, 1962
(National Security Action Memorandum 161), President Kennedy
stated that he would look to the Attorney General to take the
initiative in the Government in insuring the development of plans,
programs, and action proposals to protect the internal security
of the United States. This memorandum directed that the two
interdepartmental committees concerned with internal security --
the Interdepartmental Intelligence Conference (Chaired by J. Edgar
Hoover) and the Interdepartmental Committee on Internal Security
(Chaired by a representative of the Department of Justice) which
had been under the supervision of the National Security Council,
be transferred to the supervision of the Attorney General.

One of the greatest problems in conducting a study of this
type is the location of pertinent documents and material which
bear on the issues. We have located copies of the documents
related primarily to the heart of this issue, our basic authority
in the national security field - namely, the Presidential directives
and Executive orders which we have cited in addition to statutes
as being our sources of authority - but there may be other very
pertinent documents bearing on the Executive intent to have the
FBI conduct intelligence-type investigations. A good example
is evidence used by the Papich Committee, but not found during
this study, which shows that President Roosevelt called a
White House conference on May 9, 1934, attended by the Attorney
General, Secretary of Treasury, Secretary of Labor, Director of
FBI, and Chief of the U. S. Secret Service to deal with the problem
of growth of fascist organizations in the United States. The con-
ference agreed that there should be an investigation of these
groups and their activities for intelligence purposes. Since
the only Federal law believed applicable at the time was the
Immigration Law, the President decided that the Commissioner of
Immigration and Naturalization Service should confer with the
Chief of Secret Service and the Director of FBI to work out
details of the investigation.

Mr. Hoover immediately issued orders to FBI personnel to
conduct an intensive investigation of the Nazi movement. This,
evidently, was the first general intelligence investigation made
by the Government into fascist activities in this country. But
note that this general intelligence investigation was based in
law, namely the Immigration Law. We have here an example of
the exercise of inherent Executive power tempered by the fact
that the Presidential desire for intelligence investigations would
be implemented because there was a statute covering the situation.
Basically, the same applies to the 1936 arrangement between the
President, the Director of the FBI and the Secretary of State.

The law permitting the Secretary of ‘State to request the Attorney
General to investigate certain matters was the legal basis for
the subsequent FBI investigations.

CONCLUSIONS

In summary and conclusion, it is believed that the facts
clearly show that while there is a labyrinth of conflicting infor-
mation and opinions concerning the FBI's authority to conduct
intelligence-type investigations in the national security
field, there are a few basic points requiring clarification. It
is believed that we must first sweep away the myth that the FBI
now has any investigative authority based on the Presidential
directives dating from 1935, and that any investigative
responsibility we derived from those directives is so outdated as
to be very questionable if not entirely void. This is, of course,
taking into consideration the national situation at the time the
directives were individually issued.

Secondly, it is believed that the FBI does have a valid
reason to conduct intelligence-type investigations based on
the fact that there are laws prohibiting all the various types of
subversion truly affecting the national security and that the
Government has the right to protect itself from destruction by
conducting whatever preventive or intelligence-type investigations
are necessary to see that individuals and organizations
do not do those things, in violation of the law, which could
threaten the national security. Preventive or intelligence-type
investigations would include the use of confidential informants
and sources of information, the calling on law énforcement officers
and patriotic citizens and organizations to furnish all information
concerning subversion to the FBI, the collection of overt
intelligence data from publications and other public source
material, including congressional hearings, and the full scale
investigation of allegations received from ail sources.

Peer ie

A aw 65360 Docld:32989609 Page 175 a



Ge Docid:32989609 Page 176 : :

Our intelligence-type investigations, however, should
meticulously adhere to guidelines which would clearly prohibit
any intrusion or abridgement of an individual's rights guaranteed
under the Constitution, particularly the First, Fourth and Pifth
Amendments. To assure that the proper guidelines are drawn we
should request the Department of Justice to issue them and then
afford the closest possible supervision of investigation, both
in the field and at Headquarters to see that our intelligence
investigations are kept within these guidelines. The voicing
of this need does not indict our existing guidelines or careful
supervision, but merely recommends that our responsibilities be
described and, where necessary, circumscribed by the Attorney General
whose duty under the law is to supervise our activity.

It appears that the most effective means of laying to
rest the persistent complaints of various critics that the FBI
engages in political surveillance (investigations) in violation of
First and’ Fourth Amendment rights is to have definitive legislative
enactment carefully state what the FBI must do to protect the
national security. Such could be resolution or statute, but should
cover in complete detail what acts should be investigated by the
FBI, and, in particular, that the FBI must conduct preventive or
intelligence-type investigations to protect the national security.

Under the political climate existing in the country today,
however, the passage of either a statute or a resolution of the
type needed is very remote. Because of the misconceptions and
misapprehensions surrounding investigations relating to subversion,
there is an atmosphere of suspicion in congressional circles that
would likely stifle any attempt to formulate any such legislation
at this time. We should, however, recommend to the Department that
consideration be given immediately to sponsoring some comprehensive
legislative enactment along the lines needed.

In the meantime, for the benefit of the FBI, the
Department of Justice and the rest of the Executive Branch of
Government, including the staff at the White House, it appears
that the next best thing is to have a comprehensive Executive
order issued, under the inherent Executive power, outlining
exactly what responsibilities the FBI has in the protection
of the national security and in furnishing the President
the data he needs to fulfill his responsibilities under the
Constitution.

To be effective such Executive order would have to
clearly define the FBI's intelligence collection responsibilities
and would necessarily have to contain language which would
satisfy the courts that First and Fourth Amendment rights are

- 41 -



not being abrogated in any manner. Language in such an order
would ideally follow the basic language and purposes of Executive
Order 11605, since this deals with virtually every type of
subversive activity confronting the country today. ~

It is finally concluded that this study has shown that
the FBI has in the past conducted no intelligence-type investigations
which were not permissible under the law, particularly under the
concept that intelligence-type or preventive-type investigations
are lawful when the product and purpose of the investigation
is to prevent a violation of a statute. It is believed, however,
that every area of our national security investigations should
be reviewed for the purpose of determining what additional
constitutional safeguards should be considered. This is particularly
true in light of the fact that much of our investigative activity
in the past was geared to the Emergency Detention Act, which was
repealed in October, 1971. We should make absolutely certain,
for example, that the procedures adopted in setting up our
Administrative Index, following repeal of the Emergency Detention
Act, are not being used to circumvent the repeal of the
Emergency Detention Act. In this regard, it is to be noted that
a detailed study of the Administrative Index has been underway
and is almost complete as of this date.

RECOMMENDATIONS

eit That upon completion of a final draft of the study
dealing with this matter, a letter to the Department be prepared
containing the essence of this study, pointing out our findings
and requesting (a) The Department's opinion concerning our findings,
particularly directives discussed herein; (b) The Department's
opinion concerning the legality of intelligence-type or preventive-
type investigations based on existing statutes; (c) Requesting the
Department to issue comprehensive investigative guidelines for
future investigations of the intelligence or preventive type;
(d). Requesting the Department to sponsor comprehensive legislation
spelling out the FBI's investigative authority in the collection of
intelligence information relating to the national security; and
(e) Requesting the Department to seek a: comprehensive Executive
order which would cover any possible gaps between statutory authority
and Executive necessity in protection of the national security.

2. That a penetrative study be completed at the
earliest possible date concerning all our current national
security investigative guidelines to insure that every possible
safeguard is in effect to protect the individual's rights

This memorandum recommends that Bureau_space be
[proviaea Senate Select Committee (SSC) Staff for review of ,
Bureau material and interviews of Bureau employees.

SSC Staff is in a phase of its inquiry concerning (, i‘
Bureau operations which includes (1) review of considerable ™
>

FBI material (sections of manuals, forms, SAC memoranda, etc.
(2) interviews of Bureau employees; and (3) briefing of Staff

members by Bureau officials and supervisors. For many very &
sound reasons it would be to the Bureau's distinct advantage f
to provide limited, but suitable space within the J, Edgar <

Hoover Building to the SSC Staff. Because we have been able [
to obtain the Staff's agreement to review much of our material
at FBIHQ, rather than its insistence on turning the material
over to the Staff£, we are in a position of insuring the
security of our material by maintaining it in our space at all
times. Also, by having the SSC Staff conduct its review of
the material in our space, we can have personnel readily
available to answer their inquiries, thus precluding the
necessity for preparing otherwise needless correspondence and
eliminating the necessity for having our personnel present
throughout their reviews if they took place elsewhere,
Further, from a psychological standpoint, it is to our
advantage that our employees be interviewed in our space rather
than in SSC offices. Finally, space made available to SSC
Staff will also provide a desirable site for the various briefings
our people are giving to them. It should be noted that the
providing of the space which this memorandum recommends is

‘This memorandum reports the results of a meeting* rare)
between Mr. John ELLiff, Senate Select Committee (SSC) Staff, lini
who is in charge of the task force locking into the FBI, and
Messrs. Wannall, Leavitt, Branigan, and Cregar. Purpose of the
meeting was to acquaint E11if£ with the work of the Counterttitelli-
gence sence Branch in thé Thitelligence Division. ~

House Select Committee (HSC)

E11Liff advised that the SSC is concerned with how the
HSC plans to conduct its probe of the intelligence community,
He anticipates HSC may hold hearings very shortly and possibly
prior to the time the SSC gets underway, At the present time,
ELLiff knows of no agreement or plans to provide the HSC with copies
of intelligence community documents the SSC has been furnished.

Department of Justice

7 ' According to ELLiff, Kevin T. Maroney, Deputy Assistant
Attorney General, Criminal Division, has agreed to allow Staff
Members of the SSC to review the Department's file on the
Intelligence Evaluation Committee (this was a Committee chaired
by the Department and evdlved from one of the recommendations set
out.in the "Hguston Plan." During its existence the Bureau had

‘several representatives assigned to the IEC).

Asst NB co oo Page 184

Mr. Maroney has also advised the SSC Staff that in the
1966-67 peried the Department of Justice did an extensive study
jon the legal authority for the conductof electronic surveillances.
ELLiff was quite pleased that the Justice Department planned to make
this study available for review by Staff Members of the SSC in the
Department's Building and expressed the hope that the Bureau would
also see fit to allow Staff Members to review research and studies
thei'Bureau might have conducted in the area of sensitive investi-

Memorandum to Mr, W. R. ama SEGREL-

RE: . SENSTUDY 75
62-116395

Sensitive Investigative Techniques

Me. E1Liff felt that much could be accomplished in
responding to the SSC request of 5/14/75 if the Bureau could
pull together the basic FBI documents delineating our legal
authority to engage in the following investigative techniques.

(1) Electronic surveillances, including consensual
electronic surveillances; (2) all forms of mail surveillances
including covers and openings; (3) physical surveillances
including Special Agent (SA) infiltration of target groups;
photography and remote viewing and sensing devices (laser
beams); (4) surreptitious entries; (5) incommunicado interroga-
tions; and (6) bank credit, and other personal information.

It was ElLiff's opinion that if the Committee could
be allowed to review the legal authority for such surveillances
along with the documents showing how the decision-making process
orked in instituting, approving and discontinuing such operations,
much of the misunderstandings some members of the Committee have
would be clarified. E1Liff also felt a detailed briefing of the
Committee with whatever limitations the Bureau desired to place
on the number and level of those to be briefed would be extremely
helpful in assisting the Committee in developing some authority
for the FBI to legally engage in such sensitive activities in
the future.

Three Top Priority Items of the SSC

Elliff advised that in his judgment the three top
priority items of the SSC regarding the FBI are as follows.
(1) Develop legislation to clearly delineate the Bureau's
jurisdictional authority in the security and counterintelligence
field. (2) Provide the Bureau with some authoritative basis,
either statutory or otherwise, to engage in certain counter-
intelligence activities, i.e., surreptitious entry, electronic
surveillances, incommunicado interviews, in national security
cases when the need for such activity hasbeen clearly established.
(3) To improve the coordination between the FBI and the rest
of the intelligence community,

NW 65360 Docld:32989609 Page 185



Memorandum to Mr, W. R. wamal SEG —

RE: SENSTUDY 75
62-116395

ELLiff was questioned about the reason for the
third priority. He responded by noting that one President
(Nixon) had stated that in 1970 there was a breakdown in the

‘|relations between,the FBI and the rest of the intelligence

community, E11iff was informed that this was not so, that the
discontinuance of a formal liaison relationship with Central
Intelligence Agency (CIA) and subsequently the rest of the
intelligence community in 1970 did not mean that there was a
breakdown in coordination, Elliff asked why the Bureau dis-
continued a formal liaison relationship with CIA in early 1970,
We briefly reviewed for ELLiff the Thomas Riha case pointing
out that Mr. Kelley had personally caused a review of that
case in an effort to determine whether it, in fact, was the
reason for the discontinuance of our liaison relationship with
the CIA, ElLiff£f was informed that this was the case. In
addition, we discussed with EL1iff the 1966 understanding
between CIA and the FBI and made it quite clear to him that
we felt the relationship with not only CIA but the entire
intelligence community was excellent.

Other Matters of Interest

During the course of the briefing, EL1iff was shown
charts depicting the inordinate increase of Sino-Soviet bloc
official presence in the U. S, from 1959 through January, 1975,
the growth of the presence of foreign hostile intelligence
officials in the U. S. during this same period compared with
the static number of SAs we had working against this threat
during this same period. El11Liff was concerned over the fact
that the presence of Sino-Soviet bloc officials as well as the
intelligence officets increased substantially while the number
of SAs dedicated to counterintelligence investigations remained
static. He wondered why this was so. ELLiff was advised that
it was a question of manpower and priorities, He was told that
during the 1959-1975 period there was a considerable demand for
the usecof SA personnel in the fields of organized crime, civil
fights &ghetto riots, In addition, during that period of time
additional investigative responsibilities were placed upon the
FBI by virtue of new legislation,

ws
Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall
RE: SENSTUDY 75
62-116395

ELLiff£ was also interested in knowing whether our
legal attaches were operational in the counterintelligence field.
He was advised they were not. EL11iff also asked whether CIA
made available to the FBI their latest technical developments.
He was advised that we believed they did.

Finally, E11ié

received

ave to be researched that we would be in touch with
him on this particular subject. iM

RECOMMENDATIONS :

(1) We have already begun to examine the material asked
for regarding the FBI's legal authority and implication of
sensitive investigative techniques. Once examined and analyzed,
we will submit recommendations as to how we should proceed taking
into consideration the observations and suggestions of EL1iff.

that representatives of the Intelligence Division meet with.
Mr. K. William O'Connor, Special Counsel for Intelligence pa
Coordination, Office of the Deputy Attorney General, for the
purpose of briefing him concerning the contents of a Bureau letter
to Mr. George P. Williams, Associate Counsel to the President at
the White House, dated July 23, 1974, captioned "Electronic
Coverage Placed at the Request of the White House.”

&37

By way of background, the Senate Select Committee (SSC) \
has requested certain documents and information relating to the
so-called "Kissinger 17." Some of this information has already
been prepared and furnished to O'Connor with the caveats that the xX
Government has not publicly admitted to 15 of the coverages involved
and some material relating to the remaining two has been impounded
by court order due to pending civil suits. The decision was left
to the Department as to whether or not material prepared in response
to SSC requests should be made available to that Committee. 7
Mr. O'Connor on June 9, 1975, requested of Assistant Director” Z
John Mintz a briefing as to the contents of the above July 23, 194,
letter which he believed summarized information available to the
Bureau concerning the 17 wire taps.

only be made after a review of the entire file relating to the

prepare a letter to the Director similarly requesting that

Mr. Shaheen or some other designated representative of his staff
be granted authority to review the Bureau file concerning the
matter in question.

OBSERVATIONS :

During the above conversation Mr. O'Connor appeared to
be primarily interested in the completeness of the Bureau file with
regard to matters relating to the "Kissinger 17" and to what degree
information in this file had been made public. It was explained to
Mr. O'Connor, who appeared knowledgeable concerning the history of
these documents, that this file contains ali communications known
to be in existence concerning the "Kissinger 17," but no one can
state with certainty, due to the manner in which this material was
handled at the specific request of the White House, that the file
contains all communications prepared in this matter. With regard
to publicity afforded these documents, Mr. O'Connor stated he is
familiar with the documents which had been made available to the
Department for referral to various Committees and he is familiar
with excised versions of these documents which had been published
by these Committees. He indicated that the Department's present
problem is that no record has been located in the Department to
date as to just which material or in what form such material
furnished by the Bureau to the Department was subsequently turned
over to the Committees by the Department. O*Connor stated it
could be embarrassing at this time to make available to the SSC
material which had not previously been made available to the
Congressional Committees and equally embarrassing to withhold
from the SSC material which was previously furnished Congressional
Committees.

ACTION:

None. Above submitted for information,

In anticipation of Department's request cited in
instant memorandum to review Bureau files concerning the so-called
"Kissinger 17}' Special Agent (SA) Robert F. Peterson, Office of
Legal Counsel, on 6/18/75 .contacted Department Attorney Edward
Christenbury, who is handling the Halperin Civil Suit, to
determine if the United States District Court's (USDC) impoundment
would prevent this Bureau making available this file to
representatives of the Department, Christenbury, late 6/18/75,
advised SA Peterson that he, Christenbury, had contacted plaintiff's
(Halperin) attorney, who advised he had no objection to this
file being made available to a Department representative for
review. Christenbury then attempted to contact USDC Judge
John Lewis Smith, who issued the impoundment. order in this matter,
Christenbury spoke to Judge Smith's law clerk, who advised that
in view of the position taken by plaintiff's attorney, he did
not. believe that Judge Smith would interpose any objection to
the Department's anticipated request, The law clerk stated,
however, that he would contact Judge Smith at the earliest
opportunity to obtain a ruling and would advise Christenbury of
the results.

By memo dated 6-10-75, you were advised that
K. William O'Connor, Special Counsel for Intelligence
Coordination in the Department, requested he be allowed to
review a summary prepared concerning the so called "Kissinger ,

At Mr. O'Connor's request, a conference was held
with Messrs O'Connor and Shaheen and SA Robert Peterson,
SA Paul V. Daly, Inspector John B. Hotis, and Assistant
Director John A. Mintz, present to discuss the SSC request for
documents concerning the "Kissinger 17" wiretaps and his concern
that the furnishing of such documents might adversely impact
on existing litigation involving the Bureau, and may subject the
Bureau to additional lawsuits. Most of the documents in question
are also under a protective order of the Court in the Halperin
Case and therefore, a release must be orchestrated with the
Court. Mr. O'Connor suggested that a summary of existing
summaries of these wiretaps be prepared the Department and
with the acquiescence of the Court which/issued the protective
order be made available for review by t Committee in the

Re: SENSTUDY 75

Department of Justice. Mr. O'Connor also mentioned that the
summary would, of course, have to set forth the sufficient
information to allow the Committee to make a determination that the
information derived from these wiretaps was not used for political
purposes. Mr. Mintz expressed concern that the publication

‘or leaking of information from summaries could expand the number
‘and nature of suits facing the Bureau and suggested the Department
should, in obtaining the Court approval for making the summaries
available, request the Court to issue appropriate safeguards
against publication of such information. Mr. O'Connor stated
that such a recommendation to the Court would be proper and that
this would be done.

Mr. Mintz told Mr. O'Connor that the Bureau at this
time cannot make a commitment to the making available of the
summaries to the Committee without further study and approval,
and an approval would be sought expeditiously. Additionally,
Mr. Mintz requested that the Bureau be given the opportunity to
review the summaries prepared by the Department to insure the
Bureau's interests are protected.

RECOMMENDATION :

That we notify the Department that we are in agreement
concerning the preparation of summaries based on existing
summaries of "Kissinger 17" wiretaps with the provision that

we be given the opportunity to review these summaries prior
to the Department seeking Court approval for making them

available.

Reference is made to SSC letter dated May 14, 1975,
with attached appendices, requesting certain decuments and
other information from the FBI.

Item number 21, Appendix D, requests that with
respect to each occasion on which the Director of the FBI

2965 until the present, the number of warrantless electronic
surveillances in operation he provided for:

(a) The date of such testimony;

prior to and 30 days subsequent to the Director's testimony
could not be determined in 212 instances and therefore, the
figures provided are for dates as close to the 30-day time

Finally, the Director ceased testifying before
the House Appropriations Comittee regarding the number of
warrantless electronic surveillances in operation subsequent
to his March 2, 1972, appearance and therefore the request
is unanswerable with respect to 1973, 1974 and 1975.

Mark Gitenstein, staff member of captioned Committee

who has been doing an extensive inquiry into the “official and confidential"

telephonically contacted SA Paul V. Daly 6-5-75 and requested the

identities of the employees who had brought the material from the

Director's office during May, 1972, to Mr. Hoover's residence and

to Mr. Felt's office.

By way of background, Mr. Gitenstein has obtained through
interview of Mr. Felt, former Assistant to the Director John P. Mohr,
and other Bureau personnel familiar with the operations of the Director's.
office, considerable knowledge concerning the official and confidential
files. There is also an extensive request contained in captioned Committee's
letter of 5-4-75 pertaining to information surrounding these files.
Additionally, we responded to a request of the Committee contained in their
letter of 4-28-75 pertaining to the allegation.of removal of certain material
from Mr, Hoover's residence after the death of former Associate Director
Clyde Tolson. We have not, at this point, determined that Bureau documents
have been removed from Bureau space to Mr. Hoover's residence or any
other place outside the Bureau, However, it is apparent that Mr. Gitenstein
has information, or believes he has information, relating to the removal
of Bureau documents,

Mr, Gitenstein stated he had recontacter former hac

have brought material from the Director's office to Mr. Hoover's residence

through an inquiry in the Mechanical Section supply room.

Legal Counsel to Mr. J. B. Adams
RE: SENSTUDY 75

In light of this response, Mr. Gitenstein requested that
the Bureau identify the personnel involved and it is his obvious intention
that the personnel will be interviewed.

Inasmuch as the Inspection Division is conducting inquiry
into this matter, it would appear proper for that Division to determine
the identities of such personnel and, if deemed necessary, interview in
connection with the current inquiry. It is also believed that while this
request is oral in nature from the Committee, we should consider
furnishing the information as to the identities of employees to the
Committee inasmuch as if we do not respond to the oral request
Mr, Gitenstein indicated, because of the Committee's interest in this
matter, there would be no problem in his obtaining authority to furnish the
request in writing. It is apparent at this point that we would not be able
to keep such information from the Committee if such a written request were
to be received. Additionally, by responding to the oral request it will
encourage the Committee, in the areas they described as “abuse-type,”
to give us an advance indication as to their inquiries.

RECOMMENDATION:

That the Inspection Division make the necessary inquiry
concerning the identities of the employees and, if deemed advisable,
make available to the Legal Analysis Office that information which will
be furnished to the Committee.

SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES
RE: INTERVIEW OF SA CHARLES D. BRENNAN BY SSC

With regard to Martin Luther King, Jr., Brennan advised

that he got the impression from the Staff Members they felt

the Bureau had an "illegitimate" interest in King. Brennan
countered by saying the basis for the FBI interest in King

was predicated on the communist influence surrounding King.

He was asked if the Bureau employed many wiretaps against King
to which he answered that most of the information obtained was
derived from live informants. :

Relative to the COINTELPRO, Brennan advised the
Staff Members he couldn't be very specific regarding COINTELPRO -
inasmuch as he did not pay too much attention to it. They
questioned him about this statement and Brennan stated that
when you would compare COINTELPRO to such activities as the
Bay of Pigs and the Glomar Explorer, COINTELPRO was "peanuts."
Brennan was asked why he didn't recommend COINTELPRO be dis-
continued to which he replied "If City Hall wants it, you give
them what they want."

On the morning of 5/23/75 the Department of Justice w \

advised Assistant Director Mintz that former SA Brennan has or was Q
to be interviewed by Staff Members of the Senate Select Committee “NK
(SSC). On that same date I telephonically contacted Mr. Brennan 8
to advise him that the Bureau had been alerted to the fact he was
going to be interviewed by the SSC Staff and should he desire, a
representative of the Bureau could be available during the inbervaeg>
for consultation, It was made clear to Brennan that the role of ah
Bureau representative would be to insure that he couiid consult
the representative at any. time during the interview should the
of inquiry reveal; the identity of sensitive FBI sources, metho
or sensitive investigative techniques; information derived from
third agencies or friendly foreign intelligence services; or any
information which Brennan felt could adversely affect sensitive
ongoing FBI investigations.

Brennan then changed the conversation to personal chitQ
chat. At what appeared to be the conclusion of the conversation
Cregar asked Brennan if he had been contacted by the SSC Staff.
Brennan advised that he had received a telephone call earlier in the
week inviting him to an interview in Washington, D. C., and in fact
was interviewed on §/22 by SSC Staff Members Mark Gitenstein and
two others whose names Brennan did not get.

Brennan showed some concern over the fact that the Staff
had invited him to be interviewed earlier in the week but only
notified the Department subsequent to his interview. (At the

Bureau that he was to be interviewed). Brennan stated he was
not furnished a copy of the Senate Resolution or its Rules of
Procedures and was not advised of his rights or the fact that

he could be represented by counsel. He was not put under oath,
and was not given any indication as to the scope of the inter-
view prior to his appearance in Washington, In response to a
question by Cregar as to what areas the interview covered,
Brennan stated the interview covered three specific topics.

(1) The organizational structure of the Bureau; (2) Martin Luther
King, Jr.; (3) the COINTELPRO.

With regard to the organizational structure Brennan
advised that the Staff Members appear to have little understanding
as to the way the Bureau was structured. He stated they had no
appreciation of what a unit, section, or division was comprised
of. They showed him several copies of memoranda from {Brennan to
Sullivan} and proceeded to ask him about the contents of these
memoranda. When Brennan was unable to describe the background
or details surrounding a specific memorandum, they voiced
wonderment as to why he had such little recollection about a
memorandum he apparently wrote, Brennan advised the Staff
Members that just because the memorandum was written from him
to Sullivan did not mean that he necessarily wrote the memorandum
or even saw it.

In respecttto Martin Luther King, Jr., Brennan got
the impression that the Staff Members believed the Bureau was
"illegitimately" interested in King. Brennan advised that he
hit back hard on this stating that the Bureau's interest in
King was predicated on the commmmist influence surrounding
King. They asked if the Bureau had employed many wiretaps
against King. Brennan advised that most of the information
obtained on King derived from live informants. Brennan voiced
the opinion that the Staff Members wererather disappointed with
Brennan's defense of the Bureau in the King investigation.

Staff Members showed some disappointment in Brennan's
inability to remember circumstances surrounding COINTELPRO.
Brennan responded by saying that he never paid much attention

Pie

to COINTELPRO and when compared to stich activity as to the
Bay of Pigs and the Glomar Explorer, the COINTELPRO was
"peanuts,"

: At'the conclusion of the conversation, Brennan advised
that SSC Staff Members indicated they would want him to return
for additional interviews. I advised Brennan that should he
receive a subpoena to return or should he be invited to return
to Washington, D. C., to be interviewed under oath, it would be
wiseffor him to contact the FBI's Legal Counsel Division for
advice to insure that he was in compliance with the Attorney
General's order relative to the release of information obtained
while an employee of the FBI, Brennan indicated he would contact
the Legal Counsel Division should he be contacted by the SSC and
would probably ask that a Bureau representative be available for
consultation during a subsequent interview or testimony.

ACTION: If approved, the attached letter to the Attorney General
and its enclosures reflecting the results of the debriefing of
Brennan, be sent.

EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

As consideration for employment in the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), United
States Department of Justice, and as a condition for continued employment, I hereby declare
that I intend to be governed by and I will comply with the following provisions:

(1) That I am hereby advised and I understand that Federal law such as
Title 18, United States Code, Sections 793, 794, and 798; Order of the.
President of the United States (Executive Order 11652); and regulations
issued by the Attorney General of the United States (28 Code of Federal
Regulations, Sections 16.21 through 16.26) prohibit loss, misuse, or un-
authorized disclosure or production of national security information, other
classified information and other nonclassified information in the-files of
the FBI;

(2) [understand that unauthorized disclosure of information in the files
of the FBI or information I may acquire as an employee of the FBI could
result in impairment of national security, place human life in jeopardy, or
result in the denial of due process to a person or persons who are subjects
of an FBI investigation, or prevent the FBI from effectively discharging its
responsibilities. I understand the need for this secrecy agreement; there-
fore, as consideration for employment I agree that I will never divulge,
publish, or reveal either by word or conduct, or by other means disclose to
any unauthorized recipient without official written authorization by the
Director of the FBI or his delegate, any information from the investigatory
files of the FBI or any information relating to material contained in the files,
or disclose any information or produce any material acquired as a part of the
performance of my official duties or because of my official status. The burden
is on me to determine, prior to disclosure, whether information may be disclosed
and in this regard I agree to request approval of the Director of the FBI in each
such instance by presenting the full text of my proposed disclosure in writing to
the Director of the FBI at least thirty (80) days prior to disclosure. I understand
that this agreement is not intended to apply to information which has been placed
in the public domain or to prevent me from writing or speaking about the FBI but
jt is intended to prevent disclosure of information where disclosure would be
contrary to law, regulation or public policy. I agree the Director of the FBI is
in a better position than I to make that determination;

(83) I agree that all information acquired by me in connection with my official
duties with the FBI and all official material to which I have access remains
the property of the United States of America, and I will surrender upon demand
by the Director of the FBI or his delegate, or upon separation from the FBI, any
material relating to such information or property in my possession;

(4) That I understand unauthorized disclosure may be a violation of Federal
law and prosecuted as a criminal offense and in addition to this agreement may
be enforced by means of an injunction or other civil remedy.

I accept the above provisions as conditions for my employment and continued employment
in the FBI. I agree to comply with these provisions both during my employment in the FBI and
following termination of such employment.

It is the policy of the Department of Justice to extend the fullest
possible cooperation to congressional committees requesting information from
departmental files, interviews with department employees, testimony of depart-
ment personnel, or testimony of Federal prisoners. The following procedures
are prescribed in order to effectuate this policy on a basis which will be
mutually satisfactory to the congressional committees and to the Department.
{his order supersedes the Députy Attorney General's Memorandum No. 5, dated
March 23, 1953; and his Memoreridum No. 97, dated August 5, 1954. It formal-
izes the Attorney General's press release of Noveniber 5, 1953, establishing
procedures to permit committees of the Congress and their authorized repre-
sentatives to interview and to take sworn testimony from Federal prisoners.

It supplements Order No. 3229 (Revised) dated January 13, 1953, and Order

No. 3464, Supplement No. 4 (Revised) dated January 13, 1953 (with Memorandum
of "Authorization Under Order No. 3464 Supplement No. 4 (Revised)" dated
January 13, 1953), insofar as said orders have reference to procedures to be
followed in the Department's relations with congressional committees. In
support of this order, reference should be had to the President's letter
dated May 17, 1954, addressed to the Secretary of Defense, and to the Attorney
General's Memorandum which accompanied it.]

si sought as well as the specific objective for which it is sought. The Deputy

‘b. Before making the file available to the committee
representative all reports and memoranda from the FBI
as well as investigative reports from any other agency,
will be removed from the file and not be made available
for examination; provided however that if the committee
representative states that it is essential that information
from the FBI reports and memoranda be made available,

he will be advised that the request will be considered
by the Department. Thereafter a summary of the contents
of the FBI reports and memoranda involved vill be
prepared which will not disclose investigative tech-
niques, the identity of confidential informants, or
other. matters which might jeopardize the investigative
operations of the FBI, This summary will be forwarded
by the division to the FBI with a request for advice as
to whether the FBI has any objection to examination of
such summary by the committee representative. The file
will not be physically relinquished from the custody of
the Department. If the committee representative desires
to examine investigative reports from other government
agencies, contained in the files of the Department, he
will be advised to direct his request to the agency whose
reports are concerned.

3. If the request concerns an open case, i. e., one which liti-
gation or administrative action is pending or contemplated, the file may
not be made available for examination by the committee's representative.
The following procedure shall be followed:

a. The reply letter should advise the committee that
its request concerns a case in which litigation or
administrative action is pending or contemplated, and
state that the file cannot be made available until the
case is completed; and

b. Should briefly set forth the status of the case in
as much detail as is practicable and prudent without
jeopardizing the pending contemplated litigation or
administrative action.

B. REQUESTS FOR INTERVIEWS WITH DEPARTMENTAL PERSONNEL

1, Requests for interviews with departmental personnel regarding
any official matters within the Department should be reduced to writing,
signed by the chairman of the committee, and addressed to the Deputy Attorney
General. When the approval of the Deputy Attorney General is given, the
employee is expected to discuss such matters freely and cooperatively with
the representative, subject to the limitations prescribed in A respecting

@ memorandum outlining his testimony with a copy routed to his division head
and a copy routed to the Deputy Attorney General.

D. REQUESTS OF CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES FOR THE TESTIMONY OF FEDERAL PRISONERS

Because of the custodial hazards involved and the extent to which
their public testimony may affect the discipline and well-being of the institu-
tion, it is the policy of the Department not to deliver Federal prisoners out-
side the penal institution in which they are incarcerated for the purpose of
being interviewed or examined under oath by congressional committees. However,
when it appears that no pending investigation or legal proceeding will be
adversely affected thereby and that the public interest will not be otherwise
adversely affected, Federal prisoners may be interviewed or examined under oath
by congressional committees in the institution in which they are incarcerated
under the following procedures, and with the specific advance approval of the
Deputy Attorney General.

1. Arrangements for interviewing and taking of sworn testimony
from a Federal prisoner by a committee of the Congress or the authorized
representatives of such a committee shall be made in the form of a written
request by the chairman of the committee to the Deputy Attorney General.

2. Such written request shall be made at least ten (10) days
prior to the requested date for the interview and the taking of testimony
and shall be accompanied by written evidence that authorization for the
interview or the taking of sworn testimony was approved by vote of the com-
mittee. Such request shall contain a statement of the purpose and the sub-
jects upon which the prisoner will be interrogated as well as the names of
all persons other than the representatives of the Department of Justice who
will be presente

3. A member of the interested committee of the Congress shall be
present during the entire time of the interrogation.

NW 65360 Docld:32989609 Page 220 ]



ohe

4, The warden of the penal institution in which the Federal
prisoner is incarcerated shall, at least forty-eight (48) hours prior to the
time at which the interview takes place, advise the Federal prisoner concerned
of the proposed interview or taking of svorn testimony; and shall further
advise that he is under the seme, but no greater obligation to answer than any
other witness who is not a prisoner.

5. The warden of the penal institution shall have complete
authority in conformity with the requirements of security and the mainte-
nance of discipline to limit the number of persons who will be present at
the interview and taking of testimony. va

6. The warden or his authorized representative shell be present
at the interview and at the taking of testimony and the Department of Justice
shall have the right to have one of its representatives present throughout
the interview and taking of testimony.

7. The committee shall arrange to have a stenographic transcript
made of the entire proceedings at committee expense and shall furnish a copy
of the transcript to the Department of Justice.

E. OBSERVERS IN ATTENDANCE AT COMMITTER HEARINGS

In order that the Department may be kept currently advised in
matters within~its responsibility, and in order that the Deputy Attorney
General may properly coordinate the Department's liaison with Congress and
its committees, each division that has an observer in attendance at a
congrssional hearing, will have the observer prepare a written summary of
the proceeding which should be sent to the division head and a copy routed
to the Deputy Attorney General.
