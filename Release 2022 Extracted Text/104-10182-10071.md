A Military Profile

ITCHELL WERBELL Is @ short,
N wiry man of 52, quick with a
quip and quite sensible until he begins
Aatking about communism or other so
cla} issues. He has thy face and bear-
Ing of a Prussian officer, an image he
cultivated by wearing a musiache and
occasionally a morocle. He often
dresses in military clothing of indeter-
minate origin, and he embeltishes the
image hy talking In slightly clipped
sentences peppered with military
Phrasvs, There is nothing phony in
this, WerBell has a strong attachment
to weapons and to warfare, and he has

been around them so long ‘that the ;

Ideas anid styles théy foster are an in:
grained part af his personality.
Ne comes by both his militarism and
his anticommuntsm honestly. His
* fathér was: an officer in the Russian
Impqrial army, even though he was
born} in the United States. “It was a
Inicky situation,” says Mitch. "He w:
a citizen of both the U.S. and Russie.
In those days you could do that.”

The elder’ Werliell fought anainst

In the mid-'30s, WerBell pulled out

of his ageney and then formed his
own public relations firm. “I'd alread:
deen drifting into international PR
WerBell says, “using my family back-
sound. I had tremendous contacts in
Europe,
East, too." How much of this moving
in was milltary, WerBell won't say,
but his business took on more and
more of what he calls a “gcopotlitcal”
flavor.

Before long, he was dabbling in
Latin. American dictatorships. “Before
Fidel took ever in Cuba, we were
+ working closely with Batista.” He adds

with a grin, “Our functicn was to keep
Batista in power, althouzh the US.,

Fidel at that point,

Frout alt this, even Werlell doesn't

is to shoot ‘em and cut the hearts

While he experimented with weap:
oas—quielly, lo avolt problems with
the federals—WerBell proceeded with
his personal brand of geopolitics. He
made himself avaitabie to anticommu-
“nist regimes that wanted help in fight

Ils first major paramilitary oper:

during the 1965 revolt. He was, of
course, on the side of the government,

to it a sense of dash and discipline that

ing low overhead:on a test flight.

Tis trom this base of operations that,
ch WerBell has been med-
this time in the affairs of the
abouttoletume suverciga ntute of the
Bahamas. y

His activities — althoxgh no one is
completely sure,just what they entail —
have prompted Bahamas Prime Minister
Lynden Pindling to denounce WerBell
and attomey Edwin Marger, an associate,
on the floor ‘of the Bahamian  Parlia-
ment. Pindling called them “internation
al fortune hunters” with “designs on the
territorial sovereignty of the Bahamas.”

Werbell’s iivolvement in the Bahamas
—-as an advisor to a faction that wants
the island of Abaco either to remain a
Crown Colony’ or to become a separate
nation when the rest of the Bahamas be-
comes fully independent on July 10 —
has ‘also prompted some concern by the
U.S. State Department's Caribbean
Affairs Desk.

It is not a completely unfamiliar expe-
rience to WerBell to have elements of the
United States government at least coa-
cerned — if not outright displeased —
with somie of his free-lance foreign-policy
maneuvers, He ielishes recalling how a
visitor flew down to Georgia once to give
him the message: “The functions of the
foreign pulicies:of the United States are
the business of the State Department in
Washington, not of Mitchell WerBelt. in
Powder’ Springs. G In another
incident, a. congressional subcommittee
questioned him about his role in an
aborted attempt to launch an invasion of
Haiti from South Florida.

The subcommittee, the investigations
arm of the House Committee on Inter-
state and Foreign Commerce, was con-

cerned with the role played in the inva-
sion preparations by CBS News. The net-
work was attempting to film a documen-
tary on the military coup’ being-planned
by an alliance of Haitian and Cuban ex-
iles. ‘The. Haitians wanted to tepple
Francois, (Papa Doc) Duvalier; the
Cubans wanted to establish an anti-Cas-
tro base in Haiti. CBS was steered into
-the project by Andrew St: George,'a free-
lance journalist:adventurer. who also ‘in-
troduced Producer Jay McMullen to Wer- -
Bell in the procéss.

The network, aftcr spending opwatda
of $170,000 on the proposed decumentary,
Nassau, decided to serap it. “AS
a CBS News vice president wrote
in a Dec. 13, 1966. memo.
the non-adventures of a ra
to whom, Duvalier himself tooks: good, a
gang openly flouting U.S. law, in the end
to no purpose.”

‘The answers to “why" WerBell got in-
volved are, in the language of the sub-
committee report, variance” with
each other:

Answer No. t: felt then and I
feel now, and | will diwayy feel that any
effort or any activity that any American
can give to a group that is attempting to
Kill the boil and cancer of communism in
the Western Hemisphere deserves every
effort. This was my fundamental reason
for going into it. This was why I agreed to
assist them and why I did everything 1
could to assist them up to the point
where I felt the whole program was ridicu-
fous.”

Answer No. 2:1 took this whole proj-
ect as a rather entertaining comedy. I'm
afraid | approached it in this connection
and ! continued to do so. | felt that this
was a very amateurish attempt at some-
thing which 1 didn’t know really what
was going on, and it was an interlude of
entertainment as far as I'm concerned.”

The role he. played is also unclear.
From the point that CBS entered the sit-
wation in May of 1966. WerBell appeared
at various times to be nctwork consul-
tant, a CIA operative, a CIA operative
impostor, a leader of the invasiun, a U.S.
government spy on the invasion, a gun>
Pinner and a wired-ior-sound observer in
an attempt to shake down the Haitian
consul in Miami for $00,000 to call off
the invasion.

‘Suffice it to say that the entire episode
was typified by the fact that the 68-foot
sloop Poor Richard, s beat WerBell had
leased for the expedition, was repossessed
while Werdell and others had it docked
at the Ocean Reef motel in Key Largo.
“The. hoat never had anything on it ex-



WerBell told congressmen. :
Nevertheless, the U.S. government
raided the training area for the would-be
invaders, seized their arms and arrested
them in January, 1967, about two months
after WerBell h..d gone home. Seven per-
sons were indicted for conspiring to vio
neutrality laws — including
WerBeil. ‘Charges . against WerBell,
however, were dropped on orders of
= then-Attoney General Ramsey. Clark.
|_.- WerBell now ‘declines to’ discuss the
mechanics of how the charpen against
him were dropped, except to: say that he
was “in constant contact with the govern-
ment” during his participation in. the in-
vasion attempt and that he “did nothing
wrong.” In 1970, however, WerBell told
n.AUants magazine writer, “When you
work for the company, they take care of
you.” =
“The company” is genecally used as a
euphemism for the Céntral Intelligence
‘Agency — an arm of government WerBell
says now he has never had anything to do
with, except to sell it some guns. The
company he was talking about, he
was CBS, Over the years, however, Wer-
Bell has spoken often. of his association
with the Company. Producer McMullen
quoted WerBell to the congressmen as say-
ing he had “previous experience” with “the
_company:” “And when I asked him what
company he meant, he said the CLA," Mc-
Mullen said.

“Everybody always gets that impression
about any goddam th:ng we do,” WerBell
says. It is a conclusion that is neither
difficult nor illogical. It may not, however,
be accurate.

"To quéstions such as these, WerBell’s
standard reply is. “I guess I'm just lucky
More than just luck, however, WerBell’s
propensity for being inthe crucial place
at the crucial time seems to stem from a
combination of machismo, the profit mo-
yee. m knack for developing sums tly rad
teal weaponry and a plug-in to the Old Boy
Network.

‘The Old Boy Network — "And don’t you
ever kid yourself that there isn’t such @
thing,” says WerBeil — is the cloak-and-
dagger types’ answer to the union hiring
halt. It is a locsely structured help want-
ed-situation wanted grapevine. “I became
friends with a bunch of guys who are now
four- and five-star generals,” recalls Wer-
Bell of his days as an OSS captain behind
Japanese lines in World War 1.

Memo bilia of the OSS days and sub-
sequent. adventures hang in WerBell’s
home and in his psyche. The walls of both
his upstairs den and downstairs “war
room” are decorated with dozens of hunt-
ing (upstairs) and military (downstairs)
weapons. Six unsheathed swords are
mounted cn the door of the liquor cabinet,
Two glass display cases in the den, each
locked, contain handguns ranging. from
standard .45 automatics to single-shot
Assaxsination pistcls. Daggers, bayonets
and throwing knives fill the in-between
spares as bric-a-brac. Photographs of
short, slant-eved generals hang on wails
and stand on tables. Between two wild boar
heads above the den entrance is a framed
certificate fm the Vietnamese Airbome.

“The biggest war souvenir, though, isn't
on WerBell’s wall. {t is in his head — the
way a man of cts after more than 20
years of being in and on the fringes of vio-
lent conflicts. Some of it, obviously, is
affectation, Some of it is genuine. And
some of it just seems strange to 4n outsider

+. Such were the initial tactics in the Bat-
Ue of Abaco, a cause that, for awhile in the
British press, seemed second in anticipated

WerBell as a comrade-in-press release was

Bell in Powder Springs, WerBell said.

WerBell's former business associates, a
group of New York investment bankers
who bought WerBell and Bennett B.
Bintliff, an associate, out of the Military
Armament Corp. (MAC) that the pair had
founded. “He's been headline press all over

he’s a character. But letting him run Colt
or jetting him run MAC is like turning
loose a high-school hot-rodder to: run
General Motors.

WerBell and his associates in Powder
Springs have now reincorporated under the
name of Defense Systems Intemational
Inc. and have hired away several of MAC's
former weapons specialists. They are not
‘overly fond of Reeves and his people either.
“Tunnel vision" is one phrase they use to
describe MAC’s preoccupetion with gun,

banking, economic development. security

of the people on-Abaco know very little of
WerBell and Marger outside of whut they
i inthe Rritish press.

_, WerBell says his‘motivations ure strictly
 anticcommunist. A far right-winger — he
described himself to a newsmun as “to the
right of Attila the Hun" -— WerBell sees
the Bahamas as islands ripe for commu-
nism, “Every goddam single symptom that ~
resent in Cuba exists in the Bahamas:

emment and of the Bahamas’ pol
‘mate is one which meny observers of the
Bahainas do not share. Althouigh the over-
whelming majority of the islanders are
black and have become very assertive con-
cerning racial equality during the past de-
cade oF 50, the Banaras have been deeply
influenced by English tradition. The
‘Angiican and Baptist Churches, hoth cot
servative institutions, are heavily repre-
sented. And ‘the government is
ardently courting Pindling as a friend.

But WerBell, son and h ‘oscack
colonel, sees-the rise of Bolshevism where
see the peaceful emergence of a new
democratic naticn. And the -question is
whether or not to take him seriously ax ke
sits in Powder Springs with his bush jacket
and walrus moustache, talking of hiring
mercenaries and of naming a company
after what he thinks is the Greek letter
meaning war,”

The State Departme is
keeping a close watch, “You can’t write a
man off as aclown.”’ said one source, "if he
has a warehouse full af arms. We take him
seriously enough to want to know what he's
up to.” ful

Reference:

i. There are no Headquarter's traces on Dr. George A. Winkler, i
but'there are traces on, the Military Armament Corporation and its H
Board Chairman, Mr. Mitchell Livingston WerBell III (201-259910), H
In 1967 WerBell organized a firm called SIONICS, Incorporated i
(Studies in Operational Negation of Insugency and Counter Subversion), Hl
specializing in producing silencers. In 1970, Werbell Aged with j
Quantum Ordnance Bankers and the new firm was named the Military |

Armament Corporation’ with kerBell- as Chairman of the Board.

.2. ““WerBell- was born.on.'8 March 1918 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
He" served in: the’ OSS’ and:'was ‘of interest to BKHERALD in 1959 when it
was discovered-that.he was involved ‘with anti=Castro plotters in
the Dominican Republic. ‘lle was granted a POA in August 1959 but this
Was cancelled in October .1959..when his information proved to be of
little: value and it..was ‘suspected that’he was using BKHERALD funds H
to promote personal interests. He hds subsequently attempted to Hl
; pass himself as LNBUZZ connected. and as a BKHERALD employec. Nr.
WerBell's lengthy..201 file shows a long history of his appearing in
areas ‘and situations where he can make a fast buck.. He is character-
ized as unscrupulous, a "wheeler dealer", and a promotor of gtandiose :
schemes. WOTACK advises that the arms WerBell offers for sale are i
of good quality, but that the selling price is considered excessive. :

3. In that Mr. WerBell is a WODUAL citizen, the above infor-
mation should not be.passed to CGPAT/1. -However, the Station could
inform CGPAT/1 that “the Military Armament Corporation has an unsavory
Teputation and, although it may have permission from NVIDEA to export

orable Joseph J. Liebling

The t
Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense
(Security Policy)

Department of Defense
Washiagton, D. C- 20301

Dear Mr. Liebling:
: Re: -WerBell, Mitchell L., DT

_ I response to your letter of 16 February 1971 concerning
Mi. Mitchel! L. WerBell, III's alleged affiliation with tae Central
Intelligence.Agency, we have investigated the matter thoroughly,
_ and based on ali the information available, the answer is "No" -
for each of your questions numbered 1 through 6.

You should be advised that Mr. WerBell voluntarily con-
tacted a representative of the Central Intelligence Agency’s
estic Contact Service in Coral Gables, Florida; and at
eli's initiation furnished voluntary information for

the period 15 December 1965 - 19 November 1966 with eleven
contacts. It should be noted that the function of the Domestic

Contact Service is to receive information which individuals
feel is of interest to the United States Government. The office
is overtly listed in the telephone book under the Central Intel-

Lgence Agency and, therefore, is readily available for contact.

If Mr. WerBell suggests an affiliation with the Central
Intelligence Agency, he is hereby authorized to divulge the
details of his alleged affiliation in the hearing eo that he may
not use ostensible security as a means of avoiding answering

Sincerely,
Ven (fe tide

Lawrence R. Houston

‘which. appeared in the 26 february 1279 Edition :

SUBJECT -:.

_ 2. Butyect article reported that a CBS cameraman,
James, WILSON, had contacted CIA agente in Houston while

- on a. space shot assignment in 1966, and ‘that the CIA bad -
-Amforsed the FBI, who called on WILSON and referred hin. *

<"g! WH piviteton has ascertained -that on 30 June 1966, _

a James ‘WILSON called the CIA Duty Officer of the Domestic r

Contact Service (DCS) office in Hougton, Texas, and sub-
sequently related a story akout a proposed plot being
staged in the U.8, to invade Haiti and overthrow the
Duvalier Government, and that CES had convinced the parties
involved that they should allow CBS to Photograph and
televise a Special Program on the preparations. WILSON
requested ond received assurances from the DCS officer

that he would not be identified as the source of this
information. 7

3. On 6 July 1966, WH Division sent a blind memo~
randum to the federal Bureau of Investigation and the
Department of State which forwarded a resume of WILSON'S
@tory to the DCS, without identifying the source. The
meporandua atated that the source's motive for disclosing
this information was to alert the U.8, Government to
potentially enbarragsing situation if it were involved
in an insecure operation. The JMFAVE Station also passed
a resume of this information to the U.S, Custors Pureau

in Miami.

4. Except in connection with this report, there is .
no record of any operational iavolyvement ty the Agency

SUBJECT: BAKER, Bruce Arman

Ou 7 February, this gent}ernan AR ny office. His addres is:

Mr. a}. ie a) i
11379 President. “Drive, NE. aus. CM OSA
Blaine Villece, Minnesota
_Bisine Vilisge, Minnesota
i
Mr. Baker stated that he:has been in contact with a Mr. wtreupny~“20/- 75% 2)
“WERBELL, TIT of Powder Springs, Georgia. ;

"Mrs Baker says that Mr. Werbell is-in-the business of manufacturing -
weapons and delivering them ty air throughout the world. Mr. Baker
anderstands that Mr. Werbell does this for the Central Intelligence

Agency.
Mr. Boker thdt-Mr. Werbell is a supposedly reputable man.

Baker understands, from Werbell, that Baker will have to get a
CIA security ‘clearance to fly for Werbell.

Mr. Baker has served in the military. -He has had some paramilitary,
training. He belongs in a "jump club" and now participates in
“fréefali", etc. He has a Morse Code proficiency and a Radio
License Second Class. He has Spanish language proficiency and would
be willing to collect for us.

This man persists on pursuing me re this CIA/Werbell relationship.
I tell him I don't know a thing about it. It seems he has a smuggling
record when he was 17 and he's afraid this may keep him ifrom getting

this Werbell "CIA" clearance.
