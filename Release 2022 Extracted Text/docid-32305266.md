‘DETAILS:

I. EXISTENCE

Specific revelations relating to La Cosa Nostra
have previously been brought to light by a former Pittsburgh,
Pa., area native, which has established the existence of the
organization in this vicinity without question.

‘a. Organizational Background

PG T=1, a member source, who was initiated at
Pittsburgh, Pa., has advised that the Pittsburgh Burgata of
La Cosa Nostra was organized in about 1905, Prior to that
year, the. organization.was: commonly referred.to as the
"Black Hand" and was in control of members called "Commurista,"
who were mostiy Italians from Calabria, that area-in southern
Sicily located in the heel of the boot. He advised that the
term "Burgata," which may also be "Borgata," is the term
used to identify the "family" or group.

The aforementioned informant advised that he was
present at a Pittsburgh initiation ceremony during 1927, at
which time the Capo of the Pittsburgh group was STEVE
MONASTERA, The Sotto Capo’. was» (FNU) LANDOLINA,” He said
that.the term "Capo” is simply a‘term meaning "boss" or
leader, and that "Sotto Capo” is the title given to the
person who is his assistant in command of a Burgata.

PG T=-2, another member source, was questioned
specifically about his knowledge of the background of La Cosa
Nostra, He stated that he had heard stories about STEVE
MONASTERA, who was Capo of the Pittsburgh Burgata during the
latter 1920's, but recalled only’ that he had been gunned
down.as he was emerging from a Pittsburgh area-hospital.

When this informant was: asked if he recalled anything about
PEPINO SIRACUSA, who succeeded MONASTERA as :Capoy-he indicated
that*he recalled only that» SIRACUSA had been-killed in the
bathroom of his home, -which was located in the»Squirrel Hill
section-of Pittsburgh. He advised further that the tenures

of the aforementioned individuals were "before my time."

PG T=3, another member source, characterized

SEBASTIAN JOHN LA ROCCA as a “peace-loving homebody." He
stated. that LA ROCCA will never be observed at night clubs

42=

| NW 68486
Docld:32305266 Page 9



NW 68486

PG 92-599

cand rarely will be at sporting events, but that when he does

go to such places, he will never be seen in the company of
“any of our guys." He further advised as follows:

There was considerable “muscle" used by "us" in
Pittsburgh in the 1929's and 1930’s, "We" regularly forced
gamblers and club operators to take "us" in as partners in
spite of any objections, and anyone who resisted too much
would have his property damaged and his "head broken"
repeatedly until he accepted “Our man“ as his partner. Most
of the time, "we” bought our way'in by paying the gambler or
club operator one-half of what “we” decided was a fair price
for his total investment, but on occasions, "we" took a one-'
half partnership without laying out any money at all. JOE
ROSA and SAM MANNARINO used to travel everywhere together on
such assignments during that period.

When the “Jewish gamblers" would see MANNARINO and
ROSA walking down the street together, they all disappeared
as though hiding from the plague. It is recalled that in
about the late 1930's, two men opened a craps room in a
store front on Frankstown Avenue} near Paulson Avenue. One
day MANNARINO and ROSA walked into the joint and informed
the proprietors that as of that day they were fifty percent
partners, When the proprietors absolutely and profanely
rejected this idea, ROSA and MANNARINO drew revolvers. While
MANNARINO guarded the door, ROSA lined the two operators and
five patrons up with their backs to him and their faces to the
wall, MANNARINO and ROSA kept laughing and talking about
how they were going to have their own smaller Pittsburgh
version of the notorious St. Valentine's Day massacre in
Chicago. After a very few minutes of tormenting the seven
men against the wall in this’ fashion, the two operators broke
completely and pleaded to be’ allowed to share their gambling
profits.

According to this informant, in approximately
1942, LA ROCCA came on the scene°and peace came to the
Pittsburgh rackets, He was well liked by all of the
racketeers and was completely respected by everyone whom
he met. He quickly established the axiom that negotiation
would be utilized in place of assassination and he commenced
a policy of endeavoring to patch up disputes and grievances
by discussion and conciliation, If a.member was in violation
of any of the definitely forbidden acts of the group or was

~ 3 =

| Docld:32305266 Page 10



PG 92-599

intractable in relation to a lesser matter, LA ROCCA would
not hesitate to. authorize a “hits 7

\ :

The idea held by LA ROCCA that greater mutual
benefit and profit could result by peaceful arbitration
gradually proved its soundness to other racketeers in the
Pittsburgh area and the result is that there have been fewer
"mob killings" in the Pittsburgh district than in any other
city of comparable population: ‘Another result came about
because of this new LA ROCCA thinking. All of the members
of La Cosa Nostra in the Pittsburgh area became "workers,"
The old: policy of having stooges’ and outsiders control the
operation of a gambling establishment-while the leader sat
back and merely shared in the profits was abandoned. No
longer: would the leader pick up his business with a staff of
“musclemen,“ but these musclemen: became actively engaged in
the administration of the numerous gambling establishments
themselves.

This informant stated that when he was a young man,
"in my early 20's," GIOVANNI: BAZZANO was very fond of him and
frequently used him as a chauffeur, When BAZZANO was killed
by numerous ice pick stabs in NewYork City, however, everyone
knew he had it coming and felt no pity for him, BAZZANO is
buried in a cemetery in the New Kensington, Pao, area,
according to this informant. ~ —

PG T-4 advised that in the late 1920's and early
1930's, the two top groups in the Mafia in the Pittsburgh area
were headed by JOHN CANCELLIERI (deceased) of the North Side,
and the VOLPE brothers. of Wilmerding, Pa., headed by JOHNNY

-VOLPE (deceased), also known: as. "Prince Johnny." He stated

that: JOHNNY VOLPE was shot’ down ‘in July, 1932, on Wylie
Avenue, Pittsburgh, with his brothers, Srmmy and ARTHUR.

LOUIS: VOLPE and JOE VOLPE are the younger surviving brothers.
JOHN CANCELLIERI died about: 1965, and left his Rosa Villa
Restaurant at Sandusky and East General Robinson Streets to
his grandsons, JOHN and SAM. The father of these two boys,
SAM, died in 1947, and was an active Mafia man. The informant
was. not. .certain..of.the sons’ affiliation .with.La Cosa Nostra
but. knows that meetings are held ,at the Rosa Villa Restaurant

’ between LA ROCCA, the’ MANNARINOg* vand TONY. .RIPEPI::periodically.

He advised that in’ 1957, he made a visit to Italy
and learned that’ the Mafia members around Florence and Milan

-all claim to be Sicilians, even if they are Italian born,

He advised: further that there was.a gangland murder in the

PG 92-599

produce yards in Florence while he was there, and the father
and the brother of the victim witnessed the slaying, and
still would not ‘admit to the: cocepaanera that they saw any-
thing.

Informant advised: further regarding marriages that
formerly the members arranged the: matches when. their children
were still quite young. He stated a good example is the BAZZANO-
RIPEPI marriage, He knows this"was arranged as he has been
a long-time associate and friend. of TONY RIPEPI, He: further
stated that the marriage of TONY RIPEPI'’s oldest daughter
to COSTANZA (STANLEY) VALENTI ‘of*Rochester, Pa., was arranged
in a like fashion. This VALENTI-is a brother of FRANK VALENTI,
whom RIPEPI sponsored into La’ €osa: Nostra.

He advised’ further’ that STANLEY VALENTI refuses to
‘allow his wife to even visit her parents in Pittsburgh and
that he does not know the reason'for this, but knows that
‘there is bad blood between them,” The informant advised
regarding the term La Cosa Nostra, that he first heard this
used after the testimony of JOSEPH VALACHI., ‘He advised he
always,.knew of it locally. as "The Outfit." His interpretation
of the phrase La Cosa Nostra. is "our own home" or “our own
well-being," with emphasis on the "our own."

PG T=5 has advised that when he was a boy in
Pittsburgh, "the syndicate" bombed a grocery store owned by
his: father on Clay Way. in the lower Hill District because
his father had refused to pay $10,000 which was demanded for
the protection of his property, He said that the group of
specialized extortionists was known as the "Red Masks."

He: recalled that the group picked only on Italians and not
on native-born American citizens’ because it was felt that
the Italians would not talk or report their troubles to the
police, He stated that this group would actually seek out
laborers. and hard-working people’ who were earning from $1.00
to $1.25 a day and extort their meager savings from them
through threats... Their targets’ were carefully selected
and.each was sent a letter containing a small red mask,

They obtained their name from this practice.

“The aforementioned’ informant recalled that the
leader in the lower Hill District at the turn of the century
was DOMINICK DE FARNANDO, who waS also known as "Don"

* De Farnando, Following the bombing of his father's business

PG 92-599

several of his associates but had to release them for lack

of evidence, DE FARNANDO came to the father of the informant
“and apologized to him and also ‘told him that he was not
responsible for the bombing. The following night, to the best
recollection of the informant, two Italian racketeers from
the. Sharpsburg, Pa., area, were found at the bottom of a steep
ravine in Aspinwall, , They had”been knifed repeatedly.

In relation to the" VOLPE family of Wilmerding, Pa.,
the informant advised that: he has known them for more than
50 years, and delivered groceries to their home as a boy,
He deseribed them as “class Italians" in their day and
recalled that JOHN, also known as “Prince Johnny," was the
oldest son, who tried to move ‘into the lower Hill District in
the late 1920's and early 1930’s'in order to supervise the
lucrative booze business,. He retailed that every day without
fail, JOHNNY went to a barber shop a few doors away from the
Roma Coffee Shop on Wylie Avenue; for a facial and manicure,
It was. at this coffee shop that the triple killing of the
VOLPE brothers began, ARTHUR was hit first and JAMES was
killed at the counter, After being wounded, JOHNNY endeavored
to reach his Cadillac parked in front of the store, but fell
on the sidewalk and was shot°again. Accused of fingering the
"hit" was GAETANO BAZZANO and’ MIKE SPINELLI was the actual
hit man, Both were subsequently killed by mob action outside
of Pittsburgh.

bo General Observations Relating to the Initiat

Ceremony

PG T=-6 has: advisedthat the code of the: organization \
in Pittsburgh, at the time of hig initiation, was approximately
as follows: .

“Honor is stressed as the most sacred thing
in the world, To! destroy another person must
be for honor and not’woney alone, A member is
warned never to engage in an affair with the
wives of other members, A member must never
engage in white slavery or narcotics, both
crimes which are degrading to the name of the
organization, A tember must obey! the complaints
and instructions of his superior and is never
to.take the life ofa fellow member before
presenting his. grievance to the Commission. A

i “member must: do nothing which would affect the

i‘ organization without first receiving permission

from a superior."

II. ORGANIZATIONAL LEADERSHIP

a. Actual Leaders in the Pittsburgh Division

Those individuals who have been identified as occupy-
ing positions of leadership within the La Cosa Nostra group
in the Pittsburgh Division are as follows:

SEBASTIAN JOHN LA ROCCA, designated by .
reliable sources as “Capo” of the Western
Pennsylvania = West Virginia area and head

of Pittsburgh’s LA ROCCA-GENOVESE Organization.
MIKE GENOVESE, designated by reliable sources
as the “heir-apparent"™ to the position
presently held by LA ROCCA. He is most
usually referred to as°LA ROCCA's "top
lieutenant" and will definitely figure in the
power struggle f the ‘top spot when LA ROCCA
retires, despite the fact that sources indicate
that..LA_ROCCA.has..handpicked-him..as. his
successor, He has never been identified as an
organization member by an actual member source.

GABRIEL “KELLY” MANNARINO, designated by
reliable sources as the individual in charge of
the northern portion.of Western Pennsylvania,
but still below LA ROCCA in stature and
directly responsible to him,

FRANK AMATO, similarly ‘designated as the
"Underboss of the Pittsburgh Burgata," and a
power for many years in the Braddock, Pav,
vicinity.

LOUIS VOLPE, designated by reliable sources

as the individual who dominates racket activity
in the Turtle Creek Valiey area from his
Wilmerding, Pa., location,

ANTONIO RIPEPI, designated by reliable sources
as a close associate of LA ROCCA and the member
of La Cosa Nostra who is responsible for the
southern county of Western Pennsylvania.

Docld:32305266 Page 14

PG 92=599

b. Evaluation Obtained from Other Sources

Although the aforementioned individuals are the
actual leaders in the Pittsburgh area as determined by com-
prehensive investigation, récent information from informants,
who are closely associated with known and suspected organiza-
tion members, is of some value’ in gaining insight into the
structure and procedures of thé organization itself.

PG T-8 has advised that he was born in Italy and
has had overtures made to him to become a member of La Cosa
Nostra in the Pittsburgh area, He stated that he feels that
there’ is only one "family" in this vicinity and that it is
thoroughly controlled by SEBASTIAN JOHN LA ROCCA. He names
LA ROCCA, GENOVESE, MANNARINO,’ LOUIS VOLPE and RIPEPI as
members of La Cosa Nostra. :

PG T-9 has advised that SEBASTIAN JOHN LA ROCCA is
still very much in command of thé Western Pennsylvania racket
situation and has made this extremely clear in his most
recent "swing around the circuit." This swing was his first
since returning from his Bel Aire, Fla., winter residence. -
If LA ROCCA has any idea of retiring, and rumors are still
rampant that he has had this in mind for the past two years,
he certainly does not indicate. his intentions by his behavior.
It is quite evident to those who associate with him that he
cannot..retire without a specific directive from someone to
whom he is responsible and that this directive has been
delayed for some reason.

Those in the rackets, according to this informant,
believe that the role of LA ROCCA as a peacemaker has
extended his tenure and responsibility and that "organization"
administrators are loathe to remove him for fear of open
conflict relating to the choice of a successor, This "blood
bath" is not beyond the realm. of ‘possibility in this regard.

The two leading candidates for the position at this time
appear to be MIKE GENOVESE and GABRIEL MANNARINO, with
GENOVESE holding the inside track as the personal pick of
LA ROCCA, who has groomed him for many years.

ec. Death of a Pittsburgh Leader and Identified
Organization Member

SAMUEL MANNARINO, a leader and identified member of
the Pittsburgh "family" died of cancer at his home in New

Kensington, Pa., on June 5, 1967, Friends were received at
the Manzella=-Giunta Funeral Home, 1509 Fifth Avenue, Arnold,
Pa., and burial was on June 8, 1967, at Greenwood Memorial
Park in Lower Burrell, Pa.

On the date of burial, numerous individuals, including
known members of La Cosa Nostra and suspected members of the
organization, were observed paying their last respects by
Pittsburgh informants, The death of MANNARINO attracted a
great deal of local publici and hundreds of curiosity-
seekers were also observed at the funeral rites.

PG T=10 advised that the last will and testament
of SAMUEL MANNARINO had been filed at the Westmoreland County
Court House in Greensburg, Pa.) and that SAM had apparently
left everything to his wife, ROSE, He said that in the
event that anything happened to ROSE, SAM's daughter and
grandchild, MINNIE CARLUCCI and JAMEY ROSE CARLUCCI, would
inherit the estate belonging to MANNARINO, This informant
indicated that SAM had also designated ROSE as the sole
executrix and that in the event something happened to ROSE
within.one month of the death of SAM, SEBASTIAN JOHN LA ROCCA
was to be the. executor and guardian of the estate of the
grandchild until this grandchild reached the age of 21...

PG 92-599

The sponsor or godfather would take a knife or pin
in the Pittsburgh ceremony and draw blood from the candidate
by pricking one of his fingers. The blood was smeared on a
holy card which was then set aflame and placed in the cupped |
hand of the candidate, While the card burned, the sponsor
would affirm that the candidate would uphold the code of the I
organization and that if he should fail in this regard, his |
body would be destroyed as symbolized by the burning of the
card, Following this ceremony, all members always embraced |
the new member and kissed him’on both cheeks.

PG T=7 was shown the description of the initiation
ceremony for La Cosa Nostra and expressed some opinions
about it, He indicated that the stress upon the word “honor”
is quite accurate and certainly reveals a great deal about
“our group.” For example, he pointed out the prohibition
against the killing of ome member by another for financial |
motives alone should also show a similar prohibition of such
an act merely to attain power He said that while one
member may kill another immediately upon having his honor
affronted or in self=defense, he is not allowed to do so ata
later time when he should have cailed off, without having
first secured permission from his superiors.

This informant advised that another thing which
should be added to the induction ceremony is the prohibition }
of any device, especially a bomb, which could cause injury

or death to anyone except the member to be "hit." He

said that any grievance serious énough to warrant the killing
of one member by another is a personal thing, but that this
can never justify the injury or death of children, wives or
bystanders, He pointed out that this slovenly method of
hitting someone is probably best illustrated by the incidents
which have occurred in the Youngstown, Ohio, area in recent
years, He said that the use of bombs for a "hit" at
Youngstown, during which other. innocent people were killed,
so infuriated “us” that it has béen necessary "to get rid

of a lot of young guys." He said that not only are members
prohibited from engaging in narcotics traffic and in white
slavery, but they are prohibited from participation in any
phase of counterfeiting. He could not say that the holding
of a burning. holy card is never used in an induction ceremony
but that he personally "never got no burns on my hands that
wayo" He did, however, have his finger pricked.

ec. Other Matters Pertaining to Membership

When PG T=14 was asked how large the membership of
La Cosa Nostra is in the Pittsburgh area, he replied by asking
the interviewing agent to suggest an estimate, The figure 50
was mentioned, at which time the informant asked, "Does that
intlude Philadeiphia?" He was told that the figure guessed
represented only Western Pennsylvania, and the informant said
that the figure should have been more like 30 and that only
six.of..these..are_at..all.active, “No amount of persuasion could
get him to identify the six active members,

This informant advised that JOHNNY BAZZANO, the son

of GIOVANNI BAZZANO, is married to one of the daughters of

ANTONIO-RIPEPI. When asked whether JOHNNY would be a member
of La Cosa Nostra, particularly because he is the son of a
former Capo, this informant shook his head negatively and
stated, "He’ll always be just JOHNNY." When he wds asked
whether JAMES PAUL SALAMONE of Erie, Pa., was a member of the
Pittsburgh Burgata, this informant said that he did not know
him, He then indicated that he knew this individual as JIMMY
WESTFIELD and stated emphatically that SALAMONE "does not
belong to our Pittsburgh group.”

When the aforementioned informant was asked who
it was who. sponsored the MANNARINO brothers for membership
in La Cosa Nostra, he simply shrugged. When it was suggested
to him that the sponsor might have been SEBASTIAN JOHN LA ROCCA,
he grinned and said, “Who else?"

During the latter portion of February, 1967, PG T=17
furnished the following information:

In Western Pennsylvania, there are a lot of characters
who’ falsely profess to be members of La Cosa Nostra or the
Mafia or to be closely associated with members. These people,
generally speaking, are small-tite racketeers or in some sort
of criminal fringe business, such as vending machine routes.

For some reason, these people believe that the circulation

_of..such..stories..will. frighten competitors and enemies and

will cause local political and law enforcement officers to
give them more respect and a wider latitude in operating.

An example of this ig a man named JOHN COSTELLO,
who is now deceased but who formerly resided in Homer City,
Pa. This guy was about 5'8"stali, 220 pounds, heavy build,
dark complexion, blind in one eye *and had a wooden leg.

He used to.do some bootlegging of moonshine whiskey down
around Monessen, Pa., in the middle 1920's and early 1930's.
In the 1940's, he controlled most of the slot machines and

illegal.pinballs in Indiana County. It is believed he

operated a saloon or two in the Homer City - Indiana area
in the late .1940"s or early 1950's.

In any event, COSTELLO‘used to tell. associates
that he was a member of the "Mafia" and that he had meetings
with JOHN LA ROCCA, DOM ANZALONE, SAM MANNARINO and others,
when actually these men hardiy knew who COSTELLO was. When
SAM MANNARINO heard that COSTELLO. was boasting about being
a close associate of his friends, MANNARINO suggested that

‘COSTELLO be "hit," but LA ROCCA said COSTELLO wasn't worth

the risk and was not a threat to anyone in any manner. LA ROCCA
said that if COSTELLO was "hit" it might make some people
believe he. actually had been a member of La Cosa Nostra.
However, LA ROCCA did say they would dispose of COSTELLO if

he .ever..infringed on the activities of any of their. people,

such as to try to place any of his machines in an area
controlled by one of their men.

| NW 68486

PG 92-599

COSTELLO became ill in the early 1950's and sub-
sequently died, so it was never necessary to deal. with him,

When asked when and where the last ceremony admitting
new members of La Cosa Nostra’ took place, he merely said, "A
long time ago = too-long, maybe.” He would not elaborate on
this.

He was asked directly if SONNY CIANCUTTI and JOHN
FONTANA were La Cosa Nostra members, and he responded by

. saying, ."They.might as well be, |They have to live the same

and obey ali the rules.” When he was pressed to answer the
question, he replied, with a smile, "Not yet."

PG T-11 advised that in about 1959, just before
DOMINICK ANZALONE, a known member of La Cosa Nostra and a close
associate of SEBASTIAN JOHN LA ROCCA, moved to-California,
he operated a casino at Ligonier; Pa, LA ROCCA, described
by the informant as “the Capo of ‘the Pittsburgh "Family,"
instructed ANZALONE that he must:take in certain additional
partners in this casino and itiwas a short time later that
the new partners took over the eritire operation but promised
ANZALONE a share of the profits. ANZALONE moved to San Jose,
Calif... in 1960, and received approximately three cash pay-
ments of about $10,000 each as his share from the casino
profits, The payments were cut.off without notice shortly ™
thereafter, More than one yéar passed in which no payments
were made to ANZALONE and he decided to send one CHARLES
CARBONE to Pittsburgh to act’ as a personal representative in
an effort to secure his interest in the club. Contact by
CARBONE with LA ROCCA brought'no results. Five years have
now gone by and ANZALONE continues to feel that he should
share in the profits of the casino. He recently discussed
this matter with SAL TARANTO to ascertain whether TARANTO
would consider traveling to Pittsburgh to act in his behalf.
TARANTO declined because of poor’ health, but suggested that
consideration..be.given.to sending TONY LIMA as the personal
representative of ANZALONE inasmuch as LIMA has been closely
associated with LA ROCCA in the past.

TARANTO pointed out that LIMA is reliable and
could handle most situations’ and that ANZALONE actually owed
him this opportunity for past favors and the loyalty LIMA
has shown to ANZALONE, ANZALONE: stated that he would con-
sider sending LIMA and GEORGE ADRAGNA together to contact LA
ROCCA,' The informant pointed out that the loss of the
interest of ANZALONE in the Ligonier operation and his loss

=~ i4.-

| Docld:32305266 Page 21



PG 92-599

of approximately $50,000 to FRANK SORCE in the Peter Piper
Motors, San Jose, business venture, has been embarrassing to
him. and he senses that he has lost the respect of the San
Jose Family. \

The informant indicated that ANZALONE continues
to lose the respect of his fellow members because he con-
tinually complains about his~loss of money while making no
effort to recover what is rightfully his. The fact that he
is extremely wealthy and still'worries about his money has
brought only disgust from fellow’ members who no longer. have
sympathy for him. .

On May §, 1967, the aforementioned informant
advised that he had visited with ANZALONE earlier that week
and that ANZALONE appeared to’ be im poor spirits as a result
| of his concern relating to a deportation hearing. His attorney
had instructed him to discontinue association with anyone of :
| questionable reputation until the conclusion of his hearing ‘
| and ANZALONE continued to.moan' that "JOHN LA ROCCA is making \
money by the bushel basket." : ‘

In discussing further information concerning
ANZALONE, this informant advised that when ANZALONE moved
| from Pennsylvania to California, he was placed on the payroll
| of the California Cheese Company in San Jose, for the purpose
of making it appear to the Immigration and Naturalization
Service that he was legitimately employed, This company is
owned and: operated by SAL MARINO, former Capo de Decina of
San Jose. Personal differences soon developed between the
two and the relationship was:severed. MARINO, however, had
cleverly filtered word back to LA ROCCA in Pittsburgh that
ANZALONE had made specific derogatory remarks concerning u
LA ROCCA, This caused LA ROCCA to become disenchanted with
ANZALONE , who countered through his sources and was ultimately
successful in convincing LA ROCCA that the accusations made
by MARINO were untrue. As a result, MARINO was replaced as
Capo de Decina by his son',* ANGELO. This has been. considered
as.a "slap in the face." The LA ROCCA-ANZALONE friendship
will: never.be the same and since this incident, ANZALONE has
been most circumspect in his contact with the: MARINOs,

The informant pointed owt that ANZALONE originally
came to the United States on a specific assignemnt ordered
by the-Mafia in Sicilys--He was to kill JOHN BONDI, who had
fled from Sicily to Pittsburgh, Pa., after killing three
members of the Mafia in Sicily, BONDI, who-is now deceased,
was a cousin of TONY LIMA. Because ANZALONE-was a‘close

PG 92-599

friend of the father of TONY LIMA, LIMA stepped in to act

as peacemaker and BONDI and ANZALONE became friends. ANZALONE
later became a member of the STEVE MONASTERA Family in
Pittsburgh.

While living in Pittsburgh, prior to the takeover
by JOHN LA ROCCA, ANZALONE learned through the grapevine
that his wife, a resident of Sicily, was having a love affair,
It was mandatory at that time that a La Cosa Nostra member
avenge this disgrace and ANZALONE returned to Sicily to kill
both his wife and her lover, Instead of doing this, he forgave
his wife, separated from her and returned to Pittsburgh.
He had dishonored himself and was dropped from the MONASTERA
Family, He was reinstated by PEPINO SIRACUSA following the
death of MONASTERA and he again became active in La Cosa
Nostra activities,

On August 8, 1966, FRANK AMATO was interviewed at
his home at 430 Second Street, Braddock, Pa.

AMATO said that he was born in Naples, Italy, and
spent the first 17 years of his life there. During his early
youth, he was employed as a barber from the time he was
approximately 14 years of age. He came to this country
alone in late 1910, and spent six or seven months in New York
City.working.as.a.barber. In 19i1,.an uncle from Braddock,
Pao, sent him a train ticket’ and money to come to Pittsburgh,
and he moved to Braddock and has lived there since that time,

AMATO said that he was' employed as a barber in
Braddock at first and that eventually he bought a bar known
as "The Brandywine." He said that his employees were all
Italians, and one of them was one of the ANDOLINA brothers.
He said that he finally quit the: saloon business because his
employees were robbing him.

AMATO said that he has very little income now,
relying on his social security and meager receipts from his
pinball machines, During 1965, he earned about $6,600 from
these sources, He does not service the machines himself,
but has contracted them to AL MC CULLOUGH, a Wilkinsburg

‘distributor who handles all the pinball maintenance and pays

FRANK a percentage’ of the profit. This percentage, plus

his’ social security, makes up his income, AMATO said that
the Adrilee Motel is not his, but his son's. He said he helps
his son but does not take any money in income’ from the
operation of the motel. He said he had nothing to do with

PG 92-599

numbers, Everyone calls him a hoodlum and a gangster because
of his association with numetous: other Italians in the

'Pittsburgh area, AMATO said that he knows VITO BONACCI very”

well, having spent 55 years in Braddock with VITO, because ~
BONACCI’s family was from the town where AMATO was born and
vaised, He pointed out that it was natural for Italians

to associate with other Italians*in this country when they

had a common background and a common language. He said that
JOSEPH NUGARA had married one’ of’his daughters and he was

quite friendly with NUGARA also.: He said that he was well-
acquainted with "ARCHIE" NELSON and was a close personal friend
of SEBASTIAN JOHN LA ROCCA, He Said that he met VITO GENOVESE
at a wedding approximately ten years ago, but he was not a close
friend of GENOVESE, He said he did not know JOSEPH BARBARA and
was not at "the gathering” at Apalachin, New York, in 1957.

His son-in-law, KELLY MANNARINO, was there, AMATO said that

he had heard of La Cosa Nostra’ while reading a story written

by JOSEPH VALACHI, but he: felt’ that this was the result of

an over=active imagination on the part of the writer, He

Said..that.he.did.not.know.anything about the organization, nor

was he a member. He said he’ was not a member of the Mafia,
nor had he ever been a member,

AMATO said that he had never been in trouble in
his life, although he had beén arrested on a murder charge
in 1927, He said that he was not anywhere near the area
of the murder and had a witness to prove it. The charges
against him were dropped, Concerning a shooting in his
home about five or six years:ago, AMATO said that two
individuals came to his home in the evening, and his pregnant
daughter answered the door, These individuals shoved their
way into the house at gunpoint,.and ransacked his home
looking for a box which AMATO said did not exist. The box
was ostensibly filled with cash.* AMATO said that he was
able, after a tense and trying period in his home, to pull a
gun from his waistband (a gun he'said he always carried with
him) and was able to shoot one of the thieves in the leg.
He said he ran upstairs to try to get the other thief, but
this individual jumped from an upstairs window and escaped.
When he returned downstairs, the individual who he had shot
appeared to be coming after him again, and he shot him in the
head, He pointed out that he did this to protect his wife
and pregnant daughter from phySical harm at the hands of the
intruders, AMATO said that after shooting this individual in
the head, he called the police. He indicated that he had no
other arrests, and had spent his life helping people.

AMATO advised that he:has five daughters and one son.
One of his daughters is married to JOSEPH NUGARA and another
to MICHAEL SCHERBANIC, Allegheny County Deputy. Sheriff. He
said that SCHERBANIC and his’ daughter reside on the top floor |
of tthe AMATO. home, He concluded’ the interview by stating
that he was happy to have beén céntacted and would welcome a
recontact at any time in the future,

PG T-8-has advised that he has some reservations
about the CANCELLIERI brothers, JOHN and SAM, who are grand- i
sons of old JOHN CANCELLIERI, whom the informant feels was
definitely a member of the old Mafia. He also’named ‘JOHN
FONTANA, formerly of New Kensington, Pa., as a possible member
of the organization.

With relation to FRANK VALENTI, the aforementioned
informant advised that he has’ known this individual for more |
than 30 years and that he is positive that VALENTI is a member
of La Cosa Nostra, He indicated’ that VALENTI might possibly
have been initiated in about 1947 or 1948, and that he was
sponsored either by JOHN CANCELLIERI or SEBASTIAN JOHN LA ROCCA,.

IV. CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES

a. Information Relating to the Influence of the~:.
Organization in the Pittsburgh Numbers Racket

PG T-18 has advised that the Italian syndicate in
Pittsburgh had taken over a good portion of the numbers opera-
tion controlled by TONY GROSSO and that the only remaining
independent book in Pittsburgh was on the North Side. This
informant hastened to say, however, that he had heard from i
avery reliable source that the syndicate in Pittsburgh does Hl
“not have the capital to handle the GROSSO operation and that
SEBASTIAN JOHN LA ROCCA has made the statement that he is .
not interested in taking over the numbers action because !
there is too much concentration on it by Federal officials and jl
some law enfortement agencies, He has always felt that such i
an operation would. be nothing. but a headache to La Cosa Nostra.

PG T=-19 has advised that he refuses to believe
that La Cosa Nostra will ever take over the city of Pittsburgh
numbers racket and no one he has talked to in the rackets has
any fear of this happening at the present time. They reason, |
according to the informant, that the organization will not °
- pay, and that means no repeat business. He said that La Cosa

PG 92-599

Nostra representstives, in the numbers racket may pick: up a
lot: of "nickel and dime business! that the big independents
will not care: about losing, but that no big bettors will go’
to them because of their habit ief "walking" hits they feel
they cannot cover.

The aforementioned: informant indicated that the
numbers racket seems: to be:at’its lowest ebb in years in the
Pittsburgh area and that there is more distrust among its
operators than ever before,’ He said that police shakedowns
have not diminished one bit and,;?in fact, have picked up
‘since the acquittal of former Assistant Superintendent LAWRENCE
Ji MALONEY, He stated that there is no one officer getting
as big a cut as MALONEY got but that more men down through the
ranks are taking what they cafi‘get.

PG T-20 was asked about the East Liberty numbers
book, fronted by JAKE LERNER and PHIL GENOVESE, older brother
of MIKE. He indicated that it~-is positively syndicate-controlled
and handled by MIKE GENOVESE, acting under the orders of
SEBASTIAN JOHN LA ROCCA, He: stated that there is no other
book in Pittsburgh that is synditated in that no one dictates
the operation of any other book’ except the man operating the
book, .He indicated that La Cosa’Nostra has control? only to
the degree: that members such as LA ROCCA, SICA and the: VOLPES
_may...beasked..tolend.alange.amount..of money, for instance
$25,000 or more, Their asking price is never pressure or
control but merely a fat intérest.and prompt payments.

On August 2, 1966, Corporal JOHN REDIGAN of the
Pennsylvania State Police at “Greensburg, Pa., advised that
investigation by his squad had determined that "PATSY"
STANIZZO and FELIX GENOVESE,:the:older brother of MIKE, had
recently started to meet various-runners to receive their
daily numbers packs for subsequent delivery to the headquarters
counting office of the JAKE LERNER numbers combine. LERNER
is the front for the LA ROCCA-GENOVESE Organization in this
particular phase of the numbers operation, He indicated that
both individuals were extremely "tail conscious" and that
his squad was having a great. deal of difficulty in finding
the meeting place, which would change every day. .He requested
assistance in determining in’ advance where the meeting place
would be,

On August. 2, 1966, PG T-9 was contacted in relation

to this problem and he advised that each day between 2:20 PM
and 2:30 PM, the numbers runner from Wilmerding; Pao,

| = 19. -

receives a telephone call from an individual who tells him
where he should deliver his: packs to the JAKE LERNER head-
quarters representatives, Hé sdid that it is the custom of -

various writers in the Turtle’ Creek Valley area of Allegheny

3:25 PM and 3:35 PM. Although the area changes constantly,
the pass had occurred for several days prior to this time in:
the Pittsburgh - Wilkinsburg:border area. He named) five
individuals to whom the turnovers’ would probably be made and
furnished..a..complete.description"of each of these individuals.
He said that he could probably obtain information as to the
turnover site on August 3, 19666

On August 35 1966, the’ aforementioned informant

-advised that he had learned of the specific area of the turn-

over and named it as the intersection of Pitt and Franklin

Streets in Wilkinsburg, The’ Pennsylvania State Police was

‘immediately apprised of this information and at approximately

3231 PM, STANIZZO and FELIX GENOVESE were observed sitting

ina 1963 black Cadiliae convertible at the aforementioned

intersection, Their car boré’a dealer's license plate and

at 3:38 PM, a 1960 white Dodge’sedan, bearing one unknown

male, pulled alongside the Cadillac and handed its occupants

a brown paper bag. The Pennsylvania State Police surveillance

was "made" immediately and the’ GENOVESE car sped away,

running a stop sign and turning into a mneswaystreet.

Approximately half way down the street, STANIZZO threw the bag
_...from.the..carn.window and the tar was brought to a stop by

pursuing State Police cars. GENOVESE and STANIZZ0 appeared

to be extremely angry and worried.

PG T-21 has been. questioned specifically about the
| 2 background of the development’ of the utilization of JAKE

/ LERNER as a front for. the La Cosa Nostra numbers operation
in the Pittsburgh, Pao, area.

He stated that during the early portion of 1965,
the family of LERNER became interested in returning JAKE to’
Pittsburgh from Arizona, where he had become a heavy drinker.
He indicated that inasmuch as TONY GROSSO, the leading man

- in the Pittsburgh numbers picture, was facing a prison sen-
.tence,:.LERNER.felt that he could return to Pittsburgh and
operate a large bookmaking operation that would eventually
nove in when GROSSO was incaréerated.

The following additional information was.contributed
by the informant in this regard;

LERNER was contactéd by one of the members of the |
CANCELLIERI: family from the North Side of Pittsburgh shortly.
after his return from Arizona and LERNER was requested) to
meet’ with FELIX GENOVESE, older: brother of MIKE, and JPHN
'FONTANA, LERNER was asked: to come alonf to the Phoenix Motel
at Monroeville, Pa., at which’ place the two, aforementioned
individuals requested him to’ handie\the bookmaking operation
for the LA ROCCA-GENOVESE: Organization, He was promised
certain territories that were’already in the possession of. H :
the organization, and LERNER“advised them during the meeting

‘that he was not interested in: the proposition. In thinking
it over, however, LERNER realized that he could again be a
big man and that because the syndicate had asked him to do
them a favor, he could once again be in the dbiver's seat.
He visualized himself as the successor to TONY GROSSO. c

ie. :
Numerous meetings: among PELIX GENOVESE, JOHN FONTANA

and: JAKE LERNER took place and LERNER eventually met with

MIKE GENOVESE, /At the conclusion of this meeting, LERNER was

put in charge of the organization's numbers operation.

GENOVESE turned over to LERNER the bookmaking operations in

the East Liberty, Homewood,’ Squirrel Hill, North Side and

South Side areas of Pittsburgh; specified areas within the

Pittsburgh city limits, including the Hill District and the

Market area, and the New Kensington, Pa., area. FONTANA was

to handle the East Liberty and New Kensington'area, and

GENOVESE was to handle the Squirrel Hill and Homewood areas,

Other organization individuais would be placed in charge of

the additional territories, “The* total play was always

turned over to one of the organization representatives at

a designated location and the package was then taken to a

"bank," This bank, of course, had its location changed daily,

and all individuals were constantly aware of surveillances,

Occasionally, rooms. in downtown’ Pittsburgh hotels were

utilized for "bank" purposes% ©

b. Investigations Being Cofducted by Other Federal
Agencies which Relate:'to: La Cosa Nostra

On February 21, 1967,.a United Press International
release datelined Washington,” DB Cs: appeared in the "Pittsburgh.
Press," captioned, "Flying Squads Shadowing Crime Lords." It
indicated that a nationwide attatk has begun on at’ least
18 of the 24 big Cosa Nostra "families" that reportedly run
organized crime in the United*States and that the vehicle» |
for the assault that will’ touch tities from Massachusetts to
Florida to California, is a flying squad of investigative
experts from five Federal agencies, The release stated that
the squad is directed by the Justice Department's Organized

Crime..Section headed. -by.. HENRY.E....PETERSON..and_.includes members

from the Federal. Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue
Serwice, the Bureau of Narcotiés« .and..the.\Labor: Departmant o

PETERSON, according’ to the release, said that much!’
of the effort will be aimed at irregularities that could
lead: to action against the legitimate businesses being used
as fronts by the syndicate. He listed the men and the, areas
as major targets in the drive; and one of these is "JOHN
LA ROCCA of Pittsburgh. ®" The Pittsburgh paper contained an
additional writeup on LA ROCCAs

A great many television and newspapermen converged
on the Ingomar, Pa., residence’ of LA ROCCA on February 22,
1967, as the result of extensive’ publicity given to LA, ROCCA
in the newspaper of that date; No family members were at
home, inasmuch as LA ROCCA and his wife had left the area
for their Florida winter residence during the: second week in
January, as anticipated.  Newsmen indicated that they would
concentr@te: on photographs of the: North Star Cement Block
Company, owned by LA ROCCA. Oye

On May 26, 1967, a hoeting was held in the Grand
Jury Room of the United States Post Office and Court House,
Building at Pittsburgh, Pa.’ Attendees represented the
Alcohol and Tobacco Tax Division’, the Internal Revenue Service,
the United States Secret Ser¥Yice’and the United States
Attorney's Office, in addition: tO the Federal Bureau of
