'DETAILS:

I. EXISTENCE

Specific revelations relating to La Cosa Nostra

have previously been brought to light by a former Pittsburgh,

Paod

area native, which has established the existence of the

organization in

this vicinity without question.

a Organizational Background

PG I-l, a member source, who was initiated at

Pittsburgh, Pa. o

has advised that

the Pittsburgh Burgata of

La Cosa Nostra was organized in about 1905.

Prior to that

year, the organization was commonly referred to as the

"Black Hand" and was in control of members called "Commurista,"

who were mostly Italians from Calabria, that area in southern

Sicily located in the heel of the boot.

He advised that the

"Burgata " which may also be "Borgata," is the term

used to identify the "family" or group.

The aforementioned informant advised that he was

present at a Pittsburgh initiation ceremony during 1927, at

which time

MONASTERA.

the Capo of the Pittsburgh group was STEVE

was (FNU) LANDOLINA, He said

that the term "Capo" is simply a term meaning "boss" or

leader, and that "Sotto Capo" is the title given to the

person

who is his assistant in command of a Burgata.

PG To?, another member source, was questioned

specifically about his knowledge of the background of La Cosa

Nostra.

He stated that he had heard stories about STEVE

MONASTERA, who was Capo of the Pittsburgh Burgata during the

latter 1920's, but recalled only that he had been gunned

down as he was emerging from a Pittsburgh area hospital.

When

this informant was asked if he recalled anything about

PEPINO SIRACUSA, who succeeded MONASTERA as Capo, he indicated

that he recalled only that SIRACUSA had been killed in the

bathroom of his home, which was located in the Squirrel Hill

section of Pittsburgh. He advised further that the tenures

of the aforementioned

individuals were "before my time."

PG T-3, another member source, characterized

SEBASTIAN JOHN

LA ROCCA as a "peace-loving homebody."

He

stated that LA ROCCA will never be observed at night clubs

-

## Page 10

PG 92-599

and rarely will be at sporting events,

but that when he does

He further advised as follows:

There was

considerable "muscle" used by "us" in

Pittsburgh in the 1920's and 1930's.

"We" regularly forced

gamblers and club operators to take

"us" in as partners in

spite of any objections, and anyone who resisted too much

would have his property damaged and his "head broken"

repeatedly until he accepted "our man" as his partner.

Most

of the time, "we" bought our way in by paying the gambler or

club operator one-half of what "we" decided was a fair price

for his total investment, but on occasions, "we" took a one-.

half partnership without laying out any money at all.

ROSA

and SAM MANNARINO used to travel everywhere together on

such assignments during that period.

When the "jewish gamblers" would see MANNARINO and

ROSA walking down the street togethel"is recalled that in

they all disappeared

as though hiding from the plague. It

about the late 1930'5, two men opened a craps room in a

store front on Frankstown Avenue, near Paulson Avenue.

One

day MANNARINO and ROSA walked into the joint and informed

the proprietors that as of that day they were fifty percent

partners..

When the proprietors absolutely and profanely

rejected this idea, ROSA and MANNARINO drew revolvers.

While

MANNARINO guarded

the door, ROSA lined the two operators and

five patrons up with their backs to him and their faces to the

wall.

how

MANNARINO and ROSA kept laughing and talking about

they were going to have their own

smaller Pittsburgh

version of the notorious St. Valentine's Day massacre in

Chicago. After a very few minutes of tormenting the seven

men against the wall in this fashion, the two operators broke

completely and pleaded to be allowed

to share their gambling

profits.

According to this informant, in approximately

1942, LA ROCCA came on the scene and peace came to the

Pittsburgh rackets. He was well liked by all of the

was completely respected by everyone whom

he met.

He quickly established the axiom that negotiation

would be utilized in place of assassination and he commenced

a policy of endeavoring to patch up disputes and grievances

by discussion and conciliation. If a member was in violation

of any of the definitely forbidden acts of the group or was

intractable in relation to a lesser matter,, LA ROCCA would

not hesitate to authorize a "hit."

The idea held by LA ROCCA that greater mutual

benefit and profit could result by peaceful arbitration

gradually proved its soundness to other racketeers in the

Pittsburgh area and the result is that there have been fewer

"mob killings" in the Pittsburgh district than in any other

city of comparable population. Another result came about

"musclemen," but these musclemen became actively engaged in

the administration of the numerous gambling establishments

buried in a cemetery in the New Kensington, Pa.&

area,

according to this informant.

PG Io4 advised that in the late 1920's

and early

1930's, the two top groups in the Mafia in the Pittsburgh area

were headed by JOHN CANCELLIERI (deceased) of the North Side,

and the VOLPE brothers of Wilmerding, Pa., headed by JOHNNY

VOLPE (deceased), also known as "Prince Johnny." He stated

JOHN CANCELLIERI died about 1965, and left his Rosa Villa

Restaurant at Sandusky and East General Robinson Streets to

his grandsons, JOHN and SAM. The father of these two boys,

SAM, died in 1947, and was an active Mafia man.

The informant

was not certain of the sons' affiliation with la Cosa Nostra

but knows that meetings are held at the Rosa Villa Restaurant

between LA ROCCA, the MANNARINOs" and TONY RIPEPI periodically.

He advised that in 1957, he made a visit to Italy

and learned that the Mafia members

around Florence and Milan

• all claim to be Sicilians, even if they are Italian born.

He advised further that there was a gangland murder in the

PG 92-599

produce yards in Florence while he was there, and the father

and the brother of the victim witnessed the slaying, and

still would not admit to the Carabinieri that they saw any-

thing.

Informant advised further regarding marriages

that

formerly the members arranged the matches when their children

were still quite young. He stated a good example is the BAZZANO-

RIPEPI marriage.

He knows this was arranged as he has been

a long-time associate and friend of TONY RIPEPI.

He further

stated that the marriage of TONY RIPEPI's oldest daughter

to COSTANZA (STANLEY) VALENTI Of Rochester, Pa, was arranged

in a like fashion.

This VALENTI is a brother of FRANK VALENTI,

whom RIPEPI sponsored into La Cosa Nostra.

He advised further that STANLEY VALENTI refuses to

allow his wife to even visit her parents in Pittsburgh and

that he does not know the reason for this, but knows that

there is bad blood between them.

The informant advised

regarding the term La Cosa Nostra, that he first heard this

used after the testimony of JOSEPH VALACHI. 'He advised he

always knew of it locally as "The Outfit."

His interpretation

of the phrase La Cosa Nostra is "our own home" or "our own

well-being," with emphasis on the "our own."

.. :..

PG T-5 has advised that when he was a boy in

Pittsburgh, "the syndicate" bombed a grocery store owned by

his father on Clay Way in the lower Hill District because

his father had refused to pay $10,000 which was demanded for

the protection of his property.

He said that the group of

specialized extortionists was known as the "Red Masks.

He recalled that the group picked only on Italians and not

on native-born American citizens because it was felt that

the Italians would not talk or report their troubles to the

police. He stated that this group would actually seek out

laborers and hard-working people who were earning from $1.00

to $1.25 a day and extort their meager savings from them

through threats.

Their targets were carefully selected

and each was sent a letter containing a small red mask.

They obtained their name from this practice.

The aforementioned informant recalled that the

leader in the lower Hill District at the turn of the

century

was DOMINICK DE FARNANDO, who was also known as "Don"

De Farnando. Following the bombing of his father's business

establishment, the police picked up this individual and

→ 5 .

## Page 13

PG 92-599

several of his associates but had to release them for lack

of evidence.

DE FARNANDO came to the father of the informant

and apologized to him and also told him that he was not

responsible for the bombing.

The following night, to the best

recollection of the informant, two Italian racketeers from

the Sharpsburg, Pa., area, were found at the bottom of

a steep

ravine in Aspinwall., They had been knifed repeatedly.

In relation to the VOLPE family of Wilmerding, Pa.,

the informant advised that he has known them for more than

50 years, and delivered groceries to their home as a boy.

he described them as "class Italians" in their day and

" was the

the late 1920's and early 1930's in order to supervise the

lucrative booze business.. He recalled that every day without

fail, JOHNNY went to a barber shop

a few doors away from the

Roma Coffee Shop on Wylie Avenue, for a facial and manicure.

It was at this coffee shop that the triple killing of the

VOLPE brothers began. ARTHUR was hit first and JAMES was

killed at the counter. After being wounded, JOHNNY endeavored

to reach his Cadillac parked in front of the store, but fell

on the sidewalk and was shot again.

Accused of fingering the

"hit" was GAETANO BAZZANO and MIKE

SPINELLI was the actual

hit man. Both were subsequently killed by mob action outside

of Pittsburgh.

bo

General Observations Relating to the Initiation

Ceremony

PG T-6 has advised that the code of the organization

in Pittsburgh, at the time of his initiation, was approximately

as follows:

"Honor is stressed as the most sacred thing

in the world.

To destroy another person must

be for honor

and not money alone.

A member is

warned never to engage in an affair with the

wives of other members.

A member

must never

engage in white slavery or narcotics, both

crimes which are degrading to the name of the

A member must obey the complaints

and instructions of his superior and is never

to take the life of a fellow member before

presenting his grievance to the Commission.

nember must do nothing which would affect

organization without first receiving permission

from a superior."

II. ORGANIZATIONAL LEADERSHIP

a. Actual Leaders in the Pittsburgh Division

Those individuals who have been identified as occupy-

ing positions of leadership within the La Cosa Nostra group

in the Pittsburgh Division are as follows:

SEBASTIAN JOHN LA ROCCA, designated by

reliable sources as "Capo" of the Western

Pennsylvania - West Virginia area and head

of Pittsburgh's LA ROCCA-GENOVESE Organization.

MIKE GENOVESE, designated by reliable sources

as the "heir-apparent" to the position

presently held by LA ROCCA. He is most

usually referred to as LA ROCCA's "top

Lieutenant®

and will definitely figure in the

power struggle for the top spot when LA ROCCA

retires, despite the fact that sources indicate

that LA ROCCA has handpicked him as his

successor.

He has never been identified as an

organization member by an actual member source.

GABRIEL "KELLY" MANNARINO, designated by

reliable sources as the individual in charge of

the northern portion of Western Pennsylvania,

but still below LA ROCCA in

stature and

directly responsible to him.

FRANK AMATO, similarly designated as the

"Underboss of the Pittsburgh Burgata," and

power for many years in the Braddock, Pa. o

vicinity.

LOUIS VOLPE, designated by reliable sources

as the individual who dominates racket activity

in the Turtle Creek Valley area from his

Wilmerding, Pas location.

ANTONIO RIPEPI, designated by reliable sources

as a close associate of LA ROCCA

and the member

of La Cosa Nostra who is responsible for the

southern county of

Western Pennsylvania.

## Page 15

PG 92=599

b. Evaluation Obtained from Other Sources

Although the aforementioned individuals are the

actual leaders in the Pittsburgh area as determined by com

prehensive investigation, recent information from informants,

who are closely associated with known and suspected organiza

tion members, is of some value in gaining insight into the

structure and procedures of the organization itself.

PG T-8 has advised that he was born in Italy and

has had overtures made to him to become a member of La Cosa

Nostra in the Pittsburgh area. He stated that he feels that

there' is only one "family" in this vicinity and that it is

thoroughly controlled by SEBASTIAN JOHN LA ROCCA.

He names

LA ROCCA, GENOVESE, MANNARINO, LOUIS VOLPE and RIPEPI as

members of La Cosa

Nostra.

PG T-9 has advised that SEBASTIAN JOHN LA ROCCA is

still very much in command of the Western Pennsylvania racket

situation and has made this extremely clear in his most

recent "swing around the circuit."

This swing was his first

since returning from his Bel Aire, Fla.•

winter residence.

If LA ROCCA has any idea of retiring, and rumors are still

rampant that he has had this in mind

for the past two years,

he certainly does not indicate his intentions by his behavior.

It is quite evident to those who associate with him that he

cannot retire without a specific directive from someone to

whom he is responsible and that this directive has been

delayed for some reason.

Those in the rackets,

according to this informant,

believe that the role of LA ROCCA as a peacemaker has

extended his tenure and responsibility and that "organization"

administrators are loathe to remove him for fear of open

conflict relating to the choice of a successor.

This "blood

bath" is not beyond the realm of possibility in this regard.

The two leading candidates for the position at this time

appear to be MIKE GENOVESE and GABRIEL MANNARINO, with

GENOVESE holding the inside track as the personal pick of

LA ROCCA, who has groomed him for many years.

1967. Friends were received at

the Manzella-Giunta

Funeral Home,

1509 Fifth Avenue, Arnold,

Pa., and burial was

on June 8, 1967, at Greenwood Memorial

Park in Lower Burrell, Pa.

On the date of burial, numerous individuals, including

known members of La Cosa Nostra and suspected members of the

organization, were observed paying their last respects by

Pittsburgh informants.

The death of MANNARINO attracted a

great deal of local publicity and hundreds of curiosity

seekers were also observed at the funeral rites.

PG T-10 advised that the last will and testament

of SAMUEL MANNARINO had been filed at the Westmoreland County

Court House in Greensburg, Pa., änd that SAM had apparently

left everything to his wife, ROSE. He said that in the

event that anything happened to ROSE, SAM's daughter and

grandchild, MINNIE CARLUCCI and JAMEY ROSE CARLUCCI, would

inherit the estate belonging to MANNARINO.

This informant

indicated that SAM had also designated ROSE as the sole

executrix and that in the event something happened to ROSE

within one month of

the death of SAM, SEBASTIAN JOHN LA ROCCA

was to be the executor and guardian of the estate of the

grandchild until this grandchild reached the age of 21.

The sponsor or godfather would take a knife or pin

in the Pittsburgh ceremony and draw blood from the candidate

by pricking one of his fingers. The blood was smeared on a

holy card which was then set aflame and placed in the cupped

hand of the candidate.

While the card burned, the sponsor

would affirm that the candidate would uphold the code of the

organization and that if he should fall in this regard, his

body

would be

destroved as symbolized by the burning of the

card. Following this ceremony, all members always embraced

the new member and kissed him on both cheeks.

PG ToY was shown the description of the initiation

ceremony for la Cosa Nostra änd expressed some opinions

about it He indicated that the stress upon the word "honor"

is quite accurate and certainly reveals a great deal about

"our group."

For example, he pointed out the prohibition

against the killing of one member by another for financial

motives alone should also show a similar prohibition of such

act meredy to attain power He said that while one

member may kill another immediately upon having his honor

affronted or in self-defense, he is not allowed to do so at a

later time

when he should have called off, without having

first secured permission from his superiors.

This informant advised that another thing which

should be added

to the induction ceremony is the prohibition

of any device, especially a bomb, which could cause injury

or death to anyone except the member to be "hit."

said that

any grievance serious enough to warrant the killing

of one member by another is a personal thing, but that this

can never

justify the injury of death of children, wives or

bystanders. He pointed out that this slovenly method of

hitting someone is probably best illustrated by the incidents

which have occurred in the Youngstown,

years o

He said that the use of bombs

for a

Ohio, nit" at.

area in recent

Youngstown, during which other innocent people

were killed,

so infuriated "us" that it has been necessary "to get rid

of a lot of young guys."

He said that not only are members

prohibited from engaging in narcotics traffic and in white

slavery, but they are prohibited from participation in any

phase of counterfeiting He could not say that the holding

of a burning holy card is never used in an induction ceremony

but that he personally "never got no burns on my hands that

way."

He did, however, have his finger pricked.

c. Other Matters Pertaining to Membership

When

PG T=14 was

asked how large the membership of

La Cosa Nostra is in the Pittsburgh area, he replied by asking

the interviewing agent to

suggest

an estimate.

The figure 50

was mentioned, at which time the informant asked, "Does that

include Philadelphia?" He was told that the figure guessed

represented only Western Pennsylvania, and the informant said

that the figure should have been more like 30 and that only

six of these are at all active... No amount of persuasion could

get him to identify the six active members.

This informant advised that JOHNNY BAZZANO, the son

Of GIOVANNI BAZZANO, is married to one of the daughters of:

ANTONIO RIPEPI. When asked whether JOHNNY would be a member

When he was asked

whether JAMES PAUL SALAMONE of Erie, Pa., was a member of the

Pittsburgh Burgata, this informant said

that he did not know

him. He then indicated that he knew this individual as JIMMY

WESTFIELD and stated emphatically that SALAMONE "does not

belong to our Pittsburgh group."

PG 92 - 599

When the aforementioned informant was asked who

it was who sponsored the MANNARINO brothers for membership

in La Cosa Nostra, he simply shrugged.

When it was suggested

to him that the sponsor might have been SEBASTIAN JOHN LA ROCCA,

he grinned and said, "Who else?"

During the latter portion of February, 1967, PG I-17

furnished the following information:

In Western Pennsylvania, there are a lot of characters

who falsely profess to be members of La Cosa Nostra or the

Mafia or to be closely associated with members.

These people,

generally speaking, are small-time racketeers or in some sort

of criminal fringe

business, such as vending machine routes.

For some reason, these people believe that the circulation

will cause local political and law enforcement officers to

give them more respect and a wider latitude in operating

An example of this is a man named JOHN COSTELLO,

who is now deceased but who formerly resided in Homer City,

This guy was about 5'g" tall, 220 pounds, heavy build,

dark complexion, blind in one eye and had a wooden leg

He used to do some bootlegging of moonshine whiskey down

around Monessen, Pa., in the middle 1920's and early 1930's.

In the 1940's, he controlled most of the slot machines and

illegal pinballs in Indiana County. It is believed he

operated a saloon or two in the Homer City • Indiana

area

in the late 1940's or early 1950's.

In any event, COSTELLO used to tell associates

that he was a member of the "Mafia" and that he had meetings

with JOHN LA ROCCA, DOM ANZALONE, SAM MANNARINO and others,

when actually these men hardly knew who COSTELLO was.

SAM MANNARINO heard that COSTELLO was boasting about being

a close associate of his friends, MANNARINO suggested that

'COSTELLO be "hit," but LA ROCCA said COSTELLO wasn't worth

the risk and was not a threat to anyone in any manner.. LA ROCCA

said that if COSTELLO was "hit" it might make some people

believe he actually had been a member of La Cosa Nostra..

However,

LA ROCCA did say they would dispose of COSTELLO if

he ever infringed on the activities of any of their people,

such as to try to place any of his machines in an area

controlled by one of their men.

- 43-

Docld:32305266 Page 20

## Page 21

PG 92-599

COSTELLO became ill in the early 1950's and sub

sequently died, so it was never necessary to deal with him.

When asked when and where the last ceremony admitting

new members of La Cosa Nostra took place,

he merely said,

long time ago - too long; maybe."

He would not elaborate on

this.

He was asked directly if SONNY CIANCUTTI and JOHN

FONTANA were La Cosa Nostra members, and he responded by

saying, "They might as well be They have to live the same

and obey all the rules."

When he was pressed to answer the

question, he replied, with a smile, "Not yet."

PG T-11 advised that in about 1959, just before

DOMINICK ANZALONE, a known member of La Cosa Nostra and a close

associate of SEBASTIAN JOHN LA ROCCA, moved to California,

he operated a casino

at ligonier, Pa.

LA ROCCA, described

by the informant as "the Capo of

the Pittsburgh

instructed ANZALONe chat he must take in certain additional

partners in this casino and it was a short time later that

the new partners took over the entire operation but promised

ANZALONE a share of the profits. ANZALONE moved to San Jose,

Callto, 1n d960.

and received approximately three cash pay-

ments of about $10,000 each as his share from the casino

profits.

The payments were cut off without notice shortly

thereafter. More than one year passed in which no payments

were made to ANZALONE and he decided to send one CHARLES

CARBONE to Pittsburgh to act as a personal representative in

an effort to secure his interest in the club.

Contact by

CARBONE with LA ROCCA brought no results.

Five years have

now gone by and ANZALONE continues to feel that he should

share in the profits of the casino. He recently discussed

this matter with SAL TARANTO tó ascertain whether TARANTO

would consider traveling to Pittsburgh to act in his behalf.

TARANTO declined because of poor health, but suggested that

consideration be given to sending TONY LIMA as the personal

representative of ANZALONE inasmüch as LIMA has been closely

associated with LA ROCCA in the past.

TARANTO pointed out that LIMA is reliable and

could handle most situations and that ANZALONE actually owed

him this opportunity for past favors and the loyalty LIMA

has shown to ANZALONE. ANZALONE stated that he would con-

sider sending LIMA and GEORGE ADRAGNA together to contact LA

ROCCA. The informant pointed out that the loss of the

interest of ANZALONE in the Ligonier operation and his loss

-14-

NW 68486

Docld:32305266 Page 21

---

## Page 22

PG 92-599

of approximately $60,000 to FRANK SORCE in the Peter Piper

Motors, San Jose, business venture, has been embarrassing to

him and he senses that he has lost the respect of the san

Jose Family.

The informant indicated that ANZALONE continues

to lose the respect of his fellow members because he con

tinually complains about his loss of money while making no

effort to recover what is rightfully his.

The fact that he

is extremely wealthy and still worries about his money has

brought only disgust from fellow members who no longer have

sympathy fos him.

On May 5, 1967, the aforementioned informant

advised that he had visited with ANZALONE earlier that week

and that ANZALONE appeared to be in poor spirits as a result

of his concern relating to a deportation hearing.

His attorney

had instructed him to discontinue association with anyone of

questionable reputation until the conclusion of his hearing

and ANZALONE continued to moan that "JOHN LA ROCCA is making

money by the bushel basket. "

In discussing further information concerning

ANZALONE, this informant advised that when ANZALONE moved

from Pennsylvania to California, he was placed on the payroll

of the California Cheese Company in San Jose, for the purpose

of making it appear to the Immigration and Naturalization

Service that he was legitimately employed. This company is

owned and operated by SAi, MARINO, former Capo de Decina of

San Jose.

Personal differences soon developed between the

two and the relationship was severed.

MARINO, however, had

cleverly filtered word back to LA ROCCA in Pittsburgh that

LA ROCCA. This caused LA ROCCA to become disenchanted with

ANZALONE, who countered through his sources and was ultimately

successful in convincing LA ROCCA that the accusations made

by MARINO were untrue.

As a result, MARINO was replaced as

Capo de Decina by his son, ANGELO.

This has been considered

as a "slap in the face." The LA ROCCA-ANZALONE friendship

will never be the same and since this incident, ANZALONE has

been most circumspect in his contact with the MARINOs.

The informant pointed out that ANZALONE originally

came to the United States on a specific assignemnt ordered

by the Mafia in Sicily. He was to kill JOHN BONDI, who had

fled from Sicily to Pittsburgh, Pa., after killing three

members of the

Mafia in Sicily. BONDI, who is now deceased,

was a cousin of TONY LIMAl

Because ANZALONE was a close

NW 68486

## Page 23

PG 92-599

friend of the father of TONY LIMA, LIMA stepped in to act

as peacemaker and BONDI and ANZALONE became friends. ANZALONE

later became a member of the STEVE MONASTERA Family in

Pittsburgh.

While living in Pittsburgh, prior to the takeover

by JOHN LA ROCCA, ANZALONE learned through the grapevine

that his wife, a

resident of Sicily, was having a love affair.

It was mandatory at that time that á La Cosa Nostra member

avenge this disgrace and ANZALONE returned to Sicily to kill

both his wife and her lover' Instead of doing this, he forgave

his wife, separated from her and returned to Pittsburgh.

He had dishonored himself and was dropped from the MONASTERA

Family.

He was reinstated by PEPINO SIRACUSA following the

death of MONASTERA and he again became active in La Cosa

Nostra activities.

On August 8, 1965g FRANK AMATO was interviewed at

his home at 430 Second Street, Braddock, Pa.

AMATO said that he was born in Naples,

Italy, and

spent the first 17 years of his life there.

During his early

youth,

he was employed as a barber from the time he was

approximately 14 years of age,

He came to this country

alone in late 1910, and spent

six or seven months in New York

City working as a barber....

In 1911, an uncle from Braddock,

Pa.?

• sent him a train ticket and money to come to Pittsburgh,

and he moved to Braddock and has lived there since that time.

AMATO said that he was employed as a barber in

Braddock at first and that eventually he bought a bar known

as "The Brandywine." He said that his employees were all

Italians, and one of them was one of the ANDOLINA brothers:

He said that he finally quit the saloon business because his

employees were robbing him.

AMATO said that he has very little income now,

relying on his social security and meager receipts from

pinball machines.

During 1965, he earned about $6

these sources

not service the machines himself on

but has contracted them to AL MC CULLOUGH, a Wilkinsburg

distributor who handles all the pinball maintenance and pays

FRANK a

percentage of the profit.

This percentage, plus

his social security, makes up his income.

AMATO said that

the Adrilee Motel is not his, but his son's.

He said he helps

his son but does not take any money in income from the

operation of the motel. He said he had nothing to do with

NW 68486

## Page 24

PG 92 =599

numbers. Everyone calls him a höodlum and a gangster because

of his association with numerous other Italians in the

Pittsburgh area. AMATO said that he knows VITO BONACCI very

well, having spent 55 years in Braddock with VITO, because

BONACCI's family was from the town where AMATO was born and

raised.

He pointed out that it was natural for Italians

to associate

with other Italians in this country when they

had a common background and a common language.

He said that

JOSEPH NUGARA had married one Of his daughters and he was:

quite friendly with NUGARA also. He said that he was well.

acquainted with "ARCHIE" NELSON and was a close personal friend

of SEBASTIAN JOHN LA ROCCA. He said that he met VITO GENOVESE

at a wedding approximately ten years ago, but he was not a close

He said he did not know JOSEPH BARBARA and

was not at "the gathering" at Apalachin, New York, in 1957.

HiS son-In-law, KELLY MANNARINO, was there. AMATO said that

he had heard of La Cosa Nostra while reading a story written

by JOSEPH VALACHI, but he felt that this was the result of

over-active imagination on the part of the writer.

said that he did not know anything about the organization, nor

was

he a member.

and he the hot bo

He

He said he was not a member of the Mafia,

nor had he ever

been a member.

AMATO said that he had never been in trouble in

his life,

although he had beën arrested on a murder charge

in 1927.

He said that he was not anywhere near the area

of the murder and had

a witness to prove it.

The

charges

against him were dropped.

Concerning a shooting in his

home about five or six years ago, AMATO said that two

individuals came to his home in the evening, and his pregnant

daughter answered the door.

These individuals shoved thein:

way into the house at gunpoint, and ransacked his home

looking for a box which AMATO said did not exist.

The box

was ostensibly filled with cash.. AMATO said that he was

able, after a tense and trying period in his home, to pull

gun from his waistband la gun he said he always carried with

him and was able to shoot one of the thieves in the leg.

He said he ran upstairs to try to get the other thief, but

this individual jumped from an upstairs window and escaped.

When he returned downstairs, the individual who he had shot

appeared to be coming after him again, and he shot him in the

head.

He pointed out that he did this to protect his wife

and pregnant daughter from physical harm at the hands of the

intruders.

AMATO said that after shooting this individual in

the head, he called the police He indicated that he had no

other arrests, and had spent his life helping people.

AMATO advised that he has five daughters and one son.

One of his daughters is married to JOSEPH NUGARA and another

to MICHAEL SCHERBANIC, Allegheny County Deputy Sheriff.

He

said that SCHERBANIC and his daughter reside

on the top floor

of the AMATO home. He concluded the interview by stating

that he was happy to have been contacted and would welcome a

recontact at any time in the future.

PG T-8 has

advised that he has some reservations

about the CANCELLIERI brothers, JOHN and SAM, who are grand-

sons of old JOHN CANCELLIERI, whom the informant feels was

definitely a member of the old Mafia.

He also named JOHN

FONIANA, formerly of New Kensington, Pay as a possible member

of the organization.

wIth relation to FRANK VALENTI

Intormant advised that he has known this individual for more

than 30 years and that he is positive that VALENTI is a member

of La Cosa Nostra, He indicated that VALENTI might possibly

have been initiated in about 1947 or 1948, and that he was

sponsored either by JOHN CANCELLIERI Or SEBASTIAN JOHN LA ROCCA.

IV. CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES

ao Information Relating to the Influence of the ?

Organization in the Pittsburgh Numbers Racket

PG T-18 has advised that the Italian syndicate in

Pittsburgh had taken over a good portion of the numbers opera-

tion controlled by TONY GROSSO and that the only remaininis

independent book in Pittsburgh was on the North Side.

informant hastened to say, however, that he had heard from

a very reliable source that the syndicate in Pittsburgh does

not have the capital to handle the GROSSO operation and that

SEBASTIAN JOHN LA ROCCA has made the statement that he is

not interested in taking over the numbers action because

there is too much concentration on it by Federal officials and

some law enforcement agencies. He has always felt that such

an operation would be nothing but a headache to La Cosa Nostra.

PG T-19 has advised that he refuses to believe

¡ that La Cosa Nostra will ever take over the city of Pittsburgh

numbers racket and no one he has talked to in the rackets has

any fear of this happening at the present time. They reason,

according to the informant, that

the organization will not

pay, and that means no repeat business. He said that La Cosa

Nostra representatives in the numbers racket may pick up a

lot of "nickel and dime business

that the big independents

will not care about losing, but that no big bettors will go

to them because of their habit of "walking" hits they feel

they cannot cover.

The aforementioned informant indicated that the

numbers racket seems to be at its lowest ebb in years in the

Pittsburgh area and that there is more distrust among its

operators than ever before. He said that police shakedowns

lave not diminished one bit and, in fact have picked u

ince the acquittal of former Assistant Superintendent LAWRENCI

Jo MALONEY.

He stated that there is no one officer getting

as big a cut as MALONEY got but that more men down through the

ranks

are taking what they can get.

PG T-20 was asked about the East Liberty numbers

book, fronted by JAKE LERNER and PHIL GENOVESE, Older brother

of MIKE.

He indicated that it is positively syndicate-controlled

and handled by MIKE GENOVESE, acting under the orders of

SEBASTIAN JOHN LA ROCCA.

He stated that there is no other

book in Pittsburgh that is syndicated in that no one dictates

the operation of any other book except the man operating the

book.

He indicated that La Cosa Nostra has control only to

the degree that members such as LA ROCCA, SICA and the VOLPES

may be asked to lend a large amount of money, for instance

$25,000 or more.

Their asking price is never pressure or

control but merely a fat interest and prompt payments.

On August 2, 1966, Corporal JOHN REDIGAN of the

Pennsylvania State Police at Greensburg, Pa., advised that

investigation by his squad had determined that "PATSY"

STANIZZO and FELIX GENOVESE, the older brother of MIKE, had

recently started to meet various runners to receive their

daily numbers packs for subsequent delivery to the headquarters

counting office of the JAKE LERNER numbers combine..

LERNER

is the front for the LA ROCCA-GENOVESE Organization in this

particular phase of the numbers operation.

He indicated that

both individuals

were extremely "tail conscious" and that

his squad was having a great deal of difficulty in finding

the meeting place, which would change every day. He requested

assistance in determining in advance where the meeting place

would be.

On August 2, 1966, PG T-9 was contacted in relation

to this problem and he advised that each day between 2:20 PM

and 2:30 PM, the numbers runner from Wilmerding, Pa.s

receives a telephone call from an individual who tells him

where he should deliver his packs to the JAKE LERNER head-

quarters representatives

He said that it is the custom of

this individual to take these packs, which are picked up from

various writers in the Turtle Creek

Valley area of Allegheny

County, and deliver them to the bERNER representatives between

3:25 PM and 3:35 PM.

Although the area changes constantly:

the pass had occurred for several days prior to this time in

the Pittsburgh - Wilkinsburg border area.

He named five

individuals to whom the turnovers would probably be made

and

furnished a complete description of each of these individuals.

He said that he could probably obtain information as to the

turnover site on August 3, 1966°

On August 3, 1966, the aforementioned informant

advised that he had learned of the specific area of the turn

over and named it as the intersection of Pitt and Franklin

Streets in Wilkinsburg.

The Pennsylvania State Police was

immediately apprised of this information and at approximately

3:31 PM,

STANIZZO and FELIX GENOVESE were observed sitting

in a 1963 black Cadillac convertible at the aforementioned

intersection.

Their car bore a dealer's license plate and

at 3:38 PM, a 1960 white Dodge sedan, bearing one unknown

male, pulled alongside the Cadillac and handed its occupants

a brown paper bag.

The Pennsylvania State Police surveillance

was "made" immediately and the GENOVESE car sped away,

running a stop sign and turning into a one-way street.

Approximately half way down the street, STANIZZO threw the bag

from the car window and the car was brought to a stop by

pursuing State Police cars. GENOVESE and STANIZZO

appeared

PG I-21 has been questioned specifically about the

background of the development of the utilization of JAKE

LERNER as a front for the La Cosa Nostra numbers operation

in the Pittsburgh, Paid area.

He stated that during the early portion of 1965,

the family of LERNER became interested in returning JAKE to:

Pittsburgh from Arizona, where he had become a heavy drinker.

He indicated that inasmuch as TONY GROSSO,

the leading man

in the Pittsburgh numbers picture, was facing a prison sen

tence, LERNER felt that he could return to Pittsburgh and

operate a large bookmaking operation that would eventually

move in when GROSSO was incarcerated:

## Page 28

PG: 92-599

The following additional

information was contributed

by the informant in this regard:

LERNER was contacted by one of the members of the

CANCELLIERI family from the North Side of Pittsburgh shortly

after his return from Arizona and LERNER was requested to

meet with FELIX GENOVESE, older brother of MIKE, and JOHN

FONTANA, LERNER was asked to come alone to the

Phoenix Motel

at Monroeville, Pa,, at which place the two aforementioned

individuals requested him to handle the bookmaking operation

for the LA ROCCA-GENOVESE Organization He was promised

certain territories that were already in the possession of

the organization, and LERNER advised them during the meeting

that he was not interested in the proposition

In thinking

it over, however, LERNER realized that he could again be a

big man

and that

because the syndicate had asked him to do

them a favor, he could once again be in the driver's seat.

He visualized hinself as the

successor to TONY GROSSO.

Numerous meetings among FELIX GENOVESE, JOHN FONTANA

and JAKE LERNER took place and LERNER eventually met with

MIKE GENOVESE. At the conclasion of this meeting, LERNER was

put in charge of the organization's numbers operation.

GENOVESE turned over to LERNER the bookmaking operations in

the East Liberty, Homewood, Squirrel Hill, North Side and

South Side areas

of Pittsburgh, specified

areas within the

Pittsburgh city limits, including the Hill District and the

Market area, and the New Kensington, Pa., area. FONTANA was

to handle the East Liberty and New Kensington area, and

GENOVESE was to handle the Squirrel Hill and Homewood areas.

Other organization individuals would be placed in charge of

the additional territories.

The total play was always

turned over to one of the organization representatives at

a designated location and the package was then taken to a

"bank."

This bank, of course, had its location changed daily,

and all individuals

were constantly aware of surveillances.

ccasionally, rooms in downtown Pittsburgh hotels were

utilized for

"bank" purposeso

According to the aforementioned informant, the

syndicate realizes the ability of LERNER as it did with

CHUCK TEEMER.

TEEMER, he pointed out, could operate a

gambling operation with perfection and was chosen by the

syndicate to operate their gambling establishments LERNER

was-chosen. for the same reason

Investigations Being Conducted by Other Federal

Agencies which Relate to La Cosa Nostra

On February 21, 1967, a United Press

release datelined Washington, DiGo, appeared in the fitteburgh

Press," captioned, "Flying Squads Shadowing Crime Lords."

indicated that a nationwide attack has begun on at least

15 of the 24 big Cosa Nostra "families" that reportedly run

organized crime in the United States and that the vehicle.

for the assault that will touch cities from Massachusetts to

Florida to California, is a flying squad of investigative

experts from five Federal agencies.

The release stated that

the squad is directed by the Justice Department's Organized

Crime Section headed by HENRY E. PETERSON and includes members

from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue

Service, the Bureau of Narcotics and the Labor Department.

PETERSON according to the release, said that much

of the effort will be aimed at irregularities that could

lead to action against the legitimate businesses being used

as tronts by the syndicate.

He/listed the men

and the areas

as major targets in the drive, and one of these is "JOHN

LA ROCCA of Pittsburgh." The Pittsburgh paper contained an

additional writeup on LA ROCCAS

A great many television and newspapermen converged

on the Ingomar, Pa,, residence of LA ROCCA on February 22,

1967•

as the result of extensive publicity given to LA ROCCA

in the newspaper of that date... No family members were at

home, inasmuch as LA ROCCA and his wife had left the area

for their Florida winter residence during the second week in

January, as anticipated Newsmen indicated that they would

concentrate on photographs of the North Star Cement Block

Company, owned by LA ROCCA.

On

May 2'5 1967, a meeting was held in the Grand

Jury Room of the United States Post Office and Court House

Building at Pittsburgh, Pa. Attendees represented the

Alcohol and Tobacco Tax Division, the Internal Revenue Service,

the United States Secret Service and the United States

Attorney's Office, in addition to the Federal Bureau of

Investigation. The meeting was presided over by ALFRED No

New York Citys.

and that he came to Altoona when he was a very

small boy and

attended the Altoona school system. He said

that the father of IACOVETTI, ALBERT, and his mother continue

to neside in Altoona but that he does not know the mother's

maiden name.

The aforementioned informant advised that IACOVETTI

not returned to Altoona except for occasional visits since

that time, but did marry a second or third cousin of Altoona

Her maiden name was ALTIERO;

The aforementioned informant has stated that he is

absolutely certain that DAVID ROBERT IACOVETTI is a member

of La Cosa Nostra and has heard rumors to the effect that:

he is becoming quite a big man in the organization.

stated that he has also heard that IACOVETTI is a close

associate of FRANK SINATRA." He has heard no additional infor-

The Internal Revenue

Service at Altoona, Pa., is also conducting an investigation

of TRAFICANTE and has

learned that he is a partner of JOSEPH

DECRISCIO, in the operation of the Juniata Furnace Company

at Altoona.

It has also been learned that he has an interest

in the Palidore Arcade and in a fruit market, both located in

Altoona. TRAFICANTE has purchased a substantial number of low-

class homes at Altoona, many of which are currently unoccupied

and he owns many of the properties in which his relatives

reside, even though court records disclose that the relative

is the actual owner of the property. Internal Revenue Service

has also determined that most transactions on the

IRAFICANTE are on a cash baste and this has made it extremely

difficult to develop substantial evidence against him.

Information Relating to the Influence of the

Organization at Chester, W. Va & Gambling

Establishments

PG T-23 has discussed what he knows about the

Chester, W. Va, operations in which La Cosa Nostra is

interested.

He said that CHUCK TEEMER has become elderly

and wanted

for a long time to remove himself from the racket

picture, but that la Cosa Nostra would not let him out.

informant indicated that representatives of La Cosa Nostra

from Pittsburgh purchased the Red Dog at Chester, W. Va, •

and asked TEEMER to operate it, after they had failed to make

a go of it. He said that TEEMER's personality and contacts

enabled him to lure many more people to the Red Dog and he

was promised 12% of the take.. The informant indicated that

although JOSEPH PECORA was supposed to be the owner of the

Red Dog; the real owner is SEBASTIAN JOHN LA ROCCA, who

takes the greatest share of the gross. He said that LA ROCCA

pays very minor amounts to the VOLPE brothers and to ANTONIO

RIPEPI.

PG T-24 advised that JOSEPH PECORA has told him

that he has a small interest in the gambling activities

presently being conducted at the Half Moon Night Club, located

on Route 30, Chester, W. Vao, and that this casino has craps

tables which are being operated by the same individuals who

were employed by PECORA at the Paddock Club. He remarked

= 24 =

NW 68486

Docld:32305266 Page 31

## Page 32

PG 92-599

that he would like to re-open the Red Dog Restaurant as az

gambling casino but has had trouble with the local Sheriff

and State Police.

He blamed the trouble on the pressure of

the Federal Bureau of Investigation

PG T-25 has advised that JOSEPH PECORA has bought

out CHARLES TEEMER's interest in the Red Dog Restaurant and

that TEEMER also sold to PECORA property owned by him in

Hancock County. He advised that La Cosa Nostra now controls

the gambling operations at the Half Moon, the Rio, the Lantern

Inn and the Cactus Bar. He advised that PECORA plans to again

open the gambling casino at the Red Dog Restaurant,

On June 14, 1966 the Red Dog Restaurant opened

again as a gambling casino and began operation exactly as the

operation was run in the former Jockey Club and Paddock Club.

The same employees are again working at the new Red Dog and

the PECORA brothers are employed in an administrative capacity.

The clientele at the new gambling casino is identical to that

which patronized the Jockey Club and the Paddock Club. Food

and beverages are free in the gambling area.

No checks are

accepted for gambling debts and the casino is extremely

plush, indicating that La Cosa Nostra expects to receive a

sizable financial return on its Investment.

On August 8, 19660

"The weirton Daily Times" at

Weirton, W. Va., reported that the Lantern Inn, located on

Route 66, Chester, W. Va, was raided by the West Virginia

State Police. Gambling equipment and liquor were confiscated.

On August 19, 1966, the aforementioned newspaper

reported that Hancock County Deputies had raided the Cactus

Bar, located on Route 30, Chester, W. Va. No gambling equip-

ment was confiscated,

but arrests were made on liquor

violations.

News articles did not state that JOSEPH PECORA

has a part interest in both establishments, but informants

have verified that La Cosa Nostra, fronted

effectively in the

Chester, W. Va., area by PECORA, has an interest in both

operations.

Bureau Agent's of the Pittsburgh Division were

successful in gaining entry to the Red Dog casino at Chester,

W. Vas on September 16 - 1 19660

They participated

actively in the gambling and were successful in identifying

both operators and patrons.. On September 26; 1966, however,

District Attorney FLOYD TARR advised that it would

a raid at the Red Dog casino and that he would not consider

raiding this establishment until after the November elections.

He promised to take action based on affidavits filed by the

Agents.

On December 3, 1966. Agents of the Pittsburgh Division

again gained entry to the Red Dog garbling establishment at

Chester, W. Va s

and obtained pertinent evidence.

On

December: 5, 1966 a meeting was ned with Prosecuting Attorney

FLOYD TARR

and Lieutenant wor BowlEy or the west vinginia

State Police in attendance. Necessary papers were filed by

the Agents and it was decided that the West Virginia State

Police would raid the establishment based on information fur-

nished by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, on the evening

of December 9, 1966• Warrants were filed charging JosePh

PECORA with violation of liquor and gambling statutes of

the west Virginia State Law. On December 8, 1966, it was

determined that all of the gambling equipment had

been removed

from the casino on the evening of December 1, 1966, because

PECORA had learned of the coming raid.

The raid was cancelled

and the Red Dog is again in operation.

During the latter portion of July, 1967, PG T-26

advised that JOSEPH PECORA and his brothers,

_VINCENT, RICHARD

and CHARLES, JR., incaddition to BENNY PHILLIPS chad gained

almost complete

control of all gambling establishments on

the "strips

"" which is UseS Route 30, in northern Hancock

County. Ple stated that they were able to obtain this complete

monopoly for La Cosa Nostra through an alleged association

with Hancock County Sheriff JOSEPH RODAK, who has been able

to force the small

independent operators out of business with

constant liquor raids.

2326

7366

The aforementioned informant advised that the clubs

operating without interference include the Red Dog, Cactus,

Rio and Lantern Inn.

He indicated that if the take at the

Red Dog on a weekend is not more than $100,000, it would

mean the establishment was having a bad week.or The casino

type gambling at this establishment includes craps, blackjack

and barbout.

It is the impression of the informant that the

Sheriff of Hancock County is on friendly terms with the Governor

of West Virginia and raids are never made on any of the PECORA

locations, unless they are pre-planned for publicity purposes.

e. Other Matters Relating to Criminal Activities

PG T-27 has advised that during October, 1966, he

was in the company of MIKE DE MARCO, Pittsburgh racket figure,

and the closest known Pittsburgh associate of La Cosa Nostra

member FRANK VALENTI, of Rochester, N. Y. The informant was

introduced to one TONY VOLPE, who allegedly owned a farm!

near Duncansville, Pa.

VOLPE stated that "JOE BANANAS" had

stayed there while being sought by New York authorities

He said the farm is used by many other La Cosa Nostra top

figures to hide or "cool off."

VOLPE was described by the

informant as being from New York State and driving a 1966

Cadillac Coupe de Ville, which bore a New York license that

started with the numbers 96

The informant stated that VOLPE was a white male,

approximately 60 years of ages 5'10" in height, of medium

husky build, with black, graying hair and a gray mustache.

The New York, Albany and Buffalo Divisions have

been unable to determine the identity of this individual.

No further information has been received which relates to

the alleged farm near Duncansville, Pa.

When news media publicized the disinterrment

in New Jersey by the Federal Bureau of Investigation of the

bodies of two vatims of alleged La Cosa Nostra slayings,

PG I-6 was asked if the news came as a surprise to him.

He replied that although he was not aware of this particular

burial spot,

"We have places like that all over the country."

He indicated that he had once met the informant in this matter

and that "One of their biggest mistakes is telling too much

to the Jewish guys we have to work with."

On December 15, 1966 the "Pittsburgh Press" carried

an article entitied,

"Ripepi" Linked to Shooting in Baltimore."

The article indicated that ANTONIO RIPEPI, age 63, of the

Whitehall section of Pittsburgh, was wanted by Baltimore

authorities on a charge of intent to murder.

He was arrested

by the Whitehall Police Chief at his home and the paper

indicated that JAMES ASHTON (who has represented members of

La Cosa Nostra in the past) had been retained by RIPEPI as

his attorney.

The

article described RIPEPI as a Whitehall coin

machine operator with a business at Pleasant Hills, Pa.

and said that he was charged with an attack on one ANGELO

TROMBERI, who

in turn, was charged with the shooting of

FRANK E. CORBI, a night club operator, who played a prominent

role in a Grand Jury investigation of Baltimore's burlesque

strip known as "The Block:": RIPEPI denied having been in

Baltimore when the shooting occurred.

The Red Eegre

Pittsburgh, rag

as Formerly known as the Genovese Cocktai

Lounge and prior to the Aparachin meeting of hooldums, was

a known hangout for members of La Cosa Nostra, who met there

during conferences called by SEBASTIAN JOHN LA ROCCA.

2244/

On January 23, 1967, Pittsburgh informants advised

that a large dice and barbout game had been taking place

over the Red Eagle Lounge and furnished a complete picture

of the locations of various pieces of gambling apparatus.

All advised that the game had an elaborate setup to warn

operators of approaching visitors and operated with little

concern for law enforcement.

Armed with the information furnished by these

informants, the Pittsburgh Police Department conducted a raid

on the establishment and arrested 22 patrons for gambling in

a club which had been re-named the Musical Valley Association.

A similar raid was contiueted by the Allegheny

County Detective Bureau, Pittsburgh, Pas on the same

establishment, based upon information furnished by Federal

Bureau of Investigation informants.

V. CONSPIRATORIAL ASPECTS

The New York Division advised on September 23, 1966,

that at 5:00 PM, on September 22, 1966, the New York City

Police Department had conducted a surveillance which resulted

in the apprehension on consorting charges of 13 known members

of La Cosa Nostra, who were dining at La Stella Restaurant,

102 - 13 Queens Boulevard, Forest Hills, N. Y. All offices

were requested to contact logical informants for any informa-

tion they could develop in relation to this meeting. At

least one informant in the Pittsburgh area advised that on the

evening of September 21, 1966, he telephonically contacted

JOSEPH PECORA at the Julian Restaurant in New York City,

and

that PECORA, a suspected member of La Cosa Nostra, was with

MIKE GENOVESE and the manager of Club 21 in New York. This

information was furnished to the New York Division to assist

in its investigation but no further details were ever obtained.

Neither GENOVESE nor PECORA ever told anyone what they were

doing in New York City and their names were not brought into

the investigation conducted by the New lork City Police

Department.

There have been no large meetings attended by

actual and suspected members of La Cosa Nostra of the

Pittsburgh Burgata that have been brought to the attention

of the Pittsburgh Division of the Federal Bureau of Investi

gation by informants knowledgeable in this field.

failed to establish any connection of RIPEPI with vending

at race tracks in the Miami area but had learned that the

President of the Hollywood, Fla., Dog Track is an alleged

close friend of RIPEPI: and

have been many more had not GABRIEL MANNARINO contacted them

and warned them of the probability of visual and photographip

coverage of the event by law enforcement agencies. He

mentioned that no law enforcement agencies

will be able to

find out from records of the Holiday Inn at New Kensington,

Pao, who these out-of-town guests were because It-was

arranged with fauL baLLano, one of the principal owners

for these guests to register under assumed names. He said
