entirely on public source information and we are recom-

mending that it be referred to the Crime Records Division

with the idea that it can be given to a friendly newspaper

contact such as David Lawrence, who is Editor of the U.S.

News and horld Report.:

The article was prepared because the cry

of "black power" is a most timely issue in the country today.

This issue has split the civil rights movenent and

has caused

civil rights leaders to take sides for and against "black

power."

However, Wartin Luther King has

been attempting

to straddle the issue,

based on advice given him by his

advisors with communist backgrounds.

The attached article

indicts King for his frilure to take a stand on the issue

and. at the same time exposes the degree of communist influence

..

:.d

.

-.s..o.

It is felt the public should again be ..

reminded of this communist influence on King, and the

current controversy among civil rights leaders makes this

timely to do so.

The attached article has been prepared with

no letterhead relating it to the FBI and is on unvatermarked

bond paper.

Such associations and, nore particulazly, guidance

SIon such IndIviduals could vell explain King's failure to

take a strong stand in opposition to lckissick and Caraichzel.

They have been exhorting their followers not to support the

Aninistration's action 11 Vietnas, to relusa serving ti

to bring about a cosmuist victory in Vietnan and to divida

the masses along class lines to ionest disorder in tha gircess.

Such gaidance rould help to ezplala also way jing

split with nen like Wilkins, Randolph and Young on the issue

of whether civil rights leaders should ba speaking out oa

matters of foraign policy of whether their role shonld be

contined to civil rights matters. It will ba recalled that

King attempted to project his viens to criticisa or ligating.

In Vietnan but the responsible civil rights leaders took a

It wuuld appear that King's advisors have & broader

Secondly, he dislikes going to

HofIa because of Hoffa's unsavory reputation.

On the other nanc,

it would appeai bofia might be concernea with the white

backlash within his own union ranks should it become

Both agreed that there was no way at this time that the con-

tract with SCLC could be gracefully canceled without causing

severe and embarrassing repercussions. He stated, however,

Secretary are in agreement that steps will be taken to insure

that no further

contracts will be awarded to King's group.

tour throughout the United States with the purpose of parti-

cipating in benefit programs to raise funds for the SCIC.

While

on this tour, King took an excessive dosage of sleeping

pills and his conduct on the tour was "quite atrocious." Ac-

cording to the source, King not only "traveled, ate, and drank

first class but slept with his secretary and óthers."

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS:

the Ford Foundation had granted his organization a quarter

OBSERVATIONS:

It is interesting to note that King's group

will only get $250,000, a large sun, but considerably

smaller than the original amount. Perhaps our measures

had some effect in causing this reduction. In view of

King's current announcements indicating he will hold a

Attached for your approval for dissemination to

friendly news media sources is a copy of a Negro newspaper

editorial attacking Martin Iuther King, JI., President,

Southern Christian Leadership Conference.

BACKGROUND:

Or - 1:29:91

King's group is in desperate need of funds. In

an effort to combat this problem, King has organized

₴

variety show starring Harry Belafonte, well-known Negro

vocalist with a subversive background, to tour seven major

cities in the United States. The proceeds will go to the

Southern Christian Leadership Conference, King is touring?

with the group and speaks during each performance.

The attached editorial entitled

Think Iwice

Before Going to Coliseun Tuesday Night." appeared in the

"Forward lines," the leading Negro newspaper in Houston,

Texas. This paper attacks King for his stand on Vietnen Plute

and clains his appaarance in Houston is "an imposition on

the cormunity." King is also referred to as

"a nisguided

'Moses' who has lost himself." In addition, the article

claims King's position regarding the Vietnam war "borders

upon treason." Further, "a man who will not fight for his

country hasn't got any civil rights of any respect due hin."

......... ..

Several weeks ago FORWARD TIMES

made an editorial expression which

stated, among other things, that Dr. Mar-

tin Luther King had strayed oft onto an

extremely dangerous course wnich ran

fin the opposite direction from the civi

rights leadership course that vast

numbers of citizens had come to know

and respect him for over a lide span of

„years.

Now, we wish to make it crystal clear

that this newspaper, of course, respects

and upholds Dr. King's right to take &

position that is, what we think to be,

contrary to good judgement. If he wishes

to be the spokesman for the 'peaceniks',

• that's his business. When, however, Dr.

King joins with others and tries to impose

¡that poor judgement upon the entire Negro

community which is already beset withy

more in-depth and complicated probiems

than can apparently be coped with, at that!

: point we call it our business.

FORWARD TIMES takes the position

that Dr. King's visit to Houston next

Tuesday night is an imposition upon this

community of the first order. We aiso

think that the fact that he is shrouding

his "remarks" behind a big name popu-

lar singer like Aretha Franklin suggests

subterfuge. It Aretha Franklin, who is

now at the peak of fame, permits this

group of "peaceniks' to use her name to

further their efforts, all that we cay say?

is, "that's her business." It she wakes up

Mater and finds that she has acted just

Tise Tokyo Rose and Axis Sally, all that

we can say is that she broughtit all upon

herselt.

Our concern is not so much with what

course Dr. King and Miss Franklinelect

to rollow Woat concerns us is that the in-

NW 68486 Docld:32989755 Page 62

nocent public, it not properly fore

warned, might be taken in by their visit

to Houston. We think that if whai Dr. King

phas to say isn't within itselimeritorious :

enough to draw a crowd, he shouldn't be

¡coming to town in the first place to say

it. As it stands now, Aretha Franklin'sil

name has been added to the show and many

people will pay the lee expecting to hear!

her sing. She will be the 'bait to help

get the crowd inside the Coliseum. Once

inside, the trapped ticket purchasers will

have to sit quietly while Dr. King spews i

about the "immorality" of the war in

Viet Nam. Whether we like it or not, the :

United States of Ainerica is at war with

a determined aggressor. How we got into

this war matters little at this point. The

onunit at the nese ties too

ling the same type back at us with re-l

"markable ettectiveness.

Looking at the contlict logically andi:

realistically, we cannot escape the fact

that we have absolutely no course open

to us but to disregard all of the babble

of weaklings. We, as bonafide American

citizens, inust take a stand with our

country. In our actions, in our conver:

sations and in our preachments, we must

give no ald and no comfort to the enemy.

• We must remember that all wars are

immoral ind wher. Martin Luther King

preaches about how immoral the ameri-

can bullets are and tails to ofter us an i

; alternative for stopping those immoral

bullets being hired at our boys, we have

got to take the ex-civil rights worker-

to task for his oversight.

go in a town called Cicero and he hasn't

been the same since. We cannot sit by

and allow him to lose thousands of

Negro citizens also just because he can't

find his own way.

Crispus Attucks didn't call the cause

at Boston Commons "Immoral'. He

ristood up like a man and tell like a proud i

soldier. From that moment on, both black

jand white men have stood up for Amen-

: Ca. Negro citizen soldiers have stood

like men and fallen, it need be, on battle

neids in far away places all over the

world every since Crispus Attuck first

stood up back in the beginning. This na-

tion has grown strong and it is respected

and, yes, even feared, because we have

God to have strong men at the right place

Jat the needed time who didn't mind stand-

should settle for anything less than what

the most courageous bave done.

As we see it, Dr. Martin Luther King

is suggesting that we Negroes take some-.

thing lesser than the courageous route:

•If he follows the same pattern thathe has

'tollowed in his other "remarks" made

in other cities, he will dwell upon Negro

problems just long enough to get the at-

tention of the listeners and then he will

suddenly shitt to the hard-sell of taking.

the lesser route in the war that this

country is now engaged in.

FORIARD TINIES firmly believes that ;

•in the long run we will lose any and all

respect that the total community might

now hold for us. Our job is to try and

RACIAL MATTERS

Reference communication captioned as above made at

Memphis, Tennessee, March 29, 1968.

On the morning of larch 29, 1968, Henry Lux,

the main leaders of the Community on the Move

(COME), the Memphis Negro Ministerial Group leading the

support of the sanitation workers, Memphis, Tennessee, who

have been on strike since February 12, 1968, informed Lux

that a downtown sympathy march for the strikers was planned

for the afternoon of March 29, 1968.

Lawson stated that the march would be restricted

to sanitation workers and adult sympathizers and that every

effort would be made to eliminate the young element which

created problems leading to window breaking, looting; and

general vandalism which disrupted the massive march on

March 28, 1968, led by Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., President,

Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC).

Later on the afternoon of March 29, 1968, Henry

Lux advised that the march did take place running

from

Clayborn Temple, 280 Hernando, to the vicinity of the

Memphis City Hall on Main Street with approximately 200

individuals participating. There were no incidents.

The

Memphis Police Department and representatives of the Ten-

nessee National Guard who are still on duty in Memphis as

a precautionary measure, guarded the entire parade area,

the marchers remaining on the sidewalks and observing all

traffic restrictions. There were no arrests and no incidents.

Lux pointed out that no permit is required for marches of

any kind within the city of Memphis and that the Memphis

municipal authorities are considering the possibility of

passing an ordinance of this type.

Also, on March 29, 1968, Chief of Police James C.

BacDonald of Memphis advised that

there have been no serious

troubles during March 29, 1968. He had instricted all of

his officers to disperse

small groups of youngsters in various

sections of the city and that there were still sporadic out-

bursts of window breaking, minor looting, general vandalis,

and the setting of trash fires. One squad car was fired on by

unknown. Negroes in the vicinity of Dison and Rile in south.

Memphis early on the morning of March 28, 1968, according to

Nachonald, but the individuals firing the shots were

identified. He stated

that throughout the day the Memphis

Police Department received numerous calls of reported looting,

vandalism, and fire settings and fire bombings, although in-

vestigation by representatives of the Memphis Police Depart-

ment and the Memphis. Fire Department indicated that most of

these incidents were minor:

He pointed out that the major

in downtown Memphis with store fronts being damaged. and

practically all of a three block area. He stated that liquor

stores are still closed, that National Guardsmen are guarding

the stores which have been looted and where windows have been

broken, that the merchants are boarding up the fronts of most

of these establishments to preclude further vandalism and

looting and he feels that with the presence of the Tennessee

National Guard, along with the assistance of the Shelby

County Sheriff's Office and his department, that the situation

is well in hand and that, with the exception of sporadic..

outbursts of vandalism, he does not anticipate any imnediate

:trouble in Memphis.'

On the night of March 29, 1968, Assistant Chief

Fenry Lux advised that there were approximately 33 additional

arrests on March 29, 1968, by the Memphis Police Department

charges including miscellaneous looting, disorderly con-

duct, resisting arrest, and threatened breach of peace. He

defendants over to the state, dismissed 46 others, and con-

tinued the cases against 118

other bonds he set ranged from $250 to 52,000=_. 2(14

During the evening of March 29, 1968, the police

received numerous calls of reported fire bombings, vandalism,

hoods but many of these proved to be unfounded on investigation.

Lux advised that the currew imposed by Mayor Henry Loeb on the

night of march 2o, 1908, continued on the night of march 2y,

1968, but that it was a

loose curfew in that any individua

on the streets who had identifications would have nothing to.

to his purpose in being there. This meant that theatres,

places of amusement, and restaurants and other functions

normally operating at night would be uninterrupted.

stated

that riot damage resulting from the March 28, 1968,

breaking and looting was estimated by insurance

officials at approximately $400,000 not including the mis-.

cellaneous fires. He pointed out fortunately none of the

fires were serious. This would not, of course, include

losses due to interrupted business days bécause many office

managers, store owners, government agencies, including

Federal, state and county, dismissed their employees early

both on March 28 and 29, 1968, in order to avoid trouble.

He stated that the Memphis city buses were operating throughout

March 29, 1968, but would stop around 7:00 Pill. and that in

the near future it was anticipated that they would be operating

of a full-time basis.

• Lux advised that Tennessee National Guardsmen are

bivouacked at the National Guard Armory on Central near the

Mid-South Fairgrounds and on the military side of the

Memphis Metropolitan Airport. He stated that there are

approximately 4,000 troops from the west and middle Tennessee

National Guard units on duty in Memphis. He had no knowledge

as to when they would be pulled out, but predicted that they

He pointed out that school absenteeism in the

city school system in Memphis on March 29, 1968, was nearly

40,000 and that the largest number of truants were at the

predominantly Negro high schools.

lux stated that the only injury reported during

the day was to Memphis Police Patrolman E. H. MAXWELL,

whose finger was severely cut while he was arresting a

drunk young Negro who was fighting with other officers on

Polk Street north of Chelsea; which is in a predominantly

Negro neighborhood. He stated that at about 1:15 P.M.,

officers arrested two white youths, namely Samuel R.

iaddell, age 20 of 2581 Kallien, Larry Williams,

äge 20 of/"

1669 Combs.

He stated that he had been informed that

officers seized a .22 caliber rifle in Villiams living room.

He did not have the details of the arrest. He stated many

of those arrested for looting were youngsters ranging from

8 to 12 years of age.

These were being turned over to

demphis Juvenile Court.

The hemphis Commercial Appeal newspaper, Saturday

morning

issue, March 30, 1968, reported in detail con-

cerning activities of Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., on

March 29, 1968, and stated in a story on page

Thomas BeVier that King came to Memphis to star in what was

billed as a "dress rehearsal" for his April 22, 1968,

"Poor People's Crusade" on Washington, D. C. The story

continued, "By his own non-violent standards, the rehearsal

was a Ilop." The story stated that King in a press interview

March 29, 1968, reported that he would be back in Memphis.

as early as April 3 and not later than April 5, 1968, for

another mass march and was quoted as saying.

"We are. going

to have a massive non-violent demonstration in llemphis."

The story stated that the question being asked in Memphis,

the nation, and the world is whether - with the increasing

militancy of black youth - anyone can say with certainty

that a non-violent demonstration will stay that way.

King stated in the interview,

"I am convinced

we can have a non-violent demonstration" but was reported

as adding that it would be impossible to "guarantee" that

NW 68486 Docld:32989755 Page 87•

there would not be any violence.

The story stated that it

was significant that King was more than a half hour late

for his 11:30_A.M. press conference because he was meeting

with three members of a Black Power group, which the paper

referred to as "The Invaders." . BeVier stated that these

three young men refused to give their names and stated that

they would give their own press conference at a later time.

..

The story continued that King was staying in a

$29 a day room at the Holiday Inn Rivermont, also known as

the Rivermont Hotel. King claimed to the newspaper that he

did not realize when

he: came to Memphis that there were those

in the Negro community who were "talking about violence."

He stated, "We (SCLC) had no part in the planning of the

march.

Our intelligence was nil."

He said that it he had

known there were persons likely to start violence, he would

have had them made parade marshals, a move which he said had

been successful in other marches.

•:.

He was reported as being critical of the press

for reporting that he left the march in haste after the

trouble started on March 28, 1968.

He claimed that he left

calmly because he said, "I will not lead a violent march."

He said that while he

"walked" with aides to a car, he was

"agonizing over what had happened.". The story reported that

Assistant Police Chief Henry Lux had earlier said over the

police radio at approximately 11:27 A.M., Thursday,

March 28, 1968, that the march was apparently without leader-

ship as. Dr. King had asked for a police escort away from.

the march a few minutes after the first report of violence

during the march. King was reported in the story as saying

he.did. not think the riot "will in any way affect" his

Washington plans for his Poor People's Crusade to commence

April 22, 1968. He said he is undecided as to how much of

his SCLC

staff

he can spare to organize the next massive

march in Memphis early in April 1968.

The story said that later in Washington, D. C.,

Rev, Andrew Young, Dr. King's top lieutenant, said that the

main thrust of the Washington demonstration would be delayed

for about two weeks and that steps would be taken to avoid

violence and that a "symbolic delegation," including King

would reach Washington on April 22, 1968. The story continued

NW 68486 Docld:32989755 Page 88

---

## Page 89

SANITATION WORKERS STRIKE

MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE

that King claimed that Thursday, March 28, 1968, march was

"poorly planned". which the paper said anounts to criticism

of Rev. James 1. Lawson; Jr., whom Dr. King himself had called

"the leading non-violence theoretician in the country." The

paper reported that Lawson is in charge of the strategy for

the Memphis Negro ministers, also known as COME,. and is pastor

of the Centenary Methodist Church and continued that Lawson

did not entirely agree with King's assessments.

The story stated for instance that King had said

that the Black Power advocates with whom he met earlier had .

said that there had been a lack of communication between them

and the ministers and that they felt "rejected." Rev. Lawson

was quoted by the paper as saying,

"There has been communication.

I don't accept that," referring to King's statement. The

paper said that it was Rev. Lawson who had originally asked

King to come to Memphis and that for about 10 years Lawson

has served in an advisory capacity with SCLC. It stated that

Lawson agreed with King that a non-violent demonstration is

possible and pointed out that this was one of the reasons

King was asked to come to Memphis. Lawson stated, "We didn't

bring in Rap Brown (national chairman of the

Student Non-

Violent Coordinating Committee); we' brought in King."

was reported to have further said that there were other

reasons for bringing in king, one being to give the movement

• in Memphis a "national image" and another was to strengthen

the leadership of the Memphis ministers.

The same March 30, 1968, issue of The Commercial

Appeal newspaper had a lead editorial on page 6 entitled,

"King's Credibility Cap," which stated that hartin Luther

King on the night of March 18, 1968, told an overflow crowd

at Mason Temple:.

"You know what?

We may have to escalate

this struggle a bit.'

'in a few days' and called

'Try it and they will hear you,' said Dr. King.

non-violent protest march from Clayborn Temple to Beale

had an audience with Martin Luther King, Jr., on the morning

of March 29, 1968, were the hereinbefore identified. Charles

Laverne Cabbage, the hereinbefore identified Charles Harrington,

and Calvin Leroy Taylor, a male Negrowno resides at 347 West

Waldorf and who is a senior at Memphis State University:

Taylor works part-time as a copy boy at the Commercial Appeal

newspaper. Taylor has recently told source 2 that he is a

part of the BOP group, which is affiliated with SNCC and

that he has been serving as a liaison representative of

BOP with the COME group, with the Negro ministerial group,

which is coordinating the strike support.

Taylor further

i stated that when Harrington, Cabbage, and Taylor had an.

audience with King that their purpose in seeing King was to"

tell King that they wanted more of the "action". in Memphis

feeling that they were not getting enough of the action.

Taylor refused to elaborate but source 2 conjectured that

by this Taylor meant that the Black Power group wanted

_ more

of a position of leadership and more policy making position

in the over-all Negro movement in Memphis:

Source 2 also advised that the newsmen in Memphis

and other officials will interchangeably use the word

"Invaders" when they are actually referring to BOP and pointed

out that it had been ascertained that actually the Black

Power movement in Memphis uses several names, such as Afro-

American Brotherhood, Black Student Association, BOP, and

Invaders and that Taylor has told him confidentially that

actually there are only about 12 to 15 hard-core 30P

people in Memphis and that the others are merely followers

or people who tend to imitate them. Source 2 also stated

that he had reliably. learned from several individuals who

in the March 28, 1968, march when the trouble began, that the

actual BOP people did

not participate in any of the

vandalism

or looting although prior to the meeting several of them,

exact identities not known to source 2, had been agitating

the young high school age Negroes who were preparing to

participate in the march by indicating that there should be

trouble and that Memphis was not worth saving and that it

should burn, and other inflammatory utterances to this effect.

On the afternoon of March 29, 1968, a third

source advised that Rev. Martin Luther

King,

SCLC, Bernard Lee, Special Aide to King, and Rev. Ralph

D. Abernathy, Vice President at Large, SCLC, all departed

The Filton Favaiian Village is a complex of five

steel and concrete tovers, each approxinately fifteen stories

tall, linked together by

a series of 2-story concrete motel-like

buildings with perhaps 75 independent shops, rastaurants, bars,

etc. arcund a huge

open-air lobby.

In inspection of the halls

and the rooms revealed that

the dividing walls were made of

four irch concrete blocks.

'The Hilton Hawaiian Village has.

apercinately 1100 separate acconnciations,. rcors, suites,

and bent houses with roor for approvimataly 2500 people.

Literally hundreds ane moved ir and out of the hotel every day

accorcing to & fixed schecule, whereby they spend a certair

leneth oi time at this hotel in monclulu, nove cut to other

islands to rake vay forlather tourists to core in, and return to

the hawalian Vallare when the other tourists move out.

Through Yr. ED HASTINGS, a SAC contact, and a personal

friend of SAC PRICE, I. PRICE began a most discreet inquiry to

determine where the subject and his party vere to be located.

It was discovered that the hotel is booked up so full and has

so rany cornitrents on a continuous basis, that it ordinarily

books blocks of ?cons and suites by type and price rather than

making individual assignments to guests who have made reservations;

thus, it would know that or a dertain day it would need, for

example, 1ou s20.00 roors, so 525.00 roors, and 40 900.00 rocms,

but viculd not indivisually assien then until after the incividual

guest had registered at the hotel. This was the case with regard

to the tARTIN LUTHE? KING party.

See med aren

lio specific space had yet been

assigned and for security reasons it was determined best by the

SAC and by the Agents on special assignment, that as far as

possible, the hotel be allowed to follow normal booking procedures.

In the meantime, Sts CLIFFORD and LYMAll proceeded to

establish their identities

as tourists in the hotel

and its

environs. The ticholulu office has ter cars assigned to it,

of which

are relativaly well known and all of which are equigged

2-vay radios.

The brents on special assignment explored the

possibility nitr

the SAC and experienced Agents of the rionolulu

Office of switching license plates on one of their cars and

utilizing it on the special assignment, but the considered opinion

of all concerned sas that security might be lost by such an

arrangerent and it was, therefore, resclved io rent a fertz car

right at the hotel for

use during

the special assignment.

Under secure conditions, Sis CLIFFORD and LYMAi

unpacked

and experimerted with all of the Bureau equiprent

sent out or brought cut to Honolulu under conditions as clesely

approximating that was anticipated in the actual investigation..

They found that all of the equirment worked vell and vould be

effective is we could arrange to be no more than ohe room away

fron the subjects of our interest.

Due to the neavy concrete

construction of the toners co-posing the hotel, approxirately

one-half of the radio transmitting equipnent.rould not be

effective at any great distance because its sigral was somewhat

overshadoved by a porerful local IV station.

SAS CLIFFORD and L'll personally made a most discreet

On Monday, 2/17/54, SAC PPICE vas able to arrange that

the subject and his

that SAs CLIFFORD and LYMM would be riven the suite numbered

406 along side that to be occupied by the princidal subject (405)

and that the otner three brents acula be given the suite

numbered 403. One complicating factor was that no place else

in the entire comples did the hotel have uncocupied space

available allowing the designation of four rooms in a row for

our purpose.

Another complication was the fact that the Subjects

were due to land at the airport at 12:50 D.r., Tuesday, 2/18/64,

and could be expected to be

at the hotel at approxirately

1:30 p.m.

on that cate, but three of the four rooms were occupied

and could be expected to be occupied until the checkout time of

SAS CLIFFORD and IVAN vere able to move into Room 406

in the early evening o l'onday, 2/17/64. The hotel arranged

to move the quests out of Poor 403

late that same evening and

the other trents were able to move in to P.oom 403.

Investigation

revealed that the occupants of Suite 405, which was designated

for kIlle, vere rembers of a folk dance group which was having its

final

dance in the ballncon on the second floor of the sare

coverage in Poor 405 during the evening of Monday, 2/17/64, while

the folk fencing party was going on.

This provided the

necessary coverage which was activated when the principal Subject

Tuesday, 2/18/64.

SAC PRICE of Honolulu, with funds from the San Francisco

confidential fund, is settling the bill for the rooms used for

experiments and for. the tomers at the Hawaiian Village Hotel and

will forward the bills to sa CLIFFORD, who will voucher and blue

slip same.

OBSEPVATICHS AND PECOMMENDATIONS:

(1) No matter what its size in population, Honolulu

is basically a resort srall

and all the

Bureau personnel who participated in the investigation agreed

that the bureau was extrenely wise in designating this operation

to be handled as a special assignmert in a semi-undercover

capacity by Special Agents fron arother territory who were not

snown as Special Agents ir the licnolulu area.

The Honclulu Office

and the Sar. Francisco Agents are convinced that such

an assign-

ment could not have beer. carried out with full security by the .

Honolulu tgents trerselves because they are too well known in

this comparatively small teur. *

(2) Although using only five Agents to make technical

surveys,

own security,

Subjects and

potential subjects, and contact anonymous sources means that the

manpower is

spread very thin especially where two separate

hotels are involved, it is believed that the use of an experienced

coordinated special

assignrent crew may very well be the

best

way to attack

this prosiem.

13). The sac and the locâl fit office are indispensable

to the successful operation of such a special

assigrrent. Ine two big cuestions that the local SAC has to be

a position to answer are: (a) Exactly where is the Subject

going

to Elb? and (b)

Can we get a room next to him? Agents on

special assignment cannot walk in cold in any area,

a crovided resort area, and accomplish tris with. full security.

and lasterinute improvisation if the Ecnolulu SAC could have

been advised in advance, with utmost security, that he would

be called upon to deterrine were the Subject was staying

and to obtain adjacent space for the Agents on special assignment.

This is a suggestion for the Bureau to consider in the event

it plans future special assignments of this sort.

This ore

worked veil due to the excellence of the contacts.

... .

(4) The playing of IV sets in the room and the

operation of incividual air conditioning

units both presented a considerable probler which nade sore of

the conversations almost, if not completely, unintelligiale.

These particular Subjects seemed to have a tendency to turn

TV on most of the time when they were in the room, particularly

in the evening hours.

ReBuairtel3/11/68.

Chicago has carefully reviewed the Nation of islam (NOT)

file concerning the suggestion in referenced airtel concerning

publicity circulated

to possibly embarrass lashington Spring

Project (ISP) efforts in Baltimore through a suggested alliance

between forces of MARTIN LUTHER KING and the NOI.

Aaditionally,

highly placed NOI sources at Chicago, specifically t

Background, as

the Bureau is aware, KING and

ELIJAH MUHAMNAD, head of the NOI, met briefly in Chicago during

2/86 under amicable circumstances, primarily as a result of MARTIN

LUTHER KING's then recent entry. onto, the Chicago civil rights scene

The meeting produced no tangible results insofar as cooperation,

unity or program was concerned, however,

did receive considerable

local publicity.

The meeting was basically for the purpose of

Showing unity within the Negro community.

KING suffered no adverse publicity as a result of this

meeting although within several days MUHAMIlD, at an annual NOI

Convention, made remarks critical of KING for being too close to

the white man.

In reaction to these remarks publicly, KING

glossed over this criticism and to some degree capitalized on it,

indicating that in his efforts to build unified support for the

cause of the Negro, he was in contact with all segments oi negro.

opinion.

Indeed,

as recently as s/G7, MuHAmmad indicated a desire

to again meet with KING to discuss the unity of the Negro.

As the Bureau and atlanta are aware, KiNG and cassius

CLAY were in personal contact in louisville,

Kentucky, in 5/67,

in the course of open housing demonstrations hold under sIC

auspices.

In subsequent newspaper publicity concerning this meeting,

KING was quoted as having praised Clit for his refusal to be

inducted into the armed forzes, coupling this reference to attacks

on our policy in Vietnam.

The NOI publication "luhannad Speaks"

was one of the papers which contained KING's favorable remarks,

including a comment that CIAY had given up $1,000, 000 in order

to stand up ior what his conscience dictated as right.

In short it would appear generally to be true that

contact between KING and the NOI is not a heretofore unknown happenin

and it would appear that any effort to utilize this situation in

Baltine must indicate more than casual assosiations or contacts,

but in order to embarrass or inhibit WSP efforts should indicate

close working relationship or partneuship between the two groups.

It should be kept in mind also, however, that as the

above sources note, although CIAY is nationally known for his

achorance to the NOI, he is also somewhat universally acclained

and embraced by most grouus within the Black Nationalist rovement,

CORE, and SiC as examples, as vell as the black community genezally

and has achieved sonewhat the status of a martyred black folk hero.

CG 157-2209

Referenced airtel requested specific comrents conserning

NOI reaction

i to exposure of joint

type efforts with KING's WSP.

As the Bureau is aware, ELIJAH MUHANAD has publicly

stated that the

white man has given him a million dollaxs worth

of. free publicity. This comment was specifically prompted by a

television series

about MUHAIDAD and the NOI which had nation-wide

exposure, as well as being generally a reflection of constant kn

expose type articles concerning the organization. Pitanas

stated that MUHANAD has been openly upset over a period of

such

lack of publicity,

given him and his organization by the white

press.

It would appear, therefore,

that any disruption progran

as envisioned would in all probability, have no real effect on the

NoX and the most that would be forthcoming from ELIJAH HUHAMMAD

or one of his spokesmen would be a simple denial of such support

fox the WSPe

"Muhammad. Speaks" is one of the principal sources

of finance for the NOI and its presence in ISP offices in Baltimore

is believed a reflection of NOI diligence in assuring wide-spread

circulation of this

puper and would not in any way embarrass or

compromise 'the NOI.

The above is furnished for the information and consideration

of the Bureau and other offices interested in this matter.

PURPOSE.

• Attached For our approval for dissemination are

copies of a communication containing information concerning the

progress of Martin Luther king, JI., President, Southern

Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC); to organize a massive

civil disobedience campaign in Washington, D. C., in the Spring

of 1968.

• BACKGROUND:

0: 3112186

King in the past has publicly announced he will

conduct a massive civil disobedience campaign he calls the

"Washington Spring Project" in early April, 1968, to pressure

Congress, into passing legislation favorable to the Negro.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS:

5- Bull

King is currently holding the first of two workshops

from 2/19-23/68 at Miami, Florida. He has invited approximately

150 Negro ministers throughout the nation to attend this meeting.

The Ford Foundation recently gave King's organization a $230,000

grant to hold these workshops in an effort to develop responsible

leadership in the Negro ghetto areas of the nation's major cities.

It has been determined that King plans to discuss the Washington

Spring Project at this workshop.

the Project. Dr. Morsell is afraid that King cannot control

the demoristrators and there is a likelihood that the overall.

demonstration will be: taken over by extremists.

King appears to be concentrating his attention on

the South where he has chartered a small twin-engine aircraft

to help speed him about urging people to support his campaign

King's Fund-raising Activities:

King told Jones that he would be in California 2/25-27/65 to attend

a big fund-raising project. It will include a showing of the movie "The

Greatest Story Ever Told" and

it would "scare the house of about $28,000."

In addition, there are two or

to give $1,000 (presumably each couple) and they have 26 commitments

already.

King claimed that his organization, the Southern Christian

Leadership Conference (SCIC); needs the money desperately. They also

discussed a group in New Rochelle, New York, which King said already had

$5,000 and desired to use it for a fund-raising project to earn even more.

Jones told king that the advertisement which appeared in "The New York

Times" 2/5/65 soliciting funds on behalf of the SCIC cost $2,000. King sa:

that his office had already received $12,000 as a result of this advertise-

ment. U

Friction Between King and the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee •

(SNCC)

In discussing the current racial situation in Alabama, King told

Jones that SNCC was again saying that King likes to come into a situation

ot the last minute, get all the publicity and

the benefit of contributions

SC claims that King makes "grandstand plays" after SNCC has done all the

eld work. King asked Jones if something could be done about this throug.

Harry Belafonte (noted Negro singer).

According to Jones,

Belafonte is

about the only person that SNCC will listen to and that he has heard

Belafonte stop

leader for the whole novenent.

King stated that the movement must have a

leader because any ideology is fostered around having a leader around thom

supporters can rally.

Jones believes that he can arrange an unpublicized

meeting between SNCC,

SCIC and Belafonte. U

Comment: The naked boldness of King's egotism is vividly reflecte.

in his pronouncements about the movement needing a leader (obviously King

himself). U

Washington Copital lens Service release dated 10/22/62 reveals that

King's integration organization bad an incone of nore than $735,000

Another such nens release dated 11/4/63 revealed that Representative

George Ancrets (D-Ala:) asked the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to

Investigate the ta. status of the SCLC. Andrews is quoted as saying,

'"Thousands and thousanás of dollars are collected and spent each year!

by so-called civil rights organizations and many people are beginning

•to suspect they could be a front for a full-grown racket."

It is noted that king's operations revolve principally around,

the SCIC.

However, fund-raising operations on his part are further auga

mented by the activities of the Gandhi Society for Hunan Rights, rhich

commenced operations in 1962.

AMAL

OBSERVATIONS:

It is believed that an examination of recent incone tar

returns of King might well reveal information which could assist the

Bureau in its efforis to discredit King or neutralize his effective-

This 1s possibly applicable also if the income tax returns of

the scle and the Ganchl Sockety vere reviewed, In tew of the possia

bility that the SCLC has already been under some investization by IRs,

a request for the results of such investigation is indicated.

Tie also

had information in late 1953 that the Ganchi Society mas negotiating

with IRs relative to tax exemptions and therefore the results of any

Ins investigation of that society would be worth procuring. t:

To date ve have been most discreet and circumspect in our

nancling si the king investigation, as rell as corollary investiga-

tions such as revolving around organizations, because of the position

King has not only as a clergynan, but also us a "respected" legro

weader: It is therefore essential that our current requests of the

IRS which are herein being reconuended be handled in a manner which

would provide for optimum security so that neither king nor any other

unauthorized individuals may becone aware

of the Bureau's interest

and so that no embarrassment nay come to the Bureau. For this reason,

the attached memoranca are classified "Secret."

RECOLOUNDATION:

It is recormended that the Liaison Section obtain two

uncertified copies of each of the income tax returns

available for

the past five years portaining to king, the SCLC and the Gandhi

society.

Attached bereto are three menoranda for the use of the

Conmunist Party, USA.

Since 1919 communist leaders have devised

To population. It has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars

pagandizing the negroes in a variety of ways.

These colossal

orts have been related to "equal opportunity" and "self-

determination" policies (the latter being discontinued in 1959

with the approval oi Soviet Pussia because. it was ineifective,

front organizations, parades, denonstrations, articles, pamphlets,

books, filns, speeches, civil rights, "peaceful coexistence,"

et cetera.

These efforts, among other things, have resulted in

establishing today such active Negro communist

front groups as

che MIrIcan ArerIcan leritage Association, freedomways associates

and Sosthern Conference educational Fund not yet cited by the

Attorney General). haditionally, efforts have been and are being

made to infiltrate with linited

degrees of success such legitinate

ment of Colored People, the Negro American Labor Council, and the

Rev. King does not have a phone at his residence. We then attempted to

intact him at his church in Atlania. His secretary advised, upon being told wao

as trying to contact hirn, that Rev. King was "off in another building writing a book.

The further stated that Rev. King preferred not to be disturbed and that it would be

impossible to take to him.

That same day I called the SiC at Atianta and instructed

Memorandum to Mr. Belmont

RE: RACIAL SITUATION

Howard Zinn, the author of the report for the Southern Regionzl

Council, was mentioned in my memorandum 11/15/62 and has been the subject

of a security investigation by this Burezu (100-360217). Zinn was reportealy

a member of the CP from 1949 through 1953 and attended CP meetings auring

that period. Zinn is a history proiessor at Spellman College in Atlanta. It

was the second slanted and biased document written by Zinn on the Albany

situation.

Reverend Mr. King is the President of the Southern Christian

Leadership Conference who arose to prominence during the 1955 - 1956

successful boycott which ended bus segregation in Montgomery, Alabama.

He has been active in Negro segregation matters since that time.

Memorandum to Mr. Belmont

RACIAL SITUATION

RECOMMENDATION:

Consideration has been given to contacting King to straighten him out;

however, this seems undesirable in view of the above facts and it is recommended

he not be contacted.

The backgrand information regarding King, Tevison and Vin has

been furnished to the Department.

Nothing would seem to be gained by contacting the "New York Times"

or the "Atlanta Constitution" as me obviously cannot give them background data

We possess on the CP influence of King, (u)

The Department and the Attorney General have been publicly

criticized on many occasions by King and yet they are cooperating with him.

It is recommended that the Liaison Section of the Domestic Intelligence

¡ Division bring king's comments in the article to the attention of Stai Director

Berl L. Bernhard of the U. S. Commission on Civil Rights and foint out to him

that there is no basis in fact for King's remarkg and in addition point out that - ci

the 5 Resident Agents assigned at Albany, Georgia, are from northern states agai

une is iron Georgia.

ACTION:

That this memorandum be reierred to the Domestic Intelligence Divisio

10r appropriate hancling.

Several weeks ago FORWARD TIMES

made an editorial expression which

stated, among other things, that Dr. Mar-

tin Luther King had strayed oil onto an

extremely dangerous course which ran

fin the opposite direction from the civil

rights leadership course that vast!

numbers of citizens.had come to know

and respect him for over a wide span of

. years.

Now, we wish to make it crystal clear

that this newspaper, of course, respects

ahd upholds Dr. King's right to take a

position that is, what we think to be,

contrary to good judgement. If hewishes.

to be the spokesman for the 'peaceniks',

• that's his business. When, however, Dr.

King joins with others and tries to impose

¿that poor judgement upon the entire Negro

community which is already deser wiw

gore in-depth and complicated problems!

than can apparently be coped with, at that!

: point we call it our business.

FORWARD TIMES takes the position

that Dr. King's visit to Houston next

Tuesday nigit is an imposition upon this

community of the first order. We aiso

think that the fact that he is shrouding

his "remarks" behind a big name popu-

• lar singer like Aretha Franklin suggests

subtertuge. It Aretha Franklin, who is

now at the peak of fame, permits this

group of "peaceniks' to use her name to

further their efiorts, all that we cay say!

is, "that's her business." It she wakes up.

flater and finds that she has acted just

ilse tokyo nose and axis sally, all that

we can say is that she broughtit all upon

hersell.

Our concern is not so much with what

course DI. King and Miss Franklinelect

to follow. oat concerns us is that the in

NW 68486~Doeld:32989755-Page 198--

nocent public, it not properly fore-

warned, might be taken in by their visit

to Houston. We think that if wha: Dr. King

phas to say isn't within itselimeritorious :

enough to drav a crovid, he shouldn't be

coming to town in the first place to say

it. AS it stands now, Aretha Franklin'si

name has been added to the show and many:

people will pay the tee expecting to hear!

her sing. She will be the "balt' to help

get the crowd inside the Coliseum. Once !

inside, the trapped ticket purchasers will

have to sit quietly while Dr. King spews i

about the "immoralty" of the war in

Viet Nam. Whether we like it or not, the :

United States of Ainerica is at war with

a determined aggressor. How we gotinto

this war matters little at this point. The

bold truth is that we are shooting 'live'

ammunition at inem and they are shoot-

ling the same type back at us with re-

§markable effectiveness.

Looking at the contlict logically andü

realistically, we cannot escape the fact

that we have absolutely no course open

to us but to disregard all of the babble

of weaklings. We, as bonatide American

cilizens, must take a stand with our

country. In our actions, in our conver:

sations and in our preachments, we must

give no ald and no comfort to the enemy.

• We must remember that all wars are

The purpose. of this memorandum is

to

recommena

that either Assistant to the Director DeLoach or Assistant

Director Sullivan be approved to personally contact and

brief Governor Nelson Rockefeller of New York concerning

the connunist influence on Martin Luther King, inasmuch as

King is to neet shortly with Governor Pockefeller and King's

comnunist advisors hope to take advantage of the forthconing

meeting to influence events in Latin America along comnunis:

lines. (u)

BACKGROUND

Last week

throu

we learned that

Stanley

Levison,

who is Martin

Luther King's

chief

advisor, was in contact with an

•associate to whom he disclosed that he had recently talked

.. to Rockefeller.

This apparently is Governor Nelson Rockefelle

of New York because Levison said the discussion concerned y

Venezuelan iron ore deposits about which Rockefeller entert

prises are negotiating with the Venezuelan Government.

Levison also told his associate that rockefeller

was aisturbed™

about Martin Luther King's position on Vietnam

and wanted to meet King to discuss it. Levison told his

contact this pleased him because it would give king

* the

opportunity to present to Rockefeller King's views on :Latin

Anerica which he feels has the potential of becoming the

next Vietnam.

According to Levison,.

King wanted to use thé

opportunity to advise Rockefeller on

the steps that should

be taken in Latin America biasedly to avoid this

March 28, 1968, the Memphis Transit Authority which

operates the Memphis

City Bus Systen, after receiving numerous

compisints from its bus drivers that

they feared for their

personal well being due to the disorder, coupled with the

fact that many of them had been individually robbed in the

past, decided as a safety measure to stop the novement of

City Buses for the reminder of March 28, 1968.

The Memphis 'Commercial Aypeal" Newspaper, issue of

March 22, 1968, in a front-page story, by an unidentitied

writer, reported that many of the looters and window breakers

were black power advocates, and that several wore jackets of

the

"Invaders," a local black power group:

This story did

not give any basis for its statement to this effect.

On March 28 and 29, 1968, source one and source

interested in their welfare, but only in treir donations; that

In all probability the individuals going to washington for

possibility that such will occur.

There is also the

The letter should also point out

that KING was in Alabama on about 3/21/68, and did riot make

was another indication that kiNG was talking out of both sides

of his mouth.

It is felt that this letter should be mailed from

SUBJECT: ARTICLE IN "THE NATION" FOR

FEBRUARY 4, 1961, BY

MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.

Es decree,

Beginning on page 91 of the captioned magazine Reverend King has an avile

article entitled "The President Has The Power--Equality Now." A copy of the

magazine is attached. (U)

As would be expected King's article is a plea for faster integration of the

races and he particularly makes the point that much can be done by the Kennedy

administration through Executive Order and example which has not been done in

previous administrations. At the top of page 94 the following statement regarding

the Bureau and other law enforcement agencies is made:

"If, for instance, the law-enforcement personnel

in the FBI were integrated, many persons who now defy federal

law might come under restraints from which they are presently

free. If other law-enforcement agencies under the Treasury

-

Department, such as the Internal Revenue Service, the Bureau

Customs had an adequate number of field agents; investigators

and aaministrators who were Negro, there would be a greater

respect for Negroes as well as the assurance that prejudicial

behavior in these agencies toward citizens would cease."

This is the only reference to the Bureau found in the article. Martin Luthei

King, Jre, is well known for his activities in behalf of the National Association for

the Advancement of Colored People in the south, and he reportedly planned the bus a

boycotts in Montgomery, Alabama, and has participated in set-in demonstrations in &

the south. He has been very active in attempts to integrate the races and Bufiles

contain numerous references to his activities in this regard. M1

-It will also be recalled that just prior to the election King was put in jail

and President Kennedy reportedly called him and was successful in obtaining his

release. Some political analysts have stated that the President's action in calling

King resulted in his receiving a heavy Negro vote in many parts of the country.

Re: MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.

Reverend King resigned his ministry in the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church of

Montgomery, Alabama, early in February, 1960, and became co-pastor with

his father in the Ebenezer Baptist Church, Atlanta, Georgia.. (100-106670) (4)

Although King is in error in his comments relating to the FBI, it is

believed inadvisable to call his hand on this matter as he obviously would only

welcome any controversy of resulting publicity that might ensue. (U)

Tele. Room

Mr. Tolson asked whether the Attorhey General

had turned down any request for technical coverage which

would have been helpful in determining foreign influence

in demonstrations and racial disorders..

We have had numerous instances of

such requests

either being turned down by the Attorney General or remainin

unanswered by him.

Since the individuals and groups which

were the subjects of the requests are engaged in antiwan

demonstrations and in advocating black power and racial

unrest, it is entirely possible that our coverage could have

furnished us information to either substantiate or refute

in such maters. u

The importance of such coverage is illustrated

the fact that bur coverage of the

17

](S)

Our investigation of groups and individuals engaged

in staging demonstrations and other forms of unrest--partiou-

larly activity of national scope--has shown that the telephone

is widely used by them to coordinate with other groups and

individuals throughout the country.

Technical coverage would

not only enable us to obtain a "blow by blow account" of this

planning, but would be extremely valuable in obtaining leads

which would help us in determining whether or not therê is

extensive foreign influence behind these activities. u)

Carmichael and Brown encourage violence and the tearing down

of the United States.

On 8/12/66 we requested coverage of

SNCC.

It was denied

RE: COMMUNIST INFILTRATION

SOUTHERN CHRISTIAN LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE

ADVICED TY RO

Martin Luther King, Jr., President of the Southern

Di. 1athristian Leadership Conference (SCIC), has publicly stated

that he will create massive civil disobediences in the

Nation's Capital and in 10 to 15 major. cities throughout

the United States in the Spring of 1968 if certain

comnitments are not forthcoming from Congress in the

civil rights field. An aide of King has stated "Jail

10nre

will be the safest place in Washington, D. C., this spring."

The Atlanta Office of SCLC will be the focal point

for planning and instructions concerning the massive civil

disobediences and the telephone surveillance is highly

desirable so that -we can keep apprised of the strategy...

and plans of this group. Massive demonstrations could

trigger riots which might spread across the Nation.

In view of the above, authority is requested

to institute a telephone surveillance on the headquarters

of the SCLC, 330 Auburn Avenue, N.E., Atlanta, Georgia,

or on any office to which it may move.

SUBJECT:

SOUTHERN CHRISTIAN. LEADERSHIP_ CONFERENCE

INTERNAL SECURITY - COMMUNIST

PURPOSE: Attached for your approval is an airtel to our

Atlanta Office instructing them to conduct a survey for

possible technical coverage of the southern Christian

Keadership Conference (SCLC) Headquarters where Martin Luther

King, Jre,

is planning massive civil disobedience to disrupt

ten to fifteen major cities in the United States including

Washington, D. C.

BACKGROUND: Since August, 1967, Martin Luther King, JI.,

President SCLC has publicly stated his group will stage

massive civil disobedience to disrupt ten to fifteen

Mong

major cities throughout the Nation. He has also stated

recently that he will call the poor,

the sick and the needy

to our Nation's capital to disrupt its operation in an

effort to spur Congressional action to help the plight of he

the Negro.

King has stated in part,

This may even include a camp-in at the White Houser la

"To dislocate the function of a

city without destroying it can be more effective than a riot."/

0,113

55 54

аЛДд

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS: King recently held a one week retreat

to plan his campaign in this regard. He is attempting to

recruit 2,000 leaders throughout the

Nation to effect this

plan.

Two individuals have been assigned to Washington, D. C.

and other cities to start recruiting.

The early Spring of 1968

is the target date to start massive civil disobedience if

certain demands regarding economic, housing and education

legislation does not receive unequivocal commitment for prompt

Congressional action.

OBSERVATIONS: Because of the effect this plan of King's will

have on the racial movement and even possibly the internal

security of the United States itself, we feel it is most

necessary to have telephone surveillance coverage on King's

headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia, where most of the planning

concenins this operatión will taked eati

Memorandum to Mr. W. C. Sullivan

RE: SOUTHERN CHRISTIAN LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE

In the past, we have had a telephone surveillance

on SCLC, which was extremely productive, but it was dis-

continued on 6-20-66 upon receipt of instructions from

Attorney General Nicholas deB. Katzenbach. He was concerned

about jeopardizing the possible prosecution of a SCLC employee

for an Interstate Transportation of Stolen Motor Vehicles

statute violation.

On June 1, 1967, the Department advised

the evidence against the SCLC employee was of insufficient

strength to warrant prosecution.

Since there

are no prosecutive

matters which this installation will jeopardize, it is felt

it should be reinstalled.

RECOMMENDATION: That the attached airtel be sent to Atlanta

so that a

survey can be conducted to determine the feasibility

of installing a secure installation on SCLC Headquarters.

Upon receipt of results of survey from Atlanta, appropriate

communication will be sent to the Attorney General requesting

authority for this installation.

KUNILL

Reference is made to your inquiry concerning the

telephone surveillance on the Southern Christian Leadership

Conference which was discontinued on 6/21/66 upon instructions

of the Attorney General.

A telephone surveillance was instituted on the

headquarters of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference,

330 Auburn Avenue, Northeast, Atlanta, Georgia, on November 8,

1963. The Southern Christian Leadership Conference is a

racial-type organization headed by Martin Luther Ring, JI.

ORATION CONTAINED

228

magni

This telephone surveillance provided considerable

valuable intelligence information concerning communist:

influence on the Southern Christian Leadership Conference

through King, as well as the communist influence evident in

the outspoken position which King had taken in opposition to

the United States foreign policy concerning Vietnam.

. A memorandum from the Director dated 4/28/66 was

forwarded

to the Attorney General pointing out the valuable

coverage being provided by the telephone surveillance on the

Southern Christian Leadership Conference. Authorization was

requested to continue the surveillance for an additional six

months.

The memorandum was returned by the Attorney General with

a notation dated 6/20/66 stating "I think this coverage should

be discontinued, particularly, in light of possible charges of

a criminal nature against Hosea Williams and possibly others."

The Attorney General's notation concerning Hosea Williams

referred to an Interstate Transportation of Stolen Motor

Vehicles case under investigation by the Bureau wherein the

principle subject, Harold Belton Andrews, alleged he stole

Iour automobiles tor subsequent sale to the southern Christian

Leadership Conference headed by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.

Memorandum to Mr. Sullivan

Re:

SOUTHERN CHRISTIAN LEADERSHIP

CONFERENCE

1004 *2529

Investigation disclosed that one of these stolen vehicles

had been in the possession of Hosea Williams, Director of

Voter Registration for King's organization.

Due to the

ramification involving the Southern Christian Leadership

Conference and the civil rights movement, the Criminal

Division of the Department has been directing the prosecution

in this case rather than the U. S. Attorney.

On 7/28/66, Harold Belton Andrews and Morris Finley

were tried and convicted in U.S. District Court at Atlanta

on charges of Interstate Transportation of Stolen Motor

Vehicles.

Hosea Williams was not prosecuted nor indicted.

• Atlanta Office report in this case dated 8/30/66 set forth that

Assistant U. S. Attorney Allen L. Chancey advised that U. S.

District Judge Sidney O. Smith stated he did not know the

exact date that Andrews and Finley would be sentenced.

Judge Smith indicated he desired to withhold sentencing

until such time as the Department of Justice determined

whether or not additional individuals involved in the case

were to be tried. The report was disseminated to the

Department.

ACTION:

For information of the Director.

This is to advise you of the microphone and wire tap

coverage that we have afforded Martin Luther King, JI., President

Southern Christian Leadership Conference.

F AN

As you are aware King has been in close association with

individuals having Communist Party backgrounds since his rise to

prominence in the civil rights field. F

MINUSE

* Clarence Jones, another close

advisor to king, was a former member and in a position of leadership

'in the Labor Youth League, a communist front organization.

Bayard

Rustin, another of King's close advisors, was a member of the Young

1 Communist League in the early 1940's and

is an admitted homosexual

On October 10, 1963, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy

approved technical surveillances on King's current residence or

at any further address to which he may move.

He also approved the

technical surveillance of the Southern Christian Leadership

Conference New York City Office or any other address to which it

be moved..

Sulleran

A wire tap was installed on King's residence, 563 Johnson

Avenue, Northeast, Atlanta, Georgia, on November 8, 1963, and

discontinued on April 30, 1965, when King moved from this address. It

was not reinstituted on his new residence.

From October 24, 1963, to January 24, 1964, and from

Houly 1, 1964, to July 31, 1964,

a wire tap was

maintained on the

Bushilante

12/19/66

Southern Christian Leadership Conference New York City Office.

In addition, on October 21, 1963, Attorney General Kennedy authorized

a wire tap on the Southern Christian Leadership Conference

Headquarters at Atlanta, Georgia, which was maintained from

November 8, 1963, to June 21, 1966, when Attorney General Nicholas?

deB. Katzenbach ordered it discontinued since he thought it mighty

• be prejudicial to the possible prosecution of Hosea Williams, a

RE: MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.

100-106670

In addition to the foregoing we maintained 16

microphones and 4 wire taps of a few days duration at various

hotels and one temporary residence. These were installed

because of the possibility of a meeting between King and his

communist advisors.

The 4 wire taps were installed under the

original authority given by the Attorney General on 10/10/63.

concerning King's residences:

Attorney General Katzenbach was specifically

notified of three of these microphone installations.

In each

of these three instances the Attorney General was advised

that

a trespass was involved in the installation.

concerning microphone coverage of

pertinent information obtained, perusal of which would indicate

that a microphone was the source of this information.

None. For information.

ADDENDUM, ASSISTANT TO THE DIRECTOR DE LOACH CDD:vea 6/8/68

The Attorney General asked me to come to his office at

approximately 2:20 p.m. In his office were his wife, Assistant Attorney

General Vinson, Assistant Attorney General Pollack, his Executive Assistant

Sol Lindenbaum and the Deputy Attorney Goperal, Warren Christopher.

The Attorney General first congratulated the FBI and stated that

this was the greatest news he had ever heard. He next went into a long

song and dance on the absolute necessity of security and the avoidance of

evasion of civil rights of the subject, James barl Ray.. The Attorney

General asked me questions concerning the quality of our Agent personnel

in London and I told him we had absolute faith and confidence in these men,

otherwise we would not have assigned them there. He stated he thought we

should sendadditional men to London to assist in this case. I: told him

I thought this was both foolish and unnecessary. He asked me about

Legal Attache vinich's bachground and I provided this invimation fur

him. He asked me if the FBI had a representative in the same cell block

with the subject. I told him we did not and that furthermore, inasmuch as

this man was under British custody, we could not even talk to the prisoner

uniess he, the prisoner, agreed to interrogation. The Attorney General

asked if we had a man next to the cell block. I told him we did not and that

he must realize that this man was under British custody and, therefore,

• not the responsibility of American authorities. The Attorney General

stated he would feel better if he knew the exact provisions under which

security the prisoner was being maintained. I made no comment.

The Attorney General asked me if I thought it was necessary to

send a Departmental representative to London. I told him I thought this

was completely unnecessary if the representative would be going for the

purpose of attempting to look into FBI activities. The Attorney General

stated this representative would be going for the purpose of expediting

legal acifivities in connection with the extradition of the subject,

He added

that the Departmental representative would also check with the British

authorities to make certain there was ample security. Furthermore, to

make certain that the prisoner's civil rights were being protected.

The Attorney General asked me whom I thought should be responsible

for bringing the prisoner back to the United States. I told him I previously

discussed this with the Director and that the Director was agreeable to the

- FBI escorting the prisoner back to the United States. He asked how many

men would do this. Iloid him we would untize three very capable men.

He

stated he thought we needed more. I told him I disagreed and that three men

Texas

## Page 282

would be sufficient, particularly if handcuffs and leg irons were used.

The Attorney General asked me if I thought military transportation or

commercial transportation should be utilized. I:told him that military

transportation would probably be better and furthermore that the plane

should land at a military base, possibly near Memphis, Tennessee, so

that maximum security could be afforded. The Attorney General agreed,

He then called Governor Buford Ellington in Tennessee and specifically

asked him to expedite extradition proceedings by immediately making a

request to the President of the United States so that the White House in

turn could forward this request to the British Home Secretary. The

Attorney General also told Governor Ellington that he would personally

feel better if Federal officers (meaning the FBI) would escort the prisoner

back to the United States. Governor Ellington agreed to all terms and

stated that he would comply with the wishes of the Federal Government

in this matter.

The Attorney General next turned to the Deputy Attorney General

and asked him if he thought a Departmental representative should be sent

to England. The Deputy Attorney General replied, "Without question."

The Attorney General next asked the entire group whom they thougni siouia

be sent. He ventured the personal opinion that it should either be Vinson

or Pollack. There was no comment. The Attorney General then stated

that Vinson should go and should leave tonight, June 8, 1968. He asked

that Vinson be placed in touch with our Legal Attache.

1 toid the

Attorney General that sending Vinson was his own business, however, I

would like to make aosolutely certain that Vinson did nothing to upset the

very excellent relationship between the FBI and Scotland Yard. I stated

that Vinson under no circumstances should attempt to push Scotland Yard

around by insisting on different types of security. The Attorney General

repeated that Vinson would be there primarily for the purpose of expediting

legal activities. The Attorney General then told Lindenbaum to have

several Bureau of Prisons officials go to Memphis early Monday,

June 10, 1968, for the purpose of taking a look at the county jail in Memphis

so that proper security could be afforded the prisoner once he was turned

over to the state authorities, (This, of course, is none of the Attorney

General's business inasmuch as once the prisoner is turned over to the

state he is strictly the state's responsibility.)

Upon leaving, the Attorney General told me that he would like

to sit down with me within the next several days and completely go over

this case. I told him that we had already provided him with reports in the

matter and that these reports, plus the press release of today, covered all

necessary details. He made no comment other than to commend the FBI

once again and to say that hard work paid ofi.

ACTION:

In the event extradition proceedings are successful and the FBI

is called upon to bring the subject back to the United States, it is suggested

that Legal Attache Minnich, Special Agent Supervisor Wilbur I. Martindale

and Special Agent Supervisor Kenneth L. Bounds be assigned this responsibility.

Bounds is approximately 6 feet 4 inches tall, is in excellent physical shape,

is a former firearms instructor and is currently assigned to the General

Investigative Division here at FBI Headquarters. He has an excellent

background. In the event the Director approves this recommendation, we

will have Bounds obtain a passport and the necessary medical shots so

that he can proceed to London, England, upon instructions.

I called the Attorney General (AG) at approximately 5:50 p.m.,

June 8, 1968, and advised him that in connection with the conversation in

his office with me, the Director had instructed me to send two men to London

instead of one for the purpose of escorting the subject back to the United States,

The AG was told that this would make a total of four FBI representatives

escorting the subject back to this country.

The AG was additionally told that the Director had instructed th

the two men in question proceed to London as expeditiously as possible so

that they would be on the scene in the event extradition or deportation pro-

ceedings occurred faster than anticipated. He was told that towards this

end, I had called Joe Califano at the White House, who usually handled

military transportation in expedite matters of this nature, to tell him that

if he knew of a military plane proceeding to London, it would be appreciated

It the l'l representatives could hit kee on this plane.

The AG snappishly inquired as to the reasons why this has not

been cleared with him personally. I told him I had specifically mentioned

in his office the fact that three men would be suitable for escorting subject

Ray back to the United States and that he had disagreed stating that he felt

additional men should be assigned to this project. He stated he did not recall

this exchange of conversation.

I told him I recalled it very well. He stated

there was no need to get into a "spitting contest" over this particular issue

and that he wanted me to definitely realize that he did not recall such matters

being discussed. I told hih-I would not back down on the matter and that the

discussion had taken place.

MEMORANDUM TO MR. TOLSON

RE: MURKIN

I the Deputy Attorney General (DAG) of the United States had called me

personally and that I had refused to give him "inside facts." I replied

that when the DAG first called me this morning, I had indicated that I

had no facts to give him but that a short time later I had called the DAG

and had read to him the press release prior to the time the release was

given to the wire services. I pointed out to the AG that his Deputy had

fully approved the press release and had indicated that it was completely

within guidelines of appropriate legal proceedings, The AG replied that

The had been told differently. He stated that he had been advised that I

had not given any information whatsoever to the DAG. I stäted that as.

indicated in my conversation with him, the facts previously mentioned

were true. The AG replied by stating this was one of the biggest cases

the Department of Justice will ever have. He then asked me point blank,

"Who the hell do you think you're working for?" He quickly added "T'll

tell you who you're working for, you're working for the Department of

Justice. " He next added that he wanted to insist that in the future that

jany information whatsoever received in this case, any investigative step

whatsoever, and any communications be brought to his personal attention

without delay. He stated that obviously he had been kept in the dark thusfar

and that he did not intend to put up with this in the future.

I told the AG if he insisted upon making such falsifications that

there was no need to continue the conversation. I then hung up the phone

lon him,

The AG's secretary called me back approximately three minutes

later and stated that he wanted to speak to me again. He then came on the

phone and told me that our conversation had not been over and that he demanded

to know why I had hung up the phone on him. I told him that apparently there

was no need to continue the conversation and that I did not wish to discuss it

further.

He stated that he must insist, as Attorney General, that any arrange-

ments made concerning this case be cleared with him. He stated that in

connection with the military flight for our Agents that I should have realized

Assistant Attorney General (AAG) Vinson wanted to go on the same flight and

would have wanted to make arrangements on a personal basis with the White

House or the military personnel. I told the AG that if he wanted Vinson to go

on a military flight, this was entirely his prerogative to make his own arrange -

ments, The AG then told me he would discuss this case at greater length later

RE: MURKIN

Within five minutes the AG's secretary called again and asked that

I come around to his office right away. I took Mr. Rosen with me as a witness.

The AG had with him DAG Christopher and AAG Pollak. The conversation was

initiated by the AG and he immediately referred to his previous conversation

relating to the Agents who were going to London and the discussion which had

taken place in his office earlier during the day when I advised him that three

Agents would be available in London for the purpose of handling the subject

insofar as his return to the United States was concerned. He reviewed what

he had said earlier and I repeated exactly the position I had previously taken.

There was a stand-off and when he recognized that I had not changed my

position, he turned to Rosen for verification at which time Rosen repeated

that it was his understanding that three Agents would be available in London

and that this matter had been thoroughly discussed at FBI Headquarters earlier.

I made no further reference to this conversation and he then turned

to what he said were the three most important considerations in this matter:

(1) Security; (2) insuring that all proper legal procedures acceptable to the

United States and Great Britain would be followed; (3) that proper interviews

would take place.

In this connection, there was a discussion concerning security and

he referred to the availability of Legal Attache Minnich. He insisted that

Minnich meet Vinson at the plane Sunday morning, June 9, 1968. I told him

that Minnich would not be available to meet Vinson inasmuch as Minnich or

one of our people would probably spend all night at the jail. He asked me if

this was a true statement. I told him it was a true statement or I would not

have made it.

He then referred to the legal proceedings that would take place.

He said that Vinson would be in complete charge of this matter, that he would

make the arrangements and insure that proper procedures be followed. He

said that Minnich would report to Vinson concerning any developments and that

the question of deportation was viewed

favorably by him. He said if deportation

was pursued, it could be criticized from a legal standpoint insofar as he was

concerned.

He said transporting the subject by any plane, military or owned

by the United States Government, is not a free deportation from any country.

He said that his attorneys would be reviewing this matter and would be in a

position to make appropriate recommendations to him. He said that the legal

procedures which would be followed were obviously paramount and would have

to receive first consideration over any expedient investigative procedures.

told the AG at this point that we wanted him to know that the FBI had not injected

- 3 -

RE: MURKIN

itselt into any such so-called legal procedures and that our actions up to this

date had been strictly of an investigative nature. I also advised him that I bad

informed him of the attitude of the British Government with reference to their

attitude toward deportation and that this had not been an opinion óf FBI repre-

sentatives in London. I stated that when I mentioned that there was a 60/40

chance that he would be deported, that this was the attitude of the British

autorities rather than our representatives.

The AG was advised that we had set in motion the obtaining of the

copy of the indictment which had been requested which indictment was returned

by the Tennessee authorities naming this subject as the person responsible for

the killing of King, that this would be made available immediately upon its

receipt and that a properly certified copy was being obtained.

DAG Christopher asked me if the subject was being detained on a

"holding action" or as a result of a violation of British law. He was told that

the subject was being detained on the basis of entering the country with illegal

documents and because he had a loaded gun on his person.

The AG then turned to AAG Pollak. He stated he wanted him to

divorce himself from other work for the next several days and that he should

supervise this case completely. The AG then turned to me and stated that he

wanted Pollak to be kept advised of any communication, airtel, or cablegram

that might come in in connection with this case. I told the AG that any facts

which were pertinent would be furnished to the Department. The AG then

indicated that the meeting was over. •

I called Legal Attache Minnich upon my return to the office and

informed him that he should proceed as planned; however, under no circum-

stances should he give the impression to Vinson or the Embassy that the FBI

was injecting itself into extradition or deportation proceedings. Minnich

properly replied that he had not thusfar injected himself and that as a matter

of tact, following my call to him concerning Vinson coming over there, he had

immediately informed Embassy officials that all proceedings pertaining to

extradition or deportation would be strictly handled between Vinson, the

American Embassy and the British Government. I told Minnich that he should

be diplomatic but firm with Vinson and that under no circumstances should

Vinson be allowed to push our personnel around. I also informed him that the

AG had been told that he, Minnich, would be unable to meet Vinson inasmuch as

the would be spending almost full time at Scotland Yard and at the jail.

PURPOSE: To recommend the installation of a technical surveillance.

(TESUR) on the telephones of Albert and Carol Pepper, St. Louis,

Missouri, and the telephone listed to the Grapevine Tavern ia St. Louis,

Missouri, owned by Carol Pepper, subject's sister, and operated by

John Larry Ray, subject's brother, and the installation of a microphone

surveillance at the residences of Carol Pepper, ad Joha Larry Ray,

and at the Grapevine Tavern, These installations conta assist in the

early apprehension of the subject, which could passibly be instrumental

in reducing the stresses and tension placed on our national security

subsequent to the death of Martin Luther King, sI.

BACKGROUND: We are presently conducting exhaustive and extensive

investigation to determine the present whereabouts of the subject James

: Earl Ray; who is one of the TEN MOST WANTED FUGITIVES. Although

many hundreds of interviews have been conducted and laads run out, we

have not been able to locate the subject nor have ve located any person

who can furnish us any information as to the subject's present whereabouts.

It has been determined that Carol Pepper, the sister of the subject, and

John larry Ray, the brother of the subject, are tie closest relatives to

him. Carol is married to Albert Papper and they reside at 2025 Belleviev, T:

St. Iouis, Missouri, telephone number 645-2948. John Larry Ray resides

at 1900 A Cherokee, St. Louis, Missouri, no telephone listed. Cárol

teresenty owns the Grapevine Tavern, 1982 Arseni, St. Louis, Missouri, Wel

telephone number PR 6-9417. This tavern is operated by John Lary Ray.

John Larry Ray has expressed a cooperative attitude; however,

at Is illt that he is not giving us complete and accrate intocuration... Carol

Pepper refuses to submit to interview and is not coopsiative. • It is felt that

if the subject telephones or personally contacts auy of the relatives, it will

most likely be Carol Pepper of brother John Larry Rax:

As shown in attached memorandum of May 9, 1968, from Mr.

Rosen to Mr. DeLoach, consideration is given to microphone installations on

certain properties of Albert and Carol Pepper. The proposal raises a question

concerning the legality of any action taken against the subject of this case on the

basis of information obtained irom the microphones.

= We believe these microphones can be installed and used without

prejudging the case against the subject. In a very recent decision of the United

States District Court for the Southern District of New York, a listening device

was insialled on the premises of one Levine. Later, a subject named Granello,

an associate of Levine, came up for trial and claimed that the listening device

installed on Levires premises, which was installed by trespass, was illegal as

to him, Granello. It was not contended that any information obtained from the

Levine microphone was used as evidence against Granello at trial either directly

or as a lead. The court held that since Granello had no interest in the Levine

premises, the monitor was not illegal as to him and he could not obtain a new

trial or dismissal of the indictment. U.S. v. Granello, 280 F. Supp. 482 (1968).

Applied to instant case, this rule of law cold work out in different

ways. Assuming that the subject of this case is not on the premises to be...

surveilled by the means suggested, and has no possessory or other right in

?.

those premises, any information disclosed by the surveillance in some way,

such as conversation among the Peppers, could be used to learn the whereabouts

Of the subject for purposes of acrest. The problem becomes somewhat more

complicated, however, if the subject of this, case made a telephone call to those

premises and that telephone call were recorded and used as the basiscior his

apprehension.

He then could claim that the surveillance violated his right of

privacy in the telephone comminication he made to that place, ciling the Katz

decision in the Supreme Court.

Memorandum J. J. Casper to Mr. Mobr

RE: MARKIN

The worst that could happen in either of the above circumstances,

however, - assuming that we follow the precautionary measures listed below -

is that we illegally learn where the subject is located and thus are able to arrest

bim on that knowledge. The rule that comes into play here, established in the

last century by the Supreme Court in Ker V. Illinois, 30 U.S. 347 (1886), is that

an illegal arrest is no bar to prosecution.

Wong Sun v. U.S., 371 U.S. 471 (1963);

U.S. v. Hoffman, 385 F2d 501 (1967); Keegan v. U.S., 385 F2d 260 (1967). A

person may be arrested unlawfully and actually kidnapped into the court having

jurisdiction of the criminal case, yet the court still retains jurisdiction to try

the person for the offense. The court would not allow the prosecution to use

as evidence any information obtained through the illegal surveillance but the

illegal surveillance would not taint the use of any other evidence obtained either

before or after and which was gotten in a legal manner. Nor, to repeat, would

the illegality of the arrest alone, resulting from whereabouts disclosed by unlawful

surveillance, prevent the court from trying the subject for the offense.

It the action being considered is taken, we strongly suggest three

precautionary measures, as follows:

(1) That all recordings be preserved intact. It may be necessary

to disclose some of them to the court or even to the defense.

(2) That no use be made of any information obtained against

anyone whatsoever or in any way whatsoever except for the single purpose of

locating the subject in this case. As we well know by this time, evidence of

the offense obtained in this manner is not admissible. It would not bé admissible

against the subject and it would not be admissible against the Peppers on a charge

of harboring.

(3) Be aware that since this search and seizure is unconstitutional

as to the Peppers, they have at least a theoretical cause of action for damages

against those who installed the devices by trespass. Here again, however, i

nothing learned by this surveillance is used against the Peppers in any way, their

cause of action is diminished to the lowest possible degree, becoming that for a

technical violation only rather than one of substantial harm to them. Moreover,

in any such case the government of the United States should surely be willing to

pick up the tab for any judgment had against those who installed the microphones.

RECOMMENDATION:

For information.

PROPOSED PROSECUTIVE ACTION

1 ~ Mr. Conrad

1 - Mr. Sullivan

This case concerns the murder of Martin Luther King, JI.

On 4/16/68 the Attorney General authorized the filing of a

complaint charging Galt with violation of Title 18, Section 241, U. S.

Code, for conspiring to interfere with the constitutional rights of

Martin Luther King, JI. It was understood that no publicity would be

even to i solant unless some change a the situation inatated ine

complatat should be mix Malic A proposed complaint is set out belowe

On or about March 29, 1968, at Birmingham,

RE 126, at B 8861 - 15-55

Alabama, in the Northern District of Alabama, Eric Starvo

Galt and an individual whom he alleged to be his brother,

entered into a conspiracy, which continued until on or

about April 5, 1968, to injure; oppress, threaten, or

intimidate Martin Luther King, JIo, a ... citizen of the

United States, residing in Atlanta, Georgia, in the free

exercise or enjoyment of a right secured to him by the

Constitution or laws of the United States, namely, the

right to freely travel from state to state. In fuytheranges 1968

of this conspiracy, Eric Starvo Galt did, on or about

March 30

The above proposed complaint is considered to disclose the

absolute minimum information that would be acceptable to a U. S.

Commissioner or Federal Judge, To satisfy the judicial officer, it may

be necessary to add some additional details such as the description of the

gun and the fact it was abandoned at the crime scene. If necessary, such

detail will be added but only to the extent necessary to obtain a warrant.

Memorandum to Mr. DeLoach

RE: MURKIN

Under the statute being used the complaint can be filed in any

District in which the conspiracy took place or an overt act occurred.

On the basis of facts presently available, we are limited to filing the

complaint at Memphis or Birmingham

We understand that we cannot rely on the U. S. Attorney at

at the situation and the complatat would become public knowledges

li we tried to file there, we would immediately lose contro.

We have checked with Birmingham and we have no assurance

we could keep a complaint filed there a secret. We would have to go

through the U. S. Attorney's Office and Macon Weaver, the U. S. Attorney,

is presently in Houston. The U. S. Commissioner is a woman who does

not have too firm a grasp on her operations.

Investigation at the Canadian address given by Galt, 7/31/67,

has not been productive and a Kansas City address as of 3/1/67, that we

obtained in Canada is nonexistent. Galt is last known to have been in

Atlanta, 4/5/68, and his present whereabouts are unknown. We are

faced with the danger that he may leave the country before he is located.

In view of the above circumstances, it now appears charges

should be immediately filed and Galt's fugitive status should be given the

widest possible publicity.

ACTION:

1. We should openly file the proposed complaint at Birmingham.

2. We should issue a wanted flyer and a' fugitive press release.

3. We should issue an Identification Order even though no

fingerprints are available.

4. At the appropriate time, the Attorney General should be

advised that circumstances have required the action being taken.

This is the case involving the murder of Martin Luther

King, JI. •

With reference to the dissemination to the Department

of investigative reports in this case, such reports fall into two

categories: a) reports containing information of evidentiary value

pertinent to the prosecution of the Federal violation involved; and

b) reports containing the results of the extensive fugitive investigation

conducted to locate and apprehend the subject, James Earl Ray.

"="

All reports pertinent to the prosecution of the Federal

violation involved, and in which the Department has a legitimate

interest, have been disseminated promptly to the Department and

there has been absolutely no delay in doing so.

The remaining reports contain the results of our extensive

fugitive investigation to locate and apprehend Ray. Copies of these

reports were not disseminated to the Department since they relate.

solely to the fugitive aspects of the case, and contain no evidentiary

material or information of value to the Department in the discharge

of its prosecutive function relative to the Federal charge involved,

There are twenty such reports involving approximately

2, 000 pages. They contain background data and results of extensive

interviews and/or other investigation conducted to locate Ray. Although

they do not relate to the prosecution aspect of the case, they will none

Memo Rosen to DeLoach

RE: MURKIN

dentially came to our attention before Vinson's memorandum was written

that British prison authorities had asked Vinson for information of this

type in connection with their responsibility to maintain Ray's custody

and the extradition proceedings.)

we had, of course, reviewed such records in the initial

phase of the fugitive aspect of the investigation, and the results had

been set forth in the fugitive reports dated May 15, 1968, and June 14,

1968, submitted by our Kansas City Office. Copies of these reports,

which contained in full the information requested by Vinson in his

letter, were furnished to him on July 19, 1968, Since the Attorney

General had requested that information relating to the case be furnished

to both Vinson and Assistant Attorney General Stephen J. Pollak of

the Civil Rights Division, copies of the pertinent reports were also

furnished to Pollak.

It should be noted Vinson did not furnish Pollak a copy

of his (Vinson's) July 12, 1968, letter to the Bureau and consequently

Pollak is apparently completely unaware the pertinent Kansas City

reports were furnished to him and Vinson in answer to Vinson's

specific request. This is another typical example in the Department

of the left hand not knowing what the right hand is doing and explains

why Pollak has gone off half cocked in erroneously accusing us of delay

in disseminating the reports in question.

As a further example of this lack of coordination between

Pollak and Vinson as relates to this case, it is noted that after Ray

was turned over to state authorities in Tennessee we inquired of Vinson

by letter whether the Federal process against Ray should be dismissed

since the extradition order did not cite the Federal Civil Rights charges

and it was our understanding that Ray could not, therefore, be prosecuted

on Federal charges. A copy of our letter was furnished to Pollak.

Vinson in reply advised us that he felt the Federal process

Should be dismissed; however, Pollak, apparently unaware of Vinson's

position, subsequently advised us that he felt the process should not

¡be dismissed pending disposition of the state murder charges against

Ray. It was necessary for us by memorandum to point out the

discrepancy in the two views and request clarification in the matter.

Tat 15 the ease seroirun the murder at Martin zuther kit ye

A confidential source at the telephone company in Houston

Cleate

has furnished the iollowing intormation. \ Hugh Ainsworth of "Newsweek"

advised the telephone company that Louis Lomax and Charles Stein

identitied a public telephone at Uvalde, Texas, as one used by Ray to

make a call to New Orleans between 6 p.m.

'and 9 p.m., 12/70/6%

Taxi-La

Telephone company records show that no call was made to

New Orleans from this telephone during the entire month of December.

Only one interstate call was made between 6 p.m. and 9 p. ., 12/16/67.

This call was by a man identifying himself as Ben Gomez and was made

to the residence of Guadalupe Mata (phonetic) at a telephone number in

California. Mata is being checked out as are eight calls made from this

telephone to T'exas telephone numbers between 6 p.m. and 9 p. Mo,

12/16/670 g

Mrs. Clovina/Olonzo, New Orleans, mother of Charles Stein, C

describes him as "crazy but harmless." She bases this opinion on the

fact that he holds conversations with "space people" and on several

occasions has asked her to look into the sky to see a flying saucer he

allegedly was watching; she could see nothing. She also stated that Stein

talls to trees and explains this by saying that trees were placed on earth

for a purpose.

REG 7149/4-138261-2598

Anthony Charles Decarvelho, a friend of Charles Stein in

Orleans, has advised that he held several conversations with Stein

when Stein was in New Orleans last December and that these conversations

dealt with a "cosmic philosophy" in which Stein believes. Decarvelho

said this philosophy deals with flying saucers, space people residing on.W

earth and attempts to get closer to the Creator. Stein said that the Creator

had provided for him in making the subject available to drive him to

RE: MURKIN

New Orleans. Stein told Decarvelho he felt that he was on the

threshold of converting Ray to his "cosmic philosophy" and hoped to

complete the conversion on the return trip from New Orleans to

Los Angeles.

Lomax and Stein have now returned to Los Angeles. Stein

advised the search for the telephone booth used by Ray had been

nonproductive. He said a couple of telephone booths in Uvalde, Texas,

looked familiar but he could furnish no factual data as to their use by

Ray.

In an article for immediate releaseby Louis Lomax, now

writing for the North American Newspaper Alliance, Lomax falsely

claimed that there are certain contradictions in the FBI investigation.

Lomax in his article states as follows.

1. Lomax claims: The FBI has been forced to admit that the

fingerprints circulated as those of Ray are in fact of someone else.

Facts: The FBI has issued only one set of fingerprints

and these are the actual fingerprints of Ray. When Ray escaped from

prison in April, 1967, Missouri authorities issued a wanted notice that

bore the wrong fingerprints; however the warden immediately issued a

corrected wanted notice bearing the correct fingerprints. We had nothing

to do with these wanted notices issued by Missouri almost a year before

King was killed.

2. Lomax claims: An FBI search of the 1966 white Mustang

driven by Ray unearthed Green Stamps that were issued as a result of

a purchase at a Birmingham, Alabama, gas station in mid-february, 1960.

FBl reports consistently place Ray in Los Angeles as a student at dancing

and bartending schools at the time of the gas station transaction.

Facts: The manager of the service station in Birmingham,

Alabama, stated that the station purchases S & H Green Stamps every two

weeks and upon reviewing the stamps from the 1966 Mustang of Ray the

manager stated that the stamps were purchased on 9/8/67 from the S &

Company and the number on the top of the stamps would indicate that they

were given to a customer sometime during 9/8-22/67. It is noted that

Birmingham investigation indicates that Ray was in Birmingham, Alabama,

from 8/26/67 to 10/6/67.

Memorandum to Mt. DeLoach

RE: MURKIN

3. Lomax claims: FBI reports indicated that cigarette

butts and ashes were found on the floor of the white Mustang when it

was recovered in Atlanta, Georgia, although Lomax alleges Ray does

not smoke.

Facts: The Agents in Atlanta, upon examination of the

1966 Mustang, determined there were no apparent cigar or cigarette

ashes on the floor of the white Mustang and the ash tray was clean.

4 Lomax claims: The FBI reports indicate that Ray was

in Los Angeles until 3/27/68; he is reported to have bought the fatal

weapon in Birmingham, Alabama, on 3/30/68. Ray could not have driven

the route in a Mustang in that short period between 3/27/68 and 3/30/68.

Facts: Our investigation discloses that Ray departed

Los Angeles, California, on 3/17/68 giving a forwarding address as

General Delivery, Atlanta, Georgia.

5. Lomax claims: The most fatal oversight was the FBI's

failure to uncover the console television set Ray gave to a Hollywood

girl friend in return for her portable television set. The back of this

television set contained handwriting believed to be that of Ray.

Facts: We were perfectly aware that Ray traded his console

television set for a portable model and the television set has been in the

possession of a person whom we have interviewed at length. Our

Los Angeles Office advises that there is no handwriting on the back of

the television set.

6. Lomax claims: A clear reading makes it all but certain

that Ray took three trips to New Orleans between 12/13/67 and the end

Jof March.

Facts: Our investigation thus far discloses that Ray made

two trips to New Orleans: once when he left Los Angeles 12/15/67, was

registered at a New Orleans motel, 12/17-19/67, and returned to

Los Angeles 12/21/67; and again when he left Los Angeles, 3/17/68,

and delivered a package in New Orleans to a relative of Charles Stein,

apparently on the evening of 3/21/68.

Memorandum to Mr. DeLoach

RE: MURKIN

7. Lomax claims: The FBI did not retrace Ray's trip to

New Orleans with Stein to find the telephone booth Ray used to call

New Orleans and did not consider the possibility Ray had called

New Orleans from a telephone booth in the St. Francis Hotel in

Los Angeles.

Facts: Lomax and Stein spent several days in an

unproductive search for the Texas telephone booth allegedly used by

Ray. We are checking the records of all calls made from more than

170 telephones along the route driven by Ray and Stein in December, 1967.

We have previously checked out calls made from the telephone booth

in the St. Francis Hotel indicated by Lomax as having been used by

Ray and no pertinent information was developed. We are also checking

calls made from all other pay telephones in the St. Francis.

ACTION:

Extensive investigation is continuing throughout the field

on a top priority basis to locate and apprehend Ray as quickly as possible.

Memphis authorities have indicated that they may seek a

murder indictment against Ray from a local grand jury on or about

5/3/68. It is not yet known if the testimony of FBI Agents will be

necessary but we will furnish whatever cooperation local authorities

may require in presenting the matter to a grand jury.

This is the matter involving the murder of Martin Luther

King, JI.

Louis E, Lomax has now released his final news article,

It is a vicious and unwarranted attack against the Bureau and is

replete with misstatements of fact and ridiculous conclusions.

1, LOMAX STATES: The Director deeply disliked King

and once referred to him as a notorious liar; therefore, few

black people will believe the Bureau will work overtime to

find King's slayer.

FACTS: The total facilities of the FBI have been

... "=

fully committed to this case from the outset, Investigation

has proceeded around-the-clock on a top priority basis

throughout the United States and in various foreign countries.

Thousands of interviews have been conducted and hundreds

of suspects have been processed. A tremendous number of

examinations have been conducted by the Laboratory and

Identification Division. Every logical investigative approach

is being vigorously pursued and there will be no let up

until Ray is apprehended.

2. LOMAX STATES; The FBI is inept or its bungling

is intentional,

REG-20 4438861-3145

FACTS: The Bureau's record in this case is one

of substantial achievement, Starting with an unknown subject,

the man known as Eric Galt was identified as a prime suspect

within five days, Within another week we had obtained a

photograph of the subject and the Attorney GenerRe MAY 9 1958

warrant Federal process. Three days later,

as a result

of a project to check latent fingerprints against the

fingerprints of more than 53, 000 fugitives, Ray was

determined to be identical with Galt.

3. LOMAX STATES: Somebody managed to circulate

wrong fingerprints for Ray and if he had been arrested

when he abandoned his car in Atlanta (#/5/68) he would

not have been identified as Ray.

FACTS: The FBI has issued only one set of

fingerprints and these are the actual fingerprints of Ray.

When Ray escaped from prison in April, 1967, Missouri

authorities issued a wanted notice that bore the wrong

fingerprints; however, the warden immediately issued a

corrected wanted notice bearing the correct fingerprints.

We had nothing to do with these wanted notices issued by

Missouri almost a year before King was killed.

4. LOMAX STATES: The FBI has pre-empted local

police from the case by declaring the King murder a

conspiracy.

FACTS: We have closely cooperated with the Memphis

Police who chained a murder warrant immediately after

Federal process was obtained. All evidence has been

turned over to the police together with the results of

Laboratory and fingerprint examinations and we have

offered locai authorities whatever assistance may be

needed in presenting the case to a local grand jury.

5. LOMAX STATES: The FBI has yet to ask the

cooperation of the Los Angeles Police,

FACTS: Our relations with the Los Angeles Police

in this case have been excellent. We have checked their

records on the subject and various other individuals and

on 5/3/68 when the police received a letter to the "Los Angeles

Times" purportedly written by the subject, it was immediately

made available to the Los Angeles Office,

6. LOMAX STATES: Ray made at least three trips from

Los Angeles to New Orleans.

Memorandum to Mr. DeLoach

RE: MURKIN

FACTS: Ray is only known to have made two trips

from Los Angeles to New Orleans, in December, 1967, and

in March,

, 1968.

7. LOMAX STATES: The FBI confiscated telephone

company records listing calls made from Los Angeles

telephone booths used by Ray and only the FBI knows what

these records show.

FACTS: We have not confiscated any records, We

have obtained information from the telephone company

regarding calls made from all pay telephones in the

St. Francis Hotel, Los Angeles. It would appear that •

Lomax has been unsuccessful in his efforts to obtain

similar information from the telephone company.

8, LOMAX STATES: America's blacks never have

trusted either the Director or the FBI.

FACTS: We have long enjoyed the confidence of

responsible Negro leaders and the responsible Negro press.

This confidence has been gained by the Bureau's continuing

success in handling Civil Rights cases such as the murder

of three civil rights workers in Mississippi, the murder of

Lt, Colonel Lemuel Penn in Georgia, the murder of

Viola Liuzzo in Alabama, investigations concerning

discrimination in voting, education, and many similar

investigative accomplishments.

8, LOMAX STATES: The FBI leaked a story to the

press suggesting a Negro was behind King's murder.

FACTS: This is absolutely false.

10, LOMAX STATES: The Director should publicly

admit his dislike for King and then "share the hunt with a

less prejudiced agency; the cause of justice would be better

served if the investigation were under a Warren-type,

biracial commission,

FACTS: This is unworthy of comment,

## Page 327

Mèmorandum to Mr. DeLoach

RE: MURKIN

11, LOMAX STATES: It is certain powerful men in

American society were part of the deed.

FACTS: We have developed no evidence to indicate

this is tre nor does Lomax document this statement in

any way.

In his prior articles Louis Lomaz made reference to a

"mysterious blond" named Jerri who he alleged had been involved

with Ray at Los Angeles and läter went to Vilwaukee where Lomar

said she had disappeared, Jerri has been identified as Dyell

Dennis, a prostitute and narcotics addict whose relationship with

Ray appears to have been limited to a single meeting in a bar followed

by a brief visit to his room.

Edgar John Pendleton, Los Angeles, with whom Lomaz

has also been in contact, has made available a letter he received trom

Dyrell Dennis, postmarked 4/19/68 at Milwaukee, This letter

states in part,

"Have you seen Ray? I hope he is OK,". Pendleton

denies any knowledge of the subject and states the Ray mentioned by

Dennis is Ray Selma, a Mexican-American who formerly resided at

the St. Francis Hotel, It is noted Dennis has stated she knew the

subject only as tric,

Local authorities are scheduled to present this matter

to a grand jury at Meraphis, 5/7/68, to seek a murder indictment

against Ray, At the present time it does not appear that Bureau

personnel will be required to testify, but the Special Agent in Charge

will be available if he is needed.

ACTION:

Vigorous investigation is continuing on a top priority basis.

While having lunch at Hammel's on 7/25/68,

Jim McShane,

could, U. S, Marshal's Office, Department of Justice, asked if he

sit at my table for a few minutes. I tola him to sit down.

McShane told me that he wanted to express the deep resent~

ment that he and all US Marshals felt over the fact that the FBI

had brought James Earl Ray from London to the US. He stated this

was logically a job for the us Marshals and that, while he had

always meticulously adhered to the premise that the Marshals

should never infringe on FBI jurisdiction, yet the FBI had cer-

tainly infringed on the Marshals' responsibilities in this

instance.

McShane also told me that he had discussed this matter

with Fred Vinson and planned to mention it to the Attorney General.

I told Mcshane that it appeared his complaint was being

misplaced, inasmuch as this was something he should discuss with

the AG.

I told him that, although the AG made the final decision,

I wanted McShane to definitely realize that I personally vas glad

• that the FBI had brought the subject back to the US. I stated

this was a highly important case, very technical and complex in

nature, and if this man had started discussing the aspects of the

case with marshals, the marshals would have definitely been

completely lost.

licShane replied that he personally had brought a subject

back from overseas in a previous important case.

I told him I

remembered this, inasmuch as this particular subject had gotten

away from him and had succeeded in slashing his wrists. McShane

laughed and admitted this.

know of his feelings. He stated he did not care whom I told

of his complaint. I stated it made little difference to me

whom he complained to; however, once again, if he desired to lodge

a complaint regarding the policy involved in the return of the

subject, he should discuss this with the AG and not the FBI.

He stated he planned to do this. He then left my table.

The Director was advised of this matter on 7/26/68.

Galt and the vehicle. A number of leads were furnished to the sub-

stantive desk for follow-up. This meant that the computer searched

approximately 2•1/2 million tape transactions with the NCIC system

during that period.

As the result of the request that the latent fingerprint

obtained in the Murkin case be searched against all fugitives, again

the NCIC system was used. Using the computer, the 25, 000 fugitive

records in the NCIC were searched looking for only the sixth finger

of the fingerprint pattern stored in the NCIC record for ridge counts

19 to 15. The questioned ridge count was reported by the Identification

/ Division to be 11 or 12. In two hours machine time the computer

identified 1, 740 possible records for the Identification Division to

check within the ridge count range of 9 to 15. This information was

furnished to the Identification Division and within the first 100 records

positive identification was made of the subject in this case. If this

had to be dene manually it would have possibly taken several weeks

oF longer as they would have po way to isolate the questioned finger.

JAMES EARL RAY

• ITERESTEG IDENTIFICATION

Martin Luther King, Jr., was killed on April 1, 1988, while

standing on a balcony of the Lorraine Hotel in Memphis, Tennessee.

The

unknown. killer made good his getaway, but in so doing, left behind evidence

that would eventually help lead to his identification, apprehension and imprisonment.

Items left behind were a . 30-06 Remington rifle with attached Redfield telescopic

sight, binoculars, and a blue zipper bag containing clothing and personal

articles. These items were found in the vicinity of a rooming house across

from the Lorraine Hotel. Investigation determined that subject had rented a

room at the rooming house using the name John Willard, and it was from the

bathroom in this establishment that the fatal shot was fired. The rifle and other

evidence was delivered to the FBI Laboratory and Identification Division by a

Special Agent of the Memphis Division.

Several latent prints of value were developed on the items

submitted. Two of these latent prints, one on the rifle and one on the

binoculars were found to bave been made by the same finger and the position

of these prints, as well as the shape and slope of the ridges, indicated tha

prints were probably from the left thumb.

Thorough investigation developed considerable information.

relative to the murderer. The rifle had been purchased in Birmingham by

an individual using the name Harvey Lowmeyer; the white Mustang believed

to be the getaway car was registered to an Eric Starvo Galt wio had spent

the night preceding the murder at the Rebel Motel in Memphis. Galt was

further traced to a rooming house in Atlanta where additional evidence Fas

recovered, including a map of Mexico. A latent fingerprini developed thereon

was identified tito the latent prints on the rile and binoculars. This identi-

fication enabled the fBi fingerprint experts to say that this print, in addition

ta probably baing from the left thumb, was an unar loop of 12 ridge counts.

The latent prints developed on the rifle, binoculars, the map,

and other evidence was been compared during the eleven days following the

murder with approximately 400 suspects, had been searched through all

sections of the FBI's single fingerprini file and .compared with all outstanding

F 31 idensincation orders.

NW 68486 Docld:32989755 Page 336

## Page 337

Based on the premise that the latent fingerprint recovered

from the rifle, binoculars and man of Mexico was probably from the leit

thumb and was an unar loop of 12 ridge counts, a review of the fingerprint

records of the 53, 000 fugitives on file was undertaken and it was found that

approximately 1900 of these fugitives had unar loops of 10 - 11 ridge counts

in the left thumb. Comparisons were started and on April 19, 1968, 15 days

after the crime, the latent fingerprints were identified with the fingerprints

01 James Earl Ray, an escapee from the Missouri State Penitentiary Where he

had been serving time for robbery.

The fingerprint identifications with James Earl Ray triggered an

intensive man hunt involving law enforcement officers and investigative

personnel, not only in the United States, but also Mexico, Canada, England,

and otber countries.

The possibility that Ray himself might have been killed was

not overlooked and all unknown deceased fingerprint cards received by the

FBI were referred to tbe Latent Fingerprint Section for comparison. One

case of this type concerned a body found buried on the beach at Acapulco,

Mexico. Fingerprints taken by local authorities from this body were examined

in the Latent Fingerprint Section but, because of the condition of the body,

were of no value. An examiner from the FBI's Latent Fingerprint Section

flew to Mexico and on examining the flesh of the fingers was able to determine

that the body was not that of James Earl Ray.

Another phase of the investigation led to Canada, and there,

following an exhaustive search of passport applications, it was determined

that Ray nad obtained a passport under the name of Ramon George Sneyd and

had taken an airplane flight to London.

Copies of the FBI Identification Order prepared following Ray's

identification by latent prints were immediately furnished to Scotland Yard and

on June 6, 1969, while attempting to board a flight for Brussels, Belgium,

Ray was arrested at London Airpori.

Ray was subsequently ordered extradited to Memphis, Tennessee,

to stand irial for murder and to Missouri as an escaped felon. On Marca 10,

1069, Pay plead guilty to King's murder and was sentenced to 99 years in the

Tennessee State Penitentiary.

This is the case involving the murder of Martin Luther King, Jr.

It has previously been reported Sandy Smith advised the Bureau

that "Life" magazine had information alleging Curtis Way, Newark, had

photographs showing. James Earl Ray marching with King two weeks

before the murder. It has now been determined that the photographs taken

by Way are actually photographs of John Patrick O'Rourke, formerly

a Sergeant on the West Orange, New Jersey, Police Department for

sixteen years. O'Rourke does not appear to have any connection with

this case,

The Laboratory has determined that a piece of brown thread

from the room Ray had in a "hippie" rooming house in Atlanta is like

the brown thread used to mend undershorts abandoned with the rifle in

Iviemphis at the time of the killing. The undershorts have been traced

to Ray by the laundry tag.

Information vas received from "Life" magazine that one

Earl Smith, Nemphis, had allegedly been approached regarding a plot to

assassinate King. Smith has been interviewed and related that he served

six years in the Air Force as an Explosives Ordnance Disposal Technician.

In August, 1965, he was employed at a Testern Auto store in Iverphis and

frequentea a bar on Bellevue Street, Smith does not recall the exact

(location or the name of the bar. While in this tavern Smith states he

engaged in conversation with another patron and mentioned his military

specialty. Two days later he met the same man again in the bar and

this man said that since Smith had been in the Air Force he should have

contacts for obtaining munitions and explosives. He then requested

Smith to get 50 hand grenades and laid $5, 000 in cash on the table saying,

"This is yours it you get me the grenades." The man then told Smith

that he and four others in Memphis had vowed that one of them would

kill Vartin Luther King, JI., in one way or another and this was why they

wanted the hand grenaces. Smith asked the man if he was a member

of the Ku Klux Klan and he replied that he was not. Smith declined to

provide hand grenades and was told, "It you can't get them for me, you

had better forget it." Smith has had no further contact with this man

and does not know his identity. He described him as forty-five years of

age, 5'7 tall, 220 pounds, gray hair, and driving a new Corvette:

automobile.

After being interviewed Smith alleged that he had been fired

from his job because he had furnished information. C. E. Weaver,

general manager of the Western Auto store was contacted and said he

had not fixed Smith but had told him to go home because he was drinking

on the job. He also said that Smith had failed to appear at a scheduled

meeting of employees at 6:30 a.m., 1/11/68 and he had determined that

Smith had been drunk the evening before and had overslept.. Weaver

considers smith to be deceitiul, unreliable, probably a heavy crinker

and weaver has been considering firing Smith.

Records of the penitentiary at Leavenworth show that Ray

was approved for the honor farm in 1957 but was never so assigned

as he did not feel he could live in the honor farm dormitory because

it was integrated.

John Larry Ray, subject's brother, has been located in

Sto Louis where he operates a bar. John claims he has seen the subject

only twice in twenty years, the last occasion being three years ago

at Missouri State Penitentiary. John Ray expressed wonder that Ray

is being hunted by the FBI since all he has done is "Kill a nigger" and

there would be no interest in Ray it King had been white. John Ray

said the subject would have no reason to contact him and would not be

able to locate him anyway.

Radio station KNEW, San Francisco, has a recording of a

"stalk show" that occurred between 9 p.m. and 10 p. Mo, #/ 10/60. Ar

unidentified caller alleged Adam Clayton Powell offered $20, 000 to kill

King and stated, "I am a Negro myself and I belong to a militant group.

Well, if you turn around and check to find out why he offered $20, 000

on Reverend King's death to four men in a UCLA building. I was there,

one of twenty-six men at that party. They had a big fight between the

two of thern, It was never put in the paper. You have the FBI investigate

and find out why the man was offered $20, 000 and a hideout in Bimini.

That is why I left Ios Angeles, to come up here, because I have heard

your program and explain everything to you so you can turn it over to the

FBI and let them figure it out."

The caller also said the meeting had been in a white house and

when the announcer asked for his name so he could be contacted by the

FBI, the caller stated, "Well, I don't want them to contact me because

my life ain't worth two cents, on account of the man that hit (censored,

censored) it might trip away from him. That is all I am going to say.

Thank you." Los Angeles is contacting racial sources for any information

as to such a meeting and the statements actually made by Powell.

ACTION:

Every possible means of locating Ray is being vigorously

pursued.

I stated that in Ray's case, ve heve not lound a olegle angle that

would laricate a conspiracy. i suld the ouy significant thing is the money

he nad and which he spent trechy in paying bille and I thought that could bare

beea catained from a bank robbesy.

The Attorney General said that li wo

could sbow he robbes the benk at Alton, it would be helpful. I said we are

working on that becauso he was paying his bills with $50 bille no to his arrest.

I sald on the other hand he stayed at flop houses and never staged at a first-

sentative of the Memphis Police Department on board or not, and I sail a

would sot thinks so. I said I would think wa would be responsible for taklag"

him from the British and arrange with Izanà Holloman to have the Memphia

Police at the airport in Meraphia on arctral, but to do li alacet on an "eges

The Attorazy General commented that he will know shen he gets in.

I said there la a military airport in London and I thought that is

whare the military plane should land li it goes trom this country with

absolute silence on the part of the Commanding General as to lis departure,

that the first moniedge in tals country aculd come when he is delivered to

0f Dx. Bing will do everything in theis power to kill him. I said the same

I sald this again shows bis astuteness as all three are ilving people

resiling in Gunada who never knew him and never heard of him. I said on

the other hand, Ray spent last year, when he was wanderlos arcuad the country,

a great portion oi the time in Canara and l thought he was planning this thiny

and secking a double identity Ilke Sneya, Galt, and Bridgeman and checktag

out thoseiames so li there were any check made on his application for a birth

them, but they are mentally mbalanced.. The Attorney General said it is a

pablic salety pIcolem now. I said i do not invor the view that the countay

le depraved and all thai. I said I thias ve have a great block ai line people

¿n this country; that there may be some depraved citizens, but it is not a

depraved society, The Attorney General sald he thought there was tox much

thung to so.

I Eid I boped the new Commission toe Preatdent has appoided

Pill leep a balanced viempoint aa to that because the other Commission

went fas astray in regard lo white racism, I sald thera is raciam but not eg

precominantly as the Kerner Commission found It to be. The Attorney

General saul he had never found it 30. I said as an example take the meeting

yesterday (Solldarity Day); that more than 50% of those so attended were white

and it ras not pretominantly Negro.

The Atorney General said that was

surpotsing to him and he felt better to see it that way. I sald this shows

tat white raclam is not as predominant as we bare beca led to believe.

I said I hope the Elsenbower Commission when they get around to thel

I said I get annoyed with the

editorials about cur sick soclety a 1 do not bellere there is such a thing

In this country although there are zome sick citizens. The Attorney General

said that if I could inake this point in the Law Enforcement Bulletin on the

Director's page, he thought it would be helpial. I said I have been working

sa that just recently: that the idea was given to me by MeGil oi the adanta

Constitution. I said he had a line editorial about tbe attacks on the Sa

This is the case involving the murder of Martin Luther King.

Reference is made to previous memoranda concerning

Jensen's plan to interview subject Ray in the above-entitled matter

at the Tennessee State Penitentiary, Nashville, Tennessee.

I had previously advised that Jensen had entered the maximum

security building of the institution at 3:44 p.m. This information was

furnished to the Director's Office immediately thereafter.

It is also pointed out that the steps outlined and the Director's

comments concerning the need to make no public statement as the press

and TV would descend on the penitentiary en masse were brought to the

attention of Assistant Attorney General Leonard of the Civil Rights Division

after Jensen had started his interview with Ray today. Mr. Leonard

indicated he fully agreed that any publicity at this time would be most

undesirable.

Mr. Leonard asked to be informed of developments which

might have a bearing on this matter as it will be necessary to decide,

in the event Ray is not cooperative and there is no possibility of further

getting any cooperation from him, as to whether he should be brought

before a Federal Grand Jury and be questioned under oath concerning

the existence of coconspirators.

ACTION TO BE TAKEN: In accordance with the Director's instructions,

the resuits of the interview of subject Ray by SAC Jensen will be furnished

tó the Director before any further action is taken to disseminate such .

information to the Department. "It is noted that Leonard indicated he was in

close touch with the Attorney General in this matter and is anxious to know

of developments. The information will therefore not be furnished to

• Mr. Leonard until it receives the Director's approval.

GALT was very ill at ease in crowds and gave

her the impression that he prefers to be either alone or

with no more than one other individual.. He was an

introvert and was very hard to converse with.

She stated

that in the approximate two months that she knew him,

only towards the last did he feel confident enough with

her that he would joke with her.

She stated that toward

the end he showed somewhat of a humor, which she believed

very few people knew he had.

He was always ill at ease

around others and could not relax while in conversation

with any other indiviaual. He always fidgeted, pulled at

his ears, played

with his

hands, and looked in every

direction but at

the person with whom he was conversing.

She stated that he smiled with a one-sided smile and that

he smiled very infrequently.

He would never talk about himself, but in general

conversations she was led to believe that he came to los

Angeles from Mexico, possibly around lexico City. He told

her that he was unemployed; was a former merchant seaman;

ROADS stated that she was of the opinion that

GALT entertained the thought of asking her for a date on

many occasions, but his backwardness prevented him irom

actually doing so. During the dancing lessons he always

centered his conversations around dancing techniques and

never talked in general terms about himselí. She believes

he was a Southerner, and she recalled that possibly the

first or second week during. January 1968, he did not attend

dancing instruction, and upon his

return, stated that he had

visited a brother in the State of Louisiana.

RHOADS stated

changed residences twice in Hollywood, Califoria.

at no time associated with GALT socially.

She was not

acquaintea with any of his associates, and through

conversations, GALI told her that he had no particular

"hobby.

She stated that GALT seemed to compensate for

his social inaptness by his attire and placing his

schedule on precise projects which he was participating in.

As an examole, she stated that GALI took dancing

lessons she believed to overcome some of his shyness.

pursued the dancing lessons quite vigorously, doubling up

on the number of lessons normally taught per week so as to

take the maximum number of lessons in the shortest possible

time.,

He abruptly quit dancing, telling her that he had

enrolled in bartending school and was having a conflict in

his schedule.

RHOADS was of the opinion that he had toyed with

his dancing lessons sufficiently to satisfy himself and

was

"running off on another tangent."

She also stated

that GALI was not sufficiently busy she believed

to have not

pursued both courses,

because GALT told her that he slept

rather late, had lunch, took a nap in the early alternoon,

went to bartending school in the late afternoon, and would

then attend dancing lessons in the early evening.

This,

he explained to her, was his typical day, which was not

busy, productive, or strenuous one in her

. mina.

She stated that GALT was very slow in his mental

processes.

He often did not understand jokes and did not

react favorably to a friendly gesture extended to him.

RHOADS stated that during one conversation with GALT she•

made mention that it was odd that he did not wear any

jewelry, that is ring or watch, since he was so well dressed

otherwise. GALT replied that he detested jewelry Of any sort,

and to her knowledge, she never saw him wear a watch, ring,

or curf links, or any other items of jewelry.

RHOADS could remember nothing else of the

mannerisms, backgrouna,

of GALT.

was a white male, weighing about 165 pounds.

She stated that GAIT

She stated

that he had brown hair; was in his middle 30s; had a medium

complexion, and spoke with a southern accent.

"On Friday,

March 29, 1958, sometime

in the early afternoon I had just returned from

lunch when I observed Mir. U.

I. BAKER,

also a

salesman, completing the sale of a rifle to an

individual unknown to me.

MI. BAKER had just

sold this man a Remington, Model 700, Caliber

mounted thereon.. Mr. BAKER had made this sale

and had also mounted and bore sighted the scope

on our machine. This individual also bought one

box 01 20 rounds of .243 Norma ammunition,

payed cash for this sale. Then I first observed

nan he was dressed in a dark business suit

with a white shirt and tie, as well as I remember.

He was approximately 5'g" tall, 150 to 160 pounds

and had dark hair.

He had a medium complexion and

appeared to be a

meek individual.

This individuas

had given his name as HARVEY LONHEYER and stated

that he resided at 1907 South Ilth Street,

• Birmingham, Alabama. He also advised that he was

36 years of age.

"This information was not given to me

personally by this individual, but I determined it

from the bill of sale that was prepared by

HI. BAKER.

"Following the sale this individual left

the store carrying the gun in a cardboard box

utilized by the Browning Manulacturing Company.

This box was used because with the scope mounted

the rifle would not fit in the normal Remington ber.

He also took the empty Remington manufacturer's

carton with him when he left.

"It was, as best I recall, either later

that afternoon or

early the following Saturday

morning when this individual called on the tele-

phone and stated that he had

had a conversation

with his brother and decided that the gun be bad

purchased was not the gun he wanted and he requested

whether he could exchange it for a Remington, Model

760, 30.06 caliber.

I advised him that we coul

make this exchange but that it would cost him an

additional $5.00.

Although he gave his birthdate as March 10, 1928, on the occasion

of their first appointment, RAY impressed the doctor as being "young

and immature."

In consultations subsequent to their first meeting, the doctor

stated he felt that he and RAY developed a good

•rapporT. RAY repeated

his request that he wanted to overcome his shyness,

and gain social

•confidence so that he would ba able to talkto people.

He was usually

placid, cooperative, easily led in conversations, and did not fight

against the doctor as some of his clients do.

During either the second

or thira visit, the doctor asked RaY if he had any "deep dark secrets

or any sexual problems or aberations.

He said that RAY answered in

the negative, and gave him no reason to doubt his answer.

RAT Indicated he had read a loi of books on hypnosis. According

to Dr. FREDIAN,

"Ray hadthe old power idea of hynotism.

That is that

you can so around looking people in the eye and can hyonotise them and

make them do what you want them to."

In subsequent appointments,

down on a couch in his office, and stare at a little spiral on the

ceiling. Then the doctor would talk to him..

Ha was a very apt subject

for. hypnosis.

Very eager,

and very cooperative. He was an excallent

hypnotic subject. He was likeable, and polite.

He was making progress

The doctor nad no recollection ofany particular habits or hobbies

that RAY might have had. He dia not recall any scars or peculiar

physical characteristics that made any special. impression

on him with

regard to RAY. He had no recollection of any discussions regarding

sports, although their visits were during the height of the football

and the start

of the basketball season. He was neat, and to

the best of the doctor's recollection, usually more a suit coat, without

a tie.

two photographs of unle tall (with eyes open and eyes closed)

of his patient, JAMES E. RAY.

The doctor pointed out in his professional aypointment book, entries

that he would be unable to come to the office for the appointment as

he had received information from his brotner, that the latter nad

"found

a job for him in the Merchant Marine in New Orleans, Louisiana."

The doctor is not sure of the date or time that RAY teleyhone to

cancel this last appointment; but feels sure that it was sometime

after their 10:00 a.m. appointment on December 14, 1968.

Dr. FRISMAN saidthat RAY paid in cash, $25.00 per visit.

he has the recollection

Except

that RAY sent him a money order (he believes it

was a postal money order) for the final $25.00 payment.

Concerning his own personal history background and professional

trainings Dr. FREEMAN advised he had his college training at the

University of Illinois (there he 'had a minor in Zoology), the University

of zurich, and graduate study at the University of Southern California.

He said he was an agent in the Army's counter-intelligence

in Burone; he has travelled in Japan.

His office is located at 9952

The doctor said that many of his

patients cone to him a referral from Mr. MELVIN POWERS of the wilshire

Book Company on the Sunset Strip in Hollywood, California;

which he

discribed as a publishing house that publishes numerous titles in the

field of self-hypnosis.

The docior concluded by stating that JAMES I. RAY came to him

seeking psychological hely in the nature of self-hypnosis to gain

confidence, overcome shyness, learn to sleep better, and to be able

to talk to

people. Following each session, he was instricted to go

home and practice the methods of relaxation they had gone over in

the office.

He was shy, introverted, and withdrawn,

but not psychotic

or plagued with any deep

seated neuroses. Although he indicated he

was unemployed, he never seemed to lack money to pay in cash for his

consultations during the period of their appointments.

when he

called to cancel their last appointment, he indicated he was

going

to Hew Orleans to accept a position his brother had obtained for him;

but he told the doctor he hoped they would meet again sometime.

This incarceration

in connection with a holdup of

the kroger store in October va

november, 1966, by his brother and a man named OWENS.

After JAMES EARL RAY's trial about April, 1950, he was

moved to the Missouri state penitentiary at jefferson City, Missouri.

From that time and until prior to his escape he visited his brother

on occasion, exact number of occasions. not recalled.

He does recall

that on at least one occasion on attempting to visit his brother,

determined that his brother was in some type of solitary confine-

icent and could not have visitors.

Therefore, although he had signed

in to visit his brother, he actually did not see his brother. JOHN

MARRY RAY pointed out that this may be the reason for the numerous

visits shown to the Penitentiary by him, all of which he does not

recall.

JOHN LARRY RAY stated that he has not seen nor heard oi

his brother or from his brother since his escape from the Penitentiary

outside of what he has learned from newspaper articles and news

cormentaries:

He very emphatically denied having any knowledge, either

_direct or indirect, of his brother ever being in Omaha, Nebraska.

He stated that his

knowledge of his brother being in California

is linited to what was reported in the newspaper.

When questioned regarding conversation between him and

his brother on visits, JOHN LARRY RAY stated that he rarely visited

his brother over a half hour because they had very little to say

to one another. He indicated that his brother is "close mouthed"

sad the conversation consisted primarily of the welfare of. JAMES

EARL, RAY.

On one or more occasions he does recall, however,

that

JANES EARL RAY mentioned that as soon as he got out of the Penitentiary

(not clarified as to whether he intended to escape or whether he

meant

after his sentence

was served) he intended to leave the country.

denied that this took place.

He stated he would still help

any way, however, he feels he would tell the interviewing

Agent about it after it happened.

With regard to JOIN GAVRON, he stated that his

because OWENS pleaded guilty and got a lighter sentence than

JIM.

On viewing the Identification Order photographs,

JOHN RAY stated that the photograph with the crew cut looks

more like his brother, rist, to him, however, he noted this

that location at which time he supplied

the following infor-

mation:

RAY identified a photograph of JAMES DAVID DAILEY

as a person known to him only as

"J.D." who at one time operated

a tavern on Morrison Street in st. Louis and with whom RAI

got involved in a fist fight with sometime in 1960.

RAY is

of the opinion that although he knows

"J.D." by sight he does

not believe that DAILEY knows him.

RAY was unable to provide

any information whether his brother, JAMES EARL RAY, and DAILEY

have ever known each other.

RAY was questioned regarding his stay at the Mac

Arthur Hotel in St. Louis at which time he readily stated

•that approximately two or three months ago he spent a night.

at the MacArthur Hotel with the night barmaid of the Grape-

vine Inn, NAOMI REGAZZI (phonetic). According to RAY he regis-

tered as

Mr. and Mrs. JOHN RAY and provided a fictitious address.

He was questioned regarding the address 1886 Wyoming at. which

time he stated it is entirely possible that he used that address

when registering, however, it does not have any particular

significance to him.

RAY stated that in the early fall of 1967, his father,

JERRY RAYNES, had sold a house on Park Avenue in St. Louis and

gave to Ray $1000 to hold for him.

RAY indicated that he had

saved approximately $3000 from various employments and indicated

that on many occasions carried this cash on his person: and..

stated that even to this date it is not unusual for him to

carry $500 or $600 on him. RAY denied any of the money saved

by him had been obtained in an unlawful manner. RAY supported

this statement by saying that in the operation of the Grape-

vine Tavern it is necessary to have an abundance of cash for

various bills and he also pays the employees at the tavern

in cash.

RAY stated that in early August of 1967, he had

decided to drive to San Francisco, California, in an attempt

to invest the money he had at that time in a bar or other:

profitable business. He indicated that he drove alone to

business opened and while on the return trip to St. Louis

he decided to travel to Tijuana,

Mexico.

He related that

he had

heard of the numerous dishonest people and thieves

in Mexico so while traveling through an unnamed town in Wyoming

he purchased $750 worth of travelers' checks. RAY stated

that he then drove to Tijuana and after his arrival there

stated it was extremely difficult for him to understand the

language, that he did not like the place, and within two

hours after his arrival departed en route to St. Louis, Mis-

souri.

time following JAMES' escape from the Missouri State Peniten-

tiary.

He stated he never knew that JAMeS RAY was in California,

him.

RAY added that upon his arrival in St. Louis during

the last

week of August, 1967, he opened bank accounts at

the Manufacturers Bank and also the Jefferson-Gravois Bank.

He indicated that both accounts were opened as the combined

business hours of both banks were suitable to his own hours.

RAY stated that deposits to open these accounts were made

with the remaining cash he had on hand and the travelers'

checks which he purchased in Wyoming.

RAY was questioned regarding the financial status

of his brother, JAMES RAY, while he was in the Missouri State

Penitentiary and RAY stated that he had no idea as. to how

money JAMES had, however, he reiterated the previous

recollection of statements made by JAMES during visits to

the Missouri State Penitentiary. that if

he got out of the

penitentiary he would leave the country. • JOHN RAY stated

that he assumed that his brother would have had sufficient

money to do just that. He denied any knowledge of sources

of income for his brother but he again assumed that. if his

brother was involved in the sale of amphetamine or in the.

Joan business while in the penitentiary he would then presumably

have made some money.

RAY denied any knowledge or informa-

tion that anyone outside the penitentiary owed money to his

brother or was hading money for him.

talk to reporters, however, this particular reporter showed

hin a story allegedly to be put on AP by the Los Angeles

According

¿o RAY, this article indicated thathe hated his brother, had

no close family ties, and was hiding out, all of which he

indicated was untruthful.

the reporter rould put it in a more favorable light and the

result rould be a refuting of these lies.

He advised this newspaper reporter that his sister,

name he could not recall, but whose name he would attempt to

locate through records who he went to work for on a day to day

basis on a number of occasions..

He stated this individual

usually a painting truck parked.

He stated this individual

returned from the Colorado area and usually did small house

painting jobs.

After delivering JOHN RAY to a given job

on a given day, he would then leave supposedly to make other

estimates on other jobs, therefore, JOHN LARRY RAY had 11ttle

personal contact with him.

JOHN LARRY RAY stated that he would

attempt to locate any records that would show his employment

during the year of 1967.

Afier considerable thought he advised that he was

of the opinion that during April or May, 1967, he was pro-

bably residing on the second floor at 1822 North 2lst Street,

He indicated that he had also been hiding from reporters but would

not reveal the location where he had taken refuge.

RAY indicated he had opened this bar this date for business

as usual and Naomi RiGaull is currently working as barmaid for him.

JOHN RAY stated there was no truth in regards to newspaper accounts

She has since lived by herself and not at her

"parental" home because Mr, and Mrs, OLSEN are "fed up"

and did not approve of her chasing around, staying out late,

etc.

Hir, and Mrs. OLSEN had become attached to the baby,

and visited GJERDIS and the baby a few times at Northbrook,

at the place on Techny Road. OLSEN Saw JERRY RAY a few

of those times but did not like him because once OLSEN

got stuck in the snow right outside the Techny address, and

JERRY would not "even bother to help push" him out. OLSEN

never net any relatives of JERRY RAY and first knew that

JERRY had a brother, JAMES RAY, when he read it in the

nenspapers a few weeks ago.. GJERDIS never mentioned baving

met JAMES, and OLSEN was unaware of a visit by one of the

RAY brothers to the Techny Road address.

He recalled that

shortly alter they were married, dunny

RAY and GUERDIS went

to Missouri to see JERRY's relatives with the intention:

of living there but he heard no more about this.

OLSEN concluded that he feels there is something

wrong nentally with GIERDIS, who just moved from lake Forest

to a motel in Des Plaines and who is working as a waitress

at the Kopper Kettle, Highland Park.

Mrs. OLSEN works as

a babysitter at the J. D. SIMMONS residence, B2724 Birchwood

Lane, Highland Park, phone 945-5029.

Interviewed separately May 7, 1968, at B2724 Birchwood

Lane, NIS. PAUL OLSEN verified generally what her husband .

had said and added that. GIERDIS is highly nervous and emotional,

takes pills and is under doctor's care, principally because :

of the strain of having placed her baby out for adoption

last summer in

an attempt to preserve her marriage with

JERRY RAY.

She said GJERDIS, who was born April 12, 1948,

married JERRY RAY 1n Chicago

first lived at Arlington Heights before moving to 2897 Techny

Road, Northbrook.

Before GJERDIS and JERRY were separated

1n the fall of 1967, Mrs. OLSEN visited them about three

Itmes, but at no time saw any of JERRY's relatives. When the

papers related, much to her surprise, a few weeks ago that.

JAMES RAY and

JERRY RAY were brothers, she recalled the following

two incidents, the dates of which she could not precisely.

place:

The first was GJERDIS' relating to her about the

I trip she and JERRY-took to St. Louis where JERRY visited a

brother and his lather who lived near there. GIERDIS told

of "waiting in a theater" for JERRY while he went with his

ter" for

brother on some sort of mission.

after the marriage, probably in the early spring of 1987,

which Mrs. OLSEN related to a time when GJERDIS had just

quit working for Culligan's in Arlington or Northbrook.

The other incident concerned a phone call GUERDIS

made to Hrs. OLSEN from Northbrook, 'in which she said'

that

"something funny" was going on because she, GJERDIS, had

discovered some strange clothes leit in the garage by

JERRY's brother from St. Louis; further,

that this brother

had taken JERRY's car and left.

GUERDIS told Mrs. OLSEN

that she "just don't understand" and that she had not

really seen the brother.

then the publicity about dames band Ray came out,

sIS. OLSEN and GUERDIS tried to set the time oi the loregoing

car incident and figured that it must have been April, 1967,

because "he (JANES RAY) didn't escape until late in April"

and they chose to assume that it was brother JAMES who

was there at the time.

Mrs. OLSEN concluded that she is certain that ..

GERDIS has never in her life seen JAMES EARL RAY from what

she has told and indicated to her (Mrs. OLSEN). She

cautioned that GJERDIS' mind would "wander" when agents.

talked with her and she would not be able to recall specific

dates and places.

It is noted that Mrs. OLSEN as well as her husband

pledged complete cooperation and said they would immediately

contact the FBI should they hear or learn any information

re subject.

"GJERDIS DOROTHEA ANNA OLSEN (she has again assumed

her maiden name), date of birth April 12, 1948, at St. Paul,

Minnesota, who would freguently go off on unexplained

tangents in response to questions, was interviewed outside

her place of employment, kopper kettle, Routes 41 and k2g

Highland Park.

She said she had been

"expecting" agents,

that she really had no "good" information, but that she

would cooperate in any way. She advised as follows:

Since Hay 4, 1968, she has beenresiding at Randel's

notes, Apartment 12, Des Plaines, but intends to move in the

near luture to Haukegan. She drives a 1962 Plymouth with

1968 1111n0is license HK 6917. She married WILLIAM STREET,

dundelein, Illinois, August 31, 1966, and gave birth to his

baby October 13, 1966.

She divorced

him in Chicago in about

i...

January, 1957, after having net JERRY RAY who was working

at Sportsmans.

In about Christmas, 1966, she and JERRY

went to st. Louis and visited his lather

and his sister,.

MELBA, and

her husband. There was another man there, probably

& brother, but she never heard his name.

She first knew

a brother,

JOHN, when in early 1967, at the Techny Road

address, she happened to see a clipping in which it was

mentioned that JOHN RAY was in some kind of trouble.

She

never talked to JerRy about this, however, and she never knew

there was a JANES RAY until after it "came out in the

papers."

She has seen numerous pictures of JAMES RAY SiNCE

and"is quite sure" she has never seen him before. As to

her waiting in a theater in St. Louis, she responded only

.;.

that she did go to a movie one time rather than go with

JERRY on some sort of errand.

After the publicity about JAMES, she and her mother

recalled the incident wherein a brother from St. Louis, name

unknown to her, came and left some clothes and his car.

This brother was about 45, had dark bair like JERRY, but was

not dales. She and her mother figured it was about April,

196%, when this occurred.

The brother came driving a 1961

red Plymouth tudor,

with white top, and he traded cars with

JERRY, taking JERRY's 1963 or 1964

JERRY said he visited his brother about three

or four times while he was in prison in Jefferson City,

Hissouri, the last time being around 1964.

JAMES came.

tớ

Henard prison to visit JERRY on one occasion.

JERRY again

stated that the last time he saw his brother JAMES outside

of prison was in 1951 in Quincy, Illinois, and JERRY was

fifteen years old at that time.

The father was still

living with his mother then.

He said that he belleves that WALTER TERRY RIFE and i

JAMES went to Leavenworth together but that LONNIE RIFE

never did time with JAMES. He said that if he had given

the Impression that LONNIE did do time with JAMES in the

previous interviews, this was in error.

JERRY again stated

that he himself has

done time in Menard, Illinois, with

both RIFE brothers.

He stated that he has no idea as to the presént

whereabouts of "BLACKIE" AUSTIN and doubts if his brother

has maintained contact with AUSTIN nor would be in contact

with him since his escape. He said that of all of the

persons that he knows of, JAMES was the friendliest and

=...

closest with AUSTIN. JERRY pointed out, however, that his

knowledge of this is limited since JERRY was in prison

when both AUSTIN and his brother were on the street.

He

does know that"BLACKIE" liked his brother and has always

talked about bim..

In clarification, JERRY advised that his brother

JOHN first came to Chicago sometime around July, 1960, and

he, denit, came to this area around september, 1960.

JOHN

first worked at murphy's steak House,

He also worked at

the White Pines Country Club and JOHN's last employment ir

the Chicago area was the Indian Hills Country Club, Bloomingdale

Illinois.

JERRY advised that he was employed with

his

brothers JOHN and FRANK at the Rolling Green Country Club

beginning in September, 1960 and JERRY stayed there for

about sixteen months. and JOHN for eight or nine months.

"" He nas uncertain to

time prior to his death in September, 1963.

JERRY advised that sometime during June or

July, 1967, when he was living at 2897 Techny Road, Northbrook,

Illinois,

JOHN drove here in a 1961 Plymouth which

he had

bought from the father, JERRY RAYNas. At this time, JERRY

owned a 1962 air-conditioned Rambler. JOHN was having

"-?

trouble with the transmission in the Plymouth and they

switched cars.

He does recall that JOHN transferred some

clothes and other items from the Plymouth to the Rambler.

Also, that JOHN left some old shirts and pants and some

other papers in the garage at Techny Road and JERRY hid

these items above the rafters in the garage. He said that

JOHN stayed a couple of days and was

in either an apartment

or a hotel in Chicago and did not reside at JERRY's residence

while here. JOHN left with the Rambler and both cars are

presently at bis father's farm in Center, Missouri. JERRY

said that his wife did not meet JOHN on this occasion but

did meet him at Christnas time, 1967, when JERRY and his:

wife went to St. Louis where they had dinner at CAROL

• .:

PEPPER's house and JOHN was present.

JERRY advised that

JOHN did not know how to find his residence in Northbrook,

Illinois, and that he, JERRY, met him in the town of

....

Northbrook and then JOHN followed him to the residence..

JERRY also advised that his brother JAMes did not ever know

that JERRY resided at this address in Northbrook.

"=.

In previous interviews, JERRY advised that he :.

borrowed somewhere between $40 and $50 from his brother

JAMES While JANES was in prison. He reiterated that state r

ment in this interview at which time the financial trans-

actions fron his brother's account at the Inmates Bank'':::

Hissourt State Penitentiary, Jefferson City, Missourt, were

discussed with JERRY. It was pointed out to him that this

list shows that his brother had sent him $266.25. JERRY

advised that this must be an error since the only amount

he recognized was $55.25 which was sent to him on June 22,

1964. He stated that at this time, he, JERRY, was in

St. Louis, Missouri, and needed more y to return to Chicago

to obtain

employnent. He wrote to his brother requesting

this loan and was in the process of paying JAMES back when

shits escaped.

JERRY suggested that the money listed to

him was instead paid to his brother's attorney, name unknown

In Jefferson City, Missouri. JERRY advised that be himself

did not receive money from his brother to be sent to the

attorney or anyone else.

JERRY advised that this attorney

had been hired by his brother to handle his appeal and that

he believed the attorney did visit with JAMES while JAMes

was in prison. JERRY said that his brother never mentioned

anything concerning Benzedrine inhalers or any type of

"bennies" or dope.

JAMES never mentioned being involved

1n any illegal drug selling while in prison nor did he.

ever mention

that he was involved in any type of racket

with a guard. He also never mentioned any guard that be

was particularly friendly with and in fact, made no comment

whatsoever concerning the prison officials

that JERry can

remember.

JERRY also advised that his brother never

mentioned reading any of the James Bond novels and in "

fact, JERRY did not believe his brother was much of a

"reader." The only location that he can recall his brother

making a comment as to how much he liked it was tijuana,

Mexico, and he believes his brother was there sometime in

1951.

The brother made no mention to him at anytime as

to the identity of any persons with whom he was acquainted

in lexico.

JERRY advised that when he left Chicago on this .

latter occasion, he stayed with his brother JOHN for two

nights, with his father one night, with his sister CAROL

one night, at the St. Regis Hotel one night and at the

Hac Arthur Hotel one night. In conversations with his

brother JOHN and sister CAROL, they both stated that they

belteve, fron newspaper stories, that the subject is the

victim of a frame-up or being used as the "fall guy." He

also stated that CAROL is concerned over the newspaper

articles speculating that the subject is dead and she has

that opinion. He said that JOHN told him that some people

came to the tavern at the time of the KING funeral request-

¿ing him to close down for that day which he did not do.

CG 44-1114

JOHN also said that 11 he himself receives any publicity;

he will close down the tavern and leave because he feels

that people will throw firebombs in his place.

GERRY

related that one of the newspaper reporters located and

Interviewed a woman named RUBY who works for his brother

since JOHN had used that woman's address about three or

four years ago. RUBY told the newspaper people that she

did not know the whereabouts of JOHN.

JERRY also said that

In conversations with JOHN, JOHN told him that the subject

would be "crazy" to give himself up because even if he

is not guilty of the kinG murder, he still would have .

eighteen years to do in the penitentiary at Jefferson City.

JERRY explained this by stating that his brother bas

thirteen years leit on his previous sentence and that

he would get at least an extra five jears for the escape. :

JERRY again speculated that 1f his brother

was KING's murderer, he would have had to have been paid

because he could not see how his brother would have obtained

enough money to purchase the 1966 Mustang, take the trips

he was supposed to have taken and to pay $150 for the

telescope used in the murder.

He said that there was just

too much money coming in and in response to a direct ques-

tion, he said that he did not think his brother would have

been able to steal this much money because he would have had

"slipped up and been caught." He explained that in his

opinion, his brother was not an accomplished thief and that

most of

his previous scores were "small time."

JERRY advised that he is presently residing in

Apartment 14, 314 Wisconsin Avenue, Lake Forest, Illinois,

which rooming house was recommended to the Sportsman's

Country Club by WAYNE CLANDENEN (phonetic).

JERRY noted

that his ex-wife DJERDIS also used to reside at this rooming

house. He said that he is not listed as a tenant and that

the rent of $60 per month is being paid by the country club.

He advised that there is no phone at the building with the

nearest one four blocks away.

He said that he plans to

continue his employment at the Sportsman's Country Club

and will contact SA RENE J. DUMAINE on a daily basis.

He advised that his ex-wife presently works at

a restaurant near the expressway and is living in a motel

In Wheeling, Illinois. He went on to say that yesterday

there was a knock on the door of his apartment and when

he opened it, his ex-wife was there. She said that she

had found him by inquiring of the rooming house manager,

the room numbers of the last two tenants and then came to

talk with him.

he said that they talked of personal matters

with nothing of interest in this case. JERRY advised that

be may have to move from this address since his ex-wife

night inadvertently give out his whereabouts. He said

he was not concerned with the problem of people making that

threats against his safety because of what his brother did

but that he was most concerned of the people who would

attempt to harm him without making threats. In explanation,

he made the comment,

"Like that guy who shot king, he

FBI Office, was requested to furnish his fingerprints,

He was also

requested to pose for photographs.

He complied with both

Based on information furnished by the St. Louis

Division, JERRY was requestioned concerning the discrepancy

as to the identity of his father and present whereabouts.

He advised that JERRY RAYNES, Center,

Missouri, was not his

father and reiterated that his father

waS JAMES GERALD RAY,

who died in 1951 at Hannibal, Missouri.

He said that the

information concerning his relatives and parents is correct

to the best of his knowledge because it was told to him by

his mother. He said that he is unaware of where CAROL PEPPER

might have

obtained her information since she left the

mother's home in about 1956 when she was 15 years old.

He

then stated that prior to his father's death in 1951, he was

employed. by. the railroad (identity unknown), and worked on a

farm in the vicinity of Hannibal, Missouri.

He further related that all of the children left

home upon reaching the age of 15 or 16 and there was very

little family contact thereafter. When the parents separated

in 1949, all of the younger children who were then at home went

with the mother.

In response to a question as to the reason for his

brother's commission of the murder of KING, JERRY advised that

he was unable to furnish any reason.: He went on to say that

during the three or four time that he has talked with his

brother in the last 15 or 15 years, JAMES never expressed

any particular outward dislike for

members of the Negro race.

But JERRY did have the feeling that the subject was not

particularly fond of Negroes.

feels that he would cooperate with

the FBI in

this matter but that it would take considerable thought

on his part to turn his brother in.

if he was telephonically contacted by his brother, he would not

• talk to him but would hang up.

JERRY was asked how his brother

would know his phone number if he was not aware of his residence

and employment.

JERRY said that he has no reason to believe

that his brother is aware of his phone number; that he never gave

it to him and made the foregoing statement about a phone call

merely as a matter of conjecture.

box for the specific use of

his brother since he did not

want mail from the penitentiary

coming to the country club.

'JERRY related that JOHN came to this area sometime

around 1964 and stayed for about 21 years.

To the best of

JERRY's recollection, JOHN first worked at Murpny's

Steakhouse,

then went

to the Rolling Green Country Club.

and from there to the

White Pines Country Club where he

was employed as à pot

washer..

JOHN then went to bartending

school in Chicago

and

went to work for the Indian Hills

Country Club ia Itasca, Illinois. JERRY is of the opinion

that his brother, JOHN,

uses the

hame RYAN.

JERRY said

that on April 20 or 21, 1968, he.

telephonically contacted his sister, CAROL PEPPER, and

explained

that the uncooperative attitude of both CAROL and

JOHN arose from the harassment of the newspaper reporters

in the neighborhood

and that both were afraid of unfavorable

publicity which would adversely effect the tavern business

causing

them to sell. out and move.

Fle

said that his

sister, CAROL, has told him that she feels that she now has

to move from the particular neighborhood where she resides

in St.. Louis, Missouri.

CAROL has commented to him that

the picture in the newspaper of JAMES RAY does look something

like him.

JERRY said that he agrees with this but that felt:

it could not be his brother because he read in the newspapers

that the person sought by the FBI for the KING murder had

attended dancing school in New Crleans, Louisiana, in 1964

and 1965, but since his brother was imprisoned during these

years, he knew it could not be him.

Concerning his trip

to St.

Louis,

February. 1968, JERRY advised that he stayed at the MarArthur

Fotel for one night; he believes

1963.

the date: to be February. 2,

and that his brother. Jov;

either stayed in an

apartment over the tavern or

nearby, but not

he has.

at this family. reunion at this last or any other time.

JERRY advised that he owns two automobiles, one

• a 1960 light green four-door De Soto which presently is

parked in front of the cottage at the Sportsman's Country

club.

The other, a 1961 two door white over red Plymouth.

Both of these cars were purchased from a stepfather, JERRY

RAYNES; who resides on a farm in Center, Missouri:

exhibited a receipt from the Dunhurst Currency Exchange

showing that Missouri driver's license 8250-6227-822-98-473M0,

plus title and registration for 1960 De Soto had "been turned

•The receipt was in the name .of JERRY WILLIAM RYAN,

2897 Techny Road:

JERRY said that he had turned

over

these items April 24, 1968, and expected to obtain his

Illinois driver's license and license tags within the next

several days.

JERRY further related that he paid $200 for the.

1961 Plymouth and has owned it for

about six months.

• The

car is presently at his stepfather's farm and is not

registered.

The reason it is not registered is that

the

title to this car

was filed by his stepfather in St. Louis,

Missouri, but. was

not returned.

Both he and his stepfather

made inquiry concerning the fitie, but it was evidently

lost.

JERRY said that he has driven the. car to Chicago and

RAY left

one or two months and continued his employment as a dishwasher.

He eventually became night maintenance man at the club and

has always in this capacity performed his work in a capable

manner and was honest in every respect; however, she is of.

the opinion that RAY has a low mental capacity.

RAY at no time has ever visited her home at the

RAY since he

left the Sportsman Country Club on April 23, 1968, which is

his day off, until the present

time.

RAY has spoken of a brother who she believes is

St. Louis, Missouri area; however, 'he never provided

any additional information concerning this brother other than

the fact that he was a bartender.

RAY also had a child during

his marriage to GIRDIS RAY, nee OLSEN, a former waitress

at the country club; however, GIRDIS was pregnant by a former

husband whose last name she remembers as STRIET (phonetic)

and the baby was born shortly after RAY's. marriage to GIRDIS

nee. OLSEN.

To the best of her recollection, GIRDIS RAY

no longer has this baby turning it over to a wellare agency

children; however, she knows nothing further concerning these

children

RAY has no close friends at the club; however, in

the past has filled in for other employees of the club

in addition to his own duties when the employees wanted time

off and needed someone to work in their place.

He at no time

spoke of other members of his family other than to say that

he had a brother that was a bartender in the St. louis area

and she had no idea that RAY was incarcerated in the past.

Her records revealed that RAY worked steadily during the

having any time off.

She is of the opinion that RAY is not cooperating

with the FBI in every respect, does not feel that some of the

questions asked of him are important enough for him

to give

any thought in answering; however; it could be that duè to

his low mental condition that he is not capable of answering

Urs. ALBERT (CAROL) PEPPER, 2025 Bellevue,

Haplewood, Missouri, advised that she had received no

additional information whatever bearing on the possible-

location of her brother, JAMES EARI, RAY, since she was last

intervieved.

Inquiry was sade of Mrs. PEPPER as to whether, in

the event she should receive some pertinent information

regarding her brother, she would furnish such information to

the Federal Bureau of

Investigation. (FBI).

HIS. PEPPER

then stated that she mould have no expectations whatever that

her

brother would communicate with her in any way, pointing

out that he did not know her current address or her current

unpublished telephone-number.

She added that she felt that

he did not believe that he could expect any help from her and she

said that, as a matter of fact, she rould not be at all

interested or willing to help him as she did not want herself

and particularly her children to be in any way involved with

him.

She said that if she should hear from RAY and be convinced

of his innocence she might find it difficult to furnish such

information to the FBI. It nas pointed out to Mrs. PEPPER that

In the event RAY should be innocent or there should be any .

extenuating circumstances the entire matter would in any event

be most readily resolved through locating RAY at the earliest

possible time.

KIS. PEPPER expressed understanding and agree-

ment with this idea.

Inquiry was made of Nis. PEFPER as to her whereabouts

and activities during the period beireen April and July 1101.

that she missed only one day from work during the entire

Penitentiary was when she heard or read news reports regarding

the escape but she is unable to recall the approximate time

she, heard such reports.

However, since reported identification

of RAY as the alleged assassin of MARTIN LUTHER KING, MrS.

PEPPER has heard or read reports to the effect that his

escape from the penitentiary was not officially. reported or

given publicity for perhays several weeks after the escape

was contacted at her residence, whereupon she advised that she

relationship but rather a teacher-parent relationship..

She

said that she was an

instructor at the St. Joseph Church on

Twelfth and Russell Streets, St. Louis, and enrolled. in the

project "Headstart" government program, and the program required

at least one parent of one of the children attending the program

to be present. She said CAROL was the parent present at this

program.

SUTTON advised that she did not know where. CAROL waS

presently residing with her husband ALBERT and two sons,

ALBERI, JRi, and JAMES, ages 6 and 4 respectively.

SUTTON stated that she did not know any of CAROLS'

brothers or sisters and did not know if she even had any.

She stated that she last saw CAROL sometime in August

of last year, and the only thing she could remember about any

type of conversation about her family was something to the

effect that her father was going to buy or did buy a farm up

around Hannibal, Missouri, and that he probably would let her

children go to the fari.

She said that it was probably in

who were then in Jefferson City, Missourt, prison with

JAMES.

t :

JERRY said he visited his brother about three

or four times while he was in prison in Jefferson City,

Missours, the last time being around 1964.

JAMES came

Henard prison to visit JERRY on one occasion.

JERRY again

stated that the last time he saw his brother

JAVES outside

of prison was in 1951 in Quincy, Illinois, and JERRY was

fifteen years old at that time. The father was still

Ilving with his mother then.

He said that he believes that WALTER TERRY RIFE and

JAMES went to Leavenworth together but that LONNIE RIFE

never did time with JAMes, He said that 1f he had given

Tate on:

the impression that LONNIE did do time with JAMES in the

previous interviews, this was in error.

JERRY again stated

that he himself has

done time in lenard, Illinois, with

both RIfE brothers.

He stated that he has no idea as to the present

whereabouts of "BLACKIE" AUSTIN and doubts if his brother

has maintained contact with AUSTIN nor would be in contact

with him since his escape. He said that of all of the

persons that he knows of, JAMES was the friendliest and

closest with AUSTIN. JERRY pointed out, however, that his

Sis, y pointed out

knowledge of this is limited since JERRY was in prison

when both AUSTIN and his brother were on the street.

He

does know that"BLACKIE" liked his brother and has always

talked about him.

In clarification, JERRY advised that his brother

JOHN first came

to Chicago

sometime around July, 1960, and

he, JERRY, came to this area around September,

1960.

JOHN

first worked at

Murphy's Steak House,

of time prior to his death in September, 1963.

JERRY advised that sometime during June or

July, 1967, when he was living at 2897 Techny Road, Northbrook,

Illinois, JOHN drove here in a 1961 Plymouth which

he had

bought from the father, JERRY RAyNes. At this time, JERRY

owned a 1962 air-conditioned Rambler.

JOHN was having

trouble with the transmission in the Plymouth and they

switched cars.

He does recall that JOHN transferred some

clothes and other items from the Plymouth to the Rambler.

Also, that JOHN left some old shirts and pants and some

other papers in the garage at Techny Road and JERRY hid

these items above the rafters in the garage. He said that

JOHN stayed a couple of days and was

in either an apartment

or a hotel in Chicago and did not reside at JERRY's residence.

while here.

JOHN left with the Rambler and both cars are

presently at his father's farm in Center, Missouri. JERRY

said that his wife did not meet JOHN on this occasion but.

did meet him at Christmas time, 1967, when JERRY and his:

wife went to St. Louis where they had dinner at CAROL:

PEPPER's house and JOHN was present. JERRY advised that

JOHN did not know how to find his residence in Northbrook,

Illinois, and that he, JERRY, met him in the town of

Northbrook and then JOHN followed him to the residence.

JERRY also advised that his brother JAMES did not ever

KnOw

that JERRY resided at this address in Northbrook.

In previous interviews, JERRY advised that he

borrowed somewhere between $40 and $50 from his brother

JAMES While JADES was in prison.

He reiterated that state-

ment in this interview at which

time the financial trans-

actions from his brother's account at the Inmates Bank,::

Missouri State Penitentiary, Jefferson City, Missouri, were

discussed with JERRY.

It was pointed out to him that this

list shows that his brother had sent him $266.25. JERRY

advised that this must be an error since the only amount

he recognized was $55.25 which was sent to him on June 22,

1964. He stated that at this time, he, JERRY, was in

St. Louis, missouri,

and needed more y to return to Chicago

co Obtain employment.

He wrote to his brother requesting

this loan and

was in the process of paying JAMES back. when

escaped. JERRY suggested that the money listed to

him was instead paid to his brother's attorney, name unknown,

In Jefferson City, Missouri.

JERRY advised that he himself

did not receive money from

his brother to be sent to the

attorney or anyone else.

JERRY advised that this attorney

had been hired by his brother to handle his appeal and that

he believed the attorney did visit with JAMeS while JAMes

-*-.

was in prison.

JERRY said that his brother never mentioned

anything concerning Benzedrine inhalers or any type of

"bennies" or dope.

JAMES never mentioned being involved

1n any illegal drug selling while in prison sor did he

ever mention that he was involved in any type of racket

with a guard. He also never mentioned any guard that he

was particularly friendly with and in fact,

made no comment

whatsoever concerning the prison officials that JERRY can

remember.

JERRY also advised that his brother never

mentioned reading any of the James Bond novels and in

fact, JERRY did not believe his brother was much of a

"reader."

The only location that he can recall his brother

making a comment as to how much he liked it was Tijuana,

Mexico, and he believes his brother was there sometime in

1951.

The brother made no mention to him at anytime as

to the identity of any persons with whon he was acquainted

In Mexico.

JERRY advised that when he left Chicago on this •

latter occasion, he stayed with his brother JOHN for two

nights, with his father one night, with his sister CAROL

one night, at the St. Regis Hotel one night and at the

sac Arthur Hotel one night.

In conversations with his

brother JOHN and sister CAROL, they both stated that they

belleve, from nerspaper stories, that the subject is the

victin of a frame-up or being used as the "fall guy."

also stated that CAROL is concerned over the newspaper

articles speculating that the subject is dead and she has

that opinion.

He said that JOHN told him that some people

came to the tavern at the time of the KING funeral request-

Ing him to close down for that day which be did not do.

that people will throw firebombs in his place. defix

Is not guilty of the KING murder, he still would have .

eighteen years to do in the penitentiary at Jeiferson City.

JERRY explained this by stating that his brother has

thirteen years left on his previous sentence and that

he would get at least an extra live jears for the escape.

JERRY again speculated that 1f his brother

was KING's murderer, he would have had to have been paid

because he could not see how his brother would have obtained

enough money to purchase the 1965 Mustang, take the trips

he was supposed to have taken and to pay $150 for the

telescope used in the murder.

too much money coming in and in response to a direct ques-

tion, he said that he did not think his brother would have

been

able to steal this much

money because he would have had

"slipped up and been caught." He explained that in his

opinion, his brother was not an accomplished thief and that

most of

his previous scores were "small time."

JERRY advised that he is presently residing in

Apartment 14, 314 Wisconsin Avenue, Lake Forest, Illinois,.

Which rooming house was recommended to the Sportsman's

Coustry Club by HAYNE CLANDENEN (phonetic).

that his ex-wife DJERDIS also used to reside at this rooming

house.

He said that he is not listed

as a

tenant and that

the rent of $60 per month is being paid by

the country club.

He advised that there is no phone at the building with the

nearest one four blocks away. He said that he plans to

continue his employment at the Sportsman's Country Club

and will contact SA RENE J. DUMAINE On a daily basis.

a restaurant near the expressway and is living in a motel

in Wheeling, Illinois.

He went on to say that yesterday

there was a

knock on the door of his apartment and when

he opened

It, his ex-wife nas. there, She said that she

had found him by inquiring of the rooming house manager,

the room numbers of the last two tenants and then came to

talk with him.

He said that they talked of personal matters

with nothing of interest in this case.

JERRY advised that

he may have to move from this address since his ex-wife

might inadvertently give out his whereabouts.

he was not concerned with the problem of people making that

threats against his safety because of what his brother did

but that he was most concerned of the people who would

attempt to harm him without making threats.

In explanation,

he made the comment, "Like

that guy who shot king, he

did not make any threats."

JERRY advised that he will continue to cooperate

with the Bureau in furnishing information.

Miss FERNAHDEZ remembered that the Subject's

white Mustang had a tire which was badly road-damaged

and he asied for a replacement, size 7.45 x l4. Since

there were none of this size in stock, she said, he took

a size 7.50 x l4 Firestone tire, but requested a discount

since it

was the wrong size..

Miss TERNANDEZ said she

spoke to Hrs. FREGOEO, who was in the upstairs apartment,

and a ten percent discount was authorized.

the said

that, since the tire was slightly larger, and because the

use of tubes is alveys recommended due to the difficult

terrain, the rubject walked to the General Popo itore

and came baci: with a tube which he had purchased himself.

The tire gas nounted outside the store by Mrs. FRIGOLO'S

-

brother.

Miss FERNIIDEZ searched for the sales slip

recording this transaction, but was unable to locate 1t.

the said that the fubject did not give her his name,

and that, since he was not a Mexican, she did not bother

to ask his name or to note the serial number of the tire

on the sales silp, since this is only done for guaranty

purposes. (C

Continuing, MiSS FREGOO said she lives near

the Casa susana and, efter she sold the tire, she

remembered seeing the same white Mustang parked on

Calle 31 de Cctubre around the corner from the Casa

Lusana.

The car was parked in front of a vacant lot

and she thought this strange since she saw it there

about 8 in the morning on several occasions while she

was walking to mori. On one occasion as she was on her

way to lunch, the say the subject pari his car anc

MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR

REVEREND YOUNG AND REVEREND ABERNATHY

VISIT TO FBI HEADQUARTERS, JANUARY 11, 1965

Brigin

In my memorandum of January 8th, it was pointed out that Reverend

Young wanted to come to Washington today together with Reverend Abernathy and see --

Mr. Hoover if possible. It was recommended and approved that the Director's regrets

be expressed and Leinbaugh and I saw these men at 2 p.m., today.

Both Reverend Young and Reverend Abernathy seemed to be highly

(uncomfortable during the interview. Reverend Abernathy started out as the spokesman

Mr. King bui jugsed dune dales anvitty and beverand Young, who le much mere

ciculate, carried most of the discussion.

Initially, Reverend Abernathy said that there were three points they

wished to discuss with the FBI and he said the first of these had to do with communist

infiltration into the civil rights movement. He said that they all realized that Reverend

King, as the leading civil rights spokesman, was subject to persecution. He mentioned

the pamphlets which had been distributed showing a picture of King at a highlander

Folk School meeting and he mentioned the constant problem of keeping communists out

of the civil rights movement. Reverend Abernathy said that Jack O'Dell had been

brought into Reverend King's organization but that O'Dell did have a bad background

and communist connections and that he had, therefore, been dismissed from the staff

of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) • Reverend Abernathy said

that there had been statements made challenging Mr. King's loyalty but that the truth is

Reverend King has always attacked communism in his speeches, in his book, and that

their entire movement is "clean" in this respect.

na merfioried that both o belt and -73e

Levinson had been possible problems and he said that in the past their organization

had tried to get assistance from the Department regarding the background o1 these

individuals but had been generally unsuccessful. Reverend Young said they had the

problem of evaluating such people and ordered what could be done.

83 16: 22 1953

I pointed out that the answatches

very simple, that the FBI can't give

out information and that our files are confidertial. He wanted-to know wnat the SCLC

could do to protect itself or to get detailed information regarding individuals with

questionable background and he was informed that the House Committee on Un-

American Activities did have extensive records which were available to all citizens

and that this source could be of possible background assistance.

Reverend Young and Reverend Abernathy said they hoped they could

come to the FBI privately and they were told that they should always feel free to come

to us at any time and they were reminded that Director Hoover had emphasized this

point when he had seen them with Reverend King in November. Reverend Young

made some comment about a press release. He was told that the FBI had no intention

of making a release concerning their visit.

Reverend Abernathy spoke very generally, pointing out that people

were always "making charges" and "innuendoes" against Mr. King. He said there

are claims that Dr. King is getting rich and he is using organizational funds-for

his personal use. Reverend Abernathy said the fact is Mr. King receives no salary

from the SCLC whatsoever. I took occasion here to point out that certainly matters

relating to the usage of funds within their organization were of no concern whatsoever

i the FBI and that the FBI confined its activities strictly to its statutory limitations

1 and tbat we did not have time, let alone the authority to probe into other matters.

Reverend Young said it looked like there were some attempts to

smear and ruin the civil rights movement; that just lately there has been some new

evidence in this regard and that very obviously the activities of Mr. King and

the SCLC are under close surveillance. Young said that as a recent example, King

went to the home of Young's secretary while she was in the hospital so that he could

do some writing in private. Reverend Young said that shortly after King arrived in

the secretary's apartment he was tired, was taking pills that made him groggy and

went to sleep. Shortly afterwards he was awakened by a fireman who reported there

was a major fire at this address. King reported that after the fire trucks left, the

phone in the apartment began ringing but that no one would answer. Young said that

only he had known that King had gone to this apartment, but that he also had called

Reverend Abernathy and told him where King was and that as a result of this he was

certain someone had been tapping their phones.

Since Reverend Young had mentioned the possibility of surveillance,

he was asked if Reverend King believed he was being followed. Young said he had

no such information. He said he did feel though there must be some sort of con-

certed organized campaign that was being directed against King and the SCIC.

Young added that the SCLC takes for granted its phones are tapped and said he realized

e Government might have a legitimate interest in their official activities but

wondered about the governmental interest in people's private activities.

DeLoach to Mohr memo, 1-11-65

Re: Martin Luther King, Jr.

I very carefully pointed out that certainly the FBI was not interested

in any matter beyond the scope of our jurisdiction. I explained carefully the very

limited use made by the FBI of wire taps. I pointed out that wire taps were used

in certain major espionage cases, or in a kidnap case where a victim's life is at

stake, that there were very few such taps, and that each and every case required

the express authority of the Attorney General.

At this time both Reverend Young and Reverend Abernathy interrupted

to say that they, of course, knew better than to imply that the FBI would be involved.

Reverend Abernathy stated that there were three points they had

wanted to discuss; communist infiltration, allegations that King was getting rich

on the civil rights movement and the third point had to do with allegations about

--

the personal life and moral character of King. Abernathy bogged down a bit at this

point and said that, "We all are human beings... We all make mistakes." Itried.

to bring out what he meant and asked why he was making such statements. Abernathy

said that he was not going to make allegations against the FBI but that some things

were ming on they just enuine not understand.

.. .

Reverend Young said that King had been receiving some letters

charging him with immorality, that these letters attacked his personal life and he

pointed out rather lamely that "All humans make mistakes."

I told Reverend Abernathy and Reverend Young that a lot of people did

come to the FBI with rumors and stories and that as a matter of fact, we had heard

allegations reflecting on Dr. King's morality but that certainly we took no action on

such rumors. I emphasized that any prominent person or leader of a movement must

be most careful in his private life and that such a leader's reputation should be

above reproach. I also noted that these rumors regarding King were prevelant

outside the FBI.

Reverend Abernathy said there had been some problems in the past;

that when Reverend King goes to make a speech people always want to hold a little

party or reception for him and that there is alcohol at these parties. Abernathy

said as a Baptist minister King does not participate in drinking affairs but some-

(times it is hard to avoid attending receptions where drinking does go on.

Reverend Young said that he was deeply concerned about irresponsible

usage of personal information on the part of scandalmongers and wondered if there

çould be any "leaks" from the Government. He was assured that there were no leaks

com the FBI, that the Director ran a tight organization and that any irresponsibility

on the part ol any Agent would not be tolerated. Young said he did not leel the rol

was responsible and said that just the other day King had received a letter which

brought up the "female question," and added they have been getting 8 or 10 bad letters

Re: Martin Luther King, JI.

Here again he was asked why he was telling us this and Young replied

that they were worried and concerned, that maybe they were overly concerned, but

that it seemed the campaign against King had been stepped up since he had received

the Nobel Prize. Young spoke about constant threats to ruin King and threats on

King's life. He was toid that if any threats were made which would come within the

FBI's investigative authority, the full facts shoud be made available promptly so that

the matter could be thoroughly run out and investigated.

Reverend Abernathy brought up the fact again that all men make

I mistakes and blunders but that King had become the symbol of nonviolence and that

it would be tragic for both the North and South if King should be ruined and if some

demagogue like Malcolm & would move in and take over the civil rights movement.-..

He said it would be tragic if Dr. King were destroyed. He was asked if there was

vulnerability on Dr. King's part or if he was being blackmailed. He said that every-

body has skeletons in their closets and he said that DI. King was really a moral

person, that he had a deep love for all of mankind--I refrained from commenting

here-band that King was very moral and that in the last year Dr. King had been

especially careful to avoid ant actions which could be misconstrued by racists and

hers out to destroy King.

Reverend Young tried to get "down to brass tacks" but was unable

to do so. He spoke of the changing sex standards in the country, talked in general

terms about people being tempted and making bad judgments and spoke about the

spiritual nature of their movement and the fact that God uses "frail vessels" in

carrying out His precepts, knowing full well the weaknesses of men. I asked him,

as a minister of God, if he condoned sex degeneracy. He replied that people have

different standards and different ideas as to what the sex norm is.

I made a final attempt to pin down the precise nature of their problem

but neither man would come out with any specifics--only statements that "they" were

trying to ruin King and the.civil rights movement and that this would be tragic for

the whole country. Both ministers said they knew and appreciated the fact that the

FBI would not be a party to vilification of King and I said this was true, and that

while we naturally were aware of rumors concerning immorality on King's part;

we had no cause to look into such matters.

Reverend Abernathy said he wanted to be very frank and wanted to

raise a question as to whether some Agents might overstep their authority in the Souti

and might engage in actions which were not known to FBI Headquarters. I

emphasized this was absolutely impossible, that our Agents carried a very heavy

sase load, that we knew what our Agents were doing at all times and always knew

§their whereabouts.

Re: Martin Luther King, dr.

Both visitors said, of course, they accepted and knew this to be

a fact. They mentioned one incident of a Georgia Bureau of Investigation man

checking on one of their meetings. They also mentioned the possibility that private

investigators may have been hired to probe their activities.

They said they had no other problems and I assured them that they

should always feel free to call on us if anything should occur within our investigative

authority. Both ministers agreed to do so and added they appreciated the

Lopportunity of stopping by.

Throughout the visit, both Young and Abernathy were ill at ease

Mand le was evious that neither of tom could bring thesselves to discuss any

specific allegations of immorality on King's part.

I had been back in my office approximately 30 minutes when Senator

had been perfected relative to either institution.

He indicated thi

qwe were initiating appropriate checks as to the availability of suc

permit the beading off of the conferring of honorary degrees to Kin

We indicated an intention to proceed along lines similar to that tal

The Director noied "OK" relative to these

Boston SAC Handley has advised that although the Boston

Sargent Skriver and Olds spends half of his time in Washington, D. C

TEa.

ORSERVATIOUS:

Because of Olds' close association with Shriver, it would

not appear to be prudent to attenpi to deal with hiw.

It

Iron our study that Senator Saltonstall is the most logical indi-

viduzl to deal with and that if he were personally approached by

Assistant Director Deloach and orally briefed, in the strictest of

confidence, concerning King, he vould be in a position to take the

necessary action to prevent King Ixon receiving an honorary degree

fIon Springfield College.

RECOMMENDATION:

If approved, Deloach should personally orally briet

Senator Saltonstall in accordance with the attached "Top Secret"

summary indicating King's communist connections and degenerzte

rake-up. This is the same sunnary we previously used in the

Harquette University situation). It should be made clear to

Saltonstall that the information is being given him in the suricte.

of confidence with the thought that he might desire to use it in

preventing King fron receiving an honorary degree from Springfield

College and thus save that institution from embarrassuent because

of King's connections and character.

It should be emphasized t0

Saltonstall that under no circumstances may this intormation.evex.

be attributed to the Bureau.

secondly, he dislilies going to

Jones ranted O'Dryer. to arrange a

Ironted with king's version of his (Hoffa's) responsibility

to aid the 450,000 degro nembers of Hoffa's union by

contributin, financial and moral support.

Disclosure of

King's transnarent atternt to blackmail loffa with the large

Negro membership of Hofia's union, to solve the Southern

Christian Leadership Conference's financial problems vould

cause an uproar anong leaders of organizations having large

Negro merberships; pointing out their own vulnerability to

such a snueeze by any unscrupulous civil rignts leader.

Tisis

potential collusion betreen la-ge labor unions and the civil

Negro in that through large financial donations,

Re:

100-106670

Public disclosure of King's intentions in this

Instance appears timely, in that it points out lioffa's

susceptibility to King's plot and the intention of

King to virtually engage in extortion to obtain needed

funds.

Disclosure would be mutually embarrassing to

both men and probably cause king's quest for badly needed

funds -to fail in this instance.

RECO:CIENDATION:

That this memorandum and the attached article

be referred to the Crime Records Division for

appropriate handling. The article is on plain unwater-

marked bond paper.

the erpress approval

nel milliont

It was presiously recommended and approved that Crime

Records alert friendly news media regarding a proposed meeting between

Ling and Hofia 11/9/63.

Through a reliable source we learned late last night

that in view of publicity in the New York Daily News regarding this

unwise to meet with Hoifa. It was further ascertained that King was

still due to arrive in Washington at 11:30 Aivi this morning, it being noted

that he had a speech scheduled at Howard University this evening.

We alerted Julian Morrison, a very friendly reporter with

the Washington New's, and Sid Epstein of The Star regarding King's

arrival time in Washingion. The reporters cornered King as he came

off the plane and quizzed him about the meeting with Hofia. King at

•first told the reporters that the meeting had been cancelled and he seemed

1 to be llustered at the reporters' appearance. He then ducked into a

i mens' roor at the airport with his aides and upon emerging told

the reporters that there had been discussion regarding his meeting Hoifa

but that he had no further comment at this time, and he had decided to

hold a press conference later on this afternoon at the Statier Hotel.

King then left the airport with Clarence Jones who had come down earlier

from New Yorl:, and with an attorney with Jones by the name of Philip

Sipser, who identified himself as a labor lawyer.

Morrison advised at 3:15 PM this afternoon that he had

finally gotten through to King's party at the Statler and had talked to

King's aide Reverend Andrew Young. Young at this time informed Morrison

that the meeting between King and Holla was oil and he clumed that the

raceting had been cancelled last night.

Re: Hiartin Luther King, Jr.

Security Matter - C

Proposed Meeting with James P.. Hoffa 11/9/66

Morrison pressed him for details and Young said that the

I proposed purpose of this meeting had been "misinterpreted." He said

King had wanted to have an ofi-the-record discussion with Holla regarding

the problems of the Negroes in the Teamsters and Young claimed that

King's outfit had worked closely with the Teamsters in Atlanta and

Chicago and they felt it was time for them to meet the Teamster head.

Young said it was difficult for King to have a private conversation with

anyone in view of his prominence and reiterated that the whole matter

had been "misinterpreted and distorted." Reporler Morrison continued

to press Young and Young finally acknowledged that King might try to

have a meeting with Hofia at some other time.

Morrison advises that The News will carry a picture tomorrow

oi sing arriving in iown, togeiner sit ine inormaton sei vui dove.

The Star is also going to report this meeting.

It is felt that our counterintelligence aim to thwart Ising

It is based

entirely on public source information and we are recom-

mending that it be referred to the Crime Records Division

with the idea that it can be given to a friendly newspaper

contact such as David Lawrence, who is Editor of the U. s

News and forld Report.

The article was prepared because the cry

of "black power" is a nost timely issue in the country today.

This issue has split the civil rights movenent and has caused

civil rights leaders to take sides for and against-"black

power."

However, Martin Luther king has been attempting

to straddle the issue, based_on advice given him by his

advisors with communist backgrounds.

The attached article

indicts King for his izilure to take a stand on the issue

and. at the same time exposes the degree of communist influence

on hitic

It is felt the public should again be

reminded of this communist influence on King, and the

current controversy among civil rights leaders makes this

timely to do so.

The attached article has been prepared with

no letterhead relating it to the FBI and is on unwatermarked

bond paper.

King's palllating and anbiguons position on the

Issue is difficult to understand or justify. Thosa who cry

understood and misdefiaed. But the record i5 clear that

1t stands for open advocacy of violesce, insistence on an

all legro organizational structure in civil rights groues,

and reverse racist.

It 2s equally clear that these things are direct

contradictions of the principles underiying the legitinate

The "Hashington Post and Times Herald" contained a small

aunounced through his office in Atlanta that he had been granted

audience with Pope Paul VI to take place on Friday, 9-18-64,

which time he hopes to discuss the racial situation in the United

States with the Pope.

You will recall that several weeks ago, when we first

learned of King's intention to travel abroad, we

anticipated the

possibility of King's asking for an audience

with the Pope and

arranged to have Assistant Director Halone of the New York Office

contact Francis Cardinal-Spellman to see if appropriate action could

not be taken to prevent such an audience.

Malone did brief Cardinal

Spellman in the matter and told us the Cardinal had in fact called the

Vatican immediately after being contacted by Malone.

Malone was contacted telephonically today to see if he

any further light on the report that King was to have an

audience with the Pope. He contacted Cardinal Spellman's office and

was told that the Cardinal, who presently is recuperating from an

operation, had spoken personally several weeks ago by telephone to

the Secretary of State at the Vatican and had strongly recommended

that no audience be granted King because of very serious but highly

confidential information which had cone to his attention but which be

Malone was asked to determine if there possibly could have

Spellman's warning.

He was advised by Cardinal Spellman's office

that with the information being furnished to the Secretary of State

at the Vatican It would be mandatory for the Secretary of state to

furnish the information directly to the Pope and that there was every

assurance the Pope had received the information. Cardinal Spellman's

office advised halone today that it is possible that arrangements for.

scheduled to appear in Davenport, Iowa, 4/28/65,

at a banquet

sponsored by the Davenport Chapter of the Catholic Interracial

Council (CIC). King will reportedly be paid 91, 000 for his

appearance and also be given the "Pacem in Terris" award, the

second year such an award has been given by the CiC.

The irst

such awards were given in 1964 to the late President Kennedy

and to John Howard Griffin, a writer. The award is in memory

of Pope John.

• You will recall that in August, 1964, we recommended,

and the Director approved, that Francis Cardinal Spellman be

orally briefed concerning King's communist connections and

moral degeneracy so that such information could be passed on

to the Pope as it was anticipated that King would seek an

audience with the Pope.

Such briefing of the Cardinal subsequentl:

was made by Assistant Director Malone in New York City.

It is shocking Indeed that King continues to be

honored by religious groups.

Inasnuch as commitments have

apparently been made by the CIC for the award in Davenport,

there 1s little likelihood that anything can be done in this

Instance to prevent such an award. It is believed, however,

that it would be desirable to have Assistant Director Halone

recontact Cardinal Spellman and bring to his attention the

information we continue to receive about King being given

honors by Catholic groups, citing the Davenport CIC award as

a current instance.

It could be tactfully suggested that in

the end it might sell be embarrassing to the Catholic Church

having given honors to King.

A discussion with the Cardinal

might well suggest to him the desirability for the Cardinal

to initiate such action as he deems appropriate, through church

circles, to alert Catholic institutions and organizations concerni

King.

It would appear that the Cardinal would certainly be

appreciative for the intormation we are fare filmet. e

In the civil rights novenent in this country today. He is of

vital interest to us because of the communist influences upon

him. His actions ard expressions (both private and public) are

of Importance In several different areas of the Bureau's

operations such.as relating to the communist influences in

racial matters, racial matters generally, civil rights matters,

Because of King's position, we must be, In many

respects, extremely guarded in our efforts to gain information

concerning King's activities.

King frequently travels about

the country and speaks to public gatherings.

He often times

discusses the luture plans of himself and his organization, the

Southern Christian Leadership Conference. It is well, therefore,

to avail ourselves of the coverage which may be given King

through a review of news media, sources and through contact with

established reliable sources.

We recently received information divulging à series

of King's appointments for the period 1/20/65 through 6/19/65.

These include many public gatherings such as at universities and

colleges, churches, and the like. We are, therefore, recommending

a letter to the appropriate offices instructing that they report

Information available from news media and established sources

concerning King's appearances in their respective territories.

By receiving letterhead memoranda with such information, we

are also able to make prompt dissemination to such interested

other agencies as the Department and the military Intelligence.

RECONLENDATION:

Attached for approval is a

Letter to the appropriate

offices covering the territories in which King is scheduled to

travel.

This morning lr. Ralph NcGill, publisher of the

"Atlanta

Constitution," Atlanta, Georgia,

and a long-time adnirer of the Director;

dropped by the office to discuss with me Martin Luther King,

ix.

= Matill some

concerit

•mmara

licGill told me that on being

advised of the facts concernag king,

he has remained completely silent.

As a result, he is being questioned

by associates in Atlanta,

Georgia, as to why he is not speaking out in

favor of king and why he is not taking an active part in the banquet

to be given King next Wednesday night. McGillisaid that he would never

disclose a confidence and, therefore,

his only reply is that he no

'onger is an admirer of Martin Luther King.

Further, he has talked

ith some other men who have told him of their knowledge of king's

morality and their concern about it.

In view of this, he is free

can be attributed to the men with whom he has spoken.

BeGill said that these men are Adlai/stevenson, Ralph Bunche,

and Harryl Ashnore of the Arkansas Gazette." He told me that Adlai

Stevenson advised him without being questioned about king that he is

aware of King's innoral activities. Stevenson told cGill that he

considers King to be a "very dangerous man" to the civil rights movement

and that something should be done about it. Ralyh Bunche told McGill

that he has never been an adnirer of King's although he thinks King

has done some good things; that a few months ago he began hearing very

disturbing stories about King's imnoral behavior. Bunche believes

King should be maneuvered

out of the civil rights field or else he

will do it serious damage.

lix. Ashmore,

likewise, informed McGill

he had heard some time ago about King's incredibly imnoral activities.

Ashnore is very disturbed over it and wishes sonething could be done

"but he has so specific course to recommend.

100-106670-781

Sir. McGill told me that following my first discussion with him

a few weeks ago he contacted a banker friend in Atlanta who was helping

to finance the banquet to be given King next Wednesday night.

The

banker was disturbed and said he would contact some other bankers also

involved and see if support could be quietly withdrawn. McGill's

friend and some of the bankers did take steps to withdraw but this was

very quickly relayed to bankers in Haiti who were on the threshold

of an important financial deal with the Atlanta, Georgia, bankers.

They took the position that if the Atlanta bankers did not support the

Martin Luther king party, their financial deal with these Georgia

bankers was off. as IcGill said to me, the almighty dollar is still

extremely important and especially so with bankers, and as a result they

got cold feet and decided to go ahead with linancing King's party.

ücGill told me that Archbishop

Hallinan, Catholic leader in

He said that he is certain that not

one of these three is avare of King's immoral behavior. I told him

that in view of what stevenson, Bunche,

and Ashmore had told hin, he

night want to explore very confidentially and discreetly the subject

matter with these three men. He said he would do this.

cGill told me that he thinks it is too late now, especially in

new oI the financial interest of the Georgia bankers in the Halti deal,

o prevent the banquet from taking place. However, licGill said he

could do what he could to encourage key people to limit their praise

and support of King as much as possible.

McGill also told me that he is taking steps through RalphBunche

to get key Negro leaders to unite in opposition to King and to gradually

force him out of the civil rights movement if at all possible.

Ir. McGill said that he would like to have President Johnson know

three things-- (1) that from diverse sources he has learned of the

Incredibly immoral behavior of bi Martin Luther king, dro, and his

deceiving of sincere, good people in this Nation who have been supportin

King;R)that he regrets greatly that the banquet is being given in King's

honor next week in Atlanta, but that it has gone so far that it is

probably not possible to head it off; and (3) that he believes that the

very best thing that could happen would be to have King step completely

out of the civil rights movement and public life for he feels that if

this is not done, sooner or later King will be publicly exposed and this

will do Irreparable harm to the civil rights movement in which ne,

licGill and others are so interested and have worked so hard for, and

likewise, It will do injury to different citizens of the country who

have been

supporting King not knowing that he is of such low moral

character.

Senorandum to Mr. Belmont

Re: MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.

hir. McGill said that if he had had time to see President

Johnson before leaving washington, he would have told him these

three things, but that he wanted the Director to know that he is

free to quote him on these three points to the President and free

to put all three things in any communication that goes to the

White House Irom the bureau.

It is very refreshing to meet a man of licGill's stature in

the field of journalism who is so sincere and honest and desirous

of doing the right thing. He is a very admirable man.

Repeatedly,

hir. McGill told me that he will continue to stay with this problem

and

to think about it, hoping that he will devise some plan or

McGill told me in a visibly disturbed manner that this problem

centering around King has caused him to wake up at night from time

to time and he is very upset over it. licGill explained that while

he has never been close to king or an active supporter thereos, he

nas been completely identified and very active in furthering civil

rights and better conditions for the Negroes.

He thinks that King's

"behavior now known to him when publicly exposed will do irreparable

damage to such social causes that he and others have been

sponsoring

throughout a lifetime.

RECOMMENDATION:

Enclosed will be found a letter to the White House setting

forth licGill's discussion for approval and forwarding.

Inasmuch

as

IcGill mentioned only the President's getting this infornation, we

do not contemplate any further dissemination.

Reverend Abernathy expressed the appreciation of the Negro race for the Directoz's

line work in the field of civil rights. He stated that the Negroes had probioms,

particularly in the South, and, therefore, had requested a discussion with lie Director

at the very time their people were continuing to "rise up from their bondage."

Reverend King spoke up. He stated it was vitally necessary to keey a

working relationship with the FBI. He wanted to clear up any misundersirding thich

might have occurred, He stated that some Negroes had told him that the Fül had been

incifective, however, he was inclinesi to discount such criticism. Revered King aster

that the Director please understand that any criticism of the Director and the fei whic.

had been attributed to King was either a misquote or an outright misrepresentaiion. a

staled this particularly concerned Albany, Georgia. He stated that the only time he hac

ever criticized the FBI was because of instances in which Special Agents who had been

given complaints in civil rights cases regarding brutality by police officere were seen

the following day being friendly with those same police officers. King stated this, of

course, promoted distrust inasmuch as the police someti-.es "brutalized" Negroes.

Reverend King stated he personally appreciated the great work of the FE

which had lurn done in so many instances. He stated this was particularly true in

Mississippi. He added that FBI developments in that State have been very significant.

The FBI is i great restraining influence. Reverend King denied that he had ever statec

that Negrow should not report information to the FBl. He said he had actually encoura

such reporling, in many instances. He claimed there were good relationships in many

communitics, especially Atlanta, Georgia, between Negrots and the FBI. He stated he

would continue to strongly urge all of his people to work closely with the FBI.

Reverend King stated he has never made any personal attack upon

Mr. Hoover. He stated he had merely tried to articulate the feelings of the Negroes in

the Soirth in order to keep a tradition of nonviolence rather than violence. He added tha

the Negro sluuld never be transferred from a policy of nonviolence to one of violence ai

terror.

Reverend King said that the Director's report to the President this sumi.

on rioting wits a very excellent analysis,

Reverend King advised that Negroes are currently laboring under a very

strating sltuation. He stated that, "We sometimes are on the verge of temporary

"pair. " Il' added that it was a challenge and a duty for him to keep the Negro from

coming to a luiling point. He stated that sometimes the cries coming from the Negro

represent a inal feeling of lonesomeness and despair. He, however, has pointed cut thi

the path to success is nonviolence rather than violence.

Reverend King stated he has been, and still is, very concerned regarding

the matter of communism in the civil rights movement. He stated he knew that the

Director was very concerned because he bore the responsibility of security in the Natio:

Reverend Kiny stated that from a strong philosophical point of view he could never beco:

stated that a: a Christian

Martin Luther King, Appointment With Director, 3:35 p.m., 12-1-64

The Director told King and his associates that the FBI shares the same

lespair which the Negroes suffer when Negro leaders refused to accept the deep

esponsibility they have in the civil rights movement. He stated that when Negroes are

ncouraged not to cooperate with the FBI this sometimes frustrates or delays successful

olution of investigations. The Director told King that he had personally gone to

Mississippi to meet with Governor Paul Johnson inasmuch as there had been practically

o liaison between the Department of Justice, the President and the State of Mississippi

reforehand. The Director stated that upon meeting Governor Johnson the Governor

xplained honestly that he was a segregationist, however, ahorred violence. The

Director stated that he had told Governor Johnson they haa a common meeting ground

nasmuch as he was in Mississippi to put an end to violence and hrutality. The Director

old Governor Johnson that he would like to do this in collaboration with the State Police,

lowever, If the FBI could not receive such cooperation we would do it on our own. The

Director then made reference to watermoccasins, rattlesmakes and redneck sheriffs, in

hat order, who still exist in Mississippi who represent the trashy type of characters whi

re promoting civil rights violations. The Director told King that we had trained twenty

representatives of the Mississippi State Highway Patrol and that this had represented a

good move to promote better cooperation and solution of civil rights cases.

The Director told Reverend King that the FBI had put the "fear of God" in

he Ku Klux Klan (KKK). He told King that'we knew of the identity of the murderers of

he three civil rights workers and that these murderers scald soon he brought to trial.

Che Director then spoke of the terror in Mississippi bacloods and of the fact that

sheriffs and deputy sheriffs participate in crimes of violence. He summarized by telling

sing that we, therefore, are under the same strain that sincere Negro leaders are under

Che. Director added that the KKK constartly damns the FEI and that we have currently

seen classified as the "Federal Bureau of Integration" in Mississippi.

The Director told King that many cases, which have been brought about as

& result of FBI investigation, must be tried in State Court. He spoke of the difficulty in

obtaining a verdict of guilty in instances in which white juries are impaneled in cases

involving white men. The Director spoke of the KIK involvement in the Lemuel Penn ca

just outside of Athens, Georgia. He stated this was an outragecus miscarriage of justic

in that the defendants, despite the open and shut erience on the part of the FBI, had been

acquitted.

The Director made it clear to Reverend King and his associates that the

FBI could not state whether a conviction woald be obtained or not in the case involving th

murdered three civil rights victims. He stated, however, that the FBi has excellent

evidence in this case. The Director then explained that it was most necessary for the

FRI not to "jump the gun" unless we had sufficient evidence in which a case coud be

ght to trial.

The Director made reference to Reverend King's allegation that the FBI

leals or associates with law enforcement officers who have been invol;ed in civil rights

iolations. He stated emphatically that, "I'll be damned if the FBI has associated with

ny of these people nor will we be associated with them in the future." The Director

explained that the FBI, not only because of the very nature of the law but also because of

he background of our investigative employees, was in full sympathy with the sincere

spects of the civil rights movement. He stated that the FBI constantly needs cooperatic

und assistance in order to solve cases. He added that he made it a point, several years

go, to transfer northern Special Agents to southern offices. He stated that, for the mo:

sart, northern-born Agents are assigned civil rights cases in the South. The Director

idded that he feels that our Special Agents, regardiess of where they are born, will

nvestigate a case impartially and thoroughly. He mentioned, however, that it was unfai

o the Agent and the FBI to "have a strike against him" in that critcism

1 had been leveled

over the fact that southern Agents would not give Negroes a "fair shake." The Director

stated that such criticism was entirely unjustifiable and that no case had ever been brous

o our attention proving such a fact.

The Director made reference to the recent case in McComb, Mississippi,

n which nine men had been charged with burning churches and violence against Negroes.

stated this again was a miscarriage of justice. He added that the judge's decision in

-casing the deiendants because they had learned their lesson and were merely youtis

was entirely wrong and that it caused some people to question where youth really began.

le explained that some of the defendants had been in their 40's. The Director added the

1 deal probably, of course, had been made, however, this would certainly not represent

any deterrent to future actions of violence by these men.

The Director explained that there is a great misunderstanding today amo..

he general public and particularly the Negro race as to what the FBI can and cannot do

in the way of investigations. The Director emphasized that the FBI cannot recommend

prosecution or declination of prosecution. He stated that Agents cannot make "on the sp

arrests. He stated that the FBI merely investigates and then the Department of Justice

letermines whether prosecution be entertained or not. The Director added that the

question is sometimes raised why prosecution is not scheduled sooner. He state this,

I course, was not the responsibility of the fBl in any way whatsoever. He pointed out

hat our civil rights investigations are conducted in a very thorough and expeditious

manner once the Department has authorized such investigations.

The Director spoke of the FBI's successful penetration of the KIK. He

stated that the FBI has interviewed all members of the KKK in Mississippi and has

served notice to these members that if trouble occurs we plan to come to them first. B

stated our penetration of the KICK has been as successful as the manner in which we

(Itrated the communists and the Soviet espionage services. He stated that our progre

in infiltrating the IKK has been so rapid that Klan members now suspect each other anc

are fighting among themselves. The Director mentioned that we have two confessions i

the killing of the three civil rights workers. He added that the Klan in Mississippi has

as to the identity of FBI informants in their midst. The Director stated he had personal

been an enemy of the KKK for a long time.

He spoke of the FBI's case in Louisiana in the late 1920's in which FBI

evidence suocessfully culminated in the conviction of the top Klan leader. He stated the

KKK fully concentrated on Negroes, Jews and Catholics, however, concentration now

is strictly on the Negro race..

The Director told the group that in the Lemuel Penn case the defendants

have recently been indicted and are to stand trial in Federal Court. He stated the trial

would begin sometime next week. He mentioned that the same defendants were

responsible for beating Negroes and participation in other acts of violence. The Directo

added that the FBI's success in infiltrating the KKK has been so extensive that we now .-

sometimes know in advance what the KKK plans to do and take pIsventive measures

accordingly.

The Director explained that in Alabama the FBI cannot deal with the

Highway Patrol because of the psychoneurotic tendencies of the Alabama Governor.

He

stated that the State of Georgia has a good Governor and that the Georgia Burezu of

estigation, while not comparable to the Mississippi Highway Patro', has cooperated

a the FBI.

The Director told Reverend King and his associates that FBl

representatives have held several thousand law enforcement conferences in which

southern police officers have been educated as to civil rights legislation. He stated this

ras clearly assisted law enforcement, particularly the FBI, however, acnittedly, this

represents slow progress, but progress nevertheless. He added that this educational

campaign will be continued and that it will eventually take hold. The Direcior gave the

example of a Mississippi Sheriff who recently broke a case as a result of FBI trzining.

The Director made it very clear to Reverend King and his associates that

FBI Agents conduct very thorough interviews in civil rights cases. He stated he would

ike to know immediately if any of our Special Agents ever act in a supercilious manner

or if they mishandle a compaint regarding civil rights. He stated that if the facts

reflect that our Agent is in the wrong he will be called on the carpet fast. The Direcior®

isked that Reverend King or any of his representatives feel free to call the FBI at any

ime they have such complaints.

The Director told Reverend King he desired to give him some advice. He

stated that one of the greatest things the Negro leaders could accomplish would be to

encourage voting registration among their people. Another thing would be to educate the

le in the skills so that they could compete in the open market. The Director

nentioned several professions in which Negroes could easily lezrn skills. The Director

Uso told King he wanted him to know that registrars in the South were now more careful

iNther a gons?982 sings. That there were less attempts now to prevent Negroes from

régistering inasmuch as the FBI is watching such actions very carefully. The Director

told Reverend King that the FBI was making progress in violations regarding

discrimination in eating places. He gave as a specific example a restaurant in Atlanta,

Georgia, in which surveillances have taken place to ascertain li out-of-state cars are

being served at this particular resaurant. The Director stated he personally was in

favor of equality in eating places and in schools. He stated emphatically, however, he

was not in favor of takir.g Negro children 10 or 12 miles across town simply because

their parents wanted them to go to a school other than those in their specific

neighborhood. -

The Director told Reverent King thut in due time there will be a complet

change in the mores of community thinking in the United States regarding the racial

problem. He stated that meanwhile the Fil will continue to handle its responsibilities

in a thorough and impartial manner. He reitzrute: that the FBI cannot encourage

prosecution in Federal Court despite the fact fat sarelocal courtcannot be trusted. He

added that some judges cannot be trusted.

• .

The Director praised the Erorgia piers that declared the verdict of the

Penn case to be a travesty of justice. Hs udiss ünt the Jackson, Mississippi, paper

Dirch burnense te same editoriaos de ter as no way to solve tact tion in

problems. The Director stated that his surements made at a press conference in

Jackson, Mississippi, this summer to die sitect tazi he was in Mississippi to see to it

upon backwoods terrorists.

The Director told King that te wanted to make it very clear that the

question is oiten raised as to whether the Fel mil protect civil rights workers or Negrc

He stated that he has in the past and will continue to answer such questions on the basis

that the FBI does not have the authority noz the jarisdiction to protect anyone. He state

that when the Department of Justice desires that Regroes be protected this is the

responsibility of U. S. Marshals. The Director rciterated that the FBI is strictly an

investigative agency and cannot and will not eatend itself beyond legislated jurisdiction.

The Director repeated very emphatically that while our investigations are very definitei

thorough and impartial he wanted to state unse agnin that if Reverend King or any of his

associates ever knew of a Special Agent showing bias or prejudice he wanted to know

about this matter immediately.

The Director explained that ie have civil rights cases not only in the

South but also in the northern cities. He gave examples of New York and Chicago. He

stated ihat there have been some cases in Miami, Florida.

Martin Luther King, Appointment with Director, 3:35 p.Io, 12-1-64

The Director spoke once again of the necessity of the Negro educating

imself in order to compete in manual and professional skills. He mentioned the

kample oi a snoesnine boy in miami, florida, who turned out to be, aiter questioning

y the Director, a graduate of Howard University. This shoeshine boy, a Negro,

splained to the Director that he could not get a job above the level of shoeshine boy

ecause of the color of his skin. The Director stated this, of course, was wrong and

at under no circumstances did he, or anyone in the FBI, share the opinion that the

egro, or any othér race, should be kept down. The Director spoke of his pride in .

egro Agents and particularly mentioned Special Agent Aubrey Lewis, the former

otre Dame track star who is currently assigned to the New York Division,

The Director spoke of a Miami Special Agent who was transferred to that

ffice from St. Louis. This Agent explained to the Director on one occasion that he was

rst a little upset about being transferred to Miami because he felt that his race would -

against him. He stated, however, much to his surprise, that the white people in

iami treated him with the greatest of courtesy while people of his own race referred to

m as a "fink" simply because he was a representative of law enforcement.

Reverend King interrupted the Director at this point and asked it this same

egro Agent is still assigned to the Miami Division. The Director replied in the

sonative. The Director stated that at a recent dinner Father Hesburgh, the President

sutre Dame University, explained to the Director that his institution had difficulty

itting Negroes on the football team because their grades were never high enough. The

irector told Reverend King the same thing is true of Negroes who apply for the position

Special Agent. He stated in most instances they lack the qualifications, however, we

ere very happy to hire any Negro who was qualified for the position. The Director Lola

iverend king that we, of course, could not let down our qualifications simply because

the color of a person's skin.

The Director told Reverend King and his associates that the problems that

and the Negro leaders have is a mutual problem. He stated in most instances in civil

ghts matters we have learned that "you are damned if you do and you are damned if you

n't." The Director stated nevertheless the FBI would continue to do its job. He stated

at we additionally are very proud of 10 or 11 Indian Special Agents and of a number of

ecial Agents who have Mexican blood in them. He stated that the color of a man's skin.

akes no difference to the FBI whatsoever, however, we do merit the cooperation and

sistance of all groups and it is most unfair when these groups are taught not to

operate with the FBl.

The Director mentioned that he wanted to make it very plain that the FBI

Il not tolerate any of our personnel being slapped around. He gave an example of the

imbardozzi case in New York where one of our Agents was jumped by five hodlums

bie a church. He stated these hoodlums vere immediately taught a lesson, The

rector mentioned that in the war with hoodlums, for every man we lose we make

rtain, through legal means of course, that the hoodlums lose the same number or more

The Director proudly spoke of the ability of Agents to outshoot and

uttight hoodlums and other individuals who attempted to take advantage of our personnel

le stated the KKK is afraid to "mix" with our Agents. He mentioned that the Klan was

'yellow." He stated they are brave as long as they have the majority with them but

fraid when they face an equal number.,

The Director spoke of the Mack Charles Parker case in Poplarville,

Kississippi. He stated that our evidence in this case had been turned over to Governor

oleman, the then Governor of that State. He mentioned that Governor Coleman was a

lecent type of individual who had immediately seen to it that a State Court received the

vidence contributed by the FBI. The Director mentioned that our evidence in this case

ras excellent, however, the Grand Jury refused to indict the subjects involved in the

ynching of Parker.

The Director toid Reverend King that in many instances our Agents have

een spit upon, they have been refused food and lodging and many things are done to

awart hard-hitting investigations by the FBI. He stated that nevertheless we continue

o gather

evidence in an expeditious and thorough manner.

Reverend Abernathy stated that the Negroes have a real problem in

ing down the current system of segregated voting tests in the South. He stated it was

Just important that there be kept alive in the Negro communities a ray of hope. He

tated that the Negro people should not be allowed to fall into an atmosphere of despair.

The Director explained that this was a very important point. He stated

hat real progress has been made in higher wages, voting registration and housing

satters. The Director pointed out, however, that such progress has not been

mphasized by the rabblerousers who constantly attempt to stir up the Negroes against

he whites. The Director gave as an example the communist, Epton in New York City.

he Director stated that Epton is sometimes pointed to as a person the Negro should

mulate because of his militancy. The Director stated this was wrong and it is also

rong to "mislead" Negroes. .

Reverend Abcrnathy stated that the SCLC does not want Negroes like®

ipton in their movement. He stated that Reverend King, more than anyone else, has

revented people like Epton and the Muslims from taling over the civil rights movement

'everend Abernathy stated that actually the Negroes are a part of the Federal

overnment, therefore, anything that represents the Federal Government is an

ncouragement to the Negro. He added that even the side of a post office building or a

ederal courtroom is an encouragement to the Negro. He mentioned that when a Negro

eceives information that a case in which he has been brutally mistreated is going to

"ederal Court he feels encouraged over the fact that he will get a fair trial. Reverend

nathy continued that the same problem is true when a Negro sees an FBI Agent. He

tated that the Negro feels open encouragement inasmuch as the FBI will not only fairly

The Director stated that the KKK today is represented by common white

trash. He stated that the Klan was actually worse than the Communist Party inasmuch

25 the Klan resorts to violence while the communists usually emulate termites in their

activities.

.

The Director reiterated that King and his associates should feel free to

call him at any time when they have knowledge of possible civil rights violations. King

replied that over the past lew years he has noted amazing signs oi progress in the civil

rights field. He stated he has been very surprised to see some communities comply

with the new civi rights statutes. He stated there still are some pockets of resistence

particularly in the South. He raded that the SCLC is planning to stimulate voting

registration activities in Selmz, Alabama, in the near future. He mentioned that some

members of his organization have been successful in infiltrating this white community

and have learned there is a great potential for violence, in Selma, - ...-

The Director interrupted King and briefly detailed five cases in which the

FBI has gathered evidence in Salma, Alabama The Director identified these cases

fully, and specifically the case against Sheriff James Clark. The Director mentioned

that these cases came about as a resili of FBI investigation and that we were continuing

our investigations in Selmz, (Jacame. He mentioned that one case would come to trial

(Jecember 9, 1964. The Director particularly made reference to the fact that we hav

thiee excellent cases in Selme at the present time.

Reverend King inquired as to whether his representatives should notify

the FBI when they arrive in Selma, Alabama. He quickly corrected himself that he latr

his representatives should contact the 2.3I upon arrival, however, he asked the Director

what would be the possibilities oi Fi Agents being in Selma, Alabama, inasmuch as

there appeared to be a potentic! for ricience. The Director specifically asked Reverend

King when his activities would trie place. Reverend Abernathy indicated such activity

would take place around Januasy 1, 1905. The Director clearly explained that FBI

Agents would be in Selma, not for the purpose of "protecting" anyone, but for the

purpose of observing and reporting to the Department of Justice any possible violations

of civil rights that might occur. Reverend King expressed appreciation in this regard.

Reverend King stood up and stated he wished to express his personal

thanks for a most fruitful and necessary meeting. The Director told Reverend King thai

he should get in touch with us at anytime he felt it was necessary.

Reverend King mentined that there were representatives of the press in

the Director's reception room. He turned to me and asked if the FBI planned to make

any comment regarding the mecting. I told him that the Director had instructed thai we

make no comment whatsoever. Reverend King asked the Director if there would be any

actions if he read a short prepared statement to the press. The Director told

Reverend King this, of course, was up to him.

In proceeding to the reception rcom, Reverend King pulled out a press

ad been prepared prior-to the time Reverend King arrived at FBI Headquarters. A

revious memorandum has been sent through reporting verbatim the comments by King

;CTION:

It is suggested that the attached letter be sent to the President concerning

The General Investigative Division, Civil Pights Section, should take

I lully agree that this work should eventually be done, particularly

Il an additional controversy arises with King. I see no necessity, however, in this

work being done at the present time inasmuch as the controversy has quieted down

considerably and we are not in need of transcriptions right now. In view of the

I would recommend that we hold off doing this tremendous amount of work until there

POSSIBLE APPEARANCE BEFORE

IN JUXE, 1965, MIAMI BEACH, FLORDA SAmage BRAl y

You will recall that shortly after the Directo interview with the

women reporters, Dr. Robert S. Denny, -

Associate General Secretary of the

Baptist World Alliance (SWA) and a personal friend of SAC.

Benjamin Fulton,

•contacted Fulton concerning King. Dr. Denny pointed out that the Program

Committee of BIA had been encouraged by some members to invite King to

speal, at the 1965 Congress in June next year at Miami Beach. About one half of

the Program Committee members nbiected, pointing out that it was their feeling

if Director Hoover had publicly identified King as a "notorious liar, " there must

certainly must be even worse derogaiory information concerning him which wools!

make his appearance on the program questionable. You instructed SA Fulton to

furnish Dr. Denny the general facts relating to King'sc-

this basis and without revealing the details and source, Dr. Denny was avie to

get the King matter tabled at that time.

On 12-7-64, DI. Denny again contacted Fulton and advised that

the matter has been brought up again.

He pointed out that while he objects to

having King on the program and has made his position known, unless he is able

to share the information with at least Dr. Joseffitordenhaug, the General Secreial

of BilA, and perhaps one other program official, either Dr. Theodore F. Adams,

Program Committee Chairman and minister of the First Baptist Church of

Richmond, Virginia, or perhaps Dr. E. . Pruden, minister of the First Sapsist

Church of Washington, -D. C., and a prominent Icader in the American Baptist

Convention, it is unlikely that he can keep the Program Committee froin extendin;

King an invitation.. He would like for us to make the general facts relating to

King's moral degeneracy, similar to what we told him, known to Dr. Nordenhaug

and either Dr. Adams or Dr. Pruden, whichever is available. Dr. Denny aávise

Ilsked to shor that king's current policies remarkably

parallel comunist ef orts.

This nould cause extreme

embarrassnent to King. Further, it is felt that since the

position and paths taken by king and his group closely

parallel that advocated by the Connunist Party, this fact

should be made known to the public.

similar coverage on the residence of Nartin Luther King, JI., President

The Attorney General is apparently still vacillating in his

it being recalled that he had initially suggested such coverage and then

SECURITY MATTER - C

BOBA

The Attorney General was contacted at his request this after -

noon. He had before him our memorandum of October 7, 1963, requesting

authority for technical surveillances on Nartin Luther King at his residence

at Atlanta and at the office of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference,

of which he is president, at New York City.

The Attorney General said that he recognized the importance of

this coverage if substantial information is to be developed concerning the

relationship between King and the Communist Party. He said there was no

question in his mind as to the coverage in New York City but that he was

nworried about the security of an installation covering a residence in Atlanta,

Georgia. He noted that the last thing we could afford to have would be a

discovery of a wire tap on King's residence.

I pointed out to the Attorney General the fact that a residence

was involved did not necessarily mean there was any added risk because of

the technical nature of the telephone system. He was informed that the

Bureau had had years of experience in this field and that we continually

Oreviewed our procedures to insure that every measure possible to secure

such installations was taken. It was nevertheless noted that of necessity

"gwe had to deal with established contacts in the telephone company to get the

necessary leased lines, but once again we had procedures which minimized

the risks to the nth degree.

BEG ?!

B MOY 7 1953

After this discussion the Attorney General said he felt we

should go ahead with the technical coverage on King or a trial-basis, and to

continue it if productive results were forthcoming. He said he was certain

that all Bureau representatives insolved would recognize the delicacy of this

particular matter and would thus be even more cautious than ever in this

assignment. He asked to be kept advised of any pertinent information

developed regarding King's communist connections.

Notes.

Gordy

1014

The Attorney General orally informed me today that he had been

considering the request he made on July 16, 1963, for a technical surveil-

• lance on Martin Luther King at his home and office and was now of the

opinion that this would be ill advised..

At the time the Attorney General initially asked for such a

surveillance, he was told there was considerable doubt that the

productirity of the surveillance would be worth the risk beczuse King

travels most of the time and that there might be serious repercussions

should it ever become known the Gorernment had instituted this coverage.

These were the very thoughts that the Attorney General expressed today

in withdrawing his request.

With reference to the other technical surveillance requested

at the same time, namely, the one on Clarence Benjamin Jones, the

Attorney General feli this vas in a different fategory and we should go

iorward with this coverage. It is noted that this was previously approved

in mriting by the Attorney General.

The memorandum we sent to the Attorney General on

July 23, 1963, requesting authority for the King surveillance has been

retriered and is attached.

ACTION TO BE TAKEN:

We will take no further action to effect technical coverage on

Itartin Isther King; either at his home or at his office at the Southern

from the Attorney General.

12/23/63 betreen Bureau officials and Supervisors and field repre-

et neutralizing liartin luther ling, dr., as an ellective regro leacer.

One of the avenues explored was that concerning any facets of the

: Linahcial operations of king and the organizations through which he

¡ operates thich investigation right reveal esther violations of the

nan or other potentials for ciscreditius lins or otheruise neutrulizin

"is erfectiveness

Buffles contain tro sters of particular significance. A

Washington Capital liens Service release dated 10/22/63 reveals that

King's integration organization had an income of nore than $735,000

during the past fiscal year and spent only about half of 1t. It is

stated that in a report of the financial status of the Southern Chris-

tian Leadership Conference (SCLC), of which king is president, King

I disclosed that the organization had a balance of $351,992.20 left

8/31/63 at the end of the fiscal year fron a total income of $735, 554.02

Another such news release dated 11/4/63 revealed that representative

George AndreTs (D-Al2.) asked the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to

Investigate the tir. status of the SCLC. Andrews is quoted as saying,

"Thousands and thousards of dollars are collected and spent each year:

by so-called civil rigats organizations and nany people are beginning

to suspect they could be a front for a full-grown racket."

FITA

It 1s noted that King's operations revolve principally arouna,

the SCLe.

however, tund-raising operations on his part are further aug.

nented by the activities of the gandhi society for hunan Rights, rhich

ORSERV&TIONS:

It 1s believed that an examination of recent incone tz.

returns of ling might well reveal information which could assist the

Bureau in its efforts to discredit king or neutralize his effective

Iness.

This 15 possibly epplicable also if the income tar returas of

the SCLC and the Gandhi Society were reviewed.

In view of the possi

bility that the SCLC has already been under some investization by IPs,

a request for the results of such investigation 1s indicated. Me 21so

had Information 1n late 1953 that the Gandhi Society vas negotiating

with IRs relative to tar exemptions and therefore the results of any

InS investigation of that society would be worth procuring faye

To date me have been most discreet and circunspect in our

hancling of the king investigation, as tell as corollary investiga-

tions such as revolving around organizations, beczuse of the position

King his not only as a clergican, but also as a "respected" legro

deader. It is therefore essential that our current requests of the

IPS which are herein being reconuended be handled in a manner which

I would provide for optimus security so that neither king nor any other

: unauthorized indivicuals may becone aware of the Bureau's interest

and so that no embarressment may come to the Bureau. For this reason,

the attached menoranda are classified "Secret."

RECOLITERDATION:

It 1s recormended that the Liaison Section obtain two

uncertified copies of each of the income tax returns available for

the past five years pertaining to king, the SCLC and the Gandhi

society.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS:

At a staff meeting recently, King announced

the Ford Foundation had granted his organization a quarter

of a million dollars. King did not state how this money 4

was going to be used.

OBSERVATIONS:

It is Interesting to note that King's group

will only get $250,000, a large sun, but considerably

smaller than the original amount. Perhaps our measures

had some effect in causing this reduction. In view of

King's current announcements indicating he will hold a

Camp-in at Washington, D. C., across from the White House,

It 1s felt the President would be extremely interested

In the source of these new funds being made available

to SCLC.

In order to be effective, 2,000 people must be

nationalist organizations' activities must be neutralized

in order that SCLC's demonstration will be successful.

King felt that if this program fails it would probably

Secretary are in agreement that steps will be taken to insure

that no further contracts will be awarded to King's group.

CONT

Contract Awarded

The Department of Labor recently approved a

contract in the amount of $61,000 negotiated by the Comm-

nity Action Group, Atlanta, Georgia, with the Southern

Christian Leadership Conference.

The contract provides

for on-the-job-training for Negroes with retail grocers.

The Southern Christian Leadership Conference will receive

$13,000 for administering the program and the grocers will

receive $48,000 for providing on-the-job-training.

Martin Luther King, JI., President, Southern

Christian Leadership Conference, was instrumental in es-

tablishing this program.

He contacted grocers and obtained

their assurance that they would set aside 15 percent of the

employment openings for on-the-job-training of Negro youths.

King Emotionally Upset

Martin Luther King, JI., recently completed a

• tour throughout the United States for the purpose of parti-

cipating in benefit programs to raise funds for the Southern

Christian Leadership Conference.

According to a confidential source of this Bureau,

King, while on the tour, experienced difficulty sleeping and

as a consequence he resorted to the use of sleeping pills.

The source stated that in one instance Kingvas scheduled to

depart by air at 9 A.M.; but due to having taken sleeping pills

the previous evening, "they" could not awaken King until 2 P.M.

the following afternoon.

variety show starring Harry Belafonte, well-known Negro

vocalist with a subversive background, to tour seven major

cities In the United States.

and clains his appaarance in Houston Is "an imposition on p).

the cormunity."

King is also referred to as "a misguided

"Moses' who has lost' himself."

clains King's position regarding the Vietnan war "borders

upon treason."

Further, "a man who will not fight for his

that DI. King's visit to Houston next

subterfuge. It Aretha Franklin, who is

now at the peak of fame, permits this

Mes. ALBERT B. (CAROL ANN) PEPPER, 2025 Bellevue,

stated her new unpublished telephone number

is 645-9152.

She was interviewed on May 10, 1968, by SAs HOWARD C.

KENNEDY and ALBERT J. RUSHING at which time she furnished

the lollowing information:

MrS. PEPPER is the sister of subject, JAMES EARL

RAY, but is 13 years younger than subject and in all of her

life has had very little contact or association with the

subject having seen him only aproximately three or four

times in her life. These three or four times when she has

seen him all occurred in the City of St. Louis after Mrs.

PEPPER came to St. Louis when she was 16 years old to reside

with her father in St. Louis and all of the occasions when

she saw the subject were brief encounters such as when she

saw him on the street.

She believes the last time she saw

the subject was probably in 1959 or earlier when. she en-

countered him on the street in South St. Louis at which time

she

was in the company of their brother, FRANK (BUZZY) RAY,

who is now deceased.

Her first recollection of seeing him

was following his discharge from military service.

Mrs: PEPPER was born January 30,

1941, at Ewing,

Missouri.: She went to school at Quincy, Illinois, where..:

she resided with her mother, LUCILLE RYAN. MrS. PEPPER'S

birth certificate showed her name as RAYNES which she under-

stands. is an incorrect spelling of the name. of her father,

: -=

whose game is RAYNS and who now resides near Center,:

Missouri, to which location he recently moved from St. Louis,

CAROL RYAN; the same surname used by her mother, LUCILLE.

RYAN. Mrs. PEPPER is unable to account for the variations

in the surnames and she is aware that. various ones of her

brothers and sister have used the surname RAY. So far as

she knows they all had the same father although she expressed

uncertainty in that regard and she assumes that the varia-

tions of the name are simply because her brothers and sisters

decided to use the name RAY, a variation of the name RAYNs.

When Mrs. PEPPER vas 16 years of age, she left

her mother's residence in Quincy and came to St. Louis where

she lived with her father at 1727 South llth Street. She did

jobs including a period of employment at kresge's, a dime

She is not now employed.

Her last

employment having been by the Catholic Archdiocese in St. Louis

as a teacher in the Head Start Program which was conducted at

St. Joseph's School on South 12th Street in St. Louis.

The

later employment was for a period of about one year during the

latter' part of the residence of Mr. and Mrs. PEPPER at 712a

Shenandoah, St. Louis, from which address they moved to their

present address in the

Haplewood in about October, 1967.

Sometime after Mrs. PEPPER came to St. Louis at the

age of lo years to reside with her father, hermother also came

to St. Louis and resided with Mrs. PEPPER'S maternal grand-

mother, MARY MAHER, at 1913 Hickory, St. Louis.

MrS. PEPPER

however, did not at any time actually reside in St. Louis

with her mother, although she occasionally spent briel periods

Mrs. PEPPER and her husband have two children,

last such letter she-wrote to him but the last time may have

been as late as the early part of 1967.

her husband didnt ever visit him at the penitentiary.

She

advised she has understood from her husband that the latter

has never seen the subject in his life.

Mrs. PEPPER has not at any time had any contact

either direct of indirect with the subject since his escape

in 1967 from the Missouri State Penitentiary.

She has no

knowledge of any person who has had information regarding the

subject's whereabouts and stated she could furnish no such

information regarding his whereabouts.

She, herself, first

learned

that he had escaped from the penitentiary when she

heard it on the radio and she knew nothing about any plans

for the escape. She stated she has had no indication that

anyone in her family or otherwise has been in any way in

contact with the subject or had information regarding his

• whereabouts since his escape.

Inquiry was made of Mrs. PEPPER regarding whether.

she recalled anything about the receipt of a money

order

in approximately January, 1967, which was reportedly in the

amount of $15.00 and was sent by an inmate at the Missouri

State Penitentiary to the ALBERT PEPPER Stationery Company,

712a Shenandoah, St. Louis. : :.

In response to direct questions concerning this

matter, she advised that she may have received a money order

on one occasion but to the best of her recollection, it was

for $2.00 or $3.00 and it may have been in payment for maga-

zines which her brother had requested she mail to him. 'It

was her recollection that if she received a money order it

was received earlier than January, 1967. She said she never

at any time mailed magazines to him and doesnot recall what

disposition she may have made of any money order after it.:

was received. Later in the interview she said the money order.

may have been for as much as $15.00 but she does not recall.

She also acknowledged that she might have cashed such a money

order but she cannot specifically remember having done so.

In this connection, she said her memory is very vague.

In response to soliciting by interviering agents,

MrS. PEPPER stated that she would be entirely willing to notify

the St. Louls Office of the FBI if she should at any time in

She also stated that she would be

should be any additional matters on which an interview with

her would be desired.

PEPPER said that her first knowledge of the

subject's involvement in this matter was when she heard the

news announcement on the radio and she said she has never

had any information regarding the possible involvement other

than that which has apeared in the news media.

She said she

had never known of anything in her brother's attitude or

associations which would suggest any motive lor his involve-

ment in the killing of a Negro leader such as MARTIN LUTHER

KING.

Mrs. ALBERT (CAROL) PEPPER, 2925 Bellevue, Maplewood,

Missouri, was

interviewed at her residence, at which time she.

furnished the following information:

Mrs. PEPPER has received no information regarding

her brother,

JAMES EARL RAY (whome she refers to as JIM),

since the last previous interview with her by the FBI.

Within the past several days, police officers from

the St. Louis Police Department came to see Mrs. PEPPER indi-

cating to her that they had received some inquiry from a

newspaper, possibly "The

Los Angeles Times" according to Mrs.

PEPPEr's recollection of what they said; this inquiry having

to do with the finances of the RAY family.

The police officers

apparently came to see Mrs.

PEPPER just to find out some general

Information about her, and

they suggested to her that if people

wanted to talk to her

about her finances, she might want to

obtain a

lawyer.

A representative of "The St.. Louis Post

Dispatch" newspaper also came to see Mrs. PEPPER within the

preceding few days, but she refused to talk to him.

Mrs.

PEPPER has heard from an acquaintance that there was an article

a few days ago in "The St. houis Post Dispatch" which seemed

to be a rehash of the erroneous information which appeared in

a "Life Magazine" article concerning the Ril family, but Mrs.

PEPPER herself did not read this newspaper article.

Mrs. PEPPER and her family went to see her father

may be correct that she gave him a check drawn on her account

She did not hersell pay for any part of the purchase of the

farm by her

father, and if she gave hin the check for $1,900,

this was a return of his money or & loan.

While Mrs. PEPPIR'S lather resided in 3t. Louis

pefore the purchase or ine larm at Cester, Missourt, he had

various jobs, such as, service station attendant, and he also

at one time operated a second-hand store there be soid junk.

This business was also located on sark avenue, but was some-

where east of tweilth Street, a considerable distance from

1319 Park. Her tather did not own the property where he con-

ducted this second hand business.

Until Mr.

and airs. PErpsh moved to their present

residence in the fall or 1957, Mrs. PROPER yas always employed

ever since their marriage in December ol 1961. During that

period of time,

they have practiced thrift and econony and

have always endeavored so save sonething iron their income.

They opened a savings account several years ago at the

Bohemian Savings and loan Associztion on South Eighteenth

street in St. Loris ir the same area were they resided.

fow years ago when the Bohenian Savings and Loan Association

was noved to a remote section of the city, they transferred

their savings account to the Manufacturers Bank and Trust

Company, where they have cortinued to have a joint savings

account. ALBERT PEPPER has been enployed lor more than three

years by the Ace construction and Engineering Company, which

is affilicated with the Hey Harket Hardware Store.

by the Catholic Archdiocese being paid at the rate of $60 per

week.

She had this employment for arout a year until Mr. and

Mrs.

PEPPER moved in the fall of 1967 to their present address.

Her last employment before that was in cleaning work ät an

office building at 1015 Locust in St. Louis. Because she and

her husband have always endeavored to be economical and saving

accumulate funds in their savings account.

When they con-

tracted in the fais of 1967 to surchase the nouse were they

now ilve for a purchase price of S10, 100, they withdrew the

necessary money for the downpayment from their savings account.

Mrs. PEPPER has no idea and no krowledge as to whether

her father may ever have given Mrs. PEPPER'S brother, JOHN LARRY

RAY, any lunds to hold for her father.

Mrs. PEPPER has so infornation regarding a trip to

California made by her brother, JOny LARRY RAY, in the summer

of 1967 and never knew or heard that he made such a trip.

One of the places in St. Louis where Mrs. PEPPER

lived with her father prior to her narriage was 1727 South

Eleventh Street. She believes her brother BUZZY lived with

then there part of the time, but she is certain that her

brother JIM never lived with them there. Mrs. PaPPER never

had any knowledge of her brother JIM having used the name

O'CONNOR, and she never knew of any bank accounts he may have

had at any bank at any time. In fact, airs. PEPPER nad so

little contact or kncwledge of her brother JIM that she can

now recall having seez him only on possibly a couple of occa-

Sions when she was anall and shortly after he vas discharged

from military service, and she recalls seeing rim on ore occa-

she noved to St. Louis with her father.

Although Mrs. PEPPER

was known as CAROL RYAN as of 1959, she has no knowledge or

recollection of having received any checks from her brother

JIM or from any person under the name JAMES CARL O'CONNOR,

either in 1959 or any other time. She can think of no reason

Mrs. ALBERT (CAROL) PEPPER, 2025 Bellevue,

Maplewood, Missouri, advised that she had received no

additional information whatever bearing on the possible.

location of her brother, JAMES EARL RAI, since she was last

interviewed.

Inquiry was made of Mrs. PEPPER as to whether, in

the event she should receive some pertirent information

regarding her brother, she would furnish such information to

the Federal Bureau of

Investigation (FBI).

kES. PEPPER

then stated that she would have no expectations whatever that

her brother would communicate with her in any way, pointing

out that he did not know her current address or her current

unpublished-telephone-number

She added that she felt that

he did not believe that he could expect any help from her and she

said that, as a matier of fact, she mould not be at al

interested or willing to help him as she did not want herseli

and particularly her children to be in any way involved with

him.

She said that if she should hear from RAY and be convinced

of his innocence she might find it difficult to furnish such

information to the FBI.

It was pointed out to M's. PEPPER that

in the event RAY should be innocent or there should be any

extenuating circumstances the entire ratter would in any event

be most readily resolved through locating RAY at the earliest

possible time. Mrs. PEPPER expressed understanding and agree-

ment with this idea.

Inquiry was made of Mrs. PEPPER as to her whereabouts

and activities during the period betreen April and July, 1967.

She said she was living at that period of time with her

husband and two children at 712-a Sherardoah,

st.

louis. She

recalled that beginning in about the sumer

of 1966 and

ending in about July or August, 1967, she was employed as a

teacher's aide or assistant teacher in the "Head Start Program"

at St. Joseph's School located at Iwelfth and Russell Streets,

St. Louis.

In. this employment she worked regularly during

that period on Monday through Friday, each week, during the

hours of 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 or 4:30 p.I. daily.

She was paid for her work by check from the Archdiocese,

although she understood that at least some of the funds

the "Head Start Program" were furnished the Archdiocese by

the Human Development Corporation.

Mrs. PEPPER recalled

that she missed only one day from work during the entire

period of her employment and that day was due to the illness

of her youngest child.

MrS. PEPPER said her first knowledge of the escape

of her brother, JAMES EARL RAY, from the Missouri State

Penitentiary was when she heard or read news reports regarding

the escape but she is unable to recall the approximate time

she heard such reports. However, since reported identification

of RAY as the alleged assassin of MARTIN LUTHER KING, MIS.

PEPPER

has heard or read reports to the effect that his

escape from the penitentiary was not officially reported or

given publicity for perhaps several weeks after the escape

occurred.

Mrs. PEPPER, therefore, assumed that she herself

would not have learned

of the escape from news reports, until

perhaps several weeks after the escape.

by personal correspondence with her oldest brother, JAMES EARL

RAY, since about eight or nine years ago, prior to the time he

escaped from the Missouri State Penitentiary (MSP), Jefferson

CLEY, MISSOUrI•

Her only contact with JAES EARL RAY while he

was incarcerated there was via mail.

She admitted having written

to him under the name of her grandmother who died after RAY vas

confined to the penitentiary.

she nor know where her brother spent the time between about

April 23, 1967, when he escaped from the MSP and July 196%, when

heard the same news on television.

Although she has saved most

of the local papers for each day since that time, she has not read

Irom more than one or two of them about her brother.

The news

is, of course, upsetting and she has formed an opinion that in

many instances information is grossly exaggerated and misrepresented.

She is somewhat bitter towards the local press, advising that CHRIS

on Monday, June 10, 1968, requesting an interview with her..

ALBERT, JR., and JAMES, ages 6 and 4 respectively.

SUTTON stated that she did not know any of CAROLS'

brothers or sisters and did not know if she even had any.

She stated that she last saw CAROL sometime in August

of last year, and the only thing she could remember about any

type of conversation about her family was something to the

effect that her father was going to buy or did buy a farm up

around Hannibal, Missouri, and that he probably would let her

children go to the farm.

She said that it was probably in

Fannibal, but she was not sure.

He recalled ERIC GALT as a dancing student

who enrolled at National Dance Studio during the first

week of December 1967, and who subseguchily guit taking

lessons quite abruptly on approximately February 12, 1958.

ARVIDSON stated that during this period of time

he had several occasions to talk with GALT and on at least one

occasion he interviewed GALI for approximately two hours,

in an attemot to benefit him socially through his dance lessons

at the stuaio.

Through his conversations with GALT, ARVIDSON

stated that he was told by GALl that he had been in Mexico

and as he, ARVIDSON, recalled he believed it was in the

early dart of 1967.

ARVIDSON stated that he believed GALT

informed him that he owned a restaurant in Mexico City.

ARVIDSON

stated that he spoke Spanish fluently and when he

conversed with GALT in Spanish, GAiT did not reply, leading

ARVIDSON to believe

that GALI was not conversant to any degree

in that language.

ARVIDSON stated that GAlT used rather

poor language, leading him, ARVIDSON, to believe that he had

achieved education no higher than high school.

ARVIDSON recalled that he never saw GALT in any

attire other than shirt and tie. He often wore a very

expensive pair of alligator shoes which ARVIDSON believed were

loafer cut.

GALT told him sometime during their conversations

that he was a merchant seaman and that he very much desired

to return to the sea.

Upon terminating his dance instructions, GAIT.

instructions were conflicting with his desires to

attend bartending school..

ARVIDSON stated that GALT was somewhat backward

socially and was a poor dancing student because he was

ill at ease with others.

GALI could never seem to relax

while in a mixed group or around other people.

ARVIDSON

recalled that GALT was driving a white automobile, make

and model unrecalled by ARVIDSON.

ARVIDSON stated since GALI was a student for

such a shost period of time he did not obtain a photograph

of him, which was customary for all. students enrolled in the

dance studio.

GALI did not smile readily, was pleasant

but very evasive.

He would not talk about himself

at all and would not look the individual he was conversing

with in the eye. He was bashful and a true introvert

and smiled with

a crooked smile.

TO ARVIDSON's

recollection; GALT never appeared at the dance studio

with any associates,

male or female.

ARVIDSON stated that he was of the opinion

--..

that GALI was a complete loner,

was transient, although

he seemed to have money.

ARVIDSON recalled that in each

instance when GALI paid

for dance instruction as agreed,

he removed a roll of bills from his trouser pocket and

paid his account as agreed.

ARVIDSON stated that ARDELLE, a part-time dancing

employee, instructed GAIT more than any othes of the

National Dance Studio employees.

She stated that she recalled one ERIC S. GALT.

as a former student whom she instructed. She stated that

as she recalled, GALI was her dancing pupil icom about

the first week

in December 1907 through approximately the

middle of February 1960.

In recalling GALT, she offered the following

information concerning him:

She said that GALI was a very neat person and

that he dressed immaculately, often in expensive clothes.

He always appeared at the dance studio cleanly shaven,

wearing white shirt and tie, and either a sport coat

and slacks or a suit. She stated he also owned an

expensive looking pair of alligator loafess, which he often

wore with a sport suit. She stated that his hands were very

well kept, and his nails may have been professionally

manicured, but she could not state this with absolute

certainty. she stated, however, that she had never seen

his hands soiled of his

Iingernails dirty. His ringernails

were well filed and trimmed and were worn short and neat.

She stated that he was left handed inasmuch as she had

noticed him on two occasions writing, and at the time she

poserved him writing, she made a mental note that he was a

"south paw."

GALT was very ill at ease in crowds and gave

her the impression that he prefers to be either alone or

with no more than one other individual. He was an

introvest and was very hard to converse with.

She stated

that in the approximate two months that she knew ham,

only towards the last did he feel confident enough with

her that he would joke with her.

She stated that toward

the end he showed somewhat of a humor, which she believed

very few people knew he had. He was

always ill at ease

around others and could not relex while in conversation

with any other indiviaual. He always fidgeted, pulled at

his ears, played

with his hands, and looked in every

direction but at

the person with whom he was conversing.

She stated that he smiled with a one-sided smile and that

he smiled very infrequently.

He would never talk about himself, but in general

conversations she was led to believe that he came to Los

Angeles from Mexico, possibly around Mexico City, He told

her that he was unemployed; was a former merchant seaman;

that he wished to return to sea, and that he received

suiiicient proceeds Iron the sale of a bar that he coulo

"get along without being gainfully employeà."

lone, but nie bo knaces sevented in Fron

actually doing so.:

During the dancing lessons he always

centered his conversations around dancing techniques and

never talked in general terms about himself.

She believes

he was a Southerner, and she recalled that possibly the

first or second week during January 1968, he did not attend

dancing instriction, and upon his return,

stated that he had

visited a brother in the State of Louisiana. RHOADS stated

that during

the two month period that she knew GALI, he

changed residences twice in Hollywood, Califomia.

She

at no time associated with GALT socially.

She was not

acquainted with any of his associates, and through

conversations, Gall told her that he nad no particular

"hobby.

She stated

oat GALT seemed to compensate

for

his social inaptness by his attire and placing his

schedule on precise projects which he was participating in.

As an example, she stated that GALI took dancing

lessons she believed

to overcome some of his shyness. He

pursued the dancing lessons quite vigorously, doubling up

on the number of

lessons nornally taught per week so as to

take the maximum number of lessons in the shortest possible

time.

He abruptly quit dancings

telling her that he had

enrolled in bartending school and was having a conflict in

his schedule.

RHOADS was of the opinion that he had toyed with

his dancing lessons sufficiently to

satisfy himself and

"running off on another tangent."

She also stated

that GALt was not surficiently busy she believed to have not

pursued both courses, because GALT told her that he slept

rather late, had lunch, took a nap in the early aiternoon,

went to bariending school in the late afternoon, and would

then attend dancing lessons in the early evening. This,

he explained to her, was his typical day, which was not

a

busy, productive, or strenuous one in her mina.

processes. He often did not understand jokes and did not

react favorably to a friendly gosture extended to him.

RHOADS stated that during one conversation with GALT she

made mention that it was odd that he did not wear any

Jewelry, that is ring or watch, since he was so well dressed

otherwise. GALI replied that he detested jewelry of any sort,

and to her knowledge, she never saw him wear a watch, ring,

or cuff links, or any other items of jewelry.

RHOADS COUld remember nothing else of the

mannerisms, background, etc. of GALT. She stated that GALT

was a white male, weighing about 165 pounds. She stated

that he had brown hair; was in his middle 30s; heû a medium

complexion, and spoke with a Southern accent.

She stated

that from his diction she believed hin to be high school

eaucated. Io her knowledge, he spoke no foreign language.

RAY has no close friends at the club; however, in

the past has filled in for other employees of the club

in addition to his own duties when the employees wanted time

off and needed someone to work in their place. He at no time

spoke of other members of his family other than to say that

he had a brother that was a bartender in the St. Louis area

and she had no idea that RAY was incarcerated in the past.

Her records revealed that RAY worked steadily during the

night at the Sportsman Country Club from Wednesday evening,

April 3, 1968, through Monday, April 8, 1968, without

having any time off.

She is of the opinion that RAY is not cooperating

with the FBI in every respect, does not feel that some of the

questions asked of him are important enough

for him to give

any thought in answering; however, it could be that due to

his low mental condition that he is not capable of answering

On the evening of May 3, 1968, DAVID/ALLEN,

1929 Washington Avenue, Hilmette,

I111nois, phone AL 1-5761,

advised sA RiNE J. DUMAINE that JERRY RAY-was formerly

married to a friend of his wife's.

He said that according

to his wife, approximately one year ago in April, 1967,

the subject

was with JERRY RAy and his wife in Northbrook,

Illinois.

Mrs. LINDA ALLEN alSO telephonically advised that

ghe had attended school with Mrs. GJERDIS RAY, who is present-

Iy residing at 314 Wisconsin Avenue, Lake Forest, Illinois.

MrS. ALIEN related that Mrs. RAY had told her that

sometime in April, 1967, a brother had stayed with JERRY RAY

when she and JERRY were residing at 2897 Techay Road,

Northbrook,

I111no1s (from March to September, 1967).

The -

brother stayed there for approximately one week and that

although she, LINDA, rented a house in Northbrook, Illinois,

next to RAY,

she never physically observed the brother.

She did remember that GUERDIS had told her that JERRY and

the brother would go to Chicago on numerous occasions but

would not, take her with them.

Mrs. Aluch advised that one

neighbor who was residing there at the time still lives

there in the house to the west of where the RAYs used to

live.

She did not know whether or not the landlord was

still in the area but that information could be obtained

from the ex-landlord.

The following investigation was conducted by

SA ROBERT K. MC QUEEN and SA O. ARTHUR GRAN:

She and JERRY separated six months ago, and she later got

& divorce.

She has since lived by herself and not at her:

"parental" home because Mr. and Mrs. OLSEN are "jed up"

and did not approve of her chasing around, staying out late,

etc.

Mr. and Hrs. OLSEN had become attached to the baby,

and visited GIERDIS and the

baby a few times at Northbrook,

at the place on Techny Road. OLSEN SaW JERRY RAY a feW

of those times but did not like him because once OLSEN

got stuck in the snow right outside the Techny address, and

JERRY would not "even bother to help push" him out. OLSEN

never met any relatives of JERRY RAY and first knew that

JERRY had a brother, JAMES RAY, when he read it in the

newspapers a few weeks ago.. GJERDIS never mentioned having

wet JAlES, and OLSEN was unaware of a visit by one of the

RAY brothers to the Techny Road address.

He recalled that

shortly after they were married, JERRY RAY and GUERDIS went

tO MissOuri tO see JERRy's relatives with the intention.

of living there but he heard no more about this.

OLSEN concluded that be feels there is something

wrong mentally with GJERDIS, who just moved from Lake Forest

to a motel in Des Plaines and who istorking as a waitress...

at the kopper kettle, Highland Park.

Mrs. OLSEN works as

a babysitter at the J. D. SIMMONS residence, B2724 Birchwood

LaDe, Highland Park, phone 945-5029.

Interviewed separately kay 7, 1968, at B2724 Birchwood

Lane, kirs. PAUL OLSEN verified generally what her husband

had said and added that GERDIS 1s highly nervous and emotional,

takes pills and is under doctor's care, principally because

of the strain of having placed her baby out for adoption

last summer in an attempt to preserve her marriage with

JERRY RAY.

She said GJERDIS, who was born April 12, 1948,

married JERRY RAY In Chicago

in about January, 1957, and they

first lived at Arlington Heights before moving to 2897 Techny

Road, Northbrook.

Before GJERDIS and JERRY were separated

In the fall of 1967, Mrs. OLSEN visited them about three

Itmes, but

at no time saw any of JERRY's relatives.

When. the de

papers related, much to her surprise, a few weeks ago that::

• JAMES RAY and

JERRY RAY were brothers, she recalled the following

## Page 690

CG 44-1114

RJD: Jap

two incidents, the dates of which she could not precisely

place:

The first was GIERDIS' relating to her about the .

I trip she and JERRY-took to St. Louis where JERRY visited a

brother and his father who lived near there. GUERDIS tOLd

of "waiting in a theater" for JERRY while he went with his

brother a: some sort of mission.

This trip was shortly

after the marriage, probably in

the early spring of 1967,

which Hrs. OLSEN related to a time when GJERDIS had just

quit working for Culligan's in Arlington or Northbrook.

The other incident concerned a phone call GJERDIS

made to hrs. OLSEN from Northbrook, ' in which she said' that

"something funny" was going on because she, GJERDIS, had

discovered some strange clothes left in the garage by

JERRY's brother from St. Louis; further, that this brother

had taken JERRY'S caI and left.

GUerDis told Mrs. OLSEN

that she "just don't understand" and that she had not

really seen the brotber.

"hen the publicity about JakEs EARL RAY came out,

and they chose to assume that it was brother JAMES who

was there at the time.

Hirs. OLSEN concluded that she is certain that

GUERDIS has never in her life seen JAMES EARL RAY frOM what

she has told and indicated to ber (Mrs. OLSEN). She

cautioned that. GJERDIS' mind would "wander" when agents.

talked with her and she would not be able to recall spectlic

dates and places.

It is noted that Mrs. OLSEN as well as her husband

pledged complete cooperation and said they would immediately

contact the iBI should they hear or learn, any information

re subject.

GUERDIS DOROTHRA ANNA OLSEN (she has again assumad

her maiden name), date of birth April 12, 1948, at St. Paul,

Minnesota, who would Irequently go off on unexplained

tangents in response to questions, was interviewed outside

ber place of employment, Ropper Kettle, Routes 41 and 22,

Highland Park.

She said she had been

"expecting" agents,

that she really had no "good" information, but that she.

would cooperate in any way. She advised as Lollows:

Since May 4, 1968, she has beenresiding at Randel's

Motel, Apartnent 12, Des Plaines, but intends to move in the

near future to Haukegan.

She drives a 1962 Plymouth with

1968 Illinois license HK 6917. She married WILLIAM STREET,

Wundelein, Illinois, August 31, 1966, and, gave birth to his

baby October 13, 1966.

She divorced

him in Chicago in about

January, 1967, alter

having met JERRY RAY who was working

at Sportsmans.

In about Christmas, 1966, she and JERRY

.:

went to st. Louis and visited his father and his sister,.

MELBA, and her husband.

There was another man there, probably

a brother, but she never heard his name.

She first knew of

a brother, JOHN, when in early 1967, at the Techny Road

"...

address, she happened to see a clipping in which it

was

mentioned that JOHN RAY was in some kind of trouble. She

never talked to JERRY about this, however, and she never knew

there was a JAMES RAY until after it "came out in the

papers."

She has seen numerous pictures of JAMES RAY since

and"is quite sure" she has never seen him beiore.

As to

ser waiting in a theater in st. Louis, she responded only

that she did go to a movie one time rather than go with

JERRY on some sort of errand.

After the publicity about JAMES, she and her mother

racalled the incident wherein a brother from St. Louis, name

unknown to her, came and left some clothes and his car.

This brother was about 45, had dark hair like JERRY, but was

not jALES.

She and her mother figured it was out april,

1967, when this occurred. The brother came driving a 1961

red Plymouth tudor,

with white top, and be traded cars with

JERRY, taking JERRY's 1963 or 1964

She did not see bin again.

JERRY

was to have been sent the title for the 1961 Plymouth but

later he took this car back to St. Louis and left it and

got the car which he is now driving.

GUERDIS, who had to return to work at her boss'

request, concluded that she would be available at any time

for further interview, but she was very certain "I have never

Seen JAMES. " She said

JERRY has been ruined by the publicity

and she mould like to "find him" to talk to him and "settle

him down."

As he unpacked the magazines, JERRY RAY said i

"Just between you and me, I saw my brother right after

he escaped. He had a meeting place where he would meet on my

days off."

Ray did not say il these alleged meetings occurred

after bis escape from prison or after the murder of KING.

JERRY RAY also said he had visited his brother who

owns a tavern in St. Louis, Missouri, after the assassination

and before his first interview by the FBI. He stated that

before the FBI contacted him, he saw the photograph of an

individual identified as ERIC STARVO GAlt with his eyes closed.

He recognized this man as being identical with his brother JAMES

EARL RAY.

JERRY RAY said if he told the FBI everything he knows,

"with all of their resources" they

mould be able to "track him

- down." He stated, "I do not know where he is right now.

I do

not think I'll ever see him alive again." He explained his

brother would probably not permit himself to be captured alive.

JERRY RAY added that he did not want the subject apprehended

because of the additional bad publicity it would result in for

*the RAY family.

RAY further said he does not refer to the

subject since the assassination by his real name but calls him

STARVO OF GALI. He did not explain way he does this.

RAY also said, "I tell the FBI only enough to keep

them off my back."

On 6/5/68, RAY speculated fe

that the

subject would probably flee the country to Mexico or Canada.

He also said the subject was too hot for him to be in touch

with now.

0n 6/6/68, в

asked JERRY RAY 11 his brother

-Shot KING: Be replied,

This is his business.

Ididn't ask

him.

If I was in his position and had 18 years to serve and

someone offered me a lot of money to kill someone. I didn't like

anyhow and get me out of the country, I'd do 1t."

L.

JERRY RAY, Hould not agree with him.

He did not further

explain this statement,

a advised.

RAY said he now carries a gun from his room to his

car.

He keeps the gun in the trunk of his car.

When he walks

to his room from his car, he removes the gun from the car's

trunk and takes it with him.. He said he carries the weapon

for personal protection.

RAY said the subject is a supporter of Presidential

Candidate GEORGE WALLACE.

He said the subject once drove a man

to Alabama from possibly the California area so he could vote

LOI HALLACE.

He then identified this man by his photograph.

waich appears in the 5/3/68, issue of "Life"" It 1s noted E

sald the magazine states this man's name 15 CHARLES

STEIN.

JERRY RAY, Las

Con did not say when

the trip to alabama occurred.

JERRY RAY said he was considering moving his residence

again to a place where the press and possibly the FBI would be

unaware of.

He also said he was thinking of beginning to use

the alias of JERRY RYAN. He then displayed a ner Illinois

driver's license in the name of JERRY RYAN. He said he recently

obtained that license for his own use. He did, not further

explain why he might change his address and begin to use an

allas. He did not say he intended to leave. his present job.

On 6/7/68, Lie

i said on 6/6/68,

asked JERRY RAY if be thought his brother shot KING: RAY

replied by pointing out if he were in his brother's position

of having an 18 year sentence to serve once he was apprehended

and someone offered him money to kill someone he did not like

and thereafter be able to leave the country, he would do 1t.

RAY further volunteered at this point the subject might have

fled

..to canada or Mexico.

He did not say anything further

about where he thought the subject was.

Then

asked JERRY RAY where the subject

got the money to buy

instant white Mustang with.

JERRY RAY

replied, "They gave him part of the money. He put the money

in a safety deposit box, but: when he left, he drew it all out.

It broke his heart to have to leave the white Hustang."

with other business inasnuch as there has been no

authority from the Bureau for Agents to be present

observing such activities.

It is, of coirse, necessary

that your office maintain sufficient close liaison with

law enforcement agencies to be made currently aware of

all developments; however, without specific Bureau

authority, Agents should not observe demonstrations as

a part of

intelligence-gathering activity.

Johnson has given assurance that he can talk to

It is felt it yould be desirable to have specist Ages

to the Archbishon the vast influence these individuals exert s..

In addition, Specizi Agent in Charge Johnson would

progress of Martin Luther King, JI., President, Southern

Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), to organize a massive

civil disobedience campaign in Washington, D. C., in the Spring

of 1968.

..

• BACKGROUND:

0N 3112184

...

King in the past has publicly announced he will

conduct a massive civil disobedience campaign he calls the

"Washington Spring Project" in early April, 1968, to pressure

Congress into passing legislation favorable to the Negro.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS:

King is currently holding the first of two workshops

from 2/19-23/68 at Miami, Florida. He has invited approximately

150 Negro ministers throughout the nation to attend this meeting.

The Ford Foundation recently gave King's organization a $230,000

grant to hold these workshops in an effort to devel op responsible

leadership in the Negro ghetto areas of the nation's major cities.

It has been determined that King plans to discuss the Washington

Spring Project at this workshop.

concerned about the success-of the program. He has instructed

his staff. to seriously consider whether or not they can

successfuily carry out the Project.

Leadership Conference,

who is scheduled to give the keynote

address at a fund-raising activity sponsored by Communist

Party-controlled freedomyays Associates, publishers oi the

magazine, "Freedomways," which is self-described as a

quarterly review of the Negro Freedom Movement.

objective is to show that King appears to be courting the.?

communists to bolster his forthcoming civil disobedience

campaign in Vashington, D. C., in the Spring of 1968.

• The communist

publication, "National Guardian,"

recently publicized the

fact. that King is to give the

keynote address at the 100th anniversary celebration of

the birth of the late W. E.B. DuBois, well-known regro

educator who joined the Communist Party, USA, at the age

Of 93.

This affair is scheduled to be held

on 2/23/68 in

Carnegie Hall, New York City, and is sponsored by Freedomways

Associates.

The main purpose of this affair is to raise

money to help finance "Freedomways" magazine, and informa-

tion has been received indicating that with King as the

keynote speaker the affair will undoubtedly be a financial

success.

Although no information has been received as to

the contents of king's speech, it is reasonable to assume

that he will comment on the matter with which he is primarily

his campaign of civil

disobedience planned for the Spring

concerned at the present time, namely 1968 in Washington, D. C.

RE: COSMUNIST PARTY, USA

100-3-101-35

It is believed that the publicity glven to King's appearance

at Carnegle Hall on 2/23/68 1n behalf of the concunist

2723/6014c be navee

publication, "Freedomsays," could serve to show King's

aflinity for the communist movement and, thereby, place his

planned civil disobedience campaign in the proper context.

The attached proposed article goes directly to

the heart of this matter. It is proposed that this article

be relèased 'to appropriate sources in the mass news media

field through the Crime Records Division.

The proposed

article raises the questionas to whether King is courting

the communists, to bolster his civil disobedience campaige.

In this connection, it is pointed out that Hunter Pitts

(Jack) O'Dell, former close associate of King's in the

Southern Christian Leadership Conference, is one of the

editors of "Freedonways.". In 1963, King reluctantly released

O'Dell from his post in the Southern Christian Leadership

Conference. when if became publicly known that O'Dell was a

leading figure in the Communist Party. It is further

pointed out in the proposed article that the Communist Party,

with its years of experience in agitation and fomenting

conflicts, would be a powerful ally for King in his efforts

to promote civil disobedience in Washington, D. C.

RECOMMENDATION:

That this memorandum and the attached article be

routed to the Crime Records Division for release to

appropriate sources in the mass news media field.

The NYO has not received any indication,

about the contents of KING's speech…. Horever, It 1s

date,

reasonable to assume that he will comment on the two items

with which he is primarily concerned at the present time,

namely, the campaign of civil disobedience. which his.

organization, the SCIC, Is planning for the spring of 1968;

1n Washington; D.C., and the involvement of the United

States 1n the Vietnam war-which he opposes. " It is believed

that 1f publication 1s given to KING's appearance at Carnegie

Hall on 2/23/68, on behalf of "Freédomways";

linking It-with

his Washington; D.C: campaign, it could serve as a disruptive

measure adversely

allecting both "Freedonways" and KING's

spring project in washington; D.C." It is suggested that the

Bureau,

through Its contacts with the mass media, release the

following commundcation:

* Is MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. courting Red lavor to

bolster his civil disobedience campaign in Washington, 'D.&.?.

"Freedomways"

,. the communist-backea publication in the civil.

rights -field,

is nolding an allalr In New York City, to

raise money to help finance 1ts operation. This affair is

advertised as an observance of the 100th birthday of.

. *.

W.E.B. DU BOIS, the well-known Negro educator who flirted:

Cpipress, so it is understandable why, the l00th birthday

of W.E.B. DU BOIS: was chosen as the setting to raise funds

_that will ultimately benefit-the CP.

It is no coincidence that KING's old friend Irom the

SCIC, JACK O'DELL, Is one of the editors of "Freedomways"

Magazine. O'DELL, It 1s recalled, was reluetantly released

by KING from his post in the SCLC

in 1963, after it became

public knowledge

that O'DELL, a leading CP figure, was a

member of KING's hierarchy in the leadership of the ScIo.

The CP has only recently issued a new and more militant

line concerning the civil rights struggle in this sountry. The ..

Party would welcome any opportunity to involve itself in a progran

such as kniG has proposed for Washington, D.C. With its years of

experience in agitation and fomenting conflicts, the CP would be a

poweriul ally for KING in his efforts to promote civil disobedience

In the spring of 1968. It appears that he has chosen effectively

if not wisely.

King's Fund-raising Activities:

King told Jones that he would be in California 2/25-27/65 to atten

a big fund-raising project.

It will include a showing of the movie "The

Greatest Story Ever Told" and It would "scare the house of about $28,000."

In addition, there are two or three wealthy people trying to get 50 couple

to give §1,000 (presumably each couple) and they have 26 connitments

already. King claimed that his organization, the Southern Christian

Leadership Conference (SCIC), needs the money desperately. They also

discussed a group in New Rochelle, New York, which King said already bad

$5,000 and desired to use it for a fund-raising project to earn even more.

Jones told king that the advertisement which appeared in "The New York

Times" 2/5/65 soliciting funds on behalf of the SCIC cost $2,000. King sa

that his office had already received $12,000 as a result of this advertise

ment. U

Friction Between King and the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee •

(SNCC)

In discussing the current racial situation in Alabama, King told

Jones that SNCC was again saying that King likes to come into

a situation

ot the last minute, get all the publicity and the benefit of contributions

IC claims that King makes "grandstand plays" after SNCC has done all the

eld work. King asked Jones if something could be done about this throug

Harry Belafonte (noted Negro singer).

According to Jones, Belafonte is

about the only person that SNCC will

listen to and that he has heard

Belafonte stop

'SNCC workers who tried to attack king's integrity. King

said that he did not like for SNCC to fight against the idea of having a

leader for the whole novement. King stated that the movement must have a

leader bécause any ideology is fostered around having a leader around whor

supporters can rally.

Jones believes that he can arrange an unpublicized

meeting between sNCe,

SCIC and Belafonte.U '

Comment: The naked bolduess of King's egotism is vividly reflecte

in his pronouncements about the movement needing a leader (obviously King

himself). U

SPEAKER JOHN MC CORMACK

BRIEFING RE MARTIN LUTHER KING

SATURDAY, 8-14-65

AT 2 P.M

At his request, and with the Director's approval, I briefed

Speaker John McCormack regarding the backgrouná and activities of Martin

Luther King today in the Speaker's rooms.

The briefing lasted approximately 45 minutes. It covered King's

as well as his connections with members of the

-Communist Party. The identity of the members of the Communist Party tho

have had control over and association with King were brought out. The latest

incident in which King has advised the press that he will write a letter to

General Ho Chih Minh of the North Vietnamese, in an attempt to establish

himself as a "peacemaker" was related to Speaker McCormack. The commurisis

efforts back of this incident, and those individuals perpetrating the incident were

mentioned,

Speaker McCormack was quite calm about the entire briefing. He

stated he had heard much in the way of rumor previously; however, he wanted

to know if the information he had received was accurate.

He stated he now

recognized the gravity of the situation and that something obviously must be dòne

about it. He inquired as to whether the President knew these facts. I replie in

the affirmative.

The Speaker stated that he thought that "Edgar Hoover did not

call King a notorious liar for nothing. " He stated he now recognized why the

Director branded King as he did He added that he was in complete sympathy

with the Director taking this action

100-106670-1782

The Speaker spoke lengthily concerning the desperate need to

educate Negroes today with the fact that they cannot defy the law and get away

with it.

on february 16, 1968, Charles I, Cabbage

advised & representative of the Federal Bureau

of Investigation that he is the head of the Black

Organizing Power (BOP), & Student Nonviolent Coordina-

ting Committee (SNCC)

oriented group in Memphis,

Tennessee. On March 5, 1968,

Donnie Delaney advised

representatives of the Federal Bureau of Investigation

that he is a part of this same group.

Source one advised that Hosea L. Williams was

the main spokesnan and stated that every effort would be

made by a task force of the SCLC which 'is in Memphis

during

the week beginning April 1, 1968, to escalate

strike support activity in Memphis, Tennessee, James he

Crange stated that he would set up a series of youth

workshops in the various churches in Memphis which would

be attended by youths and adults and that these persons

would be trained in SCLC techniques and Fould also be

trained as parade marshals for any subsequent marches

which would be held under the auspices of SCLC and the

COME group. James L. Bevel stated that Dr. Martin Luther

King, JI.,

President of the SCLC, would come into Memphis

on Tuesday, April 2, 1968, and would probably remain until

Friday, April 5, 1968, and would probably march in a mass

march to be sponsored by COME and SCLC on that date.

Source one stated that some of the press raised

the question as to whether SCLC was attempting to take over

the strike and related racial activity in Memphis, Tennessee,

and Bevel and Hosea Williams emphatically denied this claiming

that they are operating in lemphis at their "own expense."

Hosea Williams stated that the SCLC would have to get the

garbage men justice and that it would probably have to have

daily marches in this effort.

Source further advised that Reverend Jesse Jackson

stated that SCLC and its supporters would start a concerted

drive to get all Negroes in Menghis, some 250,000, to transter

their vant accounts and insurance policies iron white

institutions to Negro institutions.

He stated that this

group would alin attempt to sce that Negro businessmen

obtained a greater portion of Negro business and that if they

did not "shape up" they would have to "ship out."

MELPH IS, TENNESSEE

Source one interpreted this to mean that Negro

businessmen would have to prepare themselves to discharge

their business responsibilities should new business from

their own people be brought to them.

Source one advised that Williams, Bevel and Jackson

kept emphasizing that this is sot a

"takeover" on their part

and that they are in Memphis at the invitation of the COMS

group.

They described themselves as a catalyst who are here

in Memphis to unite "black power."

Source one advised that Reverend James Morris

Lawson, of., stated that the leaders would nave to

recognize every black person in Memphis, including the

youth, as a'force in this novement."

Source one advised that in response to queries

from the press as to who is financing the obviously

expensive SCIC operation in Memphis, Hosea Williams replied

that SCLC is paying the bills from its treasury and that

any money raised as a result of SCLC activity in Nemphis

1111 go the sanitation workers.

Source one turther advised that Bevel answered

•a press inquiry relating to a recent statement by hemphis

neighborhoods of memphis as in effect a "war."

Bevel in :

commenting on Holloman's statements stated,

"We're here

as political psychiatrists.

We see the Mayor and his group

as patients who are mentally sick." Bevel also stated

that all of the trouble in Memphis can be attributed not

to black militancy and irresponsibility, but to the

over-all white racism which he clained exists in Memphis.

He stated that Memphis Mayor Henry Loeb feels inferior

because he viviously does not understand black people.

He added that the city tried to settle its problem with

the army and with tanks when the real problem was poverty.

He emphasized "poverty is the key issue."

he meant.

On the late night of April 1, 1968, Memphis

Chief of Police James C. Hacdonald advised that the City.

of Memphis was giving serious consideration to legal

prohibiting any mass marches led by Dr. Vartin Luther

King, Jr., or other persons prominent in the march which

He stated that

that the city is further considering the resumption of

stated that the city was considering placing some of the

strike support leaders under peace and financial responsibility

bonds.

Chief Hacdonald stated that Memphis Juvenile Court

Judge Kenneth Turner was calling for an investigation of a

report that one or more ministers provided taricabs to

take youths from their schools to the March 28, 1968, march

Chief Macdonald stated that Judge Turner's

decision came after remarks by a student,

Alvin White,

part in the march and had told Judge Turner that a minister,

name not known to him, had provided taxicabs to take some

of his friends and himself to Clayborn Temple AMs Church

so they could be in the march.

Chief Hacdonald stated that approximately 31

Negro youths appeared in Judge Turner's Court on April 1,

that a downtown sympathy march for the strikers was planned

. Ios the afternoon of Harch 29, 1968.

Lawson stated that the narch would be restricted

to ganitation workers and adult sympathizers and that every

effort would be made to eliminate the young element which

created problems leading to window breaking, looting, and

general vandalism which disrupted the massive march on

Harch 28, 1968, led by Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., President,

Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC).

Later on the afternoon of March 29, 1968, Henry

Lux advised that the narch did take place running from

Hemphis City Hall on Hain Street with approximately 200

Lux pointed out that no permit is required for marches of

any kind within the city of Hemphis and that the Memphis

municipal authorities are considering the possibility of

passing an ordinance of this type.

Also, on March 29, 1968, Chief of Police James C.

Macdonald of lemphis advised that there have been no serious

MacDonald, but the individuals firing the shots were not

identified. He stated that throughout the day the demphis.

Police Department received numerous calls of reported looting,

vandalism, and fire settings and fire bombings, although in-

vestigation by representatives of the Hemphis Police Depart-.

ment and the Hemphis Fire Departuent Indicated that most of

these Incidents were minor.

He pointed out that the major

damage in connection with the karch 28, 1968, disturbance

was confined to a three to four block area on Beale Street

in downtown Hemphis with store fronts being damaged and

practically all of & three block area. He stated that liquor

stores are still closed, that National Guardsuen are guarding

the stores which have been looted and where windows have been

broken, that the merchants are boarding up the fronts of most

of these establishments to preclude lurther vandalism and

looting and he feels that with the presence of the Tennessee

rational Guard, along with the assistance of the shelby

County Sheriff's Office and his department, that the situation

1s well in hand and that, with the exception of sporadic

outbursts of vandalism, he does not anticipate any imnediate

trouble in Hemphis.

These were being turned over to

Thế HempTs Nomercial Appeal newspaper, Saturday

morning issue, larch 30, 1968, reported in detail con-

cerning activities of Rev. Hartin Luther King, Jr., on

March 29, 1968, and stated in a story on page 1 by Reporter

Thomas BeVier that King came to Hemphis to star in what was

billed as 2 "dress rehearsal" for his April 22, 1968,

"Poor People's Crusade" on Washington, D. C. The story

continued,

"By his own non-violent standards, the rehearsal

was a tlop."

The story stated that King in a press interview

March 29, 1968, reported that he would be back in lemphis.

as early as April 3 and not later than April 5, 1968,. fOr

another nass march and was quoted as saying, "We are

going

to have a massive non-violent demonstration in Hemphis."

The story stated that the question being asked in Memphis,

the nation, and the world is whether - with the increasing

militancy of black youth - anyone can say with certainty

that a non-violent demonstration will stay that way.

King stated in the interview,

"I am convinced

we can have a non-violent demonstration" but was reported

as adding that it would be impossible to "guarantee" that

NW 68486 Docld:32989755 Page 818

## Page 819

SANITATION WORKERS STRIKE

HEHPHIS, TENNESSEE

there would not be any violence. The story stated that 1t

was significant that King was more than a half hour late

for his 11:30_A.i. press conference because he was meeting

with three nembers of a Black Power group, which the paper

referred to as "The Invaders." BeVier stated that these

three young men refused to give their, names and stated that

they would give their own press conference at a later time.

The story continued that King was staying in a

$29 a day room at the Holiday Inn Rivermont, also known as

the Rivermont Hotel. King claimed to the newspaper that he

did not realize when he came to Memphis that there were those.

in the Negro community who were "talking about violence."

He stated, "We (SCLC) had no part in the planning of the

narch.

Our Intelligence was nil."

He said that if he had

known there were persons likely to start violence, he would

have had them made parade marshals, a nove which he said had

been successful in other marches.

He was reported as being critical of the press

for reporting that he left the march in haste after the

trouble started on Harch 28, 1968.

He claimed that he left

calmly because he said, "I will not lead a violent march."

He said that while he

myalked" with aides to a car, he was

"agonizing over what had happened." The story reported that

Assistant Police Chief Henry Lux had earlier said over the

police radio

at approximately 11:27 A.H., Thursday,

Harch 28, 1968, that the march was apparently without leader-

ship as DI. King had asked for a police escort away Iron.

the narch a few minutes after the first report of violence

during the narch.

King wag reported in the story as saying

he did not think the riot "will in any way affect" his

Hashington plans for his Poor People's Crusade to commence

April 22, 1968. He said he is undecided as to how much of

his SCLC staff he can spare to organize the next massive

march in Memphis early in April 1968.

The story said that later in Hashington, D. C.,

Rev, Andrew Young, DI. King's top leutenant, said that the

main thrust of the washington demonstration would be delayed

for about two weeks and that steps would be taken to avoid

violence and that a "symbolic delegation," including King

would reach Mashington on April 22, 1968. The story continued

SANITATION FORKERS STRIKE

that ring claimed that Thursday, March 28, 1968, march was

"poorly planned" which the paper said amounts to criticisu

of Rev. James H. Lawson, Jr., whom Dr. King himself had called

"the leading non-violence theoretician in the country." The

paper reported that lawson is in charge of the strategy for

the Hemphis Negro ministers, also known as COME, and is pastor

of the Centenary Nethodist Church and continued

that Lawson

did not entirely agree with King's assessuents.

The story stated for instance that King had said

that the Black Power advocates with whom he met earlier had .

said that there had been a lack of communication between them

and the ministers and that they lelt "rejected." Rev. Lawson

was quoted by the paper as saying, "There has been communication.

I don't accept that," referring to King's statement. The

paper said that it was Rev. Lawson who had originally asked

King to come to hemphis and that for about 10 years Lawson

has served in an advisory capacity with SCLC. It stated that

Lawson agreed with King that a non-violent demonstration 1s •

possible and pointed out that this was one of the reasons

King was asked to come to Hemphis. Lawson stated, "He didn't

bring in Rap Brown (national chairman of the Student Non-

Violent Coordinating Committee), we brought in King."

He

was reported to have further said that there were other

reasons for bringing in king, one being to give the movement

in Hemphis a "national image" and another was to strengthen

the leadership of the kemphis ninisters.

The same March 30, 1968, issue of The Commercial

...

Appeal newspaper had a lead

editorial on page 6 entitled,

"King's Credibility Gap," which stated that"lartin Luther

King on the night of March 18, 1968, told an overflow crowd

at Mason Temple:

"You know what?

He may have to escalate

this struggle a bit.' Dr. King

then urged a total work

stoppage in lemphis by Negroes 'in a few days' and called

for.all Negro public school students to cut classes at the

same time.

'Try it and they will hear you, ' said Dr. King.

The escalation came Thursday when Dr. King led a supposedly

non-violent protest march from Clayborn Temple to Beale

Street, west on Beale to. Main, and a block north on Main. He

got what he asked - to an embarrassing extent.

Negro students

did play truant by the thousands and were joined by hundreds

of other young Negroes in their 20's who turned the march

Cabbage and john smitin advised that some of their

followers wear the words "The Invaders" on their jackets

TENNI

and John Smith stated that he personally wears these words.-

on his jacket but that this is merely a name which some of

them have adopted and that it 1s all part of the BOP organt-

zation.

As recently as Harch 30, 1968, source 1 stated

that many teenagers in Hemphis have put the word "Invaders"

on backs of their jackets, although they are not necessarily

connected with the BOP organization. They do this more or

less as a symbol of their sell-professed affinity with

Black Power.

Source I pointed out therefore that the mere

fact that one wears the word "Invaders" does not mean that

he is a part of any organized novement, that the only known

organized Black Power movement in Hemphis is that of BOP

headed by Cabbage and John B. Smith and the above mentioned

governing body. He pointed that, for example, at LeMoyne

College their group 1s known as BOP, at Owen College 1t 1s

known as the Afro-American Brotherhood and at Memphis State

University, which has approximately 1500 Negro students,

It is known as the Black Student Association (BSA).

Source I was not certain as to the 3 individuals

who net with king but believes that they vre Charles

L. Cabbage, Charles Harrington, and a young male Negro

in his early twenties, light skinned, with a "dog type"

face, clean features, Afro hairdo, about 5'9" to 5'10"

tall, slender, and who had introduced himsell earlier in

the summer of 1967 as Miller.

These 3 shortly prior to the

time that King Interviewed Black Power people had attempted

to gain an audience but Dr. I. halph Jackson, head of the

Hinimum Salary Division of the African Methodist Episcopal

Church, A.M.E. Church, 274 Hernando, next door to Clayborn

Temple,

280 Hernando,

which has been the headquarters of

the strike supporters since February 12, 1968. Cabbage

was insistent on seeing Ralph Jackson and that Jackson's

assistant, a Rev. Johnson, refused to allow him to see Jackson

stating that Jackson was completely "fed up" with Cabbage and

his Black Power associates, that Jackson originally had

•attempted to have rapport and communication with them and

had even offered to get them financial support out of New

York City but that after the ruckus started on March 28, 1968,

cabbage, John B. smith, and their associates came back to

the temple after the ministers had attempted to get the

marchers to return and virtually took over the temple, took

over the microphone, and would not cease and dismiss when

some of the ministers asked them to do so.

Therefore, Jackson's assistant Rev. Johnson, who

lives at 5183 Horn Lake Road, refused to take them to see

Di. Jackson.

Source I poirted out that since around March 1,

1968, the BOP group headed by Cabbage and smith has been

In close contact with the sanitation stilke and had been

i an taban

working in cooperation with the COME group that Rev. Lawson

and Dr. Jackson, the two prime leaders of the COME group,

have allowed them to attend strategy meetings and have met

with them on numerous occasions.

out it is significant that a mass strike support meeting

was held at Clayborn Temple, 280 Hernando on the night

March 5, 1968, attended by some 500 to 600 individuals and

that one of the main speakers and masters of ceremony was

Rev. James Horris Lawson, JI., and at this mass meeting

Charles laverne Cabbage and some 30 to 40 of his purported

followers were openly and with the consent of the ministers

in charge of the meeting, passing out a 5 page mimeographed

pamphlet entitled, "Afro-American Brotherhood Speaks, Black

Thesis, Black 'Power!!" which eulogized H. Rap Brown,

national charman of SNCC. A portion of this document

stated that the civil rights tactics of 1963 are not sufficient

in the form of pressure on political structures and in dealing

with what it referred

to as extreme violent reaction of city

powers in this community. It claimed that the so-called

self-appointed part-time civil rights and part-time preacherg

inevitably "quit the struggle too soon." It said that "civịl

disobedience implies an entirely new set of priorities and

responsibilities of which the current Negro leadership could

no longer accept."

It claimed that the current strike support

movement in Memphis had turned into a big revival with the

preachers having the followers so busy singing, praying, and

marching that they do not do anything about the real Issues.

Itasked the question, "Why has the community let the preachers

take over and try to lead in a fight which? There must be

• some real fighting.

je all know the preachers can't fight

or won't fight."

It then printed a lotter dated March 21,

1968, Iron Parish Prison, New Orleans, Louisiana, from i.

: Rap Brown in which he said, "He must move. Irom resistance to

aggression, iron revolt to revolution. For every Orangeburg

there must be 10 Detroits. For every lax Stanford and fuey

Newton, there must be 10 dead racist cops. And for every

black death there must be a Dien Bien Phu." It continued,

"Aggression is the order of the day" and concluded "America:

II 1t takes my death to organize my people against you, and

to organize your jails to revolt against you and God, your

poor, your country, and to organize nankind to rejoice in your

destruction and ruin, then here is my life.

Following this was a detailed drawing captioned

"Holotov cocktail" showing in detail how a Molotov cocktail

can be made by inserting a plain rag into the neck of a

bottle which contains gasoline with a base of dirt or

washing powder. source I pointed out that none of the

ministers present at this weeting made any effort whatsoever

to restrain Cabbage and his followers from distributing this

naterial nor did any of them make any statements

to the

-audience that they should ignore such naterial.

On March 30, 1968, a second source advised that

he had reliably learned that the 3 so-called "Invaders"

who were reported in the Conmercial Appeal as having

and Calvin Leroy Taylor, a nale Negrowno. resides at 347 Mest

Waldorf and who 1s a senior at Memphis State University.

Taylor works part-time as a copy boy at the Commercial Appeal

newspaper.

Taylor has recently told source 2 that he is a

part of the BOP group, which 18 affiliated with SNCC and

that he has been serving as 2 liaison representative of

• BOP with the COMe group, with the Negro ministerial group,

which 1s coordinating the strike support.

stated that when Harrington, Cabbage, and Taylor had an.

audience with king that their purpose in seeing King was to

tell King that they wanted more of the "action" in Hemphis

Iceling that they were not getting enough of the action.

• Taylor refused to elaborate but source 2 conjectured that

by this Taylor meant that the Black Power group wanted more

of a position of leadership and nore policy making position

in the over-a11 Negro novement in kemphis.

Source 2 also advised that the newsmen in Memphis

and other officials mill Interchangeably use the word

"Invaders" when they are actually referring to BOP and pointed

• out that it had been ascertained that actually the Black

Power movement in lemphis uses several names, such as Afro-

American Brotherhood, Black Student Association, BOP, and

Invaders and that Taylor has told him confidentially that

actually there are only about 12. to 15 hard-core BOP

people in Hemphis and that the others are merely followers

or people who tend to imitate them. Source 2 also stated

that he had reliably. learned from several individuals who

in the Warch 28, 1968, march when the trouble began, that the

actual BOP people did not participate in any of the vandalisi

or looting although prior to the meeting several of them,

exact identities not known to source 2, had been agitating

the young high school age Negroes who were preparing to

participate in the march by indicating that there should be .

trouble and that lemphis was not worth saving and that. 1t

should burn, and other inflannatory utterances to this effect.

.

On the afternoon of Harch 29, 1968, a third

source advised that Rev. Hartin Luther King, Jr., President,

SCLC, Bernard Lee, Special Aide to Ring, and Rev. Ralph

D. Abernathy, Vice President at Large, SCLC, all departed

at 3:20 P.H. CST, Harch 29, 1968, their destination being

Atlanta, Georgia. This source stated that to the best of

his knowledge

they went directly from the Rivermont Hotel

to the Hemphis Hetropolitan Airport,

source 1 on larch 30, 1968, recalled that Rev.

kartin Luther king, or., obviously would have been aware

of the presence of a nilitant Black Power group in

Hemphis and based this opinion on the following Information:

King 1n his March 18, 1968, speech before the

strike supporters at Mason Temple had urged all high school

students to remain away from school to participate in the

massive narch which he planed to lead in the future and

urged all workers in Hemphis to stay away Iron their jobs

and march and at no time did he call for a completely non-

violent march.

Source further recalled that James Bevel,

who for several years has been on King's staff and who was

last known by source 1 to have the title of "in charge of

non-violent action, was in Hemphis with King's party on

Harch 18, 1968, and remained in Hemphis until at least

Harch 20, 1968.

Source I recalled that on March 20, 1968,

•Bevel along with Rev. Harold Hiddlebrook of 257 Walker,

, a former member of King's staff in Atlanta and now a resident

of lemphis and one of the leaders of the COME group appeared

at LeMoyne College, a Negro institution of some 600 students

1n Hemphis, being brought there by James Phillips and Clinton

Roy Jamerson, members of the governing body of BOP, There

Bevel and Hiddlebrook met with various Lelloyne students at

the student center at noon on Harch 20, 1968, meeting with

approximately 75 to 100 sudents.

Bevel was the nain speaker

and gave what informant described as a virulent Black Power :

talk claiming that the white power structure through economic

pressure will eventually attempt to exterminate the Negro

in the United. States in some form of genocide and pointed

out that the United States in its foreign aid program has

proven that it is a white supremacist country in that 1t

gives more to white nations in the form of foreign than it

does to black countries such as those making up the continent

of Africa. Bevel further claimed, according to source 1,

that while Negroes or black men as he referred to them welcome

the support given by the white clergy and white "do-gooders"

that these whites are not really sincere as they have no

"real soul feeling" toward the Negro and he suggested that

his listeners read several Black Revolutionary books, and

particularly urged them to read the book entitled, "The

Wretched of the Earth" by Frantz Fanon, which informant

NW 68486 Docld:32989755 Page 827.

described as a bible to revolutionary and militant

Negro

activities.

Source 1 stated that he personally knew that

John B. Smith of BOP, along with Charles Harrington and

Verdell Brooks of BOP and a new supporter of the group,

one Milton Hack and another BOP member Samuel Carter,

were all present with Middlebrook and Bevel at this

meeting.

Bevel urged all of these listeners to actively

participate in the future scheduled march to be led by

Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr.

Furthermore, at this meeting

John B. Swith and his followers stated that they were

canvassing all of the Negro high schools with leaflets

urging a nass walkout at the schools and urging that these

walking students participate in the sanitation workers

• sympathy narch to be led by King.

Hiddlebrook and Bevel stated that they also planned to

• canvass Memphis State University, Southwestern College,

• Christian Brothers College, and Owen Junior College, all

institutions or higher learning in hemphis, tennessee,

.In order to solicit support, not only for their organization

. but also for the proposed mass march to be led by King.

John B. Smith bragged to Bevel that his BOP group

had

2180

organized at most of the colleges in lemphis.

meeting urged the students to read"Wuhammad Speaks,"

official newspaper of the Nation of Islam' (NOI), headed in

Chicago, Illinois, by Elijah luhamnad, pointing out that

much of Muhammad's program Iits his concept of Black Power

philosophy with the exception of the religious aspect whereby

Muhammad claimed Allah as his god. He told students to

ignore the religious aspects and merely follow the economic

and political aspects propounded in Muhammad's program.

Bevel also bragged that within the next year he hopes to

• form a new nationwide Black Power organization in the

• United States which would supersede SNCC and would take in

the remnants of the varied uncoordinated Black Power groups

now existing in the United States and wanted to build a

united black front effort having tentacles in all major

communities in the United States. Source I pointed out that

Bevel, will an ordained minister, was extremely vulgar and

obscene in his talk and shocked some of the women who were

• present resulting in some of the women leaving the meeting

to the President, the Attorney General, and the FBI asking for Mr. Foover's retif:-

Wilkins how in the hell could he espect the FBI to believe his offers of friendship aí

bung his head and stated he had no idea that King was carrying on such a campaign, Ee

stated that this upset him greatly and made him all the more determined to initizie

Wilkins stated that he had long noted King's sympathy toward the

communist morement. He told me this chrious!; stemmed iron. Stale; Lenirson's

SECULITY LETTIR - COMMUNIST

leference is nade to my nenorandum to you in this matter ily

ated sugust 31, 1964, In which the Director approved the recommendation

o have Assistant Director Halone orally brief Francis Cardinal Spelluan

oncerning tariin Luther king, Jr.'s connunist connections and

egenerate make-up to avoid the possibility of having the Pope grant

e audience to ling in connection with his proposed visit to Rome

aler this monta.

halone was brieied in this matter and told to stress two

I'ngs 1s his contact vith Cardinal Spellran, the first being that

e should stress of course the confidential nature of our brieling

p that the bureau would not be arzin into the picture, and, secondly,

certain 11 Cardinal Spellnan could take the necessary action

us relationship fith the pope so that it he could not, ve coula

alic appropriate, steps through other channels.

Halone called today and stated that he had discussed the.

Ituation vich Cardinal Spellman over the weekend and he said that,

he Cardinal took instant steps to advise the Vatican against

ranting iny audience to ling. He stated that Cardinal Spellnan

ssured him that he would respect the confidential nature of the

niornation and added that the Cardinal was nost pleased and

ratitsed that the Director thought enough of his to take him into ?

is confidence and to rely upon hin to handle such a delicate matter.

ardinal Spellian is going to home nest week to attend the Ecumenical

ouncil and thus will be on the scene personally and further insure

ROQIOP

Hartin-I0ther-King,

Jr., is to be in West Berlin, Germany;

for the opening of that city's cultural festival 9/13/64.

We have

just obtained details of his itinerary for travel abroad which reveals

that he will leave the United States cither 9/11 or 12/64 and not

return until 9/22/64.

Included in his itinerary is a visit to Rome,

Italy. he is to go there irom Madrid, Spain, 9/18/64, and remain In

Rome until the morning of 9/20/64 nhen he will go to London, England.

He have not as yet obtained

any information indicating the

purpose of his visit to Rome, but it is entirely likely that he may

seek and be given an audience with the Pope. This likelihood is

clearly evident when one considers that King is receiving more and

lore acclalm as a leader of the Negro people in this country, plus

the fact that he is a clergyman. Further, King He know is being con-

sidered for the Nobel Peace Prize andhis receiving an audience with

the Pope would likely receive considerable publicity, especially in

Europe, further enhancing his chances for the Prize.

• It would be shocking indeed for such an unscrupulous character

as King to receive an audience with the Pope. It is believed that it

a plan to see the Pope is in the making, it ought to be nipped in the

Ve have considered different possibilities for meeting this

problem and believe that the best one would be to have Assistant

Director Malone of the New York Office personally contact Francis

Cardinal Spellman and on a highly confidential basis bring to the

Cardinal's attention (1) the fact that King is to visit Rome and the-

likelihood of his receiving an audience with the Pope and (2) the

unsavory nature of king's character, both from a subversive and moral

standpoint alone should be able to impress upon the Cardinal the

likely embarrassment that may result to the Pope should he grant King

an audience and King 1s later discredited. In this light it moula

hardly even be necessary for Malone to "suggest" what the Cardinal

should do to forestall any possible audience.. Malone should stress

the highly confidential nature of this matter with the Cardinal, who

is veiy, friendly to the Bureau, and insure that the Bureau is in no

way associated with any action taken by the Cardinal or the Vatican.

Malone should also obtain from the Cardinal a commitment that he

will be able to block any attempt by King to gain an audience with

the Pope. If the Cardinal 1s not able to give such an assurance,

Fe must innediately know this so that me may explore some other avenue.

RECOLMENDATION:

i approved, assistant Director halone should personally

orally briei Francis Cardinal Spellman in accordance with the attacheo

"Top Secret" summary indicating King's communist connections and

degenerate make-up.

This is the same summary me previously used

in preventing King's receiving an honorary degree from Harquette

University.)

The attached summary should also be used for telephon-

ically briefing lalone.

This matter should receive most expeditious

handling because of the time element involved.

The Honolulu Office hed received sufficient correspondence

from Maintand Offices so they sould be aware in a teneral way c

what type ci irvestigation ves to be conducted concerning the

princizal Subject's (nIiE) visit to Eonalulu. It was apparent

to the Honolulu Office from the cogies of communications

in its

file that the bureau had an interse interest in the extra

curricular activities of the Subject and the conrunist influence

upon him and, therefore, the licrolulu chrice was in a position

to account for the

pringipal Subject's public activities,

appearances, speeches, ejs.

SAC PPICE Icinted out upon the arrival of Sas CLIFFOPD

and LYMall that Honolulu ses in the ridst of the peak of its

winter tourist seasor.. The verious airlines hed just inaugurated

a flat $100.00 tourist flight to Havail and all co the principal

but he indicated that he

Inrough its sublic sources,

overilciing and mas actually asking sone of its guests to move

elsewhere is possible. •

It was scirted cut to tri EPICS that if at all possible

it was imperative for sas CLIFICPD and Lylfil to at least be in

The Filten Faraiian Village is a complex of five

steel and concrete torers,

each approzinately fifteen stories

linked together by a

series

of 2-story concrete notel-like

buildings with perhaps 75

independent shops, restaurants, bars,

etc. arcund a huge open-air lobby.

En insection of the halls

and the rochs revealed that the civicing malls were made

four irch concrete blocks. "The hiltch Hawaiian Village has.

approxinately 1100 separate acconciations, reors, suites,

and pent houses with roc. for approximately 2500 people.

the Hawaiian Villare when the other tourists nove out.

Through yr. ED FASTINGS, & SAC contact, and a persenal

friend of sac price, lo. trice began a most discreet inquiry to

determine where the

Subject and his party were to be located.

It was discovered that the hotel is booked up so full and has

so rany corritrents on a continuous basis, that it ordinarily

books blocks of.rcors and suites by type and price rather than

making individual assigments to guests sho have made reservations;

thus, it rould know that or a dertain day it would need, for

guest had registered at the hotel. This was the case with regard

to the "AFTI!! LUTHE? KIE party.

Ho spechlic space had yet been

assigned and for security reasors it was determined best by the

SAc and by the Agents on special assigntent, that as far as

possible, the hotel be alloved to follow normal booking procedures.

In the meantime, ses CLIFFORD and lintil proceeded to

establish their identities as tourists in the hotel and its

environs, The ricrolulu Office has ter. cars assigned to it, 211

of which are relatively well knoin and all of which are equipsed

with 2-vay radios.

The frents on special assignment explored the

possibility with

the sec and experienced lgents of the Honolulu

Office

on switching license plates on one of their cars and

utilizine it on tre special assigament, but the corsidered opinion

of all concerned sas that security right be lost by such an

arrangement and it was, therefore, resclved to rent a fertz car

SAC PRICE of Honolulu, with funds from the San Francisco

confidential fund, is settling the bill for the roors used for

experiments and for the toners at the Hanaiian Village Hotel and

will forward the bills to sh CLIfFORD, who will voucher and blue

slip same.

OESEPVATICHS AND PECOWVERDARIONS:

(1) No matter at its size in population, Honolulu

is basically

a resort srall town and

all the

Bureau dersonnel who participated in the investigation agreed

that the Bureau vas extremely wise ir designatirg this operation

to be handled as a special assignert in a semi-undercover

capacity by Special tgents frer. arcther territery who were not

knoun as Special lgerts ir the Ficnolulu area.

The Honclulu Office

and the Sar. Francisco igents are convinced that such an assign-

ment could not have beer. carried out with full security by the

Honclulu tgents therselves because they are too vell known in

this comparatively small tevr.. ?

(2) Flincugh usine

only five Agents to make technical

oun security, conduct discreet nearby fisurs of

technical installations, erovide their

Subjects and

potential

subjects, and contact anonymous scurces means that the

manpover is spread

very thin especially where two separate

hotels are involved,

it is believed that the use of an experienced

coordinated special

assigrrent crew may very well be the best

way to attack this prosiem.

(3). The SAC and Ine local FEI Office are indispensable

to the successful operation of such a special

assigrent. The two big questions that the local SAC has to be

in a position to anster are: (a) Exactly where is the Subject

goin? to le? and (1) Can we get a room next to him? Agents on

special assigment cannot walk in cold in any area, much less

a cronied rescit area, and accomplish this with full security.

It is the considered sinion of the frents sino participated in

this special assignent that he would have been spared

much anxiety

and lasturinute improvisation if the Honolulu SAC could have

been advised in advance, with utmost security, that he would

be called upon to deterine where the subject was staying

and to obtain adjacent space for the Agents on special assignment.

This is a suggestion

for the Bureau to consider in the event

lit plans future special assierments of this sort.

This one

worked well due to the excellence of the contacts.

(4) The plagits of IV sets in the room and the

operation of incividual air conditioning

units both aresented a considerable prcbler which made sere of

the conversations alrest, li not completely, unintelligible.

These particular Subjects seemed to have a tendercy to turn the .

TV on most of the time when they were in the room, particularly

(

in the evenine hours.

ie do not believe that it would be wise

-o make either the TV or the air conditioning inoperable in a

subject's rcen where a discreet installation is made with fuil

security,

where it

is placed if the IV is plasting avay.

are pertinent to this investigation are being forwarded under

A sanitation workers stric has been going on in

reuphis for some time.. Martin Luther King, JI., today led a

march composed of 5,000 to 6,000 people through the streets

I of Memphis. King was in an automontle preceding the sarchars.

As the march developed, acts of violence and vandalisa broke

out including the breaking of windows in stores and some

looting.

This clearly denonstrates that acts of so-called

nonviolence advocated by King cannot be controlled. The same

thing could happen in his planned nassive civil disobedience

for Washington in April.

Martin Luther King, JI., President of the Southern

Christian Leadership Conference, injected himself into the

sanitation workers' strike in Yemphis, Tennessee, and the

result of King's.fanous espousal of nonviolence was vandalism,

looting, and riot.

Previously, King involved hinself in this strike,

called for a general strike, and called for a mass march. •

Ioday he led the mass narch in an-autorobile at the head of

the line. Negroes began shouting "black power". and trouble

began.. King, apparently unable or unwilling to control the

marchers, absented himselt from tre scene; window breaking and

Looting broke out.

Police officers were forced to use gas to break up

the march and to control the crowd. It was necessary to

activate the National Guard. Martin luther King clains his

much-heralded maich on Washington, scheculed for April 22,

1968, will also be "nonviolent."

He says he has persuaded

militant black nationalists to abandon violent extremism in

Washington, D. C., during the march. Memphis may only be.the

prelude to civil

‚strife in our Nation's Capitol.

Security Matter -

A confidential source, who has furnished reliable

Information in the past, learned on March 20, 1960, that,

late on

that date, Stanley Levison and Martin Luther king, Jr.

discussed the violence that occurrec in hemphis, tennessee

on march 20, 1900, following king's leadership or a protest

march through downtown Memphis.

King indicated that he has

Abecome so depressed over the developments in Memphis that

he has considered calling off the Hashingion March (his

O self-described Poor People's Campaign, scheduled to begin in

Washington, D.C. on April 22, 1963). (STU

Levison told King that his depression was aggravated

Moecause he is physically exhausted as a result of his recent

_strenuous progran.

He counseled King not to be on the defensive

Zover the events in

Memphis but, on the contrary, should take

Luthe position that the majority of people in the Memphis March

maid not join in the rioting that took place, proving the

effectiveness of King's leadership aná his policy of non-violence.

--Levison emphasized that the Washington March will be different

Pin that King will have organized this march and his forces can

Estress the importance of non-violence. Levison suggested that

ciSaturday morning (March 30, 1962) would be e better time to

-meet in Atlanta to discuss the Memphis incident

rameeting on Friday night March 29, 1900) because it will give.

King time to rest.

advised that a bill concerning this matter will soon be voted out of the Sub-

Charles E. Wiggins (R-California) and Byron G.: Rogers (D-Colorado),

members of the subcommittee, wil be contacting the Bureau in the near

future to request an "off the record" briefing concerning King:

ng. They are in

a position to keep any such bill from being reported out of committee--it,

as stated by Congressman Ashbrook, they realize that King was a scoundrel.

Pursuant to instructions, I saw DI. Carey, who is known to

Mr. Tolson and the Director, at 12:30 p.m. today in my office.

DI. Carey told me that he knew that time was limited at FBI Headquarter

so he would come right to the point. He stated he had come to see us on behalf of

Martin Luther King. He added that King was in Chicago last weekend and stayed in

Carey's home, and at that time indicated every evidence of great disturbance. King

told Carey he had been reliably informed there was a massive effort to discredit him

by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. This effort is to begin this week.

Carey told me that he wanted to enlist the sympathies of the FBI In not

letting any effort to discredit King occur. He said he wanted to beg the usage of our ..

good offices to prevent such an occurrence from happening. He stated he was asking

for our assistance based upon good reasoning. He then mentioned those reasons as:

(1) Reverend King is a good man: (2) Reverend King stands as a "symbol" to the

Negro race today. (3) Reverend King is a "safety valve" at the present time. He

explained this by indicating that Reverend King's articulate voice was preventing more

of the militant and violent Negroes from committing serious acts in the United States..

I interrupted Dr. Carey at this point and told him he had known us for a

long time and that I felt certain that he knew in his own mind that the FBI had plenty

to do without being responsible for a discrediting campaign against Reverend King.

DI. Carey agreed that he did know us better and stated that he had doubted King's

allegations from the very beginning. I told Carey that Reverend King had criticized

us very unfairly, particularly concerning the background and investigative actions of

our Southern Agents. I briefed Carey very thoroughly on this point. I further told

DI. Carey that King had later denied that he had made such allegations upon having an-

appointment in Mr. Hoover's Office. I told Dr. Carey that the Director had given

Reverend King some very good advice insofar as his moral responsibilities were

concerned.

DeLoach to Mohr Memo, 5/19/65

RE: DI. Archibald J. Carey, Jr.

Reverend Martin Luther King

. I went into the entire situation with Dr. Carey and told him not only of

the many successes we had enjoyed in this particular field, but also of the dis-

couragements and humiliations that extremists on both sides attempted to subject us

to. Dr. Carey Showed great interest and indicated that he would be one that would

lattempt to remedy that situation.

DI. Carey called me'at 3:35 p. ti. this afternoon and stated he wanted

to use about ten seconds in mentioning two additional things: (f) He stated that ne

thad talked to King telephonically and remonstrated with King about the fact that king

shoudd make a greater effort to praise the FBI for its excellent work inthe civil rights

field. (2) DI. Carey stated he wanted to be very immodest for a second. He added

that he felt he had done a great deal for the current administration and that despite

the fact that he was the president of a savings and loan association; minister of a large

Negro church; and head of other business interests, he would still appreciate it if the

Director would say a good word for him to the President. DI. Carey stated he knew

John Macy of the Civil Service Commission very well and felt that Macy would be on

)lis side if any appointment came up. I told Dr. Carey that the Director, of course,

regarded him very highly and would naturally keep his request in mind, although it

might be presumptuous for the Director to make such recommendations to the White

House. DI. Carey stated he could understand this. He again pledged his loyalty

and friendship. •

ACTION:

Di. Carey is the third individual that King has had come see us relative

I to requesting that we not expose him. Roy Wilkins, Jim Farmer and Reyerend

Abernathy have all been here for the same purpose. It is obvious that King is

becoming very disturbed and worried about his background, else he would not go to

such great efforts to have people approach the FBL. I did not commit the FBI in any

manner insofar as exposing King is concerned. To the contrary, I let Carey flatly

know of King's derelictions insofar as false allegations against us are concerned and

of the fact that King and other civil rights workers owed the FBI a debt of gratitude

they would never be abe to repay. For record purposes.

Fursuant to the Diractor's question as to why

bringing up to date this monograph may take until 3-14-58,

the following is set forth for consideration:

• This section made an imediata analysis of the

problem and discovared that there have been so many changes

and devalopments in regard to organizations, leadershi?,

. and activities affecting Martin luther King's operations

that to do a truly first-class' job would require not

bringing the nonograph up to date, but revriting it fron

the vary beginning. This is what the section is engaged

in doing now. Howaver, if the Director feels that urgency

is paramount. in this matter, this section will be only tos

glad to work around the clock. and rewrite the monograph

in a minimun of time. This mould nean completing it about

Friday, 3-0-50..

HI. Tolson has sugges

and the Director agreed,

- up to date.

that the monograph on Martin Luther King, de. be brouse

this is an excellent suggestion and we have already

started the necessary research. Bringing this monograph up to

date and disseminating it at high level prior to King's "Wash-

rington Spring Project" should serve again to remind top-level

officials in Governient of the wholly disreputable character

of king.

As you know, King's "Hashington Spring Project" was

originally scheduled for early April, 1968. However, our

Washington Field Office has developed information that King's

to participatein the demonstration and the date for the project

has now tentatively been set for April 27, 1968.

Because of the importance of doing a thorough job on :?

this, we will conduct an exhaustive file review to bring together

the most corplete and up-to-date information and to present it

in a hard-hitting manner. To make the brief timely, we will

have it completed and ready for dissemination by March 14, 1958.

Pursuant to the Director's instructions, I showed ele Mlas Gone

the attached report concerning the

engaged in by Dr. King

to Walter Jenkins of the White House this morning at 11:00 a.m.

Jenkins read the entire report word for word. I told him that the Director thought

perhaps the President might like to know about this matter strictly in confidence..

Jenkins stated he would tell the President this afternoon about this incident. He

stated that it certainly opened his eyes and he felt it was one of the most repulsive

incidents that he knew of.

I told Jenkins that the Director indicated I should leave

this attachment with him if he desired to let the President personally read it.

Jenkins mentioned that he was sufficiently aware of the facts that he could verbally

advise the President of the matter. Jenkins was of the opinion that the FBI could

erform a good service to the country if this matter could somehow be confidentially

ren to members of the press. I told him the Director had this in mind, however,

also believed we should obtain additional information prior to discussing it with

_certain friends.

BACKGROUND

By letter dated 8/25/67 the following offices

were advised of the beginning of a Counterintelligence

Program against militant Black Nationalist-Hate Groups:

Albany

Hemphis

• Atlanta

Newark

Baltinore

: New Orleans

Boston

New York.

Buffalo :

Philadelphia

Charlotte

Phoenix",

Chicago

Pittsburgh

'Cincinnati

Richmond

Cleveland

st. Louis

Detroit

San Franciscó

Jackson

Washingon Field

Los Angeles.

Each of the above offices was: to designate a

Special Agont to coordinate this progran.

Replies to this

letter indicated an Interest In counterintelligence against

pIlitant black nationalist groups that foment violence. and

several ofiices outlined procedures which had been effective

in the past. For example, Hashington Field Office had

furnished information about a new Nation of Islan (NOI)

grade school to appropriate authorities in the District

...of Colunbia who investigated to determine 11: the school

conforned to District rezulations for private schools. In

the process WFO obtained background information on the paxents

of cach pupil.

...

• The Revolutionary Action Movement (RAM), a pro-

Chinese connunist group, was active in philadelphia, Pa..

in- the sunner of 1967.

The Philadelphia Office alerted

local police,

who then put rall leaders under close scrutiny.

They were arrested on every possible charge until they could

no longer make bail. As a result, RAll leaders spent suost of the

sunner in jail and no violence traceable to Rali took place.

The Counterintelligence Progran is now being

expanded to include 11 otices. Each of the offices added

to this prograti should dcsignate an Agent Lamiliar with blac

Chicago has carefully reviewed the Nation of Islam (NOI)

file concerning the suggestion in referenced airtel concerning

to possibly embarrass jashington Spring

Project (WSP) 'efforts in Baltimore through a suggested alliance

between forces of MARTIN LUTHER KING and the NOI.

Additionally,

highly placed NOI sources at Chicago, specifically d

Dents the latter of whom was not available until 3/20/68,

were also contacted in this connection and the matter was indirectly

pursued with them.

infarmants

By way of background, as the Bureau is aware, KING and

ELIJAH MUHAMAD, head of the NOl, met briefly in Chicago during

2/66 under amicable circumstances, primarily as a result of MARTIN

LUTHER KING's then recent entry onto, the Chicago civil rights scene

The meeting produced no tangible results insofar as cooperation,

unity or program was concerned, however,

did receive considerable

local publicity.

The meeting was basically for the purpose of

showing unity within the Negro community.

KING suffered no adverse publicity as a result of this

,meeting although within several days MUHAMiAD, at an annual NOI

Convention, made remarks critical of KING for being too close to

the white man.

In reaction to these remarks publicly, KING

glossed

over this criticism and to some degree capitalized on it,

indicating that in his efforts to build unified support for the

cause of the Negro, he was in contact with all segments of Negro •

opinion. Indeed,

as recently as 8/67, MUHAMMAD indicated a desire

to again meet with KING to discuss the unity of the Negro.

As the Bureau and Atlanta are aware, KING and CASSIUS

CLAY were in personal contact in louisville, Kentucky, in 5/67,

In the course of open housing demonstrations held under stIC

auspices. A Chicago NOI source has advised that the meeting was

not pre-arranged, but resulted from the fact that both KING and

CLAY were in Louisville at the same time: HERBERT MUHALAD, 50n

Of ELIJAH',, desired to enlist KING's support for CLAY in his

resistance

to the draft and arrarged this meeting, which was

characterized

as full of joking and horseplay.

In subsequent newspaper publicity concerning this meeting,.

KING was quoted as having praised CLAY for his refusal to be

inducted into the armed forces, coupling this reference to attacks

on our policy in Vietnam.

The

NOI publication "Muhamnad Speaks"

was one of the papers which contained KING's favorable remarks,

including a connent that Chay had given up 31, 000, 000 in ordex

to stand up for what his conscience dictated as right.

In short it would appear generally to be true that

contact between KING and the NOl is not a heretofore unknown happening

and it would appear that any effort to utilize this situation in

Baltime nust indicate more than casual associations or contacts,

but: In osder to embarnass or inhibit WS? efforts should indicate

close working relationship or partnenship between the two groups.

It should be kept in mind also, however, that as the

above sources note, although CIAY is nationally known for his

adherance to the NOl, he is also somewhat universally acclaired

and embraced by nost groups within the Black Nationalist Movement,

CORE and SACC as examples, as well as the black community generally

and has achieved somewhat the status of a mortyred black folk hero.

Re Bureau airtel to Atlanta 3/11/68.

Baltimore's suggestion of utilizing a cartoon

to depict the apparent alliance between SCIC and the NOI

has, as the Bureau noted, definite merit. Howeyer, Atlanta

is of the opinion the Bureau's suggestion of a pertinent

newspaper article is more appropriate under the circunstances

and might lend itself to wider circulation than a cartoon..

• The impact on king of printed matier is apt to be greater, than

material presented in a cartoon no matter.how skillfully it may

be presented.

On 2/23/66 KING met with ELIJAH MUHALLAD in the

latter's residence in Chicago for the purpose of enlisting

MUHAMNAD's aid in fighting Chicago slum conditions.

Istlan ta's

highly confidential sources at that time never developed any

pertinent information describing KING's reaction to or

This language alnost suggests some degree

adherence to teachings of ELIJAH MULALIAD.

It is suggested the proposed publicity might be

slanted to convey the thought thát the apparent alliance

between SCLf. and the MOl possibly grew out of the former

neeting

between KING and LUlAD; that in connection with

SCLC is "pushing" the NOI in Baltimore.

This, of

KING'S

current statenents that the ISP is to be based on nonviolent

techniques because the position o1 the bor torara the unite

man is basically one of annihilation. f.u.

While KING is currently seeking the cooperation of

other organizations to assist with SCIC's WSP he has shown no

willingness to use SCLC to assist any other organization.

In effort to finance the WSP, SCLC plans to seet

financial contributions from Negro churches.

It is felt KING's reaction to the proposed technique

would be positive for counterinelligence purposes. KING

considers himself a devotced the nonviolent philosophies

of the late MAHATIA GANDHI. To publicly align him and/or SCLC •

with the NoI should trouble him on this basis.

It is

further conceivable that MUlAD may see fit to respond to this

ANDERSON

I. SOUTHERN CHRISTIAN LEADERSHIP

CONFERENCE (SCIC)

MARTIN LUTHER KING

A. KING has changed the date of his

Washington Spring Project (WSP) on several occasions;

he has, on occasion, announced his anticipated presence

at various locations, and then send a top aide instead

of appearing himself; he has periodically changed the

dates of his appearances in certain geographic areas.

Many times, announcements were made when KING was to be

at a specific WSP meeting in order to draw a crowd, when

actually it was known in advance by KING that he would

not attend.

JN 100-980

It. Is felt the above considerations can

be exploited to cause confusion in the efforts of KING

and his group, and to cause Negro dissatisfaction with

his operating procedures.

This could be accomplished

by the following:

1) When KING is actually to

be at a gathering, have informants circulate false in-

formation as to time, date and location of KING's ap-

pearance, or variations of each, i.e., correct time and

place, but different location, correct location, but

different date, et cetera.

2) Have informants circulate

information that KING is to be at announced local meet-

Ings of SCLC groups when, in fact, he will not be present.

3) Announce, through informant,

when KING is to be at specific place, that this is only a

guise to draw a crowd, and only local leaders will be

present, excluding KING.

B. KING and his top aides dress expen-

sively, generally travel via first class means, and

stay at first class accommodations usually in predomi-

nately white areas of cities he visits. Recently, in

Memphis, KING ran from his followers when violence erupted

during a march he was leading there. It is felt the above

two considerations could be linked to discredit KING and

his aides with poor Negroes who he is seeking support from.

This could be accomplished by the preparation of a flyer

showing photographs of KING and aides dressed well, next

to photographs of Negroes poorly clothed; under the photo-

graph would be data concerning his expensive tates, ac-

commodations, use of private airplane, and related

data;

with this information would be information concerning

2

## Page 936

JN 100-980

KING's deserting his followers during the Memphis riots.

The key note message would be that KING and his aides

are out for their own financial and physical welfare

primarily. Flyers could be prepared from newspaper

photographs of KING and lis aides, or from some photo-

graphs available at various field offices. Distribution

could be by anonymous mailings to poor Negro leaders, :

or by placement of copies at Negro meeting places by

Informants•

II. STUDENT NON-VIOLENT COORDINATING

COMMITTEE (SNCC)

This group has discouraged its members

from associating with whites. Information has been de-

veloped that some leaders and top functionaries, since

the establishment of this policy; have periodically

maintained close associations, to include residing with

white girl friends. Information concerning these asso-

ciations could be capitalized on by counterintelligence

measures to show the hypocrisy of these leaders and to

discredit the individuals involved with their new "Black

only" oriented associates in the same organization, and

to discredit them with leaders of other Black Nationalist

organizations withwhom they may be seeking support or

rapport.

Specifically, efforts could be undertaken

to obtain photographs of the principals involved with

their white girl friends. The flyer could then be pre-

pared containing this photograph or photographs.. Under

the photograph could be information regarding the princi-

pals' position with SNCC, followed by quotations of top

SNCC leaders regarding associations with whites or

Black Separatists statements. The flyers could be mailed.

Miss Gandy -

by

dissident group of top officials headed by Clay Blair, JI., Editor in Chief of "The

Saturday Evening Post" and all Curtis magazines, and Marvin De-Kantor, $80, 000

¡year senior Vice President in Charge of the magazine division. In a nutshell,

3lair and Kantor have been fired; Normay hitter, Assistant Managing Editor, and

chomas halarvel, Chiet of Editorial Production, have been suspended. Culligan,

who has been actively looking for a top executive to assist him in running the atiairs

I Curtis for sometime, resigned as President while retaining his job as Chairman

i the Boara. It is expected that a new President will be named soon.

-..

This top management revolt, which has been brewing for some months,

rupted openly during the early part of October when the press reported that fifteen

7, officials in a letter to the Board of Directors accused Culligan of mismanagement.

at the present time, it appears that Culligan has retained the confidence of the Board

I Directors, has seized the initiative, and is making a thorough house cleaning.

Culligan has been a good friend of the Director and the Bureau for

•number of years. He has demonstrated his support and admiration on numerous

occasions and has been most cooperative with us.

It was he who offered to feature

lead article in a May issue of the "Post" concerning the Director's 40th Anniversary,

vith a photograph of Mr. Hoover on the cover.

Earlier, through Culligan, we

quelched the unfavorable article against the Bureau being written by free-lance

riter, Dan J. Marlowe, submitted to the "Post" concerning our investigation of

russbaum and Wilcoxson. More recently, through Culligan, we postponed publication

n the "Post" of an article based upon the assault of our Agent Foley in New York by

ne Lombardozzi family. Early in 1964, we received word ol an article being

rublished in the "Post" by Martin Luther King. Through Culligan, we forestalled

ublication of this article. More recently, with the Director's approval, I

ontacted Culligan on September 22, 1964,

Culligan has

dvised that a contract did exist with King for the "Post"' article and that the

ecalcitrant group within Curtis had insisted that publication of it be carried through

ecause of King's recent Nobel Peace Prize. Although he was completely sympathetic

ith our aims and regretted his inability to be of service in this specific instance,

e pointed out that we should feel free to call upon him in the future if there is any

ay in which he can be of help to the Bureau. Culligan advised that the King article

as scheduled for early publication sometime after election.

In connection with this "Post" article by King, our sources have

dicated that since he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize he has attempted through

ome of his associates to change the "Post" article in an effort to soften criticism

ade by him against other civil rights groups and leaders. King feared that such

iticism would cause difficulties in the civil rights movement. The "Post'' however,

Is resisted King's efforts to make these changes.

that, while there is connunist influence being exerted on legroes

This historically has been the position of the Bureau

The Historical Position:

For example, in a detailed docuent prepared on Cor-urist.

"si)ste ai the communist Party to attract avoI & cigaLlicunt nulle

of liegroes in the United States to its nurocr. "

Another example is

to be found in an analysis 1n this same field preparcd by the Burea

1955 to the effect that communist efforts have been "unsuccessfui

¿, a state or national level" in infiltrating "legitimate legro-

fraternal, protest and improvement organizations," although they ace

Ited success in some "isolated chapters."

The Director's book,

Lasters of Deceit, published in 1958, states: "It becane obvious

that the sariy,

despite great efforts, had failed to win over ever

a Significant minority of legroes." In 1960 the Director's stateseni

to The Committee on the Judiciary. United States Serate; reads:

"It Is no secret that one o1 tne bitterest disappolniments of

communistic efforts in this Nation has been their failure to lure

our legro citizeus into the Party." In 1952 sinilar public stateneats:

were made.

On page seven of the Brief subaitted to the Director

under the date of August 23, 1963,

this historical position vas

restzted and it was said, "One of the bitterest disappointments of

the communists las been their single failure to lure any significant

number of our legro citizens into the Party." This statement was

set forth again in the cover menorandum which the Director marked.

The point I wish to make here is this: The fact that this

bas been our historical position in the Bureau for many years is no

reason to assume that it is the correct position at this tire, as

Director has clearly explained.

eason why I think the sAc Letter should be sent is related

nould be so surprise to us because since the Negro march on

pseible to exploit the very troubled racial situztion as

ar said weeks ago, the end of the kegre march mould be the

Mr. Belmont's memorandum of November 26, W02, reflected the

terratives in interviewing Rev. Martin Luther King, Ji., who had criticized the

ork of the FSI in relation to the Albany situation.

The Director approved the

iggestion that Ir. Sullivan and I handle the interview with Rev. King.

•.

Following approval, I immediately tried to contact Rev. King telephorical

1 November 27, 1902.

Rev. King does not have a phone at his residence. We then attempted to

Cntact him at his church in Atlania. His secretary advised, upon being told wio

as trying to contact him, that Rev. King was "off in another building writing a book.

The further stated that Pev. King preferred not to be disturbed and that it would be

impossible to tar. to him.

That same day I called the S'C at Atiant, and instructed

i to attempi to contact Rev. King and set up an interview for It. Sullivan and me.

:4C Atlanta advised the foilowing day, November 23, that Rev. King had left

structions with his secretary that he did not have time for an interview, that he was

moving around the country. The secretary further aávised the SAC that Rev. King

would call us wien he was willing to sit down for an interview. Rev. King has not

culled since that date.

It would appear obvious that Rev. King does not desire to be told the

-rue facts. He obviously used deceit, lies and treachery as propaganda to fypini

RE: RACIAL SITUATION

Howard Zinn, the author of the report for the Southern Regional

Council, was mentioned in my memorandum 11/15/62 and has been the subject

of a security investigztion by this Burezu (100-360217). Zinn was reportedly

a member of the CP from 1949 through 1953 and attended CP meetings auring

that period. Zine is a nistory proiessor at Spellman College in Atlanta It

was the second slanted and biased document written by Zinn on the Albany

situation.

Reverend It. King is the President of the Southern Christian

Leadership Conference who rose to prominence during the 1955 - 1956

successful boycott which ended bus segregation in Montgomery, Alacema.

He has been active in Negro segregation matters since that time.

On 9/10/62 5:66

advised that on the afternoon of that date

Clarence Jones, a member of the Labor Youth League in 1954 (a cited organization)

and Levison were discussing burning of churches in the South, both expressed the

upinion that King should not be silent in this matter but should send a hot wire to :

"Kennedy" expressing his indigance at the Government's failure to control one

small community. This was furnished to the Attorney General од 9/11/62.

RECONCENDATION:

Consideration has been given to contacting King to straighten him out;

however, this seems undesirable in view of the above facts and it is recommended

he not be contacted.

The hackground informa fion regarding King, Levison and Zinn has

been furnished to the Department.

Nothing would seem to be gained by contacting the "New York Times"

or the "Atlanta Constitution" as we obviously canrot give them background cata

me possess on the CP influence of King.

The Department and the Attorney General have been publicly

criticized on many occasions by King and yet they are cooperating with him.

It is recommended that the Liaison Section of the Domestic Intelligence

¡Division bring bing's comments in the article to the attention of Staff Director

Berl I, Bernhard of the U. S. Commission on Civil Rights and point out to him:

that there is no basis in fact for King's remarks and in addition point out that 4 ci

WFO 157-1292

In regard to SNCC, WFO is probing for weaknesses which

may be uncovered through sources in endeavoring to ascertain the

identity of individuals who may be dissatisfied because of

personality clashes and/or those who may be disenchanted with

volunteer services for SNCC and have sought a salary; and those

who may be suspect of "working for the man", 1. e., suspect of

being an informer.

In regard to STOKELY CARMICHAEL, UFO has carefully - •

considered him from a counterintelligence

standpoint since his

arrival in WDC to take up residence in January, 1968. However,

no positive program has been developed due to the fact that the

sedition investigation has been under active consideration from

a prosecutive standpoint, and it was felt that a simultaneous

counterintelligence program if operational against CARMICHAEL

might tend to aggravate possible future prosecution and possibly

lead to embarrassment.

WFO feels that a positive counterintelli-

gence program would be warranted against CARMICHAEL, especially

in the absence of any prosecutive action against him. In

assessing CARMICHAEL for potential counterintelligence, WEO has

concluded that to be effective, such a program must discredit

him in the Negro community where he enjoys considerable popu-

larity, and would seemingly have to be stronger than alleged immoral

or un-American political inclinations.

Concerning the Southern Christian Leadership Conference

(SCIC) and the Washington Spring Project (WSP) office in HDC,

sources who are familiar with SCLC operations have been instructed

to look for opportunities to plant seeds of discontent and

dissension between the SCLC and the American Friends Service

Committee (AFSC) workers there, particularly in the realm of

funds; and to give rise to rumors that KING seems to be getting

the lion's share of the funds, whereas the AFSC and the poor

people who are to participate are getting little or nothing

In the way of financial aid. It has been developed that WSP

recruiter J. I. JOHNSON; since transferred, was at the center

of a controversy concerning dissension in the office. WO is

in the process of developing further plans exploiting this

dissension.

WFO 157-1292

fith regard to MARTIN LUTHER KING, WFO will continue

to be alert for all possibilities to secure information of value

in counterintelligence

and for use in the program. It is felt,

however, that the office of origin in this matter is in a better

position to fully evaluate and be aware of possibilities to

exploit in this program.

There is no organized Revolutionary Action Movement

(RAM) activity in the WDC area which has risen to the surface;

however, in the event any situation should arise which would

lend itself to a counterintelligence move, steps will be taken

to fully pursue that matter.

A source has advised that the Congress of Racial

Equality (CORE) is not currently active in WDC; that it has

no organizational structure or planned program of activity.

CORE has held no. meetings in the past year.

WO is also looking for opportunities to develop

positive information concerning H. RAP BROWN in this area in

order to possibly effect a workable counterintelligence operation.

5) As noted above, WFO will continue to exploit all

possibilities and opportunities to institute a successful

counterintelligence program on the mentioned targets and upon

the formulation of a specific plan on any particular organiza-

tion or individual, will submit same by separate letter for

the Bureau's approval.

With reference to Bulets of 3/18/68 and 4/2/68, in

the above caption outlining counterintelligence situations

with reference to SNCC and the Black United Front, these matters

will be taken up by separate letters to the Bureau.
