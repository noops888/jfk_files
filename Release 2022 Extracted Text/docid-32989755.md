It is equally clear that these things are direct

: contradictions of the principles ‘underlying the legitimate

eivil rights movement: a nonviolent approach, econbined
Regro-shite action, and the elimination of racisa.

Hi The grent Anerican tragedy of our tine vould be
the failure of Martin Luther King, r., to reet the current

challenge which “blacks power” represents to the civil yagnts

“povenent. Hig fadlure to do so would mean that for gone

reason King is willing to let the legitimate civil rights
movenent die. This, in turn, would seea to indicate that
Zing*s goal is different than that ef Wilkins, Randolph and

calculated one. "The Atlanta Journal” of. Cctober 13, 1955,

with his advisors. Undoubtedly the move Wilkins, Randolph
and Young proposed to make through the. issuance of public
statenent was known to King and he was seeking nevico on

what his stand should be.

OBSERVATIONS: From the above, it is apparent that’ King i:
in dire need of funds. Secondiy, he dislikes going to
HOfifa because of Hoffa's unsavory reputation. King
. undoubtedly feels that this association might reflect
unfavorably upon’his public image. On the other hand,
it would appear Hoffa might be concerned with the white
backlash within his own union ranks should it become
known that union funds may be expended to promote Negro
objectives. It is therefore felt that both men have
just reason for keeping this meeting secret. Any .
publicity concerning it would probably i be extremely
embarrassing to both parties. tose
It would appear that the meeting may° fe virtually
’ spontaneous and time in this “instance could be very critical.

alert iricndaly news media of the mecting once the meeting

a RE: MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.
: SECURITY MATTER - COMMUNIST

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS:
At a staff meeting recently, King Sanpen ea:

the Ford Foundation had granted his organization a quarter .

of a million dollars. King did not state how this. money [|

was going to be used. cases

OBSERVATIONS: feta ot teste SSS eels

. It is interesting to note that King's “group .
will only get $250,000, a large sum, but considerably
smaller than the original amount. Perhaps our measures
had some effect in causing this reduction. In view of
King's current announcements indicating he will hold a
camp-in at Washington, D. C., across from the White House, .
it is felt the Président would be extremely interested tL
in the source of these new funds being made available
to SCLC. :

3% AMUSE RILEY PIERCS,WR.

J

For sdOme nonths I have been thinking about this matter. One
ay I had ah opportunity to explore this fron a philosophical and
sciological standpoint with Dr. Frank R. Barnett, whem I have known for
ome years, As I previously reported, Barnett is a very able fellow,
former Oxford scholar and professor, and one on whom I can rely. I
ed Barnett to give the mnatter’some attention and if he knew any

egro of outstanding intelligence and ability let me know and we would
ve a discussion. LEarnett has submitted to me the name of the above- -
sptiored person, Samuel Riley, Pierce, Jr. -

Enclosed with this memcrandun is an outline of Pierce's
ography which is truly remarkable for a man so young, having been born
ptember &, 1922, On scanning this biography, it will be seen that
~eree does have all the qualifications of the kind of a Negro i have
mind to advance to positions of national leadership. I won?t go into
l his accomplishments and aqualizications in this memorandun, for it
11 only take a minute or two to scan tke enclosed biography.

- On first blush I know it can be said it is not the concern of

+~ Bureau what happens to the Negroes when Martin Luther King has
. Giscredited, This can be said, but I think it is a very short-
ted view. It is_our_concern if larga on £ them™go inte the
tion of Islam and other extremist groups with which we are concerned as
stigative agency, It_is our concern if the Communist Farty would
able to capitalize upon is confusion, Further, trom a rositive

castructive

a truly brilliant, honorable and loyal Negro

lion Negroes 2 y from communism, I think in a very
necessarily must be of great interest to us. It vould

Oo have a ran like Pierce leading the Wegroes to whom we
ssary, and rely upon in seneitive matters over which this

wi want to make it clear at once that I don’t propose “that
in any yay become involved onenly as the sponsor cf a Negro lez
vershadoy Martin Luther King. As far as I am concerned, this is not
esu2 at all. But i do propose that I be given permission to explore
her this entire mattér with Frank Barnett and any other person known
oth Barnett and myself who could be helpful. Z this thing can be

up properly witheut the Bureau in any way becoming directly involved,
nink it would be not only a great help to the. FEI but would b2 2 fine
2g for the country at large. While I am net specifying at this moment,
re are yarious ways in which the FBI could give this entire natter

made an editorial expression which”
‘stated, among other things, thatDr. Mar-
“tin Luther King had strayed oft onto an
pomremely dangerous course -which ran

the opposite direction trom the civil
rights leadership course that vast]
‘numbers of citizens-had come to knowi

years. a
. Now, we wish to make it sryeeal clear:
: * that this newspaper, of course, respects
ahd upholds Dr. King’s right to take a
- position that is, what we think to be,
- contrary to good judgement. If he wishes -
to be the spokesman tor the ‘peaceniks’,
-that’s his business. When, however, Dr.

* King joins with others and tries toimpose

fcommunity which 15 already beset with;

more in-depth and complicated problems!
than can apparently be coped with, at that
+ point we call it our business,

FORWARD TIMES takes the position”
that Dr. King’s visit to Houston next
Tuesday night is an imposition upon this
community of the first order. We also
think that the fact that he is shrouding
his “tremarks” behind a big name popu-

joor poor judgement upon the entire Negro

“lar singer like Aretha Franklinsuggests .

subterfuge. If Aretha Franklin, who is
“now at the peak of fame, permits this
group of ‘peaceniks’ to use her name to
further their efforts, all that we cay say)
is, ‘‘that?s her business.” If she wakes up"
plater and finds that she has acted just,
ike Tokyo Rose and Axis Sally, all that
swe can say is that she broughtitall upon
herselt. :

. "Poor People's Crusade" on Washington, D. C.- The story . SE
continued, "By his own non-violent standards, the rehearsal =:

“as early as April 3 and not later than April 5, 1968, for _

_ another mass march and was quoted as saying, “We are, going

The story stated that the question being asked in Memphis,
the nation, and the world is whether - with the increasing .
militancy of black youth - anyone can say with certainty
that a non-violent demonstration will stay that way.

‘King stated in the interview, "YT am convinced
we can have a non-violent demonstration" but was reported
as adding that it would be impossible to "guarantee" that:

there would not be any violence. The. ore stated that it
was significant that King was more than a half hour late
for his 11:30_A.M. press conference because he was meeting
with three members of a Black Power group, which the paper

- yveferred to as "The Invaders." . BeVier stated that these
Eaeat three young.men refused to give their names and stated that
: they would give their own press conference at a later time. - :

7 "The story continued that King ‘was staying an a
$29 2 a day room at the Holiday Inn Rivermont, also. known as”
the Rivermont Hotel. King claimed to the newspaper that he
did not realize when he-came to Memphis that there were those.
;, in the Negro community who were "talking about violence."
_ He stated, "We (SCLC) had no part in the planning of the
_ march. Our intelligence was nil." He said that if he had --
known there were persons likely to start violence, he would
have had them made parade marshals, a move which the said had
been successful in other marches. oo Set

He was. reported as ‘being critical of ‘the’ ‘press et
.> for Goottans that he left the march in haste after the

7 calmly because he said, "I will, not lead a violent march."
He said that while he "walked" with aides to a car, he was
“agonizing over what had happened.": The story reported that
Assistant Police Chief Henry Lux had earlier said over the
police radio at approximately 11:27 A.M., Thursday,
March 28, 1968, that the march was apparently without leader-
Ship as. Dr. King had asked for a police escort away from.

Washington plans for his Poor People's Crusade to commence

that King claimed’ that Thursday, March 28, 1968, march was
-"poorly planned". which the paper said amounts to criticism i
- of Rev. James MY. Lawson, Jr., whom Dr. King himself had called
“the leading non-violenze theoretician in the country." The
paper reported that Lawson is in charge of the strategy for
. the Memphis Negro ministers, also known as COME,.and is pastor
of the Centenary Methodist Church and continued ‘that Lawson
did not entirely agree with King's assessments.

The story stated for instance that King: had said -
that the Black Power advocates with whom he met earlier had -
said that there had been a lack of communication between them
and the ministers and that they felt "rejected." Rev. Lawson

> was quoted by the paper as saying, "There has been communication. -
I don’t accept. that,” referring to King’s statement. The
paper said that it was Rev. Lawson who had originally asked
-King to come to Memphis and that for about 10 years Lawson
-has served in an advisory capacity with SCLC. It stated that
‘Lawson agreed with King that a non-violent demonstration is --
-. possible and pointed out that this was one of the reasons
+ -. King was asked to come to Memphis. Lawson stated, "We didn't
: bring in Rap Brown (national chairman of the “Student” Non-.
: Violent Coordinating Committee); we’ brought in King." He
"- was reported to have further said that there were other
* reasons for bringing in King, one being to give the movement.
-in Memphis a "national image" and another was to strengthen
: the leadership of the Memphis ministers. oa eo

: . The same’ March '30,. ‘1968, ‘issue ‘of The Commercial
7 _Appeal newspaper had a lead editorial on page 6 “entitled,
. "King's Credibility Gap,’’ which stated that!"'Martin Luther

..for.all Negro public school students to cut classes at. the:

.. The escalation came Thursday when Dr. King led a supposedly

’ non-violent protest march from Clayborn Temple to Beale

’ Street, west on Beale to Main, and.a block north on Main. He
got what he asked - to an embarrassing extent. Negro students
did play truant by the thousands and were joined by hundreds —
‘of other young Negroes in their 20's who turned the march
into a riot and left Beale Street and a short section of Main
in utter ruin. Photographs and eyewitness accounts identify
those who did the destruction and the looting - the children
and young people whom Dr. King had told to stay out of .

attempting to disassociate himself from the violence that he

pose as leader of a non-violent movement has been shattered.
He now has thé entire nation doubting his word when he :

The neeting produced no tangible results insofar as cooperation, -

the white man. In reaction to these remarks publicly, KING
f@lossed over this criticism and to some degree capitalized on it,
indicating that in his efforts to build unified support for the
cause of the Negro, he was in contact with all segments of Negro -
opinion, Indeed, as recently as 8/67, MUHAMMAD indicated a desire
to again meet with KING to discuss the unity of the Negro.

As the Bureau and Atlanta are aware, KING and CASSIUS -
CLAY were in personal contact in Louisville, Kentucky, in 5/67,
in the course of o housing cemonstr 1s held under SoIe
suspices. = Sta .

: In subsequent newspaper publicity concerning this meeting,
KING was quoted 4s having praised CLAY for his refusal to be 7
inducted into the armed forces, coupling this reference to attacks
on our policy in Vietnam, The NOL publication "Muhammad Speaks"

was one of the papers which contained KING's favorable remarks,
including a comment that CIAY had given up $1,000,000 in order

to stand up for what his conscience dictated as right,

In short it would appear generally to be true that
contact between KING and the NOL is not a heretofore unknown happening
and it would appear that any effort to utilize this situation in
Baltinve-must indicate more than casual associations or contacts,
but-is order to embarrass or inhibit WSP efforts should indicate a
close working relationship or partneuship between the two groups.

It should be kept in mind also, however, that as the
above sources note, although CIAY is nationally known for his
adherance to the NOI, he is also somewhat universally acclaimed
and embraced by most grouvs within the Black Nationalist Movement,
GORE and SACC as examples, as well as the black communi generally
and bas achieved somewhat the status of a mortyred black folk hero.

OBSERVATIONS: SEE

returns of King might well reveal information which could assist the
Bureau in its efforts to discredit King or neutralize his effective-
Iness, This is possibly applicable also if the income tax returns of
the SCLC and the Gandhi Society were reviewed. In view of the possi-
bility that the SCLC has already been under some investigation by IRS,

_. @ request for the results of such investigation is indicated, We also

—---had information in late 1953 that the Gandhi Society was negotiating

; with IRS relative to tax exemptions and therefore the results of any
IRS investigation of that Society would be worth procuring, |.

| It is believed that an examination of recent - income tax

To date we have been most discreet and circumspect in our’ _
han¢ling of the King investigation, as well es corollary investiga-
tions such as revolving around organizations, because of the position»
King hes not only as a clergyman, but also as a “respected” Negro
Yeader, It is therefore essential thai our current requests of the
IRS which are herein being recommended be handled in a manner which

7 | woura provide for optimum security so that neither King nor any other

bunauthorized individuals may becone aware of the Bureau's interest
and so that no embarrassment may come to the Bureau, For this reason,
the attached memoranéa are classified "Secret,"

. RECOMMENDATION:

It is recommended that the Liaison Section obtain two
uncertified copies of each of the income tax returns available for

Reference is made to the enclosed material on whic

NEGLO QUESTION
30-3-75 .

t would stand up in testimony in court or before Congressional
aittees that the Communist Party, USA, does wield substantial
fluence over Negroes which one day could become decisive.

The memorandum which the Director penetratively questioned,
.ile showifig in the details the communist impact on Negroes, did
fier from such limitations. These limitations we will make every
ort to lift in the future, The great amount of attention this
vision is giving to communist activities directed toward the Negro
ould enable us” to do this.

For example, here at the Seat of Government, the Negro -
unist question takes up 2s a whole the time of one supervisor and
ng the past few weeks four men have been so occupied. Additionally,
.) specialized instructions are regularly given the field on communist
filtration of the Negro; (2) monographs have been written on the
bject and widely disseminated; (3) regularly disseminated are memoranda
reports; (4) August 21, 1963, we devoted the entire Current Intelli- paw
nee Analysis to the communist plans for the Negro March of August 28, ~
(149 copies of this Analysis were disseminated to 44 agencies of
:@ Government), (5) much material on the issue is given to Agents at
Service; and (6) an SAC Letter is under preparation in this Division-
« giving the field the benefit of what we learned from the Negro March
Washington and issuing instructions for increased coverage of
uaunist influence on the Negro.

‘| As the memorandum pointed out, "this Nation is involved in a
rm of racial revolution and the time has never been so right for
loitation °° the Negroes by éommunist propagandists." Kineteen million
-sroes constitute ‘the “greatest single racial target of the Communist :
rty, USA. This is a sombre reclity we must never lose sight of. We f
11 do everything possible in the troubled future to develop for the 7
rector all available facts relating to Negro membership in the Communist
.rty, plus the more complex and difficult to ascertain influence i

communist organizations and officials over the leaders and masses of ,
-groes. _

We regret greatly that the memorandum did not measure up to
at the Director has a right to expect from,our analysis.

it The 19 million Negroes in BBS D Unite States today :

constitute the largest and most important racial target of ot eal Loma?
‘Communist Party, USA. Since 1919 communist Ieaders have deviséd saa
ntless tactics and programs designed to penetrate and.control . .
\ro population. It has spent’ hundreds of thousands of dollars :
agandizing the Negroes in a variety of ways. These colossal . -
Sorts havé been related to “equal opportunity" and “"self-
(determination policies (the latter being discontinued in 1959 ei
with the approval of Soviet Russia because,it was ineffective), {
front organizations, parades, denonstrations, articles, pamphlets, |
books, films, speeches, civil rights, “peacezul coexistence," F
et cetera, These ef forts, anong other things, have resulted in. e
establishing today such active Negro communist. front groups as
ithe African fmerican Heritage Association, Freedomy vays Associates,
‘and Southern Conference Educational Fund (not yet cited by the
Attorney General), Additionally, efforts have been and are being
made to infiltrate with limited degrees of success such legitimate
Negro organizations as the National Association for the Advance-
fient of Colored People, the Negro American Labor Council, and the
Southern Christian Leadership Conference headed by Martin Luther °
ing, Jr. Other legitimate Negro organizations not known to be
infiltrated, influcnced or controlled but are targets include
Congress of Racial Equality, National Urban League and the

While much propaganda is issued, there is nb

mmunist Party has done-all possible to exploit a great na
mumber of events and issues among Negroes such as the ©
Scottsbozo Case;. Emmett Till Case; Hontgomery,-Alaboma, bus
boycott; 1956 Harch on Washington, D.C.; 1957 Prayer Pilgrimage

an adi Stanley Levi . iz:

tho Communist Party, USa, egro during the past
44 years, the Party has failed to reach its goal with the
Negroes. The Director, on January 26, 1960, said publicly:
M2-is no secret that one of the. bitterest disappointnents
mmunistic efforts in this Nation has been their failure
xure our Negro citizens into the party. Despite every. type
je propagantia boomed at our Nation's Negro citizens, they have
never succumbed to the party's saccharine promises of a ~
Communist Utopia. This generation and generations to ccme .

who have conSistently refused to surrender their freedoms fo
the tyranny of communism." : ee :

the United States or 19 million. If one was to apply this
breakdown to Gus Hall's figure of 10,000 Communist Party
members today, it would give to the Party 1,000 Negro members.
(Applied to our classified figure of 4,453 active Communist
Party members, the estimated nunber of Negro communists would
be 445, ,This would not, of course, include comaunist sympathizers,

Memorandum to Mr. Belmont
RE: RACIAL SITUATION

Howard Zinn, the author of the report for the Southern Regional
Council, was mentioned in my memorandum 11/15/62 and has been the subject
of 2 security investigation by this Bureau (100-360217). Zinn was reportedly
a member of the CP from 1949 through 1953 and attended CP meetings during
that period. Zinn is a history professor at Spellman College in Atlanta, It
was the second slanted and biased document written by Zinn on the Albany
situation. era .

: Reverend Mr. King is the ‘President of the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference who arose to prominence during the 1955 - 1956
successful boycott which ended bus segregation in hiontgomery, Alabama.
He has been active in Negro segregation matters since that time.

Several weeks ago FORWARD TIMES
made an editoriai expression which
istated, among other things, that Dr. Mar-
“tin Luther King had strayed ott onto an
pomremely dangerous course which ran j}
iin the opposite direction trom the civil i
jrights leadership course that vastl
7 “numbers of citizens-had come to snot!
“and respect him tor over a wide ; Span ot *
years.
Now, we wish to make it eoystat clear.
at this newspaper, of course, respects
ahd upholds Dr. King’s right to take a
- position that is, what we think to be,
* . contrary to good judgement. If he wishes -
to be the spokesman tor the ‘peaceniks’,
- that’s his business. When, however, Dr.
-' King joins with others and tries to impose
that poor judgement upon the entire Negro
community which 1s already beset with,
more in-depth andcomplicated problems!
than can apparently be coped with, at that!
: point we call it our business,

FORWARD TIMES takes the position
that Dr. King’s visit to Houston next
Tuesday night is an imposition upon this
community of the first order. We also
think that the fact that he is shrouding
his ‘‘remarks’ behind a big name popu-

“lary singer like Aretha Franklin suggests
subterfuge. If Aretha Franklin, who is
“now at the peak of fame, permits this
group of ‘peaceniks’ to use her name to
further their efforts, ali that we cay say)
is, ‘‘that’s her business.” If she wakes up"
flater and finds that she has acted just,
Vike Tokyo Rose and Axis Sally, all that
dre can say is that she brougntit all upon
herselt,
Our concern is not so much with what
course Dr. King and Miss Franklinelect
.to tollow, Swnet concernsus is that the in-

t
t

i

jbold truth is that we are shooting ‘live’ ,

“realistically, we cannot escape the fact

nocent public, if not properly fore-

warned, might be taken in by their visit!
to Houston. We think thatifwhatDr. King

#has to say isn’t within itselt meritorious -°
iH enough to draw a crowd, he shouldn’t be _

coming to town in the first place to say’

rardua” for Mr. Pelmont {
SAMUSL RILEY PLERCE,|

. For some months I have been thinking about this matter. One
‘ny I had an opportunity to explore this from a philosophical and
ciological standpoint with Dr, Frank 2. Barnett, whom I have known for
@ years. As I previously reported, Barnett is a very able fellow,
. former Cxford scholar and professor, and ore on whom I can rely. i
cked Barnett to give the natter’some attention and if he knew any
ro of outstanding intelligence and ability let me know and we would
ave a discussion, Barnett has submitted to me the name of the above— -
aptioned person, Samuel Riley Pierce, Jr. 7 -

Enclosed with this nenorandun is an outline of Pierce's
graphy which is truly remarkable for a man so young, having been born
“ptember 8, 1922, On scanning this biography, it wiil be seen that
ce does have all the qu2lifications of the kind of a Hegro I have
= mind to adyance to positions of national leadership. z won?t go into
Ll his accomplishzents and qualigications in this memorandun, for it
1 only take a minute or two to scan the enclosed biography.

“~ Bureas what happens to the Negroes when Martin Luther King has
. Giscredited. This can be said, b i th it is a very short-
It is_our_concern if Lacke “runbers of thon” go inte the

e@ standpoint it would be of great advantage ‘to
y people a truly brilliant, honorable and loyal Negro who would

arrest tickets, which is definitely not a complete list,
indicates that at least ten Negroes arrested had pistols

‘had other lethal weapons such as knives,

Lieutenaxt Arkin advised that at approximately 1:20

p.m, March 28, 1968, the Memphis Transit Authority which
operates the Memphis City Bus System, after receiving numerous
complaints from its bus drivers that they feared for their
personal well being due to the disorder, coupled with the
fact that many of them had been individually robbed in the
past, decided as a safety measure to stop the movement of
City Buses for the remainder of March 28, 1968,

The Memphis ‘Commercial Appeal" Newspaper, issue of
March 29, 1968, in a front-page story, by an unidentified
writer, reported that many of the looters and window breakers
were black power advocates, and that several wore jackets of
. the "Invaders," a Local black power group, This story did

‘that many high school age students have done this for effect

about the presence of Reverend MARTIN LUTHER KING in
Chicago and stated that KING pai visited him here in
Chicago sone time aso. This gave me an opportunity to
ask him his impression of KIn o. His Excellency stated
that this wos the first occasion he had talked with KING

and.«he was “not inpressed". He stated that during the
conversation, KIS “exnaibited 2 very. glib tongue and His
* [Excellency could not help but question ais BSS in His

e tversation between KING and His Excellency would remain in
strictest confidence. He pointec. out, however, that ‘the
ipFess was “conveniently availablg" outside, the Archbishop's
esidence upon the departure of KING and KIUG spoke at
- eens ength to the press concerning his visit with the Arch-
ishop, even though the two men had agreed the conversation
as confidential.

I then, in strictest confidence, briefed His
’ Excellency along the lines discussed with Assistant Director
SULLIVAN. It was cbvious that His Excellency sincerely
im appreciated receiving this information and indicated to me
that he would ‘be most circumspect in his dealings with KING.

His Excellency is a very forceful individual, and
fron his comments:‘and demeanor, I feel certain that he will
do everything possible to neutralize KING's effect in this
area.

FROM :M..

suajecr: ARTICLE IN "THE NATION" FOR
FEBRUARY 4, 1961, BY :
MARTIN LUTHE “ING, dR.

Beginning on page 91 of the captioned magazine Reverend King has an pavt pf;
article entitled "The President Has The Power--Equality Now.'"' A copy of the
magazine is attached. (Ww

As would be expected King's article is a plea for faster integration of the
races and he particularly makes the point that much can be-done by the Kennedy
administration through Executive Order and example which has not been done in
previous administrations. At the top of page 94 the following statement regarding
the Bureau and other law enforcement agencies is made:

"Tf, for instance, the law-enforcement personnel

| in the FBI were integrated, many persons who now defy federal
law might come under restraints from which they are presently
free. If other law-enforcement agencies under the Treasury -
Department, such as the Internal Revenue Service, the Bureau
of Narcotics, the Alcohol Tax Unit, the Secret Service and
Customs had an adequate number of field agents, investigators -
and administrators who were Negro, there would be a greater
respect for Negroes as well as the assurance that prejudicial
behavior in these agencies toward citizens would cease." (& \

This is the only reference to the Bureau found in the article. Martin Luthe®
King, Jez, is well known for his activities in behalf of the National Association for
the Advancement of Colored People in the south, and he reportedly planned the bus
boycotts” in Montgomery, Alabama, and has participated in sét-in demonstrations in
the south. He has been very active in attempts to integrate the races.and Bufiles
contain numerous references to his activities in this regard. (& }

NAL COPY Be

1 Sea will also be recalled that just prior to the election King was put in jail
and Président Kennedy reportedly called him and was successful in obtaining his
release. Some political analysts have stated that the President's action in calling
King resulted in his receiving a heavy ale vote in many, fade of the country.

Re: MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.

Reverend King resigned his ministry in the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church of
Montgomery, Alabama, early in February, 1960, and became co-pastor with
_ his father in the Ebenezer Baptist Church, Atlanta, Georgia. (100-106670) ( uw)

: Although King is in error in his comments relating to the FBI, itis

SUBJECT: SOUTHERN CHRISTIAN. LEADERSHIP _CONFERENCE
INTERNAL SECURITY - COMMUNIST F

PURPOSE: Attached for your approval is an airtel to our
Atlanta Office instructing them to conduct a survey for
possible technical coverage of the Southern Christian
eadership Conference (SCLC) Headquarters where Martin Luther
_Jr., is planning massive civil disobedience to disrup
tén to fifteen major cities in the United States including

Washington, D. C. oh,
‘ Y

BACKGROUND: Since August, 1967, Martin Luther King, ae
Presidmt SCLC has publicly stated his group will stage
a massive civil disobedience to disrupt ten to fifteen age thers
major cities throughout the Nation. He has also stated Ei

recently that he will call the poor, the sick and the needy j
to our Nation's capital to disrupt its operation in an Dvd i
effort to spur Congressional action to help the plight of j

the Negro, This may even include a camp~in at the White ot PE.

King has stated in part, "To dislocate the function of a
city without destroying it can be more effective than a riot.'y

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS: King recentiy held a one week retreat
to pian his campaign in this regard. He is attempting to
recruit 2,000 leaders throughout the Nation to effect this
plan. Two individuals have been assigned to Washington, D. C.,
and other cities to start recruiting. The early Spring of 1968
is the target date to start massive civil disobedience if
certain demands regarding economic, housing and education
legislation does not receive unequivocal commitment for prompt
Congressional action, seeuee( ene
- wok i
OBSERVATIONS: Because of the effect this plan of King's will
have on the racial movement and even possibly the internal
security of the United States itself, we feel it is most
necessary to have telephone surveillance coverage on King's
headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia, where most of the planning
concerning this operation will tae Pee:

RE: SOUTHERN CHRISTIAN LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE

In the past, we have had a telephone surveillance
on SCLC, which was extremely productive, but it was dis-
continued on 6-20-66 upon receipt of instructions from
Attorney General Nicholas deB. Katzenbach. He was concerned
about jeopardizing the possible prosecution of a SCLC employee
for an Interstate Transportation of Stolen Motor Vehicles
statute violation. On June 1, 1967, the Department advised
the evidence against the SCLC employee was of insufficient
strength to warrant prosecution. Since there are no prosecutive
matters which this installation will jeopardize, it is felt
it should be reinstalled.

RECOMMENDATION: That the attached airtel be sent to Atlanta
so that a survey can be conducted to determine the feasibility
of installing a secure installation on SCLC Headquarters.

Upon receipt of results of survey from Atlanta, appropriate
communication will be sent to the Attorney General requesting
authority for this installation.

Reference is made to your inquiry concerning the
telephone surveillance on the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference which was discontinued on 6/21/66 upon instructions
of the Attorney General,

A telephone surveillance was instituted on the
headquarters of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference,
330 Auburn Avenue, Northeast, Atlanta, Georgia, on November 8,
1963. The Southern Christian Leadership Conference is a
racial-type organization headed by Martin Luther King, Jr.

This telephone surveillance provided considerable
valuable intelligence information concerning communist.
influence on the Southern Christian Leadership Conference
through King, as well as the communist influence evident in
fq the outspoken position which King had taken in opposition to
the United States foreign policy concerning Vietnam.

.A memorandum from the Director dated 4/28/66 was
‘forwarded to the Attorney General pointing out the valuable
coverage being provided by the telephone surveillance on the Kad?
Southern Christian Leadership Conference, Authorization was “lh.
requested to continue the surveillance for an additional six
months, The memorandum was returned by the Attorney General with
a notation dated 6/20/66, stating "] think this coverage should
be discontinued, particularly, in light of possible charges of
a criminal nature against Hosea Williams and possibly others."
The Attorney General's notation concerning Hosea Williams
referred to an Interstate Transportation of Stolen Motor
Vehicles case under investigation by the Bureau wherein the
principle subject, Harold Belton Andrews, alleged he stole
four automobiles for subsequent sale to the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference headed by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.

Memorandum to Mr, Sullivan
Re: SOUTHERN CHRISTIAN LEADERSHIP .
CONFERENCE

Investigation disclosed that one of these stolen vehicles

had been in the possession of Hosea Williams, Director of
Voter Registration for King's organization. Due to the
ramification involving the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference and the civil rights movement, the Criminal
Division of the Department has been directing the prosecution
in this case rather than the U. S. Attorney.

On 7/28/66, Harold Belton Andrews and Morris Finley
were tried and convicted in U. S. District Court at Atlanta
on charges of Interstate Transportation of Stolen Motor
Vehicles. Hosea Williams was not prosecuted nor indicted,

‘Atlanta Office report in this case dated 8/30/66 set forth that
Assistant U. S. Attorney Allen L. Chancey advised that U. S.
District Judge Sidney O. Smith stated he did not know the
exact date that Andrews and Finley would be sentenced,

Judge Smith indicated he desired to withhold sentencing
until such time as the Department of Justice determined
whether or not additional individuals involved in the case
were to be tried, The report was disseminated to the
Department.

approximately 2:20p.m. In his office were his wife, Assistant Attorney
General Vinson, Assistant Attorney General Pollack, his Executive Assistant
Sol Lindenbaum and the Deputy Attorney eral, Warren Christopher.

The Attorney General tirst congvétulated the FBI and stated that "7
this was the greatest news he had ever heard. He next went into a long
song and dance on the absolute necessity of security and the avoidance of
evasion of civil rights of the subject, James Earl Ray. The Attorney.

- General asked me questions concerning the quality of our Agent personnel
- in London and J told him we had absolute faith and confidence in these men,

. otherwise we would not have assigned them there. He stated he thought we
should send additional men to London to assist in thiscase, I+ told him ~
I thought this was both foolish and unnecessary. : He asked me about
Legal Attache Minnich'’s background a andi provided this infosmation far -
him. He asked me-if the FBI had a representative in the same cell block
_with the subject. I told him we did not and that furthermore, inasmuch as
this man was under British custody, we could not even talk to the prisoner
unless he, the prisoner, agreed to interrogation. The Attorney General —~
asked if we had a man next to the cell block. I told him we did not and that °
he must realize that this man was under British custody and, therefore,

- not the responsibility of American authorities. The Attorney General
stated he would feel better if he knew the exact provisions under which
security the prisoner was being maintained. I made no comment,

: The ‘Attorney General asked me if I thought it was necessary to
send a Departmental representative to London. I told him I thought this

-} was completely unnecessary if the representative would be going for the

purpose of attempting to look into FBI activities. The Attorney General

' stated this representative would be going for the purpose of expediting

legal acffivities in connection with the extradition of the subject, He added
that the Departmental representative would also check with the British
authorities to make certain there was ample security. Furthermore, to
make certain that the prisoner's civil rights were being protected.

The Attorney General asked me whorrI thought should be responsible
for bringing the prisoner back to the United States. I told him I previously
_ discussed this with the Director and that the Director was agreeable to the

’ - FBI escorting the prisoner back'to the United States. He asked how many

men would de this. Ttoid him we would utilize three very capable men. “He

stated he thought we needed more. I told him I disagreed and-that three men

_ would be sufficient, ‘particularly if handcuffs and leg irons were used,
The Attorney General asked me if I thought military transportation or
commercial transportation should be utilized. I:told him that military
transportation would probably be better and furthermore that the plane
should land at a military base, possibly near Memphis, Tennessee, 50
that maximum security could be afforded, The Attorney General agreed,
He then called Governor Buford Ellington in Tennessee and specifically

asked him to expedite extradition proceedings by immediately making a
request to the PreBident of the United States so that the White House in
turn could forward this request to the British Home Secretary. The
Attorney General also told Governor Ellington that he would personally
feel better if Federal officers (meaning the FBI) would escort the prisoner
back to the United States. Governor Ellington agreed to all terms and
stated that he would comply with the wishes of the Federal Government
in this matter. ‘

ao . The Attorney General next turned to the Deputy Attorney General
cand asked him if he thought a Departmental representative should be sent
to England. The Deputy Attorney General replied, ‘Without question, id
The Attorney General next asked the entire group whom they thought shouid
be sent. He ventured-the personal opinion that it should either be Vinson’
or Pollack. There was no comment, The Attorney General then stated

are ‘that Vinson should go and should leave tonight, June 8, 1968. He asked

hs that Vinson be placed in touch with our Legal At tache.” I toid the

: Attorney General that sending Vinson was his own business, however, I

would like to make absolutely certain that Vinson did nothing to upset the

very excellent relationship between the FBI and Scotland Yard. I stated

that Vinson under no circumstances should attempt to push Scotland Yard

around by insisting on different types of security. “The Attorney General

repeated that Vinson would be there primarily for the purpose of expediting

legal activities. The Attorney General then told Lindenbaum to have

several Bureau of Prisons officials go to Memphis early Monday,

June 10, 1968, for the purpose of taking a look at the county jail in Memphis |

s0 that proper security could be afforded the prisoner once he was turned

over to the state authorities, (This, of course, is none of the Attorney

General's business inasmuch as once the prisoner is turned over to the

‘state he is strictly the state's responsibility.) ~ :

Upon leaving, the Attorney General told me that he would like
to sit down with me within the next several days and completely go over
this case. I told him that we had already provided him with reports in the
matter and that these reports, plus the press release of today, covered all
necessary details. He made no comment other than to commend the FBI
once again and te say that ha zd work paid off. i :

In the event extradition proceedings are successful and the FBI
is called upon to bring the. subject back to the United States, it is suggested
that Legal Attache Minnich, Special Agent Supervisor Wilbur L. Martindale
and Special Agent Supervisor Kenneth L, Bounds be assigned this responsibility.
Bounds is approximately 6 feet 4 inches tall, is in excellent physical shape,
is a former firearms instructor and is currently assigned to the General
Investigative Division here at FBI Headquarters. He has an excellent
backgzound. In the event the Director approves this recommendation, we
will have Bounds obtain a passport and the necessary medical shots so
that he can proceed to London, England, upon instructions.

I called the Attorney General (AG) at approximately 5:50 p.m. ,
dune 8, 1968, and advised him that in connection with the conversation in
his office with me, the Director had instructed me to send two men to London ,3
‘instead of one for the purpose of escorting the subject back to the United States, :
The AG was told that this would make a total of four FBI representatives
escorting the subject back to this country.

7 The AG was additionally told that the Director had instructed that,
the two men in question proceed to London as expeditiously as possible s
that they would be on the scene in the event extradition or deportation pro-
ceedings occurred faster than anticipated. He was told that towards this
end, I had called Joe Califano at the White House, who usually handled
military transportation in expedite matters of this nature, to tell him that
if he knew of a military plane proceeding to London, it would be appreciated
if the FBI representatives could hitc} eon this plane..

The AG snappishly inquired as to CA reasons why this had not
been cleared with him personally. I told him I had specifically mentioned
~ in his office the fact that three men would be suitable for escorting subject
- Ray back to the United States and that he had disagreed stating that he felt
additional men should be assigned to this project. He stated he did not recall
this exchange of conversation. I told him I recalled it very well. He stated
there was no need to get into a "spitting contest" over this particular issue
and that he wanted me to definitely realize that he did not recall such matters
being disclbded. ‘I. told | hith'I would not back down on the matter and that thé

- MEMORANDUM TO MR, TOLSON
RE: MURKIN

the Deputy Attorney General (DAG) of the United States had called me
personally and that I had refused to give him "inside facts," I replied
that when the DAG first called me this morning, I had indicated that I
had no facts to give him but that a short time later I had called the DAG
and had read to him the press release prior to the time the release was
given to the wire services. I pointed out to the AG that his Deputy had
fully approved the press release and had indicated that it was completely
within guidelines of appropriate legal proceedings, The AG replied that
e had been told differently. He stated that he had been advised that I
had not given any information whatsoever to the DAG. I stated that as
indicated in my conversation with him, the facts previously mentioned
were true. The AG replied by stating this was one of the biggest cases
the Department of Justice will ever have. He then asked me point blank,
_\|"Who the hell do you think you're working for?” He quickly added "I'l
il you who you're working for, you're working for the Department of
justice." He next added that he wanted to insist that in the future that
any information whatsoever received in this case,’ any investigative step
whatsoever, and any communications be brought to his personal attention
without delay. He stated that obviously he had been kept in the dark thusfar
and that he did not intend to put up with this in the future,

I told the AG if he insisted upon making such falsifications that
there was no need to continue the conversation. I then hung up the phone
on him, a

The AG's secretary called me back approximately three minutes
later and stated that he wanted to speak to me again. He then came on the
‘phone and told me that our conversation had not been over and that he demanded
to know why I had hung up the phone on him, 1 told him that apparently there
was no need to continue the conversation and that I did not wish to discuss it
further. He stated that he must insist, as Attorney General, that any arrange-

1) ments made concerning this case be cleared with him. He stated that in

connection with the military flight for our Agents that I should have realized
Assistant Attorney General (AAG) Vinson wanted to go on the same flight and
would have wanted to make arrangements on a personal basis with the White
House or the military personnel. I told the AG that if he wanted Vinson to go
ona military flight, this was entirely his prerogative to make his own arrange-
ments, The AG then told me he would discuss this case at greater length later

MEMORANDUM TO MR. TOLSON
RE: MURKIN

Within five minutes the AG's secretary called again and asked that
I come around to his office right away. Itook Mr. Rosen with me as a witness.
The AG had with him DAG Christopher and AAG Pollak. The conversation was
initiated by the AG and he immediately referred to his previous conversation
relating to the Agents who were going to London and the discussion which had
taken place in his office earlier during the day when I advised him that three
Agents would be available in London for the purpose of handling the subject
insofar as his return to the. United States was concerned. He reviewed what
he had said earlier and I repeated exactly the position I had previously taken.
There was a stand-off and when he recognized that I had not changed my
position, he turned to Rosen for verification at which time Rosen repeated
that it was his understanding that three Agents would be available in London
and that this matter had been thoroughly discussed at FBI Headquarters earlier.

I made no further reference to this conversation and he then turned
to what he said were the three most important considerations in this matter:
(1) Security; (2) insuring that all proper legal procedures acceptable to the
United States and Great Britain would be followed; (3) that proper interviews
would take place.

In this connection, there was a discussion concerning security and
he referred to the availability of Legal Attache Minnich. He insisted that
Minnich meet Vinson at the plane Sunday morning, June 9, 1968. Itold him
that Minnich would not be available to meet Vinson inasmuch as Minnich or
lone of our people would probably spend all night at the jail. He asked me if |
this was a true statement, I told him it was a true statement or I would not

ve made it.

He then referred to the legal proceedings that would take place.

He said that Vinson would be in complete charge of this matter, that he would
make the arrangements and insure that proper procedures be followed. He
said that Minnich would report to Vinson concerning any developments and that
the question of deportation was viewed,tavorably by him. He said if deportation
was pursued, it could be criticized from a legal standpoint insofar as he was
concerned. He said transporting the subject by any plane, military or owned

-{ by the United States Government, is not a free deportation from any country.
He said that his attorneys would be reviewing this matter and would be ina
position to make appropriate recommendations to him. He said that the legal
procedures which would be followed were obviously paramount and would have
to receive first consideration over any expedient investigative procedures. 1
told the AG at this point that we wanted him to know that the FBI had not injected

RE: MURKIN

itself into any such so-called legal procedures and that our actions up to this
date had been strictly of an investigative nature. I also advised him that I had
informed him of the attitude of the British Government with reference to their
attitude toward deportation and that this had not been an opinion of FBI repre-
sentatives in London, I stated that when I mentioned that there was a 60/40
chance that he would be deported, that this was the attitude of the British
authorities rather than our representatives. ,

|

The AG was advised that we had set in motion the obtaining of the
copy of the indictment which had been requested which indictment was returned
by the Tennessee authorities naming this subject as the person responsible for
the killing of King, that this would be made available immediately upon its
receipt and that a properly cértified copy was being obtained.

DAG Christopher asked me if the subject was being detained ona
“holding action" or as a result of a violation of British law. He was told that
the subject was being detained on the basis of entering the country with illegal
documents and because he had a loaded gun on his person.

The AG then turned to AAG Pollak. He stated he wanted him to
divorce himself from other work for the next several days and that he should
‘\supervise this case completely. The AG then turned to me and stated that he
anted Pollak to be kept advised of any communication, airtel, or cablegram
‘that might come in in connection with this case. I told the AG that any facts
hich were pertinent would be furnished to the Department. The AG then
ndicated that the meeting was over. -

T called Legal Attache Minnich upon my return to the office and
informed him that he should proceed as planned; however, under no circum-
stances should he give the impression to Vinson or the Embassy that the FBI
was injecting itself into extradition or deportation proceedings. Minnich
properly replied that he had not thusfar injected himself and that as a matter
of fact, following my call to him concerning Vinson coming over there, he had
immediately informed Embassy officials that all proceedings pertaining to
extradition or deportation would be strictly handled between Vinson, the
American Embassy and the British Government. I told Minnich that he should
be diplomatic but firm with Vinson and that under no circumsiances should
Vinson be allowed to push our personnel around. I also informed him that the
AG had been told that he, Minnich, would be unable to meet Vinson inasmuch as

ie would be spending almost full time at Scotland Yard and at the jail.

7 “BRASS. ili Serraerde

As shown id attached memorandum of May 9, 1968, from Mr.
Base to Mr. DeLoach, consideration.is given to microphone installations on.
certain properties of Albert and Catol Pepper. The proposal raises a question
concerning the legality of any action taken against the subject of this case on the
basis of information obtained from the raicrophones.. dessaueur" "BEES

a

: to Swe believe ‘these microphones can be installed and used without
prejuditing the case against the subject. In a very recent decision of the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York, a listening device
‘was installed on! “the premises of one Levine. Later, a subject named Granello,
an, associate of Levine, came up for trial and claimed that the listening device
installed on Levirss premises, which was installed by trespass, was illegal as
to him, Granello. It was not contended that any information obtained from the
Levine microphone was used as evidence against Granelio at tal either directly
or asalea@. The court held that since Granello had no interest i in the Levine
premises, the monitor was not illegal as to him and he could not obiain a new
trial or dismissal of the indictment. U.S. v. Granello, 280 ae “Supp. 482 (1968). .

Applied to instant case, this rule of law could work out in different
ways. Assuming that the subject of this case is nat on thé premises to be.,
surveilled by the means suggested, and has no possessory or tther right 3 in .
those premises, any information disclosed by the surveillance in some ‘way,
such.as conversation among the Peppers,. could be used to learn the whereabouts
‘ of the subject for purposes of axrest.; The problem becomes somewiiat more
complicated, however, if he, subjec ect ‘of this, ease made a telephone Gall to those
premises and that telephont al were Hedorded and used as the basiseiér his -,
apprehension. He then covld ¢laim that th e surveillance violated Big right of
privacy in the telephone echt lnickeiesh othade to that place, clting’the Bate

: however, = assuming that we follow the precautionary measures listed below -

. bim on that knowledge. The rule that comes into play here, established inthe

Memorandum J. J. Casper to Mr. Mohr
RE: MARKIN

‘The worst that could happen in either of the above circumstances,
is that we illegally learn where the subject is located and thus are able to arrest

last century by the Supreme Court in Ker y. Illinois, 30 U.S. 347 (1886), is that
an illegal arrest is no bar to prosecution. Wong Sun v. U.S., 371 U.S. 471 (1963);
U.S. v. Hoffman, 385 F2d 501 (1967); Keegan v. U.S., 385 F2d 260 (1967). A
person may be arrested unlawfully and actually kidnapped into the court having
jurisdiction of the criminal case, yet the court still retains jurisdiction to try

the person for the offense. The court would not allow the prosecution to use

as evidence any information obtained through the illegal surveillance but the :
illegal surveillance would not taint the use of any other evidence obtained either
before or after and which was gotten ina legal manner. Nor, to ‘repeat, would

the illegality of the arrest alone, résulting from whereabouts disclosed by unlawful
surveillance, prevent the court from trying the subject for the offense.

Tf the action being considered is taken, we strongly suggest a
precautionary measures, as follows:

: (1) That all recordings be preserved intact. It may be necessary
to disclose some of them to the court or even to the defense.

(2) That no use be made of any information obtained against
anyone whatsoever or in any way whatsoever except for the single purpose of
locating the subject in this case. As we well know by this time, evidence of
the offense obtained in this manner is not admissible. It would not bé-admissible
against the subject and it would not be admissible against the Peppers on a charge
of harboring.

a (8) Be aware that since this pone and seizure is unconstitutional
as to the Peppers, they have at least a theoretical cause of action for damages
against those who installed the devices by trespass. Here again, however, if
nothing learned by this surveillance is used against the Peppers in any way, theiz
cause of action is diminished to the lowest possible degree, becoming that for a
technical violation only rather than one of substantial harm to them. Moreover,
in any such case the government of the United States should surely be willing to
pick up the tab for any judgment had against those who installed the microphones.

RECOMMENDATION:

For information.

Memorandum to Mr. DeLoach
RE: MURKIN

Under the statute being used the complaint can be filed in any
District in which the conspiracy took place or an overt act occurred,
| On the basis of facts presently available, we are limited to filing the
complaint at Memphis or Birmingham,

We understand that we cannot rely on the U, 8, Attorney at
Memphis, HE we tried to file there, we would immediately lose control
of the situation and the complaint would become public knowledge,

‘We have checked with Birmingham and we have no assurance
we could keep a complaint filed there a secret, We would have to go :
through the U. 8. Attorney's Office and Macon Weaver, the U. 8 Attorney,
is presently in Houston, The U. 8 Commissioner is 2 woman who does
not have too firm a grasp on her operations,

Investigation at the Canadian address given by Galt, / 31/67,
has not been productive and a Kansas City address as of 3/1/67, that we
obtained in Canada is nonexistent, Galt is last known to have been i in
Atlanta, 4/) 5/68, and his present whereabouts are unknown, We are
faced with the danger that he may leave the country before he is located,

should be immediately filed and Galt's fugitive status should be given the

In view of the above circumstances, it now appears charges
| fare possible publicity,

ACTION:

1, We should openly file the proposed complaint at Birmingham,

2. We should issue a wanted flyer and — press release.

3. We should issue an Identification Order even though me no .
fingerprints are available,

4, At the appropriate time, the Attorney General should be

This is s the case involving the setae of Martin Luther

With reference to the dissemination to the Department
of investigative reports in this case, such reports fall into two .

- categories: a) reports containing information of evidentiary value -
pertinent to the prosecution of the Federal violation involved; and -- ~
b) reports containing the results of the extensive fugitive investigation f,
conducted to locate and apprehend the subject, James Earl Ray. 7 Eels

All reports pertinent to the prosecution of the Federal ~
violation involved, and in which the Department has a legitimate _.
interest, have been disseminated promptly to the Department and
there has been absolutely no delay in doing 60,

tes

The remaining reports contain the results of our peeeaae
fugitive investigation to locate and apprehend Ray, Copies of these
reports were not disseminated to the Department since they relate.
solely to the fugitive aspects of the case, and contain no evidentiary
material or information of value to the Department in the discharge
of its prosecutive function relative to the Federal charge involved,

: There are twenty such reports involving approximately
2,000 pages, They contain background data and results of extensive
interviews and/or other investigation conducted to locate Ray, Although
they do not relate to the prosecution aspect of the case, they will none
the less be furnished to the Department in aa SO with My ae

Memo Rosen to DeLoach
RE: MURKIN

dentially came to our attention before Vinson's memorandum was written -
that British prison authorities had asked Vinson for information of this
type in connection with their responsibility to maintain Ray's custody

and the extradition proceedings, )

We had, of course, reviewed such records in the initial
phase of the fugitive aspect of the investigation, and the results had.
been set forth in the fugitive reports dated May 15, 1968, and June 14,
1968, submitted by our Kansas City Office. Copies of these reports,
which contained in full the information requested by Vinson in his
letter, were furnished to him on July 19, 1968, Since the Attorney
General had requested that information relating to the case be furnished
to both Vinson and Assistant Attorney General Stephen J. Pollak of
the Civil Rights Division, copies of the Laeiaarnaaad reports were also

_ furnished to Pollak,

It should be noted Vinson did not furnish Pollak a copy
of his (Vinson's) July 12, 1968, letter to the Bureau and consequently
‘Pollak is apparently completely unaware the pertinent Kansas City
reports were furnished to him and Vinson in answer to Vinson's
specific request, This is another typical example in the Department
of the left hand not knowing what the right hand is doing and explains
why Pollak has gone off half cocked in erroneously accusing us of delay
in disseminating the reports in question,

As a further example of this lack of coordination between
Pollak and Vinson as relates to this case, it is noted that after Ray
was turned over to state authorities in Tennessee we inquired of Vinson
by letter whether the Federal process against Ray should be dismissed
_ since the extradition order did not cite the Federal Civil Rights charges
and it was our understanding that Ray could not, therefore, be prosecuted
on Federal charges, A copy of our letter was furnished to Pollak,

Vinson in reply advised us that he felt the Federal process -
should be dismissed; however, Pollak, apparently unaware of Vinson‘'s
position, subsequently advised us that he felt the process should not
ibe dismissed pending disposition of the state murder charges against
Ray, It was necessary for us by memorandum to point out the
discrepancy in the two views and request clarification in the matter. ©

Memorandum to Mr. DeLoach
RE: MURKIN

New Orleans, Stein told Decarvelho he felt that he was on the
threshold of converting Ray to his ‘cosmic philosophy" and hoped to
complete the conversion on the return trip from New Orleans to

Los Angeles, ;

Lomax and Stein have now returned to Los Angeles, Stein
advised the search for the telephone booth used by Ray had been
nonproductive, He said a couple of telephone booths in Uvalde, Texas,
looked familiar but he could furnish no factual data as to their use by
Ray.

In an article for immediate release by Louis Lomax, now
writing for the North American Newspaper Alliance, Lomax falsely
claimed that there are certain contradictions in the FBI tac tbabecen
Lomax in his article states as follows,

1, Lomax claims: The FBI has been forced to admit that the
fingerprints circulated as those of Ray are in fact of someone else,

Facts: The FBI has issued only one set of fingerprints
and these are the actual fingerprints of Ray. When Ray escaped from
prison in April, 1967, Missouri authorities issued a wanted notice that
bore the wrong fingerprints; however the warden immediately issued a
corrected wanted notice bearing the correct fingerprints, We had nothing
to do with these wanted notices issued by Missouri almost a year before
King was killed,

2. Lomax claims: An FBI search of the 1966 white Mustang

driven by Ray unearthed Green Stamps that were issued as a result of
a purchase at a Birmingham, Alabama, gas station in mid-February, 1968.
FBI reports consistently place Ray in Los Angeles as a student at dancing
and bartending schools at the time of the gas station transaction, 7

7 : Facts: The manager of the service station in Birmingham,
Alabama, stated that the station purchases S & H Green Stamps every two
weeks and upon reviewing the stamps from the 1966 Mustang of Ray the
manager stated that the stamps were purchased on 9/8/67 from the S & H
Company and the number on the top of the stamps would indicate that they
were given to a customer sometime during 9/8-22/67, It is noted that
Birmingham investigation indicates that Ray was in Birmingham, Alabama,
from 8/26/67 to 10/a/6n.

Memorandum to Mr. DeLoach
RE: MURKIN

3. Lomax claims: FBI reports indicated that cigarette
butts and ashes were found on the floor of the white Mustang when it
was recovered in Atlanta, Georgia, although Lomax alleges Ray does
not smoke,

Facts; The Agents in Atlanta, upon examination of the
1966 Mustang, determined there were no apparent cigar or cigarette
ashes on the floor of the white Mustang and the ash tray was clean,

4, Lomax claims: The FBI reports indicate that Ray was
in Los Angeles until 3/27/68; he is reported to have bought the fatal
weapon in Birmingham, Alabama, on 3/30/68, Ray could not have driven
the route in a Mustang in that short period between 3/27/68 and 3/30/68,

Facts; Our investigation discloses that Ray departed
Los Angeles, California, on 3/17/68 giving a forwarding address as
General Delivery, Atlanta, Georgia, ;

5. Lomax claims: The most fatal oversight was the FBI's
failure to uncover the console television set Ray gave to a Hollywood
girl friend in return for her portable television set. The back of this
television set contained handwriting believed to be that of Ray.

Facts: We were perfectly aware that Ray traded his console
television set for a portable model and the television set has been in the
possession of a person whom we have interviewed at length, Our
Los Angeles Office advises that there is no handwriting on the back of
the television set,

6 Lomax claims: A ‘clear reading makes it all but certain
that Ray took three trips to New Orleans between 12/13/67 and the end
of March, ata 7

Facts: Our investigation thus far discloses that t Ray 1 made
‘two trips to New Orleans: once when he left Los Angeles 12/15/ 67, was -
registered at a New Orleans motel, 12/17-19/67, and returned to

Los Angeles 12/21/67; and again when he left Los Angeles, 3/17/68,

and delivered a package in New Orleans to a relative of Charles Stein,
apparently on the Peta! of 3/21/68, _. eee

Memorandum to Mr. DeLoach
RE: MURKIN

7. Lomax claims: The FBI did not retrace Ray's trip to
New Orleans with Stein to find the telephone booth Ray used to call
New Orleans and did not consider the possibility Ray had called
New Orleans from a telephone booth in the St. Francis Hotel in
Los Angeles,

Facts; Lomax and Stein spent several days in an
unproductive search for the Texas telephone booth allegedly used by
Ray. We are checking the records of all calls made from more than
170 telephones along the route driven by Ray and Stein in December, 1967.
We have previously checked out calls made from the telephone booth
in the St. Francis Hotel indicated by Lomax as having been used by
Ray and no pertinent information was developed, We are also checking
calls made from all other pay telephones in the St. Francis,

ACTION:

Extensive investigation is continuing throughout the field
on 2 top priority basis to locate and apprehend Ray as quickly as possible.

Memphis authorities have indicated that they may seek a
murder indictment against Ray from a local grand jury on or about
5/3/68, It is not yet known if the testimony of FBI Agents will be
necessary but we will furnish whatever cooperation local authorities
may require in presenting the matter to a grand jury.

When Ray escaped from prison in April, 1967, Missouri
authorities issued a wanted notice that bore ihe wrong

corrected wanted notice bearing the correct fingerprints,

- RE! MURKIN Set

FACTS: Ray is only known to have made two trips
from Los Angeles to New Orleans, in December, 1967, and
in March, 1968,

7. LOMAX STATES: The FBI confiscated telephone
company records listing calls made from Los Angeles
telephone booths used by Ray and only the FBI knows what
these records show.

FACTS: We have not confiscated any records, We
have obtained information from the telephone company
regarding calls made from all pay telephones in the
St. Francis Hotel, Los Angeles, It would appear that
Lomax has been unsuccessful in his efforts to obtain
similar information from the telephone company.

8 LOMAX STATES: America's blacks never have
trusted either the Director or the FBL

FACTS: We have long enjoyed the confidence of
responsible Negro leaders and the responsible Negro press.
‘This confidence has been gained by the Bureau's continuing
success in handling Civil Rights cases such as the murder
of three civil rights workers in Mississippi, the murder of
Lt, Colonel Lemuel Penn in Georgia, the murder of
Viola Liuzzo in Alabama, investigations concerning
discrimination in voting, education, and many similar
investigative accomplishments,

9. LOMAX STATES: ‘The FBI leaked a story to the
press suggesting a Negro was behind King’s murder,

FACTS: This is absolutely false, °

10, LOMAX STATES: The Director should publicly
admit bis dislike for King and then "share the hunt” with a
less prejudiced agency; the cause of justice would be better
served if the investigation were under actideibaiticctal

“mysterious blond" named Jerri who he alleged had been involved -
with Ray at Los Angeles and later went to ‘Milwaukee where Lomax

While having lunch at Hammelts on 7/25/68, Jim McShane,
Chief, U. S, Marshal's, Office,.Department of Justice, asked if -he
could sit at my table for a few minutes, _I told him to sit down,

McShane told me that he wanted to express the deep resent~
ment that he and all US Marshals felt over the fact that the FBI
had brought James Earl Ray from London to the US. He stated this
was logically a job for the US Marshals and that, while he had 274]
always meticulously adhered to the premise that the Marshals - Lh
should never infringe on FBI jurisdiction, yet the FBI had cer-—
tainly infringed on the Marshals' responsibilities in this
instance, McShane also told me that he had discussed this matter
with Fred Vinson and planned to mention it to the Attorney General.

I told NcShane that it appeared his complaint was being
misplaced, inasmuch as this was something he should discuss with
‘the AG. I told him that, although the AG made the final decision,
I wanted McShane to definitely realize that I personally was glad

. that the FBI had brought the subject back to the US. I stated
this was a highly important case, very technical and complex in
nature, and if this man had started discussing the aspects of the
case with marshals, the marshals would have definitely been
completely lost.

McShane replied that he personally had brought a subject
back from overseas in a previous important case. I told him I
-remembered this, inasmuch as this particular subject had gotten
away from him and had succeeded in slashing his wrists. McShane

laughed and admitted this, 7 7 :

of his complaint. I stated it made little difference to me

whom he complained to; however, once again, if he desired to lodge
a complaint regarding the policy involved in the return of the
subject, he should discuss this with the AG and not the FBI.

He stated he planned to do this, He then left my table.

AMES EARL RAY
INTERESTING IDENTIFICATION

Martin Luther King, Jr., was killed on April 4, 1968, while
standing on a balcony of the Lorraine Hotel in Memphis, Tennessee. The
unknown killer made good his getaway, but in so doing, left behind evidence
that would eventually help lead to his identification, apprehension imprisonment.
Items left behind were a .30-08 Remington rifle with atiached Redfield telescopic

. Sight, binoculars, and a blue zipper bag containing clothing and personal
articles. These items were found in the vicinity of a rooming house across
from the Lorraine Hotel. Investigation determined that subject had rented a
room at the rooming house using the name John Willard, and it was from the
bathroom in this establishment that the fatal shot was fired. The rifle and other
evidence was delivered to the FBI Laboratory and Identification Division by 2
Special Agent of the Memphis Division.

Several latent prints of value were developed on the items
submitted. Two of these latent prints, one on the rifle and one on the
binoculars were found to have been made by the same finger and the position
of these prints, as well as the shape and slope of the ridges, indicated the
prints were probably from the left thumb.

Thorough investigation developed considerable information.
relative to the murderer. The rifle had been purchased in Birmingham by
an individual using the name Harvey Lowmeyer; the white Musiang believed
to be the getay car was registered to an Eric Starvo Galt who had spent
the night preceeding the murder at the Rebel Motel in Memphis. Galt was
further traced to a rooming house in Atlanta where additional evidence was
recovered including a map of Mexico. A latent fingerprint developed thereon
was identified with the latent prints on the rifle and binoculars. This ide
fication enebled the FBI print experts to say that this print, in addition
thumb, was an ulnar loop of 12 ridza counts

oculars, t

SAS



NW 68486 Docld:32989755 Page 337

Based on the premise that the latent fingerprint recovered
from the rifle, binoculars and man of Mexico was probably from the le.
thumb and was an ulnar loop of 12. ridge counts, a review of the fingerprint
records of the 53, G00 fugitives on file’ was undartaken and it was found that
approximately 1900 of these fugitives had ulner loops of 10 - 14 ridge counts
in the left thumb. Comparisons were started and on April 19, 1968, 15 days
after the crime, the latent fingerprints were identified with the fingerprints
of James Harl Ray, an escapee from the Missouri State Penitentiary where he
had been serving time for robbery.

The fingerprint identifications with James Earl Ray triggered an
intensive man hunt involving law enforcement officers and investigative
personnel, not only in the United States, but also Mexico, Canada, England,
and other countries.

The possibility that Ray himself might have been killed was
not overlooked and all unkmown deceased fingerprint cards received by the
FBI were referred to the Latent Fingerprint Section for comparison. One
case of this type concerned a body found buried on the beach at Acapulca,
Mexico. Fingerprints taken by local authorities from this body were examined
in the Latent Fingerprint Section but, because of the condition of the body,
were of no value, An examiner from the FBI's Latent Fingerprint Section
flew to Mexico and on examining the flesh of the fingers was able to determine
that the body was not that of James Earl Ray.

Another phase of the investigation led to Canada, and there,
following an exhaustive search of passport applications, it was determined
had obtained a passport under the name of Ramon George Sneyd and
had teken an airplane flight to London. :

Copies of the FBI Identification Order prepared following Ray's

a atent prints were immediately furnished to Scotland Yard and
on June 8, 1969, while attempting to board a flight for Brussels, Belgium,
Ray was arres ted at London Airport.

before the murder, ‘It “has now been determined that the photographs taken
by Way are ‘actually photographs of John Patrick O'Rourke, formerly
a Sergeant on the West Orange, New Jersey, Police Department for
sixteen years, “O'Rourke does not appear to have any connection with 4

engaged in conversation with another patron and mentioned his military
specialty. Tivo days later he met the same man again in the bar and .
this man said that since Smith had been in the Air Force he should have
contacts for obtaining munitions and explosives. He then requested
Smith to get 50 hand grenades and laid $5, 000 in cash on the table saying,
"This is yours if you “get me the grenades," The man then told Smith
that he and four others in Memphis had vowed that one of them would
kill Martin Luther King, Jr., in one way or another and this was why they
‘wanted the hand grenades. Smith asked the man if he was a memher
of the Ku Klux Klan and he replied that he was not. Smith declined to
provide hand grenades and was told, "If you can't get them for me, you
had better forget it," Smith has had no further contact with this man
and does not know his identity. He described him as forty-five years of
age, 5° 7" tall, 220 ney gray hair, and driving a new Corvette

; automobile.

After being interviewed Smith alleged that he had been fired
from his job because he had furnished information, C, E. Weaver,
general manager of the Western Auto store was contacted and said he
had not fired Smith but had told him to go home because he was drinking
on the job, He also said that Smith had failed to appear at a scheduled
meeting of employees at 6:30 a,m,, 4/11/68 and he had determined that
Smith had been drunk the evening pefore and had overslept. Weaver
considers Smith to be deceitful, “unreliable, probably a heavy Grinker
and Weaver has been considering firing Smith,

Records of the penitentiary at Leavenworth show that Ray
was approved for the honor farm in 1957 but was never so assigned
as he Gid not feel he could live in the honor farm dormitory because
it was integrated, :

John Larry Ray, subject's brother, has been located in

St. Louis where he operates a bar, John claims he has seen the subject

only twice in twenty years, the last occasion being three years ago

at Missouri State Penitentiary, John Ray expressed wonder that Ray

is being hunted by the FBI since all he has done is "Icill a nigger" and

there would be no interest in Ray if King had been white, John-Ray
{said the subject would have no reason to contact him and would not be

able to locate him anyway.

RE: MURKIN

Radio station KNEW, San Francisco, has a recording of a
"talk show" that occurred between 9pm. andidp.m., 4/13/68, An

. unidentified caller alleged Adam Clayton Powell offered $20,000 to kill

King and stated, "Iam a Negro myself and I belong to a militant group.
Well, if you turn around and check to find out why he offered $20, 000

on Reverend King’s death to four men in a UCLA building. Iwas there,
one of twenty-six men at that party, They had a big fight between the

two of them, It was never put inthe paper, You have the FBI investigate
and find out why the man was offered $20, 000 and a hideout in Bimini.
That is why I left Los Angeles, to come up here, because I have heard
your program and explain everything to you so you can turn it over to the
FBI and let them figure it out.”

: The caller also said the meeting had been in a white house and
when the anriouncer asked for his name so he could be contacted by the
FBI, the caller stated, "Well, I don't want them to contact me because -..
my life ain't worth two cents, on account of the man that hit (censored,
censored) it might trip away fromhim. That is all lam going to say,
Thank you." Los Angeles is contacting racial sources for any information
as to such a meeting and the statements actually made by Powell,

i told the Attorney General that the man who were in London were
back here, 28 one man's father had a serious heart attack. I said one ls
Special Agent Zeiss, whom he may remember, and the Attorney General said
he did, that he was a cloge friend of his father’s and his son knows him, too.
EZ said he will be on the plane and so would gohn T. Minnich, The Attorney
General commented this would be ideal, :

The Atlorney General agked how we thought Ray got the three names
heused, Psaid this again shows his astuteness es all three are living people
gesiling in Conada who never Enew him and never heard of him. 7 eaid oa
the other hand, Ray apent lest yeax,whea he was wandering around the country,
& grest portion of the time in Cenacia and I thonght he was planning this thing
and seeking a double identity lise Sneyd, Galt, and Bridgeman and checkiag
out those mames go Ui there were any check made on his application for a birth
certificate, they .culd ascertain such a person existed. I said this shows his
shrowéness, Tsaid I think we are dealing with a man who is net an ordinary
criminal in the usual sense, but a man capable of duing any hind of a sly act.
The Attorney General said be was exceptionally clever.

i said Sirhan Sirban is a different Individual as he Is a fanatic and
killed Robert Kennedy because he epoke in favor of Israel and this fellow
belng an Arab became intensely bitter against Kennedy aad felt he should be
killed, which he did, ont he is a fanatic and Ray is not a fanatic in that sense.
Usaid 1 think Ray is a racist and detested Nexross and Martin Luther King
and there is indication that prior to the Memphis situatlon, be had information
about King speaking in other towns and thea picked out Memphis, I said
think he acted entirely alone, but we are not closing our minds that others
might be associated with him snd we have to run down every lead.

i sald we are getting more crank letters and letiers about other
Becple who are golnyg to be killed who are in high office, such as Senator
Edward Koanedy, et cetera, I said one does not realiuc how many nuts
are locee in this country until we have a case like this. The Attorney General
said 2 brings them ovl. I said we bage to be carefal ci all of them; that we
fake abvut three away a week who come to my office who complain about
persecition and sometimes they are armed and we send them to the hespital

is a problem for the psychiatrists but they are apparently doing little to cure
them, but they are mentally unbalanced,. The Attorney General said it is a
public safety problem now. Yeaid Ido not aver the view that the countey

ig Gepraved and all that, I said I think we have a great bleck of line people
in this country; that there may be some depraved cHizens, but it isnot a
deprayed society. The Attorney General said he thought there was toocmuch
srapbasis today in the press that society ia pick; that lt is the fashionable
thing to do.

i said I hoped the new Commission the President has appointed
will keep a balanced viewpoint as to that because the other Commission
went fax astray in regerd to white racism. I sald there is raciam but not as
predominantly as the Kerner Commission found it tobe. The Attorney
General said he had mever found it go. I said as an example take the meeting
yesterday (Solidarity Day); that mors than 50% of those who attended were white
and 4 was not predominantly Negro, Tae Attorney General said that was
sarprising to him and he felt better to eee it that way. I said this shows
that white racism is not as predominant as we have been led to believe,
i said i hope the Eisenbower Commission when they get around to thelr
findings view i with an unemctional attitude. The Attorney General sald
there are some good people on he Cosamission, 7 said it geeras Ht should
be done without emoticnaliem or esying fire, 2 said ¥ get annoyed with the
editorials about cur sick society as 1 do not believe there is such a tolag
in this country although there are geome sick citizens, The Attorney General
sald that if I could muke this point in the Law Enforcement Bulletin on the
Director’s pega, he thought lt would be helpful. Z said Thave been working
oa that just recently; that the idea was given to me by McGill of the Atlanta
Constitutlon, Tsaid ke hed a Une editorial about the attacks on the FBI
becauss we had not found the King murderer after two months and the cracks
thal we were not trying to find him and thea hse quoted several verses of the
Blole which portrayed Christ aa not interested In the poor, but it showed,
again that thera is always an effort to tear down and destroy. Leommented
that I thought there was a tendency to debunk our Patriots in history. Isoaid
it waa that sort of thing that i thought drove President Johnson irom ranning
for a second term and the Attorney General agreed,

aauae This is the case involving the murder of Martin Luther King.

Reference is made to previous memoranda concerning
Jensen's plan to interview subject Ray in the above-entitled matter
at the Tennessee State Penitentiary, Nashville, Tennessee.

I had previously advised that Jensen had entered the maximum
security building of the institution at 3:44 p.m. This information was
furnished to the Director's Office immediately thereafter.

It is also pointed out that the steps outlined and the Director's
comments concerning the need to make no public statement as the press
and TV would descend on the penitentiary en masse were brought to the
attention of Assistant Attorney General Leonard of the Civil Rights Division
after Jensen had started his interview with Ray today. Mr. Leonard ~~
indicated he fully agreed that any publicity at this time would be most
undesirable.

Mr. Leonard asked to be informed of davaisiients which lL;
might have a bearing on this matter as it will be necessary to decide,
in the event Ray is not cooperative and there is no possibility of further i:
~ }getting any cooperation from him, as to whether he should be brought
before a Federal Grand Jury and be questioned under oath chaieriane
the existence of coconspirators.

interviewed by SAs GEORGE E, AIKEN, Jr. and E, RHEAD

1968, at which time she advised as follows:

She stated that she was employed on a part-time
basis as an evening dance instructor at the National
Dance Studio located at 2026 Pacific Avenue, Long Beach,
California.

She stated that she recalled one ERIC S. GALT -
as-a former student whom she instructed. She stated that
as she recalled, GALT was her dancing pupil from about
the first week in December 1967 through ie adbitomnanbined the
middle of February 1968.

In recalling GALT, she offered the following
information concerning him:

She said that GALT was a very neat person and
that he dressed immaculately, often in expensive clothes.
He ays appeared at the dance studio cleanly shaven,
_ wearing white shirt and tie, and either a sport coat

and slacks or a suit. She stated he also owned an
expensive looking pair of alligator loafers, which he often
yore with a sport suit. She stated that his hands were very
well kept, and his nails may have been professionally
manicured, but she could not state this with absolute:
certainty. She stated, however, that she had never seen
his hands soiled or his fingernails dirty. His fingernails
were well filed and trimmed and were worn short and neat.
She stated that he was left handed inasmuch as she had |
noticed him on two occasions writing, and at the time she
observed him writing, she made a mental note that he was a

GALT was very i11 at ease in crowds and gave
her the impression that he prefers to be either alone or
with no more than one other individual.. He was an
introvert and was very hard to converse with. She stated
that in the approximate two months that she knew him,
only towards the last did he feel confident enough with
her that he would joke with her. She stated that toward
the end he showed somewhat of a humor, which she believed
very few people knew he had. He was always ill at ease
around others and could not relax while in conversation.
with any other individual. He always fidgeted, pulled at
his ears, played with his hands, and looked in every
direction but at the peyson with whom he was conversing.
She stated that he smiled with a one-sided smile and that
he smiled very infrequently.

He would never talk about himself, but in general
conversations she was led to believe that he came to Los
Angeles from Mexico, possibly around Mexico City. He told
her that he was unemployed; was a former merchant seaman3
that he wished to return to sea, and that he received
sufficient proceeds from the sale of a bar that he could
"set along without being gainfully employed."

RHOADS stated that shé was of the opinion that
GALT entertained the thought of asking her for a date on
many occasions, but his backwardness prevented him from
actually doing so. During the dancing lessons he always
centered his conversations around dancing techniques and
never talked in general terms about himself. She believes
he was a Southerner, and she recalled that possibly the
first or second week during January 1968, he did not attend
dancing instruction, and upon his return, stated that he had
visited a brother in the State of Louisiana. RHOADS stated
that during the two month period that she knew GALT, he
changed residences twice in Hollywood, California. She
at no time associated with GALT socially. She was not
acquainted with any of his associates, and through
conversations, GALT told her that he had no particular
"hobby."

TA 4h-1574

She stated that GALT seemed to compensate for
his social inaptness by his attire and placing his
schedule on precise projects which he was participating in.

As an example, she stated that GALT took dancing
lessons she believed to overcome some of his shyness. He
pursued the dancing lessons quite vigorously, doubling up
on the number of lessons normally taught per week so as to
take the maximum number of lessons in the shortest possible
time. He abruptly quit dancing, telling her that he had
enrolled in bartending school and was having a conflict in
his schedule. :

RHOADS was of the opinion that he had toyed with
his dancing lessons sufficiently to satisfy himself and
was "running off on another tangent." She also stated
that GALT was not sufficiently busy she believed to have not
pursued both courses, because GALT told her that he slept
rather late, had lunch, took a nap in the early afternoon,

“yent to bartending school in the late afternoon, and would -
then attend dancing lessons in the early evening. This, |
he explained to her, was his typical day, which was-not a
busy, productive, or strenuous one in her mind.

She stated that GALT was very slow in his mental
processes. He often did not understand jokes- and did not
react favorably to a friendly gesture extended to him.

RHOADS stated that during one conversation with GALT she-

made mention that it was odd that he did not wear any
jewelry, that is ring or watch, since he was so well dressed
otherwise. GALT replied that he detested jewelry of any sort,
and to her knowledge, she never saw him wear a watch, ring,
or cuff links, or any other items of jewelry.

RHOADS could remember nothing else of the
mannerisms, background, etc. of GALT. She stated that GALT
was @ white male, weighing about 165 pounds. She stated
that he had brown hair; was in his middle 30s; had a medium
complexion, and spoke with a Southern accent. She stated
that from his diction she believed him to be high school
educated. To her knowledge, he spoke no foreign language.

His hair was short but not a flattop or Butch haircut.

She stated that she could not recall whether or not he

had a part in his hair but for some reason doubted that
his hair was parted. His eyes were described as pretty
and blue in color.

She stated that should she remember any further

information pertaining to GALT, she would immediately
contact the Los Angeles Division of the FBI.

"On Friday, March 29, 1968, sometime
in the early afternoon I had just returned from
‘ lunch when I observed Mr. U, L, BAKER, alse a

. Salesman, completing the sale of a rifle to an :
individual unknown to me,” Mr. BAKER had just .
sold this man a Remington, Model 700, Caliber :
243 Winchester with a 2x-7x Redfield Scope
mounted thereon, Mr, BAKER had made this sale
and had also mounted and bore sighted the scope
on our machine, This individual also bought one
box of 20 rounds of ,243 Norma ammunition, He
payed cash for this sale, When I first observed
this man he was dressed in a dark business suit
with a white shirt and tie, as well as I remember,
Re was approximately 5'8" tall, 150 to 160 pounds
and had dark hair, He had a medium complexicn and
appeared to be a meek individual, This individual
had given his name as HARVEY LOWMEYER and stated
that he resided at 1907 South llth Street,

- Birmingham, Alabama, He also advised that he was
36 years of age.

“ "This information was not given to me
personally by this individual, but I determined it
from the bill of sale that was prepared by
Mr, BAKER.

“Following the sale this individual left
the store carrying the gun in a cardboard box
utilized by the Browning Manufacturing Company.
This box was used because with the scope mounted
the rifle would not fit in the normal Remington bex,

aie He also took the empty Remington manufacturer's
carton with him when he left,

"It was, as best I recall, either later
that afternoon or early the following Saturday
morning when this individual called on the telse-~
phone and stated that he had had a conversation
with his brother and decided that the gun he had
purchased was not the gun he wanted and he requested
whether he could exchange it for a Remington, Hode2
760, 30,06 caliber, I advised bim that we cowld
make this exchange but that it would cest hin az
additional $5,900,

“At approximately 9:00 AH on Saturday,
March 30, this Same individual returned te the
store with the gun he had previously purchased,
When he returned the gun he had the gun still in
the Browning box, I told him that I would change
the scope from the caliber .243 rifle to the
Model 760, but that it would take me until approxie
mately 3:00 o'clock in the afternoon and I
instructed him to return at 3:00 o'clock and to bring
the original Remington box for the caliber ,243
weapon with him when he came as I would need & box to .
Store the gun in, I-gave him the Hodél 760 gun and
I believe that I left it in the Browning carton, £
did not receive the $5.00 because in exchanging the
scope I had to use a Weaver base and rings instead
of the RedZield base and rings and this made up the
cost difference. I alse exchanged tm box of .243
caliber ammunition fon a box of 30,06 ammunition
which I believe was Peters Core Lokt, 150 grain,
20 rounds per box, He leit _ store carrying the gu
in the cardboard box.

"During the course of our dealings on
Saturday I asked this individual why he didn't want
the caliber .243 gun and I told him that it was 2
big enough gun to bring down any deer in Alabama. He
Stated in an offhand manner, that he wanted the 30,06

. ailber gun because he was going to use it to hunt in

Wisconsin,

Ph.D., Clinical Psychologist, was
Tce, 227 South Bedford Drive, Beverly
Hills, California, Avril 19, 1968, at which ¢ ime he furnished
the following information:

On November 27, 1967, he received a telephone call from a
JAMES E, RAY, who said he wanted to overcome his shyness, gain
social confidence, and learn self-hyonosis in order that he could
relax, sleep and learn to remember things better. As there was
an open appointment that afterncon, an avvointment was made for
RAY to come to the doctor's office, 9952 | Santa Monica Boulevard,
Beverly Hills, at 5:00 pom

RAY did report for the scheduled appointment on November 27th,

at 5:00 p.m. Dr. FREEMAN exhibited a leaf from his consultation
notebook (avproximately 3"x5" in size), on which he said he had
made some notes regarding RAY on the cccasion of their first
appointments This notebook page contained the name JAMES BE. RAY;

ddress, 1535 North Serrano; telephone 169-8096; . and notations
indicating the patierit was single; had said he was fron Bast’ St. Touiss
and had worked on boats on the Hississippi River. Born March 10, 1928.

In this first appointment and in subsequent appointments»
RAY had very little to contribute about his personal family back~
ground. He said that he was unemployed. That he had worked as
a cook on a Mississippi river steamer, but did not like the work,
so had quit. c ‘i

The doctor said he got the impression that RAY was an early
riser, ag he wanted early appointments, where ever possible. He
also usually arrived at the office early, considerably ahead of :
his scheduled avvointment time, He was not "shaky," when he arrived
for the early morning appointments. No indications that he was
suffering from“nang-overs," on those occasionse

RAY had no physical distresses. Wo headaches. Was in excellent

Although he gave his birthdate as March 10, 1928, on the occasion
of their first appointment , RAY impressed ‘the dectcr as being "young
and immature."

In consultations subsequent to their first meeting, the doctor
stated he felt that he and RAY developed a good rapport. RAY repeated
his request that he wanted to cvercome his shyness, and gain social
confidence so that he would be able to talk to people. He was usually
placid, cooperative, easily led in conversations, end did not fight
against the doctor as some of his clients do, During either the second

‘or third visit, the doctor asked RAY if he had any "deep dark secrets
. that he wanted to get off his chest." The doctor said he usually asks

this question to determine if his clients have any criminal background
or any sexual problems or aberations. He said that RAY answered in
the negative, and gave him no reason to doubt his answer.

RAY indicated he had read a lot of books on hyonosis, According
to Dr. FREEMAN, "RAY hadthe old vower idea of hynotism. That is that

_ You can go around looking people in the eye and can hyonotise them and

make them do what you want then to." In subsequent appointments, Dr.
FREIAN placed RAY in a hypnotic state. He said he would have RAY lie
down on. a couch in his office, and stare at a little sviral on the
ceiling, Then the doctcr would talk: to him. He was a very apt subject -
for hyonosis. Very eager, and very cooperative. He vas an excellent
hypnotic subject. He was likeable, and polite. He was making progress

in cvercoming his shyness. At the conclusion of each session, he thanked
the doctor for his assistance; and indicated that ‘he was satisfied with
the progress he was makinge He was learning to calm his body down, and
overcome nervousness, and shyness. He usually did what the doctor wanted.

The doctor had no recollection ofmny particular habits or hobbies
that RAY might have had. He did not recall any scars or peculiar
physical characteristics that made any special. impression on him with
regard to RAY. He had no recollection of any discussions regarding
sports, although their visits were during the height of the football :
season and the start of the basketball season. He was neat, and to Gece
the best of the doctor's recollection, usually wore a suit coat, without
atie. Two photographs of ERIC GALT (with eyes open and eyes closed)
were exhibited to the doctor, who said they were excellent likenesses
of his patient, JAMES E. RAY. é

The doctor pointed out in his professional appointment book, entries
for JAKES BE, RAY covering six appointments and a seventh entry which was

crossed through. These avpointment dates end & imes, as noted in the
professicnal appointment book, were:

December 18, 1967 3:00 peme

This latter appointment (12/18/67) was the one with the Line
through it. The doctor recalled that RAY had televhone him at the -
office, after making the appoiniment for December 18th, and told him
that he would be unable to come to the office for the appointment as
he had received information from his brother, that the latter had
"found a job for him in the Merchant Marine in New Orleans, Louisiana."
The doctor is not sure of the date cr time that RAY telephone to
cancel this last. appointment; but feels sure that it was sometime .
after their 10:00 Bome appointment on December 1h; 1968,

Dr. FREEMAN saidthet RAY paid in cash, $25.00 per visit. Except
he has the recollection that RAY sent him 2 money order (he believes it’
was a postal money order) for the final 825.00 payment.

Concerning his own personal history background and professional
training, Dr. FREEMAN advised he pad his college training at the
University of Illinois (where he’had a minor in Zoology), the University
of Zurich, end graduate study at the University of Southern California.
He said he was an agent in the Army's counter-intelligence corps in
Europe during World War II. He is married, and has two children (a son
and daughter) living with him. In addition to his travels and studies
in Burone; he has travelled in Javan. His office is located at 9952 .
Santa Monica Boulevard, Beverly Hills, California, and his office :
telephone nujiber is CRestview 6-212, The doctor said’ that many of his.
patients come to him a referral from Mr. MELVIN POWERS of the Wilshire
Book Company on the Sunset Strip in Hollywood, California; which he.
discribed as a publishing house that publishes numerous titles in the
field of self-nypnosis. It was his recollection that RAY had indicated
he had read some of these books oe that he had been referred to the
doctor from that source. . :

The doctor’ concluded by stating that JAMES EB. RAY came to him
seeking psychological help in the nature of self-hyonosis to gain
confidence, overcome shyness, learn to sleep better, and to be able
to talk to people. Following each session, he was instructed to go
home and practice the methods of relaxation they had gone over in
the office. He was shy, introverted, and withdrawn, but not psychotic
or plegued with any deep seated neuroses, Altho hs indicated he
was unemployed, he never seemed to lack money to pay in cash for his
consultations during the period of their avpointments. When he
called to cancel their last apvointment, he indicated he was going
to New Orleans to accept a position his brother had obtained for him;
but he told the doctor he hoped they would meet again sometime.

on occasion, exact number of occasions.not recalled. He does recxll
that on at least one occasion on attempting to visit his brother,

JOHN LARRY RAY was interviewed in the iMenzeents of
the Grapevine Tavern in a Bureau automobile,

JOHN RAY stated that, if his brother had been in ~
St. Louis or had visited St, Louis following his escape
from the Missouri State Penitentiary, he would definitely
have contacted him (JOBN RAY), particularly if he needed
help. in the way of money or place to stay. He emphatically
denied that this took place, He stated he would still help
his brother if his brother.asked him to or contacted him in
any way, however, he feels he would tell the interviewing
Agent about it after it happened,

With regard to JOHN GAWRON, he stated that his
brother is acquainted with JOEN GAWRON, however, is positive
that he would never contact him iv in St. Louis and a fugitive
because he does not trust him. JOHN RAY described CAWRON as
an old crazy man, whe talks about "jobs" and "cases jobs" but -
never pulls any. He talks all the time about the past and
jobs he pulled in the past, however, tells various versions
of the jobs at various times, therefore, believed to be by
JOHN RAY a complete liar and "idiot,"

He stated that if his brother was dealing in
amphetamines in prison thathe would probably have had plenty ~
of money on him at time of escape, because dealers of
amphetamines in prisen are usually the top money holders,

JOBN RAY stated that he is of the opinion that his
brother immediately left the country after his escape and —
basis this opinion on the fact that during his visits with JIM,
JIM indicated thathe intended to leave the country whea he got
out, inasmuch as he was, sick of the law enforcement harassment
in this country.

With regard to JAMES L, OWENS, fall partner’ of JIM
in 1959 hold-up of the Kroger Store, he stated that he does not
believe that his brother would be in comtact with OWENS because

for the arrest and conviction of Ji, however, did not gain this
“impression from conversations with JIM, merely surmised it
because OWENS pleaded guilty and got a lighter sentence than
JIM.

On viewing the Identification Order photographs,
JOHN RAY stated that the photograph with the crew cut looks
. More iike his brother, JIM, to him, however, he noted this
is possibly because he does not recall ever seeing JEM with
long hair, noting that he always wore a crew cut.

When questioned vegarding his smiling reaction to
each questicn, he stated that .his facial reaction is a nervous
reaction, which in the past on questicning by the police has
caused him trouble. He stated that it is mezely a nervous
Feaction and he is not eluding to any knowledge that he
might be withholding.

"3, DL.” This individual later owned the Half-Way House
_Restaurant on Jefferson Avenue. He stated that he does not
believe that “J, D.” Knows him by name. He stated the reason
he recalls "J, D." was that on one occasion, while in the :
bar at Twelfth and Morrison, “J. D.” “sicked" seven men on
him and later he caught "J, DB,” alome and beat him up because
of this. He stated insofar as he knows his brother, JIM, is

send money to his brother under his name and no one has ever
approached him in that regard.

not believe that DAILEY knows him. RAY was unable to provide
any information whether his brother, JAMES EARL RAY, and DAILEY
have ever known each other,

RAY was questioned regarding his stay at the Mac
Arthur Hotel in St. Louis at which time he readily stated
-that approximately two or three months ago he spent a night -

vine Inn, NAOMI REGAZZI (phonetic). According to RAY he regis-
tered as Mr. and Mrs. JOHN RAY and provided a fictitious address.

time he stated it is entirely possible that he used that address
when registering, however, it does not have any Pen
Significance to him. 7

-JERRY RAYNES, had sold a house on Park Avenue in St. Louis and

vine Tavern it is necessary to have an abundance of cash for
various bills and he also pays the employees at the tavern
in cash.

business opened and while on the return trip to St. Louis
he decided to travel to Tijuana, Mexico. He related that
he had heard of the numerous dishonest people and thieves
in Mexico so while traveling through an unnamed town in Wyoming
he purchased $750 worth of travelers' checks. RAY stated
that he then drove to Tijuana and after his arrival there
stated it was extremely difficult for him to understand the
language, that he did not like the place, and within two
hours after his arrival departed en route to St. Louis, Mis-
souri.

two weeks and he emphatically denied any. knowledge of or contact
with his brother, JAMES EARL RAY, during the trip.or at any
time following JAMES' escape from the Missouri State Peniten-
tiary. He stated he never knew that JAMES RAY was in California,
until the current publicity regarding him.

business hours of both banks were suitable to his own hours,

with the remaining cash he had on hand and the travelers'
checks which he purchased in Wyoming. ioueneieuei
RAY was questioned regarding the financial status
of his brother, JAMES RAY, while he was in. the Missouri State
Penitentiary and RAY stated that he had no idea as. to. how
much money JAMES had, however, he reiterated the previous
recollection of statements made by JAMES during visits to
‘the Missouri State Penitentiary. that if he got out of: the
penitentiary he would leave the country. - JOHN RAY stated
that he assumed that his brother would have had sufficient
money to do just that. He denied any knowledge of sources
of income for his brother but he again assumed that.if his ..
brother was involved in the sale of amphetamine or in the.
Joan business while in the penitentiary he would then presumably
have made some money. RAY denied any knowledge or informa-
tion that anyone outside the penitentiary owed money to his
brother or was hdding money for him.

SOHEN LARRY RAY was interviewed in the vicinity of
Wisconsin and Illinois Avenue, after a prior telephone con-
tact with him at the Grapevine Tavern.

RAY advised that the basis for the front page
article in the St. Louis "Globe~Democrat” this date was an
interview with him by a newspaper reporter from the "Globe-
Democrat, He stated that he has been regularly refusing to
talk to reporters, however, ‘this particular reporter showed -
him a story allegedly to be put on AP by the Los Angeles
"Times" reporter, whom he had refused to talk to, According
to RAY, this article indicated thathe hated his brother, had
no close family ties, and was hiding out, all of which he
indicated was untruthful, After reading this article, the
reporter indicated to him that, if he agreed to an interview,
the reporter would put it in a more favorable light and the
resuit would be a refuting of these lies.

He advised this newspaper reporter that his sister,
CAROL, whese last name he did not furnish the newspaper, _
owned the tavern known as the Grapevine, which he was operating.
Ke also indicated to the reporter that he did not hate his
brother, 2s alleged in the supposed AP story and to impress reporter
with the closeness of his family, he told him he could go to
his father in Hannibal, Missouri, who is alive, or to his
sister and borrow $500.00 any time he wanted to, He stated
that the purpose of this statement was to impress reporter
with the closeness of his family and it had no other meaning.

With regard to the statement in the newspaper article
about him running a trucking business, he pointed out this is
not true, However, he noted that he had talked to CLARENCE
HAYNES, who resides at 1822 North Twenty-first Street, about
going into the trucking business together. He noted that.
HAYNES has one truck and they tentatively agreed that RAY would
more or less obtain customers for this trucking business. He
noted that HAYNES was supposed to have cards printed up
reflecting both their names, however, to date he has not seen
these cards, however, they may have been printed and the
reporter may have gotten this information either from HAYNES
or from the printing company. He pointed out that he is
definitely not in the trucking business, yet, however, may enter

this with HAYNES,

yisit Detroit, Michigan, and New, York, New York. .He drove from
Chicage to Detroit and, while in Detroit, drove across the
bridge to Canada, En route across the bridge, he was stopped

-by What he believed to be a United States Immigration Officer

twenty-four hours, Thereafter, he proceeded to Windsor,
Ontaric, and remained that night, during which time he mailed
this postcard to his sister, SUSAN, He returned the next
morning to Detroit Then, instead of going to New York City,
he retur med to the “chicago areao

With regard to the money that he deposited in his
bank accounts last August, he related the following that
immediately preceded those deposits:

He stated that his father, JERRY, sold the place at
1819 Park Avenue and received some $2,000.00 or more in cash from
this sale, Thereafter, JERRY gave this money to CAROL to
@eposit in her bank account, however, a portion, believed to
be $1,006.00, was to be held by JOHN. He noted this was no
specific agreement, merely that they were together and he
intended to go to California and try to locate a small business
. purchase. He noted that JERRY could have the impression that
CAROL got all the money to hold, however, recalls that JERRY
was present when he got the $1,000.00.

After the above, he proceeded to take a leisurely
trip en route to San Francisco and, while in some town in |
Yyoming he decided that he would change a portion of this
cash into Travelers Checks, which he did, He then proceeded
to San Francisco, where he stayed approximately two weeks,
While in San Francisco, he discovered that in order to get a
liquor license you had to buy an existing license and these
business licenses were from $6,000.00 to $30,000.00 each, which
he could net afford. e

Thereafter, ke drove south to San Diego and remained
approximately one week. On departure from San Diego, he visited
Tijuana, Mexico, for approximately two hours and thereafter.
drove back to St. Louis.

He specifically stated that he does not know anyone
in the area ‘traveled above and he does not know whether or not his
brother knows’ anyone in those areas. He again specifically-
denied that he made any direct or indirect contact with his
brother or anybody acquainted with his brother during the
above-mentioned trip. He denied remaining in Los Angeles,
stating that he drove straight through Los Angeles, not
remaining for any period of time. He denied contacting anyone
in Los Angeles. :

He stated he cannot furnish the specific dates
that he was in San Francisco, San Diego or Tijuana, however,
would place it as the month or five weeks that immediately
preceded the date he opened two bank accounts with the
$1,300.00 and $1,350.00 deposits, He stated he opened these
accounts either the cae or the day after he returned to St.
Louis.

He noted that both he, his brother JERRY and his
father have at various times given CAROL money to deposit in
her account to hold for them. He stated that whenever he
needed money he would go to CAROL and get. it and has no
| idea who owes who what or whether the money is a loan or the

return of money previously given to CAROL. He stated he
‘assumes CAROL keeps some kind of accounting of this, however,
_ Cannot be positive of this because it is never mentioned.

It is noted that JOHN LARRY RAY, in order to avoid
newspaper reporters, had left his personal car parked adjacent
to the Grapevine Tavern and proceeded to the place of the
above interview in a black 1965 or 1966 Mustang, bearing
Missouri License CB1-627.

Mrs, LINDA ALLEN also telephonically advised that
she had attended school with Mrs. GJERDIS RAY, who is present=
ly residing at 314 Wisconsin Avenue, Lake Forest, Illinois.

Mrs, ALLEN related that Mrs. RAY had told her that
sometime in April, 1967, a brother had stayed with JERRY RAY
when she and JERRY were residing at 2897 Techny Road, :
‘Northbrook, Illinois (from March to September, 1967). The ~
brother stayed there for approximately one week and that
although she, LINDA, rented a house in Northbrook, Illinois,
next to RAY, she never physically observed the brother,

She did remember that GJERDIS had told her that JERRY and
the brother would go to Chicago on numerous occasions but
would not take her with them, Mrs, ALLEN advised that one
neighbor who was residing there at the time still lives
there in the house to the west of where the RAYs used to
live. She did not know whether or not the landlord was _.
Still in the area but that information could be obtained
from the ex-landlord.,

block away. She had a red car of her own, and had worked
a short while last fall at Scottie's Restaurant, Lake 7
Forest, Her father, a retired Navy man, supposedly worked
at Great Lakes. WILSON said he never noted any menfolk
visiting GJERDIS, At the time she left, she had just had...
a phone,. number 234-9047, installed the week before.

personnel records and of registered station wagons at Great
Lakes Naval Training Center failed to identify parents of
GJERDIS RAY, nee OLSEN, NICOL LAMBERT, Owner, Scottie's
Restuarant, Lake Forest, was located May 7, 1968. He said
GJERDIS RAY had been employed only a few days as a waitress
in late 1967, at which time she was rooming at 314 Wisconsin,
phone 234-9894; however, other waitresses had since reported
seeing her around town occasionally, most recently keeping.
company with a dark-skinned Negro whom she identified as her
boyfriend, name not given. LAMBERT located 1967 bot eonrannaiid
certificate for GJERDIS RAY, Social Security Number .
348~40-1527, on which was listed address of 1344 Hazel
Avenue, Deerfield, Illinois, telephone 945-0356.

AT DEERFIELD, ILLINOIS.

Located at 1344 Hazel, as he came home for lunch
from bis two-day-a-week “manpower'tjob as maintenance manager
at Recreation Department, United States. Naval Hospital,
Great Lakes, PAUL ALFRED OLSEN, Age 69, advised as follows:

GJERDIS RAY is the daughter of his brother who
was killed in Whitehall, Montana, in 1949, He and his wife -.
adopted GJERDIS at age in months, They also adopted GJERDIS' —
brother, NORMAN DALE OLSEN, now age 22, and living in
Houston, Texas, and working as an auto painter. Both of the
ehildren were slow to learn, left school early, and have been
constant sources of trouble for their stepparents.

7 GJERDIS ‘got married three years or so ago to
VID STREET, had a baby by him, then got a divorce for-
support. Then she married JERRY RAY whom she met at
Sportsmans golf course two years ago. Last year she put. her., .
© baby up for adoption through a Methodist home in Lake Forest.

* She and JERRY separated six months ago, and she later got
a divorce, She has since lived by herself and not at her
“parental” home because Mr. and Mrs. OLSEN are “fed up”

and did not approve of her chasing around, staying out late,
etc. - :

Mr, md Mrs, OLSEN had become attached to the ae wee ad
and visited GJERDIS and the baby a few times at Northbrook,
at the place on Techny Road. OLSEN saw JERRY RAY a few ..
of those times but did not like him because once OLSEN -

. got stuck in the snow right outside the Techny address, and
JERRY would not “even bother to help push" him out. OLSEN
never met any relatives of JERRY RAY and first knew that
JERRY had a brother, JAMES RAY, when he read it in the :
newspapers a few weeks ago,. GJERDIS never mentioned having
met JAMES, and OLSEN was unaware of a visit by one of the... ~
RAY brothers to the Techny Road address. He recalled “that:
Shortly after they were married, JERRY RAY and GJERDIS went

| to Missouri to see JERRY’s relatives with the intention,” a

of living there but he heard no more about this,

OLSEN concluded that he feels there is something 7
wrong mentally with GJERDIS, who just moved from Lake Forest’ -
to a motel in Des Plaines and who iswrking as a waitress ~~: --*
at the Kopper Kettle, Highland Park. Mrs. OLSEN works as
a babysitter at the J. D, SIMMONS residence, B2724 Birchwood
Lane, Highland Park, phone 945-5029, 7

Interviewed separately May 7, 1968, at B2724 Birchwood
Lane, Mrs. PAUL OLSEN verified generally what her husband. -..,.:.
had said and added that GJERDIS is highly nervous and emotional,
takes pills and is under doctor's care, principally because «:

of the strain of having placed her baby out for adoption

last summer in an attempt ‘to preserve her marriage with
JERRY RAY. She said GJERDIS, who was born April 12, 1948 a

married JERRY RAY in Chicago in about January, 1967, and they

! first lived at Arlington Heights before moving to 2897 Techny
Road, Northbrook. Before GJERDIS and JERRY were separated
in the fall of 1967, Mrs, OLSEN visited them about three
x» times, but at no time saw any of JERRY's relatives. Whe
papers related, much to her surprise, a few weeks ago tha
JAMES RAY and JERRY RAY were brothers, she recalled the fol

CG 44-1114
RJD: jap

Ewe incidents, the dates of which she could not precisi
place:

The first was GJERDIS’ relating to her about the -

/ trip she and JERRY-took to St. Louis where JERRY visited a

= brother and his father who lived near there, GJERDIS told

of "waiting in a theater" for JERRY while he went with his ..:
brother on some sort of mission. This trip was shortly

after the marriage, probably in the early spring of 1967,

" which Mrs, OLSEN related to a time when GJERDIS had just

quit working for Culligan's in Arlington or Northbrook. es

The other incident concerned 2a phone call GJERDIS
made to Mrs. OLSEN from Northbrook,’ in which she said that
"something funny” was going on because she, GJERDIS, had
discovered some strange clothes left in the garage by
JERRY's brotter from St, Louis; further, that. this brother’ -
had taken JERRY's car and left. GJERDIS told Mrs, OLSEN

that she "just don't understand" and that she had not.
really seen the brother. ‘

When the publicity about. JAMES EARL RAY came out,
Mrs, OLSEN and GJERDIS tried to set the time of the foregoing’
car incident and figured that it must have been April, 1967, ...._
because "he (JAMES RAY) didn't escape until late in April"
and they chose to assume that it was brother JAMES who:
was there at the time,

Mrs. OLSEN concluded that she is certain that
. GJERDIS has never in her life seen JAMES EARL RAY from what aa
she has told and indicated to her (Mrs, OLSEN). She aueetaee
cautioned that.GJEHDIS’ mind would "wander" when agents.
talked with her and she heat not be able to bates Specific.
dates and places.

It is noted that Mrs. OLSEN as well as her husband
pledged complete cooperation and said they would immediately
contact the FBI should they hear or learn any information
re subject.

-GJERDIS DOROTHEA ANNA OLSEN (she has again ass

Minnesota, who would frequently go off on unexplained ~
tangents in response to questions, was interviewed outside .
her place of employment, Kopper Kettle, Routes 41 and 22, .
Highland Park, She said she had been "expecting" agents,
that she really had no “good" information, but that she
would cooperate in any way. She advised as follows:

Since May 4, 1968, she has beenzesiding at Randel’s
Motel, Apartment 12, Des Plaines, but intends to move in the
near future to Waukegan. She drives a 1962 Plymouth with ~
1968 Illinois license HK 6917, She married WILLIAM STREET,
Mundelein, Illinois, August 31, 1966, and gave birth to his -
baby October 13, 1966. She divorced him in Chicago in about
January, 1967, after having met JERRY RAY who was working --
at Sportsmans, In about Christmas, 1966, she and JERRY -..
went to St. Louis and visited his father and his sister, ..
MELBA, and her husband. There was another man there, probably :
a brother, but she never heard his name. She first knew of |
a brother, JOHN, when in early 1967, at the Techny Road
address, she happened to see a clipping in which it, was tee
: _mentioned that JOHN RAY was in some kind of trouble, She ~ “*
never talked to JERRY about this, however, and she never knew ~
there was a JAMES RAY until after it “came out in the :
papers," She has seen numerous pictures of JAMES RAY since ~
and'is quite sure" she has never seen him before. As to .;
her waiting in a theater in St. Louis, she responded only
that she did go to a movie one time rather than go with
JERRY on some sort of errand.

After the publicity about JAMES, she and her mother
recalled the incidgnt wherein a brother from St. Louis, » name

JERRY WILLIAM Y was shown the new eseea on of “his
brother, JAMES EARL RAY, in a business suit taken sometime in| ~
January or February, 1968. After viewing the photograph,
/ JERRY stated that the photograph is a good likeness of his
brother except tht~he remembers him being thinner in the
face. In fact, this particular photograph depicts JAMES
fuller in the face, than JERRY has ever seen him,

JERRY advised that his father, | JERRY RAYNES,

Center, Missouri, left his mother in 1951 to live with RUBY
CARPENTER. RUBY has a son, JEROME, who is presently in
prison, Jefferson,City, Missouri, and is acquainted with
the subject. JERRY also knows JEROME since he was in the .
reformatory at St. Charles, Illinois, with him. JERRY
classified JEROME as being “off mentally" and a person who
very seldom talks to anyone. JERRY believes that JEROME ~~
may have been in the hospital for the criminally insane at
Fulton, Missouri, when the subject escaped from prison. ./ _
JEROME is presently doing time for the murder of a Negro. °°

. JERRY also related that when his father left, JERRY was :
in’ the Boys’ Reformatory at Sheridan, Illinois.

JERRY said that he does not know NEAL EDGAR AEBY,-
JAMES DAVID DAILEY, nor is he acquainted with the Half Way
Restaurant at 1549 South Jefferson, St. Louis, Missouri.
He said that he never heard his brother mention DAILEY nor
does he have any information that DAILEY had ever hidden peeeeitet
his brother from the law. JERRY also advised that he never ~~
heard of an organization named the "Coolies" nor did he ever, -
hear his brother mention that organization. JERRY said °°
that when he was in prison, he was involved in a fist fight
with (First Name Unknown) MENARD, who worked with him in -
the shoe shop. He said that he could not recall this
individual's first name and that there would be no record

MES» : aoe

JERRY said he visited his brother about three
or four times while he was in prison in Jefferson City,
Missouri, the last time being around 1964. JAMES came to
Menard prison to visit JERRY on one occasion. JERRY again”.

of prison was in 1951 in Quincy, Illinois, and JERRY was
fifteen years old at that time. The father was still
living with his mother then.

He said that he believes that WALTER TERRY RIFE and
JAMES went to Leavenworth together but that LONNIE RIFE _
never did time with JAMES. He said-that if he had given |
the impression that LONNIE did do time with JAMES in the
previous interviews, this was in error. JERRY again stated
that he himself has done time in Menard, Illinois, with aren
both RIFE brothers.

He stated that he has no idea as to the presént .
whereabouts of "BLACKIE" AUSTIN and doubts if his brother ‘
has maintained contact with AUSTIN nor would be in contact
with him since his escape. He said that of all of the
persons that he knows of, JAMES was the friendliest and.
closest with AUSTIN, JERRY pointed out, however, that his
knowledge of this is limited since JERRY was in prison
when both AUSTIN and his brother were on the street. He
does know that"BLACKIE"” liked his brother and has ‘always
talked about him. |

In clarification, JERRY advised that his brothe
JOHN first came to Chicago sometime around July, 1960, and
he, JERRY, came to this area around September, 1960. JOHN
first worked at Murphy's Steak House, He also worked at
the White Pines Country Club and JOHN's last employment “in ~ |
the Chicago area was the Indian Hills Country Club, Bloomingdale
Illinois. JERRY advised that he was employed with his Rene
brothers JOHN and FRANK at the Rolling Green Country Club.
beginning in September, 1960 and JERRY stayed there for
about sixteen months and JOHN for eight or nine months. -.

FRANK worked there 1- believed he had left a good leng



‘time prior to his death in September, 1963.

JERRY advised that sometime during June or : ;
duly, 1967, when he was living at 2897 Techny Road, Northbrook,
Illinois, JOHN drove here in a 1961 Plymouth which he had Pee eee
bought from the father, JERRY RAYNES. At this time, JERRY .
owned a 1962 air-conditioned Rambler. JOHN was having ~
trouble with the transmission in the Plymouth and they
Ve switched cars, He does recall that JOHN transferred some
_ clothes and other items from the Plymouth to the Rambler.
* Also, that JOHN left some old shirts and pants and some_
other papers in the garage at Techny Road and JERRY hid
these items above the rafters in the garage. He said that
JOHN stayed a couple of days and was in either an apartment
or a hotel in Chicago and did not reside at JERRY'’s residence
while here. JOHN left with the Rambler and both cars are
presently at his father's farm in Center, Missouri. JERRY’
said that his wife did not meet JOHN on this occasion but
did meet him at Christmas time, 1967, when JERRY and his:
i wife went to St. Louis where they had dinner at CAROL ~- -

PEPPER's house and JOHN was present. JERRY advised that
JOHN did not know how to find his residence in Northbrook,
Illinois, and that he, JERRY, met him in the town of PEEL
Northbrook and then JOHN followed him to the residence.,.
JERRY also advised that his brother JAMES did not ever know
that JERRY resided at this address in Northbrook.

In previous interviews, JERRY advised that he
borrowed somewhere between $40 and $50 from his brother
| JAMES while JAMES was in prison. He reiterated that state-
ment in this interview at which time the financial trans— 7
| actions from his brother's account at the Inmates Bank,” <
Missouri State Penitentiary, Jefferson City, Missouri,’ were
| discussed with JERRY. It was pointed out to him that this
| list shows that’ his brother had sent him $266.25, JERRY

advised that this must be an error since the only amount =:

he recognized was $55.25 which was sent to him on June 22,

1964, He stated that at this time, he, JERRY, was in

St. Louis, Missouri, and needed more y to return to Chicago

to obtain employment, He wrote to his brother requesting
this loan and was in the process of paying JAMES back whe:

NW 68486 Docld:32989755 Page 413



” 2 JAMES ‘oncaped. JERRY suggested that the money listed to
7 “him was instead paid to his brother's attorney, name unknown,
+ “an Jefferson City, Missouri. JERRY advised that he himself
fee did not receive money from his brother to be sent to the ~
attorney or anyone else. JERRY advised-that this attorney
bad been hired by his brother to handle his appeal and that
“ he believed the attorney did visit with JAMES while JAMES
was in prison, JERRY said that his brother never mentioned _
anything concerning Benzedrine inhalers or any type of
"bennies" or dope. JAMES never mentioned being involved
in any illegal drug selling while in prison nor did he..
ever mention that he was involved in any type of racket
with a guard. He also never mentioned any guard that he
was particularly friendly with and in fact, made no comment
whatsoever concerning the prison officials that JERRY can
remember,

JERRY also advised that his brother never — +
mentioned reading any of the James Bond novels and in “*° -
fact, JERRY did not believe his brother was much of .a
"ypeader."” The only location that he can recall his brother
making a comment as to how much he liked it was Tijuana,
jonens -Mexico, and he believes his brother was there sometime in
1951. The brother made no mention to him at anytime as
to the identity of any persons with whom he was acquainted
in Mexico.

JERRY advised that when he left Giese. on this :
latter occasion, he stayed with his brother JOHN for two
: nights, with his father one night, with his sister CAROL |
4 oo one night, at the St. Regis Hotel one night and at the
a Mac Arthur Hotel one night. In conversations with his | -
brother JOHN and sister CAROL, they both stated that they ~
believe, from newspaper stories, that the subject is the
victim of a frame-up or being used as the “fall guy." He
also stated that CAROL is concerned over the newspaper
articles speculating that the subject is dead and she has.

n ‘bin to close down for that day which he did not do a8

NW 68486 Docld:32989755 Pagé 414

that opinion. He said that JOHN told him that some people. __



JOHN ‘also said that if he himself receives any publicity
“hewill- close down the tavern and leave because he feels
‘that people will throw firebombs in his place. JERRY
related that one of the newspaper reporters located and
interviewed a woman named RUBY who works for his brother
since JOHN bad used that woman's address about three or .
four years ago. RUBY told the newspaper people that she .
did not know the whereabouts of JOHN. JERRY also said that
in conversations with JOHN, JOHN told him that the subject ~
would be “crazy” to give himself up because even if he -
is not guilty of the KING murder, he still would have .
eighteen years to do in the penitentiary at Jefferson City
JERRY explained this by stating that his brother has eames
thirteen years left on his previous sentence and that

he would get at least an extra five years for the estape.. ”

: JERRY again speculated that if his brother
was KING's murderer, he would have had to have been paid <
because he could not see how his brother would have obtained
enough money to purchase the 1966 Mustang, take the trips
he was supposed to have taken and to pay $150 for the —
telescope used in the murder. He said that there was just
too much money coming in and in response to a direct ques-
tion, he said that he did not think his brother would have
been able to steal this much money because he would have had
“slipped up and been caught." He explained that in his :
opinion, his brother was not an accomplished thief and that ©
most of his previous scores were "small time."

JERRY advised that he is presently residing in
Apartment 14, 314 Wisconsin Avenue, Lake Forest, Illinois,
“which rooming house was recommended to the Sportsman's .
Country Club by WAYNE CLANDENEN (phonetic). JERRY noted --
that his ex-wife DJERDIS also used to reside at this rooming
house, He said that he is not listed as a tenant and that
the rent of $60 per month is being paid by the country club.
He advised that there is'no phone at the building with the
nearest one four blocks away. He said that he plans to
continue his employment at the Sportsman's Country Club
and will contact SA RENE J, DUMAINE on a daily basis. _

NW 68486 Docid:32989755 Page 415



He advised that his ex-wife presently works at ~~
a restaurant near the expressway and is living in a motel _
an Wheeling, Illinois. He went on to say that yesterday
- -there was a knock on the door of his apartment. and when

, he opened it, his ex-wife was there. She said that she _
“had found him by inquiring of the rooming house manager,
the room numbers of the last two tenants and then came to --""
‘talk with him. He said that they talked of personal matters
‘with nothing of interest in this case. JERRY advised that 7
he may have to move from this address since his ex-wife met)
might inadvertently give out his whereabouts. He said that |
‘he was not concerned with the problem of people making”

threats against his safety because of what his brother did’

but that he was most concerned of the people who would

attempt to harm him without making threats. In explanation,

he made the comment, "Like that guy who shot King, * cet
did not make any threats. - oat

JERRY denied having any information which would in the
slightest way indicate that his brother or his sister
aided. the subject in his escape and have had any idea of
the subject's whereabouts since his escape.

JERRY then stated that his. brother JOHN had told
him that the FBI had combed a two-block area looking for a
JACK GAWRON, since it had been developed that GAWRON had
been acquainted with JAMES, JERRY said that JOHN knows that
GAWRON. has been interviewed by the FBI but JOHN did not
indicate to JERRY that GAWRON had ever stated what he had
told the FBI,

JERRY said that in the past, he had driven GAWRON

around looking at possible burglary scores at which time
GAWRON would pay the expenses, To JERRY's knowledge, GAWRON -
never committed any burglary in any of the places in which. |
they had "cased" and’in JERRY's.opinion, GAWRON is "living on '
past glories." . JERRY then stated that GAWRON was.a name that
obably should have given to the Agents before since he, _

JERRY, was aware that GAWRON had. served time with his brother”

JAMES, JERRY expressed the opinion that JAMES would’ not contact.
* GAWRON ‘but believes that SAMES does know GAWRON well, considering
- him to be slightly "stir crazy." JERRY did not> mention whether

or not GAWRON and JAMES participated in burglaries together

and made no comment as to the closeness of association ‘between

them. .

made to apprehend his brother without hurting him.

He eventually became night. maintenance man at the club. and
has always in this capacity performed his work in a capable
manner and was honest. in every respect; however, — Ais of

» the opinion that RAY, has. a low mental capacity.

off and needed someone to work in their place. He at no time
spoke of other members of His family other than to say that

Her records revealed that RAY worked steadily during the
night at the Sportsman Country Club from Wednesday evening,
April 3, 1968, through Monday , April 8, 1968 without

having any time off, as

She is.of the opinion that RAY is not cooperating
with the FBI in every respect, does not feel that some of ‘the. -
questions asked of him are important enough for-him to give
any thought in answering; however; it could be that dué to |
‘his low mental condition: that he is not capable of answering -

Mrs. PEPPER estimates that after the death of her grandmothar
she probably wrote no more than three or four letters to the
subject at the penitentiary. She is unable to recall the
last such letter she wrote to him but the last time may have ©
been as late as the early part of 1967. She occasionally

Mrs, ALBERT (CAROL) PEPPER, 2025 Bellevue, Maplewood, ~~
Missouri, was interviewed at. her residence, at which time she. -
furpished the following information:

Mrs, PEPPER has received no information regarding
her brother, JAWZS ZARL RAY. (whome she refers to as JIM),
since the last previous interview with her by the FBI.

Within the past several days, police officers from
the St. Louis Police Department came to see Mrs. PEPPER indi-
cating to her that they had received some inquiry from a
newspaper, possibly "The Los Angeles Times” according to a
PEPPER'S recollection of what they said; this inquiry having a
to do with the finances of the RAY famtiy. The police officers
apparently came to see Urs. PEPPER just to find out some general
information about her, and they suggested to her that if people
wanted to talk to her nbout her finarices, she might want to
obtain a lawyer. A representative of "The St. Louis Post .

ae Dispatch” newspaper also came to see Mrs. PEPPER within the
, preceding few days, but she refused to talk to him. Urs. .
. PEPPER has heard from an acquaintance that there was an article .-
a few days ago in "The St. Lovis Post Dispatch” which seemed cae
to be 2 rehash of the erroneous informatiop which appeared in
a "Life Magazine” article concerning the RAY family, but Mrs.
PEPPER herself did not read this newspaper article. .

. Mrs. PEPPER and her family went to see her father
at Center, Missouri, over the preceding weekend, May 18-19,
1968. She has been custemarily going to see hin there during
weekends and usually takes him groceries, She is the one in
the family who maintains contact with the father and looks
after his needs. The farm which the father bought. about-six
months ago is believed to consist or about forty acres of
which a little is probably tillabie, and she thinks her father
will grow corn on this part of the farm, but the remainder is -
suitable only for livestock and grazing. She thinks that he
paid some amount in the neighborhood of $2,600 for this farm. :
Mrs, PEPPER is uncertain in her recollection, but balieves it fete,
may be correct that she gave him a check drawn‘on her account
in the amount of $1,900 at the time he was purchasing this :
farm and which was applied to the purchase. If so, this rad :

purchased the farm, he _soid the property in St. Louis which

a two-story residential building. Urs, PEOPER believes he

-this was a return of his money or a loan.
r

While Mrs, PEPPER's father resided in St. Louis
before the purckase of the farm at Center, Missouri, he had
various jobs, such as, service station attendart, and he also
At one time operated a second-hand store where he sold junk.
This business was also located on Park Avenue, but was some-
where east of Twelfth Street, a considerable distance fron
1519 Park. Her father did not own the aad cd where he con--
ducted this second-hand business. Se

Until Hr. and Hrs, PEPPER movec to their present
- residence in the fall of 1967, Mrs, PRPPEA was always employed
ever since their marriage in Decenber of 1962, During that
period of time, they have practiced thrift and economy and
have always endeavored to save something from their income.
They opened a savings account several years ago at the
Bobemian Savings and Loan Aeseciaticn on South Bight teenth

One of the places in St. Louis where Mrs.. PEPPER
lived with her father. prior to her marriage was 1727 South
Eleventh Street. She believes hex brother BUZZ¥ lived with
them there part of the time, but she is certain that her
brother JIM never lived with them there. Mrs. PEPPER never.
had any knowledge of her brother JIM having used the name fea
O'CONNOR, and she never knew of any bank acceunts he may have
had at any bank at any time, In fact, Mrs. PEPPER had so |
little contact or kncwledge cf her brother JIM that she can
now recall having seen him only on possibly 2 couple of occa-
Sions when she was small and shortly. after he was discharged
from military service, and she recalis sesing”him on one ccca~ ~
sion on the str in South St. Louis at some later time after
she moved to St. Levis with her father. Although Mrs. PEPPER
was known as CAROL RYAN as of 1959, she has no knowledge: or
recollection of having received any checks from-her hrother
JIM or from any person under the nam2 JAMES CARL O’ CONNOR,
either in 1959 or any other time. She can thirk of no reason
why ske might ever have received any suck checks. Mrs. PEPPER
is certain that she has aever had any financial dealings of-
any type with her krother JIM in ker life.

~ JERRY WILLIAM Y¥ was shown the new photograph 20)
“brother, JAMES EARL RAY, in a business suit taken sometime in
January or February, 1968. After viewing the photograph,
/ JERRY stated that the photograph is a good likeness of his

brother except tht-he remembers him being thinner in the
face. In fact, this particular photograph depicts JAMES
fulier in the face.than JERRY has ever seen bim.

JERRY advised that his father, JERRY RAYNES.,
Center, Missouri, left his mother in 1951 ta live with ‘RUBY
CARPENTER, RUBY has a son, JEROME, who is presently in ° --*"~
prison, Jefferson,City, Missouri, and is acquainted with
the subject. JERRY also knows JEROME since he was in the .
reformatory at St. Charles, Illinois, with him. JERRY
classified JEROME as being “off mentally" and a person who
very seldom talks to anyone. JERRY believes that JEROME ©.
may have been in the hospital for the criminally insane at
Fulton, Missouri, when the subject escaped from prison. ,
JEROME is presently doing time for the murder of a Negro.
JERRY also related that when his father left, JERRY was
in'the Boys' Reformatory at Sheridan, Illinois.

He said that he never heard his brother mention DAILEY nor
does he have any information that DAILEY had ever hidden |
his brother from the law. JERRY also advised that he never -—

that when he was in prison, he was involved in a fist fight

ae were then in alates City, Missouri, Leas with
S. :

JERRY said he visited his brother about three
or four times while he was in prison in Jefferson City,
Missouri, the last time being around 1964. JAMES came to -
Menard prison to visit JERRY on one occasion. JERRY again’.
stated that the last time he saw his brother JAMES outside
of prison was in 1951 in Quincy, Illinois, and JERRY. was
fifteen years old at that time. The father was still
living with his mother then. as :

He said that he believes that WALTER TERRY RIFE and
JAMES went to Leavenworth together but that LONNIE RIFE |
never did time with JAMES, He said-that if he had given |.
the impression that LONNIE did do time with JAMES in the
previous interviews, this was in error. JERRY again stated
that he himself has done time in Menard, Illinois, with ao
both RIFE brothers.

He stated that he has no idea as to the presént .
whereabouts of “BLACKIE” AUSTIN and doubts if his brother *~
has maintained contact with AUSTIN nor would be in contact
with him since his escape. He said that of all of the |
persons that he knows of, JAMES was the friendliest and
closest with AUSTIN, JERRY pointed out, however, that hi
knowledge of this is limited since JERRY was in prison
when both AUSTIN and his brother were on the street, He
does know that"BLACKIE" liked his brother and has Eaaltde
talked about him.

In clarification, JERRY advised that his es
JOHN first came to Chicago sometime around July, 1960, and
he, JERRY, came to this area around September, 1960. JOHN
first worked at Murphy's Steak House, He also worked at
the White Pines Country Club and JOHN's last employment ‘in
the Chicago area was the Indian Hills Country Club, Bloomingdale,
Illinois. JERRY advised that he was employed with his
brothers JOHN and FRANK at the Rolling Green Country Club
beginning in September, 1960 and JERRY stayed there for : -
about sixteen months and JOHN for eight or nine months

ime prior to his death in September, 1963.

JERRY advised that sometime during June or
duly, 1967, when he was living at 2897 Techny Road, Northbrook,
Illinois, JOHN drove here in a 1961 Plymouth which he had | ~.
bought from the father, JERRY RAYNES, At this time, JERRY.
owned a 1962 air-conditioned Rambler, JOHN was having ~
trouble with the transmission in the Plymouth and they
switched cars. He does recall that JOHN transferred some
clothes and other items from the Plymouth to the Rambler,
Also, that JOHN left some old shirts and pants and some.
other papers in the garage at Techny Road and JERRY hid
these items above the rafters in the arage. He said that
JOHN stayed a couple of days and was in either an apartment: -
or a hotel in Chicago and did not reside at JERRY's residence
while here. JOHN left with the Rambler and both cars are . :
presently at his father's farm in Center, Missouri. JERRY’
Said that his wife did not meet JOHN on this occasion but.
did meet him at Christmas time, 1967, when JERRY and hia’
wife went to St, Louis where they had dinner at CAROL --
PEPPER's house and JOHN was present. JERRY advised that
JOHN did not know how to find his residence in Northbrook,
Illinois, and that he, JERRY, met him in the town of sensed
Northbrook and then JOHN followed him to the residence. ~
JERRY also advised that his brother JAMES did not ever know
that JERRY resided at this address in Northbrook, .

In previous interviews, JERRY advised that he
borrowed somewhere between $40 and $50 from his brother _
JAMES while JAMES was in prison. He reiterated that state-
ment in this interview at which time the financial trans-
actions from his brother's account at the Inmates Bank,’: .
Missouri State Penitentiary, Jefferson City, Missouri,- were
discussed with JERRY. It was pointed out to him that this
list shows that his brother had sent him $266.25. JERRY
advised that this must be an error since the only amount
he recognized was $55.25 which was sent to him on June 22,
1964, He stated that at this time, he, JERRY, was in

St. Louis, Missouri, and needed mor y to return to Chicago
to obtain employment. He‘wrote to his brother requesting
this loan and was in the process of paying JAMES back. whe:

ry escaped. JERRY suggested that the money listed to ~%
“him was instead paid to his brother's attorney, name unkn: ;
in Jefferson City, Missouri. JERRY advised that he himself
did not receive money from his brother to.be sent to the ~
attorney or anyone else. JERRY advised-that this attorney
had been hired by his brother to handle his appeal and that
he believed the attorney did visit with JAMES while JAMES ~:
- was in prison, JERRY said that his brother never mentioned
anything concerning Benzedrine inhalers or any type of
“pennies” or dope. JAMES never mentioned being involved

in any illegal drug selling while in prison nor did he .
ever mention that he was involved in any type of racket

with a guard, He also never mentioned any guard that -he

was particularly friendly with and in fact, made no comment
whatsoever concerning the prison officials that JERRY can

remember.

JERRY also advised that his brother hever |
mentioned reading any of the James Bond novels and in a
fact, JERRY did not believe his brother was much of a .
“peader." The only location that he can recall his brother
making a comment as to how much he liked it was Tijuana,
-Mexico, and he believes his brother was there sometime in
1951. The brother made no mention to him at anytime ag

to the identity of any persons with whom he was acquainted
in Mexico.

JERRY advised that when he left Chicago on this -
latter occasion, he stayed with his brother JOHN for two
nights, with his father one night, with his sister CAROL
one night, at the St. Regis Hotel one night and at the :
Mac Arthur Hotel one night. In conversations with his.
brother JOHN and sister CAROL, they both stated that they
believe, from newspaper stories, that the subject is the
victim of a frame-up or being used as the "fall guy." He
also stated that CAROL is concerned over the newspaper
articles speculating that the subject is dead and she has
that opinion. He said that JOHN told him that some people aS
came to the tavern at the time of the KING funeral request-

*ing him to close down for that day which he did not do.

that people will throw firebombs in his place. JERRY

‘which rooming house was recommended to the Sportsman's

.house. He said that he is not listed as a tenant and that

_ and will contact SA RENE J. DUMAINE on a daily basis.

DHN also said that if he himself receives any publicity
ie will-close down the tavern and leave because he feels

related that one of the newspaper reporters located and
interviewed a woman named RUBY who works for his brother
since JOHN had used that woman's address about three or

four years ago. RUBY told the newspaper people that she .
did not know the whereabouts of JOHN. JERRY also said that
in conversations with JOHN, JOHN told him that the subject
would be “crazy” to give himself up because even if he a
is not guilty of the KING murder, he still would have . eS
eighteen years to do in the penitentiary at Jefferson City.

JERRY explained this by stating that his brother has ea
thirteen years left on his previous sentence and that

he would get at least an extra five years for the escape. ..

JERRY again speculated that if his brother
was KING's murderer, he would have had to have been paid -
because he could not see how his brother would have obtained
enough money to purchase the 1966 Mustang, take the trips
he was supposed to have taken and to pay $150 for the ~
telescope used in the murder, He said that there was just
too much money coming in and in response to a direct ques~
tion, he said that he did not think his brother would have
been able to steal this much money because he would have had
“slipped up and been caught." He explained that in his
opinion, his brother was not an accomplished thief and that
most of his previous scores were "small time."

JERRY advised that he is presently residing eas
Apartment 14, 314 Wisconsin Avenue, Lake Forest, Illinois

Country Club by WAYNE CLANDENEN (phonetic). JERRY noted -
that his ex-wife DJERDIS also used to reside at this rooming

the rent of $60 per month is being paid by the country club
He advised that there is no phone at the building with the
nearest one four blocks away. He said that he plans to
continue his employment at the Sportsman's Country Club



2 He advised that his ex-wife presently works at

a restaurant near the expressway and is living in a motel __
in Wheeling, Illinois, He went on to say that yesterday
. there was a knock on the door of his apartment and when
. he opened it, his ex-wife was.there, She said that she _.
had found him by inquiring of the rooming house manager,

. the room numbers of the last two tenants and then came to
talk with him. He said that they talked of personal matters
-with nothing of interest in this case. JERRY advised that
he may have to move from this address since his ex-wife .
might inadvertently give out his whereabouts. He said that
‘ he was not concerned with the problem of people making”
threats against his safety because of what his brother did’
but that he was most concerned of the people who would :
attempt to harm him without making threats. In explanation,
he made the comment, "Like that guy who shot peas a
did not make any threats."

JERRY advised that he will continue to cooperate
with the Bureau in furnishing information.

July 24, 1968

.Information set forth below covers the
established activities of captioned individual who, as
ERIC ETARVO GALT, vieited Mexico during October and
November, 1987.

| aexxcan GOVERNMENT necoans|™

On April 11, 1968, at Atlanta, Georgia, a 1966
white Mustang bearing’ flabama license 1-38993, was
recovered, This car had vehicle identification number
6T07C190647, and on the car was Mexican tourist sticker
bearing Folio number H294485, showing that the car had
crogsed the border at Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas.

Inveetigation at Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas, on
April 12, 1968, showed that thie automobile crossed the
border on Cetober 7, 1967. Documents for the automobile
weré issued to ERIC "s. GALT, who bad tourist card number
7475449 and listed address as 2608 Highland,
Birmingham, Alabama,’ ) :

‘At Mexico, D.F., Mexico

E lt. bh 0b el fa,
On April 24, 1968, a confidential source abroad’

advised that contact with an official of the Inspectio:

Service of Mexican Immigration in Mexico City disclosed

that this agency had searched records for all onareaiya



JAMBE BERL RAY, aka

by land from Mexico during the second half of November,
1967, This search included all exit points from the
Pacific to the Gulf of Mexico, and no record was located
ba the oo of GALT bearing tourist card mentioned
ove.

On July 18, 1968, the source advised that the
same official wes contacted on that date and reported
that efforts to locate the Mexican tourist card, which
should have been currendered by GALT upon his departure
from Mexico, had been unsuccessful. The official stated
that his office had directly contacted every exit point
along the border between Mexico and the United States, in
an attempt to locate this card, with negative results. ~
He stated, therefore,that GALT probably left Mexico without
surrendering hig tourist card, which is a fairly common
occurrence because of the volume of traffic at all of
the border crossing points.(&.) :

On’ July 18, 1968, this same source advised
that contact had been meintained on a regular basis,
since fpril 12, 1968, with headquarters of the Mexican
Federal Automobile Pegistration Bureau at Mexico, D.F.,
the agency where all documents issued to vehicles of
tourists are eventually received and filed, Officials
of this agency have advised that, despite extensive
review of their records, the tourist importation permit

_ for the 1966 Muetang which was issued to GALT at the

* border on October 7, 1967, had not been returned to that
egency from any border crossing point. It was the
conclusion of these officials, therefore, that GALT
left Mexico in the Mustang without surrendering this
document, ()

HOTEL RECORDG . :
‘ \at Puerto Vallarta Jalisco ()

4A second confidential source abroad advised
on April 14, 1238, that on that same date EDUARDO
MARRQ@_UL , owner, Hotel Rio, Morelos 86, advised that
PRIC €, GALT was a guest in that hotel from October 19,
1967, through November 5, 1967, MARROCUI stated that, t.

-2-



a , o |

JAMES EARL RAY, aka

according to his recollection, GALT was alone, and
MARROQUI, did not recoll anything concerning LT's
car or possible friendships with other guests

On April 15, 1968, ROBERTO TONG, clerk, Hotel
Rio, furnished the registration eard for PRIC &, "GALT,
giving his address as 2608 Highland Avenue, Birmingham,
Alabama. He occupied Room 212 at the rate ‘ot 60 pesos
($4.80 U.G.) per day. ‘The card shows his arrival on
October 19, 1267, and taat he checked out on November 6,
1967, It also bears the signature "ERIC 8. GALT. ‘{7>)

The Document Section of the FBI Laboratory
examined two photostatic copies of the registration card
of the Hotel Rio in the name of ERIC £, GéALT/and
concluded that the questioned writings on the ffegietra-
tion card| vere prepared by the writer of other specimens)
received matter which have been attributed to
Bartana

ROBERTO YONG also advised on April 15, 1968,
that there were no long-distance telephone calls =
charged to GALT's room. re)

On April 17 P “1968, YONG stated that he
renenbered GALT as a “loner” at the hotel. He said GALT
:Wwas never seen around the hotel during the day and did
not stay esround the hotel in the evening, He did come
in to eat, He was always alone, with the exception of

FIRECTONS DPLUZE CHAMPION TIRE, CIZE 7.50 X 14

In connection with the recovery of the white
1966 Mustang at /tlanta, Georgia, on April 11, 1968, it
was discovered that the right front tire on this car was
a Firestone Deluxe Champion, size 7.50 x 14, six-ply
rating. f&temped on the tire were the words "Hecha en
Mexico," with the following identifying numbere:
2-ME-2; BD~33595; N20Z031154, The tube of this tire
had a stamp thereon: "G7, General Popo 7,50 x 14,
Made for Helke Poc, General Popo, £.A., Mexico D.1I,"

; zt Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco Kexico)(t)

On Mey 7, 1658, JUAN MANUEL FREGOCO GUTIERREZ,
Avenida Mexico 50, advised the second source that he
operates # gasoline station at the corner of 31 de
Octubre and 31 de Mayo, and that his wife operates a
Fireetone tire store which he owns at Avenida Mexico 50,

On May 7, 1968, Mrs, GENCVEVA CURIEL DE
FREGOEO, proprietor of the Firestone Store, advised the e
second source that she did not personally recall seeing
the Subject or his car since she was upstairs in her
apartment at the time of the transaction. She did
-recal]l that an American came in several months earlier
to buy a 7.45 x 14 tire and, since they did not have one
in stock, the clerk sold him a 7.50 x 14. lirs. FREGOCO
said that this man asked for a discount because the tire
wae the wrong size, and the clerk called up to the
apertment for authority to give the discount. Mrs.
FREGOECO s: A she authorized a ten percent discount on
the sale, .

Hrs, FREGOSO could recall nothing further about
the actual sale, and stated that her brother had mounted
the tire on the car, but could recall nothing of the
incident, he said the store kept no record of tire
serial numbere except to note them on the sales slip
at the time of the sale for guaranty purposes, fhe
searched invoices of tires received by the store from the
Firestone factory and noted that there were no serial
numbers in these invoices, Ehe was, therefore, unable to
state whether a particular tire had ever been in their
inventory. GA 7

JAMES EARL REY, ats

TERECE FERNANDEZ, clerix, Firestone Store, ~<*¥ilJLi!

Avenida Mexico 50, advised the second source on May 7,

1968, that the photograph of the Subject wearing sun-
glasses was immediately recognizable as a man who came

into the store one morning to buy a tire. She said he

had apparently come from the General Popo Tire tore

two doors away. Che could not recall ti te, but
believed that it was in January, 1968.

Miss FERNANDEZ remembered that the Subject's
white Mustang had a tire which was badly road-damaged
and he asked for a replacement, size 7.45 x 14. Since
there were none of thie size in stock, she said, he took
a size 7,50 x 14 Firestone tire, but requested a discount
since it was the wrong size. Miss FERNANDEZ said she
spoke to Hrs, FREGOSO, who was in the upstairs apartment,
and a ten percent discount was authorized. fhe said
that, since the tire was slightly larger, and becauce the
use of tubes is alweys recommended due to the difficvit
terrain, the fubject walked to the General Popo Store
and came back with a tube which he had purchased himself.
The.tire yas mounted outside the store by Mrs. FREGOCO's
brother,

Miss FERNANDEZ searched for the sales slip
recording thie transaction, but was unable to locate it.

“She said that the Subject did not give her his name,

and that,since he was not a Mexican, she did not bother
to ask his name or to note the serial number of the tire
on the sajeg slip, since this is only done for guaranty
purposes.(e-) ;
Continying, Miss FREGOCO said she lives near
the Casa Susana and, efter che sold the tire, she
remembered seeing the same white Muctang parked on
Calle 31 de Cctubre around the corner from the Casa
€usana. The car was parked in front of a vacant lot
and she thought this strange cince che saw it there
ebout 8 in the morning on several occasions while she
was walking to work. On one occasion as she was on her
way to lunch, ehe saw the Subject park his car and
walls up and turn into Matamoros Street. She said she
never saw him with any other person and that he was alone’
the day he came to the etore to purchase the tire. (CS

J6MBS EARL RAY, aca

On May 7, 1968, ANA MARIA MADERO, clerk,
General Popo Tire Store, Avenida Mexico 32, advised the
second source that the code "G7" indicates that a
tube with this marking will fit a 7.50 x 14 tire. She
said she did not recognize the photograph of the
Subject or recall his car. Che could find no record
of a sale of any item ‘ON PRIC GALT from October 7,
1967, to Mey 7, 1968. &

Miss MADFRO stated that if she did not know
the name of the person to whom she made a rale, but
knew that the s2le was connected with a purchase made at
the Firestone Ctore, she normally put the name of
MANUEL FRPGCCO on the sales slip, In this connection,

a review of the sales slins showed that a G7 ‘tube was
sold for cash to MANUEL FREGOCO on October 26, 1967,
end on Jenuery 13, 1263. In each case, the price was
57 pesos ($4.56 U.£.),

Mr. Hoover if possible. It was recommended and approved that the Director's regrets

B¥iiculate, carried most of the discussion. : :
Initially, Reverend Abernathy said that there were three points they
wished to discuss with the FBI and he said the first of these had to do with communist
infiltration into the civil rights movement. He said that they all realized that Reverend
King, as the leading civil rights spokesman, was subject to persecution. He mentioned
the pamphlets which had been distributed showing a picture of King at a Highlander
Folk School meeting and he mentioned the constant problem of keeping communists out
of the civil rights movement. Reverend Abernathy said that Jack O'Dell had been a
brought into Reverend King's organization but that O'Dell did have a bad background *
and communist connections and that he had, therefore, been dismissed from the staff
of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). Reverend Abernathy said
hat there had been statements made challenging Mr. King's loyalty but that the truth is
frcered King has always attacked communism in his speeches, in his book, and that
their entire movement is "clean" in this respect. 7 . nN oWet

and that this source could be of possible background assistance.

Reverend Young and Reverend Abernathy said they hoped they could
come to the FBI privately and they were told that they should always feel free to come
to us at any time and they were reminded that Director Hoover had emphasized this
point when he had seen them with Reverend King in November. Reverend Young
made some comment about a press release. He was told that the FBI had no intention
of making a release concerning their visit.

: Reverend Abernathy spoke very generally, pointing out that people -
were always "making charges" and "innuendoes" against Mr. King. He said there
are claims that Dr. King is getting rich and he is using organizational funds-for
his personal use. Reverend Abernathy said the fact is Mr. King receives no salary
from the SCLC whatsoever. I took occasion here to point out that certainly matters
relating to the usage of funds within their organization were of no concern whatsoever

the FBI and that the FBI confined its activities strictly to its statutory limitations ~

J and that we did not have time, let alone the authority to probe into other matters. '

Reverend Young said it looked like there were some attempts to

Smear and ruin the civil rights movement; that just lately there has been some new
evidence in this regard and that very obviously the activities of Mr. King and.
the SCLC are under close surveillance. Young said that as a recent example, King
‘went to the home of Young's secretary while she was in the hospital so that he could
do some writing in private. Reverend Young said that shortly after King arrived in
the secretary's apartment he was tired, was taking pills that made him groggy and
went to sleep. Shortly afterwards he was awakened by a fireman who reported there
Was a major fire at this address. King reported that after the fire trucks left, the
phone in the apartment began ringing but that no one would answer. Young said that
Only he had known that King had gone to this apartment, but that he also had called

| Reverend Abernathy and told him where King was and that as a result of this he was
certain someone had been tapping their phones. EEE aamnaes)

he was asked if Reverend King beliéved he was being followed. Young said he had
ho such information. He said he did feel though there must be some sort of con-
certed organized campaign that was beirg directed against King and the SCLC.
Young added that the SCLC takes for granted its phones are tapped and said he realized

DeLoach to Mohr memo, 1-11-65 _ 4 :
Re: Martin Luther King, Jr. ca paar a cee EEEE aa

Ivery carefully pointed out that certainly the FBI was not interested
in any matter beyond the scope of our jurisdiction. I explained carefully the very
limited use made by the FBI of wire taps. I pointed out that wire taps were used
in certain rfiajor espionage cases, or in a kidnap case where a victim's life is at
stake, that there were very few such taps, and that each and every case required
the express authority of the Attorney General.

At this time both Reverend Young and Reverend Abernathy interrupted :
to say that they, of course, knew better than to imply that the FBI would be involved.

Reverend Abernathy stated that there were three points they had
wanted to discuss; communist infiltration, allegations that King was getting rich ___
on the civil rights movement and the third point nad to do with allegations about :
the personal life and moral character of King. Abernathy bogged down a bit at this
point and said-that, ‘We all are human beings... We all make mistakes." I tried .
to bring out what he meant and asked why he was making such statements. Abernathy

said that he was not going to make allegations against the’ FBI but that some things —
ov going on they just enuidd net understand. fee ce cee oe

Reverend Young said that King had been pecewine some letiers
charging him with immorality, that these letters attacked his personal life and he
pointed out rather lamely that "All humans make mistakes."

I told Reverend Abernathy and Reverend Young that a lot of people did
come to the FBI with rumors and stories and that as a matter of fact, we had heard
allegations reflecting on Dr. King's morality but that certainly we took no action on
such rumors. I emphasized that any prominent person or leader of a movement must
be most careful in his private life and that such a leader's reputation should be
above reproach. I also noted that these rumors regarding King were prevelant
outside the FBL. a“

Reverend Abernathy said there had been some problems in the past;
that when Reverend King goes to make a speech people always want to hold a little
party or reception for him and that there is alcohol at these parties. Abernathy
said as a Baptist minister King does not participate in drinking affairs but some-
times it is hard to avoid attending receptions where drinking does go on.

7 7
Reverend Young said that he was deeply concerned about irresponsible
usage of personal information on the part of scandalmongers and wondered if there
‘ould be any "leaks" from the Government. He was assured that there were no leaks
om the FBI, that the Director ran a tight organization and that any irresponsibility
jon the part of any Agent would not be tolerated. Young said he did not feel the F5I
Was responsible and said that just the other day King had received a letter vhich
brought up the "female question, and added they have been getting 8 or 10 bad letters

Re: Martin Luther King, Jr. 7 Erith

Here again he was asked why he was telling | us this and Young replied
that they were worried and concerned, that maybe they were overly concerned, but
that it seemed the campaign against King had been stepped up since he had received
the Nobel Prize. Young spoke about constant threats to ruin King and threats on
King's life. He was told that if any threats were made which would come within the |
FBI's investigative authority, the full facts shouti be made available ibaa ta so that
the matter could be thoroughly run out and investigated.

7 Reverend Abernathy brought up the fact again that all meh make 7
mistakes and blunders but that King had become the symbol of nonviolence and that
it would be tragic for both the North and South if King should be ruined and if some
demagogue like Malcolm X would move in and take over the civil rights movement. _ _.
He said it would be tragic if Dr. King were destroyed. He was asked if there was
vulnerability on Dr. King's part or if he was being blackmailed. He said that every-
body has skeletons in their closets and he said that Dr. King was really a moral
person, that he had a deep love for all of mankind--I refrained from commenting
here-tand that King was very moral and that in the last year Dr. King hadbeen -— .

esvecially careful to avoid anv actions which could be misconstrued by racists and
riers out to destroy King.

Reverend Young tried to get “down to brass tacks" but was unable
todo so. He spoke of the changing sex standards in the country, talked in general
terms about people being tempted and making bad judgments and spoke about the
spiritual nature of their movement and the fact that God uses "frail vessels" in
carrying out His precepts, knowing full well the weaknesses of men. I asked him,
asa minister of God, if he condoned sex degeneracy. He replied that people have
different. standards and different ideas as to what the sex norm is.

I made a final attempt to pin down the precise nature of their problem
but neither man would come out with any specifics--only statements that "they" were
|} trying to ruin King and the.civil rights movement and that this would be tragic for
'1| the whole country. Both ministers said they knew and appreciated the fact that the
|} FBI would not be 2 party to vilification of King and I said this was true, and that
| | while we naturally were aware of rumors concerning immorality on King's ae
we had no cause to look into such matters. Ee,
| Reverend Abernathy Said he wanted to be very frank and eauied to
 |{ raise a question as to whether some Agents might overstep their authority in the Sout!
and might engage in actions which were not known to FBI Headquarters. I
émphasized this was absolutely impossible, that our Agents carried a very heavy
jase load, that we knew what our Agents were doing at all times and always knew

Both visitors said, of course, they accepted and imew this to be
la fact. They mentioned one incident of a Georgia Bureau of Investigation man
checking on one of their meetings. They also mentioned the possibility that aditeed
_ jinvestigaters may have been hired to probe their activities.

They said they had no other problems and I assured them that they
should always feel free to call on us if anything should occur within our investigative
authority. Both ministers agreed to do so and added they appreciated the
opportunity of stopping by. 7

OBSERVATIONS : : Hee

Because of Olds’ close association with Shriver, it woul
not appear to be prudent to attempt to deal with him. It poeta
from our study that Senator Sal tonstall is the most logical indi-
viduel to deal with and that if he were personally approached by
4ssistant Director DeLoach and orally briefed, in the strictest of
confidence, concerning King, he would be in a position to take the
necessary action to prevent King | from receiving an honorary degree

from Springfield College. ii

TR ow

RECOMMENDATION =

If approved, DeLoach should personally orally brief
Senator Saltonstall in accordance with the attached “Top Secret”
- Summary indicating King’s communist connections and degenerate
make-up. (This is the same summary we previously used in the
Marquette University situation). It should be made clear to
Saltonstall that the information is being given him in the stricte.
ef confidence with the thought that he might desire to use it in
preventing King from receiving an honorary degree from Springfield
} College and thus save that institution from embarrassment because
of King’s connections and eharacter. It should be emphasized to
Saltonstall that under no circumstances may this information ever _
be attributed to the Bureau.

OPSERVATIONS: From the above, it is apparent that King is
in dire jicca of funds. Secondly, he dislikes going to
HOffa because of Hoffa's unsavory reputation, King
undoubtedly feels that this association might reflect
unfavorably upon’ his public image. On the other hand,
it would appear Hoffa might be concerned with the white
backlash within his own union ranks shovld it become
known that union funds may be expended to promote Negro
objectives, It is therefore felt that both men have
just rezson for keeping this meeting secret. Any
publicity concerning it would probably. be perenen et
embarrassing to both parties. 7 SRenpanana
: It would appear that the meeting may fe virtually
spontaneous and time in this instance could be very critical.

§ RUCOMMENDATION: A Bureau official be designated now to

Ciarence Jones, a former member of the Labor Youth Leneue,

to Martin Luther King, Jr., President, Southern Christian
, Leadership Conference, was in contact with Paul,O'Dvyer,
New York City attorney and brother of former Wew York City A
Mavor William O’Dvyer, Jones wanted O'Dwyer to arranze a Zi
meeting between King and James Hoffa, President, sntor- eae
national Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Narehousemen“?
and Helpers Union. Jones advised thet King is very sensitive’
regarding this meeting and docs not want any publicity con~
cerning it. If a meeting could be arranged, King, accompanied
by Jones, would be willing to meet Hoffa at "Hoffa ts convenicnuee.
“~O'Dwyer promised to help arrange this meeting. Hoffa's
* previous record of freevheeling with union funds would
indicate a reluctance on his part to pour union funds into the
civil rights movement; a move which would accrue no direct
“benefit to him individuelly.’ This appears bormotut by his

“fat he had a speech scheduled at Howard University this evening.

Ort.

We alerted Julian Morrison, a very iriendly reporter with
the Washington News, and Sid Epstein of The Star regarding King's
arrival time in Washingicn. The reporters cornered King as he came
off the plune and quizzed him about the meeting with Hoffa. King at
“first told the reporters that the meeting had been cancelled and he seemed
3 to be flustered at the reporters’ appearance. He then ducked into a
imens' room. at the airport with his aides and upon emerging told
the reporters that there had been discussion regarding his meeting Hoffa
but that he had no further comment at this time, and he had decided to
hold a press conference later on this afternoon at the Statler Hotel.
King then left the airport with Clarence Jones who had come down earlier ,
from New Yorl:, and with an attorney with Jones by the name of Philip | fi

Proposed Meeting with James R. Hoffa 11/9/66

~

: Morrison pressed him for details and Young.said that the
| proposed purpose of this meeting had been misinterpreted." He said
King had wanted to have an off-the-record discussion with Hoffa regarding
the problems of the Negroes in the Teamsters and Young claimed that
King's outfit had worked closely with the Teamsters in Atlanta and
Chicago and they felt it was time for them to meet the Teamster head.
Young said it was difficult for King to have a private conversation with
anyone in view of his prominence and reiterated that the whole matter
had been "misinterpreted and distorted. Reporter Morrison continued
h to press Young and Young finally acknowledged that King might try to
have a meeting with Hoffa at some other time,

Morrison advises that The News will carry a picture tomorrow
; or ee arriving in town, together wiih the iniormuiion sei oui above.
- The Star is also going to report this meeting.

it is felt that our counterintelligence aim to thwart King
in receiving money from the Teamsters has been quite successful to date,

‘King's palliating and ambiguous position on the
issue is difficult to understand or justify. Those whe cry

“black power” have continually claimed it has been mis=-
understood and misdefined. But the record is clear that
4t stands for open advocacy of violence, insistence on an
all-Negro organizational structure in civil rights groups,
and reverse racien.

7 _- &t 4s equally clear that these things are direct

: contradictions of the principles underlying the lezgitinate
civil ‘rights movenent: a nonviolent approach, combined’
Negro-white action, and the elinination of racisz.

: The great American tragedy of our time would be
the fatlure of Martin Luther King, Jr., to meet the current
challenge which "black power” represents to the civil rights |
movement. His failure to do so would mean that for some
reason King is willing to let the legitimate civil rights
movenent die. This, in turn, vould seem to indicate that
Eing's goal is different than that of Wilkins, Randolph and
Young. :
It appears that Eing’s decision to straddle the

fence on the issue of “biack power” was a carefully
calculated one. The Atlanta Journal” of October 13, 1965,
‘reported that King, as head of the Southern Christian 7
Leadership Conference (SCLC), was having an important meeting
with his advisors, Undoubtedly the move Wilkins, Randolph
and Young proposed to make through the 4ssuance of public
statenent was known to King and he was seeking advice on ;
what his stand should bo,

Hy memorandum to you of 10/25/66 reflected aes

Bugas, relative to confidentially advising hin that TicGeorze puny,
President, Ford Foundation, had contacted clartin Luther King .,

offering a grant of $3,090,000 to the Southern Christian Leadership

Conference (SCLC). +o oi Bugas was grateful for the information I. “

ur, Bugas called me back at 11:30 this morning. He stat ed
he, had conta ected Bundy and had asked hin for an appointment within ~-
the next several days. Bundy asked why he wanted to see him. % * ™“
Buzgas replicd he was in receipt of information concerning theN YS ..
fact that the Ford Foundation .-- wanted to have dealings with the- >
SCLC. Bundy asked for the source of his information, Bugas told
hin his source did not want to be divulged. Eundy stated under
the circumstances he would refuse to talk to Eugas and would —
Fdiscuss the matter only with the source. Bundy then asked if
the source was the FBI. Bugas refused to reveal the source and A
the conversation was terminated. Mh

Bugas stated he thought Bundy had been rather high-handed
in the ccnversation; however, he wanted to request that the
Director give serious consideration to an FBI representative
contacting Bundy, inasmuch as this matter represents one of
great inportance to the Ford Motor Company. Bugas indicated his

ycoupany had had quite a number of “hard blows" from the Ford

Mr. Tolson Stsraiassesna

“ I told Bugas that, in view of Bundy's attitude, it appearec
jrather doubtful concerning the adviszbility of our going further
in this matter. BugasS stated he realized this; however, he wasteé
to express again the importance of this matter to the Ford wotor
Company. He stated he did not know Bundy; however, Bundy had
apparently been rather snobbish in dealing with the Ford people.
He explainec that when Bundy first took this job, Bundy had beez
invited to Detroit to meet Henry Ford III and the top peopie oz

. the company. At that time Bundy was point-blank advised that he
should be careful in administering the Ford Foundation, inasmuch
as this Foundation had caused serious harm to the sales of the Fore

Motor Company. Bundy allegedly stuck his nose in the air and
tstated "I have a soci2l responsibility to fulfill."

Mr. Bugas once again stated that any liaison between the
\Ford Foundation and Yartin Luther King would “set his company beck
to bent belt. Be eeved sarin that we sonsider enntacting Bundy
directly and stated he would appreciate knowing of any ection
taken in this regard.

ACTION:

I personally feel that Bundy is of the psuedo-intellectzal,
Ivy’ League group-that has little respect for the FBI. He was
friendly on the surface while at the White House and I met hin
frequently. Under the circumstances, it appears rather goubtizt
that contact with him by the FSI will convince him cne way or
another, It is, therefore, recommended that I advise Hr. Bugas
that, while we appreciate his concern, there is some doubt that
contact by us with Bundy would amount to anything. It will be
Suggested to him that he might desire to bring this matter to
tir, Henry Ford's attention, in the event Ur. Ford desires to atte=st
to exercise any control over Bundy. Mr. Bugas, during our
Conversation, noted that Mr. Ford was out of the country at the
present time. ‘ cr

Hing “met his Waterloo” and that he felt this sumfer would do the
trick. He stated this, of course, denended upon whether ox not the
Presigent would allow sufficient force to “knock King down."

° Senator Byrd asked me if the FBI could prepare 2a speech
on the subject of Kinz which ‘he could give on the Senate
ext week. He stated thereafter he would like to be kept up
to daze on the activities of King so that further speeches could be
Imade.. He reminded me that he was a great supporter of wir. Hoover and
the Y5I.. He reiterated his responsibilities in connection with the
D.C. Government and told me that, while other senators’ande congressmen
were aiding and abetting the alleged civil rights cause, he had con~ *

COMMUNIST. INFILTRATION OF
INTERNAL SECURITY ~ COMMUNIST

By memorandum in captioned matter dated 10/17/67

: (attached), our Atlanta Office advised of information

received from a confidential source 10/16/67 to the effect

that the Department of Labor was negotiating a contract

with Martin Luther King’s Southern Christian Leadership
Conference (SCLC) in theemount of $57 2000 to train Negroes

in the Atlanta, Georgia, area for en ployment.” The Director
approved the furnishing of such information to the Secretary

of Labor together with a copy of the "Top Secret" document
entitled "Communist Influence in Racial Matters~-A Current
Analysis" dated 4/10/67, the latter for the Secretary's
confidential information. This document set forth in detail

the extent of communist influence within the SCLC and “Hing's :
involvement with such elements and his ursavory moral backgrourd.

Mr. James J. Reynolds, Undersecretary of Labor,
was contacted by Liaison 10/23/87 and furnishec a copy of
the Atlanta memorandum mentioned above together with the
"Top Secret" document.. Reynolds was asked whether or not
Labor was, in fact, negotiating such a contract with the
SCLC and he responded that he would immediately look inte
this and advise the Bureau.

4

Nx. Reynolds recontacted taboBLore5/67 at which
time he advised that the Community Action Group, Atlanta,
Georgia, had, in fact, recently’negotiated a contract with
the SCLC in the amount of $61,000 such contract to provide
for on-the-job-training for Negroes with retail grocers.
Reynolds explained that while this contract was between the
Community Action Group and.SCLC, it had, in fact, -been aed
approved by the Labor Department. The Amount of the grant
was $61,000, $13,000 of which would go to the SCLC:for'' “7
administering the program and $48,000 to the grocers for
on-the-job. training. Reynolds stated that King had set up-
the program by contacting grocers and getting assurance that

Memorandum to Mr. W. C. Sullivan
RE: SOUTHERN CHRISTIAN “LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE

Reynolds advised that upon receipt of the
information provided by the Bureau and ascertaining
that suck a contract was in effect, he immediately conferred
with Secretary of Labor W, Willard Wirtz. Both agreed vy i.
that there was no way_at_this time that the contract couia

| ‘be. gracefully « canceled without causing severe and embarrassing
repercussions. He stated, however, that in view of the
information received, both he and the Secretary are in
agreenent that_steps will be taken to. insure that no
further | contracts will “be. ‘awarded to King's group.

Reynolds stated that both he and the Secretary
appreciated very, much the Director's bringing this infor-
mation to their attention. - Reynolds stated that he had

|| beara of King’s imaorality and sex escapades but did not
realize the extent to which he was under communist influence.
He conjectured that this possibly explains King's recent
‘anti-Vietnam campaign. He remarked that he had considered
King an opportunist motivated by financial considerations
but now he could only conclude that communist elements were,
‘ito a large extent, “calling the shots" for King.

The sensitive nature of the information furnished
was emphasized with bir. Reynolds. 7

Sponsored by the Davenport Chapter of the Catholic Interracial

- You will recall that in August, 1964, we recommended,
- and the Director approved, that Francis Gardinal Spellman be
orally briefed concerning King's communist connections and
moral degeneracy so that such information could be passed on
to the Pope as it was anticipated that King would seek an
audience with the Pope. Such briefing of the Cardinal subsequent:
was made by Assistant Director Malone in New York City.

It is shocking indeed that King continues to be
honored by religious groups. Inasmuch as commitments have
a H ' apparently been made by the CIC for the award in Davenport,
. 12g j there is little likelihood that anything can be done in this
instance to prevent such an award. it is believed, however,
that it would be desirable to have Assistant Director Malone
a recontact Cardinal Spellman and bring to his attention the

| information we contsnue to receive about King being given
| honors by Catholic groups, citing the Davenport CIC award as

a current instance. It could be tactfully suggested that in

the end it might well be embarrassing to the Catholic Church for
having given honors to King. A discussion with the Cardinal

might well suggest to him the desirability for the Cardinal

to initiate such action as he deems appropriate, through church
circles, to alert Catholic institutions and organizations concernir
King. It would appear that the Cardinal would certainly be

appreciative for the information we are giving Ame. £ fae a0

MARTIN LUTHER Score, oR.
SECURITY MATTER - COMMUNIST

{ty
Martin Luther King, pene is 22S) the leading digucé
dn the civil rights movement in this country today. He is of
- wital interest to us because of the communist influences upon
i him. His actions arid expressions (both private and public) are
-of importance in several different areas of the Bureau's
operations such.as relating to the communist influences in
racial matters, racial matters generally, civil rights matters,
and the like. Because of King's position, we must be, in many
respects, extremely guarded in our efforts to gain information
concerning King's activities. King frequently travels about
the country and speaks to public gatherings. He often times
d@iscusses the future plans of himself and his organization, the
Southern Christian Leadership Conference. It is well, therefore,
to avail ourselves of the coverage which may be given -King
through a review of news media, sources and through contact with
established reliable sources.

My,

We recently received information divulging a series
of King's appointments for the period 1/20/65 through 6/19/65,
These include many public gatherings such as at universities and
colleges, churches, and the like. We are, therefore, recommending
a letter to the appropriate offices instructing that they report
information available from news media and established sources
concerning King's appearances in their respective territories.
By receiving letterhead memoranda with such information, we
are also able to make prompt dissemination to such interested
oor agencies as the Department and the military Antelligence.

RECOMMENDATION: ” REC.g fe UGE a
Attached for approval is a es tter a the appropriate

offices covering the territories in which King is scheduled to
travel. $

This morning Mr. Ralph McGill, publisher of the "A
Constitution,” Atlanta, Georgia, and a long-time admirer of the Director,
Stopped by the office to dj .

McGill told me that on being advised of the facts concernfig King,
he has remained completely silent, As a result, he is being questioned
by associates in Atlanta, Georgia, as to why he is not speaking out in
favor of King and why he is not taking an active part in the banquet
to be given King next Wednesday night. McGillisaid that he -would never
disclose a confidence and, therefore, his only reply is that he no

‘ %onger is an admirer of Martin Luther King. Further, he has talked

ith some other men who have told him of their knowledge of'King's ©
mmorality and their concern about it. In view of this, he is free

f to speak a little bit more in detail and says he has done so for it
can be attributed to the men with whom he kas Spoken.

| : McGill said that these men are Adiai/ Stevenson, Ralph Bunche, :‘
and Harry|Ashmore of the"Arkansas Gazette." He told me that Adlai

Stevenson\advised him without being questioned about King that he is'~
aware of fing? %s immoral activities. Stevenson told McGill that he
considers King to be 2 "very dangerous man" to the civil rights movement
and that something should be done about it. Ralph Bunche told McGill
that he has never been an admirer of King's although he thinks King

has done some good things; that a few months ago he began hearing very
disturbing ‘stories about King’s immoral behavior. Bunche believes that
King should be maneuvered out of the civil rights field or else he

will do it serious damage, Mr. Ashmore , likewise, informed McGill that
he had heard some time’ago about King’s incredibly immoral activities,
Ashmore is very disturbed over it and wishes something could be done

but he has no specific course to recommend, jbo- /0 66 0- 7H ;

Mr. McGill told me that following my first discussion with him
a few weeks ago he contacted a banker friend in Atlanta who was helping
to finance the banquet to be given King next Wednesday night. The
banker was disturbed and said he would contact some other bankers also

involved and see if support could be quietly withdrawn. McGill's
friend and some of the bankers did take steps to withdraw but this was

| {very quickly relayed to bankers in Haiti who were on the threshold

of an important financial deal with the Atlanta, Georgia, bankers.
They took the position that if the Atlanta bankers did not support the
Martin Luther-King party, their financial deal with these Georgia
bankers was off. AS McGill said to me, the almighty dollar is still
extremely important and especially so with bankers, and as a result they
got cold feet and decided to go ahead with financing King's party.

McGill told me that Archbishoy Hallinan, Catholic leader in
Georgia, an Episcopal clergyman and a Jewish rabbi are also quite active
in support of this party for King. He said that he is certain that not
one of these three is aware of King's immoral behavior. I told him
that in view of what Stevenson, Bunche, and Ashmore had told him, he
might want to explore very confidentially and discreetly the subject
matter with these three men, He said he would do this.

! McGill told me that he thinks it is too late now, especially in
‘Lew of the financial interest of the Georgia bankers in the Haiti deal,
.o prevent the banquet from taking place. However, McGill said he
sould do what he could to encourage key people to limit their praise

{ and support of King as mech as possible,

to get key Negro leaders to unite in opposition to King and to gradually

McGill also told me that he is taking paaee through RalphBunche
force him out of the civil rights movement if at all possible,

three things-- (1) that from diverse sources he has learned of the
incredibly immoral: behavior of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and his
deceiving of sincere, good people in this Nation who have been supportin.
King;@)that he regrets greatly that the banquet is being given in King's
honor next week in Atlanta but that it has gone so far that it is
probably not possible to head it off; and (3) that he believes that the
very best thing that could happen would be to have King step completely
out of the civil rights movement and public life for he feels that if
this is not done, sooner’ or later King will be publicly exposed and this
will do irreparable harm to the civil rights movement in which he,
McGill and others are so interested and have worked so hard for, and
likewise, it will do injury to different citizens of the country who
have been eee King not knowing that he is of such low moral
character,

| Mr. McGill said that he would like to have President Johnson know

Memorandum to lr. Belmont
Re: MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.

Mr. McGill said that if he had had time to see President
Johnson before leaving Washington, he would have told him these
three things, but that he wanted the Director to know that he is
free to quote him on these three points to the President and free
to put all three things in any communication that goes to the
White House from the Bureau,

It is very refreshing to meet 2 man of McGill's stature in
the field of journalism who is so sincere and honest and desirous
of doing the right thing. He is a very admirable man. Repeatedly,
Mr. McGill told me that he will continue to stay with this problen
and to think about it, hoping that he will devise some plan or
course of action that will help to take King out of public life,
McGill told me in a visibly disturbed manner that this problem
centering around King has caused him to wake up at night from time
to time and he is very upset over it, McGill explained that while
he has never been close to King or an active supporter thereof, he
has been completely identified and very active in furthering civil
rights and better conditions for the Negroes. He thinks that King's
||] behavior now known to him when publicly exposed will do irreparable
;{damage to such social causes a he and others have been Sponsoring
_ [throughout a lifetime,

RECOMMENDATION ¢

Enclosed will be found a letter to the White House setting
forth McGill's discussion for approval and forwarding. Inasmuch as
NeGill mentioned only the President’s getting this information, we"
do not contemplate any further dissemination. 5

Reverend Abernathy expressed the appreciation of the Negro race for the Director's

particularly in the South, and, therefore, had requested a discussion with the Director
at the very time their people were continuing to “rise up from their bondage. Lu ‘

Reverend King stated he personally appreciated the great work of the FE
which had lun done in so many instances. He stated this was particularly true in
Mississippi. He added that FBI developments in that State have been very significant.
The FBI is s great restraining influence, Reverend King denied that he had ever statec
that Negroau should’ not report information to the FBI He said he had actually encoura
Such reporling in many instances. He claimed there were good relationships in many
communiticn, especially Atlanta, Georgia, between Negrocs and the FBL He stated he
Would continue to strongly urge all of his people to work closely with the FBL

Reverend King stated he has never made any personal attack upon
Mr, Hoover, He stated he had merely tried to articulate the feelings of the Negroes in
the South in order to keep a tradition of nonviolence rather than violence. He added tha

ies Negro should never be transferred from a policy of nonviolence to one of violence ai
TOT. i

i Reverend King said that the Director's report to the President this sumn.

¢

Reverend King advised that Negroes are currently labcring under 2 very
fzystrating situation, He stated that, ‘We sometimes are on the verge of temporary

rpair." Iw added that it was a challenge and a duty for him to keep the Negro from
coming to a Iwiling point, He stated that sometimes the cries coming from the Negro
represent a rwal feeling of lonesomeness and despair, He, however, has pointed cut th:
the path to Success is nonviolence rather than violence,

Reverend King stated he has been, and still is, very concerned regardinz
e matter of communism in the civil rights movement, He stated he knew that the
Director was very concerned because he bore the responsibility of security in the Natic.
Reverend Kin: stated that from a strong philosophical point of view he could never teco:
communist inasmuch as he recdmizes this to be a crippling totalitarian disease. He
tated that ax 2 Christian he could never accept communism, He claimed that when he
learns of the identity of al communist in his midst he immediately deals with the problen.

* Martin Luther King, Appointment With Director, 3:35 p,m., 12-1-64 :

: The Director told King and his associates that the FBI shares the same
lespatr which the Negroes suffer when Negro leaders refused to accept the deep
esponsibility they have in the civil rights movement. He stated that when Negroes are
couraged not to cooperate with the FBI this sometimes frustrates or delays successful
olution of investigations. The Director told King that he had personally gone to
ississippi to meet with Governor Paul Johnson inasmuch as there had been practically
liaison between the Department of Justice, the President and the State of Mississippi
orehand, The Director stated that upon meeting Governor Johnson the Governor
plained honestly that he was a segregationist, however,abhorred violence. The
irector stated that he had told Governor Johnson they haa a common meeting ground
much as he was in Mississippi to put an end to violence and brutality. The Director
id Governor Johnson that he would like to do this in colleboration with the State Police,
ever, if the FBI could not receive such cooperation we would do it on our own, The
Director then made reference to watermoccasins, rattlesnakes and redneck sheriffs, in
hat order, who still exist in Mississippi who represent the trashy type of characters wh:
e promoting civil rights violations, The Director told King thet we had trained twenty
presentatives of the Mississippi State Highway Patrol and that this had represented a
rood move to promote better cooperation and solution of civil rights cases,

(2) The Director told Reverend King that the FE! had put the ‘fear of God" in
lhe Ku Klux Klan (KKK). He told King that’we knew of the identity of the murderers of
he three civil rights workers and that these murderers wc1ld scon be brought to trial.
Pap Director then spoke of the terror in Mississippi bacicvoods and of the fact that
heriffs and deputy sheriffs participate in crimes of violence, He summarized by telling
King that we, therefore, are under the same strain that sincere Negro leaders are under
‘he. Director added that the KKK constar.tly damns the FZI and thet we have currently

en classified as the "Federal Bureau of Integration" in Mississippi,

The Director told King that many cases, which have been brought about as
i result of FBI investigation, must be tried in State Court, He spoke of the difficulty in
obtaining a verdict of guilty in instances in which white jurics are impaneled in cases
involving white men. The Director spoke of the KIXK invclyement in the Lemuel Penn ca
just outside of Athens, Georgia, He stated this was an outragecus miscarriage of justic:
in that the defendants, despite the open and shut eence on the part of the FBI, had been
acquitted, :

‘The Director made it clear to Reverend King and his associates that the
FBI could not state whether a conviction would be obtained or not in the case involving th
murdered three civil rights victims. He stated, however, that the FBI has excellent
evidence in this case. The Director then explained that it was most necessary for the
Co ant to “jump the gun” unless we had sufficient evidence in which a case cowd me

Martin Luther King, Appointment With bela aed 3:35 p.m. ni2-1-64

The Director made reference to Reverend King’s allegation that the FBI
leals or associates with law enforcement officers who have been involved in civil rights
jolations. He stated emphatically that, "I'll be damned if the FBI has associated with .
ny of these people nor will we be associated with them in the future.“* The Director ~
xplained that the FBI, not only because of the very nature of the law but also because of
he background of our investigative employees, was in full sympathy with the sincere
sspects of the civit rights movement. He stated that the FBI constantly needs cooperatic
ind asSistance in order to solve cases. He added that he made it a point, several years
igo, to transfer northern Special Agents to southern offices, He stated that, for the mo:
vart, northern-born Agents are assigned civil rights cases in the South. The Director
tdded that he feels that our Special Agents, regardless of where they are born, will
nvestigate a case impartially and thoroughly. He mentioned, however, that it was unfai
9 the Agent and the FBI to “have a strike against him" in that critcism had been leveied
rver the fact that southern Agents would not give Negroes a “fair shake," The Director
stated that such criticism was entirely unjustifiable and that no case had ever been brou;
‘© our attention proving such a fact, A

’ The Director made reference to the recent case in McComb, " Mississippi,
n which nine men had been charged with burning churches and violence against Negroes,
opted this again was a miscarriage of justice. He added that the judge's decision ik

2vasing the defendants because they had learned their lesson and were merely youths

vas entirely wrong and that it caused some people to question where youth really began,
ie explained that some of the defendants had been in their 40's, The Director added tha
: deal probably, of course, had been made, however, this would certainly not represent
any deterrent to future actions of violence by these men. ~

The Director explained that there is a great misunderstanding today amo..
the general public and particularly the Negro race as to what the FBI can and cannot do
in the way of investigations, The Director emphasized that the FBI cannot recommend
drosecution or declination of prosecution, He stated that Agents cannot make *on the sp
irrests. He stated that the FBI merely investigates and then the Department of Justice
Jetermines whether prosecution be entertained or not, The Director added that the
question is sometimes raised why prosecution is not scheduled sooner. He stated this,
of course, was not the responsibility of the FBI in any way whatsoever. He pointed out
hat our civil rights investigations are conducted in a very thorough and expeditious .
manner once the Department has authorized such investigations,

The Director spoke of the FBI's successful penetration of the KKK, He
stated that the FBI has interviewed all members of the KKK in Mississippi and nas
served notice to these members that if trouble occurs we plan to come to them first. H
stated our penetration of the KKK has been as successful as the manner in which we

trated the communists and the Soviet espionage services, He statel that our progr
in infiltrating the IKK has been so rapid that Klan members now suspect each other anc
are fighting among themselves, The Director mentioned that we have two confessions ¢

the killing of t! i ghts workers, He added that the Klan in Mississippi has
fan 62486-Dosld he shinee gi yi sfishts wo the memhere of this orranization are apprehensi7:

os to the identity of FBI informants in their midst. The Director stated he had s personal
en an enemy of the KKK for a long time.

He spoke of the FBI's case in Louisiana in the late 1920's in which FBI
idence suocessfully culminated in the conviction of the top Klan leader. He stated the
fully concentrated on Negroes, Jews and Catholics, however, concentration now

strictly on the Negro race. |

7 The Director told the group that in the Lemuel nae case the defendants
ve recently been indicted and are to stand trial in Federal Court. He stated the trial
ould begin sometime next week, He mentioned that the same defendants were
esponsible for beating Negroes and participation in other acts of violence. The Directo
d that the FBI's success in infiltrating the KKK has been so extensive that we now --
Ometimes know in advance what the KKK plans to do and take preventive measures
cordingly. i 7
The Director explained that in Alabama the FBI cannot deal withthe _
Bigheay ®atrol because of the psychoneurotic tendencies of the Alabama Governor. He
tated that the State of Georgia has a good Governor and that the Georgia Bureau of
sstigation, while not comparable to the Mississippi Highway Patrol, has cecperated
‘Se the FBL,
: The Director told Reverend King and his associates that FBI
representatives have held several thousand law enforcement conferences in which _
southern police officers have been educated as to civil rights legislation. He siated this
aas clearly assisted law enforcement, particularly the FBI, however, adinittedly, this
represents slow progress, but progress nevertheless, He added that this educational
campaign will be continued and that it will eventually take hold, The Director gave the
>xample of a Mississippi Sheriff who recently broke a case as a result of FBI training.

7 Mi r

The Director made it very clear to Reverend King and his associates that
FBI Agents conduct very thorough interviews in civil rights cases, He stated he would
ike to know immediately if any of our Special Agents ever act in a supercilious manner
or if they mishandle a comp:aint regarding civil rights, He stated that if the facts
reflect that our Agent is in the wrong he will be called on the carpet fast. The Director”
asked that Reverend King or any of his representatives feel free to call the FBI at any
ime they have such complaints, > 4 anaes

“The Director told Reverend King he desired to give him some advice. He
stated that one of the greatest things the Negro leaders could accomplish would be to
2ncourage voting registration among their people. Another thing would be to ecucate the
ee in the skills so that they could compete in the open market, The Director
nentioned several professions in which Negroes could easily learn skills, The Director
uso told King he wanted him to know that registrars in the South were now more careful
inNWh88486, Doel 32999795. Page6V.0t there were less attempts now to prevent Negroes from

registering inasmuch as the FBI is watching such actions very carefully, The Director
told Reverend King that the FBI was making progress in violations regarding
discrimination in eating places, He gave 2s a specific example a restaurant in Atlanta,
Georgia, in which surveillances have taken place to ascertain if out-of-state cars are
being served at this particular resaurant, The Director stated he personally was in
favor of equality in eating places and in schools, He stated emphatically, however, he
lwas not in favor of taking Negro children 10 or 12 miles across town simply because
their parents wanted them to go to a school other than those in their specific
neighborhood, -

The Director told Reverend Hing that in due time there will be a complet
change in the mores of community thinking in the United States regarding the racial
Iproblem, He stated that meanwhile the PC? will continue to handle its responsibilities
in 2 thorough and impartial manner. He reiierte? that the FBI cannot encourage
lprosecution in Federal Court despite the fact that ssrelocal couriscannot be trusted, He
ladded that some judges cannot be trusted. 7 :

ts The Director praised the Georgia px:
(Penn case tobe a travesty of justice. We added
J contained several editorials deploring +vfolen
7irch burnings. The same editorials was no way to solve racial
roblems. The Director stated that his s¢ reade at a press conference in
lackson, Mississippi, this summer to the <fiect th nt he was in Mississippi to see to it

an end was put to the violence of bombings and burning churches had had some affec
ipon backwoods terrorists,

re that declared the verdict of the

The Director told King that :c wanted to make it very clear that the
uestion is often raised as to whether the FDI wil! protect civil rights workers or Negrc
e stated that he has in the past and will costime to answer such questions on the basis
at the FBI does not have the authority nor the jarisdiction to protect anyone. He state
at when the Department of Justice desires that Hcgroes be protected this is the
esponsibility of U. S, Marshals, The Director reiterated that the FBI is strictly an
vestigative agency and cannot and will not oxtend itself beyond legislated jurisdicticn.

e Director rgpeated very emphatically ti.at while our investigations are very definite!

orough and impartial he wanted to state once again that if Reverend King or any cf his
associates ever knew of a Special Agent patie bias or prejudice he wanted to know
about this matter immediately. fiery

The Director explained thet we have civil rights cases ee ae in the
South but also in the northern cities. He gave examples of New York and Chicago. He

The Director spoke once again of the necessity of the Negro pore 7
imself in order to compete in manual and professional skills, He mentioned the °
xample of a shoeshine boy in Miami, Florida, who turned out to be, after questioning

y the Director, a graduate of Howard University. This shoeshine boy, a Negro,
xplained to the Director that he could not get a job above the level of shoeshine boy
ecause of the color of his skin, The Director stated this, of course, was wrong and

iat under no circumstances did he, -or anyone in the FBI, share the opinion that the
egro, or any othér race, should be kept down, The Director spoke of his pride in -
egro Agents and particularly mentioned Special Agent Aubrey Lewis, the former

otre Dame track star who is currently assigned to the New York Division,

: The Director spoke of a Miami Special Agent who was transferred to that
ffice from St. Louis, This Agent explained to the Director on one occasion that he was
rst a little upset about being transferred to Miami because he felt that his race would -
2 against him, He stated, however, much to his surprise, that the white people in ~
iami treated him with the greatest of courtesy while people of his own race referred to
mas a‘fink" simply because he was a representative of law enforcement, :

' Reverend King interrupted the Director at this point and asked if this same
egro Agent is still assigned to the Miami Division. The Director replied in the
Ganative. The Director stated that at a recent dinner Father Hesburgh, the President

mutre Dame University, explained to the Director that his institution had difficulty
*tting Negroes on the football team because their grades were never high enough. The
irector told Reverend King the same thing is true of Negroes who apply for the position
Special Agent. He stated in most instances they lack the qualifications, however, we

“The Director told Reverend King and his associates that the problems that

ghts matters we have learned that “you are damned if you do and you are damned if you
n't." The Director stated nevertheless the FB! would continue to do its job. He stated
at we additionally are very proud of 10 or 11 Indian Special Agents and of a number cf

sistance of all groups and it is most unfair when these groups are taught not to

The Director mentioned that he wanted to make it very plain that the FBI

Reverend Abernathy stated that the Negroes have a real problem in
ing down the current system of segregated voting tests in the South. He stated it was
st important that there be kept alive in the Negro communities a ray of hope, He
tated that the Negro people should not be allowed to fall into an atmosphere of despair.

: The Director explained that this was a very important point. He stated
hat real progress has been made in higher wages, voting registration and housing
aatters, The Director pointed out, however, that such progress has not been
mphasized by the rabblerousers who constantly attempt to stir up the Negroes against
he whites. The Director gave as an example the communist,Epton,in New York City.
‘he Director stated that Epton is sometimes pointed to as a person the Negro should
mulate because of his militancy. The ceaeiia Stated this was wrong and itis also |
'rong to "mislead" Negroes, ,

Reverend Abcrnathy stated that the SCLC does not want Negroes like:

:pton in their movement, He stated that Reverend King, more than anyone else, has
revented people like Epton and the Muslims from taking over the civil righs movement.
‘everend Abernathy stated that actually the Negroes are a part of the Federal
‘overnment, therefore, anything that represents the Federal Government is an
ncouragement to the Negro. He added that even the side of a post office building or 2
"ederal courtroom is an encouragement to the Negro, He mentioned that when a Negro
eceives information that a case in which he has been brutally mistreated is going to
‘ederal Court he feels encouraged over the fact that he will get a fair trial, Reverend

The Director stated that the KKK today is represented by common white

trash. He stated that the Klan was actually worse than the Communist Party inasmuch

‘as the Klan resorts to violence while the communists usually emulate termites in their
activities,

- © Whe Director reiterated that King and his associates should feel free to
call him at any time when they have knowledge of possible civil rights violations, King
replied that over the past few years he has noted amazing signs of progress in the civil
rights field, He stated he has been very surprised to see some communities comply
with the new civil rights statutes, He stated there still are some pockets of resistence
particularly in the South. He dded that the SCLC is planning to stimulate voting
registration activities in Selmo, Alabama, in the near future. He mentioned that some
Imembers of his organization have been successful in infiltrating this white community
land have learned there is a great potential for violence in Selma, BEE SEE eee eee eer eee

The Director interrupted King and briefly detailed five cases in which the
FBI has gathered evidence in S Ima, 4#labama. The Director identified these cases
fully, and specifically the case z.gainst Sheriff James Clark, The Director mentioned
that these cases came about as a result of FBI investigation and that we were continzing
our investigations in Selm2, ‘lutam2., He mentioned that one case would come to trial

December 9, 1964, The Divector particularly made reference to the fact that we hav
three excellent cases in Selma at the present time.

Reverend King inquirs2 as to whether his representatives should notify
the FBI when they arrive in Sc!ma, Alcbama. He quickly corrected himself that he ime:
his representatives should coritact the FBI upon arrival, however, he asked the Directoz
what would be the possibilities of FBi Agents being in Selma, Alabama, inasmuch as
there appeared to be a potentic! for vicience, The Director specifically asked Reveren¢
King when his activities would take plece, Reverend Abernathy indicated such activity
would take place around Janua:y 1, 1565, The Director clearly explained that FBI -
Agents would be in Selma, not for ‘the purpose of “protecting’ anyone, but for the
purpose of observing and reporting to the Department of Justice any possible violations
of civil rights that might occur. Reverend King expressed appreciation in this regard,

Reverend King stood up and stated he wished to express his personal

I fully agree that this work should eventually 1 be dous, particularly .
if an additional controversy arises with King. I See no necessity, however, in this e
work being-done at the present time inasmuch as the controversy has quieted down -
considerably and we are not in need of transcriptions right now. In view of the

representative could arrange for an interview ostensibly
to question King concerning his new book. During the
interview the above-interrelated activities could be
developed, particularly to oring out the political -
reorientation of King's major efferts in relation to
United States foreign policy as contrasted to the position
taken by other civil rights leaders who have continued to
direct their efforts at civil rights. This then could be
linked to show that King's current policies remarkably
parallel comuunist efforts. This would cause extreme
embarrassment to King. Further, it is felt that since the
position’ and paths taken by King and his group closely
parallel that advocated by the Communist Party, this fect .-
should be made known to the public.

SECURITY MATTER - C

The Attorney General was contacted at his request this after ~
noon. He had before him our memorandum of October 7, 1963, requesting c
authority for technical surveillances on Martin Luther King at his residence
at Atlanta and at the office of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.
of which he is president,at New York City. C.

The Attorney General said that he recognized the importance o’
this coverage if substantial information is to be developed concerning the
relationship between King and the Communist Party. He said there was no
question in his mind as to the coverage in New York City but that he was

Cuworried about the security oi an installation covering a residence in Atlanta,

orgia, He noted that the last thing we could afford to have would be a

iscov a of a wire tap on King's residence. Yh
a -’ J pointed out to the Attorney General the fact that a residencé LP) |
vas involved did not necessarily mean there was any added risk because of i
the technical nature of the telephone system. He was informed that the
ureau had had years of experience ih this field and that we continually
eviewed our procedures to insure that every measure possible to secure
uch installations was takeg. It was nevertheless noted that of necessity
Epc: had to deal with established contacts in the telephone company to get. the

should go ahead with the technical coverage on King ora trialtiasis, and to

that all Bureau representatives involved would recognize the delicacy of this
particular matter and would thus be even more cautious than ever in this

‘The Attorney General orally informed me today that he ‘naa ose
- considering the request he -made on July 16, 1963, for a technical surveil-
~ lance on Martin Luther King at his home and office and was now of the
opinion that this would be iN advised,
» . .

At the time the Attorney General initially asked for such a
surveillance, he was told there was considerable doubt that the
productivity of the surveillance would be worth the risk because King
travels most of the time and that there might be serious repercussions
should it ever become known the Government had instituted this coverage.
These were the very thoxchts that the Attorney General ‘expressed today

C in withdrawing his request. .

With reference to the other technical surveillance requested
at the same time, namely, the one on Clarence Benjamin Jones, the
Attorney General felt this was ina different gategory and we should go
forviard with this coverage. It is noted that this was previously approved
in writing by the Attorney General.

sentatives designed to explore how best to carry on our investigations
of captioned matter to produce the desired results without embarrass-7,

! One of the avenues explored wis that concerning any facets of the
: finaheial operations of King and the organizations through which he~
opverctes which investigation might reveal either violations of the’ ~
Oz or other potentials for discrediting King or otherwise neutralizing
fis effectiveness, Aw
: Aa
Bufiles contain two iters of particular significance, A ~ .-
Washington Capital News Service release dated 10/22/63 reveals that '
King's integration organization had an income of more than $735,000 *.
during the past fiscal year and spent only about half of it, It is a
stated that in a report of the financial status of the Southern Chris-
tion Leadership Conference (SCLC), of which King is President, King
! disclosed that the organization had a balance of $351,992.20 left
8/31/63 at the end of the fiscal year from a total income of $735,534.02
A4nother such news release gated 11/4/63 revealed that Representative
George Andrews (D-Al2,) asked the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to
investigate the tax status of the SCLC, Andrews is quoted as saying, ~
“Thousands and thousands of dollars are collected and spent each year,
by so-called civil rights organizations and many people are beginnin;

to suspect they could be a front for a full-grown racket.” Zé

It is noted that King's operations revolve principally around,

the SCLC, However, fund-raising operations on his part are further augs

NEGRO QUESTION f
COSIUNIST INFLUENCE IN RACIAL MATTERS
100-3-116 i
OPSERVATIONS: e
It 4s believed that an examination of recent income tax
returns of King might well reveal information which could assist the
Bureau in its efforts to discredit King or neutralize his effective-

ness, This is possibly spplicable also if the income tax returns of

the SCLC and the Gandhi Society were reviewed. In view of the possi-

bility that the SCLC has already been under some investigation by IRS,

& request for the results of such investigation is indicated, We 2lso

with IRS relative to tax exemptions and therefore the results of any ~~

TRS investigation of that Society would be worth procuring.

: To date we have been most discreet and circumspect in our
hendling of the King investigation, as well 2s corollary investiga-
tions such as revolving around organizations, because of the position
King has not only es a clergyzan, but also cs a “respected” Negro
yeader, It is therefore essenticl that our current requests of the
IRS which are herein being recommended be handled in a manner which

| vould provide for onptimim security so that neither Xing nor any other

iunauthorized individuals may become aware of the Bureau's interest
and so that no erbarressment may come to the Bureau, For this rezson,
the attached memoranda frre classified "Secret,"

RECOMMENDATION:

It 4s recormended that the Liaison Section obtain two
uncertified copies of each of the income tax returns available for
the past five years pertaining to King, the SCLC and the Gandhi
Society, Attached hereto are three memoranda for the use of the
Licison Section, . fh.

At a staff meeting recently, King announced
the Ford Foundation had granted his organization a quarter .
of a million dollars. King did not state how this. “money [J

OBSERVATIONS:

It is interesting to note that King's “group
will only get $250,000, a large sum, but considerably
smaller than the original amount. Perhaps our measures

Several weeks ago FORWARD TIMES
made an editorial expression which’
“gtated, among other things, that Dr. Mar-

Sin the opposite direction trom the civil

to be the spoxesman tor the ‘peaceniks’,

that poor judgement upon the entire Negro

more in-depth and complicated problems!
than can apparently be coped with, at that!
+ pont we call 1t our business.

FORWARD TIMES takes the position’
that Dr. King’s visit to Houston next
Tuesday night is an imposition upon this
community of the first order. We also
think that the fact that he is shrouding
his “remarks” behind a big name popu-

subterfuge. If Aretha Franklin, who is

- Mes. ALBERT B. (CAROL ANN): PEPPER, 2025 Bellevue,
stated her new unpublished telephone number is 645-9152.
She was interviewed on May 10, 1968, by SAs HOWARD C.
: KENNEDY and ALBERT J, RUSHING at which time she furnished
| the following information:

Mrs. PEPPER is the ‘sister of subject, JAMES EARL
RAY, but is 13 years younger than subject and in all of her
life has had very little contact or association with the
subject having seen him only aproximately three or four
times in her life. These three or four times when she has
seen him all occurred in the City of St. Louis after Mrs.
PEPPER came to St. Louis when she was 16 years old to reside
with her father. in St. Louis and all of the cccasions when. |
she saw the subject were brief encounters such as when she +:
saw him on the street. She believes the last time she saw”
the subject was probably in 1959 or earlier when. she en-
“countered him on the street in South St. Louis at which time
she was in the company of their brother, FRANK (BUZZY) RAY, ~
who is now deceased, Her first recollection of seeing him
was eee his discharge from military service.

. Mrs) PEPPER was born January 30, 1941, ‘at Ewing, -
Missouri. : She went to school. at Quincy, illinois, where...
she resided with her mother, .LUCILLE RYAN. Mrs. PEPPER 's -
.birth certificate showed her.name as RAYNES which she under~
. Stands. is an incorrect spelling of the name. of her father, armas
whose name is RAYNS and who. now resides near Center,.'. seeaan
Missouri, to which. locat%on he recently moved from St. Louis,
Missouri. Mrs, PEPPER. prior to marriage, .used the, name
CAROL RYAN; the same surname used by her mother, LUCI. LE .

RYAN, Mrs. PEPPER is unable to account for the variations
in the surnames and she is aware that..various .ones’ of, her.
brothers and sister have used the surname RAY. So far as

she knows they all had the same father although she expressed
uncertainty in that regard and she assumes that the varia- —
tions of the name are simply because her brothers and sisters
decided to use the name RAY, a variation of the name RAYNS.

When Mrs. PEPPER was 16 years of age, she left
her mother's residence in Quincy and-came to St. Louis where
she lived with her father at 1727 South llth Street. She did

not attend school after she moved to St; Louis but had varicus
jobs including a period of employment at Kresge's, a dime
store, located on Delmar Boulevard, University City, Missouri,
no longer in existence. She is not now employed. Her last
employment having been by the Catholic Archdiocese in St. Louis
as a teacher in the Head Start Program which was conducted at
St. Joseph's School on South 12th Street in St. Louis. The
later employment was for a period of about one year during the
- latter’ part of the residence of Mr. and Mrs. PEPPER at 7l2a
Shenandoah, St. Louis, from which address they moved to their a
present address in the Maplewood in about Sey 1967.

"Sometime after Mrs. PEPPER came to St. Louis at the
age of 16 years to reside with her father, hermother also came
to St. Louis and resided with Mrs. PEPPER 's maternal grand=
mother, MARY MAHER, at 1913 Hickory, St. Louis. Mrs. PEPPER.
however, did not at any. time actually reside in St. Louis
with her mother, although she occasionally spent brief periods
of time with her mcher at the mother's address. After. the
death of Mrs. PEPPER's mother in early 1961, Mrs. PEPPER did.
reside for a period of a few months with her- ‘grandmother, Mrs.-
MAHER, in St. Louis, until Mrs. PEPPER was Linen in St. Louis

After subject, “ Jaates ‘EARL RAY, was arrested and. con- :
victed on the charge for which he was sent to the Missouri State ce
Penitentiary, Mrs. PEPPER has not ever seen him again on any ~ : '
occasion. For a time after he went to the penitentiary she-

did write letters to him’on behalf of her grandmother, Mrs.

MAHER and used the latters name in the léters and she con-- no
tinued this practice after the death of the grandmother in’. ut
. 1963, continuing. to use the name of Mrs. MARY MAHER, who was

an approved correspondent of subject's in the penitentiary.

Mrs. PEPPER estimates that after the death of her grandmother .

she probably wrote no more than three or four letters to the

subject at the penitentiary. She is unable to recall the 7

last such letter she -wrote to him but the last time may have

been as late as the early part of 1967. She occasionally

received a letter from subject while he was in the peniten-

tiary and believes she received no more than two or three

letters from him, Mrs. PEPPER did not ever visit subject at ; y

her husband didmt ever visit him at the penitentiary. She
advised she has understood from her husband that the latter
has never seen the subject in his life.

Urs. PEPPER has not at any time had any contact
either direct or indirect with the subject since his escape
in 1967 from the Missouri State Penitentiary. She has no
knowledge of any person who has had information regarding the.
subject's whereabouts and stated she could furnish no such
information regarding his whereabouts. She, herself, first
learned that he had escaped from the penitentiary whet she

amount of $15.00 and was sent by an inmate at the Missouri-

In response “to direct aueaee concerning this gayartee?
matter, she advised that she may have received a money order 7
on one occasion but to the best of her recollection, it was
for $2.00 or $3.00 and it may have been in payment for maga- >
zines which her brother had requested she mail to him, “It At
was her recollection that if she received a money order it
was received earlier than January, 1967. She said she never: .
at any time mailed magazines to him and doesnot recall what.

may have been for as much as $15.00 but she does not récall.
She also acknowledged that she might have cashed such a money
order but she cannot specifically remember having done so.
In this connection, she Said her. memory is very vague.

Mrs. ALBERT B, (CAROL) PEPPER was recontacted at
her residence, 2025 Bellevue, Maplewood, Missouri. She again
specifically denied that she has had any contact with her
brother, JAMES RAY, since his escape from the Missouri State
Penitentiary in April, 1967, or that ske has had any knowledge
whatever of his whereabouts since that time other than what
she has derived from the news media. Although Mrs. PEPPER
expressed her willingness and intention to notify the FBI
if she should at any time be contacted by him or if she should
receive any information regarding him she stated that she
would certainly not expect that he would contact her and she
noted in that regard that RAY would not be aware of her current
address or her new un-published teleptone number, She further
pointed out that other than their brother, JERRY RAY, who
is in the Chicago area, she believes all of the family have
moved since RAY's escape from the penitentiary and that JERRY
RAY would, therefore, be the only one whose address would
be known to JAMES RAY. 5

“With regard to the ‘grapev rine Tavern, Mrs. PEPPER
commented that the tavern kas Larely been making expenses

Mrs. ALBERT (CAROL) PEPPER, 2025 Bellevue, Maplewood,
Wisscuri, was interviewed at her residence, at which time she.
furnished the following information:

Mrs. PEPPER has received no information regarding
her brother, JAMES EARL RAY (whome she refers to as JIM),
since the last previous interview witha her by the FBI.

Within the past several days, police officers from
the St. Louis Police Department came to see Mrs. PEPPER indi-
cating to her that they had received some inquiry from a
newspaper, possibly "The Los Angeles Times" according to Mrs.
PEPPER's recollection of what they said; this inquiry having
to do with the finances of the RAY family. The police officers
apparently came to see Mrs, PEPPER just to find out some general
information about her, and they suggested to her that if people
wanted to talk to her about her finances, she might want to
obtain a lawyer. A representative of "The St. Louis Post
Dispatch" newspaper also came to see Mrs. PEPPER within the
preceding few days, but she refused to talk to him, Mrs.
PEPPER has heard from-an acquaintance that there was an article
afew days ago in "The St. Louis Post Dispatch” which seemed: .
to be a rehash of the erroneous information which appeared in

a "Life Magazine" article concerning the RAY family, but Mrs.
PEPPER herself did not read this newspaper article. :

; Mrs. PEPPER, and her family went to see her father
at center, Missouri, over the preceding weekend, May 18-19,
1968. She has been customarily going to see him there during
weekends and usually takes him groceries. She is the one in
the family who maintains contact with the father and looks
after his needs. The farm which the father bought about: six
months ago is believed to. consist of about forty acres of
which a little is probably tillable, and she thinks her father
will grow corn on this part of the farm, but the remainder is
suitable only for livestock and grazing. She thinks that he
paid some amount in the neighborhood of $2,600 for this farm.
Mrs. PEPPER is uncertain in her recollection, but believes it °
may be correct that she gave him a check drawn on her account Z
in the amount of $1,900 at the time he was purchasing this :
farm and which was applied to the purchase. If so, this money

would have been his money. Mrs. PEPPER sometimes keeps his
money in her checking account or savings acceunt, and she
thinks this may have occurred in tzis instance. On the other
hand, she may have given him such a check as @ loan, but she
is uncertain in her recoliection. Sometime before her father
purchased the farm, he sold the preperty in St. Louis which
he formerly owned at 1819 Park, this property consisting of
a two-story residential building. Mrs. PEOPER believes he
received something like $2,800 from the sale xt this property.
She believes that the $1, B00 which she may have returned to
hin in the form of her sheok represented part of the proceeds
of the sale of that property which he gave her to keep for
him in her account. In any event Mrs. PRESER is certain that
she did not herselZ pay for any part of the purchase of tke
farm by her father, and if she gave him the check for $1, 900,
this was a return of his money or a loan.

‘While Mrs, PEDPER's father resided in St. Louis
peYore the purchase of the farm at Centar, Misseuri, he had
various jobs, such as, service station attendant, and he also
at one time operated a second-hand store where he soid junk.
Tais business was also located on Park Avenue, but was some~
where east of Twelfth Street, a considerable distance from
1819 Park, Aer father did not own the Property where he con-
ducted this second-hand business.

Until Mr. and Mrs, PEPPER moved to their present |
residence in the fall of 1967, irs. PEPPER yas always employed
ever since their marriage in December of 1961. During that
| period of time, they have practiced thrift and economy and
‘have always endeavored to save something from their income.

They opened a savings account several years ago at the
Bohemian Savings and Loan Associaticn on South Bighteenth
‘Street in St. Lovis in the same area wnere they resided. A
few years ago when the Scohemian Savings and Loan Association
|waS moved to a remote section of the city, they transferred

their savings account to the Menufacturers Bank and Trust
Company, where they have continusd to have a joint savings
/account. ALBERT DEPPER has been employed fcr more than three
years by the Ace Construction and Engineering Company, which

is affilicated with the Hew Warket Hardware Stere. His earnings
in this employment is $3 per hour, and in scme weeks he works
overtime on Saturdays. irs. PEDPER'ts last employment was with

NW 68486 Docld:32989755 Page 658 pase



3 7 : i
SL 44-775

the "Head Start" School Program, and she was employed there

by the Catholic Archdiocese being paid at tke rate of $60 per
week. She had this employment for about a year until Mr. and
Mrs. PEPPER moved in the fall of 1967 to their present address.
Her last employment before that was in cleaning work at an
office building at 1615 Locust in St. Louis. Because she and
her husband have always endeavored to be economical and saving
in the handling of their family finances, they were able to
accumulate funds in their savings account. When they con-
tracted in the fall of 1967 to purchase the house where they
mow live for a purchase price of $18,560, they withdrew tke
necessary money for the downpayment fron’ their savings account.

Mrs. PEPPER has no idea and no knowledge as to whether
her father may ever have given Mrs. PEPPER's ee nens JOHN LARRY _
RAY, any funds to hold —_ her father :

"Mrs. PEPPER has no information Vaieaing atrip to —
california made by her brother, JOHN LARRY RAY, in the summer
of 1967 and never knew or heard that he made such a trip.

One of the places in St. Louis where Mrs. PEPPER
lived with her father prior to her marriage was 1727 South
Eleventh Street. She believes her brother BUZZY lived with
them there part of the time, but she is certain that her
brother JIM rever lived with them there. Mrs. PEPPER never
had any knowledge of her brother JIM having used the name
O'CONNOR, and she never knew of any bank accounts he may have
had at any bank at any time. in fact, Mrs. PEPPER had so
little contact or knowledge of her brother JIM that she can
now recall having seen him only on possibly a couple of occa~ ~
sicns when she was small and shortly after he was discharged
from military service, and she recalls seeing him on one ecca-
sion on the street in South St. Louis at some later time after
she moved to St. Louis with her father. Although Mrs. PEPPER
was known as CAROL RYAN as of 1959, she has no knowledge or. 7
recollection of having received any checks from her brother .
JIM or from any person under the name JAMES CARL O'CONNOR,
either in 1959 or any other time. She can think of no reason
why she might ever have received any suck checks. Mrs. PEPPER
is certain that she has never had any financial dealings of
any type with her brother JIM in her life.

With regaré to the matter of a mom ey order directed
from an inmate at the Missouri State Penitentiary to the Albert
Pepper Stationery Company, 712 Shenandeah, St. Louis, Mrs.
PEPPER has still been unable to remember anything further
regarding such a matter since she was previcusiy interviewed
regarding this matter, She still dces vaguely remember that
someone told her one time while be was in the penitentiary
that he wanted magazines sent to him, but she cannot remember
having sent magazines to him and-cannot recall that she was
ever reimbursed for doing so, ‘She is certain, however, that
there was never any Albert Pepper birt Company at 712
Shenandoah, ° 7 A

“Mrs. PEPPER has sc recollect’ Cored that she has ever
known of a person named Y. P, WESBE or V. P. WEBBE, and this
name is not in any way familiar or significant to her.

Mrs. ALBERT (CAROL) PEPPER, 2025 Bellevue,
Maplewood, Missouri, advised that she had received no
additional information whatever bearing on the possible.
location of her brother, JAMES EARL inte since she was last .
interviewed.

Inquiry was made of Mrs. PEPPER as to whether, in
the event she should receive some pertinent information
regarding her brother, she would furnish such information to eee
the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Mrs. PEPPER eo
then stated that she would have no expectations whatever that
her brother would communicate with her in any way, pointing
out that he did not know her current address or her current
unpublished.telephone--number.. She added that ske felt that
he ‘did not believe that he could expect any help from her and she’
said that, ag a matter of fact, she vould not be at all
interested or willing to help him as she did not want herself
and particularly her children to be in any way involved with
him, She said that if she should hear-from RAY and be convinced
of his innocence she might find it difficult to furnish such
information to the FBI. It was pointed out te Mrs. PEPPER that
in the event RAY should be innocent or there should be any
extenuating circumstances the entire matter would in any event
be most readily resolved through locating RAY at the earliest
possible time. Mrs. PEPPER expressed understanding and agree- 7
ment with this idea. ‘aan

Inquiry was made of Mrs. pEPPER | as to her anebeasouea
and activities during the period between April and July, 1967.
She said she was living at that period of time with her : ce
husband and two children at 712-a Shenandoah, St. Louis. She ~ oe
recalled that beginning in about the summer of 1966 and
ending in about July or August, 1967, she was employed as a
teacher’s aide or assistant teacher in the "Head Start Program"
at St, Joseph's School located at Twelfth and Russell Streets,
St. Louis, In-this employment she worked regularly during
that period on Monday through Fridsy, each week, during the
hours of 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 or 4:30 p.m, daily. This work
involved the teaching of children three to five years of age.
She was employed in this work by.the Catholic Archdiocese on

She was paid for her work by check from the Archdiocese,
although she understood that at least some of the funds for
the "Head Start Program" were furnished the Archdiocese by’
the Human Development Corporation, Mrs.° PEPPER recalled

: Mrs. PEPPER said ‘her first knowledge of the escape

Penitentiary was when she heard’ or read news reports regarding
the escape but she is unable to recall the approximate time
she. heard such reports. However, since reported identification

. of RAY as the alleged assassin of MARTIN LUTHER KING, Mrs.

' PEPPER has heard or read reports to the effect that his :

_ escape from the penitentiary was not officially reported or

. given publicity for perhaps several weeks after the escape
occurred. Mrs. PEPPER, therefore, assumed that she herself
would not have learned of the escape from news reports until
perhaps several weeks after the escape. - aa

1 Date __ June “, 1968
Mrs. ALBERT fae ANN) PEPPER, residing 2025 Bellevue,
Maplewood, Missouri, telephone 645-9152, who was contacted at her’
residence, disclosed the following information:

She has been truthful in previous contacts by -FBI Agents
with her that she does not recall having any contact at all except
by personal correspondence with her oldest brother, JAMES EARL
RAY, since about eight or nine years ago, prier to the time he
escaped from the Missouri State Penitentiary (MSP), Jefferson
City, Missouri. Her only contact with JAMES EARL RAY while he
waS incarcerated there was via mail. She admitted having written
to him under the name of her grandmother who died after RAY was
confined to the penitentiary.

She emphasized that she has never at ayes nor does
she now know where her brother spent the time between about
» April 23, 1967, when he escaped from the MSP and July 1967, when
his whereabouts have been established through investigation. She
. did not see or hear from him at all during that period of time,
and insofar as is known to her, none of her brothers or desired
have seen him since he escaped from the MSP, :

“She was very much surprised when she learned that JAMES
EARL RAY had been arrested in London, England. She first learned
_ of these circumstances after being called by telephone by a woman
: friemd, name not disclosed, on Saturday, June 8, 1968, the day of
_his arrest. This friend informed her of the news and she then
heard the same news on television. Although she has saved most
of the local papers for each day since that time, ske has not read
from more than one or two of them about her brother. The news
is, of course, upsetting and she has formed an opinion that in
many instances information is grossly exaggerated and misrepresented.
She is somewhat bitter towards the local press, advising that CHRIS
CONDON, a St. Louis news commentator, telephoned her, probably |
on Monday, June 10, 1968, requesting an interview with her, She
declined and on the following day, Tuesday, June 11, 1968, in the
late afternoon she observed CHRIS CONDON and several other men
with him, both in front of the house and in a vestibule at her
house. They appeared to be attempting to gain' entrance but she
declined to answer the door, She observed that they took pictures
of the house and then on the 6:00 p.m. television news broadcast,
Channel 5, she observed pictures of her house. The pictures dis-
closed the house number of 2025, and the news announcement indi-

- cated the house was located on Bellevue Strest in Maplewood.

Mr. RODNEY ARVIDSON, owner - operator, National
Dance Studio, 2026 Pacific Avenue, Long Beach, California,
telephone 591-5651, advised as follows:

He recalled ERIC GALT as a dancing student
who enrolled at National Dance Studio during the first
yeck of December 1967, and who subsequensly quit taking
lessons quite abruptly on approximately February 12, 1968.

ARVIDSON stated that during this period of time
he had several occasions to talk with GALT and on at least one
occasion he interviewed GALT for approximately two hours,
in an attempt to benefit him socially through his dance lessons
at the studio. .

Through his conversations with GALT, ARVIDSON
stated that he was told by GALT that he had been in Mexico
and as he, ARVIDSON, recalled he believed it was in the
early part of 1967. ARVIDSON stated that he believed GALT
informed him that he owned a restaurant in Mexico City.
ARVIDSON stated that he spoke Spanish fluently and when he
conversed with GALT in Spanish, GALT did not reply, leading
ARVIDSON to believe that GALT was not conversant to any degree
in that language. ARVIDSON stated that GALT used rather
poor language, leading him, ARVIDSON, to believe that he had
achieved education no higher than high school.

ARVIDSON recalled that he never saw GALT in any
attire other than shirt and tie. He often wore a very :
expensive pair of alligator shoes which ARVIDSON believed were
loafer cut. GALT told him sometime during their conversations
that he was a merchant seaman and that he very much desired
to return to the sea. :

: Upon terminating his dance instructions, GALT
stated that he wanted to attend bartending school in order

that he may open his own restaurant, and his dance
instructions were conflicting with his desires to
attend bartending school. , :

ARVIDSON stated that GALT was somewhat backward
socially and was a poor dancing student because he was
ill-at ease with others. GALT could never seem to relax
while in a mixed grovp or around other people. ARVIDSON
recalled that GALT was driving a white automobile, make —
and model unrecalled by ARVIDSON. ' 7

ARVIDSON stated since GALT was a student for
such a short period of time he did not obtain a photograph
of him, which was customary for F all. students enrolled in the
dance studio. 5

GALT did not smile readily, was pleasant
but very evasive. He would not talk about himself
at all and would not look the individual he was conversing
with in the eye. He was bashful and a true introvert
and smiled with a crooked smile. To ARVIDSON's
recollection, GALT never appeared at the dance studio
with any associates, male or female.

ARVIDSON stated that he was of the opinion
that GALT was a complete loner, was transient, although
he seemed to have money. ARVIDSON recalled that in each
instance when GALT paid for dance instruction as agreed,
he removed a roll of bills from his trouser pocket and.
paid his account as agreed.

ARVIDSON stated that ARDELLE,a part-time dancing
employee, instructed GALT more than any other of the
National Dance Studio employees. ARVIDSON stated that
ARDELLE was the. nickname of SHARON RHOADS, 5/111 Don Ricardo
Drive, Los Angeles, residence telephone 293-2616. ARVIDSON
stated that RHOADS was employed by Charter Title Company,
located on Wilshire Boulevard, Beverly Hills, California,

She stated that she was employed on a part-time
pasis as an evening dance -instructor at the National
Dance Studio located at 2026 Pacific Avenue, Long Beach,

She stated that she recalled one ERIC S. GALT.
- as:a former student whom she instructed. She stated that
as she recalled, GALT was her dancing pupil from ‘about
the first week in December 1967 through approximately the
middle of February 1963.

In recalling GALT, she offered the following
information concerning him:

She said that GALT was a very neat person and
that he’ dressed immaculately, often in expensive clothes.
He always appeared at the dance studio cl. eanly shaven,
_ wearing white shirt and tie, and either a sport coat
and slacks or a suit.’ She stated he also owned an
expensive looking pair of alligator loafers, which he often
yore with a sport suit. She stated that his hands were very
well kept, and his nails may have been proressionally
manicured, but she could not state this with absolute
certainty. She stated, however, that she had never seen
his hands soiled or his fingernails dirty. His fingernails
were well filed and trimmed and were worn short and neat. ‘
She stated that he was left handed inasmuch as she had :
noticed him on two occasions writing, and at the time she
observed him writing, she made a mental note that he was a
"south paw." °

GALT was very ill at ease in crowds and gave
her the impression that he prefers to be either alone or
with no more than one other individual. He was an
introvert and was very hard to converse with. She stated
that in the approx ximate two months that she mew him,
only towards the last did he feel confident enough with
her that he would joke with her. She stated that toward
the end he showed somewhat of a humor, which she believed
very few people knew he had. He was always i11 at ease
around others and could not relex while in conversation
with any other individual. He always fidgeted, pulled at
his ea RES y played with his hands, and looked in every
direction but at the person with whom he was conversing.
|She stated that he smiled with a one-sided smile and that
che smiled very infrequently.

He would never talk about himself, but in general
conversations she was led to believe that he came to Los
Angeles from Mexico, possibly around Mexico City. He told
her that he was unemployed; was a former merchant seaman;
that he wished to return to sea, and that he received
sufficient proceeds from the sale of a bar that he could
"get along without being gainfully employed. "

RHOADS stated that shé was of the opinion that
GALT entertained the thought of asking her for a date on
many occasions, but his backwardness prevented him from
actually doing so. During the dancing lessons he always
entered his conversations around dancing techniques and
ever talked in general terms about himself. She believes
e was a Southerner, and she recalled that possibly the
first or second week during January 1968, he did not attend
dancing instruction, and upon his return, stated that he had
visited a brother in the State of Louisiana. RHOADS stated
that during the two month period that she knew GALT, he
changed residences twice in Hollywood, California. She

at no time associated with GALT socially. She was not
acquainted with any of his associates, and through

gonversations » GALT told her that he had no particular
"hobby." :

ehaseeet She state 7ALT seemed to compensate for
his social ina; ines hit nis attire and placing his
schedule on precise projects which he was participating in.

As an exe anole, she stated that GALT took dancing
lessons she believed to overcome some of his shyness. He
pursued the dancing lessons quite vigorously, doubling up
en the number of lessons normally taught per week so as to
take the maximum number of lessons in the shortest possible
time. He abruptly quit dancing, telling her that he had
enrolled in bartending school and was having a conflict in

is schedule.

RHOADS was of the opinion that he had toyed with
his dancing lessons sufficiently to satisfy himself and
was “running off on another tangent." She also stated
that GALT was not sufficiently busy she believed to have not
pursued both courses, because GALT told her thei he slept
rather late, had lunch, took a nap in the early afternoon,
yent to bartending school in the late afternoon, and would
then attend dancing lessons in the early evening. This,
he explained to her, was his typical day. peed yas: not a
busy, productive, or strenuous one in her mind.

She stated that GALT was very slow in his mental
processes. He often did not understand jokes: and aid not
react favorably to a friendly gesture extended to him.

RHOADS stated that during one conversation with GALT she

made mention that it was odd that he did not wear any
jewelry, that is ring or watch, since he was so well dressed
otherwise. GALT replied that he detested jewelry of any sort,
and to her knowledge, she never saw him wear a watch, ring,
or cuff links, or any other items of jewelry. :

RHOADS could remember nothing else of the
mannerisms, background, etc. of GALT. She stated that GALT
was a white male, weighing about 165 pounds. She stated
that he had brown hi was in his middle 30s; had a medium
complexion, and spoke with a Southern accent. She stated
that from his diction she believed him to be high school
educated, fo her knowledge, he spoke no foreign language.

fully cooperating with the FBI at all times in this

Mrs, MARGUERITE WELCH, who resides at 287 Crestwood

in charge of personnel at the Sportsman Country Club located
on Dundee Road, Wheeling, Illinois, advised SA HARRY A.
WALKER as follows on April 24, 1968: i

She has been acquainted with JERRY RAY, the
maintenance man at the Sportsman Country €lub, since approxi-~
mately September, 1964, when he started employment as a
dishwasher at the country club coming to the club from the
i Bell Employment Service, Chicago, Illinois, RAY left
shortly after his employment started; however, returned within
one or two months and continued his employment as a dishwasher,
He eventually became night maintenance man at the club and
has always in this capacity performed his work in a capable
manner and was honest in every respect; however, she is of
the opinion that RAY has a low mental capacity.

RAY at no time has ever visited her home at the
above address and she has had no contact with RAY since he
left the Sportsman Country Club on April 23, 1968, which is
his day off, until the present time. RAY on his day off
which falls on a Tuesday usually takes a bus to Chicago,
visits a theater, sometimes staying in Chicago and returning
the next day either for lunch or dinner,

RAY has spoken of a brother who she believes is
from the St, Louis, Missouri area; however, he never provided
any additional information concerning this brother other than
the fact that he was a bartender, RAY also had a child during
his marriage to GJIRDIS RAY, nee OLSEN, a former waitress
at the country club; however, GJIRDIS was pregnant by a former
husband whose last name she remembers as STRIET (phonetic)
md the baby was born shortly after RAY’s marriage to GJIRDIS
RAY, nee OLSEN, To the best of her recollection, GJIRDIS RAY
no longer has this baby turning it over to a welfare agency
for adoption, RAY also has an ex-wife, possibly in Nashville,
Tennessee, and had a son and a daughter by'this marriage who
should be in the vicinity of from eight to ten years old.

ment at the club, RAY flew to Tennessee to visit these two
children; however, she knows nothing further concerning these
children or their mother or where the family is presently
residing in Tennessee.

RAY has no close friends at the club; however, in
the past has filled in for other employees of the club
in addition to his own duties when the employees wanted time
off and needed someone to work in their place. He at no time
spoke of other members of his family other than to say that
he had a brother that was a bartender in the St. Louis area
and she had no idea that RAY was incarcerated in the past,
Her records revealed that RAY worked steadily during the
night at the Sportsman Country Club from Wednesday evening,
April 3, 1968, through Monday, April 8, 1968, without
having any time off, :

She is of the opinion that RAY is not cooperating
with the FBI in every respect, does not feel that some of the
questions asked of him are important enough for him to give
any thought in answering; however, it could be that due to
his low mental condition that he is not capable of answering
the questions asked of him, However, she is going to talk
to RAY telling him that she "thinks" that this is an extremely
important part of his life to cooperate with the FBI in
every respect,

“Located at 1344 Hazel, as he came home for lunch
from his two-day-a-week “manpower"job as maintenance manager.
at Recreation Department, United States Naval Hospital,

Great Lakes, PAUL ALFRED OLSEN, Age 69, advised as follows:

GJERDIS RAY is the daughter of his brother who
was killed in Whitehall, Montana, in 1949. He and his wife
adopted GJERDIS at age i months, They also adopted GJERDIS'
brother, NORMAN DALE OLSEN, now age 22, and living in
Houston, Texas, and working as an auto painter.’ Both of the
children were slow to learn, left school early, and have been
constant sources of trouble for their stepparents.

GJERDIS got married three years or so ago to a
DAVID STREET, had a baby by him, then got a divorce for no:
support. Then she married JERRY RAY whom she met at
Sportsmans goif course two years ago. Last year she put her
* baby up for adoption through a Methodist home in Lake Forest.

_ RID:

* She and JERRY separated six months ago, and she later got
a divorce. She has since lived by herself and not at her
“parental” home because Mr. and Mrs, OLSEN are "fed up"
and did not approve of her chasing around, staying out late,
ete. :

este Mr. md Mrs, OLSEN had become attached to the baby, - -
and visited GJERDIS and the baby a few times at Northbrook,
at the place on Techny Road. OLSEN saw JERRY RAY a few :
of those times but did not like him because once OLSEN
got stuck in the snow right outside the Techny address, and
JERRY would not “even bother to help push" him out. OLSEN
never met any. relatives of JERRY RAY and first knew that
JERRY had a brother, JAMES RAY, when he read it in the
newspapers a few weeks ogo,. GJERDIS never mentioned having
met JAMES, and OLSEN was unaware of a visit by one of the .
RAY brothers to the Techny Road address. He recalled ‘that

; : shortly after they were married, JERRY RAY and GJERDIS went

i to Missouri to see JERRY's relatives with the intention,’ ae
of living there but he heard no more about this. eet

OLSEN concluded that he feels there is something :

wrong mentally with GJERDIS, who just moved from Lake Forest -
to a motel in Des Plaines and who iswrking as a waitress - --'
at the Kopper Kettle, Highland Park. Mrs. OLSEN works as
a babysitter at the J. D, SIMMONS residence, B2724 Birchwood
Lane, Highland Park, phone 945-5029, we

Interviewed separately May 7, 1968, at B2724 Birchwood.
Lane, Hrs, PAUL OLSEN verified generally what her husband
had said and added that GJERDIS is highly nervous and emotional,
takes pills and is under doctor's care, principally because :
of the strain of having placed her-baby out for adoption
last summer in an attempt to preserve her marriage with
JERRY RAY, She said GJERDIS, who was born April 12, 1948,
married JERRY RAY in Chicago in about January, 1967, and they
first lived at Arlington Heights before moving to 2897 Techny
Road, Northbrook, Before GJERDIS and JERRY were separated
in the fall of 1967, Mrs, OLSEN visited them about three
+: times, but at no time saw any of JERRY’s relatives. When. the
., papers related, much to her surprise, a few weeks ago that
\ JAMES RAY and JERRY RAY were brothers, she recalled the

4;——

“two incidents, the dates of which she could not precise};
piace:

The first was GJERDIS* relating to her about the.
/ trip she and JERRY-took to St. Louis where JERRY visited a
brother and his father who lived near there, GJERDIS told
of "waiting in a theater" for JERRY while he went with his ....
brother oe: some sort of mission. This trip was shortly

after the marriage, probably in the early spring of 1967,

which Mrs. OLSEN related to a time when GJERDIS had just

quit working for Culligan's in Arlington or Northbrook

.

The other incident concerned a phone call GJERDIS
made to Mrs, OLSEN from Northbrook,’ in which she said that
‘something funny" was going on because she, GJERDIS, had
discovered some strange clothes left in the garage by :
JERRY's brother from St. Louis; further, that this brother”
had taken JERRY's car and left. GJERDIS told Mrs. OLSEN
that she "just don't understand" and that she had not :
really seen the brother.

When the publicity about JAMES EARL RAY came hee
Mrs, OLSEN and GJERDIS tried to set the time of the foregoing
ear incident and figured that it must have been April, 1967,
because “he (JAMES RAY) didn't escape until late in April"
and they chose to assume that it was brother JAMES who
was there at the time,

Mrs. OLSEN concluded that she is certain that
GJERDIS has never in her life seen JAMES EARL RAY from what
she has told and indicated to her (Mrs. OLSEN). She
cautioned that.GJERDIS' mind would “wandér" when agents.
talked with her and she hae not be able to recall Ldeteiaceen
dates and Places. 7

It is noted that Mrs. OLSEN as well as her husband
pledged complete cooperation and said they would immediately
contact the FBI should they hear or learn, any information
re subject,

‘ GJERDIS DOROTHEA ANNA OLSEN (she has again assumed
her maiden name), date of birth April 12, 1948, at St. Paul
Minnesota, who would frequently go off on unexplained
tangents in response to questions, was interviewed outside
her place of employment, Kopper Kettle, Routes 41 and 22,
Highland Park, She said she bad been "expecting" agents,
that she really had no "good" information, but that she .
would cooperate in any way. She advised as follows: |

Since May 4, 1968, she has been residing at Randel's
Motel, Apartment 12, Des Plaines, but intends to move in the
near future to Waukegan. She drives a 1962 Plymouth with * -~
1968 Illinois license HK 6917. She married WILLIAM STREET,
Mundelein, Illinois, August 31, 1966, and, gave birth to his
baby October 13, 1966. She divorced bim in Chicago in about --: -
January, 1967, after having met JERRY RAY who was working -
at Sportsmans, In about Christmas, 1966, she and JERRY ~-
went to St. Louis and visited his father and his sister,
HELBA, and her husband, There was another man there, probably =
a brother, but she never heard his name, She first knew of _
a brother, JOHN, when in early 1967, at the Techny Road ranean
address, she happened to see a clipping in which it was
mentioned that JOHN RAY was in some kind of trouble. She sae

“never talked to JERRY about this, however, and she never knew

there was a JAMES RAY until after it "came out in the
papers." She has seen numerous pictures of JAMES RAY since
and"is quite sure" she has never seen him before. As to .._°
her waiting in a theater in St. Louis, she responded only
that she did go to a movie one time rather than Bo with
JERRY on some sort of errand,

After the publicity about JAMES, she and ‘her mother
recalled the incident wherein a brother from St. Louis, name ~.-
unknown to her, came and left some clothes and his car,

This brother was about 45, had dark hair like JERRY, but was
not JAMES, She and her mother figured it was cbout April, 7
1967, when this occurred. The brother came driving a 1961
red Plymouth tudor, with white top, and he traded cars with
JERRY, taking JERRY's 1963 or 1964 Rambler, which JERRY had
bought from the second chef at Sportsmans. This was a cream
Olored four door, The brother left in this car, sayin

“was to have been sent the title for the 1961 Plymouth but
later he took this car back to St. Louis and left it and ~
got the car which he is now driving, 7 7

GJERDIS, who had to return to work at her boss’
request, concluded that she would be available at any time
for further interview, but she was very certain "I have never
seen JAMES." She said JERRY has been ruined by the publicity
and she would like to "find eal to talk to him and "settle

z& “Just between you and me, I saw my brother right aiter
he escaped. We had a meeting place where he would meet on my
days off." RAY did not say if these alleged meetings occurred
after his escape from.prison or after the: murder of KING.

JERRY RAY also said he had visited his brother who
owns a tavern in St, Louis, Missouri, after the assassination
and before his first interview by the FBI. He stated that
before the FBI contacted him, he saw the photograph of an
individual identified as ERIC STARVO GAL® with his eyes closed.
He recognized this man as being identical with his brother JANES
EARL RAY.

JERRY RAY said if he told ‘the FBI everything he knovys,
“with all of their resources" they would be able to "track him

. down." He stated, "I do not know where he is right now. I do

not think I'll ever see him alive again." He explained his
brother would probably not permit himself to be captured alive.
JERRY RAY added that he did not want the subject apprehended
because of the additional bad publicity it would result in for
the RAY family. RAY further said he does not refer to the
subject since the assassination by his real name but calls him
STARVO or GALT, He did not explain why he does this.

RAY also said, "I tell the FBI only enough to keep
them off my back." |

On 6/5/68, RAY speculated that the

“subjéct would probably . flee the country to Mexico or Canada, '
He also said the subject was too hot for him to be in touch
with now. i:

: On 6/6/68, ig asked JERRY RAY if his brother
-shot KING, He replied, This is his business. I didn't ask
hin, If I was in his position and had 18 years to serve and
someone offered me a lot of money to kill someone.I didn't like
anyhow and get me out of the country, I'd do it."

Later the same day JERRY RAY commended |. -
even if the subject confesses to committing the murder of KING,
he, JERRY RAY, would not agre th him, He did not further
explain this statement, advised,

He RAY said he now carries a gun from his room to his .
ear. He keeps the gun in the trunk of his car. When he walks

for personal protection, ~ a

“RAY said the subject is a supporter of Presidential
Candidate GEORGE WALLACE, He said the subject once drove a man
to Alabama from possibly the California area so he could vote
for WALLACE, He then identified this man by his photogra:
appears in the 5/3/68, issue of "Life: It is noted me]

said the magazine states as man's‘name is CHARLES
E. JERRY RAY, : : “| did not say when
the trip to Alabama” occurred

’ JERRY RAY said he was considering moving his residence
again to a place where the press and possibly the FBI would be
unaware of, He also said he was thinking of beginning to use
the alias of JERRY RYAN. He then displayed a new Illinois
driver's license in the name of JERRY RYAN. He said he recently
‘obtained that license for his own use. He did.not further
explain why he might change his address and begin toa,use an’
alias. He did not say he intended to leave. his present’ job,

On 6/7/68, f. Ey said on 6/6/68, fw
asked JERRY RAY if he thought his br ther shot KING. RAY’
replied by pointing out if he were in his brother's position

of having an 18 year sentence to serve once he was apprehended
and someone offered him money to kill someone he did not like
-and thereafter be able to leave the country, ne would do it. -
RAY further volunteered at this point the subject might have =v -|
fled to Canada or Mexico. He did not say anything further
-about where he thought the subject was.

asked JERRY RAY where the subject
got the money 5 buy instant white Mustang with, JERRY RAY
replied, "They gave him part of the money. He put the money
in a safety deposit box, but: when he left, he drew it all out.
It broke his heart to have to leave the white Mustang."

On 6/9/68, PCI also said on 6/6/68, ie) recalled RAY

JERRY RAY said this while {., discussing

JERRY RAY also said he intends to travel to

do this so he and his brother can agree on how they should

Harch 13, 1978

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTER ON ASSASSINATIONS
U. S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES (HSCA)

In the course of a file review conducted at the
St. Louis FBI Office in an unrelated matter, a St. Louis
informant file was reviewed. This file contained a contact
memorandum dated March 19, 1974, which set forth information 7
relating to several criminal matters and also contained the
following paragraph:

"During the Fall of 1973, five or six months ago,
date not recalled, Beyers came to the shop inquiring as
to whether they could get together to talk, and they later
did so at Pizza and Cream, Clayton, Missouri, in the area
of a Broad-Dugan Paint Store, where informant had traveled
on business. Beyers talked freely about himself and his
business, and they later went to informant's house where
Beyers told a story about visiting a lawyer in St. Louis
County, now deceased, not further identified, who had
: offered to give him a contract to kill Martin Luther King.
: Ee said that also present was a short, stocky man, who
walked with 4 limo. (Later, with regard to the latter
individual, Beyers commented that this man was actually
the individual who made the payoff of James Earl Pay after
the killing.) Beyers said he had declined to accept this
contract. He did remark that this lawyer had confederate ~
flags and other items about the house that might indicate
that he was 'a real rebel'. Beyers also commented that
he had been offered either $10, 009. or, $20,000 to kill King.

‘Extensive further research in the St. Louis indices
and files failed to reveal this information was in any way
seminated and the information simply reposes in the informant

in an unrelated matter which it is believed is of interest
to the Committee. This information concerning a St. Louis
informant discussing with (first name not furnished) Beyers

HSCA's investigation was furnished to FBI Headquarters, in the
attached memorandum dated March 13, 1978.

In order to facilitate the Committee's evaluation
of the information contained in above-mentioned memorandum,
the St. Louis Office was asked to furnish background data
on Beyers. On March 17, 1978, the St. Louis Office
telephonically furnished the following:

NAME: Russell George Beyers
DOB: August 19, 1931
FBI NUMBER: 101-3115

The information contained: in the memorandum of
March’ .13, 1978, was discovered as a result of a file review
conducted for background data on Beyers who was recently
arrested by'the St. Louis Police Department for his alleged
participation in the burglary of a St. , Louis museum.

‘there information is not provided, it is because
it is not retrievable or is not being furnished pursuant to

It is noted at the Bureau that in several of. the
letterhead memoranda submitted in connection with this
metter Special Agents of the FBI have observed marches. and
demonstrations, It is assumed. at the Bureau that Agents
were at the scene of these demonstrations in connection
with other busifiess inasmuch as there has been no :
authority from the Bureau for Agents to be present ri
observing such activities. It is, of course, necessary 7
that your office maintain sufficient close liaison with ?
law enforcement agencies to be made currently aware of f
all developments; however, without specific Bureau -_
authority, Agents should not observe demonstrations as -
a@ part of intelligence-gathering activity.

This is to recommend release of the attached

“ Martin Luther King, Jr., leader of the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference, who is scheduled to: give the keynote
address at a fund-raising activity sponsored by Communist
Party-controlled Freedomways Associates, publishers of the
magazine, "Freedomways," which is self-described as a
quarterly review qf the Negro Freedom Movement. The
objective is to show that King appears to be courting the’
communists to bolster his forthcoming civil disobedience
campaign in Washington, D. C., in the Spring of 1968.

+ The communist publication, "National Guardian,"
recently publicized the fact. that King is to give the
keynote address at the 100th anniversary celebration of
the birth of thé late W. E. B. DuBois, well-known Negro
educator who joined the Communist Party, USA, at the age
\ of 93. This affair is scheduled to be held on 2/23/68 in

Memorandum to Mr. W. C. Sullivan
RE: COMMUNIST PARTY, USA
100-2~104-234

It is believed that the publicity given to King's appearange | 7

at Carnegie Hall on 2/23/68 in behalf of the communist ~* &
. publication, "Freedomways," could serve to show King's epee
“f{affinity “for the-communist movement and, thereby, place his

planned civil disobedience eampaign in the proper context .*

The attached proposed article goes directly “to 7
the heart of this matter. It is proposed that this article
be reléased ‘to appropriate sources in the mass news media
Zield through the Crime Records Division. The proposed
article raises the questionas to whether King is courtipg

- the communists, to bolster his civil disobedience campaign.

iS connection, it is pointed out that Hunter Pitts

(Jack) O'Dell, former close associate of King's in the
Southern Christian Leadership Conference, is one of the
editors of “Freedomways."" <In 1963, King reluctantly released
O'Dell from his post in the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference. when if became publicly known that O'Dell was a
leading figure in the Communist Party. It is further
pointed out in the proposed article that the Communist Party,
with its years of experience in agitation and fomenting
conflicts, would be a powerful ally for King in his efforts
to, promote civil disobedience in Washington, D.C.

RECOMMENDATION :, :
That this memorandum and the attached article be
routed to the Crime Records Division for release to
appropriate sources in the mass news media field.

accepted two speaking engagements. One is to address the Women's Division
of the United Jewish Appeal 3/4/65 at New York City. The other would be a
address before the American Jewish Committee 5/20/65, New York City. At t

that Jones and "our friend", (probable reference to Stanley Levison) could
work on the speeches, King told Jon&S that he had accepted these engage~
ments because some of his Rabbi friends e been telling him that Jews
were not supporting the civil rights movement. King believes this is in 7
part due to anti-Semitic statements being made by Negroes such as_ Malcolm;
(the-Muslim leader). King thought it would help improve the situation itt

Ein *s Fund-raising Activities: :
King told Jones that he would be in California 2/25-27/65 to atten

a big fund-raising project. It will include a showing of the movie "The
Greatest Story Ever Told" and it would “scare the house of about $28,000."
In addition, there are two or three wealthy people trying to get 50 couple
to give $1,000 (presumably each couple) and they have 26 commitments
already. "King Claimed that his organization, the Southern Christian

| Leadership Conference (SCIC), needs the money desperately. They also
discussed a group in New Rochelle, New York, which King said already had
$5,000 and desired to use it for a fund-raising project to earn even more.
Jones told King that the advertisement which appeared in "The New York
Times" 2/5/65 soliciting funds on behalf of the SCIC cost $2,000, King sa
that ot office had already received $22,000 as a result of this advertise

Belafonte stop SNCC workers who tried to attack King's integrity. King
said that he did not like for SNCC to fight against the idea of having a
leader for the whole movement. King stated that the movement must have a
leader because any ideology is fostered around having a leader around whor
supporters can rally. Jones believes that he can arrange an. unpublicized
meeting between SNCC, SCLC and Belafonte. [J .

OBSERVATIONS: i

Line wAtt2e Attached are.two documents which it is believed should be

de available to Kuettner. Document number 1 contains only public
source information which Kuettner could use without, of course, any
attribution to the FBI. Document number 2 is a short summation
concerning King's cormunist connections with particular emphasis
on his communist advisors, This document would not be used insofar

-~ as Kuettner's article would be concerned but would be merely =<: for
orientation purposes, There would be no loss of security to our

. sources by making this information available to Kuettner,

RECOMMENDATION 3

Attached two documents be furnished to Ponder for the use of
Kuettner with the limitations as set forth above, If approved, this

The briefing lasted approximately 45 minutes. It covered King's

-Communist Party. The identity of the members of the Communist Party who
have had control over and association with King were brought out. The latest
incident in which King has advised the press that he will write a letter to
General Ho Chih Minh of the North Vietnamese, in an attempt to establish
himself as a "peacemaker" was related to Speaker McCormack, The communiszs’
efforts back of this incident, and those individuals perpetrating the incident were
meftioned,

Speaker McCormack was quite calm about the entire briefing, He
stated he had heard much in the way of rumor previously; however, he wanted
to know if the information he had received was accurate, He stated he now
recognized the gravity of the situation and that scmething obviously must be done
about it, He inquired as to Rae the President knew these facts, 1 repliec in
the affirmative, - i

eall King a notorious liar for nothing." He stated he now recognized why the
Director branded King as he‘did, He added that he was in complete sympathy

with the Director taking this action,

mailing to 70,000 potential financial contributors. King ‘i
asked these 70,990 to contribute to the Washington Spring :
Project for the feeding and housing of the marchers. i 4)

At the same tie, churches in the Washington, D. C., ~
area have said they will feed and house King's marchers.’

Martin Luther King, Jr., President of the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), today finds himself
in the embarrassing position of having too much money, or at
least the probability of too much money. The SCLC sent out a
huge mailing to its contributors pleading for funds for the
Washington Spring Project, the "poor people's march on
Washington." Thousands of contributors were urged to support
the march financially in order to feed and house the demon=-
strators., But the churches in the Washington, D. C., area
have offered to house and feed the demonstrators. i

Now the contributions are beginning to roll in fron
the mailing and King doesn't need the money. An embarrassment

other purposes. The churches had better come through with

all the housing and support the demonstrators need, because

there will be little money left for the "poor people” by the
‘ time the march rolls around. 7

SANITATION WORKERS STRIKE,
MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE

On February 16, 1968, Charles L, Cabbage
advised a representative of the Fedéral Bureau
of Investigation that he is the head of the Black
Organizing Power (BOP), a Student Nonviolent Coordina—
ting Committee (SNCC) oriented group in Memphis,
Tennessee, On March 5, 1968, Donnie Delaney advised
representatives of the Federal Bureau of Investigation
that he is a part of this same group,

Source one advised that Hosea L, Williams was
the main spokesman and stated that every effort would be’
made by @ task force of the SCLC which ‘is in Memphis
during the week beginning April 1, 1968, to escalate the
strike support activity in Memphi3, Tennessee, James ~-
Qrange stated that be would set up a series of youth
workshops in the various churches in Memphis which would
be attended by youths and adults and that these persons ©
would be trained in SCLC techniques and would also be
trained as parade marshals for any subsequent marches
which would be held under the auspices of SCLC and the
COME group, James L, Bevel stated that Dr, Martin Luther
King, Jr., President of the SCLC, would come into Memphis

-on Tuesday, April 2, 1968, and would probably remain until
Friday, April 5, 1968, and would probably march in a mass
march -to be sponsored by COME and SCLC on that date,

Source one stated that some of the press raised
the question as to whether SCLC was attempting to take over
the strike and related racial activity in Memphis, Tennessee, -
and Bevel and Hosea Williams emphatically denied this claiming
that they are operating in Memphis at their “own expense,"
Hosea Williams stated that the SCLC would have to pet the
garbage men justice and that it would probably have to have
daily marches in this effort. 2

: Source further advised thet Reverend Jesse Jackson

. stated that SCLC and its supporters would start a concerted
drive to get a11 Negroes in Memphis, some 250,000, to transfer
their bank accounts and insurance policies from white
institutions to Negro institutions, He stated that this
group vould 2lso0 attempt to see that Negro businessmen
obtained a greater portion of Negro business and that if they
did not “shape up" they would have to “ship out."

MEMPHIS, TENNESSSE

Source one interpreted this to mean that Negro
businessmen would have to prepare themselves to discharge
their business responsibilities should new business from
their own people be brought to them,

c Source one advised that Williams, Bevel and Jackson
kept emphasizing that this is not a "takeover" on their part
and that they are in Memphis at the invitation of the COME
group, They described themselves as a catalyst who are here
in Memphis to unite “black power," 7

Source one advised that Reverend James Morris
Lawson, Jr,, stated that the leaders would have to
recognize every black person in Memphis, including the
youth, as a'force in this movement."

Source one advised that in response to queries
from the press as to who is financing the obviously
expensive SCLC operation in Memphis, Hosea Williams replied
that SCLC is paying the bills from its treasury and that
any money raised as 2 result of SCLC activity in Memphis
will go the sanitation workers,

Source one further advised that Bevel answered
-@ press inquiry relating to a recent statement by Memphis
Police and Fire Director, Frank C, Holloman, in which
Mr. Holloman described the March 28, 1968, disruption on
Beale Street in Memphis which spread into other Negro
heighborhoods of Memphis as in effect a "war," Bevel in
commenting on Holloman's statements stated, "We're here
@s political psychiatrists, We see the Mayor and his group
as patients who are mentally sick," Bevel also stated
that all of the trouble in Memphis can be attributed not _
to black militancy and irresponsibility, but to the -
over-all white racism which he claimed exists in Memphis,
He stated that Memphis Mayor Henry Loeb feels inferior
because he whviously dces not understand black people,
He added that the city tried to settle its problem with
the Army and with tanks when the real problem was poverty.
He emphasized “poverty is the key issue.”

Source one stated that some of the press raised.
quest ions with the ministers as to how they explained
away the mass stealing, looting and vandalism which
occurred on March 28, 1968, on the part of Negroes in
Memphis; and Bevel'stated that 211 nen have a right to
steal, He stated that it is obviously correct for the’ -

‘ white race to steal; that they have been cheating and

stealing from the Negroes economically for centuries;

and he concluded by stating, “We believe in black power
and advocate its use," He did not elaborate as to what.
che meant, 7 .

On the late night of April 1, 1968, Memphis

Chief of Police James C, Uacdonaid advised that the City

of Memphis was giving serious consideration to legal

actions which could be taken to prevent future mass

marches, He stated that the city was considering asking

for a court injunction preferably'a Federal Court injunction,
prohibiting any mass marches ted by Dr, Martin Luther

King, Jr., or other persons prominent in the march which
preceded violence on Thursday, March 28, 1968, in Memphis,

He stated that any such injunction would specify the
comitions under which 2 march could take place and

that the city is further considering the resumption of

the curfew which was. originally imposed on March 28, 1968,
and which was lifted April 1, 1968, Chief Macdonald also
stated that the city was considering placing some of the
strike support leaders under peace and financial responsibility
bonds,

Chief ‘Macdonald stated that Memphis Juvenile Court
Judge Kenneth Turner was c&lling for an investigation of a
report that one or morc ministers provided taxicabs to
take youths from their schools to the March 28, 1968, march
which would be in violation of the truancy laws, He "said 7
adults who were doing this could be gharged with contributing

to the delinquency of a minor,

MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE

Chief Macdonald stated that Judge Turner's
decision came after remarks by a student, Alvin White,
of 1546 Orr who stated that he skipped school to take

’ part in the march and had told Judge Turner that a minister,
name not known to him, had provided taxicabs to take some
of his friends and himself to Clayborn Temple AMB Church
so they could be in the march,

Chief Macdonald stated that approximately 31
Negro youths appeared in Judge Turner's Court. on April 1,

. 1968, in connection with truancy and other charges growing
out of the March 28, 1968, incident; and that Judge Turner
continued 8 cases, dismissed 7 for jack of prosecution, -.
dismissed 8 for lack of evidence, took 2 under advisement,
sentenced 4 and remanded 2 to the Shelby County Grand Jury,

have been on strike since February 12, 1968, informed Lux
that a downtown sympathy march for ‘the strikers was planned ©

. for the afternoon of March 29, 1968.

Lawson stated that the march would be restricted.

Lux pointed out that no permit is required for marches of
any kind withfn the city of Memphis and that the Memphis
municipal authorities are considering the possibility of
passing an ordinance of this type. a
Also, on March 29, 1968, Chief of ‘police James C. .
MacDonald of Memphis advised that there. have been no serious
troubles during March 29, 1968. He had instructed all of
his officers to disperse small groups of youngsters in various
sections of the city and that there were still sporadic out- .
bursts of window breaking, minor looting, general vandalism,
and the setting of trash fires. On: squad car was fired on by
unknown. Negroes in the vicinity of Dison and Rile in south ~~
Memphis early on the morning of March 28, 1968, according to
MacDonald, but the individuals firing the shots were not
identified. He stated that throughout the day the Memphis.
Police Department received numerous calls of reported looting,
vandalism, and fire settings and fire bombings, although in-
vestigation by representatives of the Memphis Police Depart-.
ment and the Memphis Fire Department indicated that most of
these incidents were minor. He pointed out that the major
damage in connection with the March 28, 1968, disturbance
was confined to a three to four block area on Beale Street
in downtown Memphis with store fronts being damaged and .
practically all of a three block area. He stated that liquor.
stores are still closed, that National Guardsmen are guarding
the stores which have been looted and where windows have been
‘broken, that the merchants are boarding up the fronts of most
. of these establishments to preclude further vandalism and ;
looting and he feels that with the presence of the Tennessee -
National Guard, along with the assistance of the Shelby

During the evening of March 29, 1968, the police
received numerous calls of reported fire bombings, vandalism,
and looting over a wide area primarily in the Negro neighbor~ ee
hoods but many of these proved to be unfoun on investigation. :

advised that the cu®few-Imposéa-by Mayor Henry Loeb on the ~~

night of March 28, 1968, continued on the night of March 29, :
1968, but that it was a loose curfew in that any individual

on the streets who had identifications would have nothing to.
worry about provided he could give a plausible explanation as~
to his purpose in being there. This meant that theatres,
places of amusement, and restaurants and other functions
normally operating at night would be uninterrupted. He

stated that riot damage resulting from the March 28, 1968,
window breaking and looting was estimated by insurance —- -
- officials at approximately $400,000 not including the mis-.
cellaneous fires. He pointed out fortunately none‘of the

fires were serious. This would not, of course, include

losses due to interrupted business days bécause many office
managers, store owners, government agencies, including

Federal, state and county, dismissed their employees early
both on March 28 and 29, 1968, in order to avoid trouble. :
He stated that the Memphis city buses were operating throughout
March 29, 1968, but would stop around 7:00 P.M. and that in ~~ :
the near future it-was anticipated that they would be operating -
of a full-time basis. Seesiers ise roteesttieresteticaten on : peer :

Mid-South Fairgrounds and on the military side of the .

National Guard units on duty in Memphis. He had no knowledge

city school system in Memphis on March 29, 1968, was nearly
40,000 and that the largest number of truants were at the :
predominantly Negro high schools.

Lux stated that the oaly injury ‘reported Pre
the day was to Memphis Police Patrolman E. W. MAXWELL,
whose finger was severely cut while he was arresting a
drunk young Negro who was fighting with other officers on
‘Polk Street north of Chelsea, which is in a predominantly
Negro neighborhood. He stated that at about 1:15 P.M., |
ee ficers arrested two white youths, namely~Samuel R. bal

of those. arrested for looting were youngsters ranging from
8 to 12 years of age. These were being turned over to

’ The tienphis ConmBzcial dood newspaper, Saturday
morning issue,- reported in detail con- -
cerning activities vot Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., on
_March 29, 1968, and stated in a story on page 1 by Reporter
“Thomas BeVier that King came to Memphis to star in what was
billed as a "dress rehearsal" for his April 22, 1968,

. “Poor People's Crusade” on Washington, D. C.: The story - -
continued, "By his own non-violent standards, the rehearsal ©. °
was a flop. The story stated that King in a press interview
_ March 29, 1968, ce shite that he would be back in Memphis.

as early as April 3 and not later than April 5, 1968, for .
another mass march and was quoted as saying, "We are going
to have a massive non-violent demonstration in Memphis." .
The story stated that the question being asked in Memphis,
the nation, and the world is whether - with the increasing
militancy of black youth — anyone can say with certainty

that a non-violent demonstration will stay that way.

Thee

‘King stated in the interview, "I am convinced -
we can have 2 non-violent demonstration” but was reported
as adding that it would be impossible to "guarantee" that:

there would not be any violence. The story stated that it
was significant that King was more than a half hour late

for his 11:30,A.M. press conference because he was ‘meeting
with three members of a Black Power group, which the paper
referred to as "The Invaders." BeVier stated that these
three young men refused to give their, names and stated that
.they would give their own press conference at a later time.”

The story continued that King was staying in a :
$29 a day room at the Holiday Inn Rivermont, also known as”
the Rivermont Hotel. King claimed to the newspaper that he
did not realize when he came ‘to Memphis that there were those.

_ an the Negro community who were "talking about violence."
He stated, "We (SCLC) had no part in the planning of the ~
march. Our intelligence was nil." He said that if he had
known there were persons likely to start violence, he would .
have had them made parade marshals, a move which she said —_
been successful in other marches. ;

He was reported as being critical of ‘the press oa
for reporting that he left the march in haste after the :
trouble started on March 28, 1968. He claimed that he left .

- calmly because he said, "I will not lead a violent march."
He said that while he “walked” with aides to a car, he was
"agonizing over what had happened.” The story reported that
Assistant Police Chief Henry Lux had earlier said over the
police radio at approximately 11:27 A.M., Thursday,

March 28, 1968, that the march was apparently without leader-
ship as Dr. King had asked for a police escort away fron.
the march a few minutes after the first report of violence

., during the march. King was reported in the story as saying
he did not think the riot "will in any way affect" his :
Washington plans for his Poor People’s Crusade to commence
April 22, 1968. - He said he is undecided as to how much of :

- his SCLC staff he can spare to organize the next Sstedetanhed ot
march in Memphis early in April 1968.

The story said that later in ‘Washington, ‘D. c.; 7

Rev, Andrew Young, Dr. King's top lieutenant, said that the.

main thrust of the Washington demonstration would be delayed
for about two weeks and that steps would be taken to avoid ..

violence and that a “symbolic delegation,” including King a

would reach Washington on April 22, 1968. The story continued —

that King claimed’ that Thursday, March 28, 1968, march was
-"poorly planned" which the paper said amounts to criticism
of Rev. James Y. Lawson, Jr., whom Dr. King himself had called
“the leading non-violence theoretician in the country.” The
paper reported that Lawson is in charge of the strategy for
. the Memphis Negro ministers, also known as COME, and is pastor 7
of the Centenary Methodist Church and continued that Lawson § ~ >
did not entirely agree with King's assessments. 7 :

: The story stated for instance that King had said eee
that the Black Power advocates with whom he met earlier had - a
said that there had been a lack of communication between them :
and the ministers and that they felt "rejected." Rev. Lawson aes
was quoted by the paper as saying, "There has been communication. -
I don’t accept that," referring to King's statement. The ; aaneee
paper said that it was Rev. Lawson who had originally asked
-King to come to Memphis and that for about 10 years Lawson
has served in an advisory capacity with SCLC. It stated that _
Lawson agreed with King that a non-violent demonstration is ~~
possible and pointed out that this was one of the reasons z :
King was asked to come to Memphis. Lawson stated, "We didn’t. =~...
bring in Rap Brown (national chairman of the Student Non- v ‘
Violent Coordinating Committee), we brought in King.“ He
was reported to have further said that there were other
- yeasons for bringing in King, one being to give the movement
in Memphis a “national image" and another was to strengthen
the leadership of the Memphis ministers. — . meu a

in his early twenties, light skinned, with a "dog type" -
face, clean features, Afro hairdo, about 5'9" to 5°10”
tall, slender, and who had introduced himself earlier in
the summer of 1967 as Miller. These 3 shortly prior to the

- to gain an audience but Dr. H. Kalph Jackson, head of the :

Minimum Salary Division of the African Methodist Episcopal -
Church, A.M.E. Church, 274 Hernando, next door to Clayborn
Temple, 280 Hernando, which has been the headquarters of :
the strike supporters since February 12, 1968. Cabbage

was insistent on seeing Ralph Jackson and that Jackson's :
assistant, a Rev. Johnson, refused to allow lim to see Jackson _
stating that Jackson was completely "fed up" with Cabbage and

-his Black Power associates, that Jackson originally had
.. attempted to have rapport and communication with them and

Cabbage, John B. Smith, and their associates came back to oe

pamphlet entitled, “Afro-American Brotherhood Speaks, fo PEEEEET

-national chairman of SNCC. A portion of this document
stated that the civil rights tactics of 1963 are not sufficient |
in the form of pressure on political structures and in dealing
_with what it referred to as extreme violent reaction of city
powers in this community. It claimed that the so-called tee
self-appointed part-time civil rights and part-time preachers .
inevitably "quit the struggle too soon.” It said that “civil |
disobedience implies an entirely new set of priorities and
responsibilities of which the current Negro leadership could
no longer accept.” It claimed that the current strike support
movenent in Memphis had turned into a big revival with the - «© ~~
preachers having the followers so busy singing, praying, and 7
marching that they do not do anything about the real issues. cs
Itasked the question, “Why has the community let the preachers caanees!
take over and try to lead in a fight which? There must be ra

‘some real fighting. We all know the preachers can't fight
or won't fight.” It then printed a letter dated March 21, ©

aggression, from revolt to revolution. For every Orangeburg
there must be 10 Detroits. For every Max Stanford and Huey
Newton, there must be 10 dead racist cops. .And for every .
black death there must be a Dien Bien Phu." It continued,
“Aggression is the order of the day” and concluded “America: .

part of the BOP group, which is affiliated with SNCC and

that he has been serving as a liaison representative of -

- BOP with the COME group, with the Negro ministerial group,
which is coordinating the strike support. Taylor further
stated that when Harrington, Cabbage, and Taylor had an.
audience with King that their purpose in seeing King was to™
tell King that they wanted more of the “action” in Memphis
feeling that they were not getting enough of the action.

‘ Taylor refused to elaborate but source 2 conjectured that :
by this Taylor meant that the Black Power group wanted more -

in the over-all Negro movement .in Memphis.

Source 2 also advised that the newsmen ‘in 1 Memphis :

- "Invaders" when they are actually referring to BOP and pointed
- out that it had been ascertained that actually the Black :
Power movement in Memphis uses several names, such as Afro-
American Brotherhood, Black Student Association, BOP, and
Invaders and that Taylor has told him confidentially that
actually there are only about 12.to 15 hard-core BOP 7
people in Memphis and that the others are merely followers
or people who tend to imitate them. Source 2 also stated

in the March 28, 1968, march when the trouble began, that the -
actual BOP people did not participate in any of the vandalism
or looting although prior to the meeting several of then, :

Atlanta, Georgia. This source stated that to the best of
his knowledge they went directly from the Rivermont Lihat
to the Memphi8S Metropolitan Airport,

" -' Source 1 on March 30, 1968, recalled that ‘Rev.
Martin Luther King, Jr., obviously would have been aware

_ of the presence of a militant Black Power group in.
‘Wemphis and based this opinion on the following information:

: ‘King in his March 18, 1968, speech before the —
strike supporters at Mason Temple had urged all high school
students to remain away from school to participate in the
massive march which he planed to lead in the future and
urged all workers in Memphis to stay away from their jobs

- and march and at no time did he call for a completely non-

- violent march. Source :further recalled that James Bevel,

- who for several years has been on King's staff and who was-

- last known by source 1 to have the title of "in charge of

. non-violent action was in Memphis with King's party on
March 18, 1968, and remained in Memphis until at least —
Harch 20; 1968. Source 1 recalled that on March 20, 1968,

-: Bevel along with Rev. Harold Middlebrook of 257 Walker, -

- a former member of King’s staff in Atlanta and now a resident
of Memphis and one of the leaders of the COME group appeared
at LeMoyne College, a Negro institution of some 600 students oa
in Memphis, being brought there by James Phillips and Clinton -|.
Roy Jamerson, members of the governing body of BOP. There -
Bevel and Middlebrook met with various LeMoyne students at™
the student center at noon on March 20, 1968, meeting with
approximately 75 to 109 stidents. Bevel was the main speaker
and gave what informant described as a virulent Black Power - .
talk claiming that the white power structure through economic ©

“pressure will eventually attempt to exterminate the Negro —
in the United. States in some form of genocide and pointed
out that the United States in its foreign aid program has
proven that it is a white supremacist country in that it :
gives more to white nations in the form of foreign than it ~
does to black countries such as those making up the continent
of Africa. Bevel further claimed, according to source 1,

“that while Negroes or black men as he referred to them welcome
the support given by the white clergy and white “do-gooders”
that these whites are not really.sincere as they have no
“real soul feeling" toward the Negro and he suggested that
his listeners read several Black Revolutionary books, and
particularly urged them to read the book entitled, “The ~
Wretched of the Earth” by Frantz paneer which informant

John B. Smith of BOP, along with Charles Harrington and
Verdell Brooks of BOP and a new supporter of the group,
one Milton Mack and another BOP member Samuel Carter,
were all present with Middlebrook and Bevel at this
meeting. Bevel urged all of these listeners to actively
participate in the future scheduled march to be led by [
Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. Furthermore, at this meeting
John B. Smith and his followers stated that they were
canvassing all of the Negro high schools with leaflets
urging a mass walkout at the schools and urging that these
; Walking. students participate in the sanitation workers
sympathy march to be led by King. On leaving LeMoyne
Middlebrook and Bevel stated that they also planned to

- dnastitutions of higher. learning in Memphis, Tennessee, aazeEs
+. in order to solicit support, not only for their organization
. but also for the proposed mass march to be led by King. :
. John B. Smith bragged to Bevel that his BOP group had also
" organized at most of the colleges in Memphis.

Source 1 recalled also that Bevel. at the LeMoyne |
meeting urged the students to read"Muhammad Speaks," act
official newspaper of the Nation of Islam’ (NOT), headed in °
Chicago, Illinois, by Elijah Muhammad, pointing out that
much of Muhammad's program fits his concept of Black Power
philosophy with the exception of the religious aspect whereby .
Muhammad claimed Allah as his god. He told students to -
ignore the religious aspects and merely follow the economic
and political aspe¢ts propounded in Muhammad’s program.
Bevel also bragged that within the next-year he hopes to - :
‘form a new nationwide Black Power organization in the Sine

- United States which would supersede SNCC and would take in ~
the remnants of the varied uncoordinated Black Power groups

the two would, of course, halt any further progress of the civi rights movement.

had contacted people in various parts of the United States to get them to send telegrams
to the President, the Attorney General, andthe FBI asking for Mr. Hoover's retice-
ment or resignation, I told Wilkins that King had also encouraged telegrams to be
sent advising the FEI of laxness in the investigation of civil rights matters, Iasxed
Wilkins how in the hell could he expect the FBI to believe his offers of friendship anc
request for peace when King was at this time attempting to ruinus. Wilkins mevrziy
hung his head and stated he had no idea that King was carrying on such acampaign. Ze
stated that this upset him greatly and mace him all the more determined to initiate
action to remove King as soon as possicle.
SuESuESEEEESaI Wilkins stated that he had long noted Kins's sympathy tow ard the ~
communist movement. Ee told me this obviously stemmed from § Seanle ereeecees
influence on King. Wilkins diverted from the subject Ee COnV ersation to spend soz 2
time in explaining that he had also noted communis: cence in the civil righis move-
nent in piississippi. Ee siated that the ery of "Down with che Prolevaria:" was
to be the banleery of the militant Nezroes in 23 i

i. He mentioned thet the Negroes have been led by Xing ase 5 eyard Rustin to
believe that the FSi could do nothing right; consequently, FEZ
cases made little impression upon some Negroes in the civzi

Wilkins stated he was wrong in his cxicisism of the D-rector. He added
hat he was attempting to accomplish, ina mild manner, a divic:cn <etween the battle
of the Director and King and any phases of the battle which wou: fiect upon the civil
rights movemeni. fie stated he has a hard time controlling iis ¢u-.12n Board of. at
Directors, particularly since King is a member cf this boara, He 2 added, "We're

Reference is made to my memorandum to you in this mdtter il

ated 4ugust 31, 1964, in which the Director approved the recommendation
have Assistant Director Malone orally brief Francis Cardinal Speliuan

ncerning Martin Luther King, Jr.'s conaunist connections and

generate make-up to avoid the possibility of having the Pope grant
audience to Jiing in connection with, his proposed visit to Rone

ter this nonth, 7 :
i Yalone was briefed in this matter end told to stress two | .
‘ngs in his contact with Cardinal Spellran, the first being that

eC should stress of course the confidential nature of our briefing
o that the Dureau would not be drawn into the picture, and, secondly,
 ejcertea 42 ‘Cardinal Spellman could take the necessary action

relationship with the Pope so that if he could not, we could

ake appropriate, steps through other channels,
oe

~ ‘iialone called today and stated that he had discussed the.
ituation with Cardinal Speliman over the weekend and he s2id that >
he Cardinal took instant steps to advise the Vatican agains
ranting zny audience to King. He stated that Cardinal Spelinan
ssured him that he would respect the confidential nature of the
nfornation and added that the Cardinal was most pleased and
ratified that the Director thought enough of hin to take hin into VY Ui
is confidence and to rely upon him to handle such a delicate matter.
erdinal Spellman is going to Rome next week to attend the Ecumenical
ouncil and thus will be on the scene personally and further insure
hat the Pope is not placéd in an Ma NON eS sand any

1- itr, Phillips fh led
Se pared SSE Jdr., is to be in West Berlin, Germany;
for the opening of that city's cultural festival 9/13/64. We have
just obtained details of his itinerary for travel abroad which reveals
that he will leave the United States cither 9/11 or 12/64 and not
return until 9/22/64, Included in his itinerary is a visit to Rome,
Italy. He is to go there from Madrid, Spain, 9/18/64, and remain in
Rome until the morning of 9/20/64 vhen he will go to London, England.

Ve have not as yet obtained any information indicating the {:

{ purpose of his visit to Rome, but it is entirely likely that he may

seek and be given an audience with the Pope. This likelihood is

clearly evident when one considers that King is receiving more and

lore acclaim as a leader of the Negro people in this country, plus

the fact that he is a clergyman. Further, King we know is being con

sidered for the Nobel Peace Prize andhis receiving an audience with

the Pope would likely receive considerable publicity, especially - in

Europe, further enhancing his chances for the Prize.

iN

* It would be shocking indeed for such an unscrupulous character
as King to receive an audience with the Pope. It is believed that if |
a plan to see the Pope is in the making, it ought to be nipped in the «<
bud. We have considered different possibilities for meeting this :
problem and believe that the best one would be to have Assistant *
Director Malone of the New York Office personally contact Francis | i
Cardinal Spellman and on a highly confidential basis bring to the

Cardinal's attention (1) .the fact that King is to visit Rome and the-
Likelihood of his receiving an audience with the Pope and (2) the
unsavory nature of King's character, both-from a subversive and moral
standpoint. Malone should be able to impress upon the Cardinal the
likely embarrassment that may result to the Pope should he grant King
an audience and King is Later discredited. In this light it would 7
hardly even be necessary for Malone to "suggest" what the Cardinal
should do to forestall any possible audience, _ Malone should stress
the highly confidential nature of this matter with the Cardinal, who
is Very, friendly to the Bureau, and insure that the Bureau is in no

way associated with any action taken by the Cardinal or the Vatican.
Malone should also obtain from the Cardinal a commitment that he

will be able to block any attempt by King to gain an audience with

the Pope, If the Cardinal is not able to give such an assurance,

we must immediately know this so that we may explore some other avenue.

RECOMMENDATION:

If approved, Assistant Director Malone should personally
orally brief Francis Cardinal Spellman in accordance with the attached
“Top Secret" summary indicating King's communist connections and
degenerate make-up. (This is the same summary we previously used
in preventing King's receiving an honorary degree from Harquette
University.) The attached summary should also be used for telephon-
ically briefing Malone. This matter should receive most expeditious
handling because of the time element involved. oF

and the rooms revealed that the cividing walls were made of

} four inch ccnerete blocks, “The Hiltcn Hawaiien Villege has.
appreximately 110% serarate accemncdaticns, rcors, suites,

lencth of time at e*hetel in Henolulu, move cut to other
islands to make way fortether tourists to cere in, and return to .
the Hawaiian Villase when the other tourists move out.

Through Mr. ED EASTINGS, e SAC contact, end a perscnal

friend of SAC PEICE, Mr. PRICE began a most discreet inouiry to
| C determine where the Subject end his party were to be loceted, ~

It was discovered that the hotel is beoked up so full and hes
so many commitrents on 4 continuous basis, thet it ordinarily
books biccks of.rcers end suites by type and price rather then
making inéividusl assignments to guests who have made reservations;
thus, it sould kncev that on 4 tertain day it weuld need, for
example, 190 $20.60 rocrs, 50 $25.00 roors, end 40 $30.00 recms,
but would not individually assign ther. until after the individuel
guest hed registered at the hotel. This wes the case with regard
to the MARTIN LUTHE? KING party. No specific space haa yet been
assigned and for security reasons it was determined best by the
SAC and by the Agents on scecial assignrent, thet es far as
possible, the hotel be Blloved te follow normal booking procedures.

In the meantime, SéAs CLIFFORD and LYMAN proceeded to
establish their identities es tcurists in the hotel and its
environs, The Honolulu Office hes ten cars essigned te it, all
of which are relatively well known end 211 of which are equipped
with 2-way readies. The Arents cn special assignment explered the
possibility with the SAC and experiencee Agents of the Henolvlu
Office cM switching license plates on one of their cars and
utilizing it cn the speciel ess ent, but the censidered spinicn
of 211 concerned wes that security might be lest by such an
arrengenent and it was, therefore, resclved te rent a Hertz car
right et the hetel fer use during the special essipnnent.

Martin Luther King, Jr., President of the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference, injected himself into the
sanitation workers’ strike in Memphis, Tennessee, and the
. vesult of King's .femous espouse] of nonviolence was vandalism,
: looting, and riot. .

-Previously; King involved hin self in this strike,
called for a general strike, and c2lled for a mass march.”
Today he led the mass march in en-autozohile at the head of
the line. Negroes begen shouting "bleck power". and trouble
began., King, apparently uneble or unwilling to control the
archers, absented himself from the scene; window breaking end
looting brake out, : t

Police officers were forced to use gaS to break up

_ the march and to control the crowd, It wes necessary to
activate the National Guard. Martin Luther King claims his
much-heralded march on Washington, scheduled for April 22, i
1968, will also be "nonviolent." He seys he has perstaded
militant black nationalists to abendon violent extremism in
Washington, D. C., during the merch. Memphis may only be.the ~
prelude to civil strife in our Nation's Capitol.

A confidentiel source, who has furnished reliable
information in the past, learned on March 28, 1968, that,
late on that date, Stanley Levison and Martin Luther King, dr.
discussed the violence that occurred in Memphis, Tennessee
on March 28, 1968, following King's leadership of a protest

Qmarch through downtown Memphis. King indicated that he has
become so depressed over the developments in Memphis that

self-described Poor People's Campaign, scheduled to begin in
Qi Washington, D.C. on April 22, 1968). (yu

Levison told King that his depression was aggravated
tdbecause he is physically exhausted es a result of his recent
strenuous program. He counseled King not to be on the defensive
over the events in Memphis but, on the contrary, should take
bythe. position thet the majority of people in tne Memphis March
Gadie not join in the rioting that took place, proving the
‘Zeffectiveness of King's leadership and his policy of non-violence.
rzLevison emphasized that the Washington March wiil ve different
2in that Xing will have organized this march and his forces can
stress the importance of non-violence. Levison suggested thet

We all know the’ Bren gravity of Martin Luther

great ‘violence and bloodshed. This being the capitol city

This Division has been preparing to carry out its

In view of the above, I would like the permission

to make them Giscreetly aware of this particular factor.

the Rint that it is not ¢ enough for these church leaders to

qe we disseminated to the Hea gence

As you are aware, LeRoy Collins, former Governor of
Florida, is Director, Community Relations Service (CRS),
Department of Commerce, and in this position serves. as something
of a “mediator” in problems relating to the racial field. He

by the’ Federal Bureau of Investigation. This effort is to begin this week.

Jetting any effort to discredit King occur. He said he wanted to beg the usage’of our ..
good offices to prevent such an occurrence from happening. He stated he was asking
for our assistance based upon good reasoning. He then mentioned those reasons as:
(1) Reverend King is a good man: (2) Reverend King stands as a "symbol! to the
Negro race today. (3) Reverend King is a "safety valve" at the Present time. He
explained this by indicating that Reverend King’s articulate voice was preventing more
of the militant and violent Negroes from committing serious acts n the United States.

Dr. Carey that King had later denied that he had made such allegations uyfon having an”

‘DeLoach to Mohr Memo, 5/19/65
RE: Dr. Archibald J. Carey, Jr.
Reverend Martin. Luther King
e «

went into the entire situation with Dr. Carey and told him not only of
the many“successes we had enjoyed in this particular field, but also of the dis-

- couragements and humiliations that extremists on both sfdes attempted to subject us
to. Dr. Carey showed great interest and indicated that he would be one that would
attempt to remedy that situation. ‘

Dr. Carey called me “at 3:35 p. the this afternoon and stated he wanted
to use about ten seconds in mentioning two additional things: (1) He stated that he
had talked to King telephonically and remonstrated with King about the fact that King

- shotedd make a greater effort to praise the FBI for its excellent work inthe civil rights
field. (2) Dr. Carey stated he wanted to be very immodest for a second, He added
that he felt he had done a great deal for the current administration and that despite
the fact that he was the president of a savings and loan association; minister of a large
Negro church; and head of other business interests, he would still appreciate it if the

| Director would say a good word for him to the President, Dr. Carey stated he knew
John Macy of the Civil Service Commission very well and felt that Macy would be on
iis side if any appointment came up. I told Dr. Carey that the Director, of course,
regarded him very highly and would naturally keep his request in mind, although it
might be presumptuous for the Director to make such recommendations to the White
House. Dr. Carey stated he could understand this. He again pledged his loyalty

and friendship.

e BEEEELE 7 a

ACTION: ,

Dr. Carey is the third individual that King has had come see us relative
to requesting that we not expose him. -Roy Wilkins, Jim Farmer and Reverend
Abernathy have all been here for the same purpose. It is obvious that King is
becoming very disturbed and worried about his background, else he would not go to
such great efforts to have people approach the FBI I did not commit the FBI in any
manner insofar as exposing King is concerned, To the contrary, I let Carey flatly
know of King's derelictions insofar as false allegations against us are concerned and
of the fact that King and other civil rights workers owed the FBI a debt of gratitude
they wouid never sei alice to repay. For record purposes.

This is an excellent suggestion and we have alreddy

+ started the necessary research, Bringing this monograph up to
date and disseminating it at high level prior to King's "Wash-

a sington Spring Project" should serve again to remind top-level
& officials in Government of the wholly disreputable character
of King. :

"As you know, King's "Washington Spring Project" was
originally scheduled for early April, 1968, However, our
--. Washington Field 0ffice has developed information that King's
vA 3 group is experiencing difficulty in recruiting individuals
4%” to participatein the demonstration and the date for the project
> has now tentatively been set for April 27, 1968.

Because of the importance of doing a thorough job on -}
eres we will conduct an exhaustive file review to bring togethe}
the most complete and, up-to-date information and to present it
{in a hard-hitting manner, To make the brief timely, we will
have it completed:and ready for dissemination by March 14, 1968.

Pursuant to the Director's instructions, I “rama, sit Sen
the attached report concerning the engaged in by Dr. ined’ Ge

to Walter Jenkins of the White House this morning at 11:00 a.m.

Jenkins read the entire report word for word. I told him that the Director thought
perhaps the President might like to know about this matter strictly in confidence..
Jenkins stated he would tell the President this afternoon about this incident. He -
stated that it certainly opened his eyes and he felt it was one of the most repulsive
incidents that he knew of. 1 told Jenkins that the Director indicated I should leave
this attachment with him if he desired to let the President personally read it.
Jenkins mentioned that he was sufficiently aware of the facts that he could verbally
yadvise the President of the matter. Jenkins was of the opinion that the FBI could

Ipgrform a good service to the country if this matter could somehow be confidentially

pen to members of the press. I told ee the Director had this in mind, =

fatso believed we should obtain additi information prior to discussing it with

Special Agent to coordinate this program. Replies to this’ .
letter indicated an interest in counterintelligence against
militant black nationalist groups that foment violence. and - -
several offices outlined procedures which had been effective
in the past. For example, Washington Field Office had - c
Zurnished information about a new Nation of Islam (NOI)

. rade school to appropriate authorities in the District

-. of Columbia who investigated to determine 42. - the ‘school’

‘Phe Revolutionary Action Movement (RAM), a pro-

local police, who then put RAHN leaders under close scrutiny.
“They were arrested on every possible charge until they.could

no longer make bail. As a result, RAH leaders spent 30st of the 7

for the periodic progress letters being requested, but each
Agent working this type of case should participate in the
formulation of counterintelligence operations.

GOALS pelle SSS Soe ;

7 For maximum effectiveness of the Counterintelligence ~
Program, and to prevent wasted effort, long-range goals are
“being set. 27, rae ae eM g Te

: -l. Prevent the conlition of militant black
nationalist groups. In unity there is strength; a truism .-
that is no less valid for all.its. triteness. ‘An effective- -
coalition of black nationalis? groups right be the first
step toward 2 real “Hau Mau" in America, the beginning cf -
a true black revolution. SSE EESE>EEEEGEnEEUSERIEEEEEEREEEEL CeaEEanunyl

2. Prevent the rise of a "messiah" who conld

Malcolm. X might have been such a "“tessiah;" he is the martyr

of the novenent today. Martin Luther King; Stokely Carmichzel
.and Elijah Muhanned all aspire to this position... Elijah :
Hukanmed is less of a threat because of his age. King could = -
be a very renl contender for. this position should he abandon -
his supposed "obedience" to “white, liberal doctrines” ~= ~~.
(nonviolence) and embracé black nationalism. Carmichzel

hes the necessary charisma to be a real threat in this way.

3. -Prevent violencé on the part of black | -.

* nationalist groups: his 15 of primary impértance, and is,
. of course, a goal of our investigative activity; it should

also be a goal of the Counterintelligence Progran. Through
counterintelligence it should be possible to pinpoint potential
troublemakers and neuv'ralize them before they exercise! their .

| potential for violence.- ra : ue

: 4. Prevent militant black nationalist grotps ‘and
leaders from gaining respectability, by discrediting them . -
to three separate segnents of the comuunity. The goal of
discrediting black nationzlists must be handled tactically
in three ways. - You must discredit these frovps and
individuals to, first, the responsible Negro connunity.
Second, they must be discredited to the white comsunity,

~3-.

/_ RE: COUNTERINTELLIGENCE PROGRAM
( BLACK NATIONALIST-IIATE GROUPS

both the responsible community and to “liberals” who have
. vestiges of sympathy for militant black nationalist simply
because they are Negroes. Third, these groups must be
discredited in the eyes of Negro radicals, the followers
of the movement. This last area requires entirely different
tactics from the first two. Publicity about violent tendencies
and radical statements merely enhances black nationalists
to the last aed a: it adds Hid eter ina different
- way. ; 7 : :

5. A final ‘goal ‘should Be to prevent ‘the’ “long~
+ wange grovyth of militant black nationalist organizations,
- ‘especially among youth... Specizic tactics ‘to prevent these -
“7 "groups from converting young ‘people must be developed. -
peau a “Besides these. five goals counterintelligence is
“a valuable part of our regular investigative ee as it
often produces positive information.

< TARGETS

Wace Primary targets ‘of: the feoaiiarinteiiterece Progran,:
G .Black Nationalist~Hate Groups, should be the. most violent --

RACIAL INTELLIGENCE

The Southern Christian Leadership Conference
(SCLC) has recently opened an office in Baltimore, Maryland,
in connection with the proposed march on Washington by
SCLC. A racial source of this office has advised that
prominently displayed in the office are photographs of
MARTIN LUTHER KING, | MUHAMMED ALI azCASIUS CLAY. Copies
of the publication "Muhammed Speaks" and other literature
of the National of Islam (Nor) are available in this office.
Additionally, there is indication that a representative of .
the NOI in Baltimore has been in contact with SCLC represen-
tatives here.

it is recalled that in 1566, KING and ELIJAH
MUHAMMED were not able to resolve their differences at a
widely publized meeting of the two.
ty At the present time, the SCLC is making very poor
. progress in either getting organized, finding sufficient
, kpeople with funds to"back the project, and in general
finding enough residents in Baltimore to go along with the
idea of such @ march. “Again according to our source, the
leaders of the SCLC here are talking of picking a particu-
lar area of the City of Baltimore and concentrating on that
area to gain support with the thought that thereafter to

DATE OF. LASSIFICATION INDEFINTE.
Chicago has carefully reviewed the Nation o (en (Nor)
file concerning the suggestion in referenced airtel c (eee
publicity circulated - to possibly embarrass Washington Spring
Project (WSP) efforts in Baltimore through a suggested alliance
between forces of MARTIN LUTHER KING and the NOI. Additionally,
highly placed NOI sources at Chicago, specifically €
the latter of whom was not available “until 3. 20/68,
were also Sontacted Vite connection and the matter was indirect].
pursued with them. (x3 toe :

By way of background, as the Bureau is aware, KING and
ELIJAH MUHAMMAD, head of the NOI, met briefly in Chicago during
2/66 under amicable.circumstances, primarily as a result of MARTIN
LUTHER KING's then recent entry onto, the Chicago civil rights scene
The neeting produced no tangible results insofar as cooperation, -
unity or program was concerned, however, did receive considerable
local publicity. The meeting was basically for the purpose of
showing unity within the Negro community. kt |

KING suffered no adverse publicity as a result of this
,meeting although within several days MUHAMMAD, at an annual NOI
; Convention, made remarks critical of KING for being too close to

the white man. In reaction to these remarks publicly, KING
glossed over this criticism and to some degree capitalized on it,
indicating that in his efforts to build unified support for the
cause of the Negro, he was in contact with all segments of Negro -
opinion, Indeed, as recently as 8/67, MUHAMMAD indicated a desire
to again meet with KING to discuss the unity of the Negro.

As the Bureau and Atlanta are aware, KING and CASSIUS
CLAY were in personal contact in Louisville, Kentucky, in 5/67,
in the course of open housing demonstrations held under SCIC
auspices, A Chicago. NOI source has advised that the meeting was
not pre-arranged, but resulted from the fact that both KING and
CLAY were in Louisville at the same time, HERBERT MUHAMMAD, son
of ELIJAH, desired to enlist KING's support for CLAY in his
resistance to the draft and arranged this meeting, which was
characterized as full of joking and horseplay.

In subsequent newspaper publicity concerning this meeting,
KING was quoted as having praised CLAY for his refusal to be 7
inducted into the armed forces, coupling this reference to attacks
on our policy in Vietnam, The NOI publication "Muhammad Speaks”
was one of the papers which contained KING's favorable remarks,
including a comment that CIAY had given up $1,000,000 in order
to stand up for what his conscience dictated as right.

In short it would appear generally to be true that
contact between KING and the NOI is not a heretofore unknown happening
and it would appear that any effort to utilize this situation in
Ralti:ve-must indicate more than casual associations or contacts,
but.in order to embarrass or inhibit WSP efforts should indicate a
close working relationship or partnenship between the two groups,

It should be kept in mind also, however, that as the
above sources note, although CIAY is nationally known for his
adherance to the NOI, he is also somewhat universally acclaimed
and embraced by most grouvs within the Black Nationalist Movement,
CORE and SCC as examples, as well as the black community generally
and bas achieved somewhat the status of a martyred black folk hero.

RACIAL INTELLIGENCE

WORMIWN

: BAAS

I have considered this matter, discussed it with
appropriate agent and supervisory personnel of the Mobile
Office and the following is proposed as a counterintelligence
move on KING's Washington Spring Project.

ty : KING has quite a following in and around the Selma,

de Ala. area and has appeared recently in Selma on one occasion

‘ at the church of Reverend L. L. ANDERSON, who, at the time of

{ KING's appearance, was running for mayor of Selma, ANDERSON

: was tentatively endorsed by KING and was subsequently defeated
in his race for mayor of Selma. :

7 Reverend FREDERICK DOUGLAS REESE, who is head of
c the Dallas County Voters Teague and 1s quite influential among
the Negro community in the Selma area, did not endorse ANDERSON,
for mayor and informed sources indicate he more orzless con-
tributed to the defeat of ANDERSON, REESE has been known to
make derogatory remarks concerning KING and was allegedly
miffed that KING did mot advise him, REESE, of his, KING's,
contemplated visit to Selma. ce

In view of the above, it is felt that if some
method can be devised whereby REESE can be advised of certain
items relative to the Washington Spring Project, he would take
action to discourage individuals from participating therejn. a

i : It is, therefore, proposed that an anonymous letter
- pide directed to REESE at his home addréss, 1566 Range, Selma,
ieee “Alabama 36701, wherein 1t 1s called to the attention of REESE
“ that KING is merély using the Negroes of the Selma area for
- his own personal aggrandizement; that he is not. genuinely _~
“interested in their welfare, but only in their donations; that
an all probability the individuals geing to Washington for
‘the Spring Project will be left stranded without suitable
-, ‘housing or food, The letter should also play up the possib:
-- ty of violence, particularly the fact that although CARMICE .
- and BROWN of SNCC have a so-called gentlemens' agreement with
KING not to take over‘this action, there exists a strong
~ possibility that such will occur. There is also the possibili~
‘ty of RAM and NOI taking over the project since it lacks -
“. organization and direction, The letter should-ailso point out
«, that KING was in Alabama on about 3/21/68, and did riot make . -
‘ his. schedule in the Selma and adjoining counties area, which
+1. was another indication that KING was irene out of both sides
“:, of his mouth.” a eee

It is felt that this letter shoula be matled from
either Washington or Baltimore since, if the letter is mailed
from anywhere in the south, REESE may feel it is the work of ~
the Klan or some other racist group, “It 1s felt that Baltimore
would probably be the best since a letter from Washington would _
indicate the possibility of the government doing this. :

It 4s felt the above considerations can
be exploited to cause confusion in the efforts of KING
and his group, and to cause Negro dissatisfaction with
his operating procedures, This could be accomplished
by the following:

1) When KING is actually to .
be at a gathering, have informants circulate false in-
formation as to time, date and~tocation of KING's ap-
pearance, or variations of each, i.e., correct time and
place, but different location, correct location, but
different date, et cetera. -

2) Have informants circulate
information that KING is to be at announced local meet-
ings of SCLC groups when, in fact, he will not be present.

: . 3) Announce, through informant,  ,
when KING is to’ be at specific place, that this is only a
guise to draw a crowd, and only local leaders will be
present, excluding KING.

B, KING and his top aides dress expen-
sively, generally travel via first class means, and
stay at first class accommodations usually in predomi-
nately white areas’ of cities he visits. Recently, in
Memphis, KING ran from his followers when violence erupted
during a march he was leading there. It is felt the above
two considerations could be linked to discredit KING and
his aides with poor Negroes who he is seeking support from.
This could be accomplished by the preparation of a flyer
‘showing photographs of KING and aides dressed well, next
to photographs of Negroes poorly clothed; under the photo-
graph would be data concerning his expensive tates, ac-
commodations, use of private airplane, and related data;
with this information would be information concerning

KING's deserting his followers during the Memphis riots.

The key note message would be that KING and his aides

are out for their own financial and physical welfare
primarily. Flyers could be prepared from newspaper
photographs of KING and tis aides, or from some photo-

graphs available at various field offices. Distribution
could be by anonymous mailings to poor Negro leaders, .

or by placement of copies at Negro meeting places by 7
informants,

This group has discouraged its members

from associating with whites. Information has been de-
veloped that some leaders and top functionaries, since
the establishment of this policy, have periodically
maintained close associations,to include residing with
white girl friends. Information concerning these asso-
ciations could be capitalized on by counterintelligence -
measures to show the hypocrisy of these leaders and to
discredit the individuals involved with their new "Black
only" oriented associates in the same organization, and
to discredit them with leaders of other Black ‘Nationalist

Specifically, efforts could be undertaken

to obtain photographs of the principals involved with

their white girl friends. The flyer could then. be ‘pre-

. For example, in a detailed docuzent prepared on Corsunist -
Party and the Negro in 1953, we find the statement referring to
Taalure of the Communist Party to attract even a significant a
of Negroes in the United States to its nunber." Another example is
to be found in an analysis in this same field prepared by the Burea -
{ 1956 to the effect that communist efforts have been “unsuccessful
- & State or national level" in infilfcating "legitinate Negro-
fraternal, protest and improvement organizatious," although they mace 7
>. ited success in some “isolated chapters." The Director's book, .
Masters of Deceit, published in 1958, states: “It became obvious
that the varty, Gespite great efforts, had failed to win over ever a
a significant minority of Negroes." In 1960 the Director's statement 1
to’The Committee on the Judiciary, United States Senate; reads:
"It is no secret that one o1 the bitterest disappointments of
communistic efforts in this Nation has been their failure to lure
our Negro citizens into the Party." In 1952 similar public statement
were made. On page seven of the Brief subnitted to the Director
under the date of August 23, 1963, this historical positicn was
restated and it was said, "One of the bitterest disappointments of

the communists kas beén their single failure to lure any significant j
number of our Negro citizens into the Party." This statement was v

reason to assume that it is the correct position at this time, as .

“I would like to set forth here briefly why I think that
e Bait SAC Letter, which was returned to us by the Director,

ould be sent to a field eee ly Tiempmpowwemniatedtiag,S *

earthed’ by our field offices, and will not be unless we .
llow up this matter evermore closely with them. Hy second
ason why I think the SAC Letter should be sent is related

the present changing situation inthe Communist Party - Negro
lations area, During the past two weeks in particular there
ve been sharp stepped-up activities on the part of communist ~
ficials to infiltrate and to dominate Negro developments in
pis country. Further, they are meeting witn successes. This
hould be no surprise to us because since the Negro march on
x ngton on August 28 communist officials have been doing all
seible to exploit the very troubled racial situation. As
cc said weeks ago, the end of the Negrg march would be the
& aning of evermore systematic activities on their part to
metrate and influence kegroes and Negro leaders. They are

in full force acting upon this intention of theirs expressed
reeks ago. The field should be alerted to this fact and given
structions to investigate exhaustively new communist ~ Negro -
tivities. The SAC Letter in question will be a great help
pward this end, and it should result in our developing important
cts relating to the current changes and pertinent activities
oing on during the past few weeks in this entire field.

Howard Zinn, the author of the report for the Southern Regional
Council, was mentioned in my memorandum [1/15/62 and has been the subject
of a security investigation by this Bureau (100-360217). Zinn was reportedly
a member of the CP from 1949 throuzh 1953 and attended CP meetings during
that period. Zinn is a history professor at Spellman College in Atlanta, I
‘was the second slanted and biased document written by Zinn on the Albany
situation. cpa = :

Reverend Mr. King is the ‘President of the Southern Christian . |

On 9/10/ 3&m advised that on the 2fternoon of that date -
Clarencé Jones, 2 member of the Labor Youth League in 1954 (a cited organization)
and Levison were discussing burning of churches in the South, both expressed the -
opinion that King should not be silent in this matter but should send a hot wire to -
"Kennedy" expressing his indigfiance at the Government's failure to control one
small community, ‘This was furnished to the Attorney General on 9/L/ mY

RECOMBIENDATION: °

Consideration has been given to contacting King to straighten him out;
however, this seems undesirable in view of the above facts and it is recommended :
he not be contacted,

The hackground informa fion regarding King, Tevison and a Finn has
been furnished to the J Department. -

Nothing would seem to be gained by contacting the "New York Times”
or the "Atlanta Constitution" as we obviously cannot give them background Sata
we possess on the CP influence of King, (® uw

. The Department and the Attorney General have been publicly _
criticized on many occasions by King and yet they are cooperating with him,

had other lethal weapons such as knives, -

Lieutenant Arkin advised that at approximately 1:20
P.m,., March 28, 1968, the Memphis Transit Authority which
operates the Memphis City Bus Systea, after receiving numerous
complaints from its bus drivers that they feared for their
personal well being due to the disorder, coupled with the -
fact that many of them had been individually robbed in the
past, decided as a safety measure to stop the movement of
City Buses for the remainder of March 28, 1968,

The Memphis Commercial Appeal" Newspaper, issue of
March 20, 1968, in a front-page story, by an unidentified
writer, reported that many of the looters and window breakers
were black power advocates, and that several wore jackets of
the "Invaders," 2 local black power group, This story did
not give any basis for its statement to this effect, :

On March 28 and 29, 1968, source one and source
two, along with Lieutenant B, H., Arkin, 211 of whom are
familiar with many phases of the black porer movement

cee in Memphis, Tennessee, advised that a small group of the BOP

- Zollowers have put the word "Invaders" on their jackets but

that many high school age students have done this for effect
And are not necessarily affiliated with the BOP movement,

~ Sources one and two, along with Arkin, added that -
thus far there is no evidence that any of the BOP group

their actions, that the looting was not organized as such, : ~
He observed that in his opinion approximstely 1 per cent .
of the rarchers engaged in looting and-violence and.that ...
wany of these were people who were criminally inclined
and- who had been in previous trouble, He stated that :
in bis many years of experience he would say that probably
the first breaking of the first window was enough to set
off the crowd which had been emotionally worked up by :
its long wait for the start of the sarch and by the general :

In regard to SNCC, WFO is probing for weaknesses which
may be uncovered through sources in endeavoring to ascertain the
identity of individuals who may be dissatisfied because of
personality clashes and/or those who may be disenchanted with
volunteer services for SNCC and have sought a salary; and those
who may be suspect of "working for the man", i. e., suspect of
being an informer. : -

In regard to STOKELY CARMICHAEL, WFO has carefully _ -
considered him from a counterintelligence standpoint since his
arrival in WDC to take up residence in January, 1968. However,
no positive program has been developed due to the fact that the
sedition investigation has been under active consideration from
a prosecutive standpoint, and it was felt that a simultaneous
counterintelligence program if operational against CARMICHAEL
might tend to aggravate possible future prosecution and possibly
lead to embarrassment, WFO feels that a positive counterintelli-
gence program would be warranted against CARMICHAEL, especially
in the absence of any prosecutive action against him. In
assessing CARMICHAEL for potential counterintelligence, WFO has
concluded that to be effective, such a program must discredit
him in the Negro community where he enjoys considerable popu-
larity, and would seemingly have to be stronger than alleged immoral
or un-American political inclinations,

Concerning the Southern Christian Leadership Conference
(SCLC) and the Washington Spring Project (WSP) office in WDC,
sources who are familiar with SCLC operations have been instructed
to look for opportunities to plant seeds of ciscontent and
dissension between the SCLC and the American Friends Service
Committee (AFSC) workers there, particularly in the realm of
funds; and to give rise to rumors that KING seems to be getting
the lion's share of the funds, whereas the AFSC and the poor
people who are to participate are getting little or nothing
in the way of financial aid, It has been developed that WSP
recruiter J. T. JOHNSON, since transferred, was at the center
of a controversy concerning dissension in the office. WFO is
in the process of developing further plans exploiting this
dissension.

WFO 157-1292

With regard to MARTIN LUTHER KING, WFO will continue
to be alert for all possibilities to secure information of value
in counterintelligence and for use in the program, It is felt,
however, that the office of origin in this matter is in a better
position to fully evaluate and be aware of possibilities to
exploit in this program, -

There is no organized Revolutionary Action Movement
(RAM) activity in the WDC area which has risen to the surface;
however, in the event any situation should arise which would
lend itself to a counterintelligence move, steps will be taken
to fully pursue that matter. :
7 A source has advised that the Congress of Racial

Equality (CORE) is not currently active in WDC; that it has
no organizational structure or planned program of activity.
CORE has held no. meetings in the past year.

WFO is also looking for opportunities to develop
positive information concerning H. RAP BROWN in this area in
order to possibly effect a workable counterintelligence operation.

5) As noted above, WFO will continue to exploit all
possibilities and opportunities to institute a successful
counterintelligence program on the mentioned targets and upon
the formulation of a specific plan on any particular organiza-
tion or individual, will submit same by separate letter for
the Bureau's approval.

With reference to Bulets of 3/18/68 and 4/2/68, in
the above caption outlining counterintelligence situations
with reference to SNCC and the Black United Front, these matters
will be taken up by separate letters to the Bureau.
