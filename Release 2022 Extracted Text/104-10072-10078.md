MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: "American Defectors to the USSRi

The atlached material was part of a soft file entitled

"American Deirctors to the USSt", which was set up by SR/6

(Support) around 1950 and maintained by various SR components

until ca, 1963.

The compilations were dorived from a varicty

of sources, and contain both classified and overt data.

In the fall uf 1966, the files were turned over to Ci

Stall.

in most instances, basic inforrnation was then abstracted

for the US Defector Machine Program. In all instances in which

the material was unique, or represented a valuable colintion effort,

it has been incorporated into the appropriate 201 file, along with

a copy of this rocmorandum.

3. lt is suggested that any dissemination of this data should

be coordinated with SB Division and wirh CI Staff (CI/MRO), in

view of the frequently inadequate sourcing and of the fact that!

disseminations have already been made through the US Defecio?
