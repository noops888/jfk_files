Seven of us have already left the Country. I don't want to be expelled,

"They"

have doubled the "Vigllancia", It's better for you not to show for meeting if'

sanething happens,

I don't vant to put you in Danger." BAKULIN said there

possibility that alternate Soviet would meet LINIB-l, usirg name of Nikolas.

LINEB•1 suggested tbat if subject working so hard he must have gotten a Promotion.
