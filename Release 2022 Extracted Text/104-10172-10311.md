1, On 18 February the undersigned wae invited to lunch by Grigoriy
Yo. GOLUB. The first overture was made by Colub during a Consular Corps
lunch lenen-on 12 February. Following this lunch, the group divided up
into smallor tables of seven or eight for coffee and cognac. Golub came
directly to Costille's table where the Canadian Vice Consul, the British
Vice Consul and two Finne were already sitting, Hie first words were
directed to Costille, Golub stated that he would like to invite Costille
to lunch some time but understood that it was against regulations for
Americans tc socialize with Soviets, He cited as an example the former
American Vice Consul's constant refusal to lunch with him. Costille
responded that this was a personal thing and that all Golub had to do was
to ask him, Golub pronised that he would, A call was received on 16
February, and the date was set for 1200 hours on 18 February.

2. The lunch lasted for three hours and took place at the Adlon
Restaurant, which 4s one of Golub's favorite restaurants in Helsinid. We
will report the whole conversation for whatever it is worth. As Golub
will have to sign Costille's visa to the USSH, Costille mentioned that he
was shortly (February 28th) planning a trip to Moscow and Leatngrad on a
guided tour and would like any advice Golub had as to the best restaurants
and night spots to visit in these cities, Golub said that he was aware of
Costille's trip, as his visa request had to pase through him. He stated
that it was an excellent idea for Costilie to go to the Soviet Union, and
gave him two or three restaurants in each city. He again brought up the
dssue of Anericans abroad refusing to have contact with Soviets, He stated
that he understood our feeling because of the Hungarian incident, but felt
that this was a long time ago and should be forgotten. He, felt the more
the Soviets and Americens Brow, ether the better off *Ghole world would
be. He cited as an example é. -AWNEE/3 tripy, (See OFHA}3748, para 3,
6 Feb. 1959) He then proceeded to AP ANE? ESD to Costille and asked if
Costille had met her before, Costille answered that he had once or twice
at Embassy functions, as he had all Fulbrighters, but that he did not know
her personally, Golub was evidently very impressed with Qey37etating that
ahe knew Russian and had a sincere desire to learn more ebout the Soviet
Union, He added that the trip was expensive but (A8/3 was borrowing the
money from her parents and was planning to pay it badk once she got a job.
Golub thought her trip was an excellent thing.

3. The conversation turned to comparative Foreign Service
atated that he is allowed one paid vacation to Moscow a year. However, if
he wants to take any more vacations, he has to pay for thea himself, He

cited as an example his wife's recent trip to Moscow where she visited her
ick mother, This he personally had to psy for, as they had already used
up their one paid vacation. Golub stated he could not afford a car and

that he had to pay for his apartment out of his salary and was not given a
rent dllowance. (The Golubs still have no children but are very desirous

of having a fantly.)

4. Golub was quite proud of his war record during the Second World
War, He then stated what a terrible thing it would be to have another war
because of nuclear weapons. fie felt that the Scviet Union end the U.S.,
even with different systems, cculd find a way to live together peacefully.

5. During the lunch Golub made a rusber of references to the amount
of work he had and complained that he cid rot have more help at the Soviet
Consulate, He stated thet his enly msle assistant vas Lrubinov (evidently
Mikhail Petrovich Lyubimov) who was only in the Consulate-part time. He
stated that this was Lyubimov's “rst cssigment outside of the USSR and
that he was quite young and naive, though very intelligent, Lyubimov
speaks Snglish and Swedish, Golub stated that Lyubinov was quite shy. and
was apprehensive. about going out and meeting peorle. Golub stated that
Lyubinov had a fiancee in Moscow end appeared quite lonely here without

her.

6, Golub is extremely congenial end likeable and enjoyed playing the
part of the host. His Finnish is excellent and he claims to know no English,
However, when Costille was having difficulty with Finnish, Golub was able
to put these English words into Finnish, Ye picked up the tab for the meal
but undoubtedly will be reimbursed as he put the bill into his pocket,

74 when Costille appeared worried stout getting his visa in time for
the trip on 28 February, Golub stated mot to worry that he would personally
see that the visa cane through in time. Golub phoned Costille cn Saturday
at the Exbassy to tell him that all the visas of the Anericans making the
trip were returned from Moscow approved. He stated thet ne hed made a phone
call to Noscow requesting they hurry the visas up, Otherwise, we would have
never received our vises in time, accoréing to Goltb. Golub then invited
Costille to be his guest at the Soviet-~Finnish ice hockey gene in Helsinkd
on 22 February, Costille accepted, Nothing of importance was done or seid
at the game except that Golub apreared guite upset when the Finns around
him cheered whenever a Soviet player fel! or was knocked downs

8. Golub phoned Costille on 26 Febrvery wanting Costille to have lunch
again with him before his departure to Moscow on 22 Fetruzry. Costille de-
clined because of previous engagments. Golub wished Costille a pleasant
