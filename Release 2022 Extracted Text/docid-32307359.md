above informants have been known to furnish reliable

information in the past and have been in a position to

furnish information concerning CIVELLO's activities.

ADMINISTRATIVE DATA

This case has been carried in a pending inactive

status pending

action on subject's appeal of conviction in

USDC, SDNY and due to the subject's limited activity during 1960.

The Bureau advised on 1/26/61 that ön 1/23/61

NY-3123-C* advised a "Commission" controls organized crime

in Canada and the United States, that the underworld in

Canada and

the United States is

operated in each state by a

"boss" and "underboss" who answer to this "Commission".

Informant named JOE CIVELLO as boss in Texas and stated that

he presently answers to MICHELINO CLEMENTE, top hoodlum,

New York Division, having previously answered to ALBERT

ANASTASIA before he was murdered.

The Bureau pointed out CIVELLO as one of the top

powers in an important segment of the criminal element.

He apparently

is in a position to arbitrate underworld

desputes and assist in making and enforcing a policy

involving important criminal matters.

In view of this,

it is apparent that continuous investigation should be

conducted concerning CIVELLO's contacts, associates,

finances and activity.
