from (ey) containing his reporting of an alle-
gation that Lee Harvey Oswald was in New York
City in the Winter of 1962, having contact with
a Cuban.

(Attached to instant memorandum, Tab A, is
a copy of fliiley"S) original report, and attendant

There is no evidence in the (BBB files! or
the file of the source (7 ysEGgeniovAbascal:
(@ESsrensuer)}, #750643, that this pformation

was processed out of the Office of Security/
Security Research Staff, to which fabcy, reported
the information. However, as@imbley' states in
the report: “I urged fMeescat to go to the FBI
with the information, and offered to arrange a
meeting. He promised to tell them the story,
and made contact through an agent (O'Brien)
whom he knew because of past activities."

Regarding fAWaSscal, his Office of Security
file contains the following concerning his
veracity: ~*~

Office of Security/Security Research
Staff memorandum dated 15 August 1966:
ngpascal has for several years furnished
information to SRS source which has been
proven to be utterly worthless and
usually fictitious."

Office of Security/Security Research
Staff memorandum dated 19 May 1965:
“(@SSSeal) has furnished source with
intelligence information which appears
to be complete fabrication."

FBI letterhead memorandum dated

30 September 1963 captioned "Movimiento
Democrata Cristiano (MDC)" contains the
following statements about (ABaSCAal’ by
FBI sources: "One would only. have to
know Enmi'que ascal'to know that this
(a Life magazine article) was nothing
put a publicity stunt on his part and
that he has no importance whatsoever in
the anti-Castro Movement." "Sometimes
in dealing with @ascal, one does not
imow whether or not he should pity him
or try to afford him soma kind of medical
assistance." ‘"M@ascal) is merely a pub-

licity seeker." RECEIVED FROM

It is apparent the office of Security/
Security Research Staff had _reason to
question the veracity of (iu: 3? precluding
further dissemination of the information;
and that there was.a reason to believe
that Miegeal would report the information
to the FBI for their action.

Arlington House, Publishers

The files contain a Taw, unevaluated
report from @ifiiley) containing his reporting
of an allegation that CIA had partial
control of, and once attempted full control
of, Arlington House, Publishers.

(Attached _to instant memorandum, Tab B,
is a copy of (ays) original report as well
as copies of attendant documents. The files
contain no further clarification of the
information.)

There is no Office of Security subject
file in the name of Arlington House or
Arlington House, Publishers.

From other sources, it would appear
that Arlington House, Publishers is con-
nected with the conservative causes of
William F. Buckley and the National Review.
Buckley is a former Agency employee an
his close connections with former Agency
employee EB. Howard Hunt have recently
received extensive publicity. It is
believed that numerous former Agency
employees are Linked with Buckley's causes, :
and this could be the foundation for the
rumored Agency involvement in Arlington

House. RECEIVED FROM

Information from

@ i Ro: LEZ HARVSY OSWALD. (RUNSEET) met Oswald last winter
in Greenwich Village, New York City at the "Fat Bleck

Pussy Cat" (which was much less expensive than it is

now, with fewer tourists). QABH8eaN saw him there several

times with extreme leftist, peacenik types. He seemed
to be 2 "loner", but did associate with a couple in
their early thirties, (See below.)

The last time that @MBHScaLr'saw Oswald he got into a
tion with him, end it almost ended in a fight.
lost his temper and wanted to hit Oswald be-
cause of his strong communist position. He was very
anti-U.S.A., pro-Castro and pro-Chinese Heds (but not
pro-Soviet Union).
What interested (Abascal: most was that Oswald hed no job
but still had sufficient money.

Tne couple Oswald associated with were quiet, but during
political discussions the man would feed Oswald key words
or bits of information when he was backed into a corner,

(Note. I urged (Ba ito_go to the FBI with the information, _
~smd-of Pereato-EPTUNES-@ Hestine. He promised to tell: ‘then (By

the story, and made contact through en agent (O'Brien) whom
he Imew because of past’ activities.)

a
@ Sources from inside Cuba have rkported that HERBERT MATTHEWS

. and two Russians met with Fidel Castro several months aga
and tried to convince him to step down in favor of a coalition
gov't, that Khrushchev and Kennedy had agreed on, Castro
refused to consider it, (Some Cubans think that Castro is
behind the Kennedy assassination - that he was acting to
block this deal which was to take effect before the 196k.
election.)

In early Dec. (see memo on my telephoned report for exact
date )@ADESCaT) revorted that CARLOS FRANKE of the Castro

publication "Revolution" was at Idlewild Airport. He had
arrived on flight 509 of BCAC from Paris & London, Franke

had just finished a trip behind the Iron Curtain.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD:

SUBJECT

#343 589

A memorandum dated 12 March 1970 seems to pinpoint
the time period during which @@MBEVifirst made available to this
office a copy of Howard HUNT's manuscript, "Give Us This Day,"
as being early March 1970. The memorandum from@iyalnamy
QHEUEEIGAN to C/SRS advised that (BBY) had telephoned from
home that afternoon and had asked if we had received the copy ”
of/Hunt Ms." @NGMERIGAN told Q@MEEY that it had come in and
i WEEE] asked whether he should attempt to determine any more
@ details concerning the origin of it. @UMM@IGAN suggested that
QBN do nothing until we advised him, (AlthoughM@iMMIGAN:’
referred to it as the "Hunt Ms,'' in his memorandum, it would
seem that (W#iSEx was not aware of the true authorship, at this
point). QQgEBEY, expressed concern for his friend in the publish-
ing house, who had "'filched" the Ms., as he allegedly had
informed Qian vi to be very careful with it. BV
that he informed EjgneEY. that in all probability no decision would
be made on this for another three or four weeks.
