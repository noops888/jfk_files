There is no evidence in the Miley

files or

the file of the source, Enrique Eugenio Abas call

(Cy Be renguer)), #730643, that this intormation

was processed out of the Office of Security/

Security Research Staff, to which Wiley reported

the information.

as Wiley states in

the report:

urged Abascal to go to the FBI

with the information, and offered to arrange a

meeting. He promised to tell them the story,

and made contact through an agen't (0'Brien)

whom he knew because of past activities."

Regarding Abascal, his Office of Security

file contains the following concerning his

veracity:

::

Office of Security/Security Research

Staff memorandum dated 15 August 1960:

"Abascal has for several years furnished

Information to SRS source which has been

proven to be utterly worthless and

usually fictitious."

Office of Security/Security Research

Staff memorandum dated 19 May 1965:

"(Abascal) has furnished source with

intelligence information which appears

to be complete fabrication."

FBI letterhead memorandum dated

30 September 1963 captioned "Moviniento

Democrata Gristiano (MDC)" contains the

following statements about Abagcall by

FBI SOUrCES:

"One would only have to

know Enrique Abascal to know that this

(a Lite magazine article) was nothing

but a publicity stunt on his part and

that he has no importance

whatsoever in

the anti-Castro Movement."

"Sometimes

in dealing with Abascal,

one does not

know whether or not he should pity him

or try to afford him some kind of medical

assistance."

"Abascall is

merely a pub-

licity seeker."

## Page 5

It is apparent the Office of Security/

Security Research Staff had reason to

question the veracity of AbasCall precluding

further dissenination of the information;

and that there was a reason to believe

that Abescal would report the information

to the FBI for their action. •

Arlington House, Publishers

The files

contain a raw, unevaluated

report fron Wiley] containing his reporting

of an allegation that CIA had partial

control of, and once attempted full control

of, Arlington House, Publishers.

(Attached to instant memorandum, lab B

1s a copy of@Miley's original report as well

as coples of attendant documents.

The files

contain no further clarification of the

information.)

There is no Office of Security subject

file in the name of Arlington House or

Arlington House, Publishers.

From other sources, it would appear

that Arlington House, Publishers is con-

nected with the conservative causes of

William F. Buckley and the National Review.

Buckley is a former Agency employee and

his close connections with former Agency

employee E. Howard Hunt have recently

received extensive publicity.

It is

believed that numerous former Agency

employees are linked with Buckley's causes,

and this could be the foundation

for the

rumored Agency involvement in Arlington

House

Ro: LEE HARVEY OSWALD. Abascal, met Oswald last winter

in Greenwich Village,

New York City at the "Fat Black

Fussy Cat" (which was much less expensive than it is

nor, with fewer tourists). Abascal saw him there several

times with extreme leftist, peacenik types. He seemed

but did associate with a couple in

The last time that (Abascal saw Oswald he got into a

conversation with him, and it almost ended in a fight.

Abascal, lost his temper and wanted to hit Oswald be-

cause of his strong communist position. He was very

pro-Castro and pro-Chinese Reds (but not

what interested (Abascal most was that Oswald had no job

but still had sufficient money.

The couple Oswald associated with were quiet, but during

political discussions the man would feed Oswald key words

or bits of information when he was backed into a corner.

(Note. I urged Abascall to go to the FBI with the information,

and offered to arrange a meeting. He promised to tell them

the story, and made contact through an agent (0'Brien) whom

he knew because of past

activities.)

Sources from inside Cuba have reported that HERBERT MATTHEWS

and two Russians met with Fidel Castro several months ago

and

tried to convince hin to step down in favor of a coalition

govit. that Khrushchev and Kennedy had agreed on. Castro

refused to consider it. (Some Cubans think that Castro is

behind the Kennedy assassination - that he was acting to

block this deal which was to take effect before the 1964

election.)

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD:

#343 589

A memorandum dated 12 March 1970 seems to pinpoint

the time period during which Wil EXifirst made available to this

office a copy of Howard HUNT's manuscript, "Give Us This Day,"

as being early March 1970. The memorandum from willamy

MILLIGAN to C/SRS advised that WILEY had telephoned from

home that afternoon and had asked if we had received the copy !.

off Hunt Ms. " MittICAN told wise.? that it had come in and

WILEY asked whether he should attempt to determine any more

details concerning the origin of it. MILLIGAN suggested that

WILEY do nothing until we advised him. (Although MiLLiCAN

referred to it as the "Hunt Ms."' in his memorandum, it would

seem that Wil EY. was not aware of the true authorship, at this

point). Wa

EX expressed concern for his friend in the publish-

ing house, who had "filched" the Ms., as he allegedly had

informed WilEY to be very careful with it. MILLICAN advised

that he informed Wilty that in all probability no decision would

be made on this for another three or four weeks.

In June 1970 when I was assigned to thello/sks, thereas a copy of Hurt's

manuscript on the Bay of Pigs being retained in a safe in the C/s00Bl's office.. Sone

time later I leamed that Unsel had apparently obtained it through a contact and

had forwarded/to thes office...as an iten of probable interest. The Agency was able

to ascertain the identity of the author, who turned out to be howard HuNt.

HUNT

was, I believe, at that time enployed by the Agency with DeU. In any case, he was

suproached under some guise and was convinced that it would be incopropriate for him

to have the book published at ahat time. HUNT's file probably contains details

which do not appear in old ips records reduley. I believe some time later, 075.3
