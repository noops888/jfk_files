MEMORANDUM FOR: 0/SA/DO/O
Attention: Mr. Shepanck

FROM: William F. Donnelly
Chief, Information Services Staff

SUBJECT: House Select Committee on Assassinations
Request for Information on 201 Criteria (S)

REFERENCE: OLC 78-0070/19, 23 February 1978

1. (S) With reference to the conversation of

27 February between Mr. Shepanck and Mr. Cleffi of ISS,

: attached are copies of DOKHB 70-1-1, 15 November 1974,

: and an earlier version, CSHB 43-1-1 dated 15 February 1960.

i A close study of the list of questions submitted by the

7 HSCA Staff has led us to conclude that the most complete
and effective way to respond would be by inviting the
Staff to review our regulation governing the criteria for
opening, maintaining, controlling and closing 201 files
by the Operations Directorate. A careful reading of the
regulation provides an answer to every question posed by
the Staff.

2.  (S) The earlier version of the regulation is
included to reflect the situation as it existed in the
period of their primary concern (1958-1964). The later
version provides an expansion, clarification and refinement
of the earlier versions.

ANNEX B
THE 201 SYSTEM

Rescission: Annex B of Chapter III, CSHB 70-1-1; 27 October 1966

1, INTRODUCTION

‘The 201 system provides a method for identifying a person of specific in-
terest to the Operations Directorate and for control!ing and filing all pertinent
information about that person. The system also provides a means for identifying
subjects of 201 files from various categories of information about them and for
producing lisits of 201 personalities according to those categories. Only a rela-
tively small number of personalities indexed are of sufficient interest to justify
opening a 201 dossier. These are normally subjects of extensive reporting and
CT investigation, prospective agents and sources, memibers of groups and organi-
zations of continuing target interest, or subjects on whom a volume of corre-
spondence has accumulated.

2 THE 201 SYSTEM
‘The principal features of the 201 system are:

a The 201 Number: a unique number, ie., 201-1231567, assigned to each
individual in the system to serve as identifying file number for reporting on that
individual

b. The 201 Dossier: the official file containing the 201 opening form (Form
831) and all biographie reporting on and references to the individual, ie., per-
sonal history, current status, and prospects, iz

©. The Master 201 Record: a machine record generated by the epening of
a 201 file. This record produces the master 201 reference for the Main Index and
stores the pertinent information which may later be retrieved for special listings.

d. Main Index Master 201 Reference: this reference, printed in reply to an
Index Search Request, is printed as illustrated below. When data are absent
within the record, s.cceeding data items or lines will be moved up and the ref-
erence consolidated.

e. OF Code: a two letter symbol used in conjunction with the 201 per-
sonality records in the 201 system to record the association of an individual
with organizations or activities of operational interest. OI codes cover intelli-
gence and security service affiliation, whether staff or agent, ex known or
suspect, as well as activities of DDO interest. There are two categories of OI
codes for use by components:

(1) general OI codes (Attachment 4)

(2) OF codes assigned to a specific component for intelligence services
or other specific organizations.

‘A component may request an OI code be established by submitting a meme
orandum to the DDO/RMO through the component Records Management
Officer.

A 201 personality may be assigned two OI codes. An OI code may be assigned
when the 201 Personality File Action Request (Form 831) is initiated (see
paragraph 3b below) by filling in Box 13 or a code may be assigned or added
at a later date by a Form 831 amendment.

The 202 system has the capability of producing machine listings of 201
personalities by OI codes. For example, if an Ol code has been opened for the
security service of a certain country a listing may be compiled of all members
of that service. s

{. 201 Machine Lists: produced from the mechanized 201 tadex, based on
names or other idcatifying information of personalities on whom 201 dossiers
exist,

3. OPENING A 201 DOSSIER

a. General

The opening of a 201 dossier is the prerogative of an operational com- :
ponent, in coordination with the Information Services Group. An opening creates
‘& master 201 record. Changes to the master record and the occasional closing
of a 201 dossier are controlled jointly by the desks and ISG. 201 dossiers may be --
opened on persons who meet the carding criteria described in Chapter II of this
handbook, when there is a reasonable expectation that additional information
will be acquired and filed in such a dossier. Generally dossiers are opened on ,
Persons about whom counterintelligence information is being reported, and per- 1
‘sons of operational interest to the Operations Directorate, specifically those :
persons for whom provisional operational approva's and operational approvals"
are requested (sce exception below). 201 files are not to be opened on staff -
4 employees, staff agents and most categories of contract employees. Files oo

persons who are only of local interest to a field station or Headquarters desk |
and on whom no DDO records correspondence exists are not a part of the DDO j
records systém and are to be maintained by that unit. Some desks levy require. ‘
ments on ISG for automatic 201 openings on certain categories of persons whose .
ames appear in incoming dispatches. These are listed in Attachment 2 201
we dossiers should be epened in the foilowing categories:

(1) Subjects of provisional operational approval and operational ap-
proval requests. However, a file need not be opened when a POA is requested
for persons being trained for a foreign liaison service and who are of opera-
tional interest for training purposes only.

(2) Persons for whom the field requests a 201 opening.

a (3) MHFIXTURE personalities: bonafide diplomats of other than
: denied area countries, in close association with staff personnel.

(4) Subjects of a Personal Record Questionnaire Part I.

pssst (5) Persons on whom a Main Index search reveals information in five
or more documents (see DOI 70-20).

|
|
|
|

(6) Subjects of Interagency Source Register memoranda from LSN/
ISR (cpened only by IP/RMS).

b. Requesting 201 File Opening

Headgimrters desks may open a 201 file by filling out and submitting
201 Personality File Action Request (Form 831) to the Records Main-
tenance Section (IP/RMS). Form 831 is also used to create or amend the
master 201 record and 201 machine listings and to register the assign
ment of a cryptonym to a 201 personality. Attachment 3 consists of sample
201 Personality File Action Requests for opening and amending 201's. A field
station may request the opening of a 201 file by writing 201- in the Head-
quarters file or cross-reference box on the dispatch form and/or after the
subject’s name in the body of the dispatch. A telepouch request for a 201 opening
is made by indicating 201- in the file number line. A cable request is made by
placing 201- after the term “File” on the last line of the transmission. IP/AN
will open 201 files as requested by dispatch or telepouch but it is the responsi-
bility of the desk to respond to cable requests. Field stations are notified of
201 openings through receipt of the field master 201 record.

a. Purging

Purging a 201 dossier is the responsibility of the desk officer. It requires
discrimination in recognizing operationally useful material, rather than the
imple distinction between official and unofficial papers; it will therefore take
place under the supervision of a Recordi Officer, Purging should be done
Periodically. A 21 dossier being forwarded to Central Files for retention should
] be pesged. A 201 dossier should be purged of the following:

(1) Duplicate material, ie, exact copy(s) of a document.

‘i (2) Name trace form (Form 362) unless it has been the basis for
the opening. :

(3) All abstract slips,
(4) All document restriction notices (Form 1884).

8 copy of the raw report is contained in the 201 file; the Gissemination number
then must be transferred to the frst page of the rawv report,

(8) Routing slips, routing and record sheets (Form 610) and dispatch
cover sheets unless there are remarks such as coordinations or comments.

(7) Record copy documents which only repeat substantive information
contained in other documents in the file; authorization for destruction is
by the Records Officer,

the Records Officer having jurisdiction
‘over the contents of the material must possess Top Secret classification
authority. If the document cannot be downgraded the file should be Tetained
at the desk or the copy of the TS document should be removed, retained
in a desk TS file or forwarded to the Top Secret Control Officer, and a

cross-reference sheet (Form 867) placed in the 201 file giving the location
of the TS document.

(8) Deferred documents (see 5b(2)).
b. Maintenance Procedures

(1) All material in a 201 dossier wil! be filed

in document date order.
In the case of document attachments which have

been classified into a 201

dossier and separated from the basic document by the assignment of a slash
number, the attachment will be filed by the date of the basic document.

(2) Deferred documents will not be filed in a 201 dossier. If they are
to be retained in the dossier they should be sent to 1P/RMS for classification
into that 201.

(3) Field index cards (held by some desks) and area desk cards may
be retained in the 201 as part of a consolidation procedure. These cards
should be mounted on a full-size sheet of paper for filing in the 201.

(4) A201 dossier previously opened on a person who becomes a staff
‘employee and which contains Record Copy documents will be restricted to
the ISC/DIP unless the desk retains the restriction. ‘The dossier should be
closed if there are no Record Copy documents in it

(5) A201 opened in pseudonym should be consolidated into the true
name 201 if one exists or converted to the trie name.

(6) Field and duplicate (shadow) 201 files no longer of active interest
should be incorporated into the official 201 after the duplicate material
has been purged by the desk officer ‘and the remaining information classified
to that 201 by the Analysis Section (IP/AN).

(7) Any document with a predecessor organization cover sheet or an
OPC (Office of Policy Coordination) cover sheet from the Archives and
Disposition Section (IP/ARD) must be retumed to IP/ARD for processing
to the 201.

(8) Desk memoranda (with or without a document source number)
containing substantive or derogatory information on the subject of the 201.”
should be sent to IP/AN to be classified officially into the 201 file.

(9) An attachment which should be separated from its basic cocuinent
for inclusion in a 201 personality dossier will be forwarded with the basic
document to IP/AN for processing into the 201.

(10) To retain the P&L, RYBAT, or KAPOK sensitivity of a document
remaining in a 201 dossier being retired to Central Files, place that document
in an envelope sealed with black tape (see DOI 70-17). Any RYBAT, P&L,
or KAPOK document sent to Central Files not in a black-taped envelope will
automatically be handled as desensitized. A black-taped envelope may con-
tain only one document and must be filed in chronolosical order within the
file, If there are numerous documents cf this type the desk officer may black-
tape the entire dossier rather than individual documents (see DOI 70-10).

All standard listings are cumulative; previous editions must be destroyed
upon receipt of current editions. These listings are by their very nature extremely
sensitive compilations of information and must be given every possible safeguard.

b. Non-Standard Listings
Based on one or more of the following selection criteria:
* (1) Country of location
(2) OL codes (organization and/or intelligence affiliation)
(3) Citizenship
(4) Year of birth (plus or minus a given number of ycars)
(5) Occupation.

These selection criteria may be used singly or in combinations. For example,
a user could obtain a list of all 201 personalities who have been assigned the
OL code of XX or codes of XX, XY, or XZ. A 201 personality list could also be
produced of all persons who were born in Germany between the years 1915
and 1920, with the occuption computer specialist, who are now citizens of the
United States, located in Mexico, and who had been assigned the Ol code AA.
Note however that the listing would contain only those personalities with an
‘Ol code AA. Those persoralities with an OI code other than AA and those
with no OF code would be excluded. The requester could however ask that
Persons who have not been assigned an OI code also be included. Note also
that when retrieving lists based on occupation, the listing will be only as specific
‘as the occupation code (Attachment 1). The occupation code for a courier
covers only 2 documented courier. Some occupation codes cover more than one
occupation. For example, the occupation code CRAF covers those who practice
some trade or manual occupation, ie., carpenters, bricklayers, painters, mechanics
and electricians. If a list is requested for electricians, all others in this category
will be included in the printout. These non-standard listings may be sorted

(arranged) according to any, but not more than three, of the following keywords:

(a) Sumnaine

(b) Given name :
(ec) Date of birth

(4) Country of birth

(e) Citizenship
