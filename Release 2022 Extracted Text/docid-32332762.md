The aforementioned informant advised that ROY VEY, another
supervisory official at the North Star Cement Block Co.,

is very annoyed about questions asked of him by Internal
Revenue Service Agents and is particularly annoyed with the
fact that his interviewers want a cost of living figure

from him and found it hard to believe that his mother loaned
him the money to put into the North Star operation.

The aforementioned information concerning possible illegal
activity on the part of LA ROCCA and the employees of the
North Star Cement Block Company has been disseminated to
the Internal Revenue Service at Pittsburgh, Pa.

"ARCHIE" NELSON wants to sell the Phoenix Motel at
Monroeville, Pa., for an unknown reason. He said the heart
attack suffered by NELSON during May, 1961, is believed by:
these gamblers to have been staged to preparé a plausible
reason for him to sell a profitable business, They are
convinced the alleged heart attack is a'phony.’ According

to the informant, the same gamblers have stated that they
understand that "the boys from New Kensington" are interested
in buying the Phoenix Motel. He believes this reference :

interested in the purchase or that it will be referred to someone
