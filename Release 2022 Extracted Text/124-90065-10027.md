Despite these additions, the

As set forth in referenced teletypes,

ANGULO

upon contact by Bureau Agents on 3/23/68, advised he had

not furnished certain information attributed to himin

this document, specifically that Cuban Power is composed

of two numbered cells and the disting of members of each

cell.

In fact, ANGULO advised he had no information to

the effect this organization is composed of two numbered

cells, leading Miami to believe CIA has inadvertently

urnished misleading intormation in their attempt to round

out ANGULO's report.

ANGULO advised Bureau Agents that on Saturday,

3/16/68, he had been seated in the Camaguey Restaurant,

Miami, where he overheard a conversation among three Cuban

males

and one Cuban female seated nearby.

With the

exception of the lemale,

he was unable to furnish any

description of these individuals, stating he had not looked*

in their direction.

The female departed and he briefly

glanced at her as she passed, but he did not see her face

and would not recognize her again. He could describe

her only as a white female, of Latin appearance, who was

"tall and thin." (This is

believed to be an attempt on

his part to strengthen the later identification of her

inquired as to her identity and was told she was IRMINIA

BOUZA, former secretary of WENDELL. ROLLASON and currently

a night employee of "The Miami Herald" newspaper.

According

tO ANGULO,

all of the additional details concerning her

connection with and activities on behalf of the Cuban Power,

as well as names of Cuban Power members and sympathizers

and

other details (set out in CAS/M-2401,] were obtained by

him during this conversation.

ANGULO advised he is not acquainted with BOUZA,

MORALES, CORNILLOT or any of their associates and was

simply reporting information overheard by him on the above

occasion.

Although ANGULO claimed he was able to recall

without notes the names of all persons mentioned in this

conversation,

he was unable to recall these names at the

time of this interview and found it necessary to refer to

ANGULO'S

account number of RICARDO MORALES and he was specifically

asked if he had also been able to recall this number without

benefit of notes,

at which time he admitted this number had

been furnished by a "confidential connection" whom be refused

to identify. He was obviously upset at being pinned down

as to the source of his information and attempted to explain

his refusal to identify his source by vaguely stating he was

a friend in the bank where MORALES had maintained his account,

which is not believed to be true.

He denied his source was

OVIDIO KABA ACOSTA, stating he had never met KABA.

In connection with the above, during previous

interviews with RICARDO MORALES, it was determined MORALES

had loaned his car to KABA while MORALES was in jail. In

the trunk of his car was a box of papers containing a passport

Of BOUZA, erroneously issued under the name IRMINIA BOUZA,

and in the locked glove compartment was a bank book showing

MORALES? bank account number which was known only to him.

MORALES also indicated during these interviews that he

had placed sports-type hub caps on this car just prior

to his arrest on 2/14/68, when the car was loaned to KABA

(note reference to sports wheels in enclosure). The car

the car is in her name, she has no driver's license and has

never driven it (note reference to her having transported

explosives and Cuban Power papers in this car). Since she

was unable to drive the car, it was loaned to KABA upon

MORALES® arrest.

During a subsequent interview with MORALES, he

advised he had obtained a confession from KABA to the effect

ANGULO stated he was positive of the date of the

above conversation as 3/16/68, a Saturday.

Regarding the

identification of the "tall and thin" female-as IRMINIA

of BOUZA on the night of 3/14/68, in an attempt to locate

MORALES for interview, determined

of 3/14/68 and remained in the hospital over the weekend.

she could not have been in the Camaguey Restaurant

on 3/16/68, as claimed by ANGULO. This fact, along with

the illogicalness of ANGULO's story that he was able to

overhear and retain all names and facts set forth in this

report and his subsequent evasiveness during interview,

leads to the conclusion his story was fabricated.

It would

appear this conclusion should have been reached by CIA also (al l

It would appear

the erroneous impression the facts emanated from a knowledgeable

source.

. A great deal of information sent to Miami by CIA

is attributed to "a group of Cuban emigres trained In the

techniques of information collection, " with no attempt at

identifying the origin of the information.

Apparently, CIA,

Miami, operates several such groups, some

of which are more

reliable than others. J In most instances, it is apparent no

effort has been made

to evaluate the source or to determine

the identity of the original source of the information, causing

the Miami office to expend investigative effort in determining

the true facts... All such information furnished by CIA is (o

given official character and weight by its being placed in a

written inter-agency communication.

It is felt street gossip

in this type of

communication, particularly when this fact is readily known.
