in Miami.

did not mention names but

described one of the Americans as about six feet

four inches and weighing about 230 pounds.

4.

The Guatemalan report of the assassination plot ends

with five requests for information by President LAUGERUD:

a. Is ZIMERI still in the United States?

b. In the event ZIMERI is not in the United

States legally, deport him to Guatemala.

c. Is ZIMERI recruiting merceraries in the

United States for possible use in

Guatemala?

d. Does ZIMERI receive any kind of preferen-

tial treatment by U. S. authorities which

permit him to carry firearms, as well as

to purchase arms and ammunition for

shipment to Guatemala?

e. Any information on Robert and Gerald

HEMMING?

5.

On 19 June 1976

advised

that DDO is referring the entire matter to the FBI and State

Department.

Office of Security indices are negative in pertinent

variations of the name of ZIMERI or Robert HEMMING.

• From the name, physical description,

activity, and

alleged employment, it is apparent that Gerald Patrick HEMMINC

is identical with the subject of Office of Security file

429 229, who has been described as six-foot five, 250 pounds,

who is

a notorious mercenary and soldier of fortune and who as

of May 1975 was ostensibly employed by a private investigation

company, TEPCOL Security (Office of Security--no record) in

Miami, Florida.

Gerald Patrick HEMMING is well known to this Agency,

the Office of Security Miami Field Office, and INWAVE.

numerous occasions since at

On

least the early 1960's, HEMMING

had

clained Agency affiliation when in fact there has bear

none.

The most recent incident wherein HEMMING claimed such

affiliation was in May 1975 when he

volunteered his services

to the Drug Enforcement Administration.

Gerald Patrick HEMMING

is a long-time cohort of Frank Anthony STURGIS (SF#353 459),

aka:

Frank FIORINI, of Watergate notoriety who also has a

long-tine record of

falsely claiming Agency affiliation.

In

the late 1950's HENNING and STURGIS, both former U.S. Marines,

joined Fidel CASTRO in Cuba but returned shortly thereafter

claiming disillusionnent with the CASTRO cause.

Soon thereafter,

STURGIS Organized a group of mercenaries for Caribbean and

Central American

activities which he named the International

Anti-Communist Brigade.

(the backers of whom have never been fully established) was

named the Intercontinental Penetration Force, headed by Gerald

Patrick HENMING.

9.

For an appreciation of the possible ramifications of

a Guatemalan government expose of this assassination plot

involving HEMING, you are referred to attachments to instant

memorandum, to wit:

a memorandum by the writer dated 10 June

1975 in the name of Frank STURGIS and Everett Howard HUNT, Jr.;

and an'extract from a book published in early 1976 written by

Michael CANFIELD and Alan J. WEBERMAN.

he book coup d'etai

n America--The CIA and the Assassination of John F. kenned

is a diatribe against the Agency and attempts to link the Agency

with the assassination of President KENNEDY.

One of the major

links attempted by the authors is through Everett Howard HUNT,

JI. to Frank STURGIS to Gerald Patrick HEMMING to Loran Eugene

HALL.

Loran Eugene HALL was a member of HEMMING's Interconti-

nental Penetration Force.

Loran Eugene HALL received nationwide

publicity in 1967 when New Orleans District Attorney "Jim"

GARRISON alleged that HALL (and the Intercontinental Penetration

Force) was involved in

assassination of President KENNEDY

and that members of this unit were connected with CIA.

GARRISON

shortly thereafter dropped his interest in HALL, but it is

interesting that he did so after Gerald Patrick HEMMING and

another cohort, Robert K. BROWN, joined GARRISCN's investigation.
