F. DATE DESIGNATED AS INFORMANT
14/30/71
G. ESTIMATE OF RELIABILITY

_ There has been insufficient contact with the informant
to determine reliability. Nothing has been developed, however,
to indicate that the informant has furnished other than reliable
information.

H. EMPLOYMENT

The source is not employed at this time. He has talked
with persons at the Institute for Policy Studies (IPS), 1520
New Hampshire Avenue, N.W.', Washington, D.C., who have stated
that he is being considered for a job at IPS. These persons are
MARCUS RASKIN and ARTHUR IRWIN WASKOW. IPS, RASKIN and WASKOW
are subjects of WFO files set forth later in this communication.

The source has been employed in the past as a hospital
and medical insurance company clérical employee.

I. PAST ACTIVITIES:

The source has in the past furnished information. to

the Metropolitan Police Department (Intelligence Division and

. Second District), Washington, D.C., and the Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms Division of the. Internal Revenue Service.

The source has been in-the Washington, D.C. area,
primarily in the vicinity of Dupont Circle, for more than six
years, .

During the Spring, 1971, the source became associated
with JOHN RANKIN DAVIS (WF 100-48582) and others associated with
the planning of the May, 1971, demonstrations in Washington, D.C.
Following his association with these persons, the source began
to take part in activities held at IPS and to become acquainted
with persons at IPS such as RASKIN, WASKOW and JOANN MALONE,

WFO 137-5692

The source advised that he has never been arrested
although he has been detained by law enforcement personnel on
several occasions. A search of the files of the Metropolitan
Police Department and U.S. Park Police disclosed no record
identifiable with the source under his true name or any of his
aliases. A check of NCIC reflected no warrants for the source
under his true name or aliases.

A review of WFO indices reflects that the’ source was
the subject of WF 87-18178. Under the name JAMES R. MONROE,
the source had, during May, 1970, cashed three checks totalling
$225.00 at Charleston, West Virginia, on a bank in Washington,
D.C, The checks were returned to the Charleston Bank, Prosecu-
tion in this matter was declined on 2/23/71, by AUSA ROBERT B.
KING, Southern District of West Virginia, because the amount
of money involved and evidence available did not justify further
investigative efforts to locate and interview MERRITT.

The source explained that he had at one time cashed
several checks amounting to a little over $200 while he visited
’ Charleston, West Virginia, during the Spring, 1970. He stated
that he has made efforts to negotiate payment of these checks
_and that he has at no other time and will never again engage
in this practice.

J. IDENTIFICATION RECORD

A request for an Identification Record was made on
11/8/71. No criminal or civil file identifiable with the source
under his true name or aliases was located.

K. CRIMINAL ASSOCIATES

The source is in regular contact with a number of
persons engaged in criminal activity. He is an admitted homo-
sexual and this has brought him into contact with other homo-
sexuals who engage in various types of criminal activities. The
source has in the past furnished information concerning persons
involved in a homicide, narcotics, armed robberies, burglaries
and other crimes to the Metropolitan Police Department.

(WFOfile 100-46784)

IPS is located at 1520 New Hampshire puenaes N.W.,
Washington, D.C.

The source has furnished information concerning IPS
on a continuing basis. On 10/5/71, the source advised that he
had attended a meeting regarding prisons held at IPS on 9/21/71.
This meeting was dominated by ARTHUR: IRWIN WASKOW and JOANN
MALONE. These two persons are the subjects of WFO file
105-50397 (Bufile 105-114241), captioned ''ARTHUR IRWIN WASKOW,
SM-NEW LEFT" and WFO file 100-49419 (Bufile 454221), captioned
"JOANN MALONE, SM-NEW LEFT." The source also furnished infor-
mation on 10/6/71 concerning another meeting involving the
prison issue held at IPS on 10/5/71. This meeting, too, was
dominated by WASKOW and MALONE. °

On 10/13/71, the source advised that sometime during
September, 1971, MALONE had discussed the subject of FBI
surveillance of IPS with him. She told the source that she
and others at IPS believed the FBI was watching them from a
building across the street, from a room in the Dupont Plaza
Hotel (to the right of the IPS building) and possibly from the
building on the other side of the IPS building. It was further
believed that the IPS building was "bugged" and that the FBI
was using sophisticated electronic equipment to pick up con-
versations in and around IPS. Because of these suspicions,

~5 =

persons associated with IPS discuss important matters outside
the building.

. The source provided a description on 10/13/71 of that
part of the IPS building with which he is familiar.

On 10/20/71, the source advised that WASKOW had talked
with him about the possibility of working for IPS or persons
associated with IPS. WASKOW was not specific about the job
and during subsequent contacts the source advised that he was
having difficulty locating WASKOW at IPS and-that when he did
talk with him WASKOW was still noncommittal concerning the job.

On 11/16/71, the source advised that he had spoken
with MARCUS RASKIN at IPS, RASKIN is the subject of WF 100-45298
(Bufile 100-454040) captioned "MARCUS GOODMAN RASKIN, SM-NEW
LEFT." RASKIN told the source on 11/15/71 that the source was
being considered for a job which would involve assisting WASKOW
and others at IPS. RASKIN said that further thought was being
given this possibility and that the source should return to see
him at 1:00 p.m., 11/23/71. |

“On 11/9/ 71, the source advised that MALONE had: commented

upon the apathy toward the prison issue and the fact that a
meeting would be held on the evening of 11/11/71 to renew

interest in the issue. On 11/10/71, the source stated that

MALONE had again expressed her concern concerning lack of interest
. in the prison issue and had set forth her ideas as to what

course of action should be undertaken to better publicize and
renew interest in the issue. MALONE said that she was disappointed
in the response of the black community to the prison issue.

WFO 137-5692

Although the source has not observed nor heard anything of
SPIEGEL, it is believed that the fact that the source is
occasionally in the IPS building will enable him to be in an
advantageous position to observe SPIEGEL or any other of the

New Left fugitives should they make contact with-persons at
IPS.—

“WFO 137-5692

The information furnished by the source regarding’

IPS and persons associated with IPS has been of value as intelligence i

data. The source is one of only a few sources in a position to
furnish information concerning IPS which is described as the
"think tank" of the New Left. :

Inforniation regarding Dr. WILLIAM PIERCE and HAMILTON
MICHAEL BARRETT is of value from an intelligence standpoint
and has substantially aided the ATFD in its investigation of
possible sceaihananiil and explosives violations on the part of these
persons.

The source spends much time in many areas of Washington,
D.C., particularly Dupont Circle, and this enables him to be
observant concerning fugitives and for the matters of interest
to the Bureau. The fact that he is a homosexual permits him
to furnish information of value to the Bureau ‘concerning: --
persons in the homosexual community, and enable WFO to fulfill
its responsibilities for identifying homosexuals in government.

M. EMOTIONAL STABILITY

During contacts with this informant the informant has
exhibited no traits of emotional instability or unreliability,
nor is it known that the informant has furnished any false infor-
mation.

of these bills if the source was interested. The source —
told KING that he was not’interested but recalled that the
first four numbers of each serial number‘on the-bills were
"5152." The source also advised that he had seen KING
involved in a numbers transaction and that he gathered
from KING that KING was still dealing in numbers,

The information concerning the counterfeit bills

considered the information very reliable and valuable in
that three $20.00 counterfeit bills with serial numbers
beginning "5152" had been received very recently by the

concerning persons passing such bills before counterfeit
bills are received by the USSS and investigation to trace
then is instituted, °

for such a tactic may be made necessary by information being
developed by your office indicating that some of Davis'
associates are reporting back to him concerning FBI's inter-

You are instructed to give the foregoing studied
consideration and submit to Bureau your recommendations relat-

the possibility of traveling to New York in the immediate
future. DAVIS also mentioned that the FBI was continuing

}.
. By Paul W. Valentine
Washington Post Statt Writer

Recent disclosures by an ac-
tivist community newspaper of
police informant activities
within Washington’s once-
flourishing antiwar movement
have jeopardized political in-
itelligence gathering -opera-
tions, D.C. police officials said
yesterday.

“fhe disclosures, part of an
ongoing campaign by the anti-
establishment Daily Rag news-
paper, are “definitely a threat
to our operations,” acknowl-
edged Capt. George Sutter,
acting director of the police
department’s intelligence di-
vision.

Sutter confirmed the identi-
fication of two one-time infor-
miants named .in front-page
stories in the last two issues
of the Daily Rag.

‘The first story named Ann
Kolego, 20, also known as
“Crazy Annie,” as a paid po-
lice informant who infiltrated
the D.C. offices of the Peoples.
Coalition for Peace and Jus-
tice (CPJ) and National!
Peace Action _ Coalition
(NPAC) from ‘early 1971 to
Sune 25 of this year.

‘Sutter rated her as an~“ex-
cellent” intelligence source.
~The second story named Earl
Robert Merritt Jr., known to
police as “Butch,” who worked!
asa paid informant for about
five months around the time!
of the massive Mayday disrup-
tions here in the spring of
1971.

Merritt was quoted in the
Rag as saying he jater did in-
fformant work for the FBI. FBI
press spokesman Jack Her-
rington would not comment
on that claim, but another
‘source close to the FBI con-
firmed that Merritt performed
“voluntary” work for” the

agency and may have been
paid for it Thai

7
\

lego as. an informant was]
leaked to the Rag by a Wash-
ington-based organization
called the Committee for Ac-
tion/Research on the Intelli-
gence Community (CARIC).

CARIC spokesman Winslow
Peck said his organization is
iworking ona ae of other
pegple now,” and their names
should berevealed’soom—" |

Asked hos CARICTS able to
discover and identify infor-
mants, Peck said, “We have
contacts within the metropoli-
tan police department and
other intelligence groups in
the city.”

Capt. Sutter of the police in-
telligence division said he
does not think the information
is being leaked from his own
organization, but is not over-
looking the possibility.

Staffers at the Daily Rag,
which despite its name is a
weekly paper located at 2416
18th St. NW in the Adams-
Morgan section of the city,
have questioned the legality
and authorization for some of
the informant work done by
Merritt and Miss Kolego.

"They note, for example, that
Miss Kolego made frequent
out-of-town trips to assorted
antiwar conclaves and ques-
tioned her authority to go be-

District police intelli-
gence operatives were
keeping watch on the city’s
antiwar community and
other activists as recently
as June, according to a
former paid informant. The
surveillance began at least

two years ago, the informer

said.

Police said reports based
on informers’ information
were given regularly to the
1 BI. Some information may
have been passed to the
White House. One informer
said his tactics included
burglary and disruption of
protests.

While police officials con-
firmed the identity and in-
formant assignment of two
persons, one of whom was
interviewed by,the-—Star:
News, they Geclined to say

'-how many informants may
‘beassigned to “keeping
. Chief Jerry V. Wilson in-

+ formed on possible protest

demonstrations.

AMONG NATIONAL
* groups attracting police
attention were the Ameri-
can Academy of Political
Science, the American Civil
Liberties Union, and the
Coalition on National Prior-
ities and Goals, whose mail
solicitations for members
were signed by Sen. William
Proxmire, D-Wis.

Among local groups were
the American Nazi party,
the Black United Front, the
D.C. Statehood party and
the Institute for Policy
Studies, a “think tank” on
radical alternatives to U.S.
foreign and domestic policy,
which is located at 1520 New

atthe Sth Street office of the
Goergetown University le-
gal interns. It was called
off.

MERRITT SAID he
gained entry to the book-
store after closing hours by
taping open the lock on a
foyer door. He took antiwar
petitions, pamphlets, meet-
ing notices and other mate-
rials and give them to police
contacts who told him they
would be a source of names
of persons and groups in the
protest community, Merritt
said.

According to Merritt,
stealing the petitions was
one means his contacts used
to disrupt the petitioning
part of the protests.

There was no police re-

* port of the break-in.at the
bookstore, which features
the writings of revolution

ary theorists and practition-
ef Bur persons ‘at the shop

recall such an incident jn
late May 1971 and said no
one attached any signifi-
cance to it at the time.

Before and after the big
May Day 1971 antiwar pro-
test, Merritt said, he visited
the offices used by groups
largely responsible for the
protest: the People’s Coali-
tion on Peace and Justice,
Vietnam Veterans Against
the War, and the Lanier
Place residence used by
some demonstration plan-
ners.

AT POLICE request,
Merritt said, he supplied
telephone numbers and
floor plans for these offices.
“I thought at the time it was
a check on whether I was
going to the places they
asked me to,” he said. Mer-
ritt did not know how police
may. have.used this infor

mation, fe said “+

LNW 68262, Docld:32989698 Page §2—— re 7

During ‘tHe demonstra-
tigr-htertit* contimaed, he
telephoned reports to police
up to 16 times a day and
joined with some law en-
forcement offices in at-
tempts to disrupt activities.
These included spreading
false information about
meeting times and places’
and sabotaging one of the
protestors’ public address
systems, he said.

"After May Day 1971, Mer-
ritt said, police asked him
to concentrate on informa-
tion gained by using an ali-
as to solicit mail from about
200 groups. He said he re-
ceived materials which de-
scribed the programs of the

groups and he turned it over *

to the police.

In October 1971, Merritt
said, he was fired by police
because “they said they did
not have enough money to
keep me on a full-time ba-
sis."" He said he had been
receiving $50 a week and
expenses. His contacts in-

| troduced him to two FBI
agents in the Washington
field office for whom he
subsequently went to work,
he said.

BY MERRITT’S account,
| his FBI assignments be-
tween October 1971 and
May 1972 centered on the
Institute for Policy Studies.
The FBI wanted him to get
a job there and supply them
with the names and license
tag numbers of persons at
institute meetings, he said.
_ Merritt said one of the
lists he supplied was from a
meeting on prison abolition
at which a civil rights law-
yer, Philip J. Hirschkop,
spoke. He said he followed
1 Hirschkop after one of the
meetings at FBI request
and reported the lawyer's
movements and contacts. *
} Merritt said he worked
{I for the FBI until May 1972,
a month after his mother
died. He said the death
“really put me down” and,-
together with a belief that
the persons he was told to
watch did not seem as dan-
gerous as they had been

portrayed by his contacts,
he decided to quit

| «-He-said his FBI contacts
reacted by “telling me they
had too much time and
money invested . .. that I
had become familiar a
the political community an

Laustrained the way they

yanted.,One of them told
me to use the work as a way

to get my mind off my moth- +
er’s death.

1 | | IN MAY, however, he de-

liberately filed a false re-
. port as the last step in a
pattern that had begun four
months earlier of giving as
little information to his con-
tacts as he could, Merritt
said, It worked, he said, and
the FBI agents let him go
with verbal threats against
revealing his role.

Merritt said one of the
agents warned him against
speaking out by saying,
“We'd sure hate to have
someone find you in the
Potomac wearing cement
galoshas.” He was also told
he had been doing ‘“‘national
security-type work,” the
disclosure of which would
be improper, he said.

Merritt said that when the
agents stopped coming
around, his former police
contacts reappeared. He

Merritt said a second
threat cathe from one of his
police contacts when the
contact learned Merritt was
considering public disclo-
sure as a means of keeping
police away from him. He
said the officer told him, “If
you try to badmouth us or
any other agencies, you'll
really meet your maker.””

ACCORDING to the rec-
ords Merritt kept and di
played of his associations
and assignments, the last
threat came in July 1973. He
did not know how his former
contact had learned of his
plan and has had no direct
contact with police since, he

MERRITT SAID his con-

said she was the police
source closest to Rennie
Davis, one of those acquitted

also denied Merritt was
asked by police to do any-
thing illegal.

Miss Kolego was not

THE TRANSFER of in-
formation from D.C-inform-
ants to the White House was
unknown to Merritt or any
of the other informants with

‘whom the Star-News
« talked. But in the Water-

gate committee testimony
of John W. Dean III, Dean
recalled receiving intelli-
gence reports from District
police. Merritt said he had
collaborated with an agent
from the Alexandria office
of the Alcohol, Tax and
Firearms Division of the
‘Treasury who, like Merritt,
was gathering intelligence
on May Day 1971 activities.

According to Merritt, the
-agent told him his unusual
assignment to intelligence
duties stemmed from a Jus-
tice Department order for
all federal agencies and
some local police to provide
reports on protests or plans.
‘The unit usually deals with
{violations of alcohol, tax
| and firearms law.

' Department officials
, close to the intelligence
units of May Day 1971 de-
clined comment, However,
one source said estimates of
the numbers and plans of
protesters had been passed
regularly from Justice to
the White House and Dean.
The source said he did not
know where the information

been furnished to the Civil Rights Division of the Depar rtment. Agents who
handled Merritt deny any improper conduct or any improper instructions to
him. :

Herington called back today and told him that as a matter of
policy we simply could not identify individuals who had furnished confidential
information to the FBI in the past and, accordingly, there was nothing at this
time that we could say about Merritt's allegations. said that he under-
stood and that actually his story was mainly about allegations made by Merritt
claiming MPD misconduct and that very little of the story would pertain to
the FBI. He said that he knew that the Intelligence Division of the MPD was not
terribly sophisticated in its kendlirg of informants, He said also that he knew
that: Merritt was a homosexual and that he did not consider him really reliable.
Some of his allegations have not checked out at " in further inquiry by
Herington also pointed out to that neither/the allegations alleging threats
against Merritt could be interpreted as threats.even if the statements had been
made, He was told that we always caution our informants against disclosing
themselves because we are aware that some people might want to exact retribu-
tion against them for having helped the FBI. The statement that we would nate.
to have Merritt found in the Potomac with cement galoshes is the type of thing
that would be an admonishment against his self-disclosure becauseSome of
his friends might seek revenge. Herington told that it was ridiculous
to believe that any FBI Agent would threaten to kill a former informant. It was
also noted that with regard to the second allegation about the prosecution on
checks, t this does not necessarily have to be interpreted as a threat either since

_it was Obvious that Merritt's surfacing himself with a lot of publicity might
- eause the victims of those checks to urge a current prosecution.

_ of course, was formerly with the Police Foundation and says
- he knows Mr. Kelley personally. He has generally been pro law enforcement in
our limited dealings with him During this conversation he said that he
sympathized with the law enforcement's position in dealing with informants
~ but that he had been assigned to write a story, which he would have to do. He
said he didn't really think that what he wrote would hurt the FBI and indicated
that the story should be forthcoming within the next several days.

Tell of Sneceaven, Failures as Infiltrators of Antiwar Groups au

of
By Paul W. Valentine
‘Washington Post Statt Writer

Two men who infiltrated
tie antiwar movement here
ffor the FBI and D.C. police
from 1970 through 1972 have
described their operations,
parting the curtain momen-

~ tarily on the tangled world
of the political undercover
«informant.

In interviews with The
Washington Post, they de-
tailed their successes, fail-

; ures, a few absurdities, but
most of all the personal con-
fusion, ambivalence and ag-
ony they said they endured
in doing such work for the,
country.

Much of their‘ work, they
said, was superficial and pe-
ripheral, and in the long run
they provided little they
could judge as being of real
consequence.

The FBI, in keeping: with
| time ‘honored tradition, does,

not at officially acknowledge
that either man worked for
the agency. But it has been
independently determined
that both were utilized as
; pstreet-level FBI informants
'—one on a $50-L0-S75-a-week
salaried basis, the other pri-
marily as a volunteer on an
expenses-only basis. One’
man also worked for me Gye
D.C, police department.
Many of their alleged acts
‘of surveillance could not be
corroborated, but sources
[within the FBI confirmed
that details of pay arrange-
ments and other transac-

COE RIT eee Ne

‘Their disclosures also_pro-

videsome glimpse of the
contrasting kinds of people
the FBI uses for informants.
The two men are:

* Earl Robert Merritt, tim.
id, 29-year-old, small-town

says he “didn’t even know

gressive, 36-year old urban

one-time penchant for vio-
Jence who saw the police-
radical street clashes of the
antiwar movement as a
“cultural war between work-
ing class grunts.... and
spoiled upper class WASP
and Jewish kids.”
. Each informant said he
was caught in a web of fi-
nancial or political cireum-
stance compelling him to
continue covert surveil-
lance of people and institu
tions long after his original
zeal to do so had ceased.
Each says he did not know

though they both conducted

and then almost simultane-
ously penetrated the Insti-
tute for Policy Studies
(IPS), a governmental policy °
research organization here.
» Merritt worked first for
the police department and
Athen the FBI, each time on
a salaried basis, he says.
Barrett, “working more as
a volunteer than anything:
else,” he says, was utilized
poy the FBI oily and was
paid expenses but no salary.
Merritt's identity was first
divulged by the Daily Rag, a
small activist community
newspaper here that pul
lished a carefully worded i
terview with Merritt in its
Oct. 5-12 issue. The text had
first been cleared and ap-

Merritt agreed to a subse-
quent interview by The Post
“but only in the presence of
his attorney.

In contrast, Barrett spoke
freely with this reporter int
both formal and informal
conversations during the
last several months. His
‘identity has not been previ-

antiwar demonstrations here’

in the late 1960s as a free-
lance observer and _occa-
sional street fighter’ who
would trip, punch and jab
demonstrators during me-
Jees with the police. It was a
habit he took with him
when he joined the’ FBI in-

formant ranks in 1970, but
he says he has since repdi-
ated it.

2 “At first, I-thought my an-
tagonism toward the left
was an ideological one,”
* Barrett said, “but now I know
it was cultural,

: “Ym working-class Trist
“Catholic ... These upper
class WASP and Jewish kids
of the new left were the
sons and daughters of the
people charging me 36 per

tenements, They paid only

: “Those kids really held us

Who fight the wars and po-
lice the streets of this coun-
try, who keep, the nation
moving while they piddle
around with their intellectu-
alism.”

: Thus, said Barrett, when
he became an informant, “I
had joined the army of the
Lord.”

*, Three years later, Barrett,
the: onetime GOP ward-
sheéler in Maryland and
hard-nosed Young Ameri-
cans for Freedom (YAF) ac-
sAfvist, is not so sure. Three
yenrs in the trenches with
the new left had taken a cer-
tajn toll.

:*I had a hell of a time
kyjowing where J began and
Where my role ended,” he
said. “I was very confused.

“I knew I was no longer a

YaFer, but I didn’t want to

get into the left culture. gi-
thes"

igi felt I was lying on a
jungleisland surrounded by
fever swamps recovering
from the withdrawal symp-
toms of a true believer.”

+ He said, “When I started,
T could give you an operat-
ing definition of ‘right’ and
‘left,’ but there’s no way in
God's world I could do. it
now.”

* Barrett still has not re-
solved questions _ about

whether current FBI. sur-
veillance practices are mor-
ally correct.

“If the government hears
that a group is trying to
blow up the Capitol or kill
the President,” he said, “it
“has a right to find out if it
is true and stop it through
surveillance ... But, if they
find out it is not true, how
do you pull ’em back? How
do you keep surveillance
within limits? That’s the
*problem, as I see it. Once
the surveillance ball starts
rolling, it’s hard to stop it.”

Because so many police-
men and other law enforce.
ment officers are “working
class ethnics” with a heavy
infusion of Catholic conserv-
atisin, they are naturally an-
tagonistic toward the “smart
middle-class airs” of the
new left, Barrett said.

He described the FBI asa
“bunch of Fordham boys
watching Harvard boys.”

While Barrett perceives
himself as a person strug-
gling to comprehend the cul-
“tural gap between the right

and the left, Merritt said his -

fundamental lack of educa-
tion in the realm of politics
of either the left or the
right made it difficult for
him to penetrate the anti-
war movement with any real
activist credibility,
Uninitiated in radical left
literature or rhetoric, he
‘was unable to participate in

Now his perspective was
changing, he said.

Though he wanted -to ex-

also “was the matter of

Then on July 16, 1971, he

“concentrate” on the Insti-
tute for Policy Studies at
1520 New Hampshire Ave.

“T didn’t even know what

(The IPS, a frequent tar-
get of criticism by conserva-
tive political figures, is de-
scribed by its co-directors
Marcus Raskin and Richard
J. Barnet asan independent

eation in alternative con-
cepts of public policy in
stich areas as foreign aid,

education, military budget,
and health services, The pri-
vately funded institute sup-

_ Ports 17 fulltime fellows
and a_ research staff of
about 50 persons.)

Merritt said police inter-

est in IPS was apparently
whetted by announcement
that a series of weekly
Marxism-anarchism __semi-
nars were to be held there,
led by Marxist scholar
Alfred Henley -and Karl
Hess, one-time Goldwater
speech writer turned an-
arehist theoretician and ex-
aminer of alternative life
styles. :

“My job was to go to the
classes and count how many
people were there,” Merritt
said. 2

In addition to any names
he could obtain, he said, po-
lice asked him for an attend-
ance breakdown as to males
and females, blacks and
whites, “Jews, Germans and
people of eastern Kuropean
extraction.”

He said, “I was told to
look for Europeans in look
and dress . .. They told me
to look for certain clothing
styles (and) physical appear-
ances, like high cheek
bones. High cheek bones
were supposed to be Ger-
man or Russian or some-
thing... Yes, accents, too. I
was supposed to report for-

eign accents.”

He said he told police that
“most people at IPS were
Jewish.” Asked how he dis-

stinguished Jews from non-

Jews, L.Said ke could do it

*vaguely"then added that
: wie poles” mentors;“in" a

rather facetious manner,
used Arthur Waskow as a
comparison model.”

Waskow, a hefty bearded
man, is an IPS fellow and
veteran activist in antiwar
and Jewish affairs here.

In addition to monitoring
the Marxism-anarchism sem-
imars, Merritt said, police
asked him to seeka job as a
research assistant to one of
the IPS fellows.

Merritt voiced concern
that he was not education-
ally equipped for such a
role,

“I questioned my ability
tq do it,” he said, “but the
police seemed to think it
_ Would be (the job of) a glori-
fied errand boy.”

Half heartedly, he said, he
‘applied’ for the job but
never got it.

In the meantime, Merritt
was “terminated” by the po-
lice department (the wave
of dramatic antiwar street
demonstrations had subsided
by mid-1971, he said, and
the intelligence division was
running out of money to
pay informants).

With the recommendation
of his police superiors, he
was hired by the Washing-
ton field office of the FBI at
$50 to $75 a week and _con-
tinued his work at the IPS.

He was by this time so
disillusioned with the law
enforcement establishment,
he said, that he was deliber-
ately cutting down on the
amount of information he
reported. He said he main-
tained the guise of the in-
former, however, because “I
needed the money” and be-
cause of the continuing pos-
sible threat of arrest for the
checks in West Virginia.

bis FBI control agents ad-
ditionally instructed him, he
said, to watch for “Weather
fugitives” entering the IPS,

puted members of the vio-
lent underground Weather-

was doing.

Likewise, Barrett said the

couriers, Barrett said he
sighted one and reported his
presence immediately. He
said he does not know if the
IFBI took any action.

Merritt says he became so *

distraught with his~ IPS
work that by September,
1971, he told Robert E. Herz-
stein, an IPS board member
and attorney in the firm of
Arnold & Porter about it,
and in December, 1971,
made a similar confession to
Arthur Waskow.

Yet, for another six
months, until June, 1972, he
continued calling in low-
grade intelligence reports to

Ithe FBI field office, he said,

When he could stand it no
longer, he said, he deliber-
ately falsified a report on
Jack Davis’ whereabouts.
{FBI field agents quickly de-
‘termined through other in-
formants that the report
was incorrect, Merritt said,
and he was fired.

He has since tried to drop
out of sight, refusing to di-

| vulge his home address or
; place of employment.

Barrett says he was first
ptilized by the FBI in the
‘spring of 1970, after he and
a companion offered the
agency some film they had
taken of street demonstra-
tions in Washington.

Thereafter, he said, he
monitored demonstrations
regularly, phoning in street
actions and plans to the
field office. He also contin-
ued to shoot moving film of
demonstrators and — was
for his camera

jet

He said he was also asked
to “checkout” Kari” Hess,
who by 1970 had tirned
away from Goldwater con:
servatism and became active
in the antiwar movement,
living in a houseboat: colony
off Buzzard Point in South-
west Washington,

“They wanted to know
what he was doing,” Barrett
said. “There were rumors he
was messing with some
pretty heavy people.”

Barrett pursued Hess spo-
radically at first and did not
begin to “zero in” on him
until the summer of 1971, he
said, when Hess and Henley
began their Marxism-anar-
chism seminar at IPS.

Though’ he devoted most.
of his time to Hess, Barrett
says he circulated generally
through IPS, coming‘ to
know many of its research
fellows, exchanging political
views. with them — and
“playing the role of resident
redneck.”

“I even joked about the
fact that I was an infor-
mant,” he said. “I refused to
play the game of being sym-
pathetic to the new left. T
spoke and acted exactly the
way Ifelt... The only thing
wag they djdn’ really, know



that Lwas,in fact an infor-
mant’ —

Hess recalls Barrett as a
“very. thoughtful, smart
guy” who liked to write and
who “made some really inci-
sive criticisms of the new
left’s misunderstanding of
the right in America.”

Barrett for his part said
he never observed Hess do-
ing anything worth report-
ing to the FBI. ~

In fact, he said,
“everything I saw at IPS
was completely legitimate.
They (IPS research fellows)
probably won’t like it, but
their operation there, with
its emphasis on individual
decisions and decentraliza-
tion of power, reminds me
of a sort of 1948 Robert Taft
workshop.”

In addition to monitoring
Hess and the presence of
Weather “couriers at IPS,
Barrett says he attempted to
determine if any of the se-
eret Pentogon papers di-
vulged by antiwar activist
Daniel’ Ellsberg had been
copied at IPS. He said he
was also asked to find out
details about a “delegation”
of IPS ‘members going to
“Paris in 1972 to meet with
the Hanoi ‘entourage at the
Vietnam peace talks.

He said he found no evi-
dence that the Pentagon. pa-
pers were copied at IPS and

determined only the -

“approximate departure
times” of two IPS flights to
Paris. 5 7
(PS co-director Raskin
says only he and fellow co-
director Barnet went to
Paris, each on separate
“flights and each “primarily
on a journalistic assign-
ment” for major U.S. news-
papers. He said they met
and talked with both the Ha-
noi and National Liberation
Front (NLF) delegations in
thatconseetion.) .. on

NW 68262 Docld:32989698 Page 64.

Barrett says his derision
to quit mformant “work oc-
curred at the 1972 Republi-
can National Convention in
Miami Beach where he had
volunteered to film demon-
strations and monitor street
actions for the FBI.

During the last night of
the convention when police
and demgnstrators clashed
violently and tear gas was
sprayed into the crowds, “I
saw this VVAW (Vietnam
Veterans Against the War)
guy on crutches who had
stumbled down and couldn’t
get out of the gas... 1
‘picked him up and carried
him as far as I could. I’ve

of those VVAW people.

this treatment just for_pxo-
testing ihe government,
when it’s the spoiled kids
from Yale and Harvard that
set off the police? It wasn’t
the vets. ‘They’re a very dis-
ciplined group.”

Barrett stressed that he
always maintained his inde-
pendence from the FBI be-
cause “I was never salaried
like some of these other
guys. I wanted it that way.”

In interviews, Barrett re-
fused to specify his control
agents, his code name or de-
tails of his financial ar-
rangements.

Unlike Merritt, Barrett
fsays his FBI superiors ex-
plicitly instructed him not
to violate any laws or insti-
gate sabotage or violence.
«Though he acknowledges
ripping down Vietcong flags
and “punching out a few
people” during street dem-
onstrations, the actions were
not requested or sanctioned
by his bosses. he said. ;

On the other hand, Mer-
jritt. said his FBI control
agents encouraged him “to
take anything” from the
IPS, “but they would never
say exactly what or how.

“Memorandum to Mr, W. R. Wannall
Re: Unknown Subjects; Marcus Raskin and
the Institute for Policy Studies-Victims

provided directly to the WSPF by Merritt who he said was
publicly identified as a former informant for the FBI,
Martin said he was aware of the, FD-302's prepared by SAs
Tucker and O'Connor relative to their knowledge of Merritt's

areal activities as an informant and that he did not feel these
FD-302's covered the current allegations,

At this point, Martin was asked point blank what
these "new allegations" consisted of, and whether the CRD,
which has been handling this case, was aware of them. Martin
replied that the use of the word "allegation" in the WSPF
letter had perhaps been a mistake as it was quite strong” but
that the new information centered around a claim made by Merritt
that the FBI had received stolen mail from Merritt knowing
it to be:.stolen. In this regard, Merritt claims that he ‘took
mail from the Institute for Policy Studies (IPS), Washington,
D. C., turned it over to one of the two WFO Agents, who later
veturned it to Merritt with instructions to return it to the
IPS office. Martin stated Merritt had furnished WSPF with
additional information and allegations concerning the FBI but
that after looking into Merritt's background and considering
the information, that he, Martin, did not feel that this
additional information had any merit whatsoever. He said he
could not, however, permit the charge of receiving stolen mail

. to'"lay in his files," and that it was for this reason he
desired to interview SAs O'Connor and Tucker.

It was then pointed out to Martin that FD-302 dated

6/28/73, prepared by SAs Tucker and O'Connor noted receipt
from Merritt on one occasion of an envelope containing some
material which Merritt explained had come from the trash at

a IPS. Although the Agents did not closely examine all of the
material, it did appear to be trash. No inventory was made of
all the items and the material was returned to Merritt as soon
as he could again be contacted at which time he was told that
if the material belonged in the trash «t IPS, that is where it
should be placed. Merritt was also told again as he had before
that the FBI never wanted him to obtain such materials from the
IPS and that the only other materials provided by Merritt from
IPS were leaflets intended for the public.

Martin said he was aware of this FD-302 and its
contents but that he continued to feel the necessity of
interviewing SAs Tucker and O'Connor relative to Merritt's
claim. He stated, however, that he was not in any rush to
interview the Agents, since he desired to review the CRD
file in this matter prior to such interview.. At this point
the conversation was terminated.

It should be noted that at one ‘point during the
conversation, Martin commented that, "It!s not a place where
our jurisdiction is very strong," (apparently referring to
WSPF investigation of Merritt's latest allegations) but that
the WSPF did have some standing in the matter since the
incident "could" have arisen from pressure exerted by The

Mr, Orr Kelly, a reporter for "The Washington Evening Star News"

According to Kelly, Merritt identified himself as a former
FBI informant and said he carried out tactics like those
-described in the Cointelpro report in January, February, :
and March of 1972; that he worked under the direction of :
Special Agents Terry O'Conner and William Tucker of WFO; and }
that his target was Jack Davis, an organizer of the May Day ~~
demonstrations in 1971, who at that time was a desk man at

@ sauna bath in Washington, D, C. Merritt claimed he was
instructed to become intimate with Davis (he said both were
homosexuals) and that he was instructed to make phone calls

to Davis' friends and employees accusing him of cooperating
with or working. for the FBI and of being dishonest in handling
of money. He claimed he did not know why but Davis lost his

Memorandum to Mr. W. R, Wannall
Re: Earl Robert Merritt

it is noted that Merritt was told that the FBI was interested q

in information concerning John Rankin Davis, who was then a
suspect in the 3/1/71 bombing of the U.S. Capitol Building

and was also believed by WFO to possibly be in contact with

some of the Weatherman fugitives. Merritt advised the Agents

that he had first met Davis, whom he knew as Jack Davis, in

May of 1971. From January, 1972, to May, 1972, Merritt reported
conversations he said he had with Davis concerning his Weatherman
associates, reported information he believed linked Davis with
the Capitol Building bombing, reported that he had seen Davis with
an individual Davis said was Weatherman fugitive William Ayers

and reported on several occasions that Davis had wanted him to
accompany Davis to New York and wanted him to rent an apartment

as a safehouse for fugitives. On 5/30/72 when Merritt claimed

he had talked with Davis in Washington, D. C., Davis was being
interviewed by Bureau Agents at Lake Ariel, Pennsylvania. ‘During
the interview, Davis related having met an individual in
Washington, D. C., Imown to him as "Butch" whom he suspected was
an informant. He related "Butch" on one or two occasions attempted
to persuade him to travel to New York and once talked about
renting an apartment as a safehouse for fugitives. After reviewing
the above, WFO felt "Butch" was identical with Merritt, that

doubt had been cast on his credibility,and therefore, he was
discontinued as an informant.

By teletype 11/20/74, which is attached, Special

Agents O'Conner and Tucker categorically denied Merritt's allegations.

OBSERVATIONS : ;

Davis was never a target of any Cointelpro, which
program was discontinued 4/28/71, nor was het targeted against
Davis in any way which can be interpreted as counterintelligence,.
On the contrary, it appears Merritt, in reporting on Davis, lied
to WFO Agents regarding Davis in order to obtain money. Ina

‘Washington Post" article, 11/26/73, Merritt exposed his role as

an FBI informant, outlined his activities as an informant,
including targets assigned to him, methods of payment and reasons
why he ceased his informant activities, In the article, Merritt
lied about performing illegai acts for the FBI and lied about his
payments. Merritt's present allegations to Orr Kelly that he
carried out tactics like those described in Cointelpro are false,
and this appears to be another attempt by him to obtain notoriety.

RECOMMENDA TION:
That the allegations by Merritt to Orr Kelly be

categorically denied.

’ Beginning with the conversation on October 1, 1971,
Merritt stated thac he spent a great deal of time at the .
Institute for #olicy Studies (Ivs), Washington, D, C. (iO).
He purported to have free and rightful access to the prenises
of IPS at which he performed odd jobs and basen neetings.

The association eaong these persons had existed befor
Weatherman members, particularly HWichael Spiegel, Cathlya
Platt Likeeson and William Ayers, becsme fugitives, it was
believed that having someone like Herritt with Vaskow and
Raskin on a legitimate and somewhat reguler basis might result
in the developrent of information which would lead to the
apprehension of s of these fugitives, lt might also result
in the develepnent of inforration concerning civil disruptions
and other illegal activities. :

Sometine around December 3, 1971], Nerritt began to report
that Marcus Raskin had promised him a job as an assistant to
féxthur Weskow. Waskow had initially been unhappy that these
arrangezents were made without his knowledge but that the job
would bogin after January 1, 1972, Prior to that date, Weskow
was to spend sone time in orientation sessions with Merritt.
Herritt theraafter reperted that he had difficulty in setting in-
touch with Naskow regarding these sessions. le furnished a
etter from IPS dated Decenber 18, 1971, stating that no new
personnel would be hired at 175, He talked with Kaskow on
‘December 27,1971, and on this occasion Yaskow told him that he
should not worry about this letter and was still being considered
for a job, ¥askow added that his. sowrees had indicated that

By form letter dated March 4, 1975, the Office
of the Deputy Attorney General enclosed a letter which had
been received from Rarl Robert Merritt, Jv., in which
Merritt has requested that any "investigatory files"
maintained by the Bureau relating to him be made available
for his inspection and copying under the Freedom of Infor-
mation Act. A copy of Merritt's letter is attached. |

The Bureau was directed by the Deputy Attorney
General to comply with the request or deny it, based upon
the law and existing regulations.

It is noted that in 1970 and 1971, Merritt was the
subject of an interstate transportation of stolen abated

E, L. Recer to Mr. Cleveland siete
Re: Earl Robert Merritt, Jr. 7

After being closed, Merritt disclosed his former
relationship. with the Bureau to representatives of the media.
He made some untrue statements, including the allegation that
WFO Agents had threatened his life in an attempt to insure
that he never reveal his role as an informant.

The proper response to Merritt's request is, of
course, a matter to be determined by the Office of Legal
Counsel, It would appear, however, that the material in
the informant file is not “investigatory” in‘nature, and
the operation of an informant is not,.in and of itself, an
investigation. Other than the aforementioned ITSP case, the
only investigation of Merritt which is reflected in the
informant file is a check of appropriate local criminal
Aer when he was opened as a Pcl.

Merritt provided information in natters within
our jurisdiction, but these of course do not relate to him
as a subject or suspect, and would notappear to fall within
the scope of his request, :

It is further noted that in regard to those
investigations in which he provided information, his
assistance was in the form of an investigative technique,
which we are not required to disclose under Section b(7)
of the Act,

RECOMMENDATION:

pounds of material compiled by Earl Robert Kerri for the
combined time he served as an informant for both the .~
Washington NPD and the FBI. The article contains no
allegations against the FBI, but highlights the super-
ficiality of information accumulated by Herritt during the
late 1960s and early 1970s. Merritt claims he was paid
approximately $1,500 by the MPD covering the period April

Memorandum to Mr. W. 2. Wannall
Re: Earl Robert Merritt
1387-28143

he was in contact with Weatherman fugitives, From January,
1972, to May, 1972, he reported on conversations he reportedly
had with Weatherman associates. On 5/30/72, however, he
reported=on a-conversation he was supposes to have had with
Davis in Washington, D. C., on the same date that Davis was
being interviewed by Bureau Agents in another part of the
country. Further, during the latter interview, Davis
described Merritt to Bureau Agents as an individual he
believed to be an informant. Services of Merritt were then
discontinued. i

In 9/74, Nerritt related to a news revorter that
he had carried out, for the Bureau, tactics described in
the then recently released COINTELPRO report, nearly a
year and a half after the program was ordered halted, and he
made several allegations of improper conduct on the part of
handling Agents. All of the allegations were vehemently
refuted by involved personnel,and the news reporter was
furnished full facts concerning the matter. Details con-
cerning this incident were set forth in my memorandum -to
you dated 11/21/74, captioned above.

OBSERVATIONS:

The above article appears to be prefaced upon
another attempt by Merritt to obtain notoriety. As the
article contains no allegations against either the Bureau
or its personnel, no additional action is deemed nec-
essary by this Bureau.

RECOMMENDATION:

None. Above submitted for information.

Tnformant’s

ceding hair line—long dark brown hair,
long shaggy beard with some gray—
black rim.glosses, gold wedding band on
left hand —H: 5-11—W: 175."

‘I This description of author and com-
munity activist Arthur I, Waskow, com-

- plete with the misspelling of his last

name, is part of almost 50 pounds of

‘assorted documents and files main.

tained by former FBI and D.C. police
Anformant Earl Robert Merritt during

* ‘the antiwar days of the late 1960s and

. > early 1970s.

The files, consisting primarily of an-
tiwar tracts, leaflets, flyers, mailouts,
news clippings and other publicly avail-
able documents, have been described
by both Metritt and his superiors in

” the intelligence division of the D.C. po-
_ lice department as “mostiy junk.”

‘Merritt estimates the FBI and D.C.
police paid him a total of $4,500 in sal-
aries and expenses for his efforts for a
14-month period between April, 1971,
and June, 1972. Both police and FBI

have verified that he worked for them"

“ “Merritt” made copies of his dies 4

available to The Washington Post after

D.C. Police Chief Maurice J. Culli- |
nane issued a report earlier this

month acknowledging that the intelli- #

gence division collected thousands of
tnevaluated and irrelevant files on
local political figures and organiza-
tions.

The detailed physical description of
Waskow is one of the few independen-
tly developed reports made by Mer-
ritt—written in September, 1971, after

* Merritt attended a prison reform meet-

ing chaired by Waskow.

Yet; police acknowledge its value is
virtually nil: it describes a man who
already was well known to the police
and who was a familiar public figure

-in the antiwar and civil rights move-

ment of that time, 7

Merritt says his control officers in
the intelligence division specifically in-
structed him to include detailed physi-
cal descriptions, including the racial
and ethnic appearance of individuals
he monitored.

The control officers, Christopher
Scrapper, now a sergeant in the first
police district, and Charles Robinson,
now an investigator for the General
Services Administration, deny they
gave such instructions.

tute for Policy Studies, then at 1520

By Paul W. Valentine
Washineton Post Staff Writer

Two men who infiltrated
the antiwar movement here
for the FBI and D.C. potice
from 1970 through 1972 have
described their operations,
parting the curtain momen-
tarily on the tangled world
of the political undercover
informant.

In interviews with The
Washington Post, they de-
tailed their successes, fail-
ures, a few absurdities, but
most of all the personal con-
fusion, ambivalence and ag-
ony they said they endured
in doing such work for the
country.

Much of their-work, they
said, was superficial and pe-
ripheral, and jn the long run
they provided little they
could judge as being of real
consequence.

{The FBI, in keeping with

time-honored tradition, does

not officially acknowledge
that either man worked for
the agency, But it has been
independently determined
that both were utilized as
street-level FBI informants
—one on a $50-to-S75-a-week
salaried basis, the other pri-
marily as a volunteer on an
expenses-only basis. One"
man also worked for the
D.C, police department.

Many of their alleged acts
“of surveillance could not be
corroborated, but sources
within the FBI confirmed
that details of pay arrange-
ments and other transac-
tions with the FBI deserihed
by the-merare authentic.

Their disclosures also_pyo-
vide some glimpse of the
contrasting kinds of people
the FBI uses for informants,
The two men are: i

© arl Robert Merritt, tim-

id, 29-year-old, small-town
West, Virginian who never

finished high school and
says he “didn’t even know
what a Weatherman was”
until FBI agents told him.
He is a self-described homo-
sexual,

© JA. Barrett, a beefy, ag-
gressive, 36-year old urban
irish Catholic ethnic with a
one-time penchant for vio-
lence who saw the police-
radical street clashes of the
antiwar movement as a
“cultural war between work-
iug class grunts ... and
spoiled upper class WASP
and Jewish kids.”

Each informant said he
was caught in a web of fi-
nancial or political circum-
stance compelling him to
continue covert surveil-
lance of people and institu.
tions long after his original
zeal to do so had ceased.

Each says he did not know
the other was ap-uadervover
operative at the time,

though they both conducted
suf Hiée of aiftiwar dem-
onstrations in 1970 and 1971
and then almost simultane.
ously penetrated the Insti-
tute for Policy Studies
(PS), a governmental policy
research organization here.
~ Merritt worked first for
the police department and
Athen the FBI, each time on
a salaried basis, he says.
Barrett, “working more as
a volunteer than anything
else,” he says, was utilized
poy the FBI only and was
paid expenses but no salary.
Merritt's identity was first
divulged by the Daily Rag, a
small activist community
newspaper here that pub-
lished a carefully worded in-
terview with Merritt in its
Oct. 5-12 issue. The text had
first been cleared and ap-
proved by Merritt's attor-
ney, David B. Isbell, of the
fA dectehlars tL ee.

ingtore-Burling. 2"

Shy, hesitant, baby-faced,
Merritt agreed to a subse-
quent interview by The Post,
but only in the presence of
his attorney.

In contrast, Barrett spoke
‘freely with this reporter int
“both formal and informal
eonversations during the’

Two Lift Curtain on Undercover Work

- Tell of Successes, Failures as Infilirators of Antiwar Groups, :



“My motto was ‘let’s rip
'g ahd do sonivanng to
*em,” says. Barrett, recall-
ing how he first entered
antiwar demonstrations here
in the late 1960s as a free.
lance observer and occa-
sional street fighter who
would trip, punch and jab
demonstrators during me-
lees with the police. It was a
habit he took with him
when he joined the FBI in-

-¥ormant ranks in 1970, but
he says he has since repdi-
ated it,

* “At first, I-thought my an-
tagonism toward the left
was an ideological one,”
* Barrett, said, “but now I know
it was cultural,

“L'm working-class Irish
Catholic These upper
class WASP and Jewish kids
of the new left were the

* sons and daughters of the
people charging me 36 per
cent on a-loan ... They
owned the slums and the
tenements. They paid only
$1.25 an hour for hard work.

' “Those kids really held us

in contempt~-us, the work-.

ing class slobs, the beer
drinkers, the hard hats, the
pigs, the grunts—the people
who fight the wars and po-
lice the streets of this coun-
try, who keep, the nation
moving while they piddle
around with their intellectu-
lism.”

* Thus, said Barrett, when
he became an informant, “I
had joined the army of the
Lord.”

* * ‘Three years later, Barrett,
the one-tine GOP ward-
checler in Maryland and
hard-nosed Young Ameri-
cans for Freedom (YAF) ac-
dtivist, is not so sure. Three
years in the trenches with
the new left had taken a cer-
tain toll.

i"T had a hell of a time
kriowing where I began and
where my role ended." he
said. “I was very confused.

;“L knew I was no longer 2.

AI felt T was lying ona

ungle island surréanded by
fever swamps recovering
from the withdrawal symp-
toms of a true believer.”

He said, “When I started,
I could give you an operat-
ing definition of ‘right’ and
‘left,’ but there’s no way in
God’s world*I could do, it
now."

Barrett still has not re-
solved questions _ about.
whether current FBI sur-
veillance practices are..mor-
ally correct. EH

“Tg the government hears
that a group is trying to
blow up the Capitol or kill
the President,” he said, “it
“has a right to find out if it
is true and stop it through
surveillance ... But, if they
find out it is not true, how
do you pull ’em back? How
do you keep surveillance
within limits? That’s the
‘problem, as I see it- Once
the surveillance bali starts
rolling, it's hard to stop it.”

Because so’ many police-
men and other law enforce-
ment officers are “working
class ethnics” with a heavy
infusion of Catholic conserv-
atism, they are naturally an-
tagonistic toward the “smart
middle-class airs” of the
new left, Barrett said.

Iie described the FBI as a
“bunch of. Fordham boys
watching Harvard boys.”

While Barrett' perceives
himself as a person strug-
gling to comprehend the cul-

‘tural gap between the right
and the left, Merritt said his
fundamental lack of educa-
tion in the realm of politics
of either the left or the
right made it difficult for
him to penetrate the anti-
war movement with any real
activist credibility,

Uninitiated in radical left
literature or rhetoric, he
was unable to participate in
political: discussions and
never tried to insinuate him-
self into the movement's ad-
ministrative hierarchy, de-
spite police requests that he

do sortresaid, "

“But. there were. other
peopte tt’, too, who were
just as naive and ignorant
as I was,” he said, “so I
didn't stick out like a sore
thumb.”

Merritt first entered the
world of undercover surveil-
Jance when he was recruited
by the Washington police
department to do criminal
narcotics work in the Du-
pont Circle area in mid-1970,

With the build-up in prep-
arations for the massive an-
tiwar Mayday protests the
following spring, however,
he was switched to the po-
lice intelligence division. He
was assigned the code name
“Butch” and control number
16, a a

‘The police department
confirmed his identity but,
like the FBI. would not dis-
euss details of his job.

Merritt said police intelli-

genee-tectuiters specifically
sought him because they
wanted a “white gay male”
to cultivate antiwar gay ac-
tivist Jack Davis who was
reputed to be organization-
ally close to Rennie Davis
(no relation), longtime war
protester and a chief archi-
tect of the planned Mayday
disruptions.

But Merritt did not get
far. “I tried to get close to
both of them,” he said, “but ,
just impossible They
were too busy moving
around,” and he relayed no
important information on ei-
ther of the Davises to police.

Soft spoken and clean sha-
ven with short red hair,
Merritt said he tried to
blend into the antiwar
crowd at organizational
meetings by playing the role
of “just angther activist.”

Paddling about from one
antiwar office to another in
downtown Washington, he
said, he did odd jobs as a
“volunteer” whilenoting aus
tomobile tag numbers and
the names and addresses of
activists and phoning them

The police “asked me to
Soi Maydayy—niarshal
training, too,” he said, “but
I couldn't get into if
was too spread out.”

As the tempo of surveil-
Jance increased in the weeks
just before Mayday, “I was
asked to call in (to
intelligence) every hour .. .
I called in up to 16 times on
Mayday itself,” giving first
hand street reports of activ-
ity.

The Mayday protest ac-
tion—which triggered the
arrest of more than 12,000
persons, along with inten-
sive barrages of police tear
gas and the brief occupation
of portions of the city by
federal troops—also brought
on what Merritt says was
his first disillusionment
with the law enforcement
establishment.

The. mass arrests and

what he described as brutal-
ity by police “disgusted me,”
Merritt said, and he began
questioning police proce.
dures, including intelligence
gathering.
. Heretofore, he~said, he
had believed police surveil-
Jancé “was the right thing to
do because I believed (the
antiwar movement) was a
communist attempt to over-
throw the government.”
Now his perspective was
changing, he said. :

Though he wanted -to ex-
tricate himself from infor-
mant work, he said, there

also “was the matter of
some (bad) checks” he had
written earlier in West Vir-
ginia and he feared the po-
lice might threaten him
With arrest for the checks if
he .stopped working for
them, 7

So he continued on the *

police payroll, he says,
drawing $50 a week salary
Plus expenses of $25 to $35 a
week, .

He went through a
“Imbo” period for the next
two months as antiwar

street_gclivjty dwindled af +

“I didn’t even know what
it was,” he said. “They told
me it was a communist
think tank.”

(The IPS, a frequent tar-
get of criticism by conserva-
tive political figures, is de-
scribed by its co-directors
Marcus Raskin and Richard
J, Barnet as an independent
center for research and edu-
cation in alternative con-
eepts of public policy in
sitch areas'as foreign aid,
education, military budget,
and health services, The pri-
yately funded institute sup-
ports 17 full-time fellows
and a_ research staff of
about 50 persons.)

Merritt said police inter-
est in IPS was apparently
whetted by announcement
that a series of weekly
Marxism-anarchism — semi-
nars were to be held there,
Jed by Marxist scholar
Alfred Henley “and Karl
Hess, one-time Goldwater
speech writer turned an-
archist theoretician and ex-
aminer of alternative life
styles.

“My job was to go to the
classes and count how many
people were there,” Merritt
said.

In addition to any names
he could obtain, he said, po-
lice asked him for an attend-
ance breakdown as to males
and females, blacks and
whites, “Jews, Germans and
people of castern European
extraction.”

He said, “I was told to
Jook for Europeans in look
and dress . .. They told me
to look for certain clothing
styles (and) physical appear-
ances, like high cheek
bones. High cheek bones
were supposed to be Ger-
man or Russian or some-
thing... Yes, accents, too. I
was supposed to report for-
tign-accents.”

He said he told potice that
‘most people at IPS were
Tewish.” Asked how he dis-
inguished Jews fram not
tews,} said he amauta 4

-“vaguely."then added that
his police’ mentors;~~in” a
rather facetious manner,
used Arthur Waskow as a
comparison model.”

Waskow, a hefty bearded
man, is an IPS fellow and
veteran activist in antiwar
and Jewish affairs here.

In addition to’ monitoring
the Marxism-anarchism sem-
inars, Merritt said, police
asked him to seeka job asa
research assistant to one of
the IPS fellows.

Merritt voiced concern
that he was not education-
ally equipped for such a
role.

“{ questioned my ability
to do, it,” he said, “but the
police seemed to think it
would be (the job of) a glori-
fied errand boy.”

Half heartedly, he said, he
‘applied for the job but
never got, it.

Im the meantime, Merritt
was “terminated” by the po-
lice department (the wave
of dramatic antiwar street
demonstrations had subsided
by mid-1971, -he said, and
the intelligence division was
running out of money to
pay informants). © 5

With the recommendation
of his police superiors, he
was hired by the Washing-
ton field office of the FBI at
'S50 to $75 a week and con-
tinued his work at the IPS.

He was by this time so
disillusioned with the law
enforcement establishment,

he said, that he was deliber- j

ately cutting down on the
amount of information he
reported. He said he main-
tained the guise of the in-
former, however, because “I
needed the money” and be-
cause of the continuing pos-
sible threat of arrest for the
cheeks in West Virginia.
{itis FBI control agents ad-
ditionally instructed him, he
said, to watch for “Weather
fugitives” entering the IPS,
areference to a dozen re-
puted members of the vio-
lent underground Weather-
man organization wanted in
connection with the bom-
bing of numerous public
duildings, Including Me i

Moxrittssaid he repocted
no Weather peoplé entering
the IPS and in fact told
Jack Davis, alleged by po-
lice to have above-ground
contact with the Weather or-
ganization, about what he
was doing.

Likewise, Barrett said the
{PBL asked him to watch for
“couriers” at IPS delivering
money to Weather fugitives.
Supplied with photographs
of six or seven suspected
couriers, Barrett said he
sighted one and reported his
presence immediately, He
said he does not know if the
[FBI took any action.

Merritt says he became so
distraught with his~ IPS
work that by September,
1971, he told Robert E. Herz-
stein, an IPS board member
and attorney in the firm of
Arnold & Porter about it,
and in December, 1971,
made a similar confession to
Arthur Waskow. 7

Yet, for another six
months, until June, 1972, he

Ee calling in low-

grade intelligence reports to
\the FBI field office, he said.
» When he could stand it no
longer, he said, he deliber-
ately falsified a report on
Jack’ Davis' whereabouts.
fF BI field agents quickly de-
termined through other in-
formants that the report
was incorrect, Merritt said,
and he was fired. ~
He has since tried to drop
out of sight, refusing to di-
vulge his home address or
place of employment.
| Barrett says he was first
tilized by the FBI in the
‘spring of 1970, after he and
a companion. offered the
agency some film they had
taken of street demonstra-
tions in Washington.
Thereafter, he said, he
monitored demonstrations
regularly, phoning in street
actions and plans to the
field office. He also contin-
ued to shoot moving film of
demonstrators and — was
reimbursed for his camera
costs; NE Said. ane"

He said he was also ask
to *clieek out" Kart toa
who by 1970 had turnet
away from Goldwater cor
servatism and became activi
in the antiwar movement
living in a houseboat colons
off Buzzard Point in South;
west Washington, {

“They wanted to know
what he was doing,” Barrett
said. “There were rumors he!
was messing with some|
pretty heavy people.” 1

Barrett pursued Hess spo-i
radically at first and did not!
begin to “zero in” on hii
until the summer of 1971, he
said, when Hess and Henley {
began their Marxism-anar- |
chism seminar at IPS,

Though he devoted most |
of his time to Hess, Barrett ©
says he circulated generally -
through IPS, coming to .
Know many of its research
fellows, exchanging political
views with them and
“playing the role of resident
redneck.”

“I everi joked about the
fact that T was an infor
mant.” he said. “I refused to
play the game of being sym-
pathetic to the new left. I
spoke and acted exactly the
way Ifelt...The only thing +
wag they djdn’ really, know A



that_L was, in fact an infor-
mant a

Hess recalls Barrett as a
“very thoughtful,“ smart
guy” who liked to write and
who “made some really inci-
sive criticisms of the new
Jeft’s misunderstanding of
the right in America.”

Barrett for his part said
he never observed Hess do-
ing anything worth report-
ing to the FBI S

In fact, he — said,
“everything I saw at IPS
was completely legitimate.
‘They (IPS research fellows)
probably won't like it, but

_ their operation the with
its emphasis on individual
decisions and decentraliza-
tion of power, reminds me
of a sort of 1948 Robert Taft
workshop.” .
“In addition to monitoring

Weather “couriers at IPS,
Barrett says he attempted to
determine.if any, of the se-
‘eret. Pentogon papers di-
yulged by antiwar activist
Daniel’ El'sberg had been
copied at IPS. He said he
was also asked to find out
details about a “delegation”
of IPS members going to
“Paris in 1972 to meet with
the Hanoi entourage at the
Vietnam peace talks.

He said he found no evi-

dence that the Pentagon pa-
-* pers were copied at IPS and
determined only the
“approximate departure
times" of two IPS flights to
Paris. :

PG co-director. Raskin
says only he and fellow co-
director Barnet went to
Paris, each on separate
flights and each “primarily
on a journalistic assign-
ment” for major U.S. news-
papers, He said they met
and talked with both the Ha-

* noi and National Liberation
Front (NLF) delegations in

Barrett_says his_derision
to“quit fiformant work oc-
curred at the 1972 Republi-
can National Convention in
Miami Beach where he had
volunteered to film demon-
strations and monitor street
actions fer the FBI.

During the last night of
the convention when police
and demonstrators clashed
violently and tear gas was
sprayed into the crowds, “I
saw this VVAW (Vietnam

‘ciplined group.”

Barrett stressed that he
always maintained his inde-
pendence from the FBI be-
cause “I was never salaried
like some of these other
guys. I wanted it that way.”

In interviews, Barrett re-
fused to specify his control
agents, his code name or de-
tails of his financial _ar-
rangements.

Unlike Merritt, Barrett
$i his FBI superiors ex-
plicitly instructed him not
to violate any laws or insti-
gate saboiage or violence.
Though he acknowledges
ripping down Vietcong flags
and “punching out a few
people” during strect dem-
onstrations, the actions were
not requested or sanctioned
by his bosses, he said. 7

On the other hand, Mer-

say exactly what or how.

He acknowledged stealing

to D.C, police. He also says
he broke into the Commu-

NV, in late May, 1971, at po-
lice suggestion and stole a
quantity of antiwar petitions
containing names and’ ad-
dresses of activists and sup-
Porters.

In ‘addition, he said he
fashioned three false identi-
fication documents using an
alias, Qne was a Social Secu-
rity. card which he said he
fashioned before becoming a
police infsrmant. The other
two were a draft card anda

Informers
For Police
Exposed :

By Paul W. Valentine
Washington Post Staff Writer -

Recent disclosures by an ac-
tivist community newspaper of
police informant activities
within Washington’s once-

- flourishing antiwar movement
have jeopardized political in-
telligence gathering opera-
tions, D.C. police officials said

| yesterday.

‘fhe disclosures, part of an
ongoing campaign by the anti-
establishment Daily Rag news-
paper, are “definitely a threat
to our operations,” acknowl-
edged Capt. George Sutter,
acting director of the police
depariment’s intelligence di-
vision.

Sutter confirmed the identi-
fication of two one-time infor-
mants named in front-page
stories in the Jast two issues
of the Daily Rag.

The first story named Ann
Kolego, 20, also known as
“Crazy Annie,” as a paid po-
Nice informant who infiltrated
the D.C, offices of the Peoples
Coalition for Peace and Jus-,
tice (PCPJ) and National
Peace —_ Action Coalition
QNPAC) from early 1971 to
June 25 of this year.

Sutter rated her as an~‘ex-|
cellent” intelligence source. *

‘The second story named Earl
Robert Merritt Jr., known to
Police as “Butch,” who worked
asa paid informant for about!
five months around the time:

tions here in the spring of

Merritt was quoted in the
Tag as saying he later-did in-

ringten would not ‘comment

firmed that Merritt performed

tional disclosures of activities
by other informants.

Merritt came directly to the
paper with his acknowiedge-
ment of spy work after being
“turned off” by the job, ac-
cording to Rag staff worker,
Chris Simpson. u

‘The disclosure of Miss Ko-
lego as an informant was
leaked to the Rag by a Wash-
ington-based organization,
called the Committee for Ac-
tion/Research on the Intelli-
gence Community (CARIC).

CARIC spokesman Winslow
Peck said his organization is
“working on a couple of other
peaple now,” and their names

should be revealed soum;—

Asked how CARICTSSbIE to
discover and. identify infor-
mants, Peck said, “We have
contacts within the metropoli-
tan police department and
other intelligence groups in
the city.”

Capt. Sutter of the police in-
felligence division said he
does not think the information
is being leaked from his own
orgenization, but is not over-
looking the possibility.

Staffers at the Daily Rag,

‘which despite its name is a

weekly paper located at 2416
18th St. NW in the Adams-
Morgan section of the city,
have questioned the legality
and authorization for some of
the informant work done by
Merritt and Miss Kolego.
They note, for example, that
Miss Kolego made frequent
out-of-town trips to assorted
antiwar conclaves and ques-

to Washington in January

petitions, pamphlets, meet-
ing notices. and other mate-
rials and give them to police
contacts who told him they
would be a source of names
of persons and groups in the
protest community, Merritt
said.

According to Merritt,
stealing the petitions was
one means his contacts used
to disrupt the petitioning
part of the protests.

There was no police re-

: port of the break-in at the

the hai of revolution
ary theorists and practition-
et's- But persons at the shop

recall such an incident_in
late May 1971 and said no
one attached any signifi-
cance to it at the time.

Before and after the big
May Day 1971 antiwar pro-
test, Merritt said, he visited
the offices used by groups
largely responsible for the
protest: the People’s Coali-
tion on Peace and Justice,
Vietnam Veterans Against
the War, and the Lanier .
Place residence used by
some demonstration plan-
ners.

AT POLICE request,
Merritt said, he supplied
telephone: numbers and
“floor plans for these offices.

a check on whether 1 was
going to the places they
asked me to,” he said. Mer-
ritt did not know how police
may have used this infor
mation, he said

NW 68262. Docld:22989698 Rage 193-~ .

During \ife demonstra-
tion Merritt conéimed, “he
telephoned reports to police
up to 16 times a day and
joined with some law en-
forcement offices in at-
tempts to disrupt activities.
These included spreading
false information .about
meeting times and places
and sabotaging one of the
protestors’ public address
systems, he said.

_After May Day 1971, Mer-
ritt said, police asked him
to concentrate on informa-
tion gained by using an ali-
as to solicit mail from about
200 groups. He said he re-
ceived materials which de-

‘scribed the programs of the ,

groups and he turned it over
to the police.

In October 1971, Merritt
said, he was fired by police
because “they said they did
not have enough money to
keep me on a full-time ba-
sis." He said he had been
receiving $50 a. week and
expenses. His contacts in-

[ troduced him to two FBI
agents in the Washington
field office for whom he
subsequently went to work,
he said.

BY MERRITT’S. account,
his FBI assignments be-
tween October 1971 and
May 1972 centered on the
Institute for Policy Studies.
The FBI wanted him to get
a job there and supply them
with the names and license
tag numbers of persons at
institute meetings, he said.

_ Merritt said one of the
lists he supplied was from a
i meeting on prison abolition
at which a civil rights law-
yer, Philip J. Hirschkop,
spoke. He said he followed
Hirschkop after one of the
.! meetings at FBI request
j and reported the lawyer's
7 movements and contacts.

Merritt said he worked
1 for the FBI until May 1972,

a month after his mother

died. He said the death

IN MAY, however, he-de-
liberately filed a false re-
port as the last step in a
pattern that had begun four
months earlier of giving as
little information to his con-
tacts as he could, Merritt
said. It worked, he said, and

[the FBI agents let him. go
with verbal threats against
reveating his role.

Merritt said one of the
agents warned him against
speaking out by saying,
“We'd sure hate to have
someone find you in the
Potomac wearing cement
galoshas.” He was also told
he had been doing “national
seourity-type work,’’ the
disclosure of which would
be improper, he said.

Merritt said that when the
agents stopped coming
around, his former police
contacts reappeared. He
decided then to get legal
help in his effort to end as-
sociation with law enforce-
ment agencies and contact-
ed Washington lawyer Da-

*, vid Isbell, he said. :

Merritt said a secon
threat carne from one of his
police contacts when the
contact learned Merritt was
considering public disclo-
sure as a means of keeping
police away from him, He
said the officer told him, “If
you try to badmouth us or
any other agencies, you'll
really meet your maker.”

ACCORDING to the rec-
ords’ Merritt kept and dis-
played of his associations
and assignments, the last
threat came in July 1973, He
did not know how his-former
contact had learned of his
plan and has had no direct
contact with police since, he
‘said.

“She had to be to stay
under cover for so long
without being burned,” one
official said.

“According to her former
roommate, Carol Cullum,
Miss Kolego was known as
“Crazy Annie’ to the activ-
ists and posed as a dropout
from George Washington
University with a huge infe-
riority complex and willing-
ness to do the menial jobs of
the protest movement—
stuffing envelopes, handing
out pamphlets and running
errands.

" MISS CULLUM said she
first remembered Miss Ko-

1971 protest. Between then
and now, she said, Miss
Kolego was a regular part
of the Washington Peace

MERRITT SAID his con-
tacts had often had high

said she was the police
source closest to Rennie

in the Chicago Seven con-

THE TRANSFER of in-
formation from D.C-1ntorm-
ants'to the White House was
unknown to Merritt or any
of the other informants with
whom the Star-News
talked. But in the Water-
gate committee testimony
of John W. Dean III, Dean
recalled receiving intelli-
gence reports from District
police. Merritt said he had
collaborated with an agent
from the Alexandria office
of the Alcohol, Tax and
Firearms Division of the
Treasury who, like Merritt,
was gathering intelligence
on May Day 1971 activities.

According to Merritt, the

-agent told him his unusual

assignment to intelligence
duties stemmed froma Jus-
tice Department order for
all federal agencies and
some local police to provide
reports on protests or plans.
The unit usually deals with
‘violations of alcohol, tax
and firearms law.

Department officials

WASHINGTON: B.C. 20535

i : FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE”
7 : eee OCTOBER 31, 1975 |

Recently a number of allegations made ‘by Earl’ Robert
Merritt, Jr., charged FBI Special Agents Terry O'Connor ana
William Tucker with certain improper and possibly illegal acts.

These charges have been publicized extensively in ‘the news.

The FBI initially felt constrained froin commenting

on these allegations because. of certain pending civil Litigation

in which Merritt is involved as-a witness. Now, however,

because of the apparent authority being gained by these. fir i

allegations through repetition in the media, and the ecause of

their effect on the two Agents involved and -their families,

the FBI feels that it should respond to these allegations. In

doing so, care is being taken to insure that this response will in

no way interfére with a fair adjudication of the civil proceedings.
Specifically, the allegations are that Merritt committed

break~ins and thefts aa behalf of the FBI; that there were

indications that Merritt was encouraged to develop an intimate

xelationship with another individual to obtain information;. that

he was asked to testify improperly concerning the 1972 ‘Pentagon

bombing; and that he:was asked to report gossip concerning

members of Congress. These allegations are fabricated and.

completely false.

1d:32989698 Page 109_



ee

«Merritt initially contac ted the FBI in October,
1971, indicating that he wished to furnish information to ‘the :
FBI and receive compensation for this information... No pressure =
was S used, to influence Merritt as ; his activities were clearly
voluntary. Merritt was never “instructed, ordered or in any-

way, encouraged to break into or otherwise illegally enter any

establishment or to commit any thefts or any other illegal ‘e : css

“acts. ° He was never requested by the FBI to be a witness in any
fashion concerning the eoaao “bombing. or to report rumors :
concerning “members of Congress. Additionaliy, at no time § was
eae Merritt encouraged ox instructed to develop -_ intimate or
; improper relationship with anyone. : i 7
As a matter of fact, Merritt was specifically advised
, = on several occasions that he was not to engage ‘in any. (iLL egal, :
activities in his efforts to obtain information and ,. further,
that he was not, to construe his. furnishing information to the

FBI as a shieid from prosecution for illegal activities. :

Merritt was’ at no time an employee of the FBI. He
= _ was not regulariy salaried but was paid on a C.0.D. basis for ;.
| information furnished. fF His relationship with the FBI was
-terminated in early June, 1972, when it was determined, thet
certain information furnished by him was unreliable. :

The FBI categorically denies that the activities of

the Agents in contact with Merritt were at any’ time improper

YEAGER advised that all of these checks were
returned by the National Savings and Trust Company of
Washington, D. C., marked "Account Closed."

YEAGER recalled that on May 4, 1970, he received
a telephone call from a woman representing herself to be
a customer of the bank named COCHRAN. She said that her
nephew was in town and wanted to cash a check. YEAGER told
her that this would be okay, however, he requested Peer she
endorse the check.

: A short time later, a white male, 5'9" - 5'10" tall,
170 pounds, age about 28, came to the bank with the first of
the above described checks. It had not been endorsed by
COCHRAN; however, the man did have a savings statement for
COCHRAN and YEAGER decided that this would be satisfactory.
COCHRAN approved the check for payment and didthe same for
‘another check on May 6, 1970. YEAGER does not know if he
would recognize this individual again or nots. After these
checks and one other were returned, YEAGER called the

phone number listed on one of the checks by MONROE 202-338-
3100. He found that this was listed to a medical credit
association for whom MONROE worked at one time. This

firm has received numerous complaints about MONROE. This
firm's employment record shows that he gave a previous
address as C. P. FRISBY, 5729 Midland Drive, Charleston,"
W. Va., phone 925-5313,

YEAGER also talked to a Mr. OSCAR L. COCHRAN,
5729} Midland Drive, who is a brother to WILLIAM JOSEPH
COCHRAN, OSCAR L. COCHRAN knew of no one by the name of
JAMES R. MONROE, but he does have a nephew of EARL ROBERT
MERRITT who has worked in Washington, D. c., and who has been
in trouble before.

YEAGER believes that WILLIAM J. COCHRAN, their
customer, is now a teacher in Mississippi. He received a

Joseph Anthony Barrett

IDENTITY OF SEPARATE DISCONTINVED INFORMANT DELETED AS
Joseph Anthony Barret®, who 1s mentioned in the

article, was a security informant of WFO from 10/70 to 6/73.

He originally contacted WFO in 5/70 and volunteered his

services, He was approved as a potential security informant

in 10/70 after woaich he reported on demonstrations by

|Vietnam Veterans Against the War (VVAW), National Peace

Action Coalition and Peoples Coalition for Peace and Justice.

He reported on the activities of IPS personnel who were

involved in Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) and he

reported on the planning for mass demonstrations in

Washington, D.C., by Rennie Davis. Barrett traveled to Miami

and reported cn the activities of dissident groups and

individuals at the Democratic and Republican National Convention

in the Summer of 1972. He subsequently provided information

abot the demonstrations at the Presidential Inauguration in

41/73. In 6/73 he was @iscontinued as an informant at his

gown xequest when he advised he was attempting to obtain a

second job and would not be able to obtain information for

the FBI and he had also devéloped great animosity for the

people such as those at IPS about whom he was reporting and,

therefore, could not provide competent coverage.

GI VMACyd Wolk

- IPS, which is mentioned in the article, was the
subject of a preliminary inquiry by the FBI in 11/68 :
after information was received indicating a possible connection
between IPS and SDS. The investigation was expanded in 1971
after it was determined that IPS vlanned to embark on a five year
plan for the radical reconstruction.of American society and
had circulated to radical groups around the country a document
ealling for brigades to descend on Washington, D.C., and close
down Government agencies, The current investigation of IPS

' As directed toward those areas in which violations of Federal
statutes may be developed in view of the activities of IPS

OBSERVATIONS : . : q

In answer to Mr, Kelley's question "any untruths
in this story?" the following should be noted:

Merritt's claim of having performed illegal ©
: acts for the FBI has been denied by the Special Agents who
\4 : directed him

Merritt's claim that -he was hired by WFO at $50
to $75 a week is inaccurate. He was paid, on a c.o.d. basis,
;in varied amounts between $20 and $30. which were paid on
“various dates two to five times per month beginning in 10/71
eyes in 5/72 for a total amount of $1,570.

Ai2&, Pinu! LAE OP nmr sc Sit Sita content bat
Barrett's claim thar ne decided boa ‘quit as an

informant while at the Republican National Convention after
seeing a VVAW member on crutches stumble and unable to get

out of the tear gas is questionable, ‘since he continued to

4 furnish information for several months thereafter for which he
was paid both services and expenses,

* Barrett's claim that he was paid only expenses but no
salary is not totally correct, While not paid a salary, Barrett
-f{was reimbursed for his expenses and in addition was paid more tha
$2,500 on a c,o.d, basis for services,

It should also be noted that WFO advised at the
time Barrett was discontinued as an informant he advised he
still had the greatest admiration for the FBI and agreed
_ }wholeheartedly that he would not reveal his work, written or
torval, with the Bureau, }

Herington and said that Merritt had furnished the paper information concerning
his prior informant status, claiming to have been a paid FBI informant from
October, 1971, until May, 1972, at which time he was discontinued because he ~
furnished us false information about Jack Davis. He cldimed his assigned task .
was to monitor the Institute for Policy Studies, 1520 New Hampshire Street, ~ |
Northwest, Washington, D. C., and to keep an eye on Jack Davis, who was
associated with the Institute. He said that he had been a police department
informant prior to working for the FBI and Stout said that this had been con-

firmed by the police. Merritt said that he had been handled by Washington ~
Field Office Agents William Tucker and Terry O'Connor, and that when he-°.
was discontinued in May, 1972, Tucker had threatened him by saying, "We
would hate to have someone find you in the Potomac with cement galoshes."'
He also alleged that Tucker threatened to have him prosecuted on three old bad
check charges in which Merritt was naashachhaies ee : ~“

nti eee 2

Herington told Stout that he would have to get back in n touch with | i
him later. Bureau files reveal that Merritt was a criminal informant
(WE_4015-C) from late 1971 until he was discontinued by Washington Field
letter dated 6/8/72. He was targeted against the Institute for Policy Studies
and Jack Davis mainly because Davis was considered a Weatherman fugitive
Support person and because we had information that some of the Weatherman

fugitives had visited the Institute. Merritt also furnished other valuable
criminal information. Merritt is a homosexual and was determined to be
unreliable, at which point he was discontinued. Although he has not been
identified by name, we believe he is responsible for allegations which resulted
in the attorney for the Institute for Policy Studies claiming the FBI and the
Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) were engaged in illegal surveillance
of ts activities and other illegal conduct. We conducted a pr eliminary civil
rights investigation on these allegations in August, 1973, and |

been furnished to the Civil Rights Division of the Department. Agents who
handled Merritt deny any improper conduct or any improper instructions to
him. : :

Herington called Stout back today and told him that as a matter of
policy we simply could not identify individuals who had furnished confidential
information to the FBI in the past and, accordingly, there was nothing at this
time that we could say about Merritt's allegations. Stout said that he under-
stood and that actually his story was mainly about allegations made by Merritt
claiming MPD misconduct and that very little of the story would pertain to
the FPI. He said that he knew that the Intelligence Division of the MPD was not
terribly sophisticated in its handling of informants. He said also that he knew
that’ Merritt was a homosexual and that he did not consider him really reliable.
Some of his allegations have not checked out at ap in further inquiry by Stout.
Herington also pointed out to Stout that neitherythe allegations alleging threats
against Merritt could be interpreted as threats-even if the statements had been
made. He was told that we always caution our informants against disclosing
themselves because we are aware that some people might want to exact retribu-
tion against them for having helped the FBI. The statement that we would hate
to have Merritt found in the Potomac with cement galoshes is the type of thing
that would be an admonishment against his self-disclosure becausesome of
his friends might seek revenge. Herington told Stout that it was ridiculous
to believe that any FBI Agent would threaten to kill a former informant. It was
also noted that with regard to the second allegation about the prosecution on
checks, this does not necessarily have to be interpreted as a threat either since
it was obvious that Merritt's surfacing himself with a lot of publicity might
cause the victims of those checks to urge a current prosecution.

Stout said that he took everything Merritt said with a grain of salt.

Stout, of course, was formerly with the Police Foundation and says
- he knows Mr. Kelley personally. He has generally been pro law enforcement in
our limited dealings with him During this conversation he said that he
sympathized with the law enforcement's position in dealing with informants
but that he had been assigned to write a story, which he would have to do. He
said he didn't really think that what he wrote would hurt the FBi and indicated
that the story should be forthcoming within the next several days.
