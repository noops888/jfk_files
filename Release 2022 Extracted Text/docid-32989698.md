F. DATE DESIGNATED AS INFORMANT

11/30/71

G. ESTIMATE OF RELIABILITY

There has been insufficient contact with the informant

to determine reliability. Nothing has been developed, however,

to indicate that the informant has furnished other than reliable

information.

H. EMPLOYMENT

The source is not employed at this time. He has talked

with persons at the Institute for Policy Studies (IPS), 1520

New Hampshire Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C., who have stated

that he is being considered for a job at IPS. These persons are

MARCUS RASKIN and ARTHUR IRWIN WASKOW. IPS, RASKIN and WASKOW

are subjects of WEO files set forth later in this communication.

The source has been employed in the past as a hospital

and medical insurance company clerical employee.

I. PAST ACTIVITIES:

The source has in the past furnished information to

the Metropolitan Police Department (Intelligence Division and

. Second District), Washington, D.C., and the Alcohol, Tobacco

and Firearms Division of the. Internal Revenue Service.

The source has been in the Washington, D.C. area,

primarily in the vicinity of Dupont Circle, for more than six

years.

During the Spring, 1971, the source became associated

with JOHN RANKIN DAVIS (WE

100-48582) and others associated with

the planning of the May, 1971, demonstrations in Washington, D.C.

Following his association with these persons, the source began

to take part in activities held at IPS and to become acquainted

with persons at IPS such as RASKIN, WASKOW and JOANN MALONE.

WFO 137-5692

The source advised that he has never been arrested

although he has been detained by law enforcement personnel on

several occasions. A search of the files of the Metropolitan

Police Department and U.S. Park Police disclosed no record

identifiable with the source under his true name of any of his

aliases. A check of NCIC reflected no warrants for the source

under his true name or aliases.

A review of WFO indices reflects that the source was

the subject of WF 87-18178. Under the name JAMES R. MONROE,

the source had, during May, 1970, cashed three checks totalling

$225.00 at Charleston, West Virginia, on a bank in Washington,

D.C. The checks were returned to the Charleston Bank. Prosecu

tion in this matter was declined on 2/23/71, by AUSA ROBERT B.

KING, Southern District of West Virginia, because the amount

of money involved and evidence available did not justify further

investigative efforts to locate and interview MERRITT.

The source explained that he had at one time cashed

several checks amounting to a little over $200 while he visited

Charleston, West Virginia, during the Spring, 1970. He stated

that he has made efforts to negotiate payment of these checks

and that he has at no other time and will never again engage

in this practice.

J.. IDENTIFICATION RECORD

A request for an Identification Record was made on

11/8/71. No criminal or civil file identifiable with the source

under his true name or aliases was located.

K. CRIMINAL ASSOCIATES

The source is in regular contact with a number of

persons engaged in criminal activity. He is an admitted homo-

sexual and this has brought him into contact with other homo-

sexuals who engage in various types of criminal activities. The

source has in the past furnished information concerning persons

involved in a homicide, narcotics, armed robberies, burglaries

and other crimes to the

Metropolitan Police Department.

Georgetown, downtown Washington, 14th and U Streets, N.W.,

14th Street and Columbia Road, N.W., and several other sections

of Washington, D.C.

L. INFORMATION FURNISHED IN THE PAST

The source has furnished information regarding the

captioned cases set forth below:

Institute for Policy Studies (IPS)

IS-NEW LEFT

(00:WFO)

(Bufile 100-447935)

(WrOfile 100-46784)

IPS is located at 1520 New Hampshire Avenue, N.W.,

Washington, D.C.

The source has furnished information concerning IPS

on a continuing basis. On 10/5/71, the source advised that he

had attended a meeting regarding prisons held at IPS on 9/21/71.

This meeting was dominated by ARTHUR. IRWIN WASKOW and JOANN

MALONE. These two persons are the subjects of Wo file

105-50397 (Bufile 105-114241), captioned "ARTHUR IRWIN WASKOW,

SM-NEW LEFT"' and WFO file 100-49419 (Bufile 454221), captioned

"JOANN MALONE, SM-NEW LEFT." The source also furnished infor-

mation on 10/6/71 concerning another meeting involving the

prison issue held at IPS on 10/5/71. This meeting, too, was

dominated by WASKOW and MaLonE.

On 10/13/71, the source advised that sometime during

September, 1971, MALONE had discussed the subject of FBI

surveillance of

IPS with him. She told the source that she

and others at IPS believed the FBI was watching them from a

building across the street, from a room in the Dupont Plaza

Hotel (to the right of the IPS building) and possibly from the

building on the other side of the IPS building. It was further

believed that the IPS building was "bugged" and that the FBI

was using sophisticated electronic equipment to pick up con-

versations in and around IPS. Because of these suspicions,

persons associated with IPS discuss important matters outside

the building.

The source provided a description on 10/13/71 of that

part of the IPS building with which he is familiar.

On 10/20/71, the source advised that WASKOW had talked

with him about the possibility of working for IPS or persons

associated with IPS. WASKOW was not specific about the job

and during subsequent contacts the source advised that he was

having difficulty locating WASKOW at IPS and that when he did

talk with him WASKOW was still noncommittal concerning the job.

On 11/16/71, the source advised that he had spoken

with MARCUS RASKIN at IPS. RASKIN is the subject of WE 100-45298

(Bufile 100-454040) captioned "MARCUS GOODMAN RASKIN, SM-NEW

LEFT." RASKIN told the source on 11/15/71 that the

source was

being considered for a job which would involve assisting

• WASKON

and others at IPS. RASKIN said that further thought was being

given this possibility and that the source should return to see

him at 1:00 p.m., 11/23/71.

On 11/9/71, the source advised that MALONE had commented

upon the apathy toward the prison issue and the fact that a

meeting would be held on the evening of 11/11/71 to renew

interest in the issue. On 11/10/71, the source stated that

MALONE had again expressed her concern concerning lack of interest

in the prison issue and had set forth her ideas as to what

course of action should be undertaken to better publicize and

renew interest in the issue. MALONE said that she was disappointed

in the response of the black community to the prison issue.

•Information has been received from a reliable source

WFO 137-5692

Although the source has not observed nor heard anything of

SPIEGEL, it is believed that the fact that the source is

occasionally in the IPS building will enable him to be in an

advantageous position to observe SPIEGEL or any other of the

New Left fugitives should they make contact with persons at

IPS.

Based on the following information WFO instituted

investigation in this matter.

On 11/3/71, the source advised that JERRY DUNLAP had

napping of the woman who was to be appointed to a high position

in the U.S. Treasury. The name of this woman was not mentioned.

This kidnapping was to be carried out at the Columbia Plaza

On 10/27/71, the source advised that he had met an

individual named MICHAEL HALL, a homosexual, who claimed to

have lived with "RANDY" COLEMAN (EDWARD SCOTT COLEMAN),

reportedly a homosexual, when COLEMAN was arrested by the MPD

in connection with fire bombing of financial institutions in the

northwest area of Washington, D.C. The two were supposed to have

lived together at 2120 0 Street, N.W., Washington, D.C.

This information was furnished to the Alcohol, Tax

and Firearms Division (ATFD), which is investigating the fire

bombings. It is also noted COLEMAN has been indicted on

UF AC-DISPENSING NARCOTICS

(00: KC)

(WF

88-7798)

On 11/19/71, the source advised that he had seen a

The information furnished by the source regarding

IPS and persons associated with IPS has been of value as intelligence

data. The source is one of only a few sources in a position to

furnish information concerning IPS which is described as the

"think tank" of the New Left.

Information regarding Dr. WILLIAM PIERCE and HAMILTON

MICHAEL BARRETT is of value from an intelligence standpoint

and has substantially aided the ATFD in its investigation of

possible firearms and explosives violations on the part of these

persons.

The source spends much time in many areas of Washington,

D.C., particularly Dupont Circle, and this enables him to be

observant concerning fugitives and for the matters of interest

to the Bureau. The fact that he is a homosexual permits him

to furnish information of value to the Bureau concerning.

persons in the homosexual community, and enable WO to fulfill

its responsibilities for identifying homosexuals in government.

M. EMOTIONAL STABILITY

During contacts with this informant the informant has

exhibited no traits of emotional instability or unreliability,

nor is it known that the informant has furnished any false infor-

mation.

On 11-22-71, the source advised that he had met

an acquaintance of his named ALEXIS KING at the Fairfax

Restaurant, 2100 block of P Street; N. W., WDC, On 11-21-71.

This man offered to sell the source six $20.00 bills, described

as counterfeit by KING, for $100.00. KING said he had more

of these bills if the source was interested.

The source

told KING that he was not interested but recalled that the

first four numbers of each serial number on the bills were

"5152."

The source also advised that he had seen KING

involved in a numbers transaction and that he gathered

from KING that KING was still dealing in numbers.

The information concerning the counterfeit bills

was furnished to SA STEPHEN A. LORD, Washington Field Office,

U. S. Secret Service (USSS).

SA LORD advised that he

considered the information very reliable and valuable in

that three $20.00 counterfeit bills with serial numbers

beginning "5152" had been received very recently by the

USSS. He stated that it is unusual to get information

concerning persons passing such bills before counterfeit

bills are received by the USSS and

investigation to trace

then is instituted.

Based on the information regarding KING's involve-

ment in numbers transactions, the above-captioned 182 case

re KING was opened.

The source furnished certain identifying data re

KING and a possible address for this individual.

On 1/11/72, the source advised that he had visited.

DAVIS at his place of employment and discussed DAVIS'

recent

•activities and a mutual acquaintance.

On 1/14/72, the source advised that he had again

visited DAVIS at his

place of employment and

subsequently

furnished information regarding DAVIS' attitude to the New

Left movement.

On 1/24/72, the source advised that he had talked

with DAVIS on 1/22/72, and that DAVIS had discussed the

possibility of having the source live with him.: He told the

source that he had become much less interested in New Left

activities and was primarily interested in "gay" issues

(DAVIS is a homosexual, according to WF 4015-Cland other

sources).

On 1/27/72, the source advised that DAVIS had told

him that he was staying in a residence near Dupont Circle,

Northwest, Washington, D.C., and was anxious to find a new

permanent residence.

On 2/2/72, the source advised that he was visited

by DAVIS during the early morning hours of 2/2/72. During

the visit, DAVIS told the source about his association with

the Weathermen and particularly that he knew MIKE SPIEGEL

and CATHY WILKERSON, both WEATHFUG subjects, when they lived

in Washington, D.C. before they became fugitives. DAVIS

at first referred to SPIEGEL as MIKE BRADFORD, which may

be an alias being used by SPIEGEL.

It should be noted that WFO is attempting to

obtain information concerning DAVIS' activities, acquaint-

ances, and attitudes; as well as knowledge he might have

concerning CAPBOM or the WEATHrUG subjects. Placing the •

informant in a position where DAVIS will trust him so that

such information can be obtained is a gradual process and

Wro takes this fact into consideration in paying this source.

On 12/8/71, the source advised that he had been

at IPS on 12/7/71, and a person there told him that ARTHUR

WASKOW and others associated with IPS were in a conference

with an individual named WALL (ph). WALL was not further

identified, but was possibly identical with ROBERT WALL, a

former Special Agent of the FBI who was reported to have

visited and talked with persons associated with IPS.

The source had been promised a job at IPS as

ARTHUR WASKOW's assistant. It is noted that among other

activities, WASKOW had in the past been acquainted with two

WEATHrUG subjects, MIKE SPIEGEL and CATHY WILKERSON.

On 12/16/71, the source advised that he talked

with HASKOW on the same date and was told that he was to

On 12/20/71, WASKOW explained the nature of the

job the source was to have and asked the source what his

reaction to police pressure would be.

On 12/27/71, the source talked with WASKOW, who

said that despite a letter from IPS which the source

• had

received to the contrary, the source was still being

considered for the job at IPS. WASKOW stated that he had

"sources" who had indicated that IPS was being infiltrated

by law enforcement agencies and

that

strict screening

procedures, possibly including polygraph tests, were being

adopted regarding new employees and those already associated

with IPS.

vidual reiterated IPS' new screening procedures which were

being adopted to prevent alleged Governnent infiltration.

On 1/27/72, the source was interviewed for three

hours by an attorney for IPS, and RICHARD BARNETT, subject

of WFO 100-45302, Director of IPS, as a part of the screening

program for employment at IPS. He was told that the screening

procedures had been adopted as a result of revelations made

them of law enforcement attempts to obtain information

concerning IPS.

On 4/21/72, the informant advised that he had

talked with DAVIS earlier the same evening. DAVIS discussed

the possibility of traveling to New York in the immediate

future. DAVIS also mentioned that the FBI was continuing

to investigate his activities and that because of this he

had become active in the Movement again. DAVIS said that

he might as well be active because the FBI would keep tabs

on him and his friends whether he was active or inactive.

On 4/23/72, the source advised that he had seen

DAVIS earlier the same morning. DAVIS stated that he would

have to postpone the above-mentioned trip to New York and

regarding certain of DAVIS' associates.

On 4/27/72, the informant advised that earlier the

same evening DAVIS had been at his apartment with a white

noted him carefully, but could not determine whether this

person might resemble one of the WEATHFUG subjects because of

facial hair.

DAVIS also mentioned that he intended to travel to

an unknown location within the next week to visit friends.

• He indicated that he hoped to take the source with him.

On 4/28/72, the informant advised that he talked

with DAVIS the same date. DAVIS talked about FBI "harassment"

and the fact that he would have a visitor the same afternoon

BILL AYERS (WILLIAM CHARLES AYERS). DAVIS said that he had

not

difficult to identify this individual as AYERS but that the

individual bore a resemblance to AYERS; particularly in the

area of his eyes. (WFO has been conducting investigation to

locate and identify this individual identified by DAVIS as

AYERS but efforts to date have met with negative results.)

a check on whether I was

going to the places they

asked me to," he said. Mer-

ritt did not know how police

may have, used this infor

mation, he said

-NW 68262. Doçlds32989698 Page 52-

During the demonstra

tion, Merrit continued, he

telephoned reports to police

up to 16 times a day and

joined with some law en-

forcement offices in at-

tempts to disrupt activities.

These included spreading

false information about

meeting times and places

and sabotaging one of the

public address

systems, he said

After May Day 1971, Mer-

ritt said, police asked him

to concentrate on informa-

tion gained by using an ali-

as to solicit mail from about

200 groups. He said he re-

ceived materials which de-

scribed the programs of the

groups and he turned it over

to the police.

In October 1971, Merritt

said, he was fired by police

because "they said they did

not have enough money to

keep me on a full-time ba-

sis." He said he had been

receiving $50 a week and

expenses. His contacts in-

troduced him to two FBI

agents in the Washington

field office for whom he

subsequently went to work,

BY MERRITT'S account,

his FBI assignments be-

tween October 1971 and

May 1972 centered on the

Institute for Policy Studies.

The FBI wanted him to get

a job there and supply them

with the names and license

tag numbers of persons at

institute meetings, he said.

Merritt said one of the

lists he supplied was from a

meeting on prison abolition

at which a civil rights law-

yer, Philip J. Hirschkop,

spoke. He said he followed

Hirschkop after one of the

meetings at FBI request

and reported the lawyer's

movements and contacts.

Merritt said he worked

for the FBI until May 1972,

a month after his mother

died. He said the death'

"really put me down" and,

together with a beliet that

the persons he was told to

watch did not seem as dan-

gerous as they had been

ortrayed, by his contact

le decided to quit.

He said his FBI contaçts

reacted by "telling me they

had too much time and

money invested ..

. that I

had become familiar with

the political community and

I was trained the way they

wanted-One of them told

me to use the work as a way

to get my mind off my moth-,

er's death.

pattern that had begun four

months earlier of giving as

little information to his con-

tacts as he could, Merritt

said. It worked, he said, and

{the 'FBI agents let him go

with verbal threats against

Merritt said one of the

agents warned him against

speaking out by saying,

"We'di sure hate to have

someone find you in the

Potomac wearing cement

galoshas." He was also told

he had been doing "national

security-type work,

disclosure of which would

be improper, he said.

Merritt said that when the

around, his former police

contacts reappeared. He

decided then to get legal

help in his effort to end as-

sociation with law enforce-

ment agencies and contact-

ed Washington lawyer Da-

vid Isbell, he said.

Merritt said a second

threat came from one of his

police contacts when the

contact learned Merritt was

considering public disclo-

sure as a means of keeping

police away from him. He

said the officer told him, "If

you try to badmouth us or

any other agencies, you'll

really meet your maker."

ACCORDING to the rec-

ords Merritt kept and dis-

played of his associations

and assignments, the last

threat came in July 1973. He

did not know how his former

plan and has had no direct

called

Herington and said that Merritt had furnished the paper information concerning

his prior informant status, claiming to have been a paid FBI informant from

N.

October, 1971, until May, 1972, at which time he was discontinued because he

furnished us false information about Jack Davis. He claimed his assigned task

was to monitor the Institute for Policy Studies, 1520 New Hampshire S-reet,

ExcIsIoNS Noctawest, Washington, D. C., and to keep an eye on Jack Davis, who was

DELETE

associated with the Institute. He said that he had been a police department

& DENTITY informant prior to working for the FBI and

said that this had been con-

firmed by the police. Merritt said that he had been handled by Washington

INDIVIDuAl Field Office Agents William Tucker and Terry O'Connor, and that when he

would hate to have someone find you in the Potomac with cement galoshes."

He also alleged that Tucker threatened to have him prosecuted on three old bad

Herington told

that he would have to get back in touch with

Bureau files reveal that Merritt was a criminal informant

from late 1971 until he was discontinued by Washington Field

letter dated 6/8/72. He was targeted against the Institute for Policy Studies E

and Jack Davis mainly because Davis was considered a Weatherman fugitive

support person and because we had information that some of the Weatherman

fugitives had visited the Institute. Merritt also furnished other valuable

criminal information. Merritt is a homosexual and was determined to be

unreliable, at which point he was discontinued. Although he has not been

in the attorney for the Institute for Policy Studies claiming the FBI and the

Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) were engaged in illegal surveillance

Re: Earl Robert Merritt, Jr.

been furnished to the Civil Rights Division of the Department. Agents who

handled Merritt deny any improper conduct or any improper instructions to

him.

Herington called

back today and told him that as a matter of

policy we simply could not identify individuals who had furnished confidential

information to the FBI in the past and, accordingly, there was nothing at this

time that we could say about Merritt's allegations.

said that he under-

stord and that actually his story was mainly about allegations made by Merritt

claiming MPD misconduct and that very little of the story would pertain to

the FBI. He said that he knew that the Intelligence Division of the MPD was not

terribly sophisticated in its bending of informants. He said also that he knew

that Merritt was a homosexual and that he did not consider him really reliable.

Some of his allegations have not checked out at all in further inquiry by

Herington also pointed out to

that neither/the allegations alleging threats

against Merritt could be interpreted as threats even if the statements had been

made. He was told that we always caution our informants against disclosing

themselves because we are aware that some people might want to exact retribu-

tion against them for having helped the FBI. The statement that we would hate.

to have Merritt found in the Potomac with cement galoshes is the type of thing

that would be an admonishment against his self-disclosure becauses ome of

• his friends might seek revenge.

Herington told

that it was ridiculous

to believe that any FBI Agent would threaten to kill a former informant. It was

also noted that with regard to the second allegation about the prosecution on

checks, this does not necessarily have to be interpreted as a threat either since

it was obvious that Merritt's surfacing himself with a lot of publicity might

cause the victims of those checks to urge a current prosecution.

said that he took everything Merritt said with a grain of salt.

of course, was formerly with the Police Foundation and says

• he knows Mr. Kelley personally. He has generally been pro law enforcement in

our limited dealings with him During this conversation he said that he

•sympathized with the law enforcement's position in dealing with informants

but that he had been assigned to write a story, which he would have to do. He

said he didn't really think that what he wrote would hurt the FBI and indicated

that the story should be forthcoming within the next several days.

In answer to Me. Kelley's question "any untruths

the following

should be noted:

Merritt's claim of having performed illegal

acts for the FBI has been denied by the Special Agents who

directed him.

Merritt's claim that he was hired. by wro at $50

He was paid, on a c.o.à. vasis,

Purpose of contact was to determine whether Martin was

matter at the request of the Civil Rights Division (CRD),

Department of Justice, and to ascertain, if possible, the nature

of the allegations made by Merritt.

Martin said he understood the CPD had received

had

made some effort to contact the CRD concerning this matter

but that he had never actually spoken with anyoue in the CRD

relative to it.

provided directly to the WSPF by Merritt who he said was

publicly identified as a former informant for the FBI.

Martin said he was aware of the FD-302's prepared by SAs

Tucker and O'Connor relative to their knowledge of Merritt's

activities as an informant and that he did not feel these

FD-302's covered the current allegations.

At this point, Martin was asked point blank what

these "new allegations" consisted of, and whether the CRD,

which has been handling this case, was aware of them. Martin

replied that the use of the word "allegation" in the WSPF

letter had perhaps been a mistake as it was quite 'strong," but

that the new information centered around a claim made by Merritt

that the FBI had received stolen mail from Merritt knowing

it to bei stolen.

In this regard, Merritt claims that he took

mail from the Institute for Policy Studies (IPS), Washington,

D. C., turned it over to one of the two VIC Agents, who later

returned it to Merritt with instructions to return it to the

IPs office.

Martin stated Merritt had furnished WSPF with

additional information and allegations concerning the FBI but

that after looking into Merritt's background and considering

the information, that he, Martin, did not feel that this

additional information had any merit whatsoever. He said he

could not, however, permit the charge

of receiving stolen mail

to "lay in his files," and that it was for this reason he

desired to interview

SAs O'Connor and Tucker.

It was then pointed out to Martin that FD-302 dated

6/28/73, prepared by SAs Tucker and O'Connor noted receipt

from Merritt on one occasion of an envelope containing some

material which herritt explained had cone from the trash at

IPS.

Although the Agents did not closely examine all of the

material, it did appear to be trash.

No inventory was made of

all the items and the material was returned to Merritt as soon

as he could again be contacted at which time he was told that

if the material belonged in the trash it IPS, that is where it

should be placed. Merritt was also told again as he had before

that the FBI never wanted him to obtain such materials from the

IPS and that the only other materials provided by Merritt from

IPS were leaflets intended for the public.

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall

Re:

Unknown Subjects; Marcus Raskin and

the Institute for Policy Studies-Victims

Martin said he was aware of this FD-302 and its

contents but that he continued to feel the necessity of

Interviewing SAs Tucker and O'Connor relative to Merritt's

claim. He stated, however, that he was not in any rush to

Interview the Agents, since he desired to review the CRD

file in this matter prior to such interview.. At this point

the conversation was terminated.

It should be noted that at one point during the

conversation, Martin commented that, "It's not a place where

our jurisdiction is very strong," (apparently referring to

WSPF investigation of Merritt's

latest allegations) but that

the WSPF did have some standing in the matter since the

Incident "could" have arisen from pressure exerted by The

White House.

For information and utilization in preparing response

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall

Re: Earl Robert Merritt

it is noted that Merritt was told that the FBI was interested

in information concerning John Rankin Davis, who was then a

suspect in the 3/1/71 bombing of the U.S. Capitol Building

and was also believed by FO to possibly be in contact with

some of the Weatherman fugitives. Merritt advised the Agents

May of 1971.

that he had first met Davis, 1970n he knew as Jack Davis, 1n

From January,

to May, 1972,

reported

conversations he said he had with Davis concerning his weathermar

associates, reported information he believed linked Davis with

the Capitol Building bombing, reported that he had seen Davis with

an individual Davis said was

Weatherman fugitive William Ayers

and reported on several occasions that Davis had wanted him to

accompany Davis to New York and wanted him to rent an apartment

as a safehouse for fugitives.

On 5/30/72 when Merritt claimed

he had talked with Davis in Washington, D. C., Davis was being

interviewed by Bureau Agents at Lake Ariel, Pennsylvania. During

the interview, Davis related having met an

individual in

Washington, D. C., known to him as

"Butch" whom he suspected was

an informant. He related

• "Butch" on one or two occasions attempted

to persuade him to travel to New York and once talked about

renting an apartment as a

safehouse for fugitives.

After reviewing

the above, WFO felt "Butch" was identical with Merritt, that

doubt had

been cast on his credibility, and therefore, he was

discontinued as an informant.

By teletype 11/20/74, which is attached, Special

Agents O'Conner and Tucker categorically denied Merritt's allegations.

OBSERVATIONS:

Davis was never a target of any Cointelpro, which

program was discontinued 4/28/71, nor was he*targeted against

Davis in any way which can be interpreted as counterintelligence.

in reporting on Davis, lied

to WFO Agents regarding Davis in order to obtain money. In a

an FBI informant, outlined his activities as an informant,

Including targets assigned to him, methods of payment and

reasons

why he ceased his informant activities. In the article, Merritt

lied about performing illegal acts for the FBI and lied about his

payments. Merritt's present allegations to Orr Kelly that he

carried out tactics like those described in Cointelpro are false,

and this appears to be another attempt by him to obtain notoriety.

RECOMMENDA TION :

That the allegations by Merritt to Orr Kelly be

categorically denied.

Beginning with the conversation on October 1, 1971,

Merritt stated that he spent a great deal of tire at the

Institute for Policy Studies (125), Hashington, D. C. (uit).

and visitco then Eroquently at TiS.

linking certain of the Weatheman fugitives with persons e

ployed at IPs, principally Arthur koskoy and barcus taskin.

The association auong these persons had existed before these

It might also result

arrangements were made without his knowledge but that the job

would begin after January 1, 1972. Prior to that Gate, lestow

maintained by the Bureau relating to him be made available

for his inspection and copying under the Freedom of Infor-

the law and existing regulations.

It is noted that in 1970 and 1971, Merritt was the

subject of an interstate transportation of stolen property

Re: Earl Robert Merritt, Jr.

After being closed, Merritt disclosed his former

relationship. with the Bureau

to representatives of the media.

He made some untrue statements, including the allegation that

WFO Agents had threatened his life in an attempt to insure

that he never reveal his role as an informant.

The proper response to Merritt's request is, of

Other than the aforementioned ITSP case, the

only investigation of Merritt which is reflected in the

informant file is a check of appropriate local criminal

agencies when he was opened as a PCI:

Merritt provided information in matters within

our jurisdiction, but these of course do not relate to him

as a subject or

suspect, and would notappear to fall within

the scope of his request.

It is further noted that in regard to those

investigations in which he provided information, his

issistance was in the torn of an investigative technique,

which we are not required to disclose under Section b(7)

of the Act.

RECOMMENDATION:

Unless the Office of Legal Counsel is of the •

opinion that we must furnish material from Merritt's

informant file, it is recommended that by appropriate

communication,

he be advised that the information

contained in that file is being denied him.

To advise of article appearing in 3/23/75 edition of

"The Washington Post," to the effect that information furnished

by captioned individual to both the fBI and Washington

detopolitau Police Department ((PD) while acting as an

informant is nostly irrelevant.

DETAILS:

"The Washington Post" edition of 3/23/75, on page

C-1 contains an article (attached), captioned "Informant's

Data Mostly Irrelevant, " which refers to approximately 50

pounds of material compiled by Earl Robert Merritt for the

combined time he served as

an informant for both the

Washington MPD and the FBI.

The article contains no

allegations against the IBI, but highlights the super-

ficiality of information accumulated by Merritt during

the

late 1960s and carly 1970s.

Nierritt clains he was paid

approxinately $1,500 by the MPD covering the period April

to October, 1971, and then he became an informant of the

IBI until June, 1972, collecting another $3,000.

Review of Bureau files indicates that Merritt,

lan admitted homosexual, vas a paid crininal informant of

the washington Field Otice (inO) food october had been

until he was discontinued June J.,

as doubt

cast upon his credibility. Diring that period, he vas

paid for information furnished on a c.o.d.

basis, a total

he was in contact with Weatherman fugitives. From January,

1972,

to lay, 1972, he reported on conversations he reportedly

with Weatherman

associates.

On 5/30/72, however, he

reported on a conversation he was supposed to have had with

Davis in Washington, D. C., on the same date that Davis was

being interviewed by Bureau Agents in another pari of the

country.

Further, during

the latter interview, Davis

described Merritt

to Bureau Agents as an individual he

believed to be an informant. Services of Nerritt were then

discontinued.

In 9/74, Merritt related to a news reporter that

he had carried out, for the Bureau,

tactics described in

the then recently released COIntileRo report, nearly a

year and

a half after the program was ordered halted, and he

made several allegations of improper conduct on the part of

OBSERVATIONS:

The above article appears to be prefaced upon

another attempt by Merritt to obtain notoriety. As the

article contains no allegations against either the Bureau

o1 its personnel, no additional action is deemed nec-

essary by this Bureau.

Two Lift Curtain on Undercover Work

Tell of Successes, Failures as Infiltrators of Antiwar Groups....

By Paul W. Valentine

WashIngton Post Staff Writer

Two men who infiltrated

the antiwar movement here

for the FBI and D.C. police

from 1970 through 1972 have

described their operations,

parting the curtain momen-

tarily on the tangled world

of the political undercover

informant.

In interviews with The

Washington Post, they de-

tailed their successes,

fail-

ures, a few absurdities, but

most of all the personal con-

fusion, ambivalence and ag.

ony they said they endured

in doing such work for the

country.

Much of their work, they

said, was superficial and pe-

ripheral, and in the long run

they provided little

they

could judge as being of real

consequence.

The FBI, in keeping with

lime-honored tradition, does

not officially acknowledge

that either man worked for

the agency. But it has been

independently

determined

that both were utilized

as

men and other law enforce-

ment officers are "working

infusion of Catholic conserv-

atism, they are naturally an-

tagonistic toward the "smart

While Barrett' perceives

himself as a person strug.

and the left. Merrilt said his

fundamental lack of educa-

tion in the realm of politics

of either the left or the

right made it difficult for

him to penetrate the anti-

war movement with any real

activist credibility.

"But there were other

peoute there, too, who were

just as naive and ignorant

as I was," he

said,

"SO I

didn't stick out like a sore

thumb."

Merritt first entered the

world of undercover surveil-

lance when he was recruited

by the Washington police

department to do criminal

narcotics work in the Du-

pont Circle area in mid-1970.

With the build-up in prep-

arations for the massive an-

tiwar Mayday protests the

following spring, however,

he was switched to the po-

lice intelligence division. He

was assigned the code name

"Butch" and control number

16.

•The police

department

confirmed his identity but,

flike the FBI. would not dis-

muss details of his job.

Merritt said police intelli-

geried recruiters specifically

sought him because they

wanted a "white gay male"

to cultivate antiwar gay ac-

tivist Jack Davis who was

reputed to be organization-

ally close to Rennie Davis

protester and a chief archi-

But Merritt did not get

important information on ei-

ther of the Davises to police.

Soft spoken and clean sha-

ven with short red hair,

Merritt said he triea to

organizational

meetings by playing the role

of "just another activist."

Paddling about from one

antiwar office to another in

Washington,

said, he did odd jobs as a

"volunteer" while noting au-

tomobile tag numbers and

the names and addresses of

activists and phoning them

in regularly to the police in-

te'ligence division.

In adition to monitoring

the presence of

Barrett says he attempted to

determine if any of the se.

copied at IPS. He said he

was also asked to find out

details about a "delegation"

former paid informant. The

surveillance began at least

two years ago, the informer

said.

Police said reports based

on informers' information

were given regularly to the

have been passed to the

White House. One informer

said his tactics included

burglary and disruption of

protests.

ants, but they and the FBI

would not give details of the

undercover work.

Merritt and Miss Kolego's

former roommates describ

ed the activities in inter-

vielvs.

Merritt, who went from

work with the police to work

with the FBI, is a Charles-

ion, ly. Va., man who came

to Washington in January

1963 and works as a drug

company cashier.

Miss Kolego grew up in

the Washington area and,

until recently, was a wait-

ress in a Connecticut Ave-

cided to disclose his under-

cover role after other ef

forts to break off the work

recently and after he was

threatened twice by offi-

cials.

He said he did not know

how groups or persons were

one of keeping "the chief of

MERRITT SAID he

gained entry to the book-

store after closing hours by

taping open the lock on a

foyer door. He took antiwar

petitions, pamphlets, meet-

ing notices. and other mate-

rials and give them to police

contacts who told him they

would be a source of names

of persons and groups in the

protest community, Merritt

According to Merritt,

stealing the petitions was

one means his contacts used

to disrupt the petitioning

part of the protests.

There was no police re-

port of the break-in at the

bookstore, which features

the writings of revolution

ary theorists and practition-

ers. But persons at the shop

recall such an incident in

late May 1971 and said

one attached any signifi-

cance to it at the time.

Before and after the big

May Day 1971 antiwar pro-

test, Merritt said, he visited

the offices used by groups

largely responsible for the

protest: the People's Coali-

tion on Peace and Justice,

Vietnam Veterans Against

the War, and the Lanier

Place residence used by

some demonstration plan-

ners.

AT POLICE request,

Merritt said, he supplied

telephone numbers and

«•floor plans for these offices.

"I thought at the time it was

a check on whether 1 was

going to the places they

asked me to," he said. Mer-

ritt did not know how police

may have used this infor

mation, he said

During the demonstra-

tion, Merrit contthued, he

telephoned reports to police

up to 16 times a day and

Joined with some law en-

forcement offices in at-

tempts to disrupt activities.

These included spreading

false information, about

meeting times and places

and sabotaging

one of the

protestors'

public address

systems, he said.

After May Day 1971, Mer-

ritt said, police asked him

to concentrate on informa-

tion gained by using an ali-

as to solicit mail from about

200 groups. He said he re-

ceived materials which de-

scribed the programs of the

groups and he turned it over

to the police.

In October 1971, Merritt

said, he was fired by police

because "they said they did

not have enough money to

keep me on a full-time ba-

sis." He said he had been

receiving $50 a week and

expenses.

His contacts in-

troduced him tò two FBI

agents in the Washington

field office for whom he

subsequently went to work,

he said.

BY MERRITT'S, account,

his FBI assignments be-

tween October 1971 and

May 1972 centered on the

Institute for Policy Studies.

The FBI wanted him to get

a job there and supply them

with the names and license

tag numbers of persons at

institute meetings, he said.

Merritt said one of the

lists he supplied was from a

meeting on prison abolition

at which a civil rights law-

yer, Philip J. Hirschkop,

spoke. He said he followed

Hirschkop after one of the

meetings at FBI request

and reported the lawyer's

movements and contacis.

Merritt said he worked

for the FBI until May 1972,

a month after his mother

died. He said the death

"really put me down" and,

together with a belief that

the persons he was told to

watch did not seem as dan-

gerous as they had been

portrayed by his contacts,

he decided to quit.

Ho said his FBI contasts

reacied by "telling me they

had too much time and

money invested

• that I

had become familiar with

the political community and

I was trained the way they

wanted. One of them told

me to use the work as a way

o er's death.

IN MAY, however, he de-

liberately filed

port as the last step in a

pattern that had begun four

months earlier of giving as

little information to his con-

tacts as he could, Merritt

said. It worked, he said, and

¡the FBI agents let him. go

with verbal threats against

revealing his role.

Merritt said one of the

agents warned him against

speaking out by saying,

"We'd sure hate to have

someone find you in the

Potomac wearing cement

galoshas." He was also told

he had been doing "national

security-type work," the

disclosure of which would

Merritt said that when the

agents stopped coming

around, his former police

contacts reappeared. He

decided then to get legal

help in his effort to end as-

sociation with law enforce-

ment agencies and contact-

ed Washington lawyer Da-

vid Isbell, he said.

Merritt said a second

threat carhe from one of his

police contacts when the

contact learned Merritt was

considering public disclo-

sure as a means of keeping

police away from him. He

said the officer told him, "If

try to badmouth us or

any'other agencies, you'll

really meet your maker."

ACCORDING to the rec-

ords Merritt kept and dis-

played of his associations

and assignments, the last

threat came in July 1973. He

did not know how his former

contact had learned of his

plan and has had no direct

contact with police since, he

from George Washington

THE TRANSFER of in-

ants to the White House was

unknown to Merritt or any

of the other informants with

whom

Star-News

talked. But in the Water-

gate committee testimony

of John IV. Dean III, Dean

recalled receiving intelli-

gence reports from District

police.

Merritt said he had

collaborated with an agent

from the Alexandria office

of the Alcohol,

Tax and

Firearms Division of the

Treasury who, like Merritt,

was gathering intelligence

on May Day 1971 activities.

According to Merritt, the

agent told him his unusual

assignment to

intelligence

duties stemmed from a Jus-

tice Department order for

all federal agencies and

some local police to provide

reports on protests or plans.

The unit usually deals with

violations of alcohol, tax

and.firearms law.

Department

officials

close to the intelligence

units of May Day 1971 de-

clined comment: However

one source said estimates of

the numbers and plans of

protesters had been passed

regularly from Justice to

the White House and Dean.

The source said he did not

know where the information

came from and had as-

simed trivas from the FBT."

WASHLYGION: D.C. 20535

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

OCTOBER 31, 1975

Recently a number of allegations made by Earl Robert

Merritt, Jr., charged FBI Special Agents Terry O'Connor and

William Tucker with certain improper and possibly illegal acts.

These charges have been publicized extensively in the news.

media.

The FBI initially felt constrained from commenting

on these allegations because. of certain pending civil litigation

in which Merritt is involved as a witness.

Now, however,

because of the apparent authority being gained by these

allegations through repetition in the media, and because of

their effect on the two Agents involved and their families,

the FBI feals that it should respond to these allegations. In

doing so, care is being taken to insure that this response will in

no way interfere with a fair adjudication of the civil proceedings.

Specifically, the allegations are that Merritt committed

break-ins and thefts on behalf of the FBI; that there were

indications that Merritt was encouraged to develop an intimate

relationship with another indiviäual to obtain information; that

he was asked to testify improperly concerning the 1972 Pentagon

bombing; and that he was asked to report gossip concerning

members of congress.

These allegations are fabricated and

completely false.

MW 68262: Docld:32989698 Page 109

## Page 110

: Merritt initially contacted the FBI in october,

1971, indicating that he wished to furnish information to the

FBI and receive compensation for this information.. No pressure

was used to influence Merritt as his activities wece clearly

voluntary. Merritt was never instructed, ordered or in any-

waY

encouraged to break into or otherwise illegally enter any

establishment or to commit any thefts or any other illegal

acts. He was never requested by the FBI to be a witness in any

fashion concerning the Pentagon bombing. or to report rumois

concerning members of Congress. Additionally, at no time was

Merriit encouraged or instructed to develop an intimate or

improper selationship with anyone.

As a matter of fact, Merritt was specifically advised

on several occasions that he was not to engage in any illegal

activities in his efforts to obtain information and,. further;

that he was not to construe his furnishing. information to the

FBI as a shieid from prosecution for illegal activities.

Merritt was at no time an employee of the FBI. He

was not regularly salaried but was paid on a C.O.D. basis for :

information furnished. • His relationship with the FBI was

terminated in early june, 1972, when it was determined

l. that

certain information furnished by him was unreliable.

The FBI categorically denies that the activities of

the Agents in contact with Merritt were at any time improper

YEAGER advised that all of these checks were

XEAGER recalled that on May 4, 1970, he received

a telephone call from a woman representing herself to be

a customer of the bank named COCHRAN.

She said that her

nephew was in town and wanted to cash a check. YEAGER told

her that this would be okay, however, he requested that she

endorse the check.

A short time later, a white male, 5'9" - 5'10" tall,

170 pounds, age about 28, came to the bank with the first of

the above described checks.

It had not been endorsed by

COCHRAN; however, the man

did have a savings statement for

COCHRAN and YEAGER decided that this would be satisfactory.

COCHRAN approved the check for payment and did the same for

another check on May 6, 1970.

YEAGER does not know if he

would recognize this individual again or not.. After these

checks and one other were returned, YEAGER called the

phone number listed on one of the checks by MONROE 202-338-

3100. He found that this was listed to a medical credit

association for whom MONROE worked at one time.

This

firm

has received numerous complaints about MONROE.

This

firm's employment record shows that he gave a previous

address as C. P. FRISBY, 5729 Midland Drive, Charleston,"

W. Va., phone 925-5313.

YEAGER also talked to a Mr. OSCAR L. COCHRAN,

57292 Midland Drive, who is a brother to WILLIAM JOSEPH

COCHRAN. OSCAR L. COCHRAN knew of no one by the name of

JAMES R. MONROE, but he does have a nephew of EARL ROBERT

MERRITT who has

worked in Washington, D. C., and wbo has been

in trouble before.

YEAGER believes that WILLIAM J. COCHRAN, their

customer, is now a teacher in Mississippi. He received a

advised that she cashed checks for JAMES R. MONROE

on May 4, 6 and 7, 1970.

The checks which were handled on May 4 and May 6,

were approved by Vice President W. D. YEAGER. DIDAS did

not get YEAGER's approval for the check cashed May 7, 1970.

DIDAS recalled that on May 7, MONROE deliberately waited

until she was available to cash his check when he could

have gotten faster service by going to one of the other

tellers.

She described MONROE as & white male, age 27,

6° tall, weighing 160 pounds and a thin buila.

He had

medium brown hair and a thin face. She believes he was

wearing a dark checkered coat. He had a red complexion.

she would recognize him if she saw him again.

with fingerprint card signatures due to the lack of comparable

text and because of variations which were not explained.

On July 7, 1970, the FBI Identification Division,

Latent Fingerprint Section, advised as follows:

Three specimens, Q1 through 3 (three checks)

No latent prints of value developed on Q1 through Q3.

IDENTITY OF SEPARATE DISCONTINUED INFORMANT DELETED AS

Joseph Anthony Barrett, who is mentioned in the

article, was a security informant of WFO from 10/70 to 0/73.

He originally contacted Weo in 5/70 ana volunteered his

services.

He was approved as a potential security informant

in 10/70 after wnich he reported on demonstrations by

Vietnam Veterans Against the War (VVAW), National Peace

Action Coalition

and Peoples Coalition

for Peace and Justice.

He reported on the activities of IPS personnel who were

involved in Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) and he

reported on the planning for mass demonstrations in

Washington, D.C., by Rennie Davis.

Barrett traveled to Miami

the activities of

dissident groups and

individuals at the Democratic and Republican National Convention

In the Summer of 1972.

He subsequently provided iniormation

abat the demonstrations at the Presidential Inauguration in

1/73. In 6/73 he was discontinued as an informant at his

second job and

would not be able to obtain information for

the FBI and he had

also developed great animosity for the

people such as those at IPS about whom he was reporting and,

therefore, could not provide competent coverage.

yaH AS 543 +993:2815225-5222 289506095 ТРОЙ Я РЕДОПРОМАЗ

IPS, which is mentioned in the article, was the

subject of a preliminary inquiry by the FBI in 11/68

after information was

received indicating a possible connection

between IPS and SDS.

The investigation was expanded in 1971

after li was determined that IPS planned to embark on a five year

plan for the radical reconstruction of American society and

had circulated to radical groups around the country a document

calling for brigades to

descend on Washington, D.C., and close

down Government agencies.

The current investigation of IPS

is directed toward those

areas in which violations of Federal

statutes may be developed in view of the activities of IPS

personnel Involving the Middle East and the Arabs,

North and South Vietnam, Tanzania and the Pan-African Movement and

contacts with subversive organizations and individuals in the

United States.

RE:

137-28343

19s-20 Anthony Barrett

OBSERVATIONS:

In answer to Mr. Kelley's question "any untruths

In this story?"

the following should be noted;

Merritt's claim of having performed illegal

acts for the FBI has been denied by

the Special

Agents who

directed him.

Merritt's claim that he was hired by WrO at $50

to $75 a week is inaccurate.

He was paid, on a c.o.d, basis,

In varied amounts

between $20 and $30

. which were paid on

various dates two to five times per month beginning in 10/71

and ending in 5/72 for a total amount of $1,570.

Informant while at the Republican National Convention after

seeing a VAll member on crutches stumble and unable to get

out oi the tear gas is questionable, since ne continued u

furnish information for several months thereafter for which he

was paid both services and expenses.

Barrett's claim that he was paid only expenses but no

salary Is not totally correct. While not paid a salary, Barrett

was reimbursed for his expenses and in addition was paid more than

$2,500 on a c.o.d. basis for services.

It should also be noted that WrO advised at the

time Barrett was discontinued as an informant he advised he

still had the greatest admiration for the FBI and agreed

wholeheartedly that he would not reveal his work, written or

oxal, with the Bureau.

RECOMP-ENDATION:

None.

Disector Sec'y a

On 10/2/73 ted Stout Of the "Washington Star-News" called

Herington and said that Merritt had furnished the paper information concerning

his prior informant status, claiming to have been a paid FBI informant from

October, 1971, until May, 1972, at which time he was discontinued because he

furnished us false information about Jack Davis. He claimed his assigned task.

was to monitor the Institute for Policy Studies, 1520 New Hampshire Street,

Narthwest, Washington, D. C., and to keep an eye on Jack Davis, who was

associated with the Institute. He said that he had been a police department

informant prior to working for the FBI and Stout said that this had been con-

firmed by the police. Merritt said that he had been handled by Washington

Field Office Agents William Tucker and Terry O'Connor, and that when he.

was discontinued in May, 1972, Tucker had threatened him by saying, "We

would hate to have someone find you in the Potomac with cement galoshes."

He also alleged that Tucker threatened to have him prosecuted on three old bạa

check charges in which Merritt was involved.

Herington told Stout that he would have to get back in touch with

him later. Bureau files reveal that Merritt was a criminal informant

.. (WF 4015-C) from late 1971 until he was discontinued by Washington Field

letter dated 6/8/72. He was targeted against the Institute for Policy Studies

and Jack Davis mainly because Davis was considered a Weatherman fugitive

support person and because we had information that some of the Weatherman

fugitives had visited the Institute. Merritt also furnished other valuable

criminal information. Merritt is a homosexual and was determined to be

unreliable, at which point he was discontinued. Although he has not been

identified by name, we believe he is responsible for allegations which resulted

in the attorney for the Institute for Policy Studies claiming the FBI and the

Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) were engaged in illegal surveillance

Of' is activities and other illegal conduct. We conducted a preliminary civil

rights investigation on these allegations in August, 1973, and the results hare?

Callahan

Re: Earl Robert Merritt, Jr.

been furnished to the Civil Rights Division of the Department. Agents who

handled Merritt deny any improper conduct or any improper instructions to

him.

Herington called Stout back today and told him that as a matter of

policy we simply could not identify individuals who had furnished confidential

information to the FBI in the past and, accordingly, there was nothing at this

time that we could say about Merritt's allegations. Stout said that he under-

stood and that actually his story was mainly about allegations made by Merritt

claiming MPD misconduct and that very little of the story would pertain to

the FBI. He said that he knew that the Intelligence Division of the MPD was not

terribly sophisticated in its handing of informants. He said also that he knew

that Merritt was a homosexual and that he did not consider him really reliable.

Some of his allegations have not checked out at all in further inquiry by Stout.

Herington also pointed out to Stout that neither/the allegations alleging threats

against Merritt could be interpreted as threats even if the statements had been

made. He was told that we always caution our informants against disclosing

themselves because we are aware that some people might want to exact retribu-

tion against them for having helped the FBI. The statement that we would hate

to have Merritt found in the Potomac with cement galoshes is the type of thing

that woula be an admonishment against his self-disclosure because/some of

his friends might seek revenge.

Herington told Stout that it was ridiculous

to believe that any FBI Agent would threaten to kill a former informant. It was

also noted that with regard to the second allegation about the prosecution on

checks, this does not necessarily have to be interpreted as a threat either since

it was obvious that Merritt's surfacing himself with a lot of publicity might

cause the victims of those checks to urge a current prosecution.

Stout said that he took everything Merritt said with a grain of salt.

Stout, of course, was formerly with the Police Foundation and says

• he knows Mr. Kelley personally. He has generally been pro law enforcement in

our limited dealings with him During this conversation he said that he

sympathized with the law enforcement's position in dealing with informants

but that he had been assigned to write a story, which he would have to do. He

said he didn't really think that what he wrote would hurt the FBi and indicated

that the story should be forthcoming within the next several days.
