: L Sit JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992 Jen

7]

Januar 22, 1965.

Sul Subjects Gontact with Mr. Kimsey after his Separation from CIA.

As my former supervisor for 6 years: in the Agency, Mr. K. apparently

wanted to keep up a superficial social contact with me, Every 3 or 4 months, he

called me at home or in the office; as a rule, first to inform me of seme article or

TV program which could be of interest to ne or my husband, and second, to inform

me of his various professional prospects. As far as I recall, there were two or

three meetings for lunch in the cafeteria across the road fron the West Gut Building

and one dinner invitation in our hone, The first lunch meeting may have been in

‘spring 1963. Lecording'to my recollection, Mr. K,. gave ne.the reproduction of 2...

small English handwriting specimen which was supposedly written by the Grand

Duchess “Anastasia of Russie, -Mr. K, asked me to send a short report to Cleve

Baxter, New York City, who vas working‘on the case thet a woman Eugenia Snith

elained to: ba “Anastasia”. I sent a report thet the questioned docunent was pro-

pably written by an English speaking person to Cleve Baxter.

of

(I had met Cleve

Baxter previously at an Academy for the ‘Advencenent/Science meeting in New York.

Mr. K. had claimed that C.B. is his friend and former business associate and thet

he had worked for GIA.). To my knowledge, this was the only connection of Mr. K.

with my_work for the "Anastasia casé. —

In summer 1963, we got suddenly & telephone call from Mr. K. informing us

that he had gotten ma-rried and had returned from his honeyzoon trip to San Fran-

cisco for which he had used up his retirenent money. In ®ugust or Septesher 1963,

ve invitad him and his wife Lois (whom he wanted us to neet) for esata in our

house, Lois was a good-looking, very lively woren, around ferty, who made so much

soall talk that, to our amazement, Mr. K. hardly said a word, My husband and I,

vota had the impression that the rarriage would not last long. - In April 1964,

et



areas
Mr. K. called me up dgain, because he had to tell me sonething. We met for lunch
in the cafeteria, and he told me most confidentially that Lois had left him and
lived in an-apartment downtown . They simply had not teen able to get along. That

vas the last tine I sav Mr. Ke ; !

Since that time, there cannot heve been rore than 2 or 3 telephone calls.

He never informed ne nbout his job with the Goldwater campaign; this, I heard

through the grapevine in the Agency. ~The last time, Pheard from Mr. K. was a

telephone call in the Agency shortly before Christras, He asked for ny address

. (which is in the. telephone book), apparently in order %o, send us a Christmas card. :
Then“he “told ne sone details about Mr. Goldwater's ‘handwriting, as if he had reread
me about his previous assignment, And when I asked him about his professional pro-

spects, -he stated that there are new develo sents in New York regarding the 4
Upnastasia" case and that he is “going te have a hand in this. As I did not ask any |
further questions, this was the end of the conversetion. — The"next thing I-saw,

was. the "Daily News™ article, Gorraecen

Subject: My Work for. the "Anastasia! Case. i

—_— Ss

In September 1963, I received various late night telephone calls from Cleve
Baxter in New York City, explaining details of the casé involving Eugenia Smith
who claims to be “Anastasial, C.B. asked me to look over the handwriting material '

nts related to it which could give some p chological clues.

_ As I left the following weekend for Puerto Rico, C.3. sent the handwriting mater-

ial (fron 1912 to 1963) te the hotel there, aste: for an early reply. - I sent a |

report regarding psychologica?. aspects in the development of the handwriting, more
or less es a basis for the work which would have to be done by a questioned document

examiner. After that, I did not hear much anymore, except that the publisher

Speller and Co. (for whom C.B. was, working)’ Bertin a copy of the book "Anastasia",


pene rt

I never made a handwriting analysis of the case, and the bill for the work I had
dons was never paid, To my knowledge, in this phase of my work, there was not

any connection with Mr. K., and he was not even mentioned in my conversations with
Cleve Baxter. -

Two weeks ago, Mr. Baxter sent me (without comment) the reprint of a Now
Hampshire newspaper, in which the appearance of the former “Czar, a former CIA
agent, @ Polish GQKX1 Col. G., was mentioned. I marked this passage and brought
it to.the office, where John Gittinger forwarded it immediately to Faul Gaynor,

ned.a few day:

Subdject: “The Former CIA Agent, the Polish Col. G.

In my contacts with Mr. K. and with Cleve Baxter, this men was never mentioned
and I did not know of his existence, until I read the article in the New Hampshire
_newspaper. It goes without seying ‘that I never ade a graphological analysis of his
hendwriting, as-per their request. -

It is possible that I did work for the Agency on this man's handwriting under |

some cover number or crypt, but up to new, we have not yet been able to identify it.
