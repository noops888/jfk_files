2022 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992 ....

Januar 22, 1965.

Subiact:

Contact with Mr. Kinsey after his Separation from CIA.

As my forner supervisor for 6 jears in the Agency, Mr. K. apparently

wanted to keep up a superficial social contact with me. Every 3 or 4 months, he

called me at home or in the office; as a rule, first to inform me of sone article or

TV progran which could be of interest to he or my husband, and secord, to inforn

me of his various professional prospects. As far as I recall, there were two or

three neetings for lunch in the cafeteria across the road from the West Out Building

and one dinner invitation in our hone. The first lunch meeting may have been in

spring 1963. According to ry recollection, Mr. Ke save re the reproduction of a

small Inglish handwriting specimen which was supposedly written by the Grand

Duchess "Anastasial of Russia, Mr. K. asked me to send a short report to Cleve

Baxter, New Tork City, who was working on the case that a woman Eugenia Snith

clained to be "Anastasia". I sent a report that the questioned document was pro-

bably written by an English speaking person, to Cleve Baxter. (I had met Cleve

Baxter previously at an Academy for the Advancement/Science meeting in New York.

Vr. K. had clained that C.B. is his friend and forner business associate and that

he had worked for CIA.). To my knowledge, this was the only connection of Mr. I.

with nv work for the "Anastasial case. -

In sunner 1963, we got suddenly & telephone call from Mr. K. informing us

that he had gotten narried and had returned from his honeymoon trip to San Fran-

cisco for which he had used un his retirement money. In hugust or September 1963,

we invitad him and his wife lois (whom he wanted us to meet) for dinner in our

house. Lois was

a good-looking, very lively woman, around forty, who made so nuch

sull trilk that, to our amazenent, Mr. K. hardly said a word. My husband and I,

both had the inpression that

the marriage would not last long. - In April 1964,

Mr. K. called ne up again, because he had to tell me sonething. We met for lunch

in the cafeteria, and he told me most confidentially that Lois had left him and

lived in an apartment downtown. They simply had not been able to get along. That

was the last time I saw Mr. K.--

Since that time, there cannot have been nore than 2 or 3 telephone calls.

He never informed he about his job with the Goldwater campaign; this, I heard

through the grapevine in the Agency. - The last time, I heard fron MI. k. was

telephone call in the Agency shortly before Christras. He asked for ny address

• (which is in the telephone book) , apparently in order to serd us a Christmas card.

Then he told me sone details about tr. Goldwater's handwriting, as if he had inferned

me about his previous assignment. And when I asked him about his professional pro-

spects, he stated that there are new devalopients in new fork regarding the

"Anastasia"' case and that he is going to have a hand in this. As I did not ask any

further questions, this was the end of the conversation. - The next thing I saw,

was the '"Daily News article..

Subiect: My Work for the "Anastasia" Case.

In September 1963, I received various late night telephone calls from Cleve

Baxter in New Iork City, explaining details of the case involving Eugenia Smith

who claims to he "inastasia". C.B. asked re to look over the handwriting raterial

he has and sake any couments related to it which could give some psychological clues.

- As I left the following weekend for Fuerto Rico, C.B. sent the handwriting nater-

ial (fron 1912 to 1963) to the hotel there, astong for an early reply. - I sent a

report regarding psychologica' aspects in the development of the handwriting, more

or less is a basis for the work which would have to be done by a questioned document

examiner. After that, I did not hear nuch anymore, except that the publisher

Speller and Co. (for whom C.B. was working) sentime a copy of the book "Anastasial

I never made a handwriting analysis of the case, and the bill for the work I had

done was never paid. To my knowledge, in this phase of my work, there was not

any connestion with Mr. K., and he was not even mentioned in my conversations with

Cleve Baxter. -

Iwo weeks ago, Mr. Baxter sent me (without connert) the reprint of a New

Hampshire neuspaper, in which the appearance of the former "Czar", a former CIA

agent, A Polish XXXx1307 Col. G., was mentioned.. I marked this passage and brought

it to the office, where John Gittinger forwarded it Immediately to Paul Gaynor,

fron where it was returned a few days later. -

Subject:

The Former CIA Agent, the Polish Gol. G.

In my contacts with Mr. K. and with Cleve Baxter, this man was never mentioned

and I did not know of his existencs; until I read the article in the New Hampshire

newspaper. It goes without saying that I never rade a graphological analysis of his

handwriting, as-per their request.

It is possible that I did work for the Agency on this man's handwriting under

some cover number or crypt, but up to now,

we have not yet been able to identify it.
