In what way have communist and other subversive
organizations contributed to and influenced protest demonstra=
tions against the war in Vietnam? An obvious device used fre~
quently is to direct their members to become participants and
to influence others to participate in demonstrations organized
by noncommunist organizations.

or in association with otnér™ pacifist organizations and even
with communist front groups, ny--including

on campuses with: the communist-controiled W. E. B. DuBois, Clubs,
of America (DCA), has also received support +t from 1 the CPUSA in-

Yegard to its protest demonstrations against United States

military activity in Vietnam, in fact, Gus Hall has character--:

COMMUNIST PARTY, USA, POLICY ON VIETNAM

End the War

. As early as the Fall of 1961, condemnation of United
States military presence in Vietnam appeared in "The Worker,"
east coast communist newspaper, By the Spring of 1963, CPUSA
national headquarters was issuing instructions for May Day
celebrations which urged Party members to press demands for an
end to the war in Vietnam and to criticize the Administration ,
for its "aggressive" policies in South Vietnam and in Cuba, ~

Condemn "American Imperialism"

At a meeting of the CPUSA National Board held in
September, 1963, CPUSA Public Relations Director Arnold Johnson
claimed that "American imperialism" had perpetuated the division
of Vietnam, He proposed that the Party become more active ina
campaign to urge the withdrawal of American Armed Forces from

. Vietnam and the replacement of the Diem regime with a "democratic

coalition government." Gus Hall instructed that a statement be
issued by the Party to condemn "American imperialism" in Vietnam.

Contact "Peace Forces"

In a subsequent meeting held to discuss Hall's proposed
statement regarding developments in Vietnam, the late Jack Stachel,
a prominent CPUSA functionary, stated that, after: the issuance of
the statement, the Party should contact all the "peace forces" in

New York City in an effort to organize a mass meeting. In addition,

he said the Party should issue a call for everyone to write letters
to Congressmen and Senators demanding an end to the war in Vietnam.

Protest Visit

At a meeting of Party leaders in the Northern California~

District held in October, 1963, District Chairman Mickey Lima”

announced that all Party member's chould be instructed to take

part in a demonstration to protest against the visit of Madame

Ngo Dinh Nhu to San Francisco. Lima added that those participating
in the demonstration should carry placards urging the recall of 7
American troops from Vietnam.

Party Directive
In March of 1964, CPUSA national headquarters sent a

directive, entitled "The U.S. and South Vietnam Developments," to.
all Party districts. This directive reviewed developments in South

"Dirty 4 ssion

Vietnam, assessed their repercussions on the United States, and
described the situation in Southeast Asia as an even greater threat
to peace than Cuba or Berlin. Ali Party districts were urged to

send telegrams to President Johnson protesting American "military
aggression" in South Vietnam, to place advertisements in newspapers
throughout the country, to organize protest meetings and picket lines,
and’ to eniist the support of noncommunist groups in these activities,

| Demands for Withdrawal

: Southeast Asia was the principal topic of discussion at a.
meeting of the Party*s Secretariat held in June, 1964, In the main
report, Jack Stachel proposed, among other things, that the Party
raise the slogan "Bring the Boys Home}" To supplement Stachel's
proposais, the Party called upon veteran member Margrit Pittman to
prepare a discussion outline on the topic “Vietnam and Peace." In
this outline, Pittman urged telegrams, letters, resolutions, meetings,

| marches, and other forms of demonstrations to demand that the United

States withdraw from;South Vietnam and not intervene in Laos or:
Cambodia. = .

"

The CPUSA quickly came to the support of Communist North ©:

Vietnam and characteristically criticized United States foreign. ~>
policy when United States aircraft attacked selected targets in
North Vietnam following torpedo-boat attacks against American
destroyers in the Gulf of Tonkin in early August, 1964, Speaking at
a meeting of the Party's Southern California District, District

_ Chairman Dorothy Healey called this action against North Vietnam
"dirty aggression." She suggested that 50,000 letters be sent to
President Johnson to protest the action against North Vietnam and
to warn the President that he did not have a captive-vote.

"Speak Out for Peace"

As Healey was speaking in California, CPUSA national

headquarters was issuing a press release in New York City in which.

it condemned the "retaliatory strike" against North Vietnam_and
charged that United States warplanes had brought death to innocent
people, The release called for :all people "to speak out for peace!’
through petitions, letters, and telegrams to be sent to President
Johnson, Senators, and Congressmen wrging negotiations and the
settlement of all the issues. through the existing machinery of the

14=power Geneva conference and the "good offices of the United Nations."

NW 64954
Docld:34517444 Page 11


Stimulate Pressure

By letter dated August 19, 1964, and addressed to all
districts, the CPUSA National Organization Department referred to E
this press release, Ail Party members were urged, because of the FE
role of "United States imperialism" in Southeast Asia, to use even «=
greater initiative to stimulate pressure for a negotiated settle-
ment and the convening of a l4-nation conference concerning Vietnam.

Strive for_a Conference

At an enlarged meeting of the CPUSA National Board held~ : |
in November, 1964, Arnold Johnson urged the CPUSA to utilize the ES
many organizations and "groupings" which, he said, were bringing > fei
pressure on the United States Government to end the war in Vietnam...

.. Johnson proposed that the Party strive for a conference in Washington,
D. C., which would represent the totality of American opinion on
Vietnam and would attempt to bring about a change in United States
pdlicy in Vietnam, In this connection, Johnson suggested that the
Paty prepare by the end of November, 1964, a definitive document |

‘‘on Vietnam and distribute 50,000 copies of this document. Such a
document was prepared and sent to all Party districts with instruc-
tions that it be given wide circulation. ‘

Demand for Peace

During a meeting of leading CPUSA functionaries held in i
late November, 1964, Arnold Johnson again stressed the need for the’ gO
Party to fight against extension of the war in Vietnam. He stated / aay
that the CPUSA could do this with the "forces striking for peace." / ‘ L
He suggested that a memorandum on the Party's position be sent to oe . le
all districts, The key point in the memorandum would be the demand
for peace and an end to the war in Vietnam,

"Key Test" nt Tp

Following through on Johnson‘*s suggestions, the CPUSA

National Organization Department sént an avalanche of instructions
to all Party districts for activities designed to achieve communist.) ae
objectives in South Vietnam, CPUSA district leaders were instructed’
to organize activities in the trade-union movement, in youth
organizations, and in religious organizations until peace was EB
* achieved. The Party directive pointed out that at that time of year

church and other organizations raised the question of "Peace on. ;

Earth," but the "key test" was what they said on. Vietnam, , Ih

"Peace on Earth"!

The CPUSA National Organization Department issued another
directive in early December, 1964, in which Party members were urged
to pay special attention to the full use of the "Peace on Earth"

. sentiment of the people during December. Party districts were 5
requested to advise CPUSA national headquarters what was being planned
and what was being done by labor, youth, women, church organizations, |
and ."prozessional peace organizations" in their areas to make the a tt
greatest use of the season when the world was calling for "Peace on
Earth." 3

: E
Appeai to America's Conscience ‘ : |
il

In still another directive issued in December, 1964, the q
National Organization Department warned all Party districts that
every passing event made it more urgent that all sections of the 7
population speak out "to end the war in South Vietnam." Party _
districts were urged to make special efforts for mass activities ~~ . Lk
and expressions of peace during the weekend of December 19-20, This \
Party directive called attention to an enclosed leaflet which urged
the reader to "join in an appeal to the conscience of America to
end the war in.Vietnam," The "appeal" leaflet called for public -
action on December 19, 1964, in the form of leaflet distributions,
vigils, and "poster walks" to protest against actions of the United yee
States Government in South Vietnam. © Abraham J. Muste and other
well-known pacifists were among those sponsoring this leaflet.

: "Aggressive and Barbarous"

5 Herbert Aptheker spoke on February 8, 1965, to a rally of
approximately 1,300 students at the University of California at :
Berkeley held to protest United States policy in Vietnam, Aptheker ,
described an American bombing mission into North Vietnam on c
February 7, 1965, as "aggressive and barbarous." During his remarks,
‘" Aptheker Characterized the Viet Cong as "a national libertarian
movement front" embraced by the people of Vietnam.

Dramatize the Situation s - i

At a meeting of the New York District Board of the CPUSA .- tf
held.on February 8, 1965, the late District Orgmizer Robert Thompson
stated that the situation in Vietnam must be dramatized. In this |
regard, he suggested discussions With civil rights leaders, peace
leaders, and trade-union leaders. His other suggestions included

=~ 4

NW 64954
Docld:34517444 Page 13


promotion of activities by students in city colleges and the sending
of telegrams and delegations to Senators and Congressmen for the
purpose of denouncing the situation in Vietnam. oe

Major Point
In a February 9, 1965, memorandum to all districts from
the National Organization Department, it was stated that the major
point on the agenda for ali the American people was obviously to
bring a halt to the war in South Vietnam, to demand an end to ail
acts of aggression against North Vietnam, to insist that all
* military personnel and forces of the United States be withdrawn
from South Vietnam, and to insure that the Vietnamese be given an
opportunity to determine their own destiny and to exercise their
vight of self-determination. By means of this memorandum, Party
districts were instructed to take immediate steps to cooperate with
all national peace organizations in regard to activities involving
Pee lines, peace walks, student assemblies, delegations “to
Washington, and statements by trade-union leaders.

Brink of Disaster

A CPUSA press release, dated March 2, 1965, contained a:
statement by Gus Hall in which he asserted that the bombing of
North Vietnam by United States "forces of aggression" had brought.
“the world to the brink of disaster. The press release demanded
an end to all bombing, withdrawal of all troops, ending of the
war in Vietnam, reconvening of the Geneva Conference, and activation
of any agencies of the United Nations which could facilitate peace,

Threat of Nuclear War

Also on March 2, 1965, CPUSA national headquarters sent
a letter to all districts stating that it was obvious that the
major crisis facing the American people was the threat of a world
nuclear war.arising from the escalation of the unjust war in Vietnam,
The letter urged that every step be taken quickly to express OR ee
form of protest: against this threatened world war.

"Atrocious War"

In a memorandum to all districts dated March 31, 1965, the
CPUSA National Organization Department referred to the "atrocious
war" in Vietnam and urged protest actions. In this regard, it was
stated that April 17,.1965, was becoming the major point of concen-
tration for youth, for adults in peace organizations, and for the Left,

-5-

NW 64954
Docld:34517444 Page 14


including communists,: The Party directive also described the
planned April 17, 1965, Student March on Washington to end the ©
war in Vietnam as the "biggest single action calling for an end
to the war in Vietnam,"

Testing Ground

On March 30, 1965, Herbert Aptheker spoke to some 200
persons in New York City and attacked United States policy in
Vietnam, He stated that this country was using Vietnam as a
testing ground for new weapons, was exploiting the people and
resources of Vietnam, and was continuing the war for its
imperialist designs, He urged those in his audience to write /
letters to their Senators and to President Johnson for the purpose
of showing their indignation over United States policy and asking
for the withdrawal of United States troops from Vietnam, .Aptheker
said he would participate in the April 17, 1965, March on Washington
and he urged young people in his audience to do likewise.

Leading Role Claimed —

. At a CPUSA National Committee meeting held in late April,
1965, Gus Hall charged that the United States was guilty of
“imperialist aggression" and that its activities in Vietnam could
be compared with fascism in Nazi Germany. Hall contended that the
United States had been able to escalate the war because the Sino-
Soviet dispute had prevented the "socialist countries" from
presenting a united front. In concluding his report, Hall claimed
that CPUSA officials and members had taken part in the leadership,
planning, and initiation of recent mass actions to protest the.
war in Vietnam,

Need for More Militant Activities”

Among those participating in the discussion of Hall's
report was James Tormey,.a leading member of the Party's New York
District. Tormey stated that there was a need for more militant
and demonstrative activities and an intensification of the fight
against United States "imperialism" in Vietnam, a7?

Top Priority Project

Gus Hall told the CPUSA Secretariat on April 28, 1965, that
the "peace struggle" was-one of the main projects for the Party.
and would be pushed on.a full-time basis, He instructed Party

leaders to nave the CPUSA work with ail kinds of people in demon-
strative actions and in putting pressure on the administration,
Senators, Congressmen, and other Government officials. The idea
of pressure, Hall added, must be maintained in every possible way,
including the use of advertisements, Hall also stated that this
had to remain a major and top priority project for the CPUSA and i
suggested that Arnold Johnson work full time on it. I

Escalation of Protest Movements

Hall claimed, in a speech made at Los Angeles on May 2,
1965, that the most significant recent development was the
escalation of mass protest movements by the American people, in
a period of a month, he noted, there were two historic mass
mobilizations=<-one in Alabama and one in Washington, D.C, The
most popular slogan in the Alabama mobilization, Hall maintained,
was "Bring the troops back from Vietnam and send them to Alabama."
Thus, Hall concluded,. civil rights leaders were also becoming
pease Leaders and peace leaders were becoming civil rights leaders

Cumulative Effect '

At an appearance at Oberlin College on May 12, 1965,
Herbert Aptheker again criticized United States foreign policy.
He described American policy in Vietnam as illegal, immoral,
militarily untenable, and diplomatically disastrous. Urging a
united front against the war in Vietnam, Aptheker supported an
appeal in "The New York Times," signed by 800 college professors, a
which called for a "cease fire," negotiations With the Viet Cong, i
an end to air raids, the use of the good offices of the United
Nations, and assurances to the world that America would not use
nuclear weapons in pursuit of victory or peace. Addressing himself
to protest demonstrations, Aptheker contended that they were having i
a cumulative effect. | rt

Number One Priority : if

By memorandum dated July 8, 1965, the Communist Party's
New York District called attention of all.clubs to the need-for—-—--.—_{
peace activities. It was stated in this memorandum that the |
further escalation of the war in Vietnam and the continuing inter- |
vention o¢ United States military forces in: the Dominican Republic I

Peace: Stop the Bombing! No More U. S. Troops

No Relaxation =

The Party's New York District issued another memorandum
on duly 26, 1965, calling attention to the fact that the CPUSA
nad undertaken and had been involved in many actions, protests,
and educational forums around the burning question of war and
peace, The memovandum went on to say that no relaxation or
Slowing down of activities could be allowed. On the contrary,
activities must be multiplied and must involve more people in
the communitia&.

Be More Active

On August 14, 1965, young Party members of Seattle
and Portland met in Portland, Oregon. The main speaker was
Bettina Aptheker. She stated that Party youth must be more
aétive and must not be afraid to take open action. She said
that she had been at the scene earlier in the month when troop
trains had almost been stopped at Oakland, California. According
to Aptheker, young communists from the San Francisco area had a
part in organizing the efforts to halt troop trains in California.

“Slogans Approved

4& feature of the CPUSA national youth cadre conference
held near Monterey, Indiana, in mid-September, 1965, was a three-
hour lecture by Gus Hall. Predictably, a major portion of Hall's
lecture was devoted to the war in Vietnam, He instructed that
the CPUSA must use slogans in an effort to force the United
States to retreat in Vietnam, Hall then cited with approval the
following slogans, which he attributed to the Mor

Negotiations Based on the Geneva Agreement!

Slogans Supplied

In a letter to all districts dated September 10, 1965,
the CPUSA national office advised that the following slogans.
should be used to strengthen the campaign to end the war in
Vietnam and for greater unity of all "peace" forces: “End, the

With All Energy

At a September, 1965, meeting of a press club of the
Party's New York District, the late Jack Stachel told the
communist editors present that they must continue with all
their energy to expose American imperialist policies in Vietnam
and elsewhere, Stachel urged them to support the demands of
the Women_Strike for Peace, which, he said, included a
cessation of bombing to create an atmosphere for negotiations;
implementation of the 1954 Geneva decisions; and negotiation,
with all concerned, particularly with the National Liberation
Front (Viet Cong), :

War Hysteria

Gus Hall held a press conference in October, 1965,
and stated that the time had come when all nations must have
the right to determine their own affairs. Therefore, he 2
said, the United States had no right--moral or legal--to be
in Vietnam. He condemned efforts of the United States to
“whip up" an atmosphere of war hysteria against the peace
movement. The United States policy of "imperialism and
eggression," Hall added, was the basis for this Nation's
problems.

Washington Weekend

In the Fall of 1965, the National Coordinating
Committee to End the ietnam issued a call for a four-
day National Antiwar Convention to be held in Washington, D. C.,
during the period from November 25 through November 28, 1965.
In addition, the Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy. (SANE)
issued a call for 2 one-day “march to be Hera) a the same ev eity
on November 27, 1965.

Plan To Influence

The subject of ‘the antiwar convention was introduced
by Arnold Johnson at a meeting of leading CPUSA functionaries~..
held in New York City on October 23, 1965.. He said the Party
should make plans in advance to influence the coavention and
expressed the hope that the convention would form a loose,

Major Peace Events

In a November 12, 1965, letter to all districts, CPUSA

: national headquarters described the march and the convention to

4 be held in Washington as two major peace events calling "for
urgent and constant attention." Party headquarters requested
information on what was being done to support these events by L
sending delegates and participants, In a reference to the bp
march, the directive stated that all areas could afford to raise E
their sights and goais to make this a major peace demonstration, f
because the "Johnson Administration is bringing every pressure.

. and using every device to suppress the protest," Concerning
the convention, CPUSA headquarters asserted thatthis could be a
major event to establish coordination among "varied peace
organizations" and that it deserved cooperation,

Points for Peace

In a document dated November 17, 1965, addressed to all
districts and captioned "Memo on End Vietnam War Action," CPUSA
headquarters referred to its November 12 directive and reiterated
that both events scheduled for Washington called for the most
urgent and maximum attention as the "major points for peace
mobilization," This communication informed the membership that.
several communist "spokesmen" would be at the convention and
would have available relevant material.

At this meeting, it was announced that members of this organ=

Eastern Pennsylvania and Delaware District ordered that as many
CPUSA members as possible should participate in the march. On
November 16, a functionary in the Party's New York District :

"Unjust War"

Gus Hall made several statements about the war in

Vietnam during a news conference he held in Chicago on December 6,
1965, The most critical question before the world today, he
said, is the unpopular, "criminal" action of the United States

in Vietnam. The position of the CPUSA, he pointed out, is that
this is an "unjust war," Hall also declared that the CPUSA has
been active in demonstrations urging that the war be ended :
quickly through negotiations with the National Liberation Front, :
the only legitimate government of South Vietnam, a
Expanding and Unifying

Vietnam was mentioned prominently in a report made by

Hall at an enlarged meeting of the CPUSA National Committee

held in January, 1966. He claimed that the peace movement was
“expanding and unifying. Hall told his audience that the CPUSA
had been participating openly in the peace movement and that the .»
Party's participation changed the character of the peace movement.
by helping it to develop a more "anti-imperialist consciusness." :
Looking ahead, Hall instructed that the Party must try“to broaden
the base of the peace movement, specifically in regard to trade
unions and veterans' groups. He also ordered that every CPUSA
member must be active in some aspect of the fight for peace,

"Any and All" Slogans

At the National Committee meeting held in January, 1966,
Herbert Aptheker reported on a trip he had made to North Vietnam
in late December, 1965, Aptheker announced that he had met with
leaders of the Communist Party of North Vietnam who told him
that they were "deliriously happy" that the CPUSA had finally
,established contact with them, because they want "close fraternal
ties" with the CPUSA. .Aptheker also reported that the North ;

Vietnamese communist leaders urged that “any and all" slogans;
be used in antiwar demonstrations, if this would result in Ma
inereased protest activity -in the United States.

"Rock the Nation"

Robert Heisler, who was elected to the CPUSA National
Committee in June, 1966, delivered a report to a joint meeting
of all CPUSA youth clubs in New York City in April, 1966, In
his report, he stated that the peace movement had already begun ~
to "vock the Nation." Ke described:it as a movement which had
shifted its center of gravity leftward and as a movement whose
full weight of criticism and confrontation was directed against
Washington in a challenge to American foreign policy in Vietnam.

Historic Date
Heisler recalled, in his report, that the first mass

action:to protest the war in Vietnam occurred on April 17, 1965=-=
the March on Washington initiated by the Students for a Democratic

called this date historic because’ it brought about a major

‘preakthrough-~the policy of "non-exclusion" of communists in
. activities for peace. Also in regard to peace demonstrations,

Heisler praised the Na’ nal Coordinatin At
War in Vietnam and described it as an “organization whose main-
forces were “lefteoriented," ’

~ Central issue

In the Spring of 1966, Dorothy Healey, Chairman of the
CPUSA's Southern California District, announced that she would
be a candidate in the June 7, 1966, primary for the office of
Tax Assessor for Los Angeles County. In a campaign speech given
at a May Day Rally held in Compton, California, Healey stated
that the war in Vietnam would be the central issue in her
campaign. The American people who rejected Barry Goldwater's
"itehy finger on the atomic trigger" in 1964, Healey declared,
are called upon in 1966 to end Lyndon Johnson's war in Vietnam.
A President who betrayed his mandate and a Congress which
surrendered its congressional authority, Healey added, must be
compelled to end this.dishonorable war and "bring our troops
home." Healey also stated that the problems stemming from the;
need for education, housing, and-welfare in Los Angeles County.
will remain unsolved as long as the war in Vietnam continues.

Keynote Speech

The 18th National Convention of the CPUSA opened on
dune 22, 1966, with Gus Hall's keynote address delivered before
representatives of the press. The Party's campaign against
United States participation in the war in Vietnam was featured
in his address. He stated that the United States is engaged in
cold-blooded imperialist aggression and compared its actions in

: Vietnam to the savagery of Hitler's Germany. The CPUSA, Hall
contended, has contributed much to the movement for peace and
has involved each of its members in some phase of the struggle
for peace.

Peace Panel

At the convention, a report of the peace panel was /
adopted by acclamation. The peace payel recommended a strong ‘
and effective trade-union committee for peace; a merger of the
peace movement with other mass struggles; and a significant. 2... — -—~j;)
increase in mass participation throughout the United States in E
parades, picket lines, and other demonstrations in behalf of ~
peace. The peace panel also urged participation in demonstrations
on August 6 through August 9, 1966, to mark the bombing of
Hiroshima, This panel also declared that peace in Vietnam should.

‘be the central issue in the November elections.

Grass-Roots Crusade

The CPUSA held a two-week national “youth educational
encampment" at Camp Webatuck, Wingdale, New York, during the °
period from August 29 through September 11, 1966. A portion of.. a
the final day of the encampment was set aside for a lecture by ree
National Chairman Henry Winston, He told his listeners that it
was imperative that the CPUSA organize a nationwide grass-roots .

- erusade for peace in Vietnam, Winston claimed that labor and . F
minority groups are the key to the development of opposition to
the war in Vietnam, Solid opposition to this war, Winston
added, must be developed by the Party during the coming. political

- Campaigns.

Director Michael Zagarell described the war in Vietnam as the
exucial issue facing the CPUSA, Zagarell, told the young Party
leaders that the war in Vietnam is responsible for inflation,
for the drafting of students, for a curtailment of funds for i
education, for a cutback in the war on poverty, and for worsen-
ing conditions in the Negro community. The CPUSA, Zagarell

is stressed, believes that it is possible to end the war in Vietnam
through the election of Congressmen who oppose the war. He then *
urged support for independent candidates, support for cutspoken
antiwar candidates of the two major political parties, and :
promotion of "peace ballots" if all the candidates are prowar,

Student Strike

Among a number of goals for Party youth proposed by
Zagarell at this youth conference was the organizing of a CPUSA~
initiated national student strike. The conference also heard a
special report from Bettina Aptheker, who originated the proposal
for a national student strike, She announced that a’ planning
meeting for the strike will be held in Chicago during the
Christmas, 1966, recess, International support will be obtained
so that simultaneous strikes will occur in several countries.
Aptheker stated that the purpose of the strike will be to protest
the draft, weapons research on college campuses, and the effects ~
of the war in Vietnam on domestic affairs. The numerical goal,
according to Aptheker, is a student strike with half a million
participants in the United States. : i

_meeting in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, sponsored by the CPUSA. |
In his speech, Winston stated that the CPUSA advocates withdrawal 4
of all American troops in order to bring about an end to the war i
in Vietnam, Until the troops are withdrawn, Winston. contended,

can be devoted to the problems existing in the United States,
particularly those of the Negroes,

De-Escalation Advocated

CPUSA Vice Chairman Claude Lightfoot held a press
conference in Chicago on October 14, 1966, in which he described
himself as a write-in candidate for United States Senator from
Illinois. Lightfoot stated that his program consists of
immediate de-escalation of the war in Vietnam in order to provide
funds necessary to finance a crash program of in-plant and
apprenticeship training for Negro youth with adequate living
costs to be provided during the training and a Government=-backed
program for securing guaranteed jobs at prevailing union scales
on completion of training.

DUBOIS CLUBS POLICY ON VIETNAM

As a communist-controlled group, the W. E. B. DuBois’
Clubs of America (DCA) follows the CPUSA line on Vietnam, just

as it has paralleled other communist policy since it was
founded in June, 1964, on the orders of CPUSA General
Secretary Gus Hall.

Vietnam Resolution

A Midwest Regional Conference of the DCA was held
in late February, 1965, at the Student Memorial Union,
located on the campus of the University of Wisconsin. The
Conference adopted a resolution on Vietnam calling for the
withdrawal cf United States troops, cessation of all aid to
the Government of South Vietnam, and condemnation of
United States "aggression" and "brutality" in Vietnam. The

Conference also instructed each DCA unit in the Midwest Region ©

to establish an educational committee on, Vietnam.

"Stepped-Up" Campaign

In March, 1965, the DCA National Office sent to all
its branches an "Emergency Memo on Viet Nam Crisis." In this”
memorandum, the opinion was expressed that it was possible to
mobilize massive support for a movement to bring peace to
Vietnam. It was further stated that the DCA was circulating
in colieges and universities a petition of refusal to serve
in the Armed Forces against the people of Vietnam, In
conclusion, the DCA memorandum called upon all chapters,
members, and friends of the DCA to join with all groups and
individuals: ia.a “stepped-up" campaign to end the war in
Vietnam.

. Coordinators Conference

of the DCA was held in Chicago during May, 1965... At this_
conference, it was concluded that BCA efforts throughout the
Summer of 1965 must be directed toward building mass pressure

A national conference of area coordinators and "friends"

and protest against the policy of the United States on Vietnam.

The conference also passed a motion that it is the position of ©.::*

the DCA that the National Liberation Front is the only ‘true
vepresentative of the people. of South Vietnanm.:

Ead "Aggression"

The National Coordinating Committee, which is the
policy making pody of the DCA, adopted a resolution in dune, 1965,
calling for an end of United States “aggression” in :
South Vietnam; an immediate end of United States bombings in
North Vietnam; the immediate withdrawal af United States troops
from Vietnam; and the recognition of the National Liberation
Front as the only true representative of the South Vietnanese _

people.

Main Objective

Bettina Aptheker spoke to a group of young CPUSA
members from Seattle and’Portland, Oregon, on August 14,.1965.
At this meeting, she stated that the main objective of the
pcA was to work on the issue of peace and to force the
United States out of Vietnam. Some three weeks later,
Suga Sterling Fowler IZ was elected as DCA Chairman at a
national conference held in Chicago. Fowler had been Chairman
of the DCA Peace Committee in Berkeley, California, and had,
been active in the Spring of 1965 organizing demonstrations
against United States foreign policy concerning Vietnam.

Committee Decisions

The DCA National Coordinating Committee met again
¥rom November 30 through December 2, 1965, at Philadelphia, —--
Pennsylvania. At this meeting, it was decided that the DCA
would work closely with the National Coordinating Committee 3
to Ead the War in Vietnam. It was also decided that the DCA, Be
either alone or jointly with other groups, would sponsor a
march on Washington in August, 1966, to end the war in Vietnam.
Following this meeting, Fowler held a press conference, at a
which time he was wearing in his lapels the official pin of
the DCA and the pin of the Vietnam National Liberation Front. |

How Much Longer?

An article by Fowler, who has attended CPUSA national

cadre training schools, appeared in the January-February, 1966,
_issue of “insurgent,” a pimonthly DCA magazine. Fowler alleged
in this article that the United States is murdering hundreds .of
thousands of women and children in Vietnam and that the "power

/ Om”:

structure" wants the war to continue because it is profiting
financially from the war, Fowler asked how much longer the
President and "his cohorts" would be allowed to kill, main,
and destroy American and Vietnamese people. x

Public Not Xept Informed

Herbert Aptheker was one of the featured speakers
‘at the second National Convention of the DCA held in Chicago

from June 17 through June 19, 1966. in his remarks, Aptheker
claimed that the administration is not keeping the public
informed about tke situation in Vietnam. He advocated removal
of all United States troops from Vietnam, diversion of all
funds being spent on the war in Vietnam to the war on poverty,
and United States participation in a peace conference in
Geneva. :

"Militant Forms"

The DCA National. Executive Committee, which governs
the day~to-day activities of the orgahization, issued a leaflet
on June 30, 1966, which stated in part: "In every area the
DuBois Clubs must help initiate a balanced program aimed at
a variety of peopie and utilizing a variety of forms of
epposition to the bombing and to the war," The leaflet called
for demonstrations and mass distribution of leaflets as the
first part of an intensified campaign to end the bombing and
the war and stated further that "militant forms" of protest
Should not be excluded or discouraged.

"LB3's Useless War"

In late July, 1966, the DCA was distributing a é
leaflet which protested "LBJ'’s useless war" in Vietnam. The
leaflet alleged that the war in Vietnam is a racist war being
waged by black soldiers against colored people. The leaflet.’
also contained a charge that those in Washington who are
directing the war and ordering bombings in Vietnam are
criminals. :

SOCIALIST WORKERS PARTY POLICY ON VIETNAM

fhe Socialist Workers Party (SWP) was formed in
1938 and is a militantly revolutionary party based upon the ‘
theories of Marx, Engels, and Lenin as interpreted by the. late
Leon Trotsky, Its national membership is estimated at less
than 500. Gi

Withdraw Troops

In the elections of 1964, the SWP ran Clifton DeBerry
and Edward Shaw for President and Vice President of the
United States. Shaw is the SWP National Organizational
Secretary, DeBerry is the son-in-law of SWP National Secretary
Farrell Dobbs. In its political campaign, the SWP advocated,
_among other things, withdrawal of United States troops from:
South Vietnam. DeBerry received a little over 33,000 votes...

“Contact Work" 7
Members of the SWP and its youth affiliate, the

Young Socialist Alliance (YSA), attended a closed membership

meeting of the New York SWP Local on April 8, 1965. At this

meeting, both SWP and YSA members were urged to participate

in the April 17, 1965, March on Washington to end the war in

Vietnam sponsored by the Students for a Democratic Society. —

it was stated that the main purpo: of t r participating

was "to make YSA and SWP intervention, to do contact work, ~

and to sell copies of 'The Militant'’"(SWP newspaper) “and the

‘young Socialist'" (YSA publication). At this meeting, it was

stressed that SWP members participating in the march should.

concentrate on selling these publications so that YSA nenbers | a

would be free to do "contact work" among the students.

- Detroit Committee

By memorandum dated March 16, 1966, Jan Garrett,
Detroit SWP Organizer, detailed for sw> members only a two-page
tnam.
Garrett stated in this memorandum that the YSA h had originally
proposed the creation of a united front committee to support
the April 17, 1965, March on Washington. As a result of this
proposal, Detroit members of the YSA, "a couple of SDS members,"
and a "eouple of Stalinists," formed the Detxoit_Comn: ttee to.
End the War in Vietnam.

Press Campaign
The following is a sampling of headlines which
appeared during 1965 in "The Misitant," the SWP newspaper: i
wyonnson Presses Vietnam War in Defiance of World Opinion";
"gohnson’s Bombings Keep World at Brank ‘in Vietnam"; “Johnson's
Trigger—Happy Aggression Brings U. S. to New Brink in Vietnam";
and “Why Are the People Denied a Voice on Crucial Issue of _ \
War in Vietnam? Should One Man Endanger Lives of All Mankind?" . H
The SWP also uses "The Militant" to try to exploit antiwar
sentiment by promoting the slogan, "Bring the Troops Home Now."
Copies of "The Militant" have been handed out freely during <_-
Vietnam demonstrations.

Principal Task

SWP National Committee member Joseph Hansen, who had |
peen on foreign assignment for the SWP as an "observer" of :
developments in the international Trotskyist movement, made a
report at the 2ist National Convention of the swP held in
September, 1965. Hansen maintained that, if the Soviet Union
was really a revolutionary country, it could have made the bi
United States think twice about increasing its support to
South Vietnam. Hansen also asserted that little revolutionary
Cuba took the correct revolutionary position when Fidel Castro t
called on all "socialists" to pury their differences and support ‘
the "Vietnam freedom fighters." At this same National Convention,
| Dobbs stated that the principal task of the SWP in the year
| ahead was to give full support to the "antiwar movement" led
by the youth. Dobbs also said that the SWP would continue to
support existing antiwar groups and would organize others where
none existed. ae

Very Fortunate

Farrell Dobbs spoke at a closed membership meeting
of the Detroit Local of the SWP which was held on October 10, 1965.
| The SWP was very fortunate, Dobbs said, to have a situation such
i as Vietnam, because the members could take full advantage of it
| to introduce the SWP line. Dobbs added that the importance
| peing placed by the SWP national office on the demand for
| immediate withdrawal of United States troops from Vietnam was
i evidenced by the steps that had been taken in regard-to the
| four-day National Antiwar Convention to be held in Washington L.

national headquarters of the National Coordinating, Committee
to End the War ‘Vietnam.

YSA Newsletter not

At the National Antiwar Convention held in Washington
in November, 1965, the YSA tried to promote the SWP line that
the antiwar movement should be based on the single issue of
immediate withdrawal of United States troops from Vietnam
rather than multi-issues, including: promotion of negotiations.
When the YSA position was defeated at the convention, YSA
members and other militants disassociated themselves from the
dominart position of the National Coordinating Committee to.

. Since that time, the YSA has printed
“dist ed nationally the "Bring the Troops
Home Now Newsletter." At the present time, the YSA regards
Vietnam demonstrations as forums to sell its literature,. make
contacts, and recruit members.

Primary Area _ of Work

By letter dated February 10, 1966, Edward Shaw set
out policy on behalf of the SWP Secretariat. In this letter,
Shaw stated that the antiwar movement--opposition to
United States presence in Vietnam--is the primary area of work
at! the present time. ~

PROGRESSIVE LABOR PARTY POLICY ON VIE!

. Of the militant Marxist-Leninist organizations in
the United States whose policies closely adhere to those of
Communist China, probably the most important is the
Progressive Labor Party. Progressive Labor groups were
formed as early as January, 1962, by dissident elements of
the CPUSA, led by Milton Rosen and Mortimer Scheer, both of
whom held positions in the New York District: of the CPUSA
pefore they were expelled for factionalism in December, 1961...

o At an initial national convention, held in New York City in

q April, 1965, Progressive Labor Party (PLP) was the name

: selected by the members of the Progressive Labor ovement. .

fi Headquarters of the PLP is in New York City. In

_ Zact, most of the members of the PLP are located in New York State
i and in California. Estimates of total PLP membership vary from

} 160 to 500, Principal PLP publications are "progressive Labor,"
"Challenge," and "Spark."

Special Edition

The February 9, 1965, issue of "Challenge" was 2
special four-page edition containing a Progressive Labor Move-
ment statement on Vietnam, This issue had a press run of °

baie 60,000 copies. The statement blamed the Vietnam war on
Hi 3 "president Johnson's government," said the war was an excuse
a to send poor Negroes and. Puerto Ricans out of the United States
to be killed, and called for demonstrations by people and
organizations in the United States to show that they would’ not
support "President Johnson's war."

Immediate Withdrawal

i ‘During the PLP's four-day convention in April, 1965, a
i c resolution which would have called for the impeachment of
President Johnson was defeated. However, a press release issued
after the convention stated that one of the resolutions adopted
condemned "United States aggression in Southeast Asia." It

also called upon all workers, students, intellectuals, and others
kia » to demand immediate withdrawal of all United States Army

i . personnel from South Vietnam. In addition, the resolution urged
all United States citizens to protest the bombing of North ™
and South Vietnam.

-Government Guilty"; "Gis in Vietnam Say: "Get the Hell Out"; 7

"Documented U, S. Atrocities in Vietnam"; "LBJ Lie Machine,"
Peace Efforts Termed "Phony"

ia an article by PLP President Milton Rosen in the
February 15, 1966, issue of "Challenge," he referred to efforts
py the United States to achieve peace in Vietnam and stated)
that the attempt of President Johnson to blackmail the Vietnamese
people into abandoning their fight for freedom had collapsed.
Further, he said that President Johmson's "peace offensive" was
"ohony" and the resumption of the boring of North Vietnam
underlined the deceit of the rulers in Washington. Rosen also
stated that thé Vietnamese were winning the war and that
opposition to United States action in Vietnam was developing
in this country.

Selected Statements

From time to time, PLP leaders have made oral state-—
ments critical of United States participation in the war in
- Vietnam, For example, William Epton, PLP Vice President and
Chairman of the PLP's Harlem Branch, has been quoted as saying
that he strongly opposes the war in Vietnam and has urged his ~
prothers and sisters not to fight against the people in Vietnam,
pecause the fight for freedom and liberation is right here ‘in a
. this country, At a May 21, 1965, anti-Vietnam demonstration 7
at the University of California at Berkeley, PLP National <
Student Organizer Levi Laub claimed that United States policy
-in Vietnam is based on the need for expanding markets and
* foreign investments. On January 20, 1966, PLP Organizational
Secretary Edward Lemansky spoke at the campus of the University
of Washington at Seattle. In an attack on United States policy
: on Vietnam, he stated, "We must destroy this Government and- :

to plan and execute a demonstration in New York City on

May 2, 1964, demanding withdrawal of United States troops
from Victnam. "Free Student," a publication of the M2M,
contained an article in its third issue in which it was
stated that the M2M was formed to fight against a politics
of default by organizing student protest and revolt against
the United States Government's "savage war" on the people of
Vietnam,

Vigorous Opposition

At the apex of its existence, the M2M vigorously
opposed the war in Vietnam, joined in a number of campus
protests, and sought to stir up student grievances. During
the 1965-1966 academic year, M2M endeavored to (1) form an

alliance between students and workers, (2) conduct an antin
Armed Forces induction campaign, and“(3) send medical and
material aid to the National Liberation Front in South Vietnam.

"Get Out of Vietnam Now"

The PLP held a "student conference" in New York City
in early September, 1966. It was decided at this conference‘
that a vital task for the coming period will be the
destruction of the barriers that separate workers and students
and isolate the student-based antiwar movement, In addition,
it was decided that, on the campuses, priority must be given
to building a "Get Out of Vietnam Now" movement, because the: .
issues of Vietnam and the draft can "unite the student,
workers, and black movements" and bring "students into direct —=
confrontation with the university administration”and sometimes
with the government." ;

Student-Worker Alliance

In a report explaining the decisions made at this
conference, it was stated that students are being transformed
from "intellectuals" into cannon fodder for Vietnam and are
following in the footsteps of black and white working youth. -
This, therefore, should be the approach to antiwar activity
on the campuses. At the same time, it was said, there is a
need for working-class action against the war in Vietnam,
because the development of a student-worker alliance is crucial
to a strong movement: against."imperialist aggression” in
Vietnam. i

RS WORLD PARTY SOLICY ON VI

The Workers World. Party (WWP) is a small but very
militant pro-Peking organizatien. It was fermed ia 1959 by
a group of former SWP members headed by Sam Ballan. Its
headquarters and many of its fewer than 100 members are in:
New York City. Its youth affiliate, Youth Against War and

‘Fascism (YAWF), was formed in the summer of 1062 to ‘pring
college and high school students into the periphery of WWP
activities, The publication of the WWP is “Workers World"
and that of the YAWF is "The Partisan."

Press Camp: a

Issues of the "Workers World" since the Gulf of
Tonkin incident in August, 1964, have contained articles
critical of United States policy in Vietnam. The following
are typical headlines: "Sneak Attack"; "Stop the War Against
Viet Nam"; "Johnson Plots Sneak Attack on Chinai"; "More GI's
Die As LBJ Steps Up War; Bring Them Home Now!"; "U. S, Pushing
For A Wider War In Asia; Now Seeks To Provoke China"; and
"L.B.J., Like Hitler, Uses Poison Gas; Wages Racist War
Against Viet Nam."

Liberation Front Supported

The September 16, 1965, issue of "Workers World"
reported that WWP Chairman Sam Ballan set the tone for a
Labor Day weekend conference by praising WWP cadres for their
outstanding work and reaffirming WWP support for the "forgotten
fighters of the National Liberation Front of South Viet Nam."
It was also reported that Ballan said, "The statement of the ||
Defense Minister of People's China calling for the isolation | ~
and defeat of U. S. imperialism has our enthusiastic and
unqualified support."

At Every Opportunity

The March, 1966, issue of "The Partisan" contained
an article entitled "Why and How to Organize Rapid Demonstrae |
tions.". It was stated in this article that the United States

“ORS

war "against Asia" will be a prolonged one. Therefore, the
members of the antiwar movement must realize that the struggle
against the war must be an extended one, It was further
stated that it would not be possible to organize the masses
into large antiwar demonstrations if they caanot first be
mnobihiaca ante Limited struggles against the war in Vietnam.
The article concluded with the statement that flexibility .
was. needed in order to direct antiwar consciousness into
action at avery opportunity.

Demonstrations in New York City

Between May 21 and July 30, 1966, the YAWF sponsored’
ten anti-Vietnam demonstrations in New York City. ‘Two of,
these demonstrations consisted of picket lines near the
Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. On one occasion, President: Johnson
was scheduled to attend a function at this hotel. ‘On the
other occasion, Vice President ‘Humphrey was to be at the
