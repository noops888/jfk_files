1964.

in Vietnam:

of these demonstrations could be said to have reached major

proportions.

Even before the Gulf of Tonkin incident, the

Communist Party, USA (CPUSA) -which took its cue from the

Soviet Union--and other subversive organizations in the

United States were engaged in campaigns to influence the

United states Government to withdraw its troops

from

Vietnam or to participate

in negotiations to end the

war

They hoped, of course,

that either action would result

ultimately in a communist victory in Vietnam.

At the same time, these subversive organizations

wanted to take full advantage of the clamor for peace in

Vietnam created by in

y individuals

organizations

that are for peace and against war no matter what the

consequences may be.

While these pacifists, like other

Americans, have every right to protest any action of their

Government with which they disagree, the communists and

Of paramount importance, there was the opportunity

to foster an impression that

noncommunist opposition--exists in this country relative

This would serve

lend encouragement to the North Vietnamese and the Viet Cong

to continue the fighting despite adversities and might lead

to domestic discontent similar to that which contributed

to the earlier French military disengagement from events in

Indochina.

For the communists, it

Even beyond their immediate goal, the communists

by these individuals lends some credibility to a statement made

by CPUSA General Secretary Gus Hall.

In October, 1966, he

stated that there are 100,000 to 150, 000 people in the united

States who could be considered communists, but economic and

In what way have communist and other subversive

organizations contributed to and influenced protest demonstra-

tions against the war in Vietnam?

An obvious device used fre

quently is to direct their members to become participants and

to influence others to participate in demonstrations organized

by noncommunist organizations.

Several pacifist groups,

acting either independently

or in association with other pacifist organizations and even

with communist front groups, have sponsored

many--including

mose of the major--demonstrations against the war in vietnam.

Prominent among these pacifist organizations are the

including Trade Unionists for Peace, which was established

by the New York District of the CPUSA.

In addition, representatives of communist and other

A recently formed ad hoc committee-- the November 8th

Mobilization Committee-has as its chairman the durable Abraham

J. Muste.

• This Committee was established for the purpose of

planning a mass mobilization for peace during the four days in

November immediately preceding the 1966 elections. The proposal

for this Committee was made by Professor Sidney Peck of Western

in Cleveland, initiated and

hosted by the Inter-University Committee for a Public Hearing on

Vietnam, which works closely with the leadership of Students for

a Democratic Society. Peck was a member of the l

Franklin Alexander, Chairman of the DCA and a CPUSA member;

Carl Oglesby, former National President of the SDS; and Yale

Professor

Staughton Lynd, who accompanied Aptheker on a trip

to North Vietnam in

and who was a member of

the now-defunct American Youth for

Democracy, a communist youth

front.

It is typical of these ad hoc committees to include in

the list of sponsors individuals like Aptheker, Lynd, and Muste,

who have been prominent in many antiwar demonstrations, and names

that might attract attention, such as that of Norman Thomas,

perennial Socialist Party candidate for President of the United

States.

COMMUNIST PARTY, USA, POLICY ON VIETNAM

End the Nar

As early as the Fall of 1961, condemnation of United

States military presence in Vietnam appeared in "The Worker,

east coast communist newspaper.

By the Spring of 1963, CPUSA

national headquarters was issuing instructions for May

• Day

celebrations which urged Party members to press demands for an

end to the war in Vietnam and to criticize the Administration

for its "aggressive" policies in South Vietnam and in Cuba.

Condemn "American Imperialism"

At a meeting of the CPUSA National Board held in

September, 1963, CPUSA Public Relations Director Arnold Johnson

claimed that "American imperialism" had perpetuated the division

of Vietnam. He proposed that the Party become more active in

campaign to urge the withdrawal of American Armed Forces from

Vietnam and the replacement of the Diem regime with a "democratic

coalition government." Gus Hall instructed that a statement be

issued by the Party to condemn "American imperialism" in Vietnam.

Contact "Peace Forces"

In a subsequent meeting held to discuss Hall's proposed

statement regarding developments in Vietnam, the late Jack Stachel,

a prominent CPUSA functionary, stated that, after the issuance of

the statement, the Party should contact all the 'peace forces" in

New York City

in an effort to organize a mass meeting. In addition,

he said the Party should issue a call for everyone to write letters

to Congressmen and Senators demanding an end to the war in

Vietnam.

Protest Visit

At a meeting of Party leaders in the Northern California

District held in October, 1963, District Chairman Mickey Lima

announced that all Party

members should be instructed to take

part in a demonstration to protest against the visit of Madame

Ngo Dinh Nhu to San Francisco.

in the demonstration should carry placards urging the recall of

American troops from Vietnam.

Party Directive

In March of 1964, CPUSA national headquarters sent

directive, entitled "The U's. and South Vietnam Dovelopments, to

all Party districts. This directive reviewed developments in south

Vietnam,

assessed their repercussions on the United States, and

described the situation in Southeast Asia as an even greater threat

to peace than Cuba or Berlin.

All Party districts were urged to

send telegrams to President Johnson protesting American "military

aggression" in South Vietnam,

to place advertisements in newspapers,

throughout the country, to organize protest meetings and picket lines.

and to enlist the support of noncommunist groups in these activities.

Demands for Withdrawal

Southeast Asia was the principal topic of discussion at a

meeting of the Party's Secretariat held in June, 1964. In the main

report, Jack stachel proposed, among other things, that the Party

raise the slogan "Bring the Boys Home?"

proposals, the Party called upon veteran member Margrit Pittman to

discussion outline on the topic "Vietnam and Peace."

this outline, Pittman urged telegrams, letters, resolutions, meetings,

and other forms of demonstrations to demand that the United

States withdraw isom South Vietnam and not intervene in Laos or:

"Dirty Aggression"

The CPUSA quickly came to the support of Communist North

Vietnam and characteristically criticized United States foreign

policy when United States aircraft attacked selected targets in

North Vietnam following torpedo-boat attacks against American

destroyers in the Gulf of Tonkin in early August, 1964.

Speaking at

a meeting of the Party's Southern California District, District

Chairman Dorothy Healey called this action against North Vietnam

"dirty aggression."

She suggested that 50,000 letters be sent to

President Johnson

to protest the action against North Vietnam and

to warn the President that he did not have a captive vote.

"Speak Out for Peace"

As Healey was speaking in California, CPUSA national

headquarters was issuing a press release in New York City in which

it condemned the "retaliatory strike" against North Vietnam and

charged that United States warplanes had brought death to innocent

people. The release called for all people "to speak out jor peace"

through petitions, letters, and telegrams to be sent to President

Johnson, Senators, and Congressmen naging negotiations and the

settlement of all

the issues through the existing machinery of

the

14-power Geneva conference and the "good offices of the United Nations."

Stimulate Pressure

By letter dated August 19, 196%, and addressed 60 21

districts, the CPUSA National Organization Department referred to

this press release.

All Party members were urged, because of the

role of "United States imperialism" in Southeast Asia, to use even

greater initiative to stimulate pressure for a negotiated settle-

men't and the convening of a l4-nation conference concerning Vietnam.

Strive for a Conference

At an enlarged meeting of the CPUSA National Board heid

D. C., which would represent the totality of American opinion on

Vietnam and would attempt to bring about a change in United States

policy in Vietnam, In this connection. Johnson suggested that the

Party prepare by the end of November, 1964, a definitive document

on Vietnam and distribute 50,000 copies of

document was prepared and sent to all Party districts with instruc

tions that it be given wide circulation.

Demand for Peace

During a meeting of leading CPUSA functionaries held in

late November, 1964, Arnold Johnson again stressed the need for the

Party to fight against extension of the war in Vietnam.

He stated

that the CPUSA could do this with the "forces striking

for peace."

He suggested that a memorandum on the Party's position be sent to

all districts.

The key point in the memorandum would be the demand

for peace and

an end to the war in Vietnam.

"Key Test"

Following through on Johnson's suggestions, the CPUSA

National Organization Department sent an avalanche of instructions

to all Party districts for activities designed to achieve communist

objectives in south Vietnam. CrUsA district leaders were instructed

to organize activities in the trade-union movement, in youth

organizations, and in religious organizations until peace was

achieved.

The Party directive pointed out that at that time of year

"Peace on Earth"

The CPUSA National Organization Department issued another

directive in early December, 1964, in which Party members were urged

to pay special attention to the full use of the

"Peace on Earth"

sentiment of the people during December.

Party districts were

requested to advise CPUSA national headquarters what was being planned

and

what was being done by labor, youth, women, church organizations,

and

"professionad peace organizations" in their areas to make the

greatest use of the season when the world was calling for "Peace on

Earth."

Appeal to America's Conscience

in still another directive issued in December, 1904,

the

National Organization Department warned all Party districts that

every passing event made it more urgent that all sections of the

population speak out "to end the war in South Vietnam."

Party

districts were urged to make special efforts for mass activities

and expressions of peace during the weekend of December 19-20.: This

Party directive called attention to an enclosed leaflet which

urged

the reader to "join in an appeal to the conscience of America to

end the war in Vietnam." The

"appeal" leaflet called for public

action on December 19, 1964, in the form of leailet distributions,

vigils, and "poster walks"

to protest against actions of the United

States Government in South Vietnam.: Abraham J. Muste and other

well-known pacifists were among those sponsoring this leaflet.

"Aggressive and Barbarous"

Herbert Aptheker spoke on

February 8, 1965, to a rally of

approximately 1,300 students at the University of California at

Berkeley held to protest United States policy in Vietnam.

Aptheker

described an American bombing mission into North Vietnam on

February 7, 1965, as "aggressive and barbarous." During his remarks;

Aptheker Characterized the Viet Cong as "a national libertarian

movemen't front" embraced by the people of Vietnam.

Dramatize the Situation

At a meeting of the New York District Board of the CPUSA

held on February 8, 1965, the late District Orgnizer Robert Thompson

stated that the situation in Vietnam must be dramatized.

In this

regard, he suggested discussions with civil rights leaders, peace

leaders, and trade-union leaders. His other suggestions included

promotion of activities by students in city colleges and the sending

of telegrams and delegations to Senators and Congressmen for the

purpose of denouncing the situation in Vietnam.

Major Point

In a February 9, 1965, memorandum to all districts from

the National Organization

point on the agenda for all the American people was obviously to

bring a halt to the war in South Vietnam, to demand an end to all:

acts of aggression against North Vietnam, to insist that all

military personnel and forces of the United States be withdrawn

from South Vietnam, and to insure that the Vietnamese be given an

opportunity to determine their own destiny and to exercise their

right of self-determination. By means of this memorandum, Party

districts were instructed to take immediate steps to cooperate with

all national peace organizations in regard to activities involving

picket lines, peace walks, student assemblies, delegations to

Washington, and statonents by trade union leaders.

Brink oi Disaster

A CPUSA press release, dated March 2, 1965, contained a

statement by Gus Hall in which he asserted that the bombing of

North Vietnam by United States "forces of aggression" had brought

The press release demanded

an end to all bombing, withdrawal of all troops, ending of the

war in Vietnam, reconvening of the Geneva Conference, and activation

of any agencies of the United Nations which could facilitate peace.

Threat of Nuclear War

Also on March 2, 1965, CPUSA national headquarters sent

a letter to all districts stating that it was obvious that the

major crisis facing the American people was the threat of a world

nuclear war arising from the escalation of the unjust war in Vietnam.

The letter urged that every step be taken quickly to express every i

form of protest against this threatened world war.

"Atrocious War"

In a memorandum to all districts dated March 31, 1965,

the

CPUSA National Organization Department referred to the

"atrocious

war" in Vietnam and urged protest actions.

In this regard, it was

stated that April 17, 1965, was becoming the major point of concen-

tration for youth, for adults in peace organizations, and

for the Left,

including conmunists.: The Party directive also described the

planned Aprid Ji, 1965, Student March on Washington to end the

war in Vietnam as the

"biggest single action cabling for an ena

to the war in

Vietnam."

Testing Ground

On March 30, 1965, Herbert Aptheker spoke to some 200

persons in New York

City and attacked United States policy in

Vietnam, He stated that this country was using Vietnam

as a

testing ground for new weapons, was exploiting the people and

resources of Vietnam, and was continuing the war for its

an, ant was continent

imperialist designs.

He urged those in his audience to write

letters to their Senators and to President Johnson for the purpose

of showing their indignation over United States policy and asking

for the withdrawal of United States troops from Vietnam.

said he would participate in the April 17, 1965, March on Washington

and he urged young people in his audience to do likewise.

Leading Role Claimed

At a CPUSA National Committee meeting held in late April,

1965, Gus Hall charged that the United States was guilty of

"imperialist aggression" and that its activities in Vietnam could

be compared with fascism in Nazi Germany. Hall contended that the

United States had been able to escalate the war because the Sino-.

Soviet dispute had prevented the "socialist countries" from

presenting a united front.

In concluding his report, Hall claimed

that CPUSA officials and members had taken part in the leadership,

planning, and initiation of recent mass actions to protest the

war in Vietnam.

Need for More Militant Activities*

Among those participating in the discussion of Hall's

report was James Tormey, a leading member of the Party's New York

District.

Tormey stated that there was a need for more militant

and demonstrative activities and an intensification of the fight

against United States "imperialism" in Vietnam.

Top Priority Project

Gus Hall told the CPUSA Secretariat on April 28, 1965, that

the "peace struggle" was one of the main projects for the Party

and would be pushed on a full-time basis. He instructed Party

leaders to have the CPUSA work with all kinds of people in demon-

strative actions and in putting pressure on the administration,

Senators, Congressmen, and other Government officials. The idea

of pressure, Hall added, must be maintained in every possible way,

including the use of advertisements.

Hall also stated that this

had to remain a major and top priority project for the CPUSA and

suggested that Arnold Johnson work full time on it.

Escalation of Protest Movements

Hall claimed, in a speech made at Los Angeles on May 2,

1965, that the most significant recent development was the

escalation of mass protest movements by the American people.

a period of a month, he noted, there were two historic mass

mobilizations-one in Alabama and one in Washington, D. C.

most popular slogan in the Alabama mobilization, Hall maintainea,

"Bring the troops back from Vietnam and send them to Alabama."

Thus, Hall concluded, civil rights leaders were also becoming

peace leaders and

peace leadors were becoming civil rights leaders

Cumulative Effect

At an appearance at Oberlin College on May 12, 1965,

Herbert Aptheker again criticized United States foreign policy.

He described American policy in Vietnam as illegal, immoral,

militarily untenable, and diplomatically disastrous.

Urging a

united front against the war in Vietnam, Aptheker supported an

appeal in "The New York Times," signed by 800 college professors,

which called for a "cease fire," negotiations with the Viet Cong,

an end to air raids, the use of the good offices of the United

Nations, and assurances to the world that America would not use

nuclear

weapons in pursuit of victory or peace.

Addressing himseli

to protest demonstrations, Aptheker

contended that they were

a cumulative effect.

Number One Priority

By memorandum dated July 8, 1965, the Communist Party's

New York District called attention of all clubs to the need for

peace activities. It was stated in this memorandum that the

further escalation of the war in Vietnam and the continuing inter-

vention oi United States military forces in the Dominican Republic

made peace activities the Number One priority of the entire CPUSA

organization.

No Relaxation

The Party's New York District issued another memorandum

on july 26, 1965, calling attention to the fact that the CPUSA

had undertaken and had been involved in many actions, protests,

educational forums around the burning question of war and

peace.

The memorandum went on to say that no relaxation or

slowing down of

activities could be allowed.

On the contrary,

activities must be multiplied and must involve more people in

the communitie

Be More Active

On August 14, 1965, young Party members of Seattle

and Portland met in Portland, Oregon.

The main speaker was

Bettina Aptheker.

She stated that Party youth must be more

active and must not be afraid to take open action.

She said

that she had been at the scene earlier in the month when troop

trains had almost been stopped at Oakland, California.

According

to Aptheker, young communists from the San Francisco area had a

part in organizing the efforts to hait troop trains in California.

Slogans Approved

A feature of the CPUSA national youth cadre conference

held near Monterey, Indiana, in mid-September, 1965, was a three-

hour lecture by Gus Hall.

Predictably, a major portion of Hall's

lecture was devoted to the war in Vietnam.

He instructed that

the CPUSA must use slogans in an effort to force the United

States to retreat in Vietnam.

Hall then cited with approval the

following slogans, which he attributed to the Women Strike for

Peace:

Stop the Bombing! No More U. S. Troops in Vietnam?

Negotiations Based on the Geneva Agreement!

Slogans Supplied

In a letter to all districts dated September 10, 1965,

the CPUSA national office advised that the following slogans

should be used to strengthen the campaign to end the war in

Vietnam and for greater unity of all "peace" forces:

*End

With All Energy

At a September, 1965, meeting of a press club of the

Party's New York District, the

late Jack Stachel told the

communist editors present

that they must continue with all

their energy to expose American imperialist policies in Vietnam

and elsewhere.

Stachel urged them to support the demands of

the Women Strike for Peace, which, he said, included a

cessation of bombing to create an

atmosphere for negotiations;

implementation of the 1954 Geneva decisions; and negotiation,

with all concerned, particularly with the National Liberation

Front (Viet Cong).

Gus Hall held a press conference in October, 1965,

stated that the time had come when all nations must have

the right to determine their own affairs. Therefore, he

said, the United States had no right--moral or legal--to be

in Vietnam.

He condemned efforts of the United States to

"whip up" an atmosphere of war hysteria against the peace

novement.

The United States policy of "imperialism and

aggression," Hall added, was the basis for this Nation's

problems.

Washington Weekend

In the Fall of 1965, the National Coordinating

Committee to End the War in Vietnam issued a call for a four-

day National Antiwar Convention to be held in Washington, D. C.,

on November 27, 1965.

Plan To Influence

The subject of the antiwar convention was introduced

by Arnold Johnson at a meeting of leading CPUSA functionaries

held in New York City on October 23, 1965. He said the Party

should make plans in advance to influence the convention and

expressed the hope that the convention would form a loose,

the convention with whom

the Party would not

want to work ordinarily, but it was important,

under the circumstances, to work with the whole group.

Major Peace Events

In a November 12, 1965, letter to all districts!

"CPUSA

national headquarters described

the march and the convention to

be held in Washington as two major peace events calling "for

urgent and constant attention."

Party headquarters requested

information on what was being done to support these events by

sending delegates and participants, In a reference to the

march, the directive stated that all areas could afford to raise

their sights and goals to make this a major peace demonstration,

because the "Johnson Administration is bringing every pressure

and using every device to suppress the protest." Concerning

the convention, CPUSA headquarters asserted that this could be a

major event to establish coordination among "varied

organizations" and that it deserved cooperation.

Points for Peace

in a document dated November 17, 1965, addressed to all

districts and captioned "Memo on End Vietnam War Action," CPUSA

headquarters referred to its November 12 directive and reiterated

that both events scheduled for Washington called for the most

urgent and maximum attention as the "major points for peace

mobilization."

This communication informed the membership that

several communist "spokesmen" would be at the convention and

would have available relevant material.

Party Mobilization

It did not take long for the messages from CPUSA

headquarters to reach the membership, It was announced, for

example, at a meeting of the Lower East Side Section of

Party's

New York District held on November 21, 1965, that there

should be an "all-out" effort to influence people to participate

in the march. On November 18,

there was a meeting of the

steering committee of Trade Unionists for Peace,

As noted

previously, this organization was formed by the CPUSA to mobilize

the laboring class for the cause of peace, especially in Vietnam.

november 16, a functionary in the Party's New York District

stated that the CPUSA planned

to send delegates, openly identified

as CrUSA members, to Washington for the march and the rational

antiwar convention.

"Unjust War"

Gus Hall made several statements about the war in

Vietnam during a news conference he held in Chicago on December 6,

1965.

The most critical question before the world today, he

said, is the unpopular, "criminal" action of the United States

in Vietnam.

The position of the CPUSA, he pointed out, is that

this is an

"unjust war." Hall also declared that the CPUSA has

been active in demonstrations urging that the war be ended

quickly through negotiations with the National Liberation Front,

the only legitimate government of South

Vietnam.

Expanding and Unifying

Vietnam was mentioned prominently in a report made by

Hall at an enlarged meeting of the CPUSA National Committee

held in January, 1966. He claimed that the peace movement was

expanding and unifying. Hall told his audience that the CPUSA

had been participating openly in the peace movement and that the

Party's participation changed the character of the peace movement

by helping it to develop a more "anti-imperialist corscwusness."

He also ordered that every CPUSA

member must be active in some aspect of the fight for peace.

"Any and All" Slogans

At the National Committee meeting held in January, 1966,

Herbert Aptheker reported on a trip he had made to North Vietnam

in late December, 1965. Aptheker announced that he had met with

leaders of the Communist Party of North Vietnam who told him

that they were "deliriously happy" that the CPUSA had finally

established contact with them, because they want "close fraternal

ties" with the CPUSA. Aptheker also reported that the North

his report, he stated that the peace movement had already begun

to "rock the Nation." He described it as a movement which had

shiited its center of gravity leftward and as a movement whose

full weight of criticism and confrontation was directed against

Washington in a challenge to American foreign policy in Vietnam.

Historic Date

Heisler recalled, in his report, that the first mass

action to protest the war in Vietnam occurred on April 17, 1965--

called this date historic because it brought about a major

breakthrough--the policy of "non-exclusion" of communists in

activities for peace.

Also in regard to peace demonstrations,

Heisler praised the National Coordinating Committee to End the

War in Vietnam and described it as an organization whose main

forces were

"left-oriented."

Grass-Roots Crusade

The CPUSA held a two-week national "youth educational

encampment" at Camp Webatuck, Wingdale, New York, during the

period from August 29 through September 11, 1966.

A portion of

the final day of the encampment was set aside for a lecture by

National Chairman Henry Winston. He told his listeners that it

was imperative that the CPUSA organize a nationwide grass-roots

crusade for peace in Vietnam. Winston claimed that labor and

minority groups are the key to the development of oppositionto

the war in Vietnam,

Solid opposition to this war, Winston

added, must be developed by the Party during the coming political

campaigns.

Following this encampment, the CPUSA held a three-day

Director Michael Zagarell described the war in Vietnam as the

crucial issue facing the CPUSA.

Zagarell told the young Party

leaders that the war in Vietnam is responsible for inflation,

for the drafting of students, for a curtailment of funds for

education, for a cutback in the war on poverty, and for worsen-

ing conditions in the Negro community.

The CPUSA, Zagarell

stressed, believes that it is possible to end the

war in Vietnam

through the election of Congressmen who oppose the war.

He then

urged support for independent candidates, support for outspoken

antiwar candidates of the two major political parties, and

promotion of "peace ballots" if all the candidates are prowar:

Among a number of goals for Party youth proposed by

Zagarell at this youth conference was the organizing of a CPUSA-

initiated national student strike.

The conference also heard a

special report from Bettina Aptheker, who originated the proposal

for & national student strike.

She announced that a planning

meeting for the strike will be held in Chicago during the

Christmas, 1966, recess.

International support will be obtained

so that

simultaneous strikes will occur in several countries.

Aptheker stated that the purpose of the strike will be to protest

the draft, weapons research on college campuses, and the effects

of the war in Vietnam on domestic affairs.

numerical goal,

according to Aptheker, is a student strike with halt a million

participants in the United States.

The CPUSA National Board at a meeting held in late

September, 1966, agreed to give full cooperation to the

committee chaired by Abraham J. Muste and established to plan a

variety of activities for peace in Vietnam from November 5 through

November 8, 1966.

DUBOIS CLUBS POLICY ON VIENAN

As a communist-controlled group, the W. E. B. DuBois

Clubs of America (DCA) follows the CPUSA line on Vietnam, just

as it has paralleled other communist policy since it was

founded in June, 1964, on the orders of CPUSA General

Secretary Gus Hall.

Vietnam Resolution

A Midwest Regional Conference of the DCA was held

in late February, 1965, at the Student Memorial Union,

located on the campus of the University of Wisconsin.

Conference adopted a resolution on Vietnam calling for the

withdrawal of United States troops, cessation of all aid io

Jnited States "aggression" and

Conference also instructed each DCA unit in the Midwest Region

to establish an educational committee on Vietnam.

"Stepped-Up" Campaign

In March, 1965, the DCA National Office sent to 211

its branches an "Emergency Memo on Viet Nam Crisis."

In this

memorandum, the opinion was expressed that it was possible to

mobilize massive support for a movement to bring peace to

Vietnam. It was further stated that the DCA was circulating

in colleges and universities a petition of refusal to serve

in the Armed Forces against the people of Vietnam.

In

conclusion, the CA memorandum called upon all chapters,

members, and friends of the DCA to join with all groups and

individuals in. a "stepped-up" campaign to end the war in

Vietnam.

Coordinators Conference

A national conference of area coordinators and "friends"

of the DCA was held in Chicago during May, 1965. At this

conference, it was concluded that DCA efforts throughout the

Summer of 1965 must be directed toward building mass pressure

and protest against the policy of the United States on Vietnam.

The conference also passed a motion that it is the position of

the DCA that the National Liberation Front is the only true

representative of the

people of south Vietnam.

At this meeting,

it was decided that the DCA

would work closely with the National Coordinating

Public Not Kept Informed

Herbert Aptheker was one of the featured speakers

at the second National Convention of the DA held in Chicago

com June 17 through June 19, 1966. In his remarks, Aptheker

claimed that the administration is not keeping the public

informed about the situation in Vietnam. He advocated removal

of all United States troops from Vietnam, diversion oi all

funds being spent on the war in Vietnam to the war on poverty,

and United States participation in a peace conference in

Geneva.

"Militant Forms"

The DCA National Executive Committee, which governs

the day-to-day activities of the organization, issued a learlet

on june 30, 1966, which stated in part:

"In every area the

DuBois Cluos must help initiate a balanced program aimed at

a variety of people and utilizing a variety of forms of

opposition to the bombing and to the war."'

The leaflet called

for demonstrations and mass distribution of leaflets as the

first part of an intensified campaign to end the bombing and

the war and stated further that "militant forms" of protest

should not be excluded or discouraged.

"LSS"S Useless War"

in late July, 1966, the dcA was distributing a

leaflet which protested "LBi's useless war" in Vietnam.

leaflet alleged that the war in Vietnam is a racist war being

waged by black soldiers against colored people. The leaflet

also contained a charge that those in Washington who are

directing the war and ordering bombings in Vietnam are

criminals.

SOCIALIST WORKERS PARTY POLICY ON VIETNAM

The Socialist Workers Party (SWP) was formed in

1938 and is a militantly revolutionary party based upon the

theories of Marx, Engels, and Lenin as interpreted by the late

Leon Trotsky, Its national membership is estimated at less

than 500.

Withdraw Troops

In the elections of 1964, the SWP ran Clifton DeBerry

and Edward Shaw for President and Vice President of the

United States.

Shaw is the SWP National Organizational

Secretary.

DeBerxy is the son-in-law of SWP National Secretary

Farrell Dobbs.

In its political campaign, the SWP advocated,

among other things, withdrawal of United States troops irom

South Vietnam. DeBerry received a little over 33,000 votes.

"Contact Work"

Members of the SWP and its youth affiliate, the

Young Socialist Alliance (YSA), attended a closed membership

meeting of the New York SWP Local on April 8, 1965.

At this

meeting, both SWP and YSA members were urged to participate

in the April 1?, 1965, March on Washington to end the war in

Vietnam sponsored by the Students for a Democratic Society.

It was stated that the main purpose of their participating

waS

"to make YSA and SW intervention, to do contact work,

and to sell copies of 'The Militant'" (SWP newspaper) "and the

'Young Socialist'" (YSA publication). At this meeting, it was

stressed that SWP members participating in the march should

concentrate on selling these publications so that YSA members

would be free to do "contact work" among the students.

Detroit Committee

By memorandum dated March 16, 1966, Jan Garrett,

Detroit SWP Organizer, detailed for SWP members only

a two-page

case study of the Detroit Committee to End the War in

Vietnam.

Garrett stated in this memorandum that the YSA had originally

proposed the creation of a united

front committee to support

the April 17, 1965, March

on Washington. As a result of this

proposal, Detroit members of the YS,

"a couple of SDS members,"

and a "couple of stalinists," formed the Detroit Committee to

The following is a sampling of headlines which

appeared during 1965 in "The Miiitant," the SWP newspaper:

"Johnson Presses Vietnam War in Defiance of World Opinion";

"Johnson's Bombings Keep World at Brink in Vietnam"; "Johnson's

Trigger-Happy Aggression Brings U. S. to New Brink in Vietnam';

"Why Are the People Denied a Voice on Crucial Issue of

War in Vietnam? Should One Man

Endanger Lives of All Mankind?"

The SWP also uses "The Militant" to try to exploit antiwar

sentiment by promoting the slogan, "Bring the Troops Home Now."

Copies of "The Militant" have been handed out freely during

Vietnam demonstrations.

Principal Task

SWP National Committee member Joseph Hansen,

who had

been on foreign assignment for the SWP as an

"observer" of

developments in the international Trotskyist movement, made a

report at the 2lst National Convention of the SWP held in

September, 1965.

Hansen maintained that, if the Soviet Union

was really a revolutionary country, it could have made the

United States think twice about increasing its support to

South Vietnam.

Hansen also asserted that little revolutionary

Cuba took the

correct revolutionary position when Fidel Castro

called on all "socialists" to bury their differences and support

ahead was to

give full

support to the "antiwar movement" led

Very Fortunate

Farrell Dobbs spoke at a closed membership meeting

in November, 1965, the YSA tried to promote the SWP line that

the antiwar movement should be based on the single issue oi

immediate withdrawal of United States troops from Vietnam

rather than multi-issues, including promotion of negotiations.

When the YSA position was defeated at the convention, YSA

PROGRESSIVE LABOR PARTY POLICY ON VIETNAM

Of the militant Marxist-Leninist organizations in

the United States whose policies closely adhere to those of

Communist China, probably the most important to the

Progressive Labor Party. Progressive Labor groups were

formed as early as January, 1962, by dissident elements of

the CPUSA, led by Milton Rosen and Mortimer Scheer, both of

whom held positions in the New York District of the CPUSA

before they were expelled for factionalism in December, 1961.

At an initial national convention, held in New York City ID

AprIl, 1965, Progressive Labor Party (PLP) was the name

selected by

the members of the Progressive Labor Movement.

Headquarters of the PLP is in New York City. In

fact, most of the members of the PLP are located in New York State

and in California.

Estimates of total PLP membership vary from

160 to 500.

Principal PLP publications are "Progressive Labor,"

"Challenge," and "Spark."

Special Edition

The February 9, 1965, issue of "Challenge" was a

special four-page edition containing a Progressive Labor Move-

ment statement on Vietnam. This issue had a press run of

The statement blamed the Vietnam war on

"President Johnson's government," said the war was an excuse

to send poor Negroes and. Puerto Ricans out of the United States

to be killed, and called for demonstrations by people and

organizations

in the United States to show that they would not

support "president Johnson's war."

Immediate Withdrawal

During the PLP's four-day convention in April, 1965,

resolution which would have called for the impeachment of

President Johnson was defeated.

However, a press release issued

after the convention stated that one of the resolutions adopted

condemned "United States aggression in Southeast Asia." It

also called upon all workers,- students, intellectuals, and others

to demand immediate withdrawal of all United States Army

personnel from South Vietnam. In addition,

the resolution urged

all United states citizens to protest the bombing of North

and South Vietnam.

"Documented U. S. Atrocities in Vietnam"; "LBJ Lie Machine."

Peace Efforts Termed "Phony"

In an article by PLP President Milton Rosen in the

February 15, 1966, issue of "Challenge," he referred to efiorts

by the United States to achieve peace in Vietnam and stated

chat the attempt of President Johnson to blackmail the Vietnamese

people into abandoning their fight for freedom had collapsed.

Further, he said that President Johnson's "peace offensive" was

"phony"

and the resumption of the borbing of North Vietnam

underlined

the deceit of the rulers in Washington.

Rosen aiso

stated

that the Vietnamese were winning the war and that

opposition to United States action in Vietnam was developing

in this country.

Selected Statements

From time to time, PLP leaders have made oral state-

ments critical of United States participation in the war in

Vietnam, For example, William Epton, PLP Vice President and

Chairman of the PLP's

Harlem Branch, has been quoted as saying

that he strongly opposes

the war in

Vietnam and has urged his

brothers and sisters not to fight against the people in Vietnam,

because the fight for freedom and liberation is right here in

this country.

At a May 21, 1965, anti-Vietnam demonstration

at the University of California at Berkeley, PLP National

Student Organizer Levi Laub claimed that United States policy

in Vietnam is based on the need for expanding markets and

foreign investments. On January 20, 1966, PLP Organizational

Secretary Edward Lemansky spoke at the campus of the University

of Washington at Seatile.

In an attack on United States policy

on Vietnam, he stated, "We must destroy

this Government and

build a new system."

Youth Group Defunct

to plan and execute a demonstration in New York City on

May 2, 1964, demanding withdrawal of United States troops

from Vietnam.

"Free Student," a publication of the MM,

contained an article in its third issue in which it was

stated that the waM was formed to fight against a politics

of default by organizing student protest and revolt against

the United States Government's "savage war" on the people of

Vietnam.

Vigorous Opposition

At the apex of its existence, the M2M vigorously

opposed the war in Vietnam, joined in a number of campus

protests, and sought to stir up student grievances.

During

the 1965-1966 academic year, M2M endeavored to (1)

form an

alliance besween students and workers, (?) conduct an anti-

Armed Forces induction campaign, and (3) send medical and

material aid to the National Liberation Front in South Vietnam.

"Get Out of Vietnam Now"

The PLP held a "student conference" in New York City

in early September, 1966. It was decided at this conference

vital task for the coming period will be the

destruction of the barriers that separate workers and students

and isolate the student-based antiwar movement. In addition,

it was decided that, on the campuses,

priority

must be given

to building a "Get Out of Vietnam Now" movement, because the

issues of Vietnam and the draft can "unite the student,

workers, and black movements" and bring "students into

direct

confrontation with the university administration and sometimes

with the government."

Student-Worker Alliance

In a report explaining the decisions made at this

conference, it was stated that students are being transformed

Irom "intellectuals" into cannon fodder for Vietnam and are

following in the footsteps of black and white working youth.

on the campuses. At the same time, it was said, there is a

need for working-class action against the war in Vietnam,

because the development of a student-worker alliance is crucial

to a strong movement against "imperialist aggression" in

Vietnam.

reported that WWP Chairman Sam Ballan set the tone for a

Labor Day weekend conference by praising WVP cadres for their

outstanding work and reaffirming WWP

support for the "forgotten

lighters of the National Liberation Front of South Viet Nam."

It was also reported that Ballan said,

"The statement of the
