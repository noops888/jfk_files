MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Special Group (5412) Meeting at 1600 on 13 February

1, Present were Mr. McGeorge Bundy, Mr. McCone,
Mr. Vance, General Taylor, Mr. Alexis Johnson, Mr. Mann,
General Carter, Mr. FitzGerald, and Peter Jessup, General
Taylor and Mr. FitzGerald were present. only for the Cuban
item,

2, Prior to the arrival of Mr. Bundy, General Taylor
mentioned to Mr. Alexis Johnson an upcoming trip of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff to Norfolk, Fort Bragg, and Panama. After
some jocular bantering, Mr. Johnson vetoed the Panama portion
of the trip, with General Taylor hoping that this denial was
purely for the physical protection of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

3. Mr. McCone mentioned the possibility that he might
go to Saigon next week to see what was going on out there.. He
stated that we were not getting sufficient timely information
from the Ambassador and that while he and Mr. McNamara
might be going out later as a follow-up to their December trip,
he felt the need to go now. General Taylor pointed out that
there have been a great many visitors to Saigon in recent months
and perhaps we should give them a rest out there for a while.

In any event, he thought perhaps the newly-created NSAM com-
mittee headed by Sullivan would want to make such a trip, General
Taylor seemed reluctant.to have Mr, McCone go at this time,

Mr. Johnson said he would take a look at it and be in touch with
Mr. McCone early next week.

4, The first item on the agenda was a discussion of
the Vance memo of 10 February on "Clandestine and Covert
Activities Against Cuba.'"' Mr. Vance stated that he was strongly
for this course of action, that the risks were minimal, and that


13-00000

the JCS and Secretary McNamara also strongly supported it.
Mr. Johnson pointed out that he would be much happier if the
paper had been sent to the Cuban Coordinating Committee in
accordance with usual procedures. Mr. Vance stated that the
committee knows all about it and are for it, Mr. McCone
stated that he was disturbed over the trend of events in Cuba
and that this particular paper really does not go far enough,

He pointed out that our economic denial program was eroding
away and that the courses of action proposed by Mr, Vance's
memo gave Castro maximum grounds for righteous indignation
without really accomplishing anything, Mr, Vance stated that
prior activities in this regard had created great consternation
in Cuba, and Bundy challenged this and asked for proof. Mr.
McCone pointed out the many times that we have had to stand
down actions of this type in order to avoid raising the noise
level. General Taylor said that what we really must do is to
reaffirm the belief of the senior policy makers to the President
that a program of this type must be continued. Mr. Bundy
pointed out that the Secretary of Defense had previously stated
to the President, along with Secretary Rusk, that they were
not enthusiastic for this type of activity but he noted now that
Mr. McNamara had reversed his position, Bundy pointed out
that we have been somewhat hesitant to go ahead full force on
these actions because we did not want to prejudice our position
before the OAS in connection with the Venezuelan arms cache,
Mann stated that our entire program as regards Cuba was
ineffective insofar as it could result in any overthrow of Castro,
At about this point both Mr. Mann and Mr. McCone stated that
we should do everything possible to create provocations and
distressing actions against Castro. Bundy stated that the low
risk actions appear unrewarding and that rewarding actions have
too high a risk. Mann stated that we need to do a lot more
homework before the next OAS meeting (presently unscheduled)
and Bundy said in any event we must have a top-level Cabinet
Meeting with the President to discuss this whole matter, The
agenda item was left as follows:

a. Mann is to get the Crimmins staff hard at work
on the Vance paper and on other alternative courses
of action to include pros and cons, noise levels,
estimated results, etc.


13-00000

b. Mann is to send around a draft OAS resolution
which was prepared during Martin's time.

c. As to the specific paragraphs of the Vance
memo, Bundy indicated his personal views (not an
Administration commitment) that items 1 and 2a were
OK; 2b for Cuban ships only; 3a should be intensified;
3b and 3c were directly connected to a separate black-
list enterprise; 4 was OK. As for actions against
Cuban subversion in Latin America, on paragraph 1 we
should see just what our opportunities are, and on para-
graph 2 CIA should determine just what we think the
local traffic will bear and just what our capabilities
might be,

Finally, after a very short discussion on low-level reconnaissance
requirements for Cuba, General Taylor and Mr. McCone decided
to pay close attention to high-level results on Friday, Saturday,
and Sunday, and to take a fresh reading on the matter on Monday.
Action: DD/I to cover the low-level matter over the weekend,
DD/P to ride herd on the activities generated by the Vance memo.

5. The next item was a very cursory review of the
covert action programs for| | France, Tibet, and
China, Mr, Vance asked how we could measure the effectiveness
of such actions and Mr. McCone pointed out to him that this could
not be: really adequately measured and gave all the reasons therefor.
Mr. Vance stated that he was just getting broken into this type of
activity and he would appreciate some briefings by the action
officers. (It was subsequently arranged through Pete Jessup to
have Colby and Bill O'Ryan make appointments with Secretary Vance
specifically to discuss French operations and our Far Eastern
operations.

6. Mr. McCone then brought up the matter of the SAC U-2
aircraft in Manila as covered in his memorandum of 13 February
which was not given any distribution, Mr, McCone said that ever
since 1954 it had been established policy that all reconnaissance
flights over denied and unfriendly territory or covert flights over


13-00000

friendly territory were a responsibility of the Director of
Central Intelligence with the customary approvals of the Special
Group and that he wished this policy reaffirmed and proper
direction be given so that the DCI would designate the organiza~
tion and resources to be used, either SAC or CIA. Mr, Vance
stated that NRO was involved and that upon receiving the urgent
requirement from CINCPAC for this single flight and upon
learning that the Taiwan assets were stood down because of fuel
control problems, the JCS, Mr. McNamara, and he had agreed
that SAC should fly the flight. He stated that Mr. McAfee of the
State Department had been informed on Sunday night and that
the Base Commander in the Philippines also knew about it. He
stated that there were only two targets concerned and that with
luck they could be obtained with a single flight. Mr. McCone
pointed out that the question had not been raised with him by
Steakley as to military aircraft or sanitized aircraft nor was he
aware of the cover plan that might be utilized in the event of
difficulties, Mr, Vance stated it would be the regular cover
plan of a weather ship off course. Vance said this was a one-
shot problem only and that as soon as it was completed, the
planes and crews would be withdrawn. He said both he and
McNamara were greatly surprised when they learned that SAC
had sent three airplanes and seven crews to perform this single
mission. He said they could understand the need for two air-
planes in case one aborted but certainly not this large contingent.
He said this had no connection with the South Vietnam broad
coverage mapping and that the Taiwan assets should be used for
this.

7. It was apparent that all were in agreement that the
Director of Central Intelligence had the responsibility for
approving requirements for photo coverage and for determining
the appropriate resources to be used for this coverage whenever
it required overflights of denied or hostile territory or whenever
it required covert flights over friendly territory. Mr. Bundy
stated that the DCI should prepare the necessary directive to
this effect and circulate it to the other members of the Special
Group for their approval at the next meeting. Action: DD/S&T

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Disarmament Meeting on 18 January 1964
at the White House

1, At 2:45 this date Mr. Alexis Johnson informed me that
there would be a meeting with the President at 3:15 p.m., in
the White House to discuss the most recent revision of his
proposed statement to the Geneva Conference, and that I was
expected to be there. Upon arriving at the meeting place I was
handed a draft by Adrian Fisher. It subsequently developed
that McNamara, Rusk, Taylor, and the President must have
had this draft for at least long enough to have thoroughly reviewed
and considered it. In any event, I read it immediately and was
struck by the fact.that in those areas of the original draft as
given toMr. McCone by Dr. Scoville in which the DCI had taken
exception, ameliorating language had been inserted in the new
draft to considerably temper and meet objections of Mr. McCone.
The draft was now much more a speech by the President as to
what he hoped might develop as a result of mutual give and take
rather than a statement of U. S. policy and definite intentions.

2, The President entered the room shortly, accompanied
by Bill Moyer and Jack Valenti. Others present were Rusk,
McNamara, General Taylor, Dr. Seaborg, Adrian Fisher, and
myself. Alexis Johnson was not present.

3. The President opened by stating that he had read the
revised draft and wanted to know if there were any objections to
it. Dr. Seaborg pointed out that he had some hesitancy about
opening totally his closed-down plants for international inspection
(paragraph 3, page 3) but that there were many ways of deter-
mining whether or not the reactor was in fact shut down -- he
simply did not want to give carte blanche to inspectors overrunning
the entire plant. This position was adopted. Dr. Seaborg then



13-90000

said that he wanted it understood that the closing down of the
plants was not necessarily a permanent commitment and that
whenever it became necessary or desirable, in the absence
of international agreement to the contrary, we should retain
complete freedom of action to reopen a reactor any time we
chose. This position was agreed.

4, Mr. McNamara pointed out that he had been working
steadily the last few days to get agreement in the Pentagon on
a paper substantially in accord with this draft and that the only
thing that now gave them a problem was subparagraph (c) on
page 4 as to the establishment of nuclear-free zones. He said
if this could be deleted, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the
Department of Defense would buy the paper. Their concern
was that we would get so involved in these zones that we would
lose freedom of action to shift nuclear weapons through the
Canal Zone, for example, or by air through overflights.
Secretary Rusk pointed out that they had discussed this a num-
ber of times before, that it was nothing new, and that he would
hope we could establish nuclear-free zones in Latin America
and Africa for example. The President said that when the
crunch came he depended on the Joint Chiefs of Staff and that
he must have them on his side. Accordingly the paragraph on
nuclear-free zones was eliminated.

5. I then stated that the President should know that there
was on record a letter from Mr. McCone pointing out some
problem areas that could develop in a number of these points,
particularly as to our getting back into a position of letting up
on the need for full and adequate verification. I further said
that aside from the intelligence aspects of the problem, there
were certain policy matters as regards reaction of West Germany,
and particularly France, that should be considered. The President
then asked for Mr. McCone's letter and glanced through it rather
hurriedly. General Taylor asked to see the letter and he did the
same. I-then gave a copy to Secretary Rusk, particularly pointing
out those portions of DCI's letter concerning his membership on
the Committee of Principals and his reservations at the policy



13-00000

level. Mr. Rusk indicated he had seen Mr. McCone's letter.
(Subsequently Mr. Adrian Fisher stated that they had worked
all afternoon and most of the night in revising the original

draft to meet the objections raised by the DCI and he thought

that they had moderated their language and weasel -worded the
statement adequately to meet DCI's objections.) The President
then asked me if I had any specific, further objections to the
statement now that the nuclear-free zone problem had been
eliminated and that the DCI's letter was on record. I stated

that depending upon what was actually finally determined as an
international agreement, we might be in serious trouble on
verification but that this problem would come later. I felt that
as a statement by the President there was adequate protection

in future negotiations to ensure the best interests of the United
States. (I subsequently checked with Adrian Fisher who assured
me that there was no backoff in ACDA and State from the require-
ment for adequate verification and that the additional words
inserted in the latest draft were specifically to meet DCI's prior
objections, In other words, DCI's letter of comment is a matter
of record with the President and the other principals at the
meeting, and the President commented that the Central Intel-
ligence Agency was certainly a smooth-operating outfit. It was
obvious that he had his tongue in his cheek in this regard to
indicate that we not only covered our rear but our flanks as well.)
The President then directed a number of actions as regards
Congressional briefings, preparation of a talk for him to make
to the American public in explanation of his Geneva Conference
statement. In connection with this speech for American con-
sumption, he directed that it be prepared so that any tenant
farmer could understand it -- ten words per sentence, four sen-
tences per paragraph, and four-letter words throughout.

6. This ended discussion of the Geneva Conference statement.
7. New subjects:

a. There was then a discussion of a letter to Khrushchev
but I was not aware of the contents nor were the contents

mentioned. _ The discussion revolved around the date at which
such a letter would be made public.

Sieciaeet|



13-00000

b. The President then expressed his great concern
over the emergent situation in Panama. He said that he
had proposed injecting himself directly into the problem
yesterday with a public statement and approaches to the
OAS specifically to lay down publicly exactly what the facts
were as regards Panamian aggression, intrusions into the
Zone, killing of American soldiers with rifle bullets by
snipers while they were armed only with bird shot, etc.,
etc. He said that he had been dissuaded from this course
by the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of State and
others. He said he was shocked to read in this morning's
New York Times a story (presumably the Tad Szulc article)
that pretty well covered exactly what his proposals were.
He said he still felt if was a good idea and that he thought
Harriman, Rusk, McNamara, Johnson, and others should
assemble small groups of Latin American Ambassadors and
tell them what he, the President, wanted to tell them. He
thought it was an even better idea if he did it himself. I did
not get the impression that a decision was made in this
regard nor do I think any action will be taken as a result of
this meeting. Unfortunately the discussion centered then
on the security aspects of leaks to the public and the President
expressed in no uncertain terms, with great persuasiveness
and even more emphasis, his unhappiness at his complete
inability to say anything to anyone without its immediately’
being in the papers or getting around town. He made some
very pointed comments reflecting on the integrity of the State
Department and of the Department of Defense in this regard.
He felt. the situation had become extremely serious in the past
two months since he had become President and did not recall
any such problem when he was meeting periodically with
President Kennedy. He said he was prepared to clean house
wherever necessary to overcome this. Secretary Rusk pointed
out that this had been going on for twenty years and was nothing
new and McNamara agreed. The President thought it was
worse than he had ever seen it before and that in his 22 years
on the Armed Services Committee and around the Hill he had
never been involved in anything like this nor had he ever been



13-00000

-5-

bothered by reporters once he had made it clear that he
was not the talking kind. No decisions were taken, no
actions directed although both Rusk and McNamara indi-
cated they would immediately take whatever steps were
feasible to improve the situation.

c. The President then reverted to Cuba and said that
he questioned seriously whether these sabotage efforts were
the proper thing for the U. S. to be doing. He thought they
were both hypocritical and ineffectual and while he under-
stood the need for some of them to maintain the morale of
internal dissidents to the Castro regime and to maintain the
morale of Cuban exiles, he thought probably these consider-
ations were outweighed by the hypocrisy of our seeking peace
and talking peace and conducting this sort of activity on the
side. Rusk said that he had never been in favor of this pro-
gram and had the same doubts the President did. McNamara
said that he too had never been in favor of this program and
questioned our participation. I stated that while this program
was conducted by the CIA, every action taken had the full
approval of the Special Group on which the Secretary of State
and the Secretary of Defense were adequately represented
and that the program was designed in part for the specific
purpose of generating internal sabotage and dissidents with
a view to creating as many problems as possible for Castro
and with a view to getting an escalation of anti-Castro activi-
ties in Cuba, that over the long run any type of effort such
as this was an irritant to Castro and that such action had
some effect, even though slight, on the Cuban economy. I
said that over the long run you could not expect the Castro
regime to fall from these actions alone but that every little
bit helped, and that we had noticed over the past four months
a considerable increase in sabotage actions generated from
internal Cuban elements over which we exercised no control.
I said that I could not take exception to the fact that this
policy was a hypocritical one in the light of a peace offensive
although I did not feel we were trying to make peace with
Castro. I also pointed out that sabotage activities in North



seo
FYis £

fy
ey

ay

Vietnam likewise had hypocritical aspects. At this point
Mr. McNamara demurred and said North Vietnam was an
entirely different matter but he gave no reasons therefor
and this point was not developed further, General Taylor
noted that in connection with sabotage operations they kept
Castro constantly on the alert and kept his forces heavily
occupied running hither and yon, The President noted that
this was probably true but so little gain in it and generally
seemed disaffected with sabotage efforts. Rusk pointed out
that there was some value in maintaining some pressure of
this type since to completely desist would eventually lead
Castro to believe that he was immune from retaliation. The
President then directed that he wanted a complete review

of our Cuban policy and some new, imaginative thinking
developed. I stated that this was presently heavily in train
in all appropriate agencies of the Government, and Rusk and
McNamara nodded their agreement. The President said he
would want to meet as soon as people had drawn up their
proposals. In connection with Cuba the President noted that
he continued to desire the most drastic pressures on our
Allies to insist upon their cooperation and assistance and
compliance in our economic denial program against Cuba.
He said that Segni and Erhard had both assured him we could
count on the full cooperation of Italy and West Germany to
cease any further Cuban trade. He said he wanted similar
discussions prepared for him whenever he met these leaders
and for our leaders to take the same line in any discussions
they might have.

d.. There was minor discussion as regards the situation
in Re Vietnam with no one indicating any great enthusiasm
or any great surge of hopefulness as to the present situation.
The President stated he was most unhappy to be making a
speech indicating that things were improving and then to have
a USIA spokesman and an Embassy spokesman state in Saigon
that things were falling apart. He said somebody was getting
poor advice as well as poor information and he was inclined
to think it was he. He said that he was new in the job and
that he had in the past several months based his actions on

ec

vce.

EYES v.


13-00000

the advice and guidance he had received from his principal
advisers whom he considered professionals and experts

in their fields. He said he was beginning to have serious
doubts that his own judgment had been wrong in a number
of cases although he was the first to admit that he had been
wrong in the past throughout his life at various times and
was certainly no more immune than anyone else from
making mistakes. I got the distinct impression that he was
mighty unhappy with some of the actions he has taken as a
result of recommendations from State. I also got the feeling
that from here on out he is much more liable to use his own
intuition and prescience as to what should be done and what
should not be done in the daily operations of his actions in
the foreign policy field.

e. Turning to more pleasant matters, the President
noted that the dinner he had given for the Congressional
Committee leadership had been a complete success and that
he was going to repeat it again on the 23rd and the 30th. He
had received nothing but highly favorable accolades from
the people who had attended and many of them indicated it
was the first time they had ever been in the White House and
certainly the first time they had had an adequate briefing by
the Administration leadership. The President said that he
had received a phone call saying that he should continue this
and he was certainly going to do so. He had also been
promised that at least in large measure as a result of this
briefing he would have a tax bill reported out by Wednesday.
The President then said we could doa lot better. He told
Rusk and McNamara that they should take a nap in the after-
noon prior to these two dinners so they would be much
fresher and more alert -- that they had done an A No. 1 job
but not quite up to the caliber that they had put on for the
labor leaders -- in his mind that performance could not have
been better. The President said he had planned for the
briefing to be twenty minutes and that instead it had lasted
an hour. He said that this was entirely too long and that
Mr. McCone alone had spoken for seventeen minutes. He

then said that for the next two dinners he was going to have
only two briefers and the briefing would be scheduled for
fifteen minutes and that twenty minutes was the absolute
maximum he:would sit still for. He said he wanted Mr.
Rusk and Mr. McNamara to work this out together, with
Mr. McNamara covering both the U. S. military and the
Soviet military as covered by Mr. McCone, and Rusk
covering the Soviet economy and the world roundup as
covered by Rusk and McCone at the last hearing. I sub-
sequently checked with Bill Moyer to determine whether
this was a change from the President's instructions to Mr.
McCone or whether it might have been an oversight. Mr.
Moyer stated that the President had given much thought to
this and since Mr. McCone would be away, he had changed
the system to the one just enumerated. This makes abun-
dant sense to me under the circumstances and I considered
any further discussion either with Moyer or the President
inappropriate.

8. The meeting then broke up at 4:15 because the President

had to go out to dedicate a building.

9. The foregoing notes are ina single copy and will be shown

only to the Director upon his return,. Any actions indicated will
be directed by me at the Monday morning meeting. I will senda
very short, sanitized report of this meeting to Mr. McCone by
cable,

Marshall S. Carter
Lieutenant General, USA
Acting Director



1, The background as to the purpose of this visit is covered
in my Memorandum for the Record dated 1 January on my visit to
Independence to see Mr. Truman.

2, We departed Kansas City airport in the early afternoon
of 31 December, arriving at the Johnson City airport ghortly before
3:00. This airport was built by President Johnson in his own back
yard and was subsequently turned over to Johnson City as their
airport. We were taken to the Johnson residence and made com-
fortable in the combination office-sitting room just off the dining
room. Coffee was served and ina few moments the President and
Mrs. Johnson joined us. After appropriate welcoming to the ranch,
Mrs. Johnson retired to her household chores.

3. Mr. Murphy briefed the President on our discussions
with Mr. Truman and reported to the President Mr. Truman's
desire to help in any way he could during the coming year. Mr.
Murphy followed generally the comments indicated in my previous
memorandum as put forward by Mr. Truman. I thought he gave a
much too favorable report on Mr. Truman's condition and mental
agility. This was understandable to me since Murphy is one of the
junior old cronies of Mr. Truman. The President asked me for
my reaction and I gave it substantially in accordance with the last
paragraph of my Truman memorandum. I told the President that
I certainly felt Mr. Truman was willing to do anything he could or
was asked to do to assist President Johnson; that my own reaction
was that Mr. Truman was in some respects senile and living 90%
on memories and his past. I stated that I thought there was certainly
nothing wrong with Mr. Truman's mind or alertness but that I felt
some caution should be exercised in just how Mr. Truman's assets
might be utilized. The President made no comment except to note


13-00000

wryly that he himself occasionally had problems with his memory
but that he did not think he was yet living with it entirely. The
President then noted that we should have been briefing Mr. Truman
more often and that perhaps had we done so, it would have pre-
vented the type of article he had recently published about the CIA.
The President then stated that he wanted President Hoover,
President Eisenhower, and President Truman briefed monthly on
the international situation as well as on the domestic situation

and what his programs were. (Action: This requires follow-up
with the White House and possibly a discussion between Mr. McCone
and the President since Mr. McCone indicated informally that he
thought once a month was too often and that, in any event, while
CIA can handle the international situation, we should have some
other agency handle the domestic situation. )

4, The President then made a number of statements which
seemed to be in part his philosophy of operations and in others a
repetition of his conversation with Erhard. It was difficult to
separate when he was repeating what he had said to Erhard and
when he was stating a Johnson principle.

5. The President stated that he was much taken with Erhard
and that he thought him a smart, articulate German who was much
more appealing than Adenauer. Erhard apparently attempted to
feel the President out as to his reactions to various statements and
positions taken by deGaulle. The President got the impression that
Erhard was initially trying to play off deGaulle against the President.
Mr. Johnson told Erhard that as far as he, Mr. Johnson, was con-
cerned, he was going to do everything possible to promote a peaceful
world but without in any way relaxing either our guard or our military
strength; he was prepared to walk around the world if necessary to
promote peace when he was convinced that such walking would assist --
on the other hand, he had no intention of making trips just to cultivate
friends and promote the giving away of U. S. resources in an effort
to entice people to join our camp; if they wanted to come in willingly
with their eyes open, he would welcome them but he felt it was time
for other nations to do some thinking on their own and to make their


13-00009

fa

own judgments without the need for U. S. persuasion in the form

of concrete financial and military aid. Accordingly, the President
intended to stay home and do his own heavy thinking as to just

how he can best promote peace -- if this led to trips, then he
would take trips. If people wanted to come to see him to talk

about peace or other matters, he would be delighted to receive
them but there must be something worthwhile to talk about and
something that will lead in the proper direction. He said that
during his lifetime the United States had been forced to fight two
wars because of Germany and that he was not going to allow any
situation.to develop which might lead in that direction again so long
as he was President. He said he would not be a party to any shilly-
shallying in that direction and that Germany must make up its own
mind and see which way they intend to go. If it were going to be
toward deGaulle, then say so. If it were going to be toward the
United States and its concept of a free world, then say so and prove
it by putting more effort into their actions in this regard -- more
effort in the way of more money and more support of United States
policies. He told Erhard that this was the way he felt and there
was no point in Erhard trying to play off deGaulle against President
Johnson nor to try to get Germany in the middle between those two
nations. The President said that Erhard apparently accepted this
frank talk and for the rest of the visit never once mentioned deGaulle.

6. The President then directed that Salinger acquire from
USIA and CIA a roundup of world reaction as to Erhard's visit. He
said that if we did not make any money on that deal, we might just
as well fold-up our tent insofar as influencing foreign visitors was
concerned because he, the President, had really put out and had
really talked turkey to Erhard -- which was the only way he, the
President, knew how to talk. He said that this administration was
being criticized for either having no foreign policy or a poor one
and that he therefore wanted as much publicity as possible on the
highly favorable aspects of the Erhard visit. (I subsequently had
a CIA report prepared and forwarded to Salinger on 1 January,
pointing out that it was an initial report and that a real reading on
Ambassadorial and Governmental reactions would be coming along


13-00000

ay ee

later since it takes more time to acquire these from somewhat
sensitive sources.

7. The President then went on to say that people seem to
have the impression he was going to sit back and try to keep things
on an even keel so as not to disturb the upcoming election. He
said that this was a wrong impression for people to have and that
he intended to do everything he possibly could to ensure maintaining
and augmenting the great forward momentum that President Kennedy
had been developing toward world peace and proper domestic
policies. He said that this was a time for real action and that the
United States must get itself out of this trend of thought that it sits
back and reacts to others' actions rather than creates actions of
its own. He is tired of reacting -- he wants to act and let others
react to him and this is one of the things he intends to think about
during upcoming months. He therefore urges the most imaginative
thinking possible both in and out of Government to see how best his
ends can be attained, He pointed out that this was not going to be
easy because this was an election year and lots of people would be
looking for ways to attack him and his policies. He said, however,
that he could not sit by and watch this opportunity for promoting
peace and understanding among nations to dissipate simply because
it was an election year in which he would be politically involved.

8. The President then said that he had been totally dis-
satisfied with what the State Department had proposed he send to
Khrushchev and he had therefore sat down at the desk (pointing) and
had in his own handwriting composed the New Year's message to
Khrushchev. He intended to continue to promote every possibility
for a basis of understanding looking toward peace and again reiterated
that any agreement would never be at the expense of our own security.

9. He then asked me for a briefing of any current situations
that he should be brought up to date on. I brought him up to date on
Cyprus, on Cuba, and on South Vietnam since he had indicated that
he had read recent Checklists.


13-00000

-5-

10, As to Cuba, he stated his dissatisfaction with our
present policies and actions connected therewith and said that
shortly after his return to Washington, and probably after the
State of the Union message, ‘he wanted a comprehensive review
of the Cuban situation and our policies and he wanted the most
imaginative and forward thinking people put to work on seeing
what else could be done, He did not feel the sabotage efforts
would ever really result in any ultimate goals for U. S. interests
but was prepared to accept some of them if they promote internal
dissidents and assisted the morale of the people we were working
with in Cuba. He stated he was not at all satisfied with the
Governmental actions taken thus far to curtail free world trade
with Cuba. He said he had told Erhard that he could not tolerate
West German trade with Cuba and that Erhard had assured him
that while it was very small, he would put a complete stop to it
as soon as he returned to Germany. The President directed that
thorough preparation be made so that when Pearson visits the
United States, Mr. Johnson can take him on in the same manner
and similar preparations should be made for other free world
countries doing appreciable business with Castro.

ll, There was then a discussion with Staats and Murphy
about some sort of pork barrel program which was to be canceled
and which Hubert Humphrey and Elvis Stahr had taken violent
exception to, Apparently the President had received a vitriolic
letter from Elvis Stahr about this matter because he commented
that he now understood why Stahr had made such an inadequate
Secretary of the Army. The lines of action directed by the
President as to preparation of responses was not a matter for CIA.

12, There was then a discussion as to some sort of adjust-
ment in tax procedures which, by reducing a figure from 15 to 14,
would save some $800 million this year. Neither Mike Forrestal
nor I heard this loud and clear but I think it had to do with adjusting
withholding tax deductions, In any event, no decision was reached
by the President and the conversation was directly with Staats and
not for the rest of the group.


13-00000

pier

13. The President then turned to Indonesia and stated that
he was faced with the necessity of making a decision as to whether
or not it was in the national interest to continue aid to Indonesia,
This decision had to be made by him in accordance with the foreign
aid bill just passed. He said he wanted in writing from Secretary
Rusk, Secretary McNamara, and Mr. McCone their recommendations
as to what his decision should be, He also wanted to get reactions
from Senator Russell and several other Congressional leaders. He
quoted a figure of $25 million which was involved. (Action: The
wheels are grinding in the Agency to come up with a pro and con and
consequences paper for the Director upon which he may make his
recommendation to the President, The figures are somewhat con-
fused and the actual amount appears to be in the neighborhood of
$60 million. Mike Forrestal has these figures pretty well tied down
and points out that the Presidential decision does not require any
action on PL 480 funds. )

14. The President then stated that he was totally dissatisfied
with the proposed program for alleviating poverty which apparently
suggested that he ask Congressional authorization for a lump sum
of money which he would administer through some sort of newly-
created poverty administration. He said he wouldn't touch it with
a ten-foot pole and that if he proposed anything like that on the Hill,
they would laugh him out of court and it would probably bring a
defeat in the Democratic party in the upcoming elections. He would
give absolutely no consideration to anything which could possibly
result in graft or pork barrel activities. Any program for the
relief of poverty must be designed to get right down to the grass
roots out where the poverty actually exists and must be handled by
existing Federal, State, and community organizations which are
geared in this direction. He mentioned specifically the possibility
of utilizing the Bureau of Public Roads and other similar Federal
and State organizations. He said that if roads are to be built, they
should be built into and out of poverty-stricken areas and to pro-
vide access to schools and hospitals and such human needs activities
and not, repeat not, for the improvement of major trunk lines and
highways. He thought perhaps the people who were receiving this


13-00000

-7-

type of aid could be utilized in the construction of these roads
where they would see the results of what they were doing and the
purpose of it. He stated that any attempt to organize a new
administrative entity to handle this matter would not even get

off the ground before the year was out and would merely result

in more Government people on the payroll and more bureaucracy.
He directed an immediate reappraisal of his program for the
relief of poverty and coming up with an entirely different concept
for his approval. Mr, Staats and Mr, Murphy indicated they would
follow through on this.

15, The foregoing covers all pertinent points to the best
of my recollection. I shall write a separate memorandum of the
tour President Johnson gave us of his ranch and with particular
attention to.the fact that he built and paid for every improvement
on the place out of his own pocket, including the runway, the run-
way lights, and the dam across the river.

2 June 1961

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Interview with Dave Morales, GS-14, Chief of CI Section,
Miami Base, 25 May 1961

1. Morales, who was born in Arizona of Indian and Spanish
parents and is bilingual in Spanish and English, former football
player, arrived in Miami in October 1960 after spending two years
eat the Havana Station. He appears to have done a unique CI Job
in organizing, within the Frente, the future intelligence service
for the new government of Cuba that the invasion force expected
to install. He also organized two other groups. He did this with
the help of a Chile: istructor that was supplied by headquarters,
and with’materials\training) that WH/k/cI Section, Mr. Simmons, |
sent down to him.

2. The principal group vere 39 selected, highly educated
Cubans, who were trained as case officers to form the future
intelligence service. They are known as the "AMOTS". After being
trained they were employed by Morales in doing a series of highly
important tasks for the good of the station. These were as
follows:

a. Penetration of the local anti-Castro organizations.

b. Penetration of the pro-Castro organization in Miami,
the so called 26th of July organization.

¢. Preparation of biographical information on all
prominent persons in the Frente.

d. Carding some 200,000 Cubans in the period of three
months.

e. A special section of the AMOTS monitored all radio
transmissions coming from Cuba. This amounted to eight stations
that were covered on a 24 hour a day basis.

n

f. Screging of all persons recruited for the grade 8-'y°*
(but this work first started in November 1960, and by that time 300
or 400 men had already gone to camp), This AMOT screening of the
military trainees really amounted to a field check since the
various cases were discussed with Cuban sources of information
present in Miami.



13-00000

&- Mail censorship. All mail coming from the military
camp in Guatemala was censored by this group before being released
for transmittal to Cuba.

h. Four of this’were sent back to Cuba with instructions
to report on CI targets; chiefly the secret service and the police.

3. The second group trained by Morales were 100 selected
Cubans who were given training as future CI officials and civil
government officials. Of the 100 thus trained, 61 were sent to
the camp in Guatemala for training with the brigade. They
accompanied the brigade on the invasion, and of the 61 only two
were lost, nine were caught and the rest got out, due to the
circumstance that most of them were on the steamer Lake Charles
which owing to the developments at the beaches did not land its
troops. These men were given the job of penetrating inland as
fast as possible with the troops and identifing and seizing records
and documents of the Castro government. Following that they were
to set up the temporary civilian government of Cuba. This group were

(4 known as the AMFATS. The members of this group were brought back
to Miami where they are now living privately. The third group were
the AMCHEERS, @ group of approximately 100 older, nonpolitical
individuals, who received training from Morales as a reserve in
intelligence personnel. Eighty of these had been trained by April
1961 for eventual legal return.

4. Morales stressed that POA's had been received on members of
all three groups and that the AMOTS received tradecraft training
far in excess of that received by the average Agency staff employee.

5. After the invasion the Frente leaders endeavor to change
the AMOTS‘into a political organization and remove the chief leaders
of the AMOT group. Such a development had been anticipated by the
base and prior to that action all files, the most valuable part of
the organization.had been microfilmed (see my interviews with
Simmonsfoa more details. on this protective maneuver). The chief
AMOTS who were thus removed by the Cuban leaders are still organized
under Morales as a shadow intelligence organization.

6. Personnel shortages. Morales accomplished all of the
foregoing with the aid of only two girls one a GS-9 analyst. He
tried in vain for more than three months to get a junior case officer
assigned, but in vain. This request was forwarded through Simmons,
the CI Chief in WH/4. Morales tried to get one or both of two JOLs
who were in Miami on TDY, but the JOT office refused to release them
ha on the ground that it would interfere with their training.
Morales feels that these young officers would have learned more in



13-00000

three months under him than they would learn in three years of formal
training. As a result of being so short handed, Morales had to work
about 14 hours a day, seven days a week. Otherwise, however, he
received excellent support generally, both fram Headquarters and the
other sections of Miami Base.

7. As for suggestions for better operation in the future,
Morales made two points. (a) the screening of military trainees

should start at a much earlier point than was done this time; (b)
more adequate number of personnel should be furnished.

MEMORANDUM FOR: THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Interview with Clark Simmons, Chief of WH/4's CI Section,
1 June 1961

(This memorandum should be read after Morales interview)

1. Simmons is a dedicated CI type having spent the last 11 years
chiefly on CI matters largely under OTR auspices. iO years
in Egypt, 1954 to 1956, setting up and training the Or Staff,
apparently starting from scratch. He has been with OIK since then and
came to WH/4 in mid-April 1960. He is about to be transferred to the
WH Division Staff andhis replacement will be Louis Napoli who will
head the new combined FI/CI Section of WH/4. He stressed that the
charter of the new combined section will give CI the right to interfere
in any operation. This will be spelled out explicitly, thus countering
the difficulties that Simmons had in dealing with the PM Section prior
to the invasion. Bob Andrews will stay on for CI matters.and Seehafer
will head the FI part, both under Napoli.

2. AMOTS (future Cuban intelligence service trained by Morales
at Miami). This idea started when Anderson of WH Division Staff told
Simmons that, he had a) CI officer who was available for training
Cubans. . Drawing on his experience, Simmons drew the AMOT plan
and prepared the training materials and sent them to Morales for
execution. It was Morales who subsequently conceived the idea of
training the AMFATS (future ait and the AMCHEERS, a reserve

intelligence corps consisting in. These matters are discussed
in detail in my memorandum on Morales. Morales also organized a group
of former Cuban diplomats presently in Miami to have them available
when a new government is set up. Subsequent to the invasion the AMOTS
have been substantially changed by Cardona. He has replaced the top
(OTS by political appointees who have no skill in tradecraft. The top
men thus fired had anticipated such a move, and, in addition to micro-
filming 120,000 cards, they removed all cryptonyms and all memoranda
of conversation between them and Morales with the result that the new
service doesn't know the identity of the AMOIS who are presently, ip,
Cuba. The AMOTS initially numbered 96. The Miami Base now has/f Ohre
22 of them of whom ra four are inside Cuba with 14 subsources; all of . .-
them producing FI and CI reports. By December 1960 the AMOIS had 4 (i il.
produced 1,800 intelligence reports and 750 radio monitor reports. i

3. In dealing with the Miami Base, Simmons stuck strictly to
the relationship between Headquarters and a foreign station. His
command channel was, of course, via Chief of WH/4 to the Chief of
Miami Base to Morales. He and Morales understood each other
perfectly and there was no sthker obstacle of any sort in their i¢
collaboration. There was no second-guessing or double case offering
in CI mtters.

4, Simmons and his section ran a number of CI ops directly
from Headquarters. He referred to the following:

a. A certain lady of easy virtue who had a vast acquaintance
among the top Castro people.

db. A who for eight years has worked for the
Agency as a-penetration in Communist maritime unions in various
countries.

c A Serteinake rf BEEeeeeEEeE|
who has been living in/’ ome of the chief of G-2. Unfortunately,

an expectedgCastro official appointment did not materialize and this
operation has not proved to be of much value.

da. A former U.S. negro citizen now in the Cuban service.

e. Juan Orta, former chief of Castro's executive office,
now out of office.

5. Simmons gave me the attached copies of four basic documents.
Tab A.- WH/4 counterintelligence plan, June 1960

Tab B - Counterintelligence plan for an FRD security service,
late August 1960 y be?
.
e
Tab C - CI program for future project, 20 April 1961 - ye leas

ae

ot

Tab D - Counterintelligence assets, 29 April 1961

In addition, Morales gave me a copy of a dispatch summarizing Miami's
CI assets currently in Guba, (Tab E).

6. ‘Relations with PM Section: Simmons' relations with the PM
section seem to have been marked with a considerable amount of friction,
perhaps more than always results from the resentment operators feel at
the inhibiting influence of the CI man. Thus whenever a PM agent was
lost, a CI man would analyse the files and draw a damage sheet showing
what the agent knew, etc. Simmons showed m a large file containing
about 50 of such cases. This work was made more difficult because the PM
people kept only very skimpy records. A CI representative, Rothwell,



13-00000

rahe 7 ee
also went over all incoming messages from agents to scrutinize for
the use of freedom signals.’ When the absence of such signalsws
pointed out to PM they would sometimes claim that the agent had pi
merely forgotten them. CI was able to stop all cable traffic to { ate
such agents when under suspicion. After a while Rothwell was one
delegated to be the CI contact with the PM people, and due to his ut
quiet methods and competence he gained a fair share of their
confidence and the work proceeded more smoothly.

LE

7. Simmons and his section prepared a 225-page study~of
Castro's intelligence organization. This document was distributed
generally throughout the U.S. intelligence community, as were also
some extensive studies on Cuban blockwardens. They also issued cs/
CI information reports and Simmons gave a number of briefings to
higher-ups. They were able to identify 14 provocative activities
by the Cuban: services in the U.S., Dakar and Havana. They identified
aU. S. employee of the U.S. Embassy in Havana as a Castro penetration _
agent in 1960. * This document contains the identities of 492 Castro G-2

_™ staff officers.

8. From September 1960 to January 1961 Simmons spent half of
his time working on the case of the three ST ESCALATE members, i.e.,
the audio and development team which was arrested in Cuba and is still
under arrest. If these men had checked in with the CI Branch before
departure they would have %&tvea not to go. Sinmons regards this
matter of the greatest potential danger to the Agency, e.g., if these

men should be sent to Moscow to be milked.

9. Simmons described the following difficulties he had had:

a. Hissection was not fully staffed until October 1960,

although he went to the greatest lengths to get additional people.
He first had a machine run made for a list of CI personnel having a

acre of Spanish. He checked the records of the individuals
thus disclosed. He sent the names thugselected to the wo/k

_~ . Personnel. officer who made a great effort, but in no case was he able

\ to get a man taken off his resent job. He feels that the DD/P
should in the are tell all his senior officers of the importance

_ of such a project so that the latter will cooperate when their

2 valuable/te requested. After borrowing Melberg fram covert training
for two TDY trips, Simmons could not face going to Marchand with a
further request, and instead asked Jack Earman in the DCI's office &
help him get Melberg for another trip. The Director of Training
complained of this irregular procedure. If Mr. Bissell had so
informed his senior officers, Simmons feels that they would have
recelved-better coopération. The ¥eault of lack of personnél vas that
they all worked six or seven days a week. Simmons knows of no case
of_a directed assignment to the project. As it was,he personfally
had to spend 80 per cent of his time on administrative matters with
the result that he could only spend 20 per centof his time on operations.
His final T/0 was four case officers, four analysts, two clerk-typists
and one secretary.



13-00000

b. Working space was also a great problem. From May
through September 1960 they were working seven or eight in a single
room. :

e.. Dr. chief of the JOIP refused to releas® two
JOTs whom Morales wanted as assistants in Miami. One of these is
named Ben Ramirez and is very fluent in Spanish.

10. For the future Simmons recommends:

a@. That an LCFLUITER operator be assigned to each base
Permanently, not. withstanding the expense. The need for such 6 man
(at times can'be very urgent.

b. There should be one cleared Staff D room containing
all relevant files so that the entire job can be done in one room.
This means all Staff D files involved, all operating cards, personality
and report cards, so that,for instance, a CI analyst can here and
do a complete job in perfect security. The Staff D yield was_a
"gold mine". ~

ce. If CI section had been told the time and place of the
invasion they could have checked their records on the area and the
adjacent areas and have given the brigade recommendations for
document seizing, etc. in the towns that would be passed through.

san 13
ll. Despite difficulties referred to above, Simmons feel that
the results of his section's work were very g and that one
indication of this is that the upper echelons of the Agency sent him
many matters for handling that were not strictly of a CI nature; for
instance, inquiries from the DCI, from Congress, etc.

12. In cases where the CI Section discovered that an agent
communicating by radio was not using hissafety signals, CI would help
the PM or other section to handle that agent in subsequent communica-
tions so that he would be kept alive. This sometimes required that
requests by the agent for supplies be complied with, In one case LUGLOG.
Simmons was intent on preserving the man so that he could be used at
the end for purposes of deception. The agent requested an air drop i
and it was decided to comply.’ Simmons said that Gen. Cabell disclosed
to the Cuban aircraft a crew that was to make the air drop that the 4
agent was a double agent. Accordingly the crew did not even go near
the drop, nor did PM Section advise Simmons until four days later that
this had occured. The result was that the man was immediately taken
off the air and Simmons had indications that he was shot. If Simmons
had been advised earlier of the failure to make the drop, he could
have tried by a suitable message to explain the omission.

COUNTERINTELLIGENCE PLAN FOR AN FRD SECURITY SERVICE
: TAB SBS

I. SAISSION

To select, assess, organize, train on-the-job and support FRD
personnel for a security service capable of protecting the FRD,
its personnel, installations, secrets and activities fran sabotage,
subversion and espionage.

TI, 3eFERENCES
A. Project Operational Plan
B. Project Political Action Plan
C, Project Counterintelligence Plan
D. Project Counterintelligence Budget for Fiscal Year 1961

IIT, QONCEPT OF OPERATION

It is essential that the Agenay create an aggressive service for
FRD-Project activities. Since there is no certainty that the leaders
of the FRD will achieve and hold responsible positions in a new
Goverment of Cuba, and since there is an everpresent threat that
political or operational flaps may destroy the FRD as an effective
Project instrument, it is essential that the Agency's role in creating
an FRD security service be carried out under cover of the BENDER-CARR
group. It is also essential that the leaders as well as rank and file
menbers of the FRD pay more than lip service to the requirements of
an effective security apparatus, even though these requirenents dictate
a need for major changes in the modus operandi of individual menbers.
To this end the BENDER-CARR group must direct the FRD to accept, in
return for its support, controls and limitations which must be imposed
by the security service if operational security is to be achieved.

The Agency's objectives in establishing and supporting a security
service for the FRD aret

A. To protect its operational interests in the FRD; and

B. To acquire counterintelligence information through participation
in FRD operational security activities.

The security service of the FRD will have as its objectives:
A. Screening all personnel holding significant FRD positions;

B. Screening new adherents to the FRD;


13-00000

C. Maintaining pertinent file information on FRD personnels

D. Maintaining physical security of FRD installations;

E. Staffing FRD debriefing centers;

F. Enforcing personnel security regulations;

G. Indootrinating FRD members on personal security;

H. Monitoring malcontents; and

I. Aoquiring both positive and counterintelligence information.

To build a security service for the FRD capable of attaining Agency
and FRD objectives, it is necessary for the Agenay!

A. To supervise the selection, assessment and training of
eight candidates;

B. To identify end select secure office sites in Miami, New York,
Washington and Mexico City, and to procure a secure safehouse
training site in Miami; -

C. To create an organization which can fulfill assigned security
functions.

D. To supervise the training of thirty-two additional candidates
to staff the organization;

E. To support the organization through the BENDER-CARR group by
providing, sanitised record data, special training, financial
backing,: and, at need, operational facilities; and

F. To supervise through the BENDER-CARR group the organization's
day-to-day activities.

To implenent the plan for an FRD security service, BENLER-CARR repre-
sentatives in Mexico City, Miami, Washington and New York will be
briefed on the plan for an FRD security service. The Chief, FRD/Intel-
ligence and Security Subcommittee, will be directed by BENDER to select
seven officers to be processed for jobs with the service. Processing
will include medical examination, polygraph, and psychological assesment
of the candidates. They will later be briefed on the objectives and
functions of the security service by a representative of the BENLER-CARR
group. They will be trained on-the-job by a Chilean ex-police officer
who will be recommended to the FRI by the BENLER-CARR group. The
training will cover subjects pertinent to the service's day-to—day

security responsibilities as spelled out in the organizational plen.
The FRU security casponents in Mexico City, Washington and New York
will be initially assigned one officer each from the first group of
eight candidates. ‘The remaining five candidates will. be assigned to
Miami. Of those candidates subsequently trained for the security
service, two additional men will be assigned to Washington; six to
New York; six to Mexico City; and eighteen to Miami.

OFGANIZATION

The organisational structure of the FRD security service and of the
Agency's related support structure are outlined in Attachment "A";
the facilities and personnel required to staff and support these
structures are discussed below:

A. Faotlitien

1. Seourity office sites in Mexico City, Miami, Washington
and New York. (These will be selected by the Office of
Security; the Office of Security will identify these
sites to the BENDER-CARR group, which in turn will direct

their use by appropriate FRD components.)

2. A training site will be selected in Miami by the Office of
Seourity and identified to the BENDER-CARR group, which
in turn will recamend it to the Chief, FRD/Intelligence
and Security Subcommittee.

3. One four-drawer safe will be acquired by the Office of
etic ty for use in each office site in the above-named
cities.

4. Appropriate office supplies will be assembled by the FRD
component in each site.

B. Foreien Personne)

1. A Chilean police officer has been selected and recruited
as training officer for the security service. The bENVER-

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Central Intelligence
THROUGH: Deputy. Director (Plans) py
SUBJECT: Juana (Juanita) CASTRO Ruz

1, ACTION: None, This memorandum is for your informa-
tion,

2. In connection with Task Force W efforts to split the
Cuban leadership,. some time ago we targeted Juana Castro Ruz,
half-sister of Fidel and: Raul Castro Ruz. A number of reports
have been received indicating that Juana Castro Ruz opposed
the strong communist nature of the Cuban regime and was
prepared, at least to some extent, to cooperate with anti-
regime elements, In May 1962 we reestablished contact with and
recruited Mrs. Virginia Leitao De Cunha, Cuban born wife of
the Brazilian ambassador to the USSR and a long time personal
friend of Juana Castro Ruz.

3. On 11 June 1962, on-our instructions, Madame De Cunha
proceeded to Havana where she maintained frequent contact
with Juana Castro Ruz and other prominent Cuban leaders until
1 July 1962. She discussed. the current regime quite frankly
with Juana Castro Ruz and, according to Madame De Cunha, she
obtained Juana’s agreement to provide intelligence on the
Cuban political leadership and to work against the Cuban
communist regime, short of engaging in activity which might
result in direct personal harm to her brothers Raul and Fidel,
According to.Madame De Cunha, Juana has agreed to proceed to
Mexico or the United States in this connection and return to
Cuba after discussions with “the Americans”

4. We are making the necessary arrangements with
Madame De Cunha to have Juana Castro Ruz proceed to Mexico as
soon as possible in order that we may attempt a direct re-
cruitment, You will be kept advised of any future develop-

ments of importance in this case,
