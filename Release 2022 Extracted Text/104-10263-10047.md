Visit of Cuben Bille Victor Espinosa

In accordance with our conversation yesterday I have set

A Venezuelan Christian Democratic friend of uine, Valmore

Acovado, called ne frch Mey York City jeaterday noming lù aak

When I expressed mild

akepticiss, Acevedo urgently repeated his request and I agreed.

Within a surprisingly short time the Cuban, Victor Espinosa,

arrived at my office (he sald he had taken

the plane Innedt-

statements follows.

in Spain (which Espinosa entered 1llegally), Espinosa was In-

formed that there is a plan to overthrow the Castro regime

and to kill Castro and some of his main leaders.

The plot 1s

ied by Cubelad and some of the March 13 Movement, plus (I be-

1leve) some military officers.

They must move very quickly

because more and more people are learning of the plot and

there is growing risk of exposure. They are anxious to have

sowe coordination, or at least con iltation, wich responsible

Auericans.

They are not confident that they could win an all-

out fight against the Castro forces, and are thinking more in

torms of taking contrul for a short time (perhaps only a few

hours), kliling Castro and his nost effective men (tius

ruining the Castro novement forever), and then trying to hold

out for sa lung as feasible.

It is essential that they know

want, if anything, the Americans might do to help, now and/or

later, when the coup 1s attempted.

Also, they wished to alert

the United States Government to what was being planned.

The Cubans night have turned to Earl Williamson, the SIA

man in Madrid. However, they belleve Williamson is completely

mireliable. A Cuban girl was sent to Madrid some time ago by

the Castro people. (Williamaon was fooled by her and, being

When the proper moment came, four months ago, she

flew back

to Havana with some very useful files.

but Espinosa has had to keep putting them off. Meanwhile,

the Cuban who was walting in Spain for the anawer has had

Espinosa keeps waiting to hear whether the Americans

will play ball with the Cubelad group. The plot has lasted

¡or ovar. l8 months, and the plottera plan to go

waiting, I returned and told him at some length that of course

this was not the sort of thing we got into.

However, I added

that I would see to it that someone called him. I further

said that, unofficially, I had enjoyed talking with him.

Espinoss seemed somewhat mollifled and temporarily :.reassurad

by this. However, I doubt very much that he will wait longer

than suo or three days more before making another attempt to

bring this situation to a hoad.
