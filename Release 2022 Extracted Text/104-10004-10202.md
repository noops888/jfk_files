We Discover Lee OSWALD in Mexico City

CIA a4@ produce sne very aignificant piece of information on Lee
OSWALD before he shot President Kennedy. On 1 October 1963, our Mexico
City Station intercepted a telephone call Lee OSWALD sade from someplace
in Mexico City to the Soviet Eubassy thera, using his own name. Speaking
broken Russian and using his true nase, OSWALD was talking to the Eubasay

guard, OBYEDKOV, who often answers the phone. OSWALD sai@ he had visited

_ the Embassy the previous Saturday (28 September 1963) and epoken to a

connal waase name be lek Zorgottwa, aad who had yrowtoed So cel # “ele:

new." The guard said if the consul wes dark it vas (Valeriy Viedmtrovich)
KOSTIQCV. ‘The guaré checked with someone else and said that the message
had gone out but no anewer bad been received. He then hung up.

This piece of information was produced from a telephone tap center

which we operate jointly with the office of the President of Mexico. It

is highly secret and not known to Mexican security and law enforcement
officials, who have their ow center. Our joint center produces great

maases Of telephone intercepts which are transerxibed and reviewed by cur

e@all staff in Mexico City. By 9 October, the OSWALD telephone converas-
tion ef 1 Getober had been trenscribed and a summary of it cabled to
Washington. ‘The name Lee OSWALD meant nothing special to our Mexico

City Station, but in their report thay did judge bin te be an American

male.

The cabled report was received in Washington on 9 October and checked

the Soviet Embassy in Nexice City was probably the Lee OSWALD whe had
defected to the Soviet Union in 1959 end retwmed to the USA in 1962. On

10 Octeber 1963, the day after the report from Mexico City, CIA Headquarters
seat out a cabled report about Lee OSWALD's phone call to the Soviet

Embasay; the report went to the PBI, the Departmant of State (because e

i

OSWALD was a US citizen), and to the Navy Departwent (because he was a

o

former Marine.) ‘The cabled report to these egencies hizhlighted the |
|


13-00000

1skJshood that the Lee OSHALD mentioned was probably the forser defector.
A copy of this came cable was delivered by hand to the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, with vhich we bave no cable Link, ‘the same day

a leng cable went out to Mexico City infonaing our Station of the back-
ground of defector Lee OSHALD and asking for more information. Our Station
was instructed to pass ite information on the phone call to the Mexico
City effines of the FAI, the Exbassy, the Raval Attache, and the Imuigra-
tion and Keturaligation Service. This vas done.

In its ariginal report of 9 October, Mexico City had seid it had a

1 October 1963, the Gay OSHALD phone there. A vary sensitive operation
in Mexico City provides us with secretly taken photographs of many but not
all visiters te the Soviet Babassy there, taken with telephoto lenses.
Accordingly, ve cabled the Navy Departuent on 24 October 1963 asking for
@ photograph of Lee OSWALD fras his Marine Corps days so we could coupare :

photos. We head not received this photograph by 22 November 1963, but in

any event, it turned out that the man photographed outside the Soviet

SECRET


Eubessy was not OSWALD anyway. As chance woulé have it, none of our
several photo obsemation points in Mexico City had ever taken em identi-
fiable picture of Lee OSWALD.

Our Mexico City Station very often produces information like thia
on US citizens contacting BScviet bloc embaseies in Mexico City. Frequently
the information we get is extremely incriminating, and on ome or two
eceations we have even been able to apprehend and return to the USA
American military personnel who are attempting to defect. In all such

cases, our Headquarters deak requests end obteins the special permission of

“the Deputy Director for Plans to pass the Geseaktory tufcrastion:en we US nyse

citizen to other government egencies. Derogatory information on Avericans
is not treated routinely; in each cese the DDP or his Assistant personally
serutinise the information, make sure it is credible, and decide whether and
to vbom it will be passed. Only in absolute emergencies is the Mexico City
Station authorized to pass auch information directly to the FBI office in e
the U.3, Bmbassy.

At this writing (13 December 1953) we do not know what action the PBI



13-00000

and other agencies may have taken based on our report. We surmise thet the

FRI may have made locel checks through Mextean sutherities te see if

Lee OSWALD wus actualy in Mexico City on 1 October. Indeed, later in-

vestigation has confirsed all the details of his trip, where he stayed,

end whet he did. To avoid crogsing Lines with the FBI, our Mexico Station

underteck ne local investigation of its own. As ve now know, OSWALD left

Meaieo on 3 October and was no Longer there when our report was put out.

Since thie telephone tap operation is a joint ons with the Mexican

Presidency, the Mexicans alec had the 1 Octeber intercept on Lee OSWALD,

22 Hovenber 1:
When word of the shooting of President Kennedy reached the offices
of our operating divisions and staffs on the afternoon of Friday 22 Hoven-
ver 1963, transistor radios were turned on everywhere to follow the a
tragedy. When the name of Lee OSWALD was beard, the effect was electric.

A phone meseage from the FBI came at about the same time, naming OSWALD


13-00000

as the possible essasein ané asking for traces. The message wes passed
on at onoe by the Chief CI, Mr. Angleton, te Mr. Birch O'Neal of bis
Special Investigations Unit. Mrs. Betty Egeter of this Unit immediately
recognized the nate of Les OSHALD and went for his file. At tke same
time, Mee. Bustos of the Mexteo Desk, who bad written our first feport on
OSWALD on 10 Ootober recognized the nane frou redie reports end vent
after the som file. Mr. Reichhardt, Mexico Desk Chief, who was home on
leave, heard the news and phoned in 9 reminder thst we hed something on

OSWALD, While we were preparing a cable to Mexico City asicing then for

Voice of Amrica broateast and esbled te us a reminder ef the information

13-00000

our overseas stations, and many pieces of information ou OSWALD and his
wife had been received back. ‘The Mexico City Station researched its

“a telephone taps very thoroughly ané came up with several more convereations
probably involving OSWALD, but not actually mentioning this memes these
couneeted him alse to the Cuban Consulate in Mexico City. Several Mexicans
were arrested and questioned about his activities, civing a good picture
of what he was really up to. Many conferences were held with the FRI
liaison officer who asked us for certain actions and passed us infermetion
from the FRI investigation. Oucthe minus side, a host of fabrieaters,

most of which we investignted, Ail of these ere soon discredited, but they
are still coming in.

During this phase of our work, ve served primarily in support of the
FAL, which wae entrusted by the President with thea major reaponsibility for
the investigation. The FBI was too busy to supply us with much of its 8
own information, but annvers were given te specific questions we posed to

aseist our investigation. The Departuent of State did photograph ite entire

Since the operation through which we tep the Soviet Rubassy phones

Soviet Conmlar officials spoke of him ac a men with “no frimés in Cuba™

secret role. His trip to Mexico was net itself secret actz he traveled

hotels, and coxresponied with the Soviets through the open mailG about

in Mexice City arises from the Liklikcod thet he met vith Soviet Consul
Velerfy Viadisirovich KOSTIMOV. In his 1 Gcteber phone call to the
Soviet Eabassy, the guard OBYEDKOY suggests that the Consul OSWALD had
talked ta was KOSTIKOV if he was dark. OGWALD seems to agree with this,

but the identification is very casual. In his 9 November letter te the

ep ee REN See

Consulate in Waskingten, OSWALD gives the name of the man be dealt

with ac “KOSTIN,” but there is no persen of that exact name in the Soviet
Babassy in Mexico City. KOSTIKOY is accredited as a Consular Attache end
doen actually do a lot of consular work, but be is believed te be a
Soviet KGS officer, and it is believed thet he works fer Department 13 of
the KCB, the Department charged with sabotage and assassinations. ‘the
suspicion that KOSTIKOY is a KGB officer arese from his work habits, and

hie association with other KGB officers. It wes haréened when it was

found that he handled a Soviet agent vho was trained to do sabotage
work ond that he turned this agent over to another KGB officer who is
definitely known te vor for the 13th Department. It is generally true
in KGB work that sabotage agents are handled only by 13"Departuent
officers.

Exbassy qusra Ivan Ivanovich OBYEDKOY is himself believed to be a
EGB aan fron previous assignuente as a bodyguard and surefllent. But
unless seme direct evidence of Soviet complicity 1s discovered, it is

most Likely thet OOWALD's dealing with KOR men OBYEDKOV end KOSTIKOY was

Seviet habit of placing intelligence men in the Embassies in positions
where they receive a large portion of the visitors and phone calle. All
Of the five consular officers in the Seviet Enhessy are know or suspected
intelligence officers. Certainly if GSWALD had been a Soviet agent in Hy
training for an assassination assignment or even for sabotage work, the s
Seviets would have stopped him from making open visits and phone calls to

the Soviet Enbassy in Mexico after ke tried it a couple of times. Our


13-00000

experience in Mexico, studying the Soviet intelligence service at elese

Yange, indicates that they do make soue mistakes and are sometimes insecure

a in their methods, but that they do not persist in such glaring errors.

Some insight on the Cuban attitude toward the arrest of Silvie DURAN

and the involvement of the Cuban Consulate in the OSWALD case can be
gained from tue intercepted phone calls made between Cuban President
Osvalde DORTICOS and Cuban Ambassador to Mexico Joaqtin HERNANORZ Armas oa
26 “Hoveaber 1963, the day efter Silvia DURAN was released frum her first

arrest. At 09:0 AM that morning, President DORTICOS phoned the Anbassader

Anmhasester had cent in on the arrest of Silvia DURAH and the Lee OSWALD
case. The whole conversation is consistent with the theory that OSWALD
werely wanted a visa. ‘The Ambassador did mention the altercation which
OSMALD had with Consul AZCIR, and he says that Mexican police bruised
Silvia DUPAN's eras a little shaking ber to impress her vith the importance <°
of their questions. They he@ asked her if she bad been intimate with

OSWALD and she had denied it. President DORTICOS twice asked Ambassador



SECRET i

ERHAMDEZ whether the Mextoan police bad asked Silvia, DURAN questious
about “money,” and the President apparently wanted te knov viether the
Mexieans thought the Cubans bad paié OSWALD money. HERNANIES inststed
the Mexicans had not offered Silvia DUFAN may, and DORTICOS gave
wg ‘trying to put across his point. President DORTICOS instructed
RERRANDEZ to keep on questicaing Silvis DURAN end to phene hin beck.

At 7:39 PM that evening Aubasssder HERRANOEZ did call President
DORTICOS back, saying he bad questioned “that person” agaiu and she has

nothing now te add. President DORTICOS returns to the issue of whether

Consulate hed given money to the mané"that American.” But Aubassager
HERNANDEZ peraists in misunderstanding DORTICOS, ensues in the negative,
ané sayst “Abselutely nothing was given te her.“ DORTICOS seems to give
up, end the conversation éfes out after a few more sensral. renarks.

We de not know for sure sat unde President DOBTICOS press for informe
tion about Cuben money passed te OSWALD, but ruzors were current in Mexico

and even, we understand, in the USA, that OSWALD had returned from Mexico
rane

Ghty with about $5,000. Perhaps DORTICOS was trying te learn whether
the Mextoan police believed that the Cubans knd financed OSWALD. In any
i event, the Catan Goverment sent the Mexicans a stiff note of protest
over the arrest and detention of Silvia DUBAH, but the Mexicans

rejected the uote.
