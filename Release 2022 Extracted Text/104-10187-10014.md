MEMORANDUM FOR: Associate Deputy Director for Operations

THROUGH: | MPS/BG
SUBJECT: Amondnent and Termination of Project
KDFACTOR

1. Project KDFACTOR supported a visual and photo-
graphic surveillance operation in Mexico City targetted
against the Soviet Embassy. Assets included five agents
and two baschouse surveillance sites. Termination of
this project, effective 30 June 1972, was the result of
a security review which revealed that the VWBLANKET
principal knew the basic details of Lhe KDFACTOR opera-

tions.

- 2. Agent termination was accomplished without any
immédiate difficulties; however, continued security will
depend on the terminated agents’ silence. In the event
there 1s a compromise, the risk of damage to the Sta-
tion's relations with the Mexican Government should be
minimized because of tho compatible nature of KDFACTOR's

operations.

3. The ADDO approved Amendment No. 1 to the proj-
ect in the amount of $9,844 for FY 1972 to provide for
the agent terminations, but an overrun of $7,246 oc-
curred as the result of miscalculation of termination
costs. This project action requests this additional
sum of $7,246 to cover these expenses.

4. The FI Staff recommends approval of this aoene

ment/termination request.

‘MEMORANDUN FOR: Associate Deputy Director
For Operations

SUBJECT : “Project KDFACTOR - Amendment
and Termination Request. ~

1. The KDFACTOR Project (until 1970 encrypted
as the LIEMPTY Project) was initially approved in
1958 to provide financial and material support for
visual and photographic surveillance operations
targetted against the Soviet Embassy in Mexico
City. In June 1972 the project supported five
agents and two basehouse surveillance sites,

2, The KDFACTOR Project was approved by the
Abpo in the amount of $19,000 for FY - 72 and
$20,000 fer FY - 73, Per DIRECTOR 285255, dated
30 June 1972, the ADDO approved Amendment '0. 1
to the KDFACTOR Project in the amount of $9,844
for FY + 72 to provide for costs of agent
terminations,

. The decision to terminate all agents and
facilities under the KDFACTOR Project was based
on a security review of the project activities
which indicated that the VWBLANKET principal knew
the basic details of the KDFACTOR operations,
including the target, the location of the surveillance
sites, and probably the true names and former
cryptonyms of the agents covered by the project.

4, The cost of terminating the agents under the
KDFACTOR Project amounted to $15,573; the cost of
closing down, the two basehouses under the project
was $1,412, The total amount charged to the KDFACTOR
Project in FY 72 was $36,090 which is $7,246 over
the approved authorization of $28,844. The overage
was incurred in terminating the agents and
facilities associated with the KDFACTOR Project.
Although Anendment No. 1 to the project was
approved in the amount of $9,844 to cover the
cost of terminating the agents in the

Froject, the actual payments made by Mexico City
Station per the ‘terms of cach Memorandum -of Oral
Commitment (MOC) and in accordance with Mexican

law and custom exceeded the estimate for termination
costs made by Headquarters at the time the Amendment
was requested, Termination payments made to each
agent aré as follows:

KDFACTOR-2 (Recruited 1956) $8,160

KDFACTOR-S (Recruited 1956) 2,366
KDFACTOR-6 (Recruited 1956) 2,830
KDFACTOR-8 (Recruited 1965) 649
KDFACTOR-9 (Recruited 1966) 1,568

The long tenure of three of the terminated
agents, the relatively high monthly salary of
KBFACTOR-2 ($440) plus the computation of the
termination payments in accordance with Mexican
law and custom were the primary reasons that the
final agent termination costs amounted to $15,573.

S. All agent terminations were accomplished
in an amicable manner. No visible security risks
were apparent at the time of the terminations
although any one, or all, of the terminated agents
may at some future date decide to divulge to an
interested party the details of the KDFACTOR Project
operations. KDFACTOR-2, KDFACTOR-S, and KDFACTOR-6
have worked in photo surveillance operations for
the Station since 1956 and, therefore, obviously
have considerable knowledge of targets, former
safesites, personnel, and modus operandi of the
Station, ‘However, since the KDFACTOR Project was
not concerned with incompatible operations or
targets, we believe the risks of damage to Station
relations with the Mexican Government in the event
of exposure of the KDFACTOR Project operations by a
terminated agent are within acceptable limits.

6. It is requested that the KDFACTOR Project
be amended to provide the sum of $7,246 for FY -
72 to cover the costs of terminating five agents
and two basehouse surveillance sites under this

: MEMORANDUM FOR: Assistant Deputy Director for Plans

THROUGH: MPS/BG
SUBJECT: Renewal of Project KDFACTOR
i in 1972 for $19,000

in 1973 for $20,000

1. This project covers photo and visual surveillance
of the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City. One observation
post covers the front gate of the building,and another
covers the rear gate and walled compound. Five salaried
agents man the sites. four in front and one in back, An
official cover case officer collects the take (rolls of
film and logs of visitors) once a week by car meetings
with the OP keepers. The films are developed and printed
inside the Station.

2, The production from this operation has consis~
tently been rated-high by the Bureau (which is the prin-
cipal customer in the field), by other Government agencies
and by SB Division. Photosurveillance of a Soviet Embassy
might not bea high priority target in some countries.
But the fact that the Soviet Embassy in Mexico is a large
and active one and the fact that its primary target is
operations against the United States make our effort
important and valuable. This is the operation that pro- This mH
duced the photographs of Lee Harvey Oswald visiting the ervor 5
Soviet Embassy in 1962. ;

3, This seemingly straightforward operation has not D/EG,
always been so uncomplicated. Both sites have been in 19 Apil7y
operation and served by the same OP keepers for more than
a dozen years, At one of the sites the OP keeper's wife
and children take turns manning the equipment. A now~

: : : terminated principal agent was divorced several years
if “ago from-a wife who knew a lot about the operation. Some
desk officers believe that the medical doctor who for
years was supposed to be developing the films was simply
too busy to do so and that the work was probably done by
his uncleared secretary. Family relationships keep
cropping up among supposedly compartmented agents. All
of this is in the files but not in any one place. We i



* , believe it is time for the Station to make an updated
j security review of the operation with particular attention
to the knowledgeability of terminated agents and their
families. We also believe that the Station should now
address itself to the contingency that the present sites
or personnel will be blown and to investigate alternative
means of continuing their valuable coverage.

4. The ADDP last approved this project in May 1970
with the condition that termination payments to the
principal agent and his divorced wife be made on a
monthly basis. This condition has been met.

5. The budgets requested for the next two years are
simple and straightforward. Salaries and the traditional
bonuses for the five paid agents come to about $13,000,
Rent and utilities on the two observation posts come to
$5,600. The small balance is for operational expenses,
This project-action also requests amendment of the FY
1971 budget by $4,260 to cover that part of the cost of

< termination bonuses ‘to the principal agent and his di-
vorced wife which could not be absorbed by the project.
The total of the termination bonuses was $12,500.

6. This is a valuable and productive project which
helps fulfill a Priority A-1 Station requirement. The

FI Staff recommends approval.

Changes:

1. The processing of photographs obtained through this
project now is performed inside the Station. KDFACYOR-1, who
formerly processed the take in an outside safehouse, was
terminated amicably in early March 1971. Security and effi-
ciency have been increased by this change. ~ KDFACTOR-7 was
terminated in 1970, but the termination payments were made
during FY 1971 causing an increase in that years obligations.

2. Howard T. BAGAUS handled the administration of this
: project to early April 1971 when project responsibility
reverted from the Operations Support Section to the REDTOP
Section. At that time Timothy H. ARCHBOLD assumed the inside
administrative supervision, and agent meetings were turned
over to the outside case officer Bruce H, FERNALD, When
H ARCHBOLD departed PCS on 7 June 1971, Oliver J. MANKUNAS
assumed responsibility for this project, including agent

! meetings.

Accomplishments:

1, This project has provided continuous daily photo-
graphic and visual coverage of personnel and vehicles entering
or leaving the Soviet Embassy. A total of 530 rolls of film
were produced during the reporting period. U.S. citizens,
visitors, and TDY personnel are given special attention. Iden-
tifications of license plates and automobile descriptions as

fae well as drivers and their companions are identified under this
project. Additionally, attendance sheets are maintained to
establish who is at the Embassy on any given day and hour.



SECRET “2.

These photographs. and teports have contributed operational
support to the Station's Soviet operations which is not
attainable elsewhere. For example, whenever the Soviets
change all their license numbers the Station is able to
compile a new, complete roster within a matter of (reeks.

Costs:

1. General: $19,000 is requested for FY 1972 and
ee $20,000 is requested for FY 1973. It is also requested
that the Project be amended for FY 1971 in the amount of
$4,260 ‘to provide for the termination of mba and

Purpose: 3

: Project, LIEMPTY supports a visual and photographic
Surveillance of the Soviet’ Embassy in Mexico City. The

Aim is to identify and cover the movezeats of porsons
entering and leaving the Embassy, including Soviets and
visitors. Tho intelligenco collected through such activity
contributes tothe Station's overall Soviet operations
program, mainly in support of Priority A-1, but to sore
extent, Priority A-4, of the Operating Directive for Mexico.

Description:
1, The Project operates through two fixed basehouse

surveillance posts, a small photographic laboratory, a

principal-agent, and six sub-agents, A team of four sub-

‘agents, opérating from a basehouse, maintains yisual and

1 Photographic surveillance of the Soviet Embassy front

yey “entrance, One sub-agent, operating from a second base~

Hl house, covers an, area in back of the Enbassy, where Soviet

: ‘officials meet, play-and work. These units photograph all

j Persons moving in or out of the specific target areas, They

also maintain logs and provide writtea reports on observed

activity. All of this material is passed to the principal

agent, who passes the film to another sub-agent for process-

ing at a laboratory equipped for that purpose. After the

film is processed and pyinted, the prizcipal agent passes

j the finished product, plus written resorts and logs, to the

Station case officer. A brief description of each unit,
each agent and his role in the operation follows,

Beil os! 2." LILYRIC , (MEXI-132) is a basehouse located near

; of the Soviet Embassy. This‘ house has boon in

operation.since. October 1966. It is rented through : : :
LIMOUSINE (201-5762), a. cleared American ‘businessman. =.He

“ds ‘the ostensible owner of record and, as the landlord,

collects rent from. the tenants and then passes it to the

Station case officer, LIEMPTY-13 and -his family (seo

Paragraph. 3 beTow) live in the°LILYRIC houso and conduct

their survoillance operation from.it during daylight hourd

(ogoo 1800).

LIEMPTY-13'(201-119961) is the koy.member of the

LILYRIC basehousé team. He maintains contact with tho

“principal ‘agent_and does some photographic work. “Howover,-

because LIEMPTY-13 is employed outside as an industrial

ae ; enginéor, -hé.is unablo to spend much time operating the

Bae pee : sLILYRIC photographic”equipmont, and most of this work 18
a done by “his wife, LIEMPTY-14, and their sons, LIEMPTY-26

and LIEMPTY-27 (soe paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 bolow).

sey 4. LIEMPTY-14 (201-167567) is the main photographor
and obsorver at: the LILYRIC baschouse. She works closely
‘with her husband, LIEMPTY-13, in running the operation,
including the: preparation of ‘observation roports and logs.
She..also doos"'the. LILYRIC housekeeping, as any housowife

would do.

“$2 LIEMPTY-26 (201-762111), the son of LIEMPTY-13 and
LIEMPTY-14, has been a’-student. at the Mexican Technological
Institute. ‘In‘his. spare time he operates tho LILYRIC photo-
-graphic equipmént, and-helps LIENPTY-14 in maintaining the
arrival and departure logs of. target personalitios.

6. LIEMPTY+27 (201-762112), another son of LIEMPTY-13

and LIEMPTY-14, has. been a ‘prep school student. Ho gssists
i in operating the °LILYRIC photographic equipment and tran-
= scribes notes into” a‘finished typewritten log of ovents.

7. LIGALLA (MEXI-03) 4s a baschouse located behind
‘the Soviet. ‘Embassy. It has been in operation since 1957.
The ‘building, a four-unit affair, collectively known as
ALIMUST, is Agency owned, It was purchased through '
LIMOUSINE in Scptember 1957, and the property is in his
name. The LICALLA site is occupied by LIEMPTY-9 (see
: paragraph § below) and he runs the surveillance operation

from it.



18. LIEMPTY=9 (201+136454) is the only agent operating
from the sLICALLA ‘site, He does all the photography, main-
tains logs and prepares: observation reports, He also main- :

tains’ ‘contact with the principal agent. . LIENPTY-9 is a,” meet

part-tike insurance ‘salesman and is self-employed in the
accounting business which he conducts at the LICALLA site.

9.' “Raymond. H. GEREND§ (201-119523) has been the
principal agent for this project. He. is a Mexican national
“contract agent who is sclf-employed’as an English teacher
and.also works asa salesman for a light bulb manufacturer.
GERENDE has been’ mainly responsible for maintaining contact
with’ the LIEMPTY agents, passing instructions to them, and
collecting the product for passing to the Station case
officer. “He has“also paid them and handicd all other
administrative matters. He is being terminated by the end
f FY 1970 for security reasons (sce Problems, paragraph 1).

i0.. Bruce H, FERNALD (P) (201-008189) replaced
GERENDE (sce paragraph 9 above) us the project's principal
agent in early December 1969, FERNALD, a U.S. citizen born
in’ June 1915, operates under non-official cover as a retired
iimigrant. Ne is responsible for maintaining contact with
the LEEMPTY agents and collecting the product for passing
to. the, Station’ease officer. Ne algo handles administrative
“matters, including agent Salary payments. FERNALD is
financially covered under Project AENAGNIFY, :

11, The LIEMPTY photographic laboratory (NEXI-137) is
locited in a room ‘at GERENDE's residence. It is equipped
to process the photographs taken by the LIEMPTY surveillance
units. The work is done by LIEMPTY-4, (Sec paragraph 12
below). Since GERENDE Will be terminated by the end: of.

FY 1970, the Station is taking steps to establish a new
LIENPTY photographic laboratory at a new safesite.

_..,, 126 LIEMPTY-4 (201-117967) processes all the photo-
graphic film taken by’ the LIEMPTY photographers and makes
the number of prints required, He does this work at! night

1. The LIENTRAP. wobiie untt, consisting of LIEMPTY-10
and -LIEMPTY-11, is being removed from Project LIEMPTY and
placed.under Project LIEMBRACE, which supports a unilateral
physical surveillance team, Thc purpose of this change is
to.increase the size of the LIEMBRACE team in order to meet

«growing. demand. for operational surveillance support from
the various Station operating sections. The transfer will

- become effective at the beginning of FY 1971 and both
FY 1971. project budgets ~have been adjusted to cover financial

“aspects. of the change,

: 2. Raymond H, GERENDE was removed as the LIEMPTY
aa ore principal agent in early December 1969 owing to a security
: problem (see Problems, paragraph 1). He was replaced on
9.December 1965 by Bruce HH. FERNALD, a career agent oper-
ating. under cover as a retired immigrant, The chang> has
caused some delay in the. receipt of photographs because
FERNALD ig unable to meet LIEMPTY agents as frequently as
GERENDE had'met them, but operational effectiveness is not
significantly reduced by this delay, The key issue is that
security and reliability of the principal agent have improved

‘ considerably,

Accomplishments?

1. Project. LIEMPTY has provided continuous daily
photographic--and visual coverage (Monday through Saturday)
of the tront entrance and rear areas of the Soviet Embassy
in Mexico City, All Soviet personnel and their visitors
entering or leaving the Embassy have. been-photographed. In
addition, visual surveillance reports were prepared when
i appropriate, These photographs and reports have contributed
: essential operational support .to the Station's Soviet oper-

ations program,

2. Recently, LIEMPTY photographs were exclusively used
to produce an updated mugbook on Sovict officials in Mexico.
The book has been loaned to the FBI, AF/OSI and the 902nd
Military Intelligence Group for uperational use in debriefing
their agents engaged in dangle operations and double agent
‘operations against the Soviet services in Mexico City, One
902nd ‘controlled agent was identified from an LIEMPTY photo-
graph taken when the agent tried to contact the Soviets at



the Soviet Embassy in-Moxico City, Similarly, an A¥/OSI

controlled agont scheduled to moct a Soviet contact was

unable to do so owing to illness, but LIEMPTY photographed

another person who appeared at the mecting site and this '
person is beli dto. be. the agent's Sovict case officer.

Such coverage has been helpful to the 902nd, AF/OSI and

the FBI in running their controlled double agent operations

against the Soviets in Moxico,

3. Within one weok after a biannual change of license
plates on Soviet Embassy vehicles, LIEMPTY had provided a
complete list of the new tag numbers, along with a complete

- identification of the vehicles. Among other things, this

enabled the Station to identify the companions of Aleksandr
Aleksandrovich NIKITIN, a known KGB officer, during his

last few days in Moxico,

4, LIEMPTY has also dotormined that newcomers to the
Soviet Embassy frequéntly gravitate to groupings with their
RIS colleagues in the "safoty" of the Embassy backyard,
This fact onabled the Station.to make certain tentative
KGB and GRU identifications, In addition, certain TDYers
have been linked ‘up with their escort officers and clues
to personal relationships have occasionally been exploited,

3. In the fiold of Sovict pattorns of activity and
associations, LIEMPTY has been able to report accurate
changes in cortain specific cases. LIEMPTY coverage showed
that NIKITIN, mentioned in paragraph 3 above, changed his :
activity pattern following the defection of Raisa
Yerofeyevna KISELNIKOVA, former secretary in the Commercial
Mission in Mexico, The same applies to Oleg NECHIPORENKO,
a Sccond Secretiry at the Embassy and a known KGB officer.
LIEMPTY also provided information on the patterns and
associations of Yuriy Viktorovich KUPLYAKOV, a known KGB
officer and on Valeriy Vladimirovich SOKOLIN, a known GRU
officer, Coverage of Vladimir Viktorovich GORDEYEV, a
suspect KGB Officer, showed that he did, in fact, work in a
“restricted area" at the Soviet Embassy and also established
who some of his associates were, In the case of Oleg

~ Konstantinovich IGNATYEV, who had arrived in Mexico City

from Caracas, Venezuela, LIEMPTY was able to observe Be
IGNATYEV entering and leaving in the company of Svyastoslav

Fedorovich KUZNETSOY, Press ‘Attache and First Secretary of

the Soviet Embassy. IGNATYEV also visited the Soviet Embassy

SECRET


several othér times during his stay in Mexico City and
had contact with other known. Soviet intelligence officers
while visiting. This kind of information is a basic
contribution to the Station's continuing efforts to
identify and assess certain Soviets for possible

recruitment or defection,

6. At Headquarters, the Soviet Bloc Division uses
LIEMPTY photographs, particularly photographs of Soviet
Embassy officials, for identification purposes in con-
nection with defector cases, ‘he LIEMPTY material also
keeps the Station's Sovict section up-to-date on which
Soviet officers have been in the Embassy, which ones have
been away; who has used which car; who has been in contact
with whom; and other similar information useful in the
conduct of Soviet operations,

Problems:

1. A security problem has developed involving
Raymond H. GERENDE. According to GERENDE, his wife wants
a divorce, apparently based mainly on incompatability of
personalities. The problem basically is that both want
custody of the children and this has sparked a dispute :
that ‘has become more bitter and violent daily. In addition,
the monetary settlement is in dispute. The problem is
compounded by the fact that GERENDE's wife knows in.some '
considerable detail of GERENDE'’s activities on behaif of
the Agency, Thus, if the case does go to court, it could
lead to the surfacing of GERENDE's Agency employment and

.possible compromise of LILYRIC, LICALLA and LIENTRAP,

Even if the case does not go to court, GERENDE's wife could
expose him as an Agency employee. Since late 1969, Mexico

City Station has been in touch with both GERENDE and his

wife on this problem, and every effort is being made by

the Station to-have both parties settle the divorce out of

court, and to protect GERENDE's cover and that of the i
project. After weighing all factors, it has been decided !
that continued employment of GERENDE is not an acceptable F
risk, and the decision has been reached to terminate him

by the end of FY 1979, GERENDE will be paid a termination
bonus of $10,000 for 15 years service, about $1,250 more
than the $8,750 his contract calls for, in order to ensure :
that the termination is amicable and thereby preserve



“project security. In addition, his wife, LIEMPTY-19 will
be given $2,500 as a security measure designed to keep her

. from revealing what she knows about project operations.
The FY 1970 budget is' being amended to cover this amount,

2, Other aspects of security continue relatively
unchanged.” All the agents still have jobs to backstop
their Agency wares. The Station is compartmented from
the action agents through FERNALD, whose contact with the
sub-agents is reasonably well covered by his status as a
retired immigrant. FERNALD has been meeting LIEMPTY-9 and
LITEMPY-13 since 9 December 1969. Brief meetings are held
once each week at pre-arranged times and places, well away
from the target aréa, Occasionally emergency meetings are
called, by phone, if special coverage is desired. FERNALD
also meets LIENPTY-4 to exchange films and prints. These
meetings are held weekly at pre-arranged times and places.
FERNALD can change meeting plans by calling LIENPTY-4
directly by telephone, In addition, LIEMPTY-4 has been
given a special extension in the Station through which he
may call as "Dr. Carios" to leave a message for "Victor"
(FERNALD), The Station case officer maintains weekly clan-
destine contact with FERNALD in order to manage the oper-

ation and collect the product,

Coordination:

Ambassador McBride has not been briefed on Project
LIEMPTY, ~

Future Plans:

1. The surveillance units are expected to continue to

+ produce valuable information in the form of photographic
Coverage and visual surveillance reports on the daily
movements, personal associations, and habit patterns of
persons frequenting the Soviet Embassy, including Soviet
officials, Operational procedures and the project mecha-
nism will continue as it has in the past, except that Bruce
H, FERNALD, a new principal agent, will be in charge of the
operation (see Changes, paragraph 2).

2, The Project does not include an uydated plan for
emergenéy contact during violent action or government over=
throw, The Station has been requested to prepare an up-
dated emergency contact plan and submit it to Headquarters

in the first FY 1971 quarterly progress report.



Costs:

-1, General! $23,635 is requested for FY 1971. It
is requested that the project be amended for FY 1970 in the
amount of $10,498 (from $38,970-to $49,468) in order to :
cover termination payments to Raymond H, GERENDE and his
wife, LIEMPTY-19.

. Source of Funds: Project LIEMPTY is included in

2
the Western Hemisphere Division's FY 1971 Operating Program
in the amount of $40,000. Funds for the FY 1970 amendment

will be absorbed in the current WH Division's finance

Purpose: |

1 Project LIirTY supgorts = visual and photographic

i surveillance of the Sovict Embussy in Moxico City. The i

| aip is to identify and cover tho noverenta of pyrsona !
entering and leaving the Kabassy, including Soviets and :

visitors. The intelligence collected through auch activity

contributes to tho Station's overall Soviet operations

program, mainly in support of Priority A-1, but to some

extent, Priority A-4, of tho Operating Directive for Moxico.

: Description:
1. The Project operates through two fixed basehouse

surveillance posts, a small photographic laboratory, a
principal agent, and six sub-agents. A team of four sub-

agents, operating from a basehouse, maintains visual and
photographic surveillance of the Soviet Embassy front
i entrance. Ono sub-agént, operating from a second bage-
| house, covers’ an aren in back of the Embassy, where Soviet
i officials meet, play and vork. These units photcgraph all ‘
persons moving ip or out of the specific target areas, They
i also maintain logs and provide written reports on observed

| activity. All of thia material is passed to the principal ”
! agent, who passes the film to another sub-agent for process-

ing at a laboratory equipped for that purpose. After the
‘film is processed and printed, the principul agent passes }
the finished product, plus written reports and logs, to the i
Station case officer. A brief description of each unit,

@ach agent and his rolo in the operation follows,



* 2, LILYRIC (MKXI-132) is a basohouso located near
. the front of the Soviet Exbassy. This house has been in
operation since October 1956. It is rented through
LIMOUSINE (201-5762), © cleared American businessman. He
is the ostensible owner of record and, as tho landlord,
-collects rent frais. the tenants and then passes it to the
Station case officer, LIENPTY-13 and his family (see
paragraph 3 below) live in the LILYRIC house and conduct
their survoillance operation from it during daylight hours

(0800-1800).

3. LIEMPFY-13 (201--119961) is tho key somber of the
LILYRIC basehouse tonn.. He saintaine contact with the
principal agent end does sone photographic work. However,
because LIEMPTY-13 is employed outside ‘o9 an induntrial
engineer, he is unable to spend much time operating the
LILYRIC photographic oquipment, and most of this work ia
done by his wife, LIXMPTY-14, and their sons, LIEMPTY-26
and LIEMPTY-27 (cee paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 bolow).

4. ULIEXNPTY-14 (201-167567) is the main photographer
and observer at the LILYRIC bagehouse. She works closely
with her husband, LIS(PTY-13, in runping. the operation,
including the preparation of observation roports and logs,
She also does the LILYRIC housekeeping, as any housewife
would do. .

3. LIEMPTY-26 (201-762111), the gon of LIEMPTY-13 and
LIEMPTY-14, has been a atudent at the Hexican Tochnoloyical
Institute. In his sparo time he operatesthe LILYRIC photo~
graphic equipment, ond helps LISMPTY-14 iu maintaining the
arrival and departure logs of target personalities.

a 6. LINMPTY-27 (201-762112), another gon of LISHPTY-13
and LIEXPTY-14, has been a prep school student. He assists
in operating the LILYRIC photographic equipment and tran-
scribes notes into a finished typewritten log of events.

7. LICALLA GHEXI-03) is a baschouse located behind
the Soviet Eubsassy. It his been in operation since 1957.
The building, a four-uoit affair, collectively known as
LINUST, is Agency ovned. It vas purchased through
LIMOUSINE in Soptember 1957, and the property ie in his
pare. Tho LICALLA site is occupied by LIENPTY-9 (see
paragraph 8 below) and he runs the surveillance operation

from it.

8, LIEMPTY-9 (201-136454) 1s the only agent operating
from the LICALLA site. He does all the photography, main-
tains logs and prepares observation reports. He also asin-
tains contact with the principal agent. LIEMPTY-9 a
part-time insurance salesuan and is 1f-enployed in the
accounting business, which he conducts at the LICALLA site.

9. Raysiond H. GERENDE (201-119523) has been the
princtpal agent for this project. le is a Mexican national

* contract agent who is self-employed as an English teacher

and also works as a salesman for a light bulb manufacturer.
GERENDE ‘has been inly responsible for waintaining contact
with the LIEMPTY agents, paesing instructions to them, and
collecting the product for passing to the Station case
officer. He has also paid them and handled all other
administrative matters. He is being terminated by the end
of FY 1970 for security reasons (sce Problems, paragraph 1),

10. Bruce H, FERNALD (P) (201-008189) replaced
GERENDE (see paragraph 9 above) as the project's principal
agent in early December 1969. FERNALD, a U.8, Citizen born
in June 1915, operates under non-official cover as a retired
immigrant. He is responsible for maintaining contact with
the LIEMPTY agents and collecting the product for passing
to the Station case officer. ie algo handles administrative
matters, including agent salary payments, FERNALD is
financially covered under Project AEMAGNIFY.

11. The LIEMPTY photographic laboratory (MEXI-137) is
located in a room at GERENDE'’s residence. It is equipped
to process the photographs taken by the LIEKPTY surveillance
units. The work is done by LIEMPTY-4. (See paragraph 12
below). Since GERENDE will be terminated by the end of
FY 1970, the Station is taking steps to establish a new
LIEMPTY photographic laboratory at a new safesite.

12, LYEMPTY-4 (201-117967) processes o11 the photo-
graphic film taken by the LIEMPTY photographers and nakes
the numbex of prints required. He does this work at night
ip the LISMPTY photographic laboratory. He is self-employed
ag a medical doctor, and he is a brother-in-law of GERENDE,
in wkose hone the laboratory ig located.

Changea: \

1
1, The LIENTRAP mobile unit, consisting of LIEMPTY-10 ©
and LIEMPLY-11, 18 being removed from Project LIEMPTY and
placed under Project LIEMBRACE, which supports a unilateral
physical surveillance team. The purpose of this change is
to increase the size of the LIEMBRACE team in order to meet
& growing demand for operational surveillance support from
the various Station operating sections, The transfer will
become effective at the beginning of FY 1971 and both |
FY 1971 project budgets have been adjusted to cover financial
'

aspects of the change. :

2. Raymond H, GERENDE was removed ag the LIEMPTY §
principal agent in early December 1969 owing to a security
problem (see Problems, paragraph 1). He was replaced on
9 December 1909 by Bruce H, FERNALD, a career agent oper-
ating under cover a9 a retired immigrant. The change has
caused some delay in the receipt of photographs because
FERNALD is unable to meet LIEXPTY agents as frequently as
GERENDE had met them, but operational effectiveness is not
significantly reduced by this delay, The key issue is that
security and reliability of the principal agent have improved

considerably.

Accomplishnents:

1. Project LIEMPTY has provided continuous daily
photographic and visual coverage (Monday through Saturday)
of the front entrance and rear arens of the Soviet Embassy
in Mexico City. All Boviet personnel and their visitors
entering or leaving the Embassy have been photographed, ; In
addition, visual surveillance reports were prepared when
appropriate. These photographs and reports have contributed
essential operational support to the Station's Soviet oper-

ationa program.

2, Recently, LIEMPTY photographs were exclusively used
to produce an updated mugbook on Soviet officials in Mexico.
The book has been loaned to the FBI, AF/OSI and the 903nd
Military Intelligence Group for operational use in debriefing
thelr agents engaged in dangle operations and double agent
operations against the Soviet services in Mexico City. One
202nd controlled agent was identified from an LIEMPTY photo-
graph taken when the agent tried to contact the Soviets at



the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City. Similarly, an AF/OSI
controlled agent scheduled to mect a Soviet contact vas
unable to do so owing to illness, but LIEUPTY photographed
another: porson who appeared at the meeting situ and this
person is believed to bo the agent's Soviet case officer.
Such coverage has been helpful to the 902nd, AF/OSI and

the FBI in running their controlled double agent operations

against the Soviets in Hoxico. r

3. Within one week after a biannual change of license
Plates on Soviet Embassy vehicles, LIEMPTY had provided a
complete list of ‘the now tag numbers, along with a complete
identification of the vehicles. Among other things, this
enabled tho Station to identify the companions of Aleksandr
Aleksandrovich NIKITIN, a kaown KGB officer, during hie

last few days ip Moxico.

4. LIEMPTY has also determined that newcomers to the
Soviet Embassy frequently gravitate to groupings with their
RIS colleagues in the "safety" of the Embassy backyurd.
This fact enablod the Station to make certain tentative
KGS and GRU identifications. In addition, certain TDYers
have been linked up with their escort officers and clues
to personal relationships have occasionally been exploited.

5. Im the field of Soviet patterns of activity ond
associations, LIEMPTY bas been able to report accurato
changes in certain specific cases. LIEMPTY coverage showed
that NIKITIN, mentioned in paragraph 3 above, changed his
activity pattern following the defection of Raisa
Yerofeyevnn KISELNIKOVA, former secretary in the Corsercial
Mission in Mexico. Tho sume applies to Oleg NECHIPORENKO, -
a Second Secretary at the Rebasyy and a known KGB officor.
LIEMPTY also provided information on the patterns and
associations of Yuriy Viktorovich KUPLYAXOV, a known KGB
officer and on Valeriy Vladimirovich SOKOLIN, & known GRU
officer. Coverage of Vladimir Viktorovich GORDEYEV, a
suspect KGB officer, showed that he did, in fact, work ip a
“restricted areca” at the Soviet Embassy end algo established
who sone of his usscciates weru. In thé case of Oleg
Konstantinovich IGNATYEV, who had arrived in Hexico City
from Caracas, Venezuela, LIEMPTY was ablo to observe
IGNATYEV entouring and leaving in the company of Svyastoslav
Fedorovich KUZNETSOV, Press Attache and First Secretary of
the Soviet Embassy. IGNATYEY also visitud the Soviet Fmbassy



several other times during his stay in Mexico City and
had contact with other known Sovict inteiligence officers
while visiting. This kind of inforeation is a basic
contribution .to the Station's cortinuing cfforts to
identify and asses@ certain Soviets for possible
recruitment or defection.

6. At Headquarters, the Soviet Bloc Division uses
LIBUPTY photographs, particularly pYotographs of Soviet
Embassy officinls, for identificaticn purposes in con-
nection with Jefector cases, The LIEUPTY material also
keeps the Station's Soviet section up-to-date on which
Soviet officers have been in the Sntassy, which ones have
been away; who has uged shich car: vho has been in contact
with whom; ond other cimilar information useful in the
conduct of Soviet operations.

Problees:

1, A security probles has dcreloped involving
Raymond H. GBRENDE. According to GERENDE, his wife vants
a divorce, apparently based sainly os incompatability of
personalities. The problem basicslly is that both vant
custody of the children and this hts sparked a dispute
that has becone nore bitter and violent daily. In addition,
the monetary settlepent is in dispute. The problea is
compounded by the fact that GEREXDE's wife knows io sone
considerable detail of GEREXDE's sctivities on behalf of
the Agency, Thus, if the case does go to court, it could
lead to the surfacing of GERENDS's agency employsent and
possible compromise of LILYRIC, LICALLA and LIENTRAP,

Even if the case does not go to court, GBRENDE's wife could
expose hin as an Agency employee. Since late 1965, Mexico
City Station has been in touch with both GERENDS and his
wife on this problem, and every effort is being made by
the Station to have both parties settle the divorce out of
court, and to protect GEREXDE's cover and taat of the
project. After weighing all factors, it has heen decided
that continued employment of GSALYVE ts not an acceptable
risk, and the decision has been reached to terminate din
by the end of FY 1970, GERENDE vill be paid a termination
bonus of $10,000 for 15 years service, about $1,250 sore
than the 38,750 hiy contract calls for, in order to ensure
that the termination. is anicable end thereby preserve

adele



be given $2,500 ag a security measure designed to keep her
from revealing what she knows about project operations.
The FY 1970 budget is. being amended to cover this aaount.

Other aspects of security continue relatively
All the agents still have jobs to backstop

their Agetcy wages. The Station is compartnented from

the action agents through FERNALD, whose contact with the

sub-agents 1s reasonably well covered by his status as a

¥ dmmigrant. FERNALD has been meeting LIEMPTY-9 and
LITEMPY-13 since 9 December 1969. Brief meetings held
once each week at ‘pre-arranged times and places, well away
from the target aren. Occasionally emergency meetings are
called, by phone, if special coverage is desired, FERNALD
also meets LIKHPTY-4 to exchange films and prints. These
meetings are held weekly at pre-arranged times and places.
FERNALD can change secting plans by calling LIEMPTY-4
directly by telephone. In addition, LIEMPTY-4 bas been
given a special extension in the Station through which he

<may-call as "Dr, Carlos" to leave a message for “Victor”
(FERNALD), The Station case officer maintains weekly clan-
destine contact vith FERNALD in order te manage the oper-
ation and collect the product.

Coordination:
Ambassador McBride has not been briefed on Project
LIEMPTY.

Future Plana:

1. The surveillance units are expected to continue to
produce valuable information in the form of photographic
coverage and visual surveillance reports on the daily
movements, personal associations, and habit patterns of
persons frequenting the Soviet Rmbassy, including Soviet
officials. Operational procedures and the project mecha-
fism will continue as it has in the past, except that Bruce
H. FERNALD, a new principal agent, will be in charge of the
operation (see Changes, paragraph 2).

2. The Project does not include an up-dated plan for
emergency contact during violent action or government over-
throw, The Station has been requested to prepare an up-
dated emergency contact plan and submit it to Headquarters
in the first FY 1971 quarterly progress report.

. MEMORANDUM FOR : Assistant Deputy Director for Plans

THROUGH - 3 MPS/BG
SUBJECT = -:_-“-Renewal of Project LIEMPTY

1. WH Division requests renewal of Mexico City Station's
Operational Support Project, LIEMPTY, for $23,635 for Fiscal
Year 1971 and a $10,498 amendment for FY 1970 to cover termin=
ation payments to a former Principal Agent and his wife. Last
yoar LIEMPTY was approved for $38,970. One agent termination
and the transfer of the cost of a mobile surveillance unit to
another project are responsible for the reduced FY 1971 request.

2, ‘LIEMPTY supports a visual and photographic surveil-
lance of the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City, It includes a
Principal Agent, Raymond H, GERENDE (P), and 6 subagents who
maintain two separate safehouses, one in front and one in
the rear of the Soviet Embassy, from which anyone entering or
leaving the Embassy can be observed and photographed. The
various members of. the team handle and service the photographic
equipment, develap and print photographs, keep observation
reports,and logs, including the arrival and departure of tar-
get persons, and maintain the two safehouses mentioned above,

3, This project does not provide positive intelligence,
except incidentally, It is designed to furnish a running
account, both photographic and in writing, of all Soviet
Embassy personnel and their visitors arriving at, or leaving,
the Embassy, Photographs taken by LIEMPTY personnel were
used to produce an updated "mugbook" on Soviet officials in 7
Mexico which has been loaned to other US security agencies
for operational use in activities targeted against Soviet
services in Mexico City. LIEMPTY agents also provided infor-
mation which enabled the Station to identify the companions of
known KGB officials, to identify the habit patterns of new
arrivals at the Soviet Embassy and provided a wealth of other
information of operational value concerning Soviet Embassy

activities,
4, A security problem, resulting in a Station decision

to restrict the activities of GERENDE, place him on half pay,
and replace him with a career agent (a valuable asset who



=m SECRET it

also handles SB operations) arose during the project yéar.
GERENDE has been having marital difficulties which may end
Along with other incompatible features of the
marriage, which have resulted in numerous family fights,
there have been long, bitter and violent arguments as to who

“ will have custody of their 4 children and concerning a mone-

tary settlements ;The Station has become involved in these
altercations. because GERENDE's wife is knowledgeable of his
CIA relat{ouship and could,” if she chose to do so, expose hia
as an agency employee. ~ She has promised to keep quiet but
there is no assurance that si 411 do so, In view of the
risk involved, should GERENDE's wife expose his agency rela-

tionship and in view of the fact that, despite his 15 years

of service and his undisputed ability and experience, other
unfavorable qualities militate against his retention, the
Station is considering terminating GERENDB. It is proposed
to pay him a términation bonus of $10,000 for 15 years of
service in accordance with Mexican Iaw and his wife $2,500 as
a security measure designed to keep her quiet. After discus-

-sion with the desk, FI Staff believes that, if GERENDE is

paid the $10,000 termination money, it should not be given to
him in one lump sum but should be paid on a monthly basis,
the amount per month to be determined by the Station, thus
eliminating the possibility of his squandering it all at
once and possibly coming back for more of the same, The same
procedure should be followed in the $2,500 payment to his
wife, In bo¥h cases at least an element of control is
assured in thit both GERENDE and his wife will know that con-
tinued receipt of their monthly paymonts will depend upon
their continued loyalty to the agency. In the meantime, we
feel this man, whose morale, and ability have been seriously
affected by his marital strife, given time, can perhaps be
rehabilitated and once again become a valuable Station asset,
This would ensure his continued loyalty and give him an income
out of which to pay his alimony, Aside from the foregoing
there were no other problems, security or otherwise. Ali
meetings between the case officer and the new Principal Agent
are held under secure conditions, or more often if necessary,
at prearranged dates, times and places. Meetings between the
P/A and the subagents are held under similar conditions. The
Station has been requested to submit an updated emergency re-
contact plan to be included in the first FY 1971 quarterly

Program report for this project,

“maintenance and travel, property maintenance and Christmas

ny SECREI 7

: 5 JUN 1969
MEMORANDUN FOR: Assistant Deputy Director for Plans
THROUGH 3, MPS/BG
SUBJECT 2 FY 1970 Renewal of Project LIEMPTY for $38,970

1. Project LIEMPTY, now in its eleventh year, is the Mexican
Station's operation which provides visual and photographic surveil-
lance of the Soviet Embassy from safehouses at the front entrance
and back of the building, as well as from a mobile unit. All Soviet
personnel and their visitors coming to the Embassy are photographed.
From 1 November 1967 to 31 December 1968, approximately 21,367 photo-
graphs were taken and thousands of pages of surveillance reports were
completed by personnel .in this project. SB Division is pleased with
the quantity and quality of the photographs and the Station finds them
useful for operational purposes against the SB target. During the
past year several U.S. citizens entered the Soviet installation in
Mexico City and thetr photographs were identified by the FBI. There
is a good relationship between the Station and the FBI in Mexico City
and appropriately sterilized photographs are passed locally.

2. There have been no significant security problems.

3. The only changes in the project have been the elimination of
one of the safehouses, which was used as an observation post, and
termination of the agent who attended it. No real loss resulted from
this change since the safehouse was so located that photographs taken
from it overlapped those taken from another safehouse. The agent who
serviced the facility was getting too old to do an efficient job and
was terminated amicably. Also during the past year a new agent was
added to the project.

4, Total funds requested for FY 1970 are $38,970. Salaries and
legally required bonuses for nine agents come to $30,080; safehouse
rental and eaintenance amounts to $6,188; maintenance of two vehicles,
$1,200; and photo and operational expenses, $1,500. FY 1969 approval
was for $43,520 and-estimated obligations for this period are $43,500.
A new, $5,000 vehicle was purchased in FY 1969 and none is needed in
FY 1970 which accounts for the reduction in costs for the present year,

a 5. Project LIEMPTY contributes substantially to. the Mexican
Station's SB°effort. The occasional identification of U.S. nationals
in contact with the Soviets could have an important bearing on National
Security. The operation ts handled by an experienced and capable,
outside contract agent under the direction of a Station officer which
ee provides good security and personne? economy. It is a well managed and

procuctive operational support mechanism necessary to a opera-
tions. FI Staff recommends approval.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director for Plans
SUBJECT : LIEMPTY Project Renewal (FY 1970)

1. Renowal is requested for the LIEMPTY Project for
the period 1 July 1969 through 30 June 1970 (FY 1970) in
the amount of $38,970, Funds are available in WH Division,

~ $45,000 was programmed for FY 1970.

2, WLIEMPTY is a project supporting Soviet operations
of the Mexico City Station. It provides for two baschousos,
a photo surveillance vehicle, and personnel for photographic
and visual surveillance of the Soviet Embassy. Presently,
two fixed surveillance points near the Embassy provido the
location from which the photographs are taken and observers
are stationed, One basehouse is adjacent to the rear of the
Embassy, where Soviet officials meet, play and work, The
other basehouse is across the street from the front of the
Embassy and gives a direct view of every person entering or
leaving. There is also a mobile photographic unit (a VW
van) which is now used in support of all Mexico City Station
operations and in conjunction with the LIENBRACE surveillance
team (used primarily against Soviet targets). Raymond H,
GERENDE, an indigenous contract agent, is the principal agent
of the operation and meets daily with the basehouse keepers

and subagents.

3. LIEMPTY contributes significantly to the Station's
Soviet operations program and is considered an essential
element of the Station's support apparatus. During the
period 1 November 1967 through 31 December 1968, approxi-
matety 21,367 photographs were taken, In response to a
request to SB Division for an evaluation of the project, the
following comment was received: "There are few such sources
of high resolution photographs of Soviets, especially giving
good side views. These photos are welcomed by SB Division
Since they furnish a steady flow of up-to-date identity
gata " The photos are useful to the Station in confirming
the identities of Soviet porsonnel and visitors to the

SECRET


- SECRET

Embassy, some of whom are U, S, citizens. During the past
year, several of these U, S, citizens were identified with .
the help of the photos (which were passed to the FBI)
Furthermore, the movements and habits of the Soviets are
Studied, and more knowledge is acquired on their friends

and associates, especially Mexican nationals, This informa-
tion is useful in target studies. For example, the senior

TASS representative, a known XGB officer, is a recruitment
target. He is under intensive operational scrutiny for

leads developed from knowledge of his activities and contacts,
LIEMPTY support is an integral part of this current develop-

mental activity. :

-. 4 During the past year, one of the three basehouses
was closed, leaving two, and the agent attending it was
terminated, This was done because the agent was becoming
less effective with age, and because there was some over-
lap between the photos taken from this basehouse and those
of another. The termination was amicable, and the working
hours of the personnel of the other basehousc were extended
slightly. Another agent was also hired to help. This new
agent is of the same family as the rest of the personnel
occupying the basehouse, and no additional security risks are

anticipated from this addition,

5, ‘There have been:no security or administrative prob-
lems. The Station and GERENDS are constantly on the alert
for any sign that the Soviets are aware of the surveillance
activities, While it is quite possible that the Soviets are
aware of the surveillance, so far indications are that they
are at least not fully aware, since no effort is made by
them to avoid being photographed, even when having meetings
with contacts in the rear of the Embassy,

6. Approval is recommended of this valuable operational’
support project,

An operational support project providing three basehouses and

4 mobile surveillance unit to monitor primarily the Soviet
Embassy, its personnel and its visitors, by physical and photo=
graphic surveillance.

BACKGROUND: ‘The project covers three properties near the Soviet Enbassy

PROGRESS:

FUNDS:

(two in front of the Embassy's sole entrance and one beliind the
garden) from which visual and photographic surveillance is carried
out. It also covers a darkroom and a mobile photographic truck.
Some of the project personnel are used at times for miscellaneous
support tasks such as servicing postal boxes and for counter-
surveillance and other protective services.

During the past year the project provided nearly o11 of the opera-
tional photographs and physical surveillance reports used in the
Station's operations against the Soviet Embassy and its personnel.
SB Division says, "This rather unique operation has unquestionably
made a major contribution to the increasingly effective Soviet
Operations program of the Mexico Station.”

The project produces primarily operational data and counterintelli-
gence information. It provides leads, evidence of which Soviet
officers have been in the Embassy and which ones have been away,
who has used which car, who has been talking to whom or going out
of the building with whem. (One photograph from this project was “
used in the Warren Commission Report.)

MEMORANDUM FOR: Assistant Deputy Director for Plans

THROUGH: MPS/BG
SUBJECT: Project LIEMPTY

1. WH Division requests renewal of LIENPTY for the
19-month period 1 December 1967 through 30 June 1969 in
tho amount of $69,725. While this represents a slight
reduction-on a pro rata basis from the $45,000 for which
LIEMPTY was approved for the 12-month period starting
1 Decomber 1966, it reflects a proportionately modest
increase in cost for the 19-month renewal period over the
estimated total disbursement of $40,130 for the past
project year. This will provide for small salary increases
to meet the rising cost of living for certain of the agents
involved -in the project who have not received raises in
some time as well as for slightly higher rental fees for
the various basehouses. The project, now in its tenth
year, is designed primarily to provide for the collection
.of operational information on the Soviet Embassy in Mexico
City, including the identification and muvemcnts of its
personnel and visitors. To this end, LIEMPTY: provides
for the maintenance and exploitation of threé basehouses
for fixed visual and photographic surveillance of the
Soviet Embassy and a mobile basehouse in the form of a.
panel ‘truck used for mobile photography against the Polish
Embassy, leaders and mecting sites of local communist
parties, and other targets of opportunity. An important
corollary objective of LIEMPTY is operational support in
the form of countersurveillance for Agency personnel and
operations, including those of other bases and stations
as the needs and requirements of the Mexico Station permit.
The funds requested include $43,520 for the period 1
December 1967 through 30 November 1968 and an additional
$26,205 to cover the period 1 December 1968 through 30
June 1969. The latter tunds are asked for in a supple-
mental request to put the project on a fiscal year basis.

2. A long-term contract agent and eight other support
agents are involved in the management and operation of the



LIEMPTY facilities and in surveillance activities directed
at the primary Sovict target. Some of these agents are -
used also in dark room photographic processing, letter
drop, and, on occasion, moving surveillance activities.

3. This project is only part of the complex:of
Mexico City Station instruments for meeting requirements
from a number of U.S. agencies, including the FBI. It ““
is clearly an effective, well-managed support operation

serving important needs.

4. No major or significant changes in LIEMPTY
personnel or operational techniques have beon introduced
nor have there been any known incidents adversely
affecting. the security of the project or its personnel
since the previous project renewal period. As a uni=
lateral operational support effort, LIEMPTY cont inues to
be a most useful station asset supporting a number of
station activities. In spite of small increases in costs
as discussed above, the project is considered to be holding
the line on cost and personnel.

5. The objectives of project LIEMPTY are in direct
support of priority A objectives 1, 2, and 4 of the current
Operating Directive for Mexico. It is considered by SB
Division to have made significant contributions to the
Station's well developed, high priority Sovict Operations
Program, During the past year the various LIEMPTY base-
house installations produced valuable information in the
form of photographic coverage and physical surveillance
reports on the daily movements, personal associations and
habit patterns of selected targets of special interest.

In numerous instances this coverage confirmed the specific
intelligence service connections of Soviet officers in the
Embassy. Often the identities of Mexicans and nationals of
other countries in contact with the Soviets were estab-
lished. The mobile panel truck unit was exploited regu-
larly to provide information on not only the Soviets but
also the Cuban target as well as local Communist Party

targets.

PROJECT BRIEFING
PROJECT: LIEMPTY . WH - Mexico City

ACTION ; ADD/P approval of renewal 1 Dec 66 - 30 Nov 67

PURPOSE: Provides stationary surveillance against the Soviet Embassy
ahd a mobile photographic baschouse which is used primarily
against the Polish Embassy and local Communist party leaders,

: PROGRESS: Three basehouses (LIMITED, LILYRIC and LICALLA) pro-
vide coverage of both the front and rear of the Soviet Embassy.
Throughout the past renewal period each operational component
contributed. actively and concretely to the fulfillment of the
operational tasks levied on the Station, In the first nine-month
period approximately 17,000 individual frames of operational
photographs were provided from the fixed basehouses. These
served to confirm the identities of Embassy personnel and
their visitors and provided detailed reporting on the movement
and habit patterns of selected targets of special interest. The
mobile unit (LIENTRAP) provided over 1, 000 individual photo~
graphs, Of particular value were photographs of local and
exile Communist leaders, Raymond H. GERENDE (p) continued
in the role as principal agent for Project LIEMPTY, His overall
operational assignment involved at least 12 clandestine meetings
per week, in addition to his meetings with the LIEMPTY project

case officer,

PROBLEMS: In mid 1966 LICOWL/1, who owns a small store near the
Soviet Embassy, reported tnat a Soviet official had approached
him and asked him to inform on his neighbors, Reportedly the
Sovict named LIEMPTY/6 of the LIMITED basehouse by name
and also asked about the tenants of the building housing LILYRIC,
However, in view of LICOWL's previous history of lying, it is
difficult to assess exactly what the Soviets requested and just
what LICOWL/1 may have told them. The Station is still looking

into this development,

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director for Plans
SUBJECT 3 LIEMPTY Project Renewal

1, It is requested that the LIEMPTY Project be
renewed for the period 1 December 1966 through 30
November 1967 for a total-of $45,000: $29,020 for
FY 1967 and $15,980 for FY 1968, The Project is in-
cluded in the FY 1967 Operational Program for $45,000,
Funds are available within WH Division,

2. LIEMPTY covers stationary surveillance base-
houses targeted against the Sovict Embassy. These
basehouses provide photographic coverage and logs. Two
of the basehouses (LIMITED and LILYRIC) cover the
activity in the front of the Embassy, and LICALLA provides
coverage of the back courtyard area, The LIEMPTY project
also covers a mobile photographic baschouse in the tora
of a panel truck which is used against the Polish Embassy
where we have no permanent surveillance basehouse, and
against other targets of opportunity.

3. The value of Soviet Embassy photographic cover-
Age during the: past year was proven when the logs
maintained by LILYRIC were used to double check on-an
operation involving LIRUSTIC-1 and LICOWL-1 who had told
conflicting stories of certain events concerning the
activity of some Soviets. Through the surveillance
reports of the LIEMPTY Project against the Soviet Embassy,
it was proven without a doubt that LICOWL-1 (who had just
taken a polygraph without apparent deception) was lying
about his contacts with the Soviets.

4, The LIENTRAP mobile photographic basehouse was
targeted against leaders and meeting sites of the local
Communist parties as well as other targets of opportunity,
particularly exile Communist leaders now residing in
Mexico. LIENTRAP provided up-dated identification

s



om SECRET il

-2-
photographs of Communist officers which are of value
to both the JNTIGER program and the Station's :
recruitment/penctration program. The LIENTRAP
Personnel also regularly service twenty-one postal
accommodation addresses used by the Mexico City

Station,

5.. One development which may affect the ‘security
of the LIEMPTY baschouses of LIMITED and LILYRIC
occurred in mid 1966 when LICOWL-1 (who owns a small
store near the Sovict Embassy) reported that a Soviet.
official, AEQUALITY-1, had approached him and
requested him to inform on his neighbors. Reported]
the Soviet named LIEMPTY-6 (of the LIMITED basehouse)
by name and also indicated all the tenants (unnamed)
of the new building which now houses LILYRIC, The
Soviet pinpointed the building by saying the one being!
built by a person who fit perfectly the description of
LIMOUSINE. LICOWL-1 did not indicate that the Soviet
reflected any interest in LIMOUSINE. The occupants of
the LILYRIC basehouse were not mentioned. LICOWL-1
indicated to his Station contact that the only person
he really suspected an the neighborhood was LIEMPTY-6
(of LIMITED) who doesn't go to work, is always typing,
lives comfortably. and owns a car, He claims to have -
heard it rumored that LIEMPTY-6 was working for the
Americans. (Since LIMITED is equipped with a radio
and tips off the Station's surveillance team when it
is used against Soviet targets, Headquarters has
already assumed that the Soviets have identified this
basehouse.) LICOWL-1 also listed several persons
named by the Soviet who had no connection whatsoever

with CIA,

6. The Station instructed LICOWL-1 not to become
an informant on his neighbors. According to LICOWL-1,
he therefore told AEQUALITY-1 he did not have time to
collect the information the Soviet wanted. However,
in view of the lies LICOWL-1 has been caught in, it
is difficult to assess exactly what the Soviets asked
of LICOWL-1 and just what LICOWL-1 may have told the
Soviets. The Station is still looking into this develop-

ment.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Assistant Deputy Director for Plans

‘THROUGH: DDP/Pa
SUBJECT: . Project LISMPTY Reneval

1. FI Staff recommends approval of the renewal of Project
LIEMPTY. This project, costed at $41,500., supports the following
Mexico City assets: a pane) truck used for mobile photography,
three base houses for fixed photographic surveillance, a contract
agent manager and eight support agents. One of the base hones is
used as a control point to dispatch a surveillance team. (The

latter is not a part of the project, however.)

2, The LIEMPTY target is the Soviet Eubassy and Soviet
activities in Mexico City. LISMPTY is part of the complex of
station instruments by means of Viich requirements from a variety
of U.S. agencies are met. One of the sites provided pictures
later used in the Warren Comission Report, and the publication
of the report created a security hazard. ‘The Station moved the
site and it is now back in operation.

3. The possibility of Soviet intercept of radio commo to
the surveillance team has been carefully weighed recently by SR,
the desk, O/C and TSD. The decision to accept the risk appears
to have been taken with due deliteration.

4, This is clearly an effective, vell-managea operation
serving an important need. We recommend renewal without hesitation.

MENORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director for Plans
SUBJECT © : Project LIEMPTY Renewal Request

1, Renewal is requested for the LIEMPTY Project for
the period 1 December 1965 through 30 November 1966 for a
total of $41,500; of this amount, $25,520 should be
alloted for FY 1966 and $15,980 for FY 1967, This Project
has been programmed in FY 1966 for $50,000.. The last
Project Renewal was approved at $45,300, Funds are
available within WH Division,

2, The security of this Project appears to be good.
The LIENTRAP photo truck was repainted a different color
in January 1965 to preserve the security of this vehicle
which operates extensively in the same general arcas, There
have been no apparent ramifications from the publication
of the LIMITED Photograph in the Warren Commission Report

in September 1964,

‘ 3. LIENTRAP is one of two mobile photo surveillance
units at the Station, both of which are used extensively
because of the many requirements for spot photo coverage
of diplomatic installations, agent mectings, and current
identification photos of targets among others.

“4, Although there are three stationary photo
baschouses under this Project all targeted against the
Soviet Embassy, there is very little duplication of
effort, and the coverage of this Embassy would be weakened
through the termination of any of them, LICALLA covers
the rear of the Embassy (garden and parking lot) and is
in a unique position to observe informal meetings and
activity there, In May 1965 a thorough assessment was
made of this basehouse to determine whether an audio
installation could be based here, directed against these i
garden conversations, It was determined that due to the
high incidence of street and other noises, this was not
practical, TSD and SR Divisions are conscious of this
requirement, however, and if any new equipment is
developed which might make this ‘operation more feasible
it will be tested, LIMITED and LILYRIC which both cover
the front entrance, provide coverage during different
parts of the day, and LIMITED also serves as a fixed radio

dispatching base for the LIEMBRACE surveillance tean,

5. The photographs from all these operations are of
value to the Station in their operational planning, for
identification by surveillance teans, for mug books, which
are often used by surveillance teams and singleton agents
in identifying Soviets, and for Headquarter's perzsnent

files,

6. With reference to the FI Staff comment made last

year at the time of the Project renewal that the radio dis-
atching from the LIMITED installation might have nade this
ase a target for the RIS, the problem was discussed in depth
with the. Office of Comrunications, TSD, and SR Divisions,

The Statiox: has been alert to the Soviet's monitoring capa-
bility and they have developed a signaling system and inter-
car communications system that will leave the LI RACE
surveillance cars on the air for a ninimum of tine, and
with limited open conversation, The result of Headquarters
and the, Station's research on this problem resulted in the
conclusion that, if a surveillance team is to operate with
automobiles, radios must be used if there is to be efficient
surveillance, and regardless of what presently availak le
type of scrambling or coding is used, radio is susceptible
to monitoring by the opposition, It was therefore concluded
that if the Station is to use the LIEMBRACE tean against
members of the Soviet installation, LIMITED must continue to
be used as the radio dispatching center and the risk factor
must be accepted until some new, more secure yet efficient
commo system is devised,

7, The reporting on the administration of this Project
is handled through regular quarterly progress reperts, The
appropriate Soviet, CP, or other Case Officers handle the
reporting and exploit. on of the product. During the past
year there were no ‘positive intelligence reports from this

Project,

8, Both SR and WH Divisions recommend renewal of this

Project.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief ‘of Operations, DD/P
SUBJECT : Project LIEMPTY (Renewal)

WH - Mexico City

1. The attached project, origingting in WH Division,
is presented for renewal for the period 1 December 1960
through 30 November 1961. The project provides for physi-
cal and photographte surveillance operations in support
and exploitation of other Mexico City Station operations,
particularly those targetted at Soviet perscnnel and in-

stallations.

2. Authority is requested to obligate $53,000 from
the DD/P-WH Division budget: $31,900 In fiscal year 1961,
and $21,100 in fiscal year 1962, subject to the availabil-
ity of funds. The amount includes $38,000 compensation
for two principal agents, one clerical support agent on an
hourly basis, and eleven survetllance and support agents;
$7,000 operational expenses (safehouse procurement, post
office boxes, rented automobiles, purchase of information,
vehicle maintenance, and operational travel); $2,500 re-
placement, repair and maintenance of photographic equip-
ment; and $5,500 basehouse rental, utilities, and mainte-

nance.

3. The field's renewal request, supported by a cover-
ing memorandum of the Division, sets forth accomplishments
of the project in the past year in terms of objectives and
estimates effectiveness, It is noted that one principal
agent, Simon D. CLACKETT (p), resigned in October 1960, and
the four-man surveillance team previously handled by him
will be transferred to project LITEMPO, comsequently being
omitted from LIEMPTY in this renewal. Three basehouses con-
tinue to be operated under the project: (a) LIMITED, which ‘i
compiles daily logs on arrivals and departures from the
LIMERICK installation, together with attendance lists of
LIMERICK employees, and handles the radio dispatch of the
LIEMBRACE surveillance team on LIMERICK personnel and targets

of opportunity. ‘This basehouse also provides photographic
coverage, concentrated en visitors. (b) LILYRIC which pro-
vides clandestine photographs particularly of visitors -to,
as well as employees of, the LIMERICK installation, prepares
weekly reports on LIMERICK employees and their wives, and
reports on license numbers of sil cars visiting the instal-
lation. (c) LICALLA, which concentrates on photographic
coverage of LIMERICK employees and their families, as well
as providing observation on the apparent positions and jobs
of the target employees, and as well as personnel changes,
Additional photographic coverage is provided by the mobile
LIENTRAP vehicle. Principal agent Raymond H. GERENDE (p)
continues to coordinate basehouse activities; principal
agent Oliver G. SCANTLING (p) ccntinues to be an independent
asset used to follow-up and explo!t operational information
on target personnel and installations, to case various in-
stallations of interest, to acquire property, etc. SCANTLING
has managed the survelllance team being transferred to
LITEMPO in the interim rollowing the resignation of CLACKETT.
The Station notes that activities at the LICALLA tasehouse
were suspended in September 1960 as the result of the ar-
rest of a knowledgeable TSD technictan in another area and
4t is not known precisely when it will be possible to re-
sume these operations. The Station believes that the
GERENDE segment is now operating under optimum arrangements
and SCANTLING will soon be relieved from his interim respon-
sibllity for the surveillance team being transferred to
LITEMPO and can concentrate more on his investigative and
casing activities. It is not planned in the coming year to
expand project activities.

4. Appropriate Special Staf: comporents concur in rec-
ommending renewal. FI Staff notes the Division's assurance
that the transfer of the unilateral surveiliance team to
LITEMPO will not affect its independent status, and remarks
that the current project review presents a clearer picture
of the usefulness of the several segments than the previous

one,

ext. 2555

1. It is requested that ap»roval be granted to amend Raymond H. GSXRDS's
contract to provide him with a termination settlenent of one month's salary for
each Sull year that he works for KUBARK and to raise his salary effective July
1959 from 3,02) to Jh,560.00 ver year. !:is last salary increase was granted on
1 Sertenber 1957. The date, 18 tarch 1958, bas been sugzested by the Station as
the beginning dite for the computation of USUNDS's termination benefits. The
Station believes that this benefit will provide GE2=NDS with the necessary
incentive to mike KURARK a career and at the same tine will give the Station an
additional elesext of control.

2. As‘pointed out in the LIMPIY Project Aporoval, GERDS, an indigenous
agent, is one of the Station's most valuable assets. Fe has a resonsible full
tine job as the LIZPTY Principal Agent wie handles the LIMITSD, LYLYRIC and
LICALLA base houses, the LIGITUP operation, the outside shotographic processing
and translation service and all the agenta particivating in these activities.

He performs his duties in a conscientious and crofessicnal manner and his
already excellent abilities are showing ecantinued inprovenent.

3. Koney was already allocated in tha LISHPIY Project aporoval for the
salary increase. Uith the effective date of 13 March 1955, for the termination
clause, GEIS will already have accrued £1,520 (his salary is {4,560 ver year)
if he should resign today. The LIEVPIY Project, as avoroved, has sufficient
funds to cover this cost if it is necessary to obligate this amount during the
present Project year. Therefore, no avilitional funds are requested.

benefit.

2. SUANTLING, a civil engineer, is a Mexican citisen, who is 0 years old.
He was granted an Operational Approval on 2 Ducembor 195i. SCANILING began his
employnent with SUSARK as a footman on tha LIPSTICK physical surveillance team and
gradually becsne a driver of a survetliance automobile, then team leader. As team
leader ha was reszonsible for the operational deployment and administrative direction
of the entire LIPSTICK team, throe automobiles, four photographic and radio dispatching
basehouses and the attendant mobile and stationary radio equipment. He collated the
fragnentary surveillance reports into finished intelligence reports for study by the
Case Officer, SCANTLING developed into a fine investigator and has obtained infor-
nation where other Station investigative ascots have failed.

3. Almost all of SCALTLING's tims now is spent following up leads obtained
from telephone intercepts and photographie surveillances. Fron July through
December 19S8 he nade approaches to individuals perforning services for the Sovict
Embassy and he nade a detailed casing report of tho Wost German Embassy. In addition,
cted mary routine investigations and surveillances. The Station plans to

: \ Wi = Mexico City

1, .The attached projéct, originating in WH Division, 19 presented
‘for your approval for an initial period from 1 December 1958 through
30 November 1959. ‘The project provides for the development of operational
inforsation through physical and photographic surveillance operations in
aupport of other Mexico City operations, particularly those targetted at
Soviet personnel and installations. Previously these operations were con-
-ducted for the most part under Projects LIPSTICK and LIJERSEY, They are
incorporated in this new project because of the June 1958 compromise of
LIPSTICK and to accosplish a more orderly administration of certain opera

t4onal support assets.

$29,900 4n fiscal year 1960, subject to the availability of funds. These

as replacements for previously authorised vehicles and their maintenance,
and a &P vehicle for SCANTLING; (d) the rent, utilities and maintenance of

i
3. Tha attached Meld Project Outline, a covering memorandum from the
Division, and an addendum to the Project Outline, review the personnel assets
and facilities transferred from the LIPSTICK and LIJERSEY operations following
_ the partial compromise of LIPSTICK in June 1958 and describe the concept of
the physical and photographic surveillance operations to be conducted under
thia project directed primarily at the Soviet Kmbassy in Mexico City. These
urveillances provide photographa and other operational data of persons ontering
and leaving the building or present in the garden area, and through additional
foot and mobile surveillances, investigative information concerning their
contacts and destinations. Agent personnel, particularly the principal egente,
are used also to conduct separate investigations, make recruit~approaches to



individuals of operational interest, and to rent rooas, and apartnente and
perform other support activities, The fixed surveillance bases, LIMITED,
LILYRIC and LICALLA, bave' been in operation for almost three yeara without
having been in any compromising situations insofar aa the Station knova.
‘The.LIPSTICK unit, a panel ‘equipped with cameras, etc., 12 considered
a partioularly valudbl t by the Field. As a replacement for « staff
agent, Wilfred 0. CLOWAR (p), who directed and trained the LIPSTICK surveil-
lance team, the husband and wife team of CLACKATT ani STORDALISI are proposed
as qualified individuals to recruft, train, and direct the now LIMPTY our
“veillance team and maintain its records, Appropriate notional cover was
arranged for thom while in their previous project, LINSSA, aa they reside in
Mexico: under true names. One of the principal ageats, GERENDE, will have no
contact with the nev eurveillance team, but will be used to conduct special
Anveatigations, counter-ourvoillances, and for other aupport uctivities.

4. Tho CI Staff comments that LIEMPIY provides several types of physical
surveillance, all of vhich provide information of CI interest, and ss a support
7 mechanism, a production review ig not appropriate cr necessary. The CI Staff
states further, that with the compromise of the LIPSTICK surveillance team
the Mexico City Station lost ite only reliable ani efficient surveillance team,
LIEMPTY representing the Station's effort to repisce that asset. Pecause of
the great nunber of CI targets in Nexico City, the CI Staff believes it is
essential that the Station be given the opportunity, through this project, to
build another surveillance team capable of oparating ageinst sensitive targets.
additionally, the CI Staff believes the case officer should work at dovising
ostensible sources of incomes for the agents vhich vill stand the acrutiny of

friends, relatives and lesa friendly forces.

5. PI/OPS suggesta that tho Division consider a gradual reduction of the
considerable financial and personnel commitments in this project in view of
the favorably developing LIENYCY liaison relatioaship. FI/CPS believes that
@ smaller, more manageable support group, with greater Station emphasie on
selectivity cf tarks and targets could well result in nore effective CT and

fT productivity.



6. I recommend approval of the project and the transfer of tho
contract agents as outlined above. The Division is requested to take
cognizance of the ouggestions-of the CI Steff and FI/OPS in the para-
grephs above relative to the security and the overall direction of the
gurveillance activities to make then zore efficient.

Request for Amendrent to LIEMHTY Project

1, It 4s requested that the LIEMPTY Project approval request be
amended to include Sinbn D. CLACKETT (ps) and wilma J. FIORCALISI (ps),
U. S. eitizens and contract agents, under this Project in place of the
Staff Agent written into the field project outline. At the same time it is
requested that the LIMHA Froject be amended to delete these contract
agents from the latter project. :

2. CLACKETT and FIORDALISI are. ndw approved under the LIMESA Project.
They were recruited in the United States to occupy a sensitive LIKESA base=.~
house, because of the sensitivity of the operation and the equinment to be
installed in the basehouse Headquarters decided U. S. citizens should be
used. The Station said appropriate documentation and backstopping could
be secured for those agents so they could be given false identities under
which they could live while they occupied the basehouse,

3. FEKI-2777 (1N 26519), of 1 Noventer 1958, notified Headquarters
that security factors and difficulty in obtaining adequate documentation
and backetopping precluded the use of U. S. citizens under LIMFSA and re~
quested permiesion to use indigenous agents for this operation. After dis=
cussions between John BaD, Chief of the Mexican desk, with the LIMESA/
LIEMPTY Care Officer in Mexico City, and discussions between representa~
tives of F1/D, OC, TSS, and WH at Headquarters, Headquarters concurred in
the field’s operational decision to use indigenous agents in the LINESA
Project, CLACnETT and FIGEDALISI received only a very superficial briefing
regarding the LIMESA Project. It 1s not believed Subject's linited know-
ledge of this sensitive operation will pose a security hazard,

4, Construction on the LIMIST houses is being kept about two weeks
from completion until indigenous agents can be cleared and recruited, The
delay in completion 1s normal bensuse all construction money in Mexico has
become extremely tight because of tne recent presidential inauguration.

5. The Station believes CLACKETT will be an excellent replacement for
Wilfred 0. CLO.ER (ps), forner Staff Agent under Project LIPSTICK, who
directed and-trained that surveillance team. CL«ChEiT has shown a remarkable
aptitude for clandestine operational activit: and survet)lance and investi+
gative work in particular. He also is interested and enthusiastic in under-
taking this assignment for KUB.FK, ‘The Station needs a good bilingual agent
to recruit, train, direct, and develop a strong dependable physical. surveil-
lance team under LIEMTY,

6. Clearances and Contacts: CLAChETT was granted a PCSA on 23 July 1958.
A POA/CA for use under LIMESA was requested on 19 Auyust 1958. FICKUALISI
was crarted an Od for use under LIMESA on 14 November 1958. Requests have
been submitted to amend their clearances for use under LIEMFTY, CLaCKETT
and FIOKALISI have signed contracts effective 1 ‘eptember 1958. The
sensitivity of the LIHLSA Project required them to leave their young son in

the United States.’ Because of this a special benefit of periodic trips to
their hone in Arizona was included in their contrects, Under LiMESA their
quarters were to be provided, An axendnent has been requested to their | ~
contracts deleting the special benefit and adding educational and quarters

allowances,

7. Notivas Control: CLACKETT and FIORDALISI are extremely
patriotic and highly motivated as evidenced in their willingness to under=
take the LIMESA Project and be separated from their son. They have indt-
cated they are more than willing to do whatever is requeste of them, no
matter. what. personal sacrifices and hardships are required. Their com-

plete livlihood is dependent on their KUSARK income.

8, Tasks: GLACKETT vill recruit, train, and direct the LIEVTY
surveillance team. ‘The Station hopes to develop this team into a major
Station support asset. ile «ill receive instructions and direction from the
Station Case Officer, FiCROALISI will be used to do all the clerical and
administrative work for the LiENFIY surveillance team,

9. Comaunigat is Gont:et: CLACKETT will contact the Station Case
Officer in a clandestine manner, All necessary security precautions will be /
taken, CLACKEIT will also contact bis surveillence agents unier a cover
which will be determined later by the Station and CLACKETT. In view of his
Mexican background, CLACETT ean pass as a Mexican, Details of communication
and contact arrangements with KcSAFK will be arranged by the Station, Under
LIEXPTY CLASKETT will be contacted by the same Case Officer he is now con=
tacted by under LIMESA, CLACES!T and FIORDALISI will be in direct contact
with relatives and friends in the United States. The cover company has,
until now, been serving as a letter drop and contact point for emergency

messages.

10, Gover: CLACAETT and FIORDALISI entered Mexico on United States
documentation and it is planned they will continue to live in Mexico under
true name, CLACKST? has a notional cover as a public relations consultant
which was established by ccD/No to use with friends and relatives in the J. S,
The same cover story can be adcpted to cover their proposed use under Li:SPTY
vis-a-vis their United States friends. The Station is working on local cover

for CLACHETT to use in Mexico.

11, Anticdnated Costs: It is anticipated thst the following expenses
will be incurred by CLACASTT ard FICKDALISIs

cde qe te requested that the Mexico City Station be authorised-to
purchase- ' bed sedans for use by the LIEMPTY surveillance team, The.-
Station plans to expand the LIR@TY surveillance team into a larger, vel,
trained physi¢al’ surveillance asset, ‘They will need ‘three automobiles,
Private automobiles or commercial transportation will not be satisfactory
since the cars imst be outfitted with two-way radios,

2, Authority 4s also requested to purchase @ panel truck-to be used

3. It 4e also requested that a quasi-personal car be authorised for

Oliver G, Scantling (ps), Scantling is an indigenous agent under oral
contract, A car is a prerequisite for his work for KUBARK which includes

casings, surveillances, and investigations, Because of the sensitive
nature of his work, and the heavy use made of the car, the Station has

decided that Scantling should be furnished a QP car.

4. LIEMPTY agents were formerly carried under the LIJERSEY and

EIPSTICK Projects, The vehicles used by the LIEMPTY agents under these

other Projects will be: disposed of ani new ones will be purchased after
the above TVA has been approved. ‘The vehicles which will be replaced
are HV 2148, MV 2147, MV 2138, and MV 2031, One of the surveillance
cars will be new and will not replace an old car. It was decided that
these vehicles should be replaced rather than transferred to the LISPTY
Project for security reasons ani because of the age of the automobiles.
The automobiles are 1951 and 1952 models and have beon used for sensitive
surveillance work for over two years. The panel truck which was used in
the LIENTRAP Operation under the LIPSTICK Project has been operating for
two years in all parts of the city and has become a security threat. The
fact that the LIPSTICK surveillance toan knows that the truck exists,
even to the point that one of the teaa zeabers is the listed ower of the
truck, aleo dictates replacement of this vehicle.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Acting Chief, WH Divisfon
SUBJECT: KDFACTOR Project Amendment and Termination

1. The KOFACTOR Project, which provided photographic

survetllance from two vantage potats of the Soviet compound .

in Mexico City, was determined to be compromised due to the
VWBLANKET case. The five agents were terminated in July
1972, but the base houses could not be terminated until
January 1973 because {t was necessary to sell one and the
termination of the second was tied to the termination of
KDABBEY who owned the second base house. It was necessary
to pay rent for several extra months until these other
terminations could be effected.

2. The base houses and agents have now all? been ter-
minated and the Station already has rented a replacement,
safehouse with new agents to provide the same coverage
(KDALCOVE).

3. Approval of the amendment and termination of

Project KOFACTOR fs recommended.

" MEMORANDUM FOR: Assistant Deputy Director for Plans
SUBJECT: Security Review of Project KDFACTOR

1. At the time you approved the renewal of Project
KDFACTOR in December 1971 you asked that the Station
conduct an updated security review of this operation,
which provides photographic surveillance of the Soviet
Embassy in Mexico City. You asked that particular atten-
tion be paid to terminated agents and their families.

The Station has made a security review and a detailed
report on the findings, from Chief, WH Division, is
attached.

2. The report discusses the history of the opera-
tion, describes security problems of the past and steps
taken to remedy them, and discusses the security and
operational situation of the agents presently covered
by the project. The report notes that the two opera-
tional sites and their associated agents are compart-
mented from each other and that processing the film is
now being done inside the Station. One section of the
report discusses in detail the assets who were formerly
involved in these operations but have been terminated.
The final section of the report describes current secu-
rity practices and notes that an alternate photographic
surveillance site has been procured and is available
for use should the present one be compromised.

3. The report demonstrates that the security of
the operation is being kept up to high standards and
that there are no potential security threats from
former agents that the Station is not aware of. The
FI Staff believes that the Station's security review
and the attached report satisfy the requirements of

your request.

. MEMORANDUM FOR: Assistant Deputy Director for Plans
SUBJECT : FI Project KDFACTOR, Security Review

REFERENCE : ADDP Memo (DD/P 1-5899) to C/WHD dated
14 December 1971

1, In response to reference the following is a summary of the
KDFACTOR security review:

The Station summary of the KDFACTOR Project security is
as follows:

"There were no known problems of security relating to
the Project. In response to the Headquarters request, we have
reviewed all phases of the operation and believe that Project
security is sound. The Project assets have all been with us for
many years and have established themselves as respectable long-
time residents of the area, All five assets, four in one family
and one in another, are’ extremely security conscious and have :
all been SGSWIRLED.' The assets derive a substantial portion
of their livelihood from their Agency employment and would thus :
lose a great deal if security factors ever necessitated a termina- :
tion of their work for us,, As an additional safeguard, the
KDLITERAL and KDABSINTHE operations are compartmented
from eachother, and there has never been any indication that
either segment of KDFACTOR knows of the other's existence",

The Headquarters desk has also reviewed the security of the
KDFACTOR Project and agrees with the Station that the security i
is sound, In fact, as presently constituted, the KDFACTOR Hy
Project is well compartmented, and each of the two KDFACTOR
photo basehouses (KDLITERAL and KDABSINTHE) is run by long~
term assets who draw a minimum of suspicion in their operational aa
activities. Terminated assets could possibly expese the existence

Cae

of this project, but that seems unlikely from the Headquarters

review of terminated agents witting of present KDFACTOR

. operational activities, A Soviet investigation of property owner-
ship around the Soviet Embassy and their awareness that the
Soviet Embassy was under photographic surveillance in the past
could result in a Soviet investigation of the activities and contacts
of KDABBEY-1, the owner of an apartment building and four
houses close to the Soviet Embassy, It is doubtful that KDABBEY-l's
activities, which do not inter-relate with the activities of the
KDFACTOR agents, would in any way ee the KDFACTOR
Project operational activities,

2, A brief history of the KDFACTOR Project:

The KDFACTOR Project had its origins in the LIERSEY
and LIPSTICK Projects, both active in the mid-1950's, In 1958, after
the arrest of two LIPSTICK surveillance team members, it was decided
to break off the more sensitive, uncompromised LIPSTICK assets manning
and supporting two basehouses for photo surveillance of the Soviet Embassy,
These asséts were consolidated with one photo basehouse against the Soviet
. Embassy and one surveillance team from the LLJERSEY Project into a new
project-(LIEMPTY), which was approved on 16 January 1959, The LIEMPTY
Project, renamed the KDFACTOR Project in 1971, consisted of three photo
“basehouses, two viewing:the front of the Soviet Embassy (LIMITED and
LILYRIC) and one viewing the rear garden of the Soviet Embassy (LICALLA),
plus a mobile surveillance team (LIENTRAP) tied closely with the LIMITED
basehouse, which was the radio control point for dispatch of the LIENTRAP.

2 In 1959 the LIENTRAP surveillance vehicle and two team
members were arrested at the scene of a Cuban demonstration in Mexico
City, A Station review of the security implications of this incident stated
that it did not materially affect the security of the project nor expose any
of the LIEMPTY basehouse operations, (Note: As the basehouse operations
were compartmented, the only exposure possible from this incident would
have been of the LIMITED basehouse, which is no longer in existence, )

The LIEMPTY Project operated substantially as above until ae
the Warren Commission report was published in late 1964, In this publica-
tion was a picture of a person entering the Soviet Embassy taken from the
LIMITED basehouse, The LIMITED photo basehouse was closed in Sept-
ember 1964, and all photographic surveillance was suspended as a security
precaution, In Janvary 1965 the LIMITED basehouse was relocated, and

SECRET


SECRET eS

4 ig

later that year the building it had previously been in was razed by the
owner, KDABBEY-l. From 1964 on it must be assumed that the Soviet ~

. Embassy in Mexico City believes it is under regular tee sure

veillance, ;

: Further project changes took place in 1966 when the LILYRIC
basehouse was relocated to another apartment with approximately the |
same view, In May 1968 the LIMITED basehouse was terminated and
LIEMPTY-6, ‘the basehouse keeper, retired. This affected the LIENTRAP
‘eoverage of Soviet véhicular movement monitored and directed from the
LIMITED basehouse, With the.closing of LIMITED and the Station decision
to replace Raymond H. GERENDE, Mexican national contract agent who
handled the LIEMPTY Project since its inception, the LIENTRAP mobile
surveillance team was underemployed, and the decision was made to move
it to the LIEMBRACE Project, This was done in early 1970, soon after
GERENDE had been relieved of operational responsibilities in December

1969,

The photo processing of the KDFACTOR (formerly LIEMPTY) ~
film take is now being done by the Station, In the past, it was done by
the Station, by GERENDE, and by KDOFACTOR-1, who was terminated
amicably in early 1971, The building housing the KDLITERAL (formerly
LICALLA) photo basehouse was purchased in 1957 by KDABBEY-! for
the Station. KDLITERAL is in a row of four houses all owned ostensibly
by KDABBEY-1 but actually by the Agency. This row also houses a base-
house for FID's KDVAULT Project, The apartment building housing the
KDABSINTHE (formerly LILYRIC) photo basehouse is owned outright by
KDABBEY-1, who has been most cooperative in assisting the Station in
maintaining and occasionally moving (1965 and 1966) photo basehouses,
Th¢ LIMITED photo basehouse was qlso located on KDABBEY-1's property

when it was active, i

The individual basehouse operations are and have always been
compartmented one from the other, The only points of breakdown in the
compartmentation have been: (a) the LIMITED basehouse was linked to
the LIENTRAP mobile surveillance; (b) KDFACTOR-1 was processing
films from all the basehouses and could, therefore, be aware of their
exact locations; (c) GERENDE was aware of all aspects of the KOFACTOR
operation, and has since been terminated; (d) Oliver G. SCANTLING,
Station contract agent retired in 1971, was aware of the KDFACTOR Project

through his past work with LIEMPTY-6 and with GERENDE on KDFACTOR
Project activities; and (e) the fact that the two present basehouse properties
are owned by KDABBEY-1, who is witting of the locations and general
activity of both KDFACTOR basehouses, .

Regarding the security of the above active KDOFACTOR agents,
the. KDLITERAL basehouse is handled by KDFACTOR-2 with the assistance
of his wife) KDFACTOR-10. They have a long-time maid and a 13-year-
old son who lives with them in the basehouse, Neither the son nor the maid
is believed to be witting. The photographic equipment is kept in a locked
room, and the product is kept in a locked safe. KDFACTOR-2 was recruited
by KDCALVERT-1, who is an active, long-term Station agent in the
KDCALVERT Project and who is not considered a threat to KDFACTOR-2's
security. KDFACTOR-2's activities are also known to his brother, the
former LIPSTICK-47, who was one of the two LIPSTICK surveillance team
members arrested in 1958 and who gave the police considerable information
regarding LIPSTICK surveillance activities, LIPSTICK-47 was terminated
in late 1958 and is believed to have withheld from the police the information
regarding KDFACTOR-2 and the KDLITERAL basehouse. KDFACTOR-2
and his family have occupied the KDLITERAL basehouse since 1957 and
have been discreet and security conscious in their dealings with neighbors
and relatives,

i ‘The -KDABSINTHE basehouse is manned by KDFACTOR-S, his
wife KDFACTOR-6, and his two sons KDFACTOR-8 and KDFACTOR:
The. SGSWIRL of 2 March 1966 went into detail on who is witting of
KDFACTOR-5's work for the Station, The result was that his immediate
family, including a married daughter who no longer lives at the basehouse,
are aware of the photographic operation, KDFACTOR-5 was recruited by
LIEMPTY-22, a U., S. citizen with a private company in Mexico City who.
is no longer working with the Station but who ig considered patriotic and
no threat to KDFACTOR security.

4, Terminated Agents Possibly Affecting Present es Security:
A. Raymond H, GERENDE

GERENDE isa ‘Mexican citizen and was a contract agent
until his termination on 26 June 1970, He had been employed by the Station
intermittently since 1955 and was used almost exclusively in support activities,
Since the start of the LIEMPTY Project ‘in 1958 GERENDE had been directly
involved with this project serving as cutout to the basehouses, carrying and
processing films, ..and giving general direction to the project as principal
agent, In'1969, after years of-excellent service with the Station, GERENDE
had serious marital problems which ended in separation from his wife,
KDFACTOR-7. Froth December 1969 to June 1970 GERENDE was not used
operationally but was ‘maintained on half pay with the hope the divorce pro-
ceedings would be completed quickly, When it became apparent the divorce
would drag on interminably, the Station reluctantly terminated GERENDE

- and his wife, Bruce H, FERNALD, career agent, met with GERENDE
monthly from July 1970 through May 1971 while paying him his termination
bonus in ten installments, GERENDE is still living in Mexico City, where
he owns some property and has an income as an English teacher to employees
of two local firms, He visited his wife and children in Holland in December
1970, It appears he may now be financially pressed as his English class
schedule has been cut back, The Station as of 10 April 1972 had no informa-
tion that would indicate GERENDE has violated his secrecy agreement,

There is an indication that GERENDE came to the attention
of the Soviets in 1968; A Mexican walk-in to the FBI office in Mexico City,
who was later interrogated by the Federal Security Police in 1970, said
that in 1968 he had been employed by the Sovict Embassy Second Secretary,
Oleg Masksimovich Nechiporenko (201-305870), to investigate persons
working with the Mexican Olympic Committee. The persons investigated

included GERENDE, who apparently became a specific target of Soviet
investigation, It is unclear from the report of the Federal Security Police
how far the Soviet-iavestigation of GERENDE had proceeded. Nechiporenko
‘was PNG'd from Mexico in March 1971, GERENDE's possible exposure to
the Soviets could have been through his work on the Olympic Committee as
a translator or through his work for the Station, which used him for a wide
range of Support tasks against the Soviet and Cuban targets.

B. KDFACTOR-7 (wife of GERENDE)
KDFACTOR-7 is a Dutch citizen and the former wife of

i GERENDE. She returned to the Netherlands in July 1970 with her children,

She had served as a support agent assisting GERENDE, She is believed
witting, in general terms, of GERENDE’s activities regarding the KDFACTOR
Project. She was-‘terminated on 26 June 1970 and signed both a secrecy
agreement and quit claim, After termination it became apparent that she

had considerable hard feelings toward both the Agency and GERENDE over
financialproblems between her family and GERENDE. While the Station

was not directly involved in all the financial problems, the Station was
involved in regard to her divorce claims against GERENDE's salary, a

large part of which came covertly from the Station, In July 1970 KDFACTOR-7
came to the Agency Headquarters-and complained about her financial settle-
ment, In September and November-.1970 shé wrote two letters directly to

the Agency on the same subject. In late 1970 she also asked a Hague Embassy
political officer to put her in contact with the Agency; however, she did not
tell him the nature of her business, In January 1971 the Agency contacted
KDFACTOR-7's brother, a U. S. Army civilian with a "Top Secret” clearance
living in Alexandria, Virginia, and was able to resolve the financial mis-
understandings with KDFACTOR-7. In January 1971 the Hague Station
reported KDFACTOR had, without Station influence, obtained a job as social
secretary with the Department of State-at the Embassy. It is believed that
this job has probably solved many of her financial problems and should also
inhibit her from exposing her past work with the Mexico City Station, as

such exposure could jeopardize her job, The Embassy in the Hague was.
briefed in general terms on KDFACTOR-7's background,

C. KDFACTOR-!

KDFACTOR-1 is a Mexican citizen and the brother-in-law
of GERENDE. He was hired by the Station in 1956 to assist GERENDE in
processing the photographic take of the KDFACTOR Project (at that time
the LIPSTICK Project and later the LIEMPTY Project). KDFACTOR-1



we

was later assisted in processing the photographie take by his wife,

LIEMPTY-5, whois GERENDE's sister, KDFACTOR-1 was terminated

in March 1971, and the photographic processing previously done by

KDFACTOR-1 is; now doné‘in the Station. The termination was amicable

and largely due to delays in film processing as KDFACTOR-]'s medical

practice expanded, “ There does not appear to be any security problem

in the termination of KDFACTOR-I as he is discreet and also a close

relative of GERENDE, The security of processing the film in KDFACTOR-!'s
medical office was good as KDFACTOR-I's wife, LIEMPTY-5, was assist-

ing him with the processing and with the security of the darkroom.

D, LIEMPTY-5

LIEMPTY-5 was hiréd by the Station in 1957 to assist
KDFACTOR-| with the processing of KDFACTOR films, She is the sister
of GERENDE and wife of KDFACTOR-1l. She was terminated along with
KDFACTOR-1 in March 1971, Due to her close relationship with GERENDE
and KDFACTOR-1, she is not considered a threat to the Project Security.

E, Oliver G. SCANTLING

SCANTLING is a Mexican citizen who worked as a Station
agent from 1954 until his termination without prejudice in February 1971,
SCANTLING is in an excellent financial position and has assisted the
Station in recent-years largely because his strong motivation to work
against the Communists, SCANTLING worked as a surveillance team
leader {rom 1954 to 1957 and then in the LIEMPTY (KDFACTOR) Project
from 1958 through 1966. He was the cut-out to LIEMPTY-6 and a back-up
principal agent for GERENDE, SCANTLING's termination was amicable,
and he is not considered a security problem to the Station or the KDFACTOR

Project,
_F, LIEMPTY-6

LIEMPTY-6, a Mexican citizen and long-term Station
asset, was retired. in May 1968, He had manned the LIMITED photo base-
house with his wife and son assisting him, He had been working with the
Station since 1954, but age and ill health had reduced his efficiency,
LIEMPTY-6 knows GERENDE and SCANTLING, but is not aware of the
names or locations of any of the present KDFACTOR agents and basehouses,
While he could give information on his participation in KDFACTOR activities
up to 1968, he has no motive to do this and is apparently happily retired on
his Agency termination bonus plus some financial assistance from his son-
in-law. He is not considered a threat to the security of this Project.

SECRET



= ce 2 |

There was one indication that the Soviets were seeking

“» out the-LIMITED photo’ basehouse and may have had suspicions. concerning
LIEMPTY-6, This was a report by KDADAGE-10 that in mid-1966 Stanislav
Sergeyevich Silnikov (201-271103), a Soviet Embassy guard, asked KDADAGE-
10 to report on his neighbors near the Soviet Embassy, Silnikov expressed
interest-in all the occupants of the new apartment building which houses the
KDABSINTHE photo basehouse,. but did not mention the KDABSINTHE base-
house keepers by ‘name. Silnikov did name specific persons he was inter-
ested in and these included LIEMPTY-6, KDADAGE-10, of unknown .
reliability, said he did not give Silnikov any information, ‘but added that,
between himself and the Station, he suspected LIEMPTY-6 and had heard
it rumored he worked for the Americans, In 1966 Headquarters already
assumed the Soviets were aware of the LIMITED basehouse because it was
used for radio direction of the LIENTRAP mobile surveillance, In any’ case,
the Soviets apparently took no action prior to the closing of the LIMITED
basehouse and the relocation of LIEMPTY-6 in May 1968, It is believed
this incident has no implications that would threaten the security of current

KDFACTOR assets,
5.. Current KDFACTOR Security Practices:

The two photo basehouses, KDLITERAL and KDABSINTHE
remain compartmented, as they-have been throughout the history of the
Project. The Station case officer responsible for the project meets weekly
with KDFACTOR-2, responsible for the KDLITERAL basehouse, and with
KDFACTOR-5, responsible for the KDABSINTHE basehouse, In these
meetings he picks up the product, provides new supplies, pays salaries
and handles miscellaneous administrative matters, These are car meetings
usually held in early morning or at night and the pickup puints are changed
regularly. Meeting time is kept toa minimum and meetings are pre-
Scheduled whenever possible. The photographic product is processed in
the Station, thus increasing the security and timeliness of its handling
over the past practice of having KDFACTOR-! process it in his office
darkroom, The case officer only meets with KDFACTOR-2 and KDFACTOR-5;
however, in‘emergencies other witting family members of either basehouse
¢an be contacted and met, In case the present sites or personnel are com-
promised, the Station has rented another apartment in the building housing
the KDABSINTHE basehouse and has installed members of the KOCALVERT
Project as residents, This new apartment offers as good a vantage point

considerable overlap between LILYRIC and LIMITED report ing,
and with the closing of LINITZD, Lhe LULYRIC working hours
were extended slightly so that Cull vorking hours of the
FJSTEAL installation continued to be covered, ‘The only
disadvantage fo this arrangement is that the vantare point

LINTTLD and LILYRIC will now go uncoyered during pertods of

2. There have been no changes in the operating procedures
and techniques of LUsMPTY-9 in the LICALLA baschouse, The
refinements described in the previous Project Cutline have
been etfective and have been maintained, The same can be
said of LIENTRAP, which has become a much more flexible

tron 1 November 19°7 through 31 December 19GR, the LILYRIC
basehouse provided 15,331 operational photographs and several



thousand pages of physical survetllance reports covering the fe

MEMORANDUM FOR: Assistant Deputy Director Plans
SUBJECT: Supplementary Appropriation for LIEMPTY

It is requested that the figures in the attached
field-project renewal be amended and that an additional
$26,205 be approved to cover the period 1 December 1968
through 30 June 1969. in order to carry the LIEMPTY Project
to the end of a fiscal year. This sum is identical to that
requested for a similar period in 1968 as there is no
present justification for projecting any change in the
financial requirements. The supplement would bring the
cost of LIEMPTY to a total of $69,725 for 19 months.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director for Plans
SUBJECT 3 LIEMPTY Project Renewal

1. Renewal of Project LIEMPTY for the period 1 Decem-
ber 1967 through 30 November 1968 in the amount of $43,520
is hereby requested, $26,205 would be spent in FY 1968 and
$17,315 in FY:1969. The project was budgeted for $45,000 for
FY 1968; funds are available within the Division. Estimated
costs for the coming project year are a little less than the
amount programmed for the previous year and a little more

than what was actually disbursed,

2. LIEMPTY is designed to provide physical surveil-
lance of the Sovict Embassy in Mexico City. It covers three
nearby properties (two in front of the Embassy's sole entrance
and one behind the garden) from which visual and photographic
surveillance are carried. out by experienced personnel. The
project also covers a darkroom where a technician processes
the photographs. In addition to collecting this basic informa-
tion on a primary target, certain of the LIEMPTY personnel
are also available for miscellaneous support tasks, such as
servicing postal boxes, and running fixed and moving surveil-
lances, The photo truck which comes under the project is
used on other targets as well, such as CP members, satellite
embassies, and Latin American exiles. One of the basehouses
is also used as a radio dispatch point for the LIEMBRACE sur
veillance team, but this function has been minimized during
the past year in an effort to prevent Soviet interception of

the signal.
3. a. The Mexican desk asked the appropriate opera-

tional component of SB Division for specific comment on the
value of LIEMPTY, and received the following:

"This rather unique operation has
unquestionably made a major contribu-
tion to the increasingly effective
Soviet Operations program of the
Mexico Station. On the positive
side its principal value lies. in the
identification of the Mexican and

third national contacts of the Soviets,

i i from which we must select and develop

H . the access agents so vital to our oper-

ations against the Soviet human target.

LIEMPTY also provides us with a much

: -elearer picture of the inner relation-

\ ships-and activity patterns within the
Sovict mission itself, which in turn
facilitates effective targeting. The
CE value of a LIENPTY type project as
@ monitor of real and potential agent
contacts is of course obvious, It is
important to note that LIEMPTY is not,

; as might be the case in stations of

! leéser overall capability, a simple

: case of photography (or observation)

HH ‘for the record, Rather it is an import-

: ant facet of a concerted high priority
effort to yet at and recruit individual
Soviets,"

Station reporting has been in a similar vein,
Information produced is largely for operational purposes and
we often lack detail as to specific utility in a given situ-
ation, although we can produce statistics on numbers of photo-
graphs produced and numbers of pages of surveillance notes.
It is clear that the FBI is an interested customer and they
have received from LIEMPTY a great many reports on American
callers at the Soviet Embassy, and valuable support to double

agent operations.

ec. During a conversation on 8 December 1967, the
officer who heads the station's SB section told the branch
that. LIEMPTY is basic and essential to all of his branch's
operational planning, that he “grabs the LIEMPTY material
first thing in the morning" and studies it for leads, evidence
of which Soviet officers have een in the Embassy ana which
ones have been away, who has used which car, who has been talk-
ing to whom or going out of the building with whom, etc. etc,
New additions to the Embassy staff can be tabbed as KGB or
GRU by their associates, their activity patterns and the cars [
they drive. (The I.S. men are often away from the Embassy,
while the legitimate FSO's tend to spend more time in their
offices, The KGB, GRU and regular diplomatic groups seldom
ross lines but stay within their own tight groups.) When

SECRET


-3-

“double agents are turned over from one case officer.to a new
one, known to them only in alias, we are often able, through
surveillance and photographs, to establish the true identity
of the new case officer, as was done in the case of AEGIMMICK

in the spring of 1967.

4. In assessing the security of the operation, the

station assumes that the Soviets realize that they are being
- watched, as was.evidenced by a Soviet officer's trying to
«shield-an FBI-directed walk-in from observation, There have
been rumors that anyone entering the Soviet Embassy is photo-
graphed, but no allegations that the Americans are doing it
have come to our attention; the probable assumption Is that
the Mexicans are doing this. A former source who lives in
the neighborhood was asked on several occasions what he knew
about LIEMPTY/6, one of the safchousekeepers, and the Soviets
have said they think he is watching them. On the security of
the LICALLA safehouse there is a difference of opinion.
GERENDE, the outside case officer, thinks the Soviets are
aware that they are being observed from this post, but station
disagrees and produces good justification for its views, cit-
ing the fact that the above-mentioned FBI walk-in was not
shielded when led into the back garden which LICALLA overlooks,
We have no evidence that Sovict interest is any threat to the
operation; rather 1t may be assumed that they accept the sur-

veillance as a fact of life.

cae PROJECT _LIEMPTY

REQUEST FOR RENEWAL =,
. ft \
CURRENT OBJECTIVES i

A. The overall objective of Project LIEMPTY, now in its tenth
year of existence, is to collect operational information on the
FISTEAL installation, its personnel and visitors, as well as
related targets of opportunity (hrough stationary/mobile photo=
graphic and physical surveillance mechanisms, Corollary
objectives which are to be fulfilled through use of the LIEMPTY
installations, mechanisms and. personnel are as follow:

1. To provide detailed operational information pertaining
to the daily movements and activities of the FJSTEAL
personnel, particularly those individuals of intelJigence
interest, as well as information on the FJSTEAL physical

Plant and visitors to the premises,

2. To collect operatioual information on persons associated
with FJSTEAL personnel and on individuals known or suspected
to have connections with the FJSTEAL intelligence services

or other hostile groups which are inimical to the interests

of LNFORT.

3. To provide operational support, counter surveillance
and/or other protective services to WOFIRM personnel and
operations, as may be levied upon the Station or as may be

deemed necessary,

B, The above objectives dre to be fulfilled through continued
maintenance and exploitation of the LIMITED, LILYRIC and LICALLA
basehouses, the LIENTRAP mobile unit, and the services of long-
time contract agent, Raymond H, GERENDE. These objectives are
in consonance with operational directives and Headquarters
requirements as received by Station Mexico City. :

C. Throughout the Project year under review, Project LIEMPTY
continued to contribute directly and significantly to the fulfil-
lment of Station and Headquarters' requests and requirements for
coverage of various targets falling within the above cited frame-
work, During the project year Project LIEMPTY provided nearly
all of the operational photographs and physical surveillance
reports used in Mexico City Station's operations targeted against
the FJSTEAL installdtion and personnel. Specific examples of the
LIEMPTY Project's progress and contributions will be found in
Section 3 below (EFFECTIVENESS).

CHANGES .

A. Operational - Since the institution of the changes described
in the previous renewal request, it has not been found neces=
sary or desirable to make further mayor changes, The following
minor changes in operational technique have been made in an
effort to obtain continued improvement in the finished product:

1, LIEMPTY-9's proven effectiveness as an observer (see
paragraph 3 A (3) below) has enabled us to institute a

Bystem of special coverage on specific FJSTEAL personnel

of interest, or special coverage of specific time periods,

of interest. The purpose is to permit the Station to gain
greater insights into.the activities and personal associations
of certain individuals, or in overall activities during a
certain time period, No ctange in LIEMPTY-9's overall
working hours has been made; rather, flexibility has been

introduced,

2, Flexibility has also Leen introduced into the handling
of L TRAP, which is now vorking more closely with the
LIEMBRACE team in order to-take greater advantage of targets
of opportunity, To this end, LIENBRACE~1 has been placed

in direct contact with LIENTRAP, relieving Raymond H, GERENDE
of this responsibility and permitting GERENDE to devote time
to MHRAVEL activity (see sub-paragraph (3) below).

3. Ie September and October 1967 GERENDE was employed by
the Mexican MHRAVEL committee, This position gave him direct
access to FJSTEAL and other delegations of interest, and
“supplemented the Station's MHRAVEL program, It is expected
that GERENDE will obtain MERAVEL employment.again in 1968,

B. Financial - LIKYPTY-4 and ~1l were granted salary increases
effective 1 July 1967, Memoranda of ‘Oral Commitment were for-
warded to Headquarters in HMMA-32584 and HMMA-32585, 20 July
1967. There was no change in the salaries of the remaining

LIEMPTY agents,
Cc. Personnel = None.

EFFECTIVENESS:

Throughout the period under review, each operational component
of Project LIEMPTY contributed actively and concretely to the
fulfillment of the operational tasks levied on Station Mexico
City, High-lights of the accomplishments and the achievements

of each component are cited below:



‘A. Fixed Basehouses

1, LIMITED

Throughout the past project year the LIMITED installations
provided daily photographic Coverage and physical surveil=
lance of the main gate of the FJSTEAL installation, In
addition, the LIMITED base Provided for a fixed radio
dispatching station which was used to support the LIEMBRACE
surveillance team, Due to the stringent security measures
dnstituted in the immediate vicinity of the FJSTEAL instal-
lation by local security forces, normal stake-outs by this
ufilateral team are precluded. However, with the radio
dispatching support from the LIMITED radio base, which
allows the LIEMBRACE team to work trom adjacent safe areas,
secure surveillance coverage of this target can be provided.
During the 12-month period from 1 November 1966 through

31 October 1967, the LIMITED base provided 1,834 frames of
operational photographs, lm addition, the LIMITED base
Provided over 2,500 pages cI physical surveillance reports.

2. LILYRIC

During the project year under review, the LILYRIC installation
provided extensive photographic and fixed visual surveillance
of the front of the FJSTEAL installation, The LILYRIC base
Provided the majority of the operational photographs produced
by the LIEMPTY project, During the 12-month period cited

in the LIMITED section aboye, the LILYRIC base provided
12,137 operational photographs and several thousand pages

of physical surveillance reports covering the daily move-
ments of all FUJSTEAL officers.

3. LICALLA

During the above cited 12-sonth period, the LICALLA instal-
lation provided photograph:¢ and physical surveillance
coverage of the back of the FJSTEAL installation and its
garden and patio area, Th:S coverage provided 4,917 indi-
vidual photographs as well. as numerous surveillance and
observation reports, It stould be noted that the LICALLA
base allows Station Mexico City to observe the FJSTEAL
personnel during their off-duty and recreational hours.

The LICALLA installation heS become the most valuable of the
three, not only because of its unique vantage point but also
because of the perceptiveness of LIEMPTY-9, His surveil-
lance reports have frequently given us valuable insight
‘into personal associations among the FJSTEAL personnel and
have enabled us to introduce greater flexibility and
effectiveness into the entire LIEMPTY operation,



omy

B. Summary of Fixed Basehouse Effectiveness

The fixed LIEMPTY basehouses (LIMITED, LICALLA and LILYRIC)
provided approximately 18,888 individual frames of oper-
Ztional photographs diring the 12-month period of the past
project year, This photographic coverage, linked with the
physical surveillance reports prepared by each basehouse,
has proven to be a nost reliable and viable tool for:

1. Following the daily comings and goings of,
FJSTEAL personnel and indigenous employees,

2, Confirming the identities of FJSTEAL staffers
and their visitors (some of whom are WOLADY citizens},

3. Ascertaining and verifying the relative rank and
position as well as indicating the specific intelligence
service connection of various FJSTEAL officers,

4, Providing detailed reporting on the movement and
habit patterns of selected targets of special interest,

5. Providing physical facilities for the support of
various operational, technical and surveillance

operavions.

C. The Mobile Photographic Unit

1. » Throughout the period under review, the LIENTRAP mobile
photographic support unit was regularly exploited and used

by Station Mexico City, not only on the FJSTEAL target, but
also for PBRUMEN and Commucist Party operations as well as
the JMTIGER program, Over 2,000 operational photographs were
provided, In addition, the LIENTRAP personnel and unit

was used regularly to service and obtain various postal
accomodation boxes used by Mexico City, Headquarters and
other field stations,

D. Raymond H, GERENDE - LIEMPTY Principal Agent

During the period under review, with the exception of short
vacation periods, Raymond H, GERENDE, continued in his role
as the Project LIEMPTY principal agent, GERENDE operated
as the fulj-time cut-out to the LIEMPTY, LILYRIC and LICALLA
basehouses and bore the first echelon agent handling respon-
sibility for the related personnel, In addition, GERENDE

ee



6.

continued to bear the contact and handling responsibilities
Of the LIENTRAP unit (until mid-August 1967 - see paragraph
2 A.{2) above) and for the operator of the LIEMPTY photo-
graphic developing/processing laboratory, LIEMPTY-4.
GERENDE's overall operatioral assignment involved at least
12 clandestine meetings per week, in addition to his
meetings with the LIEMPTY Froject case officer, It should
also be noted that GERENDE made numerous and essential
‘contributions to the sensitive AMROD operation and assisted
the Station greatly with his detailed area knowledge in
many“instances, . He is frequently used to make independent
investigations and neighborhood checks, As noted above,

he contributed significantly to the Station's MHRAVEL
program, Finally, he apprcached, developed and eventually
attempted to recruit an agent for use in PBRUMEN operations,

E. Overall Effectiveness

As outlined above, each incividual operational component

of the LIEMPTY Project contributed regularly and significantly
to the fulfillment of Station Mexico City's operational
program, Based on the continued excellent performance and
overall contributions of this project, the Station strongly
recommends that this project be continued during the forth~
coming project year as an essential element of the Station's
operational support apparatus,

PROBLEMS AND SECURITY

During the project year under review there were no known inci-~
dents which adversely affected the security of Project LIEMPTY
or the related personnel,

LIAISON AND _INTER-AGENCY COORDINATION
Not applicable to Project LIEMPTY.

PLANS

A. As noted above, the technical and operational changes
made in the past year have been effective and have resulted
in a product which is as closely geared to operational
requirements as possible, While no major changes are
contemplated, every effort will be made to continue to
improve the product, including greater use of GERENDE as
an independent investigative asset, and as a spotter and
assessor of selected agent candidates. Such utilization
of GERENDE will be kept compartmented from other personnel
of the LIEMPTY project and will normally be handled by
GERENDE in operational alias,



m

a

ch.

B. The LIENTRAP vehiclo has been replaced, and no mafor
changes in personnel or material are contemplated. Salaries
of LIEMPTY-personnel will ve reviewed, and it is foreseen that
the rising cost of living vill compel us to recommend salary
increases for certain. of tle agents who have not received

raises in some time.

costs : . :
A, Past Project Year = Project LIEMPTY was previously approved
for the period 1 December 1966 through 30 November 1967 for the
amount of 45,000 U.S. currency, Station records indicate that
through 31 October 1967, Project LIEMPTY has expended 37,040 in ...
the field, ‘It is estimated that a total of 40,130 will be expended
in the entire project year, Bi-weekly accountings witn pertinent
receipts and/or certifications were submitted by Raymond H, GERENDE
to the Station finance orficer via the project case officer for all_
LIEMPTY Project expenditures made in the field. It is estimated

that approximately 5 hours of case officer and 10 hours of analyst
time is required each week to fulfill the operational, administrative
and analytical requirements of this project. (This figure does not
include the 40 hour-week put in regularly by Raymond H, GERENDE).

B, During Project Year - It is requested that Project LIEMPTY be
approved in the amount of 43,520 U.S. currency for the period 1 ~~
December 1967 through 30 November 1968 (this figure represents a *
slight decrease from the amount programmed for the previous project
year). While no large expenditures are anticipated for the replace-
ment of photographic equipment during the forthcoming period, an
increase in the rental af the various basehouses may be encountered
as well as the above-cited expectation of salary increases. Of the
amount requested above, 26,205 dollars should be allowed for fiscal
year 1968 and 17,315 dollars for fiscal year 1969, A detailod break-
down of the project expenditure by category and by fiscal year follows:

C. As in the past, Raymond H. GERENDE will submit bi-weekly
accountings for all project expenditures with appropriate

foreign currency beyond the Station's capability to provide,

EMERGENCY CONDITIONS

A. In the event of civil disorders or the evolution of complete
enforced neutrality on the part of the host government, it is
now believed that regular operational contact could be maintained
with the majority of the active LIEMPTY agents via Raymond H,
GERENDE or in his absence, Oliver G. SCANTLING.

B. In the most unlikely event of the establishment of a regime
openly hostile to LNFORT, limited contact could probably be
maintained with the majority of the active project agents,
However, under the circumstances described above, it is highly
probable that the activities of this project would be somewhat

curtailed,



SK

C. Revised and up-dated emergency contact plans for use with
Raymond H. GERENDE and Olivor G. SCANTLING are on file in the
Station and at Headquarters (see HMMA-28333, dated 21 February

1966 and HMMA-28252, dated 9 February 1966).

The CI Staff concurs in the renewal of this very
valuable Project. The Staff strongly urges the Station to
continue its close monitoring of Soviet interest in the
installation buildings and attempts to obtain information on
sensitive project personalities. ‘The Station should devise
necessary contingency plans of action to eliminate any
securjty hazards if it is determined that the Soviets are
intensifying such efforts and could be getting "too close"to

A, The overall objective of Project LIEMFTY, now in its ninth year of ex
istence, is te collect: operational inforwaticn on the LDGRICK installation,
its personnel shi visitors, as well as releted tarsets cf opportunity
through staticnery/aobile photosraphic and physical survetllence mechantsus,
Corollary oblectives which are to be’fulfilled through use of the LIEPIY
installations, wechanisas and personnel are as follow:

1. To provide detailed operational inforsation pertaining to the
@aily aovesents and activities of the LIKERICK personnel, particularly
those intividuals of intelligence interest, as well as inforaation

on the LDGRICK physical plant and visitors to the preaises.

2, To collect operationel inforsation on persons associated with
LIMEBRISE personnel and on individuals known or suspected to have
connections with the LIMSRICK intellisence services or other hostile

groups vhich are inimical to the interests of LYTS.

3. To previde operational support, counter surveillsace end/or other
"ACT personnel and operaticns, a3 say be

B. The above chjectives are to be fulfilled throush continued aaintenance

Project's progress and contributions to the RMD will be found in Section 3

Wbelow (ZPFECTIVEXESS).

SraNass,

A. Operationsl = As noted in the ‘previous Request for-Project Renéwal,
the foraer LISITND property ves sold to LIKCUSIIE, who as per foranl earee-

ment with the Station, deaolished the oli structure and cons‘ructed a new
edifice. While it vas. initially contesplated to-place the LIMITED ~
(LIMTYs ~b and -7) personnel in the new building and to retein the same,
equal divigion of vorklood between LILYRIC sna LIMITED, ae wa» later’
acciued to move the present LILYRIC basehouse personnel (LIEMPTYs-13, -14,
26 and -27) into the new base inctead, along vith the following anci:
modifications

An increase in the hours of both the photosrephic and physical surveillence
coverage provided from the new base by the LILYRIC operztors (cé00-1509
hours) during the weekdays anl to have the LDQTED base provide
Photographic and ‘sical surveillance coverage froa 1600-1630 hours

oa weekdays and fron 0990-1300 hours on weekends. ‘These changes were
dictated by the followin; considerations:

1, The new LIMOUSINE building offers a much better vaatage point
for both photographic and phyoicel surveillance than does the
present complex which housen the LILYRIC end LIMITED bases.
‘Therefore, the Station felt that the personnel occupying this
new base should be those possessing the hishest technicel skills
and also those able to provide the eost thorough ani coaplete
coverase. Since the LIMITS) base now has only one trained
operator while the LILYRIC basehouse hes tavee, the LILYRIC groug
and a revision of working hours was indicatel.

2, Because it was epparent that the coverage of the LIMERICK
Installation would be a long-range end continuing requireaent,
the Station desired to steff the new bese with personnel of long=
range potential, LIZWPTY-6, now alacst EC years clt, does not
possess this potentiel; hovever, the LILYRIC ageat cozplex
happily coabines experienced personnel with youthful agents.

3. Finally, the social and financisl status of the LILmic
Personnel {$ much wore compatible and consistent wita tie en-
vironzent of the nev building than is that of the LIMITA fsetly.

During the pertol under review, with the exception of short vacation
periods, Raywond MN, ‘GERAD, continued in hio role as the Project
LIBPIY principal agent, GEREMDS operated as the full-tine cut-out
to the LISMPIY, LILYRIC and LICALLA basehounen and bore the first

. echelon agent handling responsibility for the related persomel. In
addition, GERENDE continued to pear the contact ani handling ren-
Ponsibilitien of the LISMRAP wit and for the operator of the LIEMPIY
Photographic developing/processing laboratory, LISOTY-+, GERENDS's
overall cperationsl assignnent involved at least 19 clandestine aeetings

E. Cvernl uffectiveness

As outLined above, each individual operatioasl coaponent of the LIEXPTY
Project contributed regularly and significantly to the fulfilleent of
Station Mexico City's operational prozvea, Based on the continued
excellent perforeance and overell ccntributions of this project, the
Station strongly recoenends thet this project be continued during the
forthcoaing project year as an essential eleaent of the Station's

operational support apparatus, ,

During the Project year unler review there vere no know Incidents which
adversely affected the security of Project LIEMPY or the related personnel.
The only significant provlea encounterai in the operation and adainistration
of this project ateavet froa the physical sove of the LILYRIC personnel to
the new base in the LIMOUSINE buflilne. Iiserous delays arising fro the
faulty perforasace of the local coatractors and construction crews hempered
a tisely relocation of this base, However, it is anticipated that the new

ae “1. The LIEMPTY Project Renewal request forwarded in
reference, was approved on 29 January 1965 for the period
1 Deceniber. 1964 through 30 November 1965 for a total of
$45,300; $27,675 for FY 1965 and $17,625 for FY 1966.

2.° At the time of approval, ‘Assistant KUDOVE stated
he expects this project to live within the sum authorized
for the year, and that there will be no amendment for

additional funds.

“3, As you were informed in HMMW 19282 in the dispatch
on the LIEMBRACE Project Renewal, KUTUBE is interested in
the problem of hostile monitoring of any radio communications
from LIMITED, You should remain alert to this problem, and
inform us if Headquarters can be of any assistance in helping
you maintain communications security.

4, You are reminded that the LIEMPTY Project, a8 approved,
only covers the salary for Oliver G. SCANTLING through 31 May
1963, It is suggested that a separate project be written to
cover SCANTLING if his new duties do not fall entirely under

any other approved project.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, EXO
SUBJECT : Project LIEMPTY

Renewal of this project is recommended. This
operation continues to carry out the same type of
activity 1t has engaged in for a number of years
and its product continues to be important to our
efforts against the Soviets and Communist Party in
Mexico. The Station should carefully select the
new erational assignment of Oliver G. ECANTLING
60 to make best use of this long-time asset's
considerable clandestine experience.

Review of Project LIEMPTY
(For the Purpose of Project Renewal)

L CURRENT OBJECTIVES AND PRODUCTION
A, Oliver G. SCANTLING Segment (discussed tn relation to Project
objectives):

teth

Bivens

1, "To collect operational information pertaining to LIMERICK
personnel and physical facilities," SCANTLING has continued (See the
last two Project Revtews forwarded as attachments to HMMA- 14093,

13 November 1959, and HMMA-15979, 18 November 1960) to provide
worthwhile information pertaining to this objective,

a, During the past year SCANTLING has continued to be
used to follow up leads produced by LIENVOY. For example,
operational information recently indicated that the LIMERICK
target was using the services of a Mexico Clty firm to repair
safes, Through discreet investigation SCANTLING was able to:
identify the firm, its location and the name of the owner In the |
event that we later wished to make an approach to him or to
exploit this information in another manner,

b, SCANTLING Is still the Station’s primary source S for
keeping current records on the residences of the many LIMERICK
personnel in Mexico City. ‘This is accomplished in several ways;
the most important being SCANTLING's follow up of all LIENVOY
leads which Indicate the LIMERICK people are interested in
renting a given piece of property, (Sce previous project renewal
request for additional detatls), i

2, “To collect operational information pertaining to other targets
of opportunity, foretgn official installations and personnel of intelligence
interest operating in Mexico."" SCANTLING is very useful for collecting
information on other Station targets: '

-2-

a, On the basis of a request to the Statlon from the
ODACID Chief, SCANTLING was sent to Puebla to be an
eyewitness to the 4 June 1961 Catholic inspired antt-CASTRO
demonstrations, Not only did SCANTLING obtain the desired
information, and samples of many‘of the leaflets used, but he
prepared his report for the Station in time for the COS to give
the ODACID Chief a briefing at 1000 hrs,, 5 June 1961.
SCANTLING does an excellent job on this type of assignment
due principally to his ability to observe and report objectively,

b, SCANTLING was instrumental tn establishing that
Fernando LLANES Cavero and his wife were living at a local
Mexico City address, This case has been of considerable
counterespionage Interest to Headquarters,

c. SCANTLING has continued his contributions to the
Paul Frederick KIRSCHHOFF case by periodic interviews with
the subject's neighbors and associates,

3. "To exploit operational leads through recruitments, debriefings,
and surveillances,"" SCANTLING has contributed to this objective both
directly and indirectly as will be noted by the examples listed below:

a,’ SCANTLING devoted a lot of time to the
surveillance and attempted recruitment of Abel ARTEAGA, a
Mexican national employed at the Cuban Embassy, SCANTLING
talked with ARTEAGA several times and undoubtedly was
primarily responsible for the later success of the recruicment
made by another Statlon agent,

b, Some additional time was devoted to the Cesar
GONZALEZ Sanchez case in February 1961 when SCANTLING
determined that GONZALEZ was still in Mexico Clty, See
the last renewal for additional details on this case,

©. In connection with the above objective SCANTI.ING
has performed numerous pretext and neighborhood Investigations
for the Station, SCANTLING also does most of the local
investigations requested by ODACID and other ODYOKE
components,

SECRET/RES8K


SECRET /JEBE
-3-

d, SCANTLING spent six weeks during July and
August of this year giving tradecraft and surveillance
- training to LIPAILS 5 and 7 from Monterrey, Although
this ts.not a direct contribution to the above objective, it
is considered sufficiently related to mention here,

4, In addition to his contributions to the above objectives,

: SCANTLING ts used for misccllancous support requirements from the
Station, For example, SCANTLING is now handling LIEM3ROIL-2 and

will continue to do so until the return of LIMOTOR-14 in June 1962, Also,
during the past project year, SCANTLING handled the LIRICE surveillance

, team until July 1961 when Simon D, CLACKETT (ps) returned to Mexico

City, SCANTLING Is also used to spot and rent safe houses and apartments
for other Station operations,

5. As stated In the preceeding Requests for Project Renewal,
although SCANTLING's LIEMPTY Project objectives can never be completely
fulfilled, It. ts the Station's opinion that SCANTLING has made important and
valuable contributions to LIEMPTY Project objectives specifically and to
other Station activities tn general, SCANTLING's production, measured
against monetury expenditures, case officer time and other intangible factors,
unquesttonably justifies his continuation as an integral part of Project

LIEMPTY,
B. Raymond H, GERENDE Segment (discussed in relatlon to project

objectives):

1, "To collect operational information pertaining to LIMERICK
personnel and physical facilittes through use of photographic base houses,"
‘Three photographic bases, LIMITED, LILYRIC and LICALLA, contribute
to this objective, To avoid repetition, the Station is omitting the usual
description of the functions of these three bases and how they contribute
to the above objective. “There has heen no change tn the coverage as
described In the 1960 Request for Project Renewal,

2, “To collect operational information and identify operational

leads pertaining to Station targets cf opportunity." The LIENTRAP
operation, handled by GERENDE, Is still the major contributor to this

SECRET


+ SECRET 2K
-4-

objective. Ia addition to performing numerous photographic assignments
in support of other Station ‘operations, LIENTRAP devoted nearly four
months, on a fulltime basis, to coverage of the LIERODE operation, For
several weeks the entire "take" from the LIERODE target was recorded
from the LIENTRAP vehicle, Later, the LIENTRAP agents operated the
LIERODE technical gear from the initial LIERODE stationary base.

3. “To provide operational support to Station operativas, i.e. ,
rent hotel rooms.and apartments, and conduct counter-surveillances, "
GERENDE is used frequently to rent hotel rooms and apartments for other
Station operations and activities, GERENDE's comprehensive area
knowledge and personal operational capabilities combine to make him an
extremely valuable Station asset for such support activities, GERENDE
also procures and services post office box letter drops for the many
Station operations requiring them,

4, The quality and quantity of operational information produced
by the photographic bases and other activities under GERENDE's control
and supervision is considered worthwhile. The Station concludes, therefore,
that this segment of the LIEMPTY Project should be continued,

C, Relationship to Related Mission Directive Objectives:

As scared in the previous project renewal, it can readily be noted
that Project LIEMPTY has provided support to many Station operations and
in this manner has been a contributing factor to the furthereance of the
Related Mission Directive, The project has not produced any positive
intelligence nor has it been intended that it should do so, The project's sole
purpose is to provide a mechanism for the development of operational
{nformation in support of other Station operations,

Th. CHANGES .

There have been no changes in the LIEMPTY Project during the past project
year except that SCANTLING relinquished control of the LIRICE (formerly LIJERSEY)
surveillance team in July 1961 in accordance with previous plans,

TU, EFFECTIVENESS —____-

i There has been no change in Project LIEMPTY which would alter the
validity of the remarks made In Section III of last year's project renewal request, °

IV, PROBLEMS

The security problem in connection with the LICALLA operation, which
was described in last year's renewal request, is still present but has not caused
any known difficulty, At Headquarters suggestion in HMMW-9736, the LICALLA
base was reactivated on 29. May.1961, ‘The base operator has been cautioned to be
ever alert for any unusual.incidents which might indicate that the base has been
compromised, This is the only problem experienced by the LIEMPTY Project
during the past project year,

ve PLANS

: The Station considers that the project is now operating at Its optimum size
and does not plan to expand it during the coming year, Rather, efforts will be
devoted to refining and better utilizing the existing project organizational
arrangements,

vi. COSTS

A. Past Project Year - Station finance records indicate that Project LIEMPTY
expended $21, 458.00 during Fiscal Year 1961 (1 December 1960 - 30 June 1961) and
has thus far during Fiscal Year 1962 (through 30 September 1961) expended about
$11,000.00, It is anticipated that abour $8,000.00 will be expended during the last
two months (October and November 1961) of the project.year. This will make a
total expenditure during the project year of about $40, 500.00, or some $12, 500,00 ‘
under the budget estimate of $53,000.00,

B, Ensuing Period - Of the total $49, 500.00 budget, itemized below,
$29, 500.00 should be expended during the remainder of Fiscal Year 1962 and the

. balance, $20,000.00 should be expended during Fiscal Year 1963. Normal accounting

procedures will be used for all expenditures,

REVIEW OF PROJECT LISNPTY
(For the Purpose of Project Renewal)

CURSENT CBJECTIVES AND PRODUCTION

Qliver G. SCANTLING Segment (discussed in relation
to project objectives):

1, "To collect operational information per=
taining to LINERICK personnel and physical
facilities." SCANTLING has continued (See the
last Project Review forwarded as an attachment
to HA-14093, 13 November 1959) to provide
worthwhile and significant information per=-
taining to the above objective. There follow
e@ few exanples of SCANTLING's production:

@ A detailed casing of the LIMERICK
electrical power supply was forwarded

to Headquarters as an attachnent to
HrOtA-14496, 12 February 1960. The pro=
duction of this type of operational
information, which takes several weeks
to compile accurately, illustrates the
unusual talents possessed by SCANTLING
together with his valuable contributions
to the Station's operational information
collection effort.

b. SCANTLING has been used frequently

to follow up leads produced by LIFEAT/
LINSRICK (now produced by LIENVOY). For
example, in May 1960, LIFSAT indicated

that the LIMERICK target was having con-
siderable contact with an AGENCIA ROBLES
concerning the handling of incoming and
outgoing shipments. By discreet investi~
gation, SCANTLING was able to provide the
Station with additional pertinent information
about the address, owner and type of business
engaged in by the firm, Such information
then becomes readily available for exploitation
should a LIMERICK shipment of oarticular
interest come to the attention of the Station.

ce. SCANTLING is the Station's primary
investigative asset for keeping track of
current residence addreseees of LIMERICK
persornel, The Station considers it important
from the counterespionage standpoint to main-

‘Veontion

tain information the lecation ef all

gs cory



an ‘ : ~
Siva / bbved Wed

we

LIMERICK residences. In addition, specific
targeto are continually considered for LICOOL
installations, A recent example of SCALTLING's

efforts in this cornection wuld be the spot-
ting and acquisition of the LIMOTCR base in
the same apartment building with LITALOK <1,
Contributions of this type operational informa-
‘tion are quite time consuring due to the
necessity for checking cut several apartmenta
that a LIMERICK individual may initially be
considering as a residence.

2. "fo collect cperational information pertaining to
other targets of opportunity, foreign official installe~
tions and personnel of intelligence interest operating
in Mexico." Aa indicated below, SCANTLING is also
extremely useful for collecting information on le

other than LIMERICK:

@- In March 1960 SCANTLING was instrumental
in locating property adjecent to the LITABBY
installation which the Stetion hae since

rented in anticipation of initiating photo~
grephic and technical operations, SCANTLING ~
was able to accomplish this assignment only
after a thorough casing and pretext investi-
gations of the several pieces of property
appropriate for such operations.

be SCAITLING is also used to follow up
sensitive leads in connection with LIFEAT
and LIENVOY production from LITABBY and
sister + gets (See exemple as to type
under I,A,1, b and ¢ above).

Ce SCAMTLING was uscd ec an investigative

asset to determine the local address Pend
exact employment of Gordon William CROVES
(201~220025), a counterespionage case of
interert to Headquarters and ODENVY.

3. “To exploit operational leads through recruitments
debriefings, and surveillances.” As exanples o.
SCANTLING's contribution to this objective, the
following cases are listed:

a. SCANTLING devoted a considerable amount
of time to his attempts to locate Cesar
GONZALEZ Sanchez, a known agent of a Com
munist Country. He followed various leads
on GONZALEZ from March ae Auguat 1966 bvefore



<i
3

GONCALES was finally identified and his

Mexico City home aid business addresses were

ascertained, See HNMA-15626, 9 September 1960, ‘
for further -details.on this case.

de. The preliminary investigative work on a
KUSCDA cace of priority interest was conducted
by SCANTLING. During this investigation it

was necessary for SCANTLING to travel to
Aquascalientes, Gusnajuate md Minatitlan to
obtain the information required by Headquarters,
Sce the attachments to Wo"T-1416, 20 May 1960,
for the results of the investigation,

4 In addition to his contributions to the above objec»
tives, SCANTLING is used for miscellaneous support
requirements of the Station. For exarple, SCAKTLING
handled several of Raymond H. GEREKDE's (ps) operations
while the latter was away from Mexico City during August
end September 1960, Also, SCANTLING has been managing
the LIJERSLY surveillance team since the departure of
Simon D. CLACKETT in August 1960, It is hoped that
SCANTLING can be relieved of thie assignment as soon

as the LITEMPO project is approved. SCANTLING has also
deen used to spot and rent safe houses for various
Station operations, a valuable operational support

services

5. As stated in the preceeding Request for Project
Renewal, al though SCANTLINc's LIE.PTY Project objectives
can never be completely fulfilled, it is the Station's
opinicen that SCANTLING hes made inportant and valuable
contributions to LIEMPTY Project objectives specifically
and to other Station activities in generdl. SCANTLING's

- production, measured against monetary expenditures,

produstio:

case officer time and other intangible factors, uiqucs—
ticnably justifies his continuation as m integral part

of Froject LIEMPLY.
Raymond H. GEREXDE Segment (discussed in relation to project

objectives):

1. "To collect operational inforration pertaining to
LIMERICK personnel and physical facilities through ‘use
of photographic base houses." Together with their
extensive photographic coverace orf the LIMERICK target,
the photographic bases also contribute other types of
operational information: !

® LIMITED - This base cozpiles daily logs '
indicating all arrivals, demrtures and, .
where possible, identities of every person
visiting or working at the LI CK target.



“ ‘This information ts particularly useful in keeping track of

“SECRET ARO

LIMERICK personnel and assisting with the identification of
visitors to the installation, Also, LIMITED maintains a
summary attendance list of LIMERICK employees on a daily
basis; this enables the Station quickly to ascertain the
presence or absence of an employee on any given day,

. Finally, one other significant service ts performed by this

base, the radio dispatching of the LIEMBRACE surveillance
team on LIMERICK personnel and targets of opportunity,
LIMITED's photographic coverage is still concentrated on
visltors, as opposed to employees, to the LIMERICK
installation, A recent example of the base's contributions to
Station efforts is the case of Joseph Ralph MAURI. In this
case, a LIENVOY lead indicated that an American might visit
the LIMERICK target on a certatn day, The base was alerted
to dispatch the radio-controlled survetllance team on any
person appearing to be an American, The results of this
assignment were Indicated in MEXI-6392 and several other
cables, LIMITED was also able to provide photographs,
which when compared with photographs provided by Head-
quarters, left no question as to MAURI's identity,

b, LILYRIC - This base's output of high-quality clandestine
photographs has been in about the same quantity as last year,
In addition, the base operator, LIEMPTY-I4, prepares A beaed
reports on LIMERICK empioyees and their wives, 1.
diou performs the assignment of noting and reporting
lcense plate numbers of all cars bringing visitors to the’
LIMERICK installation, LILYRIC photograplis also are con-
centrated on visitors to the target, as opposed to employees,
It should be noted that LILYRIC operates for photographic
coverage during the hours from daylight to.1400 hours each
day of the week except Sunday, The LIMITED base maintains
photographic coverage from 1400 hours to darkness each day
except Sunday,

c, LICALLA - As reported in previous correspondence, the
LICALLA base contributes to the collection of operational
information through photographic coverage of LIMERICK
employees and their families, Also, the base operator,

SECRET seen


SECRET/Nggg>

-S-

LIEMPTY-9, supplies extremely worthwhile information
pertaining to the apparent positions and jobs of the target
employees, -He accomplishes thts objective by careful
observation and analysis, LICALLA also maintains a dally
attendance roster of all LIMERICK employees, LICALLA
coverage of the target, both photographic and physical
observations, enables the Station to keep abrest of LIMERICK
personnel changes, a vital contribution to the Station's counter-
espionage effort,

2. “To collect operational information and tdentify operational leads
pertaining to Station targets of opportunity," The LIENTRAP operation,
handled by GERENDE, {s the major ‘contributor to this objective, It
has been possible for LIENTRAP to take photographs and to perform
pretext investigetions in support of numerous Station activities, The
cases listed below are cited as examples:

a, In the case of Cesar GONZALEZ Sanchez (see I, A, 3,a, above)
LIENTRAP was able to procure photographs of GONZALEZ at his
Mexico City residence which, when compared to Headquarters
provided. photographs, lett no doubt that GONZALEZ was the
subject of interest to Headquarters,

b, LIENTRAP confirmed the Identity of Olga CASTILLO de Ledon,
a frequent visitor to the LIMERICK Installation and an ardent
supporter of the present Cuban regime, through a pretext
investigation of the residents of an apart ment building where
CASTILLO was believed to live, Later, LIENTRAP supported the
results of the investigation with excellent photographs of the
subject, *

3. "To provide operational support to Station operations, i.e., rent
hotel roorns and apartments, and conduct counter-surveillances, "
GERENDE is used frequently to rent hotel rooms and apartments for
other Station operations and activities, GERENDE's comprehensive
area knowledge and personal operattonal capabilitles combine to make
him an extremely valuable Station asset for such support activities,
GERENDE also procures post office box letter drops for the many
Station operations requiring them,

4. It is the Station's conclusion that the money and case officer time
expended on this segment of the LIEMPTY project is worthwhile and
should be continued in view of the quality and quantity of operational
information produced,

“Simon D, CLACKETT Segment (discussed tn relatton'to project

objectives):

1, “To collect operational information aad to identify operational leads
pertalning to the LIMERICK target and Station targets.of opportunity,"
During this project year the LYERSEY surveillance team under the
direction of CLACKETT began contributing to the Station's support
efforts through pretext Investigatlons and physical surveillances, Some
examples of the team's work are sted below:

a, Rafael TISCHLER Guzman (201-64372) is a Guatemalan
Communist which the team had under surveillance from
November 1959 to April 1960, The survelllance, together

with Information acquired from other sources, eventually
resulted in an‘unsuccessful recruitment attempt on TISCHLER,

b, Pericles FRANCO Ornes (201-64546) - FRANCO Is a
Dominican of interest to the Station, The LIJERSEY ream
devoted portions of five mouths, January to May 1960, collecting
information on subject through physical surveillance,

‘c. Jose Maria "Chema" LOPEZ Valdizon (201- ) was the
subject of a physical surveillance during May and June 1960,
LOPEZ was iater deported irom Mexivy inoiigh tie efforts
of LITEMPO-2.

d, CLACKETT and the LIERSEY team performed numerous
pretext Investigations on Station targets cf opportunity and on
three separate occasions during the project year served as

a counter-surveillance escort for Station officers in other

operations,

2, CLACKETT, just prior to his resignation in August 1960, spent
about five weeks giving tradecraft and operational skills training to
LITEA-1, Although not specifically covered by the project objectives,
this ability on CLACKETT's part is considered a significant con-
tribution to the Station's support efforts,

3, In view of CLACKETT's resignation, which was effective 31

August 1960, and the proposed transfer of the LIERSEY team to

the LITEMPO project, this segment of the LIEMPTY project wipl

not-be renéwed, However, for the record, it is considered that +
___the CLACKETT segment of LIEMPTY was worthwhile and the

expenditure of Station assets in connection with LIIERSEY operations

were Justified,

-D. Relationship to Related Mission Directive Objectives:

It can readily ‘be noted that Project LIEMPTY has provided support to
many Station operations and in this manner has been a contributing factor
to the furtherance of the Related Mission Directive. The project has not
produced any positive intelligence nor has it been tntended that it should
do so. The project's sole purpose ts to provide a mechanism for the
development of operational information in support of other Station
operations,

CHANGES

A, Stmon D, CLACKETT

The unexpected resignation of CLACKETT in August 1960 has
necessitated the decision as how best to utilize the LIERSEY surveillance
team and still benefit from the training and experience gained by the team
during the past year, As explained In the LITEMPO project outline, it was
decided that the LITEMPO Staff Agent would have the time, the need and the
requirements to handle and manage the LIJERSEY tcam on a regular basis;
consequently, the Station believed that such a solution to this problem would
permit the Station vo cuniliue io profit from CLACKETT's past efforts,

B. Oliver G, SCANTLING

Since CLACKETT's departure, SCANTLING has been handling the
LYERSEY team as an interim measure pending Headquarters approval of
the LITEMPO project. SCANTLING has been exposed to, and likewise
knows, only one of the team members, LIEMPTY-20, SCANTLING is

known to L-2G only by an alias,

EFFECTIVENESS

A. General comments pertaining to the value of the project efforts to the
Station's needs - The Station ts of the opinion that its operarioas are only
as good as the support mechantsms backstopping and contributing to them,
' The availability of unilateral support agents and organizations, such as

‘the LIEMPTY Project, to tnvestigate leads and to collect operacional
informacion is an indispensable ingredient to the Station's espionage and
counterespionage objectives. ‘The Station would be seriously handicapped
in {ts operational activities should the support services of such agents as
GERENDE, SCANTLING and the agents under their control be suddenly
made unavailabl>,

”'B, LIMERICK Target - The basis for most of the Station's counter-

esptonage activities directed against the LIMERICK target require detailed

iv. PROBLEMS

A, Security - The activities of the LICALLA base were suspended in .
September 1960 as a direct result of the arrest of three KURIOT
technicians by the Cuban Government, One of the technicians was known ~ ;
to have knowledge of the four LIMUST units (LICALLA Is located in one
of these units) and the Station considered {t appropriate to. suspend photo-

id graphic operations:pending resolution of the situation, At this time,

i there Is no indication when’LICALLA operations will be resumed, . The
LICALLA base operator has reported that.there have been no unusual
inquiries or other suspictous actions which might Indicate that LICALLA

: has’ been compromised to LIMERICK personnel; however, such a
ca possibility will exist untU the release of the three techniclans, No
other security problems have occurred during the past year.

nods

ve. PLANS

A. Processing of Photographs-- During the past year considerable
Progress has been maile in the Station's handling, i.e., sorting, Indexing,
identifying leads and filing, of photographs produced by the several bases. :

B, Photographic Techniques - Thé previous LIEMPTY Project Renewal

from HY-PAN negatives were too gralny and, consequently, were of
little use, in producing good identified shots of individuals, In view
of these experiments, night photography has not yet been attempted,
It should be noted that Eastman Kodak's new TRI-X PAN film, which
all’ bases and LIENTRAP now use, ts superior to any film previously
used by the Starion for clandestine photography. The quality of all
base phorographs have been increased iain! as a direct résult
of this new film,

C, General Comments - The Station believes that the GERENDE
segment is now operating under optimum organizational arrangments
and there are no plans for expansion contemplated at this time, It is
expected that SCANTLING will soon be relieved of his interim
responsibility for the LYERSEY team and can concentrate more on his
investigative and casing activities, The transfer of the LYERSEY team
to Project LITTEMPO reduced Project LIEMPTY activities by an
appreciable amount, It ts not planned, during the coming year, to
expand present LIEMPTY activities,

COSTS

A. Past Project Year ~ Station finance records indicate that Project
LIEMPTY expended $19, 120. 91 during Fiscal Year 1960 (L December
1959 - 30 June 1960) and has thus far during Fiscal Year 1961 (through
31 October 1960) expended $16, 734,69, Contract Agents salaries and
allowances paid by Headquarters bring the total expenditures for 11
months of che project year to approximately $5,000.00. An additional
$4,000.00 will be obligated during the 12th month of the project year,
This will bring total project expenditures to about $54, 000,00 for the
entire project year,

B. Ensuing Period - Of the total $53,000.00 budget, itemized below,
$31, 900.00 should be expended during the remainder of Fiscal Year
1961 and the balance, $21, 100,00, should be expended during Fiscal
Year 1962, Normal accounting procedures will be used for all
expenditures,

VII, EMERGENCY CONDITIONS

As regards the requirement listed tn CSI-F No, 230-60, Annex A, for
communications arrangments in the event of "Emergency Conditions,"
the Station does nor anticipate that this project would or could continue
to function under its present objectives, However, both principal
agents, SCANTLING and GERENDE, would very possibly be worthwhile
sources of information to maintain contact with under any adverse
conditions, Both of these agents identify themselfs, in terms of
ideology, motivation and perspective, more as Americans than as
Mexican nationals (which they are). It is reasonable to assume, there-
fore, that SCANTLING and GERENDE would become valuable contacts
in any emergency situation,

Service), At the time of the incident the LIENTRAP vehicle waa
carrying out en assignment of photographing a Cuban rally which 1t
was expected would be attended by many of the leading Mexican and
Central American Communists, The police were also covering the
meoting for thé-purpose of preventing a Commnist-inspired denonstra=
tion and they searchod LIENTRAP believing it might contain Communist
propsgenda, When they saw the fim they seized the filn,the truck and
LIENPTY-10 with the belief the Communists had filmed some rough-handed

REVIEW OF PROJECT LIEMPTY
(For the Pur, of Project Renewal]

i PRODUCT OF THE PROJECT

A. Oliver G. SCANTLING Segment (discussed in relation to project
objectives):

ae 1, "To collect operational information pertaining to LIMERICK.
personnel and physical facilities." During the past year SCANTLING has devoted
a significant amount of time to the furtherance of this project objective. Although
other Station operations and personnel-are also concerned with vas collection of
operational information abowt- LIMERICK personnel, SCANTLING's contributions
are unique as to type and complement information received from other sources. For
‘example, SCANTLING is used primarily as the source of information about LIMERICK
physical facilities, He is constantly on the alert for building modifications, con-
struction activities and the kinds of outside services utilized by the LIMERICK
installation, He regularly visits Inez PARADA de Moreno, the occupant of property
adjacent to LIMERICK, for the purpose of obtaining a close view of the interior
grounds of LIMERICK and to debrief Senora de Moreno about any unusual activities
which she may have.observed. At the present time SCANTLING is preparing a
thorough casing report on the electrical power supply used by LIMERICK and all

other residences and establishments in the same block. This operational information
is intended for KURIOT's use and will show all transformers in the block, electrical
meters for measuring the amount of electrical power used and the precise points
where wires enter each property. Because of his other sensitive activities and
because other operational activities provide adequate coverage, SCANTLING

has been used sparingly for physical surveillances and investigations which might
conceivably impair his future usefulness to the Station. During the time he spent
training Simon D. CLACKETT (pa) in radio controlled mobile surveillance,
SCANTLING did perform some surveillance work af the LIMERICK installation;
however, it was concerned mostly with briefing CLACKETT on dispatching tech-
niques and the procedures used for the control of several vehicles on a surveillance

team using two-way radios,

2. "Yo collect operational information pertaining to other targets of
opportunity, foreign official installations and personnel of intelligence interest
operating in Mexico." By far the most important contribution made by SCAN'TLING
in connection with this project objective has been his support to the LITACIT
operation and just recently actually gained entry to the LITACIT target using a
pretext cover story. During thia viait SCANTLING managed to collect highly
valuable operational information about the security of the installation, which has
added materially to KUBARK.'s knowledge about the-térget. SCANTLING has also
cased and prepared reports on the LITABBY target in anticipation of mounting

SECRE T/geP Qe



a photographic surveillance and in initial preparation for a future LINIMENT type
activity. SCANTLING has performed investigations of numerous other Station
targets of opportunity which, depending on their significance, have been reported
in separate correspondence.

3. "To exploit operational leads through recruitments, debriefings
and gurveillances," This objective was included in the LIEMPTY project because
SCANTLING is used to follow up LIFEAT leads and leads obtained from the LIEMPTY
photographic bases. During the past year SCANTLING has investigated a quantity of
leads obtained from the above sources, The information resulting from these in-
vestigations has enabled the Station ta maintain current data on the various firms
used by the LIMERICK target and in one instance, Octavio VIDALES (201- s
caused the Station to make a recruitment pitch in an effort to carry out a technical
penetration of the LIMERICK target. Although VIDALES was not recruited, the
Station anticipates that SCAN'TLING will some day be successful in just this type of
activity. SCANTLING is the Station's principal source for the follow-up of LIFEAT/
LIMERICK and LIEMPTY photographic base house leads as they pertain to the

primary target.

4." Not covered by a specific project objective but, névertheless, of
significant importance to the Station are SCANTLING's contributions to the overall
Station support efforts. In addition to the extensive training given to CLACKETT,
SCANTLING also prepared a detailed and sophisticated radio dispatch procedure for
use by the LIEMBRACE surveillance team, He devised a superior method for
numbering streets which enables the radio surveillance team to specify a location
without reference to street names and areas, The entire radio dispatch code, when
used properly, practically defies identification as the conversations of a clandestine
surveillance team, From the standpoint of Station security, SCANTLING conducted
an investigation of LIVESTOCK-2 based on two leads which were 30 years old and
reported significant information which contributed to the Station's final decision
to terminate LIVESTOCK-2, SCANTLING's other support activities consist of renting
hote! rooms and apartments in fictitious names, supportimy operations such as
LICOOL-12 by performing sentry duty and by serving as a capable and responsible
cutout between the Station and agents from other geographical areas.

5. Although SCANTLING's LIEMPTY objectives can never be completely
fulfilled, it is the Station's opinion that SCANTLING' has made important and valuable
contributions to LIEMPTY Project objectives specifically and to other Station
activities in general, SCANTLING's production, méasured against monetary .
expenditures, case officer time and other intangible factors, unquestionably justifies
his continuation ae an integral part of Project LIEMPTY.

is also used as thé radio central for dispatching the LIEMBRACE surveillance
team on LIMERICK personnel targets, All bases make routine reports on the daily
attendance of LIMERICK employees at the installation which facilitates the Station's
reporting on the arrival and departure of LIMERICK personnel, Also, the bases
devote time to reporting the personal associations among the numerous LIMERICK
employees. Some of this latter type information is valuable from the standpoint of
confirming that LIMERICK intelligence officers have a tendency to associate with

their colleagues,

2, "To collect operational information and identify operational
leads pertaining to Station targets of opportunity."" This is a broad objective
and one which is contributed to by the LIENTRAP operation. LIENTRAP is used
to provide photographic coverage of important Station targets which do not justify
a more permanent photographic base, During the period under review, LIENTRAP
has been used for the timely coverage of various Central American exile group
activities, the Confederacion de Trabajadores de la America Latina (CTAL)
_.headquarters, several counterespionage targets, the LITACIT and LITABBY
targets and other one-time operations of intelligence interest. The operational
information produced by LIENTRAP is used by the Station for increasing
operational knowledge about a target and, when appropriate, has been incorporated
in separate reports to Headquarters with other information about specific targets,

i,e., rent

3. "To provide operational eupport to Station operations,
hotel rooms and apartments, and conduct counter-surveillances." GERENDE,
because of his area knowledge and operational acumen, is used frequently by the
Station for renting hotel rooms and apartments in fictitious names for use on other
Station operations, He is also the Station's principal procurer of local Post Office
boxes for use as letter drops. This objective pertains entirely to the operational
support of other Station operations and is an invaluable ingredient to the security
of importait Station activities.

4, The production ’of operational information as represented by
LIMITED, LILYRIC, LICALLA and LIENTRAP is an important adjunct to the
Station's coverage of the LIMERICK target and Station targets of opportunity.
It is the Station's conclusion that the expenditure of KUBARK assets, i.e., money
and case officer time, is justified and that these activities should be continued,

CG. Simon D, CLACKETT Scgment (discussed in relation to project objectives):

1, "To collect operational information and to identify operational
leads pertaining to the LIMERICK target and Station targets of opportunity." Very
little production has been realized from this objective in terms of CLACKETT's
contributions. CLACKETT returned to Mexico in early April 1959 after receiving
surveillance, tradecraft and photography training in Headquarters. He then spent the
rest of April, May and part of June being trained by SCANTLING in mobile sur-
veillance techniques, Then LIEMPTYs 15, lo, 17 and 20 were placed under his
supetyision and he began training these agents in the arts of foot surveillance and
mobile surveillance. This team, known’as the LISERSEY team, is just beginning to
show the excellent effects of CLAGKETT's intensive training sessions. Although
LIEMPTY-17 has resigned and the team consists of only four agents, including
CLACKETT, the Station believes that the team will be ready within the next month
to begin its contributions to the above objective.

2. Based on the training time devoted to CLAGKETT and to the LISERSEY
team and the anticipated production during the coming project year, it is the Station's
opinion that this activity should be continued.

Ww EXTENT TO WHICH THE RELATED MISSION DIRECTIVE HAS BEEN
FURTHERED.

Project LIEMPTY has provided support, in varying ways, to a majority of

* Station operations and in this manner has been a contributing factor to the furtherance

of the Related Mission Directive. The project is not intended nor designed to
produce positive intelligence; its sole purpose is to provide a mechanism for the
development of operational information in support of other Station operations.

PROGRESS OF THE OPERATION AND PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE.

i.
A. Oliver G. SCANTLING Segment:

1, SCANTLING's duties and responsibilities are basically the same
now as they were when the original LIEMPTY project outline was submitted, Since
SCANTLING is the only major factor in this part of LIEMPTY, progress, other than
covered in the above section on production, can be measured only by the fact that
SCANTLING is a year older and has acquired a few more helpful tricka of the trade

SECRETS


ry

aries
and, consequently, has increased his own operational abilities.

2, , Insofar as future planning is concerned, SCANTLING will
continue to devote the greater portion of his time to the LITACIT operation. In
addition, he will continue his work against the LIMERICK target, i.e., investi-
gating LIFEAT and photographic base house leads in connection with the objectives
of the LIEMPTY and LIMESA projects. The Station still plans to maintain
SCANTLING as an independent Station asset free from the responsibilit

3. SCANTLING will probably continue providing administrative
support to LIEMPTY-3 (now covered under the LICOOL project), but will not be
responsible for the operational direction of L-3.

B. Raymond H, GERENDE Segment:

1, During the past year the three photographic base houses have
been trained in the use of a faster type film (HY-PAN) to facilitate the taking of
photographs on dark cloudy days, One base, LICALLA, has made tests and recently
begun making 35mm color slides using the new fast type Ektachrome film. This
film is now processed in the Mexico Station dark room which heretofore was not
posyible. It is the Station's opinion that a few color photographs of target personnel
will be useful for identification purposes. The LICALLA Base has also, during the
past year, begun taking 16mm motion pictures in color with the expectation that
Headquarters can eventually provide lip reading analysis of conversations taking
place in the garden area of the LIMERICK installation, :

2, Other operational progress has been made in connection with
relieving GERENDE of responsibility for the LIJERSEY surveillance team, This
mow leaves GERENDE with a sufficient amount of time to supervise all photographic
base houses, LIENTRAP and the outside photographic laboratory. :

3. Future planning in relation to this segment does not call for
expansion, Rather,. the Station plans to perfect some of the photographic procedures
now in use and to experiment with night photography possibilities using the fast
HY-PAN film with telephoto lens of varying lengths. GERENDE will also concentrate
on increasing the security and communications procedures used with cach base.

c. Simon D, CLACKETT Segment:

1, CLACKETT's assumption of responsibility for the LISERSEY
» surveillance team has been a progressive step for the development of an additional +
» and much needed support ascet, Although the LIJERSEY team has been in existence

for several years, 1t was only during the past year, with the assignment of

} CLACKETT, that an intensive effort was made to train the team members and to

place them under the-supervision of a full time team leader, As mentioned above,
CLACKETT has done‘an excellent job during the past few months in getting the
team ready for future operational assignments.

2, The Station plans, during the coming year, to increase the

then give a total LISERSEY complement of six agents and three radio cars. The
Station will continue to take all necessary precautions not to rush the development
of the team nor to give it assignments which are too complicated and too difficult.
It is anticipated that the team will begin some surveillance work within the next
month on targets connected with plans for an expanded Communist Party pene-

tration program,

IV, PERFORMANCE OF PRINCIPAL AGENTS IN. TERMS OF PRODUCTION,

URITY AND COVER. - re
SECURITY AND COVER: af whet +

s
A. Oliver G. SCANTLING - As should be expected from a well trained
land motivated agent, SCANTLING's production during the period under review was
excellent. His production is in the category of operational information rather than
positive intelligence and is based on leads and investigations given him by the
Station, He never fails to do a thorough and detailed Job on all assignments
given to him, He is an unugually valuablegfrincipal agent.> There have been no
security problems or developments during the past year in connection with
SCANTLING's assignments, Likewise, hie cover is very good and places him
in a position to maintain his work for KUBARK for many years to come.

B. Raymond H. GERENDE - Since GERENDE's marriage in December
1958, his performance has improved to a marked degree. He has become one
of the Station's most dependable agents in terms of promptness for meetings,
completing operational assignments as rapidly as possible and in doing any task,
regardless of how menial it may be, Insofar as the Station and GERENDE know,
his cover with LISTERINE's firm has held up very well, In fact, GERENDE
recently was able to negotiate a sales contract with a customer having a very
large sales capacity for the product manufactured by LISTERINE's firm. This,
of course, endears GERENDE to LISTERINE in addition to contributing to
GERENDE's cover employment, The only significant security incident pertaining,
in part, to GERENDE was in connection with LIENTRAP (please see HMMA-13951,
16 October 1959, for details).

C. Simon D, CLACKETT - CLACKETT's performance has definitely
measured up to the standards expected by the Station. He has proved that he
is conscientious, dependable and very quick in grasping the details of clandestine
He will undoubtedly continue to improve his personal performance as

activities.


- procedures ad outlined above,

ae

he gains more experience, There have been no security problems or incidents in
connection with CLACKETT's assignment to this Station, Although the notional

“cover provided by Headquarters has held up very well during the past few months,

the Station had hopes of placing him in LILABEL's firm and obtaining Inmigrante
papers for him, ‘However, for reasons mentioned in other correspondence, thie
‘cover arrangement did not work out. The Station is continuing efforts to locate
another suitable local cover job for CLACKETT.

V. | CONTACT AND COMMUNICATION.
\
: A. Oliver G. SCANTLING - The Station Case Officer meets with SCANTLING
on the average of three times each week, For regular meetings, a total of eight
Prearranged contact points are used alternately with SCANTLING "walking the beat't
and being picked up by the Case Officer in the latter's car. This procedure enables
both the agent and the case officer to check themselves and to check each other for
possible surveillance, Meetings are generally of short duration, seldom more than
30 minutes, and are held in the car. It is possible for SCANTLING to get in touch
with his case officer by telephone, and vice versa, in case an unscheduled meeting

is necessary. SCANTLING and the Station aré currently working on the details of

an emergency means of contact utilizing SCANTLING's wife's relatives in PBPRIME,
Headquarters will be advised ofthese arrangements to facilitate contact with
SCANTLING in the event Mexico is overrun by hostile forces and contact with the

Station is severed,

B. Raymond H, GERENDE - GERENDE's Case Officer meets with him five
times each weck. Meetings are conducted in the Case Officer's car using the same
GERENDE and his Case Officer have a total of 11

contact points in different areas of the city and generally hold their mectings during
the early morning hours, usually about 0800. As in the case of SCANTLING,
GERENDE and his Case Officer are preparing an emergency contact procedure which
will facilitate Headquarters communications with him through his relatives in PBPRIME
Headquarters will be advised of these arrangements just as eooa as they are completed.

C. Simon D, CLACKETT - The Station Case Officer meets with CLACKETT
on the averageof three times each week. The same type of communications pro-
cedures as used for SCANTLING and GERENDE are employed with CLACKETT.

FROM 4 Chief, WHD e
SUBJECT _ & LISPTY Project

1, Reforenes is nade to your cosmonts on the LIETTY Project vhich vas
approved on 1¢ January 195%

2. Tho LIENFTY Project provides for the development of tho forrer
LIJERSEY survoillenco tenn, tho maintenance of photo aurvollionce bases, and
other support facilities fer the Mexico City station, In their reviow of the
Projoct before it vas ap:roved, FI/OPS sugmested that Wi! Division consider a
gradval reduction of tha considerable financial and porsonnal commitments in
thio project in view of the favorably devoloring LYE-VOY Matacn relationship.
FI/OPS believed that a omaller, more managosble support group vith greater
omphasia on pelectivity of taske ani targets could well result in nore effective

CI and FI productivity.

3. Tho Mextean desk wishos to point out that rather than redueing the
agsets carried unter the LIZ“PTY Project, VHD believes that this project 1s
‘on oxtrenely inportant ono and should receive Headcuarters support.
other Station surveillu.ce teans, LIVESTOCK and LIEPRAGE, are both knoun
to the Mexican suthorities, Therefore LI‘:FTY remains the Station's only
secure eurveilincce asset. It ie a very snal] untrained unit at prosont, but
through this project it will be developad into a useable, valuable asset.

40 We are not passing FI/OP's comment to tho field, because WH Diviota:
believes that unilateral assots should not 'e reduced in favor of Maison.
Firat, the liaison has n-t yot been firmly established, secondly, even with a
good Maison relationship, the Mexican ssrvices must be considered anything but
secure, and certainly could not be trusted with any sensitive operations.
Thirdly, because of its proximity to the United States, and the activity of
hostile Antellicence groups thers, the Mexieo City Station 4s called uron to
support many vory nonsitive orerations vhich we would never wish to reveal to
the Mexican authoritios.

5. Experienes in other latin



f Paced

: 5. Experience in other latin Acerican countries vhere Maison has been

operations and capabilities in favor of the linison, Under these cirounstances,
the production of the Stations heve often been at the mercy of the }inison
service and a change in the attitule of the service touard cooperating vith
this Agancy has left these Stations virtually helpless. We certainly cannot

on 16 January 1959 without chance, for the period 1 Decenber 1958 through
‘30 Bovender 1959 for a total ‘of 195,350; $65,500 for the current fiscal
year and 329,800 for fiscal year 1960.

2, An amondment to the original request for project approval wes
guonitted before the original project was approved. This anendment
Tequested aporoval to include Sinon D. CLACK!T? (ps) and Wilma J. FIORUALIST
(es) uncer the LIN'TIY Project effective 1 January 1959 and renove then
fron the LUGS Project. The funds designated in the original FPO for
the undesignated Staff Agent vere usod to cover the expenses for CLACKETE
and FIOSDALISI, Therefore no additional funds were requested for the
project in this anendent. ‘fhe approva? on 16 January 1959 included tite
project anendrent, A copy of the asendzent request is being forwarded
for your information and records.

3, among the Staffs" comments on the LIEIFIY Trojeet, the following
recomendations were mide. KUDSK suggested that the Case Officer should
work at devising ostensible sources of incomes for the agents which will
stand the scrutiny of friends, relatives and less friendly forces.

lh, An azendnent to CLACKSPi's contract has been requested to allow
for a cuartere allowance. The educational allowance requested in paragrah
Lt of the project anendnent was disap-roved because CLACKRTT was a Contract
Agent. The Quarters Allowance of £2,590 was turned down becaure 1% was too
high in relation to CLACKSTI'a salary. Therefore, a quarters allovcace of
$1,800 has been approved and will be written into CLACXSTi"s contract. If,
hovever, opsrational snd cover reasons require CLACKET: to rent an apartment
larger ¢uan the one he would normally obtain under hia allowance, the Ciief
ef tation can authorize the extra rent ss au operational expense which will
rot be considered aa conpensation for CLACKT? and therefore not subject to

Yaderal income tax.

5. Please advise i:eadquartero whether you wish to have the cryptonyms
for CLACKSTT and FIONDALISI charged to LIWPTY's.

PROJECT OUTLINE
‘STATION, Mexico City. CHIEF OF STATION,

1. The atteched project outline is presented for approval for the :
period 1 December 1958 through 30 Joveaber 1959.

®, Headquarters is requested to select a suitsble contract or Staff
Agent to replace Raywond H. GERENDS az leader of the LIJBRSRY eurveillence
team. Fron the security stanfpaint, it ia essential that GERENDE be relieved
of this responsibility. The individual selected by Headquartera to fill the
slot formerly occupied by Hilfred 0. CLOWER (BAP-U100) should have bad
experience in surveillance operations and should apeak Spanish fluently.



PART I

“1. Area_of Operations

fae general area of operations vill be Mexico and the specific area vill be
Mexico, D.P., Mexteo.

2. Purpose

‘The purpose of this project is to provide a mechanism for the development of
operational information in support of other Station operations. This purpose is
in conéonance with the Related Mission Directive for Mexico.

3- Background

As the reviewing authorities vill be aware, this project includes several
operations which vere formerly carried under Projects LIP@TICK and LIJERSEY.
Partially as a result of the June 1958 LIPSTICK compromise, when three surveillance
team members vere apprehended end placedin custody by the Mexican Police, and
additionally as a means for the orderly administration of assets, this new project
is submitted.

There follove below a background sketch of the separate support sssets, excluding

-@etails concerning personnel which will be discussed later in the outline, which the

Station proposes for inclusion in LIEMPTY:

LIMITED - ‘The LIMITED Base is located in such a position across the street
from the LIMERICK installation that photographs can easily be made of persons enter-
ing and leaving the LIMERICK main gate. ‘These photographs are later developed and
printed by LIEMPTY-4, then returned to the LIMITED operator for the proper annotations.
After receipt’ of the photographs by the Station, the Case Officer revievs thea for
LIMESA loads, nevly arrived LIMERICK personnel, local and other nationals of possible
operational interest and PBPRIME citizens who have visited LIMERICK.

KUBARK owns the property housing the LIMITED Base, having purchased it in mid-
1955; hovever, the ostensible owner is LIMOUSINE, to whom LIEMPTY-6 pays hie reat

each month through LIMOUSINE's benk.

LIMITED, with LIEMPTY-6 as base house operator, has been operating Sor nearly
three years and has not yet been involved in a compromising security aituation. Prior
to April 1955, when Headquarters authorized the purchase of the LIMITED Base, the
Station rented the Bage and used LIPSTICK-7 (later LIMESTONE-6 in LIFEAT Project
and now terminated) as the operator. This arrangewent vas in effect for about tvo

years.

LILYRIC > Tais Base ‘has been in operation for about two and one-half years
and is located in an apartment building acros s the street from the LIMERICK
installation. As inthe case of the LIMITED Base, LILYRIC takes photographs of
Persons entering at? leaving the main gate of the LIMSRICK installation. The

- LELYRIC photographs. are bandled.in the sane wanner as the LIMITED pictures. In

toa ra the ‘LILYRIC operators also prepare daily logs on the?’
tke: employee, record the licease plate numbers of most cars?

ad ¢ LINSRICK installation, and prepare an observation

in all-target personnel seen éach day. (This peraits the Station to tell when

: iality {s out’ of tovn or not working for some other reason.)

The LILYRIC Base-was originally acquired and made operative to provide for
Continuous’ coverage ofthe target in the event LIMITED is ever compromised. This
ig still the primary value of having tvo bases cover the eame portion of the target.
LILYRIC is compartmented fron LIMITKD and with the possible exception of GERENDE
sould probably weather any security flap involving LIMITED. Obviously, there is
“some duplication in the vork of LIMITED and LILYRIC; hovever, the insurance value
of having tvo basis ig quite apparent. -

LILYRIC has been operating for about two and one-half years and insofar as
the Station knows, no coupromising security situations have arisen.

LICALLA ~ The LICALLA Base is located in a position where photographs can be
taken of people within the LIMERICK gurden area. In addition, the operator of the
LICALLA Base submits veekly reporta Gn LIMERICK construction work, daily logs show-
ing vhen a target individual vas seen that dey, and reports shoving the association
of target individuals with one another. LICALLA photographs are processed and handled
in the same manner.and by the people who handle the LIMITSD ana LILYRIC pictures.

: ‘The LICALLA Base vas acquired and operations began about two and one-half
yeare ago vith the primary purpose of obtaining additional operational information
concerning LIMERICK personnel, and operational leads which could be exploited for
the physical penetration of the LIMSRICK installation. Approximately one year ago
the LICALLA, Base was purchased by KUBARK through LIMOUSINE. LICALLA will probably
remain at its present location and will continue to subait photographs and reports
of the same type as are now being submitted. Other than the fact that LIEMPTY-9,
the LICALLA operator, is the brother of former LIPSTICK-47, no security problems are
currently known to the Case Officer. However, reports from LIPSTICK2 12 and 30, the
local police, the attorneys involved in the case, the foreign ecbassy concerned and
the LCFLUTTER tests give no indications that LIEMPTY-9 was ever mentioned during

the LIPSTICK flap.

LIEWIRAP - Tais 1s a panel type truck equipped with cameras, telescopic
lens and other types of photographic equipment. It has been used during the past
two years as an investigative asset. The truck is parked about 75 yards fron a
target of interest (ususily a residence or apartment building) and the photographer
in the rear of the truck photographs individuals or things of interest to the Station.
LIENTRAP is a valuable asset for’any station to have and has enabled this Station to
get pictures of individuals which could have been obtained in no other way. LIEMPTYs-

40 and 11 operate LISXTRAP. :

The major security threat to LIEWTRAP is the fect that it has been operating
for ebout two years in all parts of the city and should soon be replaced by a truck

Outline, =" ~ oe

LIJERSHY - This 18 presently an approved project; biwever, it is believed
advisable for administrative efficiency to include the LIJERSEY assets within the
framework of the LIEMPTY Project. Other than LILYRIC, vhich has already been
discussed, LIJERSEY consists of a foot surveillance team with three members, LIEMPTYs-
15,16 and 17. LIEMPTYs 15 and 16 have been employed for about one anda half years
and LIEMPTY-17_ for about one year. They bave not developed tuto as competent a surveil-
lance team as the team was and probably never will become as good. The
LIJERSEY team bas deen ‘tine’ mostly for stationary surveiliances and observations of
people of interest. LIEMPTY-17, hovever, hes also been used as a pretext investigator.
He has excelled at this type of work and the Station continues to use him in this
capacity. The. Station has been reluctant to use the LIJERSEY team as much as it
could have been used because of the cldsé association of the team with GEREADE
in turn, GERENDE’s knovledge ahd vork-on LIFEAT and the LIPSTICK surveiliance tean.
The Btation plans to recruit several agents of a type and social level more suitable
for all types of surveillance vork than’ tte present LIJERSEY team.

Oliver G. ACANTIING - SCANTLING has been astociated vith KUBARK for several
years ina number of different capacities, He vas originally used as a member of
the LIPSTICK gurveiliance team and later was heed of the came team. He has been

to

_ used to train new agents in the techniques of surveillance and investigation,

sequire office space and apartments for the Station'a operations and to conduct
investigations and make recruituent approaches to individuals of operational interest
to KUBARK. SCANTLING 1s currently being used by the Station as an investigator of
LIMESA leads andis etill actively pursuing the LIMESA/MKLIGHTING operation.

STANTLING also maintains regular contact with LIGMPTY-3 and uonitora his elicitatica
effort against the LICOOL-6 target. ‘In thia connection, both SCANTLING and LIEMPIY-3
meet regularly vith Doris M. KILLGO for operational guidance. (Note: Please see

the LICOGL Fiekd Project Outline for additional details on LICOGL-6).

leads which pertain to services _provided she LIMERICK installation by individuals
and firms, 4.g. constructionagineera, * Waxing firms, safe experte,. furniture
makers, interior decorators, etc.. To an éxtent, ‘these are. considered targets of
opportunity ahd it would be impouaible to list spécifically what future targets
will be available. One specifi¢ target which SCANILING ia concerned with is the
oceupaiit of the LICOOL-6 apartment; however, LIEMPTY-3, whom SCANTLING handles,
should more sorresthy, be given credit for information produced on this target.

Raymond H. GERENDE - LIMITED, LILYRIC and LICALLA all have es their target

10. Cover:

&. Raysiond H. GERENDE is the only LIENPTY agent who has cover provided by
KUBARK. GeRENDE ostensibly is a saleszan for LISTERINS's firm. Hovever, he
seldea spends ary time pursuing hie cover oceupation, since his operational
activities sre so numerous and time conmming. GEREXDE's cover vith the LISTERIAE

‘firm vas arranged by the Station and, so far, has beea adequate for GERENDE's needs.

: Quinton R.-OUSLER, 18 know only to GERENDE and
SCANTLING. It would not"be possible to develop a suitable cover story that

vould apply to the frequent meetings between the Case Officer and the Principal
Agents; therefore, meetings are clandestine and are wually conducted in the

Case Officer's.car; However, ‘suitable cover stories have been developed between the
Case Officer snd SCANTLING and between the Case Officer and GERENDE involving back~ :
_ gFowmid information as to how we uet and how our friendship developed, to be used i
in the event ‘tie.Cose Officer fe apprehended with either of the Principal Agents.

“e@. Hone of the status cover occupations of any of the LIEMPTY agents id
completely compatible with his operational activities. Action cover stories are
derided upon before cach assignment and devised to complement each agent's status a
cover as closely as possible. Base House operators, of course, generally conduct
operational assiguients within the confines of their quarters; consequently, the
need for action cover stories is reduced. Appropriate cover stories exist between
GERENDE and the agents in his network and between SCANTLING and LIEMPIY-3.

ll. Contact and Commmication:

Appropriate clandestine communications arrangenents exist between the various
echelons of LIEMPTY. At the present time these plans. consist of regular and
rapid-non scheduled (emergency) means of contact. GERENDE and SCANTLING are both
in the process of preparing cetatled written communications plans for their
respettive agents which include complete regular, alternate and rapid-non
scheduled meeting arrangements. Provisténs will sileo be made in these plans for
gral recognition signals end physical bona fides that will enable a person unknown
.to the agent to contact him should the need ever arise. The Case Officer is cur-
rently working on a Warning Systen of Comunteations vhich vill permit the ex-
peditious exfiltration of CEREWDE and SCANTLING fron Mexico should a security
situation arise vhich would necessitate this.

12. Central and Motivation:

@. Control - All LIEMPTY agents are local naticnals, GERENDE and SCANTLING,
oth of whom spent a great deal of their childhood years in PRPRIME and still
have relatives living in PRPRIME, are in many respects more pro-PBPRIME than

many PBPRIME citizens. In the“past, both GERENDE and SCANTLING have evidenced
a a high degree of loyalty to Matthew 3: DIVGLEY, their former Station Case Officer,
and appear to be devoting that same loyalty to the present Case Officer. The
control over GERENDE and SCANTLING stens directly from their pro-PBPRIME beliefs
end their personal loyalty to their past and present Case Officers. The control : ‘
over other LIEMPTY agente ia based in part on pre-PBPRIME attitudes and on the
financial remuneration and good handling they received from GERENDE and SCANTLING.
Realistically, control over LIEMPTY agents is based on mutual understandings and
confidence among individuals and should any agent decide to denounce PRPRIME or
KUBARK, a8 the case may be, there is not much that the Station could do.

b. Motivation - With the exception of GERENDE end SCANTLING, whose primary

motivations are ideological, financial Scupensation eens to be the b:
