to the KDFACTOR Project in the amount of $9,844

for FY - 72 to provide for costs of agent

terminations.

The decision to terminate all agents and

facilities under the KDFACTOR Project was based

on a security review of the project activities

which indicated that the VWBLANKET principal knew

the basic details of the KDFACTOR operations,

including the target,

the location of the surveillance

sites, and probably the true names and former

cryptonyms of the agents covered by the project.

The cost of terminating the agents under the

KDFACTOR Project amounted to $15,573; the cost of

closing down, the two basehouses under the project

The long tenure of three of the terminated

2. The production from this operation has consis-

tently been rated higa by the Bureau (which is the prin-

cipal customer in the field), by other Government agencies

and by SB Division.

Photosurveillance of a Soviet Embassy

might not be a high priority target in some countries.

But the fact that the Soviet Embassy in Mexico is a large

important and valuable.

believe it is time for the Station to make an updated

security review of the operation with particular attention

to the knowledgeability

of terminated agents and their

families.

He also believe that the Station should now

address itself to the contingency that the present sites

or personnel will be blown and to investigate alternative

means of continuing their valuable coverage.

The ADDP last approved this project in May 1970

with the condition that termination payments to the

principal agent and his divorced wife be made on a

monthly basis. This condition has been not.

5. The budgets requested for the next two years are

simple and straightforward.

Salaries and the traditional

bonuses for the five paid agents come to about $13,000.

Rent and utilities on the two observation posts come to

$5,600.

The small balance is for operational expenses.

This project action also requests amendment of the FY

1971 budget by $1,260 to cover that part of the cost of

termination bonuses to the principal ayent and his di-

vorced wife

which could

not be absorbed by the project.

The total of the termination bonuses was $12,500.

6. This is a valuable and productive project which

helps fulfill a Priority A-1 Station requirement.

FI Staff recommends approval.

Changes:

1. The processing of photographs obtained through this

project now is performed inside the Station.

KDFACIOR-1, who

formerly processed the take in in outside safehouse, was

terminated amicably in early March 1971. Security and effi-

ciency have been increased by this change. -KDFACTOR-7 was

terminated in 1970, but the termination payments were made

during FY 1971 causing an increase in that years obligations.

2. Howard T. BAGAUS handled the administration of this

project to early April 1971 when project responsibility

reverted from the Operations Support Section to the REDIOP

Section.

At that tine Timothy H. ARCHBOLD assumed the inside

administrative supervision,

and agent meetings were turned

over to the outside case officer Bruce H. FERNALD.

ARCHBOLD departed PCS on 7 June 1971, Oliver J. MANKUNAS

assumed responsibility for this project, including agent

meetings.

Accomplishments:

1. This project has provided continuous daily photo-

graphic and visual coverage of personnel and vehicles entering

or leaving

the Soviet Embassy.

A total of 530 rolls of film

were produced during the reporting period. U.s. citizens'iden-

visitors,

and IDY personnel are given special attention.

¡fications of license plates and automobile descriptiong as

well as drivers and their companions are identified under this

Additionally, attendance sheets are maintained to

establish who is at the Embassy on any given day and hour.

Raymond Il, GERENDE was removed as the LIEMPTY

principal agent in

early December 1969 owing to a security

problem (sec Problems, paragraph 1). He was replaced on

9. December 1969 by

Bruce. H.

FERNALD, a career agent oper-

ating under cover as a retired immigrant.

The change has

caused some

delay in the receipt of photographs because

FERNALD is unable to meet LIEMPTY agents as frequently as

GERENDE had met them, but operational effectiveness is not

significantly reduced by this delay.

The key issue is that

security and reliability of the principal agent have improved

considerably.

Accomplishments:

1.

Project LIEMPTY has provided continuous daily

photographic.and

visual coverage

(Monday through

Saturday)

of the tront entrance and rear areas of the Soviet Embassy

•in Mexico City.

All Soviet personnel and their visitorg

entering or

leaving the Embassy have been photographed.

In

addition, visual

surveillance reports were prepared when

appropriate.

These photographs and reports have contributed.

essential operational support to the Station's

Soviet oper-

ations program:

Recently, LIEMPTY photographs were exclusively used

an updated mugbook on Soviet officials in Mexico.

The book has been loaned to the FBI, AF/OSI and the 902nd

Military Intelligence Group

for operational use in debriefing

their agents engaged in dangle operations

Similarly, an AF/OSI

controlled ayont schoduled to moot a Soviet contact wag

unable to do so owtig to illness, but LIEMPTY photographed

another person who appoarod at the moeting site and this

person is bellevod to be the agent's Soviet case officer.

Such coverago has beon helpful to the 902nd, AF/OSI and

the FBI

in running thoir controlled doublo agent operation:

against the Sovlets in Moxico.

Within one weok after a biannual change of license

plates on Soviet Embassy vehiclos, LIEMPTY had provided a

complete list of the new tag numbors, along with a complete

identification of the vehicles.

Among other things,

anabled the station to identify the companions of Aleksandi

Aleksandrovich NIKITIN, a known KGB Officer, during his

last few days in Moxico.

LIEMPTY has also dotormined that newcomers to the

Enbassy frequently gravitate to groupings with their

• RIS colleagues in the "safoty" of the Embassy backyard.

This fact enabled the Station. to mako certain tontative

KGB and GRU identifications.

In addition,

certain TDYers

have been linked up with their escort officers and clues

to personal relationships have occasionally been exploited.

In the fiold of Sovict patterns of activity and

associations, LIEMPTY has been able to report accurate

changes in cortain specific cases. LIEMPTY coverage showed

that NIKITIN, montioned in paragraph 3 above, changed his

activity pattern following

the defection of Raisa

Yerofeyevna KISELNIKOVA, former secretary in the Commercial

Mission in Mexico.

Oleg NECHIPORENKO,

a Second Secretary at the Embassy and a known KGB officer.

LIEuPTY also provided information

on the patterns and

associations of Yurly Viktorovich KUPLYANOV, & Known KGB

officer and on Valeriy Vladimirovich SOKOLIN, a known GRU

officer.

Coverage of Vladimir Viktorovich GORDEYEV, a

who some of his associates were.

In the case of Oleg

Konstantinovich IGNATYEV,

fros Caracas, Venezuela, LIEMPTY was able to observe

IGNAMEY entering and leaving in the company of Svyastoslav

Fedorovich KUZNETSOV, Press 'Attache and First Secretary of

This kind of information is a basic

contribution

to the Station's

continuing efforts to

and assess

certain

Soviets for possible

recruitment or defection.

At Headquarters,

the Soviet Bloc Division uses

LIEMPTY photographs, particularly photographs of Soviet

Embassy officials,

for identification purposes in con-

nection with defector cases.

The LIEMPTY material also

keeps the Station's Sovict section up-to-date on which

Soviet officers have been in the Embassy, which ones have

been away; who has used which car; who has been in contact

whom; and other similar information useful in the

conduct of Soviet operations.

Problems:

A security problem has developed involving

Raymond H. GERENDE.

According to GERENDE, his wife wants

a divorce, apparently based mainly on incompatability of

personalities.

The problem basically is that both want

of the children and this has sparked a dispute

that has become more bitter and violent daily.

In addition,

the monetary settlement is in dispute.

considerable detail of GERENDE's activities on behaif of

Thus, if the case does go to court, it could

lead to the surfacing of GERENDE'S Agency employment and

possible compromise of LILYRIC, LICALLA and LIENTRAP.

Even if the case does not go to court, GERENDE's wife could

expose him as an Agency employee.

Station has been in touch with both GERENDE and his

wife on this problem,

and every effort is being made by

the Station to have both parties settle the divorce out of

court, and to protect GERENDE's cover and that of the

After weighing all factors, it has been decided

that continued employment of GERENDE is not an acceptable

SUBJECT

Renewal of Project LIEUPTY

. WH Division requests renewal of Mexico City Station's

Operational Support Project, LIEMPTY, for $23,635 for Fiscal

Year 1971 and a $10,498 amendment for FY 1970 to cover termin-

ation payments to a former Principal Agent and his wife.

yoar LIEMPTY was approved for $38,970.

One agont termination

and the trangter of the cost of a mobile surveillance unit to

It includes a

GERENDE

has been having marital difficulties which nay

end

in divorco.

Along with other incompatible features of the

marrlage, which have resulted in nunerous family lights,

there havo been long, bitter and violent arguments as to who

will have custody .of thelr 1 children and concerning a mone-

tary settlements: The Station has become Involved in these

altercations because GRENDE's "1fe 1s knowledgeable of h18

CIA relatlönship

and could, li she chose to do so, expose hiu

as an agency employee." She has promised to seop quiet but

there 18 no assurance

that she will do so.

In view of the

risk involved, should GERENDE'& wife expose his agency rela-

tionship and in view of the fact that, despite his 15 years

of service. and his undisputed ability and experience, other

unfavorable qualities militate against his retention,

the

Station is considering terminating GERENDE.

It is proposed

to pay him a termination bonus of $10,000 for 15 years of

service in accordance with Mexican law and hig wife

$2,500 as

a security measure designed to keep her quiet.

After discug-

sion with the dess, FI Staff belleves that,

1f GERENDE 18

paid the $10,000 termination noney, it should not be given to

him in one lump sum

but should be pald on a monthly basis,

the amount per month to be determined by the Station, thus

eliminating

the possibility of his squandering it all at

once and possibly coming back for more of the

same.

The same

procedure should be followed in the $2,500 payuent to hig

wife.

In both cases at least an element of control 1s

assured in that both GERENDE and his wife will know that con-

tinued receipt of their monthly payments will depend upon

their continued loyalty to the agency.

In the meantime, we

feed this man,

whose morale, and ability have been seriously

affected by his marital strife, given time,

can perhaps be

rehabilitated and

once again become a valuable Station asset.

This would

ensure his continued loyalty and give hin an income

out of which to pay his alinony. Aside from the foregoing

there were no other problems, security or otherwise.

All

meetings between the case officer and the new Principal Agent

are held under secure conditions,

or more often if necessary,

at prearranged dates, times and places.

Meetings between the

P/A and the subagents are held under similar conditions. The

Station has been requested to submit an updated emergency re-

contact plan to

be included in the first FY 1971 quarterly

program report for this project.

SUBJECT

: FY 1970 Renewal of Project LIEMPTY for $38,970

project LIEMPTY, now in its eleventh year, is the Mexican

Station's operation which provides visual and photographic survell-

lance of the Soviet Embassy from safehouses at the front entrance

and back of the building,

as tell as from a mobile unit.

All Soviet

personnel and their visitors coming to the Embassy are photographed.

From 1 November 1967 to 31 December 1968, approximately 21,367 photo-

graphs were taken and thousands of pages of surveillance reports were

completed by personnel in this project. SB Division is pleased with

the quantity and quality of the photographs and the Station finds them

useful for operational purposes against the SB target.

During the

past year several U.S. citizens entered the Soviet installation in

Mexico City and their photographs were identified by the FBI. There

is a good relationship between the Station and the FBI in Mexico City

and appropriately sterilized phetographs are passed locally.

2. There have been no significant security problems.

3. The only changes in the project have been the elimination of

one of the safehouses, which was used as an observation post, and

termination of the agent who attended it.

No real loss resulted from

this change since the safehouse was so located that photographs taken

from it overlapped those taken from another safehouse.

The agent who

erviced the facility was getting too old to do an efficient job an

was terminated amicably.

Ilso during the past year a new agent wa:

added to the project.

4. Total funds requested for FY 1970 are $38,970. Salaries and

legally required bonuses for nine agents come to $30,080; safehouse

$5,000 vehicle was purchased in FY 1969 and none is needed in

FY 1970 which accounts for the reduction in costs for the present year.

LIEMPTY is a project supporting Soviet operationg

of the Mexico City Station.

It provides for two baschouses,

a photo surveillance vehicle, and personnel for photographic

and visual surveillance of the Soviet Embassy.

Presontly,

two fixed surveillance points near the Embassy provide the

location from which the photographs are taken and observers

arè stationed.

One basehouso is adjacent to the rear

There is also a mobile photographic unit fa VW

operations and in conjunction with the LIEMBRACE surveillance

team (used primarily against Soviet targets). Raymond H.

GERENDE, an

indigenous contract agent,

is the principal agent

of the operation and meets daily with the basehouse keepers

and subagents.

3.

LIEMPTY contributes significantly to the Station's

PROJECT BRIEFING

PROJECT : LIMPTY

ACTION

: ADD/P approval of renewal (19 mos.)

1 Dec 67 - 30 Jun 69°

PURPOSE:

An operational support project providing three basehouses and

a mobile surveillance unit to monitor primarily the Soviet

Embassy, 1ts personnel and 1ts visltors, by physical and photo-

graphic surveillance.

BACKGROUND: The project covers three propertied near the Soviet Embaasy

(two in front of the Embassy's sole entrance and one bchind the

garden) from which visual and photographic surveillance is carried

Some of the project porsonnel are used at times for miscellaneous

support tasks such as servicine postal boxes and for counter-

surveillance and other protective services.

PROGRESS:

During the past year the project provided nearly all of the opera-

tional photographs and physical surveillance reports used in the

Station's operations against the Soviet Enbassy and its personnel.

SB Division says,

"This rather unique operation has unquestionubly

made a major contribution to the increasingly effective Soviet

Operations program of the Mexico Station."

FUNDS

The project produces primarily operational data and counterintelli-

It provides leads, evidence of which soviet

officers have been in the Embassy and which ones have been away,

who has used which car, who has been talking to whom or going out

of the building with whem.

used in the Warren Commission Report.)

Project LIEMPTY

1.

WH Division requests renewal of LIENPTY for the

19-month period l December 1967 through 30 June 1969 in

the amount of $69,725:

While this represents a slight

reduction on a pro rata basis from the $45,000 for which

LIEMPTY was approved for the 12-month period starting

1 Decomber 1966,

it reflects a proportionately modest

increase in cost for the 19-month renewal perlod over the

estimated

total disbursement of $40,130 for the past

project year.

This will provide for small salary increases

to meet the rising cost of living for certain of

the agents

Involved in the project who have not received raises in

some time as well as for slightly higher rental fees for

the various basehouses.

The project, now in its tenth

year, is designed primarily to provide for the collection

Cityperational Information on the Soviet Embassy In Mexico

including the identification and muvenchts of its

personnel and visitors.

To this end, LIENPTY provides

for the

maintenance and exploitation of three basehouses

for fixed visual and

photographic surveillance of the

Soviet Embassy and a

mobile basehouse in the form of n.

Embassy, leaders and mecting sites

PROJECT: LIEMPTY

WH - Mexico Gity

ACTION : ADD/P approval of renewal

1 Dec 66 - 30 Nov 67

PURPOSE: Provides stationary surveillance against the Soviet Embassy

ánd a mobile photographic baschouse which is used primarily

against the Polish Embassy and local Communist party leaders.

• PROGRESS: Three basehouses (LIMITED, LILYRIC and LICALLA) pro-

vide coverage of both the front and rear of the Soviet Embassy.

Throughout the past renewal period each operational component

contributed actively and concretely to the fulfillment of the

operational tasks levied on the Station. In the first nine-month

period approximately 17,000 individual frames of operational

photographs were provided from the fixed basehouses. These

served to confirm the identities of Embassy personnel and

their visitors and provided detailed reporting on the movement

and habit patterns of selected targets of special interest. The

mobile unit (LIENTRAP) provided over 1, 000 individual photo-

graphs. Of particular value were photographs of local and

exile Communist leaders. Raymond H. GERENDE (p) continued

in the role as principal agent for Project LIEMPTY. His overall

operational assignment involved at least 12 clandestine meetings

per week, in addition to his meetings with the LIEMPTY project

case officer.

PROBLEMS: In mid 1966 LICOWL/l, who owns a small store near the

Soviet Embassy, reported that a Soviet official had approached

him and asked him to inform on his neighbors. Reportedly the

Soviet named LIEMPTY/6 of the LIMITED basehouse by name

and also asked about the tenants of the building housing LILYRIC.

However, in view of LICOW L's previous history of lying, it is

difficult to assess exactly what the Soviets requested and just

what LICOWL/1 may have told them. The Station is still looking

into this development.

CI STAFF: Strongly urges the Station to continue its close

monitoring of Sovie: interest in the installation buildings and

attenzats to obtain information on sensitive project personali-

ties. The Station should devise necessary contingency pians

of action to eliminate any security hazards if it is determined

that the Soviets are intensifying such efforts and could be

getting "too close" to the project installations, personalities

and activities.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director for Plans

SUBJECT

: LIEMPTY Project Renewal

It is requested that the LIEMPTY Project be

renewed for the period 1 December 1966 through 30

November 1967 for a total of $15,000: $29,020 for

FY 1967 and $15,980 for FY 1968.

The Project 1g in-

• cluded in

the FY 1967 Operational Program for $45,000.

Funds are available within WH Division.

2. LIEMPTY covers stationary surveillance base-

houses

targeted against the Soviet Embassy.

These

basehouses provide photographic coverage and logs. To

of the baselouses (LIMITED and LILYRIC) cover the

activity in the front of the Embassy, and LICALLA provides

coverage of the back courtyard area.

The LIEMPTY project

also covers a mobile photographic baschouse in the form

of a panel truck which is used against the Polish ambassy

where we have no permanent surveillance basehouse, and

against other targets of opportunity.

3. The value of Soviet Embassy photographic cover

age during the past year

was provch when the

maintained by LILYRIC were used to double check on an

operation involving LIRUSTIC-l and LICOWL-l who had told

conflicting stories of certain events concerning the

activity of some soviets.

Through the surveillance

reports of the LIEMPTY Project against the Soviet Embassy,

it was proven without & doubt that Licowl-l who had just

taken a polygraph without apparent deception) was lying

about his contacts with the Soviets.

The LIENTRAP mobile photographic basehouse was

targeted against leadors and meeting sites of the local

Communist parties as well as other targets of opportunity,

particularly exile Communist leaders now residing in

LIENTRAP provided up-dated identification

to both the JNTIGER program and the Station'g

•ecruitment/penetration program.

The LIENTRAP

ersonnel also regularly service twenty-one postal

accommodation addresses used by the Mexico City

Station.

One development which may affect the security

of the LIEMPTY baschouses of LIMITED and LILYRIC

occurred in mid 1966 when LICOWL-l (who owns a small

store near the Soviet Embassy) reported that & Soviet

official, AEQUALITY-1, had approached him and

requested him to inform on his

neighbors.

by name and also indicated all the tenants (unnamed)

of the new building which now houses LILYRIC.

The

Soviet pinpointed the building by saying the one being

built by a person who fit perfectly the description of

LIMOUSINE. LICONL-l did not indicate that the Soviet

reflected any interest in LIMOUSINE.

The occupants of

the LILYRIC basehouse were not mentioned. LICOWL-1

indicated to his Station contact that the only person

he really suspected in the neighborhood was LIEMPTY-6

(of LIMITED) who doesn't go to work, is always typing,

lives comfortably, and owns a car.

He claims to have

heard it rumored that LIEMPTY-6 was working for the

Americans.

(Since LIMITED is equipped with a radio

and tips off the Station's surveillance team when it

•is used against Soviet targets, Headquarters has

already assumed that the Soviets have identified this

baschouse.)

LICONL-1 also listed several persons

named by the Soviet who had no connection whatsoever

with CIA.

The Station instructed LICOWL-I not to become

an informant on his neighbors.

According to LICOWL-1,

he therefore told AEQUALITY-1 he did not have time to

collect the information the Soviet wanted.

in view of the lies LICOWL-l has been caught in, it

is difficult to assess exactly what the Soviets asked

of LICOWL-l and just what LICOWL-l may have told the

Soviets..

The Station is still looking into this develop-

ment.

latter is not a part of the project, however.)

2. The LIEMPTY target is the Soviet Embassy and Soviet

activities in Mexico City.

LISVeTY is part of the complex of

station instruments by means or bich requirements from a variety

of U.S. agencies are met. One of the sites provided pictures

later used in the Warren Conission feport, and the publication

of the

report created a security hazard.

The Station moved the

site and it 1s now back in operation.

The possibility of Soviet intercept of radio commo to

the surveillance team has been carerully weighed recently by SR,

the desk, 0/C and ISD. The decision to accept the risi appearo

to have been taken with due deliberation.

states further,

Pecause of

essentlal that the Station be given the opportunity, torough this project, to

build another aurveillance team capablo of oparatiny against gensitivo targets.

duditlonally, the Cl Staff balloves the casa officer should work at dev-sing

ostensible gources of incomes for the agents which will stand the scrutiny of

friends, relatives and lesa friandly forces.

FI/OPS suggests that the Division consider a gradual reduction of the

considerable financial and personnel comnitments in this project in view of

the favorably developing LIENCY liaison relstionship.

FI/OPS balloves that

a smaller, note nansgeable support group, with froster Station emphasia on

selectivity of tasks and targets could well rasult in nore effective CI and

FI productivity.

VHBLANKET case. The five agents vere terminated in July

1972, but the base houses could not be terminated until

January 1973 because It was necessary to sell one and the

termination of the second was tied to the termination of

KDABBEY who owned the second base nouse. It was necessary

to pay rent for several extra months until these other

SUBJECT

: FI Project KDFACTOR, Security Review

REFERENCE

: ADDP Memo (DD/P 1-5899) to C/WHD dated

14 December 1971

1. In response to reference the following is a summary of the

KDFACTOR security review:

The Station summary of the KDFACTOR Project security is

as follows:

the Project. In response to the Headquarters request, we have

reviewed all phases of the operation and believe that Project

security is sound. The Project assets have all been with us for

many years and have established themselves as respectable long-

time residents of the area. All five assets, four in one famils

and one in another, are extremely security conscious and have

all been SGSWIRLED. The assets derive a substantial portion

of their livelihood from their Agency employment and would thus

lose a great deal if security factors ever necessitated a termina-

tion of their work for us.: As an additional safeguard, the

KDLITERAL and KDABSINTHE operations are compartmented

from each other, and there has never been any indication that

either segment of KDFACTOR knows of the other's existence".

The Headquarters desk has also reviewed the security of the

KDFACTOR Project and agrees with the Station that the security

is sound, In fact, as presently constituted, the KDFACTOR

Project is well compartmented, and each of the two KDFACTOR

photo basehouses (KDLITERAL and KDABSINTHE) is run by long-

term assets who draw a minimum of suspicion in their operational

activities.

Terminated assets could possibly expose the existence

of this project, but that seems unlikely from the Headquarters

review of terminated agents witting of present KDFACTOR

operational activitles. A Soviet investigation of property owner-

ship around the Soviet Embassy and their awareness that the

Soviet Embassy was under photographic surveillance in the past

could result in a Soviet investigation of the activities and contacts

of KDABBEY-l, the owner of an apartment building and four

houses close to the Soviet Embassy. It is doubtfül that DABBEY-l's

activities, which do not inter-relate with the activities of the

KDFACTOR agents, would in any way expose the KOFACTOR

Project operational activities.

2. A brief history of the KDFACTOR Project:

The KDFACTOR Project had its origins in the LIJERSEY

and LIPSTICK Projects, both active in the mid-1950's. In 1958, after

the arrest of two LIPSTICK surveillance team members, it was decided

to break off the more sensitive, uncompromised LIPSTICK assets manning

and supporting two basehouses for photo surveillance of the Soviet Embassy.

These assets were consolidated with one photo basehouse against the Soviet

Embassy and one surveillance team from the LIJERSEY Project into a new

project (LEMPTY), which was approved on 16 January 1959. The LIEMPTY

Project, renamed the KDFACTOR Project in 1971, consisted of three photo

basehouses, two viewing the front of the Soviet Embassy (LIMITED and

LILYRIC) and one viewing the rear garden of the Soviet Embassy (LICALLA),

plus a mobile surveillance team (LIENTRAP) tied closely with the LIMITED

basehouse, which was the radio control point for dispatch of the LIENTRAP.

• In 1959 the LIENTRAP surveillance vehicle and two team

members were arrested at the scene of a Cuban demonstration in Mexico

City.

A Station review of the security implications of this incident stated

that it did not materially alfect the security of the project nor exyose any

of the LIEMPTY basehouse operations.

(Note: As the basehouse operations

were compartmented, the only exposure possible from this incident would

have been of the LIMITED basehouse, which is no longer in existence.)

The LIEMPTY Project operated substantially as above until

the Warren Commission report was published in late 1964. In this publica-

tion was a picture of a person entering the Soviet Embassy taken from the

LIMITED basehouse.

The LIMITED photo basehouse was closed in Sept-

ember 1964, and all photographic surveillance was suspended as a security

precautio!

In January 1965 the LIMITED basehouse was relocated, and

later that year the building it had previously been in was razed by the

owner, KDABBEY-l. From 1964 on it must be assumed that the Soviel

Embassy in Mexico City belleves it is under regular photographic sur-

veillance.

Further project changes took place in 1966 when the LILYRIC

basehouse was relocated to another apartment with approximately the

same view, In May 1968 the LIMITED basehouse was terminated and

LIEMPTY-6, the basehouse keeper, retired. This affected the LIENTRAP

coverage of Soviet vehleular movement monitored and directed from the

LIMITED basehouse. With the closing of LIMITED and the Station decision

to replace Raymond H. GERENDE, Mexican national contract agent who

handled the LEMPTY Project since its inception, the LIENTRAP mobile

surveillance team was underemployed, and the decision was made to move

it to the LEMBRACE Project.

This was done in early 1970, soon after

GERENDE had been relieved of operational responsibilities in December

1969.

The photo processing of the KDFACTOR (formerly LIEMPTY)

film take is now being done by the Station. In the past, it was done by

the Station, by GERENDE, and by KDFACTOR-1, who was terminated

amicably in early 1971. The building housing the KDLITERAL (formerly

LICALLA) photo basehouse was purchased in 1957 by KDABBEY-1 for

the Station. KDLITERAL is in a row of four houses all owned ostensibly

by KDABBEY-l but actually by the Agency. This row also houses a base-

house for FID's KDVAULT Project. The apartment building housing the

KDABSINTHE (formerly LILYRIC) photo basehouse is owned outright by

KDABBEY-1, who has been most cooperative in assisting the Station in

maintaining and occasionally moving (1965 and 1966) photo basehouses.

The LIMITED photo basehouse was also located on KDABBEY-l's property

when it was active.

The individual basehouse operations are and have always been

compartmented one from the other. The only points of breakdown in the

compartmentation have been: (a) the LIMITED basehouse was linked to

the LIENTRAP mobile surveillance; (b) KOFACTOR-I was processing

films from all the basehouses and could, therefore, be aware of thei

exact locations; (c) GERENDE was aware of all aspects of the KDFACTOR

operation, and has since been terminated; (d) Oliver G. SCANTLING,

Station contract agent retired in 1971, was aware of the KDFACTOR Project

through his past work with LIEMPTY-6 and with GERENDE on KDFACTOR

Project activities: and (e) the fact that the two present basehouse properties

are ouned by KDABBEY-l, who is witting of the locationg and general

activity of both KDFACTOR basehouses..

Regarding the security of the above active KDFACTOR agents,

the KDLITERAL basehouse is handled by KDFACTOR-? with the assistance

of his wife, KDFACTOR-10. They have a long-time maid and a 13-year-

old son who lives with them in the basehousc. Neither the son nor the maid

is believed to be witting. The photographic equipment is kept in a locked

room, and the product is kept in a locked safe.

KDFACTOR-2 was recruited

by KDCALVERT-1, who is an active, long-term Station agent in the

KDCALVERT Project and who is not considered a threat to KDFACTOR-2's

security. KDFACTOR-2's activities are also known to his brother, the

former LIPSTICK-47, who was one of the two LIPSTICK surveillance team

members arrested in 1958 and who gave the police considerable information

and his family have occupied the KDLITERAL basehouse since 1957 and

have been discreet and security conscious in their dealings with neighbors

and relatives.

The KDABSINTHE basehouse is manned by KDFACTOR-5, his

wife KDFACTOR-6, and his two sons KDFACTOR-8 and KDFACTOR-9.

The SGSWIRL of 2 March 1966 went into detail on who is witting of

KDFACTOR-5's work for the Station. The result was that his immediate

family, including a married daughter who no longer lives at the basehouse,

are aware of the photographic operation. KDFACTOR-5 was recruited by

LIEMPTY-12, a U., S. citizen with a private company in Mexico City who.

is no longer working with the Station but who is considered patriotic and

no threat to KDFACTOR security.

4. Terminated Agents Possibly Allecting Present Project Security:

A. Raymond H. GERENDE

GERENDE is a Mexican citizen and was a contract agent

until his termination on 26 June 1970. He had been employed by the Station

Intermittently since 1955 and was used almost exclusively in support activities.

Since the start of the LIEMPTY Project in 1958 GERENDE had been directly

involved with this project serving as cutout to the basehouses, carrying and

processing films, and giving general direction to the project as principal

agent. In 1969, after years of excellent service with the Station, GERENDE

had serious marital problems which ended in separation from his wife,

5, and geare of excellent so i co

KDFACTOR-7. From December 1969 to June 1970 GERENDE was not used

operationally but was maintained on half pay with the hope the divorce pro-

ceedings would be completed quickly. When it became apparent the divorce

would drag on interminably, the Station reluctantly terminated GERENDE

and his wile.

Bruce h. FERNALD, career agent, met with GoRenDe

monthly from July 1970 through May 1971 while paying him his termination

bonus in ten installments. GERENDE is still living in Mexico City, where

• he owns sume proverty and has an income as an English teacher to employees

of two local firms.

He visited his wife and children in Holland in December

1970. It appears he may now be financially pressed as his English class

schedule has been cut back.

The Station as of 10 April 1972 had no informa-

tion that would indicate GE RENDE has violated his secrecy agreement.

There is an indication that GERENDE came to the attention

of the Soviets in 1968. A Mexican walk-in to the FBI office in Mexico City,

who was later interrogated by the Federal Security Police in 1970, said

that in 1968 he had been employed by the Soviet Embassy Second Secretary,

Oleg Masksimovich Nechiporenko (201-305870), to investigate persons

working with the Mexican Olympic Committee. The persons investigated

Included GERENDE, who apparently became a specific target of Soviet

investigation. It is unclear from the report of the Federal Security Police

how far the Soviet Investigation of GERENDE had proceeded. Nechiporenko

wa's PNG'd from Mexico in March 1971. GERENDE's possible exposure to

B. KDFACTOR-7 (wife of GERENDE)

HE-E

KDFACTOR-? is a Dutch citizen and the former wife of

GE REnDE.

She returned to the Netherlands in July 1970 with her children.

She had served as a support agent assisting GERENDE. She is believed

witting, in general terms, of GERENDE's activities regarding the KDFACTOR

Project.

She was terminated on 26 June 1970 and signed both a secrecy

agreement and quit claim.

After termination it became apparent that she

had considerable hard feelings toward both the Agency and GERENDE over

financial problems between her family and GERENDE. While the Station

was not directly involved in all the financial problems, the Station was

Involved in regard to her divorce claims against GERENDE's salary, a

large part of which came covertly from the Station. In July 1970 KDFACTOR-7

came to the Agency Headquarters and complained about her financial settle-

ment. In September and November 1970 she wrote two letters directly to

the Agency on the same subject. In late 1970 she also asked a Hague Embassy

political officer to put her in contact with the Agency; however, she did not

tell him the nature of her business. In January 1971 the Agency contacied

KDFACTOR-'i's brother, a U. S. Army civilian with a 'Top Secret"' clearance

living in Alexandria, Virginia, and was able to resolve the financial mis-

understandings with KDFACTOR-7. In January 1971 the Hague Station

reported KDFACTOR had, without Station influence, obtained a job as social

breed in ecold rep on ACT The kerosy in the Hague ias

C. KDFACTOR-1

KDFACTOR-1 is a Mexican citizen and the brother-in-law

of GERENDE. He was hired by the Station in 1956 to assist GERENDE in

processing the photographic take of the KDFACTOR Project (at that time

the LIPSTICK Project and later the LIEMPTY Project), ADFACTOR-1

was later assisted in processing the photographic take by his wife,

LIEMPTY-5, who is GERENDE's sister.

KDFACTOR-1 was terminated

ii March 1971, and the photographic processing previously done by

KDF ACTOR-1 is now done in the Station.

and largely due to delays in film processing as KDFACTOR-l's medical

practice expanded. There does not appear to be any security problem

in the termination of KDFACTOR-l as he is discreet and also a close

TRACTOR as he is die

relative of GERENDE. The security of processing the film in KDFACTOR-l's

medical office was good as KDFACTOR-l's wife, LIEMPTY-5, was assist-

ing him with the processing and with the security of the darkroom.

D. LIEMPTY-5

LIEMPTY-S was hired by the Station in 1957 to assist

KDFACTOR-1 with the processing of KDFACTOR films.

She is the sister

of GERENDE and wife of KDFACTOR-l. She was terminated along with

KDFACTOR-1 in March 1971.

Due to her close relationship with GERENDE

and KDFACTOR-1, she is not considered a threat to the Project Security.

E. Oliver G. SCANTLING

SCANTLING is a Mexican citizen who worked as a Station

agent from 1954 until his termination without prejudice in February 1971.

SCANTLING is in an excellent financial position and has assisted the

Station in recent years largely because his strong motivation to work

against the Communists. SCANTLING worked as a surveillance team

leader from 1954 to 1957 and then in the LIEMPTY (KDFACTOR) Project

from 1958 through 1966.

principal agent for GERENDE. SCANTLING's termination was amicable,

and he is not considered a security problem to the Station or the KDFACTOR

Project.

F. LEMPTY-6

LIEMPTY-6, a Mexican citizen and long-term Station

asset, was retired in May 1968.

He had manned the LIMITED photo base-

house with his wife and son assisting him. He had been working with the

Station since 1954, but age and ill health had reduced his efficiency.

LIEMPTY-6 knows GERENDE and SCANTLING, but is not aware of the

names or locations of any of the present KDFACTOR agents and basehouses.

While he could give information on his participation in KDFACTOR activities

up to 1968, he has no motive to do this and is apparently happily retired on

his Agency termination bonus plus some financial assistance from his son-

in-law. He is not considered a threat to the security of this Project.

There was one indication that the Sovlets were seeking

ut the-LIMITED photo basehouse and may have had suspicions. concernins

MEMPTY-6. This was a report by NDADAGE-10 that in mid-1966 Stanisla

Sergeyevich Silnikov (201-271103), a Soviet Embassy guard, asked KDADAGE-

10 to report on his neighbors near the Soviet Embassy. Silnikov expressed

interest in all the occupants of the new apartment building which houses the

NDABSINTHE photo basehouse, but did not mention the KDABSINTHE base-

house keepers by name. Silnikov did name specific persons he was inter-

ested in and these included LIEMPTY-6. KDADAGE-10, of unknown

reliability, said he did not give Silnikov any information,

between himself and the Station, he suspected LIEMPTY-6 and had heard

it rumored he worked for the Americans. In 1966 Headquarters already

assumed the Soviets were aware of the LIMITED basehouse because it was

used for radio direction of the LIENTRAP mobile surveillance. In any case,

the Soviets apparently took no action prior to the closing of the LIMITED

basehouse and the relocation of LIENPTY-6 in May 1968.

this incident has no implications that would threaten the security of current

NOFACTOR assets.

5.. Current KDFACTOR Security Practices:

The two photo basehouses, KDLITERAL and KDABSINTHE

remain compartmented, as they. have been throughout the history of the

Project.

The Station case officer responsible for the project meets weekly

with KDFACTOR-2, responsible for the KDLITERAL basehouse, and with

NDF ACTOR-5, responsible for the ADABSINTHE basehouse.

In these

meetings he picks up the product, provides new supplies, pays salaries

and handles miscellaneous administrative matters.

These are car meetings

usually held in early morning or at night and the pickup puints are changed

regularly. Meeting time is kept to a minimum and meetings are pre-

scheduled whenever possible. The photographic product is processed in

the Station, thus increasing the security and timeliness of its handling

over the past practice of having NDFACTOR-1 process it in his office

darkroom. The case officer only meets with KDFACTOR-2 and KDFACTOR-5;

however, in emergencies other witting family members of either basehouse

Cil be contacted and met. In case the present sites or personnel are com-

promised, the Station has rented another apartment in the building housing

the KDABSINTHE basehouse and has installed members of the KDCALVERT

Project as residents. This new apartment offers as good a vantage point

This information was turned over to LnErGO, which

In reneral, LILYRIC provides

the

tarset, such as automobile license

actirities such as demonstrations, unusual or lengthy

Injormation also has

positive operational value,

but its most important use 1s as

the mior source of identification of FISTrAl personnel and

ni information on thris movements.

The Station has frequent

requests from LNiRGO which can only be fulfilled by LIMITY

MEMORANDUN FOR: Assistant Deputy Director Plans

SUBJECT: Supplementary Appropriation for LIEMPTY

It is requested that the figures in the attached

field project renewal be amended and that an additional

$26,205 be approved to cover the period 1 December 1968

through 30 June 1969 in order to carry the LIEMPTY Project

to the end of a fiscal year.

This sum is identical to that

requested for a similar period in 1968 as there is no

present justification for projecting any change in th

financial

requirements.

The supplement would bring the

cost of LIEMPTY to a total of $69,725 for 19 months.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director for Plans

SUBJECT

: LIEMPTY Project Renewal

1.

Renewal of Project LIEMPTY for the period 1 Decem

ber 1967 through 30 November 1968 in the amount of $13,520

is hereby requested. $26,205 would be spent in FY 1968 and

$17,315 In FY 1969.

The project was budgeted for $45,000 for

FY 1968; funds are available within the Division.

Estimated

costs for the coming project year are a little less than the

amount programmed for the previous year and a little more

than what was actually disbursed.

3.

LIEMPTY is designed to provide physical surveil-

lance of the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City. It covers three

nearby properties (two in front of the Embassy's sole entrance

and one behind the garden) fron which visual and photographic

surveillance are carricd out by experienced personnel.

The

project also covers a darkroom where a technician processes

the photographs.

In addition to collecting this basic informa-

tion on a primary target, certain of the LIEMPTY personnel

are also available for miscellaneous support tasks, such

as

servicing postal boxes, and running fixed and moving surveil-

lances.

The photo truck which comes under the project is

used on other targets as well, such as CP members, satellite

embassies, and Latin American exiles.

One of the basehouses

is also used as a radio dispatch point for the LIEMBRICE sur-

veillance team, but this function has been minimized during

the past year in an effort to prevent Soviet interception of

the signal.

The Mexican desk asked the appropriate opera-

tional component of SB Division for specific comment on the

value of LIEIPTY, and received the following:

"This rather unique operation has

unquestionably made a major contribu-

third natlonal contacts of the Soviets,

from which

we must select and develop

the access agents so vital to our oper-

ations against the Soviet human target.

LIEMPTY also provides us with a much

clearer picture of the inner relation-

ships and activity patterns within the

Soviet mission itself, which in turn

racilitates effective targeting.

The

CE value of a LIEMPTY type project a.

a monitor of real and potential agent

contacts is of course obvious.

It 1s

important to note that LIEMPTY is not,

as might be the case in stations of

lesser overall capability, a simple

case of photography (or observation)

for the record.

Rather it is an import-

ant facet of a concerted high priority

effort to get at and recruit individual

Sóviets."

It is clear that the FBI is an interested customer and they

have received from LIENPTY a great many reports

on American

callers at the Soviet Embassy, and valuable support to double

agent operations.

During a conversation on 8 December 1967, the

officer who heads the station's SB section told the branch

that LIENPTY is basic and essential to all of his branch's

operational planning, that he "grabs the LIEUPTY material

first thing in the morning and studies it for leads, evidence

of which Soviet officers have been in the Embassy ana which

of the new case

in the spring of 1967.

In assessing the security of the operation, the

station assumes that the Soviets rcalize that they are being

watched, as was. evidenced by a Soviet officer's trying to

shield an FBI-directed walk-in from observation.

There have

been rumors that anyone entering the Soviet Embassy is photo-

graphed, but no allegations that the Americans are doing it

have come to our attention; the probable assumption is that

the Nexicans are doing this.

A former source who lives in

the neighborhood was asked on several occasions what he knew

about LIEUPTY/6, one of the safchousekeepers,

and the Soviets

have said they

think he is watching them.

On the security of

the LICILLA safehouse there is a difference of opinion.

GERENDE, the outside case officer, thinks

the Soviets are

aware that they are being observed from this post,

but station

disagrecs and produces good justification for its views, cit-

ing the fact that the above-mentioned FBI walk-in was not

shielded when led into the back garden which LICALLA overlooks.

We have no evidence that Soviet interest is any threat to the

operation; rather it may be assumed that they accept the sur-

veillance as a fact of life.

PROJECT LIEMPTY

REQUEST FOR RENEWAL

1.

CURRENT OBJECTIVES

• The overall objective of Project LialPty,

now in its tenth

year of existence,

1s to collect operational information on the

FISTEAL installation, Its personnel and visitors, as well as

related targets of opportunity through stationary/molile photo-

graphic and physical surveillance mechanisms. Corollary

objectives which are to be fulfilled through use of the LIEMPTY

installations, mechanisms and personnel are as follow:

To provide detailed operational information pertaining

dally movements and activitles of the FISTEAL

personnel, particularly those individuals of Intelligence

interest,

as well as information on the FJSTEAL physical

plant and visitors to the premises.

2. To collect operatioual information on persons associated

with FJSTFAL persoonel and on individuals known or suspected

to have connections with the FJSTEAL intelligence services

or other hostile groups which are inimical to the interests

of INFORT.

To provide operational support, counter survelllance

other protective services to WOFIRM personnel and

operations, as may be levied upon the Station of as may be

deemed necessary.

B.

The above objectives are to be fulfilled through continued

maintenance and

exploitation of the LIMITED, LILYRIC and LICALLA

basehouses,

the LIENTRAP mobile unit, and the services of long-

time contract agent, Raymond H. GERENDE.

These objectives are

in consonance with

operational directives and Headquarters

requirements as received by Station Mexico City.

Throughout the Project year under review, Project LIEMPTY

continued to

contribute directly and significantly to the fulfil-

of Station and Headquarters' requests and requirements for

coverage of various

targets faling within the above cited frame-

During the project year Project LIEMPTY provided nearly

ill of the operational photorraphs and physical surveillance

reports used in Mexico City Station's operations targeted agains

the FJSTEAL installation and personnel.

Specific examples of the

LIESPTY Project's progress and contributions will be found in

To this end, LIEMBRACE-l has been placed

in direct contact with LIENTRAP, relieving Raymond H. GERENDE

of this responsibility and permitting GERINDE to devote time

to MHRAVEL activity (see sub-paragraph (3) below).

In September and October 1967 GERENDE was employed by

the Mexican SHRIVEL committee.

This position gave him direct

access to FJSTEll and other delegationg of interest, and

supplemented the Station's MHRAVEL progral.

B. Summary of Fixed Bisehouse kiffectiveness

The fixed LIESPTY basehouses (LIMITED, LICALLA and LILYRIC)

provided approximately lo,oos individual frames of oper-

stional photographs during the 12-month period of the past

project year:

This photographic coverage, linked with

physical

surveillance

reports prepared by

each basehouse,

has proven to be a most reliable and viable tool for:

1.

ollowing the daily comings and goings of

'JSTML personnel and indigenous employees.

2.

Confirming the identities of FJSTEAL staffers

and their visitors (sone of whom are NOLADY citizeng).

Ascertaining and verifying the relative rank and

position as

well as indicating the

specific intelligence

service connection of various FJSTEAL officers.

Providing detailed reporting on the movement and

habit patterns of selected targets of special interest.

5. Providing physical facilities for the support of

various operational, technical and

surveillance

operations.

C. The Mobile Photographic Unit

Throughout the period under review, the LIENTRAP mobile

photographic support unit mas regularly exploited and used

but

also for PBRUMEN and Commurist Party operations as

as

the JMTIGER program.

Over

2,000 operational photographs were

provided.

In addition, the LIENTRAP personnel and unit

was used regularly to service and obtain various postal

accomodation boxes used by Mexico City, Headquarters and

other field stations.

While no major changes are

contemplated, every effort will be made to continue to

improve

the product, including greater use of GERENDE as

an independent irvestigative asset,

and as a spotter and

assessor

of selected agent candidates.

Such utilization

of GERINDE will be kept compartmented from other personnel

of the LIEMPTY project and will normally be handled by

GERENDE in operational alias.

COSTS

'Past Project Year- PrOJeCt LIEMPTY was previously approved

for the poriod 1 December 1966 through 30 November 1967 for the

amount of 45,000 U.S. currency, Station records indicate that

through 31 October 1967, Project LIEMPTY has expended 37,040 1n

the field.

•It. is estimated that a total of 40

130 will be expended

In the entire project year.

Bi-weekly accountings with pertinent

receipts and/or certifications were submitted by Raymond H. GERENDE

to the Station finance officer via the project case officer for all

LIEMPTY Project expenditures made in the field.

It is estimated

that approximately 5 hours of case officer and 10 hours of analyst

time is required each week to julfill the operational, administrative

and analytical requirements of this project.

(This figure doos not

include the 40 hour-week put in regularly by Raymond H. GERINDE).

B.

During Project Year - It is requested that Project LIEMPTY be

approved

in

the amount of 43,520 U.S. currency for the period l

December 1967 through 30 November 1968 (this figure represents &

slight decrease from the amount programmed for the previous project

year).

While no large expenditures are anticipated for the replace-

ment of photographic equipment during the forthcoming period, an

increase in the rental af

the various basehouses may be encountered

as well as the above-cited expectation of salary increases.

Of the

amount requested above,

26,205 dollars should be allowed for fiscal

year

1968

and 17,315 dollars for fiscal year 1969.

EMERGENCY CONDITIONS

In the event of civil disorders or the evolution of complete

enforced neutrality on the part of the host government, it is

now belleved that regular operational contact could be maintained

with the majority of the active LIMPTY agents via Raymond i.

GERENDE or in his absence, Oliver G. SCANTLING.

B. In the most unlikely event of the establishment of a regime

openly hostile to LNFORT, limited contact could probably be

maintained with the majority of the active project agents.

lowever, under the circumstances described above,

it is highly

probable that the activities of this project rould be somewhat

curtailed.

(LIENPTYs -O and -T) personnel in the new buildini, and to retein the sane,

qual division of vorcload between LYRIC anu LIMMKD, at was later

culued to nove the present LILYRIC basehouse personnel (LIENPTYs-13, -14

-26 and -27) Into the new bade inctead, along with the following ancillary

modifications:

n increase in the hours of both the photo raphic ard physical surveillene

overage proviled fron the new base by the LILYRIC operztors (C800-150.

hours) durin the weekdays and to have the LIMITED base provide

photographic and pijsical curveillence coverage frna 1600-1630 hours

on usekdajs anù fron 0900-1300 hours on weekends. These changes were

dictated by the rollowin; considerations:

1. The new LIMOUSINE building offers a such better vantage point

for both photographic and physical surveillance than does the

present coplex which housen the LILITIC end LIMINaD bases.

Thererore,

the Station "elt that the personnel occupying this

new base should be those possessing the highest technicel skills

and also titose able to provide the cost thorougn ani couplete

coverage. Since the LIMITeD base now hes only one treined

operator while the LILYRIC baschouse hes three, the LILyic group

and a revision or vorkins hours was indicatel.

Because It was epparent that the coverace of the LIMERICK

inctallation would be a lonó-range and continuin, requiresent,

the Statior desired to staff the new bese with personnel of long-

range potential.

LIaIPIY-6, now alnost 60 years oli, does not

posses: this potential; horever, the lulufuc agent corplex

happily corbines experienced personiel sith youthful ajents.

3. Firally, the social and financial status of the Liberto

personnel is ruch more compatible and consistent with the en-

vironsent of the nel building than is that of the LIMITED faelly.

The above-cite: revised work schedule was

initiated in July 196ó end

the actual soresent of the LILnIcs Into the new bese beges in late

Septenber 1965.

(For the Purpose of Project Renewal)

I.

CURRENT OBJECTIVES AND PRODUCTION

A. Oliver G. SCANTLING Segment (discussed In relation to project

objecives) :

"To collect upcrational Information pertaining to LIMERICK

personnel and physical facilitles.

" SCANTLING has contInued (See the

last two Project Reviews forwarded as attachments to HiMiMA-140%5,

13 November 1959, and HMMA - 15979, 18 November 1960) to provide

worthwhile Information pertaining to this objective.

a. During the past year SCANTLING has continued to be

used to follow up leads produced by LIENVOY. For example,

operational information recently indicated that the LIMERICK

target was using the services of a Mexico City firm to repair

safes. Through discreet investigation SCANTLING was able to:

identify the firm, is location and the name of the owner In the

event that we later wished to make an approach to him or to

exploit this information in another manner.

b. SCANTLING Is still the Station's primary source for

keeping current records on the residences of the many LIMERICK

personnel in Mexico City. This Is accomplished in several ways;

the most important being SCANTLING's follow up of all LIeNvO

leads which indicate the LIMERICK people are interested i

renting a given piece of property. (See previous project renewal

request for additional detalls).

2. "To collect operational Information pertaining to other targets

of opportunity, foreign official installations and personnel of intelligence

interest operaring in Mexico." SCANTLING Is very useful for collecting

information on other Station targets:

SECRET/

---

## Page 219

SECRET ASHER

-2-

a. On the basle of a request to the Station from the

ODACID Chief, SCANTLING was sent to Puebla to be an

eyewitness to the 4 June 1961 Catholic inspired anti-CASTRO

demonstrations.

Not only did SCANTLING obtain the desired

Information, and samples of many of the leaflets used, but he

prepared his report for the Station in time for the COS to give

the ODACID Chief a briefing at 1000 hrs., 5 June 1961.

SCANTLING does an excellent Job on this type of assignment

due principally to his ability to observe and report objectively.

b. SCANTLING was instrumental in establishing that

Fernando LLANES Cavero and his wife were living at a local

Mexico City address. This case has been of considerable

counterespionage interest to Headquarters.

c. SCANTLING has continued his contributions to the

Paul Frederick KIRSCHHOFF case by periodic interviews with

the subject's neighbors and associates.

3. "To exploit operational leads through recruitments, debriefings,

and survelllances." SCANTLING has contributed to this objective both

directly and indirectly as will be noted by the examples listed below :

a. SCANTLING devoted a lot of time to the

surveillance and attempted recruitment of Abel ARTEAGA, a

Mexican national employed at the Cuban Embassy, SCANTLING

talked with ARTEAGA several times and undoubtedly was

primarily responsible for the later success of the recruiment

nade by another Statlon agent.

b. Some additional time was devored to the Cesar

GONZALEZ Sanchez case in February 1961 when SCANTLING

determined that GONZALEZ was still in Mexico City. Sce

the last renewal for additional details on this case.

c. In connection with the above objective SCANTI.ING

has performed numerous pretext and neighborhood investigations

for the Station, SCANTLING also does most of the local

Investigations requested by ODACID and other ODYOKE

SECRET/KE

-3-

d. SCANTLING spent six weeks during July and

August of this ycar glving tradecraft and surveillance

tralning to LIPAILS 5 and 7 from Monterrey. Although

this is not a direct contribution to the above objective, it

Is considered sufficlently related to mention here,

4. In addition to his contributions to the above objectives,

SCANTLING is used for miscellancous support requirements from the

Station, For example, SCANTLING Is now handling LIEMBROIL-2 and

will contInue to do so untll the rcturn of LIMOTOR -14 in June 1962. Also,

dustng the past project year, SCANTLING handled the LIRICE survelllance

team untll July 1961 when Sinon D. CLACKETT (ps) returned to Mexico

City. SCANTLING Is also used to spot and rent safe houses and apartments

for other Station operatlons.

5. As stated in the preceding Requests for Project Renewal,

although SCANTLING'& LIEMPTY Project objectives can never be completely

fulfilled, It. le the Station'& opinion that SCANTLING has made important and

valuable contributions to LIEMPTY Project objectives specifically and to

other Station activitles In general, SCANTLING's production, measured

against monetary expendilures, case officer time and other intangible factors,

unquest lonably justifies his continuation as an integral part of Project

LIEMPTY.

B.

Raymond H, GERENDE Segment (discussed in relatlon to project

objectives):

1. "To collect operational Information pertaining to LIMERICK

personnel and physical facilitles through use of photographic base houses."

Three photographic bases, LIMITED, LILYRIC and LICALLA, contribute

to this objective. To avoid repetitior, the Station is omitting the usual

description of the functions of these three bases and how they contribute

to the above objective. There has been no change in the coverage as

described In the 1960 Request for Project Renewal.

2. "To collect operational information and Identify operational

leads pertaining to Statlon targets of opportunity." The LIENTRAP

operation, handled by GERENDE, Is still the major contributor to this

SECRET/RANK

---

## Page 221

• SECRET/A

-4-

objective.

la addition to performing numerous photographic assignments

in support of ocher Station operations, LIENTRAP devoted neariy four

months, on a fulltime basis, to coverage of the LIBRODE operation. For

several weeks the entire "take" from the LIERODE target was recorded

from the LIEVTRAP vehicle. Later, the LIENTRAP agents operated the

LIERODE rechnical gear from the initial LIERODE stationary base.

3. "To provide operational support to Station operations, i.e.:

rent hotel rooms and apartments, and conduct counter-surveillances.

GERENDE is used frequently to rent hotel rooms and apartments for other

Station operations and activities. GERENDE's comprehensive area

knowledge ard personal operational capabilities combine to make him an

extremely valuable Station asset for such support acrivities. GERENDE

also procures and services post office box letter drops for the many

Station operations requiring them.

4. The quality and quantity of operational information produced

by the photographic bases and other activities under GERENDE's control

and supervision is considered worthwhile. The Station concludes, therefore,

that this segment of the LIEMPTY Project should be continued.

C. Relarionship to Related Mission Directive Objectives:

As stated in the previous project renewal, it can readily be noted

that Projec: LIEMPTY has provided support to many Station operations and

in this manner has been a contributing factor to the furthereance of the

Related Mission Directive.

The project has not produced any positive

intelligence nor has it been intended that it should do so.

purpose is to provide a mechanism for the development of operational

Information in support of other Station operations.

I1.

CHANGES

There have been no changes in the LIEMPTY Project during the past project

year except that SCAVTLING relinquished control of the LIRICE (formerly LIJERSEY)

survelllance team in july 1961 in accordance with previous plans.

EFFECTIVENESS

There has been no change in Project LIEMPTY which would alter the

validity of the remarks made In Section Ill of last year's project renewal request.

IV. PROBLEMS

The security problem in connection with the LICALLA operatlon, which

was described in last year's renewal request, Is still present but has not caused

any known difficulty. At Headquarters suggestion in HMMW-9736, the LICALLA

base was reactivaied on 29. May 1961. The hase operator has been cautioned to be

ever alert for any unusual incidents which might indicate that the base has been

compromised.

This is the only problem experienced by the LIEMPTY Project

during the past project year.

V. PLANS

The Station considers that the project is now operating at its optimum size

and does not plan to expand it during the coming year.

Rather, efforts will be

devoted to refining and better utilizing the existing project organizational

arrangements.

vI.

COSTS

A. Pasi Project Year - Station finance records indicate that Project LIEMPTY

expended $21, 458. 00 during Fiscal Year 1961 (1 December 1960 - 30 June 1961) and

has thus far during Fiscal Year 1962 (through 30 September 1961) expended about

$11, 000.00. It is anticipated that about $8, 000. 00 will be expended during the last

two months (October and November 1961) of the project. year. This will make :

toral the diet elim to 55%00.0. of about $40, 500, 00, or some $12, 500,00

B. Ensuing Period - Of the total $49, 500. 00 budget, itemized be.low,

$29, 500. 00 should be expended during the remainder of Fiscal Year 1962 and th

balance, $20, 000. 00 should be expended during Fiscal Year 1963. Normal accountin

procedures will be used for all expenditures.

EXTENSION: 2015/3a820n Hall

DATE: 13 December 1960

It is requested that the LIEMPTY Project be renewed for the

period 1 December 1960 through 30 November 1961 for a total of

$53,000; $31,900 for Aiscal year 1961 and $21,100 for fiscal year

1962. The LIEMPTY Project was programmed for $85,000.

During the

past project year, approximately $59,880 was obligated.

?. This Project provides operational support to the Station

and is not a source of positive intelligence.

Examples of opera

tional data developed through this project are given in paragraph I

of the attached Station Review of Project LIENPTY.

There have been

no disseminations made at Headquarters of intelligence produced

through LI EMPTY.

• The only training provided LIMPTY peRsonnel durdng the

eriod under revlew was given to Reymond H

training in basic flaps and seals techniques so that the Station will

have a trained agent outside the Station who will be able to provide

this service if required.

No further training for GRRENDE of any of

the other LIEMPTY agents is being contemplated for the coming year.

Attached for the informution of the Staffs is a dispatch

from the Station (HMMA-14793) dated 8 April 1960 which answers the

questions raised at the time of the last renewal,

Also team airice the departure of

Simon D. CLACKETT in Auguet 1960.

It is hoped that

SCANTLING can be relieved of this assignment as soon

as the LITENPO project is approved.

SCANTLING has also

been used to spot and rert safe houses for various

Station operations, a valuable operational support

service.

As stater in the preceeding Request for project

Renewal, al though SCANTLING'S LIE.PTY Project objectives

can never be completely fulfilled, it is the Station's

opinion that SCANTLING has made important and valuable

contributiona to LIENFTY Preject objectives specifically

This Information is particularly useful in keeping track of

LIMERICK personel and assisting with the identification of

visitors to the installation, Also, LIMITED maintains a

summary attendance list of LIMERICK employees on a dally

basis; this enables the Station quickly to ascertain the

presence or absence of an employee on any given day.

Finally, one other significant service is performed by this

base; the radio dispatching of the LLEMBRACE survelllance

team on LIMERICK personnel and targets of opportunity,

LIMITED's photographic.coverage is still concentrated on

visitors, as opposed to employees, to the LIMERICK

Installation, A recent example of the base's contributions to

Station efforts Is the case of Joseph Ralph MAURI. In this

case, a LIENVOY lead indicated that an American might visit

the LIMERICK target on a certaln day. The base was alerted

to dispatch the radlo-controlled survelllance team on any

person appearing to be an American,

The results of this

assignment were indicated in MEXI-6392 and several other

cables.

LIMITED was also able to provide photographs,

which when compared with photographs provided by Head-

quarters, left no question as to MAURI's identity.

b. LILYRIC - This base's output of high-quality clandestine

photographs has been in about the same quantity as last year.

In addition, the base operator, LIEMPTY-I4, prepares weekly

reports on LIMERICK empioyees and their wires, TILYRIC

aisu performs the assignment of noting and reporting the

Ilcense plate numbers of all cars bringing visitors to the

LIMERICK installation. LILYRIC photograplis also are con•

centrated on visitors to the target, as opposed to employces

It should be noted that LILYRIC operates for photographic

coverage during the hours from daylight to 1400 hours each

day of the week except Sunday. The LIMITED base maintains

photographic coverage from 1400 hours to darkness each day

except Sunday.

LIEMPTY-9, supplies extremely worthwhile information

pertaining to the apparent positions and jobs of the target

employees. Me accomplishes this objective by careful

observation and analysis. LICALLA also maintans a dally

attendance roster of all LIMERICK employees. LICALLA

coverage of the target, both photographic and physical

abservations, enables the Station to keep abrest of LIMERICK

personnel changes, a vital contribution to the Station's counter-

esplonage effort.

2. "To collect operational Information and Identify operat lonal leads

pertaining to Station targets of opportunity." The LIENTRAP operation,

handled by GERENDE, Is the major contributor to this objective, It

has been possible for LIENTRAP to lake photographs and to perform

pretext Investigations in support of numerous Station activitles. The

cases listed below are cited as examples:

a. Li the case of Cesar GONZALEZ Sanchez (see I, A, 3, a, above)

LIENTRAP was able to procure photographs of GONZALEZ, at his

Maxico City residence which, when compared to Headquarters

provided photographs, left no doubt that CONZALEZ was the

subject of interest to Heudquarters.

b. LIENTRAP confirmed the Identity of Olga CASTILLO de Ledon,

& frequent visitor to the LIMERICK Installation and an ardent

supporter of the present Cuban regime, through a pretext

investigation of the residents of an apart ment huilding where

CASTILLO was belleved to live. Later, LIENTRAP supported the

results of the investigation with excellent photographs of the

3. "To provide operational support to Station operations, i.e., rent

hotel roorns and apartments, and conduct counter-survelllances."

GERENDE is used frequently to rent hotel rooms and apartments for

other Station operations and actlvities, GERENDE's comprehensive

area knowledge and personal operational capabilities combine to make

him an extremely valuable Station asset for such support activities.

GERENDE also procures post office box letter drops for the many

Station operarions requiring them.

4. It is the Station's conclusion that the money and case officer ilme

expended on this segment of the LIEMPTY project la worthwhile and

should be continued in vlew of the quality and quanilty of operational

information produced.

C. Simon D. CLACKETT Segment (discussed In relation to project

objectives):

1. "To collect operational information and to identify operational leads

pertaining to the LIMERICK target and Station targets.of opportunity."

During this project year the LUJERSEY survelllance team under the

direction of CLACKETT began contributing to the Station's support

efforts through pretext Investigattons and physical survelllances. Some

examples of the ream's work are listed below:

a. Rafael TISCHLER Guzman (201-64372) Is a Guatemalan

Communist which the team had under survelllance from

November 1959 to April 1960. The survelllance, together

with information acquired from other sources, eventually

resulted in an unsuccessful recruitment attempt on TISCHILER.

b. Pericles FRANCO Ornes (201-64546) - FRANCO Is a

Dominican of interest to the Station. The LIJERSEY ream

devoted portions of five momhs, January to May 1960, collecting

information on subject through physical surveillance.

c.. Jose Maria "Chema" LOPEZ Valdizon (201-

was the

subject of a physical surveillance during May and June 1960.

LUrEL was ialer deported from viexico through the efroris

of LITEMPO-2.

d. CLACKETT and the LIJERSEY team performed numerous

pretext Investigations on Station targets of opportunity and or

hree separate occasions during the project year served as

a counter-surveillance escort for Station officers in other

operations.

2. CLACKETT, just prior to his resignation in August 1960, spent

about five weeks giving tradecraft and operational skills training to

LITEA-1.

Although not specifically covered by the project objectives,

this ability on CLACKETT's part is considered a significant con-

tribution to the Station's support efforts.

3. In vlew of CLACKETT's resignation, which was effective 31

August 1960, and the proposed transfer of the LIJERSEY team to

the LITEMPO project, this segment of the LIEMPTY project will

not be renewed. However, for the record, it is considered that •

the CLACKETT segment of LIEMPTY was worthwhile and the

expenditure of Station assets In connection with LIJERSEY operations

were justliled.

• D. Relatlonship to Related Mission Directive Objectives:

It can readilỹ be noted that Project LIEMPTY has provided support to

many Statlon operations and in this manner has been a contrIbuting factor

to the furtherance of the Related Mission Directive. The project has not

produced any positive intelligence nor has it becn intended that it should

do so. The project's sole purpose is to provide a mechanism for the

development of operational information in support of other Station

operations.

CHANGES

A. Simon D. CLACKETT

The unexpected resignation of CLACKETT in August 1960 has

necessitated the decision as how best to utilize the LIJERSEY surveillance

team and still benefit from the training and experience gained by the team

during the past year. As explained in the LITEMPO project outline, it was

decided that the LITEMPO Staff Agent would have the time, the need and the

requirements to handle and manage the LUERSEY cam on a regular basis;

consequently, the Station believed that such a solution to this problem would

permit the Station lo cunihue iù profit from CLACKETT's past efforts.

B. Oliver G. SCANTLING

Since CLACKETT's departure, SCANTLING has been handling the

LYERSEY team as an Interim measure pending Headquarters approval of

the LITEMPO project.

SCANTLING has been exposed to, and Ilkewise

knows, only one of the team members, LIEMPTY-20. SCANTLING Is

known to L-20 only by an alias.

EFFECTIVENESS

A.

General comments pertaining to the value of the projec efforts to the

Statlon's needs - The Station is of the opinion that its operarions are only

as good as the support mechanisins backstopping and contribuing to them.

The availability of unilateral support agents and organizations, such as

the LIMITY Projeci, to investigate leads and to collect operasional

Informatton is an indispensable ingredient to the Station's espionage and

counterespionage objectives. The Station would be seriously handicapped

in its operational activitles should the support services of suca agents as

GERENDE, SCANTLING and the agents under their control be suddenly

made unavailable.

B. LIMERICK Target - The basis for most of the Station's counter-

espionage acrivities directed against the LIMERICK targei require detailed

knowledge of the identity, activities and felloir associates of LiMERICK

personnel, The LIEMPTY photographic basehouses undouprecis provide

more of this type informarion than any other Station operation.

production from LIEMPTY photographic bases and from the LIENVOY

project provide the Station with the large majority of LIMERICK leads.

C. Targets of Opportunity - The immedlate avatlability of independent

assets to perform investigations, photographic assignments and other

essential types of support services in connection with Station targets of

opportunity represent an operational advantage which this Station considers

highly significant.

Icits due to such LIEMPTY assets that an agent can be

sent to distant areas in Mexico to do investigations, that photographs can

be made of Individuals and places which are of operattonal Interest and

apartments and hotel rooms can be acquired in fictitious nanies In

support of sensitive operations and activitles.

Although the progress and success of any support project depends

upon requirements from other Station operations, it must be concluded

that Project LIEMPTY has indeed been effective during the past project

IV. PROBLEMS

A. Security - The activities of the LICALLA base were suspended in

September 1960 as a direct result of the arrest of three KURIOT

technicians by the Cuban Government. One of the technicians was known

to have knowledge of the four LIMUST units (LICALLA is located in one

of these units) and the Station considered it appropriate to suspend photo-

graphic operations pending resolution of the situation, At this time,

there is no indication when LICALLA operations will be resumed.. The

LICALLA base operator has reported that there have been no unusual

inquiries or other suspictous actions which might Indicate that LICALLA

has been compromised to LIMERICK personnel; however, such a

posstbility will exist unti) the release of the three technicians. No

other security problems have occurred during the past year.

V.

PLANS

A. Processing of Photographs - During the past year considerable

progress has been made in the Station's handling, l.e., sorting, Indexing,

identifying leads and filing, of photographs produced by the several bases.

B. Photographic Techniques - The previous LIEMPTY Project Renewal

Request indicated that the Station planned to try new techniques using

HY-PAN film in night photography. HY-PAN film_was-used-on.a.trial

basts during daylight hours with poor results. Almost invariably, prints

from HY-PAN negarives were too grainy and, consequently, were of

little use in producing good identified shots of individuals.

of these experiments, night photography has not yet been attempted.

It should be noted that Eastman Kodak's new TRI-X PAN film, which

all bases and LIENTRAP now use, is superior to any film previously

used by the Station for clandestine photography. The quality of all

base phorographs have been Increased considerably as a direct result

of this new film.

C. General Comments - The Station believes that the GERENDE

segment is now operating under optimum organizational arrangments

and there are no plans for expansion contemplated at this time. It is

expected that SCANTLING will soon be relieved of his interim

responsibility for the LIJERSEY team and can concentrate more on his

investigative and casing activities. The transfer of the LIJERSEY team

to Projesi LITEMPO reduced Project LIEMPTY activities by an

appreciable amount. It is not planned, durig the coming year, to

expand present LIEMPTY activities.

COSTS

A. Past Project Year - Station finance records indicate that Project

LLEMPTY expended $19, 120. 91 during Fiscal Year 1960 (L December

1959 - 30 June 1960) and has thus far during Fiscal Year 1961 (through

31 October 1960) expended $16, 734.69. Contract Agents salaries and

allowances paid by Headquarters bring the total expenditures for l1

months of the projeci year to approximately $5U, 000. 00. An additional

$4, 000. 00 will be obligated during the I2th month of the project year.

This will bring total project expenditures to about $54, 000. 00 for the

entire project year.

B. Ensuing Period - Of the toral $53, 000. 00 budget, itemized below,

$31, 900. 00 should be erpended during the remainder of Fiscal Year

1961 and the balance, $21, 100. 00, should be expended during Fiscal

Year 1962. Normal accounting procedures will be used for all

expenditures.

the Station does nor anticipare that this project would or could continue

to function under is present objectives. However, both principal

agents, SCANTLING and GERENDE, would very possibly be worthwhile

sources of information to maintain contact with under any adverse

conditions. Both of these agents idently themselfs, in terms of

Ideology, motivarion and perspective, more as Americans than &s

was expected would be attended by many of the leading Mexican and

Central American Connunists. The polica were also covering the

meeting for the purpose of preventing a Commist-inspired demonatra-

REVIEW OF PROJECT LEMPTY

(For the Purpose of Project Renewal)

I.

PRODUCT OF THE PROJECT

A.

Oliver G. SCANTLING Segment (discussed in relation to project

objectives):

1.

"To collect operational information pertaining to LIMERICK

personnel and physical facilities." During the past year SCANTLING has devoted

a gignificant amount of time to the furtherance of this project objective. Although

other Station operations and personnel are also concerned with his collection of

operational information about LIMERICK personnel, SCANTLING's contributions

are unique as to type and complement information received from other sources. For

example, SCANTLING is used primarily as the source of information about LIMERICK

physical facilities. He is constantly on the alert for building modifications, con-

siruction activities and the kinds of outside services utilized by the LIMERICK

installation.

He regularly visits Inez PARADA de Moreno, the occupant of property

adjacent to LIMERICK, for the purpose of obtaining a close view of the interior

grounds of LIMERICK and to debrief Scora de Moreno about any unusual activities

which she may have observed. At the present time SCANTLING is preparing a

thorough casing report on the electrical power supply used by LIMERICK and all

other residences and establishments in the game block. This operational information

is intended for KURIOT's use and will show all transformers in the block, electrical

meters for measuring the amount of electrical power used and the precise points

where wires enter each property.

Because of his other sensitive activities and

because other operational activities provide adequate coverage, SCANTLING

has been used sparingly for physical surveillances and investigations which might

conceivably impair his future usefulness to the Station. During the time he spent

training Simon D. CLACKETT (ps) in radio controlled mobile surveillance,

SCANTLING did perform some surveillance work at the LIMERICK installation;

however, it was concerned mostly with briefing CLACKETT on dispatching tech-

niques and the procedures used for the control of several vehicles on a surveillance

team using two-way radios.

"To collest operational information pertaining to other targets of

opportunity, foreign official installations and personnel of intelligence interest

operating in Mexico." By far the most important contribution made by SCANTLING

in connection with this project objective has been his support to the LITACIT

operation and just recently actually gained entry to the LITACIT target using a

During this visit SCANTLING managed to collect highly

pluable operational information about the security of the installation, which has

added materially to KUBARK.'s knowledge about terrget. SCANTLING has also

cased and prepared reports on the LITABBY target in anticipation of mounting

SECRET,

a photographic surveillance and in initial preparation for a future LINIMENT type

activity. SCANTLING has performed investigations of numerous other Station

targets of opportunity which, depending on their significance, have been reported

in separate correspondence.

3.

"To exploit operational leads through recruitments, debriefings

ind surveillances. " This objective was included in the LIEMPTY project becaus

SCANTLING is used to follow up LIFEAT leads and leads obtained from the LIEMPT!

photographic bases. During the past year SCANTLING has investigated a quantity of

leads obtained from the above sources. The information resulting from these in-

vestigationa las anabled the Station in maintain current data on the various firms

used by the LIMBRICK target and in one instance, Octavio VIDALES (201-

).

caused the Station to make a recruitment pitch in an effort to carry out a technical

penetration of the LIMERICK target. Although VIDALES was not recruited, the

Station anticipates that SCANTLING will some day be successful in just this type of

activity. SCANTLING is the Station's principal source for the follow-up of LIFEAT/

LIMERICK and LIEMPTY photographic base house leads as they pertain to the

primary target.

4.

Not covered by a specific project objective but, névertheless, of

significant importance to the Station are SCANTLING's contributions to the overall

Station support efforts. In addition to the extensive training given to CLACKETT.

SCANTLING also prepared a detailed and sophisticated radio dispatch procedure for

use by the LIEMBRACE surveillance team. He devised a superior method for

numbering streets which enables the radio surveillance team to specify a location

without reference to street names and arcas. The entire radio dispatch code, when

used properly, practically defies identification as the conversations of a clandestine

surveillance team. From the standpoint of Station security, SCANTLING conducted

an investigation of LIVESTOCK-2 based on two leads which were 30 years old and

reported significant information which contributed to the Station's final decision

to terminate LIVESTOCK-2. SCANTLING's other support activities consist of renting

hote! rooms and apartments in fictitious names, supporting operationg such as

LICOOL-12 by performing sentry duty and by serving as a capable and responsible

cutout between the Station and agente from other geographical areas.

5. Although SCANTLING's LEMPTY objectives can never be completely

fulfilled, it is the Station's opinion that SCANTLING'has made important and valuable

contributions to LIEMPTY Project objectives specifically and to other Station

activities in general. SCANTLING's production, measured against monetary.

expenditures, case officer time and other intangible factors, unquestionably justifies

his continuation as an integral part of Project LIEMPTY.

"To collect operational information pertaining to LIMERICK

personnel and physical facilities through the use of photographic base houses."

This continuing objective is carried out by three photographic base houses.

LIMITED, LILYRIC and LICALLA. During the project year, LIMITED produced

approximately 3600 photographe and LILYRIC about 4500 pictures of individuale

entering. and leaving the LIMERICK target. Most of these photographs were of

nOn-LIMERICK individuale of which only a small, but significant, percentage

could be identified through license plate checks or other types of routine investi-

• gation.

The LICALLA base produced approximately $300 photographe during the year.

Most of the LICALLA photographs were of LIMERICK employees and thoir families

and have been of considerable value in maintaining current and accurate listings

ni LIMERICK personnel in Mcxico. Tho LICALLA bade has recently begun taking

motion pictures of LIMERICK personnel conversing in the garden area.

Thege

movies are being forwarded to KUTUBE/D for the possible exploitation of lip

• reading analysis. ' The LIMITED base, in addition to its photographic assignment,

is also used as the radio central for dispatching the LEMBRACE surveillance

team on LIMERICK personnel targets. All bases make routine reports on the daily

attendance of LIMERICK employees at the installation which facilitates the Station's

reporting on the arrival and departure of LIMERICK personnel, Also, the bases

devote time to reporting the personal associations among the numerous LIMERICK

employees. Some of this latter type information is valuable from the standpoint of

confirming that LIMERICK intelligence officers have a tendency to associats with

their colleagues.

"To collect operational information and identify operational

leade pertaining to Station targets of opportunity." This in a broad objective

and one which is contributed to by the LIENTRAP operation.

LIENTRAP iB used

to provide photographic coverage of important Station targets which do not justify

a more permanent photographic bage. During the period under review, LIENTRAP

has been used for the timely coverage of various Central American exile group

activitica, the Confederacion de Trabajadores de la America Latina (CTAL)

-headquarters, several counterespionage targets, the LITACIT and LITABBY

targets and other one-time operations of intelligence interest. The operational

information produced by LIENTRAP is used by the Station for increasing

operational knowledge about a target and, when appropriate, has been incorporated

in separate reports to Headquarters with other information about specific targets.

"To provide operational aupport to Station operations, i. e., rent

hotel rooms and apartments, and conduct counter-surveillances." GERENDE,

because of his area knowledge and operational acumen, is used frequently by the

Station for renting hotel rooms and apartments in fictifioug names for use on other

He is also the Station's principal procurer of local Post Office

boxes for use as letter drops. This objective pertains entirely to the operational

support of other Station operations and is an invaluable ingredient to the security

of important Station activities.

The production of operational information as represented by

LINITED, LILYRIG, LICALLA and LIENTRAP in an important adjunct to the

Station's coverage as the LIMERICK target and Station targets of opportunity.

¿ is the Station's conclusion thas the expenditure of KUBARk assets, j.e., mone

and case officer time, is justified and that these activities should be continued

C. Simon D. CLICKETT Segment (discussod in relation to project objectives):

1.

"To callect operational information and tu identify operational

loads pertaining to the LIMERICK target and Station targets of opportunity. " Very

little production has been realized from this objective in serins of CLACKETT's

contributions. CLACKETT returned to Mexico in early April 1959 after receiving

surraillance, tradecraft and photugraphy training in Headquarters. He then spent the

sest os April, May and part of June being trained by SCANTLING in mobule sur-

veillance techniques. Then LIEMPTYa 15, ló, 17 and 20 were placed under his

supervision and he began training these agents in the arts al foot surveillance and

mobile surveillance.

This team, known as the LIJERSEY team, is just beginning to

show the excellent eitects of CLACKETT's intensive training sessione. Although

LIENIPTY-17 has resigned and the team consists of only four agents, including

CLACKETT, the Station believes that the tean will be ready within the next month

to begin its contributions to the above objective.

2. Based on the training time deroted to CLACKETT and to the LIJERSEY

teaii and the anticipated production during the coming project year, it is the Station's

opinion that this activity should be continued.

II.

EXTENT TO WHICH THE RELATED MISSION DIRECTIVE HAS BEEN

FURTHERED.

Project LIEMPTY has provided support, in varying ways, to a majority of

Station operations and in this manner has been a contributing factor to the furtherance

at the Related Mission Directive. The project is not intended ror designed to

produce positive intelligence; its sole purpose is to provide a mechaniam for the

development of operational information in support of other Station operations.

ш.

PROGRESS OF THE OPERATION AND PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE.

A. Oliver G. SCANTLING Segment:

1. SCANTLING's duties and responsibilities are basically the same

now as they were when the original LiEMPTY project outline was submitted. Since

SCANTLING is the only major factor in this part of LlEMPTY, progress, other than

covered in the above

section on production, can be measured valy by the fact that

SCANTLING is a year older and has acquired a jew more beipiúl tricki of the trade

SECRETI

=5 .

and, consequently, has increased his own operational abilities.

• 2.

Insofar as future planning is concerned, SCANTLING will

continue to devote the greater portion of his time to the LITACIT operation. In

addition, he will continue his work against the LIMERICK target, i.e., investi-

gating LIFEAT and photographic base house leads in connection with the objectives

of the LIEMPTY and LIMESA projects.

The Station still plans to maintain

SCANTLING as an independent Station asset free from the responsibilities of super-

vising other agente and operations.

3.

SCANTLING will probably continue providing administrative

support to LIEMPTY- 3 (now covered under the LICOOL project), but will not be

responsible for the operational direction af L-3.

в.

Raymond H. GERENDE Segment:

1.

During the past year the three photographic base houses have

been trained in the use of a faster type film (HY-PAN) to facilitate the taking of

photographs on dark cloudy days. One base, LICALLA, has made tests and recently

begun making 35mm color slides using the new fast type Ektachrome film. This

film is now processed in the Mexico Station dark room which heretofore was not

possible. It is the Station's opinion that a few color photographs of target personnel

will be useful for identification purposes. The LICALLA Base has also, during the

past year, begun taking 16mm motion pictures in color with the expectation that

Headguarters can eventually provide lip reading analysis of conversations taking

place in the garden area of the LIMERICK installation.

2.

Other operational progress has been made in connection with

relieving GERENDE of responsibility for the LIJERSEY surveillance team. This

now leaves GERENDE with a sufficient amount of time to supervise all photographic

base houses, LIENTRAP and the outside photographic laboratory.

3.

Future planning in relation to this segment does not call for

expansion. Rather, the Station plans to perfect some of the photographic procedures

now in use and to experiment with night photography possibilities using the fasi

IY-PAN film with telephoto lens of varying lengths.

GERENDE will also concentrate

on increasing the security and communications procedures used with each base.

C.

Simon D. CLACKETT Segment:

1.

CLACKETT's assumption of responsibility for the LIJERSEY

• surveillance team has been a progressive step for the development of an additional •

and much needed support ascet. Although the LIJERSEY team has been in existence

fur several years, it was only during the past year, with the assignment of

SECRET/S

- CLACKETT, that an intensive effort was made to train the team members and to

i place them under the supervision of a full time team leader. As mentioned above.

CLACKETT has done an excellent job during the past few months in getting the

team ready for future operational assignmenta.

2.

The Station plans, during the coming year, to increase the

strongth of the LIJERSEY team by at lcast two agents and one car. This would

then give a total LIJERSEY comploment of six agents and three radio cars. The

Station will continue to take all necessary precautiong not to rush the development

of the team nor to give it assignments which are too complicated and too difficult.

It is anticipated that the team will begin some surveillance work within the next

month on targets connected with plans for an expanded Communist Party pene-

tration prograni.

Iv.

PERFORMANCE OF PRINCIPAL AGENTS IN TERMS OF PRODUCTION,

SECURITY AND COVER.

• 8/16a%

Oliver G. SCANTLING - As should be expected from a well trained

and motivated agent,

SCANTLING's production during the period under review was

excellent.

His production is in the category of operational information rather than

positive intelligence and is based on leads and investigations given him by the

Station. He never fails to do a thorough and detailed job on all assignments

given to him.

He is an unusually valuable, principal agent. There have been no

security problems or developments during the past year in connection with

SCANTLING's assignments. Likewise, his cover is very good and places him

in a position to maintain his work for KUBARK for many years to come.

Raymond H. GERENDE - Since GERENDE's marriage in December

1958, his performance has improved to a marked degree. He has become one

of the Station's most dependable agents in terms of promptness for meetings,

completing operational assignments as rapidly as possible and in doing any task,

regardless of how menial it may be. Insofar as the Station and GERENDE know,

his cover with LISTERINE's firm has held up very well. In fact, GERENDE

recently was able to negotiate a sales contract with a customer having a very

large sales capacity for the product manufactured by LISTERINE's firm. This,

of course, endears GERENDE to LISTERINE in addition to contributing to

GERENDE's cover employment. The only significant security incident pertaining,

in part, to GERENDE was in connection with LIENTRAP (please see HMMA- 13951,

ló October 1959, for details).

Simon D. CLACKETT - CLACKETT's performance has definitely

measured up to the standards expected by the Station. He has proved that he

is conscientious, dependable and very quick in grasping the details of clandestine

activities. He will undoubtedly continue to improve his personal performance as

• 7.

he gains more experience. There have been no security problems or incidents in

connection with CLACKETT's assigament to this Station. Although the notional

cover provided by Headguarters has held up very well during the past few months,

the Station had hopes of placing him in LILABEL's firm and obtaining Inmigrante

papers for him. However, for reasons mentioned in other correspondence, this

cover arrangement did not work out. The Station is continuing efforts to locate

another suitable local cover job for CLACKETT.

CONTACT, AND COMMUNICATION.

Oliver G. SCANTLING - The Station Case Officer meets with SCANTLING

on the average of three times each week. For regular meetings, a toral of eight

prearranged contact points are used alternately with SCANTLING "walking the beat"

and being picked up by the Case Officer in the latter'e car. This procedure enables

both the agent and the case officer to check themselves and to check each other for

possible surveillance.

Meetings are generally of short duration, seldom more than

30 minutes, and are held in the car. It is possible for SCANTLING to get in touch

with his case officer by telephone, and vice versa, in case an unscheduled meeting

is necesa. SCANTLING and the Station arè currently working on the detaila of

an emcrgency means of contact utilizing SCANTLING's wife's relatives in PBPRIME.

Headquarters will be advised of these arrangements to facilitate contact with

SCANTLING in the event Mexico is overrun by hostile forces and contact with the

Station is severed.

B.

Raymond H. GERENDE - GERENDE's Case Officer meets with him five

times each weck. Meetings are conducted in the Casc Officer's car using the same

• procedures as outlined above. GERENDE and his Case Officer have a total of 11

contact points in different areas of the city and generally hold their meetings during

the early morning hours, usually about 0800. As in the case of SCANTLING,

GERENDE and his Case Officer are preparing an emergency contact procedure which

vill facilitate Headquarters communications with him through his relatives in PBPRIM

Headquarters will be advised of these arrangements just as soon as they are completec

C. Simon D. CLACKETT - The Station Case Officer meets with CLACKETT

requested approval to include sinon D. CLACK!T: (Ds) and Ailma J. FTORIALISI

sou the LIMitil Project.

The funds designated in the original tO for

the undesignated staff Agent were usod to cover the expenses for CLACKETI

project til tila saenanent.

rocommendations were nade.

KUDiaK suggested that the Case Officer should

sork at devising ostensihle sources of incomes for the agents which will

stand the scrutiny of iriends, relatives and lass friendl; forces.

Lo An arenarent to ClCKSTi's contract has been requested to allow

for a cuartars allowance.

Ine eduentional allowance requested in paragrash

1l of the project amendment was disaproved because CLiCKETT was a Contract

Agent.

The Quarters Allowance of $2,520 was turned dow because 1t was too

higio in relation to CLACKETT' a salary. Tlerefore, a quartera allossuce of

$1,800 has beer. annroved and will be written into ClicKSTi's contract. Il,

haver, operational and cover reasons require CLACKET to rent an apartment

LILYRIC = This Base bas been la operation for about to and one-hall jeara

and 18 located 1a an apartment bullüing acros a the street from the LIMiRICK

Installation. As In the case of the LIlHID Base, INTYRIC takes photographe of

persons entering and learing the main sate of the UNIRICK installation.

Tue:

INLYRIC photographs are bandled.in the some manner as the LIMITED pietures. In

addition to tatias photograps;

the LiLYRIC operators also prepare dally logs on the?.

setlytties of each-INRick employod, record the licease plate numbers of most cars:

carrysas people to and fron the LINKICK installation; and prepare an observation

cary on all target personnel: seen sach day. (Tils peraits the Station to tell when

a target personality is out of town or not vorking for soue other reason.)

The LYRIC Base vas orlelnally acquired and made operative to provide for

continuous coverage of the terget in the event LINTISD is ever coupronised.

This

1s satll the primary ralue of having two bases cover the some portion of the target.

LILYRIC 1B compartmented fron LTNITID and with the possible exception of CHRENDE

could probably reather any security flap ivolving LINITiD. Obviously, there 18

Bose duplication in the vork of LINTTED and ILYRIC; borever, the insurance value

of having two basds 1s quite appareat.::

ITTYRIC bas been operating for about two and one half years and insofar as

the Station knows, no coupromising socurity situations have arisen.

LICALIA - The ICALIA Base 18 located 1n a position where photographs can be

taken of people within the LIMKRICK garden area.

In addition, the operator of the

LICALLA Base submits meekly reports n IMERICK construction vork, dally logs show-

Ing when a target indiridual was seen that day, and reports showing the association

of target individuals with one another.

LiCAlLA photographs are processed and handled

In the same manner and by the peopla who handle the LIMITSD and LILYRIC pictures.

The LICALIA Base vas acquired and operations began about tro and one-half

yearo ago vita the primary purpose of obtaining additional operational Information

concerning LIMERICK personnel, and operational leads which could be exploited for

the physical penetration of the LINRICK installation.

Approximataly one year ago

the LICAIIA, Base usa purchased by KBARK through LIMOUSINS. LICALIA VIll probably

remain st 1ts present location and vill continue to subult photographa and reports

of the sane type as are now being subaltted. Other than the fact that ITEMPTY-9,

the LICALIA operator, is the brother of former LIPSNICK-47, no security problems are

currently krona to the case officer.

However, reports fron LIPSlICK? 12 and 30, the

local palice, the attorneys Invalved in the case, the foreign embassy concerned and

the INFLUTTiR tests gire no Indications that LIEMPTY-9 vas ever mentioned during

the LIPSTICK flap.

It has been used during the past

The malor security threat to MiiiiAl la the lact that 1t has been operating

for about two yeard'in all parts of the olty and should soon be replaced by a truck

make.

Provision for this 18 made in Soction 15 of this Feld Project

Outzino.

LIJERSEY - This 18 presently an approved project; bovever, It 18 belleved

advisable for acministrative efficiency to include the LIJERSEY assota vithin the

Iramerork of the LIMPIX Project. Other than LILYRIC, which has already been

discussed, LIJIRSbY consists of a foot survelllance tean with thres members, INTEMPTIB-

15, 16 and 17. LIMPlYs 15 and l6 have been employed for about one and a hair yours

and LTEMPTY-17 Isir about one yeac..

They heve not developed lato as competeut a surve11-

lance tean as the LPStICK ten vas and probably nover vill becone as good.

The

LIJERSEY team has been uses nosily for stationary surveillances and

observations of

peopla of interest.

LIEMPTY-17, however, has also been usod so, a pretext investigator.

He has excalled at this type of work and the station continues to use him in this

capacity.

The. Station has been reluctant to use the LIJERSEY team as much as 1t

could have been used because of the clösë association of the tean with GRaNDs and,

in turn, GERiNDe's knowledge and work on LIFPAT and the LIPSlICK surveillance team.

The Station plans to recruit several agente of a type and social level more sultable

for all types of surveillance vork than the present INdERSiY tear.

O11ver B. SCANTLING - SCANTLING has been associated with KUBARK for several

years in a number of different capacities.

He vas orleinally used as a member of

the LIPSTICK survelllance tean and later was head of the same teem. He has been

used to train now agenta in the techniques of surveillance and investigation, to

acquire office space and apartments for the station's operations and to conduct

Investigations and make recrultment approaches to individuals of operational Interest

to KUBARK. SCANTLING is currently being used by the station as an investigator of

LIMESA leads andis atill actively pursuing the LTMESA/MKLIGETING operation.

S'ANILING also maintains regular contact with LIMPTY-3 and nonitors his elicitatica

effort against the LICOOI-6 target. In this connection, both SCANTLING and LTEMPIY-3
