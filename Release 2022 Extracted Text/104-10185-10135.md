Issuance of diplomatic passports In allas is an automatic

process whonevor an

IS

staff employee travels on assignment

abroad.

The employee involved provides the following items,

which he selects personally, to one "Frlix Rafael," in the

DGI, who forwards the material to the Foreign Ministry:

a.

b.

Diplomatic title;

One/photograph.

4. The diplomatic title chosen by the staff employee is double-!

checkgd by the Foreign Ministry to avoid conflicts or dis-

Freguently. IS personnel ustig diplomatic passports travel it

For instance,

Source traveled to Mexico in

early 1964 with a group öf six or seven staff employees, all

using diplomatic passports.

There ago no distinguishing features, either in the passport

serial numbor, the diplomatic title, or any other entry in a

diplomatic passport issued in alias to distinguish it from a

bona-fide document.

Cuban Ordinary Passports

Cuban ordinary passports are issued in allas to IS agents, 1n-

Cy ding Cubans and nationals of other Latin American countries,

Cuban Foreign Ministry in much the same way as in the

case of diplomatic passports.

In addition to the bearer's

photograph, an agent provides cover information on himselt

for use in the passport which conforms as closely as possible

to his real life.

As an example, Source cited his own case,

sayidg. that he furnished a cover story containing his true

dato of birth, but listing him as single, even though he is

was nosed that fron june

to Deceaber 1962 they ascended to

six-digit numbers.

9.

Source's ordinary

passport issued in alias was allegedly ob-

tained

in January

196t, but was given

an issuance date of 28

August 1963 and bears a

serial nitber consistent with the

accession pattern for the latter issuance date.

five other Cubar ordinary passports issued in 1963 in alias

for use by agents under Source's supervision bear serial

numbers adhering to the accession pattern corresponding to:

their particular dates of issue.

10.

Gronets recently ceased to be used on photographs in Cuban

ordinary passports.

Bona-fide Visas. Vaccinatior Certificates, and Passages

11.

Diplonatic visas for use in Cubaa diplomatic passports in alias

are applied for directly by the Cuban Foreign Ministry to the

foreign sission concerned in Havana.

In Source's case appii-

cation ras first made in larch 1961 for a Chilean visa and

later for a, Mexican visa, even though no travel to Chile was

contemplated.

The reason for this was awareness by Cuban

authorities of lexican suspicion of Cuban diplomatic personnel.

The Cuban authorities believed the lexican Embassy in Havana

be less suspicious of a passport containing a visa from

another Latin

American country.

13.

Passage bookings and international vaccination certificates

for use by

and agents using Cuban alias pass-

ports are also obtained, through the Cuban Foreign Ministry.

Vaccination

certificates are obtained from the Instituto

always booked on Cubana Airlines because such

No passages are booked on

Soviet or Czech airlines because

these require payment in

U.s. dollars, which are scarce for the Cuban Government.

an exit permit from the Cuban Foreign Ministry, known

"Visto Bueno," is required for each subsequent departure

The

Foreign Ministry issues these to personnel

fide docunents.

Corrunist Parties

Forgery and Falsification Capabilities

16.

The IS has no capabilitirs for making false passports or iu-

ternal incuments from any country because of the difficulty

of matching the paper and the

sechnical problems involved in

the engraving and printing process.

It also lacis capability

for erauicating entries in passports because of the problem

involved in attempting to delete entries without defacing the

documents.

17.. Filsification and forgery is limited to filling in valid blank

foreign passports, making photograph and page substitutions in

sona-fide foreign passports, and placing false travel entries

in foreign passports.

Travel entries from western Europe and

Latin America can be forged.

Source did not know whether the

IS itself made the photograph and page substitutions and for-

All documents requiring forgeries and substitutions

were turned over to one "Alfonso," in the IS, who took them to

a site unknown to Source. Source theorized that the forgeries

substitutions may have been done by the Departamento de

counterintelligence arm of the Cuban Government, which he

Travel Pattern of IS Agents

18.

countries and brought to Cuba for training in methods of sabo-

and other subversive activitics are provided with detached

For the second leg of the jourrey, carrying the agent from

Prague via

western Erruge back to his native land, he is pro-

vided in Havana, before departure,

with a passport from another

Latin American

countrs. The non-Cuban paesport may be the

agent's bona-fide docinent which has been returned to him or

it may be another valic Latin American passport pressed into

service for the purpose.

If the agent's own passport bears

no evidence of travel into Cuba it will be used for this pur-

pose, being

"brought i? to date" with forged western European

entries to explain the jap between the time when he left for

Cuba and when he arrired in Prague, but showing his mode of

travel to be such that he never passed through either Cuba or

Czechoslovakia.

Should the agent's bona-fide passport bear

the Mexican cachet storing that he proceeded to Cuba, the IS

replaces the page bearing such entry with a blank page from a

...valid passport of the same country if feasible.

from the same country is available or because substitution

23.

.

Providing documentatios for agent trainees is the responsibility

of the IS country desk officer handling trainees

from the par-

ticular country.

The country desk officers receive and main-

tain custody of passports coming from the Conmunist Parties in

their areas of jurisdiction. Although the agent's training in

Cuba may take several weeks, or even a few nonths, it often

takes a year or more for the country desk officer
