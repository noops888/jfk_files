the mid-60's I served in Europe working primarily on Soviet

mid-60's, early 157 to mid-60's, Did you mean 1960?

Mr. Hadgman. Mid-1969, yes, T would correct that, From
July 6 on until -- I can't remember whether {t was June oF
July of 1963 i served as Chief of Station in then Laopoldvillie,
now Xiershasa, Zaire. I was Chisf of Station. I then returned
to Washington in the early fall, the exact dates I don’t recall,
of 1963, and I was what is known as a Branch chief. I was
responsible for tha eastern half of Africa From 1963 to June

of 1965.

I returned to Washington whera I became Branch chief

again for the Southeast Asian area for a vary prief tima, In

Mr. Wides, And bacausa of conflict between among, I

Potential conflict, among the central government under
Prealdent Kasavubu and othars as one faction, Patrice Lumumba
and his followers as a second faction, and Mr. Tshombe and
his follwars as a third

Mr. Hledgman. And Gizenga as a fourth.

Mr. Widas. Gizanga, I take it he was somewhat within
Lumumbs's camp?

Mr. Hedgman. Yus. I'm sorry. I should not have
interrupted,

Mr Wides. In any avent, there was the Potential of
imminent fratricidal war?

Mr. Hedgman. Tshombe had already declared the Katanga

to be an independent state of Katanga on the lith of July, if

| memory serves ma.

Mr. Wides. Is it also correct that Mr. Lumumba was the
“Person of those threw leaders, of those thrae factions, whose
potential activities concerned the United States the moat at
that point, particulerly with regard to the possibility of
Communist influence in the Congo?

best be placing that time that you could give us?

Mr. Wedgman. I believe it would have been around the

beginning of September, but 1 cannot pin it down more than

ur. Wides. Yes.

Mr, Wides. Let's go back on the record. |
Let my phrase the question this way, Mr. Hedgman: when!

Mr. O'Donnell arrived, I take it as a somewhat junior Station

Chief, and in your first joh as a Station Chief, that you

considered whether there was dissatisfaction with your handing j

poe the job, or the nead for more experianced personnel there,

is that correct?
Mr. Hedgman. T think that ts possibly crue.

Mr. Wides. Now, de you recall whether ona of the

K thoughta that want through your mind was that parhaps the

or the lack of action on your part in smplanent ina for
instructions? Was that ona of the thoughts that went through
your mind as ..far as you can racall?

Mr. Hedgman. T cannot say that with certainty now. Tt
is very possible,

Hr. Wides. Do you have any recollection that that went
through your mind even if you can't be certain?

Mr. iedgman. To repeat, that ha ~~

Mr. Wides. That you thought ~~

Mr. Hedgman. That I thought thet they were dissatisfied
with my handling of that?

Mr. Wides. Because you had not yet eliminated Lumumba
or taken further steps to do so?

Mr. Hedgman. I just can't, 1 just would Like to back off
that one because I cannot be certain. I knew that obviously
they had sent a man who had much more experiance than ft, and

yet it was clear that he was working - for me, because { was

, not relievad as Chief of Station. They would never have sent

him there under me and then switched the positions.

ws Me, Wides, Prior to his coming -- to return now to the

period when you sent the confirmation, request for confirmation

do you recall slugging it back through 4 particular channel?
Mr. HNedgman. There was some apecial channel, and t--

beacause it was handlad differently than any other normal

massage. For exampla, it was not put on a reguler cable form,

which, you know, you have Several copies for your various

the message to the communicator to encrypt, and that was wordad

prone tarts 7071 944-9000

im a double-talk way that even the communicator would not
necessarily know what it was about.

Mr, Wides. If your communication to the Headquarters and
| their communication back ware in somewhat ambiquous terms,
particularly your question, such as is the Person, ie this
person the Messenger, and are hie instructions accurate, énd
Af the reply was essentially yes to both questions, how would
that have asgured you that his invocation of Presidential

(of the Director was accurate without your indicating in your

When you were discussing with lpr. Gottlieb during his stay
