which occurrad nearly fiftaen years ago, some flitsen years,

some slightly more, some slightly lass.

So therafore, I will

have not had an opportunity to rafresh my memory by reading old

filos of anything of the sort.

Mr. Baron. That is completely understandable.

Mr. lodgman. I Just want thia -I am making this point

for the Committos members. I have already made it to you

yesterday.

Mr. Baron. And it la understandablo that we are asking

you to diacuss events that took place almost fifteen years ayo,

but it is your intention to give us the truth as far as you can

Iecall It?

Mr. Hedgman. It 1s my full Intention to give the truth.

Mr. Baron.

Thank you.

Mr. Wides. Mr. Hedgman, would you ploase brlefly give

us a doscription of your careur with the Agency, and that can

be by basically divialons or type of job in a vary brief

summary.

Mr. Hedgman. I began, was recruited to serve, as what

ls roforred to as a non-official cover agent, and I was a

contract as opposed to a ataff officar. That was changed

shortly aftarwards. I think a faw months later I was mada &

as Premier and the U.S. had already bacome Berlously concerned

about the beginning of soviet assistance or involvement in the

Congo and the possibility of sovlet Influence in the Congo?

Instructions. I did not know what type, sort of instructions.

Mr. Mason. Can you state in your own words just exactly

what the gist of that cablo was?

Mr. Hedgman. I am

time now on recollection, and it 1a not a sure thing, but my

recollection was that the cable advised me that a parson whom

I would know to bo or recoqnize as an officar of the Agancy,

and I am not sure that lt said as an officer of the Agency,

someone who I would have rocognized would arrive with instruc-

tions for me.

Mr. Wides. Did the cable rofer in any way to Lumumba

that you can recall, that would involve the Lumunba problem or -

Mr. Wides. It would not have been markad --

Mr. lodgman. . and contained Instructions that I was not!

Mr. Baron. And that you ware to destroy the messago?

Mr. lledgman.

I am assuming that lt probably did, but i

until after I mat the gentlaman concerned.

MI. Dawson.

Maybe we could approach that a differant way.

You do recall whatever

message you received was not in the normal

course of communications with the Agency?

Mr. ledgman. Well, 1t came through Agancy communications

MI. Dawson. That's not unusual, necessarily?

MI. Hedgman. At that time it was more unusual than it is

today, I would say.

you discussed other means of arranging his death, or you may

There obviously was the possibility that his Congolese political

Mr. Hadgman. I couldn't spoculate as to whother he thought

I would or not.

Mr. Hidas. But would that have been a falt impression

for him to take away from your comments?

Mr. lledgman. I think it would bo a falr impression that

he would take away the thought that I was goinn to look into

it and try and figure if thare was a way, but I do remember --

I shouldn't say rememher -- I bellave I strested the dieticulty

of trying to carry out such an operation:

Mr. Wides. But since he had given you inatructions that

the President wanted this, would it have been fair for him to

carry away from your convargation

the understanding that if

you thought it could be done, if you found a way, that it would

then go forward, you would then go forward?

Mr. ladyman. Yes.

the Presidont of the Unitad Statas had instructed the Agency

of other roguirements which ware laviad on me which we are not

I think thare was one major thing probably which took some of

7

I'e was able to sand messages out, but the - there had

been a coup d'otat, at least. there was a coup d'ata on tha

night of the 14th of September, 1960. A government which was,

10

of discussion as to its legality at cho time, but that was

Mr. Wides. Doas' the crypt JMOGRE mean anything to you?

Mr. Hedgman. No, sir.

Mr. Wides.

Do you recall a time when 'Mr. O'Donnell had

an agent come into the congo to assist him in his efforts?

MI. llodgman. I had not rememberad that until yesterday

when you raised it.

Mr. Widos. Do you now have a racollaction, refreshed, o!

his having someono come in?

Mr. llodgman. A vague

recollaction, very vaque.

MI, Hides. Do you recall whare the parson came from, or

whether hu was a CIA officer, or juse a contract agent?

Mr. ledgman.

From the

name you used for him yesterday,

I would know that he would be an agent as opposed to an

intelligence officer.

Mr. Wides.

But you have no indepandent recollection of

who he was or where he was from or his background?

MI. Hedgman.

No.

I had forgotten that entirely.

!

Mr. Wides. Do you recall a time when you learned that

Patrico Lumumba had escaped from his house detention or arrest

1n the Presidontial Palace?

Mr. Hudgman.

Yes. It was not the Palace, the Prima

Miniater's rosidence.

MI. Wides. The Prime Minister's residence.

And do you rocall whether you had any foreknowledge that.

that was imminant, or a likely possibility?

Mr. Wides. Do you know of any assistance or involvement

of ME. O'Donnell'or his agent of anyone alas connected with the

Station in Mr. Lumumba's escape from the detention?

Mr. lodgman. I am juite cartain that there was no Agency

involvament in any way, bocause I think I would -- I am convincedi

I would have known it as Chlaf of station.

O'Donnell could not have taken such action under normal

Agency procedures without consulting me.

Mr. Wides. Now, is it correct that when he ascaped, Mr.

Lumumba tried to Journey

to the Stanleyville ragion where his

following was the strongest, and that along the way, en route,

he was apprehended by the Contral Congolese government authori-

tles and brought back under arrest, first to Leopoldville,

is that correct?

Mr, lladgman. That's correct.

Mr. Widas. And this happened some time in the perlod of

¡ Guidance, as I sald, 1 sacall being with. I believe, Congolore

officars to the offoct that they were trying to flaure out how

to head him off, a discussion about there are only a certain

numbar of lorries and river crossings where

the roads - you

know, thare ware a limitad number of roade, and he had to go

through deup rain forests and major rivers were crossed.

I may have commented. I don't know for

MI. Wides.

But you would not charactarize your activities

as providing any assistance to the Congolose to locate him, or

would you?

MI. lodgman.

I honestly, I don't think it -- if it was

any assistance, certainly

not a major assistance.

Mi. Wides. Do you recall any communication wich the

Agancy while Mr. Lumumba was at large prior to your trip to

Rome, which I will get to in a moment, ahout his escape or, l'in

sorry, about your provision of any assistance or cooperating

Mr. lladgman. I will try to do my best.

Mr. Baron. That is, first of all, whon you discused

your conversation with the then DCl, Schlesingor, you said that

you indicatod to him verbally that you had bean asked to

participate

in an assagaination of Patrico Lumumba. Did he

respond when you made that indication

to him?

Mr. lledgman.

May I go back? I think i mada it to him.

It is concalvable that. I could have made it to Bill Colby as

his Executive Director, or that tho

two could have been present

together. It is ridiculous, but i cast pin thie one down in

detail.

Mr. Baron. Did you recolve a responga from Schlesinger?

You mentioned yesterday that he was able to ba quito sphinxlike

whan he wanted to, and you thought that this miht have been

one of those situations.

I had the impression he took lt all on board

and did not necessarily wish to advise me of what action he

copies of those are rotained, of all muspages are normally

You try and keep as small a number as

possible on hand so as to permit you to continue working so that;
