Dear Jim,

Maurice DEJEAN . |

It has recently come to our notice that DEJEAN's
secretary when hss. in Moscow was a certain Christine
KO.

DAVIRON, who in 1863 in Moscow married an American journalist
described as BudVKORENGOLD currently Newsweek correspondent
in London. —_—_!

2. KORENGOLD appears to be identical with R.J. KORENGOLD
who was in Moscow for Newsweek from 1959 probably until
1967 or 1968. We have not traced hin and the
only other trace we have of him is an article fhe wrote
giving his impressions of being a correspondent in Moscow.
This was produced in "SURVEY", considered by our Soviet
experts to be a reliable publication in an anti-Communist
context.

3. The KORENGOLDs are inonf’to a member of the FCO who was
in Moscow with them. This official says he has never
noticed that she was biaised either for or against the Soviet
system. He describes her as coming from a rather strait—
laced military family. She is aged about 30, intelligent
and attractive.

4. We have not told the French about this but would be
quite happy for you to discuss it with them.
