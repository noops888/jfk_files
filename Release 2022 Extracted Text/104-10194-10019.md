to the development of human relations. His forte is therefore

more in the field of spotting and making operational contacts

than in that of more than

_s.iort-range operational developnent.

Subject's operational situation makes it impossible for him to

attempt recruitments.

Thus, his very real achievements are not

by essence of the spectacular variety.

Subject's reporting has been satisfactory and continue to

be copious.

He could, however, further improve the selectivity

leads provided the Station and make more of an effort to

"digest" the information contained in his reports.

Although Subject has, at present, no supervisory function.

he häs repeatedly requested such a responsibility.

He is careful

with operational expanses and has exercised good security.

During the period under

review; additional efforts have been

made to make full use of Subject's potential and integrate him

further in the work of the station component with which he works.

He is a particularly valuable asset for the Station programs

directed against the local MHHARSH and TPFAST targets.

Section D (continued)

substantial.

In a word, is it worth it? We do not yet know,

although our initial impressions are favorable.

On the fitness report itself, this rater would have preferred

an "s" rating for specific duty number one; Subject may ultimately

deserve an

"O", but it does not seem warranted at the present time.

Moreover, I believe the overall rating would more properly have

been ir the higher range of the "p" category, rather than

"S",

but it is of course a subjective judgnent of the rating officer.

frequent basis.

In sum,

is superb, and only time will reveal to

what extent the

requirements permit a full measure on be-

nalf of the Organization.

We are following this aspect closely

and will be conmenting upon it subsequently, as we gain experience

and knowledge.

COMMENYS OF HEVIEVING OFFICIAL

As previous Station correspondence and fitness reports will reflect, this

officer has been the subject of varying evaluations and projections in recent years.

In fairness to him, however, i, is equally true that an officer

reflects, in the level and quality of his performance, the amount and type

of guidance, direction and push he receives from the responsible inside case

Making allowances for these variables, this officer's past record has not

been impressive; however, it is also correct to note that he has improved sub-

stantially during the latter part of the period under review, and that is the Station

can work out some fiscal arrangement which will reduce the heavy financial input

Section D3 continued

from the Organization, his continued presence at this Station definitely

appears to be warranted for a sufficient period to reach more definite

conclusions concerning the level of sustained performance over a somewhat

longer period than that reflected by this report.

On balance, we are pleased that this officer has responded so well to

greater case officer direction and that he has undertaken somewhat more

aggressive. efforts to expand his range of contacts in immediate proximity

to the primary Station targets.

This officer does bring many talents to bear

on his operational activity: he has absolutely fluent

a solid and

and a vast range of contacts in the local community.

Nonetheless, it will require additional time to explore these contacts in

depth, select those which appear to be operationally viable, and pursue

lein actively either to the point of recruitment by another officer or elimina-

tion from further development, for whatever reason.

In sum,

in spite of the recognized ind commendable improvement in this

officer's performance during the period under review, the reviewer submits

that the letter grade for specific duties 2 and 4 would morc properly have

been a "P", and that the ovcrall rating, at this point, would more accurately

be set at a level between "p" and "S", probably closer to the former than

the latter.

Thie reviewing comment has been read by the officers who prepared

the Fitness Report.

DIKECTIONS:

Streas strengths and wonknesses, particularly those which affect development on present job.

Subject has excellent natural equipment for employment in this organization in

terms of his intelligence and natural apptitudes.

Additionally, he brings a

great deal of area knowledge and language ability to his present assigment.

turing the perlod covered by this report he has displayed great industry and

devotion to duty in a varlety of circumstances and achieved notable results

in production and in the creation of both short and long-term assets for his

unit. On the debit side I would say that he is sonewhat too businesslike in

many personal situations to the point of being almost humourless.

This, however,

is a quality which he does not permit to intrude upon the nocessities of his

operational work although it often shows in office relationships.

Jacques G. RICHARDSON

REFERENCE

• Your senorandum dated 8 October 1958

1. The SR Divisio: and the Chief of Station,

attached) reconnead tho pronotion of Jacques G. Richardson to GS-15.

2.

Mr. Richardson was last promoted 16 January 1955.

February 1955 he arrived in

to sarre as the

senior SR officer

In the FE field area, his present assignment.

In this position he

sas contime to display qualities of lesdership, initlativo,

imagination and thoroughness which resulted in his rapid rise in

the agency.

3. The very facts of lir. Richardson's jouth in relation to

his responsibilities and tho tact that prunition to his present

levol has been rapid, caused the Division and the Chief of Station,

to hold until this time a recommendation for his promotion

which was subnitted in June 1957.

Most careful consideration has

convinced us that not only is iir. Richardson deserving of the

recommended pronotion, but his elevation to the higher grade will

bo in the best interest of

the Carcer

Service and meet definite

Division requirements for a senior officer at the GS-15 lovel.

SUBJECT: Jacques RICHARDSON - Recommendation for Fronation

1.

perfomance, I recommend that ha be entered for consideration on the SR

Division AS-14 to 65-15 promotion l1st at this time - June 1957.

The slot

and Job which he now occuples, Chief, Soviet branch, 18, of course, adequate:

te accommodate such a promotion.

Richardson's operational performance has been outstanding and

sotably rergatile during this period.

He has engaged. primarily 1n 11a13on

and has been personally affective In terns of results achloved almost dally,.

In terns of reporto, operational data, and Jolot enterprises while, overall,'

he has established endurine professional relationships fron which the

organisation as a whole should benefit for sona time to come.

In addition,

owing in large part to unique personal talents, linguistic an otherwise,

Richardson has handed a muber of unilateral cases most elfoctivaly.

the offico, too, as woll as in face-to-laco operational situations,

Richardson

has been cutstanding. He has a flair for and a facility with the written word

a8 evidencad by tha amount of general and particular correspondence which he

has initlated, and he knows the organizational "dr1ll" Intinately and fran way

Thus, I feal that he 1s quallfied for she raconmended promotion by

ability and experience in both the internel and extemal aspects of the

protession.

Relative to the nore personal characteristics Imolved in the term

managerial ability, judgments are recessarily nore subjective but here, too,

I consider Richardoon to be qualified in naturity, 1n judgrent, and in

He would most certainly be a supervisor who could

perforn all

the chores or handle all the situations which he dould ba calling upon

the beginning of any good supervisory

In actual fact, he has had considerable experience in this

regard already and the principal shortcoming I have noticed 18 a tendency

to

is a rural In extend of personal rentson chandon a rot rethout

times and mantfestly impattent in cartain human situations where a shrue of:

the shoulders would be the best reply. These characteristica do not always

make for the best personal relationships but are frequently obviated by

intellect and above all are correctable and are being corrected.
