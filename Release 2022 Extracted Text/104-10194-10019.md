to the development of human relations. His forte is therefore
more in the field of spotting and'making operational contacts
than in that of more than s.ort-range operational development.
Subject's operational. situation makes it impossible for him to
attempt recruitments. Thus, his very real achievements are not
by essence of the spectacular variety.

Subject's reporting has been satisfactory and continue to
be copious. He could, however, further improve the selectivity
of the leads provided the Station and make more of an effort to
“digest” the information contained in his reports.

Although Subject has, at present, no supervisory function,
he has repeatedly requested such a responsibility. fe is careful
with operational expanses and has exercised good security.

During the period under review, additional efforts have been
made to make full use of Subject's potential and integrate him
further in the work of the station component with which he works.
He is a particularly valuable asset for the Station programs
directed against the local MHHARSH and TPFAST targets.

Section D (continued)

substantial. In a word, is it worth it? We do not yet know,
although our initial impressions are favorable.

On the fitness report itself, this rater would have preferred
an "S" rating for specific duty number one; Subject may ultimately
deserve an "0", but it does net seem warranted at the present time.
Moreover, I believe the overall rating would more properly have
been in the higher range of the "Pp" category, rather than "Ss",
but it is of course a subjective judgment of the rating officer,
who is more intimately and directly involved with Subject on a
frequent basis.

In sum, is superb, and’only time will reveal to

what extent the Crear fomeizencnts pexmit a full measure on be-
nalf of Organization. We are following this aspect closely

and will be commenting upon it subsequently, as we gain experience
and knowledge.

from the Organization, -his continued presence at this Station definitely
appears to be warranted for a sufficicnt period to reach more definite
conclusions concerning the level of sustained performance over a somewhat
longer period than that reflected by this report.

On balance, we are pleased that this officer has responded so well to
greater case officer direction and that he has undertaken somewhat more
aggressive efforts to expand his range of contacts in immediate proximity

to the primary Station targets, This officer does bring many talents to bear

“Nonetheless, it will require additional time to explore these contacts in

depth, sclect those which appear to be operationally viable, and pursue
tein actively either to the point of recruitment by another officer or elimina-,

In sum, in spite of the recognized and commendable improvement in this
officer's performance during the period under review, the reviewer submits
that the letter grade for specific duties 2 and 4 would more properly have
been a "P", and that the overall rating, at this point, would more accurately
be set at a level between "P" and "S", probably closer to the former than

the latter,

MEMORANDUM Noe 360 18 June 1957
TO: Chief of Station -

FROM: Chief, Soviet Branch
SUBJECT: Jacques RICHARDSON = Recommendation for Promotion

1. Jacques Richarduon has boen under my supervision as Deputy and
Case Officer: for approximately fifteen months. Baned on the knowledge of
‘Richardson as an individual gained during this period and upon his actual
performance, I reconmend that he be entered for consideration on the SR
Division GS-1 to GS-15 promotion list at this time - dune 1957. The slot
and job which he now occupies, Chief, Soviet Branch, is, of course, adequate

te accomodate euch a promotion,

2. Richardson's operational performance has been outstanding and
rotebly versatile during this period, He hea engaged primarily jn liaison
and has been personally effective in terms of results achieved almost daily,.
in terns of reports, operationel data, ani joint enterprises while, overall,’
he has established enduring professional relationships from which the
organisation as a whole should benefit for some time to come. In addition, ©
owing in large part to unique personal talents, linguistic and otherwise,
Richardson has handled a number of unilateral cases most effectively. In
the office, too, as well as in facé-to-face operational situations, Richardson
has been cutetanding, He has a flair for and a facility with the written word
as evidenced by the anount of genersl and particular correspondence which he!
has initiated, and he knows the organizational "drill" intimately and fran way
back, Thus, I feel that he 4s qualified for ‘he recommended promotion by
ability and experience in both the intemel and external aspects of the

profession.

3. ‘Relative to the more ‘personal characteristics involved in the tern
managerial ability, judgments are recessarily more subjective but here, too,
I consider Richardson to be qualified in maturity, in judgnent, and in
experience. He would mst certainly be a dupervicor who coult perform all
the chores or handle all the situations which h= would be calling upon
subordinates to take care of, in itself, the beginning of any good supervisory
relationship. In actual fact, ho has had considerable experience in this
regard already and the principal shortcoming I have noticed is a tendency to
"carry" others by an extension of his own industry. Richardson is not without
tds difficulties in the area of personal relationships. He is a purist at
times and manifestly impatient in certain human situations where a shrug of
the shoulders would be the best reply. These characteristics do not always
make for the best personal relationships but are frequently obviated by
intellect and above all are correctable and ere being corrected.
