Memorandum to the Assistant Director

Criminal Investigative Division

Re: HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS
JAMES EARL RAY - INFORMATION CONCERNING

advised that the Committee did not instruct or direct
the informant to obtain this information. Mr. Blakey
allowed SAs Coulson and Stearns to look at the map and
to compare it with an aerial photograph of the prison.
The map corresponds fairly accurately to the aerial
photograph; however, it should be noted that the map
depicts an additional guard tower on the north wall of
the prison that was not in place at the time of James
Earl Ray's previous escape attempt. There are nota-
tions on the map with instructions to toss or throw an
unidentified item into an area within the prison wall at
an area near the east bluff that borders the prison
property. There is another notation indicating that
another unidentified item or items should be buried near
a large tree adjacent to the northeast corner of the
wall. There are further notations indicating that it is
possible to walk along the bluff that adjoins the east
wall of the prison.

Mr. Blakey advised that the informant had gone
to considerable trouble to have his name placed on
James Earl Ray's visiting list. It had been contemplated
that the informant and Jerry Ray would be visiting with
James Earl Ray prior to doing some "legwork" for Mark
Lane, attorney for Ray, and for captioned Committee. The
informant has been advised by Jerry Ray that this
"legwork" will possibly not be necessary. This causes
the Committee to opine that it may not be necessary
because James Earl Ray plans to escape and additional
work will not be necessary. On one visit to the prison,
James Earl Ray and the informant walked along the bluff
that overlooks the area where the item is to be thrown
into the prison compound. Mr. Blakey further advised
that the informant has not been apprised of any escape
attempt, but bases his belief in the validity of the
escape attempt on the fact that the map and accompanying
instructions appear to be legitimate, Jerry Ray's
examination of the area overlooking the compound and
the fact that the informant has been told that they
May not be doing "legwork" for Ray's attorney.

Memorandum to the Assistant Director
Re: HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS
JAMES EARL RAY -— INFORMATION CONCERNING

Mr. Blakey further stated that their investi-
gation has determined that pridr to escape attempts by
James Earl Ray, he has been visited by a member of his
family shortly before the escape attempt took place.

Jerry Ray is scheduled to visit James Earl Ray on 5/15/78.
He is scheduled to testify before captioned Committee on
5/10/78. The Committee staff feels that the escape attempt,
if it takes place, will occur sometime after 5/15/78.

Mr. Blakey advised that the Committee is very
reluctant to bring this matter to the attention of prison
officials inasmuch as they fear the officials will
place James Earl Ray in solitary confinement and change
existing procedures to prevent escape, thus compromising
their informant. The Committee is obviously concerned
not only with preventing Ray's escape, but with the
possibility of apprehending Jerry Ray for his part in
the conspiracy to assist in the escape attempt.

Mr. Blakey stated that he did not know what, if any,
involvement prison personnel may have in the escape
attempt and was therefore reluctant to take the matter up
with prison officials.

Mr. Blakey stated that he does not know anyone
in the Tennessee State Police to refer this matter to and
does not know their capabilities for handling this type of
investigation. He feels that based on the FBI's involve-
ment in the prior escape of James Earl Ray, there is
a potential violation of the Unlawful Flight Statute and
a conspiracy to violate the Unlawful Flight Statute.

Mr. Blakey feels that this is a very sensitive
situation. If the Committee were known to furnish this
information to prison authorities, and James Earl Ray is
placed in solitary confinement, it could be looked upon
as an attempt by the Committee to harrass Ray in order to
have him cooperate with the Committee.

Memorandum to the Assistant Director

Criminal Investigative Division

Re: HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS:
JAMES EARL RAY - INFORMATION CONCERNING

It should be noted that James Earl Ray and
five other individuals escaped from this prison on
6/10/77 and were apprehended within a few days. The
Attorney General authorized the issuance of an Unlawful
Flight Statute warrant based on a violation of Title 18,
United States Code, Section 371, Conspiracy to Commit
Offenses Against the United States, and Title 18,

United States Code, Section 1073, Unlawful Flight to
Avoid Confinement.

On 5/26/78 Mr. Blakey advised that the informant
could be contacted by the FBI, working through the
Committee staff.

RECOMMENDATION :

In view of the sensitive nature of this informa-
tion and the notoriety attached to this case, it is
recommended that it be discussed with the Director and

the Attorney General.

authorizing the FBI to release his informant file to the Committee. This file
reflects that the FBI considered the informant to be reliable. Mr. Blakey considers
his reliability factor to be extremely high currently. The name of this informant has
not been furnished to the FBI by the Committee. This information was furnished to
Mr. Paul Mack on the evening of 4-25-78 at 6:30 p.m. Legal Counsel requested

this information be made known to Associate Director Adams.

ADDENDUM: CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIVE DIVISION (CID) FXO:wss 4/27/78

While James Earl Ray has achieved notoriety as the
convicted killer of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., he remains
incarcerated at a Tennessee prison based on his conviction in
state court. In 1977 when Ray and others escaped from Brushy
Mountain State Prison, we did get involved in the effort to
apprehend him based on his alleged conspiracy to violate
Title 18, U. S. Code, Section 1973 (Unlawful Flight).

In the present circumstances, no escape has occurred
and no real jurisdictional basis appears to exist to support
any investigative activity by the FBI. Inasmuch as Mr. Blakely

. has seen fit to bring this matter to our attention, we believe
that we have a distinct obligation to see that prison and state
officials are made aware of the alleged plan. If a criminal
act is underway, it is entirely a matter for prison and state
officials to address at this point.

CID recommends that a representative of Legal Counsel
Division advise Mr. Blakely that the FBI will not initiate
investigzion and that he should disclose information in his
possession to appropriate Tennessee authorities. If he is
reluctant to make such disclosure, he should be advised that
the FBI will do so on his behalf and will make every effort
to act in such a manner as not to jeopardize the source of the
information.

Dear Mr. Attorney General: .

On December 13, 1977, as part of its continuing investi-
gation into the assassination of Martin Luther King, the House
Select Committee on Assassinations submitted a request to the
Department .of Justice for the following information:

a) A list of all Department of Justice attorneys who
participated in any way in the direction or manage-
ment of the MURKIN investigation and the Division and
Section with the Department,of Justice where these

attorneys were tue. a5 Ly 2 at? ? 2 a 33
b) Copies of all memoe ands records, documents,
news releases generated by the Department of ears
in connection with the MURKIN investigation, exclu-
sive of what is contained in the MURKIN file already: a
provided to the Committee.

Tod tt a8
On March 21, 1978, a "partial" response to our request if
was sent to the staff of the Select Committee. This includéd-"' ™
the names of seven attorneys assigned to the Civil Rights
Division of the Department of Justice who participated in the
MURKIN investigation.

On April .19, 1978, a final response to our request was
transmitted to the Select Committee. The documents contained

Department's extradition file on Ray (95-100-473). The DOJ/FBI
communications were omitted due to a prior agreement not to
process documents contained in the Bureau's MURKIN file; the
extradition file was not processed because it was felt to lie
outside the scope of our 12/13/77 request.

In light of the limited amount of material produced in
response to the initial HSCA request, it is hereby requested
that the Department of Justice provide, on an expedited basis,
the following additional material:

1) Copies of all memoranda, records and documents genera-
ted by the Department of-Justice in connection with
the MURKIN investigation, including all correspondence
or communications from the Department of Justice to
the FBI, and all correspondence or communications
from the FBI to the Department of Justice. It is
assumed that the vast majority of documents produced
in response to this request will be located in DOJ
file #144-72-662.

2) Copies of all memoranda, records and documents,
located in DOJ file #95-100-473 or elsewhere, genera-
ted during the course of proceedings relating to Ray's
extradition from England in the summer of 1968.

3) Copies of all documents contained in the folder
entitled "Martin Luther King Daily Reports", referred
to in a February, 1976 memorandum from Stephen Horn,
Attorney, Criminal Section, Civil Rights Division, to
Walter W. Barnett, Deputy Chief, Appellate Section,
Civil Rights Division. Mr. Horn's memorandum, which
was included in those documents recently provided. to
the HSCA, indicates that the reports contained in
this folder cover a period between 2/4/65 and 3/14/68.

4) Copies of all memos from Hoover to the AAG concerning
the progress of the investigation. These memos,
included as item "7" of Mr. Horn's above-referenced
memorandum, were apparently located in a filing
cabinet in the Civil Rights Division at the time of
Mr. Horn's memorandum.

5) Copies of all documents contained in the two loose
folders of correspondence and memoranda concerning
the assassination referred to as item "13" of Mr.
Horn's February, 1976 memorandum.

6) A list of the United States Attorneys in the Federal
districts which encompassed Memphis, TN; Atlanta, GA;
New Orleans, LA; Los Angeles, CA; Birmingham, AL;
and St. Louis, MO; at the time of Dr. King's assas—
sination in April of 1968.

7). Copies of all chronological files currently available
for former Attorney General Ramsey Clark, former
Deputy Attorney General Christopher, former Assistant
Attorney General Pollak and former Assistant Attorney
General Vinson.

The above listed requests have been discussed previously
in recent telephone conversations between Mr. Robert Keuch,
Special Counsel to the Attorney General, and Mr. Peter Beeson,
staff attorney for the Select Committee.

In addition, it is hereby requested that copies of the
two additional files listed below, (and referenced in Mr. Horn's
February, 1976 memorandum), be provided to the Select Committee.

8) A folder concerning memoranda and FBI reports on the
Memphis marches (sanitation strike) of March-April,
1968, (item 4 in Mr. Horn's memorandum) .

9) Memoranda concerning Memphis v. King, the attempt to
enjoin the march of the Sanitation Workers to he led
by King, (item 12 in Mr. Horn's memorandum) .

Because of the amount of time which passed pending com-
pliance with the December 13, 1977 HSCA request, we ask that
these additional files be prepared as expeditiously as possible,
and-in any case no later than May 31, 1978.

We sincerely appreciate your cooperation in this request.

Dear Mr. Attorney General:

In connection with the investigation by this Committee
into the circumstances surrounding the death of Dr. Martin
Luther King, Jr., it has been learned that the Miami Field

- Office sent recent communication by teletype pertaining to
William A. Somersett. The Committee, therefore, would like

‘_ the assistance of the Bureau in locating this recent teletype,
and further, to be provided with all relevant copies.

mA Specifically, the Miami teletype is dated March 28, 1978
and refers to special Bureau instructions to the Albany Field
Office dated August 15, 1977 and October 28, 1977, re William
A. Somersett. The Committee would greatly appreciate expedi-
tious retrieval of this document and any other references re-
lated to this matter.

Finally, the Committee would like the FBI to make S. A.

James P. McMahon, formerly of the stain Field Office, avail—

able for Staff interview. 7 :

Your continued cooperation is greatly appreciated.

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS /

U. S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES (HSCA) a

PURPOSE: To advise that the HSCA has requested access to

five (5) informant files and to recommend that access to these
files by the HSCA be restricted only to Mr. Gy Robert Blakey,
Chief Counsel and Director, HSCA. We z

DETAILS: In connection with its invest. ation into the
assassination of Martin Luther King, Jy., the HSCA, by letter

to the Attorney General dated April 12, 1978, requested access
to FBI Headquarters (FBIHQ) files of 5 informants, who reported
on activities of the Invaders, a Memphis youth group involved in
violence during the Sanitation Workers Strike in Memphis during:
March-April, 1968. F NK »)

Through review of the Invaders' file at FBIHQ, the
HSCA learned that the Memphis Office had 5 informants who
were providing coverage of the Invaders. Mr. G. Robert Blakey,
Chief Counsel and Director, HSCA, has advised Legal Counsel
Division that the HSCA is trying to resolve the issue as to
whether or not the Invaders fomented racial violence to get
King to return from Atlanta to Memphis where he was killed.
The HSCA desires to review these informant files to determine
if any of them acted as "agent provacatSrs" in starting iE

Lol 7
violence FeO REC-€5 Co -119.24 a

To date the oniy “fnrormant files made available to
the HSCA have been in instances where the informant has been
publicly identified ‘or where an informant, during interview by
the HSCA, has admitted his relationship with the Bureau and
signed a waiver authorizing release to the HSCA all
information concerning him. The latter has occurred on three

occasions. i MAY 28 1978

Discussions concerning release of these ae
files have been conducted by representatives of the Tegal biad
and Congressional Affairs Unit, Legal Counsel Division, Top

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS
U. S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES (HSCA)

Division and Congressional Inquiry Unit, Records Management
Division. Conclusions are as follows: (1) Protection of our
informants and sources throughout the course of the HSCA
investigation is of paramount importance. (2) If release of

these 5 files, with nf ey
could satisfy the HSCA tha ese informants were not responsible

for violence which occurred in Memphis at the time King was

killed, then the best interests of the FBI are served; (3) To

avoid precedent of the HSCA's staff reviewing informant files,

only Mr, Blakey should be given access to these 5 te Setpet

t FZLNR

On April 26, 1978, Mr. Blakey advised that it would

be acceptable that only he be given access to the Invader

informant files.

If approved, files will be processed by the Congressional
Inquiry Unit and prior to being made available to Mr. Blakey,
excisions will be reviewed by the Top Echelon and Criminal
Informant Unit.

RECOMMENDATION: That approval be granted to process these
5 individual informant files for access of Mr. Blakey in
order to comply with HSCA request of April 12, 1978.

provide this Committee copies of all bank records secured in
the investigation of certain members of the Ray family. In
FBI memorandum dated March 1, 1978, reference was made to the
Bureau having included John Raynes (father) ir the bank records
search. It has come to our attention, subsequently, that spe-
cific records of John Raynes were secured by the St. Louis
Field Office in connection with their investigation; oddly
those bank records do not appear in the materials furnished

U. S, HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES if

PURPOSE:

To state-the position of the Organized Crime Section, Criminal
Investigative Division (CID), regarding the confidentiality of informant files
in cooperating with captioned Committee. See D. Ryan to Mr. Bassett
memorandum dated April 27, 1978. 135

DETAILS: Paaeeah|

ae

CID is aware of the issue which the House Select Committee on ~

Assassinations (HSCA) is attempting to resolve by review of the five informant
files in question. Moreover, CID agrees that limiting the review of excised
versions of the five files solely to G. Robert Blakey is a reasonable response
to the Committee's request. However, the Organized Crime Section, CID,
wishes to go on record with the following concerns in this matter:

1. Any request which exceeds the agreed manner of review, such as
a request to review the complete infgxmant file should be strenuously ee

and refused. ou 8 aces (, Qe- 1/9 240 — [6b
ant files

2. Requests for copies of any portions of the excised info:
should also be declined as it is obvious that access to both the contents of the
substantive case files and even excised versions of the informant, files would us
permit identification of the applicable informants.

2 MAY 23 1978
CID is sensitive to the continued and real need to take every effortt to

maintain the confidentiality of the identity of an informant and-Bureawreedstan
maintained on his behalf. As in the past, any subsequent requests from’ ‘the
Committee concerning informant records should be referred to CD" ae

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS (HSCA)

NOTE: HSCA request of 4/12/78 listed five serials reviewed
by the HSCA which contained information regarding the
Hanes-Shelton relationship. The HSCA desired to interview
informants providing that information, if informants would be
agreeable. This information is furnished by the above two
informants and former BH 418-R (NO 1289-R). By teletype
dated 4/28/78, these offices were instructed to contact
informants and determine if they had any objection to being
interviewed by the HSCA. BH 418-R (NO 1289-R) has not been
contacted to date. SA George Ross, Columbia Office, and ASAC
Richard Blay, Memphis Office, were telephonically contacted
on 5/17/78 concerning this matter. They agreed that having
informants initiate contact with the HSCA was the best method
of handling this situation. This matter was coordinated at
FBIHQ with SA D. 0. Coulson, Legal Counsel Division, and
J. J, Jamar, Criminal Investigative Division.
