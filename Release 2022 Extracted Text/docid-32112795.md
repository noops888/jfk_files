Bureau of Investigation (FBI), was deposed in Room 457 of
the Bussell Senate Office Building by Messrs, James Dick,
John @, Hlliff, and Bric Richard, Staff Members of the

relating to the so-called Watch List maintained by the
National Security Agency{NSA) to record the list of names
of individuals and organigations furnished to that Agency
by the FBI for the purpose of receiving information coming
to NSA's attention during the course of its regular activities
relating to communications matters.

fhe questions and answers were recorded by Mrs. Susan famback,
Five minutes befere the beginning of the deposition
Senator Richard S. Schweiker of Pennsylvania appeared
and placed Mr. Wannall under cath. He then departed.
Mr, Wannall was advised of his rights. He was told that
since @ senator would sot be present he could deeline to
answer quéstions and he could request a discontiauasce at
any time. He was further advised that the results would
be recorded and he would be given aa oppertunity to review
the transcription and sign it at a later time.

SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)
RE: DEPOSITION OF ASSISTANT DIRECTOR W. RAYMOND WANNALL

advised of the contents of the letter which authorized

Mr. Wannall to discuss and provide deposition, as requested,
in executive (closed) session matters concerning the Watch
List formally maintained by NSA at the request of the FBI.
The letter stated further that concerning open sessions of
the Senate Select Committee, Mr. Wannall was advised that

NSA and Senate Select Committee representatives would
commence negotiations on October 4, 1975, to define limits
within which Special Intelligence information may be disclosed
in open session and pending establishment of such limits, .
FBI personnel were requested not to discuss Special Intelli«
gence matters in such open ‘sessions.

Mr. James Dick of the Committee Staff was the
principal interviewer, The following represents to the
best of Mr. Wannali‘s recollection the information furnished
by him responsive to specific questions. Material is not
necessarily set forth in the order in which the questions
were asked and the responses given.

Mr. Wannall was first exposed to NSA-type material
when he arrived at Headquarters for assignment in 1947, This
material had been produced by a predecessor agency to the
National Security Agency. He became aware of some of the
overall capabilities of the NSA probably sometime durin;
the late 1950's. y

He was shown copies of three FRI internal memoranda
addressed from We Wannall to Ws ©; Sullivan (at that
time Assistant Director of the Domestic Intelligence Division
of the FBI) captioned "Communications Intelligence = Cuba,"
and dated respectively May 18, 1962, January 16, 1963, and
April 6, 1965. :

Me, Wannall explained that since Communications
Intelligence matters relating to Cuba were handled in the
Section of which he was Chief during this period, he had
some personal knowledge in this area, With respect to
Watch List matters in other areas of interest to the FBI,
his knowledge for the most part was based on a review of
material and information provided to him orally by current
personnel of the Intelligence Division—principally during
the preceding 24 hours. In this connéction, he explained

RE; DEPOSITION OF ASSISTANT DIRECTOR W. RAYMOND WANNALL

that he had learned at about 5;30 p.m. the preceding day,
October 2, 1975, that his deposition testimony would be
expected to rélate either mainly or exclusively to Watch
List matters.

The memoranda described above related to meetings
held in Wannall's office in May, 1962, and January, 1963,
at which representatives of NSA and representatives of
Wannall's former Section were present. The discussions
centered about the means whereby NSA could be most helpful
to the FBI in processing some 20,000 messages received
each month in NSA's coverage of Cuban matters. The
messages were said to relate to both commercial and
personal communications between Cuba and the United States.

The three memoranda showed that a procedure was
worked out whereby the FBI could submit approximately
300 names and addresses to NSA for the purpose of securing
information rélating to FBI responsibilities.

My. Wannall was asked whether any criteria were
established for the purpose of compiling the list of some
300 na . He responded in the affirmative and described
the criteria prior to being shown the memorandum of April 6,
1965, wherein the ¢riteria were set forth. The procedures
for submitting the names were deseribed., They consisted
basically of attaching on a regular basis to a cover
memorandum lists of names of individuals appearing in
the Cuban Special Section of the Security Index and names
of individuals listed in the regular section of the Security
Index tabbed "pro-Cuban," together with identifying data

t Dy latelligence Agents
operating in the United States and Puerto Rico. The
memoranda with attachments were'seat through regular
reviewing chaniiels for approval te deliver to NSA the
attachments themselves.

Mr. Dick referring to two other programs involving
the Watch List {mentioned hereinafter) stated that similar
procedures were not followed in submission of names to NSA
and asked why this was so. He was advised that matters
relating to the Watch List were handled on a aeed=to+know
and strictly compartmented basis and the procedures utilized
in other Sections would not necessarily be the same as
those utilized in the Section formerly headed by Mr. Wannall.

RE: DEPOSITION OF ASSISTANT DIRECTOR W. RAYMOND WANNALL

%m response to questioning, Mr. Wannall stated
that he could not recall any instances wherein names
regarding the Cuban Wateh List were submitted orally to
NSA, but 4t was possible that this may have been done in
some cases. He was not able to comment on the volume of
material received from NSA in connection with the Cuban
Watch List since the product went directly to the desks
of the supervisors handling Cuban matters within his
Section. He did recall that the quality of information
was in some instances very good (since it related to
knoWn or suspected Cuban Intelligence Agents operating
in the United States and Puerto Rico.)

The memorandum of May 18, 1962, referred to
the fact that it would be helpful te the FBI to receive
@ periodic listing of firms in the U;&. which were doing
business with individuals in Cuba aid with the Cuban
Government. In explaining this comment, it was pointed
out that the UsS5; Government had established a list of
restricted items which could not be sent to Cuba without
an export license and material of this nature would have
been of value to the FBI to establish identities of firms
which might be contravening the provisions of regulations
So adopted and administered by the Department of Commerce.
It was pointed out that to Mr. Wannali's knowledge no

suéh USS; firms were subsequently ineluded on the Watch
Hist.

The memorandum of January 16, 1963, referred
to the possibility of furnishing to NSA a listing of

imately 1,100 Cuban invasion prisoners and 900

ives of these prisoners who had recently been

EX ted to the U.S, It was explained that this referred

to the prisoners taken by the Cubans during the Bay of

Pigs in\ on in April, 1961, who, to the best of Mr. Wannali’s
recollection, had been released by the Cuban Government and
Ung Peierind to the United States around Christmastime of

It was pointed out that to the best of Mr. Wannall's
recollection, representatives of NSA conducted a general
briefing of certain personnel of the Domestic Intelligence
Division sometime around the Fall of 1969 in order that the

capability of NSA to assist the FBI in discharging its
responsibilities in the intelligence field might be made
known. This general briefing was not a briefing relating
exclusively to the Watch List covering new left matters.

A representative of the Section then headed by Mr. Wannail
was sent to the general briefing but to the best of

My. Wannall's recollection not to the briefing covering
the New Left Watch List. Mr. Wannall again noted the

fact that his awareness regarding both the New Left Wateh
List and another Watch List relating to racial matters

had come principally from reviews of material and briefings
by Intelligence Division personnel within the preceding
24-hour period,

Mr. Wannall was shown a copy of a letter
originating with NSA which contained a code word utilized
in connection with the New Left Watch List and was asked
aif he had ever heard the code name. He replied that he
liad heard it and estimated that it was some several months
to a ‘year or more after the New Left Watch List briefing
in the Fall of 1969 which has been referred to above.

Mr. ELLIZ£ inquired as to the rules utilized
by Headquarters in referring material originating with
NSA to its various field offices for investigative attention,
He was advised that the ld was told the information
could be utilized for lead purposes only, could not be
included in any communication prepared for dissemination,
and that individuals outside the FBI should not become
cognizant of the fact that the FBI was in possession of
the material, My. ElLiff asked if the same standards
were applied to. information which was the product of
foreign intelligénee electronic surveillances conducted

i.e He was advised that that was not the case;
information so préduced could be set forth in communications
prepared for dissemination in properly paraphrased form
and in a itanner which would protect the identity of the
source.

With respect to foreign intelligence electronic
surveillances conducted by the FBI, Mr. Elliff asked if
there was one place to which FBI personnel could refer for

the purpose of recovering such information. In response,
the operation of the FBI's Electronic Surveillance Index
was explained and it was pointed out that this index was
not utilized as a Watch List. It was further explained
that there is no computerization of such information.

In response to a specific request, the Staff Members were
advised that the material received from NSA as a result
of the so-called Watch Lists had not been computerized.

Mr. Wannall was shown a copy of a letter
addressed to the Director of NSA dated June 3, 1970,
c which the subject had been excised with a notation
it was a code word for one of the Watch Lists,
dentified in a note on the yellow file copy as the
Watch List relating to new left matters. In the letter
the Director of NSA was informed that the FBI had a
¢ wing interest in receiving intelligence information
din this particulary operation. Mr. Wannall
@ ined that from his review of material, he had
established that this letter apparently had been written
in response to a request from NSA that the FBI indicate
42 it did, in fact, have a continuing interest ain
receiving such information. At this point, a copy of
sent to the FBI by NSA was exhibited and it
‘ted the reply to the previous question.

Mr. Dick then exhibited a copy of a teletype
dated December 24, 1970, which had been sent by the FBI
to NSA concerning an individual named Grover €. McArthur.
In the body of the teletype, it was indicated that
McArthur, a student at the University of Pennsylvania,
was planning to write 4 paper on the Black Panther Party
(BPP) and its international operations and was scheduled
to leave the United States two days later for Algiers,
Algeria, where an office of the BPP was tecated. Asked
why the name of a student writing a paper on such a
pubject matter would be placed on & Wateh List, Mr. Wannail
stated that he had no knowledge in connection with this
and suggested the possibility there may have been a file
on McArthur which would show the basis for such a request.
Mr. HLJiff stated that he would explore the question
whether, in fact, there was such an FBI file on McArthur.

ix. Wannall was specifically asked whether
| names were placed on any of the so-called Watch Lists
orally. He advised that based on discussions he had
had with Intelligence Division personnel, it was his
understanding that some names were placed on some of the
lists orally, but that he was unable to say how many and
would estimate that the percentage was small. He was
asked if he had any information indicating that set
procedures were established with respect to the Watch
| Lists relating to new left and racial matters. He said
| he had been advised that a card file had been naintained
as an administrative aid in order that the identities
| of individuals and organizations on a Watch List would
be readily available, This card file was maintained on
| a temporary basis and cards were destroyed upon the
| yemoval of the names of individuals and organizations
| on the list. There was no central repository in Bureau
files for the names on the lists. On a recurring basis,
NSA would furnish Watch List print-outs which were
i circularized in order that a review could be made to
i assure that the list was up to date. It was pointed
out by Mr. Wannall that he could not estimate how often
these lists were recéived from NSA and circularized,
although he felt that it was prebably more frequently
than yearly. Mr. Dick posed a question as to whether
any ames had been placed on the Watch Lists for foreign
intelligence agencies and Mr. Wannall replied in the
negative, Mr. Dick then exhibited a copy of a letter
addressed by the Bureau to the Director of NBA on
March 22, 1971, in which a request was made for any
pertinent information which might come to NSA's attention
concerning certain individuals who were named in an
enclosure. The note on the yellow file copy indicated
that the names on the enclosure had been furnished by
a foreign intelligence service (the name of which had
peen- excised) and that the individuals were ones in
whon that service had an extreme interest. The note
further indicated that in addition to being of interest
to the foreign intelligence service, the individuais were
also of interest to the FBI in view of existing close
relationships between Black extremist activities in the
United States and a foreign country. Mr. Wannall pointed
out that his previous negative reply should probably have
| been qualigied with the statement "to my knowledge," and
that what seemed te be pertinent with respect to this
matter was (1) whether NSA had ever provided information

on any of the persons listed on the enclosure and (2) if so,
whether such information had been furnished to the foreign
intelligence service.

. Another letter exhibited was one dated June 8,
1971, from the FBI to the Director of NSA captioned "Black
Nationalist Movement, Racial Matters." This letter
referred to some names, addresses, and, in some instances,

phone numbers which had been previously forwarded to
NSA by communication dated June 4, 1971, and requested
any peytinent information which NSA might possess or
might have come to its attention concerning the individuals.
The June 8, 1971, letter also had a note on the yellow
in which it was stated that the list of names sent to NSA
dune 4, 1971, included suspects in the NEWKILL case and
relatives and associates of suspects, aS well as BPP
members. In response to questions, Mr. Wannall explained
wl that ¢ase was and how the Bureau was called upon to
undertake investigation. Since the case involved the
killing of New York €ity Police Departuent officers in -
about May, 1971, Mr. Dick commented upon the possible use
3f NSA=produced information in a criminal investigation.
advised that Mr. Wannall had no knowledge as to
er or not NSA provided any information which was
so used in this particular matter. x

Referring to previous information to the effect
that Mr. Wannall was aware in the late 1950's of certain
NSA operations, Mr. Dick inquired as to whether NSA was
supplying information to the FBI before the institution
of the Watch Lists. The reply was affirmative. He asked
4£ such information inoluded material on United States

ens, While Mr. Wannall could not recall specifics
in this regard, he expressed the opinion that material
on UjS, citizens was provided in the late:1950's and
prior to the institution of the Watch Lists procedures.
Mr. Dick mentioned a specific name of apparent French
derivation which was not recognized by Mr. Wannall.

Inquiry was made as to whether former Director
Hoover had given approval to the submission of namés
by the FBI to NSA. Mr. Dick was advised that it was
recalled that in reviewing material during the preceding
24 hours, Mr. Wannall had seen former Director Hoover's

approval on a communication releting to a Watch List
and hed also noted a serial or two which had beer etamped
into Me. Hoover's office. It was further pointed out
with respect to the appromal of names for Watch Lists
thet normally the various Assistant Directors of the
Division now called the Intelligence Divisioa would have
guecessively been the FEI represeatative on the United
States Intelligence Board (USIE) and thus would probably

Another sentence in this same letter on page 4
was to the effect “We have never considered NSA information
or; for that matter, information in our files which
originated with any other United States agency as being
derived from electronic surveillance devices, since we
are not privy to the methods and means of their obtaining
the iaformation." Mr. Dick asked that since the word “we”
was used in this sentence, did it mean that just the writer
ér the Bureau took the position that NSA information was —
not considered ag being derived from electroni¢ surveillance
devices. He was advised that again what was in the writer's
mind could not be interpreted but that Mr. Wannall could
cite a persotial experience which might have a pearing on
his question, Several years ago in a situation concerning
which the circumstances and reasons could not be recalled,
Mr. Wannall was desirous of establishing the Gourke of
certain information which had been provided by NSA. When
he discussed this with the FBI Liaison Agent who dealt
with NSA, he was told that the Liaison Agent understood
NSA utilized electronic sources, live sources, other

s be § and foreign, and probably other type
so es, The Liaison Agent further commented that NSA
would not reveal a souree of theirs any more so than
the Bureau would discuss a souree.

During an off*the-record discussion, a letter
from the Attorney General to the Director, FBI, dated
October 1, 1973, was considered. This letter captioned
"R ts by FBI to NSA for Dissemination of Electronic
Survei: ace Information” contained instructions that the
FBI should inmediately cease requesting any further
information from NSA which was obtained by that agency
by méans of electronic surveillances. The Attorney General
made an excéption to this by stating that if the FBI
desived to obtain solely foreign intelligence or counter=
jonage information from the NSA, which was acquired
by: ageney through electronic surveillances, the
Attorney General's prior approval be secured. During
the off+the-record discussion, Mr. ElLif" stated that he
wanted to get Mr. Waunall's reply onthe record as to

in this regard, utilizing the procedures which were
outlined in the Attorney General's letter of October 1,
1973. Myr. Elliff was reminded of the parameters of the
interview and the scope of release issued by NSA to

Mr. Wannall to permit the latter to be déposed. Mr. Elliff
Said that since Watch Lists matters were involved, he
wanted to pursue this and accordingly returning to on=the-
| record interview, Mr. Dick asked whether since the October 1,
41973, letter from the Attorney Géneral the Bureau had

u the procedure of seeking the Attor General's
appro: to obtain solely foreign intellige or counter=
espionage information from NSA. The reply was negative.
The question was propounded as to whether at the present
@ the FBI levies requests upon NSA. Mr. Wannall
ponded that at the present time the FBI does not

est NSA to add to its electronic searching capability
any names or items of interest to FBI investigations.

The FBI, however, has requested to be placed on NSA's
general distribution list for certain items of information
which that agency devélops by its foreign coverage in the
course of servicing requests received from the USIB or
other UsS; Government agencies.

u

Mr. Ellaff then asked whether the Bureau as
a member of the USIB made any input with respect to the
overall United States Government intelligence requirements.
He was advised that analysts prepare papers relating to
such input whieh papers are passed upon by the Board
and that the FBI has no analysts who participate in the
preparation of such papers.

{ Responding to a question, Mr. Wannall pointed
out that the Bureau does presently receive material from
NSA and has had discussions with NSA to make that agency
| aware of the FBI's foreign counterintelligence interests.

Mr. ELLi2f asked if the Attorney General was aware of this.
He was advised that Mr. Wannall vecalled attending a
briefing in the Attorney General's Office within the
past six months, which briefing was conducted by repre-
Sentatives of NSA. During the briefing the Attorney
General became aware of certain areas of FBI interests
with respect to NSA functions.
