Mr. David A. Phillips

Rethesda, Maryland 20034

Dear Dave:

. The ordinary retirement letter is in no way
appropriate for you. In the first place, your
retirement is no stepping out of the active world
: into..a world of pleasure. Instead, you are launch-

: eee! ing off on even a tougher challenge because of your

* ! sense of dedication. Your retirement also will not
be the termination of your interest in intelligence
and in this Agency. Instead, you are going to be
doing what you can to help it surviva the current
set of attacks upon it. But most of all, your
retirement is the departure of one of our most
exceptional officers, to whom I had the great
pleasure to give the Distinguished Intelligence Medal
and whose work I have admired these many years. The
only thing ordinary about your retirement is the
sincere and special personal and official good wishes
we in the Agency send -to you and your family for
success and satisfaction in the years ahead. This
we send to all our retirees, and we send it to you
with special spirit.

"You know," he said, “looking back over those months when

MEMORANDUM FOR:
‘THROUGH :
SUBJECT | 1 Notification -of Designation as a Participant in the Organlzation
Retirement and Disability System
REFERENCE : Book Dispatch 5096 dated 12 August 1965

2 You have been found to be qualified as a participant in the Organization Retirement
and Disability System and have been so designated effective 23 October 1966.

2, Although such designation under present statutes is viewed favorably by most persons,
the regulation governing this retirement system gives the individual the right to appeal such
a determination if he deems the designation adverse to his best interests. In order that this
technical requirement may be satisfied, you are hereby notified of your right to appeal. An
appeal with reasons therefore must be. received in Headquarters within 60 days of the date of
this memorandum or acceptance of designation will be assumed. Any questions that you may
have in connection with your deslgnation that cannot be answered by referring to referenced

Book Dispatch should be forwarded to Headquarters,

“3. We believe that the benefits of the Organization Retirement System are superior to the
benefits of the Civil Service Retirement System. However, there are a few situations in which
an employee.at the time of retirement may have so many years of service (almost 37) that he
would receive a higher annuity under the Civil Service System. Because of this, the polley
decision has been made that.a particlpant in the Organization System who would receive a
higher annuity under the Civil Service System may, not later than one year prior to his retire-
ment, apply to be removed from our system and transfcrred to the Civil Service System. ‘Thus,
you should not anticipate this contingency asa factor in deciding whether you regard your
designation as a participant adverse to your best interests,

tual stability havé been immeasurably increased, Several Depart-
ments and Agencies of the United States Government engaged in an

_ effort to-bring thie about. I believe that the role of the CIA in the
Dominican Republic during the past year was a crucial one. The
highly effective performance of the Santo Domingo Station and the
Base at Santiago was the reoult of the combined efforts of each offi-
cer and employee stationed there. These men and women gave un-
sparingly of their time, encrgy and brain power. Their efforts
were sustained over a long period under stressful circumstances.
Now, while our long-term mission continues, a significant mile-

+ stone has been reached and it is most appropriate at this time to
grant this special recognition for a job well done tovall members
of the GIA team in the Dominican Republic during the year ending

June 30, 1966,

2, I should like to commend each member of the Station who
contributed to this noteworthy performance and request that a copy
of this commendation be placed in individual personnel files as ap-

propriate.

To : David A. Phillips

SUBJECT; TDY in

Most of you who went down to

. departed with so much speed and so little ceremony that

there was no time to explain the importance and urgency
Noa that you have served there

during the crisis, the impertance of the task needs no
embellishment trom us, but you should know that the con=
tribution of the augmented Station was decisive in shaping
the policies and actions of the government and in avoiding
several major mistakes. (For weeks after the April revolu-
tion, our Station reporting was literally the only source
of information that the Luited States had on the role of
Communism among the rebel forces and on conditions outside

the capital,

Many fine things were done in the Station and in the
hinterland by all-of you. Manning the check-points under
fire, flying to remote and hostile villages, moving tons
of supplies through the gauntlet of the communications
line, toiling over midnight reports, and keeping open our
country's only commo link ~~ all these things were commonq
place, The dedication, discipline, and routine of our
personnel placed them in a class apart.

To the sense of pride and accomplishment you must
already feel, I want to add the gratitude and admiration
of the DDP and of the Agency.

SECTION D + NARRATIVE COMMENTS. :

1. In the périod covered-by this report Mr. Phillips was the Chief of
Station| during the frame February to August 1972. After’ that
Mr. Phillips became the Chief of Station, land served i
during the period August 1972 to April 1973. At both of these posts Mri
Phillips was responsible for managing an average of| |Agency employees.

Additionally, Mr. Phillips supervised in this period an average FY budget of
“A Which was spent on FI, CA, Cl, anti-narcotics and protected

‘ economic intelligence operations. American policy interests in and
are high in terms of the United States scale of values for Latin
America. This means that Mr. Phillips was assigned to two prestige posts
during a fifteen month time span.

2, Age asmanager Mr. Phillipg is operations oriented. In view of this he
places his time, attention and command emphasis on programs that are de-
signed to acquire intelligence and agents. This approach has consistently
produced results in terms of Fl and CA operations.which are targeted against

the host,country. \

3. Mr. Phillips was also active at both posts as an operations manager

who focused Station resources on the Soviet target, protected economic in-

" telligence and the anti-narcotics effort. Unfortunately, as these programs
moved into year Mr. Phillips was also in motion between Stations, or had
just been in place at his second Station for less than a year. As a result one
can only say that Mr. Phillips made all the right moves in his managerial
duties against these priority targets. The brevity of his program imple-
mentation at each of the two posts did not provide a solid.basis, however, for
measuring tangible succesa, In short Mr. Phillips deserves high marks for
initiative, drive and imagination on programs that were receiving incrcased

attention at Headquarters,

4, Yhe rnyriad problems that are faced when a Station moves its location
from one city to another were still challenging Mr. Phillips when he left ;
In overview terms, however, the-move from| to
was well done, This does not mean that Mr. Phillips’ successor at
did not have some gaps to fill or adjustments to make in the admini-
strative field. The scope of these actions, however, was inthe realm of the
reasonable and attests to the fact that while his basic interests are in

SECRET


operations, administration per se is not a totally alien field to Mr. Phillips.

5. In representational terms Mr. Phillips did a sound job in winning
and maintaining the respect of the American Ambassadors in land
This is due in large measure to Mr. Phillips’ native charm,
area knowledge, and language skills in Spanish and Portuguese. in addition,
“Mr. Phillips is people oriented, and this makes it possible for him to sell
himself and CIA to senior American officials at the Ambassador level.

6. In personal terms M¢. “Phillips is a hard-woiking, dedicated officer
who is a good team player. This officer has the intent, capability and desire
to fulfill the needs of the Organization. He is particularly well versed in CA
skills and is politically oriented. Asa result he likes the challenge of election

operations and is well qualified in this area. :

_ 7. Mr. Phillips' total performance during the period covered by this
report merits an evaluation of Strong.

+ 8 Interms of future assignments Mr. Phillips is likély to be at his pro-
fessional best in field activities, This officer is highly specialized in Latin
American affairs, but he is perfectly capable of being a Station Chief at most
_Agency posts in Europe or Asia.

This memorandum is in licu of the fitness report on Mr.

1 April 1970 to 30 June 1971,

Mr. Phillips is a highly capable, versatile and imaginative

*" Operations Officer and manager who makes a substantial contri-

bution to the Clandestine Service.

The above statement is borne out by the fact that faced with
a highly difficult, sensitive operational problem of the utmost
priority in the fall of 1970, the Rater immediately thought of
Mr. Phillips as the man to head the Task Force and received
immediate and enthusiastic endorsement from the Deputy Director
for Plans and the Director for Mr. Phillips' assignment. He

was recalled fron{ took over the Task Force, and handled
it in an outstanding manner.

My first statement is further borne out by the fact that
Ambassador | ona recent visit to Washington, made
a special effort to express to thé Rater his appreciation for
Mr. Phillips! support to him and the Embassy and to express
further his appreciation to the Agency for furnishing him a man
of Mr. Phillips! caliber.

MEMORANDUM IN LIEU OF FITNESS REPORT

SUBJECT: Mr, David A, Phillips
1 April 1968 to 31 March 1969

Mr, Phillips-continues to head the Division's program
against the high-priority Cuban target, although he hae also been
selected to fill an unusually responsible job overseas in the
coming year, both of which jobs testify to the high regard in which
he is held by his superiors in the Agency, Mr. Phillips has kad
the difficult task of presiding over a show which is being cut back,
in terms of money and people, and in which task he has played a
major role, At the same time as doing a pruning job, he haa had
to try to maintain a vigoroue program and to keep up enthusiasm,
His own qualities of personal leadership and of magnetism have
done a great deal to keep up enthusiasm among his people. He has
a positive attitude toward-operations and is determined; his day-
to-day concern is for devcloping new operations, and he has put
all of his own notable vigor and drive into operational directions,

Mr. Phillips knows his target and knows Latin America
well and he brings a good feel and insight into his work, which is
never pedestrian or unimaginative. He speaks well and convinc-
ingly and makes a very good impression both within the Agency and
outside, where he serves the Agency well in his relations with
other government elements, He also writes notably well,

His task this year has not been easy for he has had to deal
with an experimental situation, to a considerable extent, with the
new Miami station which he is responsible for supporting and
guiding. He has had to exercise a good deal of tact and diplomacy
in the doing of it and he has done a good job of reconciling often
conflicting views. He has shown a good head for costs in all of

this.



Mr. Phillips is a notably good supervisor, especially
with younger officers, for whom he is an object of admiration
and emulation, Mr. Phillips is a fast-moving, energetic person
and he has some of the faults that often go with this virtue: he is
impatient with details and “paper” with the consequence that if
someone else does not do it for him, his work'is sometimes
marred by inaccuracies and imprecisions.

Without going into it, it should be noted that Mr. Phillips
chas had a very trying year personally and it is a proof of his
* strength of character that he has rot only come through it but has
hardly broken his stride in carrying out a demanding job, or being
any less than his usual cheerful and charming self.

His performance has been very Strong,

such a relationship. He has come to me a number of times to volunteer

Let me say at the outset that the Rated Officer has had to work

great and continuing violence. The attention of a good part of the
world was focused upon this situation, and some of the highest national

The Rating Officer's last fitness fbGopgn Mr. Phillips dealt
with his terminating an outstandingly successful and very complicated
assignment as Chiéf of Station, This report deals
with a completely different situation, i,e, coming into Headquarters as
Chief, Cuban Operations Group at the time that drastic reduction had
just become the order of the day. The same energy, imagination and
zeal which has characterized Mr, Phillips over the years has
characterized his performance in this difficult task since his
assumption of the new responsibility, He has been a prime mover in
reducing the Headquarters WH/COG component to realistic and
managable proportions. By the same token he has been a prime mover,
guider, cajoler and sometimes "patron saint" to JMWAVE rnanagement
in ite massive job of bringing JMWAVE down from its ponderous
proportions to a viable Clandestine Services instrument" compatible
and consistent with the present day needs of Cuban operations, In thie
endeavor Mr, Phillips accomplishments have been of the first order.

This is a very fine officer with one of the best potentials in WH Division, I

believe the rater is somewhat carried away in his views. Mr. Phillips!
career advancement has been closely observed in this Division and I do not
believe he is falling behind in the promotion timetable, It is definitely
expected he will be recommended next year (which is within the proper time

Most important however, and this is one of Mr. Paillips
unique qualities, he has been able to bring about this drastic
reduction and at the same time instill enthusiasm in his staii for
new approaches to the ever more difficult Cuban target. His own
infectious enthusiasin and his fine manner with co-workers and
subordinates has made this possible. In shert the Rating Oiticer
belicves he is the right man at the right time for the job he is in,

Mr, Phillips! relations with the Department of State and
other agencies where it really counts are outstandingly good. He
has in his short time back re-established his fine relationship with

undoubtedly be of inestimable value in getting WH Division's new

It in no way, however, affects the Rating Oiticer’

opinion that Mr. Phillips is a man of considerable talent who for
one reason or another has fallen at least one grade behind in the
promotion timetable, The Rating Officer, therefore, trusts that

this will be corrected in the near future. Mr, Phillips is a gentleman
of breadth, drive, imagination and dedication, The Rating Officer
considers Mr, Phillips to be one of the very best of the many fine
officers he has known in his career in the Clandestine Services, In
some ways he is unique in that he knows the business from the ground
up, having started in unofficial cover (several assignments) and now
having moved into the managerial area wpe he can speak with

Fitness Report - David A, Phillips

SECTION C’ - Continued:

Perhaps the outstanding quality which Mr. Phillips has demon-
strated‘is his“ability to "fire up" his people to produce at their
maximum capacity. Another outstanding characteristic is his diplo-
matic manner of dealiag with other officials. Of particular note is
the fact that Subject's relationship with Ambassador lof the OAS
{who, in effect, has been the President's principal representative in

| are closer and more fruitful than the relation=
ship of the Embassy with A:nbassador This has in no way
damaged the close relationship Subject has with the Embassy and other

government officials,

Subject had little managerial experience of the scope required
by his present position prior to his arrival in nor had he had
much experience in FI matters, He has adapted readily however, and
hé continued to broaden in these respects with the passage of time.

Cost consciousness is, of course, a relative thing, Mr, Phillips
asa CA operator "thinks big." However, it is clear that he weighs
heavily costs against anticipated results and expects to get a dollar
return for each one spent, Overall Subject can be described asa very
able person, His ability to maintain Station morale at a high level while
producing at a very gruelling pace under difficult conditions is in itself
an outstandin accomplishment, Mr. Phillips has been recommended

for ae Agency Award.

Intelligence Medal in recognition of his outstanding service to
the Central Intelligence Agency for more than 22 years.. Through-
out his career Mr. Phillips has held a series of highly important
positions in Headquarters and overseas, including four assignments
as Chief of Station. In each instance his. superior accomplish-
ments were marked by his broad area knowledge, initiative, drive
and imagination. His most recent assignment as Chief of a major
division is further evidence of his exceptional capability.

tribution to the mission of the Agency, reflecting great credit

uniqueness of his outstanding service. ‘ir. Phillips
has been highly effective as a senior member of the
Latin American Division which has been under his
immediate command since 1973. An excerpt fron a
late fitness report nicely characterizes the caliber
of his work. "It is as a senior operations officer
that ir. Phillips has had the greatest experience,
and it is not ‘surprising that he has made an excel~

matters throughout the many areas of this hemisphere
for which he is vesponsible." Mr, Phillips will be
renembered for his initiative, drive and imagination,

to his native charm, area knowledgeability and
superb language skills. le will be remembered for

Dear Dave,

You have just finished an important albeit-
grueling GS-16 Evaluation Exercise at my direction.
The recommendations for promction and executive
development. you gave me were a major factor in my
recommendations to the Director for the upward
movement of officers who will be the top management
cadre of the Directorate in the near future.

I believe you will find that the last several
weeks will have sharpened your focus on one of our
most important management responsibilities, our
personnel. Many thanks for a job well done.

SUBJECT: Letter of Appreciation

THRU: The Honorable W. Tapley Bennett
American Ambassador
Santo Domingo, Duminican.Republic

David 9 PHrciiPS

1, wish to express my sincere appreciation for the outstanding contributions
you and your staff have made in the accomplishment of USFORDOMREP Intelligence
missions from 1 May 1965 through 17 January 1966. The first intelligence contact
upon our arrival at bn 1 May was a representative from your
office. From that day on a mutual respect, cordial relationship and a unity of
effort prevailed throughout the many trying days in the Dominican Republic crisis.
Without your assistance we would have realized a serious gap in the intelligence
picture, a gap which would have made intelligence evaluations and the development

of tactical estimates most difficult,

2. My| _|has frequently mentioned the close association and coordination he
has had with you and the members‘of your organization and repeatedly expressed
the-high esteem and respect he has for the professionalism and competence
displayed by you and your subordinates.

3. The intelligence unity of effort in the Dominican Republic has been exemplary
and a prototype for future operations. This cohesive atmosphere is directly
attributable to your efferts.

4 March 1975

iseanee ON REQUEST FOR CREDITABLE SERVICE: August 1950 Until 3 March

1. .A basic document in consideration of this request is HCSA-825,
dated 4 February. 1954.

2. [was running an English-language newspaper
when: asked to work with our Statfon there. My first a was per
CS.
1063 asks that the first payment be made to the U.S.:bank on 1 August
3950.

3. During this period I recall a number of activities undertaken
” for the Station, and I’ travelled to New York for clandestine training.
The file indicates “He was originally approved operationally t? handle
the complex Soviet espionage case of FULMINATER-2. His conduct of this
case was considered -excellent...." Also, "It will be recalled that
Headquarters was very pleased with the printing job...which he had done.”
The latter was indicative of a number of such chores, when I stayed be-
hind in my plant after the employees had left for the night, printing
leaflets, booklets, etc. I also handled agents and did a number of

spotting and-assessing jobs for the Station.

4. I signed a new contract on 25 January 1952 for $500.00 per month
which ran until the termination date of 31 August 1953. (Actually this
was in the form of a loan which was paid off at the rate of $500.00. The
advance was used to purchase printing equipment which allowed me to do
certain work for the Station, but which [ retained.) ”

5. After termination of the contract on 31 August I remained in|
until 4 March 1964. Ourirg this period I recruited a CP agent who sti
works for the Station--and was a cabinet member under Allende. On 3 Febru-
ary 1954 Headquarters asked that I be made available for another assignment.
The Station pointed out that I was working on the recruitment, and that [
and my family were planning on-a European vacation. Headquarters again
requested my assignment. Thus | departed for the| project in
early March, abandoning my free family trip to Europe (tickets paid for
by advertising in'my paper} and leaving my family behind to pack up. I
accepted this assignment without knowing where it was, or for how long it
would last. Indeed | did not even have a contract.

Action Required: See Paragraph 9 et a1

_1. During his RVROCK career Michael C, CHOADEN has served
as Contract Agent, Covert Associate, Staff Agent and Contract
Employee, On one occasion CHOADEN resigned from RVROCK, became
a Contract Agent, then:returned as a Staff Employee, The purpose
of this dispatch is to request a review of exactly what CHOADEN's
status has been ovor the years, what must be done to repay retire=
‘ment funds ‘for any periods of creditable service not now covered,
and to study the possibility that sone periods of tenure might be
converted from uncreditable to creditable status.

2, CHOADEN served in the Air Forée from February 1943
through October 1945, with total service of two years, eight

months and 19 days,

3, The dates of CHOADEN's first RVROCK service jel ita
are very hazy to CHOADEN, He does recall that ho

“recruited by the COS, but cannot recall if this was on a formal,
salaried basis. At some time during 1950 or 1951, probably the
latter, CHOADEN signed an RVROCK contract, for at least two years,
possibly longer, - The-salary is remembered as US$500 per month,
and on Oné occasion this salary was paid in advance to allow
CHOADEN to purchase printing equipment. Please check the contract
covering this period and advise (a) the curation of the con-
tri and (b) if'any provision for deductions (or future payment
of) was made, If, as CHOADEN suspects, there were no deductions,
even for Social Security, CHOADEN would appreciate Headquarters
comment on the possibility that this period night be retroactively
converted to creditable service status (after payments into

retirement system, of course), In this connection it is suggested

th; ssioh might be held with James G, COLLETT; who yas COS
in ‘during most of that time, CHOADEN believes that
COLLETT will confirm that CHOADEN' demonstrated his intense interest
“in his RVROCK work by performing’ not only the work ealled for in
bis contract (mostiyscisnucotin. printing) but other chores as
well,..-Example: during this period, or perhaps jugtvafter the
expiration of CHOADEN's contract, CilOADEN, under Station ruidance
and instruction, approached and recruited a Communist Party ‘agent.
Cit -is understood that the agent is still reporting.) Another
_ example: in March 1954, COS COLLET ‘approached CHOADEN and asked
him 4f he. would accept the Headquarters! request that he leave.
board an airplane for tho-U.S, and assist in an unidentified
‘copgerarion which ‘would last-"some months." That ‘was the ‘extent of
‘the, offer. CHOADEN accepted, This was despite the fact that he
hid no“contract,and-tisit he had-to leave his family behind and to
abandon a-trip which -had been planned through Europe. It is
believed that this indicates that CHOADEN vas pretty mch “under
RVROCK control" during this period, (Porhaps training records
can assist in finding information on this | |period, as
CHOADEN went to New York on one occasion’ for a six-week training

course).

4. The noxt period of contract employment is also hazy, The

-“operation in’ which CHOADEN was. asked to participate turned out to
be PBSUCCESS, Some sort of contract was drawn up, but CHOADEN
“goes not recall if any deduction for retirement was mde, nor of
the terms of the contract, It is requested that this contract be
reviewed and, should there have beea no retirement credit, that
it too be reviewed for possible conversion to creditable service,
There is no question of CHOADEN "responding to RVROCK control"
during this period, It was full tiue work, and most of it per=
formed away from family---some of it in the jungle, About sixty
days, CHOADEN recalls, was spent cog, in Project
PBHISTORY, CHOADEN yas awarded an RYROCK Ylecoration for his work

during this period. ABROAD,

5, As. the result of his participation in PRSUCCESS, CHOADEN
was contracted as a Covert Associate from (about; this isa guess)
October, 1954 until April of 1955, CHOADEN distinctly recalls
that this contract called for rotirement credit if chosen as a
future option. (It is not impossible that this contract was made
retroactive to cover CHQADEN'S départure from lin March, 1954.)
Tt would be appreciated if/ __|would be advised of the exact dura-
tion and terms of: this contract. . :

6. CHOADEN was-a-Staff Enaployee from 1 April 1955 until
33 July of 1958, when he resigned, Retirement payments for this
period were returndd to CHOADEN, and he understands that they mst
be repaid Sometime before retirenent to make the period creditable,

7. After resigning in 1953 CHOADEN went to Cuba and witain a
week Signed d contract---as an independent operator and, to the
pest of CHOADEN's recollection, without any retirement benefits.
Again, it is requested that this contract be reviewed with the
view Of possible conversion to creditable status.

8, On March 14, 1960 CHOADEN again became a Staff Employee,
and has remained in that status. :
re with RVROCK CHOADSN now finds

that mich of his service is either not creditable, or is creditable

MEMORANDUM-FOR: Mr. Kermit Roosevelt

ATTENTION - ¢ Mr. John Baker

SUBJEGT : Mr. Paul D; Langevin; Employment as CLA
Staff Officer

1, To those of us at Headquarters who have followed closély the
work of Mr. Langevin in connection with PBSUCCESS, it is completely
evident that he made one of the major and most outstanding contributions
to this Operation and that he has demonstrated himself to be exceptionally’
qualified in'the field of political and psychological operations (covert).

“have just been informad by Messra, Barnes and Langevin that the latter
who has heretofore been employed in the capacity of a Contract Agent,
desires to become more closely associated with the Agency and would
like to be employed as a regular staff officer. lam very much in favor of
following up on this opportunity, and I have good reason to believe that
the Director likewise is specifically interested.

2. There are certain aspects of this case which appear to require
special handling and tailoring -- none of which presents any difficulties as
I see it -- but, on the contrary, would tie in very neatly with both the

near term and longer range aspects of the employment of Mr. Langevin,
These aspects are as follows:

(a) Mr. Langevin desires to begin his term of empluyment by

the Agency with a period of service at Headq: 5. (He has spent

many years in Latin America, principally lt eues he has

owned and still owns'a newspaper, and, in my judgment, it would be mutually *
advantageous to the Agency and to Mr. Langevin for him to spend

not less than a year as a member of the Headquarters organization. )

{b) Mr. Langevin has for some yeare in the past been giving an annual
series of lectures in various Latin American capitals. These lectures
have been arranged by an agent of his in New York and his audiences

have consisted of business and professional groups ond women's organ-
izations. The general subject matter of his lectures has included talks

on the threat of international Communism to Latin America, Mr. Langevin
would desire, if it can be worked out, to be permitted to continue to
delives lectures of this kind in the future and is at the present time


contemplating. a series of lectures oi Latin America to be ai en in various

Cities-within the United Stat

(c) Mi. Langevin would be ready and able to-accepi a field assignment
in South America following the conclusion of the period of Headquarters’

duty referred to,

3. As already indicated, it séems to-me that there are no serious :
problems involved‘in any-of the foregoing and that the material can be ©
readily cut to fit thé-pattern,. It is the recommendation of Mr. Barnes in
which I concur, that Mr. Langevin be assigned ta the PP Staff during his
tour of duty here. He could in this capacity work very closely with WH

‘Division, but it seems to Tracy.and myself thatvhe can contribute importantly

to the work of the PP Staff and in thé process broaden himself. As regards

the matter of the lectures, I'would recommend that arrangements be made
to‘permit and even encourage him to continue these since if seems to me

that they would fit-in very well with his general PP assignment -- assuming, of
course, that his Headquarters, and field cover are properly designed and mai
tained. The Headqiarters cover’problem is not a substantial one and as far.
as the field ia concerned if Mr. Langevin were to go under non-official cover
of the right kind this also should present no problem. There is a ready-
made cover in the field and in‘a critically important country by virtue of

his ownership -- for some six years -- of a newspaper i It

would not be incompatible with his resumption of his positron ag owner and
editor of the| newspapaer to work in an annua} series of lectures
cither in Lati erica or in the United States. There is only one further

poibt involved in connection with the lectures: Because of Mr. Langevin's
intimate association with many of the details of PBSUCCESS and also in
light of the standing rules of the Agency, it would be desirable for him to
submit at laast in general outlines, and preferably textually to the extent
feasible, the substance of his proposed lectures. He is anxious to do this
in’ connection with the forthcoming lectures -- for his own piece of mind
since he would like to be double-checked on.the things which he should say-
and those which he should not say with respect to the Guatemalan development.
He could and in the material to Mr. Holcomb or myself -- or to you -- and
after it has been checked over by one of us, we could arrange to submit it
to tne Office of Security for such further checking as may be desirable.

4, Mr, Langevin proposes to take a leave of absence of a month or
six weeks, starting within the next few days. 1 believe it would be
desirable for Mr. Baker, to start the necessary personnel and other admin-
istrative actions, including any additional security clearances which may



which may be neces:
for Mr.” Langevin to
leave. -
