take him to Paris for a“eW days, if he is willing. (ELM
MAGQ)should be useful for gleaning information from thé
Embassy types while in Paris.)

b. Jewelry Deal. According to AMWHIP/1, there have
not been any transactions since the initial ones of 300,000
and 10,500 in June 64, He had expected to receive a packet
of jewelry per month worth ca, B 00 dollars. A/1 also
wrote Some time ago (June 64) tO°QUNSNAFU/19, but has not re-.
ceived an answer to date. _ It is not known at this time
whether the lack of further jewelry packets is just poor
administrative procedures on the part of the Cubans, or
whether perhaps 4/1 is suspect for some reason by the Cubans,
This should be resolved when next A/1 meets wienbifis.

c. FAL Equipment 6 A/l stated that he felt one of the
first things (EL WAGOfwould ask him was about the FAL equip-
ment which AMLASH/1 Was requested, A/I was told that the
silencer for the FAL did not exist and that it probably was
not feasible to attempt to adapt a make-shift one, according
to weapon authorities, The matter of a telescopic sight was

not discussed. A/1 was told that spe! jal equipment for a
rifle such as the, FAL was difficult td procure as the
weapon was designed primarily as a general-purpose combat
weapon, not for special tasks. 'A/1 then asked about the
possjbility of purchasing a special weapon in Europe and
havélPL xico fake it-back with him, He was told that such
special rifles (probably for hunting big game) were un~
Sbubtedly available in Europe, but that this did not solve
the biggest problem of how to get it into AMLASH/1.

was told that such a gun_or any. part of it would undoubted=
ly be highly suspect if (EL_Maco tried to bring any such
items into Cuba, It is appare! Qehowever, that this topic
will continue to be one of concern to all persons connected
with the AMLASH/1 operation until it is resolved. Perhaps
the best bet would be to level with ‘AMLASH/1 at the next
meeting and tell him that such equipment will“not be forth-
coming from KUBARK or ODYOKE sources, together ‘with the

reasons why not.

a. “requisition of Cuban Pesos, A/1 stated that he had
called (Ricardo Son in ‘adelphia several times
(confirmed by telecons earlier between undersigned and A/L
(conriTyerk) but that in each case, the son had stated that
An Ney received no packages from his father from Mexico

te ng the latter's last time in that city, A/1 thought
during focd strange. The undersigned opined that pertaps
this inecificult to obtain pesos today due to the stringent
it was Gigontrols now in force in Cuba, We suggested to
SMWHIP/1 that he not pursue this problem with Gordy)
aMWiay over-zealous efforts on his part to obtain &
Sierescy might come, to the attention of the C

Of course, Hea dees produce the pesos at a later date
(with a0 additional; prompting from 4/1), they will be readily

accepted.

from intervegtttn up to
cession of V@NTUNA (AMWHIP commented that his business

along with those of most of his frsends suffered their
fate quite some time ago.)

f. Raymundo TORRES ("E1 Guagiro"). TORRES called
A/L £,_Reynundo eeyith a hessage TT co City with a message from ANLASH/1 for

A/1 (see below), At that time TORRES out from Cuba on

a trip, was staying at the Hotel Guardiola, Ave, Madero
and San Juan de Letran, phone 218580, Later he aoved to -
Hornes 74, Apt 304, Mexico, D.F. A/1 stated that TORRES
ues all right and apparently was trusted enough by AMLASH/1
to deliver an inocuous message and letter, the latter being
not so'harmless. A/1 stated that TORRES was given to
drinking and tock dope upon oceasion, (No identifiable
traces on TORRES).

g. AMLASH/1, LASH sent A/\ the accompanying letter.
mailed by TORRES from Mexico, The text is self-explanatory.
It has been decided that there would be too much room for
suspicion if KUBARK tried to have LASH invited to the cited
National assembly of Surgeons, A/1 has an acquaintance
with one Manuel RODRIGUEZ, who was in 1959 a medical student
and President of the Nexican F,E.U. He suggested that if
he could locate RODRIGUEZ, he might be able to have him
formally invite ANLASH to the Assembly, as the latter desires.
A/1 has not seen RODRIGUEZ (on whom there are no identi-
fiable traces) for about three years, but believes that
{here is no risk in atteripting to locate him and asking this
favor, It is perhaps worth the effort, although admittedly
it is a long shot, It should be noted that RODRIGUEZ'S
father 4s believed to be a communist, but that, according
to A/1, RODRIGUEZ is not. (This would adually not be a
problem, providing RODRIGUEZ believed that he was just doing
Prfavor for A/1 who desires to see hig, old friend LAS.)
