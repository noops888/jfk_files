This recoastruction of Agency involvezeat ia plans ~
assassinate Fidel Castro is at best an imperfect history. Because
of the extreze censitivity of the operations teing atacussea or
attezpted, as a retter o? principle no official recorés were kept
of planning, of approvals, or of suplenentatton. The fev written
records that do exist are efther largely tangential to the main
a "events or vere put oa paper. from mesory years aftervani, Willies
* a Harvey has retaized steletal notes of his activities durirg the +

years in question, and they are our best cource of dates. Dr.

Edvard Guan, of the Office of. Medical Services, has a record of q
vhon he net and vben acd czyptic references to the subjects discussed. 7

Ray Treichler, of TSP, bss a record of two or, three dates that ere
pertinent. Guna and Treichler vere involved in only the technical
aspects of operatiocal plerning, and their participations vere short :
lived. Although fragzentary, their reconis are a help in establishing : 4
critical tine frees. Operational files are useful in some instances, :

Depilatcry

Ray retenter recalls a schene involving thellim salts, a
chenlcal used by woven as a depilatory--the thought teing to destroy
Castro's izage as “Ite Beard” by causing the beard to ‘toa out.

The chemical may be administered either oraliy or ay absorption
, through the skin. The right dosage causes depitation; too much
produces paralysis. Treichler believes that the idea originated in
connection with a trip Castro was to have made outside of Cuba. The
idea was to dust thallium power Into Castro's ahces when they vere
put out at night to be shined. The schere progressed as far as
procuring the chemical and testing it on antuals. Sreichler's
recollection is that Castro did not make the intended trip, and
the ccheme fell through. Henry Bortner resenters consideration

: being given to use of thallium salts (perhaps against Castro) and

- ponething having to do with boots or shoes. Treichler does not

(Coment: By this tice Roselli had become certain that

O'Connell was an Agency employee, not a subordinate of Mateu.

Ee told O'Conne?! that he was sure that O'Connell was “a

governsent man = CIA” but tkat O'Connell should not coafirs

worth of comunicaticss equipmes*. Jae Ecverlice, who sigzed the

vouchers for the funds, recalls the acounts as being those stated

in the Office of Security nenoraxhn.
(Coment: As @ cldelisht, Esterlice says that, when he
learned of the intended use of Verora, steps vere taken to

cancel the plan. Varona was one of tt> five key figures in the

Revolutionary Frout ead vas heavily involved in support of the
approaching Bay of Pigs operation. If steps were in fact taken
to end Varona's participation in the syndicate plan, they weve
ineffective. It is clear that he contiaved es an integral part
of the syndicate schene.)

Woen the money vas ready, O'Connell took the pills from bis safe
and delivered them and the noney to Roselli. Roselli gave the pills
and the money to Varom, vies Roselli dealt with under psewtonyn.

z : Tittle is known of the delivery chamels beyond Varona- Varona was

- believed to have oh asset inside Cuba in a position to slip a pill
to Castro. Edvants recalls sorething ubout a contact vho worked in
a restaurant frequented by Castro an¢ vio was to receive the pills eat
put then into Castro's food or drink. Edverds believes that the

schene failed because Castro ceased to visit that particular restaurant.

operation, against Castro until I5 November 1961. Earvey has a note
that on that dace he discussed with Bissell the application of the
2RRIFLE program to Cuba. Harvey says that Bissell instructed him to
take over Edvards’ contact with the criminal syndicate and thereafter
to mm the operation against castro. Harvey adas that, as a completely

vas told by Helms that he vas to be placed in charge of the Agency's

McYarara raised the subject. Harvey's notes taken at the meeting
show that it vas also centioned by Murrov, but the nature of tke ‘

Earvey knew the truth. ie

b. If we ruled out Zarvey as the source, then it apzeared .
that there oust be at least tvo ulticate Zources of leaks. The
State Departzent meeting was not known to any of the other

that the leak on the State Departcent meeting bas come fro

c. From the standpoint of who-knev-wbat, the next most i
lixely source of the original leak {s John Roselli. He is, in _ oe
fact, the only person vith direct ané continuous participation
throughout both phases of the gambling syndicate operation. He
introduced Maheu to Sam Gfancena as the firot step in getting
