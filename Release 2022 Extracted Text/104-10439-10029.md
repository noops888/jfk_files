MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, CI Liaison
FROM : SR/CI/R

SUBJECT : “Questions Concerning Defectors
Joseph J. DUTKANICZ (201-289236) and
Vladimir 0, SLOBODA (201-287527)

1, DUTKANICZ's Army assignment at time of defection.

USAREUR Case Summary 2-62-2 (copy attached) confirms
DUTKANICZ's assignment to the 32nd Signal Battalion in Darmstadt.
However, his wife indicated that he had CIC connections, In an interview
at the American Embassy Moscow on 5 December 1961 (cited in DBA-288,

24 January 1962), she indicated that their trip behind the Iron Curtain “had
been made possible because her husband worked for the CIC and was.allowed
to do things the ordinary 'GI' could not do." There are also penciled no-
tations in the 201 file suggesting that his Army assignment may have included
intelligence functions of some kind,

2. Previous KGB connection of both defectors.

Per USAREUR Case Summary 2-62-2, DUTKANICZ himself
told American Embassy officials in Moscow that he had been approached by
KGB representatives.in a bar near Darmstadt in 1958 and had accepted
recruitment as a result of their threats and inducements. He claimed to
have given them minimum cooperation from then until his defection, although
the Army considered it probable that he had done more than he admitted. A
further indication of his KGB involvement before defection is the fact that the
special decree granting him Soviet citizenship was enacted three months before
his arrival in the USSR; see, Emb tel 851.

SLOBODA's prior KGB involvement was confirmed by BEVISION,
as reported in YT-1192. See attached memorandum of 28 March 1962 in
regard to passage of this information to the Army. Further indications are
the facts that SLOBODA was a KGB resettlement case and that he later told
an American Embassy Moscow official that he had been blackjmailed and
framed into going to the USSR. See Moscow Emb tels A-572, 23 October 1962
and 851, 23 March 1962,

3, Army security investigations as immediate cause of defection.

Per USAREUR Case Summary. 2-62-2, DUTKANICZ told American
Embassy Moscow officials that he had informed his KGB handler that he was
under investigation for security reasons. He defected soon after, in accord
with a KGB suggestion that he do so.

SLOBODA's defection was precipitated by increased Army
security measures, according to BEVISION.

Summary

Dutkanice clains ho was recruited by representatives of Scvict
intelligence in West Germany during 1958. A combination of throats and
inducements‘ were used to gain his cooperation. He admits having had
four meetings with hio Soviet handlera during a two-year period, but :
claims ho supplied only limited information to the KGB. There are, how~ i
ever, substantial indications that the compromise was greater. His A
espionagé activity was terminated by his defection to the USSR in June
1960, Ho was subsequently exploited for propaganda purposes by the
viets. Details of his complicity were obtained from statements made are

,after World War II. Ile was drafted into the US Army in 1951 and was a

Dutkanicz claims he was approached by. KGB personnel in 1958 while
drinking in a bar at Crumstadt, neur Jarmatadt. In the initial con- -
versation, a combination of threats and inducements were used’ to obtain
his promise of cooperation. The threats were mostly implied and
directed againct relatives in Poland, his immediate family in Vest
Germany and. atkanics personally. Inducements consisted of promises to

controlling agency was the KGB. He admits having four meetings with
the KGB representatives, who were allegedly from Vienna, Austria,
during the period 1958 to 1960. Re was furnished an accommodations
address which he no longer. remembers and was given secret writing
materials. He claims to have sent only four letters to the accomno-
dations address and he alleges to have furnished only negative
imminence reporta.

In May 1960 Dutkanicz informed his SIS handler that he was. being
investigated for security reasons and he was advised to apply for,
leave and defect with hic wife and family to the USSR via Austria and
Czechoslovakia. Dutkanicz complicd with the instructions.» Contact
with KGB representatives was established on 26 June 1960 in Bratislava,
Czechoslovakia, a short distance from Vienna. He and hia family then
drove to Lvov, USSR, with a Soviet cacort. He was subsequently :
exploited by the Soviets for propaganda purposes. The actual propaganda
material was propared by the KCB based on details furnished by
Dutkanicz.’ In Narch 1962 the Soviets permitted his wife to return to
the United States, but the children were retained in the USSR. Dutkanics
was allowed to accompany his wife to the US Embassy in Moscow for making
the necessary preparations for her return, During this period Dutkaricz
nade.a statement concerning his espionage activities in behalf of the
KGB.

USAREUR Comment q

Although Dutkanicz's confession was obtained under unusual circum-
stances, his atatements appear onbstantially true although obviously
incomplote. A strong possibility existe that ho worked for the KGB for
a longer period than he admits, and it in probable that Dutkanicz pro-
vided the KGB with considerably more information than negative imminence

sTeports. His statement that his SIS recruiters were from Vienna is

possibly correct and is supported by his alleged defection route. His
statement that he refused payment from the SIS seens unlikely, since he
reportedly was spending ccnaiderable amounts of money before his defection.
The case is of unusual significance since it constitutes one of the most
serious known penetrations of USAREUR forces by hostile intelligence.

Also important ie the fact that Dutkanicz's defection was apparently
instigated by the Soviets for propaganda purpuses after ho lost access

to sensitive information.

Additional reports will be prepared us information becomes available.

Army ‘was somewhat embarrassed about this case since SLOBODA had) 3.

"flunked or 5 LCFLUTTER examinations" before his defection, so
