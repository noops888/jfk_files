SUBJECT : Handling of AMMUG-I| Operation

L During a meeting with Mr. Hood, C/WH/Ops; Air. Cheever,
DC/\WH/SA and Mr, Swenson, C/WH/SA/CI on 23 Juve 1964,
Air. Swenson revewed the following points concerning the handling
of the AMMUG-] operation. These points were the subject of i
earlier discussions by A.r, Swenson and the various Branch chefs 1
an WH Division.

2. From the outset WH/SA/CI's proposed action for handlag A
AbiMUG-1 has been: ‘

a. To debrief AMi:UG-1 soonest and to get the information
to the appropriate country desks as soon as possible. To run
traces, including field traces, and to analyze the results, Tiaces
to be run by WH/sA/CI on Cupan Is staffers and by the WH country
desks on Cuban IS agents in their respective countries,

b.. To select the best targets froin the individuals identified
by AMNUG-1 and to hit them in order of priority, considering their
overall value, chance of success, accessability and perishability.
The selection of targets to be done jointly by WHySA/CI and the WH
desks,

(1) To give consideration to approaching the Cuban IS
agents before the Cuban Is staffers since the agents are leas likely
to know about AMA.UG-\'s defection and in wost cases they have a
greater communication proole:a in reporting back to the DG, (The
Cuban IS staifere known to ABLAIUG-I1 can not all be recalled or
transferred, and even if tranaferred could stil! te hit by AMAiUG-L )



vile

(4) To use AMB:UG-1 for making pitches to selected
targets, ayents first and stalfera second as explained above,

3aLito tho Canadians (RCP) who were very cooperative in

c provide the information acquired from debriefing
Iping us get AL:MUG-I1 and hie docun:ents out of Canada and ait

umted Statesl
0) To alaal s ay
(= Pprowpt thea: to take any action as we may wish, Yana
(2) To give pertinent information, oY

who can belp us in locating and n:onitoring targets.

d, Meanwhile, as in the AN:NIP-) case (another Cuban iS
dev¥ector who has provided us with consideraple information and
has-been used in a number of approaches), to disseminate appropriate
information to the U.S, intelligence community, In the case of
personalities, the CSCI dissemination would consiat only of biographic
and descriptive data furnished by AMALUG-1, inching apprupriate
Headquarters traces. We would request information from then, in
return, (Tais procedure ‘has. been used in the AMNIP-1 case. )

Ce

1, To work out in cooperation with the CI and CA staffs what
an be done in the event it o:ay be useful at son:e future date to
publicize AMMUG-I's defection by releasing certain information to
the press or by possibiy having bin. eppear before the Crganizatlon
of Au.erican States,

3. The above represents a general outline of what our overall
planning has been in connection with the Ai.\:UG-I case since we
brought hin to the United States, The role of WH/SA/Cl as I under-
stand it is to manage and coordinate the overall aspects af the
operation and to zee that no unilateral action 1s taken by any one
interested desk or office that may have dan.aging affects on other
aspects of the operation,
