He served as manager of this club for about four or five
weeks, until the club folded and went into bankruptcy. During
this period, SALLY BURNS contributed a total of approximately
$13,000 to the operation of the club and he, TONY, personally
contributed close to $30,000 which he had been able to

borrow from close friends,

While the club was in operation, BURNS gave the
indication that the {B,000,00 contribution was an investment
in this venture. However, when the club went into bankruptcy,
BURNS informed TONY that he was responsible for the $3000.00
as a personal loan from BURNS, Again, BURNS began demands: on
TONY not only for the $13,000.00, but for exhorbitarit interest

on this "loan" which, as of September, 1958, amounted
to a total of approximately $16,000.

Though BURNS took no active part in managing
this club, he was often there during the evening hours, as
were some of his underlings, specifically the individuals
referred to previously as BABE, CHICK and BUDDY, i

Part of the $13,000 contributed by BURNS was,
according to TONY, raised in the following manner:

At a particular time when TONY was having
difficulty making the Payroll, BURNS instructed him to
accompany JOE QUAGLIARELLO to New Jersey, where they were
to pick up $2500.00 from RAY (previously mentioned as having
been in the office of VITO GENOVESE on Thompson Street). TONY
accompanied QUAGLIARELLO to New Jersey to a roadside club :
where they met RAY, who turned over $2500.00 to QUAGLIARELLO,
The RAY referred to above, according to NY T-7% is ANGELO
DE CARLO, NY T-7 further advised the roadside club where
the meeting was held was the Martinique Restaurant, operated by

Following the closing of the Cafe De Paris,
TONY's only contacts with BURNS and his elemeat have been
at times when BURNS has demanded payment, plus interest,
on the $13900.00 he put into this club.

At one time, during early 1958, while TONY:
was with BURNS at a tavern in Atlantic Beach, Long Island,
New York, an individual identified by BURNS as Mr, JOHN
ORMENTO came over to their table and said "Hello" to BURNS
on his way out of the tavern. This appeared to be a chance
meeting and there was no discussion between BURNS and this
individual,

While in Havana, Cuba, on one of his visits to
GEORGE LEVINE, LEVINE introduced TONY to a casino manager
identified as JOE RIVERS, with whom LEVINE appeared to be
quite friendly.

NY T-7 was recontacted on October 15, 1958,
and advised that during one of TONY's visits to Havana, Cuba,
during 1957, previously discussed, TONY met an American named
LOWELL BIRRELL, who frequested the Oriental Park Racetrack -
near Havana, which was operated by GRANELLO and LEVINE. . The
informant related that BIRRELL was a New York City lawyer who
was in trouble with the United States Government in connection
with large scale stock manipulations and BIRRELL was reportedly
in Havana at the time to avoid investigation or prosecution
in connection with the matter.

The informant related that it was his impression
that BIRRELL seemed to be in close contact with the interests
of GRANELLO and LEVINE in Cuba. He stated that in relation to
the stock issued in the Orientel Park Racetrack in Havana,
originally the stock had been placed on the market at about
twenty cents per share and that during a comparatively short
time, the stock rose to around a $1.50 per share, The informant
stated that LEVINE. and GRANELLO were reported to have made a
"killing" on the ranipulation of this racetrack stodt. The
informant advised further tnat it would not be surprising if
BIRRELL had a hand in the above manipulation,
