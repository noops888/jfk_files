He served as manager of this club for about four or five

weeks, until the club folded and went into bankruptcy.

During

this perioa, SALLY BURNS contributed a total of approximately

$13,000 to the operation of the club and he, TONY, personally

contributed close to $30,000 which he had been able to

borrow from close friends.

While the club was in operation, BURNS gave the

indication that the #3,000.00 contribution was an investment

in this venture. However,

when the club went into bankruptcy,

BURNS informed TONY that he was responsible for the $13,000.00

as a personal loan from BURNS. Again, BURNS began demands

on

lONy not only for the $13,000.00, but for exhorbitant interest

on this

"Ioan" which, as of September, 1950, amounted

to a total of approximately $10,000.

Though BURNS took no active part in managing

this club, he was often there during the evening hours, as

were some

of his underlings, specifically the individuals

referred to previously as BABE, CHICK and BUDDY.

Part of the $13,000 contributed by BURNS was,

according to TONY, raised in the following manner:

At a particular time when TONY was having

difficulty making the payroll, BURNS instructed him to

accompany JOE QUAGLIARELLO to New Jersey, where they were

to pick up $2500.00 from RAY (previously mentioned as having

been in the office of VITO GENOVESE on Thompson Street). TONY

accompanied QUAGLIARELLO to New Jersey to a roadside club

they met RAY, who turned over $2500.00 to QUAGLIARELLO.

The RAY referred to above, according to NY T-7, 1s ANGELO

DE CARLO.

Following the closing of the Cafe De Paris,

TONY's only contacts with BURNS and his element have been

at times when BURNS has demanded payment, plus interest,

on the $13,000.00 he put into this club.

At one time, during early 1950, while TONY'

was with BURNs at a tavern in Atlantic Beach, Long Island,

New York, an Individual identified by BURNS as Mr. JOHN

meeting and there was no discussion between BURNS and this

individual.
