The Case Officer then started discussing the case of a Bulgarian,
GIORGIEV, who was arrested by the Bulgarians ‘in Moscow in 1963. SUBJECT
gees his information on this case from SHERAPIN, and Alexander PAPOVICH
in 1963. : : : i

SUBJECT said GIORGIEV was invited to Moscow in 1.963 at the suggestion
of the Bulgarian MVD. He.was settled in the Metropole Hotel and kept
under TV surveillance. While he was in-Moscow his rooms in Bulgaria
were searched and evidence was found (radio): which vas sufficient for
the Deputy Chief of the Bulgarian MVD. to go to Moscow, arrest him and
return him to Bulgaria for questioning and trial or’ court martéal.

SUBJECT went to Bulgaria in 1961 to help them on American cases.
He stated there was no suspicion of GIORGIEV-at. that time. GIORGIEV
had worked in the United States and was believed to have been recruited
at that time.

The. Bulgarians, on confronting GIORGIEV in the Metropole Hotel,
said, "George DUVAL, you're under arrest".

At. this point the interview ended and SUBJECT asked the Case Officer
to congratulate the boys and wish them all a good holiday for him. He -
did this when the Case Officer said he did not think he would be back

on 3 July.

Friday,.3,,July.196, - The Case Officer wanted to discuss the KGB
involvement in the OSWALD case.

- SUBJECT said he did not know that. OSWALD went to Moscow from Helsinki
‘but that OSWALD's visa application was processed’ in the normal manner
and KGB had a copy of the visa application. Russian Embassies, since
1960, have authority to issue visas in three to five days after application.

OSWALD applied orally, and later fin writing, for Soviet ‘citizenship.
A copy of the written request went to! KGB. A copy of this request was
sent to the Supreme Soviet after OSWALD slashed his wrists.

KGB studied reports on OSWALD prepared by Case Officer KRUZNOF and
decided OSWALD was not normal so he was of ‘no interest to KCB ‘and was
not considered desirable for Soviet citizenship. His file was’ sent to
Minsk because he was to live and work in Minsk.

The ‘American Embassy was not .informed of his suicide attempt because.
he was going to leave the country and he was not an_ important person:

While: OSWALD was in Minsk he received a stipend ‘from the Red Cross.

KGB had information on Marina OSWALD only afterishe announced her
intention to marry him. A record check, neighborhood, and employment
check on her showed that she was a simple, normal, iiot clever person,
and she was not in the Young Communist League becauge she did not pay
her dues. Some investigative reports said she was: stupid..

a

KGB. did- not consider using her in any capacity.

She has an uncle who is a Lieutenant Colonel in'the Minsk militia.

She must be illegitimate because she does not use or know her father's -
name. :

The only surveillance ever put on OSWALD was an agent and there was
never any on Marina.

After their marriage her pay was-increased to impress the. foreigner
she married.

She was not asked to stay in Russia after marriage because he was
to leave and Russians believe a husband and wife should be together
(unless one is a high level person).

Neither of the OSWALDs got any briefing or instructions before
leaving Moscow.

“et : ‘ In addition to KRUZNOF and Che SUBJECT, DUBAS .and MUSHKOV were
the KGB Agents in Moscow who knew of the OSWALD’ case before the
assassination. A Department Chief, JQMOKOV, and five other. KGB Case
Officers knew of the case after the adsassination.

KGB considered OSWALD an American citizen because he had been
denied Soviet citizenship.

KGB did not know any of OSWALD's personal contacts in Russia.

Some of the Intourist people OSWALD dealt with were KGB Agents 4

OSWALD's case was not the same as other Americans in Russia because
he was considered not normal-and he was not considered a defector as.
were MARTIN and MITCHELL.

i
4 SUBJECT. heard that OSWALD applied in Mexico fori return to Russia.

H Word went from Mexico to the First Main Directorate’ to the Second Main
Directorate. . Second Main Directorate told First Main Directorate that
he had tried suicide in Russia, married a Soviet citizen, departed Russia
and was considered not normal so the request should’ be rejected.

SUBJECT was'then shown some photographs and he said .he had seen a
picture of Marina OSWALD in a magazine. ~ ‘

A long list of names was read and shown to SUBJECT but he failed
to identify any of them. Many of the names were of people in Minsk.
