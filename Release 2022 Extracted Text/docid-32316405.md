In January 1958, Philadelphia Confidential Informant T-11

Southern District of New Yo:

This Grand Jury is investigating

On March 19, 1958, DAVE OSTICCO, a known racketeer,
was interviewed by SA FREDERICK T. HOULIHAN and he advised that he
went to the homé of JOSEPH BARBARA in Apalachin, N.¥., on November 1h,
1957, accompanied by ANGELO SCIANDRA.

Philadelphia Confidential Informant T-12 advised SA FRANK
W. MULDERIG on March 28, 1958, that he is convinced the purpose of the
meeting on November 1h, 1957, at the home of JOSEPH BARBARA was to
take control. of the women's garment industry. He said that LEONARD BLANDINA,
who is a partner of ANGELO SCIANDRA in the S and B Machine Company,
which is located in the plant owned by ANGELO SCIANDRA in Pittston,
Pa., told him that this was the purpose of the meeting and further that
on other occasions he heard NICK ALAIMO and SAMMY DI BELLA, associates
of RUSSELL BUFALINO, discussing the purpose of the meeting and they
too in their conversation said that was the purpose of the meeting.

T-12 said that the only one who told him directly the purpose
of the meeting was LEONARD BLANDINA but on three other occasions he
overheard conversations between ALAIMO and DI BELLA indicating the
above was the purpose of the meeting.

Themmeeting was to include jobbers, manufacturers, truckers,
and others who would have only a financial interest in the industry.
Tne meeting was for the purpose of deciding what preparation or what
interest or what phase of the operation each would have when they took
control of the industry. He said they intend eventually to put
pressure on buyers to force them to buy garments from their group.

7-12 said that SCIANDRA and his associates in the Pittston
area intended to completely dominate the area from Binghamton, N.Y.,
to Buffalo, N.Ye, since they had insurance they would have garment
trucking rates from that area to New York City guaranteed to them.
It was their intention to use the plant of SCIANDRA for cutting and
distribution and any garment manufacturer in New York would be forced
to operate from SCIANDRA's plant.
