INTERNAL SECURITY - CUBA

MM T-1, an experienced private and police in-

vestigator who continues to maintain contact with some

sources in Cuba, advised on February 25, 1965 that the

Cuban government maintains complete interception of mail

from foreign countries coming into Cuba. He stated that

as of that date and for at least three months past,

Cuban families

had been complaining that mail coming to

them from outside Cuba was being received in very poor

condition, it being clearly evident that the letters had

been opened and resealed.

The operation of opening and

resealing the mail had been done so clumsily in many cases

that the tampering was obvious.

The Cuban postal system uses two rubber stamps

to stamp envelopes which the censors practically destroy

in opening and resealing. These stamps read:

"RECIBIDO EN MAL ESTADO" (Received in poor con-

dition) and RECIBIDA CON EL, CIERRE ENCOMADO"

MM T-l furnished one such envelope sent to

him under a false name, with a

false name and return

address of a contact in Cuba. The flap had been almost

torn off the

envelope and the regluing was

completely

obvious. This envelope was stamped with both of the

above

rubber stamps.

MM To exhibited another such letter which

had obviously been opened and resealed, which had been

received by him on May 10, 1965.

G"2 REPRESSIVE MEASURES

MM I-I reported on May 5, 1965 that information

furnished by an ex-Cuban Navy Officer indicates that

there are persistent rumors that Major ERNESTO "CHE"

GUEVARA has been having difficulties with FIDEL CASTRO

since GUEVARA returned from his tour through Asiatic

countries. "CHE" GUEVARA was allegedly quoted by some

papers in Egypt wherein he stated bluntly that "some

costly errors had been made in Cuba." By implication

GUEVARA made it rather clear that he thought many of the

errors were made by CASTRO himself..

MM T-1 stated this, again, may be part of a

plan being, carried out by mutual agreement between

GUEVARA and CASTRO in order to trap some anti-regime

Cubans residing in Cuba, but nevertheless, GUEVARA has

not been attending some of the top meetings of the govern

ment and he was not at the airport to greet Major Raul.

CASTRO, and his wife VILMA ESPIN, when they returned from

their recent trip to the Soviet satellite nations.

SEcRET

As a result of these difficulties, and as a re-

sult of other evidence of opposition to FIDEL CASTRO,

the government is exercising stricter repressive measures.

CASTRO allegedly has a large number of loyal associates

infiltrated into Cuban missions abroad, as well as placed

in strategic branches throughout the Cuban government.

Allegedly this is not only to inform CASTRO of counter-

revolutionary movements, but also to inform him of the

movements and activities of such highly placed individuals

as "CHE"' GUEVARA.

The government has been in dire need of cane

cutters and in order to force many of the employees in

the cities to go out and cut cane, a number of the offices

of the different ministries. of government in Cuba closed

down entirely, including those in the Presidential Palace,

during Holy Week, 1965.

The employees were thus obliged

to go to the cane fields or be without work and subsequent

employment if they still refused to go. Propaganda was

even circulated by the Cuban government showing President

OSVALDO DORTICOS and Prime Minister FIDEL CASTRO cutting

cane.

MM T-2, another government agency which con

ducts intelligence type investigations, advised that un

confirmed information had been received indicating that

the Ministry of Construction (MICON) of the Cuban govern-.

ment is used as a cover for individuals in training for

sabotage and intelligence work.

BRAULIO MARTINEZ ALFONSO, a suspected Cuban

intelligence agent, is listed as being in the Dirreccion

de Coordinacion Tecnica (Directorate of Technical Co-

Ordination).

MM T-3, widely acquainted with various elements

of pro and anti-CASTRO sympathies, and who maintains

contact with numerous Cuban news media, advised on March

8, 1965 that he has noted over a period of time that

members from the Cuban Ministry of Construction are

frequently named as visitors, or students, in Russia

and Soviet satellite nations.

One such example was

NOVEDADES DE. MOSC. (News from Moscow, published in

Moscow, U.SoDoRo, February, 1965, which published the

following account:

OSCAR VALDIVIA, teacher in the School of Mechanics

Of MICON, and his comrades BENECIO FENAS and MANUEL

BENITEL, attended a course in the School of Mechanizers of

Glamosstroi.

They also visited firms in Moscow. They

spent a day at the factory and were shown how the various

elevators and other equipment were made.

MM T-3 advised on March 2, 1965, that many of

the vanguard workers, which are those with outstanding

amounts of overtime, are frequently individuals from

MICON. A Cuban radio, "Radio Progreso," announced on

February 25, 1965

that the brigade of electrical workers

in the central shops of the Vice Ministry of Equipment,

Ministry of Construction, was selected as the national

vanguard by the National Committee for Competition. The

brigade is composed of the following:

MM T-3 reported on March 5, 1965 that MICON

also sponsors boarding schools in the mountains of Cuba.

Those who attend must be closely affiliated with the

Partido Unido de la Revolucion Socialista de Cuba

(United Party of the Socialist Revolution of Cuba,

Cuban Communist Party, PURSC).

MM T-3 stated that HOY, Cuban daily newspaper,

self-described as the official organ of the Cuban Com

munist Party, announced on February 17, 1965 the opening

of such a boarding school in the mountains. The President

of the National Committee to Sponsor Schools held a

meeting concerning the opening of one such school "Conrado

Benitez," which will be located at Loma Blanca, Mayari,

Ariba, Cuba. Members of the MICON Committee sponsored

the school; they were Comrades JULIO DE LA PUENTE, MARIA

LEBREDO, MARIA ESTHER and the parents of Major CAMILO

CIENFUEGOS.

MM T-4,

for many years a member of Cuba's lead-

ing workers syndicate, and who maintains contact with

some Cuban sources, advised on May 7, 1965 that he had

received a letter from his father, indicating that his

father had been imprisoned for a considerable period of

time. The letter was written in double language and the

writer stated that an "indiscretion" on the part of a

fellow factory worker had almost cost his life. The

writer stated certain trinkets which had been left to

him had had to be disposed of as the Cuban G-? had made

a complete search of his house, but he had been advised

in time to get rid of the "jewelry."

MM T-4 stated the "jewelry" referred to a

number of pistols and ammunition which his father had

had hidden since MM To had left Cuba in 1960.

MM T-4

stated that since his father had never been molested

before by Cuban G2, it must be assumed that their re-

pressive and investigative activities have probably

increased rather than abated.

TAXI DRIVERS INFORMANTS OF G-2

On May 12, 1965, NARCISO HEBERTO JIMENEZ

GONZALEZ, a former employee of the Cuban Ministry of

Interior, who arrived by boat in the United States on

May 6, 1965, informed that he had not worked directly

for G-2, but had worked as an inspector in the Registry

of Foreigners, inspecting and collecting

dues from

foreigners residing in Las Villas Province. He covered

a number of small towns in the Province of Las Villas,

and among the towns were some ports.

When he visited a port because of the arrival

of some ship from a foreign country, he was given in-

structions not to pick up the passports

nor to give

shore leave passes to Russian crew members. This did

not mean tha Russians were not allowed to come ashore,

but on the contrary, indicated that there was absolutely

no control over them, and they could come ashore and

return to the boat as they wished, and no record was to

be made of the individual crew members having been in

Cuba. His instructions

were to pick up the passports

and issue

passes to all

other nationalities, including

Chinese.

He was summarily dismissed in September, 1964,

by letter stating that for the good of the service he

was being discharged from his position.

Members of (°2 known to him in Sancti Spiritus,

Las Villas, were the following:

The FiIst Chief of C-2 was AGUSIAN ROJAS.

The Second Chief was

RENE CARBALLO (OF CABALIO), and the

Third G-2 agent in charge was one JORGE SANCHEZ,.. whom

JIMENEZ GONZALEZ believes to be now employed

as an agent of the Cuban newspaper REVOLUCION.

He stated he did not know any of the individual

names of taxi drivers in sancti Spiritus, Santa Clara and

other cities in Las Villas, but he did know that practically

all of the taxi drivers were members and informants of the

Cuban G-2.

He stated one such individual known to him was

MEJO DIA?, a taxi driver in Sancti Spiritus, employed by

Go2, and a former member of the July 26th Movement some-

where in the United States.

The July 26th Movement is a revolutionary organ-

ization founded and led by FIDEL CASTRO, the pre-

sent Frime Minister of Cuba. It was dissolved

during late 196% wher it was absorbed into the

Integrated Revolutionary Organization In Cuba, along

with the Comminist Party of Cuba, and the other

principal political parties.

JIMENEZ GONZALEZ, who prior to the CASTRO revolu-

tion, worked as a salesman of pharmaceutical products,

stated that contrary to the propaganda being put out by

the Cuban government, conditions are not improving in

Cuba.

He stated there are no antibiotics or medicines

to compare in purity or effectiveness with those formerly

distributed in Cuba by him, specifically products of

Pfizer.

He stated his own mother had had to have an op-

eration, and the operation had to be performed without

previously taking x-rays, because there were absolutely

no x-ray plates available in Las Villas

• Province.

He stated all of the large choice lobster and

shrimp are shipped out of Cuba to France, and only small

trash fish are left for local consumption.

In addition to this, there are many unemployed

in Cuba and 21,000 members of the old Rebel Army are go-

ing to be replaced by the new recruits, and these former

members of the Rebel Army have very little to look for-

ward to.

He stated that in the opinion of many others

who desire to flee from Cuba, the above conditions tend

to provoke more and more discontent with the government

and as discontent grows, there are more and more leaks

to the Cuban government concerning the dangers of grow

ing resistence. This, in turn, produces more and more
