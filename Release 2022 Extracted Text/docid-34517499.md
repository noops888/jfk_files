MAIL CENSORSHIP ~

MM T-1, an experienced private and police in-
vestigator who continues to maintain contact with some
sources in Cuba, advised on February 25, 1965 that the
Cuban government maintains complete interception of mail
from foreign countries coming into Cuba. He stated that
as of that date and for at least three months past,
Cuban families had been complaining that mail coming to
them from outside Cuba was being received in very poor
condition, it being clearly evident that the letters had
been opened and resealed. The operation of opening and
resealing the mail had been done so clumsily in many cases
that the tampering was obvicus.

The Cuban postal system uses two rubber stamps
to stamp envelopes which the censors practically destroy
in opening and resealing. These stamps read:

“RECIBIDO EN MAL ESTADO" (Received in poor con-

dition) and RECIBIDA CON EL CIERRE ENGOMADO" TSW

(Received with the flap reglued.) :

MM T-1 furnished one such envelope sent to
him under a false name, with a false name and return
address of a contact in Cuba. The flap had been almost
torn off the envelope and the regluing was completely
obvious. This envelope was stamped with both of the
above rubber stamps.

MM T-1 exhibited another such letter which
had obviously been opened and resealed, which had been
received by him on May 10, 1965.

G=2 REPRESSIVE MEASURES

MM T-1 reported on May 5, 1965 that information
furnished by an ex-Cuban Navy Officer indicates that
there are persistent rumors that Major ERNESTO ''CHE"
GUEVARA has been having difficulties with FIDEL CASTRO
since GUEVARA returned from his tour through Asiatic
countries, "CHE" GUEVARA was allegedly quoted by some
papers in Egypt wherein he stated bluntly that ''some
costly errors had been made in Cuba." By implication
GUEVARA made it rather clear that he thought many of the
errors were made by CASTRO himself. .

MM T-1 stated this, again, may be part of a
plan being, carried out by mutual agreement between
GUEVARA and CASTRO in order to trap some anti-regime
Cubans residing in Cuba, but nevertheless, GUEVARA has
not been attending some of the top meetings of the govern-
ment and he was not at the airport to greet Major RAUL
CASTRO, and his wife VILMA ESPIN, when they returned from
their recent trip to the Ssvtet-satellite nations.

“SReRET-

AS a result of these difficulties, and as a re-
sult of other evidence of opposition to FIDEL CASTRO,
the government is exercising stricter repressive measures.
CASTRO allegedly has a large number of loyal associates
infiltrated into Cuban missions abroad, as well as placed
in strategic branches throughout the Cuban government.
Allegedly this is not only to inform CASTRO of counter-
revolutionary movements, but also to inform him of the
movements and activities of such highly placed individuals
as "CHE" GUEVARA.

The government has been in dire need of cane
cutters and in order to force many of the employees in
the cities to go out and cut cane, a number of the offices
of the different ministries..of government: in~Cuba :closed
down entirely, including those in the Presidential Palace,
during Holy Week, 1965. The employees were thus obliged
to go to the cane fields or be without work and subsequent
employment if they still refused to go. Propaganda was
even circulated by the Cuban government showing President

pide:
cane.

MM T-2, ancther government agency which con-
ducts intelligence type investigations, advised that un-
confirmed information had been received indicating that
the Ministry of Construction (MICON) ef the Cuban govern-
ment is used as a cover for individuals in training for
sabotage and intelligence work.

Ordination).

MM T-3, widely acquainted with various elements
of pro and anti-CASTRO sympathies, and who maintains
contact with numerous Cuban news media, advised on March
8, 1965 that he has noted over a period of time that
members from the Cuban Ministry of Construction are
frequently named as visitors, or students, in Russia
and Soviet satellite nations. Ome such example was
NOVEDADES DE MOSC.U (News from Moscow), published in
Moscow, U.S.S.R., February, 1965, which published the
following account:

OSCAR VALDIVIA, teacher in the School of Mechanics
of MICON, and his comrades BENECLO FENAS and MANUEL
BENITEZ, attended a course in the School of Méchamizers of
Glavmosstroi. They also visited firms in Moscow. They
spent a day at the factory and were shown how the various
elevators and other equipment were made.

MM T-3 advised on March 2, 1965, that many of
the vanguard workers,which are those with outstanding
amounts of overtime, are frequently individuals from
MICON. A Cuban radio, "Radio Progreso," announced on
February 25, 1965 that the brigade of electrical workers
in the central shops of the Vice Ministry of Equipment,
Ministry of Construction, was selected as the national
vanguard by the National Committee for Competition. The
brigade is composed of the following:

MM T-3 reported on March 5, 1965 that MICON
also sponsors boarding schools in the mountains of Cuba.
Those who attend must be closely affiliated with the
Partido Unido de la Revolucion Socialista de Cuba,
(United Party of the Socialist Révo “cuba; ~

Cuban Communist Party, PURSC). = > ----~

MM T-3 stated that HOY, Cuban daily newspaper,
self-described as the official organ of the Cuban Com-
munist Party, announced on February 17, 1965 the opening
of such a boarding school in the mountains. The President
of the National Committee to Sponsor Schools held a
meeting concerning the opening of one such school "Conrado
Benitez," which will be located at Loma Blanca, Mayari,
Ariba, Cuba. Members of the MICON Committee sponsored
the school; they were Comrades JULIO DE LA PUENTE, MARIA
LEBREDO, MARIA ESTHER and the parents of Major CAMILO—

MM T-4, “for many years a member of Cuba's lead-
ing workers syndicate, and who maintains contact with
some Cuban sources, advised on May 7, 1965 that he had
received a letter from his father, indicating that his
father had been imprisoned for a considerable period of
time. The letter was written in double language and the

writer stated that an "indiscretion" on the part of a
fellow factory worker had almost cost his life. The
writer stated certain trinkets which had been left to
him had had to be disposed of as the Cuban G2 had made
a complete search of his house, but he had been advised
in time to get rid of the "jewelry."

MM T-4 stated the "jewelry" referred to a
number of pistols and ammunition which his father had
had hidden since MM T-4 had left Cuba in 1960. MM T-4
stated that since his father had never been molested
before by Cuban G-2, it must be assumed that their re-
pressive and investigative activities have probably
increased rather than abated.

TAXI DRIVERS INFORMANTS OF G=2

On May 12, 1965, NARCISO HEBERTO JIMENEZ

GONZALEZ, a former employee of the Cuban Ministry of
Interior, who arrived by boat in the United States on
May 6, 1965, informed that he had not worked directly
for G-2, but had worked as an inspector in the Registry
of Foreigners, inspecting and collecting dues from
foreigners residing in Las Villas Province. He covered
a number of small towns in the Province of Las Villas,
and among the towns were some ports.

When he visited a port because of the arrival
of some ship from a foreign country, he was given in-
structions not to. pick up the passports nor to give
Shore leave passes to Russian crew members. This did
not mean tha Russians were not allowed to come ashore,
but on the contrary, indicated that there was absolutely
no control over them, and they could come ashore and

return to the boat as they wished, and no record was to
be made of the individual crew members having been in
Cuba, His instructions were to pick up the passperts
and issue passes to ali other nationalities, including
Chinese.

He was summarily dismissed in September, 1964,
by letter stating that for the good of the service he
was being discharged from his position.

Members of G-2 known to him in Sancti Spiritus,
Las Villas, were the following:

The First Chief of G-2 was_AGUSTIN ROJAS.

The Second Chief was RENE CARBALLO (or CABALLO), and the

Third G-2 agent in charge waS one JORGE SANCHEZ, whom
JIMENEZ GONZALEZ believes to be now employed

as an agent of the Cuban newspaper REVOLUCION.

‘ He stated he did not know any of the individual
names of taxi drivers in Sancti Spiritus, Santa Clara and
other cities in Las Villas, but he did know that practically
all of the taxi drivers were members and informants of the
Cuban G-2. :

He stated one such individual known to him was

taxi driver in Sancti Spiritus, employed by

MEJO_DIAZ, a
G-2, and a former member of the July 26th Movement some-
where in the United States.

The July, 26th Movement is a revolutionary organ-

ization founded and led by FIDEL CASTRO, the pre-
sent Prime Minister of Guba. It was dissolved

during late 1962 when it was absorbed into the
Integrated Revolutionary Organization in Cuba, along
with the Communist Party of Cuba, and the other
principal political parties.

JIMENEZ GONZALEZ, who prior to the CASTRO revolu-
tion, worked as a salesman of pharmaceutical products,
stated that contrary to the propaganda being put out by
the Cuban government, conditions are not improving in
Cuba. He stated there are no antibiotics or medicines
to compare in purity or effectiveness with those formerly
distributed in Cuba by him, specifically products of
Pfizer. He stated his own mother had had to have an op-
eration, and the operation had tec be performed without
previously taking x-rays, because there were absolutely
no x-ray plates available in Las Villas Province.

He stated all of the large choice lobster and
shrimp are shipped out of Cuba to France, and only small
trash fish are left for local consumption.

In addition to this, there are many unemployed
in Cuba and 21,000 members of the old Rebel Army are go-
ing to be replaced by the new recruits, and these former
members of the Rebel Army have very little to look for=
ward to.

He stated that in the opinion of many others
who desire to;flee from Cuba, the above conditions tend
to provoke more and more discontent with the government:
and as discontent grows, there are more and more leaks
to the Cuban government concerning the dangers of grow-
ing resistence. This, in turn, produces more and more
