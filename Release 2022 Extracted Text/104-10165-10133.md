POLITICAL NOTES:

qhe mission of Jed Tean MARK was not political. However, in -
France it is impossible to aisassociate politics rrom the militery,

1. There is no political union in France.
“2, Most Comite de Liberation formed, are socialist end communist.

8. Under pressure of the CDL the FYI has, in many places, given’ ”
way to the FIPF. i :

4. The Movement de Liberation National is trying to wiite with :
the Front Neatioual; both keezing their sharters and working bate .

France. Reasons a : 7
