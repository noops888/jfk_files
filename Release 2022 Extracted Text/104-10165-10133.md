GENERAL REMARKS

This man shows complete lack of any

leadership qualifications

and it is extremely

doubtful whether he would develop any cring

training.

His experience in the French Ar

and in France after the fall, as well as his

French background, should be used in some

capacity and it is suggested, therefore, that he

would be more silted as a suborâinate member of

& coup-de-main party.
