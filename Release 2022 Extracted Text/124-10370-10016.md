Memorandum to Mr. T. W. Leavitt

Re: Ilona Marita Lorenz

The attached newspaper stories alleged that "Alex

Rorke, a wealthy adventurer who worked for both CIA and the

FBI" was involved with Frank Fiorini, a "CIA Agent;' who recruited

the subject in an assassination plot

against Castro.

Alexander I. Rorke is a former FBI clerical employee who, during

• the time of the alleged plot in 1960, was a free lunce

photographer. He had been temporarily detained by the Cuban

Government in 1959 and for many years was active in anti-Castro

activities in the Florida area.

From time to time he contacted

the FBI and was dealt with at

arms length because of his

adventurer, personality and self-serving motives. He disappeared

on a plane flight in 1963 to Central America.

Frank Fiorini

also known as Frank Anthony Sturgis was well known to the FBI

for his anti-Castro activities in the U.S. following his:

defection from Cuba in 1958. He was also one of

the Watergate

breakin subjects.

Additional information in FBI files indicates that the

subject also furnished information concerning the July 26th

Movement in the U.S. This group was the original political and

military organization which Castro used to overthrow the Batista

Regime in Cuba.

The subject was also interviewed in 1962 in

Florida regarding a White Slavery Traffic Act (WSTA) case and

admitted being the mistress of Marcos Perez Jimenez, Tormer

Investigation

talled to establish the subject was.

a victim in the above mentioned

WSTA case.

The subject is the present wife of NY 7511-IA who

furnishes

information on

*Soviet and Soviet-bloc matters she

is

aware of her husbands cooperation with the New York Office and &

has, on occasion, volunteered information of value.

The subject

is presently separated from her husband and in April, 1976, the

New York Office opened a potential criminal informant file on her

because of her contacts with a New York 'area crime figure,

Guiseppe Faggiano and a race horse trainer.

She furnished

information regarding gambling, shylocking and bank robbery matters.

However,

because of the recent publicity set out in the attached

newspaper clippings, the fact that she is planning to write a book

concerning her Cuban experiences and the fact that she terminated

her contact with criminal elements,her case was closed by the.

New York Office.
