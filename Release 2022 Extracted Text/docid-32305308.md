the plane contained the numerals 37 or 47.

Mrs. GUTIERREZ stated she was aware of the

captured in Oriente Province, Cuba. She stated that
although she knew several members of the MIRR and had
heard the names of others mentioned in conversation at

Miami.

advised on November 26, 1966 that his firm was in the
