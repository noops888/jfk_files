cautious in his phone call, in that he would not name

Gray requested Wer Bell to furnish this information to

NY T-l stated that Masferrer requested

that CBSo pay up the notes due on this boat and make this

boat available for Masferrer's plans to invade Haiti.

stated that CBS

declined to make any payment and refused

to get involved in this matter.

NY T-1 further identified Richard Harvey, mentioned

above,

as the owner of a chain of hot dog stands in Florida

called "Poor Richard's

NY T-1 also advisea on Octöber i3, 1966, that he

was very skeptical of the completion of Masferrer's plans

to invade Haiti. NY T-l stated it was his personal belief

that there would be no invasion of Haiti as Masferrer lacks

the necessary transportation and most important, the necessary

funds. NY T-l stated that it was his conviction that in

order to successfully invade Haiti the mininum sum required

for such

an operation would be $50,000. NY I-I stated that

Masferrer and his associates do not have this amount of money

nor do they have sources to whom they can go to to get it.

NY T-I stated that he was also concernea about this

alleged invasion of Haiti due to the activities of Mitchell

Wer Bell.

NY T-I stated that Wer Bell is a very heavy drinker

and when he gets drunk he becomes an obnoxious individual and

already que to his heavy drinking there have been several

Tights

and nisunderstandings between Wer Bell and Masferrer.

NY I-I also said that closely connected with Mitchell

Wer Bell is one Ralph Serrano (Phonetic) who is a Dominican

residing in Miami Beach who goes under

the name of Bill Baird

(Proacule) when he is in the miami area. NY I-I stated that

Serrano is always short of funds and he would not be above

selling information concerningMasferrer's activities and

plans to the Haitian Government representatives in the

United States.

NY T-I stated that another indiviqual closely

connected vith Wer Bell is an American whom he knows only

by the name Chet Gray. NY I-l stated that he has seen Gray

in Miami on two occasions and has seen him once in New York.

Ny T-l stated that it was his impression that Gray may be

working for the Haitian Government supplyinginfornation to

Haiti.

NY T-I advised on October I3, 1966, that CBS conducted

interviews in New York of Haitian exiles which would be used

by CBS in its projected film of an invasion of Haiti. NY I-I

stated thoseinterviewed in New York were General Leon Cantave

and Louis

Justin Elie on one occasion, and on another occasion,

Father Jean Baptiste Georges and his military leader, Colonel

Rene Leon.

NY T-1 stated that CBS has completed as much. of

theix film work as they can and that all the film which has

been completed is being maintained by CBS in their film

library for future use in the event there is an invasion

of Haiti and an overthrow of the lovernment of President

Francois Duvalier.

It was previously réported on September 7, 1966, that

an informant advised that ROLANDO ARCADIO MASFERRER ROJAS,

former Cuban Senator

and notorious Cuban exile currently

residing in the New Yock area, had been recently in the Miami

area and had been cooperating with the Columbia Broadcasting

System (CBS) in filming à documentary relative to a possible

film was in two ports, the first of maich had been already

and the second was to record the transter or weapons

from the Miami ares by boat to y larger ship at sex for delivery

to the Dominican Republic and then to a base in the Dominican

Republic from which the invasion against haiti would be

reportedly launched.

It was reported that a key member of

this plan was MITCHELL WER BELL, Ill, from Atlanta, Georgi,

whose importance to this operation stenned fron his high

contacts in the Dominican Repablic.

WER BEll was to make

trip to the Dominican Republic in Septeuber, 1956, in order to

talk with Commodore (first name unknown) JIVENEZ Of the Dominican

Navy, who, VER BElL indicated, was a "close friend" and had

offered facilities to WEE BELt for the proposed invasion of

Haiti.

It was also reported that WER BeLL stated this invasion

of Haiti had been discussed with President JOAQUIN BALAGER OL

the Dominican Republic and that BALaQUEe was "willing to aasist."

It was reported that WER BELt was the key man in this entire

operation because if he failed to obtain the necessary Lacillties

in the Dominican Republic through Commodore JIMENEL, the whole

plan of MASFERRER would be terminated.

COBOS:

COBOS has advised that MITCHELL HER BEL haS nO

important contacts in the Dominican Republic and 15 not

personally acquainted with Commodore RAMON EMILIO JIMENEZ, Chiet

the Dominican Navy, who is a close friend of COBOS.

WER BELS,

in fact, was recently declared persons non grata in the Doninican

Republic and was refused a visa to enter the Dominican Republic

in September, 1966. WER BEL is depending solely on COBOS as

and the matter has not yet been broached with Commodore FIMENEZ,

21though COBOS made two tripo to the Dominican Republic in

August and September, 1965, In WEN BEL's behalf, during one

which COBOS held a thirty minute personal conversation with

President BALAGUER.

These trips concerned only WER BEL's efforts

to establish a factory in the Dominican Republic for the manu

lacture of a hand weapon known as the Gyrojet Rocket Hand Gua

developed by M B Associates, San Panon, California, for which

WER BEL bolds the Latin American franchise.

COBOS' discussion with President BALAGUER waS contined

to the possibility of establishing such an enterprise in the

Dominican Republic and no mention was made of MASFERRER Or

his proposed invasion of Haiti.

COBOS is certain that President

BALAGUER has not been contacted regarding this matter and that

he would never entertain the idea of using the Dominican Republic

as a base for invasion of another Latiu Anerican country during

these initial and trying

stages of his new government.

According to information furnished to Mi I-I by COBOS,

COBOS was in personal contact with WER BEL on September 8 and 9,

at which time WER BEL stated the second phase of this plan

106o the invasion of haiti would be begun during the followins

week in Miami.

INTERNAL SECURITY - DOMINICAN REPUBLIC

On September 5g 1966, MM T-I, who is described

as a close associate of RICARDO ADOLIS COBOS Y RICARDO,

Cuban exile currently residing in Miami, Florida, furnished

the following information:

COBOS has been recently engaged in a business

venture in the Dominican Republic with MITCHELL L• WER BEL, III.

also known as Alex Wilson, Powder Springs, Georgia, an

American adventurer who has long been interested in Latin®

American affairs. WER BEL Is employed by Point-O-Sale,

InC os

Powder Springs, Georgia, and holds

the Latin American

franchise for sale of a hand weapon known as the Gyrojet

Rocket Handgun, manufactured by MBA Assoclates, San Ramon,

California.

In July, 1966, in an attempt to interest the

Dominican military in the purchase of this weapon, WER BEL

commissioned COBOS, who is well acquainted with key Dominican

military officers,

to travel with him to the Dominican

Republic to introduce him to these officers anô to act as

his interpreter; since WER BEL's knowledge of Spanish is

limited. Also scheduled to make this trip was a wealthy

friend of WER BEL'S, DI. LAWRENCE MITCHElL, a veterinarian

from Atlanta, Georgia, with interests in the Dominican

Republic, who planned

to attempt to sell some chemical

DOMINICAN SITUATION

COBOS,

COBOS traveled to the Dominican Republic on

July 20,

1966, and returned to Miami,

Florida, on

August 14, 1966. His airplane ticket, and presumably

his expenses, were paid by WER BEl. COBOS traveled

alone inasmuch as WER BEI and Dr. MITCHELL had not been

successful in obtaining visas to enter the Dominican

Republic.

*.

Upon arriving in the Diminican Republic,

COBOS contacted Commodore RAMON MILIO JIMENEZ, Chief of

Staff of the Dominican Navy, and receivea permission to

enter

the Hainai Naval Base

to inventory equipment which

originally belonged to the anti-CASTRo organization, the

Junta Revolucionaria (JURE), when this organization

had a

base in the Dominican Republic.

Responsibility for these

arms had rested with JOSE RABEL, former Captain of the

JURE boat,

"Venus"

, until RABEL was captured in an attempt

infiltrate into Cuba.

Thereafter, COBOS was technically

responsible for this equipment.

His apparent purpose in

conducting this inventory was to assure himself the arms

were still being held intact by the Dominican military.

COBOS indicated to MM T-I that this inventory

determined that this equipment consisted of.50 caliber

machine guns, a recoilless cannon, numérous small arms;

and

ammunition, estimated value $8,000.00 to $10,000.00.

COBOS subsequently determined that MITCHELL

WER BEL would not join him in the Dominican Republic

inasmuch

as he haa been refused a visa, this refusal

being based, in part, on a complaint by

one STEPHANY,

omer of a small shipping company nich operates boats

between Miami and Santo Domingo,

the nature of the complaint

decision was the fact that wER BEL when previously in the

Dominican Republic was

somehow involved in an automobile

accident in which a small boy was injured. Additionally,

WER BEL had previously given a bad check in the amount of

$5,000.00 €0 FRANK BERMUDEZ, Dominican millionaire and

President of J. Armando Bermudez Company, a rum distillery,

although COBOS indicated to the source that this check was

still being held by BERMUDEZ and had not been reported to

the Dominican authorities.

Through contact with Commodore JIMENEZ, COBOS

was

successiul in having this restriction removed and having

a visa issued for WER BEL to enter the Dominican Republic

for the purpose of conducting business there.

After having

the way paved by a telephone call from Commodore JIMENEZ,

COBOS personally contacted Mr. BOBADILTA, head of the

Dominican Visa Office, and had WER BEL's visa application

and had To Bet ve

approved and mailed to the Dominican Consulate in Miami.

DI. LAWRENCE MITCHELL arrived in the Dominican

Republic on

August 4, 1966, and joined COBOS.

On August 6,

1966, COBOS

and Dr.

MITCHELL traveled to Santlago where they

met a business associate of MITCHELL'S named EDMUNDO VALIE.

MITCHELL and VALLE had been in the banana business but were

planning to attempt to develop a peanut oil refinery in

Santiago. MITCHELL and COBOS spent the day examining an

ofl refinery that MITCHELI expects

to lease for this business

venture.

On the following day, MITCHELL and COBOS visited

FRANK BERMUDEZ, previously describea, whom COBOS describec

to MM T-l as a

long-time friend. BERMUDEZ discussed several

business propositions with COBOS, including the possiblity

that he would purchase a farm for COBOS to operate and also

the possibility that he would purchase the "Venus" which

would be outfittea for commercial use by COBoS.

COBOS subsequently Introduced MITCHELL to Commodore

JIMENEZ,

and at this time advised JIMENEZ that JOSE RABEL had

borrowed $11,000.00 from Dr. MITCHELL which he had used to

repair the "venus",

, purchase arms and™

gasoline. RABEL, had

not repaid this money when he was captured in Cuba, and COBOS

reportedly advised the Commodore he was relinquishing control

of these arms to Dr. MITCHELL in order to satisfy this

obligation on

i the part of RABEL.

GOBOS did not indicate to

the source that he was aware of

any agreement reached by Dr.

MITCHELL and Commodore JIMENEZ as to disposition of these

arms other chan that Dr. MITCHELL indicated he was not

interested in physical possession of the arms but only wanted

to sell them to recover his money.

Following COBOS' return to Miami, Florida, he was

commissioned by the American Engineering and Supply Company,

Miami,

to again travel to the Dominican Republic in an

attempt to promote business with the Dominican Government.

This company formerly supplied uniforms and equipment,

except firearms.

to the Dominican Navy.

Although COBOS

was noi paid for these services,

the company offered to

furnish his

round-trip transportation and agreed to give

him a percentage of all business he developed in the

Dominican Republic.

COBOS also indicated he planned to take advantage

of this opportunity to assist MITCHELL, WER BEL In establishing

a business there asiwell as to obtain a factory site for the

production of the Gyrojet Rocket Handgun.

COBOS departed

Miami for Santo Domingo on August 29, 1966, and returned to

Miami on September 3, 1966.

COBOS then contacted General DE LOS SANTOS

CESPEDES, former Chief of the Dominican Air Force, regarding

the Gyrojet Rocket Handgun and through him was placed in

contact with EMILIO PEREZ Y PEREZ, Dominican Minister of

the Armed

Forces.

PEREZ Y PErEZ contacted President

JOAQUIN BALAGUER, who indicated interest in the weapon

and its production in the Dominican Republic. At President

BALAGUER's request,

COBOS went to his office

and discussed

the matter with him.

President BALAGUER requested samples

of the gun and was told that COBOS did not bring

samples

because of the restrictions by Dominican customs.

President

BALAGUER instructed COBOS on his next trip to the Dominican

Republic to bring samples of this weapon appropriately

wrapped and labeled, and to telephone from Miami prior to

his departing in order that General DE LOS SANTOS CESPEDES

could meet him at the airport and escort him through customs:

President BALAGUER stated he would be interested

in the establishment of such a factory within the Dominican

He was told

On July 6, 1966, WE T-l furnished the following

information

A Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) team con-

sisting of Mr. Andrewist. George, scriptman; Mr. Robert

Funk, soundman; Mr. James Wilson, cameraman; and Mi. Jay

Mc Mullen, film editor, were in the Coral Gables, Florida,

area during June, 1966, for the purpose of filming a

documentary concerning

the collection and shipment of arms

from the United States destined for Haitian rebel forces,

outside the United States.

The source advised that Mc. Mullen was in contact

with Haitian exiles in the New. York City area approximately

four weeks ago.

Mc Mullen was advised that a Mr. Alex

Wilson of Atlanta, Georgia; could be located in the Coral

Gables area as

the custodian of an arms and munitions cache.

Mc Mullen traveled to the Atlanta, Georgia, area and met

Alex Wilson, who resides on an 85 acre farm outside of Atlanta,

Georgia. Mc Mullen advised that Wilson maintained a cache

of arms in the basement of his house. Mc Mullen described

the storage basement area as a walk-in pantry janmed with

weapons:

Mc Mullen advised other members of the above

described CBS team (in Coral Gables, Florida) that a

sampling of these weapons were test

fired to show they

were operational.

and destination of these weapons. Mc Mullen then organized

the above CBS team and instructed they should come to the

Miami, Florida, area.

James Wilson arrived July 22, 1966,

and Robert Funk arrived in Miami on Wednesday July 24, 1966,

with necessary film and sound equipment and registered under

their true names at the International Airport Hotel, Miami,

Florida. Me Mullen arrived on Friday, July 24, 1966, from

New York City and was met at the Miami airport by Andrew

St. George

On June 24, 1966, Mc Mullen briefed this CBS

team, and to insure their security instructed the CBS team

to move to the Key Biscayne Hotel, Key Biscayne, Miami,

Florida.

This move was accomplished during the late after-

noon of June 24, 1966, and this CBS team registered under

their true names. During the briefing on June 24, 1966,

Me Mullen explained they were to film a documentary for

CBS concerning a cache of weapons in the Coral Gables area

which were parcelled out to various collection houses, theie-

after, centrally gathered in a "safe house," where they

were to be reloaded for transport by small boat to a "mother

ship' off the coast of Florida. Mc Mullen indicated the

final destination of these weapons was their delivery to

rebel forces in Haiti to be used within a three month period

to overthrow the government of President Duvalier of Haiti.

It was further indicated that the filming would be in two

parts.

The first would include filming of the storage and

transport of the cache from Coral Gables to the "mother ship"'

The second portion would include transport by the "mother

ship' to a naval base in the Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic,

area, and thereafter reloading on small boats for transfer

and delivery to Haitian rebel forces.

It was thought by

Mc Mullen that this two-part filming would break any chain

of evidence.

On June 25, 1966, Mc Mullen and Saint George were

in contact with what they described as "gunrunners."

Mc Mullen

explained to the CBS team they would meet a Mr. Alex Wilson

on June 26, 1966, and filming would commence in the Coral

Gables area according to the briefing outlined on June 24,

1966.

It was on June 25, 1966, that Me Mullen revealed his

visit to the Alex wilson farm and the location and description

of the cache previously mentioned.

WE T-l advised that no

information was offered as to whether the arms cache on the

Wilson farm was actually transported to Coral Gables, or the

method of such transport from Atlanta to Coral Gables.

On June 26, 1966, the other members of the CBS team,

including Mc Mullen and St. George were taken by Alex Wilson

to what was described as a "safe höuse." The source stated

it was located in Coral Gables,

Florida, and is the third

house to

the east of 12th Street on the south side of 24th

Avenue:

Adjacent to the above was a fourth house described

as a

"collection house."

These houses were of a brown stucco

exterior, one story high, with either one-half, or three-

quarter length louvered jalousie windows running the width

of the houses.

They were single dwellings each with a car-

port west of the house, as an individual faces the house.

Their age is approximately twenty-five years.

The filming schedule for June 26, 1966, called for

a small boat, aboard a land trailer carrier to rendezvous

at the fourth house, described above, where the cache was

to have been loaded. However, Alex Wilson advised the CBS

team that this small boat was under

surveillance by United

States Customs and its scheduled pickup of the cache. was

safeguard the location of the "safe house"

and the "collection house." Alex Wilson then led the CBS

team to the "safe house"

and observed therein were the

following weapons:

Several canisters of rockets:

One AR 15 converted to an M-16 fully automatic weapon.

Stacks of Ml and Carbine rifles.

One rocket pistol:

With the exception of the "Sweedish K" weapon all

other weapons appeared to be of English or American manufacture.

During this filming on June 26, 1966, Alex Wilson

was very evasive in any attempt to obtain an explanation of

the origin of this cache. It further developed that St. George

and Alex Wilson were apparently well known to each other and

had known each other for a number of years. Kleig lights were

used inside this house as a light source to film the above

described weapons.

As the filming schedule of June 26, 1966, was not.

completed, it was agreed that Alex Wilson and others on June

27, 1966, would film a transport run to fulfill the planned

filming of the documentary.

On June 27, 1966, this CBS team went to the "safe

house''

Approximately three blocks away, a gray-white Dodge

panel truck was parked. It was explained by Wilson the panel

truck would gather weapons stored at various collection houses

in Coral Gables where they are maintained by sympathetic

persons.

The driver of this truck was identified simply as

"Gordo" who is a living prototyre of the comic strip character

of the same name.

"Gordo" was described as a Cuban exile.

The source advised the CBS team actually filmed

the pickup from one collection house of what were described

as cases of ammunition in military-type metal canisters.

Additional filming was done at a second collec-

tion house where 50 calibre machine guns were loaded on the

above described Dodge panel truck. These machine guns

were loaded aboard the panel truck by two male individuals,

wearing face masks for self-protection and who were described

by Alex Wilson as Haitian exiles. A= 6:35 p.m. a small boat

aboard a land. trailer

was to appear at the safe house and

the cargo on the panel truck, which had been placed in the safe

house was to be reloaded on this small boat for delivery to

the "mother ship." At 6:45 p.m. the small boat had not arrived.

At 6: 45 phis

Alex Wilson

and "Gordo" were visibly nervous.

It was hurriedly

decided these weapons would be reloaded aboard the panel truck

änd returned: to the collection houses for safe storage and to

avoid burning the "safe house."

Later on June 27, 1966, Alex Wilson explained to

the CBS team that the small boat did not appear, as it was

under surveillance by what was described as two

"Falcon"

automobiles with "spike antennae" traveling on parallel

streets to the route taken by the small boat trailer. Alex

Wilson further stated that the cache aboard the panel truck

was driven

"down the coast,"' unloaded aboard another small

boat which met the "mother ship" and was then en route to

Haiti:

WE I-l noted that during various conversations with

Alex Wilson on June 26 and 27, 1966, he was frequently called

by the first name of 'Mitch" and/of "Mitchel":

The source

added that on one occasion a phonetic last name of "Dale"

or "Martindale" was used.

ALEX WILSON

Alex Wilson was physically described as five feet

ten inches tall, approximately 165 pounds, bulbous nose,

short brown hair, wearing a bushy brown upper lip mustache

and at all times dressed in light tan khaki pants and white

t-shirt. He is a white male and believed by source to be a

citizen of the United States. Alex Wilson spoke in a

"gravel voice and this in combination with the bulbous

nose gave the impression he is a heavy liquor drinker.

Noted in the company of Alex Wilson was one "Pancho"

described as a Cuban exile, residing in the Miami, Florida,

area. He was wounded seven times, and displayed these scars

for filming purposes. Pancho spoke good English, was approxi

mately six feet tall, weighing about 200 pounds,

wearing an

upper lip mustache, a round face, curly black hair, one who

fought with Fidel Castro, prior to Castro's assumption of

governmental powers in Cuba, and who allegedly fought on

an unknown side in the Spanish Civil War.

Pancho's role

in this "gun running operation'' was his hope to use Haitian

territory as a base to operate a counter revolution against

Cuba, realizing that such an operation cannot realistically

be accomplished from United States soil. Pancho was further

described as an individual who lacks formal education, but

who gives the appearance of being able to mount a counter-

revolution against Cuba.

27 g

On June 27 and 28, 1966, the CBS

team made a ten minute filmed sound interview of Pancho

who expressed his above thoughts to mount a counter revolution

from Haiti against Cuba.

During this interview, Pancho wore

a stocking over his head and a large straw hat.

open and done from the "carport" area. At the request of

Alex Wilson, camera tripods and other equipment were disguised

were directed away from the "safe house" exterior to avoid

its being compromised on film

Alex Wilson expressed no

concern over immediate persons residing in the neighbor-

hood as he described them as all sympathetic to the operations

carried on in the "safe house." Alex Wilson, Pancho and

Gordo were described as legitimately "jumpy"' and when

exterior shooting was completed it was agreed they would

hurriedly depart the area. As a test run, the CBS team

with the exception of St. George, departed the area with

lights off and at high speed to detormine if they were

being surveilled.

No surveillance was noted by this CBS team. How-

ever, later in the night of June 28, 1965, when the CBS

team

regrouped at the Hotel Biscayne, Andrew St. George

advised he had been stopped by what were described to him

as "Treasury Agents"

These men flashed identity cards

Identifying themselves as "Treasury Agents" and after

conducting a search of his trunk released St. George.

St. George offered no additional details.

WE T-I advised the above events completed phase

one of this documentary:

Additional conversation on June 28, 1966, developed

phase two.

Alex Wilson discussed the possibility of renting

a secondary sloop as a replacement vessel for the small

boat currently used by Alex Wilson, and the question was

raised whether CBS would pay for its rental.. Me Mullen with

the consent of other CBS team members agreed that $500 to

$1000 dollars would be made available to Alex Wilson for

such rental.

However, Wilson is to make the actual rental

arrangements and CBS was in no way to be identified in this

transaction

Filming of phase two was tentatively established

to commence between June 29, 1966, and July 8, 1966.

July 5, 1966, it was established that Mc Mullen had learned

the rental arrangements had been accomplished and the CBS

team was put on a forty-eight hour alert to return to the

Miami, Florida, area to commence filming phase two of the

documentary.

For the purpose of filming phase two, a

rented sloop is to be used to protect the actual boat which

makes delivery to the "mother ship."

On the night of June

28, 1966, Alex Wilson stated "they" had lost a boat (not

further described) about two months ago as it was plying

the Cuban coastline. According to Alex Wilson this boat

with a cache of weapons was bombed by a Cuban air force

plane, and sunk with loss of all personnel aboard. No

further details were offered by Alex Wilson.

It was further developed that phase two called

for the CBS team to film a hidden "B-25" bomber equipped

with radar, bomb bay and bomb sight.

It is intended that

in the actual invasion of Haiti this bomber will be used

to bomb "Duvalier's"

palace at Port au Prince, and signal

the start of a revolution sometime within the next three

months. Alex Wilson offered no information whatsoever as

to whether the "B-25"' is stored inside or outside the

territorial limits of the United States. The invitations

to film phase one and

this "B-25" were extended by "Pancho."

During this conversation no estimate of available Haitian

rebel forces or the framework of any provisional Haitian

government was discussed in detail. Alex Wilson offered only

vague generalities that many Haitian factions would join

forces to accomplish the demise of the Duvalier government.

Mc Mullen ventured the opinion that a successor government

to Duvalier would be picked by the United States government.

According to St. George, Alex Wilson had des-

cribed himself as a former associate of the Central Intel-

ligence Agency, and prior

thereto as associated with the

oSS (Office of

Strategic Services and forerunner to CIA)

St.

Coorge added that Alox Wilson is well know in Sante

Phase two calls for this CBS team to be aboard

the "mother ship" for its five day run to a naval base in

the Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic (DR), area.

There,

a cache of arms is to be unloaded to other

small boats for

transport to an undisclosed area along the Haiti coastline

where rebels within Haiti are to receive these

arms

Cur -

rent negotiations with Alex Wilson call, for the CBS docu

Wilson that the "mother ship" shipment with the CBS team aboard

would be the second to last shipment of arms destined for

Haitain rebels. No data was available regarding prior ship-

ments:

wr I-l stated, to the best of his knowledge, the

film and voice tape taken on phase one is now at CBS

headquarters, New York City, in the care of Jay Mc Mullen

or a Jewels Laventhol. This film has beenpröcessed and no

other copy exists.

Jay Mc Mullen personally vouched for the trustworthi-

ness of other CBS team members to Alex Wilson.

WE T-I advised that Mc Mullen is known in CBS as

a "wildman," "'odd ball" documentary film editor. Mc.Mullen

was responsible for the sensational CBS show entitled "The

Boston Bookie'! which revealed police department involvement

with "numbers' in the Boston, Massachusetts

area.

No decision has been made by CBS headquarters,

New York City, to show, of not to show, the completed

documentary.

ALEX WILSON

However, it is known at this time, that the Alex

Wilson group poses no objection to CBS showing the completed

film prior to the three months time schedule for an alleged

invasion of Haiti

The Alex Wilson group reasons, that prior

CBS telecasting would not reveal to the Duvalier Government,

anything they do not already know. Further, Mc Mullen cannot

be dissuaded, due to the openness of the Alex Wilson operation,

that United States Government agencies generally are not

cognizant of this operation, and Mc Mullen is firmly con-

vinced the operation has tacit approval by the United States

Government. Other than personal opinion, Mc Mullen has

offered no substantive informationas to

how he is convinced

the Alex Wilson operation does in fact have approval by any

agency within the United States Government.

Mc Mullen holds

the additional theory that this documentary would place its

Cuban and/or Haitian participants in a very strong position

to identify themselves with the leadership of a new govern-

ment,

either in Cuba or Haiti. Logically, these rebels

could establish through a documentary film, they are the

heroes who took the risks.

we l-l understood that at no time: did Alex Wilson

permit the CBS team to take a photograph of a person's head.

However, in the film, the back of Alex Wilson's head appears

as does his full length silhouetted body.

Additional conversation dring the filming deter-

mined that Alex Wilson was scheduled to depart for Santo

Domingo, DR, on June 29, 1966.

According to Mc Mullen,

Alex Wilson actually went to the DR and returned to the

Miami, Florida, area on July 2, 1966:
