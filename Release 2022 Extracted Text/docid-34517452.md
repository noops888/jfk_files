arms had rested with JOSE RABEL, former Captain of the
JURE: boat,’ "Venus", until RABEL was captured in an attempt
to infiltrate into Cuba. “Theréafter, COBOS was technically
responsible for this equipment. His apparent purpose in
conducting this:inventory was to assure himself the arms
were ‘still being held intact by the Dominican military.

: -COBOS indicated to MM T-1 that this inventory
determined that this equipmént consisted of.50 caliber
machine guns, a. recoilless cannon, numerous small arms,
-and ammunition, estimated value $8,000.00 to $10,000.00.

. COBOS subsequently determined that MITCHELL
WER BEL would not join him in thé Dominican Republic eae
inasmuch as he had been refused a visa, this refusal
“being based, in part, on a complaint by one STEPHANY,
owner of a small shipping company which operates beats
between Mi and Santo Domingo, the nature of the complaint .

_ decision. was the fact that WER BEL when previously in the
~Dominican ‘Republic was somehow involved in an automobile
“accident in which a small boy was injured. Additionally,
. : WER-BEL had previously given a bad ¢héck in thé amount of ~~
“=~ .$5,000,.00 to FRANK BERMUDEZ, Dominican’ millionaire and
President “of J. Armando Bermudez Company,’ a rum distillery,
“although “COBOS: indicated to.theé source that this check was
still being held’ by BERMUDEZ and had not been reported to
the Dominican authorities,

, Through contact with Commodore JIMENEZ, COBOS
was successful in having this restriction removed and having
..a visa issued for: WER BEL to enter the Dominican Republic
for. the purpose of conducting business there, After having
the way paved by a telephone ¢all from Commodore JIMENEZ,
COBOS personally contacted Mr. BOBADILLA, head of the
Dominican’ Visa Office,and had WER BEL's visa application
approved and mailed.to thé Dominican Consulate in Miami,

, Dr. LAWRENCE MITCHELL arrived in the Dominican ~~
Republic on August 4, 1966, and joined COBOS. On August 6,
1966; COBOS and’Dr. MITCHELL traveled to Santiago where they
“met a business associate of MITCHELL's named EDMUNDO VALLE.
‘MITCHELL and VALLE had been in the banana business but were
planning “to attempt to develop a péanut oll refinery in
Santiago. MITCHELL and. COBOS spent the day examining an
oll refinery that MITCHELL expects to lease for this business
venture, i

On the following day, MITCHELL and COBOS visited

TRANK BERMUDEZ, préviously described, whom COBOS described
“to'MM T-1 as /a°long-time friend. BERMUDEZ discussed several

business, propositions with COBOS, including the possibility.
that: he. would purchase a farm for COBOS to operate and-also

: COBOS” subsequently introduced MITCHELL to Commodore

borrowed $11,000.00 from Dr. MITCHELL which He had used to
repair the "Venus", purchase arms and gasoline. RABEL had
not repaid this money when he was captured in Cuba, and COBOS
reportedly advised the Commodore he was relinquishing control
of. these arms to Dr. MITCHELL in order to satisfy this
obligation on the part of RABEL. COBOS did not indicate to
the source that he was aware of any agreément reached by Dr.
MITCHELL and Commodore JIMENEZ as to disposition of these
arms other than ‘that Dr. MITCHELL indicated he was not
interested in physical possession of the arms but only wanted
to sell them to recover his money.

Following COBOS! return to Miami, Florida, he was-
commissioned by the American Engineering and Supply Company,
Miami, to again’ travel to the Dominican Republic in an
attempt to. promote: business with the Dominican Government.
This company formerly supplied uniforms and equipment,
except firearms, to the Dominican Navy. Although COBOS
was not paid for these services, the company offered to
furnish his round-trip transportation and agreed to give
hina. percentage of all business he developed in the
Dominican: Republic.

COBOS also indieated he planned to take advantage
of this. opportunity to assist MITCHELL WER BEL in establishi
a business there astwell as to obtain a.factory site for
production of the Gyrojet Rocket Handgun. ~ COBOS departed

to:move to.the Key Biscayne Hotel, Key. Biscayne, Miami,
Florida. This move was accomplished during the late after-
noon.of ,June'24, 1966, and this CBS team registered under

©: their. true: names. During the. briefing on June. 24, 1966,

Mc Mullen explained they were to film a documentary for

CBS concerning a cache of weapons in the Coral Gables area
which were parcelled out to various collection houses, there-
after, centrally gathered in’a "safe house,'' where they

-were to be reloaded for transport by small boat to a "mother

ship" off-the coast of. Florida. Mc Mullen indicated the

~- final destination of these weapons was their delivery to
- rebel forces in Haiti. to be used.within a three month period

to overthrow the. government of President Duvalier of Haiti.

- It-was further indicated that the’ filming would be in: two

parts. The first would include filming of the storage and
t¥ansport of the. cache from Coral Gables to the "mother ship".
The second portion would include transport by the "mother

ship" to a naval base in the Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic,
area, and thereafter reloading on: small boats for transfer

and delivery to Haitian rebel. forces, It was thought by

Mc Mullen that this two-part filming would break any chain

of -evidence.

J Onedune 26,1966, the other members of ‘the CBS: team,

it was. located in Coral Gables, Florida, and is the third’
house ‘to the east of 12th Street on the south side of 24th
Avenue «. Adjacent) to the above was a fourth house described

st asa collection house.''| These houses were of a. brown stucco
exterior, one story high, with either one-half, or three-
quarter length louvered jalousie windows running the width
of the houses.’ They were single dwellings each with a car-
port west. of the house, as an individual faces the house.
Their age is approximately twenty- five Dares
The filming schedule for June 26, 1966, called for
asmall ‘boat, aboard a land trailer carrier to rendezvous
at the fourth house, described above, where the cache was
to have been loaded. However, Alex Wilson advised the CBS
team that this small boat was under surveillance. by United
States Customs .and its scheduled pickup of the cache. was
canceled.to safeguard the location of the "safe house!
and the "collection house.".. Alex Wilson then led the CBS
team to the "safe house'! and observed therein were the
following weapons:

: During this filming on June 26, 1966, Alex Wilson
was very. evasive in any attempt to obtain an explanation of
the origin of. this cache. It further developed that St. George
and Alex Wilson were apparently well known to each other and
: had: known each other for a number ‘of years, Kleig lights were
5 ~ used-inside this house as a light source to film the above

a As the filming schedule of June 26, 1966, was not
completed, it was agreed that. Alex Wilson and others on June
27, 1966, would film a transport run. to fulfill the planned
filming of the documentary:

: On June “27, 1966, this CBS team went to the "safe
housel'. . Approximately three blocks away, a gray-white Dodge
panel truck was parked. It’ was explained by Wilson the panel
truck would: gather weapons ‘stored at various collection houses °
in Coral Gables “where they are maintained by sympathetic

persons... The driver of this truck was identified simply as e
"Gordo" who isia living prototype of the comic strip character

of ‘the ‘same.name,. “Gordo! was. described asa: Cuban exile.

as. cases of ammunition in cmilitary -type metal cani

ters.

\ “additional filming was done ata second eollec-

tion house where 50 calibre machine guns were loaded on the

above described Dodge panel ‘truck. These machine guns

were loaded aboard. the panel truck by two male individuals,

wearing face. masks for self-protecticn and. who were described
«by Alex Wilson as Haitian exiles. A > 6:35 p.m. a-small boat

aboard-a land. trailer was to appear*at the safe house and

the cargo on the panel truck, which had been placed in the safe

house was to be. reloaded on this small boat” for delivery to

the "mother: ship." At 6:45 p.m, the small boat had not: arrived:
Alex Wilson and "Gordo" were visibly nervous. It was hurriedly -

decided. these weapons would be reloaded aboard the panel truck
and returned: to ‘the collection REELS for safe storage and to
avoid burning the "safe house.'

. Later on June 27, 1966, ‘Alex: Wilson explained to

the CBS team that the small boat did not appear, as it was’
under. surveillance by what was described as two ''Falcon"
automobiles with.'"'spike antennae" traveling on parallel
streets to’ the route’ taken bythe small boat trailer. Alex
Wilson. further stated that the cache aboard the panel: truck
was. driven ''down a coast,'! unloaded aboard another small

“boat: which met the “nother ship'! and was then en route. to
Haiti.

WF T-1 noted that. during various conversations with
‘Alex Wilson on June 26 and 27, 1966, he was frequently called
by the first name of "Mitch"! and/or "Mitchel". “The source
ecded that on one occasion a phonetic last name of ''Dale!
or "Martindale" was used.

and:at all. times*dressed in light tan khaki pants and white

“ot-Shirt..He issa white male and:believed by source to bea

"eravely'-voice and this in combination with the ‘bulbous
nose gave the impression. he is a heavy liquor drinker.

Noted in*the company of Alex Wilson was one "Pancho"
described as a.Cuban exile, residing in the Miami, Florida,

“area. He was wounded seven times, and displayed these scars

for filming purposes. Pancho spoke good English, was approxi-
mately six feet tall, weighing about 200 pounds, wearing an
upper lip mustache, a round face, curly black hair, one who
fought with Fidel Castro,. prior to Castro's assumption of
governmental powers in Cuba, and who allegedly fought on

“an unknown side in the Spanish Civil War. Pancho's role

in-this "gun running operation" was ‘his hope to use Haitian
territory. asa base to operate a counter-revolution against
Cuba; realizing that such an operation cannot realistically
be accomplished from United States soil. Pancho was further
described as an individual who lacks formal education, but

-who. gives the appearance of being able to mount-a counter-~

revolution against Cuba. On June 27 and 28, 1966,.the CBS
team made. a ten minute filmed, sound interview of Pancho

who’ expressed his above thoughts to mount a counter-revolution
from Haiti against Cuba. During this: interview, Pancho wore

‘a stocking -.over his head and a large straw-hat.

“the Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. (DR), area. There,
»a cache of .arms:is. to-be unloaded to: other small ‘boats.for

transport to an undisclosed area along the Haiti coastline
where rebels within Haiti are to receive these arms.’ Cur-
rent negotiations with Alex Wilson call. for the CBS. docu-
mentary to. terminate at this point. However, this CBS

team is attempting to persuade Alex Wilson to allow them

to follow: the rebels into. their Haitian jungle hiding area;
however,:no decision has been made to allow the CBS team a
to go on Haitian soil....It was further indicated by Alex
Wilson that the "mother ship". shipment .with the CBS team aboard
would be the second to last shipment of arms destined for
Haitain rebels. No data was. available regarding prior ship-
ments. :

ALEX WILSON) 200 : Qing

However, itvis known at, this time, ‘that. the Alex

S Wilson group: poses ‘no objection to CBS showing: the completed

film prior:to the three months time schedule for an alleged:
invasion of Haiti. The Alex Wilson group reasons, that prior
CBS telecasting ‘would. not reveal.to the Duvalier Government,

“anything they do not) already know. Further, Mc Mullen cannot
- be dissuaded, due to the openness of the Alex. Wilson operation,
_ that: United. States Government agencies generally are not

cognizant. of this operation, and Mc Mullen is firmly con-
vinced the operation has tacit approval by the United States
Government.” Other. than personal opinion, Mc Mullen. has
offered: no substantive information™as to how he is convinced
the Alex Wilson operation does in fact have approval by any
agency within the United States Government. Mc Mullen holds

-the additional theory that this documentary would place its

Cuban: and/or Haitian participants in a very strong position
to identify themselves with the leadership of a new govern-

“iment, either in Cuba or Haiti. Logically, these rebels E

could establish through a documentary film, they are the
heroes who':took the risks. : :

WF oT- lounderstood that: at no time, did Alex Wilson
permit the CBS-team.to take a photograph of a person's head. .
However, in the film, the back of Alex Wilson's head appears
as does his full length sithouetted body.

Additional conversation ring the filming deter-
mined that Alex Wilson was scheduled to depart for Santo
Domingo, DR,’ on June 29, 1966, According to Mc Mullen,
Alex Wilson actually went~to the DR and returned to. the
Miami, Florida, area on July 2, 1966.
