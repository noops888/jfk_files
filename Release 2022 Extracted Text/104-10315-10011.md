1. The proposal submitted in the reference is interesting and worth
serious. consideration. Several possible ideas have occurred to us on how
handapelirecr yeep eatherde tet ar ony As yet, however, none of these has

deen worked through sufficiently to prepare a definite plan of action.
Revertheless, it appears to us that any effort that would carry conviction
‘would bave to be based on detailed knowledge of the “proposed victin's”
hadits, movements, and exposures to the public, providing « basis for tim-
dng an attack and selecting « site from vhich an attempt could be made. In i
Short, ths coms information fe needed as would be required if an actual |
assassination attempt vere contexpletsd. It would be helpful if sketches |
‘and maps could be prepared to show routes of travel, time intervals, places
of vantage, aites cf police stetions, routes of escape, location of safe H
sites, primary and alternate means of exfiltrating after the attempt, loca- i
tions of «ites far caching the weapon end for picking up travel documents.
Such materials could then be worked into en operation attributable to the
Chinese Communists by the introduction of suitable Chinese touches, and
would provide documentary support to the prima facie evidence of the funds
ana rifie.

2. We believe that without the authentication described above, the t
combined ruzor and “evidence” vill readily be detected as a provocation. Hl
We therefore suggest that you draw together the information described above
and forward it to Headquarters to be processed for use in mounting this
operation.
