Se Referring to the just-announced capture of 17 raiders
at Norman Cay, Artime indicated’ that he was not particularly
exercised over them as individuals, but hoped the U.S. would
not be tricked into the position of bzing “what Castro
described as a protector of xissia and Cuba against exile
raiders." Of the exiles restricted to the Jade County area,
our only mutual acquaintance was Pedro diaz Lanz whom we
agreed for some time been so uncontrollable as to raise
serious doubt's as to his mental stability. For his part,
Artime said, he hoped that. he would not be served with a ae

\restriction notice since, if he was, he would depart the Y
U.S. permanently with an attendant blast of publicity. eee

{ 6. 1 asked about Jose Perez San Roman and leamed from t
| Axtime that Pepe had suffered a nental breakdown, that the

Robert Kennedvs had rented a home for Pene, his wife and two
children in the McLean area anc that Artime had been with Z !
them during the day when Mrs. Kennedy nad come tothe San Roman
(iene and seen Artime. Artime leamed that the San Roman
| children were driven to and from school by the Kennedys. (It
! turns out hat the Kennedy children, my three children, and
! Pepe's two all attend the same parochial school on MacArthur
i Blvd., so it is not unlikely that Pepe's children will seek
{ pret eos as the only ether Spanish-speaking children in the
: sc °

7. When I asked Artime’what fad brought about San Roman's
to breakdown wa he indicated that it was the result of conflicts

1 arising from marital unheppiness and pressures on him by the U.S.
Govt, to persuade the Brigade to enlist in the U.S. Army. San
; Roman apparently feels in retrospect that he should kave
H evacuated the Brigade from the beachhead rather than sacrificing
it. Artime said tnat San Ronan was somewhat resentful over.
the fact that his psychiatric bill was being paid by Miro Cardona,
Yegarding it a way of maxing him indebted to Miro. (In the
context, I judged that Pepe viewed Miro as a symbol of the CRC.)

a 8.  Artime also said that he had seen aehonte Fuentes and
Roberto Alejos in Guatemala and he suggested that Peralta's
coup had been amicably arranzed with Ydigoras. 1 inferred

that Artime had also seen Peralta on. his just-completed trip.

Duvalier, goording to Hernandez, Brennan asserts that his
activity is backed y the White House, his link being via .
Ambassador Javid Bruce. Brennan's cone-on apparently, is ( ’
to tell former Brigade members that if they help overthrow }
Duvalier, Haiti will be at their disposal for whatever {

10. In answer to their question, I said that I had not ieee
Brennan in OSS in his self-described role, although
it was entirely possible that Brennan, like many other |
officers, had actually served in CSS in one way or another.
And I pointed out that Dave Bruce had been Chief of our |
Operations in ETO. t

11, | Hernandez commented that since the first of the year Hl
he had been queried by both Jose Miro Cardona and Jose Ignacio fie
Rasco (MOC) as to whether I ("Eduardo") was still in the U.S. pans
and had denied any knowledge of my whereabouts,

12, By this time it was 2 o'clock in the morning, the a
three of us had downed @ fifth of Scotch and we regrouned in : |
the kitchen where I prepared breakfast for all. Before leaving, E
eine said he would call me after he had seen the Attomey
General.
