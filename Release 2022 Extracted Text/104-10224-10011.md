Mr, Wigren 1s conscientious and seripyy about his responsibilt-
ties as research supervisor in SR/CI, and he Utd a fine job in assemb-
ling and presenting SR's contribution to ‘the work of the Warren
Commission, During the reporting period, pressure of special events
has mado it impossiblo for moto give Mr. Wigren the close attention
and guidance needed, so I must ‘share’ the responsibility for what I
regard as the shortcomings of his unit: unnecessary delays, Lack

Jof initiative and imagination, an inadequate sense of relative
prioritios and an inability to bring the spark of life and meaning
into oral and written pr Ations about the Soviet services. As
Ihave noted betore, Mr. Wigren has buen affected more than most
by tho roorientation of SR/CI: it must bo stressed that he is. being
judged according to criteria different from those which earlier pre-
valled for his position; without direct expertence or special
Anterost in operations, he can hardly bo expected to bring to an
opcrationally-oriented research program a full range of experience
and understanding. Notwithstanding, ho has performed well and is a
distinct asset. At tho present timo Mr. Wigren and his staff are
engaged in the important and demanding task of preparing the NIS
chapter on Soviet intelligence, and his performance to date has been
marked by interest and competence ‘and aided by his unusual knowledge
of the Soviet intelligence scrvices
