PRESIDENT KENNEDY'S DEATH 'NEW BASIS FOR ANTI-ZIONISM IN SYRIA

27 Nov 63

Msg NI:

44 USC 2107(5)(g)(2)(D)(i)

It was not difficult to foresee that the dramatic murder

of the American President with all of [3G] new complications

would have repercussions also in the usual polemic between the

Arabs and Zionism.

In fact, the circumstance that the killer of OSWALD is

of Hebrew-Pölish origin has now caused a notable part of the

Cairo press to move in the [5G] that'Zionism (13G/M] to this

whole tragedy.

Naturally, there are no explanations of motives

and circumstances but this subjeçt (B val also) is, in the eyes

of some of the Arab extremists,, useful in muddying the waters

and once again directing accusations against Hebrew organizations.

A report follows.
