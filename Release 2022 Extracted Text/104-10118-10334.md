a undgudWentribution to the operation. Without the assistance
of SCANPLING and GERENDE with their unique qualifications, this

all possible. i

D.- In support of the Station's harassment campaign against Juan Jose
AREVALO Bermejo, launched at the request of Headquarters,
SCANELING again provided the means for carrying out e large portion
of the action taken, SCANTLING's efforts ranged from the mailing
of "poisoned" candy to the’ target to the placing of threatening
phone calls. SCANILING also made calls to various Mexican news-
Papers and mailed "montage" pictures of AREVALO anda Soviet in-

principals in the MCMAYFOWL casé, particularly any connection
with procurement of of documents used i the flight behind the Iron
Curtain, This assignment was extremély sensitive (SCANTLING

admirable job while maintaining his cover for having the interview.

SECRET/RARSR

a. On the basis of a request:to the Station from the
ODACID Chief,-SCANTLING was sefit'tO Puebla to be an
eyewitness to the June 1961*Catholic inspired anti-CASTRO
demonstrations,’ Not only did SCANTLING obtain the desired
information, and samples-of many of the leaflets used, but he
prepared his report for the Station in time for the COS to give
tae ODACID Chief a briefing at 1000 hrs., 5 June 1961.
SCANTLING does an excellent job on this type of assignment
due principally to his ability to observe and report objectively.

b, SCANTLING was instrumental in establishing that
Fernando LLANES Cavero and his wife were living at a local
Mexico City address, This case has been of considerable
counterespionage interest to Headquarters.

c, SCANTLING has continued: his contributions to the
Paul Frederick KIRSCHHOFF case. by. ‘periodic interviews with
the subject's neighbors and: dgsociates.,

3. “To exploit operational leads through recruitments, debriefings,
and surveillances, " SCANTLING has contributed to this objective both
directly and indirectly as will be noted by the examples listed below:

a.’ SCANTLING devoted a lot of time tothe
surveillance and attempted recruitment of Abel ARTEAGA} a

Vi COSTS op

A. Past Project Year - Station finance records indicate that Project LIEMPTY
expended $21, 458.00 during Fiscal Year 1961 (1 December 1960 - 30 June 1961) and
has thus far during Fiscal Year 1962 (through 30 September 1961) expended about
$11,000.00, It is anticipated that about $8, 000.00 will be expended during the last
two months (October and November 1961) of the project year. This will make a
total expenditure during the project year of about $40,500.00, or some $12, 500.00
under the budget estimate of $53,000.00.

example, in May 1960, LIFEAT indicated

that the LIMERICK target was having con-

The unexpected resignation of CLACKETT in August 1960 has
necessitated the decision ashow best to'utilize the LIERSEY surveillance
team and still benefitsfrom the training and experience gained by the team
during the past year, As.explained in the LITEMPO project outline, it was
decided that the LITEMPO Staff Agent would have the time, the need and the
requirements to handle and manage the LIJERSEY team on a regular basis;
consequently, the Station believed that such a solution to this problem would
pe. ‘ae Station to continue to profit from Cl.ACKETT's past efforts,

A. General comments pertaining to the value of the project efforts to the
Station's needs - The Station is of the opinion that its operations are only
as good as the support mechanisms backstopping and contributing to them,
' The avatiabiliry of unilateral support agents and organizations, such as
,the LIEMPTY Project, to investigate leads and to collect operational
information in indispensable ingredient to the Station's espionage and
counterespionage objectives. The Station would be seriously handicapped
in its operational activities should the support services of such agents as
GERENDE, SCANTLING and the agents under their control be suddenly
made unavailable,

eovieaee of the Sides ctivities: Dana fellow associates of LIMERICK
photographi ie ‘basehouses undoubtedly provide
more of this type information than-any-other Station operation, The
production from LIEMPTY: photographic bases and from the LIENVOY
project provide the Station\with the jarge majority of LIMERICK leads.

be made of individuals‘and places which are of operational interest and
apartments and hotel rooms can be acquired in fictitious names in

support of sensitive operations and acrivities,

D. Although the progress and success of any support project depends
upon requirements from other Station operations, it must be concluded
that Project LIEMPTY has indeed been effective during the past project
year,

PROBLEMS

A, Security - The activities of the LICALLA base were suspended in
September 1960 as a direct result of the arrest of three KURIOT
technicians by the Cuban Government, One of the technicians was known
to have knowledge of the four LIMUST une ({QICALLA, is located in one
of these units) and the Station considered! tt: propriate to suspend photo-
graphic operations pending resoluri situation, At this time,
there is no indication when LIGALLA operations will be resumed. The
LICALLA base operator has reported that.there have been no unusual
inquiries or other suspicious actions which might indicate that LICALLA
has been compromised to LIMERICK personnel; however, such a
possibiliry will exist until the release of the three technicians. No

other security problems have occurred during the past year,

PLANS

A. Processing of Photographs - During the past year consid
progress has been made in the Station's handli ing, i.e., sorting,
identifying leads and filing, of photographs produced by the several

B. Photographic Techniques - The previous LIEMPTY Project Renewal
Request indicated that the Station planned ro try new techniques using
HY-~PAN film in night photography, ree, was used on a trial

all-bases and LIENTRAP n¢ Kuss, is superior to any film previously
used by the Station for clandestine photography. The quality of all
base photographs have been increased considerably as a direct result
of this new film, 5

Cc. General Comments - The Station believes that the GERENDE
segment is now operating under optimum organizational arrangments
and there are no plans for expansion contemplated at this time. It is
expected that SCANTLING will soon be relieved of his interim
xesponsibility for the LJERSEY team and can concentrate more on his
investigative and casing activities. The transfer of the LJERSEY team
to Project LITEMPO reduced Project Li BM TWactivities by an
appreciable amount, It is not Planned au} the coming year, to

A, Past Project Year - - Station finance’ records indicate that Project
LIEMPTY expended $19, 120, dozing Fiscal Year 1960 (1 December
1959 - 30 June 1960) and has thus far during Fiscal Year 1961 (through
31 October 1960) expended $16, 734,69, Contract Agents salaries and
allowances paid by Headquarters bring the total expenditures for 11
months of the project year to approximately $50,000.00. An additional
$4, 000. CO will be obligated during the 12th month of the project year,
This will bring total project expenditures to about $54, 000.00 for the
entire project year,

B, Ensuing Period - Of the total $53,000.00 budget, itemized below,
$31, 900. 00 should be expended during the remainder of Fiscal Year
1961 and the balance, $21,100.00, should be. expended during Fiscal

Vil, EMERGENCY CONDITIONS

As regards the requirement listed in CSI-F No, 230-60, Aunex A, for
communications arrangments in the event of "Emergency Conditions,"
the Station does not anticipate that this project would or could continue
to function under its present objectives, However, both principal

agents, SCANTLING and GERENDE, would very possibly be wo:
sources of information to maintain contact wich under any aciverse
conditions, Both of these agents identify the:nselfs,-in terms of
ideology, motivation and perspective, more as Americans than as

1. ‘BACKGROUND,

The LIEWPTT Project is designed to collect operational information on the
LIMERICK installation and personnel, as well as tergets of opportunity, through
stationary and mobile photographic coverage. In addition, the project provides
the means for investigating leads from the above noted coverages as well as other

+ Station sources. LIEMPIY supports other Station operations through the renting of

L

“safchouses, providing and servicing post ofvice vox letter drops, conducting counter,
surveillances and investigations and performing related tasks.

2. OPERATIONS ~ REVIEW.

The Station feels that it vould be helpful’ ty summarize at this time informatio
previously reported to Headquarters (see paresraph)3, reference B) concerning the

photo basehouses under this project and: he age ‘give Headquarters en updated frame
of reference in which to view the roles: ‘the ous basehouses.

‘The LIMITED an@ LILYRIC basehousés pr aN erage of front of the LIMERICK
installation. . Although op.the ‘surface-it; ear that these two basehouses -
provide duplicate teke, thig-1s not“the.cgse, It has been the Station's experience
in running the unilaterel I: eration that a 0900 to evening workday, which
would be required of e-single bagelistise in order to cover the LIMERICK target
effectively, is just too long for any veir of agents to romain effective, This is
especially true it is considered that these basehouse: operators are essentially!
unsupervised turing their workday. It vould also be impossible for a single base-
house to provide the kind of coverege the Station needs on the target installation,
especially dur che peak hours of activity, namely Inte mormming and early aftamoch.

For these reasons, the LILYRIC basehouse gerierally operates from 0900 to 1400 or 1500
weekdays. LIMITED operates from 1200 to 1800 or dark (as the daily situation

dictates) on weekdays, and 0900 to 1400 on Saturdays. (These hours are subject to
change to fit Station needs.) Special coverage for Sunday is arranged on a need

basis; however, past experience has shown reguler coverage of Saturday afternoons

end Sundays is not rewarding. This schedule provides for both basehouses to be in
ection during the peak activity hours of the HIMERICK target. Although even this
errangement is not completely airtight: anythipg™ ess than this would present unaccept-|
able gaps in the coverage. It must. algo. bé‘considered that without two basehouses cove

ODEs) and KUTUBE Ops haye nd Neen completely i
ground of the LIEMPTY Prien Hi\iis agent requirements, At the time
HMMA-14093 (Request for ewal of Project LIEMPTY) was written, it

was assumed that the Mexico Desk and KUTUBE/D could answer any additional
questions, based on reports and dispatches not normally available to the
senior staffs, which might be raised during the renewal process.

2, In enswer to paragraph 2a, Oliver G, SCANTLING first contacted
Inez PARADA de Moreno in early 1957 to fulfill a KUTUBE/D requirement,
He visited her as an architect interested in viewing the LIMERICK installation
from the building where she lives, He was socially acquainted with her brother,
-a Catholic Priest, and knew the family to be unquestionably anti-Communist,
However, it would be imprudent on the Station's and | SCANTLING' 's part to
assume that PARADA does not at least suspect. ct that’s me anti~ LIMERICK
intelligence service is involved, PARADA suggested luring SCANTLING's
initial visit that he could Nene time for: further observations, This
was reported by SCANTLI CK iM 'ych'l957 and-it does not seem appropriate
to query him again on te pap for his Recent visits.

3. While HMMA-14093 Sreoel Qaixneerrea to LIMITED, LILYRIC and
LICALLA as "photographic basel aeag " the Station would like to emphasize

4 February 1959). LIMITED is used as a radio dispatch base for automobile
surveillance teams in addition to physical surveillance of persons entering
the front gate, Their photography is negligible compared to their other duties,
The LILYRIC base performs the best photography of persons visiting the front
gate, perhaps because the vantage point for taking the pictures is from the
second floor and above the street traffic which partially blocks LIMITED
photographs, LILYRIC also does individual reports on LIMERICK personnel

| entering and leaving the main gate. LICALLA is used almost exclusively to

| identify LIMERICK officials and to support KUTUBE/D requirements in

5, In conclusion, the Station would like to point out that the "photo-
graphic basehouses" represent an integral and significant part of the Station's
counterespionage effort against the LIMERICK installation. These bases do
not produce Foreign

Intelligence and should not be considered in such a light.
