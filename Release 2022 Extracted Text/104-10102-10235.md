panalize into action their present. anti-communist feeling
and “Ineuce those who maintain a passive attitude but. who
are potentially susceptible to turn against the Regime,
to act now.. The future plan of action and the size and de-
velopment of the present operation would he determined af-
ter first contacts are made and information. thus gathered,
is evaluated. However, "Leonardo" should be considered ag
merely a first step towards coordination of anti-Castro
elements within the Cuban Government, for producing an in-
ternal upheaval. ;

It 1s the opinion of people with con-
tacts in Cuba,-that the moment to act is now, because the
conditions for action are ripening steadily. Reliable in-
formation from the Island points out to the gradual inter
nal softening of the Castro Regime, to tensions existing
among its members, and to the effect President Kennedy's
words had in the highest governmental. Cuban circles who
are said to have acknowledged with sympathy his phrase
that "I am confident ‘that all over the island of Cuba, in
the Government itself, in the Army, in the Militias, there
ae winy who ... have viewed with dismay the destruction

oy LEONARDO IL: Throe disembarcation points

are planned for this operation: a) the outer keys off Santa
Clara Day, (Matanzas province), b) keys off Caibarien, c)
keys off Corralillo area (Las Villas province). . Santa Clara
Bay keys are thought most advisable ‘as they are inhabited
by fishermen: and charcoal workers only and military patrols
visit them: very infrequently, because of extremely difficult
“Living conditions there,” Two men. employed in this mission:
Dr. Nestor Moreno 41, and Miguel Diaz y Selgue 23, would
use one of the fishermen (who are known to be willing to
work against Castro and had worked with them before), to go
to the mainland and proceed to Cardenas with the message to
arrange a necting with Comandante Ramon Guin or a person he
designates. The round trip to Cardenas might take two or
three days. If conditions-are favorable and a meeting can
be arranged at once, the two men would go inland. However,
if the rendézvous with Cuban contacts cannot take place
immediately, they would have to return to Key Sal or any
other base and go back on the date or dates previously fixed
by the message. Through Comandante Guin, who works in INRA
and travels around the country, and through anti-Castro| army
and civilian elements already active in Cardenas and Marti,
the following army officers would be contacted initially:

Comandante Guerra, Comandante Parra, Comandante Jose Pinares,

contacts would be enlarged.

The above mentioned officers were ap-

Pronched before Pig's Bay and agreed to participate in Ne-
bel Army uprising in Las Villas province as a part of in-
ternal-external anti-Castro plan, After Play Giron, which
upset that plan, they remained in the Government and are
said to be disposed to do it again.

4.- GENERAL OBSERVATIONS:

“It 4s considered that although the major-
ity-of officials whom the participants of the missions Plan
to talk to have no political ambitions and will act against
Castro for purely Adeological reasons, mininum of assurances
and promises have to be offered. It is also a concensus of
-epinien; that once initial steps are successfully accomplished
an additional number of persons shou]d be used for the devol~
opment of "Leonardo", working always in operational coordin-
ation. Each of them are known to have friends within the

Cuban Government and their Personal and representative
