SECRET

OPERATION "LEONARDO".

•- OBJICTIVES:

To establish contact with elements

within the Governuent, Rebel Army and Milltia, In order to

panalize into action their present anti-cormunist feeling

and tacuce those who maintain a passtve attitude but who

are potenttally susceptible to turn againat the regime,

to aot now... The future plan of action and the size and de-

velopment of the present operation would be determined al-

ter first contacts are made and Information thus gathered,

is evaluated.. However, "Leonardo" ghould be considered as

merely a first step towards coordination of anti-Cagtro

elements within the Cuban Government, for producing an in-

ternal upheaval.

It 1s the opinion of people with con-

tacts in Cuba; that the moment to act is now, because the

conditions for

action are ripening steadily. Rellable in-

formation from the Island points out to the gradual inter-

nal softening of the Castro Regine, to tensions existing

among Its menbers, and to the effect President Kennedy's

words had in the highest governmental Cuban circles who

are sald to have acknowledged with sympatby his phrase

that "I am confident that all over the island of Cuba, In

the Government Itself, In the Arny, In the Militias, there

are many who.... have viewed with dismay the destruction

of freedom faith and who are determined to restore that

LEONARDO II: Three disenbarcation polnts

are planned for this oporation: a) the outer keys off Santa

Clara Day. (Matanzas provinco), b) keys o11 Calbarien, c)

keys off Corrallllo area (Las Villas province).. Santa Clara

Bay keys are thought most advisable as they are inhabited

by fishermen and charcoal workers only and military patrols

vialt them very infrequently, because of extrenely difficult

11ving conditions there.: Two men enployed in this mission:

Dr. Nestor Moreno 41, and Miguel Diaz y Salgue 23, would

use one of the fishermen (who are known to be willing to

work against Castro and had worked with them before), to go

to the mainland and proceed to Cardenas with the message to

arrange & meeting with Conandante Ramon Guin or a person he

designates. The round trip to Cardenas might take two or

three days. If conditions are lavorable and a meeting can

be arranged at once, the two men would go inland. However,

if the rendezvous with Cuban contacts cannot take place

Innediately, they would have to return to Key Sal or any

other base and go back on the date or dates previously fixed

by the message. Through Comandante Gull, Whe norka In INRA

and travels around the country, and through anti-Castro army

and civilian elements already active in Cardenas and Martl,

the following army officers would be contacted initlally:

Comandante Guerra, Comandante Parra, Comandante Jose Pinares,

Capitan Hanuel Avila, Capitan Layton. -Iron there on the

contacts would be enlarged.

The above mentioned officers were ar-

proached belore Pig's Bay and agreed to participate in he-

bel Army uprising in Las Villas province as a part of in-

ternal-external anti-Castro plan. After Play Giron, which

upset that plan, they remained in the Government and are

said to be disposed to do it again.

3. - BUSIPHENT:

A 25 or 27

speed boat which can navigate

in shallow waters and can cruise at 40 knots. Identifica

tion documents, Cuban money and small amount of arms.

l Data about Cuban sea patrols la lavana and latanzas provinces,

equipnent for conmunications, once contacts are established.

4.- GENERAL OBSERVATIONS:

It is considered that although the major-

1ty.of officlala whom the participants of the missions plan

to talk to have no political ambitions and will act againat

• Castro for purely Ideological reasons, mininum of assurances

and pronises have to be offered. It 1s also a concensus of

opiaton, that once initial steps are successfully accomplished!

an additional number of persons should be uned for the devel

opment of "Leonardo", working always in operational coordin-

ation. Each of them are known to have frteads within the

Cuban Government and their personal and representative
