1. Jt 4s requested that the following witnesses be made available for
appearance before the Board in addition to those requested on 2
October 69.

a. Miss Alte Fowler, Consul, American Brbassy, Brussels.

(1) It 4s expected thet Miss Fowler would testify that she
requested LIC Herlihy to inform any American military personnel who
had become involved with the Woodward brothers, that their activities
were under investigation; and, therefore, association with these
individuals was likely to cause serious embarragament to the U. 8.
Embassy and to SHAPE.

(2) Miss Fowler would further testify as to the manner in
which she was interviewed.inconjunction with LIC Herlihy's background
Anvestigation. Her testimony would substantiate the fact that this
investigation had been conducted in an improper and unprofessional
manner with a view toward placing LIC Herlihy in an unfavorable light.

. Peter Bagley, Chief of CYA, Brussels, Belgium.

(1) It is expected that Mr. Bagley would testify to the effect
that he was interviewed concerning LIC Herlihy.

SUBJECT: LIC William J. Herlihy, 558-36-6175 29 October 1969

(2) He would testify that he was questioned in an improper
manner.

(3) He woulda further testify that he told the investigators
that LIC Herlihy never represented himself as a member of the CIA.

c. Sgt Ortey, Office of the U. 8. Military Representative, Belgium.

(1) tt 18 expected that Sgt Ortey will testify as to his
relationship with Mrs. Walton and the fact that during the period of
this relationship he held a highly sensitive position at SHAPE.

(2) Sgt Ortey's testimony is relevant in that it would have a
direct bearing on Mrs. Walton's reputation for truth and veracity.

2. It is requested that the following documents be made availeble to
the defense in addition to those requested on 8 October 69.

a. The complete files of all investigations conducted with reference
to the Woodward brothers. This includes counter-intelligence as well as
criminal investigations conducted in Belgium and Germany and any other
locations.

(1) The defense has reason to believe that individuals involved
dn the Woodward case exerted pressure to influence the actions taken
against LIC Herlihy.

b. The dossier of LIC Herlihy retained at the U. 8. Army Intelli-
gence Command, Ft. Holabird, Maryland.

c¢. The dossiers and results of any investigations of Mre. Ysabelle
Walton retained by the 650th MX Detachment and the 513th MI Group.

(1) These reports are relevant in that they would have a direct
bearing upon Mrs. Walton's motives for making untruthful statements
concerning LTC Herlihy.

d. Record of electronic telephone intercept of conversation allegedly
oot 196 Mrs. Walton in Brussels and LIC Herlihy in Stuttgart, Germany, in
Oct 1967.

3. This additjonal request for witnesses and documents should not be
considered final. A request has been submitted to Department of the Army
for assistant counsel who had investigated this case on behalf of LTC
Herlihy at SHAPE. Until the defense has had an opportunity to consult

with these individuals, we are not able to determine whether all possible

witnesses and documents have been requested.

4. on 15 Sep 69, the defense requested that it be provided with a
transcript of an interview of LIC Herlihy conducted by agents of the
902nd MI Group. This request was submitted to the Commanding Officer,
902nd MI Group. On 11 Sep 69, the defense requested that the statements
of Col Pratt and Col Watson be made available. This request was
submitted to the Assistant Chief of Staff, Intelligence, Department of
the Army. Having received no reply or acknowledgment of the foregoing
requests, the defense on 2h Sep 69 made identical requests to the
Recorder, additionally requesting the statements of Mr. Peter Bagley
and Sgt Ortey. On 2 Oct 69, the defense submitted a list of requested
witnesses and documents. As of this date, the defense has only been
orally informed by the Recorder that requests for the availebility of
requested witnesses have been sent to their respective Commanding
Officers and that attempts are being made to make the requested docu-
ments available. No attempt has been made to answer the various
questions asked by the defense in earlier correspondence, with reference
to the omission of statements and other irregulerities which permeates
the records of this case. ‘he lack of answers corroborates the already
apparent conclusion that the investigation and subsequent proceedings
were not conducted in conformity with regulations and accepted pro-
cedurea. It is therefore requested that the defense be informed in
writing as to the present status of al2 requests made to thie dete.

5. It has been brought to the attention of the defense that Brigadier
General William H. Blakefield has disqualified himself as a member of
the Board of Inquiry. The defense objects to the disqualification of
General Blakefield on his own motion. The question of General
Blakefield's prior knowledge of this case should be determined at the
tima of the hearing. If at that time it appears that such knowledge
would result in prejudice to the Respondent, a challenge may be made.
Jt 46 therefore requested that General Blakefiela not be relieved as a
member of the Board. It is further requested that the defense be
provided with the reasons for General, Blakefield's action, any and all
information, to include the source thereof, which accounts for his prior
knowledge of this case and information as to any official actions which
he had taken with respect to the allegations against LIC Herlihy.
