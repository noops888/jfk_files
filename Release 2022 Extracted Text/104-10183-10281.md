SUBJECT

: Identi-Kie

Going over the various debriefing reports on AlMUG-l,

it would appear that the defector has

an excellent memory

and a faculty for being able to describe physical character-

istles of many persons he has met but without being able to

remember their names. Tho cases in point are the vella

and the tiberon. It occurs to us that possibly thought

should be given to using the Identi-kit as a neans of getting

pictorial description of persons whose nanes the agent

loes not recall but whose descriptions are still with nia.
