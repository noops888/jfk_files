2022 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992

Vladimir KUZNETSOV is Vladimir Nikolayevich KUZNETSOV

who arrived in Brussels in early October 1976 as First Secretary

in the Soviet Embassy. Served as cultural attache and first

secretary in The Hague July 1971 - early September 1974.

KUZNETSOV

While Cultural Attache KUZNETSOV is not

an identified KGR officer,

he is certainly suspect either as an I.n. or a co-optee. He re-

placed a KGB co-optee and is frequently observed in

the company of

known KGB officers.

It goes without saying that his position affords

him numerous opportunities to make contacts of all sorts:

2. We do not believe the evidence cited by the Station (The Hague)

in paragraph two of Reference is strong enough to consider Cultural

Attache KUZNETSOV a suspect intelligence officer or cooptee.

KUZ -

NETSOV's replacing a Soviet

who was suspected of heing a KGR cooptee

does not make KUZNETSOV himself suspect, and although he has been

frequently observed in the Netherlands

with known KGR officers, we

note that Reference cites

two instances of association with the pre-

sumed GRU Resident, I. N. ANISIMOV.

In short

we helieve it prema-

to attempt to

draw any conclusions at all about KUZNETSOV's in-

telligence status, and concur with[SYMPATHIZER'S not including him in

the preseumed KGP

Residency.
