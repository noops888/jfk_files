Defection Progran

when I phoned CO38 this AY, she iniorned te that she had heard over

the radio last night that Luis BUCH and two other cunctionaries had arrived

in Fey iest, and that a great emotional scene had ensued.

The broadcast

also indicated tht BUCH had been working with the underground.

2. I have inforned both FI and PROF. Save Phillips was interested since

he had been told by some "high authority" in WAVE not to resease anything

on the defection at this time.

He also eaid that they knew the identities

of the "2 other functionaries" but hadn't released the names.

3. The broadcast was called:
