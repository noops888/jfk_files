his internal security a, ainst counter-r-voluticnary forces inside
Cuba. The riiitis arr being usec to search houses for concesled
weapons (ustaily by a hlock system), and anyone failing to produce
proper identification 43 removed for questicning by the PiFR.

Hence, AVSUNG-1 ani bis organizatiin are largely confining thoir
activities to the duylicht hours from 0700 to 2000 haurs. He
considers night operaticns = particularly on the st:ects of Havana =
as highly dangerous inasmuch as the °J-it (security orrsns) are -
censtantly on the alert to stop individuals cn the street to check

their identification decuments.

being used for safehouse raintenance, travel expenses, purchase of

subsoquent Cuban gov rnsent following the overthrow of the Castro H
rogine. In hie opinion, AiY poses a seri-us threat to VAXTNA'S

hh. Tony Varona and the FRD: Although APKUNG-1 reccenizes the neod
to support the FAD as a political front for rallying counter- ‘
mvoluticnary grou-s against the Castro r-ri~e, he nnetneless
feels that the FRENTE and Tony Vii(NA h.ve lost ecnsiderable face
j 4n Cuba by inaction and political maneuv- ring. He further pointed
‘out that he 4e avare that thousands of dollars fad been poured into
the FRe«Ii, but dissident groups in Cuba hve scen no evidence of
of this money to sup ort their efforts to cverthrow Castro.
Hence, ccnfidence in the F!D Se at a relatively low ebb omcny the
