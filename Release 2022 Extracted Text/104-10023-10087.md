1. INTRODUCTION

‘The 201 system provides a method for identifying a person of specific in-
terest to the Operations Directorate and for controlling and filing all pertinent
information about that petson, The system also provides a means for identifying
subjects of 201 files from various categories of information about them and for
producing lisits of-201 personalities according to those categories. Only a rela-
tively small number of personalities indexed are of sufficient interest to justify
opening 2 201 dossier. These are normally subjects of extensive reporting and
CI investigation, prospective agents and sources, members of groups and organi-
zations of continuing target’ interest, or subjects on whom a volume of corre-
spondence has accumulated.

2. THE 201 SYSTEM

‘The principal features of the 201 system are:

a. The 201 Number: a unique number, i.e., 201-1934567, assigned to each
individual in the system to serve as identifying file number for reporting on that
individual.

b. The 201 Dossier: the official file containing the 201 opening form (Form -- | ->
831) and all biographic reporting on and references to the individual, ie., pee-
sonal history, current status, and prospects. _ :

 @. The Master 201 Recorid: & machine redord generated by the opéniig oF -
201 file. This record produces the master 201 refererice for the Main Index and
stores the pertinent information which may later be retrieved! for special listings.

d. Main Index Master 801 Reference: this reference, printed in reply to an
Index Search Request, is printed as ilhistrited below. When data aro absent
within the record, succeeding data items or lines will be moved up and the ref-
erence consolidated. a o oue0

€. OF Code: a two letter symbol used in coajunction with the BOI ‘per.
sonality records in the 201 system to record the association of an individual
with organizations or activities of operational interest. OI codes cover intelli-
gence and security service affiliation, whether staff or agent, or known or
suspect, as well as activities of DDO interest. There are two categories of OL
codes for use by components:
(1) general OI codes (Attachment 4)

(2) OI codes assigned to a specific component for intelligence services
or other specific organizations.
‘A component may request an OI code be established by submitting a mem-

orandum to the DDO/RMO through the component Records Management
Officer.

A201 personality may be assigned two OI codes. An OI code may be assigned
‘when the 201 Personality File Action Request (Form 831) is initiated (see
paragraph 3b below) by filling in Box 13 or a code may be assigned or added
ata later date by a Form 831 amendment.

The 201 system has the capability of producing machine listings of 201
personalities by OI codes. For example, if an OI code has been opened for the
security service of a certain country a listing may be compiled of all members
of that service. .

f, 201 Machine Lists: produced from the mechanized 201 Index, based on

names or other identifying information of personalities on whom 201 dossiers
exist.

3. OPENING A 201 DOSSIER

‘ponent, in coordination with the Information Services Group. An opening creates

ment of a cryptonym to 2 201 personality. Attachment 3 consists of sample

a Purging

Purging a 201 dossier is the responsibility of the desk officer. It requires
discrimination in recognizing operationally useful material, rather than the
simple distinction between official and unofficial papers; it will therefore take
place under the supervision of a Records Officer. Purging should be done
periodically. A 201 dossier being forwarded to Central Files for retention should
be purged. A 201 dossier should be purged of the following:

(1) Duplicate material, i.c., exact copy(s) of a document.

B (2) Name trace form (Form 362) unless it has been the basis for
the opening.

(3) All abstract slips,
(4) All document restriction notices (Form 1884).

(8) The disseminated version of positive intelligence information if
a copy of the raw report is contained in the 201 file; the dissemination number
then must be transferred to the first page of the raw report.

(8) Routing slips, routing and record sheets (Form 610) and dispatch
cover sheets unless there are remarks such as coordinations or comments.

(71) Record copy documents which only repeat substantive information
contained in other documents in the file; authorization for destruction is
by the Records Officer.

(8) Top Secret documents are not to be retained in-a 201 dossier
forwarded to Central Files; the document must be downgraded for retention
in the 201 dossier. To downgrade a Top Secret document, an authorized
officer in the originating office or the Records Officer having jurisdiction
over the contents of the material must possess Top Secret. classification. ~

(4) A 201 dossier previously opened on a person who becomes a staff
employee and whieh contains Record Copy documents will be restricted to
the ISG/DIP unless the desk retains the restriction. The dossier should be
closed if there are no Record Copy documents in it.

(5) A 201 opened in pseudonym should be consolidated into the true
name 201 if one exists or converted to the true name.

(6) Field and duplicate (shadow):201 files no longer of active interest
should be incorporated into the official 201 after the duplicate material
has been purged by the desk officer and the remaining information classified
to that 201 by the Analysis Section (IP/AN).

OPC (Office of Policy Coordination) cover sheet from thd Archives and
Disposition Section (IP/ARD) must be retumed to IP/ARD for processing
to the 201.
