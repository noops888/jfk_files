The Fresident of the United Stutes i Auerica, John I Kennedy was

assassing-ad by lee I Oswald iy direct order os the government oi

the Peoples Republic of China. Lee H Oswald executed the act elore

but there ras helpers and reserv. "Fow all is over" nas password

to his customers. Oswald was a fully convinced Communist but be

must assassinate Kennedy. We etablised contact with Oswald already

when he was in sowiet but then to try to get him as a

spy for China.

Later he ras spy for us. When Lee E Osrald had returned fo USA ve

cuntacteu sun anew dou iresteded up his minù "you have beed a spy

for us" and told him what could happen to him if FBI got informed.

Son we had him. He got his last information in lexico. /It was not

good to assassinate Kennedy in iexico/ "Pair Play for Cuba" was

started only to confuse and throw the blame on Castro lor the as-

ssassinates. Our government thought that USA should attack Cuba

when Kennedy was murded as the orgiraztion was behind the assassin-

ation. Then Caba was attacted by US: Sowiet rust help Castro defend

bimself. I: that was so it would burden Sowiet that Oswald had visi-

ted. He should be allieted with Soniet then we would ast them for a-

bombs and toey should not be able to refuse us. He and Sowiet should

win this wet and whole the world should be Communistic. Ther we should

assassinate frustjer and other Soriet leadors and me would be leader

of the NEY Da. Then this letter wiil reach you they have malied

away with me and all that knowes the planes. This letter is outsnuggled

from our Embassy in Stookholm where the Embassy is achinese spy-shool.

Hy name is 3y0 Ilang Tuan. Officer in the department. for State-secret.

If you do not bolive this letter expleis our hate to use.
