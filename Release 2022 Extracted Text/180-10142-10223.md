His personnel papers contain the following assessment: “Subject

official of government who is not in sympathy with aims of

international Communism and #6 is interested in strengthening

ties between Cuba and U.S. (CIA/DDO, Ray Vol I,

Not everyone in the CIA who re were in agreemen

with this assessment. In a Memo for Record dated 11/21/60,

Ray in November 1960 stated that his political posture was
doubtful as far as U.S. Government acceptance is concerned.

Still another Memo for Record states that Ray's action all
seemed directed toward making him the future power in Cuba

rather than overthrowing Castro. (CIA/DDO, Ray Vol V, Memo

for Record, 2 June 1961, Subject: Relations with Manolo Ray
and the MRP from Gans A. noey) The memo further pointed out
that it was believed Ray was so far "left" in his thinking
that he would be as dangerous (or more so in the long run)

to U.S. interests as Castro, if he ever got to be a power in

Cuba. (Ibid)

Ray made his | position very clear during a

private meeting with a CIA officey on November 15, 1960." (@en/pbo, :
Ray Vol II, Cable to Director frém MASH) He said the MRP did
not wish to reinstate the 1940/Cuban Constitution and that

Ray Vol IV, Memo for Record, 27 March 1961 by Gerald Droller,

resisted joining the CRC because he felt the members were
too restrained and he did not want to become a part of a
situation in which someone else was running the show for the
exiles. (HSCA #04fo05, Memo to G. Robert Blakey, 6/28/78,

“The Western Hemisphere division of the CIA received
worgj in April 1964 that in the late 1940's, Ray had been
closely associated with a-known Puerto Rican Communist and
was friendly with the Puerto Ricans who were working on the
rennovation of the White House and the group that tried to
assassinate President Truman. (CIA/DDO, Ray - Assorted
documents, Dispatch to Deputy Chief WH/SA from Chief of
Station, JMWAVE, 14 April 1964 in Mexico, D.F.) The source
of this information was referred to by cryptonym and when a
HSCA researcher requested the identify of the individual in
ApRerIcTse8, the CIA indicated that he was a “current asset"
of theixs and his identity-could not be revealed. This
information on Ray was dissiminated to the Secret Service

activities from U.S. territory, the CIA made a final payment
to Ray's group of $75,000 for the period of 1 October - 31 Dec.
