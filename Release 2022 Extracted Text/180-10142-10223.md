In the Summer of 1960, aRay was actively recruited

by the CIA to become a member of the ERD, approaches being

made through Raul Chibas. (CIA/DDO, Ray Vol I) Ray's back-

ground was questioned by the State Department. (CIA/DDO Ray

His personnel papers contain the following assessment: "Subject

international Communism and who is interested in strengthening

Not everyone in the CIA who knew Ray were in agreement

with this assessment. In a Memo for Record dated 11/21/60,

it was reported that, "...Ray did not politically represent

anything to cheer about." (CIA/DDO Ray Vol II, Memo for Record,

11/21/60, Subject: Meeting with King and Esterline on Subject

of Handling MRP) Another CIA officer who met privately with

Ray in November 1960 stated that his political posture was

doubtful as far as U.S. Government acceptance is concerned.

Still another Memo for Record states that Ray's action all

seemed directed toward making him the future power in Cuba

rather than overthrowing Castro. (CIA/DDO, Ray Vol V, Memo

for Record, 2 June 1961, Subject: Relations with Manolo Ray

and the MRP from (James A. NOel)

The memo further pointed out

that it was believed Ray was so far "left" in his thinking

that he would be as dangerous (or more so in the long run)

to U.S. interests as Castro, if he ever got to be a power in

Cuba. (Ibid)

Ray made his polftical position very clear during a

private meeting with a CIA officer on November 15, 1960' ICIA/DO,

not wish to reinstate the
