THE 201 SYSTEM:

“Rescission: Annex B of Chapter II, CSHB 70-1-T, 27 October 1966

1, INTRODUCTION

The 201 system provides a method for identifying a person of specific in-
terest to the Operations Directorate and for controlling and filing all pertinent
information about that person. The system also provides a means for identifying
subjects of 201 files from various categories of information about them and for
producing lisits of 201 personalities according to those categories. Only a rela-

_tively' small number of personalities indexed are of sufficient interest to justify
opening a 201 dossier. These are normally subjects of extensive reporting and
CI investigation, prospective agents and sources, members of groups and organi-
zations of continuing target interest, or subjects on whom a volume of” corre-
spondence has accumulated.

2. THE 201 SYSTEM

The principal features of the 201- system are:

a. The 201 Number: a unique number, ie., 201-1234567, assigned to each
individual in the system to serve as'identifying file number for reporting on that
individual.

b, The 201 Dossier: the official file containing the 201 opening form (Form
831) and all biographic reporting on and references to the individual, ie., per-
sonal history, current status, and prospects.

A ¢. The Master 201 Record: a machine record generatéd by the opening of
- a 201 file. This record produces the master 201 reference for the Main Index and
stores the pertinent information which may later be retrieved for special stings.

d. Main Index Muster 201 Reference: this reference, printed in reply to an
Index Search Request, is printed as illustrated below. When data are absent
within the record, succeeding data items or lines witl be moved up and the ref-
erence ‘consolidated.

e. OI Code: 2 two letter symbol used in conjunction with the 201 per-
sonality records in the 201 system to record: the association of an individual
with organizations or activities of operational interest. OI codes cover intelli-
gence and security service affiliation, whether staff or agent, or known or
suspect, as‘well as activities of DDO interest. There are two categories of OI
codes for use. by components: Loe se

(1) general OI codes (Attachment 4)

(2) OT codes assigned to a specific component for intelligence services
or other specific organizations.
A component may request an OI code be established by submitting a mem-

orandum to the DDO/RMO through the component Records Management
Officer.

‘A201 personality niay be assgtied two OL codes. An OF code may be assigned
ted (see

paragraph 3b below) by filling in Box 13 or a code may be’ assigned or added

ata later date by a Form 831 amendment. : ;

The 201 system has the capability ‘of producing’ machine listings of 201°
personalities by OI codes. For example, if an OI code has been opened for the
security service of a certain country a listing may be compiled of all members
of that service.

f. 201 Machine Lists: produced from the mechanized 201 Index, based on
names or other identifying information of personalities on whom 201 dossiers
exist.

3. OPENING A 201 DOSSIER.
a. General

The opening of a 201 dossier is the prerogative of an operational com-
ponent; in coordination with the Information Services Group. An opening creates
a master 901 record. Changes to the master record and the occasional closing
of a 201 dossier are controlled jointly by the desks and ISC. 201 dossiers may be
opened on persons who meet the carding criteria described in Chapter II of this
handbook, when there is a reasonable expectation that additional information
will be acquired and filed in such a dossier. Generally dossiers are opened a ,
persons about whom counterintelligence information is being reported, and per-
ms of operational interest to the Operations Directorate, specifically those
persons for whom provisional operational: approvals and operational approvals
quested (see exception below), 201 files are not to be opened on stait
yyees, staff agents and most categories of contract employees. Files on

and on whom no DDO records correspondence exists are not a part of the DDO
records systém and are to be maintained by that unit, Some desks levy require- *
ments on ISG for automatic 201 openings on cértain categories of persons whose »
names appear in incoming dispatches. These are listed in Attachment 2. 201

(1) Subjects of provisional operational approval and a ap-
proval requests. However, a file need not be opened when a POA is requested
for persons being trained for a foreign liaison service and who are of opera-
‘tional interest for training purposes only.

(2) Persons for whom the field requests a 201 opening,

(3) MHFIXTURE personalities: bonafide diplomats of other than

__(4) Subjects of a Personal Record Questionnaire Part I.

(8) Persons on whom a Main Index search reveals information in five
or more documents (see DOI 70-20).

(6) Subjects of Interagency Source Register memoranda from LSN/

b. Requesting a 201 File Opening

Headquarters desks may open a 201 file by filling ont and submitting
a 201 Personality File Action Request (Form 831) to the Records Main-
tenance Section (IP/RMS). Form 831 is also used to create or amend the
master 201 record and 201 machine listings and to register the assign-
ment of a cryptonym to a 201 personality. Attachment 3 consists of sample
201 Persouality File Action Requests for opening and amending 20I's. A field
station may request the opening of a 201 file by writing 201- in the Head-
quarters file or cross-reference box on the dis the
subjéct’s name in the body of the dispatch. A telepoxch request for a 201 opening
is made by indicating 201- in the file number line, A cable request is made by
placing 201- after the term. “File” on the last line of the transmission. IP/AN

a. Purging

Purging a 201 dossier is the responsibility of the desk officer. It. requires
discrimination in recognizing operationally useful material, rather than the
simple distinction between official and unofficial papers, it will therefore: take
place under the supervision of a Record’ Officer. Purging should be done
periodically. A 201 dossier being forwarded to Central Files for retention should
be purged. A 201 dossier should be purged of the following:

(1) Duplicate material, ie., exact copy(s) of a document.
- (2) Name trace form (Form 362) unless it has been the basis for
the opening. ve te .
“ (3) All abstract slips,
. (4) All document restriction notices (Form 1884). ~

(5) The disseminated version of- positive intelligence information if
a copy of the raw report is contained in the 201 file; the dissemination number
then must be transferred to the first page of the raw report.

(6) Routing slips, routing and record sheets (Form 610) and dispatch
. cover sheets unless there are remarks such as coordinations or comments,

(7) Record copy documents which only repeat substantive information
contained in other documents in the file; authorization for destruction is
by the Records Officer.

(8) Top Secret documents are not to be retained in a 201 dossier
forwarded to Central Files; the document must be downgraded for retention
in the 201 dossier. To downgrade a Top Secret document, an authorized
officer in the originating office or the Records Officer having jurisdiction
cover the contents of the material must possess Top Secret classification
authority. If the document cannot be downgraded the file should be retained
at the desk or the copy of the TS document should be removed, retained
in a desk TS file or forwarded to the Top Secret Control Officer, and a
cross-reference sheet (Form 867) placed in the 201 file giving the location

of the TS document.
