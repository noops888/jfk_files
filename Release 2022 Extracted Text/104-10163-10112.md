Please investigate status, take appropriate remedial steps

and advise.

REF: WAVE 9311, 14 July 1964

Prior to his current trip for training, AMCLATTER/1

requested permission to make a stopover in IrMETAL on his return

to JHAVE to inquire about the status of his citizenship.

offered instead to have the matter looked into during his train-

ing course and then,

if there was anything his presence in

ZRuETAL could accomplish,

to have arrangements made for appropriate

contacts.

To this end he submitted a memorandum outlining his

recollection of the history of his case. It is paraphrased 1n

sterile form below.

In 1949-50,

for approximately 16 months, I worked

1n Identity A.

Before taking the appointment I consulted with

Identity B, who warned me that I was endangering my citizenship,

but also promised to help in case of trouble because I had offered

• to cooperate fully with ODEARL. It so happened that I quickly

worked my way up to the rank of Sergeant and was detailed to llaison

with ODYOKE agencies.

This facilitated my volunteering information

not normally given in liaison contacts,

and even my fulfilling of

requirements levied by them, particularly ODEARL and ODACID.

b. I belleve that it must have been Identity C who

made the charge that deprived me of my citizership on the techn

cality that to have achieved my rank and position I nust be

considered a PBRUJEN citizen.

Identity C and I had crossed

swords over a Irt.-d of mine

who had beer refused a rEPriMe visa.

Later Identity C was fired for having beta involved in a visa

selling racket.

UFGA-16973

Ijentity B was very

sympathetic and arranged to

have my suit for reinstatement take: by Identity D which handled

most ODYOKE legal business locally.

In 1951 Identity D referred

my case to a ZRMSTAL law firm whose name I cannot recall exactly

but which initiated legislative action

¿ travelled to

to lobby on my own behalf, and was able to speak

with identity & who promised to make a favorable recommendation.

Travel costs and other problems prevented my following up,

however, and nothing ever came of the bill as far as I know.

d.

In 1959 Icentity D called me and told me that my

services would be needed again in view of the Communist tendencies

of the ANTHUG-1 regime.

I agreed to cooperate without hesitation,

and was introduced to Identity F, KUBARK Chief of Station, who

assigned me to lientity G.

Together we organized a group to

Infiltrate the PBRUMEN government.

I was evacuated to the JMHAVE

area with my family in the fall of 1960, and was met by Identity

the course of my relations with him and Identity I, I was

promised that my citizenship status would be inquired into

officially, and that my service to KUBARK would resolve any doubts

that might have existed in the case.

In the summer of 1961, I decided in sheer desperation

to drive to ZrMETAl and to ask Identity. I for direct hels in the

citizenship matter.

My JAWAVE contacts, I explained, clained that

there was no record of my quest for citizenship reinstatement.

Identity I sent someone to take notes on my case, and also intro-

duced me to Identity J as my next supervisor in the JiAVE area.

Identity J later advised me that my file had been mislaid, hit

that the case was being reactivated.

In March 196k, cover business provided an opportunity

or me to leave the. country long enough to re-enter with a

permanent residence visa.

At that time I was told by the Immi-

gration officer (to my dismay) that my five-year waltin; period for

citizenship would begin on the date of my re-entry.

On another

cover trip in April 1963,

I met Identity k who said that he could

not believe that my citizenship had not been

reinstated by that

time.

He said that he and identity I had been given to understand

that 1t was all taken care of.

I wish to make the record clear that I have never

appliod for citizenship in ady other country; that I did everything

possible under the above circumstances to maintain my PBPRIME

citizenship; that I tried by every means avallable to have my

citizenship reinstated after I learned that 1t had been taken

ne cuithout a hearing, by the way); and that the peaumes passport

used in my evacuation was procured only alter assurances from

Idontity # that the action would not have an adverse effect upon

attempts is relnstate my citizenship.

It woliid be appreclated 11 Headquarters could find some

Way of expoultire ANCiATIEnlis caBo.

Bringing this prodicamont to

a satisfactory conclusion would rolleve him of a personal dilemma

which might weigh heavily to the dotriment of his operational

effectiveness:

Any questions or instructions on the mattor up unt1l

20 August should he referred to

ANCLATTIS-I through nio tiaiiing

case siiicer (note relerence and provious correspondence jor train-
