: WAVE 9311, 14 July 1964

1, Prior to his current trip for training, AMCLATTER/1 : f
requested permission to make a stopover in 2#METAL on his return -
to JMWAVE to inquire about the status of his citizenship, We :
offered instead to have the matter looked into during his ‘train-
ing course and then, if there was anything his presence in 7
ZRMETAL could accomplish, to have arrangements made for appropriate :
contacts, To this end he submitted a memorandum outlining his

recollection of the history of his case, It is paraphrased in
sterile form below,

a. In 1949-50, for approximately 16 months, I worked
in Identity A, Before taking the appointment I consulted with

Identity B, who warned me that I wae endangering my citizenship, i
but also promised to help in case of trouble because I had offered
- to cooperate fully with ODEARL, It so happened that I quickly in
Worked my way up to the rank of Sergeant and was detailed to liaison !
.With ODYOKE agencies, This facilitated ny volunteering information
not normally given in liaison contacts, and even my fulfilling of -
requirements levied by them, particularly ODEARL and ODACID,

et
b. I believe that it must have been Identity C who 8
made the charge that deprived me of my citizenship on the techni-

cality that to have achieved my rank and Position I mst be

considered a PBRUMEN citizen, Identity C and I had crossed

Swords over a fricrd of mine who had beer refused a PEPRIME visa,

Later Identity C was fired for having beea involved in a visa
selling racket.

. DISPATCH

..¢e IJentity B was very sympathetic and arranged to
have my suit for reinstatement take:. by Identity D which handled
most ODYOKE legal business locally. In 195] Identity D referred
my case to a ZRaM&TAL law firm whose name I cannot recall exactly
but which initiated: legislative action for me, 1% travelled to
ZRMETAL once, to lobby on my own behalf, and-was able to speak
with Identity E who promised to make a favorable recommendation, i
Travel costs and other problems’ prevented. my following up, -
however, and nothing ever came of the bill as far as I know,

d. In 1959 Icentity D called me and told me that my

services would be needed again in view of the Communist tendencies i
of the AMTHUG-1 regime, I agreed to cooperate without hesitation,

and was introduced to Identity F, KUBARK Chief of Station, who

assigned me to Icentity G. Together we organized a group to
infiltrate the PBRUMEN government, I was evacuated to the JMWAVE
area with my family in the fall of 1960, and was met by Identity
He In the course of my relations with him and Identity I, I was
promised thet my citizenship status would be inquired into

officially, and that my service to KUBARK would resolve any doubts :
that. might have existed in the case,

e, In the summer of 1961, I decided in sheer desperation
to drive to ZRMETAL and to ask Identity.I for direct help in the ’
7 citizenship matter. My JMWAVE contacts, I explained, claimed that -
there was no record of my quest for citizenship reinstatement. -
Identity I sent someone to take notes on my case, and also intro-
duced me to Identity J as my next supervisor in the JMWAVE area,
Identity J later advised me that my file had been mislaid, rut
that the case was being reactivated,

f, In March 1962, cover business provided an opportunity
for me to leave the. country long enough to re-enter with a 7
permanent residence visa. At that time I was told by the Immi-
gration officer (to my dismay) that my five-year waitin; period for i
‘citizenship would begin on the date of my re-entry, On another

cover trip in April 1963, I met Identity K who said that he could

not believe that my citizenship had not been reinstated by that 1
time, He said that he and Identity I had been given to understand re
that it was all taken care of, '

“ ge I wish to make the record clear that I have never
appliod for citizenship in any other country; that I did everything
possible undex the above circumstances to maintain my PBPRIME
citizenship; that I tried by every means available to have my |
citizenship reinstated after I learned that it hed been taken fren
we (without a hearing, by the way); and thet the PRRUMEN passport
used in my evacuation was procured only after:sassurances from
Identity 7 that the action would not have an adverse effect upon
attempts <o reinstate ny citizenship,

2. It sould be appreciated 1f Headquarters could find some |
Way o2 expediting ANCLATTER-~1*s case, Bringing this predisamant to z
a@ satisfactory convlusion would relieve him of a personal dilemma
which might weigh heavily to the datriment of his operational
effectiveness, Any questions or instructions on the matter up until
20 August should ha referred to AMCLATTFR~1 through fs: tradning
ease stficer (uote refersice and previous correspondence for train-
ning cite),

AMCLATTER~1's posession are also forwarded under wy cover,
