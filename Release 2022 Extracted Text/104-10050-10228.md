Mexico Station Coverage of Soviet and Cuban Embassies (1963)

From the time the Mexico Station was opened in April 1947 nti)”

the arrival of Mr. Win Scott as Chief of Station in 1955, the Station had
developed a support apparatus to exploit leads from the Soviet Embassy in
Mexico City. This umbrella type project (LIPSTI ERvrec of multiline
phone taps, three photographic sites, a magn team and a

mail intercept operation.

of Tines tapped way only by the availability of a listening post a

nearby and the availability of langauge (English, Spanish, Soviet, Porat :

Czech, etc.) transcribers. Generally, these were Mexican or Mexican~

- American recruited agents.

Three photographic sites were’ handled by a Station case officer

+ assisted by technicians on TDY from Headquarters who advised the Station

on the best types of cameras, films, and concealment devices. These
operations had sub-crypts under project LIPSTICK (namely: LIMITED, LILYRIC
and LICALLA). LIMITED was a fixed site directly opposite the Soviet Em-
bassy (across the street) which had both a vehicle and a pedestrian en-

trance. The gate to the Soviet Embassy was on the northwest corner of the

Soviet compound and the LIMITED site was diagonally across a double laned
street on the southeast corner of that block. (See attached diagram).
LIMITED was the first photo base and operated strictly on an experimental
basis in the early stages. This base, however, was closed when the Sta-
tion received word that the photograph of the “unidentified man" was
being released by the Warren Commission. LILYRIC was an alternate photo-
* graphic base. It was located in an upper story of an apartment building
on the same side of the street as the LIMITED site ss eye middle of
s the block south. It had a planted view of tl ms of the Soviet
Embassy. LICALLA, the third mrotograaRe a fas located in one of a
row of four houses on the “ag jthe Soviet Embassy compound.
This site overlooked oY we of the Soviet Embassy compound. The
purpose of this coe was to get good identification photographs of
Soviet personnel. The three photographic sites were, managed by a re-
cruited agent who was a Mexican citizen, the son of an American mother
and Mexican father (deceased). This agent collected the film from the
LIMITED and LILYRIC sites three times a week. The film was then de-
veloped and printed into 8.x 10:contact print strips. LICALLA film was
originally processed in the Station but in early 1959, due to the resig-
nation of a technician, this film like that of LIMITED and LILYRIC was

processed on the outside by a recruited agent.

Mobile surveillance was conducted by two American staff officers.
These two officers organized a surveillance team of six recruited agents
which used late model cars and a panel truck for surveillance. The team
could be activated by radio from the LIMITED site whenever. someone of
interest left the gate of the Soviet Embassy. These agents were aware of
the LIMITED site since they had been issued LIMITED photographs for
identification purposes.

The Station also conducted a unilateral m = operation,
LIBIGHT, which was handled by an American ca; . A recruited
Mexican agent, who had a senior a

connected at one time. The transcription room was staffed by Mexican

Army officers. In 1961, because of mismanagement by the Mexican prin-

cipals, the Station chief, himself, became the project case officer. A i
Station officer assisted him in the daily supervision of the listening :
post, and in picking up the transcripts and the tapes. There was also

an American technician inside the listening post. }

conversations of interest which were then included-in a daily resume
for the Chief of Station. Later, when a reel was completely recorded,
full transcripts were typed and passed to the Station; however, there

27 September 1963, Sovict Embassy Chancery 15-61-55

Item 295, page 3

At 1626 hours, A Soviet calls from the Soviet Embassy Chancery
to the Cuban Consulate and asks for Sylvia DURAN. He asks

DURAN if

the american has been there.

DURAN: Yes, he is still here.

SOVIET:

DURAN:
SOVIET:

According to the letters that he showed them from the (Soviet)
Consulate in Washington, he wants to go to the USSR to stay
a long time with his wife who is Russian, but also the
answer had not been received (by him) regarding his problem.
That accordingly these transactions take 4 or 5 months but
without prior approval from the USSR, they have to request
and even then, they could not issue the visa hene(in Mexico
City) without asking Washington. Yet accordingly’, this man
(the American), “: showed him a letter inmwhich he” (the
American) is a member of an organizatidh. imfavor of Cuba
and said that the Cubans could not pive*fint the visa without
the Russian visa and now the et “Yoesn't know what to do
with him, because he has ae ‘the answer from
Washington.

..with them also, be ste \problen with him (the American)

thinking of sing his visa, because he knew it was
going to take ‘Tong time waiting for the Russian visa in
Cuba, and then go on to the USSR.

«that the thing is that if his (the American) wife were

now in Washington (and) going to receive the visa right now
or the permission from the USSR to retum to her country, (if)
she is’ going to receive her visa in Washington, then having
this visa, she can communicate to whatever place, this
permission, for example, here or in any other place (he) can
receive it, but right now they do not have them.

is that he doesnt, \yanlyone in Cuba and in that case it
is very ia ve him a visa, because he was

..certainly and neither can (the Cubans) give him a letter

because they ‘do not know if the visa will be approved.
They can only give the visa according to instructions.

Then that is what she will put on his application.

Neither can I give him any letter of recommendation because
T-don't know him and pardon me for bothering you.

DURAN: It was no bother, thank you very much.

Item 74, page 2

An unidentified man (speaking Spanish) calls the Soviet Embassy
Consulate at 1037 hours and asks for the Consul. He is told that
the Consul is not there. The unidentified man asked what is needed
to get visas to go to Odessa. He is told to call back at 1130 hours.

Item 137, page 2

At 1235 hours a man named ALATRISTE (not a Soviet) from inside the
Soviet Embassy Consulate calls out to number 45-37-72 (Colonial
Anerica, probably a pension or hotel but number not listed in the
telephone directory) and speaks with a man named SAN ROMAN.
ALATRISTE says that he is in the Russian Embassy and they need to
know what day the boat "KALONIA" will arrive in Odessa, that the
Soviets will also need copies of the passenger manifest

(One concludes that ALATRISTE and SAN ROMAN are shipping-tepresentatives
for the boat "KALONIA", and needed routine visa informiation,’’First

a call was made to the first listing for the Soyiet.—Embassy in the
Mexican telephone directory (which turned ougatd be’ the Military Attache).
They got the phone number for the Consulate andthe address. After
making a call to the Consulate and leamming\ that it would not be open
until 1130 hours, ALATRISTE went..td@*thevaddress to get the needed
information.) Vaan

)

5 Ya
Just after 1600 hours, the Soviet Consulate received a call from the
Cuban Consulate (Sylvia DURAN) who said she had there a U.S. citizen
who had requested a transit visa to Cuba because he is going to the
USSR. DURAN wants to know with whom he spoke at the Soviet Embassy
because she sent him over to them telling him that if the Soviets
approved the visa then the Cubans would give him one without anything
more, advising the (Department of) Immigration in Cuba.’ She wants
to know with whom he spoke because he says that he doesn't know
either with what person and who told him that certainly there would
be no problem. The Soviet asks DURAN to wait a minute. After a
short wait DURAN explains the same thing to another Soviet. ‘This
Soviet tells her to leave her telephone (number) and her name and
someone will-return the call. DURAN gives her name and telephone
number 11-28-47 then says as a personal thing, she has moved and
has not advised them of a change of address so will not receive their
Bulletin and can give it to them now. The Soviet asks her to call
in order to change that address and asks for the name
of the (Cuban) Cultural Attache. DURAN says it is Teresa PROENZA
whose number is 14-13-26. The Soviet thanks her.

_Dear Dick: te

. Our efforts to answer recent informal inquiries, including some.” . ‘
‘from the White House Staff, have revealed that, though GIA and the 2
FHI have detailed records concerning Americans who have been recruited
as intelligence agents by Bloc countries, there does not appear to be

‘a complete listing of those Americans now living in Bloc countries

\ who might be called "defectors". Using the definitions of DCD h/2,

these persons might be described as those who have either been

i <, capable of providing useful intelligence to the Bloc or those whose
desire to resettle in Bloc countries has been significantly exploited ©‘ ”;'
for communist propaganda purposes. Tais would mean that no attention :
need be paid to Anericans whose resettlement within the Bloc had no
counter-intelligence implications or had attracted no particular *
attention; for instance, this definition would not cover individual ;
US citizens of East European or Chinese origin who retumed to the
Mhomeland" because they had never been completely assimilated into

) the Anerican society. '

There is attached a list of such persons, covering the last 18

had aphicontly visited the Cuban Embasay and its Consular offices .
on a number of occasions and he correctly identified some twenty

Cuban Exbassy and Consular employees,

showed that OSWALD could not possibly have been in Mexica*® >
City on 18 September (he was known to have been in New Orleans
on both 17 and 19 September), intensive interrogation failed to
shake ALVARADO!s story, However, the.Ceatral American

With regard to that, Nicareguan‘s, allegations thet the man was in the

he applied for a tourist card about the 15th of September. There is a

He was last seen by the landlady then. Now we have immigration records showing him
entering Mexico on the 26th which very strongly suggests that be was not in Mexico
