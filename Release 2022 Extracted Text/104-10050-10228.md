SU JECT:

Pelay in sending the first cable about

OSWALD

1.

Much has been written about the delay (by the Mexico

Station) ins ending the first cable reques ting traces on the

name Lee OSWALD.

It was discussed in Dave Phillips

book as

case of laziness on

the part of the Soviet case officer (which

in my

view was

unjust and unnecessary and indicates that Dave

didn't know what he

was talking about).

the Spanish transcript for the 1 October

onvers ation would have been picked up on

the morning of. the

2nd of October.

Ihe Russian language portion

would have gone

to the Russ ian/English

of-October.

Th e

translation would have

been returned the follawing day

(4th )

at which

time,

the Soviet case officer would have a ked for

he photographic coverage.

That coverage would not have been

in the station before the 7th since.

day which would have been Mgau

october.

Later the film was taken out of the camera every

day

but at that time, the film stayed in the camera until a full

roll was completed which might

take three or four days.

A name trace could have been reques ted

of the name alone but. that wasn't the way.

that

Station.

He wanted the photographic coverage tied in with the

telephone coverage ..sometimes there_was a U.S. automobile

licens e number.

It was also part of the "numbers

game" of

justify ing

a project by the number of dis patches, cables or

reports produced.

Mexico Station Coverage of Soviet and Cuban Embassies (1963)

:.:

1. Unilateral Coverage:

From the time the Mexico Station was opened in April 1947 until

the arrival of Mr. Win Scott as Chief of Station in 1955, the Station had

developed a support apparatus to exploit leads from the Soviet Embassy in

Mexico City. This umbrella type project (LIPSTICK

sisted of multiline

eillance. team and

phone taps, three

photographic sites, a

mobit

mail intercept operation.

Telephone taps (LIFEAT)

were placed by an employee of the local

telephone company who

endled by a Station case officer. The number

of lines tapped was

tited only by the availability of a listening post

nearby and the availability of langauge (English, Spanish, Soviet, Poli,

Czech, etc.) transcribers. Generally, these were Mexican or Mexican-

• American recruited agents.

Three photographic sites were handled by a Station case officer

assisted by technicians.on TDY from Headquarters who advised the Station

on the best types of cameras, films, and concealment devices. These

operations had sub-crypts under project LIPSTICK (namely: LIMITED, LILYRIC

and LICALLA). LIMITED was a fixed site directly opposite the Soviet Em-

bassy. (across the street) which had both a vehicle and a pedestrian en-

trance. The gate to the Soviet Embassy was on the northwest corner of the

street on the southeast corner of that block. (See attached diagram).

LIMITED was the first photo base and operated strictly on an experimental

basis in the early stages. This base, however, was closed when the Sta-

tion received word that the photograph of the "unidentified man" was

being released by the Warren Commission. LILYRIC was an alternate photo-

graphic base. It was located in an upper story of an apartment building

on the same side of the street as the LIMITED site bu

the middle of

the block south. It had a planted view of the

gate of the Soviet

Embassy. LICALLA, the third photograph

purpose of this oper

onawas to get good identification photographs of

Soviet personnel. The three photographic sites were managed by a re-

cruited agent who was a Mexican citizen, the son of an American mother

and Mexican father (deceased). This agent collected the film from the

LIMITED and LILYRIC sites three times a week. The film was then de-

veloped and printed

into 8 x 10 contact print strips. LICALLA film was

originally processed in the Station but in early 1959, due to the resig-

nation of a technician, this film like that of LIMITED and LILYRIC was

processed

on the outside by a recruited agent.

Mobile surveillance was conducted by two American staff officers.

These two officers organized a surveillance team of six recruited agents

which used late model cars and

a panel truck for surveillance. The team

could be activated by radio from the LIMITED site whenever someone of

interest left the gate of the Soviet Embassy.

These agents were aware of

the LIMITED site since they had been issued LIMITED photographs for

identification purposes.

officer trained a number of them in name tracing

1958, at the instigation of a Mexican official, a joint telephone

connected at one time. The transcription room was staffed by Mexican

Army officers. In 1961, because of mismanagement by the Mexican prin-

cipals, the Station chief, himself, becane the project case officer. A

Station officer assisted him in the daily supervision of the listening

post, and in picking up the transcripts and the tapes.

There was also

an American technician inside the listening post.

3. Oswald Coverage:

In mid-1962, the Mexican officer in charge of LIENVOY (the

joint tap operation) asked

the American officer at the LiENkOY listening

post for the telephone numbers of the Soviet, Cuban and satellite En-

bassies in anticipation of possible coverage:

that they would not be discov

taps. The Mexicans s

after connected five Cuban lines, five

Soviet lines, three Czech lines, two Polish lines, and one Yugoslav

line.

At the listening post, a live monitor made short summaries of

conversations of interest which were then included in a daily resume

for the Chief of Station. Later, when a reel was completely recorded,

full transcripts were typed and passed to the Station; however, there

was usually a time lag of a day or two. Reels which contained Russian

for translation and typing. Mr. Boris Tarasoff did the Russian transla-

usually ran about a week behind the date of the conversation.

As soon as the Station learned that an American identifying him-

self as Lee Oswald phoned the Soviet Embassy, Miss Ann Goodpasture of the

Station started screening all photographs. However, here

equipment using a pulse camera which frequently developed mechanical dif-

Subject:

Background on Mexico Station Support Assets

(Coverage of Soviet and Cuban Embassies)

1. Unilateral coverage. From the time the lexico Station was opened in

April 1947 (by Bill Doyle) until arrival of Win Scott as

CoS in 1955, Charles

Anderson III (still in LA/HQ) had developed a support apparatus to Frat

exploit leads from the Soviet Embassy. This unbrella type project

• (LIFEAT)

consisted of multi line phone taps, three photo sites, a mobile surveillance

team and a mail intercept operation.

a. Thone taps were placed by an employee of the telechone company

who was handled by David WILSTED (pseudo).. The number of lines

tapped was linted by availability of a Ilstening post nearby

(since the taps were not nade in the main central

send English/

Spanish (Soviet, Polish, Czech, ete)

transcribers. Generally

Were agents (nostal a vexican Averican) vere related

(which the

at that time felt was good security in that

if they

telled about shop, they would talk to each other.)

b. Three photo sites were handled by Anderson with the help

of Harry Wahoney (retired, living in Chicago) and TDY TSD

people checking the best type of canera, film, and concealment

devices. These had sub-cripts under LIFEAT (LINITED, LILYRIC,

and LICALIA). LINITED was a fixed site bang opposite across

the street from the front gate of the Soviet Embassy which had

both a vehicle and foot entrance. The Soviet gate was on the

Northl'est corner of their compound and LIMITED was diagonally

across a double barrelled street on the Southeast

that block. LIlITDD was the first base and it cheraied stristly on an

an erinental basis in the early stages. I think the lexi Station bought

one storey

this property. (a/Spanish Colorial stone house) through LINOUSLE (check to

be sure). Later this house began to fall apart. This base was closed when

the Station got word that the photo of "uniden man" was being

released

to the

public by the Warren Cormission. The photo operators were moved to another apt

nearby. The property was sold (under an operational

agreement with LIMOUSIt

for a long term lease on the top floor of a new apartment biding to be built

on this site). LILYRIC was planned es an alternate photo base to LINITED.

It was in an upper storey (3rd floor -check) on the sare side of the street

as LIITED but in the middle of the block South. It had a slanted view of

the front gate of the Soviet Enbassy. The agents in LIMITED and LILYRIC (both

lexican farilies) as far as we knew, were not acquainted with each other.

LILYRIC was a rented apartment. LICALIA, the third photo site, was located

in one of a row of four houses on the South strent the Soviet Irbassy compound

union the exoo station purchasedu a about 1958, (ckeek date), also using

I'OUS It as the surchages latece) This site overlooked the back garden of

the Soviet Embassy compourid.

The purpose of this operation vas to get good

identification photographs of the Soviet personnel (who at thet time vere largely

unidentified in Mexico Station records). The three photo sites vere handled by

Ramon Alvarez (Mexican citizen of U.S. mother who taught elecentary level at

the American School). Ramon collected the filn gallen

Kim from LIITED

and LILYRIC three times a week. His sister's husband, Carlos (Mexican doctor)

developed and printed the film into 8x10 contact print strips. The master plan

tuit

was for LIGALLA film to ve processed inside,ISD man from 1957 to 1959 (Harper

Holt - resigned) could not handle the volume and as the unprocessed film began

to accumulate, the inside Co (l'ahoney) becane disgusted and took the filn out

for Ramon's bracher-in-law to process (probatly early 1959). Thus Ramon became

the handler for all three photo bases.

This was ha:dled by Glen WIDDEN (outside ISD officer)

This worked fairly well until about the middle of 1958 (check date)

when one of the surveillance agents got too.

Of Gov: Inment.

This Ministry spent a major part of its time an control of

corrupt extortionists. Robert Melberg established contact with one of them inge

Levine De Leon (later LIFIRE group) in about 1950 or 51. He gave them some

training (a group of about five surveillance types) in travel control working

the airport as well as file searches of names fron DES Hatrs

were poorly organized and often inaccurate. How and then, however, sore useful

During 1958, Dire'Scott met socially some of the chronies of the

Mexican Fresident elect, Adolfo Lopez lateos. During this period, the v.s.

Ambassador Robert C. Hill (reflecting the policy of then Sec State J.F. Dulles)

was energetic in organizing groups to "fight cormunisn".

One of these seeds

grew into a proposal Miguel Aleman (jr. son of fomer lexi President), acting

for Lopez lateos, made to Win Scott for a joint telephone tap operation. This

project (LIENVOY) went through about four distressing years of a shakedown.

The lexican in control (LIELEGANT) was inexperienced, old, and greedy. His

son (LIEIVOY-2) was a masterpiece of deceit and corruption. LIELEGAIT also

manipulated control over the

About nid 1962 (check date) Litoy outside lext rept asted

for the telephone nunvers of the Soviet, Cuban, and Satellite Ebassies.

With this forewarning, LIFEAT (unilateral coverage) was disconnected. However,

as I recall, the Mexicans connected 5 Cuban lines, 5 Soviet lines, 3 Czech,

2 Polish, and 1 lugoslav line. The basehouse listening post had a live

monitor lino made short sunnaries of interesting conversations for a daily

resume which was

received each day arourd 8 a.n. (passed by Flick to Goodrasture

to get to Scott before 9.a.1.) Later (when the reel was conpletely recorded)

full transcripts were typed ard passed to the station in the same way, however,

there was usually a time lag of a day or so.: Those transcripts which rad

Russian or another language besides Spanish or English went out of the listening

post the day after the transcript (of other conversations.on the

reel) was

These reels were taken to another location Mere

• were translated

and typed.

In the case of the Russian translations, Boris Tarasoff usually ran

about a week behind the date of

Dongversation because of the volume of

Russian conversations

amr

de-embers of the Soviet Exibassy. During this

period (fall of 1963) the reels were probably being brought into the station

and carried to Boris by one of the people from the Soviet Section or they nay

have been carried to him by Flick but I think I brought the reel in and gave

it to Herbert Manell to take to Boris. Ferbert Manell and his wife Barbara

handled all of the processi:g of Soviet transcripts. My job involved screening

the photographs as soon as we learned that the man calling hinself Oswald was

probably an Anerican. However, here again there was a backlag because the

photos were picked up three times a week but the ones ricked up were usually

for dates a few days previously because the doctor procesed the film on a

night time basis. Photographs were made usually until one roll vas used but

later we got it changed to one day coverage on each roll - in other words the

operators, cleared the camera each day whetrer there was angrilxixes a full

roll of film exposed. Instructions were to cover office hours, photograch each

error did occur but generally the agents were conscientious.

The Cuban

embassy coverage had more sophisticatea equipient (a rulse ca:era) but it

frequently develored nechanical difficulties. Bob Zanbarnerdi and Scathar

(I think) handled this film- pick.up and delivery. Lorne lackay screeted

the film inside the station.

I am certain that the Oswald call came to our attention from the

Soviet line. It was picked u, and taken to Boris for a translation because

the caller was trying to speak Russian. Any delay was caused by waiting to

compare the photographs with the typed transcript. There were no copies of

transcricts every made in languages other than Spanish

or

lish because Win

Scott could read only those two languages ard he

27 September 1903, Sovict Embassy Chancery 15-01-55

Item 295, page 3

At 1626 hours, A Soviet calls from the Soviet Embassy Chancery

to the Cuban Consulate and asks for Sylvia DURAN.

DURAN if the american has been there.

DURAN: Yes, he

still here.

According to the letters that he showed them from the (Soviet)

in Washington, he wants to

a long time with his wife who is Russian, but also the

unswer had not been received (by him) regarding his problem.

That accordingly these transactions take 4 or 5 months but

without prior approval from the USSR, they have to request

and even then, they could not issue the visa here, (in Mexico

City) without asking Washington.

Yet accordingly this man

(the American) ,

showed him a letter in which he (the

American) is a member of an organization in favor of Cuba

and said that the Cubans could not give him the visa without

the Russian visa and now the Soviet doesn't know what to do

with him, because he has towa

Washington.

..with them

also, beca

the problem with him (the American)

is that he doesn'f

now anyone in Cuba and in that case it

is very diffig

*asgive him a visa, because he was

thinking of p

cessing his visa, because he knew it was

going to take "a" long time waiting for the Russian visa in

Cuba, and then go on to the USSR.

..that the thing is that if his (the American) wife were

now in Washington (and) going to receive the visa right now

or the permission from the USSR to return to her country, (if)

she is going to receive her visa in Washington, then having

this visa, she can communicate to whatever place, this

permission, for example, here or in any other place (he) can

receive it, but right now they do not have them.

..certainly and neither can (the Cubans) give him a letter

because they do not know if the visa will be approved.

They can only give the visa according to instructions.

Then that is what she will put on his application.

can I give him any letter of recommendation because

I don't know him and pardon me for bothering you.

It was no bother, thank you very much.

27 September 1963, Soviet Embassy Consulatc 15-60-55

Item 74, page 2

An unidentified man (speaking Spanish) calls the Soviet Embassy

Consulate at 1037 hours and asks for the Consul. He is told that

the Consul is not there.

The unidentified man asked what is needed

to get visas to

go to Odessa. He is told to call back at 1130 hours.

Item 137, page 2

At 1235 hours a man named ALATRISTE (not a Soviet) from inside the

Soviet Embassy Consulate

calls out to number 45-37-72 (Colonial

America, probably a pension or hotel but number not listed in the

telephone directory)

and speaks with a man named SAN ROMAN.

ALATRISTE says that he is in the Russian Embassy and they need to

know what day the boat "KALONIA" will arrive in Odessa, that the

Soviets will also need copies of the passenger manifest.

(One concludes that ALATRISTE and SAN ROMAN are shipping representatives

for the boat "KALONIA", and needed routine visa information, First

a call was made to the

first listing for the Soviet Embassy in the

Mexican telephone directory (which turned outata be the Military Attache).

They got the phone number for the Consulate and the address.

making a call' to the Consulate and learning that it would not be open

until 1130 hours, ALATRISTE went to theraddress to get the needed

information.)

• Item 395, pages 7 and 8

Just after 1600 hours,

the Soviet Consulate

received a call from the

Cuban Consulate (Sylvia DURAN) who said she had there a U.S. citizen

who had requested a transit visa to Cuba because he is going to the

USSR. DURAN wants to know with whom he spoke at the Soviet Embassy

because she sent him over to them telling him that if the Soviets

approved the visa then the Cubans would give him one without anything

more, advising the (Department of) Immigration in Cuba.

She wants

to know with whom he spoke because he says that he doesn't know

either with what person and who told him that certainly there would

be no problem.

The Soviet asks DURAN to wait a minute.

After a

short wait DURAN explains the same thing to another Soviet.

This

Soviet tells her to leave her telephone (number) and her name and

someone will return the call. DURAN gives her name and telephone

number 11-28-47 then says as a personal thing, she has moved and

has not advised them of a change of address

so will not receive their

Bulletin and can give it to them now.

The Soviet asks her to call

KOUKHARENKO in order to change that address and asks for the name

of the (Cuban) Cultural Attache.

DURAN says it is Teresa PROENZA

whose number is 14-13-26.

The Soviet thanks her.

Prior to November 22, 1963

ALF:

10.

This refers to your letter of February 12, 1964

addressed to the Director of Central Intelligence which has

been passed to me for reply.

Paragraph three of your letter requested the Agency

"to supply the Commission with a report on information in the

Agency's possession regarding Lee Harvey OSWALD prior to

November 22, 1963. The request was predicated upon the

footnote on page two of CIA's report to the Commission dated

31 January 1964, entitled: "Information Developed by CIA on

the Activity of Lee Harvey OSWALD in Mexico City, 28 Sep=

tember = 3 October 1963".

3. There is attached an exact reproduction of the

Agency's official dossier on Lee Harvey OSWALD beginning

with the opening sheet dated 9 December 1960. The entire

dossier carries the security classification of Secret and

consists of thirty documents arranged in chronological order.

On the basis of clearances from the Federal Bureau of

Investigation, the Department of State, the Department of

Navy, and the Immigration and Naturalization Service, who

were queried by us after the receipt of your letter, we are

able to make available exact copies, of all materials in the

file up to early October 1963.

THE DIRECTOR OF INTELLIGENCE AND RESEARCH

SECRET

OCT 25 1960

Dear Dick:

Our efforts to answer recent informal inquiries, including some

from the White House Staff, have revealed that, though CIA and the

FET have detailed records concerning Americans who have been recruited

as Intelligence agents by Blos countries,

there does not appear to be

a complete. listing of those Americans now living in Bloc countries

who might be called "defectors".

Using the definitions of DCID 4/2,

these. persons might be described as those who have either been

capable of proviaing usciul intelligence to the Bloc or those whose

desire to resettle in Bloc countries has been significantly exploited

for communist propaganda purposes.

This would mean that no attention

need be paid to Americans whose resettlement within the Bloc had no

counter-intelligence implications or had attracted no particular

attention; for instance, this definition would not cover individual

US citizens of East European or Chinese origin who returned to the

"homeland"

because they had never been completely assimilated into

the American society.

There is attached a list of such persons, covering the last 18

months, and it would be appreciated if the Agency could verify and

possibly expand this list for the use of interested Bureaus of, the

Department.

Sincerely yours,

And

Hugh S, Cumming, JI.

ALVARADO was knowa to CIA 23 a former informani of a Central

American security service and to have beon uscà to pencuate

communist guerrilla groups. He said that he was in Mexico

City still working for his seivice, aying to get hingel accepted

by the Cubana as a communist so they would take him to Cuba for

guerrilla training.

ALVARADO clearly was a trained intelligence

agentrand he was able to describe people and locations woll. Fo

had apparenily visited the Cuban Imbassy and its Consular offices

on a nunber of occasions and he correcily idertified some twenty

Cuban Embasay and Consular employees.

22. While intensivo investigation in the United States

showed that OSWAID could not possibly have been in Vasicat

City on 18 Septombes (he was known to have been in New Crleaa:

on bota 17 and 19 Septembes), intensive interrogation failed to

abake ALVARADO's 6t0ry. However, the Geatral Anericaa

'Ihe wife is being interrogated. I don't know if that took place yesterd

or is still going on. You are getting a teletype answer on that. I am

just giving you a preview.

With regard to that, Nicaraguan's: allegations that the man was in the

Cuban Emoassy on 18 September, I understand we do have information that

he applied for a tourist card about the 15th of Segtember. There is a

record showing entry into Mexico on Septenber 26. On about the 15th he

applied in New Orleans for a tourist caid.

We do know he was in -

I may even have some later inferation which came in during the algat -

As you know, he was in sem arleans

Vir, O'Neal: He left there the:

and the landlady said he slipped during the night.

He was last seen by the landlady

Now we have immigration records showing him

entering Mexico on the 26th which very strongly suggests that be was not in lexico

on the l8th. What we are trying. to. find out is where he was every single day -

the 25th, 24th, and all the way back.

I think the Nicaraguan story is fabricated
