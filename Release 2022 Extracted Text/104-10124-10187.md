A former associate of the Subject - associated since 1949 and

exployed by the subject as of 1950 - stated that the Subject's meteorie

rise in the radio field (due to assosiation with wealthy father and y

wealthy and influential father-in-law) was followed by a rapid descent

and that fraud, duplicity, evasion, piracy (of baseball games) and 71es

were practiced by the Subject; that he enters into contracts with no

intention of honoring his contractual obligations; and that his moral -

life, haavy dining and extra-marital indiscretions have been quastioned.

ation for others.

2. CONCLUSION AND RECONNENDATIONI Inforuation from one infor

ant, sino hes been associated with the subject for approximatoly three

years, reflects that the Subject has employed fraud, duplicity,

evasion, lies and has falled to live up to his contractual obligations

to consider others. Stress is laid primarily on the Subject's use of

fraud, eter; his heavy drinkings which wight tand to discussion of

classified information, possibly in his posseszion, with unauthorined

persons and the fact that he ta apparently irritated when he does not

have bie on way these onracteristig, ould concesvably alfect any

contract or agreement into which he

would enter with this agency.

In view of the fact that the case Officer has advised that he

would forwerd a memorandum cancelling the requent for a clearance,

no recommendation la believed necessarge
