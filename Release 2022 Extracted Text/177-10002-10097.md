1.

Iraq-Syria

a. The shaky new accommodation

between the two countries following

the recent coup in Iraq has been

threatened by Syria's action in' grant-

ing asylum to Ali Saleh Saadi, the

exiled leader of the extremist wing

of the Iraqi Baath.

b.

Saadi had arrived in Syria

unannounced following a brief stay

in Madrid.

Both regimes continue to be

troubled with internal dissension

with affairs in one deeply tangled

with those in the other.

d. In Syria

the Baathist regime is

split between moderates who desire

a broadening of the government's

power base, and a doctrinaire faction

which wants to keep all control of

the government in Baathist hands.

e.

In Iraq, the pull is more

away from the Baathists.

Two minis-

ters have threatened to resign unless

the government adopts an openly pro-

Egyptian policy. Nevertheless the

government feels secure enough to

ease up on curfew and transport re-

strictions imposed since the coup.

Iraq has announced that the

also

the capture of Ban Namone farther

south on Route 13.

b. The neutralist, rightist Lao

nope, and Meo tribal guerrilla forces

to sustain their coordinated

veera are tear ron morta pache

Such operations in Laos

have often been followed br a Com-

munist. rinoste.

3. South Vietnam

a. According to press reports,

Viet Cong attacks on Sunday wiped

out two of the government's strategic

hamlets in the central highlands about

250 miles north of Saigon.

b. More than 1,000 inhabitants

in the hamlets--who are minority

tribesmen--are missing and possibly

have fled into the mountains.

They

abandoned a significant quantity of

weapons to the Viet Cong.

These attacks not only sug-

gest continued erosion of the govern-

ment's programs to win over tribal

support, but also signal that stepped-

up Viet

Cong pressure against the new

regime is spreading to the north.

d. This Communist effort is

aimed at discrediting the post-Diem

regime before the new leadership is

able to get its feet on the ground

and capture the loyalty and respect

of people in the provinces.

e •

Although the Viet Cong still

continues to draw its main strength

from local recruiting, a steady strean

of cadre and training personnel con-

tinues to make its way to the south

bord North Vietnam along the Laotian

f. We are now reasonably sure

that at least 784 persons infiltrated

from the north during 1963 and the

actual total may be much higher.

USSR-Berlin

a.

Embassy Bonn feels that

the soviet Union may be seeking at

least a temporary modus vivendi on

the autobahn without prejudicing

its juridical position, which can

be used to cause difficulties there

in the future.

b.

The embassy bases this on

the Soviet replies to the Western

notification to the USSR on 29

October regarding harmonized convoy

procedures--two oral statements on

16 November and a note of 21 Novem

ber.

Brazil

c. The Soviet note was designed

to make a record, showing that the .

USSR exercises "control" of the auto-

bahn and that the recent incidents

resulted from US refusal to comply

with "existing procedures."

d. On the other hand, the Soviet

procedures described in the oral re-

plies seem to reflect actual Allied

practices, though there is enough

ambiguity to afford the USSR flexi-

bility in any future actions.

a.

The danger of an immediate

coup against the Goulart regime has

receded with the reported decision

of Second Army Commander General

Bevilaqua not to join the coup plot-

ters.

b. Bevilaaua.

may have

been

asked to hand over his command

as part of a series of reassign-

nents made by President Goulart to

keep the military off balance.

c .

On the other side of the

coin, there is widespread belief

that Goulart himself will at some

time resort to a coup to establish

an authoritarian regime.

Our station in Brazil be-

lieves that Goulart is living in a

dream world. He seems either out

of touch with reality or very poorly

informed. Public opinion is not

with him and the tradition that po-

litical power should only be trans-

ferred constitutionally is very

strong in the army, coup reports

notwithstanding.

f. The biggest danger from

this quarter is that the oppositio

may resort to some illegal

ing Goulart the excuse to take

over.

NOTES

A.

Ethiopia-Congo Haile Selassie has acceded to our

ambassador's request and is rescinding his earlier

decision to withdraw the 1,743-man Ethiopian con-

tingent from the UN force in the Congo.

B.

Communist China - Africa

Premier Chou En-

Lad WIll Leave In mid-December for a tour of some

Afro-Asian countries. He is to stop first in Egypt

and then visit several other African countries includ-

ing Guinea, Ghana, and Mali. Chou would be the hich-

est ranking, Chinese leader ever to visit Africa.

C.

Indonesia-Philippines Two good sources have reported

that President Sukarno plans to go to Manila this

Thursday to confer with Philippine President Macapagal.

No reasons have been advanced for the visit.. Our

charge guesses that it is an Indonesian move to head

off Philippine recognition of Malaysia.

D. Venezuela

The terrorists have struck again, this

time firing six US-owned oil and gas pipelines near

the northeastern city of Puerto la Cruz.

The elec-

tions are still on for Sunday, and we look for a maxi-

mum effort from the pro-Castro terrorist organization.

E.

Congo We now have word that 49 members of the Soviet

Embassy, including dependents, left Leopoldville on

Saturday aboard a Sabena flight for Brussels. They

are expected to book onward passage for Moscow. It is

reported that the Congolese will allow one Russian

without diplomatic status to stay to look after Soviet
