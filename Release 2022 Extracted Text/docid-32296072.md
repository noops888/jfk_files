In parting, FONTANA was advised that with or without his

cooperation, the fBl will continue to develop violations

within its jurisdiction in New Kensington.

Confidential source MIKE ZERVOS, who is well acquainted

with FONTANA, on 9/19/58, advised SAS DOUCE and FORSTIn

that he considers FONTANA a hardened criminal and loyal

bodyguard of GABRIEL MANNARINO who would stop at nothing,

including murder, to maintain the power and influence of

the MANNARINO organization in New Kensington.

ZERVOS

pointed out that in his judgment, FONTANA would never be

foolish enough to merely assault any member of law

enforcement because the person assaulted would probably

be in a position to testify after recovery and possibly

identify his attackers.

ZERVOS pointed out, however,

that in his opinion, FONTANA would, if circumstances

warranted and if ordered by GABRIEL MANNARINO, carry out

the assination of any member of law enforcement, including

Special Agents of the FBI.

ADRIAN DAVIS, Apartment 820 Morrowfield Apartments, Pittsburgh, Pa.

I-3, who has furnished reliable information in the

past, stated that ADRIAN DAVIS, an admitted prostitute, has

indicated to him that she is well acquainted with the members

of the MANNARINO organization in New Kensington, including

SAMUEL and GABRIEL MANNARINO.

T-3 pointed out that DAVIS claims

to have received telephone calls at odd hours from the MANNARINO

brothers in the past and has

been known to leave her apartment

for several hours at a time.

T-3 stated that DAVIS told him

that SAMUEL and GABRIEL MANNARINO have done favors for her in

the past but she declined to elaborate on the nature of such

favors.

T-3 said that DAVIS is extremely loyal to persons

who have helped her in the past and since she obviously feels

some unexplained obligation to the MANNARINO brothers, he serously

doubted whether she would furnish any information in her

possession concerning their activities.

T-3 stated that not long ago DAVIS commented after

reading an article in the paper regarding GABRIEL MANNARINO'S

pro-longed disappearance, that she coud get in touch with

him if she had to..

In conclusion, T-3 said that DAVIS had

nothing more

to say on the subject and he did not consider

it advisable to ask any questions.

in the past, particularly safe burglaries, on August 25, 1958,

broke off his connections with VALENTI, LA ROCCA and others

in about 1953.

He said he has since furnished information to

Immigration and Naturalization Serice, Treasury and ibI

regarding these individuals.

I-12 indicated that his life

would not be worth much in Pittsburgh because of what he has

said about VALENTI, LA ROCCA and others with whom he was

previously associated.

I-12 referred to an attorney in Pittsburgh, now

deceased, who had handled cases involving VALENTI and his

associates and that this individual also handled a coin machine

manufacturing concern in Chicago which was named the Filben

Corporation.

I-1? said he believed that this attorney might

have been even higher up in the mob than VALENTI and LA ROCCA.

of money invested in the Garden of Allah Motel, Miami Beach,

and has put JOE MEROLA in the motel to represent his interests.

JOSEPH MEROLA, FBI #4989299, on July 2, 1958, advised

that he and RED POLLOCK are now partners in the operation

of the Garden of Allah Motel, but denied that the MANNARINO

brothers have any interest in the motel. He refused to state,

however, whebber the MANNARINO brothers may have put up money

in connection with his interests in the motel.

JOE MEROLA on August 25, 1958, advised SA EMRICH

at the Garden of Allah Motel that

SAMUEL MANNARINO does not

have any interest in that motel and. if MANNARINO loaned any

money to anyone interested in the motel, he is not aware of

Lakeview Recreation Area,

Route 56, New Kensington, Pa

T-14, who has furnished reliable information in the

past, on September. 9, 1958, stated that in conversation with

SAMUEL MANNARINO at

the Ken Iron and Steel Company, on

September 3, 1958, MANNARINO authorized him to locate a group of

responsible New Kensington residents who might be interested

in forming. anprivate club to take over the management of the

Lakeview Recreation Area on a long term lease.

According to T-14, MANNARINO is particularly

interested in having a group of approximately 100 people who

would be willing to lease the recreation area for $5,000 a

year with MANNARINO retaining the concession rights to the

restaurant.

I-14 explained that apparently MANNARINO does

not feel that the state of his health is such that he can

bear up under the responsibilities of managing the establishment

and that by leasing the business he could assure himself of a

substantial financial return without being saddled with the

responsibilities of the business.

T-14 stated that he gathered from their conversation

that MANNARINO has cancelled the liquor license in the Lakeview

Recreation Area restaurant and has made arrangements with the

Liquor Control Board whereby the same license will be transferred

to a new location approximately 300 or 400 yards from the

Lakeview Recreation Area where MANNARINO is having the Murin

and Fiorina Construction Company build a new cocktail lounge.

I-14 said that according to MANNARINO, the decor

the Western

style used in the Las Vegas gambling casinos.

T-14 staed that MANNARINO also told him that he

discovered large quantities of silica sand on his property

near the Wynel's Crossroads Section of New. Kensington (same

property on which Recreation Area is located) andhas been

selling the sand for $ .35 a ton to various construction

companies in the

New Kensington area.

T-14 said that MANNARINO

told him that silica sand is a very salable product and

considered quite valuable especially in connection with the

building of new highways..

MANNARINO left T-14 with the

impression that he is reœiving considerable money from the

sale of silica sand located on his property.

proposed $250,000 Motel,

Route 56, New Kensington

I-14,

on september 9,1958, stated that in his

conversation with SAMUEL MANNARINO on September 3,1950, he made

every effort to find out whether MANNARINO plans to go ahead

with the construction of the $250,000 motel on his property

near wynel's Crossroad, as previously reported.

T-14 .said that MANNARINO told him that he does not

plan to actually. go ahead with the construction of the motel

until the construction.on : Route 56 is completed.

T-14 pointed

out that in this

way MANNARINO told him he would have an

opportunity to judge the extent. of traffic which would use the

highway and could determine: whether the motel would be profitable.

In this connection, I-14 potted out that Route 56

is currently being re-surfaced into a new four lane highway

which will run from New. Kensington to wynel's Crossroads..

MECHLING advised that the information furnished by MC DOWELL

held no particular significance for him until the evening

of July 31, 1958, while in the process of conducting a

surveillance of GABRIEL MANNARINO's home on Charles Avenue,

he observed a red and white 1956 Plymouth station wagon

bearing Pennsylvania license 958GY pull up in front's

of the MANNARINO home and observed the occupants entering

the house.

Pennsylvania Motor Vehicle Bureau records indicate PennsyLvania

license 958 GY is registered to Anna Marie Domenick, 1014

Manor Road, New Kensington, Pa. It is noted that the Manor

Road address is approximately:two blocks from the MANNARINO

home on Charles Avenue in New Kensington.

T-9, on September 19, 1958

stated that while talking with

WILLIE SAMS on September 18, 1958, SAMS was complaining :

about a terrible hangover and mentioned that he got drunk

with GABRIEL MANNARINO during the evening of September 15

or the morning of September 16, 1958.. T-9 said that SAMS

also told him that MANNARINO has been back in New Kensington

since early September and is very unhappy about the lack of

business in the gambling casino and the general pressure being

brought to bear on New Kensington by Federal investigative

agencies.

T-9 said

that SAMs did not go into any further

detail regarding his. drinking bout with MANNARINO and T-9

considered it inadvisable to press him at the risk of

appearing to be too inquisitive.

T-9 pointed out that in

all probability, SAMS and MANNARINO did their drinking on

September, 15 or 16, 1958, at the Laetus Club on Fifth Avenue,

New Kensington, next door to the Triangle Billiards gambling

casino.

T-9 noted that SAMS follows a strict daily routine

which includes being at the Laetus Club to supervise. the

MANNARINO sport betting operation usually until one or two

in the morning every day except Sunday and he seriously doubted

whether MANNARINO would risk drinking at any other establishment

providing, of course,

they did not go to one of their homes.

T-9 assumed

that MANNARINO probably, entered the Laetus. Club

through the rear door on BarcesStreet and spent the evening

with SAMS drinking in the Laetus Club since

the management

of that club would not betray MANNARINO nor would the local

police.

I-9, on September 19, 1958, said that JIMMY BUFFONE, Westmoreland

County Detective and Constable of the First Ward, New Kensington,

and brother of ROCCO BUFFONE, told him on the evening of

September 15, 1958, that he planned to see GABRIEL MANNARINO
