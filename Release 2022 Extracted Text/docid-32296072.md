In parting, FONTANA was advised that with or without his
cooperation, the FBI will continue to develop violations
within its jurisdiction in New Kensington.

Confidential source MIKE ZERVOS, who is well acquainted
with FONTANA, on 9/19/58, advised SAS DOUCE and FORSYTH
that he considers FONTANA a hardened criminal and loyal
bodyguard of GABRIEL MANNARINO who would stop at nothing,
including murder, to maintain the power and influence of
the MANNARINO organization in New Kensington. ZERVOS a
pointed out that in his judgment, FONTANA would never be
foolish enough to merely assault any member of law
enforcement because the person assaulted would probably
be in a position to testify after recovery and possibly
identify his attackers. ZERVOS pointed out, however,
that in his opinion, FONTANA would, if circumstances
warranted and if ordered by GABRIEL MANNARINO, carry out
the assination of any member of law énforcement, including
Special Agents of the FBI.

reading’ an article in the paper regarding GABRIEL MANNARINO's
‘pro-longed ‘disappearance; that she coud get in touch with

Lakeview Recreation Area,

Route 56, New Kensington, Pa.

T-14, who has furnished reliable information in the
past, on September. 9, 1958, stated that in conversation with
SAMUEL MANNARINO at the Ken Iron and Steel Company, on
September 3, 1958, MANNARINO authorized him to locate a group of
responsible New Kensington residents who might be interested
in.forming. anprivate club to take over: the.management of the
Lakeview Recreation. Area on.a long term lease,

|
JOE MEROLA on August 25, 1958, advised SA EMRICH

According to T-14, MANNARINO is particularly

interested in having a group of approximately 100 people who fee
would be willing to lease the recreation area for $5,000 a.
year with MANNARINO retaining the concession rights to the
restaurant. T-14 explained that apparently MANNARINO does
not feel that the state of his health is swceh that he can
bear up under the responsibilities of managing the establishment

{ and that by leasing the business.he could assure. himself of a
it substantial financial return without being saddled with the
ip responsibilities of the business.

T-14 stated that he gathered from their convewation
that MANNARINO has cancelled the liquor license in the Lakeview
Recreation Area restaurant and has made arrangements with the
Liquor Control Board whereby the same license will be transferred
to a new location approximately 300 or 400 yards from the
Lakeview Recreation Area where MANNARINO is having the Murin . a
and Fiorina Construction Company build a new cocktail lounge.

_— T-14 said that. according to MANNARINO, the decor
used in the new cocktail lounge will be.along the Western
style used in the Las Vegas gambling casinos.

T-14 steed that MANNARINO also told him that he
discovered large quantities of silica sand on his property
near the Wynel's Crossroads Section of New. Kensington (same
property on which Recreation Area is located) andms been
selling the sand for $ .35 a ton to various construction _

companies in the New Kensington area. T-14 said that MANNARINO

told him that silica sand is a very salable product and
considered quite valuable especially in.connection with the
puilding.of new highways. MANNARINO left T-14 with the
impression that he is reeiving considerable money from the
sale of silica sand located on his property.

Route 56;..New Kensington

every effort to find out whether MANNARINO plans to go ahead
with the construction of the $250,000 motel on his property
near Wynel's Crossroad, as previously reported.

T-14 said that MANNARINO told him that he does not
plan to actually go ahead with the construction of the motel

until the construction on . Route 56is completed. “T-14 pointed

out that in this way MANNARINO told-him he. would have an

opportunity to judge the extent. of traffic which would use the
highway and could determine: whetle the motel would be profitable.

aie In this connection, T-14 potbed out that Route 56
is currently being re-surfaced into a new four lane highway
which will. run from New. Kensington to Wynel's Crossroads. .

MECHLING advised that the information furnished by ‘MC DOWELL
held no particular, significance for him until the evening

of July :31, 1958, while in the process. of conducting a
surveillance of GABRIEL MANNARINO's home on Charles Avenue,
he observed a red and white 1956 Plymouth station wagon
bearing Pennsylvania license 958GY pull up in fronts '
eh ee MANNARINO home and observed the occupants entering ‘
the house.

Pennsylvania Motor Vehicle Bureau records indicate Pennsylvania
license 958 GY is registered to Anna Marie Domenick, TOLL

Manor Road, New Kensington, Pa. It is noted that the Manor

Road address is approximately: two blocks from the MANNARINO

hone on Charles Avenue in New Kensington. : -

T-9, on September 19, 1958, stated that while talking with
WILLIE SAMS on September 15, 1958, SAMS was complaining

about a terrible hangover and mentioned that he got drunk
with GABRIEL MANNARINO during the evening of September 15

or the morning of September16, 1958.. T-9 said that SaMS
also-.told him that MANNARINO has. been back in New Kensington
since early September and.is. very unhappy about the lack of
business in the gambling casino and the general pressure being
brought to bear on New Kensington by Federal investigative
agencies. T-9 said that SAMS did not. go into any further:
detail regarding. his, drinking bout: with MANNARINO and T-9
considered it inadvisable to press him at the risk of
appearing to be.too inquisitive. 1-9 pointed out that in

all probability, SAMS and MANNARINO did their drinking on
September 15,or.16,- 1958, at. the. Laetus Club..on Fifth Avenue,
New. Kensington,. next door to the Triangle. Billiards gambling
casino. T-9 noted that SAMS follows. a .strict. daily routine
which includes being at the Laetus Club.to supervise. the ;
MANNARINO..sport. betting operation ‘usually..until. one or two

in the morning every day.except Sunday and he seriously doubted
whether MANNARINO would risk drinking.at any other establishment
providing, of course, they did not.go. to’ one of their homes.

7-9 assumed that MANNARINO probably, entered. the Laetus. Club
through the rear door on BarfesStreet and.spent the evening
with SAMS drinking inthe Laetus. Club.since the management

of that club would not betray MANNARINO nor would the local 1
police. nities ; Seer reresesenes) :

7-9, on September 19, 1953, said that JIMMY BUFFONE, Westmoreland
County Detective and Constable of the First Ward, New Kensington,
and brother of ROCCO BUFFONE, told him on the evening of :
