Dear Al:

I herewith submit my resignation from the Select

I have not lost my convictions about this investigation
which brought me here to work last December. However,
personal and financial obligations have made it necessary i
for me to obtain more secure employment. \

I wish the Committee all success in the future and
— I sincerely hope that it is never again plagued with the
problems it has previously faced.

Sincergly,

Dehise L. McCray
