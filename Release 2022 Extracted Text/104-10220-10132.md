_ PRE SCHOOL, SCHOOL AND ADOLESC!

The Dr. talks: "He was an only child and he was very’ spoiled,
especially by his father. They were moral peuple and had a
certain position of respect in that small town. ‘The mother
attempted to teach him to study hard and become a professional
but (3-1) liked to party more than study. ‘'vhen he went to high
school in-Santa Clara (capital of Las Villas province) he ran_
around with a bad bunch.of students who wece always partying

and studying vesy little." :
In c. 1954y when Dr. and S-1 were preparing to enter the University

the father sct up a boarding house in Havana for the

of Havana,
and $-1 roomed together for

students from their L.V. area. | dr
over 2 years: “tle slept in the! sar oot, for two years, ‘le got

to know each other even better.! He not a very good student
becaus2 he would not study. was moce interested in having a
good time. In his second or third year at the University -T
think he was studying to be an bngin or achitect- he dropped
out, he flunked out. He then went to help his fathec with his
business and continued his partying.”

MARITAL LIFE Anco SEXUAL CONDUCT:

Dr, did not know that S-1 was married, “iie. was a very romantic

person; he fell in love very easily put ‘only had one woman at a
“time, “But, I think he hed an inferiority complex. ‘When we went
to a dance together, he didn't go for the pretty ones ~I did~ and
he sought out the ugly ones. He wanted to be sure he got a girl;
that he wasn't rejected." pesennen ay sciif IRALSHISS.DH

GENERAL STATE OP MeAT/TH: KO FIELD U)SSERINATICN

"He was always healthy, He was|stronqg and athletic. He liked
to defend people against bullies. He would try to reason with
those who were taking advantage[of the weaker ones."

EMOTIONAL EACTIONS: RECORD COPY

“He 1s generally a pleasant perton. He loves to joke and we
liked to play practical jokes of others. ‘then he's not joking
he gives the appearance of confidence; you accept him easily.
He is not handsome but he looks|pleasant. ‘when you begin talking
with him you continue; you don't grop him, as you would a boring

person.”

produced the followi{ng ‘facts, on. Sal:



EMOTIONAL REACTIONS (cont inued)

And the 2c. continuest the ds cle a toser. ‘When he
flunked aut of the University of Havdna he accepted tt without
fighting back. le could have accepted the. fact that he did not
Khat be spent more time at parties than with his books. -
30, he could have fought & he co¥ld have told himself that he
was going to change his life style ahd complete his career. He
Stdnit fight back; didn't change his'ways and accepted the results
as inevitable; something that fate had predestined for him and that

was that." . !

MENTAL PROCESS: : i
fe fs not {intelligent but he ig sharp; he's not a dope.
I would say he learned by watching. others do things cather
“than"he Beifig inventive." ~ cat eae

RELATIONS: :
“He got along with everyone, He treated everyone with respect.

He didn't take. advantage of others. Ha liked te'have people around |
him, Perhaps tt came from growing up in boarding houses where there
was always people afound, He liked:to pull practical jokes on
ethers but in fun. Unfortunately, he joined a group of bums in’

high school and that led him to a bad life style. Perhaps his -
infactortty complex was && blame forrhim- joining this’ fast crowds! « §
Tdontt thing Any of those bum$ could. be “ed a good friends z
T don't know that he had any frctend re now outside of Cuba."

PAITERNS OF CONDUCT: :
"He is lazy. He depends on others. i'm certain he knows that he’

is not prepared to fight it out and make good in a sociaty-outside

of Cuba, In my case, if I wasn't here in the US, I could go anywhere
in the world and make out. He has to recognise that the Castro
regime has given him prestige, position, recognition that he can't
obtain going anywhert else. So, ££ fs going te be very difficult

to move him from the position he now has, ‘hile he is not ambitious,.
not the type to betray you to get ahead, hd does like the good

1ife, the good clothes, the good drinks and fang. If you want to
capture him it would have to be offering him ‘@ that Castro has
given him as far 45 position. You so havé to recognize that

he is very attached to his parents. If they are alive, it is very
any chfidren?

unlikely that he will defect. Also, does he
Are they with nim or back in Cuba? He would not desert them, for - i
sure," Caine

He liked to

And, the Dr. continued: “He is very paternals
give advice and protect the weak fro: nted to take
advantage of them, .but he never ap: to himself.

i think he was a bit envious of me and again he admired me
because I was a fighter. Many Was the morning after a party that
he tried to discourage me from goingl to class and stay in bed.
But I got up and fought while he went pack to sieep and didn't

go to classes."

DA*s CONCLUSIONS:

I would be glad to make an approach to him but, as I said

| previously, tt would not be y tolcapture him unless he {s

: about to lose his position. 5 helchanged his 1ife style;
or is he still partying around?" : ean

Se. said that S-1 has no Revolutionary backycound and that he
never expressed himself as a leftist in sentinents, "Edo not
believe that he {s a’ Marxist.” The Or. belleves: that $-1's

father who was PSP probably got S-1 into MINREX through his old i
Communist Pacty friends and that’ S-1 has accomodated himself

into a confortable position. i
\. Dre, Fecalis that he, last saw-S-1 in Cuba in c. 1960-61. They

met at parties and §-1 was still a wine, wasen and song man.

In c. 1961, cs left to study in Pacis.’ In c. 1962-63, ry

was instructed ‘to write S-1 a warm/friendly letter from Paris

(S-1 Was in the Hague) but .although S-1 answered, it was. “cool.”

times but you could see from his answer-that he wasn't accepting

relationship end and asked me for an address whece he could contact
me if he had anything of interest. He now has my Miami PO Box

and, I expect, we'll be hearing from him in the future.
