1, On 15 January 1968 this Agency receives ti
following 1 eo

a. The Canadian Press Correspondent io Moscov,
Williag BUCKLEY, approachea our Eubasey infornsally in the
niodle of peceaber on behalf of #illiaz MARTIN, the
ex-eaployee of NSA who defected to the Soviet Caion in 1960,

b, Accoraing to BUCKLEY, HARTIN wishes to see: his

parents for coapassionate reasons and wants to know if he
: would be aduitted to Canaua without fear of extradition to
. the United States if he vere to arrange a reniez-vous with”
bis parents in Vascouver, We do not :now vhother MARTIN
still has a United States pasaport or vhethor he has becese ;
: 2 Goviet citizea, Ia any eveat KARTIN considers himself
: inadaissible to the United States.

i c. BUCKLBY met HAATIN at the apartsert of

+ Bovard RAUSCH, the Moscow corresponaent for Mc Grae-Hill
Publications, Ia addition HARTIN later telephoacd BUCKLEY

to todicate hie iaterest in finding out whether or not be
could cozc to Cans BUCKLEY assumes, quite rightly I

would think, that the manner ia ebi:n MARTIN has made hie
request indicates that bis aussica hosts are asare of bis
iaterest in getting out of the Soviet Union to sce bis parents,

i ¢@, We havo informed our hmbapsy that it should

$ take no action to encourage BUCKLEY or MARTIN to believe that
8 visa would be granted iy MARTIN were to mak
application. Since, however, MARTIN'S sate
Canada 18 already in @ newspaperman’s hands, ve cannot rule

out tho possibility that BUCKLEY might write about MARTIN's ’
interest. Such a story sould probably lead to the need for

QM expression of the Canadian Governnent's attituce. In

making recoasoncations on the kind of response that might be

made in the event that a question is put to ay Minister, it

wouls S¢ Css uswiul to kaue what déaTin's status in lew is

Go far ag the United Btatcs is concerned. If, for exnaplo,
your Government could not taxe legal action, the Cenacian
authoritses sould be in a position if this matter case to
public attention to easy that they vere not avare of any
barrier preventing MARTIN from seeing his parents in the United
Btates, I should be most grateful 1f throu, your channels
could be provided informally with an indication of

MARTIN tatus in law in the United States.

@. BUCKLEY's only other comment on MARTIN tas that
be dida't really know vhat to make of MARTIN, MARTIN
Seenod outspoken in dealing with the shartcosings of life
in the Goviet Union, Oa the otber band ho spoke with a
@light stamaer and seemed nervous. BUCKLEY's view for ehat
4¢ ie vorth io that MARTIN 1s not interested in getting tato
troublo sith the Russians or doing anything sbhich they might
consider underhanded, I should eapbasize that no member of
the Canadian Embassy has had any direct contact vith HAKTIN,

2, On 18 January 1968 the Fodoral Bureau of Investigation
vas advised of the foregoing informally, ia order to explore
the possibility of providing an indication of Subject's
etatua in law, as requested in paragraph 1. d. above.

3. This Agency was advised by the Departsent of State
oa 19 January that subject's parents had writtes to the
Departsent adviging that Subject would lise to visit his
parents, that he wss planniox a visit to Canada, and
inquiring what Bubject's legal position would te if be cid
tadeed visit. The Department indicated that it planned to
inquire shat the 0, 5, Embassy in Hoscow knew of Subjoct's
travel plans, including a check with the Canadian kabaesy to
ascertain if Subject bad applied for a visa. The Departsent
was apprised of the informal Canadien inquiry as to Subject's
Gtatua, but indicated that it vould refrain from making any
reference to this incuiry in seoxing information from the
U. 8. Exbassy in Moscow,
