‘Your Melbourne Station has sought my views
on the possibility of declassifying a Warren Commission
document_In which reference Is made to the

The document in question Is GD.971
dated 22nd May, 1964, together with an attachment dated
29th November, 1963.

I would recommend strongly that CD,971 and
Its attachment should not on any account be declassified or
publicly released for reasons which Include the following :

! a) It has never been officially stated that there
i Is a "C.1,A, Canberra Station" or that
there are C.I.A. officers in Australia.
This has been avoided as a point of policy.
| (ti) Publication of these facts would Invoke a
“spate of quéstioris by ‘the Press ‘and: In’ the
. Parliament, which would be contrary to the
national security interest, for example :

(a) Who approved the establishment of
the "C.I.A, Canberra Station"?

(b) What is Its composition and location?

(c) What is Its purpose In Australla?
(Allegations have already been made
that C.I.A. is interfering in

domestic affairs.)

(d) With what Australian agencies does It
deal? ;
| which has not been
publicly disclosed, could be brought
| into discussion. )

(e) With what other foreign agencies does the
| deal?

control Is there over



(ut) Questions could be ralsed as to the Investigation

: by the of the anonymous telephone
calls, the validity of its quoted conclusion and
the result of its further enquiries.

1am giving a copy of this letter to your Melbourne
Station,

With kindest regards and best wishes, .
