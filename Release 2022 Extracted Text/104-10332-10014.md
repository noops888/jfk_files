MEMORANDUM FOR: Executive Director
Assassination Records Review Board

FROM: John F. Pereira
Central Intelligen¢ge Agency

SUBJECT: Reconsideration of Releases in Scelso
Testimony and Lopez. Report

(We request that this memorandum be returned to CIA
once the Board has completed its deliberations on the issues
discussed below.)

: 1._(S). Issue.._This_memo.is. to request.that..the JFK -...-_.____
“Board reconsider its decision to release certain information

contained in the HSCA testimony of John Scelso and in the

Lopez Report. Specifically CIA requests that /the phrases
"political action program" (pg. 64 Scelso Téstimony, pg.
177, 178 Lopez Report); "Mexican police" (pg. ‘85 -Scelso:
Testimony); and "is exposed by Agee in his book" (pg. 141
Scelso Testimony) fbe~postponed-from release. We also offer
‘some suggestions for substitute language which we believe
will not detract from the JFK assassination story, yet still
protect the information at issue.

— a eeeeet

“We were running, at that time, a vast political action
program in Mexico City to try to swing Mexico around from
its Leftist direction to a middle of the road direction and
it succeeded. I don't know whether you informed yourself
about the magnitude of our political action program there at
the time -- absolutely enormous"

5. (8) Furthermore, the fact that these statements
were made by Scelso amounts to an official confirmation of
the underlying facts, making it very difficult for CIA to
protect the same or similar information from further release
in the future. Speculation in books, articles, and other
publications, or disclosures by Congress are often perceived
by the public as evidence that that information is in the
public domain and therefore is no longer classified. The
CIA has nevertheless been able to legally protect the
information from unauthorized disclosure. The courts have

. held that because there has been no official confirmation,

(i.e. declassification by the appropriate CIA official) the
CIA may continue to protect from release the
the information at issue even when there has been widespread
public discussion on the issue in questi,

6. (8) In this case, should therel»Y A question raised
as to the classification status of docu ?s on the
political program referred to by Scelso, it would be
difficult to convince a court that such information had not
been declassified because of the release by the Board.

Furthermore, the attached letter to Louis Stokes, Chairman

of the Select Committee on Assassination from former Acting j
DCI Frank Carlucci also indicates that Scelso was acting as |
an official of the CIA. The DCI states that any classified j
testimony made by Agency staff before the Committees would {
be considered "authorized provision" of the information. i
This was to ensure that "all persons respond fully and i

| truthfully" to the Committee. Carlucci's letter, especially \
| taken together with the first few pages of Scelso's \
testimony, make it clear that Scelso was speaking as an

official of the CIA. new

10. (S) CIA requests that the Board continue to
withhold this phrase from release and substitute in "other
sources" or. something similar to this. Omitting the fact
that the airport information was obtained from Mexican

| counterparts would probably leave the impression that the

i (S) "That is, the variety and number of telephone

H taps, surveillance teams, photo operations and other

i technical operations is exposed by Agee in his book. That

i exceeds anyplace else that we had in the world by a lot..."
(Scelso, pg. 141)

n 11. (S) CIA objects to the release of the highlighted

i phrase because, for reasons described in Section 1, it
amounts to official CIA confirmation of the existence of a
teltap operation conducted jointly with the Mexicans and
with close collaboration with the President of Mexico. As
this Board is well aware, CIA has consistently requested,
the protection of liaison involvement in this teltap
operation. As the Board has agreed with CIA's position on
this matter, the only issue is whether this statement
reveals what we have agreed meets the criteria for continued
protection under the JFK Act.

12. (S) For the Board's convenience, several relevant
pages from Agee's book (Inside the Company: CIA Diary) are

attached. These pages explain in great detail the teltap
operation and the fact that it was conducted jointly between
the CIA and the Mexicans. Although such disclosures by
former employees are disturbing, they do not amount to
official confirmation of the underlying information.
Standing by itself, Agee's book can be dismissed by the
Agency as speculation, and do not compromise CIA's ability
to keep the information classified. Scelso's testimony,
however, amounts to official confirmation of Agee's book,

and does effect the Agency's ability to protect the

fact that Scelso's testimony could be read to confirm not
only what is accurate in Agee's book, but also what is
inaccurate.

12. (S) Furthermore, the language used by Scelso is
clear. The use of the phrase "exposed by Agee in his book" \
does not allow for any other interpretation except that \
Agee's description of the teltap is accurate. If Scelso had
used other language, such as "has been written about :
elsewhere", the existence of the joint teltap operation
would be protected. We request that the Board protect the
phrase as it is and use the above substitute language. Such
substitute language would not alter the story of the JFK |
Assassination, yet would still allow for the protection of
the joint operation. |

13. (S) While the connection between Agee's book and
Scelso's testimony may at first seem attenuated, anyone
involved in the review process conducted by this Board will
know that it is not. Many individuals follow the decisions
of this Board closely, and Agee's writings about the CIA are
also well known. It is to be expected that those who read
the Scelso report would then turn to Agee's book.

From: J. Barry Harrelson, CSI/HRG
Subject: Meeting with ARRB Staff

1. Thursday afternoon I met with Dave Marwell,
Executive Director for the ARRB, and two of his staff,
Jeremy Gunn and Mary McAuliffe. I briefed them on the four
releases in the Lopez Report and Scelso Testimony that had
been identified as potential apveal items, and on the
Agency's concerns} re the documents? I requested
_that the Board reconsider the release of the statements,on
{Mexico City political action programs, Scelso's comment on >
jagee, the reference to the Mexican Police as a source and .”
(Warrenton as site of the Agency's } Record Center. ~

2. Maxwell agreed to send a “staff recommendation” to
the Board recommending that they delay the release of these
four items to hear additional evidence from the Agency. The
rest of the Lopez Report and Scelso Testimony would be
released on schedule. If the Board accepts the staff's
recommendation, the four items will be addressed at the next
Washington meeting (27 September). If the Board rejects the
staff's recommendation, then we have the option of appealing
to the President. Marwell and Gunn seemed confident that ~~ ~~
the Board would agree to delay the release.

3. ‘Gunn requested that the Agency's additional
evidence on these four items (if provided in writing) be to
the ARRB staff by 23 September. The Agency can also brief «

evidence ‘memos ‘on’ “ political action programs” and “Mexican -
police”, issues and OGC (Linda C.) will t the lead_on gustan

IT will contact the DA/IRO on Hatch, on the/ Warrenton
issue. He

4.  Concerning{the ments,/ Marwell agreed
to delay Board action until the 16 October meeting. The
Agency's proposal on these documents should be sent to the
ARRB staff as soon as possible.

Washington.

The later contacts with the Cuban Embassy, and so on,
which only were divulged after the assassination. It is an
enormous problem. Mexico had one of the biggest and most! :
active telephone intercept operations in the whole world
and the job of processing this material is just impossible.

Mr. Goldsmith. Let's go through this step by step,
although I was not going to do this at this time. I am going
to modify the line of inquiry somewhat.

Do you know how many telephone intercepts there were
in the Mexico City station?

Mr. Scelo. How many lines were being tapped?

Mr. Goldsmith. Yes, at the Cuban and then at the Soviet.

Communist Party Operations

The station cP section consists of two case officers, Wace

Ftwo case officers outside the station under non-official cover: Bob

~Driscoll,t a retired operations officer now working under con-

agract, and Julian Zambianco who was transferred from Guayaquil
‘to Mexico City about a year ago. These officers are in charge of
agent and technical penetrations against the ‘revolutionary organi-
zations of importance. The quality of this intelligence is high,
although not as high as it was before 1963. In late 1962 Carlos
Manuel Pellecer,t the station’s most important communist party
peactration-agent, broke openly with communism by publishing
a book. He was a leader of the Guatemalan Communist Party
(eG7) and had been Minister of Labor in the Arbenz government
during the 1950s. However, after the Agency-sponsored over-
throw of the Arbenz government Pellecer made his way to Mexico
City where for years he was the station’s best source (cryptonym.
LINLUCK) on all the revolutionary organizations in Mexico, not
just the Guatemalan exiles. His book, of course, was financed by
the station and distributed by the Agency all over Latin America,
Pellecer is still being used by the Mexico City station as a Propa-
ganda agent, as with other former penetration agents who form-
ally break with communism without revealing their years of work
es spies — Eudocio Ravines,t the well-known Peruvian defector
from communism is a parallel case. Another book by Pellecer,
also financed by the station, has just appeared. This book is a
continuation of cra exploitation of the Marcos Rodriguez and
Joaquin Ordoqui cases in Cuba, and is aimed at denigration of the
‘Cuban revolution. 7

The station also collects information about communists from
the US living in Mexico. Many of them arrived during the Mc-
Carthy period and some have subsequently become Mexican
citizens. Information about them is mainly of interest to the FBI,
which calls them the American Communist Group in Mexico
City (acGMc). Information collected about them includes that
obtained through the LIENVoy telephone-tapping operation des-
ctibed below.

The station also receives copies of reports from FBI penetration
operations against Mexican revolutionary organizations. Mexico
is the only country in Latin America, except Puerto Rico, where
the FBI continued operations against the local left when the cla
took over in 1947. The Fs} intelligence is of high. quality,

in a chronological file.292/ One copy of the Cuban

(g) Format of Transcripts

The format of the transcripts that Mr. Tarasoff
produced was much the same as those of the Spanish
language transcripts described above.294/ Mr.
Tarasoff's transcripts were from Russian into English.295/
Many of Mr.. Tarasoff's transcriptions bear the notation
“(previously transcribed)" after the meter number
referring to the reel footage location of a
conversation.297/ Mr. Tarasoff indicated that this
notation meant that the conversation had already been
transcribed from a tap on another embassy phone:

“Previously transcribed" means, for instance,

I went to the embassy first and the embassy

number was 605055. Now this number 501264

belonged to the film's office. So consequently

if that particular call went out of the main
building to the films office and it had been

transcribed before, that is exactly what I

would do, put down “previously transcribed".
So there was no question of doing it twice.298/

One CIA employee who was involved in Cuban

possible that theemployee, Mr. Phitlips, who. ‘Was “stationed
in Mexico City from 1961 to 1966, was incorrect, after
a fifteen-year hiatus, in placing this tap in 1963.214/

Attached is an MFR summarizing my meeting with Mr. Whitten. On a more personal note, Mr. Whitten is an extremely
charming and interesting gentleman. The meeting with him went much better than | had hoped, but it was also rather emotionally
distressing for hoth Jeremy and |. Mr. Whitten broke down several times during the meeting and was obviously feeling very scared.
Although Jeremy is sure that the Board will do the right thing here, we both agreed that Mr. Whitten is without doubt someone who
should be protected even if it means going to the President.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Interview with John Whitten (S)

1. On 22 April 1996, from approximately 1000 to 1600,
Jeremy Gunn, General Counsel of the JFK Revi ‘d, and I spoke
with Mr. John Whitten at the U.S. embassy in/Vienna). Gunn
conducted the interview by showing Whitten various documents and

‘his prior testimony before the HSCA. Mr. Whitten was eager to
help the Board in any way he could and even offered to come to
‘the US if need be. Gunn concluded that it would probably not be
useful to take Whitten's deposition at a later date. Although
Whitten had in general a good memory, Gunn felt he did not add
anything of significance to his prior testimony before the HSCA.
After the interview, Mr. Whitten took us to his apartment and
then later to a restaurant with his wife. We left Mr. Whitten
about 1900. (S)

2. Mr. Whitten was extremely worried and upset about the
release of his name and on several occasions in the interview was
on the verge of tears. Although I was expecting him to be angry
, with CIA and thé Board, instead, he clearly felt hurt and
betrayed. His obvious physical problems add_to this feeling of
being vulnerable. Physically he is not well; he is paralyzed on
‘his left side and has great difficulty walking. On a map, he
pointed out his apartment and indicated what he believed to be
serious threats to his safety should his affiliation with CIA

come known, Within a block of his apartment, he pointed out
the headquarters - -of the PKK, the Anarchist party anda Carre
many Middle Easterners would congregate He then-pointed ot

these places to us when we went to his’ apartment He made it
eres uy aia was no way he could defend himself from any
‘attack.

3. Mr. Whitten also stated that he has been retired for
almost as long as he worked for the CIA, and that he has a
completely dif pcoe life now in Vienna} He. and his wife have
. lived in approximately 25 years. He is a member of

arious musical and art societies. He sings in a prominent
(vienna) Men's Choir. He has published various articles on music
is Specialty is Johann Strauss He has received many medals
for his work in the arts {in Vienna) hich we saw when we went to

several occasions, should his affiliation bééo known, he would
have to leave {Austria On other occasions, he stated that he
would turn himself in to the ‘Viennesejauthorities and offer his
services as a consultant to the police or intelligence service.
He obviously was extremely distraught and was voicing what he
believed were his options should his name be released by the
Board, although he had not decided on a particular course of
action. On the other hand, Mr. Whitten was adamant that no
matter what happens he would never betray the CIA by telling
anyone about his work as an intelligence officer. (S)

5. By the end of the evening, Mr. Whitten stated that he
felt much better about the state of events. On several occasions,
I had assured him that CIA was doing everything. to protect him
and Gunn had. stated he would argue for his protection to the
Board. He clearly looked upon Gunn and I as his allies in this
process and even stated that he had a "wonderful" day talking to
us. We left him, I believe, feeling happy and confident all would
turn out well. (8S)

6. After our meeting with Whitten, I spoke with Gunn
about how this issue would be handled by the Board.
believed that it was more than likely that the Board would agree
to protect him and that he would make the strongest argument he
could to them. The Board will make its decision in it's next
meeting in mid-May. Gunn did not think it would be necessary for
; anyone from CIA to come down to that meeting. We agreed that
: should the Board make the reprehensible decision of releasing
Whitten's name, that we could not imagine a stronger case on
which to bring an appeal to the President. (S)

POST OFFICES, SEVERAL SMALL SUPER MARKETS, MY FAMILY PHYSICIAN, OUR

4. VIENNAS : Is OF ISLAMIC TERRORISTS. THERE ‘HAVE “BEEN SEVERAL
ASSASSINATIONS, EVEN OF A CITY COUNCILMAN, BY THEM IN RECENT YEARS.
UNDER/ AUSTRIAN! LAW, I, AS A FOREIGNER, CANNOT EVEN GET A PISTOL
LICENSE. YOU MUST KNOW ABOUT THE KIDNAPPING AND KILLING OF OUR
COLLEAGUES AROUND THE WORLD.

4. I HAVE TWICE TESTIFIED BEFORE HOUSE AND SENATE COMMITTEES ABOUT
THE KENNEDY ASSASSINATION. THEIR FULL REPORTS SIMPLY CALLED ME THE
“DESK OFFICER" AND THAT HAS SEEMED TO SATISFY EVERYONE. NEEDLESS TO
SAY, IF YOU DO EXPOSE MY NAME, I WILL NOT EVER TALK TO ANY
JOURNALISTS OR SO-CALLED HISTORIANS.

5. IF MY NAME IS EXPOSED, I WILL OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO LEAVE VIENNA,
WITH THE WHOLE HOUSE FULL OF FURNITURE, PICTURES, LIBRARY, CLOTHING,
ETC. WHICH I PACKED AND PAID TO HAVE MOVED OVER HERE IN 1983.
BECAUSE OF MY STROKE, I WILL BE UNABLE TO DO ANY PACKING AND THE
MOVE WILL BE VERY EXPENSIVE. WHERE CAN I RESETTLE IN A 2000 SQ FT.
APT. SO CONVENIENTLY LOCATED.

6. MY WIFE AND I LOVE LIVING HERE FOR MANY REASONS, AND LEAVING
WOULD BE A CRUEL AND NEEDLESS FATE.

7. I REGARD THIS LAW AS DISHONORABLE AND UNWORTHY OF THE UNITED
STATES OF AMERICA. IF YOU DECIDE AGAINST ME, I WANT TO APPEAR
BEFORE THE BOARD AND EVEN THE PRESIDENT, WHOM I HAPPEN TO ADMIRE. I
WILL PAY MY OWN WAY BACK TO DO SO. I SERVED IN WWII AND NEVER
SPARED MYSELF; IN THE OUTFIT I WORKED HARD, WAS FEARLESS IN DEALING
WITH MY SUPERIORS (CORD MEYER AND DICK HELMS CAN TESTIFY TO THAT)
AND MY ADVERSARIES. I WOULDN'T EVEN THINK OF THREATENING TO EXPOSE
THINGS TO PRESSURE YOU. I WILL BE EMPLOYING AN ATTORNEY OR TWO,
FAMILIAR WITH OUR AFFAIRS, TO REPRESENT ME. I WILL NOT DENY, THAT I
CONSIDER YOU AND EVERYONE ELSE IMPLEMENTING THIS LAW TO BE ENGAGING
IN DISHONORABLE CONDUCT, UNWORTHY OF OUR GOVERNMENT SERVICE.

{IN THE LATE 1960'S WHILE SERVING IN VIENNA UNDER TOM
SST! RED BY TO

REFUSED TO
RESIGNATION. TO ME, IT WAS DISHONORABLE TO BETRAY A YOUNG AGENT WHO
HAD ACCEPTED OUR RECRUITMENT AND PUT FAITH IN OUR PROMISE OF
SECRECY. TO MY MIND AN AGENCY WITHOUT PRINCIPLES CANNOT SURVIVE AND
INDEED SHOULD NOT SURVIVE. TOM KARAMISSINIS, PERHAPS ONE OF THE
LAST HONORABLE MEN TO SERVE WITH US IN HIGH POSITION, FIRED A STRONG
‘BLE BACK AND THE SHAMEFUL ORDER WAS RETRACTED.

9. I HAVE INVESTED ABOUT $50,000 IN MY APARTMENT, IN KEY MONEY AND

IMPROVEMENTS. I LEAVE, I WILL LOSE ALL OR MOST OF THIS. OUR
LAST MOVE TO {VIENNA} COST ME ABOUT $15,000 IN SEA FREIGHT AND
INSURANCE. iT NEVER GET ON MY KNEES AND ASK TO BE MADE WHOLE IF

YOU EXPOSE ME, BUT I MAY REPORT TO THE COURTS. I AM A RETIRED
MEMBER OF THE VIRGINIA BAR.

MINDLESS DRIVE TO KNOW EVERYTHING CAN LEAD TO A PROUD COUNTRY'S

POW'S, WE PROMISED
‘GUTS; *— 1 ALL BELIEVED WE WERE BEING HONEST. BUT ALMOST

25 YEARS AFTER WWII THE BRITISH DECLASSIFIED ALL THE ADI(K) REPORTS
(THAT'S WHAT THEY WERE CALLED, AND EVEN THE "ROOM CONVERSATIONS,"
TRANSCRIPTS OF THE CONVERSATIONS POWS HAD IN THEIR ROOMS, EVEN
INCLUDING THE EXTREMELY VALUABLE SPEECHES MADE BY HIGH-RANKING
LUFTWAFFE OFFICERS TO THEIR HIGH-RANKING FELLOW POW'S AT
“COCKFOSTERS" MANSION. NEWCOMERS WERE VISITED BY THE OLD HANDS FOR
A MONTH TO MAKE SURE THEY WEREN'T STOOL PIGEONS, BEFORE THEY WERE
GIVEN THE PRIVILEGE OF ADDRESSING THEIR FELLOW OFFICERS ON SOME
IMPORTANT ASPECT OF THE WAR. THE EXCELLENT BRITISH MIKE:
ALL UP.

IN RECENT YEARS, AT LEAST ONE LUFTWAFFE VETERAN ASSOCIATION,
THAT OF J.G.2, THE RICHTHOFEN GESCHWADER, SENT PEOPLE TO LONDON TO
GET COPIES OF THE INTERROGATION REPORTS OF THEIR PILOTS. THEY DID
IT CHRONOLOGICALLY AND WERE SO SHOCKED AT THE VAST AMOUNT OF VITAL
DATA REVEALED BY THEIR BUDDIES THAT, IN ACUTE REVULSION, THEY
STOPPED LOOKING. I ASSUMED THEN THAT "EVERYONE" HAD “TALKED," WHICH
IS TRUE. 7

Il. %I AM 75 YEARS OLD PARTLY PARALYZER ON MY LEFT SIDE FROM A
STROKE IN DEC. 1993. I WAS NEARLY FULLY REHABILITATED WHEN, IN MAY
1994, I WAS HIT BY CONSTANT MUSCLE SPASMS ALL UP AND DOWN MY LEFT
SIDE. THIS RATHER RARE CONDITION, BASICALLY A SUDDEN SUPER-HUMAN
TIGHTENING OF ALL THE MUSCLES, WITH AFTER EFFECTS LASTING UNTIL THE
NEXT SPASM, HAVE MADE IT INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT FOR ME TO STAND UP,
WALK, OR EVEN SIT UP FOR VERY LONG. IN A FEW DAYS, WHEN ALL THE
MANY MEDICINES ARE HERE, WILL BEGIN A 20-WEEK HOMEOPATHIC CURE FOR
THE SPASMS UNDER DR. SCHRAMM, A LEADING SPECIALIST HERE. I CAN'T
VERY WELL LEAVE FOR 20 WEEKS.

WILL ALSO BE IN TOUCH WITH MY CONGRESSMAN AND SENATORS.

Subj: Ex-CIA Agent Adds Fuel to Kennedy Assassination Fire

Ex-CiA Agent Adds Fuel to Kennedy Assassination Fire
By Michael Dorman
(c) 1996, Newsday

The chief CIA investigator of President John F, Kennedy's assassination has
testified that another high CIA official - noted for seeking conspiracies -
disobeyed orders in repeatedly conferring with the Warren Commission shortly
after the murder. The witness also safd a colleague once told him that the CIA
official, the late

James Angleton, “has ties to the Mafia.”

Almost 35 vears after the assassination, the identity of the witness, who held
various top-secret CiA jobs, is considered so sensitive that federal authorities
insist on withholding his true name. He is Known only by the alias “John
Scelso.”

While Scelso testified before the House Select Committee on Assassinations in
1978, his 192-page testimony was kept secret until now. It has Just been sent to
the National Archives by the Assassination Records Review Board, a federal
agency that screens assassination documents and makes public those that do not
endanger national security.

Sceiso’s testimony, which criticized operations of the CIA, FBI, Secret Service
and other agencies, likely will renew debates, especially among conspiracy
theorists, on the assassination and how {t was investigated.

When Kennedy was assassinated on Nov. 22, 1963, Scelso was chief of aClA

branch

responsible for operations in Mexico and Central America. Richard Helms, the CIA
chief of clandestine services and later the agency's director, placed Scelso in
charge of the assassination investigation. Angleton, a counterintelligence
official with close ties to FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, “immediately went

into action to do all the investigating,” Scelso testiffed, criticizing the

move sharply.

“Helms called a meeting at which Angleton and a lot of others were present and
told everybody that | was In charge and that no one should have any

conversations with anyone about the Kennedy case without my being present -
which was violated from the word ‘go’ by Angleton, who dealt with the FBI and
the Warren Commission and (Warren Cornmission member and former CIA Director
Allen) Dulles himself, ... Angleton ignored Helms’ orders. | tried to get Helms

to make hirn obey and Heims said, ‘You go tell him.’ "

Angleton, who died in 1987, spent much of his career searching for conspiracies
- belfeving that there was a Communist mole in the CIA - and was presumed by
other CIA officers to have tried to press a conspiracy theory on the Warren
Cornmission, The commission found no evidence of a conspiracy. Angleton.was
fired

in 1975. Years jater, a mole was found - Aldrich Ames - but he had entered the
CIA after Angleton’s dismissal.

At one point in the 1978 House testimony, committee attorney Michael Goldsmith
asked, “Do you have any reason to belleve that Angleton might have had ties to
organized crime?”

“Yes," replied Scelso, who 1s now retired and lives abroad, government sources
said. He said the Justice Department once asked the CIA to determine the true
names of people holding numbered bank accounts in Panama because the Mafia was
hiding Las Vegas “skim” money there. “We were in an excellent position to do
this and told them so - whereupon Angleton vetoed it and said, ‘That is the
oureau's (FBI's) business.’ Sceiso sald he discussed the situation with

another CiA officer. “And he smiled a foxy smile and said, “Well, that's

Angleton’s excuse. The real reason 1s that Angleton himself has ties to the

Mafia and he would not

want to doubie-cross them.’ ”

On another subject, Sceiso gave Kennedy conspiracy theorists a slight piece of

ammunition. A Soviet defector, Yuri Nosenko, was known to have told
investigators. that Lee Harvey Oswald - identified by the Warren Commission as
Kennedy's assassin - was not a Soviet agent. But Scelso said: “| later heard
that Nosenko was discovered to have been dissembling, not being on the level.
That information was imparted to me by CIA officers.”

Based on the information CIA headquarters had on Oswald before the assassination
~ chiefiy that he had been in the Marine Corps and defected to the Soviet Union,
then returned - Scelso said he saw no reason to pay him special heed. “Oswald
just seemed to me to be a small-potatoes defector,” he said. But he conceded

that significant information about Oswald - known to CIA agents in Mexico City,
for example - had not reached headquarters before the assassination.

it dealt chiefly with Oswald's visits to the Soviet and Cuban embassies in
Mexico City and his attempts to obtain a Cuban visa two months before the
assassination. Scelso said the information failed to reach Washington because of
simple overwork and bureaucratic delays in the Mexico City office. He revealed
that all the outside telephone lines at the Soviet and Cuban embassies were
tapped by American agents and that calls Oswald made to them were recorded.
After Oswald was arrested, Scelso revealed, agents compared audiotapes made
while he was in custody with the wiretaps and determined that he was the same
man who had visited the embassies.
