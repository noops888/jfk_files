TRUE. THE PERSON IN QUESTION COULD JUST AS EASILY
HAVE BEEN CONNECTED WITH THE BRAVO GROUP IN LATE 6gS,
MIANI'S RECORDS OF SABOTAGE OPERATIONS IN VENEZUELA
PRIOR TO 1968 ARE INCOMPLETE. CARACAS, THEREFORE,
MAY BE ABLE TO ISOLATE Two OR THREE PERSONS WHO
FIT THIS GENERAL CRITERIA FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION.

D. HYSAGE-1 ALLEGES THAT QUESADA WAS IN NEW
YORK CITY AREA AND MET WITH HER DURING THE WEEK OF
13 SEPTEMBER. IF THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENED, IT MIGHT
ELIMINATE ROGELIO RODRIGUEZ (DEPENDING UPON HIS
PRESENT WHEREABOUTS) AS A PRIME CANDIDATE.

FOR HEADQUARTERS: STATION MIAMI WOULD APPRECIATE
RECEIVING PICTURES OF THE CUBAN COUNTER-SURVEILLANCE
