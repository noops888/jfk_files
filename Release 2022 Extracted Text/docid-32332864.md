which was organized by JOSEPh GIGGIONI and LOUIS

CoMI, When the gilben Company ran into financial dirficulties,

it resulted in an investigation by the Internal Revenue

service,

and a great deal of newspaper publiolty was given to alleged

irregulanities. in

the operation of this business

of by MARIOTTI and his associates.

He also realized that these

men were engaging in questionable activities and felt that 1f

he continued his association with them 1t could Jeopardize his

standing as

an accountant.

Mr 2o, he decided to aiscontine hs Falstlone 1th

and his' associates.

He wrote registered letters to

MARGIOTIL, CLOVESE;

RIPEPI and others, advising them he would

no longer

handle their accounting

At that time he would have

discontinued his association with LA ROCCA except for the fact

that

he was then doing accounting for LA ROCCA in connection

some litigation involving most of LA ROCCA's financial

interests.

LA ROCCA

asked him to continue doing his accounting
