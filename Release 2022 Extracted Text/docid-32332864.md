After Mr, GOLDBERG became a,Certified Public Accountant in. the
State of Maryland in 1932, he decided to engage in public

practice of, accounting on a full time professional basis. — At

that time, the economic situation’ in the country was poor and

he found it difficult to make a living. In about 1937,. he
developed Mr. ROY MC GINNIS as a client. MC GINNIS operated a
music machine distributing business and is currently in the coin
machine business under the name of Roy McGinnis Corporation,
Maryland Avenue, Baltimore, Maryland. In about 1940, Mr.. MC GINNIS
took Mr. GOLDBERG to Pittsburgh, Pa. where he introduced him to
SAM MANNARINO and his associates who were in the same type of
business. .At the request of SAM MANNARENO and some of his
associates, he took them on as clients and performed auditing

and tax return services for them. Through ‘MANNASRINO he became
associated with SEBASTIAN JOHN LA .ROCCA, MIKE GENOVESE and

ANTHONY RIPEPL. ; He also became acquainted with CHARLES J.
MARGIOTYI, then attorney, and political power in Pennsylvania

who is now deceased, Through MARGIOTTI he took over the accounting
for the Filben Corporation of Chicago, Illinois, which was
organized to manufacture coin operated music’ machines. Although
this company has been defunct for a long time, Mr. GOLDBERG” ©
made other contacts which Yesulted in developing clients, For ne
example, in Baltimore he’ acquired’ ’ “the account’ of the Cee” eeite
Music Company, which was’ organized’ by JOSEPH GIGLIOTTI and LOUIS
COMI, When the Pilben Company ran into finameial difficulties,

 it-resulted in an investigation. -by” the- Internal Revenue Service,

and a great deal of newspaper publicity was given, to alleged:
irregularities, in the eperation..or this business. Mr .: GOLDBERG.
had been placed in a compromising, position by of fficials
company and realized at that time that he had been taken
of by MARGIOTTI and his associates. He also realized that these
men were engaging in questionablé activities and felt that if
he..continued his association with them it could jeopardize his
standing as an ‘accountant. =~!

In ‘about 1950, he deéided +6 discontinue his relationship with
MARGIOTTI and his ‘associates. He wrote registered letters to
MARGIOTTI, ‘GENOVESE; RIPEPI and'others, advising them he would
no,.longer handle..théir-accounting. At that time he would have
discontinued Ris assectation with LA ROCGA except for the fact
that he was then doing accounting for LA’ ROCGA in connection
with some litigation involving most of LA ROCGA's financial
interests. LA ROCCA asked him to continue doing his accounting

on oO.

work et. least until Litigation: was completed. .Actually, this
situation has continued and LA ROGCA has become further indebted
to him, so, that at present LA ROGGA owes. him a considerable
amount of money for accounting fees. E

In the past several years, LA ROGCA has entertained Mr. ‘GOLDBERG
at his residence for dinner and. to meet his: family. Therefora,.-
in the latter part of 1957, when Visiting with LA ReCGA, .. 7
Me. GOLDBERG invited him:-to attend the wedding of his son, which
was..to be held at Philadelphia, Pa In February, .1958,. the

Mr, GOLDBERG stated that handling the accounting for coin :
machine operators and others close to t eof business.
has. been a very small part of his Boe: biee.. B® cor. :
stated that he still has some clients in “this. yee of business,
but..to his, knowledge none of them are. numbers operatora.op are
engaged in illegal. activities.

Buring the course of the aforementioned. interview, G@LDBERG:
requested that his identity be concealed in reporting any:
infermation: furnished by him. .He assured the, interyLewingoagant
of his desire to cooperate fully: with the FBI in any- investigation
where he could be of assistance, Although he furnished) no. informa-
tion of particular. speclfle importance it was helleved by. the
interviewing agent. that his friendly. attitude and cosperation merit

can furnish immediate assistance the preper groundwork will
