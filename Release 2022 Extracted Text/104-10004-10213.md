2022 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992

X177-27221

8 July 1964

MEMORANDUSA FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT . : Discussion with Warren Commission Stall Member

REFERENCE: Lelter from J. Lee Ränkin, General Counsel of the

President's Commission, to Ms. Richard Helmo

dased 3 July 1964

SLAUSEN aTly on rinstious.

Wilh tE Aproval o C/SR and the DD?. I met with Mr: ".

David Slawson of lit staff of the President's Commission on the

Assassination of President Kennedy al 1400 hours on iris date in

the Commission's offices at 200 Maryland Avroue, M.E., Washinzion,

D.C. The purpose of this meeting was to discuss apparent inconsistencies

in material provided the Commission by ClA aid by te Departmeri of

State which were called to our attention in a lettI from the General

Counsel of the Commission so Mr. Helms, dated 3 July 1964.

2. By way sl introduction, Mr. Slawson said lisat in the portion of the

Commission's report that he vas writing, he sould have to deal with the

question of wher er or not the OSWALDs" deparure from the USSR - and

the circumstances (i.e. timing) of that departure - sere unusual or

suspicious in any nay.

He expressed his belief that tej probably sere

lot and cited Somet relaxation in such matters

in tat post-stalin era.

lowever, he warled to be sure in his own mird that our information ma.

not in conflice sin that which the Commissior zad received from Stake

since all of that information would remain in ice records of the

Commission.

3. After stating my belief that there was to real disagreement or

inconsistency berzeen lhe information from CLA and that from State, 1

expressed the vies that the matter resolved jestil into three questions:

SEGRET

a. Do the Soviet authorities normally permit sovies

citizens married tu foreign nationals lo emigrate from the

Soviet Union to the homelands of their spouses?

ba: Do they normally permit such Soviet cilizens to

accompany (i.e. depart simultantously with) lheir spouses

from the Soviet Union?

c. How long does it take such Soviet citizens to get

Soviet exit visas ior such a purpose (time lapse from application

to granting of visas)?

1. Concerning the firet two questions (3a and 36 above) I pointed out.

that we had addressed ourselves mainly to the question of Sovie: citizens

being allowed to accompany their spouses abroad while State dealt only

with the larger question of Soviets married to foreigners being allowed

to emigrate vithout reference to whether or not they left simulta. tously

with or at another time from their spouses. MI. Slawson cornmented

that this explanation was most helplul ard he reread what both se and

State had said in that light.

5. By may of further explanation. I said that the statements in

piragraph 6 of our memorandum of 6 April 1964 concerning Societs being

permitted to accompany their foreign spouses abroad were based on a

review of 26 cases, of which 10 involved Americans.. In only four of

these cases did a Soviet wife leave the USSR in the company of her foreign

husband; in 14 of the cases the foreign spouse departed alone; and in the

remaining seven cases insufficient details are known to permit 1s to

categorize them. I added that although State's information began by

citing the issuance of 724 quota and non-quota immigrant visas by the

American Embassy in Moscow during the period FY 1954 to December

1903, it did not indicate how many of loese visas were for Sovier citizens

who had married U.S. nationals. Actually State provided detailed

information for only sixteen cases and did not indicate in many of saese

whether or not the Soviet was permitted to accompany the foreiza spouse.

16. In response to

SECRET

6.

In response to a question from Mr. Slandos I stated that most

of the 26 cases upon trich ve based cur slatements involved foreign

students, exchange teachers and other, relalively transient persons.

and while a number of cases have certain points is common, they bear.

little similarity to the OSWALD case in that none involved a defector who .

married prior to repatrialing. I noted that paragraph 6 of our 6 April

1964 memorandum to tre Commission had pointed this out. Mi. Slawson

indicated that hf was now satisfied on this matter.

Concerning the length of time raken by Soviet authorities to

process exit visas for Soviet citizens married lo foreign nationals

(question 3c above), I gested that, in my upinion, tbe information

provided by State (in the third enclosure to MI. Meeker's letter)

substartially corresponded to the viens expressed in paragraphs 6 and 7

of our memorandum to the Commission dated 6 Apräl 1964. Mr. Slawson

asked ií it would be possible to elaborate paragrapa 7 of our memorandum

of 6 April by providing e statistical breakdous of the cases on shich our

statements were based. I indicated that this could be done.

8. At this point tI. Slawson stated that as a nesult of our discussion

he felt that the questior s! possible inconsistencies bad been resolved.

However, he asked that 'de send a brief aritten reply to the Commission's

letter of 3 july 1964 embodying the substance of tbat I had said concerning

the basis for statements included in pur 6 April 1965 memorandum. (This

would include the gist of the draft reply to the Commission which I showed

to C/SR on 8. July plus an elaboration uf our stalements concerning Soviet

visa applications. ]

9. Mr. Slawson indicated that he sould be sending farts of his report

dealing with the Soviet intelligence services to ClA for checking as to

their accuracy. He did not say when this would occas.

10. After concluding the meeting with Mr. Stassor, I fead Volume 52

of the transcript of testimony before the Commission.

This included the

reinterview of Marina OSWALD.
