MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT . : Discussion with Warren Commission Staff Member

REFERENCE: Letter from J. Lec Rankin, Gezeral Counsel of the
Presidcat's Commission, to Mr. Richard Helms

dated 3 July 1964

SLAWLEN 9 Thly

David Slawson of the staff of the President's Commission on the

Assassination of President Kennedy at 14060 hours on date in

the Commission's offices at 200 Maryland Avenue E., Washington,
D.C. The purpose of this meeting was to discuss apparent inconsistencies
in material provided the Commission by CIA and by the Department of
State which were called to our attention in a lester from the General
Counsel of the Cummission to Mr. Helms, dated 3 July 1964.

2. By way of introduction, Mr. Slawson said that in the portion of the! -
Commission's report that he was writing, he sould have to deal with the
question of wheter or not the OSWALDs! departure from the USSR - and
the circumstances (i.e. timing) of that departure - were unusual or

: suspicious in any way. He expressed his belief that they probably were

not and cited Soviet relaxation in such matters jn the post-Stalin era.
However, he war.ted to be sure in his own mirg that our information was
not in conflict that which the Commission bad received from State
since all of that information would remain in the records of the
Commission.

3. After stating my belief that. there was 29 real disagreement or
inconsistency between the information from CLA and that from State, I
expressed the view that the matter resolved itseif into three questions:

a a. Do the Soviet authorities normally permit Soviet
: citizens married to foreign natiznals to emigrate from _
Soviet Union to the homelands of their spouses?

i : b. | Do they normally permit such Soviet citizens to
accompany (i.e. depart'simultancously with) their spouses
from the Soviet Union?

: c. How long does it take such Soviet citizens to get
~ Soviet exit visas ior such a purpose (time lapse from application
to granting of visas)?

4. Concerning the first two questions (3a and 3b above) I pointed out .
_that we had addcessed ourselves mainly to the question of Soviet citizens
being allowed to accompany their spouses abroad while State dealt only
with the larger question of Sovicts married to foreigners being allowed
to emigrate without reference to whetner or not they left simultaxeously
with or at another time from their spouses. Mr. Slawson commented
that this explanation was most helpful and he reread what both we and
State had said in that light.

5. By way of further explanation, I said that the statements in
paragraph 6 of our memorandum of 6 April 1964 concerning Soviets being
permitted to accompany their foreign spouses abroad were based on a
review of 26 cases, of which 10 involved Americans. . In only four of
these casce did a Soviet wife leave the USSR in the company of her foreign
husband; in 14 of the cases the foreign spouse departed alone; and in the

: remaining seven cases insufficient details are known to permit us to
categorize them. I added that although State's information began by
citing the issuance of 724 quota and non-quota immigrant visas by the
American Embassy in Moscow during the period FY 1954 to December
1963, it did not indicate how many of these visas were for Soviet citizens
who had married U.S. nationals. Actually State provided detailed
information for only sixteen cases and did not indicate in many of these
whether or not the Soviet was permitted to accompany the foreign spouse.

1/6, In response to

\
6. In response tz a question from Mr. Slawsoa I stated that most

of the'26 cases upon which we based Gur statements involved foreign
students, exchange teachers and other relatively transient persons,
and while a number of cases have certain points im common, they bear

‘little similarity to the OSWALD case in that none imvolved a defector who

married prior to repatriating. I noted that paragraph 6 of our 6 April
1964 memorandum to the Commission had pointed this out. Mr. Slawson
indicated that hg was now satisfied on this matter. :

‘ 9, Concerning the Jength of time taken by Soviet authorities to
process exit visas for Soviet citizens married to foreign nationals
(question 3c above), I stated that, in my vpinion, the information
provided by State (in the third enclosure to Mr. Meeker's letter)
substantially corresponded to the views expressed in paragraphs 6 and 7
of our memorandum to the Commissicn dated 6 April 1964. Mr. Slawson
asked if it would be possible to elaborate paragraph 7 of our memorandum
of 6 April by providing 2 statistical breakdown of the cases on which our

1 indicated that this coald be done.

Statements were based.

8. At this point Mr. Slawson stated that as a result of our discussion
he felt that the question of possible inconsistencies bad been resolved.
However, he asked that we eend a brief written reply to the Commission's
letter of 3 Guly 1964 emtndying the substance of what I had said concerning
the basis for statements included in our 6 April 1964 memérandum. {This
would include the gist of the draft reply to the Commission which I showed
to C/SR on 8 July plus an elaboration of our statements concerning Soviet

visa applications. ]

9. Mr. Slawson indicated that he would be sending parts of his report
dealing with the Sovict intelligence services to CIA for checking as to
their accuracy. ‘He did not say when this would occar.

10. After concluding the meeting with Mr. Slawson, I yead Volume 52
of the transcript of testimony before the Commissiam. 's included the

reinterview of Marina OSWALD.

In oaly four of these 26 cases, did the Soviet wife leave the Soviet Tuaton in the

company of her-husband. In one of these four cases, an Itallac Communist
