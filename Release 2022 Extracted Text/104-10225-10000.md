to the University though financed, as is the rest of tho University,
by the French Government, and include a special institute for
interpreters, an institute for economic science, and a European
Institute, The support of the French Government of thie University,
aside from its merits, 4e part of the French attempt to Europeanize
the Saar.

3+, The European Institute, devoted to European unity, is a
recent creation and is largely the result of the promotions of
former Deputy, Andre Philip. It was the European Institute to
which the Herald Tribune article Specifically refers,

4. The University participated extensively, especially the
European Institute, in the European Youth Campaign. Some of the
Specific activities were as follows:

March 1952: The Campatyn cooperated with the International
Instituts of the University of Sarrebruck in arranging a

meeting of young professors in the Saar and another meeting
of youth leaders, both to discuss European problems. Filme

vere supplied by the Campaign for both these meetings.

Py the end of April, 25 youth organizations (practically all)
in the Sear were associated vith the Campaign. During April,
May) and June an extensive program of discussion groups was
arranged in the secondary schools throughout the Saar. These
groups were sponsored Jointly by the Campaign and the youth
Broups of the Saar. The groups discussed all phases of the
unity question but concentrated particularly on the Schuman


Plan due to the economic Position of the Saar in this
matter. Films and publications of the Campaign were used
in the discussions. 7000 students participated,

During June 1952, in cooperation with the Campaign, students
and profescors of the International Institute formed a
committee along with youth leaders to discuss the particular

le At-the last Projoct Roviow Committee meeting on NCFE, you

asked that tho State Dopartment be consulted on policy in respect

to National Councils.
however, for your information and in order to enable you to anawor
quastions which may bo ralood by Meacra. Dolboaro or Miller, I want
to explain to you how the I0 Divieion 4s presontly handling exile

affairs.

A roview by State has bogun. Hoantine,

3. We have taken tho following action to try to insure

orderly efforts to fuse or coordinate the various oxile activities
gonduc ted :

as Tits division has asked the concerned area divisions
to initiate plans for reorganization and unification of
each nattonal council. ‘the resultant paper is then
coortinated with the proper authoritias in State and a final

line is agreed upon. .

d. This plan is then communicated to NCFS and the
organisation is asked for comments, criticisms and
suggestions,

ce After such’are made or agreed upon, the paper
becomes the policy directive wich charts NCSE's course of
actions incl i rf



To date two such policy directives havo boen written.
The first:was a plan for the reorganization of tha kumantan
National Council, It.waa mubmitted to HICK, and tiie
oriticioms and sugiastions have eee facorporateds the

3. I think that Radio Free furope hao maintained excellent disci-
pline on thia subject. You can imagine that it is under vonsiderable
pressure from Iron durtain eniyration to take tho line of aarly rope
for liberation in the ;rospect that in sone way American oubile epinion

1. 1 opent an hour and o quartar in Now York on Friday,
lb November, with Hr. Robert Lang of Radio Free Luropo., Tho major
portion of this time was devoted to a bricfin by Lang of tho NCFE
structure and the position which RFE occuploo in it, includin; the
Philosophy of RFE operations, Lang gave on iapressive performance
and struck mo on such short acquaintance ap an individual of ability,

Judgment, and onargy.

2. Mr. Lang made quite a point of tho fact that hia oparation
inside NCFE 1o virtually indopendent. tle intimated that he receives
no guidance from the President or other officers and hav exponded
considerable effort;in the past seoing to 1% that an iron curtain ia
kopt between RFE and the top comnaal of CFF. Lo said that if AFE
had not developed and expanded according to a philosophy which it
itaslf had originated, it would have got nownere and would still bo
frustrated by shot he kept referring to as thn "old State Department
line” as exemplified by the viows of Devitt lovle, Fred Dolbeare, —
and others.

| As for ag

Hr. Ywradsn and company ore concerned, ho sald that they dealt largely
with Admiral itillor ond his inwdiate staff, It was clear that ho
would prefer to deal directly with vastinrtoa. lie also feols in-
hibited by tho fact that te has to eajole Admral !iller into per=
mission to como to Washinton. i:0 cited as evidence an incident re-
cently when he folt obliged to aak a friend in the State Department to
intercede with Adairal Hiller to perait him to come down here for
consultation.

3. There was nothing bitter or frustrated in Hr, Lang's re-
marks, father he struck mo ag an individual who was discussing the

facts of life, be wiat they may.

The following mocorandim, I balievo, discuesse xost of the
points rateed by Hr.

1. Sexipte prepared in Munich are almost never read by Auericans
before brordcant.elthouh the goneral eontent of seach broadcast is
agreed upon in programing conferaicos botwean tho Anerican and exile
statfs. ‘the reauens why tho broadcasts aro not real by Anoricans
bofore they go on the air are as follow

&- Because tho natural inclination of Avoricans 18 to
change tho troadcests, and such changes, AFF officials feal,
ere likely to.lessen the "gonuino” quality of axtle hee
enets for the linteners.

be Bocauce the exiles fecl thaasolves to be patriote
working for thetr countries, and the sutmission of scripts
to Anorieana before they are broedcast would be regarded by
the oxtloa as casting dovbt upon their sllogtance and fervor.

The American staff bolieves that it can exercioa policy eontral by
sugrentions during progran discus:done rather than by making dole-
tiena and corrections in the scripts thmsolves.

3. Ho doubt RFC hae made the atstakes Hr. mentions in
connection with the items about the woamess of tie fron Curtain and
tho ease of crossing it, and the Caechoslovekian curroney devaluation.
On tne firat point, Mr, dates are in error, for fre did not
go on the alr until July + Agsuntng tist meane that suc
broadcasts were made from that date until fpril 1951, it smuld be
noted that this was the very berimiing of R°5 waen all of its broad-

Rot occurred to TONIC’s own people or in reference to evento that are
not a matter of public knowledge.

another contribution to the thinking of 1 officials, it to not
possible to-point to specific uses of tho material ouggasted,

d. To be-most. useful, propaganda guidanco from PY should
treat the dovelopmont of spectal themes that have a specific relation
to precise U. 3. Governnent operetions and objectives avide- from
gonoral U. 3. foreign policy goals. To be moat useful to RFE, such
guidance should be dovoloped over a poriod of timo in anticipation
of the actual facte or operations making up such programa.

In the Rumanicn case, MC © support for refugee netivities

In the Crechoslovak eage, CPE hig chinnelod its support gor
refugee activities through the Council of Free Chechoslov.ikia, a
Haticaz1 Council, which wus the victio of n political oplit
jasting from January 1951 until July 4y 1952. The Council of
Free Czechoslovskiu, in turn, channeled some of this Support to
en orgenizition which enjoys tie status of voluntary agency, the
Ameriec.n Pund for Czechoslovik ke?ugees. This organ ation,
dike Rumanian welfure, inc., includes Auoric-ns of ita Board of
Directors, which 46 ch dred by Profenoor Janes Shotwell. Unlike
Rumanian self:re, howovar, the R in Germany and Austria recuived

World Pederation, the ‘sorid Council of Churches, the American

more funds for the Crusade for Freedom, At the prosunt rate of
expenditure, funds will run out on 31 December.

2. was budgeted for the Crusade this year, Wo

havo tol ral Miller that since the Crunado was unable to

live within this budget, wo were certain that the Agency would
appropriate mre money to wind 4t up, although wo have explained

* that his a3 embarrassing because the PRC had expressly.
approved) instead of a larger amount in tho boliof that

less money-snoula be expended this year, We have naked Admiral
Miller to provide us with a financial statement of tho Crusade
cost to date as well as a breakdown of the further amount needed,

3. The Crusade this year has ao far cost only a quarter of
last.year's expenditure and half of the amount exponded in 1950,
Recoipts are up, 140% over last ycar at this date. On the whole,
a much better job has teen done to date than wo anticipated ==
and purely in terms of the amount raised the performance has

been superior,

eople in the New York office talk-about fe the payment of

to who worked for approximately one month
n drawing up @ Dimes for Freedom campaign which, as you recall,
was rejected as a basis for this year's cempaign. :

5. No accounting of Crusade funds expended in tho field haa
ever been made, and in a fund-raioing campaign it 1s perhaps
impossible to do soz Nevertholess, rocorde involving payments
for expense money to private citizens onzazed,for the duration of
the campaign are chaotic. You will recall that Sponcer Phenix,
Treasurer of NCE, refuses to have anything to do with expenditures

for the Crusade,

6. Since.we are winding up the Crusade this year and will
attempt to-place it ‘on a more reliable basis through the Heritage
Foundation, I suggest that you ascure Admiral Miller that funds
sufficient to wind up the Crusade will be forthcoming and that. you
inetruct the 19 Division’to expedite a protect granting these
funds, I further suggest that in view of the allegations above,
which I repeat for your private background information, you keep the
position of the Agency faultless by requesting from Admiral Miller
a budget in as much detail as possible for the amount necessary to

liquidate the Crusade.

Dear Darcy:

This {5 in reference to your telopiune call of this afternoon,
T havo just had a 111 report on the nalter of the seren vieitore.

Tan afraid you have gut yourself en the hock on tila one und
nothing can be cone about it oxcept to go tarough with the bargain
you made, This bargain, the documents indicute, was to oring tne
seven Cxechs over here and take the re: naivility you assumed when
you elrned the peven coclarations of supcert affidavits.

Now having gotten that bad neve off ry chest, ¢ haswen to add
that I co not think tiie ts coing tc be burdensome te you. You are
doing a read public serrice, as I shall axplain in a moxent, and all
af us will do our level dost two heln 7 ae

T wealite that you did not think you vero agsucing the responsi-
bility Tor seven people. It is clear, havever, that everyone olse
thought you were, anc I think it 48 sizply 420 lata to change It now,
The Ceuch rozime is attacking the United States for ita handling of
enisress it 1s wttacking tie caxps which you nave seen; tt 1s pointing
up the General hopelessness of an omivre's Lot and ine dulJnose and
dreariness Waicn you have noted at first hand, this litela tric of
our seven friends has oz all he refugoe cirvles in Geramy josniping.
Tt 1a exetting news. It is antoubtedly know Sehind tno Curtein, To
sall tt off now would raks a real difrerence -- not tust in torre of
bho Crusade. but in taras af vnat rafazeen think a>ovt the United
Staton ond united States attisens.

&s follows:

The procedwe from 2 on soars to lay itaalf
The seven retugeos will arrive sonetize durin; th
Tis arrival dsto is imortant, 116°5 has nade every effort to
expedite it so that they can come tn Necexher, ant overwhelning
Tessons aught to dictate a rostoonement. ney will so to work and do
whatever you, Clyde and ond want then to do on bebalr of the crusade,
After their work for tne Crusade ta aver, al sever. oubtlesa will
wish to remain in tha Untted States. a will atl thea fointly try
& find jobs and placas far then, The visas are yoo! ruil next
Anril, but if they can ind Jods here Lt wiil srubdably be nossible
for es to secure special Leyislation’ for the: to etay an Ladefinitely.



How as to the uwust.sne you raise in your lotter of tiovexdor 2hth.
The National Cormitces for a tree Luroze would certaluly look ‘after
thepe pecnlo whan they arrive und wile they are ire except insofar
as they are d. dy yOu vo take un certain activiules ou bowalf of
(ie Crusade. The National Coumttteo si:ould also cooperate in trying to
help you in sour effort to find jobs ior tien wien their tour is aver,
apd I an suro the people tiere wil do thelr boat. i ai aunding a
copy of thin nota to. iwiltncy aml T know that ho will cooperate to
una fullest,

AS to your secuisi quewtion, I trink tho exponges of all seven
ought to ha pata far out of Crusad funds, ‘hey are over here on
venalf of the crusade wd you aru tha one wao asked thes to coma.

On the third quastion, ao I indicated above, £ tutnk it would
be a erent blow to Uuliod fietey puvlicles in thie Meld if they were
tw tum crovnd alu their duties were over anu liap back to a dusty

Fefugee carp,
T think tule de tne way the wnole Using ought to rest now and I
2 moet earnestly urge you not to be too concerned ubout your cersonal
Feeponsibilities. Ne wili all be lucky if wo have w tackle no tougher

1g October 1953

Jamming of weetern broadcasts to Russia began oporaatealay” ta. ay
agh8, and yao vell oatablishod by early 1949, firet against YOA then
also against BBC... Satellite langusge program jamming began firet -
from Fusetan stations end thon from jamming statione located in the
Satellites proper. When RFE tranemisoions began in 1950, the
organisation and equipment were available for the new target.

At the present tine, the organization for jamming - including
the transmitters, the monitoring otations to watch for the undeatred
prograns, and the control network to-direct the jamors to the terget +
ie apparently integrated throughout the Bloo, vith a certain amount

of cooperation between countries. That 19, programs directed. to one

Batellite country may be Jamed not only from within the country but
from Rusoia and from neighboring Satellites.

At least come of the Jambers are closely controlled 60 that
efforts to evade them by changeo in frequency or schedules are frequently
met by 8 proapt reaction on the part of the Jamer -- within'a minute
or less. :
fhe extent of integration of the total Bloc Jamming system makes
4t very diffieult to ceperate the effort contributed within the Satellites.
However, it 10 present1y estimated that; about 900 tranonitters are in
the Jamming effort within the Bloo, and these appear to be fairly vell
@tstributed throughout the total of the frequencies that are being used
at ony given tins. Therefore, at tines vhen RYE io broadcasting to
the Satellite countries with & considerable nunber, of frequencies, thera

are undoubtedly. bundreds of transmitters jaming these frequencies.

19 October 1953

The effectiveness of the Jamming le difficult to assess quanti=
tatively from tho fev available observation locations within the Orbit
and from the fan mail received. Bveever, in general, it 10 apparent
that jamming 1s most effective in large citiest approaching 100%.
In rural areas, tho picture varies from tine to time and from place
te place, but it appearo that a considerable proportion of the prograns
to the Satellites can be received. For example, the RVR monitor io

David is himoelf a king-sizo free wheeler. Although be is unquestionably
“one of the French “doers, " as opposed to "talkers," in this field, he

ie also-quite a big-mouth and inclined to over -talk, over-promiae and over«
indulge in cloak-and-dagger stage settiag. MU he hasn't gota guard, armed
to the teoth, with a beret and a half-burned cigarette glued to his undortlip,
lurking outside the dining-room, he can't enjoy hiq meal. :

I would suggest that you show the attached to Abbott Washburn, George
Morgaa, Tom Braden and/or Bill Durkee, and Joc Phillips (also this note) °
and suggeot that they work out whe-should consider himself responsible.

I personally hope Joe Phillips will be willing to take it on.

The following is {rom a diopatch written by Me. William Tyler, dated

22 Juno 1953.

1. After a recent coaversation with Jean Paul David, at which time he
outlined hie activities and ideas in connection with the mission with which
he 19 charged by Georgos Bidault, I received a letter from him,

2. It will be seon from this letter that David is most anxious that the
roport which he will make on his survey should reprosent, ‘without committing
any one Country, a syathesis of the views and the resources of the Western
poworg allied under NATO, in the broad field of propaganda and peychological
warfare dosigned to build support for Western defense policy and to promote é
the achlevement of the odjoct:ves of these palicies,

y which we-have to face, and which we

3. It ocdiirs to me that a difficult,
is due tothe organisational otructure

are probably unique in having to face;
within which we operate officially in the general field under diecussion. - fm

@ country like Italy, for oxamplo, it is possible for David to have exchanges

of views with high officials of.the-government and to feet reasonably sure

that even though euch views are not to be taken ag a commitment, they do fn fact
rabrecent the disposition of the government in question, or any government
likely to succéed it, toward these prablams. In our case, however, it seems

to me that it will requiro carefcl preparation to determine with whom David
should consult and to work out a constructive position which will influence

his report asd hie recommendations ina direction which we approve,

4. It ia particularly difficult for mo to make epecific recommendations,
since developmenta iu Washington in the Inst few months are difficult to ae
keep up with fram overseas. It would, therefore, be particularly helpful
views at this stage on the following points, assuming
will go tothe States in late September on the last leg of his survey:

a. With whom should he mest for basic discusuions. (It occure to
me that a suitable body, if of ill in existence, would.%e the Psychological
Operations Coordinating Cammittes.) i

b. Within what limits at this time are we prepared to discuss the
Problem of concerted action for the psychological strength of the North :
Atlaatic Community.

5. Aa headquarters is aware; C. D. Jackson knows David personally,
and it would perhaps be useful to arrange for conversations with him enc

ony group he might have in mind.:.- It is true that the position of David
[Be is anomalous, ‘since the survey on which he je
| ie of the most official

engaged, |



vu Oll

kind possible. As headquarters has pointed out, his intoroste ia hie present

mission in reality pertain more to the State Department-and NATO than
tous, and it ms to mo that we should not be in the direct lino of fire
except in the capacity of individual observera or participants in the
conversations he will hat ‘It would, therefore, seam to be all the more
important that wo arrivo ; clear understanding among oursclves as to
how David's trip to the States will be organised and what ie to ba the
respective role of the componeat elomonts in the psychological effort with
regard to hia survey. :

Wy doar BILL,

You knov that - probably tovard the exd of September - I an
to leave. for tho United states on o misaion entrusted to me by

the Minfoter of Foreign Affairs,

Ue, Bidault 1s soacerned - and justly 00, about tho problem
connected with the. obsectives of my survey; and my deoire is to
produce @ raaliotic report oince I vish to avoid (you knov my vay
of thinking) tho traditional phrascolegy vhich gensrally tates
the place of action.

To date, in Italy, Belgium, Holland, Denmrh, Norvay .. I
Bave suscocuively conferred with the Prime Ninioters, Ministers of
Foreign Affaire, of Defense, of the Interior, of Education,’ I have.
also comotimes mt with tho Chiefs of staff, and specialists of

iaformation and of psychological warfare.
To all of thom, I have saids

Mr. Bidault has requested me to mika thie survey ant you have
before you the text of the French note which speaks for itself and
seems to roquiro no further comment. I went to ask you to otate,
in writing and without io any vay committing your Goverment or your
particular services, vbat solutions seen reasonable. I vish to gather
811 constructive ideas ca this mtter. Your ideas vill bo weful,
perhaps, to other couatries - oven if you think them inapplicable in
your own. Then, I abali sake a syntheoie of the reports so ascorbled -
adding thereto tha thoughts of tho French Ninicter of Foreign Affairs
in this rospeat. And, at the (NATO) ‘Conference of the 1) at the end
of October, we shall heave available a prograa on the basia of vbich
constructive action can be taken.”

Thore, in telegraphic style, ie by argumnt. I should add that
evoryvhere I found an excellent weloom, overyono accepted this mthod
and prosised mo substantial reports.

But, if in small or medium-size countries, I have ensountered
Bo major difficulties, 1 have no idea of the vay of thinking of your
compatriots om such matters. And this note te for no other reason
thon to ask you to express your thoughts, in view of the excellent
advice you can give mm. ia


I want to.emphooize that, 15 my mind, the reports acd
Guggeetions gathered from ajl the epecialists of ai) ths ministries

Remarks ty George Meany, prosident of American Pedaration of Labor, be-
fore Stockholm meeting at International Confederation of Free Trade
Untoris; in addition to expressing the philosophy of free workers toward
ess developed areas, should have a spoodal oijnificance to ou listeners
at this stage of their struggle ayainot Soviet colonialism. Mesny de-
Olared that fraedom to colonial peoples and inhabitants of protectorates
was something democracios must take steps to inoure as soon as possible,
The Federation (ICFTU) should seo to it that workers in auch territories
enjoyed trade-union organization liberty.

As far as East Germany 19 concerned, most sijmifioant news 40 vote by

support insuryent unions in East Germny and other satollite countries
in their efforts to undermine comminist control", FEO > Prosi=

Meany's announcement would seem to be an event of major significance in
hich all target areas should be equally intorested.

Latest ‘revorts on East German purge reosive most of their meaning fram
fact that a faction Presently losing out is said to be composed of cam
munists who = - while not at all disloyal to the Kremlin = - are not
Muscovites.in'the sense in which the victors are Mustovites. Chances are
that all communist functionaries who did not Spend the last war inside

‘Rusoia are in danger of their jobs or, as tho cuse may bey of their lives.

Human interest stories on recipients of food aid speak for themselves.

for sume higher level political guidance than RFE is getting from
their staff people and talked about getting together a board of people
like George Keinan, etc! I told Spencer that I thought it unlikely
that George would give very much time to this but might be willing
to give them an occasional idea or suggestion.

1. Aa both you and Kr, Slocich agrood in your faforsal coaver=

2. It may be well for us to discuss how we can best take ad-
vantage of rurther denonstrations and riots in the satellite arcas.
Should there be an uprising in Foland, for exaupie, it may be cesir~
able for RFE to place broaicasting time at the dteposal of Radio
Liberation go that the latter my address concentrated ani repeated
appeals to the Red Army not to fire on Polish vorkers and peasusto,
not to interfere in the Folish struggle for freejom, and to vonaider
the Polish people ae the allies of the soviet people 1n their common
etruggle egatnst Commater. It vas thic lice that Kacio Liveration
follewed during the East Ceraan uprisings. In the evert of riots
in Czechoslovakia vhere the Red Aray ie rot present in force and
where the eatellite eecurtty rorces aay te unable to keep order,
close cooperation vill be even core desiratie.

3. Copeidoration could be given to having RFE allot Radio
Liberation regular time cx its oroaccasts to Poland and Bulgeria
where there are large corceztrations of Sovi.t troops 6o that. Radio
Liberation can further build up the ices of o free, doviet anti-

Memorandum for the Kecord

Subject: Conversation with Congressman Kersten
e

1, On 6 May Congressman Kersten addreased a letter t> the
State Department, enclosing a letter dated 6 May 1953, which he had
received (rom Mr, Creighton Scott, a former employee of Radi Free
Europe at Munich, Germany, This letter was highly critical of cer-
tain personnel in RF, porticularly as regards allegations of pro-com-
munist attitudes. Cn 6 July I discussed these criticisms with Congress-
man Kersten in detail, conveying to him orally the material contained
in the memorandum of 17 June 1953 (rom the Director of Security; Subject:
Inquiry by Congressman Kersten; which the Director of Security had noted
should de utilized tn this meeting with Congressinan Kersten, :

2, The. Congreseman hated the difficulty in evaluating the type of
criticisms which Mr. Scott had made but appeared ‘willing to accept our
explanation. rm

3. pana un faten then turned to certain criticisins which
he had heard expressed regarding RFE {rom several sources, including
Scott, One such criticism is that RFE is ad doing the best :t should on
“religious programs, He feels that this aspect of the broadcasis could
probably be considerably strengthened, part.cularly among Catholic 7

elements,

: 4. Mr. Kersien cited the opinion of Count Tarnuwski (sp. 7), a well
known Pele, who told the Congressman that any fourteen year old Soviet
citizen would be so well briefed on Soviet philosophy us to tara up their
noses at the RFE material. The Count (and ersten appears t> agree)
{cele that the Soviet population has more sophisticaied piilogophical
material thrown at them by their own Government, and that it should be an
important function of RFE to counter with an attempt to destroy the Soviet
philosophical mater:al and shake the Soviet faith in their theoreticians.

5. Congressman Kersten realized that it is difficult to capture &
wide audience with philosophical arguments, but he feels that if these
arguments reached a segment of important leaders behind the Iron Curtain,

‘ it would halp to destroy and counter the philosophica! teachings of Marx,
i Lenin, etal. The Congressmen feels that many of our brdadcasts deal
swith economic matters, and, while these are important, RFE should go’ _



Sos

deeper and hit harder on religion and philusophy,

6. While Congressman Kersten is aware that many of the
captive population are not interested in rightest movements, it is
his opinion that RFE cannot beat communiam with socialiam. In
particular, he felt (and Scott bore this out in their conversation)
that we were making ton much use of Czech socialists, and we were
using socialists from the Bence Government which had sought to
compromise with the communists, While he recognizes the popu-
larity of Benes and Masaryx in Czechia, he fecla they are not ef-
fective in Slovakia, where there is a heavy Catholic pupulation.

7. Congressman Kersten plans to go to Eurype, probably
in September. While he did ust say ou, I believe he would welcome
an invitation ty vielt RFE, Munich, Furthermure, as the author of
the Kersten Amendment end of several resvlutions on the enslaved
peoples; at leaat one of which may receive Congressional approval
at this segsion, consideration might be given aa to whether it would
be advisable to requeat the Congressmen lo utilize RFE facilities
to broadcast while he is abrzad. :

General !:edeseu, Cafenes refused beer se of the exclysion.of tie Genre,

after his conversaticns wth the Hing, a mceting with Uafencu subsequent
“to Radescu's death has rot been-nossible. Guernan cid not refuse to

becone a member of the new committee, but wisied to be accepted an

@ representative of the Socialist Party. This woul: ve difficult
because of Gheraants affiliati.n with the left-wn- faction which
seceded from Fetreucu's Farty in 1946, subsequently joining with the
Comunist Party. Anteniade and Verianin have areed ta become menbora
of the now comittee.

5. In a letter to the Fund on 26 May 1953, Gafencu stated that
an attempt shoul be made to vive support to & new comittes through a
large nattonal covre?] in order to establish unity of the leaders and
of the Rusantan colony abtoad. ie gaid tiat on the day of General
Radescu'y death he hai received a letter from thé General aaking bisa
to take over "tis task” to assure the unity of the Rumatians aurdads
Gafencu also wrote that friends in Faris and abroad had asked him to
take over the leadership of’ snall "ad noc” committee with the support
of all the Associaticns of Free Runanians, which he stated ke will do
if tho ew York croup assures hin of their support. After that; he
indicated jie would see if there vould be a possibility of an understanding
with the Vieoianu group, :

7. It would appear that there is Little rcascn to believe that
the Rumanian refuyees will set asice thoir factional di<ferences and

Ho, 26 Dear Adolf, ay

A day cr two before I sailed for surepe in Jamary, 1553, 'I received!
a-typed manuscript copy of tho "Progress Report on the College do 1'Zurope
Libre", which has now appeared in mincographed form under date Of February
27,1953, over thw signatures of Royall Tyler and Nichard Sears!

I admit to considerable curiosity when this document appoared. In
the covering lette> Royall Tyler norely stated, "It comes from Dick Sears".
I rather wondered why this report should be comptled when it was) known I was
coning to durore presumably to examine into condittons and it seemed to mo
immediately that this night. be a counter foll to what it was expected I
would find. In reply to a direct inquiry from :e, Sears now states it was
prepared "to reinvorce the German languago unt project by supplying informa
tion that was apparently lacking.

» wiile the factual material in this report’ can not be questi onéd
— I mean the statistics and the historical portions

ths interpretation of
_ then doos not reflect the disappointing results. This pertains to the work
of the Committee on Awards on the one hand and l J

The sentence (bottom of Page 9 and going over to top ofPago 10),
“These vere mon of advanced education, oxpert in their kiowlsdgo of their ow
countries tut also, most of then, having studied in Frene: instituttons and so
capable of forming a bond for thw atudonts between their training at, homo and

in exile.", ig not on rccurate description of tho caliter of tho tutor.

On Page lh, second lino, I would question deft tely the phrase
Ayoll organized administration". Also on that page, sixth lino, tho| sentenco,
"Special Freneh courses were being given to those who stt11 showed woakness.",
4g misleading. Such couraes ware announced, tut the progren for teaching tho
French language ia only now being outlined with the hels cf. the Fronch language
etaff |I called| for this

purpose,

On tho sane page again, fifth lino from the botton, the phrase "the
severity of the action taken in tho autumn has had a salutary effoct|in
imposing firmer discipline and ‘sotting highor standards” s!rply 19 not so.
The manner in whichthe action way taken, and the inaccuracy of sore of the
Judgnents, whichhad to te reversed, called forth protests from staff |and stu-
dénts alike and did as mich ao anything else to cause prosent lov student morale.

On Page 16, the last sentence in tho first paragraph roads, "A fresh
start in lifo combined with exposure to Western thouht ard practice jill, we
are encouraged to hope, produce a full return." Instead of what the atatemont
implies, the students havo witnessed a_cleavago between tre Zuropean ‘staff and
the Americans, — and the “exposure to Wostorn thoughard practice” has been

anything but inspiring or unifying.

The distribution of this documont can bo and will be vory misleading
by tts implications thxt success has been achieved to an extent that warranta
6ur proceeding on cur present path. That will be unfortunate. wo lve acquired
a fund.af valuable experience and we havo made mistakes. Tre net result is tho

~ You aay bo interested in a diepateh which I received hore'a
couple of days ago and wich I quote as follows:

"On anuary ls, Alexander Booker of the German Foreign Offico
informally brought to our attention a mp of Eastern Europe
whie® apveared in the Lecembor tazus of "News from Behind the
Ince Curtain", a monthly periodieal published by the "National
Comittee for a Freo Europe", Tats map which te ohown in. <
smsit scale on page 1 of this periodical, shows all of Eastern
Germany, including East Pruseia, tio Satellite States, and the
former 3altic States. In the case of the former Gorman terri=
tories east of the Sder-Heisse line, tie area ia simply shown
as belonging; to Poland, and ite sreewar borders are not sot
off ty a dotted line, “With reapec» to Poland, Csechoslovakia
ond iomania, hovever, the territsries that were annexed by
the Soviet Union during or after vorld War IT are clearly
marked dy a dotted Line. Furthermore, tho Eastern Zone of
Qermssy as well a5 Zast Prussia are enown in the samo colore
a tho Sovict Union, whereas the faitic and Satellite States

are Stow in white.

"Altrouzh Booker adeitted that the man itself was not of great

!

imertance, he aavertheless pointed out that it representa
‘a trical examle of the one-sided anti~ierman propagandat

put xt not only by the Hational Cesdttoe for a Free Europe
but also by Haclo Free Europe. Sce% propaganda, he said, can
only increase the. mlexgivinga which nary Gorman, particularly
the rsiugees, already entertain with respect to the activitior

of 2 committee and on:the eperations.of Radto pe on
Germaa soil. /

| A more constructive and objective propaganda policy

of t= comaittee and Fadio Free Zurme along the lines of a

larger Suropean Community that would embrace Poland and Csecho-
elovacia as well as a.reunited Germany and the other European
natizcs would not only contribute to a better understand ing



v9

between the various refugee elements but would also havo
the full support of all Germans, Bookor added.* aad

Incidentally, I think you are doloy an aufally good Job on this

kind of thing. The other night T actually read through an entire
