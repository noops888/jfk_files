SUEJECT:

Conversation with Mr. Jan Nowak

At your request, I had a conversation today with Mr. Jan

Nowak, acad of the Folisi raiio desk of WE in kunich. I ai

that you did not get to see lin.

Our conversation reninded me that

vi work is terribly importait, wilic: is a nice reminder on a busy

afternoon.

2. I say "important" because Nowak reviered with me the letters

he had reccived froin listenors in Poland

and these, togother with nis

out. enormous enthusiast for the hork he is doing, reminded ne that our

long days in hashington have an effect on the lives and hopes of people

Iar away.

Nowak, who was in the' Polish resistance during the war and

wiio on one of his three escapes from Poland at one time spent several

wosks in Switzerland where he had made contact with your ropresentatives,

later worked for the B3C and ho pointed out that at no time during the

Na" was he given to feel by the B3C the sense of responsibility and

mission which he feels in his job in RºE.

He said he was told wien

he Nas brought to RFE: that the

responsibility ior the programs was his

and that if at any time prograns wont on the air wiich wore irresponsible,

then he would lose his job.

he thinks might influence United States policy, he confers beforchand

with

and the Ancricans in Munici, and sometires arguments ensue,

but ne feels, and I an cortain de lecls sincerely,

suare with Americans in a great effort to carry the truth back nane..

3. I say "terribly" important because Nowak, like othar exilos,

wonders out loud how long our work can continue to have an invact.

is rumself convinced tat every Polish soldier is a potential ally of

the irest but he wondors, and makes his listener wonder, how long we can

arcect this sympatiny anong a rising ioneration fur which the past is

inarorably fading.

debate mind

The following is from a disparin writlen dy Mr. William Tylor, dated

22 Juno 1953.

1. After a rocent coversation with Jean Paul David, at which time ho

outlined hio activities and ideas in connoction with the mission with which

ho lo charged by Geargos Bidault, I receivod a leftor from him.

2. It will be seon from this lotter that David is most anxioua that the

roport which he will tale an his survey should reprodent, without committing

any one country, a systhosia ol the viama and the rodourced of the Western

powora allied undor NATO, in the broad (ield al propaganda and paychological

warfare dosignod to build support lor Vastern delenso palicy and to promoto

she achlevomone of the objoctivas al these palicies.

3. It occurs so me that a difficulty maicù we have to face, and which we

are probably unique in baring to face; is due so the organisational afructure

within waich we aporase officially in the general field under diacuasion. In

a country like italy, lor examplo, it 1s possibla for David to havo oxchangos

of viers with high afficials of the government and to foel reasonably suro

that even though such riems are not to be taken au a commitmone, thoy do in fact

reproseni the disposition di the governmeat in question, or any goverament

likaly to succeed it, soward these probloms. In our caso, howaver, it seomo

to me that it will reguiro careful preparation to determine with whom David

should consult and to moris our a conatructive position which will influence

bis report and his recommendations in a direction which we approve.

4. It is particularly difficule for mo to make apacific recommondations,

since devolopmeata in Mashingion in the last lew months ara difficult to

keep up with from overseas. Il would, thorefore, la particularly helpful

to have headquartors' viowa at this stago on the fallowing points, assuming

that David. will go to trio Stalos in lato Sepsember du the last log of his survey:

a. With whoir should he most for basic diacuasions. (Il occura to

me that a suitable body, il af ill in axiatorce, movid so the Paychological

Operationa Coordinariag Committeo.)

b. Within whai limita al this timo are to preparad to discuss tha

problem of concerted action for the psychological strength of lão North

Allantle Community.

5. As beadquarters is aware, C. D. Jackson knows David personally,

and it would perhapa be uselul to arrange for conversations with him and

any group ho might have in mind.!. It is true that the position of David

is anaxalous, since làe survey on which he la

angagod,

is of the most alficial

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, International Organizationg

I had a talk with Spencer Phenix about NCFE. matters and

the following points were discussed.

(1) A Strategy Board to guide RFE. Spencer feels the need

for some higher lovel political guidance than RFE is getting fron

their staff people and talked about getting together a board of people

like George Kennan,

etc: I told Spencer that I thought it unlikely

that George would give very much time to this but might be willing

to give them an occasional idea or suggestion.

(3) Spencer seemed disturbed that the allocation of one

was not familiar with this particular issue.

• (4) He suggested that it would be well to have a meeting here

with some of the members of the Board and the Executive Comminee

and suggested a date around the first week in August.

I told him I

would do it il I had not already left the country by that time.

(5) Spencer is pleased

Sir!

Memurandum for the Kecord

Subject:

Converaation with Congreasman Kersten

1. On 6 May Congressmon Koralen addressed a letter to the

Stato Depariment, enclusing a lelter dared i May 1953, which he had

received from Mr. Creighton Scort, a lorier employee of indi, Free

Europe al Munich, Germany.

This leller was highly critical of cer.

tain personnel in REi, particularly as regarde allegations of pro-com-

munist attlludes: Un 6 July I discussed these criticisms with Eungress-

man Keraten in detail, conveying lo him orally the material contained

in the memorandum of 17 June 1953 from the Director of Security; Subject:

Inquiry by Cungressman Koraten; which the Director ol Security had noted

should be utilized in this meeting with Congressinan Hersten.

2. The Congresoman noted the difficulty in evaluating the sype of

criticisms which dr. Scott hod made but appeared willing so accept our

explanation.

3. Cungregsman

Karaten then lurned to certain cribeisins which

he had heard expressed regarding RFt from several sources, including

Scult.

One such criliciom is that RFE is nt doing the beat it sbould on

religious programs.

He feels that this aspect ui the broadcasis could

probably be considerably strengthened, particularly anung Catholic

elements.

4.

Mr. Kersien cited the opinion of Count Tarnowski (sp.?), a well

knivn Pole, who told the Congressman What any fourteen year old Suriet

cilizen would be so well brieled on Surict philosophy as lü lura up their

noses al lhe RFF: material.

The Count (and fersten appears to agree)

feels that le Sivier population has more sophisticaled philosophicai

material thrown at them by their own Government, and that it should be an.

important function of RFE: to cuunter with an attempt to destroy le Soviet

philosophical material and shake the soviet faich in their theoreticians.

5.

Congreaszan Keraten realized that it is difficule lo capture a

wide audience with philosophical arguinents, bus he fee!s thas if these

arguments reached a segment of impurtant leaderd behind the Iron Curtain,

it would help to destruy and counter the philosophica! teachings of Marx.

Lenia, et al. The Cungresamen feels chat many of vur broadcaste deal

•with econimie mallers, and, while these are important, RFS should go

desper and hit harder on religion and philusophy.

6. While Cungresoman Kersten is aware that many of the

capilve population are not interested in righteal movemento, it la

his opinion that RFE cannot beat communiam with socialiam. In

particular, he lelt (and Scolt bore this out in their conversation)

that we were making tur much use of Czech socialiata, and we were

using socialists from the Eence Government which had sought su

compromise with the communists.

while be recognizes the popur

larity of Benea and Masarve in Czechia, he feels they are not el-

lective in Slovakia, where there is a heavy Catholic pupulation.

7.

Congressman Yersten plans to go to Europe, probably

in September.

While he did noe say su, 1 belleve he would welcomo

an invitation lu vial RFE, Munich.

Furthermore, is the author of

the Kerster Amendnient and ul several resolutlons on the enslaved

peoples; al leadt one of which inay receive Cungressional approval

at this session, conalderation right be given as to whother it would
