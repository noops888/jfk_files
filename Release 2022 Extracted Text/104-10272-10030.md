defectors Nosenko, Golitzyn and Deriabin. Mi. Carlucci noted that from a

conversation he and the Director had with Nosenko regarding his establishing

himself in a new area, he would expect that such a session would be very

disruptive to him.

SA/DDCI Smith suggested that the Committee may be

interested in surfacing the "Monster Plot." Mr. Carlucci responded that if

this were the case, this effort should be headed off and he would be

willing to discuss

the same with Congressman Stokes.

McMahon noted that former DDO employee Goodpasture testified before

the House Select Committee on Assassinations on 12 April and she felt

browbeaten by the Committee.

NcMahon also expressed concern that the

Committee had duplicated classified documents.

White said that Committee

Counsel Blakey apologized for duplicating the documents and regretted that

Ms. Goodpasture felt browbeaten but said she was less than forthcoming as a

Lapham said that Deputy Assistant Attorney General Keuch was informed

enroll three people in the Federal witness

Protective Program administered

by the Department of Justice. SA/DDCI Smith said the three individuals

probably were Nosenko, Golitzyn, and Deriabin.

Lapham said this procedure

would be inconsistent with our handling of defectors.

Mr. Carlucci said that

a strategy has been developed regarding how to handle this problem with the

Committee, which

would include the stipulation that the Committee would

interview these individuals here at the Agency.

Smith noted that when

Deriabin appeared yesterday, he refused to testify unless he could be assured

that he could go through the resettlement process all over again. Miller

said this probably precipitated Blakey's idea about suggesting enrolling

these individuals in the Department of Justice progran.

McMahon said that employees are objecting, however, and he thought

they were justified in doing so. Laphan said that the Privacy Act was not

relevant in this matter.

Blake suggested that this seemed an unwarranted

invasion of individual privacy and an incursion by the Legislative Branch

into the Executive Branch. Blake explained what would be found in a

typical personnel file, and Waller added that many fitness reports contain

operational details.

Mr. Carlucci noted that the Department of state does

not allow Congressional investigators to review personnel files. Lapham

said that the Agency would not be on strong legal footing if it denied the

Committee access to the files.

After further discussion, Lapham said that

the Committee could subpoena the information but doing so would be extremely

ime consuming. The Director concluded by suggesting that Do negotiate

Taylor noted his understanding that employees at large do not understand

the Nosenko case.

Waller noted increasing confusion can be expected among

employees regarding the Epstein book, stories about a rivalry between

Angleton and former DCI Colby, and the pro- and anti-Nosenko forces. He

opined that putting the above in perspective might also be helpful. Mr.

Carlucci said that John Hart, who represented the Agency in testifyng

before the House Assassinations Committee on 15 September, tried to put the.

Nosenko case in perspective and his transcript is available for anyone who

is interested. HIs report on this matter is also available. Dirks and

Bowie noted that they were not familiar with the background of this case.

The Director then proceeded to highlight it, and EADCI Ratliff suggested

that a similar review might be helpful for employees.

The Director suggested

that consideration be given to this matter.

Mr. Carlucci then explained that Angleton had asked for

access to the files two days before he was to appear in executive session

before Congress and he was therefore granted access to prepare for his

testimony.

He did not come to review the files prior to his Congressional

Lapham outlined his meeting yesterday with former C/CI Angleton regard-

ing the latter's lawsuit.

Angleton is seeking access to classified documents

to rebut former employee

Hart's testimony before the House Assassinations

Committee.

Laphan suggested that the Agency may want to consider granting

Angleton access to these documents apart from his lawsuit. Doing so would

require at least obtaining an updated clearance for Angleton. In response

to the Director's question if Angleton had been seriously maligned by the

Hart testimony, Laphan said that it was difficult to say, but Angleton

certainly thinks so.

In response to McMahon's comment, Lapham agreed that

the Agency could make these documents available to the Committee, but the

Committee is running out of time, and Angleton would not want to comment on

them without seeing them personally.

In response to Laphan's question,

attendees noted that former employees were permitted to review classified

papers prior to testifying before the Church Committee. (AIUO)
