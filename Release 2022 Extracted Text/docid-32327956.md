On 7/11/62, MM 693-C furnished the following information
to SA HOMER R. HAVER, at Miami, Florida:

CI advised he knows GRANELLO as SOLLY BURNS. He stated
BURNS was recently involved in an automobile accident wherein he
was adjudged at fault in causing the accident. MM 693-C said
BURNS had contacted Attorney HARVEY ST, JEAN and requested ST.
JEAN to represent him in connection with this accident in regards
to BURNS giving a déposition in this matter. ST. JEAN reportedly
offered to provide the plaintiff with an affidavit admitting
liability on the part of BURNS; however, this was not satisfactory
with the plaintiff's attorney. CI said it was his understanding
that BURNS refused to appear for a deposition and in fact has
not yet been served to so appear.

CI was questioned concerning any knowledge he may have
concerning the subject's connection with the Marlborough House
Apartments. CI claimed to nave no direct information pertaining
to the subject's possible association with this apartment building;
however, he said it is rumor that GRANELLO was "promoting" this
deal. CI explained that he had heard that the subject was in a

. position to benefit from this operation if the business had been a

success, which it has not, but since it failed, he believes
GRANELLO did not lose any money on the deal. CI stated it is also
rumor that the subject is promoting a similar venture in the
Hollywood Wiltshire Apartment in Hollywood, Florida.

MM 693-C stated the subject would probably have profited
from the building of the Marlborough House during the actual
construction of the apartments, if he did make any money in
connection with this matter at all.

CL stated he is absolutely positive there would be no
written record of the subject's connection with either the Marl-
borough House or the Hollywood Wiltshire and that any connection
he might have with either of these buildings would be strictly
"off the record".
