Letter to the Attorney General from Director, FBI, dated

September 17, 1969, captioned "Investigation of Klan Organizations. "

Teletype to Director from New York, dated October 11,

1969, captioned "Counterintelligence Program Black Nationalist - Hate

Groups Racial Intelligence Black Panther Party (GPP). " It is noted the

original of this document indicates a copy was transmitted to the Inter-

divisional Intelligence Unit of the Department of Justice on or about

November 4, 1069.

3. Statements of former and current FBI officials.

On November 15, 1974, Mr. C. D. DeLoach, former

Assistant to the Director, FBI, was telephonically contacted by an FBI

official and asked if he had any recollection concerning the bricfing of

any Departmental official with regard to our Cointelpros. Mr. DeLoach

responded he had talked to former Attorney General Clark on several

occasions and discussed with him all phases of the operations of the

Intelligence Division of the FBI in which these programs were handled.

Vir. DeLoach stated he had brieted former Attorney General Clark not

only regarding the various Cointelpros but regarding even more sensi

tive matters.

Ir. DeLoach could not place any date of such brietings

but he recalled very specifically having so briefed the Attorney General.

Additionally, Mir. DeLoach stated it was his recollection

that former Attorney General Nicholas deB. Katzenbach knew about the

Cointelpro relating to the Eu Rlux Blan but that he, Mr. DeLoach, had

not personally briefed him regarding this matter. Mir. DeLoach said

former Attorney General Katzenbach was possibly briefed by former

Assistant to the Director Alan H. Belmont or former Assistant to the

Director Williar C. Sullivan, VI. DeLoach added he recalled very

clearly briefing former President Johnson regarding the Bureau's

activities against black militants in the United States. Nir. DeLoach

stated he was sure of the foregoing and would be glad to so testify.

On November 10, 1974, former Assistant to the Direc-

tor John P. Mohr stated he vividly recalled on several occasions the

Director had furnished in detail information to the Subcommittee of

- 3-

the House Appropriations Commitiec relating to instances and deizils

regarding the Cointelpros.

lar. WJohr stated he recalled the Committee

members were most impresced with the muterial and were commcada-

tory in their comments that the TBI was taking actions vith regard to

the organizations and groups discussed and that none of the Committce

inembore mado any critical comments relating to these opcrations.

lix. Nohr indicated he would be glad to testily to the above.

On Noveraber 18, 1974, Associate Dircctor Nicholas P.

Callahan, FBI, indicatca he, too, recalled thore were several instances,

cract dates not recalled, in which he accompanica former Director

Hoover when the latter testified before the Subcommittee of the floise

Appropriations Committee. Although fr. Callahan was not able to

eccall specific dates, he did recall af-the-record discussions with

members of the Committee and the questioning of the Director with

regard to the Bureau's efforts to neutralize groups and organizations.

Nir. Callahan stated there was no critical comment made in regard

thereto,

4. Hearings before the House Subcommittee on

Appropriations.

FBI records show that detailed information concerning

the fBI Cointelpros was prepared for off-the-record use by former

Director Hoover in connection with six apparances bctore the House

Cabcommittec on Appropriations between 1958 and 1900. Fabliched

reports of the hearings contained notations that off-thc-record dir

cussion did occur at the point at which the Cointelpro mterial appeared

in the Dircetor's material. We have located in our files the material

prepared for former Director Hoover for the above-described off-the-

record use, copies of which are attached.

exegutive sacretary

of the Seaboard White Citizens Council of Washington. As a

further aid to local law enforcement agencies, the FBI has scheduled a series

of special conferences for November and December, 1950, to discuss our

cooperative services regarding bombings and threats of bombings against

religious and educational institutions

Our entry into these cases at this new level is not to be interpreted

as an attempt on our part to usurp the jurisdiction of local authorities.

To give the

FBI this jurisdiction would relieve local governments of the basic responsibility

to maintain law and order, and the ultimate responsibility rightfully rests at the

local level.

To counteract a resurgence of Communist Party influence in the

United States; we have a seventh program designed to intensify any confusion

and dissatisfaction among its member's.

During the past few years, this program

has been most effective.

Selected informants were briefed and trained to

raise controversial issues within the Party. In the process, many were able

to advance themselves to higher positions. The Internal Revenue Service was

furnished the names and addresses of Party functionaries who had been active

in the underground apparatus. Based on this information, investigations were

instituted in 252 possible income tax evasion cases. Anticommunist liferature

and simulated Party documents were mailed anonymously to carefully chosen

members.

Two of our anticommunist pamphlets were sent to the Soviet thio?

by the Party as evidence of the problems it faces in this country.

These programs are part of our over-all counterintelligence,

operations. They are specific answers to specific problems which have ariser

within our investigative jurisdiction. You may have noticed, however, during

my comments regarding communism and espionage, the constantly recurring

- 36 -

## Page 11

theme.of passports. They present a problem in all of our counterintelligence work.

Fraudulent passports have, traditionally, been standard equipment for spies and

subversives. In November, 1957, a Soviet woman spy entered the United States

after adopting the identity of an American citizen who had returned behind the

Iron Curtain.

In the Abel case, both Abel and his principal accomplice,

Reino Hayhanen, also entered the country with fraudulent passports.

Soviet spies have been assuming the identities of Americans who died in

infancy. The names of these infants are easily obtained from public records, and

we are currently reviewing these sources to identify espionage agents who have

adopted this practice..

Recêntly, the Soviets have also displayed unusual interest

in securing such documents as high school and college diplomas, social security

cards, driverg licenses, and selective service registrations. With a dctitious,

identity supported by such documents, it is relatively simple to obtain a

United States passport.

Pursuant to W. O. Cregar to Mr. W. R. Wannall

memorandum 4/8/75 "Senstudy 75 (Request for temporary use of

Miss Frances M. Korb), " Miss Korb reported to the INTD 4/ 22/75

on temporary assignment in the CI-2 Section (actually working on

Senstudy 75 Project). Miss Korb, antemployee of WFO, reported

to the Legal Counsel Division 3/24/75 for temporary assignment in

the Freedom of Information Act Unit. This temporary assignment

ter*

was changed to INTD 4/22/75 and for continuance in her duties in

INTD with the Senstudy 75 Project, a position description to facilitate

her permanent transfer to the Project would normally be required

after 120 days from 3/24/75, or by 7/21/75.

Miss Korb is currently on extended annual leave from

6/13 - 7/11 -- total of 20 work days). In view of this extended period

of AL which actually covers a third of her Project assignment, it is

believed that her temporary assignment to the Project should be

extended for a similar period (20 work days) before the position

description need be prepared.

RE: REQUEST PERTAINING TO ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE

NOTE:

Original monograph outlining subversive connections

of King and other pertinent data was originally prepared and

disseminated at a high level in the Government 10/16/63. These

copies were subsequently retrieved because the Attorney General

felt they should be recalled. Subsequent revisions and updating

of the monograph were prepared and disseminated in 1964, 1967

and 1968.

Copies of Director Hoover's internal memoranda dated

11/7/63 and 2/5/64 being furnished the Attorney General and the

SSC have had data originally contained therein excised which is

not germane to the SSC's request. This information deals generally

with the Bobby Baker and Ellen Rometsch cases; a bombing in

Birmingham, Alabama; off-the-record discussions relative to King's

communist affiliations with the Rooney Committee; a letter on

King prepared for the Attorney General; leaks by the press of data

on FBI cases; and personal comments.

Memorandum 12/17/64, from I. J. Baumgardner to l. G.

Sullivan, captioned "Communist Infiltration of SCLO, IS-C"

has

been excised to conceal source of information for data concerning

and identity of Cordy I. Vivian, Southern Christian Leadership

Conference (SCLC) Director of Affiliates, a past member of the

Communist Farty, USA. This memorandum also excised to delete name

of Senator Richard Russell D-Georgia) who it was recommended be

advised concerning SCLO's utilization as a recruiter of blacks

to take part in the National Science Foundation program and the

identity of the University of Mississippi as one of the schools

for which recruits were to be sought.

Memorandum C. D. Brennan to W. C. Sullivan dated 8/24/67

captioned "Tartin Luther King, JI., Sil-C" showing dissemination of

monograph to ayrepresentative of a friendly foreign intelligence

service has been excised to delete the identity of its recipient,

& covert Australian intelligence officer assigned at the

Australian Embassy, Hashington, D, C., as well as the identity of

his Service and country. (S)

RE: REQUEST PERTAINING TO ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE

NOTE CONTINUED:

Memorandum 3/11/68 captioned "Martin Luther King, Jr.,

SM-C"' prepared by G. C. Moore for W. C. Sullivan was excised to

delete names of prominent black extremists Stokely Carmichael

and H. Rap Brown due to privacy considerations.

It Is also noted that review of appropriate files in

connection with this project failed to result in location of

memoranda dated 12/21/64 which secured authority to furnish

copies of the king monograph to Carl I. Rowan, then Director of the

United States Information Agency, and to then Vice President

Hubert H. Humphrey.

Letters of transmittal to these individuals

are among

enclosures attached.

Privacy considerations also involved in some of the

excisions in the 8/24/67 and 12/17/64 communications mentioned

above. No third agency consideration involved in documents

being furnished SSC.

. Also, excisions made in memoranda 11/22/64

and 11/27/64 from Sullivan

. to Belmont, because of privacy

considerations.

ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED

HEREIN IS UNCLASSIFIED

The enclosed article:

as above,

is the

one we have been preparing in line with approval of ou

recommendation to disseminate it on a select basis at a

very high level to show current communist activities in

Ielation to the Negro movement. It incorporates up-to-date

material just received from our New York Office relating

to the recent meeting of the Communist Party's National

Executive Committee.

Discussion of

racial matters was a

primary topic at the week-long meeting.

The enclosed article is a factual, documented

analysis of the over all current situation.

We believe

that it woulù be of interest not only to the attornay concia

but also to Mr. O'Donnell, at the White House; Mr. McCone,

the Central Intelligence Agency; Mr. Rusk, at the departmeni

of State; as well as to Mr. McNamara and the three Armed Forces

intelligence agencies of the Defense Department. Accordingly,

RECOMMENDATION:

That the enclosed article be approved. If approved;

• The attached analysis of

Gandy

Communism and the Negro Movement is

highly explosive. It can be regarded as

if a personal attack on Martin LutherKing. U

I There is no doubt it will have a heavy

¡impact on the Attorney General and anyone

else to whom we disseminate it. It is

labeled TOP SECREE.

However, even such a

high classification seems to

be no bar

today to a leak,

and should this leak out

it will add fuel to a matter which may

already be in the cards as a political

issue during the forthcoming Presidential

campaign.

The memorandum makes good

reading and

Il is based on information from reliable sources

We may well be charged, however, with

expressing opinions and conclusions, parti-

cularly with reference to some of the

statements about King.

This memorandum may startle the Attorney

General, particularly in view pi his past

association with King, and the fact that we

are disseminating this outside the Department.

He may resent this.

Nevertheless, the

memorandum is a powertut warning against

Communist influence in the

Negro

änd we will be carrying out our responsibility

by disseminating it to the people indicated

SUBJECT:

COMMUNISM AND THE

NEGRO MOVEMENT

The Attorney General telephoned at approximately 10:15 a.m.

He'advised that he had tried to call the Director who was temporarily out of

the building: The Attorney General stated he had just learned that the Arra.

had received a copy of a report submitted to the Attorney General about tre l

to thin unist activities of Martin Kuther King The Attorney General was reier s

to the report captioned "Communism and the Negro Movement -- A Currert

Analyses, " dated October 16, 1963. There is no question this is the report

to which he is referring, although he persisted on calling it the report on the

communist background of Martin Luther King.

The Attorney General said he would like to know whät other

dissemination was made of this report in addition to the Army and the purpose

for such dissemination. He was obviously irritated. He went on to ask if the

Army got copies of all reports submitted to him. I told the Attorney General trai

obviously the

Army did not get copies of all reports we sent to him perschally:

but that there were hundreds of reports that did go to the Army that did noz

concern matters of sufficient importance to warrant the Attorney General's persos=

attention. I pointed out to him that we regularly submitted some type of reports

in matters of current interest under our Internal Security jurisdiction, and that

dissemination of these summaries was made to the military authorities as well

as other top governmental officials because of responsibilities they have in this

connection.

The Attorney General asked what responsibilities the Army had in

relation to the communist background of Martin Luther King. I told the Attorney

¡General the report went beyond this and that the Army had an interest in commis

activities particularly in relation to racial matters because the military had to be

¡called on if civil disturbances arising out of such matters went beyond the oility

*of the civilian authorities.

R627100-3-16-483

This explanation seemed to serve no purpose.

The Attorney Gezer=

said he still could not understand why we sent a report to the Army on King's

communist activities. He reiterated his request for information as to the disse

tion of the report in question and the purpose for it. ce tic one

The Attorney General called and advised me there was

a lot of talk at the Pentagon regarding the document, Communism

and the Negro A"Current Analysis, dáted 10-16-63, which had

beon disseminated to the military and intelligence agencies by the

Bureau. The Attorney General anticipated that this information

would leak out as the military didn't like the Negroes.

The Attorney General felt we should get back all copies

of the document. I told him we had a tally of all copies and we

would get them from all agencies to which they were disseminatea.

The reason to be given for recalling wouid be revisions. I also

told him if any newspapers asked about this, no comment would be

made and no mention would be made that such a document existed.

4:40 p.m.

I advised the Attorney General that Liaison repre-

sentatives had been sent to get all copies of this document.

The Attorney General wants all copies disseminated to

Department officials recalled also. •

SIR. DE LOACH

Ino Attorney General called and stated no had haara that thare has

been some discussion about & report on martin lather king belore trol.oonay

Committse and also some discussion about the Department of Justica wanted

to recall that report and be, the Attornay Ceneral, wanted to recall our coge

versation about it because someone got the impression he, the Attorney General

requestad it be recalled. I told the Attorney General that tha only discussion

belore the looney Committee was oft the record, that there was inquiry ou

the cerord as to the association of Martin Luther King with the Communist

movemant and I reviewed the information that we had developed in the monogray

and said copies of the monogragh had been deliverad to the Secretary a Delenga

the Secretary o state, and the White House, and that it was later recalled

because it was feared it might leak out. I stated one of the members of the

Commitice, & Republican, mado the statement he thought it ought to be exposes

and Chairman Roonoy said he thought information of that kind should be

kept in the kack at the head rather than come out as public information. a

stated I made the remar's that that was the intention in recalling the document.

The Attorney General stated he understands that they are saying he had requests

it ba withdrawn. I stated it was nothing of the kind; that in other words he, l

the Attornoy Ceneral, and I had tulked about it several times and he had

questloned the wisdom of its distribution and 1 indicated I would have the

Pies

withdrawn and I did. The Attorney General stated he did not want to hat,

tas

idea that he had requested it. I stated both ci us had feared a leats migy

get

out from the Departments whigh had coried-of the monograph; and it 1t

happened during a sensitive time oi negotiations going on with the Negro

leaders, it would have caused a rucius insolar as fing was concorned.

The Attorney Cencral said another, thing he was calling about is that

my De Loach said to ud Guthman that the Attorney General shoald be concerned

abait the lotter written about fing and spealing on behali di the fel, d taey

were he, the attorney Caneral, they would be concerned.. The Altorney fenceal

stated he did not know what is going on with this thing, that he just knew the

letter was cloared mith the FBI bolore li was sent. I stated I did not know

what the letter is, that I would check on it because that is a new development

I had not board about. The Attorney General stated that just lust weekend he

heard that there was apparently some conspiracy on the part of Fresident

Kennedy and himsalt in connection with this; that he did not mind it coming out,

but he wanted the facts. I stated there was no discussion on the record at all,

it was all off the record and as l had stated, there was one member who thought

this iniormation about ting ought to be oxposed and Riconey spoke up that it is

bettor at thes to have matters o this kind in the back of the head rather than

have it leak out or ba disseminated, and i stated that was the intention of

recalling the doeument. The Attorney General stated he remembered the

conversation we had had. I stated in regard to this matter of some letter

that DeLoach mentioned, I did not know what that is about and I would talk to

Deloach about it and check on it.

10:00 ABI

I called the Attorney General and adrised him I spoke to Dalcach

sbout it and he emphatically denies he made any such statement to Guthman;

De Loach said Guthman came around to see him yesterday about the fact the

press is getting information regerding Wartin Lather King which concerned

hi:a. Deloach sajs his remari was it also concerned us because it lagerils

any sosrcos of information we might have. A continuca that there was a

reporter in Atlanta who, Ibelieve, arrived in Washington yestorday and who

18 doing an article for the Saturday Evaning Fost exposing king; that while

he was in Atlanta he mado the statment down there concorning O'Dell'a

connection with the Communist Farty and was concerned about davison

writing Bing's speeches and he was then coming on to washington to see the

D'spartrent people here to supplement this ol' get any additional information

he could. I stated that gives us great conceria because of the fact what

Levison does, that is a highly conitiential matter from one of our informants

who in associated with Levison. I stated there has been a leak somowhere

concerning that particular thing, but at so time was any ralerence made

concerning the fact that he, the Attorney Genaral, should be concarned about

any letter he wrote.

The Attorney General stated he is concerned abost that as he

the pagers which were not belora. lagreed and stated Drew Ecarson, I happen

to know, in regard lo his coluzin this morainy, got tho entire iníormatica

security rio, that fearson got access to the files of the Air Force and bas

attributed it to us - that when you read the thing, it coands as though everything

was iurnished by the f2l when in reality Pearson could not gat insida any door d

the Erreas as he is held in contempt by erarybody in the Bureau. I stated

Pearson hangs it on to the IDl as if it emarmied (rom us. I stated Pearson

did the same thing in regard to the assassination of the. President, that he

attribated certain inforcation to the DE! anlch, as a mattor of loct, he got

Irom Earl Warren himoali. I stated Faarson and Viarran are close Irlenda;

they travel together and spend vacations togather. I stated I had been tipped

off in aúvance that fearson was writing a colm critical of the Burezu and

giving intorration regarding the lee Harrey Gawald Case and Iparson Liaio.

It appear we were leaking luformation when as a matter of fact nothing ever.

was loaired out until aiter the report loit the Bureau and then things began

Inating out. I stated a lot lecked out in Dallas froa the Folice Departuest,

which was doing a lot of talking about the evidence they sent us like the

gun, the fingerprints, et cetora. I stated me identificd them and in turn ziade

& report to the Dallas Police Depart xent and the Chial then went on TV 221

radio and reported what we found. I stated I told the hgent in Charge to tell

the Chief I wanted his to shut ap; of course, the Chicl could bave ignored me,

but nevertacless i thought be was coler & grent ceal of hares, bat the Chiet

did shut up and be never appeared on TV or radio agala, but the barm iat

been done lecause certain members of the Fresidertial Conmission on tia

Assassination thought the material was leaked out by tho FBI. & stated

Pearson was the author of that kind of a colurn just as this morning lf you

read his colarin, the I 2I furnished everything aboat this fellow Reynolds mbo

is involved in the Dobby Daker case when, in jact, copies of our rezorts aí

Enclosed is a paper, captioned as above, which depicts the communist

influence in the Negro movement with emphasis on Martin Luther King, JI.

This paper is an up-to-date revision of the one by the same title prepared

under the date of October 16, 1963.

In updating it ve emphasized three

main areas: (1) the continued dependence of King upon former Communist

Party, USA members, current and former Party sympathizers and his continued

reliance on the long-time communist Stanley David Levison; (2) facts

relating to the moral degeneracy of King; and (3) the recent and current

Party aims and activities relative to the racial movement.

RECOMMENDATION:

Upon approval, consideration will be given to appropriate dissemina-

tion.* When approved, the paper should be returned to the Domestic

Intelligence Division for printing and the preparation of appropriate

letters if disseminated.

ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED

HEREINIS UNCLASSIFIED

BY S

DATE 10

This memorandum recommends that the National Science

Foundation (NSF) be furnished information concerning the

communist influence exerted on the Southern Christian Leadership

Conference (SCIC) and its President, Di. Martin Luther King, J*:

This appears necessary since the SCIC has been contacted by the

NSF for the purpose of obtaining applicants for southern schools:

AT 1382-S* has furnished information that Cordy T.

Vivian, SCIC Director of Alriliates,.

was advised that the NSF

desired qualified applicants to enter the University of Mississippi

and other schools

in southern states where the NST has its

program in progress.

Vivian was advised that the NSF was

contacting organizations such as the SCIC and other civil rights

groups to handle the

recriment program fur logio students siaca

did not want it to appear that the NSI was attempting to

put Negro applicants

in southern schools.

Vivian was advised that each qualified applicant

Fould receive a $3,000 scholarship from the NST. Since this

is a Government project any expenses incurred in this matter

"would not come out of anyone's pocket."

This vould indicate

that any expenses incurred by the SCIC in their recruitment

efiort would be paid for with Government funds.

The communist influences exerted on King are well

known. to the Bureau.

Vivian has in the past been a member

of the Communist Party.

OBSERVATIONS:

It is incredible that an outfit such as the SCIC

should be utilized for the purpose of recruiting Negroes to

take part in the NSF program, particularly where funds of the

Memorandum to W. C. Sullivan

SOUTHERN CHRISTIAN LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE

100-438794

U. S. Government are involved. The Atlanta Office has

recommended that Senator Richard Russell (D. Georgia) be

advised concerning this matter. This appears inadvisable

since such action could conceivably cause repercussions which

would only aggravate the racial situation that exists in the

South.

It is felt that Di. Leland J: Haworth, Director,

NSF, should be furnished infornation regarding

communist

influences exerted on the SCIC and King.

In this regard

we recently disseminated to the White House and the

heads of the intelligence community copies of a "Top Secret"

summary

• entitled

"Communism and the Negro Hovement--A

•

Current Analysis" which contains infornation regarding the

SCIC and King.

This summary deals with King's conmunist

connections and his personal immoral activities, With the

receipt of this summary by Dr. Haworth, the SCIC would

undoubtedly be removed from the ist progran io obtain qualilied

Negro students for southern schools.

The information concerning the SCIC participation

in the NSF program is being separately disseminated to the

Department and interested intelligence agencies.

RECOMNENDAT TON:

There is attached for approval a letter to

Dr. Leland J. Haworth, Director, NST,

transmitting a copy

of the recently prepared summary entitled "Communism and

the Negro Movement-A Current Analysis."

You will recall that in December, 1964,

with

• the

Director's approval and after first checking with

the White

House, we disseminated to the Heads of the intelligence

community a paper captioned as above which depicted the

communist influence in the Negro movement. Emphasis was

Cigar

given in the paper to the communist influences on Martin Luther

King,Jx., as well as facts relating to his immoral nature.

As you are aware, LeRoy Collins, former Governor of

Florida, is Director, Community Relations Service (CRS),

Department of Conmerce, and in this position serves as

something

of a "mediator" in problems relating to the racial field..

He

has been a liey individual =clativo to tha sitution in Selma,

Alabama:

Information of interest to the CRS is regularly being

disseminated to that agency.

He just received reliable infoi-

mation concerning a conversation between Martin Luther King, JX.,

and

his wife, Coretta, during which Coretta made reference to

the

Selma situation and said that Collins was blinded by

prejudice.

We have disseminated the information concerning

the King conversation to CRS.

It is believed that, in view of Collins' important t

position relative to the racial

movement, he should have

benefit of the paper which we have already given to the

White House and the Heads of the intelligence community.

Our IEl=-

tions with Collins have been friendly;

he is a long-time adnirer c=

In November of 1964, interested officials of the

Government, including the Honorable Dean Rusk, Secretary of

State, were furnished copies of the monograph

entitled,

"Communism and the Negro Movement - A Current Analysis.""

position, should be made aware of communist infiltration into

King's group, and the influence being exerted on king.

1 - Mr. D. M. Wells

ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED

PURPOSE:

DATE 10/11.

To obtain authorization for high level dissemination

ot a document captioned as above which shows the degree oi

communist influence on martin Luther King.

Enclosed is a document captioned as above, which

depicts communist influence in the civil rights field,

emphasizing the key role of Martin Luther King, Jr. This

document is a current revision of the previous analysis

captioned "Communism and the Negro Movement - A Current Analysts,

prepared and disseminated in November. 1964. In undating it:

we have emphasized these areas:

continued rollance of king

upon tormer communist Party, Uus, menbers, particularly stanley :?

David Levison; (2) facts relating to King's moral degeneracy;-

movements and King

objective.

10 K

King's strong criticism and condemnation of the

Administration's policy on Vietnam in a speech he made at New York

on 4/4/6% shows how much he has been influenced by communist

advisors. His speech was a direct parallel of the communist

position on Vietnam.

It is felt that the President would be interested in

a summary on King which shows the degree of communist influence

on him.

The attached paper constitutes a complete picture and

Istrong indictment of King in that regard.

RECOMMENDATIONS : :

It is recommended that

(1) The attached letters, with enclosures, to the

White House and the Attorney General be forwarded to Assistant

to the Director DeLoach for transmittal to Mrs. Mildred Stegall

of King:

As you know, King's "Washington Spring Project" was

originally scheduled for early April, 1968. However, our

Washington Field Office has developed information that King's

group is experiencing difficulty in recruiting individuals

to participate in the demonstration and the date for the project

has now tentatively been set for April 27, 1968.

Because of the importance of doing a thorough job.on

this, we will conduct an exhaustive file review to bring together

the most complete and up-to-date information and to present it

achieved in our efforts directed against the communists under

this program, coupled with Increased activity by the purveyors

Through a variety of techniques, we have been able

communists rarely use their organizational titles in renting

private halls, auditoriums,: Dientc grounds; and the Ilke, for

their rallies, propaganda, and fund-raising functions which

they endeavor to project as civic or sociai in nature. Often

an anonymous, letter, or directed publicity is sufficient to

alert the management of such locations, and the communists must

necessarily expend time and expense in efforts to find a new

site for their meetings..

Communist Party leaders are hopeful that, by exploiting such current

pational and internationd issues as racial discrimination and peace, they can

bring about a resurgence of Party activity and influence.

For example,

(Benjatin Davis, chairman of the Party's New Fork District,

in a report made

in September of this year to top communist functionaries, stressed that the Party

should concentrate on the integration issue as symbolized by the Little Rock school

situation. Diligent efforts are made by the communists to infiltrate Negro groups,

particularly at the local level, so as to agitate and create confusion.

The public usually associates the FEI's internal security

investgations with Communist Party activities only.

Nothing could be

further from the truth.

organizations based on a creed of force and violence to determine whether

they are a threat to our internal security or whether they have violated

could be attributable to specific organizations. Rather, they were individual

acts of terror strictly within the jurisdiction of local authorities. When these

outrages occurred, we in tha FBI have made immediately available to local

authorities our laboratory and fingerprint facilities here in Washington.

As the bombings directed toward religious and educational facilities

however, there has beensome indication of a general

Recognizing the danger to the national welfare from a general

paitern of organized terrorism,

the FBI has moved to expand its assistance

to local law enforcement in the recent bombings at Clinton, Atlanta, and

Peoria, Illinois. We are now providing all-out investigative assistance in

these cases. We are closely checking the activities of individunls prominently,

As a

further aid to local law enforcement agencies, the FBI has scheduled a series

of special conferences for November and December, 1958, to discuss our

cooperative services regarding bombings and threats of bombings against

religious and educational institutions

Our entry into these cases at this new level is not to be interpreted

as an attempt on our part to usurp the jurisdiction of local authorities. To give the

FBI this jurisdiction would relieve local governments of the basic responsibility

to maintain law and order, and the ultimate responsibility rightfully rests at the

local level.

To counteract a resurgence of Communist Party influence in the

United States; we have a seventh program designed to intensify any confusion

and dissatisfaction among its member's.

During the past few years, this program

has been most effective.

Selected informants were briefed and trained to

raise controversial issues within the Party. In the process, many were able

to advance themselves to higher positions. The Internal Revenue Service was

furnished the names and addresses of Party functionaries who had been active

in the underground apparatus. Based on this information, investigations were

instituted in 262 possible income tax evasion cases. Anticommunist literature

and simulated Party documents were mailed anonymously to carefully chosen

members.

Two of our anticommunist pamphlets were sent to the Soviet Union

by the Party as evidence of the problems it faced in this coun

operations. They are specific answers to specific problems which have arisen

within our investigative jurisdiction. You may have noticed, however, during

my comments regarding communism and espionage, the constantly recurring

theme of passports. They present a problem in all of our counterintelligence work.

Fraudulent passports have, traditionally, been standard equipment for spies and

subversives.

In November, 1957, a Soviet woman spy entered the United States

after adopting the identity of an American citizen who had returned behind the

Iron Curtain.

In the Abel case, both Abel and his principal accomplice,

Reino Hayhanen, also entered the country with fraudulent passports.

Soviet spies have been assuming the identities of Americans who died in

infancy. The names of these infants are easily obtained from public records, and

we are currently reviewing these sources to identify espionage agents who have

(45)

adopted this practice.

Recently, the Soviets have also displayed unusual interest

in securing such documents as high school and college diplomas, social security

cards, drivers' licenses, and selective service registrations. With a fictitious

identity supported hy such documents, it is relatively simple to obtain a

United States passport.

THE TIREAT

The Conmunist Party, USA (CPUSA) presents a greater

menace to the internal security of our Nation today than it

ever has since it was first founded in this country in 1919.

The dangerousness.of the CPUSA cannot be evaluated except in

the light of its relationship to the international communist

conspiracy and its ties to the soviet Union. In this regard

it is woll to note that the rate of progress achieved by the

international communist offensive is unparalleled in history.

In the past 43 years, it has advanced steadily and surely,

never varying its eventual goal of dominating the world,

until today its empire extends fron Last Germany to China.

This empire is so vast and sprawling that when night settles

on its wostern frontier, dawn already is breaking on its

eastern frontier.

This international connunist conspiracy

controls one fourth of the land area and approximately one

third of the inhabitants of the earth.

spiracy.

The CPUSA is a vital link in this world-wide son-

li utilizes elaborate security measures to conceal

its operations while vigorously promoting front groups as well

as other concealed outlets in furtherance of its clandestine

pursults.

It is completely dominated by and is subservient

to the Connunist Party (CP) of the Soviet Union. This fact

has been made abundantly clear on a number of occasions, sone

of which are:

Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, CPUSA national. Vice-Chairman,

who attended the moscow Conference of Conmunist and Workers

CRUSA National Executive Committee in New York City on

are considered of great importance among other communist

In light of the above, it can be readily seen that

the seriousness of the domestic

threat from a Soviet-dominated

CP in the United States is in direct ratio to the world threat

posed by its masters in the Soviet Union;

FBI RESPONSIBILITIES

Our responsibilities in the internal security field

are twofold:

(1) to collect intelligence infomation and

disseminate it to appropriate Goverrment agencies and (2) to

obtain logally admissible evidence for prosecution under

existing Federal statutes.

By Presidential Directive dated September 6, 1939,

the rBi was designated as the civilian intelligence agency

primarily responsible for protecting the Nation's internal

security.

Since that date, it has been the FBI's duty to

investigate subversion within the United States and to

correlate all information relating to imerica's internal

security and disseminate those data to interested Federai

agencies. Federal laws within the FBI's jurisdiction aimed

Security Act of 1950 and the Coumunist Control Act of 1954.

FBI COUNTERATTACK

The FBI's counterattack against the CPUSA 18 many -

pronged.

Some of our more effective prograns are: penetration

of the Party at all levels with security informants; use of

various techniques to keep the Party off balance and disillusion

individual conmunists concerning communist ideology; investigation

of every known member of the CrusA in ander to determing whether

he should be detained in the event. of a national emergency; and

gathering evidence to be used in prosecutions of communists and

conmunist organizations,

Much of this money has been passea to CPUSA representatives in

New York City by a Soviet representative to the United Nations.

This is not the only source of income for the CrUSA

fron abroad.

The Party has obtained a sizeable sun in cash

Irom the ked chinese,

unbeknown to the Soviet Union, to imple-

mont the money supplied by the soviets.

Like any other conspir-

atorial. organization, the CPUSA attempts to secure funds fron

other communist parties throughout the world and at the same

timo attempts to lèave the impression that funds are not being

received from the communist parties of other countries.

The CPUSA not, only receives financial assistance fron

other conmunist parties, but it, in turn, furnishes financial

assistance when the situation demands it to needy communist.

world. Today, the CrUSA is fur

As an adjunct to our reguiar investigative operations

we carry on a carefully planned program of counterattack against

the CPUSA which keeps it off balance. Our primary purpose in

this program is to bring about disillusioment on the part of

individual members which is carried on fron both inside and out

In cortain instances we bave been successful in preventir

communists from seizing control of legitimate maas organizations

and have discredited others who were secretly oporating inside

such organizations. For example, during 1959 we were able to

prevent the CPUSA from seizing control of the 20,000-merber

branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored

People in Chicago, Illinois.

We are kesping abreast of the activity of the CPUSA,

which is attempting through its programs to infiltrate American

institutions and groups and to increase its influence on the

American scene, by intensive investigation into every facet of

its activity.

Over the years we have investigated thousands of

Individual members of the CRUSA in order to determine whether

they night constitute a potential danger to the internal security

of the country in time of a national emergency.

The results of

these investigations are furnished various departments and

agencics of the ixecutive Branch of the Government when infor-

mation is developed during the course of the investigations of

interest to them. The dissemination of this information enables

these departments and agencies of the Governent to take what-

ever action is necessary from a policy standpoint as it relates

to the security of their operations..

Prosecution has been a major weapon against the CPUSA.

The Department of Justice first instituted prosecution against

leaders of the CPUS. in New York City in 1948. Since that tine

prosecution has been instituted against numerous individual co-

munist functionaries, against the CPUSA as an organization,

against comunist front organizations and against labor unions

controlled and dominated by connunist elements.

The primary

evidence in all of these

prosecutions was furnished by our

security informants.

se have made available approximately 100

security informants

for testimony in these cases.

The Supreme Court of the United States is presently

considering communist cases under the Internal Security Act of

1950 and the Smith Act of 1940.

As was expected, CPUSA fune-

tionaries have indicated the Party will go underground if a

decision is rendered against them by the Supreme Court. Should

this occur, we Wild?

of course, through our informants, atteapt

to go underground with them and thus keep advised of their

Dear Mr. Watson:

As you know, this Bureau has solved a number of cases

involving racial violence in the South. In this regard, public

attention particularly was focused on the FBI's role in the

solution of the brutal murders of Mrs. Viola Liuzzo, Lieutenant

Colonel Lenuel A. Penn, and the three civil rights workers in

Mississippi.

However, we have achieved a number of other tangible

accomplishments, most

of which are not publicly known, and I

thought the President might be interested in them.

At the present time, for example, nearly two thousand

Of our Informants and, sources

are being operated to obtain

up-to-date intelligence data concerning racial matters which we

disseminate on a continuing basis. Of these, 774 have been

developed in just the past year-man avernge of more than two each

day for every day in the past twelve months.

Particularly significant has been the high-level

penetration we have achieved of Klan organizations. At the

present time, there are 14 Klan groups in existence. We have

penetrated every one of them through informants and currently

are operating informants in top-level positions of leadership in

seven of them.

Through such coverage, much valuable information

relating to a variety of cases of violence and planned violence

in the civil rights fiold has been obtained.

Just recently,

for example,

an informant secured and furnished to us the

weapon used in a civil rights shooting incident in North Carolina.

KU KLUX KLAN INVESTIGATIONS

FBI ACCOMPLISHMENTS

BACKGROUND

Historically, the problem of the Ru Klux Klan in

the United States has existed since the days of Reconstruction

following the Civil War.

The Invisible Empire 1s well known

for its terrorist, nightriding activities and has been respon-

sible since its inception for mumerous racial atrocities

throughout the country. The Klan reached Its peal during the

defunct during

1920s wen it lorid lar Itors of members and it bécama almost

In 1954, with the historic

Supreme Court decision regarding desegregation of public

schools, it became revitalized. In 1964, with the passage of

civil rights legislaiir by the Cougress, the Man récruited

thousands of persons who feared the-rise of the Negro and

the threat to the "Southern way of life."

в.:.

The Klan has usually been located in the South al-

though there have been attempts to organize it in the North

Migrest, and far West. The Klan attracts individuals in the

rural areas who are poorly educated with limited incomes.

The Klan exploits the fears, hatred, and ignorance of people

no feel they are threatened by

the Negro, the Jew, the

Catholic, and the immigrant.

PRESENT STATUS

Presently there are 14 Klan organizations under

investigation with a membership of approximately 14,000. The

largest of these groups, the United Klans of America, Inc.,

Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, with Headquarters in Tuscaloosa,

Alabama, has an estimated membership of about 10,000.

Ku Klux Klan Investigations

Since 1964 Klan membership has declined in

Mississippi, Alabama, and Louisiana and increased in North

and South Carolina and Virginia. The North Carolina Klan

has the largest membership of any state in the Union under

the leadership

of Grand Dragon 1 R. Nones.

The most secretive and vicious Klan organization

n recent years has been the white Knights of the Ku Klu

Jan of Mississippi under the leadership of Samuelsh

Bonersh INs of Laurel, Mississippi, who was recently con-

Victed in connection with the murder of three civil rights

horkers in Neshoba County, Mississippi, In June, 1964..

FBI RESPONSIBILITY

This Bureau has a three-fold purpose in investigating

the Ku Klux Klan and individuals associated with Klan organi-

zations.

First, we investigate violations of Federal law

committed by the klan with the view toward prosecution in

Federal court.

Second, we conduct intelligence investigations

with the view toward infiltrating the Ku Klux Klan with infor:

mants, neutralizing it as a terrorist organization, and deterring

violence. Third, 'we provide the Department with the results

of our investigations for possible designation of Klan organi-

zations under Executive Order 10450•

MAJOR CASES

Murder of Three Civil Rights Workers

In June, 1964, three civil rights workers were

murdered in Neshoba County, Mississippi,

setting off an inten-

sive FBI investigation. In October, 1967, 7 of 18

defendants:

were convicted in Federal court in Meridian, Mississippi, for

violation of the victims' civil rights. An .8th defendant

pleaded guilty and a mistrial was declared as to three other

defendants.. Our investigations revealed that there was a broa

Ki Klux Klan plot behind the abduction and murder of the victims.

Ku Klux Klan Investigations

Klan informants were used as witnesses in this trial and

they unfolded a story of Klan violence and terrorism rarely

presented in any court.

Murder of Vernon Dahmer

In January, 1966, Vernon F. Dahmer, a leader of

the National Association:for the Advancement of Colored

People in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, died as a result of

wounds received when his home was burned and shot into by

the Ku Klux Klan. Twelve klansmen have been indicted by

the Federal Grand Jury and the case is presently pending in

United States District Court at Hattiesburg. FBI informants

were instrumental in determining in the early stages of the

investigation that (Samuel t Bowers and the members of the

White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan of Mississippi were

responsible for Dahmer's death.

Murder of Lemuel Penn

In July, 1964, Lemuel Penn, an Army Reserve

Lieutenant Colonel and Negro educator from Washington, D. C.,

was killed by shotgun blasts near Colbert, Georgia.

An exhaus-

tive investigation by this Bureau resulted in the arrest of

four members of the Ku Klux Klan.

Informants also played a

major role in this case. In October, 1964, a Federal Grand

Jury returned an indictment charging six men, including the

four arrested for Penn's murder, with conspiracy to injure,

oppress, and threaten to intimidate Negro citizens in the free

exercise of their Constitutional rights.

Two of the defendants

were convicted and four were acquitted.

Murder of Viola Liuzzo

dramatically emphasized our penetration of the Klan when it

was publically disclosed that Rowe was an FBI informant. The

three defendants were indicted by a Federal Grand Jury and

convicted in Federal court for conspiracy.

McComb, Mississippi, Bombings

From June through September, 1964, a series of

bombings occurred in McComb, Mississippi. After intensive

FBI investigation; nine members of the Ku Klux Klan were

arrested and charged with bombing homes and churches at McComb.

These nine klansmen entered pleas of guilty and nolo contendere

in local court: FBI informants were instrumental in uncovering

the plot and identifying suspects.

Now Bern, North Carolina, Bombings

In early 1965, a strategically placed informant

enabled us to identify klansmen responsible" for the bombing

of two automobiles and a Negro mortuary in New Bern;

North Carolina. This information was turned over to local

authorities. Three defendants were convicted in State court.

important part of our program and our coverage is aimed at

both high-level and low-level, penetration.

For example,

recently the United Klans of America held its National

Konvocation in luscaloose, Alabama, to elect members of the

Imperial Board.IFour of the ten newly-elected members of

this Beard"

are FBI informants." In addition, we have high-

level Informant coverage at the Imperial Headquarter of the

United Klans of America at Tuscaloose, Alabama.

Perhaps one of the most difficult of our assign-

ments is the penetration of Klan "action squads." An action

squad is a small group of klansmen, vithin a klavern or acting

independently, whose purpose is to commit acts of terrorist

and among che

We have penetrated a number of these groups

Through our informant operations, the United Klans

control the expansion of the Klan. More Importantly, we

were able to discourage violence throughout the state. The

Klan in Tennessee has not expanded to the proportions it has

in other states and its lack of success can be attributed to

our highly placed informant.

Louisiana

In March of 1966, high-level informants in the

Louisiana Klan were responsible for the defeat of notoriousl

militant incumbent Klan leaders. Subsequently, kobert sher con,

Fe immediately began an all-out effort to penetrate the

Virginia Klan, contain its growth, and deter violence. Working

closely with local and state authorities we were able to

disseminate information on contemplated cross burnings.

Several arrests were made based on FBI Information furnished

to local police and in one situation, a klansman was sentenced

to three years in local court for burning crosses, a felony

under Virginia law. While conducting official investigations,

two Agents of this Bureau were assaulted by klansmen who were

later convicted on charges of Assault of a Federal Officer and

Obstruction of Justice in Federal Court in Richmond, Virginia.

In December, 1966, the Special Agent In Charge of

and the FBI In Klan matters. We provided the Governor with

information regarding Klan activities in his state. As a

result, Governor Godwin pressed for more effective enforcement

of Virginia cross burning laws, and publically repudiated the

Ku Klux. Klan. Shortly after thé Governor's public repudiation,

the Klan attempted to retaliate and we learned of plans to

burn crosses in the City of Richmond in defiance of the

Governor.

Tie furnished this data to local authorities who

arrested five klansnen, thus seriously dampening Klan enthu-

siasm for such projects.

the State of Virginia.

authorities of the plot against her ilfe and alerted our in-

To this date, the Klan

has taken no action against Nah, Grogan,. This is just one of

many examples of our notifying auchorities and intended

victims of racial violence in order that they, could take

appropriate protective measures.

LIAISON WITH LOCAI. AUTHORITIES

When ve receive intelligence information concerning

violations of local laws such as cross burnings, bombings;

or shootings, we notify local authorities. For example, in

April of 1966, the Louisiana Klan planned to birn crosses

throughout the state. He furnished this data to local author-

ities and arrests were effected thus deterring further acts

of. harassment, intimidation, and violence.

This is another

example of incidents wich are handled in our day-to-day con-

; tacts with local police.

KLAN INFILTRATION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT

• We are constantly alert for information concerning

klansmen who become members of local and state police

agencies and Kian attempts to infiltrate law enforcement.

Law enforcement agencies have always been a prime

the ku tux Klan, In 1964, Ne furniahed Iniomation Bet of

Governor Paul Johnson of Mississippi concerning klansmen who

were members of the Mississippi Highway Patrol. These men

were subsequently fired. Since that time relations have

greatly improved rendering more effective the fair exercise

of local law enforcement responsibilities in Mississippi.

It has been part of our established policy to notify

the head of the law enforcement agency involved of any mem-

ber of his organization who has been sworn into the Ku Klux

Klan. In addition, the Governor of the state is notified.

ACQUISITION OF VIAPONS AND DYNAMTTE OF THE KU KLUX KLAN

As part of our investigation so Man groupe,

determine the extent to which they are acquiring and stock-

piling weapons, ammunition, and dynamite.

During our inves-

tigations we always endeavor to determine the fumbers and

types of weapons.and the amount of dynamite possessed by

klansmen...

In 1964, for example, (James Rubledge of Mertalan,

(MississippD, was arrested by FBI Agents and local authorttles

"for possession of dynamite wich, according to our Klan

sources, he intended to use for bombing purposes.

If it is determined that illegal #eapons such as

being held by klansmen, appropriate investigations under the

National and/or Federal Firearms Act are instituted.

Ku Klux Klan Irvestigations

INTERVIENS OF KLANSMEN

One of the greatest attractions for klansmen 1s

the alleged cloak of secrecy which surrounds their Klan

membership.

Te have found that a program of seledtive inter-

views of klansmen, where they are made aware of our knowledge

of their Klan affiliation, has done much to cause disillusion-

ment of the members and disruption of the organization." In

some instances klansmen volunteer information about the

organization and its activities. These interviews also put

us in a position to assess eachumember with regard to his

potential as an informant. Although our Agents in conducting

their interviews are freguently.met with hostility and threats

by militant klansnen, our Klan Interview program has been most

effective in deterring violence and developipg informants.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

On December 7, 1967, an Informant of our Mobile

Division learned of Klan plans to burn crosses in Montgomery,

Alabama. This information was disseminated to appropriate

local authorities in an effort to effect arrests during the

cormission of thesé illegal acts.

Only within the last week an informant of our

Jackson Office obtained Information concerning possession

Through the launching of

the FBI's anticommu-

informants in 12 strategically located field offices have .

been carefully brieled to engage in controversial discus-

alons with the Communist party so as to promote dissensiona

factionalism and defections from the communist cause. This

technique has been extremely successful from a disruptive

standpoint.

Under another phase of this program, we have

carefully selected 28 Items of anticommunist propaganda

and have anonymously mailed it to selected communists,

carefully concealing the identity of the FBI as Its source.

More than 2,800 copies of Iterature have been

placed in the hands of active communists.

Two pamphlets

which were prepared and anonymously disseminated by the

FBI have been sent to the Soviet Union by Party represent-

¿Director's specifia instructions dated 8-26-59.)

The FBI's Counterintelligence Program is directed

against the internal machinery of the Cormunist Farty.

Background: This program was devised to pro-

mote dissension, factionalism and defections within the

communist cause. We have bombarded Party members on a

highly selective basis with anticonmunist propazanda at-

tacking such issues as anti-Semitism in the Soviet Union,

the Stalin crimes, the Soviet suppression of the Hungar-

lan Revolution and other "weak spots" which could be ad-

equately exploited for our purpose.

Recent developments nave disclosed that Com-

munist Party leaders are considerably concerned over this

anonymous dissemination of literature to sources within

Its ranlis, Indicating clearly that this tactic has been

extrenely successful from a disruptive standpoint.

One of

the best indications of its value and

effectiveness comes directly from the mouth of the enemy.

Counterintelligence Program

Since August, 1956, we have augmented our regular

Investigative operations against the Communist Party-USA

with a "countorintelligence program" which involves. the ap-

plication of disruptive techniques and psychological war-

fare directed at discrediting and disrupting the operations

of the Party, and causing disillusionment and defections

within the communist ranks. The tangible results we are

obtaining through these covert and extremely. sensitive

operations speak for themselves.

During the past year we have causer disruption

at large Party meetings, rallies and press conferences

through various techniques such as causing the last-minute

cancellation of the rentäl of the hall, packing the audi-

ence with anticommunists, arranging adverse publicity in

the press and making available embarrassing questions for

triendly reporters to ask the Communist Party functionaries.

When Lurer arrived at the (

Counterintellitence Program

A highly specialized and aggressive program of counter-

Intelligénce was initlated in 1956 for the purpose of exposing,

disrupting, discrediting, and otherwise

neutralizing the Communis

Party-USA, and related organizations. Accumulated successes

achieved in our efforts directed against the communists under

this program, coupled with increased activity by the purveyors

of racial hate, warranted the expansion of the program in the

Fall' of 1964 to include Klan- and hate-type organizations and

their memberships. Counterintelligence action today 1s a valu-

able adjunct to investigative responsibilities and the techniques

used complement our investigations. All information related to

the targeted organizations, their leadership and members, which

1s developed from a variety of sources, is carefully reviewed

for its potential for use under this program.

Examples of recent disrupting and neutralizing results

achieved by this program are the following:

The principal vehicle In which the Communist Party-USA

1s endeavoring to influence and recruit youth is the W. E. B.

DuBois Clubs of America, which was spawned by the Party in

:San Francisco, California, In June, 1964. The DuBois Clubs

projects Itself as a "broad-based Socialist organization," while

Its dedicated communist leadership deviously operates behind the

scenes in an effort to manipulate and influence the political

•climate on the Nation's campuses.

Utilizing public information, we have prepared the

text and eye-catching format of a four-page leaflet entitled

"Target.'. American Youth!" which thoroughly documents the

.

communist origin, objectives, and control of this youth organ-

Ization. This leaflet has been sponsored by the (Catholic War

Veterans and is in the process of being disseminated through-

out the Nation with emphasis placed on its circulation in

areas where the communists have made inroads among students.

EXHIBIT No. €3 - Leaflet: "Target...

Through a variety of techniques, we have been able.

to alert the owners of private meeting locations to the use

of their premises by the Communist Party and its fronts. The

communists rarely use their organizational titles in renting

private halls, auditoriums, picnic grounds, and the like, for

their rallies, propaganda, and fund-raising functions which

they endeavor to project as civic or social in nature. Often

an anonymous letter or directed publicity is sufficient to

alert the management of such locations, and the communists must

necessarily expend time and expense in efforts to find a new

site for their meetings.

Although still in Its formative stages, our program

• directed against hate organizations is beginning to achieve

similar success. For example:

DATE: Cctober 25, 1963

FROM

C. A. EVANS

SUBJECT:

COMMUNISM AND THE

NEGRO MOVEMENT

ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED.

MEREIN IS UNCLASSIFIED

DATE D/I2/0U

As spasse

The Attorney General telephoned at approximately a. a.m.

He advised that he had tried to call the Director who was temporarily out oi

the building. The Attorney General stated he had just learned that the Army

had received a copy of a report submitted to the Attorney General about the

communist activities of Nartin Luther King. The Attorney Genera was reich ring

to the report captioned "Communism and the Negro Movement -- A Current

Analyses, " dated October 16, 1963. There is no question this is the report:

to which he is referring:

although he persisted on calling it the report on the

¡communist background of Martin Luther King.

' ''

The Attorney General said he would like to know what other

dissemination was made of this report in addition to the Army and the purpose

for such dissemination. He was obviously irritated. He went on to ask if the

Army got copies of all reports submitted to him. I told the Attorney General that

obviously the Army did not get copies of all reports we sent to him personally,

but that there were hundreds of reports that did go to the Army that did not

concern matters of suificient importance to warrant the Attorney General's personal

attention. I pointed out to him that we regularly submitted some type of reports

in matters of current interest under our Internal Security jurisdiction, and that

dissemination of these summaries was made to the military authorities as well

as other top governmental officials because of responsibilities they have in this

connection.

The Attorney General asked what responsibilities the Army had in

relation to the communist background of Martin Luther King. I told the Attorney

General the report went beyond this and that the Army had an interest in communist

(activities particularly in relation to racial matters because the military had to be

callcd on if civil disturbances arising out of such matters went beyond the ability

•of the civilian authorities.

This explanation seemed to serve no purpose. The Attorney General

said he still could not understand why we sent a report to the Army on King's

communist activities. He reiterated his request for information as to the dissemina

tion of the report in question and the purpose for it.

INTERNAL, SECURITY - COMMUNIST

This memorandum recommends that the National Science

Foundation (NST) be furnished information concerning the

communist influence exerted on the Southern Christian Leadership

Conference (SCIC) and its President, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr:

This appears necessary since the SCIC has been contacted by the

"SE for the purpose of obtaining applicants for southern schools:

has furnished information that

was advised that the NSE

desired qualified applicants to enter the University of

and other schools in southern states where the NSF has its

program in progress.

was

advised that the NSF was

contacting organizations such as the SCIC and other civil rights

groups te handle the

encrustment, program for Negro studenis since

they did not want it

to appear that the NSI was attemping to

put Negro applicants

in southern schools.

was advised that each qualified applicant

fould receive a $3,000 scholarship fron the NST. Since this

is a Government project any expenses incurred in this matter

"would not come out of anyone's pocket."

This would indicate

that any expenses incurred by the SCIC in their recruitment

effort would be paid for with Government funds.

The communist influences exerted on King are well

known. to the Bureau,

of the Communist Party.

From F. J. Baumgardner

RE: COMMUNIST INFILTRATION OF

SOUTHERN CHRISTIAN IEADERSHIP CONFERENCE

U, S. Government are involved. The Atlanta Office has

recommended that

be

advised concerning this matter, This appears inadvisable

since such action could conceivably cause repercussions which

would only aggravate the racial situation that exists in the

South.

It is felt that Dr. Leland J: Haworth, Director,

Ist, should be furnished intormation regarding

communist

influences exerted

on the SCIC and King. In this regard

we recently disseminated to the White House and the

heads of the intelligence community copies of a "Top Secret"

summary entitled "Communism and the Negro Hovement-A

Current Analysis" which contains information

regarding the

SCIC and King®

This summary deals with King's communist

connections and his personal immoral activities, With the

receint of this summary by Dr. Haworth, the SCIC would

undoubtedly be removed gram the wor

program to obtain qualified

Negro students for southern schools.

The information concerning the SCIc participation

in the NSF program is being sepazately disseminated to the

Department and interested intelligence agencies..

RECOMMENDATION:

There is attached for approval a letter to

transmitting a

BACKGROUND:

On my recent inspection of the Legal Attache office

our conversation, it was quite apparent that Ambassador

Johnson was unaware of the communist influence being exerted

on Martin Luther King, Jr., and his group the Southern

Christian Leadership Conference.

In November of 1964, interested officials of the

Government, including the Honorable Dean Rusk, Secretary of

State, were furnished copies of the monograph

entitled,

"Communism and the Negro Movement '- A Current Analysis."

It is felt that Ambassador Johnson, because of his

position, should be made aware of communist infiltration into

King's group, and the influence being exerted on King.

Ambassador Johnson is a former Deputy Secretary of

inState and has been extremely cooperative and helpful in the

past....

Upon receipt of the memorandum and the attached inventory,

Mr. Adams agreed and I called Mr. Wilderotter's Office at the White

House at 5:10 p.m., 6/20. His secretary assured me he would return

my call. Mr. Wilderotter called me at 10:15 a.m., on 6/23. I explained

to him that Mr. Farrington had completed compiling an inventory of the

items Wilderotter furnished Farrington and that among the items on the

inventory I observed several which related to the official and confidential

files that had been maintained in Director Hoover's personal office suite.

I told Mr. Wilderotter that it was my understanding that the Deputy

Attorney General was interested in discussing the official and confidential

Illes with the attorney General prior to discussing the matter with

representatives of the Senate Select Committee. I told him that I thought

it would be necessary for me to advise the Deputy Attorney General that

material relevant to that matter may be available in the materials

inventoried by Mr. Farrington for Mr. Wilderotter. Ilisted and described

for Mr. Wilderotter Items 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 24, 36 and 40 on the

inventory as probably being relevant to the material of official and

confidentiat files: Mr. Wilderotter recognized the items from their

description and agreed that the materials should be made known to the

Deputy Attorney General. He said that I should dispose of the materials

Memo to Mr. Adams

Re: Inventory of Documents Received From

Former Associate Deputy Attorney General

in any way I felt was appropriate. He said that he would like to have

an indication from the Bureau as to the materials we had received

from him and some sort of a receipt for the materials. He said he

did not want to be accused later of having removed classified material

from the Department of Justice. In that regard I told Wilderotter that

we probably could furnish him a copy of the inventory and a receipt

indicating that the items described therein were received from him.

I understand Mr. Wilderotter's concern about possible

allegations that he removed material from the Department and I believe

it would be appropriate for us to prepare some statement indicating the

extent of the materials he did furnish to Mr. Farrington. If we furnish

Wilderotter a copy of the inventory, he will have information classified

top secret and sufficient identifying data as to particular documents to

indicate the identities of individuals which could, it inadvertently

disclosed, result in invasions of personal privacy.

Therefore, I suggest

that we may comply with Mr. Wilderotter's request by attaching a copy

of the inventory to a letter addressed to the Attorney General stating that

the materials described were received from Mr. Wilderotter. We could

furnish Mr. Wilderotter a copy of that letter and allow him to review

I but not retain a copy of the inventory.

RECOMMENDATION:

282-2

1. That the Deputy Attorney General be advised of the existence

of the materials concerning the materials contained in the official and

confidential files described in the inventory.

-

Done 305 1/8/15.

2. That Mr. Farrington prepare a letter addressed to the

Attorney General, copy to the Deputy, describing the circumstances

under which Wilderotter furnished the material and enclosing a copy-of- -

the inventory.

MEMORANDUM

Appearance before

senate Select Committee on Intelligence on

June 4, 1975

ALL INFORVATION CONTAINED

HEREINIS UNCLASSIFIED

DATE 425,00

I was questioned by Mr. Mark Gittenstein and Miss Mary D'Oreo,

members of this Committee, on June 4, 1975, from 2:30 P.M. to

4:40 P. M. on June 4, 1975.

He started the questioning by asking about the different positions held

by Mr. Tolson in the FBI. He was advised when he came to the Seat of

Government he held the positions of Chief Clerk in the Administrative Division,

Inspector, Assistant Director, Assistant to the Director and Associate

Director.

He asked how many people were in Mr. Tolson's Office at the

time of Mr. Hoover's death. I advised him that Mr. Mark Felt, Mr. William B.

Soyars, Mrs. Mutter, Miss Smith and Miss Tschudy (in the reception room,

and myself In a room next to Mr. Tolson's Office.

He requested me to draw

a diagram of the suite of offices showing the entrances thereto, which I did.

He asked me about the file cabinets in these offices and whether there were

any cabinets in Mr. Felt's Office. He asked me whether I took any dictation

from Mr. Felt and I told him Mr. Felt dictated to his secretary, Miss Tschudy.

He then asked me what Expedite Processing meant. I told him this

meant that the more important matters were processed and recorded by the

Files Division than the lesser important mail. In other words, this meant by

processing the more important mail first, this category of mail would have

action taken on it before the lesser important mail was acted on.

He then asked me about the abstracts, and who prepared them. I told

him abstracts were prepared on all correspondence; that when I first went to

the FBI the stenographers would prepare them but that was changed and the

individuals dictating the correspondence would dictate the abstracts. He

commented that he thought the abstracts were a very good system.

Mr. Gittenstein asked me if Mr. Tolson would ever get any letters

marked "personal and Confidential" from any of the Agents or Agents in Charge"

and I told him occasionally he did. He wanted to know what happened to them

and I told him as far as I knew they went to the Files Section. He also asked

if Mr. Hoover ever received any and I told him that any he routed around

for Mr.. Tolson to see were sent back to Mr. Hoover by Mr. Tolson and I

could not say what happened to them after they were sent back.

He asked me if anyppapers were sent to Mr. Tolson by Mr. Hoover

Mr. Gittenstein questioned me at great length about the Executives

Conferences, how often they were held, who attended them, and who dictated

the Executive Conference memoranda. I told him they were generally held

about once a week, but sometimes only when there were special matters

to be discussed. I told him they were attended by the Assistants to the

Director and the Assistant Directors or by their alternates and that they

were held in Mr. Tolson's office. I told him the individual who had matters

to be discussed dictated the memorandum, which covered all matters

discussed at the conference. He asked whether Mr. Hoover attended these

conferences and I told him he did not. He asked where these Memoranda

were kept and I told him they were kept in the Files Division. There was

considerable discussion about these memoranda. Mr. Gittensteintold me

this was necessary as there was considerable confusion as to these memoranda

and confidential matters.

Mr. Gittenstein asked me if I made a log of Mr. Tolson's appointments

like the Director's Telephone Room Did. I told him I did not, as Mr. Tolson

did not make any appointments; that Mr. Tolson was extremely busy all the

time and when he had any matters to discuss with anyone, he would either

call them on the intercom system or have me call them to come to his office

to see him.

He asked me about the cabinets in the Director's office and if I knew

what they contained. I told him I did not. He asked me about the index cards

in Miss Gandy's office. I told him I would occasionally ask about personal

friends of Mr. Hoover and Mr. Tolson and whether they were written on a

first name basis.

He asked when Mr. Hoover was out of town did Mr. Tolson take over

his duties. I told him they were generally away at the same time. He asked

me If Mr. Felt took over Mr. Tolson's office at those times and I said he did.

He asked me if Miss Gandy and I were friends and I told him we were

official friends but I did not have any outside contacts with her. He asked me

if Miss Gandy discussed any confidential matters with me and I said she did not.

Mr. Gittenstein asked me it I saw any boxes at all brought into

Mr. Felt's office after Mr. Tolson died. I told him 1 did not as 1 was

extremely busywriting letters-and closing out Mr. Tolson's office and did

not pay any attention to anything else. He wanted to know if Mr. Felt occupied

Mr. Tolson's office and I told him he did not until after I retired on June 12, 1972.

NW 68262 Docld:32989612 Page 265

Mr. Gittenstein asked me how many rooms there were in Mr. Hoover's

house and I gave him this information. He asked me if there were any cabinets

in the first and second floors of the house and I told him there were not. He

then asked me about the cabinets in the Recreation Room and what they

contained. I told him there were cabinets containing 8 drawers and that

these cabinets were used for and contained Mr. Tolson's personal papers

and nothing official. I told him there were two cabinets containing Mr. Hoover's

personal investments that I had occasion to use these files in connection with

his investments and his estate and, in answer to questions from Mr. Gittenstein

and Miss D'Oreo, I told them I did not see any official papers in these cabinets.

Mr. Gittenstein said he understood there were a great number of

boxes in the Recreation Room and he asked me if I knew what they contained

and what happened to them. I asked him if I could get some guidance from

Mr. Mohr on this matter, as Mr. Mohr accompanied me to the meéting.

Mr. Mohr told me he was there when the appraisers came to appraise the

contents of Mr. Hoover's house in connection with the settlement of his

estate; that he was with the appraisers the entire time they were opening

the boxes, that he saw what each box contained, and that the boxes and their

contents were sent to Sloans for auction sale.

There was considerable discussion as to what Miss Gandy did while

I was there. I again told them I did not go to Mr. Hoover's house until

after I retired and I thought my first day there was June 14, 1972. I told

them I had a month's accumulation of work and was extremely busy; that

I worked at a desk with my back toward Miss Gandy; that I knew she was

working on some papers on the table where she was sitting but I did not

know what they consisted of and I did not ask her as I did not consider it

any of my business. My function was strictly to take care of Mr. Tolson's

personal matters. Miss D'Oreo did considerable discussion about this

matter. She asked me if Miss Gandy was destroying any papers. I said

she was putting some papers on her table into a cardboard box. She asked

me where the papers came from and I said I did not know as Miss Gandy

was there before I arrived and she had her work on the table at that time.

She wanted to know whether the papers were in manila folders and whether

the folders were marked as to their contents. I told her I thought there was

some typing on the tab of the folders but I did not know or read any of the

typing.

She asked me if from my knowledge of regular Bureau files whether

any of her papers consisted of official 'Bureau files. I told her I saw no

official files whatsoever. She asked me if I ever saw Miss Gandy go into the

two file cabinets containing Mr. Hoover's personal papers. As I could

see these files from my desk I told her I could definitely say I never saw her

go into these files. I again stressed the fact that I had never been to Mr. Hoover's

house until June 14, 1972 and I only went there once a week and that I only

saw Miss Gandy about three or four times after I first went there. Miss D'Oreo

again asked me if there were any official papers in the cabinets containing

Mr. Hoover's personal investments and I told her that in my references to

NW 682heSe false 858ia pot see any oficial papers.

## Page 267

Mr. Gittenstein asked if I discussed the closing of Mr. Tolson's

office after his death with Mr. Mohr and I told him I did not as I took

care of this matter myself. He asked me what the cabinets in Mr. Tolson's

office contained and whether he kept any official papers or any manifolds

in his office. I told him Mr. Tolson had no cabinets in his office and that

he kept no official papers or manifolds there. I told him the cabinets

were in my office. He asked me what the cabinets in my office contained

and I told him. I advised him they contained tickler copies of letters

which I had written but which I destroyed ascopies of the same were in

the FBI files and the rest of the material consisted of copies of his income

tax returns, his stock investments and his oil investments, all of which

I packaged and sent to Mr. Tolson at Mr. Hoover's house. He asked me

if I took them or who did take them and I told him it was someone from

the Supply Section. He asked me when these boxes of Mr. Tolson's

personal matters were sent to Mr. Hoover's house and I told him just

before June 12, 1975, when I retired.

He asked me whether there was a garage on the premises and

I told him there was. He asked whether there were any file cabinets

in the garage. I told him I had never been in the garage and assumed

there were only implements stored there.

Miss D'Oreo asked whether there were any cabinets in the

attic. I told her I had not been in the attick; that I only went up a

few steps to the attick to ask James E. Crawford, one of Mr. Tolson's

employees, a question but did not go all the way up to the attic.

HOTE CONTINUED:

this paper is an incernal deliberative document and recommended

it be withheld from the Committee. In the face of an adverse

ruling by the AG, te recommended by letter to the AG and IHM

dated June 4, 1975, that access to the paper for reviev at

FBIHQ be allowed with the stipulation that no notes would be

taken during the initial review. We stated at that time that

should the arrangement be unsatisfactory to the Committee, we

would consider further request for the document. Committee

Staff Member Mark Gitenstein has completed the initial review

under the conditions which ve imposed. The Committee Staff

has renewed their request that the paper be made available

to them and their request has been sustained by Mr. K. William

O'Connor of the Department. Under these circumstances, it Is

no longer practical to continue our objections.

MEMORANDUM TO ALL BUREAU OFFICIALS AND SUPERVISORS

(A) COMMUNICATIONS TO FIELD OFFICES -- Communications of any

type sending instructions to field offices should be short, clear and sim-

ple. Use telegraphtype language. Reference prior communications to

avoid needless repetition of previous instructions.

(B) UTILIZATION OF LIAISON SECTION -- A reduction in the number of

Supervisors handling liaison with other Government agencies makes it

necessary that the time of the remainder be utilized most efficiently to

permit the productive handling of contacts with those agencies. It is de-

sired that Supervisors refrain from designating mail for delivery by

Liaison unless a reason exists for such designation. Mail should and

will be delivered by Liaison if it requires discussion with or delivery to

a high-ranking official of another agency, if its sensitivity requires

suecial handling, ui if its contont requiros some explanation or comment

In the absence of some such reason, mail should be designated for deliv-

ery by the Courier Service or by regular mail.

Dissemination of Bureau reports and memoranda to other Govern-

ment agencies is the responsibility of the substantive Supervisor, and not

of the Liaison Section.

Transmittal form 0-14 should be used whether

such dissemination is being made by Liaison, by Courier Service, or by

regular mail. Transmittal forms in the 0-14 series, sometimes referred

to as form routing slips, contain blocks to be checked which will inform

the addressee that no further investigation is contemplated, that the other

agency will be advised of pertinent developments, that the status of the

case is complete or incomplete, and that the item or items are being fur-

nished for the information of the addressee. The last notation is some-

times checked without any indication as to the status of the case or whether

further material may be expected, resulting in later inquiry from the ad-

dressee. It is desired that when this form is utilized, it be fully executed.

If a Liaison Supervisor is being asked to pass information orally

to another agency, he should promptly be furnished an appropriate letter-

head memorandum or other communication which will confirm his oral

dissemination. Do not send serials to Liaison with a routing slip asking

"please handle" or "please pass information to --."

Affirmative contacts are being discontinued with twenty-four

agencies with which we have relatively few interests in common. Liai-

son Supervisors will, however, continue to handle urgent matters re-

quiring personal liaison with those agencies. Supervisors should con-

tinue to designate for the Liaison Section tickler copies of memoranda

discussing matters involving other Government agencies, and consider-

ation should be given to discussion of such matters with the Liaison

representative prior to preparation of memoranda in order that full facts

concerning our relations with the other agency may be ascertained.

Matters involving our relations with other agencies should be coordin-

ated, Wherever possible, with the Liaison Supervisor at the outset. .

Very truly yours,

John Edgar Hoover

HI HECT:

DISCONTINUANCE OF LIAISON FUNCTIONS

MDR-16

Pursuant to the Director's instructions, I have carefully looked into dis -

continuance of liaison functions and resultant release of Agent Supervisory personnel

for reassignment. I have reviewed the Director's instructions (pertinent memoranda

attached) and have conferred with various Bureau officials. .

The Director instructed liaison be restricted to White House, Vice President

and National Security Council. Domestic Intelligence Division (DID) listed 65 agencies

* being eliminated from liaison contact but also respectfully suggested continued liaison

with State, Air Force, Army, Navy, Secret Service, Internal Revenue and Civil

Service. DID feels that some disadvantage or possible criticism could result from

discontinuance of liaison with these key agencies.

At this point possible criticism or problems are anticipatory. Obviously

we will be alert to such possibilities, and if problems arise, we will meet them and

take such steps as are necessary to solve them We can always modify nur

procedures when it is in the Bureau's interests to do so. Furthermore, there appear

to be no question but that almost all business and necessary dissemination can be

handled by teletypes, letters, dissemination memoranda, or by telephone with con-

firmation in writing if necessary. Emergency or unusually delicate situations can

be handled by direct contact.

1

For above reasons, we should immediate as continue liaison service

with all agencies except White House, Vice President, and National Security Council.

'Our teletype network to key agencies and our regular courier service will provide

expedite transmission. An emergency, such as a threat against the President, can

be handled by phone with confirmation by letter. DID can prepare necessary in -

structions and guidelines to implement our new procedures. Nine Agent Supervisors;-

including a Section Chief, will be made available for other assignments.

Mr. Sullivan' also proposed one of Agents released from liaison be

designated permanent night supervisor on midnight to 8:00 Add siltzalin which

is presently filled on rotation basis. Sullivan points out additional correspondence

anticipated because of reduction in liaison, making it more arricult for various units

to spare men for midnight shift on rotation basis. There may be an increase but it

is impossible now, to determine exact extent. DID should defer this request for 90

ays to determine extent of increased work load and submit aditionassems tification

to your request and is not for dissemi

at that time nation outside your Committee.

Re: Discontinuance of Liaison Functions:

"..

...

Vir. Sullivan pointed out in his memorandum (attached) that there are

5 vacancies in DID (none at Section Chief or # Man Level -- SA R. L. shackelford •

was promoted to Chief of Internal Security Section from'Unit Chief level).

• Vacancies

are as follows: (1) Three in New Left Groups Unit, one caused by the promotion of

SA Shackelford- replacement requested but not yet approved - and two based on

request for additional personnel to handle sharply increased work load involving

violence oriented groups. Two from Inspection Staff have been ordered under

transfer in.

Transfers being held in abeyance. (2) One vacancy in Racial, Intelligence

Section based on request for additional supervisor to handle increased work load re

black militant groups -- approved and Agent under transfer in from Los Angeles.

(3) One vacancy in Subversive Individuals Unit caused by transfer of SA S. S.

Czarnecki to the Inspection Staff. Replacement approved but transfer in not yet.

ordered.

In addition, there are 4 immediate vacancies in other Divisionsat Seat of

Government: two in Special Investigative Division and one in Crime Records

Division (Inspection Division memoranda recommending replacements attached).

In addition, there is Section Chief vacancy in Administrative Division.

PlasTIsT: +44+7+4 +45545508755

OBSERVATIONS:

Remaining tunctions Will De laison with While mouse, vice President and

* National Security Council plus supervision of Legal Attache Offices and related

I matters. These duties are now being handled by three Agent Supervisors. This is

I not enough to justify continuance of Section; however, a new unit could be established

for administrative control consisting of Unit Chief and three Agent Supervisors.

• Unit

Chief would administer unit and also be responsible for irregular contacts with key

agencies to maintain effective relations and to resolve and avert incipient problems.

These matters have been discussed with Mr. Sullivan. While he does not

agree with extent of proposed cutbacks, feeling we should maintain liaison with

certain key agencies as set out in his previous proposals, he advises DID will

vigorously strive to effectively implement the new procedures.

Il these proposals are approved, a total of nine Agent supervisors will be

removed from liaison, thus reducing approved DID Agent complement from 124 to 115.

Nine Agents being released from liaison assignment can be assigned as follows:" 5 "

for existing vacancies in DID; 2 transferred to existing vacancies in Special

Investigative Division; SA Bernard C. Rachner has been transferred to field; and

Section Chief Brennan to Administrative Division at no change in grade or salary.

to replace Section Chief C. Q. Smith, who is retiring effective 7/31/70 (this has

been coordinated with Mr. Mohr and Mr. Callahan).

Pursuant to the Director's instructions, we are !

discontinuing liaison contacts with all agencies except the

White House,

the Office of the Vice President, and the

National Security Council. As a large volume of our work

with other agencies has been handled by the Liaison Super-

visors, we are recommending that those agencies be told that

our increased work and limited manpower require the use of

OuX

Liaison Agents in other areas and it will

be necessary

for them to utilize other means for the transaction of their

business with

the Bureau.

We propose to advise the agencies that any requests

for information from Bureau files be referred to the Name Check

Section by telephone or mail and that requests dealing with

matters of Bureau policy be addressed to the Director in

writing.

Telophonic inquirios in situations where time viti

'!

not permit a written request and which involve Bureau policy

or current operations will be referred to the Office of the .

interested Assistant Director.

Address cards have been prepared and circulated to

all Bureau officials and stenographers covering those agencies

to whom any volume of Bureau mail has been addressed in the

past.

It is not considered that address cards will be neces-

sary for the small agencies with whom we have had infrequent

contact as a proper mailing address can be secured either by

telephone or from the Government Organization Manual.

We are carefully watching developments in the dis-

continuance of direct liaison and will make prompt recommen-

ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED

HEREINUS LYGLASSIFIED

You requested my observations and recommendations with regard

to the re-establishment of the Liaison Section,

The Liaison Section was broken up in July, 1970, and since that time

necessary and desirable liaison with other Federal agencies has been handled

by written communication as well as by direct contact with persons at various

levels at the Bureau with their counterparts in the other Federal agencies.

When the Liaison Section was discontinued it had grown too large and represented

a waste of manpower. 10 Agents, not including a Section Chief, were engaged

in handling domestic liaison with some 8i different agencies, many of which

obviously were of minor importance to our operations. Since that time necessary

liaison has not been handled as much by Washington Field Ofice as you indicated as

by supervisors and officials in FBIHQ. Washington Field Office's liaison with

other agencies relates almost entirely to the handling of leads and the Bureau's

routine business with those agencies.

I believe we could more efficiently and effectively handle our business

With the other major Federal agencies if we re-established a Liaison Unit of limited

size to handle only those agencies with which we have the greatest amount of traffic.

¿ I propose we have a five-man Unit under the Chief of the existing Special Coordination

Unit (L. F. Schwartz);

SA Robert H. Haynes is currently in that Unit handling liaison with the

White House, the Vice President, and the National Security, Coungil! To his

assignments we should add Secret service:

SA John E. Manning currently assists the Unit Chief in handling telephone

inquiries. He could be assigned to handle laison with the following:

Memo for Mr. Kinley

Re: Liaison Section

SA B. C. Rachner currently in this Unit could handle liaison with:

Department of State

Immigration and Naturalization Service

Treasury Department and related agencies with exception of

Secret Service

A 4th Agent could handle Central Intelligence Agency and related committees:

• U. S. Intelligence Board

Signal Intelligence Committee

Security Committee

Watch Committee

Technical Surveillances Countermeasures

Interagency Defector Committee

A 5th Agent could handle:

National Security Agency

Atomic Energy Commission

U. S. Postal Service

Department of Transportation

Under the above proposed arrangement we would have five Agents handling

the major agencies with which we regularly need to resolve problems and handle

the greater volume of our business elating to other agencies, This Unit could be

eftectively supervised by its present Chief (Schwartz) and would function under

A. J. Decker, Jr., Chief and G. A. Day, Number One Man of the Nationalities

Intelligence Section. Both Decker and Day are highly competent for this kind of

supervisin and administration, it being noted that Day is our top expert on liaison

matters, having served as Number One Man in the old Liaison Section. Two other

supervisors in the Unit (R. A. Bermingham and H, C. Flemister, Jr.) would

continue to handle foreign liaison, to

which they are presently assigned, including

the supervision of Legat operations.

A third Agent would need to be added for

supervisions foreign liaison to replace Rachner; who is now engaged in these

duties.

RECOMMENDATION:

That the Special Coordination Unit be renamed Liaison Unit and organized

FROM

ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED

SUBJECT: LIAISON SECTION

This memorandum is in response tolir, Gray's

comments concerning your memorandum to Mr. Kinley 6/30/72.

Mr. Gray asked for a review of current and past liaison

procedures.

The supervision of our foreign liaison representatives

was not affected by the conversion in 7/70 of the Liaison

Section to the Special Coordination Unit. That responsibility

continues to be handled in the Special Coordination Unit in

the same manner as it was handled in the former Liaison Section.

This memorandum, therefore, is addressed to the question of

the Bureau's domestic liaison operations.

Former Liaison Section

The objective of the Liaison Section was, through

the development of high-level contacts in appropriate U.S.

agencies, to insure that the Bureau's business with those

agencies

was accomplished promptly,

eftectively, economically,

and with a minimum of jurisdictional or policy problems.

By the establishment of effective liaison contacts, we sought

to recognize and solve minor problems before they became

major problems requiring protracted and/expensive regotiatvons

between the Bureau and other agencies.

=

Procedures under Liaison Section

The objectives cited above were achieved oy placing

seasoned Bureau representatives öf broad experience in contact

the highest levels of other agencies where

the Bureau either

with officials ay needed help or had concurrent interests.

In the former Liaison seetion, ten gents maintained, liaison

with approximately 81

U.s. agencies including major intelli

gence agencies,

the military, other major departments,, bureaus

and commissions and

many lesser agencies.

Re: LIAISON SECTION

their operations and established a close personal rapport with

high-level officials in those agencies.

For example, in matters

of major importance the liaison Agent could make immediate

personal contact with Cabinet officers, directors of bureaus and

many other officials of the highest level.

When our investiga-

tions required interviews of persons of this caliber, the inter-

views would be handled by the liaison Agents in order that the

interviews could be accomplished without delay and with a

minimum of inconvenience to the official involved..

Many of these

high-level contacts were the result of years of development by

the Bureau liaison representatives and through them we were able

to obtain assistance which might otherwise have been difficult

or impossible to obtain. Some examples of this type of support

are the following:

...

National Security Agency-One of the Bureau's

secure telephone systems was provided and

installed by this Agency at no cost to the

a savings of approximately $150,000,

Through'high-levol contacts in this Agency,

we have also been able to secure the results

of its technical research which might have

been difficult or expensive to obtain through

other sources.

Post Office-Our close association with the

Chief Postal Inspector and his top officials

has resulted in that agency providing support

in sore ot our most delicate intelligence

operations looking to the identification of

illegal hostile intelligence activities in

this

country.

State Department-In addition to providing

at no cost to the Bureau another secure

telephone network. and making available to the

Bureau worldwide cable facilities of the State

Department, our high level contacts in this

Department have.on many occasions assisted in

the speedy resolution of complicated investigative"

problems both in the criminal and security fields.

An excellent example would be the support provided

by the Passport Office of the State Department in

identifying James Earl Ray as the assassin of

Martin Luther King:

Memorandum E. S. Miller to Mr. Felt

Re: LIAISON SECTION

Military Agencies-The military intelligence

agencies have consistently provided excellent

support to the Bureau in both the security and.

criminal fields.

Much of this is due to the

high-level liaison contacts developed over the

years with these agencies. In the Yablonsky

murder case, the military

provided, on very

short notice at no cost to the bureau, an

expert diving team which was able to locate

one of the weapons involved which was

an

essential piece

of evidence in this crime.

Likewise,

the military has been able to provide

a wealth of deceptive information to be used

in our double agent operations directed against

• Soviet-bloc intelligence agencies.

Immigration and Naturalization Service-

Through high-level contacts with this service,

we have been able to arrange with a minimum of

complicated paper work the speedy deportation

of persons entering the United States who are

considered to be threats to the internal security,

such as Arab terrorists sent to the United States

on assassination missions.

In many other instances; through close established

liaison, we were able to avoid the development of situations

in other agencies which could have resulted in operational

problems for the Bureau.

Our liaison, for example, with the

President's Commission on the Causes

and Prevention of

Violence and the Commission on Civil Rights provided advance

information concerning possible publications or statements

by those commissions which could have reflected adversely

on the Bureau.

Under these procedures, the Bureau, liaison repre-s

sentative would be visiting the agencies assigned to him on

be able

a frequent basis so that officials of those agencies would w

discuss.potential policy problems

with him

'before making them'a matter of formal correspondence vith ot

the Bureau.

In many of these situations,

the Bureau liaison

representative, being fully conversant with Bureau poljcies.::

and procedures, would immediately resolve the question to

the satisfaction of both the Bureau and the official of the

other agency without the necessity of getting into expensive;

Re :

LIAISON SECTION

Special Coordination Unit

Objectives of the Special Coordination Unit, while

similar to those previously stated for the former Liaison

Section, are necessarily. less broad and are directed more

towards

facilitating the

resolution of problems raised by

other agencies than producing effective action by other

agencies on behalf of the FBI.

Procedures under Special Coordination Unit

Under the current setup, two Agents assigned to

the Special Coordination Unit are handling our domestic

Liaison york.

One of these is assigned to liaison with

The White House, the Vice President, and the National Security

Council. He is

backed up by the other Agent who also attends

meetings of various intelligence committees and assists the

Unit Chiet in handling inquiries from other agencies doing

business with the Bureau.

We have been able in our current system to carry

on an eifective liaison operation primarily because of the

quality and number of high-level contacts which had

been

developed under the previous Liaison Section system.

Although effective, this has really been a holding operation

largely dependent upon the existing reservoir of well

developèd contacts.

Due to transfers and retirements in

the most important agencies with which we do business, our

established contacts have been deteriorating so that we

are approaching

the point of diminishing returns.

This

• situation could be reversed if we had sufficient man power

to visit the more important agencies, renew old contacts and

establish new ones.

RE: LIAISON SECTION

Costs

In measuring the cost of a domestic liaison operation,

the only measurable cost is the total salary for personnel

involved. Liaison Agents are normally selected from among

Supervisors of GS-15 caliber ($25, 583-$33,260); that is, men

who have the ability and experience required to handle a

Unit Chief's job or a job of similar responsibility. Based

on current median salaries, there is set out below a comparison

of the annual salary cost of the former Liaison Section and

the current Special Coordination Unit. In considering these

figures, it should be recognized that the Section Chief and

One Man in the former Liaison Section, and the Unit

Chief in the present Special Coordination Unit devoted only

part of their time to domestic liaison, and also supervised

the coordination of our offices abroad

and the investigation

of the many "Foreign Police Cooperation" cases handled in

the United States in reciprocity for the work done for us

abroad.

The former Liaison Section also handled other

matters, now absorbed elsewhere, such as emergency planning

and the

Bureau's participation

in the NATO Special Committee.

such as savings in reduced paper work, savings in man hours

oi consultation, savings in the elimination of unnecessary

or duplicative investigative effort and, of overriding

importance, the increasing of our operational effectiveness

through the establishment of good will with other agencies.

These savings offset to a considerable degree the increased

salary expenditure.

Conclusion

Although we enjoy a strong operational relationship

with other agencies, including the intelligence agencies,

wherein in many instances we have face-to-face meetings at

the desk level with counterparts in other agencies, we

believe that from the overall standpoint the Bureau can

profit from the assignment of three additional Liaison Agents

to this work.

We are not recommending that we enter into

lizison functions as broadly as we were engaged in ihe past

as we believe such an expenditure would not be justified.

What we are recommending is the assignment of one half the

personnel which had previously been assigned to direct

liaison functions at less than one-half the previous cost.

ADDENDUM OF W. M. FELT 7-19-72

I recommend re-establishment of a Liaison Section on the

restricted basis outlined. above. The Liaison Section should maintain

smooth and continuing contact with top officials in the intelligence com-

munity and related departments. We would not change in any way very

effective liaison maintained by other divisions with Congress, Budget

Bureau, Civil Service Commission, Department of Transportation in

connection with hijackings and security matters, etc. This action would

eliminate any remnants of criticism concerning our liaison. We would

set up strict guidelines and carefully select our personnel to insure that

we would get the type of liaison outlined above. We would guard.against

it becoming a mail courier operation.

I recommend the re-establishment of the Liaison Section

and the adding of three additional agents to implement this.

Mr. Gray's approval of the re-establishment of a lfaison section

included an instruction that the section not supervise offices overseas and in

foreign countries. As this work is so basic to the responsibilities of a

liaison section, I am respectfully presenting several points for Mr. Gray's

consideration in the hope that he will reconsider this prohibition.

The supervision of the foreign offices is handled by three men

who review the correspondence with our Legats. resolve their numerous

problems, and handle their many contacts who visit Washington. The latter

also visit other United States agencies while here, requiring coordination which

can best be arranged by a domestic liaison supervisor familiar with the

agency in question. In addition, some of the foreign agencies with which

our Legats are deeply involved maintain representatives in Washington.

These include RCMP, (MI-5, MI-6, and the Australian Security Intelligence

Organization. These foreign representatives regularly visit the Bureau (S)

to discuss the various requirements which have been made of them by their

headquarters. The foreign liaison supervisors simply do not have the time

to handle these persons in'addition to their regular work, and this responsibility,.

which for many years was handled in the front office of the former liaison section,

is now temporarily being handled in the front office of the section to which the

foreign liaison supervisors are attached. The processing of the requests made

by these men and the discussion of their problems with them is a matter of

basic liaison and should logically be handled by whoever will be in charge

of the new liaison section. The courtesy and attention which is given ta

the requests made by these foreign liaison representatives in Washington

is reflected in the treatment which their headquarters affords the requests

made: by. our Legal Attaches:

RCMP has specified that all requests from U:S. agencies fer

Memorandum E. S. Miller to Mr. W. M. Felt

Re: LIAISON SECTION

with other agencies is handled by domestic liaison supervisors dealing with

those agencies. In similar fashion the British will not furnish derogatory (S)

information directly to the Department of Defense in connection with its

background-type investigations but require that such data be channeled

through FBI. These are just two of the instances in which a foreign liaison

- . matter becomes a domestic liaison matter and should be under the same

supervision.

Our foreign offices are necessarily closely involved in the

operations of several U. S. agencies and require domestic liaison with those

agencies. Our many problems surrounding the establishment and maintenance

of foreign offices have to be coordinated with the Department of State. It is

essential that we know and have access to the proper official at State in order

to solve problems faced by the Legats as without prodding State moves very

slowly. Our foreign offices work closely with the Central Intelligence

Agency(CIA) stations abroad. CIA Headquarters does not permit its overseas

Stations to disseminate information to other agencies overseas, including our

Legats, except in unusual circumstances. They frequently, however, suggest

to our Legats that CIA Headquarters be asked for particular items. These

can most rapidly be secured by direct request from a domestic liaison

supervisor.? In a number of areas, our Legal Attaches work closely with (S)

local representatives of the U.S. military. Leads are passed to our Legat

which are then followed up by liaison contacts in Washington with the appropriate

military headquarters.

Liaison, or, in other terms, the establishment of a harmonious

relationship, is basically the same whether practiced in Washington or Tokyo.

I feel that it would be to the Bureau's advantage to have our liaison operations

closely coordinated and directly supervised in the same area. This has proved

to be an efficient and productive arrangement in the past, and we believe that

the re-establishment of limited direct liaison in Washington should be handled

by the same supervision which has been given to our posts abroad. The work in

both areas is primarily intelligence oriented, yet does not fall within the

normal responsibilities of the present operational sections. It is considered

that we should not leave the foreign supervision in its present area; which is

fully occupied with Arab terrorism, Chinese espionage, and Cuban, Arab,

Chicano and Jewish extremists.. A logical and economical step would be to

make the present foreign liaison supervision an integral part of the new

SUBJECT LIAISON SECTION

Since I think my recommendations to you may possibly be

the source of the confusion that appears to have resulted from your

order approving the reestablishment of the Liaison Section, this

memorandum is written in an effort to dispel the confusion.

When the recommendation was made to you to reestablish a

Liaison Section, I recommended you reestablish the Section but the Section

as reestablished should not operate in the same way as the old Liaison

Section had operated, according to my understanding.

Specifically, i recuminended that the reconstitutod Section should

have responsibility only over liaison with other agencies and should not

operate out of the Domestic intelligence Division (DID). I suggested that

the proper location within the Bureau for the new Section might be an

appropriate topic for discussion at an ExecutivesConference meeting.

Supervision of foreign Legats, which supervision had been

included among the responsibilities of the old Liaison Section, would,

under my proposat, continue to be handled within the DID and thus would

not be handled by the reconstituted Liaison Section.

This recommendation was based on the assumption that the

foreign Legats have seen their responsibilities increased in recent years

to include the collection of political intelligence information for dissemination

to Dr. Kissinger and others. It they are going to do intelligence work, i

seemed appropriate for them to be supervised by the FBI's intelligence

division.

You ordered that the new Section not supervise offices overseas

and in foreign countries. If this order was in any way based upon my

recommendation to you, my recommerdation should not have been accepted

unless you were also prepared to order that the new section would not,

RE: LIAISON SECTION

Your order reestablishing the Section appears to contemplate

that the new Section will operate out of the DID. If this is your intention,

then there is no reason why, in my opinion, the section should not also be

permitted to supervise foreign Legats. The only reason for my recommen-

parallel recommendation that the new Section be located elsewhere than

the DID.

In accordance with Mr. Gray's approval, we have prepare

As he requested, each Agent assigned to domestic liaisón has had

previous liaison experience and, with one exception, each was

assigned to the former Liaison Section.

Each of these men is

currently assigned to this Division and no replacements are being

requested. Each of

the domestic liaison men has had at least

twenty years' experience in the FBI, has had wide field

evaluated

not only the supervisors in this Division but also those

elsewhere in the Bureau who have had experience in liaison opera-

tions and I have concluded that Day is the best qualified for this

position from the standpoint of experience and specialized back-

ground. Headquarters liaison is entirely different from field

operations and

requires a thorough knowledge both of the problems

and policies of the domestic and foreign fields and of the opera-

tions of the major agencies here in Washington with which we have

interests in common.* Day has had extensive liaison experience,

having served as Number One Man of the former Liaison Section and

having

handled top liaison assignments, prior thereto. He is cur-

rently

serving as Number One Man in the Nationalities Intelligence

Section, in which Section the present Special Coordination Unit

Schwartz was assigned to the previ-

ous Liaison

Section and has an unusually wide personal acquaintance

with both top and working level personnel in other U. S. agencies as

well as having represented the Bureau on several of the U.S. Intelli-

gence Board Committees.

Prior to dissolution of the Liaison Section,

he was given a special citation by the U. S. Air Iorce in appreciation

for the liaison which he was then maintaining with that service.

Schwartz has recently been handling the numerous telephone calls from

other areas of the Executive Branch and has thereby continued his

relationship with other agencies.

In addition to a highly successful

and productive career at Headquarters, Schwartz directly supervised

in the New York Office the then highly

important investigation of the

New York State Communist Party and its

membership prior to his assign-

continued in this assignment by the former Director after the Liaison

Section was dissolved.

Haynes also has a wide range of contacts in

many other agencies, both military and civilian.

He, too, has repre

BYS ALMA

SUBJECT: PERSONNEL CHANGES

You previously approved the establishment of a Liaison

Section and the purpose of this memorandum therefore is to submit

the names of candidates to fill the position of Chief of this Section.

On 10-11-72 available members of the Personnel Selection

Board met in my office, consisting of myself and Messrs. Walters, Miller,

Bishop, Callahan, Dalbey, Jenkins, Conrad, Baker and Bates. In view of

the pending transfers of SACs Kunkel and McDermott, I did not invite them

to attend the meeting; however, in the future I intend to utilize the services

of nearby SACs.

With the exception of Assistant Director Baker: all members

have recommended the following 3 employees and they are, in order of

preference, SA Graham A. Day, ASAC James J. Dunn, and SA Homer A.

Boynton. Mr. Baker recommended, in his order of preference, SA Boynton,

ASAC Dunn and SA Day.

1. SA Graham A. Day, No. 1 Man, Nationalities Intelligence Section, DID.

He entered on duty 1-4-43, is in Grade GS-15, age 60, married, 2 children.

He reported to DID ,11-11-54, served as No., 1 Man of the former Liaison

Section from 3/61 until 7/70 when the section was disbanded and since 5/10/72

has served in his current position. Mr. Day's age, length of service at FBIHQ

were carefully considered during the meeting; nevertheless, with the exception

of Mr. Baker, the others present, including me, feel that Day is without a

doubt the most qualified employee to fill this particular position. He has had

vast experience in liaison work and even in his current position has-continued

to directly supervise both domestic and foreign liaison functions. He has a

thorough knowledge of the problems and policies of the domestic and foreign

fields and of the operations of the major agencies here in Washington, He

is without doubt the Bureau's top expert on liaison matters and le has many

top-level contacts in Government. It was also pointed out that during the-

critical initial stages of re-establishing our liaison functions it is essential

that the man heading the section be exceptionally strong in. this field and Day

certainly fulfills this requirement.

nation outside your Committee.

your committee and the content may not be disclosed to unauthorized person

has had at least twenty years' experience in the FBI with wide

be given the title of Inspector with no change in pay for the

duration of their liaison assignment and be authorized to use

personal cards for official business as needed.

The men handling both our domestic and foreign liaison

contacts for the Bureau have been carefully selected on the basis

of their background and experience to effectively represent the

Bureau at the highest levels of important foreign and domestic

agencies. All of these men will be meeting frequently with u.s.

and foreign officials of the highest rank, which will

include

Cabinet officers, Ambassadors and heads of important domestic and

foreign agencies.

In order to carry out their assignments in the most

effective manner, I believe that it is important that these men

be recognized as

much as possible by the officials they are con-

tacting as key representatives of the FBI.

This procedure has been

followed in the past with regard to the two Bureau representatives

handling our liaison with Congress and the American Bar Association,

both of whom carry the title of Inspector. This has been found

to be highly beneficial in assisting these individuals in fulfilling

their important liaison responsibilities and I feel it should be

equally helpful to the men of our new Liaison Section who have been

selected to handle our domestic and foreign liaison assignments.

There are currently 36 Special Agents who have credentials with

title of Inspector. Most are Number One Men to Assistant Directors or to

Acting Associate Director or assigned to Inspection Division. About six or

seven carry the title of Inspector so as to give them stature as Bureau

representatives above the rank of Special Agent in keeping with their duties

requiring them to represent the Bureau in significant contacts in the

Congressional, diplomatic, Government agency, business, and private sectors.

Although I feel the issuance of Inspector's credentials should be restricted as

much as possible, the duties of our liaison agents are such as to qualify them

for the temporary title of Inspector for the duration of their liaison assignment

and at no change in grade or salary. Upon reassignment from liaison duties

authority to carry Inspector's credentials should be automatically terminated.

ADDENDUM W. M. FELT

11-27-72:

I have carefully considered the information submitted by Domestic

Intelligence and Administratiye Divisions as to the conferring of the title

Inspector on the 10 supervisors currently assigned to the Liaison Section.

However, I do not feel that the best interests of the Bureau will be served

in the long run by taking favorable action. I am convinced that to accede

to this request would result in similar requests from other divisions, many

of which would appear to be as justified as the issue currently in hand.

In the long run therefore, we would, in a sense, be lessening the importance

of the Inspector's title in the Bureau.

Moreover, I can also foresee problems in reassigning a man from

such duties and removing the Inspector's title from him. Such action would

be in the form of a demotion in accordance with the Veterans' Preference

Act which specifically states 30 days advance written notice must be furnished

to an employee if he is reduced in grade, salary or rank. If we were to

advise an employee that this title was temporary and would be in effect only

for the duration of his current assignment we would still have to abide by the

law in giving the employee 30 days' advance written notice. Therefore, in

considering all ramifications of this matter, approval is not given to the

recommendation.

Pilefrate the title.
