official and asked if he had any recollection concerning the bricfing of
any Departmental official with regard to our Cointelpros, ir. Del.oach
responded he had talked to former Attorney General Clark on several
occasions and discussed with him all phases of the operations of the
Intelligence Division of the FBI in which these programs were handled,
Mr. DeLoach stated he had briefed former Attorney General Clark not
only regarding the various Cointelpros but regarding even more sensi-
tive matters, [a@. DeLoach could nat place any date of such briefings
but he recalled very specifically having so briefed the Attorney General,

Additionally, ir. DeLoach stated it was his recollection
that former Attorney General Nicholas deB, Katzenbach knew about the
Cointelpro relating to the Ku Klux Klan but that he, Mér. DeLoach, had
not personally briefed him regarding this matter. iir. DeLoach said
former Attorney General Katzenbach was possibly briefed by former
Assistant to the Director Alan H, Belmont or forraer Assistant to the
Director William C. Sullivan, Mir. DeLoach added he recalicd very
clearly briefing former President Johnson regarding the Bureau's
activities against black militants in the United States, iir. DeLoach
stated he was sure of the foregoing and would be glad to so testify,

On November 16, 1974, former Assistant to the Direc-
tor John P. iviohr stated he vividly recalled on several occasions the

to the Legal Counsel Division 3/24/75 for temporary assignment in ?

iL the Freedom of Information Act Unit. This temporary assignment a

‘ was changed to INTD 4/22/75 and for continuance in her duties in

INTD with the Senstudy 75 Project, a position description to facilitate

her permanent transfer to the Project would normally be required

after 120 days from 3/24/75, or by 7/21/75.

Miss Korb is currently on extended annual leave (from

r 6/13 - 7/11 -- total of 20 work days). In view of this extended period

RE: REQUEST PERTAINING TO ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE

NOTE:

Original monograph outlining subversive connections
of King and other pertinent data was originally prepared and
disseminated at a high level in the Government 10/16/63, These
copies were subsequently retrieved because the Attorney General
felt they should be recalled, Subsequent revisions and updating
of the monograph were prepared and disseminated in 1964, 1967
and 1968,

Copies of Director Hoover's internal memoranda dated
11/7/63 and 2/5/64 being furnished the Attorney General and the
SSC have had data originally contained therein excised which is
not germane to the SSC's request, This information deals generally
_With the Bobby Baker and Ellen Rometsch cases; a bombing in
Birmingham, Alabama; offethe-record discussions relative to King's
communist affiliations with the Rooney Committee; a letter on
King prepared for the Attorney General; leaks by the press of data
on FBI cases; and personal comments,

Memorandum 12/17/64, from F, J. Baumgardner to W, C,
Sullivan, captioned "Communist Infiltration of SCLC, IS«C" has
been excised to conceal source of information for data concerning
and identity of Cordy T, Vivian, Southern Christian Leadership
Conference (SCLC) Director of Affiliates, a past member of the
Communist Party, USA, This memorandum also excised to delete name
of Senator Richard Russell (D-Georgia) who it was recommended be
advised concerning SCLC's utilization as a recruiter of blacks
to take part in the National Science Foundation program and the
identity of the University of Mississippi as one of the schools
for which recruits were to be sought.

Memorandum C, D, Brennan to W, C, Sullivan dated 8/24/67
eaptioned "Martin Luther King, Jr., SMC" showing dissemination of
monograph to a\representative of a friendly foreign intelligence
service has beeli excised to delete the identity of its recipient,
fa_covert Australian intelligence officer assigned at the
Australian Embassy, Washington, D. C., as well as the identity of
his Service and country, §)

RE: REQUEST PERTAINING TO ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE

tf
NOTE CONTINUED:
Memorandum 3/11/68 captioned "Martin Luther King, Jr.,
SMC" prepared by G. C. Moore for W. C. Sullivan was excised to
delete names of prominent black extremists Stokely Carmichael
and H, Rap Brown_due to privacy considerations,

It is also noted that review of appropriate files in
connection with this project failed to result in location of
memoranda dated 12/21/64 which secured authority to furnish
copies of the King monograph to Carl T, Rowan, then Director of the
United States Information Agency, and to then Vice President
Hubert H, Humphrey, Letters of transmittal to these individuals
are among enclosures attached,

Privacy considerations also involved in some of the
excisions in the 8/24/67 and 12/17/64 commmications mentioned
above. No third agency consideration involved in documents
being furnished SSC. Also, excisions made in memoranda 11/22/64
and 11/27/64 from Sullivan to Belmont, because of privacy
considerations. saat

The Attorney General telephoned at approximately 10:15 a.m.
He’ advised that he had tried to call the Director who was temporarily out 0

had received a copy of a report submitted to the Attorney General about th
communist activities of Martin Tuther King, The Attorney, General was rei :
to the report captioned "Corimunism and thé Negro Movement -- A Current. “( . |...

idissemination: ‘was made of this report in addition to the Army and the purtose
jfor such.dissemination. : He was obviously irritated. He went on to ask if the
Army got copies of all reports submitted to him. I told the Attorney General ti

- Obviously the Army did not get copies of all reports we sent to him perscn
but that there were hundreds of reports that did go to the Army that did not
concern matters of sufficient importance to warrant the Attorney General's persauz_
attention. I pointed out to him that we regularly submitted some type of revoris

‘\in matters of current interest under our Internal Security jurisdiction, and that
dissemination of these summaries was made to the military authorities as well
as other top governmental eaten eu of responsibilities they have in this
connection,

The Attorney General asked what responsibilities the Army had in

trelation to the communist background of Martin Luther King. I told the Atio:

? {General the report went beyond this and that the Army had an interest in comm
[activities particularly in relation to racial matters because the military had to

Tho Attorney General stated he {s concerned about that a8 he
odiwas. He stated a lot of these things acem to ba coming out ia
is 5 which were not before. Iagreed and stated Drew Pearson, I hapsen
to knew, in regard to his column this morning, got the entire information
‘orce who have coptes of our reports; that this man (leynolds)}

secarity rich; that Pearson zot access to the files of the Air Force and has
attributed it to us - that whon you read the thing, it counds as though everytaing
was furnished by the FRI when in reality Pearson could not get inside any coor of
tho Bureau as he is held in contempt by evarybody in the Bureau. I stated
Pearsen hangs it on to the FEL as if it emanated from us. Latated Pearson

did the saine thing In reyard to the assass mn of the. President, that he
attr: ain information ta the RI wi aga matter of fact, he got
from Earl Warren bimessli, I stated Pearson and Warren are close friends;

’ they travel tovcther and spend vacations together. I stated I had been tipped

off in advance that Pearsca was writing a colunm critical of the Sareau and
giving information regarding the Lee Harvey Cawald Case and Poarson rade -
it appear we were leaking Inforraation when as a matter of fact nothing ever _

was leaked out until after the report loft the Bureau and then thinzs began

leaking cut, I stated a lot leaked out in Dallas from the Folice Department,
which was doing @ lot of talking about the evicicnce they sont us like the

gun, the fincerprints, et cetera. I stated we identified them and in turn made
a report to the Dallas Police Depastcent and the Chief thea went on TV and
radio and reported what we found, I stated I told the Agent in Charge to tell
the Chief I wanted hima to shut up; of course, the Chie? could have ignored me,
but nevertacless I thought he was doing a grent deal of harm, but the Chief
did shut up and he never appeared on TV or radio again, but the harm had
been cone because certain members of the Presidential Commission on the
Assassination thought the material was leaked out by the FBI. i stated
Pearson was the aathor of that kind of a coluran just as this morning if you
read his column, the I SI iurnished everything ebout this fellow Reynolds who
is involved in the Bobby Daker case when, infact, copies of oar resorts af -
an investication on iieynoids years ago went tothe Air Force. I stated 1 was

Memorandum to W. C, Sullivan
From F, J. Baumgardner
RE: COMMUNIST INFILTRATION OF
SOUTHERN CHRISTIAN LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE
100-438794 i

U. S. Government are involved. The Atlanta Office has ~
recommended that Senator Richard Russell (D. Georgia) be
advised concerning this matter. This appears inadvisable
since such action could conceivably cause repercussions which
would only aggravate the racial situation that exists in the
South,

It is felt that Dr. Leland J, Haworth, Director,
NSF, should be furnished information regarding communist
influences exerted on the SCIC and King. In this regard.
we recently disseminated to the White House and the a
heads of the intelligence community copies of a "Top Secret"
summary entitled "Communism and the Negro Movement}<-A -
Current Analysis" which contains information regarding the
SCIC and King. This summary deals with King's communist
connections and his personal immoral activities, With the
receipt of this summary by Dr. Haworth, the SCLC would
undoubtedly be removed from the NSF progeana to cbtain qualificd
Negro students for southern schools,

The information concerning the SCIC participation ~
in the NSF program is being separately disseminated to the
Department and interested intelligence agencies.

RECOMMENDATION:

There is attached for approval a letter to
Dr, Ieland J. Haworth, Director, NSF, transmitting a copy
of the recently prepared summary entitled "Communism and
the Negro Movement--A Current Analysis."

King's strong criticism and condemnation of the

This is an excellent suggestion and we have already
Started the necessary research, Bringing this monograph up to :

, date and disseminating it at high level prior to King's '"Wash-
ington Spring Project'' should serve again to remind top-level
_offieials in Government of the wholly disreputable character

of King.

As you know, King's "Washington Spring Project" was
originally scheduled for early April, 1968. However, our
Washington Field Office has developed information that King's

_ group is experiencing difficulty in recruiting individuals
‘to participatein the demonstration and the date for the project
. has now tentatively been set for April 27, 1968. i

1st sip inten sii

Because of the importance of doing a . thorough job..on
this, we will conduct an exhaustive file review to bring together
the most complete and up-to-date information and to present it }~
in a hard-hitting manner, To make the brief timely, we will
have it.completed and ready for dissemination by March 14, 1968.

THE THREAT

The Communist Party, USA (CPUSA) presents a greater a

menace to the internal security of our Nation today than it >: .

ever has since it was first foynded in this country im 1919.

The dangerousness of the CPUSA cannot be evaluated except in

the light of its relationship to the international communist

conspiracy and its ties to the Soviet Union. In this regard :

it is well to note that the rate of progress achieved by the -_

international communist offensive is unparalleled in history,

In the past 43 years, it has advanced steadily and surely,

never varying its eventual goai of dominating the world,

until today its empire extends from Bast Germany to China,’

This empire is so vast and sprawling that when night settles

on its western frontier, dawn already is breaking on its

eastern frontier. This internation:i communist conspiracy

controls one fourth of the land area and approximately one
Z third of the inhabitants of the cdrth, — | :

a The CPUSA is a vital link in thie world-wide cen= it
spiracy. it utilizes elaborate security measures to conceal at
its operations while vigorously promoting front groups as.well
as other concealed outiets in furtherance of its clandestine

ursuits, It is gouptotely dominated by and is subservient
o the Communist Party (CP) of the Soviet Union. This fact

has been made abundantly cleat on a number of occasions, sone
of which ares : asapataecaea aceeee . :

CPUSA National Executive Committee in New York City on
December 18, 1960, She said that "The CPUSA has a prestige
which is almost incredible in the socialist countries," At
this mecting she said the CP of the Soviet Union is the most .
wonderful party in the world and that, "Z came away with the.cem ~
feeling we are a family. We beiong.to a great family." UFlyni
told those members assembled that, the coments of the CPUSA’

= are considered of great importance anong other communist

parties of the world, : : pazeerael

In dight of the above, it can be readily seen that
the seriousness of the domestic threat from a Soviet-dominated ~~
cP in the United States is in direct ratio to the world thréat
posed by its masteys in the Soviet Union; — .. . :

I The CPUSA at its 17th National Convention held behind ;
closed doors in New York City in December, 1959, outlined a y

with 180,000,000 people." Included in the principal targets for
infiltration are youth, minority groups, Negro organizations, °
labor unions, mass organizations, education and American politics,

of the Party at all levels with security informants; use of
various techniques to keep the Party off balance and disillusion
individual comunists concerning communist ideology; investigation
of avery Imoun mombor .of.the CPUSA in arder ta deterning whether.
he.shouid be detained in the event. of a national emergency; and
gathering evidence to be used in prosecutions of communists and
communist organizations.

As an adjunct to our reguiar investigative operations,
we carry on'a.carefully plannéd program of counterattack against
the CPUSA which keeps it off balance. Our primary purpose in
this program is to bring about disillusiomient on the part of: .

5 individual members which is.carried on frosi both inside and out~

side the Party organization, In one -phase of the program we use
more than 50 of our informants who occupy strategic positions -
inside the Party and who are able to raise controversial issues,
increase enmities, engage in justifiable criticisms of Party .
leaders and Party programs, thereby keeping factionalism alive

_ and preventing the Party leadership, from obtaining monolithic

unity. In certain instances we have been successful in preventir

- communists from seizing control of legitimate maas organizations

_ And have discredited others who were secretly oporating inside

such organizations, For example, during 1959 we were able to
prevent the CPUSA from seizing control of the 20,000-menber
branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People in Chicago, Illinois. :

: We are keeping abreast of the activity of the CPUSA,
which is attempting through its programs to infiltrate American
institutions and groups and to increase its influence on the
American scene, by intensive investigation into every facet of
its activity. Over the years we have investigated thousands of
individual members of the CPUSA in order to determine whether
they might constitute a potential danger te the internal security
of the country in time of a national emergency. The results of
these investigations are furnished various departments and
agencics of the Executive Branch of the Government when infore
mation is developed during the course of the investigations of
interest to thems The dissemination of this information enables
these departments and agencies of tne Government to take what-
ever action is necessary from a policy standpoint as it relates’
to the security of their operations. . :

. _ Prosecution has been a major weapon against the CPUSA.
The Department of Justice first instituted prosecution against .
leaders of the CPUSA in New York City in 1948, Since that tine
prosecution has been instituted against numerous individual cose
tmunist functionaries, against the CPUSA as an organization,
against comaunist front erqanizations and against labor unions
controlled and dominated by communist elements, The primary
evidence in al1 of these prosecutions was furnished by our
security informants, We have made available approximately 160
Security informants for testimony in these cases,

The Supreme Court of the United States is presently
considering communist cases under the Internal Security Act of

‘ 1950 and the Smith Act of 1940. As was expected, CPUSA funce

BACKGROUND :

- “Historically, the problem of the Ku Klux Klanin
the United States has exiSted since the days of Reconstruction
following the Civil War, The Invisible Empire is well known
for its terrorist, nightriding activities and has been respon-
sible since its inception for numerous racial atrocities
throughout the country. The Klan reached: its peak during the
1920s when it claimed millions of members and it became almost
defunct during Vorld War II. In 1954, with the historic
Supreme Court decision regarding desegregation of public
schools, it became revitalized. In 1964, with the passage of
Civil rights legislation by the Congress, the Klan réeéruited
thousands of persons who feared the-rise of the Negro and __
the threat to the "Southern way of Life." Paaaoat . -

on

.

, rn .

: The Klan has usually been located in the South al-
though there have been attempts to organize it in the North;--
Midwest, and far West. The Klan attracts individuals in the
rural areas who are poorly educated with limited incomes,

The Klan exploits the fears, hatred, and ignorance of people
who feel they are threatened by the Negro, the Jew, the ~
taut and the inmigrant.

PRESENT STATUS ”

Presently there are 14 Klan organizations under -
" investigation with a membership of approximately 14,000. The

+ Ylargest of these groups, the United Klans of America, Ince,

=f fotghts of the ku Klux Klan, with Headquarters in Tuscaloosa,

EBL RESPONSIBILITY

This ‘Bureau has a- three- fold purpoge in investigating
the Ku Klux Klan and individuals associated with Klan organi-
zations. First, we investigate violations of Federal law
committed by the Klan wi h the view toward prosecution in
Federal court. | Second, we conduct intelligence investigations
with the view toward infiltrating the Ku Klux Klan with infor-
mants, neutralizing it as a terrorist organization, and deterring
violence, Third, -we provide the Department with the results
of our investigations for possible designation of Klan organi-
zations under Executive Order 10450,

MAJOR CASES

Murder of Three Civil Rights Vorkers :

In June, 1964, three civil rights workers were
murdered in Neshoba County, Mississippi, setting off an inten-
sive FBI investigation, In October, 1967, 7 of 18 defendants:
were ‘convicted in Federal court in Meridian, Mississippi, for
violation of the victims' civil rights, An.8th defendant
pleaded guilty and a mistrial was déclared as to three other
defendants.. Our investigations revealed that there was a broad
Ki Klux Klan plot kehind the abduction and murder of the victims,

wounds received when his home was burned and shot into by
the Ku Klux Klan, Twelve klansmen have been indicted by
the Federal Grand Jury and the case is presently pending in
United States District Court at Hattiesburg. FBI informants .
were instrumental in determining in the early stages. of the
investigation that Gamel H. Boner and the members of the
Waite Knights of the Ku Klux Klan of Mississippi were
responsible for Dahmer's death, -

In July, 1964, Lemuel Penn, an Army Reserve a
Lieutenant Colonel and Negro educator from Washington, D. C.,
was killed by shotgun blasts near Colbert, Georgia. An exhaus-
tive investigation by this Bureau resulted in the arrest of -
four members of the Ku Klux Klan, Informants also played a
major role in this case. In October, 1964, a Federal Grand
Jury returned an indictnent charging six men, including the
four arrested for Penn's murder, with conspiracy to injure,
oppress, and threaten to intimidate Negro citizens in the free
exercise of their Constitutional rights. Two of the defendants
were convicted and four were acquitted, | :

Informant coverage in Klan‘ groups has bden an

in other states and its lack of success can be, attributed to

for these bombings, The Department ruled that there was
no prosecutable Federal violation. However, we pursued an
intelligence-type investigation and furnished local author-
ities in’Milwaukee with complete information coming from
our Chicago Klan informants. Cirher Warden Cheney? was sub-

an intensive organizational effort in the State of Virginia,
We immediately began an all-out effort to penetrate the :
Virginia Klan, contain its growth, and deter violence. Working
closely with local and state authorities wa were able to
disseminate information on contemplated cross burnings.
Several arrests were made based on FBI information furnished
to local police and in one situation, a klansman was sentenced
to three years in local court for burning crosses, a felony
under Virginia law. While conducting official investigations,
two Agents of this Bureau were assaulted by klansmen who were .
later convicted on charges of Assault of a Federal Officer and

" Obstruction of Justice in Federal Court in Richmond, Virginia,

In Decembér, 1966, the Special Agent in Charge of

information regarding Klan activities in his state. As a
result, Governor Godwin pressed for more effective enforcenent -
of Virginia cross burning laws, .and publically repudiated the |
Ku Klux Klan. Shortly after thé Governor's public repudiation,
the Klan attempted..to retaliate and we learned of plans to
burn erosses in the Gity of Richmond in defiance of the
Governor, We furnished this data to local authorities who _
arrested five klansmen, thus endaieted dampening Klan enthu-
siasm for such projects.

“LEATSON WITH LOCAL, AUTHORITY TES ft
When we receive intelligence information concerning
7 violations of local laws such as cross burnings, bombings,
or shootings, we notify local authorities, For example, in
April of 1966, the Louisiana Klan planned to burn crosses
throughout the state. We furnished this data to local author- .
ities and arrests were effected thus deterring further ects
of. harassment, intimidation, and violence, This 1s another
example of ineidents which are handled in our day-to-day cons
' tects with local police. .

« We are constantly alert for {information concerning :
klansmen who become members of local and state police i
agencies and Kien attempts to infiltrate law enforcement. siete
Law enforcement agencies have always been a prime target of +. *
the Ku Klux Klan. In 1964, we furni'shed information to -
Governor Paul Johngon of Mississippi concerning klansmen who
were members of the Mississippi Highway Patrol. These men
were subsequently fired. Since that time relations have
greatly improved rendering more effective the fair exercise
of Local law enforcement responsibilities in Mississippi.

: It has been part of our established policy to notify
the head of the law enforcement agency involved of any mem-
ber of his organization who hasbeen sworn into the Ku Klux
Rlan, In resuanaataind the Governor of the state is notified.

“INTERVIEWS OF KLANSMEN : Pee
One of the greatest attractions for klansmen is
the alleged cloak of secrecy which surrounds their Klan - :
membership. We have found that.e program of seledtive intere
views of klansmen, where they are made aware of our knowledge
_ their Klan affiliation, has done much to cause disillusion-
ment of thé members and disruption of the organization.” In -
some instances klansmen volunteer information about the
organization and its activities, ‘These interviews also put
us in a position to assess eachmmember With regard to his :
potential as an informant, Although our Agents in conducting
their interviews are frequently -met with hostility and threats
by militant klansmen, our Klen interview program has been most.

CounterintelLinence pod :

TA highly specialized na. aggressive program of counter-
intelligénce wase initiated in 1956 for the purpose of exposing,
disrupting, discrediting, and otherwise neutralizing the Communis
Party-USA, and related organizations. Accumulated successes
‘achieved in Gane efforts directed against the commmists under
this program, coupled with increased activity by the purveyors

of racial hate, warranted the expansion of the program in the -

, Fall of 1964 to ‘inelude Klan- and ‘hate-type organizations and

their memberships. Counterintelligence action today is a valu-.

-able adjunct to investigative responsibilities and the techniques

used complement our investigations. All information related: to

| the targeted organizations ’ their. leadership and members, which

is developed from a variety of sources 7 is carefully reviewed :

‘for its potential for“use under this program. Sreneae

Examples of recent disrupting and neutralizing results
achieved by this program are the following: : : ; /

“The principal vehicle in which the Communist |
is endeavoring to influence and recruit youth is the W. E. B.
DuBois Clubs of America, which was spawned by the Party in
-San Francisco, California, in June, 1964. The DuBois Clubs
projects itself as a "broad-based Socialist organization, " while
its dedicated communist leadership deviously operates behind the
Scenes in an effort to manipulate and influence the political

‘climate on the Nation's campuses. |

A CURRENT ANALYSIS "i

The enclosed article, captioned as above,.is the
one we have been preparing in line with approval of our
recommendation to disseminate it on a select basis at a
very high level to show current communist activities in
relation to the Negro movement. It incorporates up-to-date
that al just received from our New York Office relating
to the ent meeting of the Communist Party's National
Executi Committee, Discussion of racial matters was a
primary topic at the week-long meeting.

. The enclosed article is a factual, documented
analysis of the over-all current situation. We believe
that it would be of interest not only to the Attorney General
but also to Mr.:O'Donnell, at the White House; Mr. McCone, at
the Central Intelligence Agency; Mr. Rusk, at the Department
of State; as well as to Mr. McNamara and the three Armed Forces

The Attorney General said he would like to know what other
dissemination was made of this report in addition to the Army and the purpose’
for ‘such dissemination. He was obviously irritated. He went on to ask if the
‘Army got copies of all reports submitted to him. I told the Attorney General that
obviously the Army did not get copies of all reports we sent to him personally,
but that there were hundreds of reports that did go to the Army that did not
concern matters of sufficient importance to warrant the Attorney General's personal
attention. I pointed out to him that We regularly submitted some type of reports
in matters of current interest under our Internal Security jurisdiction, and that
jdissemination of these summaries was made to the military authorities as well
jas other top governmental officials because of Eons they have in this
iconnection. 7 ;

The Attorney General asked what ‘responsibilities the Army had in
trelation to the communist background of Martin Luther King. I told the Attorney
General the report went beyond this and that the Army had an interest in communi: st
lactivities particularly in relation to racial matters because the military had to be
tealled‘on if civil disturbances arising out of such matters went beyond the ability
‘of the civilian authorities.

This explanation seemed to serve no purpose." The Attorney General
said he still could not undersiand why we sent a report io the Army on King's
communist activities. He reiterated his request for information as to the dissemina
tion of the report in question and the purpose for it,

This memorandum recommends that the National Science
Foundation (NSF) be furnished information concerning the
= communist influence exerted on the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference (SCIC) and its President, Dr, Martin luther King, Jrs
This appears necessary since the SCLC has been contacted by the
NSF for the purpose of obtaining applicants for southern schoolss

has furnished information that ~

z » was advised that the NSF
desired qualified applicants to enter the University of
and otker schools in southern states where the NSF has its
program in progress. was advised that the NSF was |

they did not want i to. appear that the NST was

was advised that each qualified applicant
would receive a $3,000 scholarship from the NSF, Since this
is a Government project any expenses incurred in this matter
“would not come out of anyone's pocket," This would ndicate
that any expenses incurred by the SCIC in their recruitment
effort would be paid for with Government: funds.

SPSRESREOpES

The communist influences exerted on King are well
known. to the Bureau, has in the past been a member
of the Communist Party. .

It is incredible that an outfit such as the SCLC

should be utilized for the purpose of recruiting Negroes to

Hemorandum to W. C, Sullivan
From F, J. Baumgardner
RE: COMMUNIST INFILTRATION OF
SOUTHERN CHRISTIAN LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE

U. 8S, Government are involved, The Atlanta Office has |
recommended that ~ be
advised concerning this matter, This appears inadvisable
since such action could conceivably cause repercussions which
would only aggravate the racial situation that exists in the
South,

It is felt that Dr. Leland J; Haworth, Director,
NSF, should be furnished information regarding communist
influences exerted on the SCLC and King. In this regard
we recently disseminated to the White House and the ’
heads of the intelligence community copies of a "Top Secret"
summary entitled "Communism and the Negro Hovement--A 7
Current Analysis" which contains information regarding the
SCLC and King. This summary deals with King’s communist
connections and his personal immoral activities, With the
receipt of this summary by Dr. Haworth, the SCLC would
undoubtedly he removed from the WST program to obtain qualified
Regro students for southern schools.

The information concerning the SCIC participation: ~
in the NSF program is being separately disseminated to the
Department and interested intelligence agencies. .-

RECOMMENDATION:

There is attached for approval a letter to
Dr, Ieland J. Haworth, Director, NSF, transmitting a copy
of the recently prepared summary entitled "Communism and
the Negro Movenent-~A Current Analysis.”

You will recall that in December, 1964, with the
Director's approval and after first checking with the White |
‘House, we disseminated to the Heads of the intelligence
community a paper’ captioned as above which depicted the
communist influence in the Negro movement. Emphasis was
given in the paper to the communist influences on Martin Luther
King,Jr., as well as facts relating to his immoral nature.

bad As you are aware, LeRoy Collins, former Governor of
Florida, is Director, Community Relations Service (CRS),
Departient of Comierce, and inthis position serves as something
of a "mediator't in problems relating to the racial field. He
has been a key individual relative to the situation in Selma,
Alabama, Information of interest to the CRS is regularly being
disseminated to that agency. We just received reliable infor-=
mation concerning a conversation between Martin Luther King, Jr.
and. his wife, Coretta, during which Coretta made reference to
the Selma situation and said that Collins was blinded by

- prejudice. We have disseminated the information concerning

the King conversation to CRSo o

rene one

It is believed that, in view of Collins! important
position relative to the racial movement, he should have
benefit of the paper which we have already given to the
White House and the Heads of the intelligence community. Our rela~

‘ On my recent inspection of the Legal Attache office

MATTERS - A CURRENT ANALYSIS
PURPOSE:

fo obtain authorization for high level dissemination
‘of a document captioned as above which shows the degree of
communist influence on Martin Luther King.

Enclosed is a tocument captioned as above, which
depicts communist influence in the civil rights field,
emphasizing the key role of Martin Luther King, Jr. This
document is a current revision of the previous analysis

captioned "Communism and the Negra movement ~ A Current Aualysis,"

‘prepared and disseminated in November, 1964. In updating it,
we have emphasized these areas: (1) continued reliance of King
upon former Communist Party, USA, members, particularly Stanley
‘David Levison; (2) facts relating to King’s moral degeneracy3,
-and (3) communist goal of uniting the peace and civil rights
movements and King's adherence to this communist long-range
objective. z :

: 2

- King's strong criticism and condemnation of the

on 4/4/67 shows how much he has been influenced by communist

advisors. His speech was a direct parallel of the communist
‘position on Vietnam.

: It is felt that the President would be interested in
1a° summary on King which shows the.degree-of communist influence.
The attached paper constitutes a complete picture "and

Upon receipt of the memorandum and the Braise nai

I discussed with Mr. Adams at 5:05 p.m., 6/20/75, the necessity to
advise Mr. Wilderotter that the inventory’ was prepared and to discuss - >}
with him the propriety of making this material available to the Department. N
Mr. Adams agreed and I called Mr. Wilderotier's Office at the White
‘House at 5:19 p.m., 6/20. His secretary assured me he would return “at
my cali, Mr. Wilderotter called me at 10:15 a.m., on 6/23. I explained ™
to him that Mr. Farrington had completed compiling an inventory of the SX
items Wilderotter furnished Farrington and that among the items on the

ventory I observed several which related to the official and sce suite

Dattiw

files that,had been maintained in Director Hoover's personal office suite.

I told Mr. Wilderotter that it was my understanding that the Deputy
‘Attorney General was interested in discussing the official and confidential
files with the Attorney General prior to discussing the matter with g
representatives of té Senate-Select-Committee. I told him that I thought 3

Memo to Mr. Adams A
Re: Inventory of Documents Received From 7
Former Associate Deputy Attorney General coos Saini

in any way I felt was appropriate. He said that he would like to have -
an indication from the Bureau as to the materials we had received
from him and some sort of a receipt for the materials. He said he
did not want to be accused later of having removed classified material
‘rom the Department of Justice. In that regard I told Wilderotter that _
e@ probably could furnish him a copy of the inventory and a receipt cos
indicating that the items described therein were receivedfrom him, _

I understand Mr. Wilderotter's concern about possible
allegations that he removed material from the Department and I believe
it would be appropriate for us to prepare some statement indicating the
extent of the materials he did furnish to Mr. Farrington. If we furnish
Wilderotter a copy of the inventory, he will have information classified

- . top secret and sufficient identifying data as to particular documents to
indicate the identities of individuals which could, if inadvertently
—-- 4 disclosed, result in invasions of personai privacy. Therefore, I suggest
that we may comply with Mr. Wilderotter's request hy attaching a copy .
of the inventory to a letter addressed to the Attorney General stating that
the materials described were received fom Mr: Wilderotter. We could
furnish Mr, Wilderotter a copy-of that-letter and allow him to review .

Appearance before Ss Figp 80
Senate Select Committee on Intelligence on BV apg
June 4, 1975

I was questioned by Mr. Mark Gittenstein and Miss Mary D'Oreo,
members of this Committee, on June 4, 1975, from 2:30 P.M. to
4:40 P. M. on June 4, 1975.

He started the questioning by asking about the different positions held
by Mr. Tolson in the FBI. He was advised when he came to the Seat of
Government he held the positions of Chief Clerk in the Administrative Division,
Inspector, Assistant Director, Assistant to the Director and Associate
Director. He asked how many people were in Mr. Tolson's Office at the
time of Mr. Hoover's death. I advised him that Mr. Mark Felt, Mr. William B.
Soyars, Mrs. Mutter, Miss Smith and Miss Tschudy (in the reception room,
and myself In a room next to Mr. Tolson's Office. He requested me to draw
a diagram of the suite of offices showing the entrances thereto, which I did.
‘ He asked me about the file cabinets in these offices and whether there were
\ any cabinets in Mr. Felt's Office. He asked me whether I took any dictation
| from Mr. Felt and I told him Mr. Felt dictated to his secretary, Miss Tschudy.

He then asked me what Expedite Processing meant. I told him this
meant that the more important matters were processed and recorded by the
Files Division than the lesser important mail. In other words, this meant by
processing the more important mail first, this category of mail would have
action taken on it before the lesser important mail was acted on.

He then asked me about the abstracts, and who prepared them. I told
him abstracts were prepared on all correspondence; that when I first went to
the FBI the stenographers would prepare them but that was changed and the
individuals dictating the correspondence would dictate the abstracts. He
commented that he thought the abstracts were a very good system.

Mr. Gittenstein asked me if Mr. Tolson would ever get any letters
makkéd "personal and Confidential" from any of the Agents or Agents in Charge"
and I told him occasionally he did. He wanted to know what happened to them
and I told him as far as I knew they went to the Files Section. He also asked
if Mr. Hoover ever received any and I told him that any he routed around
for Mr. .Tolson to see were sent back to Mr. Hoover by Mr. Tolson and I
could not say what happened to them after they were sent back.

He asked me if anyopapers were sent to Mr. Tolson by Mr. Hoover

marked "OC" and I told him I never saw any.

Mr. Gittenstein questioned me at great length about the Executives
Conferences, how often they were held, who attended them, and who dictated
the Executive Conference memoranda. I told him they were generally held
about once a week, but sometimes only when there were special matters
to be discussed. I told him they were attended by the Assistants to the
Director and the Assistant Directors or by their alternates and that they
were held in Mr. Tolson's office. I told him the individual who had matters
to be discussed dictated the memorandum, which covered all matters
discussed at the conference. He asked whether Mr. Hoover attended these
conferences and I told him he did not. He asked where these Memoranda
were kept and I told him they were kept in the Files Division. Theré was
considerable discussion about these memoranda. Mr, Gittensteintold me
this was necessary as there was considerable confusion as to these memoranda
and confidential matters.

Mr. Gittenstein asked me if I made a log of Mr. Tolson's appointments
like the Director's Telephone Room Did. I told him I did not, as Mr. Tolson
did not make any appointments; thgt Mr. Tolson was extremely busy all the
time and when he had any matters to discuss with anyone, he would either
call them on the intercom system or have me call them to come to his office
to see him.

He asked me about the cabinets in the Director's office and if I knew
what they contained. I told him I did not. He asked me about the index cards
in Miss Gandy's office. I told him I would occasionally ask about personal
friends of Mr. Hoover and Mr. Tolson and whether they were written on a
first name basis.

He asked when Mr. Hoover was out of town did Mr. Tolson take over
his duties. I told him they were generally away at the same time. He asked

NW 68262 Docid:32989612 Page 265



ee ®

Mr. Gittenstein asked me how many rooms there were in Mr. Hoover's
house and I gave him this information. He asked me if there were any cabinets
in the first and second floors of the house and I told him there were not. He
then asked me about the cabinets in the Recreation Room and what they
contained. I told him there were cabinets containing 8 drawers and that
these cabinets were used for and contained Mr. Tolson's personal papers
and nothing official. I told him there were two cabinets containing Mr. Hoover's
personal investmehts: that I had occasion to use these files in connection with
his investments and his estate and, in answer to questions from Mr. Gittenstein
and Miss D'Oreo, I told them I did not see any official papers in these cabinets.

Mr. Gittenstein said he understood there were a great number of
boxes in the Recreation Room and he asked me if I knew what they contained
and what happened to them. I asked him if I could get some guidance from
Mr. Mohr on this matter, as Mr. Mohr accompanied me to the meéting.
Mr. Mohr told me he was there when the appraisers came to appraise the
contents of Mr. Hoover's house in connection with the settlement of his
estatg that he was with the appraisers the entire time they were opening
the boxes, that he saw what each box contained, and that the boxes and their
contents were sent to Sloans for auction sale.

There was considerable discussion as to what Miss Gandy did while
Iwas there. I again told them I did not go to Mr. Hoover's house until
after I retired and I thought my first day there was June 14, 1972. I told
them I had a month's accumulation of work and was extremely busy; that
I worked at a desk with my back toward Miss Gandy; that I knew she was
working on some papers on the table where she was sitting but I did not
know what they consisted of and I did not ask her as I did not consider it
any of my business. My function was strictly to take care of Mr. Tolson's
personal matters. Miss D'Oreo did considerable discussion about this
matter. She asked me if Miss Gandy was destroying any papers. I said
she was putting some papers on her table into a cardboard box. She asked
me where the papers came from and I said I did not know as Miss Gandy
was there before I arrived and she had her work on the table at that time.
She wanted to know whether the papers were in manila folders and whether
the folders were marked as to their contents. I told her I thought there was
some typing on the tab of the folders but I did not know or read any of the
typing. She asked me if from my knowledge of regular Bureau files whether
any of her papers consisted of official Bureau files. I told her I saw no
official files whatsoever. She asked me if I ever saw Miss Gandy go into the
two file cabinets containing Mr. Hoover's personal papers. As I could
see these files from my desk I told her I could definitely say I never saw her
go into these files. I again stressed the fact that I had never been to Mr. Hoover's
house until June 14, 1972 and I only went there once a week and that I only
saw Miss Gandy about three or four times after I first went there. Miss D'Oreo
again asked me if there were any official papers in the cabinets containing
Mr. Hoover's personal investments and I told her that in my references to

nw 6edBeBe test wot see any official papers.



a’ e

Mr. Gittenstein asked if I discussed the closing of Mr. Tolson's
office after his death with Mr. Mohr and I told him I did not as I took
care of this matter myself. He asked me what the cabinets in Mr. Tolson's
office contained and whether he kept any official papers or any manifolds
in his office. I told him Mr. Tolson had no cabinets in his office and that
he kept no official papers or manifolds there. I told him the cabinets
were in my office. He asked me what the cabinets in my office contained
and I told him. I advised him they contained tickler copies of letters
which I had written but which I destroyed ascopies of the same were in
the FBI files and the rest of the material consisted of copies of his income
tax returns, his stock investments and his oil investments, all of which
I packaged and sent to Mr. Tolson at Mr. Hoover's house. He asked me
if I took them or who did take them and I told him it was someone from
the Supply Section. He asked me when these boxes of Mr, Tolson's
personal matters were sent to Mr. Hoover's house and I told him just
before June 12, 19175, when I retired.

He asked me whether there was a garage on the premises and
I told him there was. He asked whether there were any file cabinets
in the garage. I told him I had never been in the garage and assumed
there were only implements stored there.

Miss D'Oreo asked whether there were any cabinets in the
atti¢. I told her I had not been in the attick; that I only went up a
few steps to the attick to ask James E. Crawford, one of Mr, Tolson's
employees, a question but did not go all the way up to the attic.

MOTE CONTINUED:

this paper is an internal deliberative document and recommended
‘ it be withheld from the Committee. In the face of an adverse

ruling by the AG, we recommended by letter to the AG and LHM

. dated June 4, 1975, that access to the paper for review at
FBIHQ be allowed with the stipulation that no notes would be
taken during the initial review. We stated at that time that
should the arrangement be unsatisfactory to the Committee, we
would consider further request for the document. Committee
Staff Member Mark Gitenstein has completed the initial review
under the conditions which we imposed. The Committee Staff
has renewed their request that the paper be made available
to them and their request has been sustained by Mr. K, William
O'Connor of the Department. Under these circumstances, it ‘is
no Longer practical to continue our objections.

MEMORANDUM TO ALL BUREAU OFFICIALS AND SUPERVISORS

(A) COMMUNICATIONS TO FIELD OFFICES -- Communications of any
type sending instructions to field offices should be short, clear and sim-
ple. Use telegraphtype language. Reference prior communications to
avoid needless repetition of previous instructions.

(B) UTILIZATION OF LIAISON SECTION -- A reduction in the number of
Supervisors handling liaison with other Government agencies makes it
necessary that the time of the remainder be utilized most efficiently to
permit the productive handling of contacts with those agencies. It is de-
sired that Supervisors refrain from designating mail for delivery by
Liaison unless a reason exists for such designation. Mail should and
will be delivered by Liaison if it requires discussion with or delivery to
a high-ranking official of another agency, if its sensitivity requires
special iiandliag, or if its content requires some explanation or camment
In the absence of some such reason, mail should be designated for deliv-
ery by the Courier Service or by regular mail.

Dissemination of Bureau reports and memoranda to other Govern-
ment agencies is the responsibility of the substantive Supervisor, and not
of the Liaison Section, Transmittal form 0-14 should be used whether
such dissemination is being made by Liaison, by Courier Service, or by
regular mail. Transmittal forms in the 0-14 series, sometimes referred
-.- to as form routing slips, contain blocks to be checked which will inform
the addressee that no further investigation is contemplated, that the other
agency will be advised of pertinent developments, that the status of the
case is complete or incomplete, and that the item or items are being fur-
nished for the information of the addressee. The last notation is some-
‘times checked without any indication as to the status of the case or whether
further material may be expécted, resulting in later inquiry from the-ad-
dressee. It is desired that when this form is utilized, it be fully executed.

If a Liaison Supervisor is being asked to pass information orally H
to another agency, he should promptly be furnished an appropriate letter-
head memorandum or other communication which will confirm his oral
dissemination. Do not send serials to Liaison with a routing slip asking
“please handle" or “please pass information to --."

Affirmative contacts are being discontinued with twenty-four
agencies with which we have relatively few interests in common. Liai-
son Supervisors will, however, continue to handle urgent matters re- {
quiring personal liaison with those agencies. Supervisors should con- |
tinue to designate for the Liaison Section tickler copies of memoranda i
discussing matters involving other Government agencies, and consider- i
ation should be given to discussion of such matters with the Liaison |
representative prior to preparation of memoranda in order that full facts
concerning our relations with the other agency may be ascertained.
Matters involving our relations with other agencies should be coordin-
ated, wherever possible, with the Liaison Supervisor at the outset. .

Very truly yours,
John Edgar Hoover

When ‘the ‘Numbéx One“ Man is Working outside the office the
Section Chief will be‘present to run the Section and when he
is outside working the Number One Man will handle the Section,

The remainder of the Section will be comprised of
two supervisors handling supervision of all foreign offices,
visits ‘to the U. S. of Legal Attache contacts, Foreign Police
Cooperation matters, and coordination of the Bureau's defense
| planning; three Agents handling supervision of all security
iintormant matters in the U. S.; and one_Agent supervising
{foreign informants and contacts, and the border coverage program.

I believe strongly that this is the barest minimum
4 number with which the Section can operate under the revised
program because even as projected, the Number One Man and the
Section Chief will be engaged in active liaison outside the
office for substantial periods of time, Although the plan
outlined above represents a drastic reduction in personnel,
I am confident that by the concerted and extra efforts of those
remaining, we can continue the suggested revised program of
operation,

SUBJECT:

Pursuant to the Director's instructions, I es carefully looked ito ‘dis -
continuance of liaison functions and resultant release of Agent Supervisory personnel
for reassignment. I have reviewed the Director's instructions (pertinent memoranda ||
attached) and have conferred with various Bureau officials, .

The Director instructed liaison be restricted to White House, Vice President
and National Security Council. Domestic Intelligence Division (DID) listed 65 agencies|
™ being eliminated from liaison contact but also respectfully suggested continued liaison

, with ‘State, Air Force, Army, Navy, Secret Service, Internal Revenue and Civil
_ 1 Service. DID feels that some disadvantage or possible criticism could result from
«z) Giscontinuance of liaison with these key agencies. :

At this point possible criticism or problems are anticipatory. Obviously
we will be alert to such possibilities, and if problems arise, we will meet them and
take such stens as are necessary to solve them We can always. modify our

ny procedures when it is in the Bureau's interests to doso, Furthermore, there appear
i to be no question but that almost all business and necessary dissemination can be
1 handled by teletypes, letters, dissemination memoranda, or by telephone with con-
i . firmation in writing if necessary, Emergency or unusually delicate situations can
ape handled by direct contact. ;
For above reasons, we should immediazs 3#é%s continue liaison service
with all agencies except White House, Vice President, and National Security Council,
‘Our teletype network to key agencies and our regular courier service will provide
expedite transmission. An emergency, such as a threat against the President, can
be handled by phone with confirmation by letter. DID can prepare necessary in -
Structions and guidelines to implement our new procedures. Nine Agent it Supe
including a Section Chief, will be made available for other. assignme nis.

!
. Mr, Sullivai also proposed one of Agents released from liaison be |
designated permanent night supervisor on midnight to 8:00 At sIUEtAAIDIE2, which

is presently filled on rotation basis. Sullivan points out additional correspondence
anticipated because of reduction in liaison, making it more difffeult for various units
to spare men for midnight shift on rotation basis. There may be an increase but it
is impossible now, to determine exact extent. DID should defer this is request for 90

days to de ryping « extent of increased work, load.and submit. t additional justification

Chief would administé? tnit and also be responsible for irregular contacts with key
agencies to maintain effective relations and to resolve and avert incipient problems,

agree with extent of proposed cutbacks, feeling we should maintain liaison with
certain key agencies as set out in his previous proposals, he advises DID will ©
vigorously strive to effectively implement the new procedures,

If these proposals are approved, a total of nine Agent supervisors will be

For many years, FBIHQ had a Liaison Section
which maintained official liaison with the head-
quarters of other governmental departments and
agencies in Washington, D. C. The discontinuance
of that Liaison Section resulted in an attempt by
the Washington Field Office to handle many inquiries
of high-level officials of those departments and
agencies. It should be noted, of course, that this
office of necessity maintains liaison on a relatively
low level with all governmental departments and
agencies to insure the prompt referral of cases and
to handle matters pertaining to the effective
operation of this office in the District of Columbia.
I feel-that a reinstitution of the Liaison Section
in FBIHQ would place the high level jiaison with
other agencies at the headquarters level where it
would obviously be more effective. -

SUBJECT: LIAISON SECTION | 7 ‘ ALL INFORMATION CONTAIN!

- HEREIN) LASSIIED
¥ bare al ca By spain,

You requested my observations and ‘recommendations with regard
to the re-establishment of the Liaison Section,

The Liaison Section was broken up in July, 1970, and since that time
necessary and desirable liaison with other Federal agencies has been handled
by written communication as well as by direct contact with persons at various
levels at the Bureau with their counterparts in the other Federal agencies,
When the Liaison Section was discontinued it had grown too large and represented
awaste of manpower, 10 Agents, not including a Section Chief, were engaged
in handling domestic liaison with some 81 different agencies, many of which
obviously were of minor importance to our operations, Since that time necessary ~
liaison has not been handled as much by Washington Field Office as you indicated as
by supervisors and officials in FBIHQ, Washington Field Office's liaison with

swe other agencies relates almost entirely to the handling of leads and the Bureau's
\ routine business with those agencies.

| " Ibelieye we could more efficiently and effectively handle our business
with the other major Federal agencies if we re-established a Liaison Unit of limited
: size to handle only those agencies with which we have the greatest amount of traffic.
: I propose we have a five-man Unit under the Chief of the existing Special Coordination
,, Unit (L. F. Schwartz); :

SA Robert H. Haynes is currently in that Unit handling liaison with the
White House, the Vice President, and the N ational ae Compils To his

Memo for Mr, Kinley
Re: Liaison Section

SA B. C. Rachner currently in this Unit could handle liaison with:

Department of State ~ o.

Immigration and Naturalization Service

Treasury Department and related agencies with exception of
Secret Service

A 4th Agent could handle Central Intelligence Agency and related committees:

U. §. Intelligence Board

Signal Intelligence Committee

Security Committee

Watch Committee

Technical Surveillances Countermeasures
Interagency Defector Committee

A 5th Agent could handle:

National Secutity Agency
Atomic Energy Commission
U. S. Postal Service
Department of Transportation

Under the above proposed arrangement we would have five Agents handling
the major agencies with which we regularly need to resolve problems and handle
the greater Volume of our business «lating to other agencies, This Unit could be

effectively supervised bby its present Chief (Schwartz) and would function under
A, J. Decker, Jr, , Chief and G. A, Day, Number One Man of the Nationalities
Intelligence Section, Both Decker and Day are highly competent for this kind of
supervisimand administration, it being noted that Day is our top expert on liaison
matters, having served as Number One Man in the old Liaison Section, Two other
supervisors in the Unit (R. A. Bermingham and H, C, Flemister, Jr.) would
-/, ,continue to handle foreign liaison, to which they are presently assigned, including .
the supervision of Legat operations, A third Agent would need to be added for
supervision of: reign Liaison. to-replace’ Rachner ; -who is NOW engaged in these -

RECOMMENDATION:

: That the Special Coordination Unit be renamed Liaison Unit and organized
’’ along-the’ lines indicated above with Unit Chief Schwartz; 5 Agents handling domestic
Jiaison,.and.three Agents.to handle foreign. liaison, . If approved, ‘this would require.
the assignment of three additional Agents to this Unit,

LIAISON SECTION: -

: ¥ He ~.
This memorandum is in response tor, Gray's
comments concerning your memorandum to Mr. Kinley 6/30/72.
Mr. Gray asked for a review of current and past liaison
procedures.

The supervision of our foreign liaison representatives
was not affected by the conversion in 7/70 of the Liaison
Section to the Special Coordination Unit. That responsibility
continues to be handled in the Special Coordination Unit in
the same mahner as it was handled in the former Liaison Section.
This memorandum, therefore, is addressed to the question of
the Bureau's domesttic liaison anerations,

Former Liaison Section

The objective of the Liaison Section was, through
the development of high-level contacts in appropriate U. S.
agencies, to insure that the Bureau's business with those
agencies was accomplished promptly, effectively, economically,
and with a minimum of jurisdictional or policy problems,
By the establishpent of effective liaison contacts, we sought
to recognize and solve minor problems before they became
major problems requiring protracted and/expendive negotiatyons

Procedures under Liaison Section

their operations and established a close personal rapport with
high-level officials in those agencies, For exampl¢, in matters
of major importance the liaison Agent could make immediate :
personal contact with!Cabinet officers, directors of bureaus and
many other officials of the highest level. When our investiga

PoSaame tions required interviews of persons of this caliber, the inter-

“~- views would be handled by the liaison Agents in order that the

interviews could be accomplished without delay and with a
minimum of inconvenience to the official involved, Many of these
high-level contacts were the result of years of development by
the Bureau liaison representatives and through them we were able
to obtain assistance which might otherwise have been difficult

or impossible to obtain, Some examples of this type of support
are the following:

National Security Agency~One of the Bureau's
Secure telephone systems was provided and
installed by this Agency at no cost to the
Bureau, a savings of approximately $150,000,
Through*high-levol contacts in this Agency,
we have also been able to secure the results
of its technical research which might have
been difficult or expensive to obtain through
other sources,

Post Office-Our close association with the
Chief Postal Inspector and his top officials
A has resulted in that agency providing support
in soe of our most delicate intelligence
operations looking to the identification of
illegal hostile intelligence activities in
this country, -

State Department-In addition to providing
at no cost to the Bureau another secure :
. telephone network.and making available to.the °
Bureau worldwide cable facilities of the State
Department, our -high-level contacts in this.

the speedy resolution ‘of complicated- investigative

Memorandum E. S. Miller to Mr. Felt
Re; LIAISON SECTION

Military Agencies-The military intelligence
agencies have consistently provided excellent
support to the Bureau in both the security and.
criminal fields. Much of this is due to the
high-level liaison contacts developed over the
years with these agencies. In the Yablonsky
murder case, the military provided, on very
short notice at no cost to the Bureau, an
expert diving team which was able to Locate
one of the weapons involved which was an
essential piece of evidence in this crime.
Likewise, the military has been able to provide
a wealth of deceptive information to be used
in our double agent operations directed against
- Soviet-bloc intelligence agencies,

Immigration and Naturalization Service-
Through high-level contacts with this Service,
we have been able to arrange with a minimum of
complicated paper work the speedy deportation Tete
of persons entering the United States who are
considered to be threats to the internal security,
such as Arab terrorists sent to the United States
on assassination missions.

In many other instances, through close established
liaison, we were able to avoid the development of situations '
in other agencies which could have resulted in operational i
problems for the Bureau, Our liaison, for example, with the |
President's Commission on the Causes and Prevention of
Violence and the Commission on Civil Rights provided advance 4
_information concerning possible publications or statements soueea i
by those commissions which could have reflected adversely H
on the Bureau. |

Memorandum E. S. Miller to Mr. Felt
Re: LIAISON SECTION

Special Coordination Unit bg .

Objectives of the Special Coordination Unit, while
similar to those previously stated for the former Liaison
Section, are necessarily. less broad and are directed more
towards facilitating the resolution of problems raised by
other agencies than producing effective action by other
agencies on behalf of the FBI.

Procedures under Special Coordination Unit

Under the current setup, two Agents assigned to
the Special Coordination Unit are handling our domestic
liaison work. One of these is assigned to liaison with
The White House, the Vice President, and the National Security
Council. He is backed up by the other Agent who also attends
meetings of various intelligence committees and assists the
Unit Chief in handling inquiries from other agencies doing
business with the Bureau.

We have been able in our current system to carry
on an effective liaison operation primarily because of the
quality and number of high-level contacts which had been
developed under the previous Liaison Section system.
Although effective, this has really been a holding operation '
largely dependent upon the existing reservoir of well
developéd contacts. Due to transfers and retirements in
the most importast agencies with which we do business, our
established contacts have been deteriorating so that we
are approaching the point of diminishing returns. This

- situation could be reversed if we had sufficient man power .
to visit the more important agencies, renew old contacts and
establish new ones,

Re: LIAISON SECTION

Costs

In measuring the cost of a domestic liaisoy operation, i
the only measurable cost is the total salary for personnel
involved, Liaison Ageats are normally selected from among
Supervisors of GS-15 caliber ($25,583-$33,260); that is, men
who have the ability and experience required to handle a
Unit Chief's job or a job of similar responsibility. Based
on current median salaries, there is set out below a comparison
of the annual salary cost of the former Liaison Section and
the current Special Coordination Unit. In considering these
figures, it should be recognized that the Section Chief and
Number One Man in the former Liaison Section, and the Unit
Chief in the present Special Coordination Unit devoted only
part of their time to domestic liaison, and also supervised
the coordination of our offices abroad and the investigation
of the many "Foreign Police Cooperation" cases handled in
the United States in reciprocity for the work done for us
abroad, The former Liaison Section also handled other
matters, now absorbed elsewhere, such as emergency planning
and the Bureau's participation in the NATO Special Committee,

such as savings in reduced paper work, savings in man hours
of consultation, savings in the elimination of unnecessary
or duplicative investigative effort and, of overriding
importance, the increasing of our operational effectiveness
through the establishment of good will with other agencies.
These savings offset to a considerable degree the increased
salary expenditure.

Conclusion

Although we enjoy a strong operational relationship
with other agencies, including the intelligence agencies,
wherein in many instances we have face-to-face meetings at
the desk level with counterparts in other agencies, we
believe that from the overall standpoint the Bureau can
profit from the assignment of three additional Liaison Agents
to this work. We are not recommending that we enter into
liaison functions as broadly as we were engaged in the past
as we believe such an expenditure would not be justified,
What we are recommending is the assignment of one-half the
personnel which had previously been assigned to direct
liaison functions at less than one~half the previous cost.

ADDENDUM OF W. M. FELT

1-19-72

I recommend re-establishment of a Liaison Section on the

restricted basis outlined.above.

The Liaison Section should maintain

smooth and continuing contact with top officials in the intelligence com-

munity and related departments.

We would not change in any way very

effective liaison maintained by other divisions with Congress, Budget
Bureau, Civil Service Commission, Department of Transportation in

connection with hijackings and security matters, etc.

This action would

eliminate any remnants of criticism concerning our liaison. We would
set up strict guidelines and carefully select our personnel to insure that
we would get the type of liaison outlined above. We would guard.against
it becoming a mail courier operation.

I recommend the re-establishment of the Liaison Section

Mr. Gray's approval of the re-establishment of a liaison section
included an instruction that the section not supervise offices overseas and in
foreign countries. As this work is so basic to the responsibilities of a
liaison section, Iam respectfully presenting several points for Mr. Gray's
consideration in the hope that he will reconsider this prohibition.

T he Supervision of the foreign offices is handled by. pe ia

also visit other United States agencies while here, requiring coordination which
can best be arranged by a domestic liaison supervisor familiar with the
agency in question. In addition, some of the foreign agencies with which
our Legats are deeply involved maintain representatives in Washington.
These include RCMP,{MI-5, MI-6, and the Australian Security Intelligence
Organization.] These foreign representatives regularly visit the Bureau /S
to discuss thé various requirements which have been made of them by their
headquarters. The foreign liaison supervisors simply do not have the time
to handle these personé in‘addition to their regular work, and this responsibility , _
which for many years was handled in the front office of the former liaison section,
is.now temporarily heing handled in the front office of the section to which the = -
foreign liaison supervisors are attached. The processing of the requests made
by these men and the discussion of their problems with them is a matter of
basic liaison and should logically be handled by whoever will be in charge
“of the-néw liaison section. “Fhe courtesy and attention which is given to-

Memorandum E, S, Miller to Mr. W. M. Felt
Re: LIAISON SECTION

with other agencies is handled by domestic liaison supervisors dealing with
those agencies. In similar fashion the]British vill not furnish derogatory(S)
information directly to the Degartment of Defense in connection with its”
background-type investigations but require that such data be channeled
through FBI. These are just two of the instances in which a foreign liaison
-matter becomes a domestic liaison matter and should be under the same
supervision.

Our foreign offices are necessarily closely involved in the
operations of several U. 8. agencies and require domestic liaison with those
agencies. Our many problems surrounding the establishment and maintenance
of foreign offices have to be coordinated with the Department of State. It is
essential that we know and have access to the proper official at State in order
to solve problems faced by the Legats as without prodding State moves very
slowly. | Our foreign offices work closely with the Central Intelligence
Agency(CIA) stations abroad. CIA Headquarters does not permit its overseas
stations to disseminate information to other agencies overseas, including our
Legats, except in unusual circumstances. They frequently, however, suggest
to our Legats that CIA Headquarters be asked for particular items. These
can most rapidly be secured by direct request from a domestic liaison
supervisor.[ In a number of areas, our Legal Attaches work closely with (S
local representatives of the U. S. military. Leads are passed to our Legat
which are then followed up by liaison contacts in Washington with the appropriate
military headquarters.

Liaison, or, in éther terms, the establishment of a harmonious
relationship, is basically the same whether practiced in Washington or Tokyo.
I feel that it would be to the Bureau's advantage to have our liaison operations
closely coordinated and directly supervised in the same area. This has proved
to be an efficient and productive arrangement in the past, and we believe that }
the re-establishment of limited direct liaison in Washington should be hgndled L
by. the same supervision which. has been given to our posts abroad. -The-work in -: °. i

:"Dahiel M. Armstrong, i,

LIAISON SE oye

Since I think my recommendations to you may possibly be
the source of the confusion that appears to have resulted from your
order approving the reestablishment of the Liaison Section, this
memorandum is written in an effort to dispel the confusion.

When the recommendation was made to you to reestablish a
Liaison Section, I recommended you reestablish the Section but the Section
as reestablished should not operate in the same way as the old Liaison
Section had operated, according to my understanding. :

Specifically, { recummended that the reconstituted Se
have responsibility only over liaison with other agencies and shou.

mann

not

operat a1 ellive isicn (DID). I suggested that

the proper location within the Bureau for the new Section might be an
appropriate topic for discussion at an ExecutivesConference ‘meeting.

Supervision of foreign Legats, whick supervision had been
included among the responsibilities of the old Liaison Section, would,
under my proposat, continue to be handled within the DID and thus would
not be handled by the reconstituted Liaison Section.

Cee a eS

This recommendation was based on the assumption that the
foreign Legats have seen their responsibilities increased-in recent years
to include the collection of political intelligence information for dissemination

seemed a iate for them to be supervised t ty the FBI's intelligence

You ordered that the new Sectior net’ supervise offices overseas

.and in foreign countries. If this order was in any way based upon my

Your order reestablishing the Section appears to contemplate
that the new Section will operate out of the DID. If this is your intention,
then there is no reason why, in my opinion, the Section should not also be
permitted to supervise foreign Legats. The only reason for my recommen-
dation to you that the new Section not supervise foreign Legats was my
parallel recommendation that the new Section be located elsewhere than
the DID.

ous Liaison Section and has an unusually wide personal acquaintance
with both top and working level personnel in other U. S. agencies as
well as having represented the Bureau on several of the U. S. Intelli-
gence Board Committees. Prior to dissolution of the Liaison Section,
he was given a special citation by the U. S. Air Force in appreciation
for the liaison which he was then maintaining with that service,
Schwartz has recently been handling the numerous telephone calls from
other areas of the Executive Branch and has thereby continued his
relationship with other agencies. In addition to a highly successful
and productive career at Headquarters, Schwartz directly supervised

in the New York Office the then highly important investigation of the

Liaison Supervisor = Bernard ¢;-Rachner, GS-14: Will handle
liaison with State Department, Treasury (including Secret Service,
Internal Revenue, Customs, and Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms). In
the old Liaison Section, Rachner maintained liaison with State
Department and Secret Service, He enjoys a first-name relationship
with the Secret Service Director and has an encyclopedic knowledge
of State, including contacts at all levels. He is currently assigned
to the roreign Liaison Desk where many State Department officials
continue to telephone him to bring up matters of interest to the
Bureau. Prior to assignment at FBIHQ, he handled some of the most
sensitive and important investigations being conducted by WFO-in the
security field. j

Liaison Supervisor — John-Ev“Manning, GS-14: Will handle
liaison with Defense (including Army, Air Force, Navy, Marines, DSA,

I Manning is the only man, who did not serve'in the former Liaison Section,
Since its dissolution, however, he has worked with SA Schwartz in
handling the numerous telephone inquiries received from other agencies |

would be applicable here as each of the men recommended is of SIC
caliber and, in fact, most have already served in that position.
Further, liaison is not conducted inside the office and we believe

It should be observe at the newly constituted section
will not interfere with the specialized liaison currently maintained
by other divisions and will not attempt to handle liaison across the
board with all other departments and agencies in the Executive Branch,
but, rather, will concentrate on those agencies having the most mat-
ters of mutual interest with us and with which problems are. most apt

to arise. The earlier memorandum, which is attached, submitted con-
“ cerning this matter outlined this in some detail. Specific guidelines

ill be prepared and submitted for approval as soon as the new section
gets under way. = ._ i Pe. Fi SAPPY

In addition to the domestic liaison supervision, discussed
in detail above, the balance of the Section will, as approved by
Mr. Gray, be comprised of the present Foreign Liaison Desk consisting
of three Supervisors plus the necessary clerical personnel.. It is
recommended that SA Harvey C. Flemister, Jr., who was formerly the
SIC of the Foreign Liaison Unit in the discontinued Liaison Section
and who has acted as Senior Supervisor on the Foreign Liaison Desk
since that time, be again named as SIC of the Foreign Liaison Unit.
Flemister is well known and admired by the many contacts of our
foreign offices who visit Washington and he has a thorough knowledge
of foreign liaison matters.

It is observed that each of the men selected has had broad
experience in the security field and is currently assigned to the
Domestic Intelligence Division,.,.As an oyerwhelming. percentage. of,--.
the “ problems’ ‘fo be “resolved with other agencies are of a security

p Oripetent” to
deal with “the other matters of Bureat interest which are encountered
in connection, with both foreign and.domestic liaison.

suBJECT: PERSONNEL CHANGES :
You previously approved the establishment of a Liaison
Section and the purpose ‘of this memorandum therefore is to submit
the names of candidates to fill the position of Chief of this Section.

On 10-11-72 available members of the Personnel Selection
Board met in my office, consisting of myself and Messrs. .Walters, Miller,
Bishop, Callahan, Dalbey, Jenkins, Conrad, Baker and Bates. In view of
the pending transfers of SACs Kunkel and McDermott, I did not invite them
to attend the meeting; however, in the future I intend to utilize the services
of nearby SACs.

_ With the exception of Assistant Director Baker, all members
have recommended the following 3 employees and they are, in order of
preference, SA Graham A. Day, ASAC James J. Dunn, and SA Homer A.
Boynton. Mr. Baker recommended, in his order of preference, SA Boynton,
ASAC Dunn and SA Day.

1. SA Graham A. Day, No. 1 Man, Nationalities Intelligence Section, DID.
He entered on duty 1-4-43, is in Grade GS-15, age 60, married, 2 children.
He reported to DID 11-11-54, served as No., 1 Man of the former Liaison
Section from 3/61 until 7/70 when the section was disbanded and since 5/10/72 |
has served in his current position. Mr. Day's age, length of service at FBIHQ_
. were carefully considered during the meeting; nevertheless, with the exception
of Mr. Baker, the others present, including me, feel that Day is without a
doubt the most qualified employee to fill this particular position. He has had
vast experience in liaison work and even in his current position has-continued :
‘to-directly ‘supervise both domestic and foreign liaison functions. He has a

In line with the ‘pe-establighment of the Liaison
7 Section, as approved by Mr. Gray in my memorandiim of 10/19/72,
i -I am recommending that the 10 Supervisors assigned to this Section
t be given the title of Inspector with no change in pay for the
1 duration of their liaison assignment and be authorized to use
| u personal cards for official business as needed.

The men handling both our domestic and foreign liaison
contacts for the Bureau have been carefully selected on the basis
of their background and experience to effectively represent the
Bureau at the highest levels of important foreign and domestic
agencies. All of, these men will be meeting frequently with I Ss.
and foreign officials of the highest rank, which will include
Cabinet officers, Ambassadors and heads of important domestic and
foreign agencies.

In order to carry out their assignments in the most
effective manner, I believe that it is important that these men
be recognized as much as possible by the officials they are con-
tacting as key representatives of the FBI. This procedure has been
followed in the past with regard to the two Bureau representatives
handling our lifison with Congress ahd the American Bar Association,
both of whom carry the title of Inspector. This has been found
to be highly beneficial in assisting these individuals in fulfilling
their important liaison responsibilities and I feel it should be
equally helpful to the men of our new Liaison Section who have been
Selected to handle our domestic and foreign liaison assignments.

Memorandum E.S. Miller to W. M. Felt . :

Re: Liaison Section 4
7 : / ~
ADDENDUM ADMINISTRATIVE DIVISION 11/24/72

There are currently 36 Special Agents who have credentials with
title of Inspector. Most are Number One Men to Assistant Directors or to
Acting Associate Director or assigned to Inspection Division. About six or
seven carry the title of Inspector so as to give them stature as Bureau
representatives above the rank of Special Agent in keeping with their duties

. requiring them to represent the Bureau in significant contacts in the
Congressional, diplomatic, Government agency, business, and private sectors.
Although I feel the issuance of Inspector's credentials should be restricted as
much as possible, the duties of our liaison agents are such as to qualify them
for the temporary title of Inspector for the duration of their liaison assignment
and at no change in grade or salary. Upon reassignment from liaison duties
authority to carry Inspector's credentials should be automatically terminated.

| nw 68262 Docld:32989612 Page 337 |


e

11-27-72:

” ADDENDUM W.M, FELT.

I have carefully considered the information submitted by Domestic
Intelligence and Administratiye Divisions as to the conferring of the title
Inspector on the 10 supervisors currently assigned to the Liaison Section.
However, I do not feel that the best interests of the Bureau will be served
in the long run by taking favorable action. Iam convinced that to accede
to this request would result in similar requests from other divisions, many
of which would appear to be as justified as the issue currently in hand.

In the long run therefore, we would, in a sense, be lessening the importance
of the Inspector's title in the Bureau,

Moreover, I can also foresee problems in reassigning a man from
such duties and removing the Inspector's title from him. Such action would
be in the form of a demotion in accordance with the Veterans' Preference
Act which specifically states 30 days advance written notice must be furnished
to an employee if he is reduced in grade, salary or rank. If we were to
advise an employee that this title was temporary and would be in effect only
for the duration of his current assignment we would still have to abide by the
law in giving the employee 30 days' advance written notice. Therefore, in
considering all ramifications of this matter, approval is not given to the
recommendation.
