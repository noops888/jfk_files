Re San Francisco radiogram and teletype to the

Director, captioned matter, 10/27/61.

On 11/1/61, retired San Diego Police Department

Detective LEE GRADY,

a reliable San Diego source who is

personally acquainted with SALVATORE BOMPENSIERO, aka Sam

Bompensiero, advised that he' had received reliable information

that BOMPENSIERO was in San Francisco on 10/14 and 15/61.

He stated that BOMPENSIERO was in San Diego and was seen

daily at his downtown San Diego bars during the balance of

the month of October.

GRADY stated that he did not know the

purpose of BOMPENSIERO's trip to San Francisco, but in the

past BOMPENSIERO has made frequent trips there

to visit

friends and his attorney while his brother FRANK BOMPENSIERO

was in California State Penitentiary.

FRANK has since been

released and is on parole in San Diego.

GRADY has in the past been contacted on frequent

occasions concerning the whereabouts of local San Diego

hoodlums including the BOMPENSIERO brothers and he was furnished

no reason for the Bureau inquiry in this instance and no

information whatsoever has been disseminated which could

possibly prejudice informant in this case.
