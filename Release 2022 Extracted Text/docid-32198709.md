DECLASSIFY ON:

respond to any requests from the SSC covering these matters until the

briefing had been given. The goal of the briefing was to confine knowl-

edge of these matters to Senators Church and Tower and avoid prolif-

eration of this information throughout the SSC Staff. In view of this, it

is recommended that the enclosed material not be made available to the

SSC Staff until it is discussed with the White House, I further urge that

it be made clear to the White House that, if this material is to be made

available to the ssc, access to the enclosed material be linited to

Senators Church, Fower, and SSC Staif Director William Miller only.
