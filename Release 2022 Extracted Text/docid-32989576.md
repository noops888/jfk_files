Dear Mike:

One of the subjects which the Committee will be address-

ing in preparing its legislative recommendations involves

the adequacy of the FBI's inspection procedures for handling

allegations of misconduct and abuse.

In this regard we are

forwarding herewith a list of several such allegations which

have been made during the past few years and concerning each

of which we would appreciate your supplying us with the

following information:

1. How did FBI Headquarters first become aware of

the allegation?

2.

Was an investigation or inspection conducted?

If not, was any other action taken?

3.

How was the decision made to conduct (or.not to

conduct) an inspection or investigation, or to take

(or not to take) other action?

4.

Which Division, or operating level (headquarters

or field), conducted the inspection or investigation?

5.

How was the decision made as to which Division or

operating level was to conduct the inspection or

investigation?

6.

Was the original allegation reported to the Attorney

General or any other Department of Justice official?

Were the results of the inspection or investi-

gation reported to the Attorney General or any

other Department of Justice official?

Was prosecution or administrative action (e.g.r

suspension or dismissal) considered or taken?

If any of the allegations on the attached list

were made today, would they be handled by the

newly-created office of Professional Responsibility?

In what manner would they be handled? If an investi-

gation were deemed warranted, which agency's personnel

would do the investigating. In this regard, please

also advise concerning. which agency's personnel will

be investigating recently-reported allegations that

agents of the FBI "attempted to coerce" a

which stated that a man would be in a cer-

tain telephone booth in Rockville, Maryland,

on March 14, 1962, between 8:15 p.M. and

8:45 p.M.

According to the note this man

should be followed to find out who was

selling FBI reports to foreign officials.

If not, wag any other

An investigation was immediately

3.

How was the decision made to conduct (or

not to conduct) an inspection or investi-

gation, or to take (or not to take) other

action?

The letter upon its receipt in the Bureau

was

referred to Intelligence Division (then

Domestic Intelligence Division): Special

Agent Richard D. Cotter, Number One Man to

Section Chief W. R. Wannall, Nationalities

Intelligence Section, acting for Assistant

Director William C. Sullivan, made the deter-

mination to conduct active investigation.

Special Agent. Cotter prepared a memorandum.

from Mr. W. R. Wannall to Mr. W. C. Sullivan

dated March 14, 1962, advising of the receipt

the letter containing the allegation and

setting forth his instructions to the Field

for active investigation. This memorandum

was approved by then Director J. Edgar Hoover:

The investigation was öriginaily conducted

by the Baltimore Field Office with subsequent

investigation being conducted by the Washington

Re: U. S. Senate Select Committee

Since this was an investigative matter

in the intelligence field, it was the

decision of the Intelligence Division that

it should be handled by the Baltimore Field

office, in whose territory the phone booth

was located.

6.- Was the original allegation reported to the

Attorney General: 0r

any other Department of

Justice official?

A review of Bureau files does not indicate

that the original allegation was ever reported

to the Attorney General or to any other Depart-

ment of Justice official.

Were the results of the inspection of

investigation reported to the Attorney General

or any other Department of Justice official?

A letter classified "Secret" was furnished to

the Attorney General on August 6, 1975, concerning

this matter. Delivered with this memorandum is

the backup documentation.

8..

NO.

Inasmuch as investigation was unable to

substantiate the allegation that a Bureau Agent

was furnishing information to the Soviets, no

administrative action was taken in connection

with the allegation.

However, a suspected

Special Agent was censured for an unrelated

violation of Bureau regulatione as a result of

our investigation.

conduct) an inspection or investigation, or to take

(or not to take) other action?

4.

Which Division, or operating level (headquarters

or field), conducted the inspection or investigation?

5. How was the decision made as to which Division or

RESPECT TO INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

RE: ALLEGATION NUMBER FOUR

Reference is made to SSC letter dated January 8, 1976,

asking for FBI responses to eight questions concerning each of five

allegations of FBI misconduet and abuse. In modification of the SSC

letter, Mr. John T. Elliff, SSC Domestie Intelligence Tasks Force

Director, advised Mr. W. O. Cregar of this Bureau on January 12,

1976, that the purpose of this inquiry is to learn what information is

provided to the Attorney General consistent with his oversight

responsibilities once an allegation surfaces in the media.

The following response concerns Allegation Four, which reads:

"The March 29, 1975, edition of 'The Washington Post' reported

allegations that an FBI Agent had been 'bribed' by a member

of the Mafia. "

The response below is in the order and by numerical designa-

tion corresponding to the questions raised.

FBI Headquarters was advised on February 10, 1973,

by the New York Office of the FBI.

2. Was an investigation or inspection conducted? If not,

was any other action taken?

Yes, a personnel matter investigation was instituted on

February 8, 1973.

3. How was the decision made to conduct (or not to conduct)

an inspection or investigation, or to take (or not to take) other action?

It has always been the operating procedure of the FBI to

immediately institute appropriate inquiry into any allegation made

concerning FBI personnel.

4. Which Division or operating level (headquarters or field)

conducted the inspection or investigation?

The New York office of the FBI and the FBI Headquarters"

Inspection Division conducted the investigation.

5. How was the decision made as to which Division or

Upon the recommendation of the Assistant Director in Charge

of the New York office of the FBI, that office conducted an in depth

investigation into the allegation. In August, 1973, after receipt of

information which added a new dimension to the matter, the Director

of the FBI instructed that the Inspection Division conduct all additional

inquiry.

G. Was the original allegation reported to the Attorney General

or any other Department of Justice official?

Yes, by letter to the Deputy Attorney General dated June 19,

1073, captioned "John Caputo - Results of Inquiry Concerning Alleged

Bribery of FBI Agent in Anti-Racketeering Matter'' and by letter to

the Attorney General, with a copy to the Deputy Attorney General, dated

July 25, 1973, bearing the same caption.

7. Were the results of the inspection or investigation reported

to the Attorney General or any other Department of Justice official?

Yes, a report dated July 25, 1913, cantioned "John Caputo;

Eugene Statile; Bribery, " was furnished to the Organized Crime and

Racketeering Section of the Department of Justice on September 12g

1973. A report in the matter captioned "John A. Caputo, It Al.,

Eribery, Perjury, " dated May 23, 1975, was furnished to the

Attorney General by letter dated June 4, 1975. Being delivered with

this memorandum is a copy of that report together with a copy of the

June 4, 1975, letter to the Attorney General.

8. Was prosecution or administrative action (e.g., suspension

or dismissal) considered or taken?

No prosecutive action was taken against FBI personnel inasmuch

as no information was developed which would in any way corrokorate

the allegation. It should be noted that John Caputo is currently awaiting

trial in United States District Court, Lastern District of New York, on

perjury charges relating to the bribery allegations.

Although the extensive investigation did not establish any evidence

of dishonesty on the part of FBI personnel in connection with the allegation,

it was determined that three Agents had been derelict with respect to

longstanding administrative policies of the FBI. As a result, two of the

Agents were censured and transferred and the third Agent was censured,

placed on probation, transferred, and suspended for five days without pay.

U. S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE TO

STUDY GOVERNMENTAL OPERATIONS WITH

RESPECT TO INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

RE: ALLEGATION NUMBER 5

Reference is made to SSC letter dated January 8, 1976, asking

for FBI responses to eight questions concerning each of five allegations

of FBI misconduct and abuse. In modification of the SSC letter, Mr. John

T. Elliff, SSC Domestic Intelligence Task Force Director, advised Mr.

W. O. Cregar of this Bureau on January 12, 1976, that the purpose of

this inquiry is to learn what information is provided to the Attorney General

consistent with his oversight responsibilities once an allegation surfaces

in the media.

The following response concerns Allegation Number 5 which reads:

A recent edition of Time Magazine reported that "sensitive"

FBI documents "were carried off in an FBI truck to West

Virginia's Blue Mountain Ridge Club, a Shenandoah Mountain

Hideaway used by innermost FBI officials for regular poker

games with CIA and other cronies. The papers were burned

in the Club's large fireplace."

The response below is in the order and by numerical designation

corresponding to the questions raised.

"Before Secretary Gandy could look at them in hoover's

house, the most sensitive papers were carried off in an FBI

truck to West Virginia's Blue fidge Club, a Shenandoah Mountain

hideaway used by innermost FBI officials for regular poker games

with CIA and other cronies. There the papers were burned in

the club's large fireplace. Precisely who ordered this destruc-

tion and carried it out has not been disclosed. The three-story

clubs, valued at up to $200, 000, burned to the ground in a fire

of undetermined cause on Nov. 23. No evidence of arson has

been discovered. "

2, Was an investigation or inspection conducted? If not, was

any other action taisen?

An investigation was conducted on December 16 and 17, 1975.

3. Eow was the decision made to conduct (or not to conduct)

an inspection or investigation, or to take (or not to take) other action?

Based on an inquiry concucted by the Inspection Division in January,

1975, inquiring into the "Official and Confidential" files of former Directos

J. Edgar Hoover and subsequent inquiries made by the Inspection Division

concerning these papers, this Time Magazine article set forth an allegation

which had not previously come to the attention of the FBI. Accordingly,

inquiry was made concerning this allegation in order to advise both the

Director of the FBI and the Attorney General as to whether there was any

validity to the allegation.

5. How was the decision made as to which Division or operating

level was to conduct the inspection or investigation?

An article appeared in the January 19, 1975, issue of The Washington

Fost which in part stated the FBI "during J. Edgar Hoover's reign" compiled

files containing information on the personal lives of senators and congressmen.

U. S. Senate Select Committee to

Study Governmental Operations with

Respect to Intelligence Activities (SSC)

On January 21, 1975, FBI Director Kelley instructed the Inspection Division

to conduct inquiry concerning the "Official and Confidential" files of Nir.

Loover. The results of that inquiry were submitted to the Attorney General

by memorandum dated February 11, 1975.

The allegation set forth in the Time Magazine article dated

December 15, 1975, and the reference to "sensitive papers" being taken

from Mir. Hoover's house appeared to be alluding to Mir. Hoover's "Official

and Confidential' files. The Inspection Division, having previously been

charged with responsibility of conducting inquiry concerning these particular

files, initiated action on its own to resolve this latest allegation.

6. Was the original allegation reported to the Attorney General

or any other Department of Justice official?

Yes, by letter to the Attorney General dated December 24, 1975.

Delivered with this memorandura is the back-up documentation.

7. Were the resuits of the inspection or investigation reported

to the Attorney General or any other Department of Justice official?

Yes. Eee response to question number 0 above.

8. Was prosecution or administrative action (e.E., suspension

or dismissal) considered or taken?

The inquiry failed to develop evidence in support of the allegation

concerning the alleged transportation and destruction of "sensitive papers."

Accordingly, no further action was warranted.

NOTE: A copy of referenced letter is attached to yellow of instant LHM.

Material being supplied to the SSC will be delivered with this LHM by Legal

Counsel Division. A set of such material is being retained by the Senstudy

75 Project.

The Attorney General

Investigation was conducted by the fBI concerning this

particular allegation appearing in Time magazine.

On December 16, 1975, Mrs. Hulda Weese, Route 9, Sweet

Springs Community, Loudoun County, Virginia, was interviewed at her

residence and advised she had been the caretaker and cook at the Blue

Ridge Rod and Gun Club located in Loudoun County, Virginia, since

April 8, 1971. She stated that on that date she and her family moved

into the residence at the club and she resided continuously at that location

until November 23, 1975, when the club was destroyed by fire.

Mrs. Weese was questioned concerning the allegation appearing

in the above-cited Time magazine article to the effect that an FBI truck

had delivered certain records to the club which were then destroyed in.

the club's fireplace..

Mrs. Weese stated that it would have been virtually

impossible for anyone to have destroyed records in any of the three fire-

places of the club without her knowledge because she and her family resided

at the club on a continuous basis since April, 1971. She also advised she

was the only one who had keys to the front and back doors of the clubhouse

and pointed out that as caretaker one of her responsibilities was to insure

that only members or guests accompanied by members were allowed

admittance to the clubhouse. Mrs. Weese stated that there was an iron

fence

located across the driveway approximately 60 yards from the club-

house which was kept locked at all times except when members were present

at the club. Mrs. Weese also commented that she had four watchdogs at

the club who were very alert for the presence of strangers or in fact any-

one. She advised that one of her responsibilities was to keep the fireplaces

clean at the clubhouse which she did and at no time did she observe any-

thing in the fireplaces indicating that any records had been destroyed.

Mrs. Weese stated emphatically that at no time did anyone come to the

club and burn records in the fireplaces or anywhere else.

Concerning the fire at the club on November 23. 1975.

Mrs. Weese stated she had left the club for a short period of time to per-

form an errand and left behind her son and some of her friends at the club-

house. She related that at approsimately 4:00 p.m. her son observed

smoke coming from the attic of the club around the windous and chimney

and her son alerted the other occupants of the clubhouse as well as the

local fire department. She stated that a number of tire departmonts

responded to the lire but were unable to extinguish the fire with any degree

of success. She continued that a fire marshal, one Oliver Dube, was

present on the scene and when she questioned him as to the cause of the

fire he advised that it had apparently been an accident and was probably

caused by defective electrical wiring in the building.

On December 16, 1975, Oliver R. Dube, Fire Marshal,

Loudoun County Fire and Rescue Service, Leesburg, Virginia, was inter-

viewed concerning this particular fire and stated he responded to the scene

within one hour of its having started, had examined the ruins, and had

come to the conclusion the fire was of "accidental origin." Mr. Dube

advised that his investigation had not been concluded as yet but felt sure

the fire started because of defective electrical wiring in an area near

the ceiling level of the first floor. He volunteered he did not observe

anything at the scene or find any evidence indicating the fire was caused

by arson.

On December 17, 1975, Mr. John P. Mohr, former Assistant

to the Director, FBI (now retired), advised in response to our request for

an interview with him concerning the allegation in this matter that he had

already testified with regard to the disposal of Mr. Hoover's papers

before the Subcommittee, headed by Chairperson Bella Abzug, and thought

that his testimony in this regard should suffice. Mr. Mohr further advised

that he had contacted his attorney, Mr. Brian Gettings, who is representing

him in connection with matters relating to the FBI involving U. S. Recording

Company and Mr. Hoover's files, and his attorney had counseled him not

to be interviewed in connection therewith. In proffering his declination to

be interviewed in this regard, Mr. Mohr orally advised that he had nothing

whatsoever to do with taking any fies as alleged and was highly incensed

that such an allegation should be made.

Concerning the above information, I wish to refer to my memo-

randum to you captioned "John P. Mohr, former Assistant to the Director, "

dated December 22, 1975, wherein I furnished you with results of a dis-

cussion I had with Sandy Smith of Time magazine on December 19. 1975.

In my memorandum I pointed out under item 4 that Smith made reference

to the "Blue Ridge Club" and Smith's feeling that this club was the place

where Mr. Hoover's records were burned shortly aiter Mr. Hoover's

death.

BRIBERY; PERJURY

Investigation conducted based on hearsay allegations

suggesting possible corrupt activity in violation of the

Bribery Statute on the part of (SA JOSEPH STABILE)or an

unidentified Federal Law Enforcement Officer, referred to

variously as "JOE STOPPS", "JOE STUBBS" or "THE FED"

and a person referred to as "STEVE ADAMS". The hearsay

allegations were made by GUILLERMO SOWERS who is in

protective custody of the Kings County Prosecutor's

Office, Brooklyn, NY, as a material witness to the killing

Of JAMES NAGI 6/17/74.

Background data relative to SOWERS,

including results of polygraph examination given him by

Kings County District Attorney's Office, set out. In

NAGI's wife, girlfriend, brother, sister, parole officer,

criminal associates and law enforcement contacts, including

FBI, NYCPD and NADJARI Commission, failed to corroborate

SOWERS' hearsay allegations regarding(STABILEJor STEVE

ADAMS; Interviews disclosed NAGI known as FBI, police

and NADJARI Commission informant at various times in his

criminal career.

During 1970 and 1971, NAGI was productive.

FBI informant assigned to SA JOHN GOOD. SA GOOD has no

reason to believe NAGI was ever in contact with(SA STABILE.)

Miscellaneous personal records of JAMES NAGI, including

address books and notations of names and phone numbers were

reviewed and nothing identifiable with JOSEPH STABILE, py

name, telephone number, residences and/or confidential

Synopsis (cont'd)

SCARPA, CHARLES PANARELLA, GEORGE and WHITEY

TROPIANO and non-ICN member WILLIAM CUTOLO have

not been corroborated in any manner.

At time

GENTILE was alleged to have a corrupt association

with(SA STABILE,) FBI's New York Office, in 1972,

had GENTILE extensively covered with Title III

wiretap and microphone surveillances, which

produced extensive evidentiary material against

GENTILE and his associates.

(SA STABILE was

privy to GENTILE investigation which include

highly successful electronic surveillance coverage

Of GENTILE's residence from 9/19 to 10/19/72.

Written record regarding fatal flaw which scuttled

the GENTILE prosecutive case clearly does not

attach culpability to (SA STABILE)in any manner.

Reason why prosecution of US Secret Service case

against PAUL DE PALO, CUTOLO's brother-in-law, has

not moved forward is clearly out of scope of SA

STABILE's sphere of influence. There is no employee

named "ADAMS" currently working in NY FBI Office.

DETAILS

On April 15,1975, GUILLERMO SOWERS, also known

"as PETE®

SOWERS, was interviewed by SA FORD w. COLE, at which time .

he furnished the following information in part:

SOWERS said that one of the reasons that JAMES

NAGI was killed was due to the fact it was believed NAGI was talking

to the police.

SOWERS said that he heard from TROPIANO and CUTOLO

that. NAGI was aware of the existence of other "connections" the mob

had within law enforcement.

One such individual was a JOE STUBS" or "STOPS",

an FBI agent in New York. JOE "STOPS" reportedly had provided

information to organized crime people regarding impending gambling

indictments came out.

SOWERS

learned of the existence of JOE "STOPS" sometime in 1972.

Later, in

1973, when NAGI was still an accepted associate, he was having a

problem in a Federal hijacking matter. CUTOLO and SOWERS were dis~

cussing this at a restaurant in Brooklyn. SOWERS stated, "Why don't

you see what JoE

• "STOPS' can do?"

CUTOLO responded that

JOE "STOPS"

was not longer able to help, as he has been sent to Massachusetts.

JOE "STOPS", according to SOWERS, was not the type

who was available to "nothing guys", but was contacted by the "big

guys", like CHARLIE PANARELLA from Staten Island. Another individual,

supposedly in the FBI, who SOWERS was told was proving information

was someone named "ADAMS". He heard of this individual in February,

1974.

One of the reasons SOWERS became an informant was that he

feared performing a hit on NICKY "BOOTS" CAPUTO for TROPIANO and

CUTOLO.

Date of transcription.

May 5, 1975

Mr. Guillermo Sowers, also known as Pete and Bill, was inter-

viewed on the premises of Borough Hall, Brooklyn, New York. Prior to

the interview he was placed under oath and he furnished the following state-

ment:

"April 30, 1975

Brooklyn, N.Y.

"I, Guillermo Sowers, being duly sworn, hereby make the

following free and voluntary statement to Clark Brown and Edward D.

Hegarty who have identified themselves to me as employees of the Federal

Bureau of Investigation and have advised me the purpose of the interview

is to obtain from me any information I may possess regarding improper

activities of employees of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

"I was born Jan. 20, 1943 at Havana, Cuba.

"I have never offered a bribe for any reason whatsoever to any

employee of the F.B.I. I have never directly received any information of

any type from an employee of the FBI. At no time did anyone ever tell

me that they had offered a bribe to an employee of the FBI or had ever

received confidential information from an employee of the FBI.

I recall having a conversation during the early summer of 1972

with George Tropiano, William Cutolo and James Nagi regarding a

problem Nagi was having with law enforcement in New Jersey regarding

• a hijacking or a kidnapping or possession of a shotgun or some other

crime. Cutolo asked Tropiano about 'Joe Staps or Stubbs' Tropiano left

to make a telephone call. When Tropiano returned he told Nagi he would

try to help him out. On the following day Cutolo, in my presence, gave

Nagi a piece of paper which bore the name, as 1 now recall, Joseph

Stambile' or 'Joseph Stabile) or something

like that. The piece of paper

also bore a telephone number. Cutolo told Nagi to call this person and

make an appointment to discuss his, Nagi's problem. Cutolo told Nagi

it would cost him, Nagi, a few dollars. I don't think Tropiano was present

on this second occasion. I think both of these conversations took place at

'Burger Prince,' a restaurant at 65th and 8th Ave., Brooklyn, N. Y., during

the early afternoon. Cutolo was anxious to help Nagi because Nagi had just

Completed a $22, 000. 00 score for Cutolo and Tropiano. The score was an

armed robbery of the Co-Op Supermarket, Bronx;

; N.Y., in May 1972. On

the first occasion Cutolo described 'Joe Stubbs' as a Federal Agent.

"Subsequent to the above two occasions I was involved with Cutolo,.

Tropiano and six or seven other persons including Andy Carlisi, Anthony

Villaroll and Greg who was a fence at 76th St and 13th Ave. in Brooklyn,

a little discount store. Greg was a white male ,about late 30's or 40's,

5'8"~10", Italian background. Mario Tropiano was also involved; 'The

Greek' who was arrested for shooting someone at Tiffany's Diner about

two or 3 years ago; 'The Greek's: brother who is a foreman at a downtown

pier. This group was active in hijacking during the summer of 1972 in the

area of 39th St. and 2nd Ave., Brooklyn, N. Y.; JFK Airport; and 'Greenpoint'

a trucking terminal in Brooklyn, N. Y.; and at Cooper and Jarrett (phonetic)

in New Jersey. Cutolo furnished me a handwritten list of New York State

license tags, cars and two trucks or 5 cars and two trucks, and told me

to watch for them because they were being used by The Feds.: The list

included the type of car, color and license tag number. The cars were

Plymouth, Ford and Does. One of the trucks was a former telephone

repair panel truck painted black. The second truck was a three-quarter

panel truck which bore the name 'Emery Air Freight' and was painted white

with blue lettering.

"On several occasions I spotted several of the cars at the piers,

39th St. and 2nd Avenue area when I was planning a hijacking. Villaroll,

Nagi, Carlisi and some of the others also spotted some of these cars when

they were with me. I never saw these cars at JFK Airport. I never saw

the black panel truck. About 25 or 30 times during the summer of 1972 I

saw the Emery Air Freight truck at JFK Airport, air freight section, the

area of 39th and 2nd Avenue, Brooklyn and around the Burger Prince

Restaurant. Every time I saw the truck there were 2 guys in it; always

the same two. One of these two was about 5' 10", 200 pounds, late 30's

or 40's, brown hair, Irish appearance, the second guy was white male

also and he was in his mid-thirties, 5' 8", 160 pounds.

"When Cutolo gave me the list of vehicles he told me that he got

it from 'his friend, the Fed.' I think Villaroll, Nagi, Carlisi and some of

the others involved in the actual hijackings saw Cutolo give the list to me

at the Burger Prince.

"Around April or May or sometime in the first half of 1974 I had

a conversation with Cutolo and I think, but am uncertain, that George

Tropiano was also present. On this occasion Cutolo said that his 'connection'

and by 'connection' I bélieve he was refering to 'Joe Stubbs' was originally

"Joe Gentile's also known as 'Joe Lane's' connection. On other occasions

during 1974 Cutolo told me that 'Colombo' had received information regarding

an indictment of Colombo before the indictment was returned. Cutolo

indicated that he, Cutolo, obtained this information from 'The Fed' and

passed it on to Colombo.

"On Saturday June 15, 1974, George Tropiano, Cutolo and I had

a conversation at Burger Prince. Tropiano said that he had received a

telephone call that Nagi was either cooperating with or was going to

cooperate with the Nadjari Commission and that we would have to kill Nagi

within the next two days. On June 17, 1974 Nagi was murdered. About a

month later Cutolo told me that he either called 'Joe' who was 'in Boston'

or he was going to call 'Joe and tell him that he, Cutolo, 'took care of the

problem' and that he, Cutolo was going to see him. Cutolo also said that

'Foe" was no longer in town and was then in 'Massachuselts.'

*I recall that in about May of 197 James Nagi and I had a con-

versation in a corridor of the Bronx Court House, 161st Street and Grand

Concourse. Nagi was planning a shakedown of someone whom he did not

name. Nagi wanted 'silencers' some 'badges' that I previously had in my

possession. Two of these badges were FBI badges and two New York City

Police Department Detective Shields. I had obtained these 4 badges from

Cutolo who obtained them from George Tropiano, according to Cutolo. •

Linda Nagi, Wife of James Nagi, was present and she might have overheard

the conversation. James Nagi said when I told him I didn't have the badges

any longer, that he would have to see 'Joe' and would have to 'go out of

town."' Linda Nagi is a white female, mid 20's, 5' 8",

, wears glasses and

operates a beauty salon around Lucas and Clifton Streets, Brooklyn, N. Y.

Nagi and Nicky 'Boots' Caputo wanted the silencers for purpose of using

them to kill George Tropiano.

"Other than Cutolo, George Tropiano and James Nagi no one

else: has discussed 'Joe Stapps' with me.

"I recall during a conversation I had with Cutolo during 1974 that

he said Joe Stapps was receiving $1000. 00 a month for information he was

providing to Cutolo and others. Cutolo also told me that 'Joe Stapps' was

either working for or was going to work for 'Whitey' Tropiano's men.

Cutolo also told me that his brother-in-law Paul De Paola (phonetic) was

having a problem with, Denis Dillon, Federal Strike Force, and that his

friend 'The Fed' was giving him information regarding this matter. I

learned of the De Paola matter in 1974 but the actual interest of Dillon

in De Paola was before 1974." Signed'Guillermo Sowers."

• In addition to the above information Sowers said he was associated

with George Tropiano and William Cutolo during the period of April, 1972,

until September, 1972, and from January, 1974, -to November, 1974.

A spread of eleven photographs including that of SA Joseph Stabile)

was Shown to Mr. Sowers. He did not identify any of the photos.

A second spread of nine photographs was shown to Mr. Sowers.

He identified photos of William Cutolo ana George Tropiano.

Mr. Sowers advised that his correct date of birth is January 20,

1943, rather than 1942. He is married to Louise Scavone, 514 Ocean

Parkway; Brooklyn, New York, and has one child. At present he is in

protective custody as a materiai witness io the murder vi Jaines Nagi,

June 17, 1974..

Prior to custody he resided at 275 Webster Avenue,

York,

The interview began at 10:39 a.m.; he was placed under oath at

•10:44 a.m. He signed the statement at 3:43 p.m., and the interview was

FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

Date of transcription_ 5/16/75

MI. GUILLERMO SOWERS

was interviewed at the New York Office

of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, 201 East 69th Street,

New York, N. Y. 10022. At the outset of the interview, both

Sgecial Agent Pearce and Special Agent Rohr identified themselves

as Special Agents of the FBI.

Then Special Agent Pearce advised

SOWERS that the purpose of the interview was to question him in

detail about any knowledge that he may have regarding any member

of the Federal law enforcement establishment being connected

with any criminal group operating in the City of New York. Mr.

SOWERS then furnished the information set out below:

SOWERS was born in Havana, Cuba, leaving there for the

• United States in 1959 in order to take up permanent residence in

• Miami; Florida. In 1961, he joined the U. S. Marine Corps

and

was discharged honorably on November 16, 1963.

From his

last duty station in Quantico, Va., he returned to Miami, where

he remained for several years working in various supermarkets.

In 1967, he left Miami and went to New York City. There he again

began working at various jobs and different supermarkets.

197 1

• while he was so employed he met an Associated Foods

trück driver named ANDY CARLISI. CARLISI and

• SOWERS soon worked

out a scheme whereby they would leave a certain number of cases

containing groceries un CARnISI's truck at the time of delivery:

CARLISI then sold these cases and divided the profit with

SOWERS. In addition to this scheme, SOWERS and CARLISI had

method whereby they were able to defraud the off-track betting

company for several thousand dollars every week.

At some point during their association, CARLISI told SOWERS

about his friends BILLY CUTOLO and GEORGE TROPIANO, Who CARLISI

described as members of the COLOMBO "family" of La

Cosa Nostra (LCN).

•In early April CARLISI arranged to introdúce SOWERS to WILLIAM CUTOLO.

The introduction was made at the cocktail lounge of the Leader

Bowling Alley on Coney Island Avenue and 18th Street, Brooklyn, N.Y.

Present at this meeting were WILLIAM CUTOLO, ANDY CARLISI and

SOWERS.

Also in the lounge, but not participating in the meeting, were

three other people identified to SOWERS as JIM NAGI, ANTHONY

VILLEROEL and NAGI's girlfriend. At this time, SOWERS was employed

as the manager of a supermarket in Coop-City, Bronx, New York.

CUTOLO proposed that SOWERS provide him with enough information

of the operation at this store so one of CUTOLO's men could hold up

the cashier when there was a large quantity of money in the

cashier's office.

SOWERS provided CUTOLO with the necessary

information and

then demanded to be given $10,000.00 in advance

for any cooperation in the planned holdup. At one of more meetings

held after tis one, SOWERS was introduced to CUTOLO's boss

GEORGE TROPIANO.

This meeting took place at the Burger Prince

located on 65th and 8th Avenue,. Brooklyn, New York.

On none

of these meetings was the holdup and SOWERS demand for $10,000

discussed. On April 19, 1972, JIM NAGI and ANDY VILLEROEL held up

the supermarket where SOWERS was working and escaped with over

• $20,000.00.

Subsequent to this holdup SOWERS went to the Burger Prince

at 65th and 8th Avenue, Brooklyn; N.Y., and demanded his share

of the holdup from GEORGE TROPIANO.

TROPIANO told him that

the money had already been split and that there was nothing left

for him. TROPIANO did extend an invitation to SOWERS that he

join his group and participate in further jobs with them.

SOWERS had been fired by the supermarket and was now unemployed

he agreed to join TROPIANo's group.

Shortly after this meeting, SOWERS also learned that NAGI

had only turned $16,000.00 of the money robbed from the super-

market over to CUTOLO, and TROPIANO. Out of this $16, 000.00, NAGI

was given a cut of $2,500.00. SOWERS did not know if either

CUTOLO Or TROPIANO were aware that NAGI and VILLEROEL had held

out about $5,000.00 on them. .

At the time that SOWERS joined the TROPIANO grOUp he impersonated

PETE CATENA, nephew of GERRY CATENA, an LCN leader.

CUTOLO

and TROPIANO made inquiries about him and then accepted him

in their group.

This took place sometime in early June 1972.

After SOWERS had been accepted in the group, NAGI, CUTOLO and

TROPIANO and SOWERS were standing outside the Burger Prince,

when NAGI began complaining about a problem he was having with

the law in New Jersey. • NAGI said that the problem arose out of

an arrest some time ago for hijacking, robbery and possession of

a weapon. NAGI aSKed CUTOLO and TROPIANO 1I they coula do

• something for him in this matter. Specifically, NAGI wanted to

know what was going on in the case.

CUTOLO turned to TROPIANO

and asked him, "What about our friend? You know Joe, the Fed.

Maybe he can help". TROPIANO told CUTOLO that he would see what

he could do and then went into the Burger Prince to use the

public telephone located there. CUTOLO, NAGI and SOWERS also

went into the Burger Prince.

CUTOLO went behind the service counter

while NAGI and SOWERS remained on the other side.

## Page 88

After TROPIANO finished his telephone call, he had a short private

conversation with CUTOLO and then went outside.

CUTOLO came back to

where NAGI and SOWERS were standing and took out his wallet. from

the wallet he removed a small card, about the size of a regular

business card. Then he picked up a napkin and wrote the name JOSEPH

STAMBILE OL JOSHPI STABILES aS well as a telephone number on this

napkin. CUTOLO used a black felt tipped pen to write down the name

and numbers.

Some of the letters in the last name ran together when

they were written on the napkin.

After CUTOLO had finished writing

the name and the telephone number, he handed it to NAGI and told him

to call this guy and arrange to meet him somewhere where they can't

be observed. NAGI would then have to explain his problem to this

person and perhaps this individual could help him. • SOWERS in answer

to specific questions stated that he did not know if a meeting

• that a meeting took place.

The only reason he knew NAGI had a

problem with a case in New Jersey was because NAGI said so. In

answer to a specific question, SOWERS said that this was the only

occasion that the complete name (JOSEPH STAMBILE OE JOSEPH STABILE)

used. SOWERS said that thereafter, when talking about

their alleged contact, CUTOLO Or GEORGE TROPIANO would use the name

JOE.

The Fed, JOE STUBS or similar name. They never used JOE singularly

as there were a lot of JOES involved in the CUTOLO-GEORGE TROPIANO

operation.

SOWERS assumed that CUTOLO, TROPIANO OF JIMMY NAGI, when

referring to JOE The Fed or JOE STUBS mEant JOSEPH STAMBILE OL JOSEPH

After joining TROPIANO's group, SOWERS was put to work as the

driver for a hijack group operating primarily in the Brooklyn area.

Included in this group were NAGI, VILLEROEL and CARLISI.

Prior to

taking off on what was either the second or third job in which he

participated, CUTOLO furnished SOWERS with, a list of cars, trucks, and

license numbers used by Federal law enforcement agents:

When CUTOLO

gave SOWERS this list, SOWERS and the others were in the Burger Prince.

CUTOLO produced the list from his wallet and copied it on a napkin

which he then gave to SOWERS. The list contained the descriptions

of three cars and two trucks, as well as the license numbers.

The.

cars were listed as a blue Ford, green or brown Plymouth and

blue Dodge, all with New. York State license tags.

One truck was

described as an old telephone truck painted black, the other was

a white truck with Emery Air Freight painted on the side.

trucks also had New York license plates.

CUTOLO bragged that he

had obtained

this list from his friend JOE The Fed and then told

SOWERS that he should be alert for these cars when going out on any

hijack job. When he was in the car en route to the hijack job,

SOWERS gave the identities of these cars and trucks to the other

men in his group and

asked them to beon the lookout for these

particular vehicles.

## Page 89

CUTOLO and TROPIANO sold a lot of the hijack loads that they

had to a fence named GREGG SCARPA. SCARPA operated a discount

store on 76th and 13th Avenue, Brooklyn, N.Y.

During 1972,

SOWERS met SCARPA at his store on three different occasions.* At

each of these meetings SOWERS was in the company of GEORGE TROPIANO.

At one such meeting, which concerned itself with a load of liquor

from Montreal, a man dressed in a business suit came into the

store in order to talk to SCARPA. The man, who came in to see

SCARPA was a white male in his late 30s and gave the impression

of being some type of law enforcement officer. On several other

occasions when TROPIANO had to see SCARPA, SOWERS drove him to

the store but was told to remain in the car while TROPIANO met with

SCARPA.

SOWERS continued to work for CUTOLO and TROPIANO until the

end of 1972, when he broke away from them.

In January 1974,

JAMES. NAGI contacted SOWERS and told him that he had been given

a contract by CUTOLO and TROPIANO to kill SOWERS. In order to

avoid being killed by NAGI, SOWERS went to see CUTOLO and TROPIANO

in order to ask for another chance and to find out why the order

to execute him had been given.

TROPIANO and CUTOLO did not

explain why he was to be killed but did take him back into their

SOWERS continued to work for CUTOLO and TROPIANO throughout

1574 and eventually became the leader of his own criminal group

under the supervision of CUTOLO and TROPIANO.

As soon as he began working for CUTOLO and TROPIANO, CUTOLO began

telling him about his connection JOE The Fed. In March of April 1974,

TROPIANO, who had

a problem relating to a current court case, wanted

to find out what was going to happen in this case and told CUTOLO

in front of SOWERS that he would have to go see JOE The Fed, in order

to find out what's going on.

As a rule when CUTOLO and TROPIANO talkea

about this connection they either called him JOE, JOE The Fed or JOE

STUBS. It was SOWERS impression that in this conversation and in

paper given to NAGI by CUTOLO in 1972.

.

In 1974, CUTOLO and TROPIANO were involved in a smuggling opera-

tion where they smuggled cigarettes and liquor into New York from North.

Carolina. Part of the liquor was sold in New York City, while another

part was sent to a buyer in Bridgeport, Conn. This buyer cheated

CUTOLO and TROPIANO out of $45,000.00 in the sale of this liquor.

SOwERs was sent to Bridgeport in order to speak with this individual

and to recover CUTOLO's and TROPIANO's money.

Prior to the time

that he was going to Bridgeport, SOWERS vas asked by CUTOLO to tell him

when he was going to Bridgeport because he, CUTOLO, wanted to go with

him because he could go to see JOE The Fed in Boston, Massachusetts.

Also about this time in early 1974, TROPIANO and CUTOLO came up

with

a scheme to shake down one of the men who was buying the liquor

they were smuggling into New York City. In order to carry out

12

-N.68262-Docld:32989576 Page 89.

---

## Page 90

this shakedown scheme, SOWERS and several other men

were to pose as police officers and demand that the men pay

them for their silence in the smuggling case. CUTOLO Or TROPIANO

furnished SOWERS with a small box containing a bag in which were

five police shields,

four police ID cards

and two sets of FBI

identification cards.

The FBI identification cards consisted

Of two parts that folded, one over the other. One side of the

cards had the blue letters FBI printed on it.

The other side

had U.S. Department of Justice printed on it in smaller blue

letters.

Neither CUTOLO, nOr TROPIANO ever told SOWERS where they

had obtained the badges and identification cards.

After he

had received these badges and identification cards,

SOWERS began to carry a police badge and identification card

• on his person until he was stopped by the police.

pontificatiot da tame, he

had to throw the identification card and badge away in order to

avoid an arrest for impersonating a police officer. Shortly

after this, TROPIANO told SOWERS to return the badges and

identification cards because the shakedown deal was off. JIM NAGI

found out about these badges and

identification cards because

SOWERS showed him the badge and identification card that he was

using.

In May, 1974, NAGI approached SOWERS and asked him

for the badges

and identification cards, which he needed to pull

a shakedown job of his own.

SOWERS told him that he could

not give him these baäges

and identification

caras because

GEORGE TROPIANO had already taken them back.

•From NAGI, SOWERS also got the impression that he, NAGI,

had been in touch with JOE The Fed, because NAGI told him that he

would have to go see JOE The Fed in Boston, Massachusetts.

SOWERS was not told why NAGI would have to contact JOE The

Fed

at Boston, Massachusetts.

and NAGI, SOWERS

pay off law enforcement officials who were cooperating with and

furnishing information to CUTOLO and TROPIANO. NAGI told

SOWERS that he tape recorded a number of these pay-offs and

was using the recordings a a blackmail tool against the police

official who was being paid off.

SOWERS was also told by CUTOLO

that JOE The Fed or JOE STUBS was being paid one to five

thousand dollars per month depending upon the quality and amount

of information he furnished.

## Page 91

On June 15, 1974, a short time after NAGi had been

arrested by the Nadjari Commission, TROPIANO came into the Burger

Prince and tola CUTOLO and SOWERS that he had just received a

telephone call from

one of his connections.

This individual

told him that NAGI had made a deal with NADJARI and was going to

reveal all of=their law enforcement connections to NADJARI.

TROPIANO also told them that they could not afford to let this

happen and that he had received a green light to kill NAGI

at once.

After NAGI had been killed, SOWERS asked TROPIANO why

he had acted so hastily without ever giving NAGI a chance to

square himself. TROPIANO told SOWERS that it just had to be

done in this way. At this time TROPIANO also told SOWERS that

he would have to call JOE in Boston and tell him that everything

was alright.

After the NADJARI incident, CUTOLO and TROPIANO told SOWERS

that they had been called on the carpet for allowing NAGI to meet

and pay their law enforcement connections.

Now all the law

extorcement connections, as well as the blackmail efforts

against them, was to be

handled by an attorney ALBERT ARRONE.

During the year 1974, CUTOLO engaged in a number of

conversations in which CUTOLO freely talked about his connection

JOE The Fed. In one conversation, he said that JOE was taken

out of town

and couldk't be contacted here anymore.

However,

JOE would now be working with Whitey Tropiano's men in Bridge-

port and New Haven.

CUTOLO also told SOWERS that JOE STUBS Or

JOE The Fed was originally a connection for GREG SCARPA, JOE LANE

and an individual known as DUTCHIE. In July 1974, M00SRS was

present when TROPIANO held a meeting with CHARLIE

PANARELLA at the Sheepshead Bay Athletic Club. CHARLIE wanted

to have some information about a bug that he suspected had

been planted either at his house or some place that he frequented.

TROPIANO told PANARELLA that he could check this out with his

friend JOE.

On another occasion in 1974, CUTOLO and TROPIANO, as well

as SOWERS were in the Red Manor at 60th and Ilth Avenue; Brocklyn,

New York.

CUTOLO began talking about a JOE with IROPIANO,

when TROPIANO asked him which JOE he was talking about. CUTOLO

then told TROPIANO, "You know, our friend Joe The Fed, Joe Stubs".

• • ...

The only name they used

to describe their Federal law enforcement connection was JOE

JOE The Fed, or JOE STUBS. Other than the above 3 individuals,

no one ever discussed JOE The Fed, or JOE STUBs with SOWERS.

The Fed to Defective NULTY of the New York City Police Department

furnished this information.

SOWERS was given a napkin and black felt tipped pen by

Special Agent Rohr and asked to write the name that he had

seen WILLIAM CUTOLO write on a napkin for JAMES NAGI in 1972.

SOWERS then wrote the name (JOSEPH STABILE, JOSEPH STAMBILE an

JOSEPH STATILE on a paper nagkin.

To the best of his recollection

SOWERS stated 'that the name (JOSEPH STAMBILE)is what he actually

saw CUTOLO write on the napkin.

New York, N. Y. 10021.

At the time of his interview he furnished

the following information.

In 1974, SOWERS was associated with two individuals known

as WILLIAM CUTOLO and GEORGE TROPIANO. In conjunction with these

two men, SOWERS engaged in a cigarette and liquor smuggling opera-

tion in which they smuggled cigarettes, as well as liquor,

from North Carolina to New York and Bridgeport, Connecticut.

SOWERS often aoted as the driver of the panel truck used to bring

the cigarettes from either Raleigh or Durham,.

N.C. to New York.

Upon arriving in New York, the truck was parked in a parking lot

at Pennsylvania and Flatland Avenue, where it was then picked up

GUILLERMO SOWERS for questioning regarding the NAGI murder. Sub-

New York City Police Department and agreed to cooperate. During the

ensuing months, NULTY worked closely with GUILLERMO SOWERS in their

investigation of the NAGI murder and other criminal activity.

Detective NULTY was asked if he was personally acquainted

or had ever heard of the former New York City Police Department

Officers, JOSEPH SCHIFFINO Or EUGENE, STATILE, and he replied no.

MrS. GUILLERMO SOWERS was interviewed in her

apartment, Apartment 5A, 514 Ocean Parkway, Brooklyn, New York,

telephone number 436-7925.

Prior to the interview, EDWARD D. HEGARTY

and CLARK F. BROWN identified themselves as representatives of the

FBI Inspection Division, Washington, D. C. SA FORD W. COLE was known

to Mrs. SOWERS as a Special Agent of the FBI as a result of a prior

interview.

Mrs! SOWERS was told the purpose of the interview

. was to determine if she was ever told or received any indication from

her husband that he had knowledge indicating that a member of a Federal

• Law Enforcement Agency, including the FBI, was conducting himself in

an improper or in an unlawful manner. She said that her husband

rarely ever discussed his activities or his associates with her, and

that he definitely never did indicate to her or tell her that he had in

his possession any information indicating improper or unlawful conduct

on the part of any Federal Law Enforcement Officer.

Mrs. SOWERS spontaneously injected that she met her

husband in 1971 while he was working at a supermarket. She, at that

time, was a divorope and began dating GUILLERMO SOWERS. He told her

that he was Italian, having been born at Milan, Italy. Subsequently,

she entertained GUILLERMO SOWERS at her home and introduced SOWERS

• to various members of her family.

In conversing with her family members,

he told each of them that he was

Italian and was born in Milan, Italy.

When they applied for a marriage license, he stated on the application

that he was born in Milan, Italy.

Subsequent to her marriage, she learned that he was not

Italian and was not born in Milan, Italy, but is a Cuban, having been

born in Havana, Cuba. She stated that she told this to her mother,

who is very dissatisfied with her husband GUILLERMO, because he liec

to her, Mrs. SOWERS and to members of Mrs. SOWERS' immediate family.

She was asked if her husband gave her any other indications of deceit-

fulness and she said that occasionally she has suspected that he was

withholding money from her and on some occasions she was of the belief

that he was

somewhat "snéaky."

She said that her husband had no

close associates, although he was frequently contacted by BILLY CUTOLO

telephonically.

on 5/12/75, I telephonically contacted RICHARD ARTHUR,

Director, National Training Center for Polygraph Sciences,

11g9 Medical Arts Building, 57 West 57th Street, New York, N. I.

10019, PL 5-5241, to arrange for a review of polygraph charts

Of GUILLERMO SOWERS.

I informed Mr. ARTHUR, who is acquainted with Special

Agent Pearce, that the New York Office of the rBI had obtained

the approval of BARRY ERIEDMAN, Chief, Rackets Division,

Brooklyn, N. Y., District Attorney's Office, for the FBI

to review

these charts.

Mr. ARTHUR was also advised

that the FBI was not

' investigating the murder case involving SOWERS.

ARTHUR volunteered that he was furnishing information

"from memory", and believed that the polygraph examination of

SOWERS that he conducted was about 4 months ago.

He said that

he had jun SOWERS a second time because the Brooklyn District

Attorney's Office was so convinced that SOWERS was

"telling the

truthse.

ARTHUR was informed that information received by the

FBI was to the effect that SOWERS was telling the truth when he

placed himself in a confession at the scene of a murder.

ARTHUR indicated that his recollection was that the polygraph

examination indicated that SOWERS did more than place himself

at the scene. He said he never "liked the story" that SOWERS

contessed to. SOWERS,.

according to ARTHUR, claimed that he came

through a doorway, heard a shot, saw the victim fall, but woulo

not say that he saw the guy fire the

gun.

ARTHUR, early in the conversation, volunteered that it

was his opinion that SOWERS tempted to beat the polygraph.

His recollection was that SOWERS attempted to do this by altering

his normal breathing pattern, to show a breathing pattern of

approximately ten breaths a minute. Arrangements were made for

a physical review of these charts in question on 5/13/75 through

contact of ARTHUR's associate, GENE SAUDAZZ, as ARTHUR will be

absent from his office.

On May 13, 1975, through arrangements made with

RICHARD ARTHUR, Director, National Iraining Center for

Polygraph Sciences, 1109 Medical Arts Building, 57 West

for review involving polygraph examinations of GUILLERiO

SOWERS.

There were two reports in letter form of approximately

one and one-half page indicating that SOWERs had been afforded.

an original polygraph examination on December 31, 1974 and

had been re-examined on January 9, 1975.

Both reports indicated that the main issue under

consideration in the polygraph examination was the truth

telling involving SOWERS when he made certain claims regarding

the murder of JAMES NAGI.

The December 31, 1974 report indicated that facts

of the murder and SoWeRs participation had been provided

to the polygraph examiners by ANGELO TONA and WILLIAM WAJESKI

of the Kings County District Attorney's Office.

Further,

that these individuals were present during the interview.

The polygen examiners were RICHAPD O. APTHUR and DORI J.

PEARL.

On December 31, 1974 reports indicated that SOWERS

had lied to the following questions:

1. "Did you shoot JIM NAGI?"

Answer: "No."

2. "Did you see GEORGE TROPIANO shoot JIM NAGI?"

Answer: "Yes."

The exact phrasing of the polygraph examination

opinion read,

'It is the opinion of the polygraphist basec

pon the examination of Mr. SOWERS that he has not probabli

told the entire truth of the above listed questions."

Adaitionally:

the report indicated "slight" indications

of truth telling to the following questions:

1. "Did you see JIMMY NAGI get shot?"

Answer: "Yes."

2. "Did you see BILLY CUTOLO shoot JIMMY NAGI?"

Answer: "Yes."

The report advised that it was the opinion of

the polygraphist, based upon the polygraph charts, that

Mr. SOWERS, in regards to the above questions, was telling

the truth.

It went on and stated that this opinion must be

"restricted (limited) in that Mr. SOWERS was trying to

distort the polygraph readings. "

It was also indicated

that this distortion greatly interferes with the correct

diagnosis and chart analysis of lue polygrauh raceras.

The report of the "re-examination" of GUILLERMO

SOWERS in 1975 indicates again that ANGELO TONA and

WILLIAM WAJESKI, Kings County District Attorney's Office,

The same questions

following pertinent questions: .

I. "Did you shoot JIM NAGI?"

Answer: "No."

20

"Did you see GEORGE TROPIANO shoot JIM NAGI?"'

Answer: "Yes."

It was the polygraphist's opinion that SOVERS has

probably not told the entire truth to the above questions.

=. Again it was reported there were "slight indications

of truthfulness when SOWERS was asked the following

questions":

1.

"Did you see jIM NAGI get shot?"

Answer: "Yes."

2. "Did you see BILL CUTOLD shoot JIM NAGI?"

Answer: "Yes."

Thereafter follows a paragraph indicating that the

polygraphist's opinion, based on a re-examination, was toat

SOWERS was telling the truth to the above questions.

Again it was indicated that both polygraph examina-

tions were conducted by RICHARD O. ARTHUR and DORI J. PRART.

It was also indicated that SOWERS had voluntarily.

signed a waiver to take both the original and re-examination.

A review of the charts in question showed that in

the fourth series, December, 1974, of questions sowers

deliberately attempted to alter his normal breathing pattern

by deliberately breathing at a reduced rate.

The efforts to

alter the polygraph charts are readily recognized.

This slowed

rate of breathing was not present in any of the other polygraph

bharts, and particularly it was noted it was not present during

the period when the polygraph examination as being initiated.

Subject at the time of instrument adjustment remains still

and no questions are being asked.

stated in connection with this investigation,

PETE SOWERS had

been developed as a possible.

. suspect due to his close relation-

ship with NAGI but that initial interviews with SOWERS had been

He said, however, that one Saturday morning

SOWERS came to him saying he wanted to cooperate since he felt

he was going to be arrested for NAGI's murder and also that

"he thought there was a contract out for him.

He said over a period of time from that day, SOWERS furnished

voluminous information concerning various planned crimes and

cooperated by meeting with various individuals connected with

these crimes while wearing a body recorder.

He said it was

some time before SOWERS discussed the NAGI homicide but eventually

did furnish them with sufficient information to place charges

against GEORGE TROPIANO and BILLY CUTOLO. He described SOWERS

as being the type of individual who had a great wealth of

information concerniny griminal activities of all sorts and.

that this information would be furnished by him piecemeal over

an extended period of time. He said that during the entire

relationship with SOWERS he had no reason to question his

credibility, stating in many instances they had been able to

completely verify information furnished by SOWERS concerning

criminal activities of various individuals.

He said one problem, however, he did encounter in dealing

with SOWERS was the fact that he tended to arrive at conclusions

crom certain information in his possession, which conclusions

were not based on fact.

He also stated that in evaluatino

SOWERS information one had to always assess the source of the

information SOWERS was privy to and that a lot of such information

was "street talk" which always wasn't factual.

He did verify

that SOWERS was recently arrested by the Rockville Centre,

h.I.! Police Department, on a gun charge, which as subsequently

dismissed.

He said a great deal of information furnished by SOWERS

had in fact been verified in situations where SOWERS wearing!

a body recorder had. engaged individuals in conversation and

the information he had previously furnished had been verified

in these

taped conversations.

He advised that at no time had

to immediately bring this

Commission.

He did recall that SOWERS had mentioned at

one time that one o the naiviouals engagea in the Planning

of ä crime was a person named NORDOFF (phonetic) , whon

SOWERS believed had a son in the FBI but that SOWERS was not

personally acquainted with the son. He said on one occasion

SOWERS had. told him.about.a.corrupt.policeman.in.the. New York

City Police Department and that this information had immediately

been

furnished to the New York City Police Department.

TONA said one of the reasons NAGI had been murdered supposedly

• was that it became known on the

Street that he was

cooperating

with

the Nadjari Comnission.

He also described BILLY CUTOLO

as being a braggart, who fancied himself as a big-time hoodlum.

Ha said an example of this was the fact that they

• had been able

to establish that anytime CUTOLO was going out on

a score,, he

• would dress completely in black

with a white tie, tryiny to

give

the "Godfather" type image.

He described GEORGE TROPIANO as an individual, who supposealy

had

a reputation of being "well connected" in organized crime but

that he personally doubted this since auring the course of their

investigation they learned of an incident whereby TROPIANO went •

to an illegal gambling game to collect a shylock loan and had

been thrown out of the place by the manager of the game.

He said

that if in fact TROPIANO had been well connected this never

would have happened:

He stated he had no knowledge of any informa-

tion, which reflected possible connections between CUTOLO or

TROPIANO with any Federal agency. He doubted that they would have

any such connections.

He stated that the names

unknown to him.

The records of the Dade County Public Safety

Department were caused to be checked on April 24, 1975, regarding

GUILLERMO SOWERS JACINTO, their number 107195, FBI #945 238 D.

These records reflect that GUILLERMO SOWERS is a white male,

This charge was dismissed on

October 2, 1967. On October 3, 196%, he was again arrested

and

charged with assault to commit murder. The charge was dismissed

he Mas been District Manager for Emery Air Freight since 1970.

He stated that curing this period, his company had never loaned

any of its trucks to any law enforcement agency for any reason

whatsoever.

He said this information definitely would have come

to his attention in his present position and he assured that

it could not have happened without his knowledge. He advised that

several years ago, his company had been requested to paint numbers

on the top of their trucks by the New York Port Authority Police

as an aid for surveillance purposes should any of their trucks

become involved in a hijacking situation. LUCCHI advised that

"the company leased their trucks from Hertz Rental, 16301 Rockaway

has known

from past experience, after returning the leased trucks,

Hertz apparently has had occasion shortly thereafter to rent the

trucks still bearing the Emery designation to other customers.

Detective GEORGE COUTSAKIS, New York City Police

Department, was interviewed in an office located on the premises of

the, 13th Precinct, New York City Police Department, Manhattan, New

York.

Prior to

_the interview EDWARD D. HEGARTY and CLARK E. BROWN

identified themselves as representatives of the FBI Inspection Division,

Washington, D. C.

Detective COUTSAKIS was asked i during his investiga-

tion of the murder of JAMES NAGI he had received any information

indicating that anyone was in the possession of information alleging

improper conduct and/or unlawful activity on the part of any member

"of any Federal Law Enforcement Agency, including the FBI, and he

replied no. He was asked if during his conversations with GUILLERMO

SOWERS he received

any statement or indication from SOWERS alleging

improper conduct and/or unlawful activity on the part of any member

of any Federal Law Enforcement Agency, including the FBI, and he

replied no.

Detective COUTSAKIS said he was assigned

as the

investigating homicide detective when JAMES NAGI's body was recovered

on June 25, 1974.

During the course of his investigation he had

occasion to interview a number of NAGI's associates! including GUILLERMO

was uncooperative with him.. Based on his, Detective COUTSAKIS', inter-

that subsequent to his interviews of SOWERS, he learned that SOWERS

has been and is now cooperating with the Prosecutor's Office, Brooklyn,

Prior to

& the interview Edward D. Hegarty and Clark F. Brown identified them-

selves as representatives of the FBI Inspection Division. Special Agent

Good was advised purpose of the interview related to whether or not

(Special Agent Joseph Stabile) or any other FBI employee, had violated

the Bribery Statute. He was questioned specifically regarding his associa-

tion with Ahmad Nagi, also James Nagi who was murdered on June 17,

1974. Special Agent Good furnished the following information:

Good began handling Nagi as a potential criminal informant as a

result of a contact with Nagi on October 1, 1970, subsequent to Nagi's

arrest August 31, 1970, by the Jersey City Police Departnent. Nagi

was cooperative and he furnished information regarding an armed

hijacking which occurred August 31, 1970. As a result of Nagi's coopera-

tion the shipment was recovered and an arrest was made.

Nagi continued to provide information of value on other cases leading

to the recovery of substantial amounts of stolen proporty and more ther

ten arrests in Theft from Interstate Shipment cases. Among the persons

arrested were Henry Serrapica, Frank Lisi, Joseph Lisi, Anthony

Annichiarico, Louis Felice, Harry I, Brown, Lennice Delain, Arthur

Hubbard, Johnny Lawrence, Charles Wharton and fugitive Ralph Guarino.

Facts regarding Nagi's cooperation were made known to Assistant

District Attorney Barry Freidman in connection with a planned hijacking

in July, 1971. Information furnished by Nagi was disseminated prior to

the proposed hijacking and subsequently Nagi was arrested. The charges

were dismissed. Subsequently Nagi furnished very little information of

value and he became unreliable and unstable. Nagi was "closed" as an

informant in July, 1972. He was later reopened as a potential criminal

informant in January, 1973, until April, 1973, during which period he

furnished no information of value.

Nagi continued to contact SA Good from time to time but did note

furnish any information of value. He usually called when he had been

arrested by local authorities and was seeking assistance. On these

, occásions Good explained to him that there was nothing that the FBI

could do to assist him. He requested assistance in connection with an

• arrest for a supermarket robbery in the Bronx. He explained that the

stick-up had been set up by. George Tropiano and Tropiano's associates

which included the manager of the supermarket.

On May 2, 1975, SA Good advised that a short time prior to Nagi's

murder, a three-month period, he contacted sA Good by telephone and

advised that his parole officer was contemplating revocation of his parole

because of arrests. Nagi said he told the parole officer that he had an

incurable disease, and had less than a year to live. The parole officer,

according to Nagi, said he was still going to revoke his parole unless he

received a letter of confirmation from a doctor to the effect that he had

an incurable disease.

Nagi further advised that he had contacted a doctor and had told the

doctor that he was doing some work for the FBI and had to use the excuse

that he had an incurable disease as a cover story and requested the

doctor to give him a letter indicating this. Nagi said the doctor refused

to do this unless he, the doctor, received a letter from the FBI requesting

Nagi requested a letter from SA Good which was denied. Good

told Nagi he shoulan't have told the doctor that he was doing a job for

the FBI since he, Nagi, knew this not to be true.

SA Good further advised that a few days later Nagi came to the New

York Office to see SA Good who was not in. While in the office he may

have observed a sample of FBI letterhead stationery. Several days later

a telephone call was received possibly by Complaint Clerk Joan Wild,

from a U. S. Government Agency believed to be GSA, advising that a

person named James Nagi was attempting to pick up some FBI letter-

head stationery.

On May I and 2, 1975, SA Good advised that he never contacted

Nagi in the company of SA Joseph Stabile; he never discussed Nagi with

MiSS C: RASEH NAGI, 105-84 Flatland 8th, Brooklyn, New York,

telephone 241-0655, advised that she is the sister of JIMMY NAGI.

She said she is Supervisor of Health and Drug Education and Health

Services, Community School District 19, 2057 Linden Boulevard,

Brooklyn, N. Y. 11207, telephone numbers 257-8619 and 257-5900.

MiSS NAGI advised that for a period of approximately three

weeks prior to her brother's murder, he had lived with her, having

separated from his wife.

She said her brother had always been very

kind to her but. she felt that he was trying to overcome the other

side of his personality and his involvement with the criminal element.

She said that they had always been very close and he frequently

'confided in her.

Approximately three or four years ago, her brother had

told her that he was working for the FBI and specifically mentioned

an agent. by the name of John Good as his contact in the FBI.

She

further recalled that on one occasion when her brother had gotten

in trouble he tried to get a statement from his family doctor to

the effect that he had Leukemia and the doctor at the time mentioned

to her that JIMMY had told him how he was working for the FBI and

that she should see if there was any substance to this. She said

the doctor was reluctant to furnish such an untruthtul statement

unless the FBI

was willing to substantiate JIMMY's involvement

with the agency. Miss NAGI said she never did contact the FBI

concerning this matter.

• She further stated that in 1973 JIMMY had served a nine

months sentence for extortion and had asked her to contact Aget Good

to try and get him out of jail.

She said she never did contact

Agent Good nor did her brother ever mention any other FBI contacts

he might have who would help him in this matter.

She said that in addition to his contact with Agent Good

in the FBI, NAGI used to brag about numerous contacts in the

New York City Police Department and had a tendency to brag about

having inside information.

she said frequently her brother would

be reading a newspaper account of a police investigation and would

comment to her that he knew about that matter many months ago

through his contacts in the Police Department.

ANTHONY VILLEROEL, #33161, an inmate at the Great Meadow M

Correctional' Institute, advised that he is presently serving a

prison sentence of three and one-half to ten years for an armed

holdup in Bronx, New York, in 1972. He stated that he was

acquainted with JAMES NAGI for many years and that he and NAGI

began to pull scores during the Spring of 1972 and that they

worked together through 1974 until NAGI was murdered. He said

that he and NAGI, as well as another accomplish on these scores,

PETE SOWERS, hung around the Burger Prince Restaurant, 66th

Street and 8th Avenue, Brooklyn, N. Y., during this period.

VILLEROEL recalled that in the Spring of 1972, JIMMY NAGI

- was driving him around in a "hot car" on which NAGI had changed

, the VIN.

They were stopped by two police officers, who subsequently

took them to the 66th Precinct, New York City Police Department,

New York, for questioning.

He recalled one of the officers

was named BROCKMAN (phonetic).

said when they got to the

precinct, NAGI asked for and was allowed to make a telephone

call and that after talking on the phone for several minutes, he

turned the phone over to one of the police officers,

who had

brought them in.

Following a short conversation, this police

officer said that they had to meet with someone and would be

back shortly.

During

their absence, NAGI told VILLEROEL that

he had called his contact in the New

York City Police Department,

Detective EDDIE CARROLL, who said he

would handle the matter.

Approximately a half hour later the two police officers returned

and said that NAGI was free to go but that VILLEROEL was being

charged with grand larceny-auto.

VILLEROEL said that NAGI had

Irequently told him about his contact in the New York Police

Department EDDIE CARROLL, and that NAGI

CARROLL for protection purposes.

He said that he himself had

frequently received telephone calls from CARROLI at his residence,

when CARROLL was attempting to locate NAGI. He said that he

knew the caller was CARROLL because the latter had so identified

himself on at least one occasion.

VILLEROEL believed that

CARROLE was presently serving as

an aide to a Deputy Inspector

in the New York City Police Department, and that NAGI frequently

furnished information concerning various activities of people he

knew to CARROLL.

He said it was common street talk that NAGI was

a police informant. He advised that on several occasions NAGI had

warned him after receiving infimation from CARROLL that the

"heat was on" VILLEROEL's house and that he was to be careful!

VII,I.EROEL advised that CARROLL never tried to put the "squeeze"

on him for information.

VILLEROEL also volunteered that NAGI frequently mentioned

to him that he had a contact in the FBI, who was the agent who had

arrested NAGI on a hijack case in New Jersey a few years ago.

He said that NAGI never expressed any concern to him nor did

he seem to

worry about any possible charges or trial taking place

In connection with the hijacking charge aganst him. VILLEROLL

also recalled that in connection with this hijacking that NAGI

told him he had been caught with the driver of the hijacked

• truck in his cas.

VILLEROEI, continued that about January 1973, he and NAGI

opened up a body and fender shop at 435 2na Avenue, Brooklyn,

New York, and that they dealt in hot cars.

He recalled on one

occasion, while leaving this location two individuals, who from

appearance were apparently police officers, arrived at the shop

to talk with NAGI.

He said NAGI later told him that these were

men but did not state whether either one of them was the

individual NAGI haâ described as his FBI contact.

In this

regarh: VILLERoEL said thi he balieves possibly the name of NAgI's

FBI contact had been HOFFMAN but couldn't be sure of this.

VILLEROEL stated that NAGI had a telephone number in his possession

by which he could check out registration data for license numbers

of suspected police cars by calling the telephone and pretending

he was a cop.

He said also that NAGI had shown him a list of

license numbers, which he said were FBI cars, and that these

numbers had been furnished him by his police contact.

VILLEROEL

said that he was guite sure that NAGI had

told him lt was a police

contact that had furnished him this list rather than his FBI

contact. In response to whether VILLEROEL had any other knowledge

of police cars that might be interested in either NAGI or his

activities, he volunteered that it was common knowledge around

the Burger

Prince that Enery Air Freight trucks were being used

by the police. He said this was because the same Emery Air

Freight truck would frequently come to the Burger Prince and the

two occupants would sit around the Burger Prince for several

hours over one cup of coffee and gave every indication of being

connected with law enforcement.

He recalled asking NAGI one time

to ask who these people were and NAGI subsequently told. him that

they were the FBI.

VILLERDEL stated that during the Spring of 1973, he recalled

that NAGI had told him that he needed $1,000.00 for his FBI con-

tact, who would supply him with crystals for FBI radio frequencies.

He said he told NAGI that this was too much money and never did

know whether NAGI obtained such crystals. He did say that NACI

had a radio in his possession, which they used to plug into the

cigarette lighter of NAGI's car, which was capable of monitoring

the various police frequencies in Brooklyn, and that they would

use this while casing or pulling scores.

He also recalled on

one occasion that NAGI asked him for and he gave him a portion of

one of his scores for the purpose of, according to NAGI, paying

He further recalled that NAGI never

mentioned his FBI contact to him after approximately the miadie

: of 1973.

VILLEROEL said that in connection with his appeal on the robbery

charges,

for which he was incarcerated, he had obtained a copy

of a police report of the investigation, which reflected that an

FBI Agent had apparently also looked into the matter.

He said

that" he could not recall the agent's name but that he did have

it in his possession in his cell. At the conclusion of the inter-

view, VILLEROEL said he would get the name of the agent from

report and furnish it to one of the guards who took him to his

cell, who could then relay it to the interviewing agents.

The

VILLEROEL aS being HONFMAN.

• VILLEROEL continued that in 1972, he had met PETE SOWERS

through NAGI at the Burger Prince and

they had gone on many scores

until VILLEROEL was incarcerated in September 1974. He describeâ

SOWERS as a very stupid individual, who had been the managei: of

the store he and NAGI held up in the Bronx, for which he, VILLEROEL,

was presently in jail. He said SOWERS had

actually set up the

score for them and was charged with the crime.

He said

that

NAGI and SOWERS, as well as himself, were acquainted with BILLY

CUTOLO and GEORGE TROPIANO. VILLEROEL pointed out that he was

employed at the Burger Prince during this period of time by

CUTOLO.

He said NAGI and SOWERS both told him that CUTOLO and

TROPIANO were very important guys but that neither of them had

ever confided in him about whatever they were doing. He did

recall that CUTOLO used to warn him by saying that he should

stay

away from NAGI and SOWERS because they were "bad news"

pointed out that neither CUTOLO nOr TROPIANO had ever told him

of any contacts they had with law enforcement nor had he ever

himself of NAGI OF SOWERS and that he did not think that these

two individuals were very close to CUTOLO or TROPIANO. He said

the street talk was that NAGI was killed over a million dollar

could furnish no fusther details in this regard. VILLEROEL

denied ever hearing of JOE STOPS Or STABBS or the names (STABILE

having been contacted by or having had any association with FBI

Agents. He said in connection with his incarceration he had been

sent to Elmira Reformatory, where he got the reputaton

of being a wise guy and that he had been examined by a doctor

there, who said he was crazy, because he gave "goofy answers"

He said he was subsequently transferred to-Mattewan State Hospital

for psychiatric examination, where he stayed for a short period,

and then was sent back to Elmira and subsequently to Great Meadow.

He advised that he would be willing to subject himself to a lie

He speculated

that

• it is quite possible a New York City police officer may have

made inquiry of him, some time in the past, regarding VILLEROEL,

and that he may have told him that he knew nothing about VILLEROEL,

which might havresulted in a notation being placed in a police

file indicating contact with him.

GATHERER said that NAGI knew a lot

of people and talked freely about them to him, but he never told him

he was paying any law enforcement official for help and/or

information.

transferred to his present assignment.

course of his work with the hijacking squad he became acquainted.

with JIMMY NaGI, who at the time was dealing in hot cars, mainly

Cadillacs.

During this same period, Carroll stated that he

worked closely with various FBI Agents, including John Good, and

that both he and Good had been using NAGI as an informant.

FIe

described NAGI as being a braggart, who freguented both the 61st

and 62nd Precincts, New York City Police Department, located

in the Brooklyn area.

He said NAGI was always telling people

"about his inside contacts with the Police Department and how he

• could get things taken

care of.

In alition, he said NAGI talked

about having contacts in the Safe and Loft Squad ana used to

carry a list of license numbers, which he said were cars used

by the local

precincts.

Carroll said he never heard NAGI discuss

any contacts

he had with fBl agents, other than John Good, but

he did recall on two or three occasions seeing NAGI with Iony

Villano, whom he knew to be an FBI Agent. and with whom he had

worked

frequently. He recalled on one occasion that NAGI had called him

and asked him to meet in a restaurant.

When he arrived,

NAGI and Villano were together at the restaurant.

He said he

could not furnish any further details concerning the relationship

between Villano)ana NAGI, other than they were acquainted.

Carroll said to the best of his knowledge it was sometime prior

would tell his friends about his contacts in the Police Department

and to prove this would call a police officer on the telephone to

set up a meeting, while at the same time letting one of his friends

listen to the call to prove that he had such contacts. He said a

good example was several years ago during the course of an investiga-

tion they utilized a telephone intercept in which NAGI was overheard

telling a friend of his how he could get a case fixed because of his

acquaintanceship with a certain New York City Police Officer.

MI. GOLDSTEIN, in the presence of Special Agents BROWN

interest in

and he replied that he furnished the information to New York City

Police Department Lieutenant WHITE at Brooklyn, New York. At first,

Mx. EVERSLEY stated he did not believe he told Lieutenant WHITE that

the information came from JAMES NAGI, but upon further reflection

he thought that possibly he did advise Lieutenant WHITE that the source,

of the information was JAMES NAGI.

Mr. GOLDSTEIN advised that he was informed by NAGI on

April 9, 1974, that he, NAGI, had been threatened by WILLIAM CUTOLO.

He said that about this time, believed to be April 12, 1974, NAGI

complained that he was suffering from leukemia.

Shortly thereafter,

MX. GOLDSTEIN contacted Dr. NICHOLAS LEONIA, who is associated with

the Long Island College Hospital, and learned from Dr. LEONIA that

NAGI was being treated by him for the disease leukemia. He recalled

After having taken NAGI

into custody, SHEVLIN stated, he was told by NAGI. that he, NAGI,

FBI with Intormation on hijackina cases..

NAGI offered to furnish

good information to Detective SHEVLIN 1f SHEVLIN would inform the

Brooklyn District Attorney's Office about his cooperation.

In early June, 1974, SHEVLIN said he received a

call from NAGI who told him that he, NAGI, and several others were

going to rob a prominent politician. NAGI told him that they had

quas and badges for this job and that they were going to have the

assistance of two crooked policemen on this particular robbery.

Later SHEVLIN learned that the two policemen were undercover police-

men working for the NADIART Commission and NAGI was actually arrested

for his role in the robbery.

SHEVLIN advised

that he talked to NAGI for quite

sometime and intended to use him further as an informant. At no

time during his conversations SHEVLIN advised did NAGI ever tell

him that he was paying off police officers or members of the

Federal Law Enforcement establishment. The only mention of Federal

Can ya on on in han

Law Enforcement Office that NAGI ever

made, according to SHEVLIN,

was his statement that he was and had been furnishing good hijacking

information to the FBI in New York.

MY. EDWARD D. ROSSITER, Deputy Chief, Hudson County

Prosecutor's Office, made available Hudson County Prosecutor's

Office File 70-1528, State of New Jersey vs. JAMES A. NAGI and

ANTHONY P. TONANI.

The file reflects NAGI and TONANI were

arrested August 31, 1970, by officers of the Jersey City Police

Department and were then charged with armed robbery, assault,

kidnaping, threatening life, receiving stolen goods

and possession

of a deadly weapon.

The file further reflects that no action was

taken in this matter until 3/5/75 when the case was presented

to::a Hudson County Grand Jury and an indictment was returned

charging NAGI and TONANI with violating the above Statutes.

On 4/3/75, TONANI entered a plea of not guilty to the charges.

Mr. ROSSITER advised that he is not familiar with the

case and advised the delay between arrest and indictment is some-

what irregular.

He did state that it appears to him as though

someone nad pulled the file out of the mainstream of the administra~

tive handling and it was not until recently that the file had been

located again.

He stated he could not explain the reason for this

actaon. He did, however, say that as far as he knows neither

NAGI nOr TONANI were ever used as informants by the Hudson

County Prosecutor's Office.

He further advised that he does

not recall any member of the FBI inquiring about NAGI or

TONANI.

He did state he has not been in the Hudson County

Prosecutor's Office for too long and that it would be better to

contact the First Assstant Prosecutor, Mx. MEGILI, who had been

with the office about seven or eight years.

MEGILL then reviewed the Hudson County

Prosecutor's file on the case of the State of New Jersey vs.

JAMES A. NAGI and ANTHONY P. TONANI. After reviewing the file,

Mr. MEGIlL stated that this case was not familiar to him ano

that he was surprised at the length of time between the arrest

in 1970 and

the indictment in 1975. Mr. MEGILI stated that

this is unusual because the Statute of Limitations had almost

• run in this case.

Mr. MEGILL stated that he was unable

to explain this delay other than to say. that the file had been

pulled from their mainstream administrative handling for some

reason, which was not noted in

the file.

The only reason he

could think of, Mr. MEGILI advised, was that one of the

individuals charged, either NAGI Or TONANI, might have been

cooperating with some law enforcement agency and, therefore,

charges against them were held in abeyance.

From the file

arone, however, he could not determine this with any amount oi

certainty.

He further advised that the only two people in the

JAMES NAGI

arrested in 1970 by the Jersey City Police Department

for hijacking and kidnaping. Further, he stated he does not

remember his office doing any type of investigation in this

matter.

He also stated that as far as he can recall nobody by

-the name of AHMAD OI JAMES NAGI ever acted as an informant for

'the Hudson County Prosecutor's Office, while he was working there.

Mr. GREENBERG advised that normally the local Municipal

Magistrates in Hudson County would forward criminal cases to the

prosecutor's office where they would be assigned to a prosecuting

attorney for an opinion. If the case warranted prosecution it

was brought before the Grand Jury for an indictment.

He did state

that the volume of cases referred to the prosecutor's office is

so great that the resulting backlog sometimes caused cases to

be delayed for years before being brought to the Grand Jury.

Mr. GREENBERG advised that THOMAS ST. PIERCE joined

the prosecutor's office in /February 1972 and then quit

approximately a year later.

MI. DAVID J. RIICHIE, Attorney for the Eastern Distrikt

of New York Strike Force, U. S.

Department of Justice, advised

that he was the attorney assigned to the case entitled, U. S. vs.

PAUL DE PALO, JOSEPH VICTOR MELE, in Which DE PALO and MELE were

charged with violation of Title 18, U. S. Code, Sections 472,

371 and 372. Aceording to RITCHIE, four people were arrested in

this case but two of the individuals VINCENT SINATRA and CHARLES

ZUMO were actually Secret Service undercover agents. Mr. RITCHIE

advised further that the Secret Service Agent handling this case

was Special Agent ALBERT P. ANGELONE. The arrest stemmed out of

a buy made by ANGELONE and Special Agent LOUIS J. TRAVAGLINO in

October, 1972, at the TWA Terminal, JFK Airport, New York.

agents at that time bought almost $500,000.00 worth of counter-

feit currency from DE PALO and MELE.

RITCHIE advised that the U. S. Grand Jury in the Eastern

District of New York listened to evidence furnished by the Secret

Service Agents in regard to this case on 10/25/72.

Subsequently,

he stated in a letter dated February 7, 1973, addressed to KURT

MUELLENBERG, Deputy Chief, Organized Crime Section, U.S. Depart-

menteol. Justice, he, RITCHIE, recommended that DE PALO and MELE

be prosecuted for violation of Title 18, U.J. Code, Sections 472,

377

and 372. Subsequent to sending this letter, RITCHIE stated

he was approached by the Secret Service andasked not to pursue this

case any further because prosecution of DE PALO and MELE would

endanger a very important informant working for the Federal Bureau

of Investigation.

As a yesult of this request, which he

recalls

was made by Secret Service Agent ANGELONE he,

RITCHIE, closed the

file on 3/14/73, without ever prosecuting DE

PALO Or MELE.

Mr. RITCHIE advised that early in 1973, he was contacted

by two agents of the fBI, who asked if he had any objections to their

speaking to Mr. DE PALO in order to obtain information on crimina

activities in the New York area from him. RITCHIE advised that he

does not recall who the two agents were.

He did say he told them

to go ahead and talk to DE PALO since it did not appear that the

case would be prosecuted.

Other than the two agents who requested

to spoak with DE PALO in 1973, no other representative of the Federal

Bureau of Investigation ever contacted him regarding the case on PAUL

DE PALO.

which they were hoping to find a buyer.

Special Agent Tallia

stated that he disseminated this information to Special Agent

Albert Angellone of the Secret Service.

Additionally, Tallia

Special Agent Angellone to the informant, Angellone had told

him that the informant would never be needed to testify in this

case,and that the Secret Service would make several buys and

introduce someone else into the picture in order to completely

sever the informant from the case.

As best as he can recall,

Pallia advisod the case against the two anbjects in this case

coverage and, 'in addition, he personally listened to a significantly

large sampling of conversations recorded uring the course of the

was monitored in the same room, as were the GENtluE case

gation of the case captioned "WORKMEN'S MOBILE LUNCH ASSOCIATION,

INC.; PHILIP RASTELII; und others; ANTI-RACKETEEPING - HOBBS ACT;

RACKETEER INVLUENCED

& CORRUPT ORGANIZATIONS, CONSPIRACY", and

ran from August 31, 1972, until September 14, 1972. SA GENOVA rE-

called thatSA STABILE was present during some of

the monitoring

connected with the GENTILE case.

SA GENOVA exhibited FBI records

relating to the monitoring of EDNY 145, which records indicated

that JOSEPH STABILE was present in the

Monitoring Room on September 8th,

September 11, 12, and September 13, 1972.

SA GENOVA said that the electronic surveillance coverage

in the GENTILE case was highly successful, particularly the micro-

phone coverage afforded GENTILE's residence, in terms of the amount

of significant evidence accumulated. As a result of the GENTILE

investigation, an indictment was returned on May 23, 1973, which

charged JOSEPH GENTILE and numerous other persons with violations

of Title 18, United States Code, Sections 1955, 371 and 2.

On January 18, 1974, Attorney-In-Charge DENIS E.

DILLON, Eastern District of New York Strike Force, Brooklyn, New

York, advised that the indictment returned on May 23, 1973, against

all subjects of the GENTILE investigation would be dismissed.

The

reason for the dismissal, according to Strike Force Attorney DILLON,

as narrated by SA GENOVA, was that there was a fatal flaw in the

123

## Page 201

NY 53-1854

harkiling of the magnetic voice recording tapes obtained during the

above-described electronic surveillances. DILLON advised that Strike

Force Attorney FRED BARLOW had failed to cause the sealing of the

tapes by a United States District Court Judge pursuant to the

provisions of Title III, and that the tapes

had rémained in Strike

Force Attorney BARLOW's office for nine months. On January 18, 1974,

Attorney-in-Charge DILLON advised that after consultation with

the Acting United States Attorney, for the Eastern District of New

, York, and his.Depaxtment of Justice superiors, the indictments would

be dismissed because the provisions of the Statute had not been

* complied with.

SA GENOVA said he personally reviewed the physical

evidence seized at various times, as a result of investigative activity

in the GENTILE case, and that from his review of the material seized,

he is confident there are no indications whatsoever of any connection

whatsoever between (Sa SIABILE.)and JOSEPH GENTILE.

SA GENOVA Said that SA JOSEPH STATIE had asolutely

nothing to do with the Strike Force's failure to insure compliance

with the provisions of Title III.

Mr. WILLIAM CUTOLO was interviewed at a picnic

table sitting under an awning in front of the Burger Prince Restaurant,

6521 Eighth Avenue, Brooklyn, New York. At the outset of the inter-

view, SAS KLAUS C.

RQHR and FORD W. COLE identified themselves to

CUTOLO by displaying their credentials. Subsequent to this, SA ROHR

told Mr. CUTOLO that he wished to interview him regarding CUTOLO's

possible connection with some member of the Federal Law Enforcement

establishment. SA ROHR also told CUTOLO that this interview had

nothing to do with his involvement with local authorities.

At this

time, SA ROHR furnished CUTOLO with an "Interrogation; Advice of

Rights" form and asked him to read same. Mr. CUTOLO read this form

and stated that he understood his rights, a's set out therein.

He

advised that he did not want to sign this form, but wouid answer

• questions asked of him.

SA ROHR then asked CUTOLO if he had ever told anyone

that he had a contact within the Federal Law Enforcement establishment,

including the FBI.

Mr. CUTOLO advised that he definitely did not

have any contact with anyone in the Federal Law Enforcement establish-

ment. SA ROHR then asked CUTOLO if he had ever paid money to any

member of the Federal Law Enforcement establishment for information

or help in any enterprise in which he, CUTOLO, may have been engaged.

CUTOLO again emphatically denied ever having done such a thing.

Mr. CUTOLO was next askeú if he ever received any information irom

anyone in Federal Law Enforcement, including the FBI, relating to

the arrest of his brother-in-law PAUL DE PALO for possession of

counterfeit money in 1972.

Mr. CUTOLO answered that he had never

received any information

from anyone connected with Federal Law

Enforcement regarding this case. The only connection he had withthe

case, CUTOLO stated, was that he assisted DE PALO in obtaining an

attorney to represent him in that case.

The attorney he reconnended,

CUTOLO stated, was ALBERT ARRONE, who is currently representing him,

CUTOLO.

Mr. CUTOLO advised that questions asked of him by

SA kOHk a1d not come as a surprise because he had been told by his

brother-in-law, PAUL DE PALO, as well as his cousin, MARK PALUMBO,, that

the FBI had been to see them

asking similar questions.

It was also noted that PAUL DE PALO was on the premises

of Burger Prince working behind the counter at the time of interview.

" NORDORFF advised him that if SOWERS did not pay NORDORFF $5,000.00,

he would have SOWERS fired. SOWERS had lied in his application for

employment that he had never been arrested, but he had. NORDORFE

found this out, and threatened to have SOWERS fired for this if he

did not pay.

Shortly after this, SOWERS was contacted by a CHARLIE

(LNU), and "T.T. (LNU)", who advised him that they would kill him

if SOWERS dia

not pay the money to NORDORFF. SOWERS went to TROPIANO

and GEORGE TROPIANO, BILL CUTOLO and SOWERS had a "sitdown" in

Astoria, Queens, with "CHARLIE" and "T.T."

New York. NOTHDURET advised that his son was an agent stationed

in Washington, D. C., however he was not aware of what his son

did. He advised that his son worked in Top Secret work and was

extremely close mouthed. He said his son never told him about the

nature of his work.

At the outset of the interview, NOTHDURFT volunteered

that we probably wanted to talk to him about WILLIAM SOWERS. When

asked why, he said because he was the worst apple he knew.

Fie

advised that BILL SOWERS had worked for him as Night Manager of

a Shop-Rite store; but did not know where he could be found now.

He said SOWERS had

resided at one time at 175 Webster and at

another time somewhere on Newkirk Avenue, both in Brooklyn, New

York. He advised that SOWERS had a brother PETE SOWERS and would

often use his name.

He advised that PETE" SOWERS worked in the

Bronx in a supermarket, but he did not know where he lived or

exactly where he worked. He advised that CHARLIE SPEROZA was an

Essociate of BILL SOWERS and that an attorney by the name of LEONE

(phonetic), telephone 544-8484, 125-10 Queens Boulevard, Queens,

New York, would know now to get

in touch with SPEROzA.

NOTHDURFI advised that when SOWERS worked for him he had

stolen $3,000.00. He said that in an effort to collect #3,000 for

the company he had threatened to have a guy work SOWERs over.

commented "anything for the company - you know". Following this,

he said that SOWERS came by with two other people.

He described

one of them as an older man with wavy grey hair, whom he described

as the brains.

He, described the other as a young man who was cocky.

He said that they threatened him if he didn't stop trying to collect

the $3,000.00. Following this confrontation, he said he drove off

and had gone only a short distance when he had to stop and he

vomited.

He said he knew then

that they had gotten to him. He

never collected the $3, 000.00.

He again reiterated that this was the only time he had ever met

CUTOLO.

NOTHDURFT advised that he had never told SOWERS Or

the two, mentioned above, that he had any connections whatsoever

with the FBI. He said however, that when the three of them confronted'

him they knew his son was in the FBl and that they accused him of

being a retired FBI agent. He denied that he had ever indicated to

anyone that he could obtain FBI information and, in fact, he could

not obtain FBI information. He stated that he was willing to take

a polygraph examination concerning this or any other information

he had provided.

He advised that he had recently received a telephone

call from the police concerning SOWERS being involved in a murder.

He did not know the name of the victim or the other subjects involved.

knew him.

NOTHDURFT stated he is aware that some years ago Hill

Brothers Stores in Brooklyn, New York, made a deal with some highly placed

hoodlums, whereby burglaries of these stores would cease for a speci-

fied payoff.

NOTHURFT was not aware of the amount of money these

hoodlums received from Hill Brothers Stores, but understands it was

a substantial amount.

In addition, he advised that Hill Brothers

Stores were not burglarized for a five-year period, which he,

NOTHURFT understands was the agreed upon number of years during which

time the store would suffer no burglaries.

Supervisor Edward D. Hegarty caused a search

to bé made of FBI Headquarters records in an effort to

determine whether or not there is an employee of the New York

office by the name of "ADAMS" and whether or not there has

been any FBI employee at New York City by the name of ADAMS

since January 1, 1970. FBI Headquarters records reflect

that there is currently no employee of the New York Office

by the name of ADAMS.

Since January 1, 1970 through date

of record review April 29, 1975, there were two persons

bearing the surname "ADAMS" employed in the New York Division,

namely:

JOYCE E. ADAMS:

MISS ADAMS was born January 26, 1952, at Newark,

New Jersey.

She entered on duty at New York as a clerk-typist

July 6, 1970, and was promoted to clerk-stenographer November 28,

1971, at New

York. On March 20, 1972, she was transferred Iron

the New York Office to the Newark Office from where she

resigned on August 18, 1972.

Her reason for leaving was to

obtain employment with an employer located closer to her

residence.

A review of Miss ADAMS personnel records reflects

she was a

satisfactory employee.

DONALD HALL ADAMS:

Mr. ADAMS was born December 11, 1913, at Johnstown,

Pennsylvania, and was graduated from Penn State, State College,

Pennsylvania, in 1938.

He entered on duty as an FBI employee

April 26, 1943, and was assigned to the New York Division on

• August 9, 1945, where he remained until his retirement on

June 30, 1972. A review of his personnel records indicates

he was-almost exclusively assigned to non-criminal type

investigations.

There is no indication in his personnel records

that he was ever involved in investigations

organized crime figures.

a contact within the FBI but that he never heard that

anyone did in fact have an FBI contact.

This informant

said if there was such a contact he believes he would know

of it, if it exists now, or if it existed back in 1972.

Confidential Informant No. 5, a member of the

Joseph Colombo "family" ICN was interviewed on Mav 9,

1975, and again on May 12, 1975, regarding whether or not

he has

any knowledge or has received any indication that

there is a leak in the New York office of the FBI or elsa-

where in the FBI and he said he has no such information

knowledge.

Confidential Informant No. 6, who is not a member

Of ICN, advised on May 20, 1975, that he spoke with an

associate of WILLIAM CUTOLO On

• May 17, 1975; and that this

associate of CUTOLO said, "Billy said

he has a guy in the

FBI who said he (Billy) is being watched and they

have a

beeper on his car.

The FBI is now on the

source sald he was not present when Billy allegedly made

this statement but he, the confidential informant, believes

his associate received this information from Billy. Cutolo.

This confidential informant said that he never received

any indication prior to this one case

indicating that anyone

had a source: within the FBI.

John Caputo;

Bribery; Perjury

New York File 58-1854

On May 14,

and May 15, 1975, Guillermo Sowers,

who is also known by other names, after voluntarily signing

a waiver consenting to a Polygraph examination, was afforded

a Polygraph examination in the New Iork Office

by Supervisor

Ja Robert Pearce, and assisted by Special Agent Klaus G. Rohr.

The purpose of the Polygraph examination of

Guillermo Sowers, also known as, was to determine the truth

statements he had made to the fedcral Bureau

.o1 investigation in which allegations were nade that Billy

Cutolo, George Tropiano and James Nagi, from 1972 until Nagi's.

murder in 1971, at certain periods of time directly told

Sowers or that Sowers was part of a conversation in which

these three individuals alleged that they had a connection

within the Federal Government.

Sowers claimed, among other

things, that this alleged contact was paid money in return.

for information.

The contact was called "Joe the Fed, Our

erlend; The fed, doe. Stubs (per Sowers 'like a theatre ticket

stu'b')".

That on one occasion Cutolo in Sowers presence in

1972 gave Jimmy Nagi a slip of paper with the name(Joe Stabile)

or a

similar-sounding name on it as a person who would help

Nagi

New Jersey. Sowers believed, he stated, that this name

was the contact.

Another point made by Sowers was that

Cutolo, in 1974, had indicated a desire to travel to

Connecticut with Sowers as Outolo was going to visit. "Joe

the Fed", who was. thrn in Boston, Massachusetts.

Interpretation of chartered responses in the

Polygraph examination take into consideration the facts

disclosed by. sowers, such as:

1:.

Sowers has had approximately fifteen Polygraph

interviews and has no belief in them.

?: One commercial Polygraph examination of him

in connection with employment, according to sowers, showed

he was telling the truth when

he lied and showed he was lying

when he was telling the truth.

Sowers,

he "thinks in somersh"

; even though fluent in English, stated

, thereby causing. delays in answers

and which in itself registers on the Folygraph chart and

makes chart interpretation accordingly nore difficult.

4. Sowers at the present time is furnishing informa-

tion involving alleged murders,

including

the murder of Jimmy

Nagi, and the: subject matter at hand creates a situation in

which it is difficult to place sowers under the proper amount

of stress:

A complete set of questions, including relevant

irrelevant, control or guilt complex questions, are included

as an addendum to this memorandum,

in pre ana post-Polygraph interviews.

furnished no additional information. He enlarged on previous

information provided the Federal bureau of Investigation. He

indicated he had no present health problems, no high or low

blood pressure, no respiration problems, was not on medication

ana claimed that he was rested.

The first series of questions, May 14, 1975,

showed routine nervousness. at the beginning of examinations

and questions I and 2. At the iirst relevant question,

Question #3; "Have you deliberately given the FBI any false

information

followed by a relief combined with a change of breathing

pattern..

It is pointed out that chartered reactions at the

first relevant question are not unusual but are indicative

of stress and not necessarily a response showing deception.

- 20.

NW 68262 Docld:32989576 Page 233

---

## Page 234

The strongest emotional response in Series I

was to Question #?, "During the summer of 1972 did you

see Bill Cutolo give Nagi a slip ofpaper with the name

@ee Stabile)on it?"

, answer "Yes":

Additionally, thore is an emotional response to an

answer "No". In the chart

interpretation comparison was made to the responses chartered

"Did you ever deliberately frame

, and to & guilt complex question,

Question #9;. "Were you in any way involved in the Lopensin

murder?", answer "No".

In the control type questions and guilt complex

question, emotional responses were less than the pertinent

question, i?, and particularly to a lesser degree question,

In an effort to place Sowers at the proper stress

level and to chart responses to a known lie, he was requested

to choose a number between 3 and 8, and thereafter, in Series

2, when asked to answer No to such

questions, i.e., "Did you

choose #1; Did you choose #2", etc.

The known lie was recorded at Question 15, and

shows changing in breathing pattern, a readily noticeable

rise in the Galvonic skin response,

with a slignt increase

in blood pressure, followed by a more routine rhythmatic

breathing pattern, and less body movement or deep sighs being

noticeable.

Immediately at the completion of Series 2,

Sowers was advised that the exact same questions asked in

Series I be repeated in the order they were asked in Saries 1.

The chartered responses in Series 3 were again of

similar severity with the most noticeable being a response to

Question #7, dealing with an alleged slip of paper with the .

nane Joe Stabile on it, and to a lesser degree question #3:

directed towards ascertaining if Sowors had deliberately given

the Federal Bureau of Investigation false information about

"Joe the Fed".

-3=

NW 68262 Docld:32989576 Page 234

## Page 235

It is the opinion of the Polygraph operator

that Sowers.has furnished some false information to tha;

Federal Bureau of Investigation (Question #3) and has

not told: the complete truth in response to Question it?.

At this point Sowers was questioned in regards to the

emotional responses chartered and made the point that he

believed

told him,

reiterated that most of the information he know came

from Cutolo in regards to "Joe the Fed". Sowers continued

to maintain that he was being truthful, as to what he had

been told personally; but made the point that he had caught

Cutolo in several lies.

however.,

that he believed some of the information that Cutolo had

told him about

"Joe the Fed" because of the facts of the

situation involved, such as being given a list d automobiles

and trucks by description and license numbers allegedly being

used by the Federal

Bureau of Investigation Agents in 1972.

In Series 4, Question. #3, dealing with a list of

cars given Sowers. by Cutolo shows no emotional responsas

indicative of deception, nor is there an erotional response

to Question #5, dealing with the point whether or not Cutolo,.

in Sowers presence,

gave Nagi instructions to set up an

appointment with "Joe Stubs"

There is a chartered resyonse

to control queenion, "Have you ever committed a crine

you have not

', answer "Yes"..

There is

greater response to question #y,

"Did you hear Cutolo say he

paId $5,000.00 for good information?"

, answer "Yes".

It is the opinion of the Polygraph examiner that

Sowers has not told the complete truth in regards to this

particular point. It is noted, however,.

the response could

possibly be one of confusion as Sowers had told varying

accounts of this, and at first indicated that this conversa-

tion pertained to another "Fed"

, possibly naned Adams. • The

point.of Adams was cleared up during interview and it is

probable that if thore was an additional contact named

the contact was with the New York State authorities

investigating liquor and cigarette tax matters as Adams

allegedly furnished information in regaras to these activities.

## Page 236

Question number 7, dealing with the statement that

An Imery Air Freight truck was alleged to be on the list

of cars being used by Federal Bureau of Investigation agents in

1972.

The responses do not necessarily indicate deception.

Series 5 was at the end of the day and because of the

fatigue factor, no interoretation is being made of any of the

questions involved.

Pertinent points of relevant questions

were repeated on May 15, 1975.

There were no significant emotional responses

chartered in Series 7:

In Series 8 the most reaction was to Question #9,

an irrelevant question, "were you in the Marines'"

, which indicates

Answer

that sowers probadly nas not told the

•complete truth about his service in the United States Marines.

The possibility exists that the response may have been in

connection with activity legal or illegal while sowars was

in the Marines..

To the control question, "Have you ever smoked

pot in your life?"

Answer - "Yes", there is also a significant

emotional response.

These responses were greater than to any

of the relevant questions.

There was a slightly severe response

to Question #8, answer

noted that Sowers smiled when being asked this question, and

muscular movement of the smile was chartered and it is noted

in pointing.!

out that the response is probably not one of

deception.

series #9 shows a noticeable response to question ivo".

"Did you lie to any of my questions yesterday? Answer -

1o control Question 15; "Did you ever commit a crime in

Florida you have not confessed to?" shows a less severe

emotional response.

sowers said the crime was failure to pay

alimony.

Series #i0 shows no severe emotional responses.

-5-

NW 68262 Docld:32989576 Page 236

## Page 237

Series #1l, almost direct interrogation, was

airected towards ascertaining if Sowers was truth telling

when le stated that "Joe the Fed" originally was a contact

for Joe Gentile, also known as Joe Lane,

Scarpa) and Dutchy, whose complete identity is unknown to

Sowers. Additionally, efforts were made to ascertain if

Sowers knew any of scveral other people. There was no

strong emotional response indicated to

any of the questions.

There was; however, beginning at Question #6, chartered

reactions caused by Sowers swallowing.

There was no conclusion

that there was a deceptive answer to any of these questions.

The final series was a repeat of Series #1. There.

was similar chartered reactions to both question #3 and

Question #? of this series, which again indicates that Sowors

is not telling the complete truth to the Federal Bureau of

Investigation and has not told the complete truth in regards.

to his statement that he has seen the name (Joseph Stabile)

or a similar sounding name on a piece of paper in 1972.

In the post-Polygraph interview, Sowers was'

questioned

as to now ne coula recall a name on a piece of paper in 1972

and had never had the name repeated to him since that date.

He said he had a photographic memory. It is indicated that-

the possibility exists that Sowers did see a name being written

on a piece of paper, but is at this date reluctant to change

his story and perhaps admit that he cannot recall specifically

what the name is on the paper.

The conclusions

made by Polygraph examiner are made

with limitations and considerations as set forth above.
