have been made during the past few years and concerning each
of which we would appreciate your supplying us with the
following information:

1. How did FBI Headquarters first become aware of
the allegation?

2. Was an investigation or inspection conducted?
If not, was any other action taken?

3. How was the decision made to conduct (or not to
- conduct) an inspection or investigation, or to take
(or not to take) other action?

4. Which Division, or operating level (headquarters
or field), conducted the inspection or investigation?

Was prosecution or administrative action (e.g.,

‘suspension or dismissal) considered or taken?

If any of the allegations on the attached list
were made today, would they be handled by the
newly-created office of Professional Responsibility?

‘In what manner would they be handled? If an investi-

gation were deemed warranted, which agency's personnel

‘would do the investigating. In this regard, please
also advise concerning which agency's personnel will

be investigating recently-reported allegations that
agents of the FBI "attempted to coerce" a House
Select Committee on Intelligence witness “into
repudiating his. testimony before the select panel."”

Answers to questions 1 - 7 should be accompanied by full
‘+ back-up documentation, including memoranda, inspection or

U. 8. Senate Select Committee to
Study Governmental Operations With
Respect to Intelligence Activities (SSC)

FBI Headquarters was advised on February 10, 1973,
by the New York Office of the FBI.

2. Was an investigation or inspection conducted? If not,
was any other action taken?

Yes, a personnel matter investigation was instituted on
February 8, 1973.

8. How was the decision made to conduct (or not to conduct)
an inspection or investigation, or to take (or not to take) other action?

It has always been the operating procedure of the FBI to
immediately institute appropriate inquiry into any allegation made
concerning FBI personnel,

4, Which Division or operating level (headquarters or field)
conducted the inspection or investigation?

The New York office of the FBI and the FBI Headquarters’
Inspection Division conducted the investigation.

5. How was the decision made as to which Division or
operating level was to conduct the inspection or investigation?

Upon the recommendation of the Assistant Director in Charge
of the New York office of the FBI, that office conducted an in depth
investigation into the allegation. In August, 1973, after receipt of
information which added a new dimension to the matter, the Director
of the FBI instructed that the Inspection Division conduct all additional
inquiry. :

U. S. Senate Select Committec to
Study Governmental Operations With
Respect to Intelligence Activities (SSC)

6. Was the original allegation reported to the Attorney General
or any other Department of Justice official?

Yes, by letter to the Deputy Attorney General dated June 19,
1973, captioned "John Caputo - Results of Inquiry Concerning Alleged
Bribery of FBI Agent in Anti-Racketeoring Matter" and by letter to
the Attorney General, with a copy to the Deputy Attorney General, dated
duly 25, 1978, bearing the same caption.

7. Were the results of the inspection or investigation reported
to the Attorney General or any other Devartment of Justice official?

Yes, a report dated July 25, 1973, captioned "John Caputo;
Bugene Statile; Bribery, " was furnished to the Organized Crime and
Racketeoring Section of the Department of Justice on September 12,
1973. A veport in the matter captioned "John A, Caputo, Et Al.,
Bribery, Perjury," dated May 23, 1975, was. furnished to the
Attorney General by letter dated June 4, 1975, Being delivered with
this meraorandum is a eopy of that report together with a copy of the
dune 4, 1975, letter to the Attoraey General.

8. Was prosecution or administrative action (e.g., suspension
or dismissal) considered or taken?

No prosecutive action was taken against FBI personnel inasmuch
as no information was developed which would in any way corroborate
the allegation. It should be noted that John Caputo is currently awaiting
trial in United States District Court, Eastern District of New York, on
perjury charges relating to the bribery allegations.

Although the extensive investigation did not establish any evidence
of dishonesty on the part of FBI personnel in connection with the allegation,
it was determined that three Agents had been derelict with respect to
longstanding administrative policies of the FBI. As a result, two of the
Agents were censured and transferred and the third Agent was censured,
placed on probation, transferred, and suspended for five days without pay.

U. S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE TO
STUDY GOVERNMENTAL OPERATIONS WITH
RESPECT TO INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

RE: ALLEGATION NUMBER 5

Reference is made to SSC letter dated January 8, 1976, asking

for FBI responses to eight questions concerning each of five allegations

of FBI misconduct and abuse. In modification of the SSC letter, Mr. John
7, Elliff, SSC Domestic Intelligence Task Force Director, advised Mr.

W. O. Cregar of this Bureau on January 12, 1976, that the purpose of

this inquiry is to learn what information is provided to the Attorney General
consistent with his oversight responsibilities once an allegation surfaces

in the media.

‘The following response concerns Allegation Number 5 which reads:

A recent edition of Time Magazine reported that "sensitive"
FBI documents "were carried off in an FBI truck to West
Virginia's Blue Mountain Ridge Club, a Shenandoah Mountain
Hideaway used by innermost -FBI officials for regular poker
games with CIA and other cronies. The papers were burned
in the Club's large fireplace." :

"“Sefore Secretary Gandy could look at them in heover's

house, the most sensitive papers were carried off in an FBI
truck to West Virginia's Blue Ridge Club, a Shenandoah iéountain
hideaway used by innermost PBI officials for regular poker games
with CIA and other cronies. There the papers were burned in
the club's large fireplace. Precisely who ordered this destruc-~

’ tion and carried it out has not been disclosed. The three-story
club, valued at up to $200, 000, burned to the ground in a fire
of undetermined cause on Noy. 23. No evidence of arson has
been discovered."

2, Was an investigation or inspection conducted? If not, was
any other action taken?

An investigation was conducted on December 16 and 17, 1975.

3. Row was the decision made to conduct {er not to conduet)}
an inspection or investigation, or to take (or not to take) other action?

Based on an inquiry conducted by the Inspection Division in January,
1075, inquirlng into the “Official and Confidential” files of former Director
J. Edgar soover and subsequent inquiries made by the Inspection Division
concerning these papers, this Time Magazine article set forth an allegation
which had not previously come to the attention of the FBI. Accordingly,
inquiry was made concerning this allegation in order to advise both the
Director of the FBI and the Attorney General aa to whether there was any
validity to the allegation.

4, Which Division or operating level (Readquarters or field)
conducted the inspection or investigation?

The Inspection Division, FBI Headquarters.

5. bow was the decision made as to which Division or operating
jevel was to conduct the inspection or investigation?

An article appeared inthe January 19, 1975, issue cf The Washington
Post which in part stated the FBI "during J. Edgar Hoover's reign” compiled
files containing information on the personal lives of senators and congressmen.

U. &. Senate Select Committee to
Study Governmental Cperations with
Respect to Intelligence Activities (SSC)

On January 21, 1975, FBI Director Kelley instructed the Inspection Division
to conduct inquiry concerning the "Official and Confidential" files of Mir.
hoover. The results of that inquiry were submitted ta the Attorney General
by memorandum dated February 11, 1975.

The allegation set forth in the Time Liagazine article dated
December 15, 1975, and the reference to “sensitive papers" being taken.
frora Mr. Hoover's house appeared to be alluding to Nir. Hoover's "Official
and Confidential" files. The Inspection Division, having previously been
charged with responsibility of conducting inquiry concerning these particular
files, initiated action on its own to resolve this latest allegation.

6 Was the original allegation reported to the Attorney General
or any other Department of Justice official?

Yes, by letter to the Attorney General dated December 24, 1975.
Delivered with this memorandura is the back-up documentation.

%. Were the results of the inspection or investigation reported
to the Attorney General or any other Department of Justice official?

Yes. See response to question number 6 above.

8. Was prosecution or administrative action @.z., suspension
or dismissal) considered or taken’?

The inquiry failed to develop evidence in support of the allegation
eoncerning the alleged transportation and destruction of "sensitive papers."
Accordingly, no further action was warranted.

NOTE: A copy of referenced letter is attached to yellow of instant LHM.
Material being supplied to the SSC will be delivered with this LHM by Legal
Counsel Division. A set of such material is being retained by the Senstudy
75 Project.

Dear Mike: : 7 2

One of the subjects which the Committee will be address-
ing in preparing its legislative recommendations involves
the adequacy of the FBI's inspection procedures for handling
allegations of misconduct and abuse. in this regard we are
forwarding herewith a list of several such allegations which

. have been made during the past few years and concerning each
of which we would appreciate your supplying us with the
following information:

1. How did FBI Headquarters first become aware of
the allegation?

2. Was an investigation or inspection conducted?
If not, was any other action taken?

3. How was the decision made to conduct (or not to
conduct) an inspection or investigation, or to take
s (or not to take) other action?

4. Which Division, or operating level (headquarters
or field), conducted the inspection or investigation?

5. How was the decision made as to which Division or
operating level was to conduct the inspection or
investigation?

6. Was the original allegation reported to the Attorney
General or any other Department of Justice official?

7. Were ‘the results of the inspection or investi-
gation reported to the Attorney General or any
Other Department of Justice official? :

8. Was prosecution or administrative action (e.g.,.
* -suspension or dismissal) considered or taken?

9. If any of the allegations on the attached list
af were made today, would they be handled by the
cena : . newly-created office of Professional Responsibility?
In what manner would they be handled? If an investi-
. gation were deemed warranted, which agency's personnel
would do the investigating. In this regard; please
also advise concerning which agency's personnel will
be investigating recently-reported allegations that
agents of the FBI "attempted to coerce" a House
Select Committee on Intelligence witness “into
repudiating his testimony before the select panel."

Answers to questions 1 - 7 should be accompanied by full
- back-up documentation, including memoranda, inspection or
investigative reports, 302's,personnel reports, and communi-
cations to and from the field.

Your continued cooperation is appreciated.

Memorandum

J, EDGAR HOOVER

Reference is made to my memorandum captioned "United
States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities," dated July 16,
1975, with enclosures setting forth results of our inquiry into the dis-
position of files maintained in the office of former Director J. Edgar
Hoover.

Time magazine dated December 15, 1975, on pages 10, 11,
and 12, had an article captioned "Hoover's Political Spying for Presidents
Within ‘this article, and specifically on page 11, column 3, paragraph 2,
the article states:

shaygia jou
Gag wok

"Before Secretary Gandy could look at them in Hoover's
house, the most sensitive papers were carried off in an FBI
truck to West Virginia’s Blue Ridge Club, a Shenandoah Mountain
hideaway used by innermost FBI officials for regular poker games
with CIA and other cronies. There the papers were burned in
the club's large fireplace. Precisely who ordered this destruc-
tion and carried it out has not been disclosed. The three-story
club, valued at up to $200, 000, burned to the ground in a fire
of undetermined cause on Nov. 23. No evidence of arson has
been discovered."

* The Attorney General

Investigation was conducted by the FBI concerning this
Particular allegation appearing in Time magazine.

On December 16, 1975, Mrs. Hulda Weese, Route 9, Sweet
. Springs Community, Loudoun County, Virginia, was interviewed at her
residence and advised she had been the caretaker and cook at the Blue
Ridge Rod and Gun Club located in Loudoun County, Virginia, since
April 8, 1971. She stated that on that date she and her family moved
into the residence at the club and she resided continuously at thai location
until November 23, 1975, when the club was destroyed by fire.

Mrs. Weese was questioned concerning the allegation appearing
in the above-cited Time magazine article to the effect that an FBI truck
had delivered certain records to the club which were then destroyed in.
the club's fireplace. Mrs. Weese stated that it would have been virtually
impossible for anyone to'have-destroyed records‘in any of the three fire-
places of the club without her knowledge because she and hér family resided
at the club on a continuous basis since April, 1971. She also advised she _
was the only one who had keys to the front and back doors of the clubhouse
and pointed out that as caretaker one of her responsibilities was to insure
: that only members or guests accompanied by members were allowed
| admittance to the clubhouse. Mrs. Weese stated that there was an iron
ce fence located across the driveway approximately 60 yards from the club-
house which was kept locked at all times except when members were present
atthe club, Mrs. Weese also commented that she had four watchdogs at
the club who were very alert for the presence of strangers or in fact any-
one. She advised that one of her responsibilities was to keep the fireplaces
elean at the clubhouse which she did and at no time did she observe any-
thing in the fireplaces indicating that any records Kad been destroyed.

Mrs. Weese stated emphatically that at no time did anyone come to the
club and burn records in the fireplaces or anywhere else.

Concerning the fire at the club on November 23, 1975
Mrs. Weese stated she had lett the club for a short period of time to per-
form an errand and left behind her son and some of her friends at the club-
house. She related that at approsimately 4:00 p.m. her son observed
smoke coming from the attic of the club around the windows and chimney
and her son alerted the other occupants of the clubhouse as well as the
local fire department. She stated that a number of tire departments
responded to the fire but were unable to extinguish the fire with any degree

of success, She continued that a fire marshal, one Oliver Dube, was
present on the scene and when she questioned him as to the cause of the <.. |
fire he advised that it had apparently been an accident and was probably” —
caused by defective electrical wiring in the building,

On December 16, 1975, Oliver R. Dube, Fire Marshal,
- Loudoun County Fire and Rescue Service, Leesburg, Virginia, was inter-
- Viewed concerning this particular fire and stated he responded io the scene
* within one hour of its having started, had examined the ruins, and had
“come to the conclusion the fire was of "accidental origin." Mr. Dube
advised that his investigation had not been concluded as yet but felt sure
the fire started because of defective electrical wiring in an area near
the ceiling level of the first floor. He volunteered he did not observe
anything at the scene or find any evidence indicating the fire was caused
by arson, :

On December 17, ibts, Mr, John P. Mohr, former Assistant
“to the Director, FBI (now retired), advised in response to our request for
an interview with him concerning the allegation in this matter that he had
- already testified with regard to the disposal of Mr, Hoover's papers
before the Subcommittee, headed by Chairperson Bella Abzug, and thought
that his testimony in this regard should suffice. Mr. Mohr further advised
that he had contacted his attorney, Mr, Brian Gettings, who is representing
him in connection with matters relating to the FBI involving U. S. Recording
_ Company and Mr, Hoover's files, and ‘his attorney had counseled him not
* to be interviewed in connection therewith. In proffering his declination to-.
be interviewed in this regard, Mr. Mohr orally advised that he had nothing
whatsoever to do with taking any files as alleged and was highly incensed
that such an allegation should be made,

Concerning the above information, I wish to refer to my memo-
randum to you captioned "John P, Mohr, former Assistant to the Director,"
dated December 22, 1975, wherein I furnished you with results of a dis-
cussion I had with Sandy Smith of Time magazine on December 19. 1975
In my memorandum I pointed out under item 4 that Smith made reference
to the "Blue Ridge Club"-and Smith's feeling that this club was the place
where Mr. Hoover's records were burned shortly after Mr, Hoover's
death, :

DETAILS

a On April 15,1975, GUILLERMO SOWERS, also known
fas PETE SOWERS, was interviewed by SA FORD W. COLE, at which time |
he furnished the following information in part:

SOWERS said that one of the reasons that JAMES
NAGI was “killed was due to the fact it was believed NAGI was talking
to the police. SOWERS said that he heard from TROPIANO and CUTOLO
that NAGI was aware of the existence of other "connections" the mob
had within law enforcement.

One such individual was a JOE "STUBS" or "STOPS",
an FBI agent in New York. JOE "STOPS" reportedly had provided
information to organized crime people regarding impending gambling
charges against JOE COLQMBO before any indictments came out. SOWERS
learned of the existence of JOE "STOPS" sometime in 1972. Later, in
1973, when NAGI was still an accepted associate, he was having a
problem in a Federal hijacking matter. CUTOLO and SOWERS were dis-
cussing this at a restaurant in Brooklyn. SOWERS stated, "Why don't j
you see what JOE *STOPS' can do?" CUTOLO responded that JOE "STOPS" 4
was not longer able to help, as he has been sent to Massachusetts. q

JOE "STOPS", according to SOWERS, was not the type
who was available to "nothing guys", but was contacted by the "big
guys", like CHARLIE PANARELLA from Staten Island. Another individual,
supposedly in the FBI, who SOWERS was told was proving information j
was someone named "ADAMS". He heard of this individual in February, - 4

i

1974, One of the reasons SOWERS became an informant was that he “>
feared performing a hit on NICKY "BOOTS" CAPUTO for TROPIANO and
CUTOLO.

"I, Guillermo Sowers, being duly swofn, hereby make the
following free and voluntary statement to Clark Brown and Edward D. oti
Hegarty who have identified themselves to me as employees of the Federal. Hl
7 Bureau of Investigation and have advised me the purpose of the interview i

. I recall having a conversation during the early summer of 1972
with George Tropiano, William Cutolo and James Nagi regarding a
problem Nagi was having with law enforcement in New Jersey regarding
a hijacking or a kidnapping or possession of a shotgun or some other
crime, Cutolo asked Tropiano about 'Joe Staps or Stubbs' Tropiano left
to make a telephone call, When Tropiano returned he told Nagi he would
try to help him out, On the following day Cutolo, in my presence, gave
Nagi a piece of paper which bore the name, as I now recall, Joseph
Stambile' or ‘Joseph Stabile) or something like that. The piece of paper
also bore a telephone number, Cutolo told Nagi to call this person and
make an appointment to discuss his, Nagi's problem. Cutolo told Nagi

it would cost him, Nagi, a few dollars. I don't think Tropiano was pregent
on this second occasion. I think both of these conversations took place at
‘Burger Prince, 'a restaurant at 65th and 8th Ave., Brooklyn, N.Y., during
the early afternoon. Cutolo was anxious to help Nagi because Nagi had just
éompleted a $22,000.00 score for Cutolo and Tropiano. The score was an
armed robberyof the Co-Op Supermarket, Bronx, N.Y., in May 1972. On
the first occasion Cutolo described 'Joe Stubbs' as a Federal Agent, i

"Subsequent to the above two occasions I was involved with Cutolo,
.Tropiano and six or seven other persons including Andy Carlisi, Anthony
Villaroll and Greg who was a fence at 76th St and 13th Ave, in Brooklyn,
a little discount store. Greg was a white male about late 30's or 40's,
58"~10", Italian background, Mario Tropiano was also involved; 'The
Greek' who was arrested for. shooting someone at Tiffany's: Diner about
two or 3 years ago; 'The Greek's' brother who is a foreman at a downtown
pier. This group was active in hijacking during the summer of 1972 in the
area of 39th St. and 2ad Ave., Brooklyn, N, Y.; JFK Airport; and 'Greenpoint'
ucking terminal in Brooklyn, N.Y.; and at Cooper and Jarrett (phonetic)
im New Jersey. Cutolo furnished me a handwritten list of New York State
license tags, 4 cars and two trucks or 5 cars and two trucks, and told me
to watch for them because they were being used by ‘The Feds.' The list
included the type of car, color and license tag number, The cars were
Plymouth, Ford and Dates. One of the trucks was a former telephone
repair panel truck painted black, The second truck was a three-quarter
~ panel truck which bore the name 'Emery Air Freight’ and was painted white
with blue lettering.

"On several occasions I I spotted several of the cars at the piers,
39th St. and 2nd Avenue area when I was planning a hijacking. Villaroll,
Nagi, Carlisi and some of the others also spotted some of these cars when
they were with me. Inever saw these cars at JFK Airport. Inever saw
the black panel truck. About 25 or 30 times during the summer of 1972 I
saw the Emery Air Freight truck at JFK Airport, air freight section, the
area of 39th and 2nd Avenue, Brooklyn and around the Barger Prince
Restaurant, Every time I saw the truck-there were 2 guys in it; always
the same two. One of thesetwo was about 5' 10", 200 pounds, late 30's
or 40's, brown hair, Irish appearance, the second guy was white male

. also and he was in his mid-thirties, 5' 8", 160 pounds,

- . . "When Cutolo gave me the list of vehicles he told me that he got
it from this friend, the Fed,' I think Villaroll, Nagi, Carlisi and some of
the others involved in the actual hijackings saw Cutolo give the list to me
at the Burger Prince... - :

“"Around April or May or sometime in the first half of 1974 I pad
“a conversation with Cutolo and L think, but am uncertain, thatGeorge ~
Tropiano was also present. On this occasion Cutolo said that his ‘connection!’
and by ‘connection! I bélieve he was refering to 'Joe Stubbs' was originally
'Yoe Gentile's also known as ‘Joe Lane's’ connection. On other occasions
“during 1974 Cutolo told me that 'Colombo' had received information regarding ~
an indictment of Colombo before the indictment was returned, Cutolo
indicated that he, Cutolo, obtained this information from "The Fed' and
passed it on to Colombo.

"On Saturday June 15, 1974, George Tropiano, Cutolo and I had
- aconversation at Burger Prince, Tropiano said that he had received a
_telephone call that Nagi was either cooperating with or was going to
cooperate with the Nadjari Commission and that we would have to kill Nagi
within the next two days. On June 17, 1974 Nagi was murdered. About a
month Jater Cutolo told me that he either called 'Joe' who was ‘in Boston’
or he was going to call 'Jo¢ and tell him that he, Cutolo, ‘took care of the
problem* and that he, Cutolo was going to see him, Cutolo also said that
'Zos" was no longer in town and was then in "Massachusetts, '

"YT recall that in about May of 1974 James Nagi and I had 2 con-
versation in a corridor of the Bronx Court House, 161st Street and Grand
Concourse, Nagi was planning a shakedown of someone whom he did not
name, Nagi wanted ‘silencers’ some ‘badges' that I previously had in my
‘possession, Two of these badges were FBI badges and two New York City
Police Department Detective Shields. I had obtained these 4 badges from
Cutolo who obtained them from George Tropiano, according to Cutolo. -
Linda Nagi, wife of James Nagi, was present and she might have overheard

. the conversation. James Nagi said when I told Him I didn't have the badges
any longer, that he would have to see 'Joe’ and would have to 'go out of
town," Linda Nagi is a white female, mid 20's, 5' 8", wears glasses and
operates a beauty salon around Lucas and Clifton Streets, Brooklyn, N.Y.

FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

z
Dato of transcription _ 5/6/75,

Mr. GUILLERMO SOWERS was interviewed at the New York Off#te
of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, 201 East 69th Street,
‘New York, N. Y. 10024. At the outset of the interview, both
Special Agent Pearce and Special Agent Rohr identified themselves
as Special Agents of the FBI. Then Special Agent Pearce advised
SOWERS that thé purpose of the interview was to question him in
detail about any knowledge that he may have regarding any member
of the Federal law enforcement establishment being connected
with any criminal group operating in the City of New York. Mr.
SOWERS then fuynished the information set out below:

SOWERS was born in Havana, Cuba, leaving there for the
“ United States in 1959 in order to take up permanent residence in
« Miami; Florida. In 1961, he joined the U. S. Marine Corps
and was discharged honorably on November 16, 1963. From his
last duty station in Quantico, Va., he returned to Miami, where
he remained for several years working in various supermarkets.
In 1967, he left Miami and went to New York City. There he again
began working at various jobs and different supermarkets. In
197Iy while he was so employed he met an Associated Foods
truck driver named ANDY CARLISI. CARLISI and SOWERS soon worked
out a scheme whereby they would leave a certain number of cases
containing groceries on CARLISI's truck at the time of delivery.
CARLISI then sold these cases and divided the- profit with
SOWERS. In addition to this scheme, SOWERS and CARLISI had a
method whereby they were able to defraud the off-track betting
company for several tHousand dollars every week.

*. At some point during their association, CARLISI told SOWERS
about his friends BILLY CUTOLO and GEORGE TROPIANO, who CARLISI
described as members of the COLOMBO "family" of La Cosa Nostra (LCN).
‘In early April CARLISI arranged to introdtiice SOWERS to WILLIAM CUTOLO.
The introduction was made at the cocktail lounge of the Leader
Bowling Alley on Coney Island Avenue and 18th Street, Brooklyn, N.Y.
Present at this meeting were WILLIAM CUTOLO, ANDY CARLISI and SOWERS.
Also in the lounge, but not participating in the meeting, were

three other people identified to SOWERS as JIM NAGI, ANTHONY

. VILLEROEL and NAGI's girlfriend. At this time, SOWERS was employed
as the manager of a supermarket in Coop-City, Bronx, New York.

CUTOLO proposed that SOWERS provide him with enough informatfon

of, the operation at this store so one of CUTOLO's men could hold up
the cashier when there was a large quantity of money in the
cashier’ s office. SOWERS provided CUTOLO with the necessary
information and then demanded to be given $10,000.00 in advance-
for any cooperation in the planned holdup. At one or more meetings

held after ths one, SOWERS was introduced to CUTOLO's boss

GEORGE TROPIANO. This meeting took place at the Burger Prince
located on 65th and 8th Avenue, Brooklyn, New York. On none

of these meetings was the holdup and SOWERS demand for $10,000

discussed. On April 19, 1972, JIM NAGI and ANDY VILLEROEL held up
saat supermarket where SOWERS was working and escaped with over
20,000.00.

Subsequent to this holdup SOWERS went to the Burger Prince
at 65th and 8th Avenue, Brooklyn; N.Y., and demanded his share
of the.holdup from GEORGE TROPIANO. TROPIANO told him that
the money had already been split and that there was nothing left
for him. TROPIANO did extend an invitation to SOWERS that he
jgity his group and participate in further jobs with them. Since
SOWERS had been fired by the supermarket and was now unemployed
he agreed to join TROPIANO's group.

Shortly after this meeting, SOWERS also learned that NAGI
had only turned $16,000.00 of the money robbed from the super-
market over to CUTOLO,and TROPIANO.- Out of this $16,000.00, NAGI
was given a cut of $2,500.00. SOWERS did not know if either
CUTOLO or TROPIANO were aware that NAGI and VILLEROEL had held
out about $5,000.00 on them.

At the time that SOWERS joined the TROPIANO group he impersonated

‘PETE CATENA, nephew of GERRY CATENA, an LCN leader. CUTOLO

and TROPIANO made inquiries about him and then accepted him

in their group. This took place sometime in early June 1972.

After SOWERS had been accepted in the group, NAGI, CUTOLO and
TROPIANO and SOWERS were standing outside the Burger Prince,

when NAGI began complaining about a problem he was having with

the law in New Jersey. - NAGI said that the problem arose out of

an arrest some time ago for hijacking, robbery and possession of .

a weapon. NAGI asked CUTOLO and TROPIANO if they could do
‘something for him in this matter. Specifically, NAGI wanted to
know what was going on in the case. CUTOLO turned to TROPIANO

and asked him, "What about our friend? You know Joe, the Fed.

Maybe he can help". TROPIANO told CUTOLO that he would see what

he could do and then went into the Burger Prince to use the

public telephone located there. CUTO@LO, NAGI and SOWERS also

went into the Burger Prince. CUTOLO went behind the service counter
while NAGI and SOWERS remained on the other side.

After TROPIANO finished?his telephone call, he had a short private
conversation with CUTOLO and then went outside. CUTOLO.came back to
where NAGI and SOWERS were standing and took out his wallet. from
the wallet he removed a small card, about the size of a regular
business card. Then he picked up a napkin and wrote the name(JQSEPH
STAMBILE or ZABILE,) as well as a telephone number on this
napkin. CUTOLO used a black felt tipped pen to write down the name
and numbers. Some of the letters in the last name ran together when
they were written on the napkin. After CUTOLO had finished writing
the name and the telephone number, he handed it to NAGI and told him
to call this guy and arrange to meet him somewhere where they can't
be observed. NAGI would then have to explain his problem to this
person and perhaps this individual could help him. . SOWERS in answer
‘to specific questions stated that he did not know if a meeting
between NAGI and the individual, whose name had been placed on the
paper(STAMBILE or STABILE,) ever took place. NAGI never told him
that avmeeting took place. The only reason he knew NAGI had a
problem with a case in New Jersey was because NAGI said so. In
answer to a specific question, SOWERS said that this was the only.
occasion that the complete name (JOSEPH STAMBILE or JOSEPH STABILE)
ever was used. SOWERS said that thereafter, when talking about
their alleged contact, CUTOLO or GEORGE TROPIANO would use the name

JOR Dhe Fed, JOE STUBS or similar name. They never used JOE singularly .

as there were a lot of JOES involved in the CUTOLO-GEORGE TROPIANO
operation. SOWERS assumed that CUTOLO, ane Gone or JIMMY NAGI, when

referring to JOB The Fed ox JOE STUBS meant(GQSEPH STAMBILE on JOSEPH

STABILE)) even though SOWERS was_never told that thése nicknames stn in

reference to the complete name(JOSEPH STAMBILE ox JOSEPH STABILE.

After joining TROPIANO's group, SOWERS was put to work as the
driver for a hijack group operating primarily in the Brooklyn .area.
Included in this group were NAGI, VILLEROEL and CARLISI. Prior to
taking off on what was either the second or third job in which he
participated, CUTOLO furnished SOWERS with,a list of cars, trucks, and
license numbers used by Federal law enforcement agents. When CUTOLO
gave SOWERS this list, SOWERS and the others were in the Burger Prince
CUTOLO produced the list from his wallet and copied it on a napkin
which he then gave to SOWERS. The list contained the descriptions
of three cars and two trucks, as well as the license numbers. The
cars were listed as a blue Ford, green or brown Plymouth and a
blue Dodge, all’with New York State license tags. One truck was
described as an old telephone truck painted black, the other was
a white truck with Emery Air Freight painted on the side. The
trucks also had New York license plates. CUTOLO bragged that he
had obtained this list from his friend JOE The Fed and then told
SOWERS that he should be alert for these cars when going out on any
hijack job. When he was in the car en route to the hijack’ job,
SOWERS gave the identities of these cars and -trucks to the other
men in his group and asked them to be’on the lookout for these
particular vehicles.

CUTOLO and TROPIANO sold a lot of the hijack loads that they
had to a fence named GREGG SCARPA. SCARPA operated a discount
store on 76th and 13th Avenue, Brooklyn, N.Y. During 1972,

“SOWERS met SCARPA at his store on three different occasions. # At
each ‘of these meetings SOWERS was in the company of GEORGE TROPIANO.
At one such meeting, which concerned itself with a load of liquor
from Montreal, a man dressed in a business suit came into the

store in order to talk to SCARPA. The man, who came in to see
SCARPA was a white male in his late 30s and gave the impression

of being some type of law enforcement officer. On several other
occasions ‘when TROPIANO had to see SCARPA, SOWERS drove him to

the store but was told to remain in the car while TROPIANO met with . |
SCARPA.

t -

SOWERS continued to work for CUTOLO and TROPIANO until the ie
- end of 1972, when he broke away from them, In January 1974, H
JAMES. NAGI contacted SOWERS and told him that he had been given
a contract by CUTOLO and TROPIANO to kill SOWERS. In order to
avoid being. killed by NAGI, SOWERS went to see CUTOLO and TROPIANO
in order to ask for another chance and to find out why the order
to. execute him had been given. TROPIANO and CUTOLO did not
explain why he was to be killed but did take him back into their {
SEOUuP SOWERS continued to work for CUTOLO and TROPIANO throughout j
174’ and eventually became the leader of his own criminal group 7
under the supervision of CUTOLO and TROPIANO. +Htal

As soon as he began working for CUTOLO and TROPIANO, CUTOLO began |
telling him about his connection JOE The Fed. In March or April 1974, |
TROPIANO, who had a problem relating to a current court case, wanted
to find out what was yoing to happen in this case and told CUTOLO
in front of SOWERS that he would have to go see JOE The Fed, in order
to find out what's going on. As a rule when CUTOLO and TROPIANO talked |
about this connection they either called him JOE, JOE The Fed or JOE ;
STUBS. It was SOWERS impression that in this conversation and in ;
-others relating to this individual, when TROPIANO and CUTOLO referred |
to JOE, JOE The Fed or JOE_STUBS that they were talking aboutGJOSEPH
STAMBILE or JOSEPH STABILE,) whose name he had seen on the piece o

paper given to NAGI by CUTOLO in 1972.

. In 1974, CUTOLO and TROPIANO were involved in a smuggling opera~ |
tion where they smuggled cigarettes and liquor into New York from North.)
Carolina. Part of the liquor was sold in New York City, while another
part was sent to a buyer in Bridgeport, Conn. This buyer cheated’ i
CUTOLO and TROPIANO out of $45,000.00 in the sale of this liquor. }
SOWERS was sent to Bridgeport in order to speak with this individual ;
and to recover CUTOLO's and TROPIANO's money. Prior to the time A
that he was going to Bridgeport, SOWERSws asked by CUTOLO to tell him
when hé was going to Bridgeport because he, CUTOLO, wanted to go with
him because he could go to see JOE The Fed in Boston, Massachusetts.

r

PERK RRSP REPret

Also about this time in early 1974, TROPIANO and CUTOLO came up
with a scheme to shake down one of the men who was buying the liquor
they were smuggling into New York City. In order to carry out

12

NW,68262.Docld:32989576 Page.89..



q :
this shakedown scheme, SOWERS and several other men

were to pose as police officers and demand that the men pay

them for their silence in the smuggling case. CUTOLO or TROETANO
furnished SOWERS with a small box containing a bag in which were
five -police shields, four polite ID cards and two sets of FBI
identification cards. The FBI identification cards consisted

of two parts that folded, one over the other. One side of the
ecards had the*blue letters FBI printed on it. The other side

had U.S. Department of Justice printed on it in smaller blue
letters. Neither CUTOLO, nor TROPIANO ever told SOWERS where they
had obtained the badges and identification cards.

After he'had received these badges and identification cards,

SOWERS began to carry a police badge and identification card
- on his person until he was stopped by the police. At this time, he
had to throw the identification card and badge away in order to
avoid an arrest for impersonating a police officer. Shortly
after this, TROPIANO told SOWERS to return the badges and
identification cards because the shakedown deal was off. JIM NAGI
found out about these badges and identification cards because
SOWERS showed him the badge and identification card that he was
using. In May, 1974, NAGI approached SOWERS and asked him
£6% the badges and identification cards, which he needed to pull
a shakedown job of his own. SOWERS told him that he could
not give him these badges and identification cards because
GEORGE TROPIANO had already taken them back. ~

" From NAGI, SOWERS also got the impression that he, NAGI,
had been in touch with JOE The Fed, because NAGI told him that he
would have to go see JOE The Fed in Boston, Massachusetts.
SOWERS was not told why NAGI would have to contact JOE The Fed
at Boston, Baseachusetts.
: From his conversations with TROPIANO’ and NAGI, SOWERS
learned that beginning in 1973, NAGI had been designated to
pay off law enforcement officials who were cooperating with and
furnishing information to CUTOLO and TROPIANO. NAGI told
SOWERS that he tape recorded a number of these pay-offs and -
was using the recordings s a blackmail tool against the police
official who was being paid off. SOWERS was also told by CUTOLO
that JOE The Fed or JOE STUBS was being paid one to five .
thousand dollars per month depending upon the quality and amount
of information he furnished.

On June 15, 1974, a short time after naci had been ca
arrested by the Nadjari Commission, TROPIANO came into the Burger
Prince and told CUTOLO and SOWERS that he had just received a
telephone call from’ one of his connections. This individual
told him that NAGI had made a deal with NADJARI and was going to
reveal all ofatheir law enforcement connections to NADJARI.
TROPIANO also told them that they could not afford to let this
happen and that he had received a green light to kill NAGI
at once. - :

After NAGI had been killed, SOWERS asked TROPIANO why
he had acted so hastily without ever giving NAGI a chance to
square himself. TROPIANO told SOWERS that it just had to be
done in this way. At this time TROPIANO also told SOWERS that
* he would have to call JOE in Boston and tell him that everything
was alright.

After the NADJARI incident, CUTOLO and TROPIANO told SOWERS
that they had been called on the carpet for allowing NAGI to meet
and pay their law enforcement connections. Now all the law
erfdrcement connections, as well as the blackmail efforts
against them, was to be handled by an attorney ALBERT ARRONE.

During the year 1974, CUTOLO engaged in-a number of
conversations in which CUTOLO freely talked about his connection
JOE The Fed. In one conversation, he said that JOE was taken
out of town and couldw't be contacted here anymore. However,
JOE would now be working with Whitey Tropiano's men in Bridge-
port and New Haven. CUTOLO also told SOWERS that JOE STUBS or
JOE The Fed was orginally a connection for GREG SCARPA, JOE LANE
and an individual known as DUTCHIE. In July 1974, SOWERS was
.present when TROPIANO held a meeting with’ CHARLIE "MOOSE"
PANARELLA at the Sheepshead Bay Athletic Club. CHARLIE wanted
to have some information about a bug that he suspected had
been planted either at his house or some place that he frequented.
TROPTANO told PANARELLA that he could check this out with his
friend JOE. :

On another occasion in 1974, CUTOLO and TROPIANO, as well
- as SOWERS were in the Red Manor at 60th and lith Avenue; Brooklyn,
New York. CUTOLO began talking about a JOE with TROPIANO,
when TROPIANO asked him which JOE he was talking about. CUTOLO
then told TROPIANO, "You know, our friend Joe The Fed, Joe Stubs".

the name(#0SEPE STAMBTLE ox STABILE) The only name they used
- to describe their Federal law enforcement connection was JOE#
JOE The Fed, or JOE STUBS. Other than the above 3 individuals,

no one ever discussed JOE The Fed, or JOB STUBS with SOWERS.

ry SOWERS originally furnished the information regarding JOE
The Fed to Dekective NULTY of the New York City Police Department
but-he does not recall if NULTY made a record of having been
furnished this information.

SOWERS was given a napkin and black felt tipped pen by
“Special AgenttRohr and asked to write the name that he had
seen WILLIAM CUTOLO write on a napkin for JAMES NAGI in 1972.
. SOWERS then wrote the name (JOSEPH STABILE, JOSEPH STAMBILE )and
- JOSEPH STATILE on a paper napkin. To the best of his recollection,
* SOWERS stated ‘that the name(JOSEPH STAMBILE)is what he actually
saw CUTOLO write on the napkin.

Upon arriving in New York, the truck was parked in a parking lot
at Pennsylvania and Flatland Avenue, where it was then picked up
and brought to another location by other individuals, not known

an improper or in an unlawful manner. She said that her husband
rarely ever discussed his activities or his associates with her, and

time, was a divorcee and began dating GUILLERMO SOWERS. He told her
that he was Italian, having been born at Milan, Italy. Subsequentiy,
she entertained GUILLERMO SOWERS at her home and introduced SOWERS

he told each of them tat he was Italian and was born in Milan, Italy.
When they applied for a marriage license, he stated on the application
that” he was born in Milan, Italy.

Subsequent to her marriage, she learned that he. was not

Italian and was not born in Milan, Italy, but is a Cuban, having been
born in Havana, Cuba. She stated that she told this to her mother,
who is very dissatisfied with her husband GUILLERMO, because he lied
to her, Mrs. SOWERS and to members of Mrs. SOWERS' immediate family.
She was asked if her husband gave her any other indications of deceit-
fulness and she said that occasionally she has suspected that he was
withholding money from her and on some occasions she was of the belief

On 5/12/75, I telephonically contacted RICHARD ARTHUR,

Director, National Twaining Center for Polygraph Sciences,

1199 Medical Arts Building, 57 West 57th Street, New York, N. Y.

10019, PL 5-5241, to arrange for a review of polygraph charts
- O£ GUILLERMO SOWERS.

I informed Mr. ARTHUR, who is acquainted with Special
Agent Pearce, that the New York Office of the FBI had obtained:
the approval of BARRY FRIEDMAN, Chief, Rackets Division,
Brooklyn, N. Y¥., District Attorney's Office for the FBI to review
* these Charts. Mr. ARTHUR was also advised that the FBI was not
7 investigating the murder case involving SOWERS.

ARTHUR volunteered that he was furnishing information
"from memory", and believed that the polygraph examination of
SOWERS that he conducted was about 4 months ago. He said that
he had run SOWERS a second time because the Brooklyn District
Attorney's Office was so convinced that SOWERS was "telling the
truth’, ARTHUR was informed that information received by the
FBI was to the effect that SOWERS was telling the truth when he
placed himself in a confession at the scene of a murder.
ARTHUR indicated that his recollection was that the polygraph
. examination indicated that SOWERS did more than place himself ~
at the scene. He said he never "liked the story" that SOWERS
confessed to. SOWERS, according to ARTHUR, claimed that he came
through a doorway, heatd a shot, saw the victim fall, but would
not say that he saw the guy fire the gun. :

ARTHUR, early in the conversation, volunteered that it
was his opinion that SOWERS dtempted to beat the polygraph.
His recollection was that SOWERS attempted’ to do this by altering
his normal breathing pattern, to show a breathing pattern of
approximately ten breaths a minute. Arrangements were made for
a physical review of these charts in question on 5/13/75 through
contact of ARTHUR's associate, GENE SAUDAZZ, as ARTHUR will be
absent from his office.

” RICHARD ARTHUR, Director, National Training Center for
“Polygraph Sciénces, 1109 Medical Arts Building, 57 West
‘ 57th Street, New York, New York 10019, I was given the file
Sou review involving polygraph examinations of GUILLERIMO
WERS. |

There were two reports in letter form of approximately
one and one-half page indicating that SOWERS had been afforded
an original polygraph examination on December 31, 1974 and
had been re-examined on January 9, 1975. as

i " Both reports indicated that the main issue under’

° ‘consideration in the polygraph examination was the truth
telling involving SOWERS when he made certain claims regarding
the murder of JAMES NAGI.

The December 31, 1974 report indicated that facts
of the murder and SOWERS participation had been provided
~ to the polygraph examiners by ANGELO TONA and WILLIAM WASESKI
of the Kings County District Attorney's Office. Further,
that these individuals were present during the interview.
The polygraph examiners were -RIGHARD 0. APTHUR and DORT J.

On December ‘31, 1974 reports indicated that SOWERS i
had lied to the’ following questions:

1. "Did you shoot JIM NAGI?"
- Answer: "Yo." :

2. "Did you see GEORGE TROPIANO shoot JIM NAGI?"
38

Answer: "Yes." .

The exact phrasing of the polygraph examination
opinion read, "It is the opinion of the polygraphist based
upon the examination of Mr. SOWERS that he has not probably
told. si entire truth of the above listed questions."

2. "Did you see BILLY CUTOLO shoot JIMMY NAGI?"

‘fhe report advised that it was the opinion of
the polygraphist, based upon the polygraph charts, that
Mr, SOWERS, in regards to the above questions, was telling
the truth. It went on and stated that this opinion nust be

distort the polygraph readings." It was also indicated
‘that this distortion greatly interferes with the correct

rds

diagnosis and chart analysis of the polygraph records.

The report. of the “re-examination” of GUILLERMO
SOWERS in 1975 indicates again that ANGELO TONA and
WILLIAM WAJESKI, Kings County District Attorney's Office,
’ Brooklyn, New York, were the examiners. The same questions
: were used in this re-examination and the report reads,
“Shere were indications of lying when SOWERS was asked the
following pertinent questions: ,

1. "Did you shoot JIM NAGI?"

Answer: "No." : -
i 2. "Did you see -GEORGE TROPIANO shoot sIM NAGI?""

_ Answer: "Yes."

. It was the polygraphist's opinion that SOWERS has

SOWERS was telling the truth to the above questions.

Again it was indicated that both polygraph examine-
tions were conducted by RICHARD 0. ARTHUR and DORI J. PRARI.

It was also indicated that SOWERS had voluntarily. ©
signed a boretderst to take both the original and re-examination.

: A review of the charts in question showed that in
the fourth series, December, 1974, of questions SOWERS
deliberately attempted to alter his normal breathing pattern
by deliberately breathing at a reduced rate. The efforts to
alter the polygraph charts are readily recognized. This slowed
rate of breathing was not present in any of the other polygranh
charts, and particularly it was noted it was not present during
the period when the polygraph examinationws being initiated.

. Subject at the time of instrument adjustment remains Sahaenil
and no questions are being asked.

". FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

5/21/75
ANGELO TONA, Special Prosecutor, New York State Nursing and

Social Services, Investigations Unit, Rooin 973, Ellicott Square.
Byilding, Buffalo, New York, advised that while serving as an
Assistant District Attorney for Kings County, Brooklyn, N. Y.,
he had handled the homicide investigation of JAMES NAGI. He
stated in connection with this investigation, PETE SOWERS had
been developed as a possible suspect due to his close relation-
ship with NAGI but that initial interviews with SOWERS had been
completely negative. He said, however, that one Saturday morning
SOWERS came to him saying he wanted to cooperate since he felt
he was going to be arrested for NAGI's murder and also that

- he thought there was a contract out for him. :

Ae bos ewer te + Date of transcription

He said over a period of time from that day, SOWERS furnished
voluminous information concerning various planned crimes and
cooperated by meeting with various individuals connected with
these crimes while wearing a body recorder. He said it was
some time before SOWERS discussed the NAGI homicide but eventually
did~furnish them with sufficient information to place charges
against GEORGE TROPIANO and BILLY CUTOLO. He described SOWERS
as being the type of individual who had a great wealth of
information concerning triminal activities of all sorts and
that this information would be furnished by tim piecemeal over
an extended period of time. He said that during the entire
relationship with SOWERS he had no reason to question his
credibility, stating in many instances they had been able to
completely verify information furnished by SOWERS concerning
criminal activities of various individuals.

He said one problem, however, he did encounter in dealing
-with SOWERS was the fact that he tended to arrive at conclusions
from certain information in his possession, which conclusions
were not based on fact. He also stated that in evaluating
SOWERS information one had to always assess the source of the
information SOWERS was privy to and that a lot of such information
was "street talk" which always wasn't factual. He did verify
that SOWERS was recently arrested by the Rock¥ille Centre,

L.I., Police Department, on a gun charge, which ws subsequently
dismissed.

He said a great deal of information furnished by SOWERS
had in fact been verified in situations where SOWERS wearing
a body recorder had. engaged individuals in conversation and
the information he had previously furnished had ‘been verified
in these taped conversations. He advised that at no time had
SOWERS ever mehtioned to him having any contacts within. the
'PBE.and that Af he had he, TONA, would have felt obligatee .'
to imme ediately. bring this ‘to: the-attention of thé Nadjari
Commission. He did recall that SOWERS had mentioned-at
one time-that one of the indiv duals engaged the planning |
of a’trime was a-person named™ WORDOFF (phonetic) ; whom
SOWERS believed had a son in the FBI but that SOWERS was not
ly acquainted with the son. He said on one occasion
SOWERS had.told him about.a.corrupt. policeman - in..the New York -
City Police Department and that this information had immediat: ely
been furnished to the New York City Police Department.

TONA said one of the reasons NAGI had been murdered supposedly

- was that it became known on the street that he was cooperating

with the Nadjari Commission. -He also described BILLY CUTOLO- 7
as. being a braggart, who fancied himself as a. big-time hoodlum.
Ha Said an example of.this was the fact that they had been able
to establish that anytime CUTOLO, was going out on a score,, he_

the "Godfathex" type image. : a

He described GEORGE TROPIANO as an . individual, who supposedly
had a reputation of being "well connected" in organized crime but
that he personally doubted this since during the course of their
investigation they learned of an incident whereby TROPIANO went -
to ah illegal gambling game to collect a shylock loan and had
been thrown out of the place by the manager of the game. He said
that if in fact TROPIANO had been well connected this never

“would have. happened: He stated he had no knowl edge of any informa-

tion, which reflected possible connections between CUTOLO or
TROPIANO with any Federal agency. ° He doubted that they would have
sany such connections.

. ' ALFRED uv. LUCCHI, District Manager, Emery Air Freight,
Kennedy -International ‘airport, Jamaica, New York, advised that
he tas been District Manager for Emery Air Freight since 1970.
He stated that during this period, his company had never loaned
any of its trucks to any law enforcement agency for any reason
whatsoever. He said this information definitely would have come
“to his attention in his present position and he assured that
it could not have happened without his knowledge. He advised that
several years ago, his company had been requested to paint numbers
on the top of their trucks by the New York Port Authority Police
as an aid fof surveillance purposes should any of their trucks
‘become involved in a hijacking situation.  LUCCHI advised that
*the company leased their trucks from Hertz Rental, 16301 Rockaway
Boulevard, Jamaica, New York, for a six-months period and that he
has known from past experience, after returning the leased trucks,
Hertz apparently has had occasion shortly thereafter to rent the
trucks still bearing the Emery designation to other customers.

JOSEPH LEMMO, District Comptroller for Hertz Corporation,*®
163-01 Rockaway Boulevard, Queens, New York, stated he has been
employed in his presqnt capacity for the company for a lengthy
period“of time and is responsible for handling the rental
agteement between Emery Air Freight and Hertz Corporation in the
New York City area. He stated that Hertz Corporation leases
trucks to Emery Air Freight operating in the City of New York
and after a period of time’ these trucks are turned back to
Hertz Corporation by Emery Fréight under the terms of their agree-
ment. He related that when these trucks are returned by Emery Air
Freight to Hertz Corporation that they are repainted and no.longer
bear any of.the colors or identification associated with Emery

- Air Freight trucks. He advised he is absolutely confident that

no one-in Hertz Corporation temporarily loaned or rented these trucks
at any time to any police agency while these trucks still bore

the blue and white paint and name of Emery Air Freight. He emphasized
this by stating that the leasing agreement between Emery Air

. Freight ‘and Hertz Corporation is the largest contract held by

| Hertz Corporation and under no consideration would Hertz loan

any tyucks bearing the Emery Air Freight designation since this

might possibly cause the contract to be terminated if any untoward
incident occurred in relation to an Emery Air Freight truck.

Detective GEORGE COUTSAKIS, New York City Police
Department, was interviewed in an office located on the premises of
they 13th Precinct, New York City Police Department, Manhattan, New
York. Prior to_the interview EDWARD D. HEGARTY and CLARK F. BROWN
identified themSelves as peprecenteeee of the FBI Inspection Division,
Washington, D.C. |

Detective COUTSAKIS was asked if during his investiga-
tion of the murder of JAMES NAGI he had received any information
indicating that anyone was in the possession of information alleging
improper conduct and/or unlawful activity on the part of any member
“of any Federal Law Enforcement Agency, including the FBI, and he

sveplied'no. He was asked if during his conversations with GUTLLERMO
SOWERS he received any statement or indication from SOWERS alleging
improper conduct and/or unlawful activity on the part of ee member
of any Federal Law sjakaeteamnunaide Agency, including the FBI, and he
replied no.

a™. Detective COUTSAKIS said he was assigned as the
investigating homicide detective when JAMES NAGI's body was recovered
on June 25, 1974. During the course of his investigation he had
occasion to interview a number of NAGT’s associates, including GUrLLERMO
SOWERS. He spoke with SOWERS on two or three occasions and SOWERS
was uncooperative with him.. Based on his, Detective COUTSAKIS', inter-
views of SOWERS, he desgribed SOWERS as a "fantastic liar". He said
that subsequent to his interviews of SOWERS, he learned that SOWERS
has been and is now cooperating with the Prosecutor's Office, Brooklyn,
* New. York, regarding the NAGI murder and other matters. During the
early stages of the murder investigation conducted by Detective
COUTSAKIS, Special Agents of the FBI, BRUCE, BROTMAN and JOHN GOOD,
contacted him and furnished him with information regarding NAGI's
associates. It was his impression that NAGI had been an informant for
the FBI and probably for other law enforcement agencies, federal and
local. He stated hedid not have any definitive information as to what
specific law enforcement personnel were utilizing NAGI as an informant,
but he believes that possibly NAGI was an informant for the Drug
Enforcement Agency (DEA). He could not recall the specifics which led
him to believe that NAGI may have been an iformant for DEA. He also
believed that NAGI was possibly an informant for Detective PHILIP SHEVLIN

& ecial Agent Joseph Stabile) or any other FBI employee, had violated
the Bribery Statute, He was questioned specifically regarding his associa-
tion with Ahmad Nagi, also James Nagi who was murdered on June 17,
1974, Special Agent Good furnished the following information:

_ Good began handling Nagi as a potential criminal informant as a
. result of a contact with Nagi on October 1, 1970, subsequent to Nagi's
arrest August 31, 1970, by the Jersey City Police Department. Nagi
“was cooperative and he furnished information regarding an armed
hijacking which occurred August 31, 1970. As a result of Nagi's coopera-~
tion the shipment was recovered and an arrest was made.

«™. - :
Nagi continued to provide information of value on other cases leading
to the recovery of substantial amounts of stolen property and more than
jE ten arrests in Theft from Interstate Shipment cases, Among the persons
arrested were Henry Serrapica, Frank Lisi, Joseph Lisi, Anthony
Annichiarico, Louis Kelice, Harry L, Brown, Lennice Delain, Arthur
Hubbard, Johnny Lawrence, Charles Wharton and fugitive Ralph Guarino.

District Attorney Barry Freidman in connection with a planned hijacking
in July, 1971. Information furnished by Nagi-was disseminated prior to
the proposed hijacking and subsequently Nagi was arrested, The charges
were dismissed. Subsequently Nagi furnished very little information of

~ value and he became unreliable and unstable.: Nagi was "closed" as an
informant in July, 1972. He was later reopened as a potential criminal
informant in January, 1973, until April, 1973, during which period he
furnished no information of ‘value.

Nagi continued to contact SA Good from time to time but did nots
furnish any information of value. He usually called when he had been
arrested by local aujhorities and was seeking assistance. On these
occésions Good explained to him that there was nothing that the FBI
could do to assist him. He requested assistance in comection with an

* arrest for a Supermarket robbery in the Bronx, He explained that the
stick-up had been set up by George Tropiano and Tropiano's associates
which included the manager of the supermarket.

On May’ 2, 1975, SA Good advised that a short time prior to Nagi's
murder, a three-month period, he contacted SA Good by telephone and
7 advised that his parole officer was contemplating revocation of his parole
* because of arrests, Nagi said he told the parole officer that he had an
incurable disease, and had less than a year to live. The parole officer,
according to Nagi, said he was still going to revoke his parole unless he
received a letter of confirmation from a doctor to the effect that he had
an incurable disease.

» :

* "Nagi further advised that he had contacted a doctor and had told the

~ doctor that he was doing some work for the FBI and had to use the excuse
that he had an incurable disease as a cover story und requested the

| doctor to give him a letter indicating this. Nagi said the doctor refused

to do this unless he, the doctor, received a letter from the FBI requesting

it. ¥

.. Nagi requested a letter from SA Good which was denied. Good
“told Nagi he shouldn't have told the doctor that he was doing a job for
the FBI since he, Nagi, knew this not to be trpe.

SA Good further advised that a few days later Nagi came to the New
York Office to see SA Good who was not in, While in the office he may
haxe observed a sample of FBI letterhead stationery. Several days later
a.telephone call was received possibly by Complaint Clerk Joan Wild, i
from a U. S. Government Agency believed to be GSA, advising that a
person named James Nagi was attempting to pick up some FBI letter~
head stationery.

On May f and 2, 1975, SA Good advised that he never contacted i

She said she is Supervisor of Health and Drug Education and Health
Sexvices, Community School District 19, 2057 Linden Boulevard, ’
Brooklyn, N. Y..11207, telephone numbers 257-8619 and 257-6900.

Miss NAGI advised that for a period of approximately three
.- weeks prior to her brother's murder, he had lived with her, having
separated from his wife. She said her brother had always been very
kind to her buts she felt that he was trying to overcome the other
side of his personality and his involvement with the criminal element.
She said that they had always been very close and he frequently
“confided in her.
* :
. Approximately three or four years ago, her brother had
told her that’ he was working for the FBI and specifically mentioned
“an agent. by the name of John Good as his contact in the FBI. She
further recalled that on one occasion when her brother had gotten
in trouble he tried to get a statement from his family doctor to
the,eFfect that he had Leukemia and the doctor at the time mentioned
to her that JIMMY had told him how he was working for the FBI and
that she should see if there was any substance to this. She said
the doctor was reluctant to furnish such an untruthtul statement
unless the FBI was willing to substantiate JIMMY's involvement
with the agency. Miss NAGI said she never did contact the FBI
concerning this matter.»

‘She further stated that in 1973 JIMMY had served a nine
months sentence for extortion and had asked her to contact Aget Good
to try and get him out of jail. She said she never did contact
Agent Good nor did her brother ever mention’ any other FBI contacts
he might have who would help him in this matter.

She said that in addition to his contact with Agent Good
in the FBI, NAGI used to brag about numerous contacts in the
New York City Police Department and had a tendency to brag about
having inside information. She said frequently her brother would
be reading a newspaper account of a police investigation and would
comment to her that he knew about that matter many months ago
through his contacts in the Police Department.

ANTHONY VILLEROEL, #33161, an inmate at the Great Meadow
Correctional’ Institute, advised that he is presently serving a
prison’ sentence of three and one~half to ten years for an armed
hojdup in Bronx, New York, in 1972. He stated that he was
acquainted with JAMES NAGI for many years and that he and NAGI
began to pull Scores during the Spring of 1972 and that they
worked together through 1974 until NAGI was murdered. He said
that he and NAGI, as well as another accomplish on these scores,
PETE SOWERS, hung around the Burger Prince Restaurant, 66th
Street and 8th Avenue, Brooklyn, N. Y., during this period.

VILLEROEL recalled that in the Spring of 1972, JIMMY NAGI
-was driving him around in a "hot car" on which NAGI had changed
» the VIN. They were stopped by two police officers, who subsequently
“ took them to the 66th Precinct, New York City Police Department,
New York, for questioning. He recalled one of the officers
was named BROCKMAN (phonetic). He said when they got to the
precinct, NAGI asked for and was allowed to make a telephone
call and that after talking on the phone for several minutes, he
turned the phone over to one of the police officers, who had
brdéught them in. Following a short conversation, this police
officer said that they had to meet with someone and would be
back shortly. During their absence, NAGI told VILLEROEL that
he had called his contact in the New York City Police Department,
Detective EDDIE CARROLL, who said he would handle the matter.
Approximately a half hour later the two police officers returned
and said that NAGI was*free to go but that VILLEROEL was being
charged with grand larceny-auto. VILLEROEL said that NAGI had
frequently told him about his contact in the New York Police
Department EDDIE CARROLL, and that NAGI had to make payments to
CARROLL for protection purposes. He said that he himself had
frequently received telephone calls from CARROLL at his residence,
when CARROLL was attempting to locate NAGI. He said that he
knew the caller was CARROLL because the latter had so identified
himself on at least one occasion. VILLEROEL believed that
CARROLL was presently serving as an aide to a Deputy Inspector
in the New York City Police Department, and that NAGI frequently
furnished information concerning various activities of people he
knew to CARROLL. He said it was common street talk that NAGI was
a police informant. He advised that on several occasions NAGI had

warned him after receiving indDrmation from CARROLL that the
“heat was on" VILLEROEL's house and that he was to be careful
VILLEROEL advised that CARROLL never tried to put the "squeeze"
on him for information.
‘ VILLEROEL also volunteered that NAGI frequently mentioned

to him that he“had a contact in the FBI, who was the agent who had

arrested NAGI on a hijack case in New Jersey a few years ago.

He said that NAGI never expressed any concern to him nor did

he seem to worry about any possible charges or trial taking place

in connection with the hijacking charge aginst him. VILLEROEL

also recalled that in connection with this. hijacking that NAGI

told him he had been caught with the driver of the ee
- truck in his‘car. 7

VILLEROEL continued that about January 1973, he and NAGT

opened up a body and fendér shop at 435 2nd Avenue, Brooklyn,
New York, and that they dealt in hot cars. He recalled on one
occasion, while leaving this location two individuals, who from
appearance were apparently police officers, arrived at the shop
to telk with NAGI. He said NAGI later told him that these were
FBL men but did not state whether either nne of them was the
individual NAGI a described as his FBI contact. In this
regard, VILLEROEL said tut he believes possibly the name of NAGI’
FBI contact had “been HOFFMAN but couldn't be Sure of this.
VILLEROEL stated that NAGI had a telephone number in his possession
by which he could check out registration data for license numbers
of suspected police cars by calling the telephone and pretending
he was a cop. He said also that NAGI had shown him a list of
license numbers, which he said were FBI cars, and that these
nuinbers had been furnished him by his police contact. VILLEROEL
said that he was quite sure that NAGI had fold him it was a police
contact that had furnished him this list Yather than his FBI
contact. In response to whether VILLEROEL had any other knowledge
of police cars that might be interested in either NAGI or his
activities, he volunteered that it was common knowledge around
the Burger Prince that Dmery Air Freight trucks were being used
by the police. He said this was because the same Emery Air
Freight truck would frequently come to the Burger Prince and the
two occupants would sit around the Burger Prince for several
hours over one cup of coffee and gave every indication of being
connected with law enforcement. He recalled asking NAGI one time
to ask who these people were and NAGI subsequently told him that
they were the FBI.

VILLEROEL stated that during the Spring of 1973, he recalled
that NAGI had told him that he needed $1,000.00 for his FBI con-
tact, -who would supply him with crystals for FBI radio frequencies.
He said he told NAGI that this was too much money and never did
know whether MAGI obtained such crystals. He did say that NAGI
had a radio in his possession, which they used to plug into the
cigarette lighter of NAGI's car, which was capable of monitoring
the various police frequencies in Brooklyn, and that they would
use this while casing or pulling scores. He also recalled on
one occasion that NAGI asked him for and he gave him a portion of
one of his scores for the purpose of, according to NAGI, paying
the latter's. FBI contact. He further recalled that NAGI never
“ mentigned his FBI contact to him after approximately the middie
4. of 1973. :

VILLEROEL said that in connection with his appeal on the robbery
charges, for which he was incarcerated, he had obtained a copy
of a police report of the investigation, which reflected that an
FBI Agent had apparently also looked into the matter. He said
thatvhe could not recall the agent's name but that he did have
it in his possession in his cell. At the conclusion of the inter~
_Wwiew, VILLEROEL said he would get the name of the agent from the
report and furnish it to one of the guards who took him to his
cell, who could then relay it to thé interviewing agents. The
guard subsequently furnished the name he had obtained from
VILLEROEL as being HONFMAN.

- VILLEROEL continued that in 1972, he had met PETE SOWERS
through NAGI at the Burger Prince and they had gone on many scores
until VILLEROEL was incarcerated in September 1974. He described
SOWERS as a very stupid individual, who had been the manager of
‘the store he and NAGI held up in the Bronx, for which he, VILLEROEL,
was presently in jail. He said SOWERS had actually set up the
score for them and was charged with the crime. He said that
NAGI and SOWERS, as well as himself, were acquainted with BILLY
CUTOLO and GEORGE TROPIANO. VILLEROEL pointed out that he was
employed at the Burger Prince during this period of. time by
CUTOLO. He said NAGI and SOWERS both told him that CUTOLO and
TROPIANO were very important guys but that neither of them had
ever confided in him about whatever they were doing. He did
recall that CUTOLO used to warn him by saying that he should stay
away from NAGI and SOWERS because they were “bad news". He
pointed out that neither CUTOLO nor TROPIANO had ever told him
of any contacts they had with law enforcement nor had he ever
heard any street talk that they had such contacts. He further
advised that he really did not know ‘any close contacts other than’
himself of NAGI or SOWERS and that he did. not think that these
two individuals were very close to CUTOLO or TROPIANO. He said

_the street talk was that NAGI was killed over a million doliaf
: art score of a doctor's apartment at the Golden Gate Hotel. ‘He
: could’ furnish no fusther details in this regard. VILLEROEL
! denied ever hearing of JOE STOPS or STABBS or the names (STABILE,)
| STATILE, (MORESCO)or SCHIAFFINO. VILLEROEL further denied ever
having been cdntacted by or having had any association with FBI
Agents. He said in connection with his incarceration he had been
originally sent to Elmira’ Reformatory, where he got the reputaton
of being a wise guy and that he had been examined by a doctor
there, who saig he was crazy, because he gave “goofy answers".
He said he was subsequently transferred to-Mattewan State Hospital
for psychiatric examination, where he stayed for a short period,
| + and then was'sent back to Blmira and subsequently to Great Meadow.
He advised that he would be willing to subject himself to a lie
detector test concerning the above facts but would only do so
with the consent of his attorney JOHN DOCKERY, 26 Court Street,
Brooklyn, New York.

assignments relate to bank robbery investigations. ‘He speculated
that it is quite possible a New York City police officer may have
made inquiry of him, some time in the past, regarding VILLEROEL,
and that he may have told him that he knew nothing about VILLEROEL,

-for them. NAGI also asked him if he could provide him with
makeup for some of his other jobs..

Later in February, 1974 MARTIN stated GATHERER took
him to the Franklin Arms Hotel in New York and introduced bin
to two black men named STANLEY SINMONS aka Fly and MEL

- BARNES aka: Cisco. These mcn were operating a prostitution ring
inside the hotel at thistime. After the first introduction, doth
EERE FLY end CISCO, he stated, began coming to the Caribbean Room Bar
! where he, MARTIN, was working at the time.

At the Caribbosn Bar FLY and CISCO met with NAGI and
IOVINE, as well as GATHERER and himscaf, MARTIN advised.
Tagether they talked about various jobs that they could pull.
“One of the jobs that they discussed, he advised, was a jewel
robbery which was to be arranged by a jeweler named BILL.

CISCO and FLY also told thon that. they had a connectiuu
in the Bronx who could provide thém with New York City detective
and police badges, as well as arrest and search warrants. CISCO
and FLY intended tose this paraphernalia to rob independent
numbers operators, loansharks and narcotics pushers. MARTIN

.said that CISCO requested he go along on these jobs and provide
‘them with makeup so that the victims would not be able tc identify
them later,

MARTIN said that sometime in the spring of 1972 he

< CISCO, and a Spanish American named SPEEDY went to a restaurant
in the Bronx near Yankee Stadium. There they met with two
unknown Negro males, who drove them to a very wealthy-looking
neighborhood in Manhatten. The two unknowm Negro males then
showed them an apartment house and gave them the apartment ©

MARTIN advised that they were all given New York City detective.
badges, .38 calibre pistols, and an arrest warrant for the
numbers operator. With this paraphernalia they entered the B
apartment house, went to the designated apartment, and identific2 oe
themselves as police officers. MARTIN advised that a woman

they were looking for no longer resided at this address... As a
result of this, all of the men left the building and returned
& the police paraphernalia to the two unknown Negro males.
1
MARTIN advised that shortly after this incident he
participated in a similar operatien with CISCO and FLY. This
robbery, he Stated, took’ place in Harlem and again they were all |
armed with New York detective badges, pistols and an arrest
warrant. ‘The victim at this time was a black female narcotics
pusher, who was supposed to have $40,000.00 on her person. At
> the time. of the roobery, however, MAR? DIN stated she > only had
$600.00, which they took.

wr

MARTIN advised that NAGI did not participate in any of
these robberies although he was aware from conversations the grovo
had with him about the methods with which they were committing these “|
robberies. The only criminal dealing that they had with NAGi
during the spring of 1974, MARTIN advised, was in trying to sell

« Some Stolen art objects in the possession of JAMES NAGI. As far
as he recalled MARTIN advised that some people working for NAGiL |
had gholea et obje valued at $250,000.00 from a
Dr. SALERNO a. New York Ci yo NAGI, he advised, compleined
that too many people knew about ‘the burglary and then asked hin, H
MARTIN, if he could find a buyer for the art objects. MARTIN |
advised that he tken got in touch with a SIDNEY SCHMALCWIfZ, a
jeweler who specialized also in stolen jewelry and other art
‘objects, SCHMALOWITZ, MARTIN advised, was able to find a ouyer
but by this time NAGI had.told him that his people, BILL and
GEORGE, had taken the art objects from him and he could not get
them back. At this time MARTIN advised he found out.about all
the problems that NAGI was having with his people in Bayridge.

MARTIN said that he had been told by one of NAGI's
other associates, ANTHONY, whose last name he did not recall,
that sometime in 1972 or 1973 NAGI, on the orders of his peovle
in Brooklyn, had pulled a supermarket robbery in Co-op City
New York. This robbery, he was told, netted NAGI $100, 000.00.

re

Later, though, NAGI was arrested for this robbery because the
assistant mamger of the supermarket, who was also involved

in this robbery, had confessed to the police. Prior to his
arrest, though, NAGI had kopt a good part of the money he netted
in this robbery instead of turning it all over to BILL and
GEORGE in Brooklyn. In addition to this particular incident,
MARTIN stated he found out from NAGI and others that NAGI was
holding back goods that he obtained through hijacking jobs that
he was ening for BILL and GEORGE in Brooklyn. dfs a result,
BILL and GEORGE put a lot of pressure on NAGI for their money.
MARTIN advised it got so bad that during a period of about one
month he gave NAGI about $700.00 to repay BILL and GEORGE.

Beginning approximately May, 1974, FLY, CISCO, NAGI
ané possibly IOVINE, as well as he, MARTIN, discussed a robbery in
fihich they were to rob a New York City Water Denartment official,
who alleg herd had one~half million dollars hidden in the basement
of his t fac robbery was to be cz ed out by two New Youk
City policenen, who had been regularly shaking down CISCO and FLY
on their prostitution operation. RaGl, early in the planning of
this robbery, told them that he dia not went any part of it,
although he did continue to participate in the planning of the
robbery.

On June 8, 1974, MARTIN stated CISCO and FLY told him
that the following Tonday they would be bringing the two-policenen
over to him so he could make them uo with a suitable disguise for
the upcoming robbery. When CISCO brought the two policenen to
his house he recognized one of the policemen as VINCENT RIZZ0.

The other policcmen's name he stated was DINERO. ‘The two policemen
asked him about his makeup work, and then he actually made up one
of the policcmen. As they had planned, the two policemen were to
return to his: house on Toursday in order to be made uo for the
robbery, which was to ‘take place that Friday. Aftce the two
policeman had left, FLY and CISCO told him, MARTIN, that this
robbery was to be a frame job on the two policemen, that is that
when the two policemen were in the house conducting the robbery,
CISCO and FLY would contact the Police Department and tell tren
that two men were robbing this particular City official. CISCO end

e
MARTIN advised that on the morfing of the robbery
which he recalls was Friday, ‘Juné-14, 1974, he went to the ’
Caribbean Room, where he met JAMES NAGI and NI® IOVINE. He
askéd both of them to return to his house with him, where they
spent most of the day. While in the apartment, MARTIN advised,

was being arrested for homicide on a police officer while NAGI :
and [OVINE were picked up simply because they were on the premises.
QéRTIN also advised that the officers found a number of guns in
his apartment, all of which belonged to him. Additionally, they
found several badges, one of which was an ambulance driveisbadse

that he used when he had been driving an ambulance, end the
was an old auxiliary police badge.

MARTIN adyised that as far as he has been told the two

police officers that were to do the robbery were actually working
in an undercover capacity and he was later charged with

to this charge, MARTIN stated he was sentenced to one year in
prison, and is currently serving this sentence.

Nx. GATHERER advised that he has known JAMES NAGI very well since
1968 or 1969, Beginning in early 1974, he stated, he, NAGI, his
brother-in-law ROBERT MARTIN, as well as two other individuals
named STANLEY SIMMONS and MELVIN BARNES, started to meet regularly

was during these meetings that NAGI involved them all in the sale
of some paintings which he and others apparently had stolen earlier.

unable to do so because he had given some of the paintings to
WILLIAM CUTOLO and GEORGE TROPIANO, who usually could be found at
* .the Burger Prince Restaurant, 65th Street and Eighth Avenue, -
Brooklyn, New York. According to GATHERER, CUTOLO and TROPIANO
-kept the paintings because NAGI owed them a great deal of money.
Up until the time NAGI was killed in dune, 1974, he advised he
kept hearing from NAGI and others that he;was very deeply in debt
to Ee and TROPIANO. :

During the time he was associated with NAGI, GATHERER

of people and talked freely about them to him, but he never told him
about any FBI agent or any other individual representing law
enforcement on a local level. NAGI at no time ever told him that
he was paying any law enforcement official for help and/or
information.

Detective Edmund Carroll, 103rd Precinct, New York City
Police Department, advised that he had worked on the .hijacking :
squad £Erom 1967 until the latter part of 1972, at which time he
transferred to his present assignment. He said that during the
course of his work with the hijacking squad he became acquainted
with JIMMY NAGI, who at the time was dealing in het cars, mainly
Cadillacs. During this same period, Carroll stated that he
- worked closely with various FBI Agents, including John Good, and
that both he and Good had been using NAGI as an informant. He
described NAGI as being a braggart, who frequented both the 61st
and 62nd Precincts, New York City Police Department, located
in the Brooklyn area. He said NAGI was always telling people
“ about his inside contacts with the Police Department and how he
» could get things taken care of. In aflition, he said NAGI talked
about having contacts in the Safe and Loft Squad and used to
carry a list of license numbers, which he said were cars used
by the local precincts. Carroll said he never heard NAGI discuss
any contacts he had with FBI Agents, other than John Good, but
he did recall on two or three occasions seeing NAGI with ong
Villawo,) whom he knew to be an FBI Agent. and with whom he had worked
frequently. He recalled on one occasion that NAGI had called him ~
and asked him tq meet in a restaurant. When he arrived,
NAGI and (iano) were together at the restaurant. He said he
could not furnish any further details concerning the relationship
“Between (Vil ano and NAGI, other than they were acquainted.
Carroll Said to’ the best of his knowledge it was sometime prior
to the latter part of 1972, when he saw(Villano)with NAGI, but
could not pinpoint the time more specifically.

He further described NAGI as the type of individual who
would tell his friends about his contacts in the Police Department
and to prove this would call a police officer on the telephone to
set up a meeting, while at the same time letting one of his friends
listen to the call to prove that he had such contacts. He said a
_good example was several years ago during the course of an investiga-
tion they utilized a telephone intercept in which NAGI was overheard
telling a friend of his how he could get a case fixed because of his
acquaintanceship with a certain New York City Police Officer.

and he replied that he furnished the information to New York City

Mr. EVERSLEY stated he did not believe he told Lieutenant WHITE that
the information came from JAMES NAGI, but upon further reflection
he thought that possibly he did advise Lieutenant WHITE that the source.
of the information was JAMES NAGI. :

Mr, GOLDSTEIN advised that he was informed by NAGI on
April 9, 1974, that he, NAGI, had been threatened by WILLIAM CUTOLO.
He said-.that about this time, believed to be April 12, 1974, NAGI
complained that he was suffering from leukemia. Shortly thereafter,
Mr. GOLDSTEIN contacted Dr. NICHOLAS LEONIA, who is associated with
the Tong Island College Hospital,.and learned from Dr. LEONIA that
NAGI was being treated by him for the disease leukemia. He recalled

-to the apartment of BOBBY MARTIN, at 427 Lloyd Street, Brooklyn,
New York in order to visit with MARTIN. According to TOVINE,
there were several other people in the apartment, most of whom he
did not know. . While hé was in the apartment, officers working
for the special Prosecutor MAURICE NADJARI entered the premises
with an arrest warrant for MARTIN. As far as he recalled, IOVINE
stated all of the people in the apartment, including himself and
NAGI, were arrested and taken to NADJARI's office. NADJARI's people,
he stated kept them there for 14 hours during which time NAGI
was questioned frequently. Prior to getting out of the custody
of NADJARI's office, IOVINE advised NAGI had told him not to worry
éout this arrest because he's going tq be able to get them both out.

4

IOVINE stated he did not know what NAGI had done
to get them out of jail‘but stated it was.his opinion that NAGI
probably agreed to help NADJARI's investigators. IOVINE went
furthér to say that it was known to him and his associates that
NAGI: had in the past been an informer for various law enforcement
agencies. IOVINE also stated that NAGI was prone to brag about
his connections but that he never bragged aout having a connec-

tion or friend within the FBI or any other branch of the Federal
Law Enforcement.

iS IOVINE advised he recalls that NAGI had told him that
he and ANTHONY TONANI were arrested in New Jersey for hijacking H
some time in 1970. As far as he could recall, IOVINE said this |
arrest did not particularly disturb NAGI and he did not act at all-. oy
worried about the disposition, if any,of this case. The only case,
according to IOVINE, that NAGI worried about was an arrest for using

NAGI was identified by at least one of the victims and he
was very worried about being convicted in that case. rs

faeuee IOVINE also advised that he is‘familiar with two of
NAGI's associates WILLIAM CUTOLO and GEORGE TROPIANO. NAGI
gwould usually meet with CUTOLO and TROPIANO at the Burger
Prince located at 65th Street and 8th Avenue, Brooklyn, New
York, IOVINE also stated that he was never allowed to go
into this place.

Mr. IOVINE again was asked if he had ever been told by

NAGI that he knew someone within the FBI,or any other branch

of Federal Law Enforcement, who was going to assist him in any

of his problems with the law. IOVINE answered that at no 7
- time did NAGI ever refer to any individual who might be a member H
i of the FBI or Federal Law Enforcement’in general. IOVINE was

also asked if he had ever heard of or been associated with a

New York City Police Officer named EUGENE STATILE. IOVINE

stated he never heard of or been an associate with STATILE.

Mr. IOVINE stated that when he was arrested in 1974,
at,the apartment of BORSY MARTIN, he was aware of the fact
that the police officers seized a number of guns, as well as.
New York P.D. and Security Police type badgas. As far.as
che could recall Mr. IOVINE stated there were no FBI Badges
in the apartment, nor had he ever ,seen any FBI badges in
MARTIN's possession. As to BOBBY MARTIN, IOVINE stated he is
currently incarcerated at the Atlantic Avenue Jail in Brooklyn.

IOVINE also stated he had been introduced to a man
named PETE or BILL SOVERS by NAGI. However, their introduc-
tion and association was limited and he, IOVINE, never gotto
know SOWERS very well.

¢

Mr. IOVINE advised that during the time that he knew

. NAGI he was married to a woman named LINDA NAGI, who resided
“next door to him on Luquer Street, Brooklyn, New York. In
addition, NAGI spent a good deal of time with a . girlfriend
named SUSAN FRIEDMAN, who resides at Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn,
N. ¥., telephone 648-5292, He also advised that NAGI was
extremely close to a sister RESA, who resides at 108th and
Flatlands Avenue, Brooklyn, N. Y. According to IOVINE, NAGI
spent a good bit of time with these two women and most likely }
would have confided in them. : H

Avenue, Brooklyn, New York, with lis father and has recently become
the owner of a dairy products store, known as Milk and Honey
Parms; 4th Avenue and 92nd Street, Brooklyn, N. ¥. Prior to this,
CAPUTO was delivering pies in the Wall Street area of Manhattan
in 1973 and 1974 for the Mrs. Smith's Pies Corporation. He said
he did not work during 1971 and 1972 due to ill health associated .
with Hepatitis,

CAPUTO stated he was born on June 12, 1938 in New York City,
and he furnislted the following information. relating to his associa-
tion with JAMES NAGI and others:

CAPUTO knew JAMES NAGI for many years inasmuch as they had

* grown up in the same neighborhood in Brooklyn. He was called
before ‘the Kings County Grand Jury in relation. to the murder of
NAGI, which occurred in June 1974, but was unable to identify
any of-the individuals allegedly associated with JAMES NAGI.
CAPUTO stated that he has no recollection of any individuals named
GEORGE TROPIANO, PETE SOWERS or WILLIAM CUTOLO but advised he
might recognize them if he were to see a photo of them. He denied
frequenting the Burger Prince Restaurant in the recent past and
stated he had only been in the establishment two or three times
and not at any time in the last year ox year and one-half.

He related that he recently learned of the indictment of
individuals named TRORIANO and CUTOLO for the murder of JAMES
NAGI but does not recall ever having heard of them. CAPUTO
did’ occasionally speak to JAMES NAGI in the past several years but
had no social or criminal contact with him and claims to have
actually disliked NAGI since he felt that NAGI was continually
attempting to encourage associates to becéme involved in criminal
activities.

7 Numerous times during the interview CAPUTO emphatically
denied knowing SOWERS, TROPIANO or CUTOLO and stated he has
never been involved in criminal activities and avoids any
association with individuals who are known or considered to
be hoodlums. He did state that in 1956 or 1957, he was charged
‘with rape at the age of 18 but the charge was subsequently
dismissed. He related when NAGI was killed, he did attend the
wake for NAGI but only because he had known him for years and not

CAPUTO was queried’ as to whether he would agree to submitting

tions to know that the facts can be twisted in such a fashion
that an innocent individual can become suspect in matters of
which he was not actually involved. Additionally, CAPUTO confided
that everything he had discussed during this interview was in

He emphasized that during the limited contacts he had with

arrested August,31, 1970, by officers of the Jersey City Police
Department and were then charged with armed robbery, assault,
kidnaping, threatening life, receiving stolen goods and possession
of a deadly weapon. The file further reflects that no action was
' taken in this matter until 3/5/75 when the case was presented

charging NAGI and TONANI with violating the above Statutes.
on 4/3/75, TONANI entered a plea of not guilty to the charges.

Detectives for the Hudson County Prosecutor's Office, from
September, 1970“to December, 1974. While he was in this position,
the Hudson County Prosecutor was GEOFFREY GAULKINS. Mr. GREENBERG
. advised that he had never heard of an individual named ADMAD or
JAMES NAGI arrested in 1970 by the Jersey City Police Department
for hijacking and kidnaping. Further, he stated he does not
remember his office doing any type of investigation in this
matter. He also stated that as far as he can recall nobody by
-the name of AHMAD or JAMES NAGI ever acted as an informant for
,the Hudson County Prosecutor’ s Office, while he was working there.

Dato of transcription

Mr. -GREENBERG advised that normally the local Municipal
Magistrates in Hudson County would forward criminal cases to the
prosecutor's office where they would be assigned to a prosecuting
attorney for an opinion. If the case warranted prosecution it
was bxpught before the Grand Jury for an indictment. He did state
tha® the volume of cases referred to the prosecutor's office is
so great that the resulting backlog sometimes caused cases to
be delayed for years before being brought to the Grand Jury.

Mr. GREENBERG advised that THOMAS ST. PIERCE joined
the prosecutor's office in /February 1972 and then quit
approximately a year later. GREENBERG advised that ST. PIERRE.
would have had no reason to deal with the case involving JAMES
NAGI since this was not the type of work he handled.

Mr. DAVID J. RITCHIE, Attorney for the Eastern Distrifet
of New York Strike Force, U. S. Department of Justice, advised
that he was thé attorney assigned to the case entitled, U. S. vs.
PAUL DE PALO, JOSEPH VICTOR MELE, in which DE PALO and MELE were
charged with violation of Title 18, U. S. Code, Sections 472,

371 and 372. Aceording to RITCHIE, four people were arrested in

this case but two of the individuals VINCENT SINATRA and CHARLES

ZUMO were actually Secret Service undercover agents. Mr. RITCHIE
| advised further that the Secret Service Agent handling this case
was Special Agent ALBERT P. ANGELONE. The arrest stemmed out of
a buy made by ANGELONE and Special Agent LOUIS J. TRAVAGLINO in
October, 1972, at the TWA Terminal, JFK Airport, New York. The
agents at that time bought almost $500,000.00 worth of counter-
feit currency from DE PALO and MELE.
+

RITCHIE advised that the U. S. Grand Jury in the Eastern
i District of New York listened to evidence furnished by the Secret
Service Agents in regard to this case on 10/25/72. Subsequently,
he stated in a letter dated February 7, 1973, addressed to KURT
MUELLENBERG, Deputy Chief, Organized Crime Section, U.S. Depart-

| menteo”. Justice, he, RITCHIE, recommended that DE PALO and MELE

be prosecuted for violation of Title 18, U.S. Code, Sections 472,
371 and 372. Subsequent to sending this letter, RITCHIE stated

he was approached by the Secret Service andasked not to pursue this
case any further because prosecution of DE PALO and MELE would
endanger a very important informant working for the Federal Bureau
of Investigation. As a yesult of this request, which he recalls
was made by Secret Service Agent ANGELONE he, RITCHIE, closed the
file on 3/14/73, without ever prosecuting DE PALO or MELE.

Mr. RITCHIE advised that early in 1973, he was contacted
by two agents of the FBI, who asked if he had any objections to their
speaking to Mr. DE PALO in order to obtain information on criminal
activities in the New York area from him. RITCHIE advised that he
does not recall who the two agents were. He did say he told them
to go ahead and talk to DE PALO since it did not appear that the
case wollld be prosecuted. Other than the two agents who requested
to spaak with DE PALO in 1973, no other representative of the Federal
Bureau of Investigation ever contacted him regarding the case on PAUL
DE PALO. 7

CUTOLO, however, dia not give him any help or advice on the case.
t€ waS CUTOLO's sister, BARBARA, who directed him to his present
attorney, Mr. ALBERT ARRONE. After he had engaged ARRONE as
his attorney,“DE PALO stated he dealt only with him on all
matters relating to his counterfeit case. DE PALO stated at
no time did CUTOLO or his’ associate GEORGE TROPIANO ever furnish
him with any inside information regarding the counterfeit money
case. Further, neither CUTOLO nor TROPIANO ever told him or
in any way indicated that they had a source within the Federal
Law Enforcement Establishment. At this time, SA PEARCE asked
Mr. DE PALO ‘that as a supposition, if CUTOLO had a source within
Federal Law Enforcement and had told him, DE PALO, about it,
would be now furnish this information to the Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI). Mr, DE PALO advised that he could not be
sure if he would. furnish such information, but that the whole
question and supposition is irrelevant because CUTOLO never
told him about any. source he had in the Federal Law Enforcement
Egtgblishment. 7

DE. PALO advised that when he first met CUTOLO in 1970
or 1971 they were just close social acquaintances brit that since
he, DE PALO, had married CUTOLO's sister they have become much
closer to one another. As to GEORGE TROPIANO, CUTOLO's associate,
DE PALO stated he had less contact with him and had seldom ever
spoken to him becausé he described PROPIANO as a very taciturn
individual. DE PALO was now asked if he knew a New York City
Policeman named STATILE, and he advised that he did not.

DE PALO stated that he met DENIS DILLON, the Government

+ Attorney prosecuting his counterfeit casé only once, when he

was arrested in October, 1972. Since then he has never again
had a meeting with DILLON. DE PALO stated that since his arrest
he has had no contact with the U. S. Department of Justice Office
prosecuting his case and that any and all contacts there have
been handled by his lawyer.

DE PALO stated’that his only other contact with Federal
law enforcement officials was early in 1973 when two agents
of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) came to see him
at his aprtment on 63rd Street, Brooklyn, N. Y. The two agents

at that time asked if he could furnish the FBI with information

on criminal activities in the Brooklyn area. DE PALO stated
that he could not furnish such information and the agents never
again contacted him. DE PALO also stated that he cannot recall
the names of the two agents who contacted him.

New York Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, 201
East 69th Street, Ney York, N. Y. 10021. Tallia advised that in
October of 1972, a confidential informant told him that ‘two
Brboklyn men JOSEPH MELE and PAUL (last name unknown) were in
possession of a large quantity of counterfeit $20 bills for
which they were hoping to find a buyer. Special Agent Tallia
stated that he disseminated this information to Special Agent
Albert Angellone of the Secret Service. Additionally, Tailia
said he introduced Angellone to the informant and then arranged
for the informd4nt to introduce Angellone to the two men in
possession of the counterfeit money. Tallia said that this was

- his only involvement in this case, which later resulted in the

arrest. of the two subjects, as well as a recovery of one-half

million dollars worth of counterfeit $20 bills.

Special Agent Tallia advised that prior to introducing
Special’ Agent Angellone to the informant, Angellone had told
him that the informant would never be needed to testify in this
case,and that the Secret Service would make several buys and
intrdduce someone else into the picture in order to completely
sever the informant from the case As best as he can recail,
Tallia advised the cage against @ two subjects in this case
has never been prosecuted by the Brooklyn Strike Force because
to do so would endanger the identity'of the informant.

by SAS J. ROBERT PEARCE and KLAUS C. ROHR, DE PALO was
4 asked if he would consent to an interview using the Polygravh.
fie was advised by the interviewing Agents that the Polygreph
examination would deal specifically with whether or not he
-had knowledge of his brother-in-law, BILLY CUTOLO, having an
alleged contact in the Federal Government. DE PALO advised
that he would consult with his attorney and would furnish an
answer ab the beginning of the next week. On May 14, 1975
DE PALO attezwted to telephonically contact SA ROHR, with
negative results. On May 14, 1975, SA ROHR telephonically
left a hessage at both PAUL DE FALO'S residence and at the
od residence of his father, JOHN DE PALO, requesting that
PAUL DE Palo contact: the New York Office.

On the morning of May 15, 1975 PAUL DE ‘PATO
telephonically advised SA PEARCE of the following:

a, Since the previous interview he has left a message
: _ with his attorney to ask his attorney's opinion of DE PALO
i consenting to a Polygraoh examinaticn. His attorney has not
Haast returned the call. He said since the Ore ious talk with the

ious talk
Agents on his own without consulting his attorney he had
decided against the Polygraph examination. He said his
decision was due, to the fact that the request in itself was
"against the integrity" of DE PALO. He said also that it is
a machine, and the results could work against him. He stated
that he did not make a hasty decision and had thought it

over and had finally made up his mind that he would say "no"
on the previous dey, May 14, 1975. He said the request in

a sense was insulting.

SA PEARCE told him that in the previous interview
he had indicated that he was not certain that he would admit
‘whether or not his brother-in-law had a connection in the
Federal Government or in the Federal Bureau of Investigation
if he knew this to be a fact. Further, that he did not have
to make this decision because he, DE PALO, did not Imow if:
his brother-in-law had any such connection. SA PEARCE told-

whether he would infoxson this specific matter if he
had knowledge of it created an area of doubt, and it was
for‘this reason that the Polygraph was considered. DE PALO
was advised that the Polygraph would in no way jeopardize
his cage. Furthor, that his case was not even within the

involved a counterfeit matter, DE PALO said he realized .

‘coverage and,'in addition, he personally listened to a significantly

large sampling of conversations recorded during the course of the

reviewed and exhibited to Supervisor HEGARTY administrative records
reflecting the assignment of personnel involved in the monitoring

£ the aboye electronic surveillances and there was no indication
@ STABILE was directly involved. He recalled, however, that during

he course“of some of the above electronic surveillances directed
against JOSEPH GENTILE, an unrelated electronic surveillance, EDNY
145, was monitored in the same room, as were the GENTILE case
e¥ectronic surveillances. EDNY 145 resulted from the FBI's investi-
gation of the case captioned "WORKMEN's MOBILE LUNCH ASSOCIATION,
INC.; PHILIP RASTELLI; and others; ANTI-RACKETEERING - HOBBS ACT;

that GOsEE H_STABILE was present in the Monitoring Room on September ath,_
September 11, 12, dd September 13, 1972.

5 SA GENOVA said that the eleétronic surveillance coverage
in the GENTILE case was highly successful, particularly the micro- H
phone coverage afforded GENTILE's residence, in terms of the amount }
of significant evidence accumulated. As a result of the GENTILE }
investigation, an indictment was returned on May 23, 1973, which | 3
charged JOSEPH GENTILE and numerous other persons with violations
of Title 18, United States Code, Sections 1955, 371 and 2.

On January 18, 1974, Attorney-In-Charge DENIS E.
DILLON, Eastern District of New York Strike Force, Brooklyn, New
York, advised that the indictment returned on May 23, 1973, against
all subjects of the GENTILE investigation would-be dismissed. The
reason for the dismissal, according to Strike Force Attorney DILLON,
as narrated by SA GENOVA, was that there was a fatal flaw in the

Force Attorney FRED BARLOW had failed to cause the sealing of the
tapes by a United States District Court Judge pursuant to the

.

Force Attorney BARLOW's office for nine months. On January 18, 1974,
Attorney-in-Charge DILLON advised that after consultation with

the Acting United States Attorney, for the Eastern District of New
York, and his.Department of Justice superiors, the indictments would
be dismissed because the provisions of the Statute had not been
complied with.

SA GENOVA said he personally reviewed the physical
evidence seized at various times, as a result of investigative activity
in the GENTILE case, and that from his review of the material seized,
he igs. confident there are no indications whatsoever of any connection

" Mr. WILLIAM CUTOLO was interviewed at a picnic

! table sitting under an awning in front of the Burger Prince RefStaurant,
6521 Eighth Avenue, Brooklyn, New York. At the outset of the inter-
view, SAS KLAUS C. RQHR and FORD W. COLE identified themselves to
CUTOLO“by displaying their credentials. Subsequent to this, SA ROHR
told Mr. CUTOLO that he wished to interview him regarding CUTOLO's
possible conneétion with some member of the Federal Law Enforcement
establishment. SA ROHR also told CUTOLO that this interview had
nothing to do with his involvement with local authorities. At this
time, SA ROHR furnished CUTOLO with an "Interrogation; Advice of
Rights" form and asked him to read same. Mr. CUTOLO read this form
i and stated that he understood his rights, as set out therein. He

advised that he did not want to sign this form, but would answer
- questions asked of him.

SA ROHR then asked CUTOLO if he had ever told anyone
that he had a contact within the Federal Law Enforcement stablishment,
including the FBI. Mr. CUTOLO advised that he definitely did not
have any contact with anyone in the Federal Law Enforcement establish-
i ment. SA ROHR then asked CUTOLO if he had ever paid money to any
! membey of the Federal Law Enforcement establishment for information

or*help in any enterprise in which he, CUTOLO, may have been engaged.
CUTOLO again emphatically denied ever having done such a thing.
Mr. CUTOLO was next asked if he ever received any information from
anyone in Federal Law Enforcement, including the FBI, relating to
the arrest of his brother-in-law PAUL DE PALO for possession of
counterfeit money in 1972. Mr. CUTOLO answered that he had never
received any informatitn from anyone connected with Federal Law
: Enforcement regarding this case. -The only connection he had withthe
i case, CUTOLO stated, was that he assisted DE PALO in obtaining an
attorney to represent him in that case. The attorney he recommended,
CUTOLO stated, was ALBERT ARRONE, who is currently representing him,
! CUTOLO. :

Fl Mr. CUTOLO advised that questions asked of him by
SA ROHR did not come as a surprise because he had been told by his
brother-in-law, PAUL DE PALO, as well as his cousin, MARK PALUMBO, that
the FBI had been to see them asking similar questions.

It was also noted that PAUL DE PALO was on the premises
of Burger Prince working behind the counter at the time of interview.

hard of hearing and that he is afraid to answer questions because
he may not understand the questions that were asked of him. SA ROHR

rights, as set out in the form, but that he did not want to‘sign

fowiduing question: for Mr. TUZIO: ‘

Did you. ever pay any money to any police officer,’
federal agent or any other member -ot the receral Government for any
information or help from such a persdén? Mr. TUZIO read the question
and then stated emphatically that he had never done any such thing.

c On March 11, 1975, SA FORD W. COLE was furnished
the following information by GUILLERMO SOWERS regarding one "ROBERT
NORDORFF" :

‘

SOWERS advised.that NORDORFF is head of security
for all of the Shop-Rite Stores and stated that he was a retired
Special Agent of the FBI. While SOWERS was employed by Shop-Rite,
* NORDORFF advised him that if SOWERS did not pay NORDORFF $5,000.00,
he would have SOWERS fired. SOWERS had lied in his application for
employment that he had never been arrested, but he had. NORDORFF
found this out, and threatened to have SOWERS fired for this if he
did not pay.
.,
ae Shortly after this, SOWERS was contacted by a CHARLIE
(LNU), and "T.T. (LNU)", who advised him that they would kill him
if SOWERS did not pay the money to NORDORFF. SOWERS went to TROPIANO
and GEORGE TROPIANO, BILL CUTOLO and SOWERS had a "sitdown" in
Astoria, Queens, with "CHARLIE" and "{.T.". TROPIANO advised these
two individuals that SOWERS worked for him, and got things cleared
up. Since that time, SOWERS has determined that NORDORFF was involved |
in numerous transactions with TROPIANO and is closely associated
with’ organized crime figures.

SOWERS further advised that NORDORFF had advised him
that his son was also presently employed by the FBI.

. -ROBERT NOTHDURFT, SR. was interviewed in the parking
lot .-at the Shop-Rite Supermarket, 3100 Ocean Avenue, Brooklyn, 1
New York. NOTIHDURFT advised that his son was an agent stationed
&n Washington, D. C., however he was not aware of what his son
did. He advised that his son worked in Top Secret work and was
extremely close mouthed. He-said his son never told him about the
nature of his work. a :

At the outset of the interview, NOTHDURFT volunteered
that we probably wanted to talk to him about WILLIAM SOWERS. When
asked why, he said because he was the worst apple he knew. He a
- advised that BILL SOWERS had worked for him as Night Manager of
a Shop-Rite store, but did not know where he could be found now.
He said SOWERS had resided at one time at 175 Webster and at
another time somewhere on Newkirk Avenue, both in Brooklyn, New
York. He advised that SOWERS had a brother PETE SOWERS and would af
often’ use his name. He advised that PETE” SOWERS worked in the i
Bronx in a supermarket, but he did not know where he lived or }
- exactly where he worked. He advised that CHARLIE SPEROZA was an
@sSociate of BILL SOWERS and that an attorney by the name of LEONE i
(phonetic), telephone 544-8484, 125-10 Queens Boulevard, Queens, 4
New York, would know how to get in touch with SPEROZA.

NOTHDURFT advised that when SOWERS worked for him he had
stolen $3,000.00. He said that in an effort to collect $3, 000 for
the company he had threatened to have a guy work SOWERS over. He
commented “anything for the company - you know". Following this,
she said that SOWERS came by with two other people. He described
one of them as an older man with wavy grey hair, whom he described
as the brains. He.described the other as a young man who was cocky.
He said that they threatened him if he didn't stop trying to collect’
the $3,000.00. Following this confrontation, he said he drove off
and had gone only a short distance when he had to stop and he
‘vomited. He said he knew then that they had gotten to him. He
never collected the $3,000.00.

NOTHDURFT advised that he did not know BILLY CUTOLO or i
GEORGE TROPIANO. He failed to identify a photograph of either CUTOLO
or TROPIANO at first, however later on he asked to lock at the photo-

younger of the two people who had come with SOWERS to threaten him.
He again reiterated that this was the only time he had ever met
CUTOLO. 7 .

: NOTHDURFT advised that he had never told SOWERS or
the two, mentioned above, that he had any connections whatsoever
- with the FBI. He said however, that when the three of them.confronted’
him they knew his son was in the FB] and that they accused him of
* being a retired FBI agent. He denied that he had ever indicated to
anyone that he could obtain FBI information and, in fact; he could
not obtain FBI information. He stated that he was willing to take
a polygraph examination concerning this or any other information
he had provided.

.
ae He advised that he had recently received a telephone

call from the police concerning SOWERS being involved in a murder.

He did not know the name of the victim or the other subjects involved.
He advised Lhe nate NAGI meant nothing to him-anc denied that he

knew him. i" :

NOTHDURFT stated that other than his son he did not know
any FBI agents and in his work as. Chief of Security he did not come
in.contact with FBI agents. He advised what limited contacts he
had with law enforcement were with the officers _at the 6lst Precinct.
He denied knowing anyone by the name ofCSTABILE or having ever heard
the name. : G

NOTHDURFT stated he is aware that some years ago Hill }
Brothers Stores in Brooklyn, New York, made a deal with some highly placed
hoodlums , whereby burglaries of these stores would cease for a speci- |
fied payoff. NOTHDURFT was not aware of the amount of money these
hoodlums received from Hill Brothers Stores, but understands it was
a substantial amount. In addition, he advised that Hill Brothers
Stores were not burglarized for a five-year period, which he, :
NOTHDURFT mnderstands was the agreed upon number of years during which
time the store would suffer no burglaries. :

7 On May 16, 1975, Supervisor FREDERICK LONERGAN,
Albany Division, Federal Bureau of Investigation, caused a check
to be made of the New York State Department of Audits, in an
effort to detetmine if New York State has an employee named STEVE
ADAMS working in the New York City area. It was determined no
~ one named "ADAMS" is employed by the State of New York in New York
City. .

Supervisor EDWARD D. HEGARTY caused inquiries to be |
made through FBIHQ Liaison Personnel of the United States Secret
Service, Alcohol Tobacco & Firearms Bureau, United States Customs
Service and the Internal Revenue Service, in an effort to determine
if any of these four agencies have an employee named STEVE ADAMS
instHe New York City area. It was determined that none of these
agenéies have an employee assigned to the New York City area named

: STEVE ADAMS.

' Supervisor Edward D. Hegarty caused a search
to bé made of FBI Headquarters records in an effort to
determine whether or not there is an employee of the New York
Office by the name of "ADAMS" and whether or not there has
been any FBI employee at New York City by the name of ADAMS
since January 1, 1970. FBI Héadquarters records reflect
that there is currently no employee of the New York Office
by the name of ADAMS. Since January 1, 1970 through date
of record review April 29, 1975, there were two persons
bearing the surname "ADAMS" employed in the New York Division,
namely: .

+ a JOYCE E. ADAMS:

Miss ADAMS was ‘born January 26, 1952, at Newark,
New Jersey. She entered on duty at New York as a clerk- typist
July 6, 1970, and was promoted to clerk-stenographer November 28,
1971, at New York. On March 20, 1972, she was transferred from
the,New York Office to the Newark Office from where she
Yesigned on August 18, 1972. Her reason for leaving was to
obtain émployment with an employer located closer to her
residence. A review of Miss ADAMS personnel records reflects
she was a satisfactory employee. 7 :

DONALD HALT, ADAMS:

Mr. ADAMS was born December 11, 1913, at Johnstown,
Pennsylvania, and was graduated from Penn State, State College,
Pennsylvania, in 1938. He entered on duty as an FBI employee
April 26, 1943, and was assigned to the New York Division on

- August 9, 1945, where he remained until his retirement on
June 30, 1972. A review of his personnel records indicates
he was almost exclusively assigned to non-criminal type
investigations. There is no indication in his personnel records
that.he was ever involved in investigations relating to
organized crime figures.

who is-also known by: other nemes, after voluntarily signing
a waiver consenting to a Polygraph examination, was afforded
a Polygraph examination in the New York Office by Supervisor,
Te , Robert Pearce, and assisted by Special Agent. Klaus C. Rohr.

oo "The “purpose of the Polygraph examination of
- Guillermo Sowers, also kmown as, was to determine the truth-
fulness :of his’ statements he had made to the’ Federal Bureau
.of Investigation in which allegations were nade that Billy
Cutolo, George Tropiano and James Nagi, from 1972 until Nagi's-
murder in 1974, at certain periods. of time directly Gold
Sowers or that Sowens was part of a conversation in which
these three individuals alleged that they had a connection
within the Federal Government. Sowers claimed, among other
things, that this: alleged contact was paid money in return.
for information. «The contact was called "Joe the Fed, Our
Friend; The Fed, Joe. Stubs (per Sowers ‘like a theatre ticket
stub')",. “That on one ogcasion Cutolo in Sowers presence in
1972 gave Jimmy Nagi a ‘slip of paper ‘with the neme(Yoe Stabile)
or“a similar-sounding name on it as a person: who would help
Nagi with a'case Nagi had at that time in the State of
New Jersey. -Sowers believed, he stated, that this name
was-the contact. Another point mede by Sowers was that
Catolo, in 1974, had indicated a desire to travel to
Connecticut with Sowers as Cutolo was going to visit."Joe
the Fed", who was. thon in Boston, Massachusetts.

interviews" and has no belief in thom.

. 2. -One commercial Polygraph oxamination of him
in ‘connection with employment, according to Sowers, showed
oe . he was telling the truth when he lied and. showéd he was lying
| when he was telling ‘the truth.

i : ; Be Sowers, even though fluent in English, stated
i he. "thinks in Spanish", thereby causing. délays in answers,:_
| : and which in itself ‘registers on the Folygraph chart and

H : : makes chart, interpretation accordingly more difficult.

7 .. 4. “Sowers at the present time is furnishing informa- ,
tion involving. alleged murders, including the murder of Jimny .
Nagi,-and the- subject matter at hand creates a situation in
which it is: difficult: to place fptere -under the proper agin
of. stress; .

A complete set of questions, including relevant,
irrelevant, control or guilt complex. questions, are inciuded :
as an addendum to this niemorandum.

7 Sowers , in pre and. post-Polygraph - interviews -
furnished.no additional information. He enlarged on previous
information provided the.Federal Bureau of Investigation. ‘He
indicated he had no present health problems, no high or low.
-blood pressure, no respiration problems, was not on medication
and claimed that he was rested. : :

H aaa The. first series of questions, May 14, 1975,
showed routine nervousness, at the beginning of examinations
and questions 1 and 2. At the first relevant question,
(ana . . Question #3, "Have you deliberately given the FBI any false
i information about Joe the Fed, answer No," showed a slight
emotional response chartered in an increased blood pressure,
.followed by a relief combined with a change of breathing
pattern. It is pointed out that chartered reactions at the
first relevant question are not unusual but are indicative
of stress and not: necessarily a response’ showing deception,

-2-

NW 68262 Docld:32989576 Page 233



The strongest emotional response in Series I
was to Question #7, "During the sumer of 1972 did you
see -Bill Cutolo give Nagi a slip of yaper with the name

Stabi g)on it?", answer "Yes".

Additionally, tho. re is an emotional response to an
over-all verification question, #10, "Have you lied to ab |
least one question in this test?", answer "No". In the chart
interpretation comparison was made to the responses chartered
to a control question, "Did you ever deliberately frame
“someone?", answer "No", and to a guilt complex question,
Question #9, ."Were you. in any way involved in the Lopensin
murder?", answer "Io".

In the control type questions and guilt complex:
question, emotional responses were less than the pertinent
sched #7, and particularly to.a lesser degree question,
Hf. ia 7

meee In en effort to place Sowers. at the proper ‘stress
level and to chart responses to a known lie, he was requested
to choose a number between 3.and 8, and thereafter, in Series
2, when asked to answer No to. such’ questiens, i.e., “Did you
choose #1; Did you choose i #2", etc.

The know lie was recorded at. Question #5, and
shows changing in breathing pattern, a readily noticeable
. Tise in the Galvonic skin response, with a slight increase
in blood pressure, followed by a more .routine rhythmatic
breathing pattern, and less body movement or deep ait being
noticeable. :

Immediately at ‘the completion of Series 2,
Sowers was advised that the exact same questions asked in
Series 1 be repeated in the order they were asked.in Saries 1.

: The chartered responses in Series 3 were again of
similar severity with the most noticeable being a response to
Question #7, dealing with an alleged slip of paper with the.
name (Joe Stal on it, and to a lesser degree Question #3,
directed towards ascertaining if Sowors had deliberately given
the Federal Bureau of Investigation false information’ about
"Joe the Fed".

NW 68262 Docld:32989576 Page 234



NW 68262 Docld:32989576 Page 235

Tt is the: opinion of ‘the Polyeraph operator
that Sowers. has furnished some false information to tha;
Federal: Bureau of Investigation (Question #3) and has
not told: the complote truth in response to Question #7.
At this point Sowers -was questioned in regards to the
emotional responses chartered and made the point that he
did not know if there.was such a person as (Joe Stabile)
believed only one-half of what Billy Cutold told hin,
- reiterated that most of the information he know came 7
from Cutolo in regards to "Joe the-Fed". . Sowers continued
to maintain that he was being truthful, as to what he had
been told personally, but made the point that -he had caught
Cutolo in several lies. He cottinued to maintain, however,
that he believed some of the information that Cutolo had —
told him about "Joe the Fed" because of the facts of the
situation. involved, such as being given a list @ automobiles
and trucks by description and license numbers allegedly being
- used by ‘the, Federal Bureau of Investigation Agents in 1972.

5 In Series 4, - Question. #3, dealing With a list of
cars ‘given Sowers. by Gutolo- shows no emotional responsas
indicative of deception, nor is there an.emotional response .
to Question #5, dealing with the point whether or not Cutolo,
in Sowers presence, gave Nagi instructions to set up an

appointment with "Joe Stubs". There-is a chartered response
to control Question #6, "Have you ever committed ea crime
you have not confessed to?", answer "Yes". ‘There isa

greater response to Quéstion #9, "Did you hear Cutolo say he
paid 5, 000. 00 for good infornation?", answer "Yes",

“Tt is the opinion of: the Polygraph examiner that
Sowers has not told the complete truth in regards to this
particular point. It is noted,. however. the response could
possibly -be one of confusion as Sowers had told varying
accounts of this, and at first indicated that this conversa—
tion pertained to another "Fed", possibly named Adams. ‘The
point.of Adams was cleared up during interview and it is
‘probable that if ‘there was an additional contact named
Adams, the contact was with the New York State authorities
‘investigating liquor and cigarette tax matters as Adams .
allegedly furnished information in regards to these activities.



Question number 7, dealing with the statement’ that
Sowers Saw an Enery Air: Freight truck on numerous occasions:
in the vicinity of the Burger Prince; was repeated twice.
“An Enery Air Freight truck was alleged to be on the list
of cars being used oy Federal Bureau of Investigation agents in
1972. The responses do not necessarily indicate deception. aes

Series 5 was at the end -of the day and ‘because of the
fatigue factor, no interpretation is being made of any of the
questions involved. tinent points of relevant questions
were  mepeated on May 15, 1975... :

There were no significant an responses —
7 chartered. in Series 7. 7 :

In Series 8 the most reaction was to, Question 49,

an irrelevant question, “Were you in the Marines’" Answer ~
"Yes", which indicates that Sowers probably has not told the
-complete truth about his service in the United States Marines.
The possibility exists that the response may have been in
connection with activity legal or illegal while Sowers was 5
in the Marines.. To the control question, "Have you evor smoked
pot in- your life?" Answer - "Yes", there is also a- significant
emotional response, These responses were greater than to any
of the relevant questions. There was a slightly severe response
to Question #8, answer "No", "Do you believe you will be .°
rewarded for ’télling the BBL abouts Joe the Fed?" It was

noted that Sowers smiled when being asked this question, and
muscular movement of the smile was chartered and it is noted
in“pointing out that the response is probably not one of
‘deception.

... Series #9 shows a noticeable response to Question #4,
"Did you lie to any of my questions yesterday? Answer -— "No",
fo control Question oy ‘apia you ever commit a crime in
Florida you have not confessed to?" ‘shows a less severe |
“emotional response. Sowers said: the crime was failure to pay
alimony. .¢ : : 7

Series #10 shows no severe emotional responses.

-o7

aw 68262 Docld:32989576 Page 236



Series #11, almost direct interrogation, was :

’ directed towards ascertaining if Sowers was truth telling en
. when lk stated that "Joe the Fed" originally was a contact -

for Joe Gentile, also known as Joe Lane, "Greg" (Gregory

Scarpa) and Dutchy, whose complete identity is unknown to

Sowers. Additionally, efforts were made to ascertain if

Sowers knew any of scveral other ‘people. There was no 7

strong emotional-response indicated to any of the questions.

There- was; however, beginning at Question #6,‘ chartered

reactions caused by Sowers swallowing. There was no conclusion

that there was a deceptive answer to any of these questions.

The final series was a repeat of Series #1. There.
was similar chartered reactions to both Question #3 end roa
Question #7 of this series, which again indicates that Sowcz's
is not telling the.complete truth to the Federal Bureau of: |
Investigation and has not told the complete truth in regards..
to his.statement that he has seen the name (Jos seph Stabile)
or a similar sounding name on a piece of paper in 1972.

In the post-Polygreph intervi eu, Sowers was ‘questioned
as to how he could recall a name on a piece of p aper | in 1972
and had never had the name repeated to him since that date. .
He said he had a photographic memory, It is indicated that-
fo thepossibility exists that Sowers did see a name being written
on a piece of paper, but is at this date reluctant to change
his story and perhaps admit that he cannot recall specifically
what the name is on the paper.

BEE The conclusions made by Polygraph examiner are made
with limitations and considerations as set forth above.
