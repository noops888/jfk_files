Dear Mr. Marwell:

Enclosed is the diplomatic note received from the Mexican *

- government, dated March 12, 1997, which responds to the ARRB/s
request for any additional documents that the Mexican e
government might have relating to the assassination of
President John F. Kennedy. The, Embassy evidently submitted the
request to the Mexican government on June 13, 1996, but:did not
report the action through telegraphic channels. The reference
in the telegram is to our recent query.

The Mexican government note conveys copies of the
diplomatic notes exchanged between Mexico and the United States
in 1963-1964 regarding the initial U.S. request for Mexican
documents relevant to the investigation into Lee Harvey
Oswald’s visit to Mexico in the fall of 1963. Most of these
notes were published in volume XVIII of the Warren Commission
Report. They also duplicate copies of the same correspondence
found in Legal Adviser’s and Mexico City post files that are
included in State’s collection at NARA. I have stamped
enclosed copies of pages bearing "confidential" classification
markings. I am also enclosing a copy of Mexico City telegram

wv 3078 of March 31.

According to my records, we have now received responses
from all posts contacted through the A bureau. Minsk remains
ongoing. -Final responses have been received from Bonn, Paris,
London, Moscow, and now.Mexico City. Interim ‘responses. have
been received from from Tokyo and Ottawa. As it has been some
tinie since Tokyo reported that the Japanese government would be
searching for documents, the ARRB might wish to prepare a
followup cable.

Sincerely,

me

Re: Request to CIA to contact ifiaigon channel§ regarding LIENVOY intercepts of
Oswald telephone calls in Mexico City

Some time ago the Review Board requested informally that CLA contact(its-liaison )
€hannels)in Mexico City for information related to Lee Harvey Oswald. During your
recent visit here we discussed with you the feasibility of your making such contacts. I
am writing in response to your request that we memorialize our request and provide
some background information.

The Review Board believes that all reasonable steps should be taken to account for all
telephonic intercepts of Oswald during his vigit to Mexico City in September-October
1963. There is evidence that CIA intercepted so some telephone calls through an operation:
named LIENVOY (Conducted jointly with components iS of the Mexican government) We
believe that it would be appropriate for CIA to contact Giredtly

fo inquire as to whether the Mexican authorities retained copies of LIENVOY
telephonic take, specifically the actual recordings of Oswald's telephone calls to the
Soviet Embassy during the period of September 27 through October 3, 1963.

The Review Board previously has sought information from the Mexican Government
through appropriate diplomatic channels. For reasons that are obvious to those
familiar with Mexico City issues, the Review Board could not raise with Mexican
Officials nor with the U.S. State Department the possible existence of additional tape
recordings that might be in the hands of certain officials. Thus, at the behest of the
Review Board, the Department of State requested that the Mexican federal government
and local government agencies conduct general searches of their files for records
related to the assassination of President Kennedy. The Mexican government responded

by sending copies of the same documentation and correspondence that the GOM had.
made available to the Warren Commission in 1964.

The basis for our interest in your contacting Appropriate Me ‘Mexican offidials'is found in
CIA document 104-10004-10199, which was reviewed by the Board on September 19,
1995. On page 5 of this document (not including the cover sheet) information that the
Board agreed to protect, due to the sensitivity of sources and methods involved,
suggests that the Mexican security forces may have had their own copy of the October 1
intercept on Lee Harvey Oswald. It is unclear whether this statement refers to the
transcript or to an actual tape containing the phone call. Nevertheless, it provides
enough evidence to warrant additional inquiries on this matter.

For your reference we are enclosing copies of the reference documents as well as copies
of the correspondence between the DOS and the Mexican government.

We would appreciate your contacting appropriate o! ofticiald to determine what
reasonably can be known about this and related matters, and ask that you provide a
response to this request by November 14, 1997. We are fully aware of the sensitivity of
this type of request and do not wish to take any action that would compromise existing
intelligence operations. If necessary, we would be pleased to-discuss with you ways in
which we might further elaborate on this request, including person-to-person
discussions with appropriate officials either here or in Mexico.

Fred Wickham, DO/IMS

FROM: John F. Pereira
Chief, CSI/HRG

SUBJECT: Priority Request from Chairman,
JFK Assassination Records Board

1. (S) The purpose of this memorandum is to advise you of a
priority request from the Chairman of the JFK Assassination Records
Review Board (ARRB). The request concerns records related to Lee
Harvey Oswald that may be held by the Mexican Government.

2. (S) At his initiative, I met recently with the ARRB
Chairman, Judge John Tunheim. He said the reason for the meeting was
to ask that CIA assist the Board by making inquiries }to
determine if the Mexican Government has certain records related to
Oswald's activities in Mexico in late 1963. Of particular interest
is whether (the Mexicans havé copies of tapes from joint)

is,’ including coverage of Oswald’s telephone calls
assy.) He said that locating such records is “the
highest priority of the Board.” (The attached letter from the
ARRB‘s General Counsel explains the Board‘s interest.)

3. (S) Earlier this year, the Board sought unsuccessfully
to obtain information about Oswald from the Mexican Government |
via the State Department. (See attached cable.) Mexico responded

by providing copies of the same material that had been made
available to the Warren Commission in 1964. The problem for the
Board was that, in making the request to Mexico, it did not want
to reveal information about [ jthat
the Board knew of from CIA records. Being sensitive to the
Agency's request: to protect this information, Tunheim would like
the Agency to contact directly} on the Board's
behalf. iz isaaenacateat

Subject: CIA-IR-05 Possible Foreign Source for Records on Oswald

The Review Board requested that the CIA assist in locating and acquiring records
relevant to Lee Harvey Oswald and the assagsination of President John Kennedy which
might exist in the files of a foreign government agency. Due to the foreign liaison
sensitivity of this request, information on this issue was passed between the CIA,
Review Board Chairman Judge John Tunheim, and one Review Board staff member.

On September 15, 1998, Chairman Tunheim and I flew to Houston to consult with CIA
Directorate of Operations officers on the likelihood of the existence of additional
records and the possibility that the CLA would be successful in acquiring these records.
These CIA officers demonstrated that they had consulted numerous times with the
senior officials of the foreign government but had, thus far, been unsuccessful in
obtaining additional records or in confirming, visually, the existence of additional
records, The CIA agreed to continue to work to obtain these records.

Re: Status of CIA Responses to Assassination Records Review Board’s Requests for
ition: tion and Records -

Dear John:

Iam writing to follow-up on our telephone call earlier today and to convey my serious
concern about the status of CIA’s responses to the Review Board’s requests for
additional information and records. Although CIA has completed its responses to
several requests, and many others have been answered in part, a significant number of
requests have not been answered — including some that were made more than two
years ago. On many occasions we have been assured that responses would be
forthcoming, only to have promised dates come and go without answers. It is now
extremely important that these requests be answered promptly so that we may conduct
a proper follow-up if necessary. The issues that we can now identify as being of the
highest priority are identified in the text below by double asterisks (**)' and we request
that they be answered within the next month. We request that the remaining requests
be answered by April 1, 1998.

The remainder of this letter is divided into two parts: first, a listing of the formal
requests for information and records, and second, a listing of the informal requests for
information and records. Please let me know if your understanding of any of the
following points differs from ours so that we can resolve any potential discrepancies.

"As identified more fully below, the issues are: CIA-1 Organizational Material,
CIA-6 Cables and Dispatches, CLA-13 Backchannel Communications, CLA-IR-03
HTLINGUAL Documents, CIA-IR-04 Disposition of Angleton Files, CLA-IR-07 Claude

is awaiting confirmation that these documents are at HRG for processing.

CIA-IR-05 Possible Foreign Source for Records on Oswald.

CIA was informally requested to use its contacts to pursue certain records
telated to Oswald that were orally described to CIA. The Review Board.
understands that the CIA has taken steps to pursue these records.

CIA-IR-06 QKENCHANT.

The Review Board seeks information regarding the purpose of QKENCHANT
and its connection with Clay Shaw, Howard Hunt, and Monroe Sullivan.
