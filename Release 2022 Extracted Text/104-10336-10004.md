ASSASSIRATION HICORDS

Dear Mr. Marwell:

Enclosed is the diplomatic note received from the Mexican

government, dated March 12, 1997, which responds to the ARRB's

request for any additional documents that the Mexican

government might have relating to the assassination of

President John F. Kennedy.

The, Embassy evidently submitted the

request to the Mexican government on June 13, 1996, but did not

report the action through telegraphic channels. The reference

in the telegram is to our recent query.

The Mexican government note conveys copies of the

diplomatic notes exchanged between Mexico and the United States

in 1963-1964 regarding the initial U.S. request for Mexican

documents relevant to the investigation into Lee Harvey

Oswald's visit to Mexico in the fall of 1963:

Most of these

notes were published in volume XVIII of the Warren Commission

Report:

They also duplicate copies of the same correspondence

found in Legal Adviser's and Mexico City post files that are

included in state's collection at NARA.

enclosed

I have stamped

copies of pages bearing "confidential" classification

markings.

I am also enclosing a copy of Mexico City telegram

~ 3078 of March 31.

According to my records, we have now received responses

from all posts contacted through the A bureau.

Minsk remains

ongoing. Final responses have been received from Bonn, Paris,

London,

Moscow, and now Mexico City.

Interim responses have

been received from from Tokyo and ottawa.

As it has been some

time since Tokyo reported that the Japanese government would be

searching for documents, the ARRB might wish to prepare a

followup cable.

Sincerely,

lena leins

Re:

Request to CIA to contact liaison channels regarding LIENVOY intercepts of

Oswald telephone calls in Mexico City

Some time ago the Review Board requested informally that CLA contact(its liaison

channels in Mexico City for information related to Lee Harvey Oswald. During your

recent visit here we discussed with you the feasibility of your making such contacts. I

am writing in response to your request that we memorialize our request and provide

some background information.

The Review Board believes that all reasonable steps should be taken to account for all

telephonic intercepts of Oswald during his visit to Mexico City in September-October

1963. There is evidence that CIA intercepted some telephone calls through an operation

named LIENVOY (conducted jointly with components of the Mexican government, We

believe that it would be appropriate for CIA to contact directly

to inquire as to whether the Mexican authorities retained copies of LIENVOY

telephonic take, specifically the actual recordings of Oswald's telephone calls to the

Soviet Embassy during the period of September 27 through October 3, 1963.

The Review Board previously has sought information from the Mexican Government

through appropriate diplomatic channels. For reasons that are obvious to those

familiar with Mexico City issues, the Review Board could not raise with Mexican

officials nor with the U.S. State Department the possible existence of additional tape

recordings that might be in the hands of certain officials. Thus, at the behest of the

Review Board, the Department of State requested that the Mexican federal government

and local government agencies conduct general searches of their files for records

related to the assassination of President Kennedy. The Mexican government responded

by sending copies of the same documentation and correspondence that the GOM had

made available to the Warren Commission in 1964.

The basis for our interest in your contacting appropriate Mexican Officials is found in

ClA document 104-10004-10199, which was reviewed by the Board on September 19,

1995. On page 5 of this document (not including the cover sheet) information that the

Board agreed to protect, due to the sensitivity of sources and methods involved,

suggests that the Mexican security forces may have had their own copy of the October 1

intercept on Lee Harvey Oswald. It is unclear whether this statement refers to the

transcript or to an actual tape containing the phone call. Nevertheless, it provides

enough evidence to warrant additional inquiries on this matter.

For your reference we are enclosing copies of the reference documents as well as copies

of the correspondence between the DOS and the Mexican government.

We would appreciate your contacting appropriate officials to determine what

reasonably can be known about this and related matters, and ask that you provide a

response to this request by November 14, 1997. We are fully aware of the sensitivity of

: this type of request and do not wish to take any action that would compromise existing

intelligence operations. If necessary, we would be pleased to discuss with you ways in

which we might further elaborate on this request, including person-to-person

discussions with appropriate officials either here or in Mexico.

Thank you for your continued assistance and cooperation.

Sincerely yours,

The request concerns records related to Lee

2. (S) At his initiative, I met recently with the ARRB

Chairman, Judge John Tunheim. He said the reason for the meeting was

to ask that CIA assist the Board by making inquiries

Oswald's activities in Mexico in late 1963. Of particular interest

to the Board is whether the Mexicans have copies

(S) At his request, I met with the Chairman of the JFK Board, Judge Jack Tunheim this morning for more than an hour. A principal

topic of discussion was the status of the Agency's response to Tunheim's request that we ask

to provide records and

other information related to Oswald's time in Mexico. (The station is following up on a preliminary response

(FOUO)Tunheim described efforts the Board is making to obtain records directly from the KGB, with State Department assistance. Not

much success so far.

(FOUO) We also discussed the general relationship between the Board and CIA, about which he was very positive. He is aware that we

have added resources to step up the pace of our review in view of the 1 September deadline. He said that he does not see much chance

that Congress would extend the Board's charter again.

Ed: Tunheim asked that we set up a meeting with you on 18 Feb, when he'll be in town for a meeting of the Board.

CIA-IR-05 Possible Foreign Source for Records on Oswald

The Review Board requested that the CIA assist in locating and acquiring records

relevant to Lee Harvey Oswald and the assassination of President John Kennedy which

might exist in the files of a foreign government agency. Due to the foreign liaison

sensitivity of this request, information on this issue was passed between the CIA,

Review Board Chairman Judge John Tunheim, and one Review Board staff member.

On September 15, 1998, Chairman Tunheim and I flew to Houston to consult with CIA

Directorate of Operations officers on the likelihood of the existence of additional

records and the possibility that the CIA would be successful in acquiring these records.

These CIA officers demonstrated that they had consulted numerous times with the

senior officials of the foreign government but had, thus far, been unsuccessful in

obtaining additional records or in confirming, visually, the existence of additional

records. The CIA agreed to continue to work to obtain these records.

Re: Status of CIA Responses to Assassination Records Review Board's Requests for

Additional Information and Records

Dear John:

I am writing to follow-up on our telephone call earlier today and to convey my serious

concern about the status of CIA's responses to the Review Board's requests for

additional information and records. Although CLA has completed its responses to

several requests, and many others have been answered in part, a significant number of

requests have not been answered - including some that were made more than two

years ago. On many occasions we have been assured that responses would be

forthcoming, only to have promised dates come and go without answers. It is now

extremely important that these requests be answered promptly so that we may conduct

a proper follow-up if necessary. The issues that we can now identify as being of the

highest priority are identified in the text below by double asterisks (**)' and we request

that they be answered within the next month. We request that the remaining requests

be answered by April 1, 1998.

The remainder of this letter is divided into two parts: first, a listing of the formal

requests for information and records, and second, a listing of the informal requests for

information and records. Please let me know if your understanding of any of the

following points differs from ours so that we can resolve any potential discrepancies.

'As identified more fully below, the issues are: CIA-1 Organizational Material,

CLA-6 Cables and Dispatches, CIA-13 Backchannel Communications, CLA-IR-03

HTLINGUAL Documents, CLA-IR-04 Disposition of Angleton Files, CIA-IR-07 Claude

Documents file: documents Nos. 496, 498, 499, 500, and 510. The Review Board

is awaiting confirmation that these documents are at FIRG for processing.

CIA-IR-05 Possible Foreign Source for Records on Oswald.

CIA was informally requested to use its contacts to pursue certain records

related to Oswald that were orally described to CIA. The Review Board

understands that the CIA has taken steps to pursue these records.

CIA-IR-06 QKENCHANT.

The Review Board seeks information regarding the purpose of QKENCHANT

and its connection with Clay Shaw, Howard Hunt, and Monroe Sullivan.

The Review Board was initially provided some information in regard to this

request that now appears to be incorrect. CIA is now seeking additional

information to correct or to clarify its previous answers. The Review Board seeks

an immediate, full, and accurate formal response to this request. Once the formal

statement is provided, this request will be complete.

**CLA-IR-07 Claude Barnes Capehart.

The ARRB staff has reviewed all records that CLA has been able to locate to date.

During the course of this review, additional questions were raised that CIA

agreed to pursue. CIA also agreed to conduct additional searches to determine

whether there may be additional retrievable records on Mr. Capehart. The

Review Board seeks a full and accurate formal response to this request. Once the

formal statement is provided, this request will be complete.

• CIA-IR-08 Unredacted Copy of the "Family Jewels" Memoranda.

ARRB has reviewed a redacted version of the "Family Jewels." Additional

questions have been raised. At meeting between HIRG, ARRB and the DCI/IRO

on December 11, 1997, specific redacted pages were identified for ARRB staff

review. These pages should be made available as soon as possible.
