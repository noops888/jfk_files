Oral History Interview

with

July 11, 1976 ;
Alexandria, Virginia

By Dennis J. O'Brien

For the John F. Kennedy Library

I think a logical place to begin in anything
like this is just.simply with the question;
when did you first meet Président Kennedy,
or Senator Kennedy, if you met him before
he was President?
I don't recall meeting him before he was

President. The first meeting, was / -L-believe,
the first Saturday following the inauguration,

whatever date that was. I.was called into a

meeting in the White House by [Robert s-)

“McNamara. It was a meeting, soa actually, on

a report that I had i for (Dwight a)

popular in other parts of the governmentey
I gathered that there was some opposition to
my going out, and he insisted on it. ;
I'd like to cone back to that. I wonder if
we could go on to talk about one. of the major
problems, which is Cuba. When is the first

revolutionary objectives and the capture of the
revolutionary movement by the Communist Party,
which surprised many of the supporters of
Castro as a guelilla and as x revolutionary

of Cubans who either had been supporters of

thinking thabathie--and incidentally, the
French General [Paul] Ely before he left. was
thinking the same way--just in terms of
contigency plannings they saw a lot of artil-

army. So, ‘vetng given that information, they
saw any attack or military trouble in Vietnam

as consisting of divisions of North Vietnamese

with a lot of artillery and armor coming
across the border. So they built up an army

to meet the foreseeable thing that was neopeninsh,,

that they thought might happen. 7 Instead of

this, of course, it was more of the same old
