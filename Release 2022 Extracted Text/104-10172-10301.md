‘The conversation then turned to Costille’s recext vacation in Lapland.
Golub again told Costilie that he was net going te be able to take

vacation thie year as the new Aubassador vanted tim to cenaia in Helsinki.
Goiub then stated to Coutil'e, *I have heard that yos speek flnert Russian.”
Costille stated that thet vas very complimentary but that he spoke about

‘ac good Russian as Golub spoke Faglich. Gostille told hin that he hed
studied Russian at the University of California and on his own but that
about all he cowld do now wae underatand and read sono and thet vhat litte
epeaking ability he had waa practically gone. Golud coumented it was

good thet Costille kuew some Ruaviaa and said thai more Anericans should
atody it. Golub thea asked why Costille was not trying to improve his
Russian, Costille enewered that ho was trying to learn to spesk Finnish
aud that 1t was too much of a chore to study two leszuages at the same tine.
Golub sald that vhat Costille neeted was more prectice im Kussian and pro-
oveded to speak in Rusaien, In eatuality Qostille’s Russian bas decreased
considerably amd he vas able to pasily convines Geleb that his Russian was
fer from flusst, Ae waa mentioned in previous dispatches, Coatille had
never attempted to conceal fron Golub the fact that he knew Russien, The
4esue just never cee tp, Since Golub is flusnt ia Finnish, the common
language eutasativally beosme Pimaish. If wo hal realized thie Golub
contact was going to be so frequent, we vould heve mado it a pint at the
first to be the one to tell Golub that Contille kaws coms Russian, This
might have made Golub.a Little suspicious, At the lest meeting Costille
had. mentioned to Golub that he bad been stulying Russian sone. Golub

did not respond, so evidently he either did not hear or understand Costille,

Golub asked Costille vhat other languages he hed statied, Costille toid
hin be hed studied Spanish in high school, Golub sald that this vas sn
easy lenguege and not stulied too much in the Soviet Union, After meking
this remark, he quickly corrected hinself and stat~i that « large percentage
of the world spoke Spanish end that it was becoming a much more populer
language in the Soviet Union, Costille mentioned thet Russien kad becone
a very popular language in the States and thet withia the lest two years
his high school in California, which was quite mall, even ies offering the
Ruselen lenguage, This eesued to impress Golub.

Gib tase
Walle speaking Russian to Costille, Golub began using the familiar form of
the language rather than the polite form which the tvo had alvays used, He
looked at Costille and asked if it vould bo alright to use first names,
Whea Costille agreed, he reached across the table an: atook Coatille’s
hand, Ho than tald Costille that was a ney Cultural Offiosr in the
