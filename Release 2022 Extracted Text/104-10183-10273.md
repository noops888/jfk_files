ANALYSIS ABOUT THE POLITICAL INFORNATION WORK:

BACKGROUND:

a) MEXICO

he lack of information about MEXICO and events taking

place there

Concretely we can point ou

political situation of Mexico.

since the Center

level, it appears, to obtain this type of information.

With regard to the relations with Mexico or the official

policy of the

country.

we can point out that although the in-

formation receired is

larger in volume, this work is not ex-

ploiting the information

facilities.

Besides. in the first as well as the second case, the

sources available to the Center are not known in the Informa-

tion Service.

Ne can deduce the information capabilities bj

analyzing circles or individuals from whom the information is

obtained.

However,

le don't know what the relations are be-

tween the Center and these informants, therefore we cannot

guide the information collection effort:

b) CENTRAL AMERICA

The information with regard to this region is still

worse than in respect

to MEXICO. As far as political in-

formation is concerned, we note

the absence of sources

of information and of concrete information about current

matters.

Information about the political life of these countries

is almost nil, especially with regard to current matters.

In,

formation about political matters is frequently received from

this

region, but almost always they refer to reports from a

specific

source about his own party or about disagreements,

very generalized, with cther leftist forces.

Lately. for the last three or four months (actually

since early September), a decrease in the total volume of

formation received has been observed, especially with regard

to intelligence information about the national liberation

movement in Central America.

With regard to other matters

(political life. relations

with Cuba,

solidarity, etc.) the

fact is that we have received information, although very

limited.

c) THE CARIBBEAN

With respect to Santo Domingo and Haiti, we can say

that the job in

these two countries is nil, as far as the

collection of information is concerned.

We have only received from

Haiti, since the month of

May. two or three information, reports of limited value and

they were received through M-N.

With

regard to Santo Domingo the situation is very

similar.

Although some information reports have been l'e-

ceived, they come

fron public (overt) sources (newspapers

from progressive

pings. etc.) and occasionaily

urganizations, martifical reports about

newspaper clip-

current events

and the way of struggle

in

the country,

drafted by a member of a progressive organization.

NEEDS:

a) MEXICO

Given the importance of the situation in lexico,

Cuba, basically because it is an important way of contact with

Latin America, it is NECESSARY to reinforce our job as far as

its RELATIONS. WITH CUBA is concerned.

This means that we are

interested and need to intensify our work with the official

these relations and above all of the North American plans and

- MEXICO with regard to their relations with Cuba

and the Mexican position to that respect.

Similarly, we are interested in second place in knowing

about the situation among the political forces in MEXICO,

especially with regard to leftist forces and their role and

importançe individually.

And lastly, it is necessary, in our opinion, to develop

an organized and methodical task, according to the guidelines

and objectives of the plan, with

the available sources of in-

formation from the Section or the Center in Mexico so as to

use them more rationally.

IT SHOULD BE POINTED OUT THAT IN

THIS SECTION,

AS WELL AS IN M-S, A TENDENCY TO OBTAIN INFORMA-

TION FROM SOURCES IN CUBA IS NOTED.

b) CENTRAL AMERICA

In this region it

is necessary to emphasize the obtain-

of information about

of agression

in Cuba,

cially with regard to possibilities of collective action

against Cuba.

On the other hand, work should be strengthened with

regard to the situation and plans of the national liberation

movement in the region and in each country.

An effort should

be made to get to know, completely, what the role and the

position of every leftist force is, since there are countries,

like Nicaragua, where it is not known, due to lack of informa-

tion, what role each force is playing and which are their

with us.

We consider that we must establish con-

tacts to work constantly and periodically with each of the

leftist forces in these countries. Only this way we will be

able to overcome the deficiency.

situation in these countries is very serious. from

the standpoint

the information work.

As we have said, we

no information about them.

He consider that the first

matter to solve is to know the sources from which we can

obtain information

and at the same time establish contact

with all the friendly forces in order to obtain information.

ANALISIS ABOUT INFORMATION ON ENEMY ACTIVITIES WORK:

BACKGROLND:

(bout the information work with countries in the M-A

regard to information about counter-revolutionary-

type andagression plans we can point out, in general, its

principal successes and deficiencies.

Through previous experience and the analysis of informa-

tion received from

the countries of this Section concerning

counter-revolutionary activities, it was confirmed once more

that this

is

the zone preferred by Imperialism for locating

training camps for counter-revolutionary elements, getting

to the point where this assumes serious characteristics in

certain places or specific zones. such as the case of the

Peten zone in Guatemala and Puerto Cabezas and the Maiz Is-

lands in Nicaragua.

From information about this type of activity we can

incomplete and fragmentary, observing

in many cases the absolute lack of exploitation of a source;

this fact meant from the standpoint of our work serious dif-

ficulties. since this limited considerably our possibilities

through other different

sources, as well as a series of derivative difficulties such

lack of continuity in the information, lack of con-

of contact and guidance as to the source

Analyzing all these previous phenomena

out a definite guideline with regard to our work for this

Section during the forthcoming year, this guideline would

cover the following aspects that will be basic from the

standpoint of aggression plans.

Location of training camps for Cuban mercenaries,

conclusion

as to

the type of training they get and their

number, as

well as their resources.

2. Detection of enemy aggression plans through the

Armed Forces

of Central American

countries and through the so-much mentioned collective

action,

or something similar.

Location of uperations bases for pirate launches and

counter-revolutionary groups that will upcrate from nearby

countries.

This is directly related with the plans for

penetrating the enemy.

Penetrate and have full information about enemy's anti-

guerrilla plans and its development.

These would be the tasks

to be developed during the year, accordingly, and folloting

general

suidelines and objectives of the

current work.
