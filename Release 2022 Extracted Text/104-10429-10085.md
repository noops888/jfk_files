he vas going to leave the country and he'vas not an important’ person.

Mile OSWALD was in Minsk he received a stipend from the Red Cross.

KGB hed information on Marina OSWALD only after she announced her
intention to marry him. A record check, neighborhood, and employment oe
check on her showed that she was a simple, normal, not clever person, ~~
and she was not in the Young Communist League because she did not pay :
her dues. Some investigative reports said she was stupid. —_- 6

KGB did not consider using her in any capacity.-

OSWALD's case was not the same as other Americans in Russia because
he was considered not normal and he was not considered a defector as
were MARTIN and MITCHELL. .

SUBJECT heard that OSWALD applica in Mexico for return to Russia.
Word went from Mexico to the First Main Directorate to the Second Main
Directorate. Second Main Directorate told First Main Directorate that
he had tried suicide in Russia, married a Soviet citizen, departed Russia
and was: considered not normal so the request should be rejected.

SUBJECT was then shown some photographs and he said he had seen a
picture of Marina OSWALD in a mayizine.

A long list of names was read and shown to SUBJECT but he failed
