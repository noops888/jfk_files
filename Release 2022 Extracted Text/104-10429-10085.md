the exception of social amenities and a review of the notes SUBJFCI had

made since his last interview with the Case Officer, the interrogation

consisted of a review of the OSWALD case.

It was bosed on a verbatim

transcript the Case Officer had typed from the 3 July 1904 tape.

Case Officer (Thomas RYAN) questioned SUBJBCT on why KGB did not do

certain things such as run an investigation of OSWALD, check into his

Narine experience, etc.

On 29 July 1964 (a.m.) the doctor made his weckly exanination of

SUBJECT gave a brief run-down of his personal life before

discussion on how people obtain and keep guns in their homes in Russia.

OSWALD was a poor shot but on another occasion said he was a good marksman.

The Case Officer then went into a discussion of a Paris based, Anerican,

U. S. Government employee who was recruited by the KGB.

This individual was

still in Paris in January. 1964. He would make docunents available to KGB so

The Case Officer then started discussing the case of a Bulgarian,

GIORGIEV, who was arrested by the Bulgarians in Moscow in 1963. SUBJECT

obtained his information on this case from SHERAPIN and Alexander PAPOVICH

in 1963.

SUBJECI said GIORGIEV was invited to Moscow in 1963 at the suggestion

of the Bulgarian MVD.. He was settled in the Metropole Hotel and kept

under TV surveillance•

While he was in Moscow his rooms in Bulgaria

were searched and evidence was found (radio) which was sufficient for

the Deputy Chief of the Bulgarian MVD to go to koscow, arrest him and

return him to Bulgaria for questioning and trial or çourt martial:

SUBJECI went to Bulgaria in 1961 to help them on American cases.

He stated there was no suspicion of GIORGIEV at that time. GIORGIEV

had worked in the United States and was believed to have been recruited

at that time.

The Bulgarians, on confronting GIORGIEV in the Metropole Hotel,

said, "George DUVAI, you're under arrest".

At this point the interview ended and SUBJECT asked the Case Officer

to congratulate the boys and wish them all a good holiday for him. He

did this when the Case Officer said he did not think he would be back

on 3 July.

Friday, 3 July 1964 - The Case Officer wanted to discuss the KGB

involvement in the OSHALD case.

SUBJECT. said he did not know that OSWALD went to Moscow from Helsinki

but that OSWALD's visa application was processed in the normal manner

and KGB had a copy of the visa application.

Russian Embassies, since

1960, have authority to issue visas in three to five days after application.

OSWALD applied orally, and later in writing, for Soviet citizenship.

A copy of the written request went to KGB.

A copy of this request was

sent to the Supreme Soviet after OSWALD slashed his wrists.

KGB studied reports on OSWALD prepared by Case Officer KRUZNOF and

decided OSWALD was not normal so he was of no interest to KGB and has

not considered desirable for Soviet citizenship. His file was sent to

Minsk because he was to live and work in Minsk.

The American Embassy was not informed of his suicide attempt becaus

he was going to leave the country and he was not an important person.

While OSWALD was in Minsk he received a stipend from the Red Cross.

KGB had information on Marina OSWALD only after she announced her

intention to marry him. A record check, neighborhood, and employment

check on her showed that she was a simple, normal, not clever person,

and she was not in the Young Communist League because she did not pay

her dues.

Some investigative reports said she was stupid.

KGB did not consider using her in any capacity.

She has an uncle who is a Lieutenant Colonel in the Minsk militia.

She must be illegitimate because she does not use or. know her father!s."

The only surveillance ever put on OSWALD was an agent and there was ::

never any on Marina.

After their marriage her pay was increased to impress the foreigner

she married.

She was not asked to stay in Russia after marriage because he was

to leave and Russians believe & husband and wife should be together

(unless one is a high level person) .

Neither of the OSWALDs got any briefing or instructions before

leaving Moscow.

In addition to KRUZNOF and the SUBJECT, DUBAS and MUSHKOV were

the KGB Agents in Moscow who knew of the OSWALD case before the

assassination.

A Department Chief, JOMOKOV, and five other KGB Case

Officers knew of the case after the

assassination.

KGB considered OSHALD an American citizen because he had been

deniea Soviet citizenship.

KGB did not know any of OSWALD's personal contacts in fussia.

Some of the Intourist people OSWALD dealt with were KGB Agents

or contacts.

OSWALD's case was not the same as other Americans

in Russia because

he was considered not normal and he was not conside.ed

WerC MARTIN and MITCHELL.

SUBJECT heard that OSWALD applied in Mexico for return to Russia.

Word went from Mexico to the First Main Directorate to the Second Min

Directorate.

Second Main Directorate told First Main Directorate that

he had tried suicide in Russia, married a Soviet citizen,

and was considered not normal so the request should be rejected.

SUBJECT was then shown some photographs and he waid le had seen a

ricture of Marina OSWALD in a mayizine.

A long list

of names was read and shown to substel but he failed

to identily any of them.

Many of the nanes were of poople in Minsk.
