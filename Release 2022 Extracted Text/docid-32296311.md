in time to incorporate in same.

In certain cases different symbol numbers

have been

assigned informants in order

to protect the

identity of these sources.

USA LA COUR, New Orleans, Louisiana, on

10/3/68, advised that MANUEL, DUGAS, retired IRS Agent,

St. Charles Parish, La., had sent a Mr. LEE PERILLOUX

to call USA LA COUR; that PERILLOUX told LA COUR he

had been a former bartender at Moisant. Airport, Kenner,

La., and became acquainted with the MARCELLO boys and

persons they ran around with.

For a period of time,

he ran around with the MARCELLOs but realized he was

in the wrong crowd.

PERILLOUX said his wife had left

him and he believes she is still tied in with this

ADMINISTRATIVE:

that CARLOS MARCELIO

convicted and sentenced that he will be able

to get the

assault case thrown out on appeal. After his sentence, he

made some personal comments that he thought the FBI Agent

had been very fair in the trial in two ways:

1.

Because he insisted that MARCELLO did not

hit him even though some other witnesses

said otherwise, and

2.

Because he brought up the word "Mafia"

which almost caused a retrial and is the

basis for appeal.

MARCELLO has also stated that his prosecution on

this charge was because of politics and because sone people

in the Government have a personal animosity toward hin.

Informant advised that he is still unaware of any

business interests that MARCELLO might have in this area..

AGG/tjs

On July 17, 1968, HO 1251-PC advised

as follows:

He is well aware that law enforcement in the Houston

area consider him most likely connected to a big racketeering

organization such

as the Mafia, if there was such a thing.

While he admitted

he has done some things wrong in the past

he is not the rackeeter his reputation op his past recora

would. indicate.

He knows that his arrest record makes hin

100k Iike a criminal, buces a matter of racis

there are some

ariests on it that he does not desire to specify that are

actually frames or false arrests.

He advised that he has

never, been one to take harassment or abuse from law enforce-

ment or anyone else..

He personally knows of corrupt and brutal

lew enforcement treatment in past years.

As an example he confided that some years back he was

picked up by & couple

of detectives of the Barris County

Sheriff's Office:

He has always made

it a practice to never

tell lay enforcement anything, and to stand on his constitut-

ional right not to talk.

when they wanted to question him and

he continued to refuse

to answer or be quescioned, they

then

produced a contraption that they explained they planned to.

connecù to private parts of his body and to = Ford automobile

coil.

They were serious about using this tochnique in an

effort'to get information from him.

As they started to pin him down by force he

told

them 'that if they went ahead

with it they hod better kill

him

because no matter what they did with that device, or

whether they broke every bone

in his bodys

if they left him

alive he promised each one of then that he would see to it

they were killed, and he meant it.

When they realized he was serious they stopped the

proceedings and further abuse discontinued.

Upon his release he went in to soc Undersheriff

ILOYD FRAZIER and related the facts to him and repeated that,

ranyone connected to such activities or abuse against him or

friends or associates

of his would end up looking like a

sieve.

HO 92-86

The following informants of the Houston Division

were contacted by SA ALFRED G. GUNN:

HO 1170-C, negative concerning

MARCELLO's visit to Houston

Ho 1082-C,

negative concerning

MARCELLO's visit to Houston

HO 1251-2C advised SA GUNN that MARCELLO had indeed

been in Houston and had been in contact with him. He

claimed to have no knowledge as to the reason for MARCELLO's

visit to Houston but did. comment

that there

is no money

in the hotel business and he doubted

that he was in Houston

looking toward investments of that soct.

HO 1202-PC contacted 6/28/68, and 7/1/68, by

SA RICHARD W. SUTER.

This source advised that he felt he

would be able to obtain some information concerning MARCELLO's

visit; however, the person he would contact for such infor

mation is presently out of town.

He speculated that MARCELLO

may possibly have visited with LOUIE MARINO of Galveston

County, Texas,

stating that MARINO reportedly controls the

policy racket in Galveston County and that MARCELLO would

probably have interest in this business, and fucthermore he

is a friend of MARINO.

He stated that MARINO is a friend of STEVE OGERRO,

who owns a restaurant in Houston, and that MARIND and

MARCELLO have in the past visited Ogerro's Restaurant while

in Houston.

OGERRO is allegedly married to FNU MUSTACHIA,

a girl from New Orleans, Louisiana, whose father is

supposedly a good friend of MARCELLO's.
