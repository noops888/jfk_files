E. Wo agree with AKBUD-1's belief that the "bulletin"
should not be published in the WAVE area and further believe
that it is a publicity arm of the group and as such should come
out of their budyet if printed in other countrios. ‘e do not
consider this in the category of a separate propaganda project
deserving separate financing.

PF, Weare supporting the JUDEC delegation to Caracas.
