f-1, & confidential source abroad, has advised
that the publication "African Revolution" was. created by the
Algerian Front of National Liberation... Its English’ language
edition is published in Switzerland. There have been several
changes in the editorial composition and policy of “African /
Revolution" recently, ‘according to T-1. Following a dis-
agreenent ‘with BEN BELLA, JACQUES CAMILLE VERGES, the’
editor of the “publication, was dismissed from his functions.
VERGES is an Algerian fational who was born March 5, 1925.
His place as editor was taken by MOHAMED HARBI,’ former koe
Secretary General of the Algerian Ministry of Foreign ee
Affairs. Since HARBI became editor, the editorial: policy
has changed and the June, 1963, issue of “African Revolution"
indicated that the journal is now closely reflecting BEN
BELLA's policy and attempting to promote a more “Algerian

image. © ay

Although VERGES is no longer connécted with the
Algerian venture, he’ continues ‘to publish the Boglish. digest
of “African Revolution" from Lausanne, Switzerland, The
q July, 1963, issue was retitled “Afvica, Latin America,, Asia
i Revolution.” The phrase “the third world," which is now in.
vogue among VERGZS's ‘group to describe the underdeveloped
nations of Africa, South America and Asia, indicates the
scope ‘of the magazine in its new form. T-1 described this :
publication, with which VERGES is presently connected as pro- :
communist. ©: : :
