AFRICAN BEVOLUTION

a confidential source abroad,

has advised

that the publication

"African Revolution" was created by the

Algerian Front of National Liberation. Its English language

edition is published in switzerland.

There have been several

changes in the editorial composition and policy of "African

Revolution" recently, according to I-l.

Following a dis-

agreement with BEN BELLA, JACQUES CAMILLS VIRGES, the

editor of the publication, was dismissed from his functions.

VERGES is an Algerian national who was born March 6, 1925.

His place as editor vas taken by MOHAMED HARBI,

former

Secretary General of the Algerian Ministry of Foreign

Affairs:

Since HARBI became editor, the editorial policy

has changed and the June, 1963, issue of "African Revolution"

indicated that the journal is

now closely reflecting BEN

BELLA's policy

and attempting

: to promote a nore Algerian

image.

Although VERGES is no longer connected with the

Algerian venture, he continues to publish the English digest

of "African Revolution" from Lausanne, Switzerland.

1963,

The

issue was retitled "Africa, Latin America, Asta

Revolution."

The phrase "the third world," which is now in

vogue among VERGES's group to describe the underdeveloped

nations of Africa, South America and Asia, indicates the

scope of the magazine in its new form.

T-l described this

publication

with which VERGES is

presently connected

1 as pro-

communist.

Two

members of

the Lausanne office of

the "African

Revolution* have reuainod loysl to VIRGES after

he was

replaced by HARBI.

They are TREDY GILBERT NILS
