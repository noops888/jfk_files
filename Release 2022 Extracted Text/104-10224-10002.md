1. Au Nr. David E. Murphy, GS-18, retires on
31 July 1975, he will have completed some 33 years of
Federal vervicc, 27 of which have been with the Agency.
His record hax be outstanding one fn all renpects,
Wis accomplis and the level and range of rea-
ponstbilied a exercised fully warrant the award
of the biatingulshed Intelligence Medal in recognition

thereof.

2. Mr. Murphy brought to the Agency from hin
previous milftary and civilian expertence and study,
A knowledge of the Rusatan language and of the Sovict
system. It was in the field of Soviet operations that
he rapidly made his mark, first tn Japan, and then in
Germany. Mis incisive mind, vitality, enthusfaum,
Imagination, managertal talent and keen analytical abilicy
led to carly recoynition on the part of his supertore
that Mr, Murphy was an outstanding officer with very high
potential, By 1954, he had risen to the position of
DOB, Beriin and tn 1959 became Chicf of that large and
{important base, le distinguished himself there. kn
recognition of his abtisties and accomplishments he then
rose successively fo the position of DU/EE Divinton, C/RE
Divisivn, C/SR Divistow and uiston. Hach assignment
was one of increaying responsibility and challenge in the
Qirection of efforts of the Clandestine Service and the
Agency against our hardest target The laudatory fitness
reports he received from top Agency management in these
neuignments clearly reflect the high professtonal regard
In which he was held and convey the Judgments of the major
significanee of the contributions he made to the Agency
mission in support of U.S. policy and national security.

3. After revitalizing and redirecting our Sovfet
program as C/SR and of the enlarged SB Division, Mr. Burphy .
baa appointed COS, Pacts in 1968 and served in that position :
until 1974, Wis atx years in Parts were marked by steady
progress in all areas of the miastons and objectives
Assigned to that large and complex station and by the
handling of delicate politteal and taternal eriuls situa~
tions in France effectively and to the benefit of the Agency
and the United State lia analyses of the situation in
Frauce at times of tension and crisis were particularly
remarked upon fur thetr clarity, incisiveness and value to
U.S. policy make For hin leadership of the Paris
Station, Mr. Nurphy's performance was characterized as
“outstanding” tn each of the rs of his service there.

CORFICENHIL _



4. Mr. Murphy returned from France in 1974 and was
assigned as a National intelligence ¢ rowith
Fesponsibility to the DCL in the area of Special Activities,
We has served in this assignment of high trust and rea-
ponsibility until hig retirement,

5. Mr. Murphy's long, distinguished career hao been
‘exceptional in contributing to the mission of the Agency
both operationally and substantively. His dedtcation,
drive and intelligence led to high achievement in all of
his assignments and to his being entrusted with ever-
increasing responsibilitics. It is strepgly recommended
that he be awarded the Distinguished intelligence Medal in
recognition of his outstanding service in the CLA.

TOwwaNts OF wEviEWING OFFICIAL

Under Mr. Murphy's leadership the Paris Station became very opera-
tionally oriented, concentrating on high priority targets, and much
exceptionally fine intelligence and counterintelligence production resultPd.
I have some doubt that these operational successes - as outstanding as thpy
were - really required the total number of personnel of all categories wh]
tore committed to them. Nevertheless, Mr. Murphy made Paris a shining
example for all other large stations,

Paris after a most successful six-year assinnment as
Chief of Station. He distinguished himself by having
molded this Station into a cohesive, well-di plined,
and highly productive unit. I reiterate my evaluation
of Mr. Murphy as, overall, the most cffective chief of
a major station in the European Division. Wis earlier
fitness reports and his excellent record in Paris
attest to this.

2. In the past year under Mr. Murphy's direction,
the Paris Station has continued to make significant
progress on all major fronts. As examples, I can cite
two direct Soviet recruitment attempts, an imaginative
effort to get closer to several other pri
targets, a perceptible improvement in our
relationships, a marked increase in ‘both quality and
quantity of priority economic intelligence reporting,
the acquisition of new sources to cover the French
internal scene, and a revitalization of several existing
assets into producers of valuable intelligence. Although
normally most of the credit for such achievements rests
with the individual operations officers concerned, in
Mr. Murphy's case he personally becomes involved in each

My feeling that Dave Murphy has done agloutstanding we

useful to record, however, that during the last half of this
year his Station has been deeply involved in the reporting
and analysis of some highly sensitive dovelopments on the

tion has been handled by Pave himself, and bas proven of real
significance to our highest level customers. We have brie

1, Long before
ng himself for this assignment as Chief

1968, he began prepa’

of Stati by reading files, interviewing personnel, and
discuss. cases. As a result, on arrival in Par he was

already well oriented concerning the Station's problems and
had formulated plans for revitalizing it.

2. The entire year in Paris has of course been over=
shadowed by the Vietnam Peace Conference and a large proportion
ef the Station's effort has perforce been devoted to supporting
the U.S. delegation. The Station has responded exceptionally
well to this demand though it has forced a slow-down in. normal

Station activities.

3. A number of other events have also taken place in
France or concerning France which have forced the Station
during the past nine months to perform firemen's duty the
May-June riots which extended into August, the dissolution
of the Assembly and re-election of deputies, the Czech crisis
beginning 21 August, the December monctary er. » the Near
East crisis, continued student unrest, the President's trip
and currently the problems precipitated by DeGaulle’s resig-
nation. All of these‘developments have been covered
ingly well.

4. While the exceptional events enumerated above have
forced the Station to concentrate its efforts on the immediate
ssues, Mr hy Nonetheless proceeded with the longer
Farge Koals of the Station. He has worked at improving re=

ations with the Services, personally becoming deeply

<



involved even in routine activity. Consequentl
our relations during the past nine months with the

have improved considerably. This improvement can partially
be attributed to a reawakening on the part of the
Government to the Communist and Sew Left threat (which was
brought into focus by ‘the May-June riots) but it was algo
in large:measure due to Mr. Murphy's concerted efforts to
cultivate selected officials, initiate substantive dis-
cussions and increase our own level of exchange with the
Services.

5. Operations against the Communist Party have been re=
activated with emphasis on the international aspects of the
Party, particularly support of subversion abroad. Operations
against the large Soviet and Chinese targets are beginning
to move ahead. Production-wise, the take from both

are being so energetically pursued by him. Without question,

MEMORANDUM IN LIEU OF ANNUAL FITNESS REPORT
(For the period ending 31 March 1965)

SUBJECT: Mr. David E, Murphy

1. This report is the first full year report of Mr. Murphy's
performance as Chief of the SR Division.

2. Perhaps his greatest contribution during this past year has
been the energizing of the Division's several components with a
congequent very noticeable increase in the efforts of the Clandestine
Services as a whole against our Soviet targets. Mr. Murphy's
enthusiasm and imagination have been contagious, and we are ag
a result profiting from his sound approach to the role and mission
of his Division, He has fully understood the fact that the SR Division
cannot alone discharge the responsibilities of the Clandestine Services
for intelligence and counter-intelligence activity against our Soviet
requirements, but must harness the interest and the energies of all
the area divisions, In this respect, Mr, Murphy is achieving nothing
short of remarkable success. His arrangements with DODS are also
improving the quality of that Division's work in the SR field, while
his general administration of his Division from a managerial point of
view has continued to be excellent.

3. The overall evaluation of Mr, Murphy's performance during
this past year, including his regard for cost and manpower factors,
is outstanding. It is because of the quality of thie performance that
favorable consideration has been given in principle to the gradual
investraent of an increasing portion of the manpower assets of the
Clandestine Services to his Division. His plans and his accomplish-
ments todate justify confidence that these increases are being well

invested and will provide a maximum return,

Yh OA Aen,

MEMORANDUM IN LIEU OF ANNUAL FITNESS REPORT
(Fo? the period ending 31 March 1964)

SUBJECT: Mr, David E, Murphy

: 1, Mr, Murphy relinquished hie dutics as Chicf, Eastern
Europe Division in September 1963 and took over his present respon-
sibilities ag Chief of the SR Division at that time. This report covers
the period from I April.1963 tothe present and thus includes commente
on his performance as Chief, EE Division and Chief, SR Division. :

. 2, Mr. Murphy combines an extraordinary talent for this work
“with a considerable and varied experience init, His previous report
indicated that he was turning in an outstanding performance in dealing
with the affairs of the EE Division, and he continued this level of his
performance in the first aix months covered by this report. A general
reorganization of senior officers in the Clandestine Services offered
the opportunity to put Mr, Murphy in charge of the division which he
had long aspired to direct and for which position he was eminently
qualified, both linguistically and by field experience, He ie showing
excellent results in refurbishing the Divieion and giving it new life
and impetus. His considerable energica enable him to give an out-
standing performance in managing and directing his Division's affairs
while at the same time engaging personally and most actively ina
number of very important Divisional cases, His competence includes
awareness of the need for kéeping his costa down and getting the
maximum from his manpower. He is showing imagination and
initiative and is probably the best qualified and best prepared officer
ever to head the Division.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Dircctor of Personnel

SUBJECT: Fitness Report - Mr. David E, Murphy

1, This memorandum is in licu of the Fitness Report Form
on Mr. Murphy and covers the period from 1 April 1962 through
31 March 1963, during which Mr, Murphy has served as Chicf
of the Eastern Europe Division.

2. After a long sérics of asaignments dating from April 1948
and involving duty at Tokyo, Karlaruhe ard Berlin where
he served as Chief of Base of that important inatallatica, Mr.
Murphy returned to Headquartere in August 1961 ag Deputy Chief
of the EE, Division and became Chief of that Division in June 1962.

I should like to quote from the fitness report on Mr. Murphy written
at the time he was assuming his new responvibilities 2a Chief of

EE Division: "There is every reason to believe that Mr, Murphy
will manage the EE Division in the same outstanding snanner with
which he won the ungrudging respect of the Berlin community as

the leader of American Intelligence in that area." A previous
Giese report covering his first year as Chief of Base, Berlin

is equally laudatory.

3, In hiv responsibility for streamlining and iraproving the
efiectiveness of hia Division in both its headquarters and overseas.
postures, Mr. Murphy has been energetic and imaginative. He is
‘an authority on the situation in West Germany but particularly in
Berlin and has played a highly useful role in government councils
on these problems. He has excellent working knowledge of Russian,
French and German, and hig operational experience as a result



of hie field assignments is truly extensive,

4. In conducting the affairs of nis Division daring this
Past year, Mr, Murphy haa without question borne out the
prediction that he would tura in ao cutstanding performance,
He has done this and continues to do it.

Subject, fn my opinion, one gf the most valuable, versatile und

effective offleers tn @aee@."? Me only weaknesses I have noted ‘in

Subject during the almost four years that I have been completely and

intimately familiar with hfs work on a dafly basis, are a tendency at

tines to be too impatient with other officers particularly those who

do not begin Lo measure up to his very high standards of performance » : :
and an occasional tendency Lo be somewhat. undiplomatic {n his handling

of personnel. It should be clearly pointed out, however, that neither =

of these factors are of ouffictent importance or weight to, in any

material way, decrease the effectiveness of Subject's consistently fine

pecformance: and are, in my opinion, merely the Inevitable corollary of

Subject's great drive and Intense dedication to his profession.” It

also should be pointed out that while Subject 1s an oxacting supervisor,

he 1s never unreasonable nor in any sense dictatortal, and he has demon—

strated the capacity of quickly developing and retaining the full

loyalty, cooperation and respect of the officers witi whom he works,

It 4s, I think, significant also that the respect which other offleers es
hold for Subject increases tn direct proportion to the level of pro-

fessional competence and experience which these officers attain,

In ascessing Subject's performance and capabilities, it should be
pointed out that he has been offictally recommended for promotion
from grade GS-15 to grade G3-16 and that he has been officially recom-
mended to succeed the present incumbent as Chief of Base, BOB, Purther
comments concerning Subject in this connection are contained in
EGBT-1003 duted 28 September 1953, the covering dispatch to this

MEMORANDUM FOR: Mr. David E. Murphy

SUBJECT : Service in the Clandestine Services
Records Committee

1. I wish to take this opportunity to thank you H
for your service as a member of the CS Records Committee. i
The contributions which you have made to our deliberations
have been of considerable assistance to me and te the CS
records program.

2. I believe that effective records and intormation
systems ave vital to the success of an intelligence organi-
zation and that the Records Committee plays an extremely
important role in ensuring that these systems are consonant
with more pressing and dramatic operational and policy
requirements. The advice, assistance and participation
of yourself and other senior officials have enabled us
to meet our obligations and make steady improvement in
this area. I hope I may continue to count on your sugges-
tions, initiative and advice in this area in the future.

‘TO: Mr, Willlam Harvey

APO 742, US Forces

1. As the Commanding Officer of this unit, it gives me particular
pleasure to extend my appreciation to Mr, Davidurphy and Mr.
Licbeniu for the able and extremely valuable assistance which they
rendered-to an operation of this unit on 24 May 1959.

2. Mr. Murphy, when informed on Sunday 24 May that aome
apwistance wis necded by this unit, despite the short notice, whole~
heartedly and unstintingly rendered advice and logistical support.
Because of unforeseen circumstances, certain support was lacking
for a particular operation, and Mr, Murphy immediately proferred
the necessary aid, In discussing the various phases of the operation,
Mr. Murphy wis good enough to share hia rich experience with repre-
sentatives of this unit and thus facilitate implernentation of the project.

3. Mr, Liebenau's consideration, tact and ‘coucern over the
security and success of the operation merit praise, Despite tho short
time allocated to Mr, Liebenau's phase in the operation, he consistently
deferred to the wishes of the rnembers of this unit, recognizing that
security of the operation was ptramount,

Such cooperation and spirit of friendliness aa exhibited both
by Mr. Murphy and Mr, Liebenau are a very welcome new page in the
relationship between thia unit and your organization, [tis a significant
step toward the type of coordination and cooperation which will in the

lant analysis benefit the intelligence commun:ty to-the detriiient of the
