Helms pointed out, however, that the objective of Operation MONGOOSE would have to be

determined at some point since the Cubans with whom we have to work were seeking a

sensible in Cuban terminology as meaning an action which would contribute to the liberatic

of their country, another way of saying that the United States, perhaps in conjunction

with other Latin American countries, would bail them out militarily. Helms' point

was specially echoed by Huston and Ryan.
