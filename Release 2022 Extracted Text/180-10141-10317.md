Mr. Patrick Carpentier

Office of the Legislative Coursel

Central Intelligence Agency

Washington, D. C.

stances surrounding the death of President Kennedy, the Select

In addition, please provide the Committee with access to

The CIA's written statement replying to the Committee's

request of February 21, 1978 for an explanation of the

criteria that governed the opening of a 201 file dur-

ing the years 1958-64 was not responsive to our inquiry

because the CIA's written statement did not focus on the

relevant time period. Accordingly, I am renewing our

request of February 21, 1978:

In the event that there

were no criteria governing the opening of such files

during that period, the Committee would appreciate a

written statement indicating that this was the case.

8)

CIA document #563-810 indicates that there are 37 docu-

ments that should be in Lee Harvey Oswald's 201 file

but which are missing from the file.

Furthermore, this

document also indicates that there should be a machine

listing of these documents attached as part of document

$563-810, but no such listing appears in the file. The

Select Committee on Assassinations requests that. the

CIA provide a listing of such documents as well as a

written explanation of where those documents are 10-

cated and

why they do not appear in Oswald's.201 file.

Pursuant to my letter of December 27, 1977, I would like

to note that the document referred to in this paragraph

is a classified document.

9) After having reviewed both the documents contained in

the CIA's files on Priscilla Johnson McMillan and the

materials that were independently made available to her

under the Privacy Act, it is apparent that the files

which were made available to the Committee did not in-

clude HTLINGUAL materials. As the Committee has

already requested all information contained in your

files on the individuals who are the subjects of our

requests, please review the files that you have pre-

viously made available to us for the purpose of ensur-

ing that all of the information pertaining to the

individuals involved has, in fact, been provided.

Finally, the Committee would like to interview all persons

who served as case officers in the Soviet Russian Division of

the CIA's Tokyo Station for the period 1963 through february

Tell as the Chief(s) of Station and Deputy Chief (s) Of

Station for that period. The Committee requests that the CIA :

directly.
