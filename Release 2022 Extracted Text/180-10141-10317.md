Dear Mr. Carpentier:
In connection with its investigation ihto the circum -
stances surrounding the death of President Kennedy, the Select

file xeferences pertaining to the following individuals:

DO-NOT REPRODUCE
RETURN TO CIA

In addition, please provide the Committee with access to”
the following information:

5) Any and all investigative reports prepared by E.
Howard Hunt pertaining to the John F. Kennedy assas—
sination. ‘(These reports were not necessarily pre- .,
pared during the period of Mr. Hunt's employment ‘>
with the CIA).

+7) The CIA's written statement replying to the Committee's
request of February 21, 1978 for an explanation of the
criteria that governed the opening of a 201 file dur-
ing the years 1958-64 was not responsive to our inquiry
because the CIA's written statement did not focus on the
relevant time period. Accordingly, I am renewing our
xequest of February 21, 1978. In the event that there

*X Were no criteria governing the opening of such files
during that period, the Committee would appreciate a
written statement indicating that this was the case.

8) CIA document #563-810 indicates that there are 37 docu—
ments that should be in Lee Harvey Oswald's 201 file
but which are missing from the file. Furtherntore, this
document also indicates that there’ Should be a machine _
listing of these documents attached as part of document
£563-810, but no such listing appears in the file. The
Select Committee on Assassinations requests that, the

“CIA provide a listing of such documents as well as a
written explanation of where .those documents are lo-
cated and why they do not appear in Oswald's 201 file.
Pursuant to my letter of December 27, 1977, I would like
to note that the document referred to in this Paragraph

is a classified document.

9) After having reviewed both the documents contained in’
the CIA's files on Priscilla Johnson McMillan and the
materials that were independently made available to her
under the Privacy Act, it is apparent that the files
which were made available to the Committee did not in-

+. Clude HTLINGUAL materials. ‘As the Committee has
already requested all information contained in your
files on the individuals who are the subjects of our
requests, please review the files that you have pre-
viously made available to us for the purpose of ensur-
ing that all of the information pertaining to the
individuals involved has, in fact, been provided.

Finally, the Committee would like to interview all persons
who served. as se officers in the Soviet Russian Division of
- the Cin tote Station for the period 1963 through February
1964, as ll as the Chief(s) of Station and Deputy Chief(s) of
Station for that period. The Committee requests that the CIA +
