INTERNATIONAL_CRITICISM OF CHILEAN JUNTA AND MORE RECENTLY OF

GKHERALD HAVE GEEN ORCHESTRATED TO DRAMATIC PROPORTIONS. Ha@S BELIEVES

EFFECTIVE EXPLOITATION OF GENERAL PINOCHET'S OFFER TO EXCHANGE A

NUMBER OF POLITICAL PRISONERS FOR AN EQUAL NUMBER OF SOVIET AND/OR

CUBAN PRISONERS IS OPPORTUNITY TO BLUNT HOSTILE PROPAGANDA. IF THE aay ce

USSR AND CHILE CAN BE LUMPED TOGETHER IN POPULAR MIND AS EACH HAVING

POLITICAL PRISONCRS, THE SITUATION CAN BE EXPLOITED TO DIVERT SOME OF
ATTENTION FROM JUNTA'S SUPPOSED MISDEEDS TO SOVIET HANDLING OF
POLITICAL PRISONERS. A REPORT FROM A SENSITIVE SOURCE INDICATES THAT
THE SOVIETS AND CUBANS ARE CONCERNED OVER THE PRESSURES THAT COUBLD
DEVELOP FROM THE OFFER. ¥

@- THE EXCHANGE OFFER-HAS ASPECTS THAT WOULD BE ATTRACTIVE TO
NUMEROUS GROUPS IN EUROPE BUT THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE REACTION,
PROBABLY SECAUSE OF CHILE'S EXTREME UNPOPULARITY AND THE LACK OF BOTH
A NEUTRAL. SPONSOR AND SUFFICIENT PUBLICITY. EUROPEAN COMMUNISTS

HIGHLIGHTS

Since President Allende's electoral victory in 1970, the Government
Propaganda appacatus has ingunted a coordinated campaign apain.
the opposition communications media focusing on the prestigious

El Mercurio newspaper chain and key oppoition radio: The long.
ge goal is to create conditions that will insure Go cnt

Control over the media ao that dn emasculated oppouition will operate
intuitively and through self-cenvorship within an approved framework:

The opposition radio stations bear the brunt of an array of legal
and illegal devices designed to intimidate them, These devices
include the threat of violence, favoritism in the distribution of
essential Government advertising revenue, temporary closures,
and Govérnment-fomented ttrikes,

Chile's national television -- the only country-wide channel -- has
become an important propaganda instrument for the Government,
But it is being challenged. by a Catholic University channel which io
attempting to expand its service beyond the Santiago area.

A major confrontation between the Government and the opposition,
lasting more than a.year, hae taken place at the Papelera, Chile's
only important private newsprint Producer, with the company
Supported by the opposition media stymying repeated Government
efforts to take over the firm, The paper company claims that
Government price policies have brought it close to bankruptcy,

Despite officially-sanctioned harassment, the opposition media
have continued to function, taking advantage of the fluid political
situation currently prevailing in Chile, and have become increasingly
effective in exploiting the Government's economic failures and the
Browing dissension within the ruling Marxist coalition,

Nevertheless, the opposition's economic base that sustains its media *

is being slowly undermined as the Governinent expands its conteol
over the Chilean economy, Many opposition media ore reportedly
already in difficult financial straits. The Chilean Communict Party,
Beeking to strengthen its voice in the March 1973 Congressional
elections, has already purchased five beleaguered radio stations
(one a former opposition station) in southern Chile,

CONFIDI;NTIAL

A basic organizational technique for the UI” coalition has been the
“establishment of UP committees (CUP -- Com de Unidad Popular) --
composed of newsmen who are militant membars oF pa Belor
to the Government coalition or independent nupporters of UP policie
in newspapers, radios, magazines, and in journalistic bodies, Th
CUP's have been most active at the union level: demanding exorbitant
wage increases, insisting that UP employees Le given the right to
express their opinion on editorial pages, disrupting legitimate union
meetings, forming rump unions, and leaking internal company dati to
the leftist press and to the Government,

The goal of certain Unidad Popular militants regarding freedom of
the press wae most explicitly and revealingly stated by the organizing
committee for a conference of leftist journalists which was held in
Santiago in April 1971, The committee issued the following statement
prior to the conference: Ee

...we believe that we must fight for true freedom of
the press, which will only be possible when there is
true economic independence, We maintain that Chile
will have truc freedom of the preso only when the means
of mass communication are part of the area of social
property, that is, (when they) belong to all Chileans, .
The press, radio, television, and the theater must be
tools at the service of liberation and culture of our
people and not a private business, an ideological
battering ram of the national and forcign minority

(the capitalists) as is presently the case, (under-
lining added) {

Another statement said "the mission of journalists is to support and
defend the People's Government (the UP) together with ali the workers
The declaration also underlined the support of UP newsmen for
“Viet-Nam, Cuba, and all the people that are building Socialism
and threw a bouquet at Cuba's Prensa Latina agency for its “objective”
reporting of the Chilean phenomenon, Allende himself lent legitimacy
to the mission of UP journalists in a epeech kicking off the conference
when he stated that "committed" newsmen must act ao the "vanguard"
of the revolution by “elevating the political level of the people,
Reiterating a theme expressed on many other occasions, Allende
asserted that his Government would respect freedom of info!
while at the same time he lamented his Government's "excessive
tolerance" for the opposition media.

Partial blame for leftist infiltration of Chilean stations must rest
with "bourgevis" radio owners, Long before Allende became president
the Chilean businessmen and politicians who owned radio Stations
made it a practice to hire leftist commentators because they believed
that leftists were superior professionals agd helped to increase
listenership, When the UP came to power it tapped an cxisting source
of manpower.

In addition, the Government frequently utilized existing regulations
to gain its ends. Radio concessions are granted by a Government
entity (Servicios Electricos) attached to,the Interior Mjnistry, The
same entity can cancel oF transfer such concessions. ° Regulations
promulgated during World War II state that "In case of internal
disturbance, catastrophe or war radio stations are subject to the
rules, control, and censorship that the Government may adopt,"
Under this type of emergency regulation, all radio stations were
placed under an obligatory Government network -- not an unusual
Practice for the Allende Government -- when a modified martial
law wae decreed in 21 of Chile's 25 provinces during. the October-

The Government moved quickly after the 1970 procidential

June 1971 for broadcasting an alleged "alarmist" report during the
State of Emergency decreed after the asaasaination of Peres Zaujovic,
a former interior minister in the Frei Government. At the same
time a UP station, Port. lea, received nothing more than an admoni-

In radio as in the press the Government has used CUP
committees to formulate exaggerated waye demania, to
strikes, and to form rump unions, CUP unions at Radio }
for example, forced the owner to sell out to a couperali
by employees when wave demands could not be met, The
station aubsequently was purchased by the Radical Party -- a
member of the UP coalition.

The principal Governinent weapon, however, is ito control
over public service advertizing, which traditionally has provided
the bulk of revenues for Chilean radio stations, Tho Government
hae dangled the prospect of udvertisernents in return for favorable
news treatment, but the bait hao not been picked up by the major
opposition radios which recognize that their independence is at
stake, The economic squeeze makes. the future of Chilean
independent radios appear bleak.

c.

Since its inception in Chile in 1942, television has made great
aridm, but the medium etill lags behind radio, ially_in the
provinces where technical conditions for viewing arc poor, Accord-
ing to the best catimates available, there are 350, 000 sets in
Santiago and a total of 500, 000 sets in the country, Chile is served
by the following television channels: 1) A national network with
some 21 outlets throughout the country; 2) the Catholic University
channel in Santiago; 3) a separate Catholic University channel in
Valparafso; and 4) the University of Chilg channel in Santiago,

The Government clearly recognizes television's importance as
a propaganda vehicle, and under the direction of an Allende
confidante, newsman Augusto Olivares (Socialist and a suspected,
member of the ultra-left MIR «+ Movement of the Revolutionary
Left), it hae transformed Chile's only nationwide television channel
into an outright political instrument of the Government coalition,
Slanted commentaries favoring UP policies, character assassinations
intended to smear political and class opponents, anda steady drum-~
fire of Socialist propaganda in news and cultural programming
became standard fare. :

At the same time network Authorities made ult under a

A popular political chat show "A Trea Bandas," in which opposi-
tion reprenentatives freely debated Up representatives (the onty such

Quimantu quickly began turning out magazines, comic books,

were designed for mass consumption and aimed at adults with
low cultural levels, while others like Ramona were aimed at the

The Government's film production company, Chile Films, became
the UP'a principal propaganda arm in the film field. Rival Chilean
private producers went out of business, squeezed by rising production
coete and discriminatory tax and exchange rate treatment that denied
“them needed equipment and spare parts from abroad. Chile Films
signed a comprehensive exchange accord in March 1971 with the Cuban
Cinematographic Institute (ICAIC) (See Section V. C. Exchange of
Persons, Visitors, and Exchance Agreements),

Chile Films aleo initiated agreements with the experimental film
inbtitute (leitist) at the University of Chile, the film institute at the
Communist-dominated State Technical University (UTE), the Governs
ment information office, the film department of the Communist-
dominated CUT (Central Unica de Trajabadores -- the major labor
organization), the national television network, and the University of
Chile television station. The stated purpose of the accords was to
“develop the new Chilean film industry,

Its products are intended to glorify the roles of workers, peasants,
and students in the march to Chitean-style Socialism, romanticize the
proletarian role of the Chile2x Communist and Socialist Parties, and
attack the "bourgeoisie" and ir “imperialist” allies, Despite an
intense publicity buildup, hawever, few films actually appeared in
the 1970-72 period. Most of the films that were produced appeared to
be pieced together from newsreel film taken dering the Allende :

‘bya lopsided majority vote of 135-35. Hu received
the support of the centrist Christan Democratic
Party (PDC) in the run-off in return for his agree-
ment tothe adoption of a Constitutional Statute of
Ocmocraic Guarantees protecting freedoms of ex.
pression, education and religion, and guarantecing
the independence of the military from political con.
trol. The text of the statute, which was added to
the Chiléan Constitution shortly after Aliende’s elec-
tion, reflected the fears of non-Marxlst groups that
the new Marxist President would use the consider-
able power of the Chilean executive to undercut and
eventually destroy all opposition ta a Marxist take-
over.

Political and Economic Strategy

When he took office, Allende promised that he
would follow a “second model” of Marxism—the
via’ Chilena to socialism, “with meat pics and red
wine." To prove that this model was “anticipated
by the classics of Marxism," he quoted from
Friedrich Engeis on the possibility of

‘majority of the nation behind them,*

Yet it was precisely the.question cf majority sup-
Port that was Allende’s central problem in his de-
sign to carry out a peaceful transition to "socialism
with democracy, pluralism and liberty.” The parties
in his coalition -were in a distinct minority in the
Congress, and although there was no doubt about the
legitimacy of his election by that body, his victory

to prevent it from voting for Allende’ in the run-off.

POC, but if an accord had been reached with the

a majority In the Congress for at least part of his
program,

Flushed with victory and unwilling to come to
terms with the party which he had termed “the new
‘| face of reaction” during the campaign, Allende chose
an alternative strategy. The next congressional elec-
tions were not scheduled to take place until March
1973, but the Chilean Constitution provided that in
the event of a conflict, with the Congress over the
text of a constitutional amendment, the President
could call a national picbiscite. The strategic course.
adopted by Allende was to attempt to expand popu-
lar support for his coalition’ and then propose a
constitutional amendment which, in accordance with
the. Popular Unity electoral program, would replace

Coalition by an appeal to the material interests and
the class consciousness of the lower classes. It was
the interaction of the various elements of this politi-
cal and economic strategy that finally produced the
breakdown of Chilean constitutionalism and the
intervention of the armed forces that the extreme left
of the Allende coalition had been predicting all along.

Initial Success :

—_—
At the outset, the new economic policy was
astoundingly successful, although it had within it
the seeds of future disaster. Income redistribution
stimulated demand, while price controls and an arti-
ficially low exchange rate kept prices down, AS a
Consequence, a mini-boom ensued. By March 1971.
the Sociedad de Fomente Fabril (Asscciation for the
Development of Manufacturing), representing
Chilean business and industry, admitted that produe-
tion had Increased by 6.3 percent over the figure
“{ ot 12 months before, and by May that figure had
feached 13.5 percent. The Institute of Eccnomics
Of the University of Chile later reported that unem.
Bloyment in the Santiago area dropped from 8,3
fercent in December 1970. to 5.2 percent in June
1971 and declined further to an unusually low 3.8
Percent by the end of the year. The Consumer Price
Index stopped climbing entirely in December 1970
and had only increased by 6 percent by the time
of the municipat elections of April'1971—its lowest
tise in many years, At the same time, salaries and
wages increased by 27 percent in real terms,

This wave of economic prosperity—combined
with the absence of the political repression that

Political Polarization

The hardening of the Christian Democratic posi-
tion began in mid-1971. it was accelerated in June
by the assassination of the former Christian Demo-
cratic Interior Minister, Edmundo Perez Zujovic, by
extremists, at least one of whom had been released
from prison by Allende upon his accession to power.
A month later in a by-election in Valparalso, the
victorious Christian Democratic candidate received
the support of the Right. The tacit alliance with the
Right led to the secession from the POC of eight
deputies and a number of other party leaders to form
the pro-Allende liquiercta Cristiana (Christian Let),
This was counterbaianced however, by a split in the

dustrial growth had reached 8.3 percent, agrarian
production (based on plantings before Alisne’s
accession to power) had increased by 5.3 percent,
and unemployment had dropped to record cvs. The
Communist Party in.a report to a Popular Unity
“conclave” in early 1972 warned that “very stscng
Inflationary pressures could make our situation
acute,” but the government tcok ito action to coat
with the problem. The continuing -optimism of gov-
ernment policymakers at this time was expressed
at a Round Table in Santiago sponsored by the Uni-
versity of Sussex.and the Chilean Planning Otice in
March 1972. In the course of discussion Racs:miro
Tomic, the defeated Christian Democratic presizen-
tial candidate, asserted that the Allende yovernment
had committed a “fatal potitical error” in failing to
establish an “institutional majority” in the Congress
through a “far-reaching agreement between soci2"'Sts
inspired by Christianity and those inspires by
Marxism—that is, between the Christian Democrats

and Poputar Unity—in the period following the 1970
presidential election.” Altende's representatives com

fidently replied that “w siuat heightening of
the political consciareness of tne proletariat, there
seemed to be no obstucts in the internat logic of
the Chilean bourgeois state to prevent the workers’
winning sulficicat strength to gain control of the
logistatunyas welt as the executive.” *

On the political front, there were individuals and,

movement toward polurization, which they corcectly

broke down when the time limit set by the Christian
Dentacrats expired and the POC leadership refused

The two sels of negotiations seem to have col-

lapsed for related reasons. In Aprit the left wing of
the Popular Unity coatition was unwilling to accept
a compromise which would slow down or stop the
forward movement of the government nationalization

August 17 in protest against his lack of suffi
power to sxttle the strixa, Allende compelled him
to add that his; departure from the cabinet “im.
plicitly" carried with it his retirement as Air Force
Commander, This was correctly seen as an Allende
tactic to remove an officer oppozed to him, and it
met serious resistance from within the Air Force,
provoking a series of actions which ultimately led
directly to the September 11 coup.

On August 20, top Air Force officers met to'decide
whether to resist Aliende’s action. ‘By evening, Ruiz’
had persuaded them to accept it on the condition
that Allende appoint the second-ranking officer,
General Gustavo Leigh, as Air Force Commander and
name another Air Force general to the cabinet (so
that Allende could not repeat the same maneuver
with Leigh). The next night the wives of high-ranking
military officers, including: those of six generals,,
gathered in frort of Generat Prats’ house to present
a letter asking for his resignation, W/hen the cemon-
ttfifion was broken up by police tear gas, it pro-
voked such dissension in the armed forces that'on
the following day General Prats decided to resign
both as Defense Minister and Army Commander. He
was joined by two other generals who, with Prats,
had led the mititary forces that had quelied the
tank-regiment revolt in June. Z

The resignation of what appeared to be the last
defenders of Allende in the army now meant that
all three services were opposed to the President. It
coincided with the adoption on the same day of a
“sense of the house" (acuerdo) resolution by the
Chamber of Deputies directed at the President and
the military ministers, drawing their attention to
“the serious breakdown of the constitutional and
lepal order." * The resolution criticized the Allende
fovernment for repeatedly bypassing the legislature
through the use of legal loopholes and for refusing
to promulgate the constitutional reforms voted by
the Congress. It accused Allende of ignoring judicial
orders, encouraging iticgal seizure of property, perse-
cuting opposition labor groups, and supporting
illegal paramilitary organizations. tn conclusion, it
stated that the listed actions constituted a “serious
breakdown of the constitutional and legal order of
the Republic" and urged the military ministers to
“put an end to the ‘de facto situations listed above
which violate the Constitution and the law" or be

Allende in’ Retrospect
oS
Specie aspects of the Ctulean system also mase

tha Allende experiment a particularly difficult one.

He was able to come to power in the first place

because of Chile’s deeply-rooted commitment to the

democratic system and because the Marxist parties

were able to mobilize’a part of the proletariat and

the peasantry, and he had at his disposal many

instruments tor state control of-the economy which

had been developed by previous administrations

since the -1930's. However, he: wos required to

operate within an institutional 'system whicn included

frequent ‘and staggered elections, proportional rep-

fescntation, and a multiparty system which made

majority rule very difficult-and often gave veto pow-

ers to the-extremes of Right.and Left. The economy

had been characterized for nearly a century by 2

chronic tendency to inflation, and successive govern-

ments had consistently ignored agriculture in the

Interest of securing urban electoral support. The

most important systemic constraint of all, of course,
was the existence of a professionalized and insti-
tutionally-loyal military which was unresponsive to
the Ideological blandishments of the Left."*

The immediate causes of the military intervention
are apparent from the preceding account. In the last
part of 1972, the military were drawn into Chilean
politics by both sides and became as polarized as
the rest of Chilean socicty—with the overwhelming,
majority joining the opposition to Allende. The con-
flict over education in March-April 1973 height:
ened that polarization just at the time the military
were‘atiempting to extricate themselves from politi-
cal Involvement. Then’ the expansion of arms
searches in mid-1973 revealed the extent to which
Chile was becoming an armed camp on the verge
‘of civil war. Finally, the efforts to subvert the existing
military hierarchy by 9 combination of leftist activ-
ity among entisted men and presidential maneuver-

ing with promotions and retirements provided the
classis scenario for a coup d'état:

his faith in a democratic, pluralist and libertarian
transition. to socialism, many of his Marxist-sup-
porters spoke and acted.on the basis of a belief In
ne inevitability of armed confrontation. With his
knowledge, they armed themselves and—-what Was
worse—talked incessantly about revolution. The fe.
peated Statements cf Régis Debray and ol thers that

combined with efforts to reorganize education atong
ideological lines, to subvert military discipline, and
to rearrange the hierarchy of command, It [5 not
altogether surprising that the military finally took
action.

certainly credit him with a sincere effort to ralse
the living-standards of low-incoma groups and to
involve them actively In the determination of thelr
‘own future. It would likewise stress the continued
existence of freedom of expression for all points of
view in Chile right up to the coup, A more negative
assessment would ask whether the lowlncome
groups in Chile genuinely benefited from an eco-
nomic policy which after the first halt of 1972 pro-
duced hyperinflation, a continuous drop in agrl-
¢uttural and industrial production, and a reduction
in the real value of wages and salaries. Even more

NETHERLANDS

CHILEAN REFUGEES IN NETHERLANDS POINTED OUT AS FUGITIVES

L43itorial by N. van een Reformatorisch Dagblad,

Dutch, 19 April 1974, p

The Chilean refugees in the Netherlands seem to be
having adjustment problems. These rather Prolonged symptoms.
geem to be caused among other things by the fact that they
still find it hard to accept that the socialist dream of
their Karxist president. is definitely over and that their
country is now being ruled ty a small group of reactionaries
who are trying to keep the people under control through
terrorism, repression, and torture. Such problens will take
you quite a ways in the Netherlands and those idealists were
quick to take advantage of it.

Welfare

what is the situation? Most of the approximately
250 refugees with a high school or university education do
not. work. About half of them have been housed at the "Huis
ter Schie” in Overschie, where they enjoy the sunshine on
the terrace or play volleyball in the yard. Board and
lodging are free and at the end of the week they pick up
another 25 guilders pocket money. In addition they receive
free language instruction, commuter tickets for the bus, and
compensation for each trip they have to take.

Do you get the idea that they are better off than
many. old people in the hetherlands? You are probably right,
because the Chilean exiles do not have to live on welfares
they are being paid from the frozen funds which had been
allocated for development aid to their fatherland, Chile.
So you can see how well our tax money is being spent.


Considering that this small proup.of pampered exiles
is preaching revolution even here and with a full stomach,
it may be useful to point out a few facts. These are facts
which are well known in the Ministry in The Hague but for
some reason never made it to the Netherlands press.

Facts

The great majority of the refugees are not even
Chilean nationals. They are natives of Bolivia, Brazil, and
Uruguay. ‘They came to Chile as a result of illeval and
revolutionary. activities in which they had been involved in
these South and Middle American countries, the ultimate
consequences of which they did not wish to suffer.

They felt at home in Allende's Chile because Allende
showed sympathy for their situation. His first action aa
president, after his inauguration in November 1970, was to
declare amnesty for all those who “were members of terrorist
underground organizations," those who during the last months
of. his predecessor's regime had been charged with bank
robbery, the armed robbery of self-service stores, the theft
of weapons from military arsenals, kidnapping, and attempted

murder.

i The fact that some of those revolutionaries received
Chilean diplomatic status was due to Allende's policy of
granting residence permits to this type of revolutionaries.
These refugees with a high school or higher level education
seemed to have no adjustment problema in Chile. As a result
they soon found their way to important key positions in the
eovernment. i

The fugitives didn't suffer any sleepless nights in
Chile either, because they felt protected by a militant
Karxist army, armed to the teeth. Some 10,000 revolutonaries,
from all points of the compass, were at their disposal.

Definition ieee

In the Berner Tageblatt, a Swiss newspaper which
is known for not exaggerating, Dr. Mario Puelma, from the
University of Freiburg,’ wrote the following: "The concept

of political refugee is only of limited value when applied
to Chile. Whatever one's attitude toward the military junta


may be, one thing is certains the Chilean refugecs wore not
pursued only because of thelr ideology, their status, or
their origin. This is the traditional, humanitarian defini=
tion for a refuree. For the mont part they are people who,
in their own country, could be legally charged with crimes
which are punishable under any Judicial system. i

These refugees carried out activities tn Chile which
were againut the constitution. As a matter of fact, they are
specialists in violence. This in why they sought asylum in
the foreign embassies in Santiago and why there are so many
foreigners among them."
