Action:

Information

1. COS not with. SKEWER-l In Ponce, P. R: on 28 December 1963.

?.

During general conversation, SKEWER-l said he was consider-

1B8

the construction of two sizeabla plants (cement and glass.) in

the

Dominican Republic as a means of augmenting official assistance

through private enterprise and asked COS's opinion of the venture.

COS responded that this was personal decision for SKEWER-l to make.

3. SKEWER-I said he felt that it was imperative for all free

nations of the Hemisphere to do all in their power to help the

Dominican Republic become a true democracy and to deny it to the

Communists.

In this vitäl task, he added, private capital must

also parilcipate, actively.

This personal

conviction, he said, 18

what has prompted him to coulder building the cement and glass

plants.

SKEWER-1 sald that he belleyed the present GODR was

democratically-oriented and would do a good job in the interval

"between the Junta reign and elections for a successor government.

He also praised the selection vI Donald REID Cabral to succeed
