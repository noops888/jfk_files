2022 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992

SECRET.

11/94

C/HRG

Subject: Agee Interview

Attached is a memo prepared by Charles Dollar recording his

actions on the Agee Interview.

At that time, the DO

concurred with John Carver in

having NARA take deletions for

the agency. Unfortunately, Dollar went beyond the agreement

and made changes without notifying the Agency.

Tilley has

pulled the open copy off the shelf for the present.

the Do is reconsidering the earlier position and may propose

-hat we take the past Agency position of neither confirming

or denying comments by Agee.

The "Dollar Redacted" copy at

NARA would be replaced by a full text copy.

This raises several questions:

1. How to acknowledge review of the document without giving

official status to the document? Our "no objection to

release" stamp on

a document is generally considered an

"official release" by the Agency.

2. Is there a problem if we do not indicate that we have

seen the document?

3. How do we treat documents of similar nature? Attached is

narticle by Wilcott which contains information on th

Tokyo Stations To take any deletions would confirm wha

he is saying.

(I am sure that the Lesar types have a

copy of the article.)

4. There are numerous letters, interviews, testimony, etc.,

of private citizens (many former agency employees, but

not all) in the HSCA referred material. Until now we

have been taking deletions when requested by DO. Is

there a problem with picking and choosing those

we take

deletions in and those we ignore?

One approach to the problem would be to review and redact as

appropriate only official documents such as testimony and

depositions.

Letters, articles, interviews, etc., by

private citizens would be release

in full with no Agency

comment or with a different stamp.

I have not discussed the above issues with the Do. Hal,

Chuck and I have had several discussions and agree that the

problem is broader than the Agee interview and that our

current guidelines are not adequate.

Let me know when you have time to discuss.
