We Discover Lee OSWALD in Mexico City

CIA did produce one very significant piece of information on Lee
OSWALD before he shot President Kennedy. On 1 October 1963, our Mexico
City Station intercepted a telephone call Lee OSWALD made froa someplace
in Mexico City to the Soviet Embassy there, using his own name. Speaking
broken Russian and using bis ‘true nae, OSWALD was talking to the Eubassy

guard, OBYEDKOY, who often answers the phone. OSWALD said he haa visited

-the Eubassy the previous Saturday (28 eptember 1963) and spoken to a

consul. whose name he had forgotten, and who haa promised to send a tele-
gram for him to Washington. Be vented to know 4f there vere “anything

small staff in Hexico City. By 9 October, the OSWALD telephone converaa-
tion of 1 October had been transcribed and a summery of it cabled to
Washington. ‘The name Lee CSHALD meant nothing special to cur Mexico
City Station, but in their report they dia judge him to be on American
nale.

‘The cabled report was received in Washington on 9 October and checked
in our files, where it was innediately noted that the Lee OSWALD phoning
‘the Soviet Rubassy in Hexico City was probably the Lee OSWALD vho had
defected to the Soviet Unton in 1959 and returned to the USA in 1962. On
10 October 1963, the day after the report from Mexico City, CIA Headquartera
sent out a cabled report sbout Lee OSWALD's phone call to the Soviet
Eubessys the report vent to the FBI, the Departuent of State (because
OSKALD was a US citizen), and to the avy Departuent (because he vas a

former Marine.) ‘The cabled report to these agencies highlighted the

SEGEET ,


13-00000

LikLiheod that the Lee OSWALD mentioned was probably the former defector.
A copy of this same cable was deliverea by hand to the Imaigration and
Naturalization Service, with which we have no cable Link. ‘The sme day
@ long cable vent out to Haxico City informing our Station of the back~
ground of defector Lee OSWALD and asking for more information. Our Statioa
vas instructed to pass its information on the phone call to the Mexico
City offices of the FBI, the Embassy, the Raval Attache, and the Imigra-
apse Service. ‘This was done.

In ite original report of 9 October, Mexico City hed aaid it had a
photograph of an apparent Anericen male leaving the Soviet Eubassy on
1 October 1963, the day OSWALD phone there. A very sensitive operation
in Mexico City provides us with secretly taken photographs of many but not
all visitors to the Soviet Eubasay there, taken with telezhoto lenses.
Accordingly, ve cabled the avy Department on 24 October 1963 asking for
& photograph of Lee OSWALD from his Varine Corpe days so we could conpere

photos. We hed not received this photograph by 22 Noventer 1963, but in

any event, it turned out that the man photosraphed outside the Soviet



13-00000

Rubassy was not OSWALD anyway. As chance would have it, none of our

several photo obsemation points in Mexico City had ever taken, en identi-
figble picture of Lee OSWALD.

Our Mexico City Station very often produces information Like this
on US citizens contacting Soviet bloc eubassies in Mexico City. Frequently
the information we get 1s extremely incriminating, and on one or two
Occasions we have even been able to apprehend and return to the ISA
Averican military personnel who are attempting to defect. In all such
cases, our Headquarters éesk requests and obtains the special permission of
the Deputy Director for Plans to pass the derogatory information on a US
“eltizen to other yovernnent agencies. Deroyatory information on Americans
4s not treated routinelys in each case the DDF or his Assistant personally
scrutinize the information, make sure it is credible, en@ decide whether ana
to whom it will be passed. Only in absolute emergencies is the Hexico City

Btation authorized to pass such infornation directly to the FBI office in

the U.S, Bubassy.

At this writing (13 Decenber 1963) ve ¢o not know what action the FBI


13-00000

and other agencies may have taken based on our report. We surmise that the
FOI may have mage local checks throush Mexican authorities to see if

Lee OSWALD was actually in Mexico City on 1 October. Indeed, later in-
Vestisatien has confirmed all the details of his trip, where he stayed,
end what he did. To avoid crossing lines with the FAI, our Mexico Station
unilertook no local investigation of its own. A® ve now know, OSWALD left

Mexico on 3 Octeber and was no loner there when our report vas put out.

on at once ty the Chief CI, tr. Angleton, to bir. Birch O'Neal of his
Special Investigations Unit. Drs. Betty Egeter of this Unit imediately
recognised the name of Lee CSKALD and vent for bis file. At the sane?
tine, Kes. Bastos of the Mexico Desk, who had written our firat feport on
CEWALD on 10 October recognized the name from radio reports and vent
after the same file. Mr. Reichardt, Mexico Desk Chief, who vas home on
leave, heard the news and phoned in a reainder that we bad something on
OSWALD. While we vere preparing a cable to Mexico City asking then for
more information on OSWALD, Vexico City tteelf heard OSYALD's name oa the
Voice of Asrtes tvadcast end cabled to ne a resinder of the information
the Station had sent in on hin.

For the next week, a dozen people in the Agency vere continnously
engaged in handling incoming neseasss on the case, writing reports to be

file on OSWALD and pass them to us, and the FBI gave us a copy of the
Soviet Consular file on OSWALD which had been publicly given by the Soviet
Ambassador to the Secretary of State. On Friday 6 December 1963, Deputy
Attorney General Xatzenbach invited us to review the FBI's couprehensive
report on the case to make sure our sources vere not jeopardized and that
our information was correctly quoted. We found the report highly
interesting and no threat to cur security, as long as it vas read only
by the authérized investigative bodies.

After the first few days, the CiA investigation of the case was

bandled at Headquarters by a small staff usually charged with Anvestization

and analysis of the most important security cases, and by a few officers

end analysts of our Western Hesisphere Division.

Silvia's husband, Horacio DURAN Havesro, an industrial destcer,

to find out whether be hada Soviet visn. Horacio DURAM recalled his wife
had sata OSHALD became anery and she had to call out the Cuben Consul,

Silvia DURAN told the same story. She was a leftist eympathizer with

vanted e Cuban visa but could not get one without the assurance of a Soviet

about this as late as 9 November 1963.

Silvia DURAN vas arrested again on 27 Yovesber and bold until 29 :

Well-placed sources within the Cuban Enbassy in Mexico City stated
that when Silvia DURAN vas released froa police arrest the first tim on
25 Fovesber, she vas quite pleased with herself. She told ber colleazues
the sane story est out above, adding only that the Mexican police had

parts of the evidence indicate to the contrary. Silvia DURAN and the

13-00000

Soviet Consular ctriainis epae ef hin on a nen vith “no friends in Cubs"
on the ove hand, and as a man not “known” in the Soviet Bzbassy, on the
other. ‘The very openness of his visita and the phone calls speak against any
secret role. His trip to Hexico was not Steel? » secret acts be travpled
under his real name or 4 close variant of it, lived openly 4a Mexican
hotels, and corresponded with the Soviets through the open mailf about

it waea be got back to the US. Hie trip to Mexico was apparently nade
necessary because it vas the nearest Cuban diplomatic installation where

be conla apply for a visa.

A perplexing aspect of OSWALD's trafficking with the Cubans and
Soviets in Mexico City te his assertion in his call of 29 September that he
ata not know his edéress when he was at the Soviet Consulate and cane to
the Cuban Consulate beceuse they bad ite Tt 1e hard to explain just viet

his new address in Texas, whatever 1t was, and may not have been able to



13-00000

lay hands on it whea he was in the Soviet Consulate that day. Perhaps
he had earlier given the address to Silvia DURAM and wanted to lock it
up on her card.

A particularly siuteter aspect of CSHALD'® deelings vith the Soviets
in Hexteo City arises from the likithood that he net vith Soviet Consul
Yelerty Vladimirovich KOSTIXOY, In his 1 Octoter phone call to the
Soviet Eubassy, the guard OBYEDADY suggests that the Consul OSWALD baa
talked to vas KOSTIMOY if he was dark, OSWALD seems to agree with this,
but the identification 1s very casuel. In his 9 Noveaber letter to the
Soviet Consulate in Washington, OSWALD gives the nane of the man he‘ dealt
with aa "KOSTIN,” but there is no person of that exact naze in the Soviet
Embassy In Mexico City. KOSTINOY fo accredited as a Consular Attache and
does actually do lot of consular vork, but ke is believed to be a
Soviet KGB officer, and it is believed that be works for Departnent 13 of
the KGB, the Deyartnent charged with sabotage and assassinations. The

‘
t

suspicion that KOSTIXOY is a KGB officer arose froa hia work habits, and

' ‘

his association with other KGB officers. It was hardened when it vas



13-00000

found that he handled a Seviet agent vbo vas trained to do sabotage

work and that he turned this agent over to another XCB officer who is

definitely known to werk for the 13th Department. It is generally true
tn RGB vork that sabotage agents are handled ouly by 1S"Department ,
officers.

Exbassy guard Ivan Ivanovich OBYEDKOY is hiuself believed to be a
KGB man from previous assignments as a bodyguard and sureillant. But
unless some direct evidence of Soviet complicity is discovered, it is
most likely that OSWALD's dealing with KOB men OBYRDKOY and KOSTIKOY vas
nething nore than a grim coincidence, a coincidence due in part to the
Soviet habit of placing intelligence men in the Eubassies in positions
where they receive a larga portion of the visitors and phone calls. All
of the five consular officers in the Soviet Enbassy are known or suspected |
intelligence officers. Certainly if OSWALD had been a Soviet ayent in
training for an assassination assigment or even for sabotage work, the

. ‘
Fe ens

the Soviet Eubassy in Mexico after he tried it a couple of tines. Our


13-00000

experience in Mexico, stuiying the Soviet intelligance service at close
range, indicates that they do make some mistskes and are scsetimes insecure

in their methoas, but that they do not persist in such glaring errors.

Sone insight on the Cuban attitude tovard the arrest of Silvie DUR
pe
and the involvesent of the Cuban Consulate in the OSWALD case can be
goined from two intercepted phone calle made between Cuban President
Osvaldo DORFICOS and Cuban Anbassador to Mexico Joaquin GRRNANDEZ Armas on
26 ‘November 1963, the day after Silvin DURAN was released fron her first
arrest. At 09:10 AM that morning, President DORTICOS phoned the Anbassedor
froa Havana and asked him several questions about a report which the
Anbasnador had cent in on the arrest of Silvia DURA and the Lee OSWALD
case. ‘Tse vhole conversation is consistent with the theory that OBWALD
Berely vanted a visa. ‘The Anbessador did mention the altercation vhich
OSWALD bad with Consul AZCUS, end he says that Mextoen police bratsed

‘ t
of their questions. Tkey haa asked her if she haa been intimate with

OSWALD end she had denied it. President DORTICCS twice asked Ambassador


13-00000

TBRNANDRZ whether the Mexican police haa asked Silvia DURAN questions
about “noney,” snd the President apparently wanted to know whether the

Mexicans thought the Cubans had paid OSWALD money. IBRHABDRZ insisted

the Mexicans’ had not offered Stivia DURAM money, and DORTICOS gave p .
up trying to yut across bis paint. President DORTIOGS instructed
ERRYANDRZ to keep on questioning Silvia DURAN and to phone him beck.

At 7:39 PM that evening Aubessador HERNANDEZ aia call Presizent
DORTICOS back, saying be had questioned "that person” esain and she has
nothing nev to add, President DORTICGS returns to the issue of whether
“they hea threatened ber so that she vould make a statement that tho
Consulate had given money to the nantt"that Anericon.” But Aubassador
HBROANDRZ pereiste in misunderstanding DORTICOS, answes in the negative,
and says: "Absolutely nothing vas given to her." DORTICOS seeus to give
up, and the conversation dies out after a fev more general remarks.

We do not know for sure whnt made President DORTICOS press for inforsa-

Ue ' "a
tion about Cuban money passed to OSWALD, but rumors vere current in Mexico

end even, we understand, in the USA, that OSWALD bad returned from Mexico

City with about $5,000. Perhaps DORTICOS vas trying to learn whether
the Mexican police believed that the Cubans had financea OSWALD. In any
event, the Cuban Goverment sent the Mexicans a stiff note of protest

over the arrest and detention of Silvia DURAN, but the Mexicans

cs

rejected the note.
