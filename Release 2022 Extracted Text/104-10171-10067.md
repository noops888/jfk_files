SUBICT: Thlk vy Frnesto Betaaccurt at the Cooperative Forus.

1, This fo a report fro semory of the highlights of the talk givea
by Dr. Exncoto Betancourt, Wecnecday nirht, 26 Ceptender 1562, end of the
question and answer period folloviug it, at the Cooperative Fersa to

Washington, D.C

2. Dr. Betancourt wns announced ns the political advieer of
Libertajor de Cuba, “an orgnntzation af youog Cutan ailitnry leace
exile.” Currently hie full tine cecupation was etated as that cf a
coordinator in the Departoent of Ecoaonic Affairs of the Organisation of
Acarican States (SAS). In the early days of tho Castro regine be had beeo
&n enthusinstic “Fidelista” and had served as Director of tlie Central Bank
of Cubs (pre Che Guevarra) and ‘one of Castro's firat representatives
in the U. 8, Iie soon became disenchanted, defected and becane a leader

in the anti-Castro movenent.

3. Based on mental notes of Betancourt's speech (about 40 nioutes)
end of his cnswers given to questions from the audience (a typical,
dfLatinguished cross-section gro found at the Forum), the folloving
appenred to be the aoct significant statenentas

a. There are no “easy” ansvers to the Cubsn problen

which has becone iocreastagly complex.

d. ‘The singly cost isportant Soviet objective in
“taking over” Cuba 13 to-diceredit the U. 8.
by alternately deaonstrating ite “woakness”
and ite “wickedness.” By showing that the U.8,
is willicg to. recein supine eves in the face of a
nilitary-aid “preaecce” in Cuba, the Soviets
believe they can score a psychological victory which
will iopress other Latin American countries and
perhaps other developing areas in which the U. 8
has an ioterect. -Sinulteneously the Conmniats
continue to dcptet the. "gringves” as cress,
money-seeking imperialists who vant to “do in*
poor little Cute. This creation of an unfavorable
imaga of. the U. 8, is far more important to the
Krenlin than any other reason for their cow large
Cuban ‘effort.’ ‘Dveo the possible uce of Cuba as
@ aissile base is of secondary importance.

¢. As for making Cuba a Communist “showcase”
Betancourt believes the Soviets have no such
hope or eveo intention. They do however intcnd
to use Cuba as the CP “headquarters” for Lotin
HE Anerica and have {n fact been dofog so for sou
tine. E

a. ‘The attecpted invasion vae a dicaster all arouud -
militarily, politicelly and ideologically. Anons
other causes. of thie failure wns CIA's “kidnapping”
of the Revolutionsry Council so that avy effective
anti-Castro leadership vas rendered poverless.



2 Octuter 1,62

Talx by Exnosto Betancourt at the Cooperative Forua.

@. ‘She “burcling” of the favvzton vas-to part due to
the “csmucications void" that existed so far as
gettin; enti-Castro informtion through to the
Cuban pecple. In the peantime Castro had full
cootrel over his intercal communications and
aaterated” the air vaves vith pro-resine
propaganda coucerning the Lovasioa.

f. Castro 4s still the real “boss” in Cuba oven
though be 1s ourrounded by Communiste and te
cenérally obedient to Moscow's orders. The
Krealin has oct pushed him too far.- ta fact
they have in.sone inatances pulled hin back

- for they feel thnt he has a teadescy to be
reckless. For instance, the Soviets did not
really vant hin to break with the U. 8. and
would have vanted hin to be a clever “Marxist”
tactician, The Krenlin fe emart enough to
realize, hovever, that if Castro were elicinated
bia eotire resize would collapse, 60 vhilo
dictating to hin-in certain respects, they also

ee have to give hin leeway. In other words the

Comanists are “using” Castro but at the sare
tine are being used by him for the echieverent

of his ova ego-pover objectives.

g+ Econoate conditions in Cuba are really very bad,
In the general disérray of the Cuten. ecoaoay,
acriculture is faring vorst cf all. For the
first tine in Cuban history, food te betog
soverely rationed. Also for the first time
the eusar crop has not been planted this year,
due to the ceneral disorder and the tusbility
to provite inceatives for the sugar plaatation
peons. Soviet economic aid is insufficent thus
far to have ony visible effect in lifting the
economy. The Soviets are apparently giving
uch vore eilitary than econonic aid.

hh. Betancourt 1a opposed to military intervention
by U. S. on general principles but feels that
if-the U, 8. did decide to Satervene. it vould
be far more Justified in the eyes cf Latin-
Anerica than vould have been the case before
the Soviets decided to intervene militarily.

1, One af the test propaganda targets froa the U.S.
point af view 1s the Castro militia. According
to Betaccourt the militianen are “restive” about
the Coamaist doctnation of Cuba. A large number
of these nen vere ardeut rebels but not Communiste.
They fought with Castro against the Batista dictator-
ship. but vot in order to establish a Coxunist
regise, nor even to make Cuta a “socialist” state.

Talx by Exnesto Betancourt at the Cooperative Forum,

These aflitianen vould be mich sore reoponsive
to Us 8. apponle if they did not feel that to
the event of anti-Castro take crer they vould be
Uquidated. They feel that the Us 3, and rebel
Propaganda has depicted thea all as aajor
enenies and inmedinte tarsets for destruction.
Betencourt believes ve should proceed to correct.
this propaganda error at ouce.

ss Betancourt feels that the OAS could be much more

effective than .it has been so far if only as a
forum for airing the truth about the Castro i
regime and for hardening the attitudes of the
rest of Latin America tovard the expansion of ~
Soviet satellites in the veatern benfephere.
Betancourt believes that the overt Soviet
intervention in Cuba hae Jarred the Latis
Avericans for more than the fact of the -

Sriuaph of Comunisn, per se, in that country.
