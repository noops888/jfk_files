"Communist Manifeste"™ frequently and studied it as an example
of ideological development. 7

the CP, USA to be a threat to the United States and had no
reason to believe that a person who joins the CP swears
allegiance to a foreign power or advocates the overthrow of

bringing about its program through democratic process. SCHEER

VIETNAM DAY COMMITTEE (VDC)

A booklet published by the VDC contained the
following policy statement of the VDC adopted
by the general membership, June, 1965

The Vietnam Day Committee is a group of students,
faculty and other members of the Bay area
community opposed to American intervention in
Vietnam, the Dominican Republic and wherever
else it may occur. Revolutionary struggles

for self-determination are sweeping the world
today. American suppression of these move-
ments, we believe, is immoral and a threat to
the peace of the world. The Vietnam Day
Committee is organizing non-violent direct
actions, teach-ins, door-to-door organizing

and other educational activities to oppose
American intervention. We believe that the
struggle for self-determination in other
countries is related to the struggle for
democracy in America--a democracy in which the
people have the facts and the power to make
decisions for themselves. The struggles in
America against racism, poverty, and bureau-
cratic conformity are part of the same move-
ment as the struggle against American militarism.
We must build a New America and join with those
people in Asia, Africa and Latin America building
a New World,

The PW issue of Febmiary 12, 1986, contained an
article headlined "A New Campaign Tackles Old Issues", :
written by CARL BLOICE. This article gives historical : i
-_ background of the City of Oakland, California and the ‘
FF “problems faced by the peer people in that city. It then
elites how DANIEL SIMON, M.D. had sent hundreds of letters
to Berkeley, California during the weck of June 22, 1965,
pointing out that Congressman JEFFREY COHELAN had failed
to take a stand in opposition to United States participation |
in the war inVietnam, and enclosed ecards addressed to i
Congressman COHELAN appealing to COHELAN to speak out
| strongly in Congress for a cease fire and international
| negotiations through the United Nations. The cards also
stated that unless. COHELAN took such action, he would be
oppesed for re-election. By August 1965, there had been
750 cards processed and returned to Dr. SIMON. When Con-
gressman COHELAN failed to speak out in Congress opposing
U.S. involvement in Vietnam, certain people began searching
for a candidate to oppose him, ROBERT SCHEER agreed to
oppose COHELAN, Some of his supporters left the organization
= because SCHEER refused to shave off his beard and others left
the organization because SCHEER refused to exclude communists
from his campaign committee, The article stated ROBERT SCHEER
had the endorsement of the VDC as well as a sizeable portion
of the community, and was not centered atiiong the college
| students. \

The "Berkeley Daily Gazette" newspaper, issue of
February 23,. 1966, carried a news article headlined "Peace
| Group Slates’ Scheer." This article states ROBERT SCHEER, |
| . candidate for Congressman, 7th Congressional District, would
speak under the sponsorship. of the Berkeley Women for Peace
on February 24, 1966, at Friends Meeting House, Berkeley.

It added that SCHEER, ‘an outspoken eritie of the Johnson

| Administration policies in Viet Nam, is presently touring

| South Viet Nam and Cambodia, the latter country at the in- |
| vitation of Prinee SHIANOUK." ‘It continued by stating, |
\ "Foreign Editor of Ramparts, author ef ‘Cuba - Tragedy in

a Hemisphere’ and ‘How the United States Got Involved in
{ Viet Nam.' Scheer is alse known for his association with |
the Center for Study of Democratic Institutions at Santa |

the office of the National Harbor and Ports Labor Union

ago, when he left Japan and went to Indenesia on a ten-day
trip. Before he left Japan of Indonesia, he claimed that
he strongly desired to go to Communist China. He was com-
plaining ‘to the Japanese labor union officials about the
discrimination problem in the U.S. and made derogatory
remarks about the U.S. The Japanese labor union official,
after listening to his desire to go to Communist China,
asked the Chinese Communists now staying in Tokyo about the
possibility of SHEA'S trip to the Chinese mainland. The
Chinese did not give a decisive answer. Although SHEA is
expected to return to Japan after his trip from Indonesia,
he may go to China directly from Indonesia. It is said

he wrote after he came back from a trip te Cuba. The article
contained some derogatory remarks about the U.S. Government.

of the SCHEER for Congress campaign and it was brought out
that SCHEER would be running on a domestic platform, in-
eluding such issues as the anti- -poverty war, police brutality,
ete. The main objection to SCHEER running as a candidate is
that he is running on the Democratic Party tieket. Most of
the VDC wanted him to run as an independent, but SCHEER dis-
agreed because he felt he could use the Democratic Party for
broad base support. :

FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTEE

The April 6, 1960, edition of "The New York Times"
newspaper contained a full-page advertisement captioned
"What Is Really Happening in Cuba," placed by the Fair Play
for Cuba Committee (FPCC). This advertisement announced
the formation of the FPCC in New York City and declared the
FPCC intended to promulgate “the truth about revolutionary
Cuba" to neutralize the distorted American press.

“The New York Times" edition of January 11, 1961,
reported that at a hearing conducted before the United States
Senate Internal Security Subcommittee on January 10, 1951,

Dr. CHARLES A. SANTOS-BUCH identified himself and ROBERT TABER
as organizers of the FPCC. He also testified he and TABER
obtained funds from the Cuban Government which were applied
toward the cost of the aforementioned advertisement.

On May 15, 1963, a source advised that during the
first two years of the FPCC's existence there was a struggle
between Communist Party (CP) and Socialist Workers Party (SWP)
elements to exert their power within the FPCC and thereby
influence FPCC policy. This source added that during the
past year there had been a successful effort by FPCC leadership
to minimize the role of these and other organizations in the fl
FPCC so that their influence as of May, 1963, was negligible.

The SWP has been designated by the Attorney Hl
General of the United States pursuant to
Executive Order 10450.

On May 20, 1963, a second source advised that
VINCENT "TED" LEE, FPCC National Office Director, was then
formulating FPCC policy and had indicated that he had no
intention of permitting FPCC policy to be determined by any
other organization. This source stated that LEE believed
that the FPCC should advocate resumption of diplomatic
relations between Cuba and the United States and should
support the right of Cubans to manage their revolution without
interference from other nations. LEE did not advocate
supporting the Cuban revolution per se.

FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTEE (cont'd.)

The November 22, 1963, edition of "The New York
Times" reported thet Senator THOMAS J. DODD of Connecticut
had called FPCC “the ch public relaticns instrument of
the Castro network in the United States." It is to be noted
that Senator DODD was a member of the Senate Internal
Security Subcommittee which twice conducted hearings on the
FPCC.

The December 27, 1963, edition of "The New York
World Telegram and Sun" newspaper stated that the pro-Castro
FPCC was seeking to go out of business and that its prime
activity during its lifetime had been sponsorship of pro-
Castro street rallies and mass picket lines, and the direction
of an active propaganda mill highlighting illegal travel-to-
Cuba campaigns. Its comparatively brief span of life was
attributed to’ mounting anti-Castro American public opinion,
the 1962 Congressional hearings which disclosed FPCC financing
by Castro's United Nations Delegation, md ultimately, the
bad publicity which the FPCC received from disclosure of
activities on its behalf by suspected Presidential assassin
LEE H. OSWALD.

On February 6, 1964, the previously mentioned
second source advised that V. T. LEE had recently remarked
that the FPCC was dead and that there were no plans to
organize another similar organization.

On April 13, 1964, a third scurce advised that

there had not been any FPCC activity in many months and that
the FPCC had been dissolved.

freedom for all peoples cf the world, and that these solutions
will be reached mainly through the united efforts of all democratic
elements in our country, comnosed essentially of the workine people
ellied in the unity of Neerces and other minorities with whites.
We further fully recognize that the createst threat to American
democracy comes from the racist and right wing forces in
coalition with the most reactionary sections of the economic power
structure, using the tool of an m to divide and destroy
the unified strusgle of the working people. As young people in
the forces struggling for democracy, we shall actively strive to
defeat these reactionary and neo-fascist elements and to achieve
complete freedom and democracy for all Americans, thus enabling
each individual to freely choose ard build the society he would
wish to live in, Through these struggles we feel the American
people will realize the viability of the socialist alternative."
