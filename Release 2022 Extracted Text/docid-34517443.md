A booklet published by the VDC contained the

following policy statement of the VDC adopted

by the general membership, June, 1965:

The Vietnam Day Committee is a group of students,

faculty and other members of the Bay area

community opposed to American intervention in

Vietnam, the Dominican Republic and wherever

else it may occur.

Revolutionary struggles

for self-determination are sweeping the world

today.

American suppression of these move-

ments, we belleve, is immoral and a threat to

ne peace of the world. the Vietnam Day

Committee is organizing non-violent direct

actions, teach-ins, door-to-door organizing

and other educational activities to oppose

American intervention. We believe that the

countries

is related to the struggle for

democracy in America--a democracy in which the

people have the facts and the power to make

decisions for themselves.

The struggles in

America against racism, poverty, and bureau-

cratic conformity are part of the same move-

ment as the struggle against American militarism.

We must build

a New America and join with those

people in Asia, Africa and Latin America building

a New World.

WOMEN FOR PEACE, aka

Women Strike for Peace

6060-0289

The "Berkeley Daily Gazette," a daily newspaper of

general circulation published in Berkeley, California,

when concern mounted over radioactive fallout

from nuclear testing, a group of women in

Washington, D. C. started Women Strike for Peace.

The idea spread rapidly throughout the

country

and now embraces 900 groups, including Women For

Peace groups in the San Francisco Bay area.

These groups support programs

to achieve goals

such as :

(1) Continued disarmament negotiations.

(2) A strong and flexible United Nations.

(3)

Planning now at state and"national levels

for conversion to peace-time economy and

positive efforts to ease world tensions.

The women act as individuals and as a group, with

specific actions suggested by individuals and

groups from all over the world.

Decision to

participate jointly on any given suggestion is

democratly arrived at by members of the

Coordinating Committee.

Effective cooperation

with other peace groups is encouraged.

Monthly

Coordinating Committee meetings and general

meetings,

as warranted, are open to all and

announced in mailings to members.

There are no

dues or membership forms nor conditions for

membership.

To stir an awareness of the need for peace,

Women For Peace encourage public education

in

peace objectives at local

schools and sponsor

peace-oriented demonstrations and public meetings,

newspaper ads, billboards, and

candidates for

public office.

On the national level the group

attempts to influence government officials by

letters and conferences.

An article appeared in "The Dally Californian, "

issue of March 1, 1966, which stated that ROBERT SCHEER

would give

"an eyewitness report from Southeast Asia" at

8:00 p.m. at the Berkeley Community Theatre, Berkeley,

California.

The article added,

"Scheer is a candidate for

congress in the ith congressional District and an authority

on U. s. policy in Vietnam."

The "Berkeley Dally Gazette" newspaper, issue

of March 1, 1966, carried a news article advertising the

above speech.

It also contained information to the effect

that SCHEER'S travels during February, 1966, took him to

Cambodia, Thailand and South Vietnam.

"The Daily Californian," Issue of March 4, 1966,

carried an article reporting the

results of an interview

by this newspaper on March 3, 1966, with ROBERT SCHEER, who

was scheduled to speak March 4, 1966, on the campus of C,

Berkeley®

This article quoted

SCHEER as stating that

Oakland, California might be the next Watts ana explode

(into race riots) because of the

"miserable conditions

which have persisted there for the last 25 years."

The

article then stated that SCHEER described a recent trip

he had taken to Cambodia, which he described as "one of

the few neutral governments in the world, very jealous of

its prerogatives.

SCHEER said he visited Cambodia at the

invitation of its government and was sent there by "Ramparts"

Magazine, of which he is Foreign Editor. He said he was

accompanied by STANLEY SCHEINBAUM,

"an adviser to the Diem

Government in Vietnam from 1955 to 1961."

SCHEER asserted

that after exploring the entire frontier between Cambodia

South Vietnam,

he concluded that "Cambodia was not being

used in any significant way, to support the fighting in south

Vietnam." He explained that by any significant way he meant

that Cambodia was not a

"major staging area for the Viet

Cong."

II. SUPPORT BY THE COMMUNIST PARTY

In early 1966, two functionaries of the CP discussed

the forthcoming trip by SCHEER to Southeast Asia and his desire

to go to North Vietnam.

Both functionaries agreed that an

effort should be made

plaining to the Japanese labor union officials about the

discrimination problem in the U.S. and made derogatory

The Japanese labor union official,

after listening to his desire to go to Communist China,

asked the Chinese Communists now staying in Tokyo about the

possibility of SHEA'S trip to the Chinese mainland.

The

Chinese did not give a decisive answer.

Although SHEA is

expected to return to Japan after his trip from Indonesia,

he may go to China directly fron Indonesia.

According to an article in the March 8, 1964, Issue

of the "San Francisco Examiner," a San Francisco daily morning

newspaper, TRACY SIMS stated among other things that following

a sit-in demonstration in San Francisco during October 1963 by

various civil rights groups, the groups realized that a central,

coordinating committee was needed.

The formation of AD HOC

COMMITTEE TO END DISCRIMINATION (AHCED) was the result and SIMS

became its chairman.

A source

reported on December 9, 1963, that in

December 1963 TRACY SIMS attended a joint

meeting of the San Francisco Communist Party

Youth Club and the Communist Party Berkeley

Off-Campus Youth Club.

A second source, on May 12, 1964, described AHCED as

a central body of representatives from

militant youth organiza-

tions whose purpose

was to work for equal civil rights and to

put pressure

on establishments and employers to hire more people

from

the minority races, especially Negroes.

A third source reported on March 13, 1964, that at

a meeting of the San Francisco Branch of the Socialist Workers

Party on March 11, 1964, KIPP DAWSON, a representative of

AHCED, related among other things that AHCED was directed and

controlled by

the W.E.B. DuBois Clubs of the Bay Area.

A fourth source reported on January 30, 1964, that

on January 29, 1964, KIPP DAWSON attended a San

Second source related on May 12, 1964, that the

W.E.B. DuBois Clubs of the Bay Area consisted

of the W.E.B. DuBois Clubs of San Francisco,

ing to source, any member of the W.E.B. DUBols

Club of San Francisco who attends San Francisco

State College is automatically a member of the

FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTEE

The April 6, 1960, edition of "The New York Times"

newspaper contained a full-page advertisement captioned

"What Is Really Happening in Cuba," placed by the Fair Play

for Cuba Committee (FPCC).

This advertisement announced

the formation of the FPCC in New York City and declared the

FPCC intended to promulgate "the truth about revolutionary

Cuba" to neutralize the distorted American press.

"The New York Times" edition of January 11, 1961,

reported that at a hearing conducted before the United States

senate Internal security subcommittee on January 10, 1951,

Dr. CHARLES A. SANTOS-BUCH identified himself and ROBERT TABER

as organizers of the FPCC.

He also testified he and TABER

obtained funds from the Cuban Government which were applied

toward the cost of the aforementioned advertisement.

on May 15; 1963, a

source advised that during the

first two years of the FPCC's existence there was a struggle

between Communist Party (CP) and Socialist Workers Party (SWP)

elements to exert their power within the FPCC and thereby

influence FPCC policy. This source added that during the

past year there had been a successful effort by FPCC leadership

to minimize the role of these and other organizations in the

FPCC so that their influence as of May, 1963, was negligible.

The SWP has

been designated by the Attorney

General of the United

States pursuant to

Executive Order 10450.

On May 20, 1963,

a second source advised that

VINCENT "TED" LEE; FPCC National Office Director, was then

formulating FPCC policy and had

indicated that he had no

intention of

permitting FPCC policy to be determined by any

other organization:

This source stated that LEE believed

that the FPCC should advocate resumption of diplomatic

relations between Cuba and the United States and should

support the right of Cubans

to manage their revolution without

interference from other nations.

LEE did not advocate

supporting the Cuban revolution per se.

FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTEE (cont'd.)

The November 23, 1963, edition of "The New York

Times' reported that Senator THOMAS J. DODD of Connecticut

had called FPCC "the chief public relations instrument of

the Castro network in the United States."

It is to be noted

that Senator DODD was a member of the Senate Internal

Security Subcommittee which twice conducted hearings on the

FPCC.

The December

27, 1963, edition of "The New York

World Telegram and Sun" newspaper stated that the pro-Castro.

FPCC was seeking to go out of business and that its prime

activity during its lifetime had been sponsorship of pro-

Castro street rallies and mass

picket lines, and the direction

of an active propaganda mill highlighting illegal travel-to-

Cuba campaigns.

Its comparatively brief span of life was

attributed to mounting anti-Castro American public opinion,

the 1962 Congressional hearings which disclosed FPCC financing

by Castro's United Nations Delegation, and ultimately, the

bad publicity which the EPCC received

from disclosure of

activities on its behalf by suspected Presidential assassin

LEE H. OSWALD.

On February 6, 1964, the previously mentioned

second source advised that V. T. LEE had recently remarked

that the FPCC was dead and that there were no plans to

organize another similar organization.

On April 13, 1964, a third source advised that

there had not been any FPCC activity in many months and that

the FPCC had been dissolved.
