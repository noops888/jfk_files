"FROM: «Lt. Colonel Robert ii. Alcorn

1. This letter is prompted by letter of even date
concerning tne Jedburgh accounting wnich you wished to transfer
to wy office. }

2. You wili recall that some months ago I protested
the fact that you hea transferred a staggeringly large aavance
to our books against Henry Hyce, a great pert of waich nad been
outstanding for neeriy two years. I was reiuctant at that é
time to accept a transfer for ola accountings in sizeuble i
amounts end I stili feei tnat each one of our field offices ;
snould be extrezeiy scrupulous in seeping outstanding acvances
to an absolute minimuz asa most certainiy in limiting tne i
lengta of time over snica taney may be carried. roa

3. During tne pest two or three months Caserta has
transferred several otner accounts to my office some of wnicns

ware long standing on Caserta's booxs ana in every case these |

transfers have been picxea up witn reiuctance. I snouic like!

to point out that my cirice, itn a total sersonnei of i4 H

Fe people, is nandling the largest theater spread over a terrific
vi ares from Norway to the deaiterrenean end srom the Unitea i i
Kingéom into Germany. We are harc pressec to keep our normal; :

business functioning smoothly, whoile at tne same time we :

control tae problems scich confront us wit tre establisnnent i

of new missions, suco as those to Denmarx, Norway, sad the new

. and large German Mission. Particularly curing the past six |

a: weeks we have been wording uncer terrific pressure because of ;

7 the constant shifting of personnel from peris to London to 1

i : Weshington, aiebrich, ana other points. in view of the fact |

} that we nave made every effort to close out ail outstenaing {

accounts as quickly as possidle in orcer that the reauction °

from Srecial Funds, covering money which he clains to have
“entrusted in good faith to the Algiers Cffice" before

sum of 2,000 Algerian francs, together with cther personal
property and docuzents, were turned cver to a British

to have delivered this bundle to Lt. (new Capt.) Bonnet: i

These transfers went through our books in July. We will con-
tinue to deposit b61.19.2 to Miss Taylor's account on th: last

Since you specifically listed the items 2s advances, we nave |
Geducted them frox salery payments made here. ‘The members of:

the group insist that these payments were for expenses incurred,.

and that nu repayment was to be made. We are inclosing. a cies
copy of a statement by one of the members of the group. Can you
straighten this matter out for us? Your memoranoum of June i

- gave us the information tnat one of the mencers of the group

hhaé been short changed in the amount of 1.0.0, but we can ao}
nothing about crediting the account of the proper individual
until we know nis name. if these itezs are to be considered ¢

TO: Captein Devid C. Crockett i
FROM: Lt. Col. Robert H. Alcorn ,
SUBJECT: Trensfer of So Accounts

1. In reply to your letter of 26 June, we did, as you,
Fy 4 state, transfer to your office the sut of 1,400,C00 French
frenes on our Novexber 1944 report for the £P0C/US Account.
“To imply from that, however, that the operation wes in any way
our responsibility or that we had any ‘mowledge of it Is to
overlock entirely tae circumstances under which the transfer
‘wes made. :
2. This transfer originated with the 7th Army, which,
. until that month, had been under your control. All funds te
; advanced through Algiers, 2nd all expenses incurred on it
were incurred in territories then uncer MEDTO control. Your
. . office eccepted the transfer of Noverter, and we cid not even
know, the nature of the operetion, since the project originated:
with you, was on ‘/th Army. books when they came under our pac
end was returned to you without apperent objection.

3. To have credited us with ‘mowing, when we made the!
inesataduena trensfer, thet "the moment Teams hit the ground they vere the
f i responsibility of the FTO for debriefing and handling" is to
have grented us extreordinary prescience. A much core practical
way of bencling the transection would have been for you to have
trensferred the. advances made in Algiers to us as they were mace,
if, es you ssy in Paragrepn 6,“these teams went through Algiers
only for the convenience of getting them into, Southern France; |
and they "drew funds from me on the.besis of approvals in Londen,
and thet we lost jurisdiction over thes the minute they hit the
“ soil of France." In that way London could have had some know-
ledge of the responsibilities which you claim ere ours.

i

i 4. Apparently I must repeat that the Jedburgh financing
for your theeter was not handled throuzh my office and none of j
the arrangements effecting such operetion were ever discussed F|
with me. Therefore, despite what Colonel Glavin says with j

Captain Crockett -2- 6 July 1945 \
: 5]

respect to the responsibility of this theater, the fact still
rerzains that the entire operation finencielly 1s end always

hzs been yours. With respect _to the close of your paragraph 6
asxing that I inform you how I tlecide to handle this, beceuse
you ere closing your theater, I-gan only state that the decision
ds one which is eutonetic, and the one originally teken. : In
effect it is your problem and the final accounting and the closing
out of the sccount is for you to handle. That © you will not
be able to handle it after July 15, would seem a rather troed
statement in view of the fact that I assumed your responsibility
as Special Funds Officer for the theater itpeses upon you the
obligation to close all of your eccounts regardless of any deac-

line which you may wish to impose.

5. ‘ith respect to your paregraph 5 in which you stete:
*hs you have let Colonel Baker "slip" through your fingers™--I
apparently cust repeat what I said in my letter of June 21,
peregraph 3--"Colonel Bak stopped in ny office abcut ten dzys
ego on his way to Washington end. agreed with me that it would
be absolutely impossible for the account to be cleared here, in
view of the fect thet I had none of the background or records
which would be aveileble to your office." j

6. I heve no intention of treating a matter of this
: 4aportance on the besis of picayune accusations, such as are
contained in your paragraphs 7 and 9, 2s I wish to stay om the

overell subject.

- %. As we now understand the trensfer of Hovember, it
cen be broken down into two parts: i

1,000,000 French frencs advenced to Col. Baker, and
400,000 on SO Operations Barres, Bruyers, Rostand.
In regerd to Barres, we credited you on our trensfer of 29 Jenv-
ary with returns mede to this office by Paul C. Sheeliney - His
gecount wes cleared, with the exception of-t5,000 francs he had
edvenced to 2 war correspondent, for which he essumes personal
responsibility, and a personal zavence of 2,500 francs. “All
that remains is to itemize and enter the expenses listed on the
statement we sent your office, end to collect 17,500 frencs

from Sheeline. i

Paris picked: up from your trensfer of 25 May 622,774 francs on
Col. Baker's Avignon account. Presumably you have an accounting
for the difference between that figure end the 1,000,000 advenced.
Lt. Sichel stated that he believed Col. Beker had made én eccout-
ing in Paris. Ye ere reouestirz confirmation of thet, and if so,
his account is presumably cleared. If not, 4t will have to be
transferred to Washington. | H

Dear Dave:

thought to how we aay clea> cutstanding financial matters with re]
gard to personnel of OSS zttached to the 7th Aray.

Naturally I have ne idea from this end as to how your 1
units are set un with res:ect to funds; that is, how sany pecpie there
may .be in the field. with zévances outstanding and how zany continuing
projects or operations Gu_y authorized and budgeted may be at‘ the
present time handled by 725 nie groups,

Purely fron cabie corresnordence I patuer that yourman
Sichel is assigned to the 7th army for the purzose of haz
Special Funds sa‘ters. Herever, I am wondering if it would be scs>
sible for you to submit te xy Londen Office with + cozy to
Sprinzsteen, Paris, a listing of all advances outstanding with the

7th aray and any other pertinent data concerning operzticnal profects. .

For the time being we can continue to operate ds we are now
Going by keeping each otte= constantly advised and vorking close2zj
together in ar effort to seep things on an even keel. wever, iti
might be vell to set a de:
all personnel as:igned by CSS to the~7th Army should be advised that
Special Funds matters wiil come directly. under the ccntrc] of the 4
Paris Office, and, of ccurse, autonatically under iordécn. Sichel”
will of course continue ts ooerate th the 7th sray, but I thi
of 1 November he shoulé tercrt to Puris rather than. ito Caserta ard}
shoulé come more directly under my office.

I am sure you xiii realize that tis is a. most airticult
letter te “rite and I do net mean to. sound vresuaptucus cr
dictatorial; however, in view of the fact that the powers that be +;
have brought the\7th Army uncer ETO, I think ycu will understenc {
that it is absolutely essential for us to regularize cur: om shop
in order to confora. q

I am hoheful that we may be able to sit down together and
work out the details in cerscn end with that thought in xind I az j
