In your letter of 27 May, you notified us of travel

advances amounting to b40.0.O to wombers oi the nquail group..

Since you specifically listed the items as advances, we nave

deducted them fron salary payments made bere. The members. of.

and that no repayment was to be made.

We are Inclosing a

nothing about crediting the account of the proper individual

TO:

Captain David C. Crockett

FROM: It. Col. ñobert H. Alcorn

SUBJECT: Iransfer of SO Accounts

1. In reply to your letter of 26 June, we did, as you

state, transier to your office the sur of 1,400,000 French

frenes on our novezber 1944 report for the SPOC/US Account.

To imply fror that, however, that the operation mas in any ray

our responsibility or that me had any monledge of it is to

overlock entirely the circu-stances under which the transfer

•TaS

made.

2.

This transfer originated sith the 7th Army, which,

until that nonth, had been under your control.

All funds

advances through riglers,

and all expenses incurred on it

vere Incurred In territories then uncer HEDTO control.

Your

office accepted the transfer of Noverker, and we did not even

know, the neture o! the operation,

since

the project originated:

with jou,

WaS

on 'ith Army. books when trey came under our ontrol,

and was returned to you without apparent objection.

3.

To have credited us with nowing, when we made the

¿transfer,

that "the soment Teams hit the ground they "ere the

responsibility of the ETO for debriefing and handling" is to

have grented us extraordinary prescience.

A much more practical

way of handling the transaction would have been for you to have

transferred the advances made in Algiers to us as they were nade,

"these teams went through Algiers

and that ve lost jurisdiction over thes the minute they hit the

soil of frence."

In that may London could have had sone loon-

ledge of the responsibilities which you claim are. ours.

Apparently I must repeat that the jedburgh financing

for your theater ras not handled through my office and none of i

the arrangements effecting such operation were ever discussed

Therefore, despite what Colonel Glavin says with

respect to the responsibility of this theater'is and always.

the fact still

rezains that the entire operation financially

has been yours.

Fith respect to the close of your paragraph 6

as'sing that I inform you how I decide to handle this, because

you are closing your theater,

I-can only state that the decision

1s one which is autoratic, and the one originally taken. : In

effect it is your problem and the final accountine and the closing

out of the secount 1s for you to handle.

that'

you will not

be able to handle it after July 15,

would seen a rather broad

statement in view of the fact that I assumed your responsibilit

as Special Funds Officer for the theater inposes upon you the

obligation to close all of your accounts

regardless of any dead-

line which you may wish to impose.

5.

Tith respect to your paragraph 5 in which you stete:

"As you have let Colonel Baker "slig" through your fingers--I

apparently must repeat what I said in my letter of June 21,

peregraph 3---Colonel Baker stopped in ny office abcut ten

ago on his way to Hashington and agreed with me that it would

be absolutely Impossible for the account to be cleared here, 1n

view of the fect thet I had none of the

background or records

mkich mould be available to your office.n

• 6. I have no intention of treating a matter of this

Isportance on the basis of picayme accusations, to stay on the

contained in your paragraphs 7. and 9, as I wish

overell subject.

7.

As we now understand the transfer of lovember, 1t

can be broken donn into two parts:

1,000,000 French francs advanced to Col. Baker, and

400,000 on SO Operations Barres, Bruyers,

Rostand.

Is regard to Barres, we credited you on our transfer. of 29 Janu-

ery mith returns made to this office by Paul C. Sheelinel Ais

eccount was cleared, with the exception or 15,000 Irancs he had

edvanced to a war corresponcent,

responsibility, and a personal advance of 2,500 francs. " All

that remains 1s to Itemize and enter the expenses listed on the

statement we sent your office, and to collect 17,500 francs

from Sheeline.

Paris picked up fron your transfer of 25 May 622,774 franes on

Col. Baker's Avignon

Presumably you have an accounting

for the difference between that figure and the 1,000,000 advanced.

Lt. S1chel

stated that he believed Col. Beker had made an account-

1ng in Paris.

Vie are recuestir. confirmation of that, and if so,

his account is presumably cleared.

Now that the 7tr Army has more or less come under our

jurisdiction I am fondering whether or not you have given

any

thought to how ne Jay clear cutstanding financial matters with re-

gard to personnel of OSS attached to the 7th arny.

Naturally I hate no idea fron this end as to how your

units are

set un with rest-ct to funds;

that is, how Jany peopie

there

may be in the field: with vances outstanding and hor sary continuing

projects or operations cut authorized and budgeted may be at the

present time handled by lie Arny groups:

Purely fron cabie correspordence I father that yourman

Sichel 1s assigned to the 7th irmy for the purpose of hardiing

Special Funds natters.

PoTevEr, I am wondering if it would be cosi

sible for you to

subnit Ic ny ucnoon office with & copy to

Springsteer,

Paris,

a listing of all advances outstanding i1th the

Ith Army and any other pertinent data concerning operational projects.

For the time belay re can continue to operate as ve are how

doing by xeening each otre= constantly advised and

working closelyi

together in ar effort to keep things on an even keel.

HOTEVEr, it!

might be tell to set a dadline, such as 1 November,

after which time

all personnel as igned by OSs to ühe 7th Army should be advised that

Special Funds natters wii: come directly under the control of the

Paris Office, and,

of course,

autonatically under jorcon.

Sichel

will of course continue to operate with the 7th army, but I thirs as

of 1 Novenber he should report to Püris rather than to Caserta aral

should come more directly under my office.

I am sure you fill realize that tds is a most difficult

"rite and I do not mean to. sound presunptucus.cr

dictatorial; however, in view of the fact that the comers that be

nave brought the 7th army incer slo, l think you will understeni

hat it 1s absolutely essential for us to regularize cur oan sho:

in order to conform.

I am hopeful tha: ve may be able to sit down together and

work out the details in serson and with that thought in zind I az!:

SUBBCT: Quail Advances

TO

8 Major Robert Hayden Aloorn, 035- London

I have

some further Information on the cuall

advances as Captain

Brewster has show un in Algiers.

He personally gave the money to the egents and told them

that the money was not expendable, and

the men clearly

understood that they were to aocount for the advance.

He oannot give us any further Information 88

to tho was short-changed but suggests that we wait for

someone to alain it.

If no one olains it jou will have

to follow my suggestion of an sarller lotter on the di8-

posal of this money.
