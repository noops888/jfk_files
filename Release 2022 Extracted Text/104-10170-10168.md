In thie addendum to the OVERSEAS FAMILY article, I sve sat sought to refute er
confirm each and every assertion made ty ite nuthor, Thomas C. Lucey, Ur. Lucey, despite
Nie citing a substantial rumber of inaccuracies, hns fonetheizss ¢ f.

what may be termed the fundemental truth. with this in wind, = Save fried to set the
record: etraicht only, insofar ag it ert

ne to those inacceracies - and omissions
= which in my opinion reflect adversely onthe whole.

“In order to view irs Lucey'e. account in a somewhat different perepective, I. shall
begin ‘by advising that I. firet went to’work for the Central. isteiligence agency zuch
earlier than Aupiist-1962. It was during the winter of 1955-5f, weile ‘assigned a Case
Review Officer. with the Counter Intelligence Corps: eat Los Angeles,» that I wae initially
‘-recruited.into.the CIA's farflung notwork of informants and agents, one ofa number, I

to me:-through .-photographs...ae,.en- officiél, from. CIA headqutrters, then locéted on’ "E*

D.
minders’ that I owed ‘a greater duty to ay-country than to the militery establishment, i
served. a8 a ‘“non=paidy. confidential inforcant..off-and on until xy resignation from the
to the ‘Agency

Army in Octobér 1959. “A complete description of the information I suzfl
during my military cereer would-only add'to-what must perforce become a lengthy nddendu:
may it euffice to say that it did not alweys-scem germane to intetligence affairs, but
when. it did it-consisted mainly of an assortment of data that for so-called discretionary
réacons- was seldom passed on to, the Agency (or for thet matter, to.our own higher

echelons) through reguler channels,”

Mr. Lucey's: statoment, “Being merriod “to “a foreign natizaal meant an automatic
removal ‘from intelligence -work 80 Nagell.decided to leave the army,” is misleading end
incorrect in ite entirety. The only military intelligence orgszization from which en
individual is. normelly removed subsequent to marrying a foreign astional’ ir the CIC ~
primarily a security type orgen’= and this’ rule doos-not necesserily apply when the agent
ip an ‘enlisted ‘man. or: warrant officers” As a commigsioned officer, I wns declered
ineligible for further. duty with the.CIC effective 14 aril 1 a full year after. ay
morriage to."a ‘foreign, national. I was not barred from aesi to other, even more
sensitive, UI organizations auch as Field Operations Intelligence, then the. clandestine
eopionage depsrtuent of militsry intelligence. ‘As for the reasons I left the Aray, they
were. clearly if euphemisticelly expluinod- in ay secon’ letter cf.resignation, dated
91 august'1959, namely: "I desire to tender. ay resignation because I wish to further ay
civilian education. It is not possible for me to purcue the curriculue of which I am
desirous while on active duty. Also, comptssionate reasons of  rerronal nature exist

+ for desiring to tender my resignetion at this time.”

My patronage under the CIA did not end with my dischur,e from the Army and ensuing
employzent in Decomber 1959 as an investigator for the State of Cslifornia; in fact,
henceforth I was offered remuneration for my servicce, however nozizal it rometimes wns.
What my new taske cozpriced is of to ‘real pertinence to this sddendun or to later
developments, except perhaps to sention that one of my contects.said he worked out of
“Domestic Intellirenco,” possibly thé forerunner of the’ present-dst oxestic Operations
Division, . which illegally keeps tabs on'a wide -ronre-of American ian organizations
and activities. I should-olso point out that I did not quit my position with the. State
of California “to work for the CIA," e6 idplied.by Mr. Lucey. ‘I was dismissed, in. June
1962, at my own option and in my opinion for. doing?my job. . (The f>ttowing sonth I wes

Rwiee ostencibly, other highly-placed government officials. :

Mr, Lucey goes onto state that my last assirnment at the tice “was to penetrate the
Feir Play for Cuba:Comaittee, where he dot Oswald.” Such otatement is also incorrect. I
was never @ member, bond-fide or otherwise, of the FFCC. And my conversations with FPCC
functionaries like Steve Roberts, an official of the Socialiet Workers Porty at Loe
Angeles, could hardly be construed as a penetration. furthermore, I had been introduced
to Mr. Oswald long before the FFCC came into existence, albeit under an aosuned name.

AS to. the .allurion that. I told “Bob” I was an intelligence man, not a killer,
therefore I couldn't’ill Mrs’ ‘Oewald, while the reference is true ite connotation is
deceptive. I had killed before and I had*participated in homicides under the auspicea of
both UI and the CIA (one instance being the part I played in the February 1958 abduction-
interrogation-murder of an FOI egent U.S. soldier, MSCT Emmett E. Dugan, from Crafton,
Pa-, suspected of having defected place to the Chinese), under the guise that an
American variation of the Soviet affair" was the only alternative, that it was
either essential to dome overall intelligence effort or in the best interests -of our
national ‘security. “and -it wae a. similar-sounding argument, ultimately reduced to a
threat, that was advanced to me by Robert Graham. as an incentive to dierose of Mr. Oswald
in Septender 1963. But my refusal to do so had absolutely no bearing on the reason for
effecting my arreat in:ti I chose, nor did it engender in me fear of ropriaal by

the CIA.

Pertaining to sy arrest ‘and convictions at El Paso, Texas, which the official
spokesmen and tha press:have 80 néatly lebeled 00 being for “bank robbery," let ono of
the government's own spurious records, the aprelate court decision that finally yawned a
judgement of acquittal in ay case, give ite version: “The charge was then, and is now,
entering a federally insured bank with intent-to rob." What the record aptly ignores ia
the fact that two juri: incensed by the prosecution's innuendoes in and out of the
courtroom (and by the ranificationa of perjured testimony and a false Bureau of Priaone
report mate availeble to the jury during ite deliberations at the second trial = though
never foraally admitted into evidence) that I-was a Comnuhist, no doubt a very red spy,

With regard to ay sarital status and ay children, the forenost area that Urs Lucey
sppears to have exploited, I have never claimed that’ "Uncle Sam hidea ay family“ or
stated that FBI and CIA agents deliberately isolated me from ay wife and children; nor
have I claimed that the agency ueed the promise of rouniting we vith ay farily as part of
the incentive for accepting the assignzent in tho GDR. My accusations in this respect
centered around my children and they were leveled at the State Department as the result
of ‘a promise made to me shortly after my reloase from the GDR. Since returning to the
United St Vai source hao inforced me that ay wife waa granted a
fh

ee period during my imprigonment in the USA and although I
have never been served with a copy of tho docree or other notification of divorce (or
notice of a divorce hearing) I see no cause to dispute the advisement.

concerning the aspersions cast on my sanity, at this writing permit me to
y only ‘that I have never in zy life been certified peychotic by any U.S. aedical
authority .or adjudicated aentally-incoapetent in a court of law, notwithstanting th

conflicting legal-and medical opinicns aa to my mental condition on the day of ay arrest
