She knew of no friends of CAIN's except

PIERREYRROUPENSKY who CAIN indicated was now in Paris.

She did not know and had never met GIANCANA; however,

she

heard of him from the time she resided in Chicago with

CAIN before their divorce.

She promised to notify this

office if she heard anything further from CAIN. She was

aware that CAIN had gone to jail but that during the time

she was married to CAIN, he was working the other side of

the fence and she met many prominent Chicago politicians

through him.

Nothing further has been heard from her and it

was determined that she and her current husband have been

transferred to San Salvador.

advised

that he located a registration for a Mr. and Mrs.

It is felt that CIA, Paris

may have some knowledge L

DE the whersaDents of PEARE kOuP Ky, who formerly had an

advertising agency in Mexico City.

Dex 170a wised 9/22/72 that Mexico City telephone

number 5-90-00-70, is listed to AURORA M. DE QUIROZ, Coruna 54,

Colonia Alamos, Mexico City. It is noted that Mexico City

telephone numbers are frequently listed in the name, of a

person other than the actualy occupant. However, 'a

• 'pretext

call to this number determined that the current occupant of

this number is irs. QUIROZ (AD 6(4)

(*24)

It is noted that both MEX 287

and MEX 34thave reported

rumors that GIANCANA was residing in Beirut, Lebanon. However,

this has never been confirmed.

In addition,

MEX 287 reported

a rumor that subject GIANCANA supposedly was ou a safari in

Africa early in 1972.

This allegedly was a photographic safari

and he was accompanied by a girl friend.

Mexico City has not

set a lead by LHM for the State Department Security Office to

check travel by subject GIANCANA in Kenya because Mexico City

does not have current passport data concerning the subject

GIANCANA.. It is felt that he would travel under his true name f

Pretext inquiries by MEX 34 at the apartment house

at Amsterdam 82, Mexico City, where subject GIANCANA had a

penthouse, indicated that subject GIANCANA aS SAM DE PALMA

Nex to a sy, we

resided there for about two years but departed about 6/71 eu

A pretext call to an architect contact resulted in

the information that GIANCANA was in Beirut (g)

However, this same source indicated that as of 6/72

GIANCANA was back in Mexico City living in a house he bought

in Pedregal de San Angel. (g) 8a

MEX 287 on regular contact most recently 9/20/72

advised that he had not been in contact with subject but

knew he was in Mexico City as mutual friends have seen him.

GIANCANA was reportedly playing golf at the Churubusco Golf

Club 9/17/72.
