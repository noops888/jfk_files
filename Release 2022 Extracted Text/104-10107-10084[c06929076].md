MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Thomas L. Roberts

1. Messrs. Ward Greene, Office of Security, Kenneth
Heinonen, LPGLOBE Case Officer, and I arrived in Frankfurt,
Germany, at 1100 hours, 19 February 1969, and were met by a
representative of the Frankfurt Base. Mr. Greene and I then
were taken to a safehouse and Mr. Heinonen waited for Mr.
Roberts to arrive from Dakar and then brought him to the
safehouse, It had been agreed upon earlier that the debriefing
of Roberts would not commence until Thursday morning; however,
Mr. Heinonen did discuss general LPGLOBE matters and some
broad aspects of the Itkin problem with Roberts on the afternoon
of 19 February. Mr. Greene and I went to the Frankfurt Base
where we met with the Chief of Base, Mr. McManus, and Chief
of Security, Mr. Crawford,

2. It was decided to start the debriefing from Roberts!
earliest contact with the FBI, which occurred in Boston some time
in 1950, and proceed chronologically covering Roberts! subsequent
move to New York City, then discuss: his employment with the law
firm of Delson, Levin and Gordon, which was followed in 1957 by
the formation of the law firm of Itkin, Roberts and Greenbaum.
Subsequently we discussed his employment with CIA, which
involved his disengagement from the New York law firm and
cover for his various trips to Africa. We repeatedly stressed
his contacts with Herbert Itkin over the years 1955 through 1967.

3. It was considered that Roberts had.a very difficult task
if he intended to conceal or deceive the Agency about his relation-
ships with Herbert Itkin. This conclusion was reached since
Roberts could not anticipate what information was available to
the debriefers, Roberts was advised that Mr. Greene was from

the Office of Security, which carried with it the inference that
he had been privy to all the reports Roberts gave to the FBI,
Roberts was told that I had dealt with Mr. Hogan's office, the
New York District Attorney, and Mr, Morgenthau, the United
States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, and had
talked with Herbert Itkin personally. Roberts was fully cooper-
ative during the entire debriefing and did not hesitate to discuss
any topics. Z

4, We concluded that Roberts has not been involved in any
of Itkin's illegal activities since Roberts has been an employee of
CIA, It is my opinion that Roberts is an individual with a strong
sense of dedication to principles so long as they result in what he
considers a worthwhile sense of accomplishment. I think it is
significant to mention this assessment since Roberts does not give
the impression of having been motivated solely by monetary rewards
in any of his activities. This lack of concern for money was dis-
turbing during certain phases of the debriefing because Roberts
was rather vague about the amount of income he received from the
law firm of Itkin, Roberts and Greenbaum. He stated that he used
a drawing account and only took what was needed for his living
expenses. Roberts gives the impression of being a proud individual
who is not prone to admit to his personal deficiencies. The
LPGLOBE files contain several references to admonitions given
by station representatives to Roberts for non-achievement in the
operational field. Although Roberts did not allude to these
admonitions voluntarily, he did discuss them when asked,

5. It was our feeling that Roberts did not discuss with
Herbert Itkin his employment with CIA, nor did he discuss with
Itkin his earlier reporting activities to the FBI. Roberts was
not aware of Itkin's relationship to CIA and did not know of
Mario Brod's affiliation with CIA,

6 After the debriefing had been concluded, Roberts was
told of the possible exposure of his employment with CIA by
Itkin's defense counsel, F. Lee Bailey, should Itkin be tried in
the New York state court, Roberts appeared to be genuinely
disturbed and expressed bitter feelings toward Itkin since he

feels that such exposure could prevent him from performing
future operational assignments. He is enthusiastic about his
future assignment to Paris and is hopeful that circumstances
will permit him to pursue his operational tasks in the very

near future.

7. Mr. Roberts left Frankfurt for Dakar the night of
21 February and was told to continue with his disengagement
plans as his departure from Dakar had already been announced
to his local contacts. It was suggested that Roberts take a boat
from Dakar to Marseille. After his arrival in Marseille, Roberts
was. to proceed to Austria and take a ski vacation which is con-
sistent with earlier vacation plans when he traveled from Dakar
to Austria during the month of March’ for skiing in previous
years, Roberts has been instructed to remain in contact with
LPGLOBE so that further instructions can be furnished him when
a firm estimate of future events with regard to the Itkin trial
can be decided.

8. On 24 February 1969, I discussed with Mr. David
Murphy, Chief of Station, Paris, the possible exposure of Roberts
in the event Herbert Itkin is tried in the New York state court.
I explained how Roberts had been a law partner of Itkin but as a
result of our debriefing in Frankfurt we had concluded that
Roberts was not involved with illegal activities with Itkin since
Roberts has been employed by CIA, Mr. Murphy appreciated
being briefed on the complicated case but indicated that he was
anxious for Roberts to arrive in Paris for his operational assign-
ment in view of the priority need for his services in penetrating
certain leftist organizations, Mr. Murphy felt that if Headquarters
was considering a cooling off period for Roberts of approximately
three or four months, Murphy would hope that Roberts could
spend this time in Paris establishing himself with the target
community and not have any station contacts. Mr. Murphy
understands that this decision of necessity must be made at
Headquarters, but that he as Chief of the Paris Station does not
feel that circumstances as they exist today represent a compromise
of such magnitude that would preclude Roberts! operational assignment
to Pari
