WASHINGTON CONCERNED OVER CAMBODIAN BROADCAST ALLUDING TO DEATH

OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY

Msg NI: 151/ DGP/X

10 Dec 63 1146

I have the honor to inform you that Ambassador YOST, on

instructions from the State Department, told me

that yesterday

morning Radio Cambodia broadcast a bulletin from the Ministry

of Information inviting the Cambodian people to celebrate the

recent death of "the enemies of Cambodia, DIEM and SARIT."

The text of this broadcast stated, "the big boss ((A)) of these

aggressors has met the same fate. Those who ill-treat Cambodia

and scorn our revered leader will not live long and will be

destroyed." The transmission announced that leave would be

granted to any official wanting to attend this celebration.

Ambassador YOST consequently expressed the serious mis-

givings of Washington at the allusion to the death of President

KENNEDY. The American Government is shocked at hearing the

allusion in this "barbaric declaration" and expresses the hope

that a public disavowal of the allusion to the death of President

KENNEDY may be made.

I replied that I reserve my opinion for the moment, since I

do not hold the text of the statement. Nevertheless, I pointed

out to Ambassador YOST that His Royal Highness and the Royal

Government gave proof of their esteem and respect for President

KENNEDY by sending Prime Minister KANTOL to Washington to attend

the funeral.

I also told him that our people enjoy a long history

of culture, civilization and religion. Therefore, I rejected

categorically the expression "barbaric declaration" used by

Ambassador YOST. He informed me that Ambassador SPROUSE will

seek an audience with His Royal Highness on this matter.

DÃ©marches will be made simultaneously in Phnom Penh and

Washington, demonstrating that Washington is shocked by this

painful allusion to the former President.

Please cable instructions.
