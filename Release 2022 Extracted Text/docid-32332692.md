Prostitution

Prostitution flourishes in New York despite

periodic drives. by vice officers to stamp it out.

rostitutes working in New York may be classified as street

walkers, call girls, house girls and bar hustlers.

Street walkers operate daily between 9:00 p.m.

and 4:00 a.m., on Manhattan's west side, particularly between

42nd and 59th

streets.

These girls are predominantly colored

prostitutes who, for financial reasons, prefer white men but

are not permitted to mingle in bars catering to a white

clientele.

A white street walker, who lives among Negroes and

is source of this office, is well acquainted with a number of

street walkers and their pimps.

Through her efforts many of

the street walkers and their pimps have been identified and,

where there were indications of interstate transportation,

appropriate investigation has been conducted. It is not

unusual on any evening to observe colored pimps drive their

girls to the area around Central Park South and Seventh Avenue,

where the prostitutes alight from the late model Cadillacs

to begin their evening's work.

The average price is around

$35.00 - $50.00 and the john is expected to provide a rcom..

Unless the prostitute mistakenly approaches a vice patrolman

and accompanies him to a room, an arrest of a street walker

is difficult since most of them are adept at spotting a

surveilling officer.

Dotted throughout New York are a number of

houses of prostitution which consist of a one or two-bedroom

apartment with a madam and one or two girls. On the west side

of New York this type of operation abounds in the Seventies

and Eighties,

where the average price is $10.00 - $15.00.

On

che east side this same type of operation exists, also in the

Seventies and Eighties, but the surroundings are

• better and

the fees are usually between $25.00 - $50.00.

Sources of this office, who operate in this

category, have advised that there are

no organized vice rings

supplying girls to these houses and that each house is strictly

an individual operation. This is supported by the fact that

NEW YORK CITY FUR MARKET

The New York City Fur Market is concentrated

in mid Manhattan in about 12 square blocks from West

27th Street to West 3lst Street, between Broadway

and 8th Avenue. Virtually every buildingin this

area is completely devoted to the housing of some

phase of the fur industry. According to reliable

sources bout 90% of all fur garment manufacturing

in the United States is confined to the New York market.

Further New York City is considered the fur marketing

center of the world. Raw and dressed fur skins of all descriptions

are imported to New

York City from all parts of the world

and sold at auction by two principal auction houses,

The New York Fur Auction Company and The Hudson Bay

Company.

Subsequent to purchase by manufacturers,

skins are made into/variety of garments and sold

largely through jobbers to retail outlets.

Most

mnaufacturers also are jobbers.

In this regard it is to

be noted that almost all retailers of fur garments depend

on an army of Resident Buyers who act as Brokers

between manufacturers, jobbers and retailers.

who has more than 20

that there are about 2,000 manufacturers

in the New

York Market representing about 90 per cent of all

manufacturers in the United States with' principal

competition in Chicago, Philadelphia and Los Angeles.

These New York manufacturers constitute the nucleus
