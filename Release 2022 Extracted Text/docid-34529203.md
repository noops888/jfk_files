JFK Act 5 (g) (2) (D)

(LISTED CHARACTER REFERENCE) On 28 October 1968, a physical

check was conducted at 1435 Ogden Avenue, Bronx, New York, New. York, in

an attempt to locate Juanita Reyes, listed character reference of Manuel

MARTI, with negative results.

A check of the names on the mail boxes in

the apartment building located at the above address failed to reveal any

listing for reyes. The wife of the building superintendent, name not

furnished, was contacted and she stated that she had never heard of Reyes

and there was no one by that name residing in the building.

AGENT'S NOTES: SUBJECT'S SPH, dated 1 August 1968, reflects the

above address for Reyes. A courtesy letter addressed

to Reyes was returned

by the Post Office Department with the

statement "Addressee unknown".
