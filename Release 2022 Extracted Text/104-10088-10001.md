‘COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL

Although this employee is s fine intelligence officer end bes worked
very hard for the Chief of Station, Mexico City, I consider the reting
of Outstending in ell specific duties and for over-ell performence to be
excessively high. Reporting on the ectivities she supervises has been
as good as thet fron other Mexico City operations but is still n
to DDP stander’s. While most of the projects shé,is concerned
hendled with proper cost consciousness, at least ‘gue of them, the LITEMPO
Project, is not. The egents are peid too much end-their activities ere
not adequately reported. This has been celled tothe station's attention.

Miss Goodpasture has-been.on sick’leave since July 1972 awaiting
medical retirement in October\q9%3” She is a charter member of the Agenc.
having entered on duty from OSS\ and its successor organizations. Her
career is highly distinguished by virtue of consistently strong to out-
standing performance, all of which is fully documented.

In addition to several staff and desk assignments, Miss Goodpasture
served in support of the successful coup against the communist government
in Guatemala in 1254 and completed tours of duty in<Bombay} Monterrey and
Mexico City. Undoubtedly, the high point of her career occurred during
her service in ico City from 1957 through 1970, where she served as a
"“trouble-shooti case officer for the incomparable Winfield Scott
(deceased), who was then the Chief of Station. Mr. Scott, a stern task-
master, described Miss Goodpasture over these years as “intelligent, hard-
working, consc jous, versatile, valuable and unquestionably one of the
most competent C1/CE officers he ever had the: privilege of working with.’
Miss Goodpasture's fitness reports were totally consistent with this
appraisal, and were characterized by outstanding ratings. In her fina
assignment prior to acute medical problems, she worked for the CI Staff
(October 1970-Cctober 1971), earning the following remarks from her
supervisor: "...I venture to rate her overall performance, thirty years
of it, as Outstanding. Ann is one of the tough warp-threads on which
this organization is woven, and when she retires the fabric of this organj-
zation will be kened." The reviewing official agreed with the above
and recorded his hope that Miss Goodpasture get the official Agency recogni
