4. MAJOR CUBELA WAS A POPULAR AND PROMINENT UNIVERSITY

STUDENT LEADER, AN ARDENT REVOLUTIONARY AND ONE OF THE EARL’

OF CASTRO DURING THE BATISTA REGINE. CUBELA WAS ALSO A CLOSE

FRIEND OF CASTRO AND UNTIL THE ARREST RANKED HIGH AMONG THE LEADERS

OF THE REGIME, HIS ARREST AND ABJECT CONFESSION AT THE PUBLIC

TRIAL CONDUCTED IN STALINIST FASHION TRIGGERED OFF A SERIES OF

STUDENT REACTIONS. THE TRIAL IN EFFECT BACKFIRED AGAINST THE REGIME.
. . §. UPI REPORTS AND OTHER INTERNATIONAL NEWS SERVICES,

INCLUDING ACCOUNTS OF REFUGEES WHO DEPARTED RECENTLY FROM CUBA,

TESTIFIED TO THE FACT THAT ANTI-GOVT STUDENT AGITATIONS OCCURRED.

WALL SCRIBBLINGS ON UNIVERSITY BUILDINGS THREATENED CASTRO, ONE

READING: "ONE HEAD PAYS FOR ANOTHER," ANOTHER READ "OUT WITH FIDEL."

6. BECAUSE OF THE STRONG OPPOSITION TO THE TRIAL, CASTRO

REQUESTED THE STATE PROSECUTOR NOT TO IXPOSE THE DEATH SENTENCES.

IN ORDER PLACATE ADVERSE PUBLIC OPINION THE TRIAL PROCEEDINGS WERE

GIVEN WIDS COVERAGE ON BOTH RADIO AND TELEVISION CIRCUITS. AS A

RESULT, CUBELA AND OTHERS GRANTED CLEMENCY.AND SENTENCED TO LENGTHY

PRISON TERMS. : :

10, THE UNDERLYING CAUSE FOR THE “SHOWTRIAL" OF CUBELA,
THE ARREST OF THE DEPUTY MINISTER OF DEFENSE AND THE OUTLANDISH
GARGES BROUGHT AGAINST MEMBERS OF THE CP AND MINISTERIAL OFFICIALS
ARISES FROM THE IRREVERSIBLE FAILURES OF THE GOVT IN THE HANDLING
OF DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL PROBLEMS. THE SCARCITY OF BASIC
FOOD PRODUCTS HAS WORSENED, RICE, ROOT CROPS, MILK, MEAT CONTINUE
TO BE RATIONED SEVERELY, AND THE AVAILABILITY TO TEE CONSUMER IS

- NOW BELOW THE 1957-59 LEVEL, DESPITE SEVEN YEARS OF “COMMUNIST

PLANNING", THERE ARE SERIOUS SHORTAGES OF MEDICINE, TEXTILES AND
HOUSING, THE LATTER HAS DETERIORATED IN URBAN AREAS TO A LEVEL
FAR BELOW PRE-WAR STANDARDS , SIMILARLY, CASTRO REPORTED THAT THE
SUGAR CROP THIS YEAR WILL FALL FAR BELOW THE SIX MILLION TONS
HARVESTED IN 1968, SINCE SUGAR ACCOUNTS FOR SOME 80%.0F TOTAL
FOREIGN TRADE EARNINGS, 1966 INCOME FROM SUGAR SALES, FACED WITH
DEPRESSED MoRLD MARKET PRICES, WILL NOT IN ANY WAY MEET THE cosT
OF BASIC IMPORTS, ESSENTIAL FoR SUSTAINING THE NATIONAL ECONOMY,
CASTRO HAS SOUGHT TO RELIEVE THE PRESSURE ON THE ECONOMY BY PER-
MITTING THE EXODUS OF SOME 400 REFUGEES PER MONTH WHO ARE STREAMING
