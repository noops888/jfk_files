4. MAJOR CUBELA WAS A POPULAR AND PROMINENT UNIVERSITY

STUDENT LEADER, AN ARDENT REVOLUTIONARY AND ONE OF THE EARLY COHOETS

OF CASTRO DURING THE BATISTA REGINE. CUBELA WAS ALSO A CLOSE

FRIEND OF CASTRO AND UNTIL THE ARREST RANKED RIGH AMONG THE LEADERS

OF THE REGIKE. HIS ARREST AND ABJECT CONFESSION AT THE PUBLIC

TRIAL CONDUCTED IN STALINIST FASHION TRIGGERED OFF A SERIES OF

STUDENT REACTIONS. THE TRIAL IN EFFECT BICKFIRED AGAINST THE REGIME.

•. 5. UPI REPORTS ANT OTHER INTERNATIONAL NEWS SERVICES,

INCLUDING ACCOUNTS OF REFUGEES WHO DEPARTED RECENTLY FROM CUBA,

TESTIFIED TO THE FACT THAT ANTI-GOVT' STUDENT AGITATIONS OCCURRED.

WALL SCRIBBLINGS ON UNIVERSITY BUILDINGS THREATENED CASTRO, ONE

READING: "ONE HEAD PAYS FOR ANOTHER," ANOTHER READ "OUT WITH FIDEL."

6. BECAUSE OF THE STRONG OPPOSITION TO THE TRIAL, CASTRO

REQUESTED THE STATE PROSECUTOR NOT TO INPOSE THE DEATH SENTENCES.

IN ORDER PLACATE ADVERSE PUBLIC OPINION THE TRIAL PROCEEDINGS WERE

GIVEN WIDE COVERAGE ON BOTH RADIO AND TELEVISION CIRCUITS. AS A

7. THE CUBELA TRIAL WAS USED AS A PEG, I.E., GUILT BY

ASSOCIATION IN THE DISMISSAL AND CHARGES LEVIED AGAINST MAJOR

AMEI JEIRAS WHOSE LOYALTY TO THE REVOLUTION IS "UNDISPUTED" BY

CASTRO, HOWEVER, AMEIJEIRAS WAS STRIPPED OF HIS MILITARY RANK

AND CHARGED WITH THE CRIME OF BEING A PINYBOY, LIVING THE CAY LIFE.

8. AMEIJEIRAS WAS ONE OF CASTRO'S FIRSI PEVOLUTIONARY

FOLLOWERS, HE HAD BEEN WITH CASTRO SINCE 1956, WAS ONE OF THE

SURVIVORS OF THE GRANA EXPEDITION, FOUGHT IN THE SIERRA MAESTRA

IN 1957-58 AND HAD HELD HIGH OFFICE SINCE 1959. IN OCT 1965 HE WAS

NAME TO THE HUNDRED MAN CENTRAL CONMITTEE OF THE CUBAN COMMUNIST

PARTY.

9. RUMORS ARE CIRCULATING THAT BLAS ROCA CALDERIO,

MEMBER OF THE SECRETARIAT OF THE CP AND CHAIRMAN OF THE CONSTITU-

TIONAL STUDIES COSMITTEE, WILL SHORTIY BE BROUGHT TO TRIAL.

SIMILARLY, THE CHARGES OF HALPRACTICES AGAINST THE MINISTRY OF

FOREIGN AFFAIRS IMPUGN'S THE LOYALTY OF FOREIGN MINISTER RAUL ROA

GARCIA HINSELF. ANOTHER MINISTER UNDER SUSPICION, I.E., GUILI BY

ASSOCIATION, IS PAURE CHOLON, MINISTER OF TRANSPORTATION. THE

ENTIRE MEMBERSHIP OF THE 100-JAN CENTRAL CONNITTEE CREATED IN LATE

1965, MAY NOT BE SPARED AS THE PURGE GATHERS NOMENTUM.

10. THE UNDERLYING CAUSE FOR THE "SHONTRIAL" OF CUBELA,

THE ARREST OF THE DEPUTY MINISTER OF DEFENSE AND THE OUILANDISH

HARGES BROUGHT AGAINST MEMBERS OF THE CP AND MINISTERIAL OFFICIALS

ARISES FROSS THE IRREVERSIBLE FAILURES OF THE GOVT IN THE HANDLING

OF DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL PROBLESS. THE SCARCITY OF BASIC

FOOD PRODUCTS HAS WORSENED. RICE, ROOT CROPS, MILK, SEAT CONTINUE

TO BE RATIONED SEVERELY, AND THE AVAILABILITY TO THE CONSUNER IS

• NOW BELOW THE 1957-59 LEVEL, DESPITE SEVEN YEARS OF "CONNUNIST

PLANNING", THERE ARE SERIOUS SHORTAGES OF SEDICINE, TEXTILES AND

HOUSING. THE LATTER HAS DETERIORITED IN URBAN AREAS TO A LEVEL

FAR BELONY PRE-VAR STAYDARDS. SIMILARLY, CASTRO REPORTED THAT THE

SUGAR CROP THIS YEAR WILL FALL FAR BELON MIE SIX MILLION TONS

HARVESTED IN 1965. SINCE SUGAR ACCOUNTS FOR SOME 80% OF TOTAL

FOREIGN TRADE EARNINGS, 1966 INCOME FROM SUGAR SALES, FACED WITH

DEPRESSED WORLD MARKET PRICES, WILL NOT IN ANY WAY MEET THE COST

OF BASIC IMPORTS, ESSENTIAL FOR SUSTAIVING THE NATIONAL ECONOMY.

CASTRO HAS SOUGHT TO RELIEVE THE PRESSURE ON THE ECONOMY BY PER-

SITTING THE EXODUS OF SOME 400 REFUGEES PER MONTH REO ARE STREAMING

STAFFS. ALSO, THE POLICY OF REPLACING EXPERIENCED FUNCTIONARIES
