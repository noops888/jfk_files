i NIEVES was reportedly a Captain in the Rebel army under Osmani CiEN-

' FUEGOS and subsequentiy arrested by the DSE in January 1963 for political

i reasons. He was released from prison in 1965 through the intervention of

i his brother, a high Cuban official. NIEVES went to Madrid in April 1965

| where he was introduced to a CIA officer. Ile came to the US in August 1965

j and was again contacted by a CIA officer. The relationship was unsatisfactcr
; as NIEVES proved erratic and uncooperative and he provided fabricated

' information, In March 1966 ACSI (Army) indicated an interest in NIEVES and
was given an assessment of NIEVES. Since the CIA no longer had an interest
in NIEVES, ACSI picked him and subsequently terminated him in March 1967.

| ARTINE was one of the leaders of the Moviméento de Recuperacion

Revoluconario CURR), a democratic Catholic oriented anti-Batista reform
movement which allied itself with the Castro forces in overthrowing Batista.
ARTIME was de facto chief of the agricultural reform program in Oriente Prov-
ince after Batista's fall. ARTIME became disillusioned with Castro, deperted
Cuba and became one of the leaders of the Bay of Pigs invasion force, He was
captured, imprisoned and returned in the prisoner exvhange in 1962. From June
1963 to April 1965, CIA supported ARTIME and the MRR operations against Cuba
which can be broadly characterized as harassment, sabotage and psychological
warfare at a cost of approximately $ seven million, Following that, CIA
supported psychological warfare operations such es radio broadcasts and the
publication of an anti-Castro periodical, This continued until ARTiN= was ter
inated in January 1967, Since that time there has been no cfficial CIA rei-
ationship with ARTIME although there have been occasional unofficial contacts
between CIA officers and ARTIME, These contacts were not of operational sig-
nificance. During the mid-east war ARTIME offered DCI Colby the use’ of himself
ang his men in any capacity that would assist the Agency. ARTINE was last rep

CUBELA had been the second in command of the Directorio Revoluc-
icnario, an anti-fatista student organization which was actively involved +
with Castro's forces in the overthrow of the Batista government. CUAEKLA sub-
sehvently held the rank of Major in Castro's forces but became disillusioned
with Castro and communism, CUBELA was initially met in Mexico in March 1961
but the meeting was without operational significance. In 196%, foldowing
reports that Cubela. was considering defecting, an attempt was made to det
hip state of mind by utilizing a Cuban refukee who met @4b/ CUBELA-in Scan-
dihavia. CUKELA agreed to work in place for the creation of a new Cuba. In
Ockober 1963, as a result of CUBELA'S demand to meet U.S. Astorney General,

5 April 1977 -
SUBJECT: Intelligence Sources and Methods -

1. The principle of protection fd intelligence sources and
methods is central to the viability of clandestine operations. The
inability to protect intelligence sources and methods will be de-
structive of the credibility of the Agency in dealing with its
clandestine assets, and in dealing with intelligence services around
the world to whom our security is already a matter of grave concern.

2. The tragedy.of Cuba won the support of the United States
Government for the programs to free that country from its dictatorship.
It was the sense of the American people and of the United States Govern-
ment, in both the executive and legislative branches, to find-a way to
t the Castro regime. However badly conceived different parts of the
ram, and whatever the chances of success, the fact is that the
mate objectives met the highest standards of American ideals.

3.. There were a lot of Cubans who worked with the Americans :to
free Cuba. They carried their plans to desperate extremes, risking
their lives at the Bay of Pigs and in hundreds of smaller incursions.
Some were associated with scheming to assassinate Castro himself. Some
did this on their own as. patriots and some, also as. patriots, did it
with the support of representatives of the United States Government.
Right or wrong the identity of those people constitute a trust of the
American Government. If betrayed it would be a breach of honor and a
demonstration to our allies today, and to those individuals around the
world who work with us, that they must review the risk they take in our
association.

4. The protection of intelligence sources is more than a dry Tegal
Pirase. Tl invulves @ mural commitment to protect tnose who agree to
work with us. This is an essential principle to be observed by any
organization that expects to involve itself.in clandestine operations
of any sort.


Co (

Our letter to the Attorney General of 14 October 1976
forwarded all information from Agency files responsive to
these questions which we judged could be forwarded to the
Dade County police without jeopardizing sources or methods,

rovided the Attorney General found that the Agency could

egally do so. A second point, also to follow from the
Attorney General's findings was that, even if such informa-
tion could legally be provided, a determination would have

to be made within the Agency whether some of the requested
information which related to former or current agents of the
Agency might still require protection. Your marginal comment
asks whether we are not straining the concept of protection
of sources when we protect those who are not now intelligence
sources and whether we are protecting them from prosecution
for terrorist activity today.

After referent memorandum was sent to you, the Attorney
General refined an earlier opinion from former Assistant
Attorney General Antonin Scalia. The Department of Justice
now concludes that, to the extent Agency information either
does not involve U.S. persons or falls within one of seven
exceptions to the general prohibition against collection of
information concerning the domestic activities of U.S. persons,
such information can be provided to local police authorities.
It is significant, however, that the Attorney General in his
23 March letter to you (Attachment B) expressly included the
following language:

In addition to the facts above, the Office of
Legal Counsel has pointed out that Executive Order
11905 does not require CIA to respond to Dade County.
Indeed, the responsibility of the Director of Central
Intelligence to protect sources and methods of intelli-

gence, established by statute, 50 U.S.C. #403(g),
and E.O. 11905, Section 3(d) (vii), is authority for
him to withhold such information from local law
enforcement officials if he believes its disclosure

would threaten the security of intelligence sources
or methods. (Emphasis added)

In the light of the Attorney General's opinion, those
offies holding the relevant files are now reviewing them to
confirm that the information originally selected for passage
to Dade County law enforcement officials is responsive and
complete.
