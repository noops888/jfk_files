SU"JECT: Melay insending the first cable about
OSWALD

1. Much has been written about the dela (ty the Mexico
Station) ins ending the first cable requesting traces on the
name Lee OSWALD. It was discussed in Dave Phillips book a a
case of laziness on the part of the Soviet case officer (which
in my view was unjust and unnecessary and indicates that Dave
didn't know what he was’ talking about).

2. Normally, the Spanish transcript for the 1 Octob
convers ation would have been picked up on the morning 6
2nd of October. ‘The Russian language portion would Thave.gbne
to the Russ ian/English tramscriber on the 3rd ofOctober. ‘he
trans lation would have been returned the follaWing day (4th)
at which time, the Soviet case officer woyhd have~a ked for
the photographic coverage. ‘That coveraag woes not have been
in the station before the 7th s ince was still in the
camera on the 3rd of October and en peked up probably on |
the 4th, processed and passed vexStation on the next work
da which would have been M LOctober.

3. Later the film was en out of the camera every day
but at that time, the films tayed in the camera until a full 5
rotl was completed which might take three or four dys.

4. A name trace could have been requested on the bas is
of the name alone but that wasn't the way Win Scott ran that
Station. He wanted the photographic coverage tied in with the
telephone coverage...s ometimes_there_was a U.S. automobile
license number. It was also part of the "numbers game" of so
justify ing a project ty the number of dis patches, cables or
Teports produced.

Mexico Station Coverage of Soviet and Cuban Embassies (1953)

1. Unilateral Coverage:
From the time the Mexico Station was opened in April 1947 ‘untit

the arrival of Mr. Win Scott as Chief of Station in 1955, the Station had

developed a support apparatus to exploit leads from the Soviet Embassy in
7 Mexico City. This umbrella type project carsigyesed of multiline
phone taps, three photographic sites, a aor team and a

mail intercept operation.

4 Telephone taps ue ae gon by an employee of the Tocal

Ea telephone company wi ‘ed by a Station case officer. The number |

of lines tapped wa! oF only by the availability of a listening post
nearby and the availability of langauge (English, Spanish, Soviet, Polish,
Czech, etc.) transcribers. Generally, these were Mexican or Mexican-
American recruited agents.
Three photographic sites were handled by a Station case officer

+ assisted by technicians on TDY from Headquarters who advised the Station
on the best’.types of cameras, films, and concealment devices. These
operations ‘had sub-crypts under’ project LIPSTICK (namely: LIMITED, LILYRIC
and LICALLA). LIMITED was a fixed site directly opposite the Soviet Em-
bassy (across the street) which had both a vehicle and a pedestrian en-

trance. The gate to the Soviet Embassy was on the northwest corner of the

Soviet compound and the LIMITED site was diagonally across a double laned

street on the southeast corner of that block. (See attached diagram)

LIMITED was the first photo base and operated strictly on an experimental

basis in the early stages. This base, however, was closed when the Sta~
tion received word that the photograph of the “unidentified man" was
being released by the Warren Commission. LILYRIC was an alternate photo-
graphic base. It was located in an upper story of an apartment building
on the same side of the street as the LIMITED site mweye middle of

RCN
the block south. It had a planted view of cS ite of the Soviet

Embassy. LICALLA, the third photograph a
iy
row of four houses on the sou gO Re Soviet Embassy compound.

This site overlooked the, len of the Soviet Embassy compound. The
purpose of this one SS s to get good identification photographs of

Soviet personnel. The three photographic sites were managed by a re-

jas located in one of a

cruited agent who was a Nexican citizen, the son of an American mother
and Mexican father (deceased). This agent collected the film from the
LIMITED and LILYRIC sites three times a week. The film was then de-
veloped and printed into 8 x 10 contact print strips. LICALLA film was
originally processed in the Station but in early 1959, due to the resig-
nation of a technician, this film like that of LIMITED and LILYRIC was

processed on the outside by a.recruited agent. =

Mobile surveillance was conducted by two American staff officers.
These two officers organized a surveillance team of six recruited agents
which used late model cars and a panel truck for surveillance. The team
could be activated by radio from the LIMITED site whenever. someone of
interest. left the gate of the Soviet Embassy. These agents were aware of
the LIMITED site since they had been issued LIMITED photographs for
identification purposes.

The Station also conducted a unilateral sy ept operation,
LIBIGHT, which was handled by an American s er. A recruited
Mexican agent, who had a senittctl aa tained selected letters
from a subagent employed by the, ie Raepbstal system.

2. Liaison Coverage ge
Liaison a unreliable and insecure as characterized by

the nature of the Mexican services at that time. The Mexican Direction

of Federal Security (DFS), with which we conducted liaison, was a hip- i
pocket group run out of the Mexican Ministry of Government. This-Ministry
was principally occupied with political investigations and control of
foreigners. Their, agents were wiecbcetel | and corrupt. A Station ;
officer trained a number of them in nane tracing and travel contro}. In

1958, at ‘the instigation of a Mexican official, a joint telephone tap

operation came into existence. The operation, which became known as

LIENVOY, was run by a Mexican officer. The listening post had 30 lines
connected at one time. The transcription room was staffed by Mexican

Army officers. In 1961, because. of mismanagement by the Mexican prin-
cipals, the Station chief, himself, became the project case officer. A

Station officer assisted him in the daily supervision of the listening

post, and in picking up the transcripts and the tapes. There was also

an American technician inside the listening post.

3. Oswald Coverage: .
In mid-1962, the Mexican officer in charge of LIENVOY (the ' |

joint tap operation) asked the American officer at Pay listening

post for the telephone numbers of the Soviet, Cub: Ge: rite En-

disconnected al] of the unilateral or

that they would not be disc: ANd Mexicans hooked up their

taps. The Mexicans aS ‘ter connected five Cuban lines, five
Soviet lines, three Czech lines, two Polish lines, and one Yugoslav
line. At the listening post, a live monitor made short summaries of
conversations of interest which were. then included in a daily resume
for the Chief of Station. Later, when a reel was completely recorded,
full transcripts were, typed and passed to the Station; however, there

was usually a time lag of a day or two. Reels which contained Russian

ey a language other than Spanish or English were taken to another location
for translation and typing. Mr. Boris Tarasoff did. the Russian transla-
tions but because of the volume of Russian conversations, the translations
usually ran about a week behind the date of the conversation.

As soon as the Station learned that an American identifying hin-
self as Lee Oswald phoned the Soviet Embassy, Miss Ann Goodpasture of the
Station started screening al] photographs. However, here Bs » there

was a backlog because the photographs were picked up Sens a week

Further, photographs were not mei until a complete roll of

at the end of each day st of amount of unused film remaining. |
The instructions were to cover the entire work-day (office hours) and to
photograph all Soviets, their families, all foreigners, and cars with
foreign license plates. Human error did occur but generally the agents

+ were conscientious. The Cuban Embassy coverage had more ‘sophisticated
equipment using a pulse camera which frequently developed mechanical dif-
ficulties.

Oswald came to the attention of the listening post operators

from a tap of the Soviet line. It was picked up and taken to Mr. Boris

There was some delay because Station personne] waited to compare the
photographs with the typed transcript. All transcripts were made in
either Spanish or English since the Chief of Station could read only

these two languages and because he personally screened the transcripts

for operational leads.

coasisted of multi line phone taps, three photo sites, a mobile surveillance
team and a mail intercept operation.

27 September 1963, Sovict Embassy Chancery 15-61-55

Item 295, page 3

At 1626 hours, A Soviet calls from the Soviet Embassy Chancery
to the Cuban Consulate and asks for Sylvia DURAN. He asks’

DURAN if the american has been there.

DURAN: Yes, he is still here.

SOVIET: According to the letters that he showed them from the (Soviet)
Consulate in Washington, he wants’ to go to the USSR to stay
a long time with his wife who is Russian, but also the
answer ‘had not been received (by him) regarding his problem.
That accordingly these transactions take 4 or 5 months but
without prior approval from the USSR, they have to request
and even then, they could not issue the visa hese (in Mexico
City) without asking Washington. Yet accordingly * this man
(the American) » + Showed him a letter iy
American) is a member of an organizatioh;ii.favor of Cuba
and said that the Cubans could noes ‘hint the visa without
the Russian visa and now pars
with him, because he Ls
Washington.

ith them also, b Spten with him (the Anerican)

“is that he doesnt} sSanyons in Cuba and in that case it
is very ce We hin a visa, because he was

Ste

thinking of § sing his visa, because he knew it was
going to take s'fong time waiting for the Russian visa in
Guba, and then go on to the USSR.

SOVIET: ..that the thing is that if his (the American) wife were

~” now in Washington (and) going to receive the visa right now

or the permission from the USSR to return to her country, (if)
she is going to receive her visa in Washington, then having
this visa, she can communicate to whatever place, this
permission, for example, here or in any other place (he) can
receive it, but right now they do not have them.

DURAN: ..certainly and neither can (the Cubans) give him a letter
because they do not know if the visa will be approved.

SOVIET: They can only give the visa according to instructions.

DURAN: Then that is what she will put on his application.

SOVIET: Neither can I give him any letter of recommendation because
I don't know him and pardon me for bothering you.

DURAN: It.was no bother, thank you very much.

27 September 1963, Soviet Embassy Consulate 15-60-55

+ Heom 395, pages 7 and 8 % y

Item 74, page 2

én unidentified man (speaking Spanish) calls the Soviet Embassy
Consulate at 1037 hours and asks for the Consul. He is told that
the Consul is not there. The unidentified man asked what is needed
to get visas to go to Odessa. He is told to call back at 1130 hours.

Item 137, page 2

At 1235 hours a man named ALATRISTE (not a Soviet) from inside the
Soviet Embassy Consulate calls out to number 45-37-72 (Colonial
America, probably a pension or hotel but number not listed in the
telephone directory) and speaks with a man named SAN ROMAN.
ALATRISTE says that he is in the Russian Embassy and they need to
know what day the boat "'KALONIA" will arrive in Odessa, that the
Soviets will also need copies of the passenger manifest

(One concludes that ALATRISTE and SAN ROMAN are shipping-tepresentatives
for the boat "KALONIA", and needed routine visa infonmation, First

a call was made to the first listing for the Soviet. Embassy in the
Mexican telephone directory (which turned out=t0 be: the Military Attache).
They got the phone number for the Consulate atidthe address. After
making a call to the Consulate and learmingy that it would not be open
until 1130 hours, ALATRISTE went. +@ thé: address to get the needed
information.)

Just after 1600 hours, ‘the Soviet Consulate received a call from the
Cuban Consulate (Sylvia DURAN) who said she had there a U.S. citizen
who had requested a transit visa to Cuba because he is going to the
USSR. DURAN wants to know with whom he spoke at the Soviet Embassy
because she sent him over to them telling him that if the Soviets
approved the visa then the Cubans would give him one without anything
more, advising the (Department of) Immigration in Cuba.: She wants

to know with whom he spoke because he says that he doesn't know
either with what person and who told him that certainly there would
be no problem.’ The Soviet asks DURAN to wait a minute. After a
short wait DURAN explains the same thing to another Soviet. ‘This
Soviet tells her to leave her telephone (number) and her name and
someone will retum the call. DURAN gives her name and telephone
number 11-28-47 then says as a personal thing, she has moved and

has not advised them of a change of address so will not receive their
Bulletin and can give it to them now. The Soviet asks her to call
KOUKHARENKO in order to change that address and asks for the name

of the (Cuban) Cultural Attache. DURAN says it is Teresa PROENZA
whose number is 14-13-26. The Soviet thanks her.

Dear Dick: = : ao

DEPARTMENT OF STATE
THE DIRECTOR OF INTELLIGENCE AND RESEARCH
WASHINGTON

Our efforts to answer recent informal inquiries, including some

from the White House Staff, nave revealed that, though CIA and the

FHI have detailed. records concerning Americans who have been recruited
as intelligence agents by Bloc countries, there does not appear to be

a complete listing of those Americans now living in Bloc countries

who might be called "dezectors". Using the definitions of DCID h/2,

these. persons might be described as those who have either been

capable of providing useful intelligence to the Bloc or those whose

desire to resettle in Bloc countries has been significantly exploited “:
for communist propaganda purposes, This would mean that no attention :
need be paid to Anericans whose resettlement within the Bloc had no
counter-intelligence implications or had attracted no particular
attention; for instance, this definition would not cover individual
US citizens of East European or Chinese origin who retumed to the
"homeland" because they had never been completely assimilated into

There is attached a list of such persons, covering the lest 18
months, and it would be appreciated if the Agency could verify and
possibly expand this Mist for the use of interested Burems of, the
Department. :

Sincerely yours, 5 “ro
