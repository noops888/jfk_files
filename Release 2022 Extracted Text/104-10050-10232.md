Delay in sending the first cable about

1.

Much has been written about the delay (by the Mexico

Station) ins ending the first cable reques ting traces on the

name

Lee OSWALD.

It was dis cuss ed in

Dave Phillip

book as

case of laziness on

view was

unjust

the part of the Soviet case officer (which

unnecess ary

and indicates that Dave

didn't know what he

was talking about).

convers ation would have been picked up on

the Spanish trans cript for the 1 october

The Russian language portion would have gone

to the Russian/English transcriber on the the of October.

The

translation would have been returned the follawing day

(4th )

at which time,

the Soviet case officer would have as ked for

the photographic coverage.

That coverage would not have been

would have been Maniay

october.

Later the film was taken out of the camera every day

but at that time,

the film stayed in the camera until a

full

roil was completed which might take three or four days.

4.

A name trace could have been reques ted on the bas is

of the name alone but that wasn't the way Win Scott ran that

Station.

He wanted the photographic coverage tied in with the

telephone coverage:..sometimes there was a U.S. automobile

licens e number.

It was also part of the "numbers

game" of

justifying a project by the number of dis patches, cables or

reports produced.

Mexico Station Coverage of Soviet and Cuban Embassies (1963)

:.:

1. Unilateral Coverage:

From the time the Mexico Station was opened in April 1947 until

the arrival of Mr. Win Scott as Chief of Station in 1955, the Station had

developed a support apparatus to exploit leads from the Soviet Embassy in

Mexico City. This umbrella type project (LIPSTICK)

Sisted of multiline

phone taps, three photographic sites, a mobite

surveillance team and a

mail intercept operation.

Telephone taps (LIFEAT)

placed y an employee of the local

telephone company who

landied by a Station case officer. The number

of lines tapped

wa

intited only by the availability of a listening post

nearby and the availability of langauge (English, Spanish, Soviet, Polish,

Czech, etc.) transcribers. Generally, these were Mexican or Mexican-

American recruited agents.

Three photographic sites were handled by a Station case officer

• assisted by technicians on TDY from Headquarters who advised the Station

on the best types of cameras, films, and concealment devices. These

operations had sub-crypts under project LIPSTICK (namely: LIMITED, LILYRIC

and LICALLA): LIMITED was a fixed site directly opposite the Soviet Em-

bassy (across the

street) which had both a vehicle and a pedestrian en-

trance. The gate to the Soviet Embassy was on the northwest corner of the

Soviet compound and the LIMITED site was diagonally across a double laned

street on the southeast corner of that block. (See attached diagram).

LIMITED was the first photo base and operated strictly on an experimental

basis in the early stages. This base, however, was closed when the Sta-

tion received word that the photograph of the "unidentified man" was

being released by the Warren Commission. LILYRIC was an alternate photo-

graphic base. It was located in an upper story of an apartment building

on the same side of the street as the LIMITED site bu

the middle of

gate of the Soviet

the block south. It had a planted view of the

Embassy. LICALLA, the third photograph

was located in one of a

row of four houses on the south

@the Soviet Embassy compound.

This site overlooked the

arden of the Soviet Embassy compound. The

purpose of this operati

anawas to get good identification photographs of

Soviet personnel. The three photographic sites were managed by a re-.

cruited agent who was a Mexican citizen, the son of an American mother

and Mexican father (deceased). This agent collected the film from the

LIMITED and LILYRIC sites three times a week. The film was then de-

veloped and printed into 8 x 10 contact print strips. LICALLA film was

originally processed in the Station but in early 1959, due to the resig-

nation of a technician, this film like that of LIMITED and LILYRIC was

processed on the outside by a recruited agent.

Mobile surveillance was conducted by two American staff officers.

These two officers organized a surveillance team of six recruited agents

which used late model cars and a panel truck for surveillance. The team

could be activated by radio from the LIMITED site whenever someone of

interest. left the gate of the Soviet Embassy. These agents were aware of

the LIMITED site since they had been issued LIMITED photographs for

identification purposes.

The Station also conducted a unilateral

the nature of the Mexican services at that time. The Mexican Direction

of Federal Security (DFS), with which we conducted liaison, was a hip-

pocket group run out of the Mexican Ministry of Government. This Ministry

was principally occupied with political investigations and control of

foreigners. Their agents were wartet, and corrupt. A station

officer trained a number of them in name tracing and travel control. In

1958, at the instigation of a Mexican official, a joint telephone tap

operation came into existence.

connected at one time. The transcription room was staffed by Mexican

Army officers. In 1961, because. öf mismanagement by the Mexican prin-

cipals, the Station chief, himself, became the project case officer. A

Station officer assisted him in the daily supervision of the listening

post, and in picking up the transcripts and the tapes.

There was

also

an American technician inside the listening post.

3. Oswald Coverage:

joint tap operation) asked the American officer at the LENVOY listening

conversations of interest which were then included in a daily resume

for the Chief of Station. Later, when a reel was completely recorded,

full transcripts were typed and passed to the Station; however, there

was usually a time lag of a day or two. Reels which contained Russian

for the telephone nunbers of the Soviet, Cuban, and Satellite Ebassies.

With this forevarning, LIFEAT (unilateral coverage) was disconnected.

However,

as I recall, the Mexicans connected 5 Cuban lines, 5 Soviet lines, 3 Czech,

2 Polish,

and 1 lugoslav line. The baserouse listening post had a live

nonitor to made short summaries of interesting conversations for a daily

resume which was received each day arourd 8 a.t. (passed by Flick to Goodcasture

to get to Scott before 9.a.iI.) Later (when the reel was

completely recorded)

full transcripts vere typed and passed to the station in the

same way, however,

there was usually a time lag of a day or so. Those transcripts which rad

Russian or another language besides Spanish or English went

out

of the listening

post the day after the transcript (of other conversations.on the reel)was

typed.

These reels were taken to another location Mier

they were translated

Section or they may.

have been carried to him by Flick but I think I brought the reel in and gave

it to Herbert Manell to take to Boris.

Herbert Manell and his wife Barbara

handled all of the processi:g of Soviet transcripts. Hy job involved screening

the photographs as soon as we learned that the man calling hinself Oswald was

probably an Americen. However, here again there was a backlag because the

photos were picked up three times a week but the ones ricked up were usually

for dates a few days previously because the doctor processed the film on a

night time basis. Photographs were made usually until one roll vas used but

later we got it changed to one day coverage on each roll - in other words the

operetors, cleared the ca"era each day whetrer there was anglince a full

roll of film exposed.

error did oscur but generally the agents were conscientious. The Cuban

embassy coverage had more sophisticatea equipient (a pulse ca:era) but it

frequently develored rechanical difficulties. Bob Zambarnardi and Scathar

(I think) handled this film - pick up and delivery. Lorna l'ackay screered

the film inside the station.

I am certain that the Oswald call came to our attention from the

Soviet line. It was picked u; and taken to Boris for a translation because

the caller was trying to speak Russian. Any delay vas caused by waiting to

compare the photographs with the typed transcript.. There were no copies of

transcripts every nade in languages other than Spanish or

At 1626 hours, A Soviet calls from the Soviet Embassy Chancery

the Cuban Consulate and asks for Sylvia DURAN. He asks

DURAN if the american has been there.

DURAN: Yes, he is still here.

According

the letters that he showed them from the (Soviet)

Consulate in Washington, he wants to go to the USSR to stay

a long time with his wife who is Russian, but also the

answer had not been received (by him) regarding his problem.

That accordingly these transactions take 4 or 5 months but

without prior approval from the USSR,

they have to request

asking Washington.

Yet accordingly

and said that the Cubans could not give him the visa without

the Russian visa and now the Saiet doesn't know what to do

is that he

doesn't wanyone in Cuba and in that case it

It to, give him a visa,

thinking of

going to take a long

..that the thing is that if his (the American) wife were

now in Washington (and) going to receive the visa right now

She is going to receive her visa in Washington, then having

this visa, she can communicate to whatever place, this

27 September 1963, Soviet Embassy Consulate 15-60-55

Item 74, page 2

An unidentified man (speaking Spanish) calls the Soviet Embassy

Consulate at 1037 hours and asks for

the Consul.

He is told that

the Consul is not there.

The unidentified man asked what is needed

to get visas to go to Odessa. He is told to call back at 1130 hours.

Item 137, page 2

At 1235 hours a man named ALATRISTE (not a Soviet)

from inside the

Soviet Embassy Consulate calls out to number 45-37-72 (Colonial

America, probably a pension or hotel but number not listed in the

telephone directory) and speaks with a man named SAN ROMAN.

ALATRISTE says that he is in the Russian Embassy and they need to

know what day the boat "KALONIA" will arrive in Odessa, that the

Soviets will also need copies of the passenger manifest....

(One concludes that ALATRISTE and SAN ROMAN are shipping-representatives

for the boat "KALONIA"', and needed routine visa information, First

a call was made to the first listing for the Soviet Embassy in the

Mexican telephone directory (which turned outsto be the Military Attache).

They got the phone number for the Consulate and the address.

making a call

to the Consulate and learning that it would not be open

until 1130 hours, ALATRISTE went ta the address to get the needed

information.)

• Item 395, pages 7 and 8

Just after 1600 hours,

he Soviet Consulate received a call from the

Cuban Consulate (Sylvia DURAN)

who said she had there a U.S. citizen

who had requested a transit visa to Cuba because he is going to the

USSR. DURAN wants to know with whom he spoke at the Soviet Embassy

because she sent him over to them telling him that if the Soviets

approved the visa then the Cubans would give him one without anything

more,

advising the (Department of) Immigration in Cuba. She wants

to know with whom he spoke because he says that he doesn't know

either with what person and who told him that certainly there would

be no problem.

The Soviet asks DURAN to wait a minute.

After a

short wait DURAN explains the same thing to another Soviet.

This

Soviet tells her to leave her telephone (number)

and her name and

someone will return the call.

DURAN gives her nane and telephone

number 11-28-47 then says as a personal thing, she has moved and

has not advised them of a change of address so will not receive their

Bulletin and can give it to them now.

The Soviet asks her to call

KOUKHARENKO in order to change that address and asks for the name

of the (Cuban) Cultural Attache. DURAN says it is Teresa PROENZA

whose number is 14-13-26.

The Soviet thanks her.

THE DIRECTOR OF INTELLIGENCE AND RESEARCH

WASHINGTON

SECRET

OCT 25 1960

Dear Dicks

Our efforts to answer recent informal inquiries, including some

from the White

House Staff, have revealed that, though CIA and the

FET have detailed records concerning Americans who have been recruited

as Intelligence agents by Bloc countries, there does not appear to be

a complete listing of those Americans now Living in Bloc countries

who might be called "defectors".

Using the definitions of DID 4/2,

these persons might be described as those who have either been

capable of providing useful intelligence to the Bloc or those whose

desire to resettle in Bloc countries has been significantly exploited

for communist propaganda purposes.

This would mean that no attention

need be paid to Americans whose resettlement within the Bloc had no

counter-intelligence implications or had attracted no particular

attention; for instance, this definition rould not cover individual

US citizens of East European or Chinese origin who retumed to the

"homeland" because they had never been completely assimilated into

the American society.

There is attached a list of such persons, covering the last 18

months, and it would be appreciated if the Agency could verify and

possibly expand thia list for the use of interested Bureaus of, the

Department.

Sincerely yours,

Hugh S. Cunning, JI..

Talechone Conversation vetween Mr. O'Neal and Mr. Papich at 0915, 27 November 1963

Mr. Papich: On questions A, B, C, D - he was not questioned on any of those.

we have been told the soldeo didn t'and de finally got access to hir

ead suel, so those questione we never coveredo

We weren't given

authority to nove in until friday so those questions were not covered.

With regard to E - Mrs., Paine, etc., we are working on that.

E - we have some Information for you on that indicating communication

between him and the Embassy up there.

The wife is being interrogated. I don't baos if that took place yesterds

or is still going on. You are getting a teletyye answer on that. I am

just giving you a previer.

With regard to that, Nicaraguan's; allegations that the man was in the

Cuban Embassy on 18 Septenber, I understand we do have information that

he applied for a tourist card about the ISth of Segtember. There

is

record showing entry into Mexico on Septenber 26. On about the 15th be

applied in New Orleans for a tourist card.

We do know he was in -

I may even have some later Informätion which came in during the rigat -

As you know, he was in lem arleans

the, a5tk when the family left.

sis, O'seal: De left there thel

day

P.

; He was seen ontbe

25t

and the landlady said he skipped during the night.

He was last seen by the landlady

Ben.

Now we have immigration records snowing him

entering Mexico on the 26th which very strongly suggests

that be was not in Mexico

on the l8th.

What we are trying to find out is where he

was every single day-

the 25th, 24th, and all the way back.

Soviet. She says that in the Cuban Embassy there is a North

American who was at the Sovfet Embassy. The Soviet says wait a

minute.

Silvia DURAN speaks English with someone - and comments

in Spanish that they gave APARICIO telephone 14-12-99 and to take

the number down - Silvia DURAN then says the American citizen

is

going to talk with you, i.e., the Soviet. The American first

speaks Russian and the Soviet speaks English. They continue in

English. The American talks broken Russian and says I was in

your Embassy and spoke to your Consul. Just a minute. A Soviet

takes the phone and asks the American in English what does he want?

The American says please speak Russian. The Russian says what else

do you want? The American says I was just now at your Embassy and

they took my address. The Soviet says I know that. The American,

in hardly recognizable Russian, says I did not know it then. I

went to the Cuban Embassy to ask them for my address, because they

have it. The Soviet says why don't you come again and leave your

address with us, it is not far from the Cuban Embassy. The Ameri-

can says I'll be there right away.
