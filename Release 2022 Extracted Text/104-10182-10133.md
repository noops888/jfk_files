SSATION

1. I phoned Subject at his hotel on 8 Jaly at 1100 as we had pre-
arranged to dsaaagh another meeting vith hin, I told hin that it would
only take about ar hour, or an hour and 4 half and then he would be free
to return to his hone. :

2. when I arriygd I told hin that after looking over the situation

Ftd DA ony

and consulting with iy superiors isctminhermsscnied for obvious reasons

the United States would not support any revolutionary activities by Gea.
Pedraza, I also said that the United States will observ its international
obligations concerning Cuba and Pedraza, and that the United States would
not overlook any violations by Pedraza or his followers of the neutrality
laws.

3. I said that we had some interest in the possibility of his
working for us as an intelligence gatherer under terms to be negotiated
after we obtained a current security clearance on hin. I pointed out
that ve were not attenpting to Limit his action in connection with the
Bohan Republic} nor vere we assuming any responsibility for those
matters he carries oat in his own behalf. I stressed the need for
security and discipline should he work for us, pointing out thet he may

be asked to do things which we cannct fully explain to him becmse of

the need for security. He said he understood this perfectly. I dictated

the attached Secrecy Agreenent to him and had him sign it.

he Thad taken vith me a PRG Pert 1 fora and obtained the

necessary data,

S. If his statenents concerning previous enoleynent are correct,
his working history shous a’ eye on taking HY risks and svttching
emloynent frequently. He appears to be basically a promoter in the
Public Relations and Advertising “field. In 1957, the firm Mitchell
YER EELL, Inc., Atlanta, Oeergia, engaged in public relations and
advertising, vent throigh bankruptey. Ne has since been self-employed
Primarily as a consultant in the public relations and advertising field,
He 4s 0
660 Ast Ave., New York. Judging from the sddress, I quest ong the
strengtt of this tirmaat Although Subsect elaine to be « Vice President
of it, he adritted thet he is employed on a comissioreff basis and has

connected with a firm called world Wide Information Services,

had no earnings since January 1959, He said the reason for his failure
been involved in the

to make AX money during this period is that he
transacttong/rent tones in ny earlier neroranduy) fee the exchange of Cudan
esos, which were largely unsuccessful,

6. I had asked Subject to write out in detail 23 much as possible
of the story he had given me on 6 duly, but he had failed to do so. ie
wanted to know whether the United States Covernnent vas going to do any-
thing about what he called the serious Communist crisis in Cuba. I

i told him that the United Stctzs could handle the matter in its own way
aad ax ov tine and that for obvious reasons of Fecurity I could not go

h hin unless he were Specifically

inte any detatl on any of these matters

to be charged with a given aation.


oN ‘ Sena rior

7. Subsect said that he had Called the head of ¥orid hide Information
Services, Richard «. Hzbell, since he was in Washington anyway and proposed
to go to New York to see hin. ' He said while Me was in New York he would

attenst to contact Loos (See my mencrandua of 7 July) and learn more of the

“alleged 1,00) availabie Cerrans.. I told-him that I neither approved or

disappreved his taking this action at this time but if he did, I would
appreciate hearing the results of it. : :

@, Subject said that he feels he should return to_the Dominican
Republic as soon as possible and asked if we vere willing to finance such
atrip. Itoid him it wuld de necessary to get hic clearance before
doing so, and that he vould hear fron us in a week to 10 days.

9. My secand interview with Subject gave me a more unfavorable
opinion than before. While obviously capable, I get the inpression that
Subject is such a big "wheeler and dealertgthat he has failed in business

despite considerstle ability, initiative and energy. I recomnend that

mo use be wade of him until such time that a very carefiil covert inveati-
gation of his background and activities have been made; that if security

approval is obtained, he initially be hired under a short tern contract

” for testing purvoses and only after careful testing and evaluation should

he be considered for long term contract employment.
