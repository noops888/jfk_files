Synopsis: LA ROCCA has remained in the Pittsburgh-Ingomar,

This document contains neither recommendations nor conclusions of the FBI.

Pa., vicinity since his return. from Bel Aire, Fla., during
early April, 1964. Neighbors have observed him daily, wandering
around extensive property and bicycle-riding in apparent
effort to lose weight. Bel Aire residence has been closed,
but Johnstown, Pa., racketeer,. JOSEPH REGINO, continues to
live several doors away on semi-permanent basis. Informants
have observed LA ROCCA in downtown Pittsburgh area simply
"putting in an appearance" and keeping in touch with his
various interests. Recent information relating to associates
engaged in racketeering activities and other acquaintances

in the Miami area reviewed. Data pertaining to the identities
of Pittsburgh "family" members provided by informant, who
acknowledges that LA ROCCA is still in control of " "syndicate
operations. This informant believes four families ruled

by LA ROCCA, GABRIEL MANNARINO, FRANK AMATO, and ANTONIO
RIPEPI make up the Greater Pittsburgh Area, and that chief
lieutenants in these families are MIKE GENOVESE, THOMAS
CIANCUTTI, JOSEPH SICA, and JOHN BAZZANO, respectively.

Other matters concerning personal history, illegal activities
and legitimate enterprises set forth. IN VIEW OF THE CON-
VICTION OF LA ROCCA FOR ASSAULT WITH INTENT TO KIDD AND_HIS

ever.operated a bicycle before and that his exercise had
been under taken in an apparent effort to lose weight.

Both Mrs. BROWNLEE and Mrs. REDDER observed that visitors

to the LA ROCCA residence throughout the early months of

the summer have: been scarce. Neither have observed anything
out of the ordinary during the period covered by this report.
No unusual visitors have been at the residence and there have

. been no large congregations of eke ad at any time, according
* to the women.

Il. . Other Matters Relating to Personal History and the
Current Welfare of LA ROCCA and his Relatives

PG “g-1 has, advised that LA ROCCA has continued to
remain in the Pittsburgh-Ingomar, Pa., area and has not
returned to Florida since his return home during the second

“week of April, 1964. A mutual acquaintance has observed

LA ROCCA in the.vicinity of the Mikfon Jewelry Store,

“located in the Shady Side Section of Pittsburgh, on at least“!

two occasions. Heretofore, LA ROCCA had not been ulead to
spend any time in that specific area.

The aforementioned informant.:: has heard rumors

to the effect that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) at

Pittsburgh is again endeavoring to "make a big case" involving
LA ROCCA but cannot bring it to court until more expenditures
are uncovered. He said LA ROCCA"knows this, and his former
daughter-in-law has been instructed by him not to talk to
Federal investigators. He seems to be jockeying with his ~
ereditors so that payments can be "spread out" over several’
years time. All payments, wherever possible, are made in
cash.

This informant has advised that LA ROCCA still
leaves his Ingomar, Pa., residence daily as though he had
a position which entailed punching::a clock or reporting
to a superior. He. enjoys visiting different locations in
whith he has an interest and simply wants to put in an
appearance so that underlings and possible opposition-type
individuals continue to realize that he is in good health,
has an interest in various projects, and !is completely
available. He utilizes his Cadillac for appearances and
