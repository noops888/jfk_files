ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED

HEREIN IS UNCLASSIFIED

DATE 8/13/94 BYSPOMA

Character:

ANTI-RACKETEERING

Synopsis:

LA ROCCA has remained in the Pittsburgh-Ingomar,

Pa., vicinity since his return from Bel Aire, Fla., during

early April, 1964.

Neighbors have observed him daily, wandering

around extensive property and bicycle-riding in apparent

effort to lose weight.

Bel Aire residence has been closed,

but Johnstown, Pa., racketeer, JOSEPH REGINO, continues to

live several doors away on semi-permanent basis. Informants

have observed LA ROCCA in downtown Pittsburgh area simply

"putting in an appearance" and keeping in touch with his

various interests.

Recent information relating to associates

engaged in racketeering activities and other acquaintances

in the Miami area reviewed. Data pertaining to the identities

of Pittsburgh "family" members provided by informant, who

acknowledges that LA ROCCA 1s still in control of "syndicate

operations.

This informant believes four families ruled

by LA ROCCA, GABRIEL MANNARINO, FRANK AMATO, and ANTONIO

RIPEPI make up the Greater Pittsburgh Area, and that chief

lieutenants in these families are MIKE GENOVESE, THOMAS

CIANCUTTI, JOSEPH SICA, and JOHN BAZZANO, respectively.

Other matters concerning personal history, illegal activities

and legitimate enterprises set forth.

IN VIEW OF THE CON-

VICTION OF LA ROCCA FOR ASSAULT WITH INTENT TO KILL AND HIS

ARREST FOR CARRYING A CONCEALED WEAPON, HE MAY BE ARMED AND

SHOULD BE CONSIDERED DANGEROUS.

ever operated a bicycle before and that his exercise had

been under taken in an apparent effort to lose weight.

Both Mrs.

BROWNLEE and Mrs. REDDER observed that visitors

to the LA ROCCA residence throughout the early months of

the summer have been scarce.

Neither have observed anything

out of the ordinary during the period covered by this report.

No unusual visitors have been at the residence and there have

been no large congregations of people at any time, according

to the women.

II. Other Matters Relating to Personal History and the

Current Welfare of LA ROCCA and his Relatives

PG T-I has advised that LA ROCCA has continued to

remain in the Pittsburgh-Ingomar, Pa., area and has not

returned to Florida since his return home during the second

week of April, 1964.

A mutual acquaintance has observed

LA ROCCA in the vicinity of the Mikfon Jewelry Store,

located in the

shady Side Section of Pittsburgh, on at least

two occasions.

Heretofore, LA ROCCA had not been known to

spend any time in that specific area.

The aforementioned informant.. has heard rumors

to the effect that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) at

Pittsburgh is again endeavoring to "make a big case"

involving

LA ROCCA but cannot bring it to court until more expenditures

He said LA ROCCA/knows this, and his former

daughter-in-law has been instructed by him not to talk to

Federal investigators.

He seems to be jockeying with his

creditors so that payments can be "spread out" over severai

years time. All payments, wherever possible, are made in

cash.

This informant has advised that LA ROCCA still

leaves his Ingomar,

â€¢Pa., residence daily as though he had

a position which entailed punching a clock or reporting

to a superior.

He enjoys visiting different locations

which he has an interest and simply wants to put in an

appearance so that underlings and

possible opposition-type

Individuals continue to realize that he is in good health,

has an interest in various projects, and his completely

available.

He utilizes his Cadillac for appearances and
