. of full-time service on the GS-13 Clandestine Service

Personnel Evaluation Board, 1 know that this work has been
particularly demanding. Your partictpation and diligent
application of your professional experience have been
decisive factors in the successful accomplishment of the

Board's missions,

_.. In the course of this assignment you have become
thoroughly familinr with the use and interpretation of per-
sonnel files and personnel practices of the Clandestine
Service, Having reviewed and analyzed the files of one
hundred or more CS officers, you have had to make judgments
and recommendations concerning their relative-ranking and
their qualifications for promotion, for training required

to overcome a deficiency or. enhance career effectiveness,

for changes of assignment to further career development and
for Quality Step Increases to recognize outstanding perform-
ance, . In 80 doing, you have carefully studied the career
development of a large number of officers in all components
of the CS, both as individuals and in relationship to each
other in terms of morit and value to the Clandestine Service,

You have become familiar with a broad spectrum of
personnel and administrative problems on a practical working
level and have acquired a knowledge of personnel management
whitch will better equip you to handlo supervisory positions
which require personnel reporting and career development of
subordinates. Tho committee format of the panels has also
deepened your understanding of the conference approach to

management probloms.

1 April 1970 to 32 March 1971

i

Mr. Williamson departed) » on 2)
February 1971, after having served as Chief of Station for two and
one half years, The last year of his tour was highlighted by two
extremely delicate, highly productive operations targeted against
the [| i: Jopera-
tion of a most sensitive nature stemming from them, This latter
operation, focused as it waa around
called for constant good judgment on how to pursue U.S, Govern-
ment interests with this highly sensitive and significant intelligence
at hand, (It was highlighted at the WH Division's Chiefs of Station
Conference held in February 1971 as a classic example of both the
collection and use of intelligence on the real "national interest"

level.)

Throughout these operations, Mr. Williamson handled him-
self very well, especially during the latter part of his tenure when
he was under considerable pressure as an almost inevitable conse-
quenco of the impact of these operations, Ultimately, Mr.

Williamson's[ was requested by the

It should be stressed that this was a mark of
his operational success rather than the result of any operational
"flap" or miscue whatever, /

The



fact that, under these general circumstances, he continued to
function normally, responding to numerous demands being made
on him by the situation and Headquarters, and set about paving
the way for his successor to take up the cudgel from the best
operational platform -- all this épeaks for itself and certainly
underlines the fine quality of Mr. Williamson's professional and
personal characteristics,

In the yvealm of normal activity, Mr. Williamson handled
his officers with both firmness and tact, He was a good manager,
ran a taut Station, and had cut back on sevéral marginal operations,
streamlined others, and initiated some new ones. He writes well
and quickly, and he has exceptional fluency in Spanish, He moved
very well in the local community and, during his tenure, established
a wide range of contacts,

Mr. Williamson's relationship with the) was

excellent, and his wife was u great help to him in discharging his
representational duties and| |within the | ]

In sum, Mr, Williamson is a "pro" who turned in a strong
perforrnance both before and after the chips were down,

SUBJECT: Earl J. Williamson
1 April 1968 - 31 March 1969

Mr. Williamson has an aggressive, constructive and
realistic approach to operations. He has made a good assess-

> ment of the station's operational asscts and personnel and has

succeeded in sharpening general performances. Coordination
and cooperation between the station and Headouarters leaves
nothing to be desired,

He displays appropriate cost-consciousness. The
morale of station personnel is high. Mr. Williamson and his
wife are highly regarded by embassy personnel, and have
established a wide circle of Costa Rican friends and contacts.

He has put in a Strong performance.

FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Momorandum in Liou of Fitnoss Report -
‘Mr, Earl J. Williamson

1, Mr. Williamson is on the evo of his departure
Qs an overseas Chief of Station. This is a logicnl and
Justified noxt step in his carcor development. Mr.
Williamson's responsibilitios have been considerable
in rocont years: DCOS in two important Stations;
Chief, FI and then Doputy Chief of WH/COG, It should
be pointod out that in tho latter position he was
Acting Chiof for long periods, performing admirably.
Hig new assignment indicates that the most senior

officors in the Division have recognized this.

2. Mr. Williamson is a profossional intelligence
officor in tho strictest sense of tho word. He is hard~
driving and tenacious; despite his seniority he is on
any list of activists; ho has tho capability of gotting
things going, of getting tho job done. He applics rigid
standards to his subordinates, but no less rigid than
thoso ho applics tv himself. He 18 cost-conscious to
an unusual degree. He is a fluont speaker of idiomatic
Spanish and can handle himsolf well in any miliou. If
Mr. Williamson is ever less than diplomatic it ‘is when
considering ersatz operational proposals or phoney
practices, neithcr of which ho can tolerate.

3. There is no question that in his next assignment
Mr. Williamson will benefit from the soctal graces of his
charming wife. In his own private life Mr. Williamson
maintains numerous important contacts,



4. In summary, Mr, Williamson is a dedicated
and professional intelligénce officer. Ho will
undoubtedly continue his fine performance as a
Chief of Station, and should in timo ‘bo promoted
to the next higher grade.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Memorandum in Lieu of Fitness Report =
My. Earl J, Williamson

1, Mr, Williamson reported to WH/Cuban Operations
Group in February 1966 and immediately took over the
functions of Chiof of the FI Branch, This Branch is
concerned with the conduct of positive intelligence
operations on a world-wide basis against |
target. A small proportion of these operations were
conducted directly from Headquartors (including the

The
larger number of those operations was conducted through

of staff support and guidance and extensive dealings

Williamson took hold of these dutios quickly and force-
fully and carriod thom out effectively and officiently.

2. In July 1966, Mr. Williamson was appointed
Deputy Chief of the Cuban Operations Group. In this
role his duties involved supervision of the totality

of the operational effort, including FI, Ct,| ]
jana

| Again, Mr, Williamson undertook his
roader duties forcefully and efficiently. He has
shown qualities of leadership and good managerial skills
in dealing with porsonnel and organizational matters.

3. During this period, Mr. Williamson has primari-
ly been interested in substantive operational matters.
He has carried out efficiently and promptly those
staff functions which I have assigned to him, but I
detect a-certain lack of interest in these, Probably
this reflects his most outstanding ability and con-
suming interest in tha roal heart of our activitics--
the production of intelligence and in the conduct of
actions against our target. He has participated
persenally in several operations and is one of the
relatively few senior officora who dolights in handling
agents and waking recruitmonts,

oa 4, Mr, Williamson ts’ consctentious and economical
in tho use of operational assots, manpower and money.
No is married to a charming young woman who ts socially
active, entertains well and is a real asset in repre-
sentational activities,

5. Mr, Williamson's Spanish is fluent and
colloquial, and in combination with his extensive
understanding of Latin America and its people contri-
butes enormously to his effectiveness,

During the period under review Subject's activities dn wehbe? 68 of
Cuban operations elsewhere in Europe and his re ee rantane as Coordina
tor of Cuban activities for Western Europe have kept hap, from the
Madrid Station approximately one half of the twelve month 7 fil od. Since
these activities were under the direction of Headquarters, and not this
Station, the rater docs not feel qualified to comment on Subject's per=
formance of Specific Duties 2 and 3 and has therefore left those rating
boxes blank for completion by the appropriato Headquarters’ official.

With respect to Specific Duty 1, supervision of Station's Cuban opera-
tions, Subject has. applicd himself aggressively and imaginatively to this
task and the rater fecls that Station's Cuban operations have been main-
tained at a high level and have been an important contribution to KUBARK*
world-wide effort against this priority target. Obviously Subject's fre~
quent and prolonged absences from the Station have not permitted him to

give this task his undivided attention or the day-to-day continuity that

is so necessary and important,

CoMRaENTS OF Wa VIEWING OFFICIAL
I know subject and am thoroughly familiar with his work and performance.

I concur in this report with one exception, namely the rating given
subject for specific duty No, 6. Bocause of his travels which absented
him from the Station for one-half of tho past yoar, subject perforce was
inadequately qualified to take charge of the station in the absence of
the COS, Specializing on Cuban operations entirely, he has but a
limited knowledge of the station's other activities and considering only
the effectivoness of his performance of this duty, I could not rate him
hixhor than P. This is not a comment on his capability but rather an
evaluation of his effectiveness in performance of this particular duty.
