MEMORANDUM

SUBJECT: Garrison Investigation of Kennedy Assagsination:
Allegations of Involvement, GIA and Cyban

1, Mr. Galvig:Thomas)of the SB Division wrote a memorandum
entitled "Possible DRE Animus Toward President Kennedy" and dated :
8 March 1967. At that time Mr. @@niad had recently returned froma
tour of duty in Yugoslavia. While there he had’read about the Warren
Commission's investigation and had noted thé pre-assassination encounter
in New Orleans between Carlos Bringuier f the Student Revolutionary
Directorate (DRE) and Lee Harvey OswgId. He recalled his own dealings |
in Miami with the DRE, a CIA-subsidized group. He considered the j
DRE members whom he knew to be yhpredictable and untrustworthy. He
speculated as to whether DRE elepfents could have been involved in the
Kennedy assassination. He recofnmended that CIA investigate this
possibility if it had not already’done so. Horiad) was assigned to Miami
from July 1962 to August 1963. “Neither CI/R&A nor SB has a retention

:\ a. Miss Margaret Forsythe. She stated that CLA's
interest inthe DRE had been made known to the office of the
Attorney General by letters of 9 January and 13 April 1963
addressed to J. Walter Yeagley. ‘The earlier letter said, in

>. part, "The DRE is of interest to this Agency which sponsors
and supports its propaganda and intelligence collection activity
in the Western Hemisphere . . . a3 the DRE is not a group
under complete Agency control, the above does not insure that
they will not undertake isolated paramilitary operations without i
prior notification." 7s

in New Orleans at the time of the Oswald-Bringuier
confrontations in August 1963. It was concluded that
Oswald was never a member of the DRE, which in fact

+ rejected him, and that the ine was not involved in the
assassination.

3. In April 1967 the undersigned showed a copy of the (honas
memorandum to Mr. GieniFlére$, then C/WH/COG, who considered
that it reflected inadequate information and bias. It was agreed,
nevertheless, that the charges which District Attorney James.Garrison
was then beginning to level against anti-Castro Cubans and thie Agency
necessitated careful checking. cn Aas

4.- The first report in the CI/R&A series on Garrison, 26 April ©

1967, Msted seven Cuban refugees then linked to the case (Sergio,
ARCACHA Smith, Carlos BRINGUIER, Julio BUZNEDO, Manvel GARCIA _
Gonzalez, Pascual GONGORA, Miguel Silva TORRES, and Carlos
QUIROGA.) It requested any additional WH/GOG information about them
and about the following groups: the Cuban Democratic Revolutionary
Front, the DRE, the Information Council of the Americas, and any other
anti-Castro groups active in the New Orleans area. The request added,
‘Information about CIA relationships with the above-named groups should
not be restricted to New Orleans but should also include Miami and other
areas to which Garrison's investigations may lead."" Information was
also requested on Edward S. BUTLER, Alberto FOWLER, Emilio
SANTANA, and a paramilitary training site at Lake Pontchartrain. By
a memorandum forwarded on 8 May 1967 the then AC/WH/COG, Mr. Barf)
GI Williamgo@, provided the requested information and added, "WH/COG
‘will continue to review all material that may contain information pertinent
to this ‘subject and will forward such information to CI/R&A on a priority
basis."

5. ‘Since that date CI/R&A has prepared a series of reports on
the Garrison case. All of these have been forwarded to WH/COG. In
turn, WH/COG has provided additional information from its own files
and those of the Miami Station, to which it has addressed several inquiries.

6. CI/R&A ie currently compiling a separate list of ail Gubans
(as well as other Latin Americans) whose names have been linked to the
Garrison investigation. This ist will be forwarded to WH/COG with a.
request for checke if it contains any identities not previously traced
against their files (including those of JMWAVE).

7. The problem arising from Garrison's charges of Agency
involvement in the assassination is compounded by the nature of
some of our former Cuban operations, which resulted in a form of
indirect association. For example, Garrison has sought without
success to extradite Sergio ARCACHA Smith from Dallas. FBI reporting
of 28 March 1967 stated that according to Layton Patrick Martens,
Garrison will try to prove that Arcacha was the "second trigger man"
in the assassination. . The checks run by WH/COG and CI/R&A have not
shown any link between Arcacha and CIA. However, WH/COG has
reported that Arcacha was the delegate of the Frente Revolucionario
Democratico (FRD) in New Orleans before the Bay of Pigs, that he
maintained regular postal contact with FRD headquarters in Miami,
that the FRD and the Cuban Revolutionary Council were supported by
CIA, and that funds were supplied to the head of these groups, Dr. Jose
MIRO Cardona. Consequently Arcacha may have believed that his
activities in New Orleans were ClA-supported. This phenomenon of
indirect association appears in other cases as well and may well underlie
some of Garrison! 8 accusations. '

8. tis suggested that C/WH or his representative might
profitably query Mr. @lowrastabout the allegations summarized in
paragraph 1, above. Although the date for the trial of Clay Shaw has
not been set, it is plainly drawing closer. Once it starts, the newspapers
will carry a flood of accusations, old and new; and it would be judicious
to be prepared in advance,
