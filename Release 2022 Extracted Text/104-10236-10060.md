$, The 3 infiltrees were instruded ~ and expected - to romain

on Elbow Cay until the WASP could return with an. intermediate craft,

without which the infiltration would be impossible, Further, the

infiltration point was not known to any of the 3 infiltrees, only to

the guide who was aboard the friendly Sigma. 01 a¢"February 1963, the

friondly Sigma departed Miami with a crew.of 3,*Emilip. PEREZ Fernandez, ‘&
