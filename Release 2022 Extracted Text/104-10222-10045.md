At first glance I find

the ratings in Section B high and wonder

how he would compare with other

technicians doing the same work even

though he is performing in a very professional manner.

technical standpoint he has kept the operation alive through

perseverance, hard work and a high degree of technical proficiency.

His ability to got alcng with his Mexican contacts and the degree of

respect they have for him is very commendable. Not having the

opportunity to compare him with other technicians, doing the same job

under identical circumstances, it is difficult to find a fair rating.

This officer Is an extremely willing and hard worker. From the technical

slandpoint his performance is satisfactory in every sense.

He devotes long hours

to kceping the equipment in perfect working order and is always willing and ready

to accept any extra assignment glven him regardless of his personal and famlly

commitments.

concise rcports. Because he lacks aggressiveness and due to his limited knowledge

of the Spanish language he has been unable to provide first rate case officer control

over the LP under his command. This is at Icast partlally due to the fact that the

Indigenous personnel resent to some extent being under the control of a PBPRIMER

and prefer to take Instructions from the indigenous case officer (LIENVOY/2).

This is not because of the KUBARK Case Officer's personality but because of pride

of nationally. As a matter of fact, this officer has a very pleasant personality

and gets alung well with his co-workers. With respect to this officer's potential

and future development the rating officer recommends that at the conclusion of

his present tour In June of 1962 that he be reassigned to Headquarters for extensive

This trauning period should include basic english, reports writing and

trade craft. If he la to continue as a technical casc officer he should also have

further technical training depending upon his future agsignments.
