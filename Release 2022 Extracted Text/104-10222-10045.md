He has frequently been mado privy lo matters which would
not normally be revealed to the Station or come tu the Station's
attention in the routine way. This is due to his closeness to
tho indigenous personne] connected with the operation and thoir
acceptance of his “in” with the powers that be.

Overall, Subject contributes in a vory strong way to the
operation. Without tim the operation and the-resulting
relationships may well have been lost some years ago. It, 18
hoped that his porsonal desires will load hin to remain with

the project for some years to como.

‘I agrea to nll of the above, ‘Those who are unaware of it
should know that subject spent many years, until last January,
having to work with an unpleasant, venal, untruthful, and lazy
suporvisor of tho operation. . (The new presidont fired Him.)
Subject went through those ‘yoars of unpleasantness without evor
losing sight of the agency's noods. Now, circumstances are

has done fine work over the yearn and he maintains the same

It would be natural toliexbect{ ssfil We rating officer after an
additional year of working on a daily basis with Subject, would
cease to beso completely impressed with the performance of this
individual; in the normal course mfyevents we all tend to slip here
and there and on occasion do less than our best. However, reflecting”
back over these past thirteen months I can honestly state. that
Subject has continued to do an exceptional job of near perfection.

He has not missed or been late for a meeting; he in each instance
brought to us the materials we have needed; the basehouse has
continued to run like clockwork; he has, in sum, met each and every
requirement expected of him.

In-his day-to-day performance Subject continues to save us a great
deal of money not only by being economical in the way he purchases
and uses stippliés but additionally ‘by keeping equipment in operation
which 18 not used any longer in any JKLANCE.operations. (Visiting: ——

At first glance I find the ratings in Section B high and wonder
how he would compare with other technicians doing thé same work even
though he is performing in a very professional manner. From the
technical standpoint he has kept the operation alive through. -
perseveranee, hard work and a high degree of technical proficiency. |
His ability to get alcng with his Mexican contacts and the degree of
respect they have for him is very commendable. Not having the
opportunity to compare him with other technicians, doing the same job
under identical circumstances, it is difficult to find a fair rating.

that the new principals of the GOM appreciated in a very

was responsible for in this operation (their own

Therefore, we look forward to having the services of

This officer has been the outside case officer for the LIENVOY

Project for the past eight years. He was promoted to GS-13 on 23 May
1965. His outstanding contribution to this prejectuls the maintenance
of the equipment. He also protects WOFIRM’s Interest Inside the LP and
Provides the Station with all copies of the take on a daily basis.
Supervision duties of this officer are limited to handling the
machinery, advice on hand] Ing records, and dispensing funds. He pays
the salaries of eleven local agents, purchases spare parts, office
7 supplies and pays other expenses such as utilities and rent. Most of
F these are fixed amounts but subject is prudent in the use of funds for

operational purposes.
. Subject has developed a working knowledge of the language sufficlen
for routine communication with the focal agents. He has also adjusted

well to the life of a Staff Agent. -
The only weakness’ In this officer's assignment Is a lack of real

cover anc administrative handling. He is dependent on the Station for
all Funds, including salary and. allowances as well as an.operational
revolving fund. ~ During subject's assignment of eight years there has
been no-securlty problem as far as his lack of cover is concerned and
no funds Have been lost. This officer is a very consclentious worker
' [who puts in long hours (beginning before seven a.m.) in the fulfillment
of his various tasks. ‘His performance makes a major contribution to

the effectiveness of this project.

WARRAT|VE DESCRIPTION OF MANNER OF JOB PERFORMANCE

‘SECTION €_

ravi

ioe personal oc ‘ :
This officer ts an extremely willing and hard worker, From the technical
standpoint hls performance is satisfactory in every sense, He devotes long hours.
to keeping the equipment in perfect working order and Is always willing and ready
to acccpt any extra assignment given him regardless of his personal and family
commitments. His principal weakness is his almost total inability to write clear,
concise reports, Becatisc he lacks aggressivencss end duc to his limitéd knowledge
of the Spanish language he has been unable to provide first rate case officer control
over the LP under his command, This is at least partlally due to the fact that the
indlgenous personnel resent to some extent being under the control of a PBPRIMER
and prefer to take instructions from the indigenous case officer (LIENVOY/2),
This is not because of the KUBARK Case Officer's personality but because of pride
of nationality, Asa matter of fact, this officer hag a very pleasant personality
and gets along well with his co-workers. With respect to this officer's potential
and future development the rating officer recommends that at the conclusion of
hls present tour In June of 1962 that he be reassigned to Headquarters for extensive
tralning, Thls tratring perlod should include basic english, reports writing and
trade craft, If he ts to continue as a technical case officer he should also have
further technical training depending upon his future assignments,
