ADMINISTRATIVE

On April 5, 1961, SA HAROLD L. WILLIANS, Pittsburgh Sound-Trained

Agents ana SA THOMAS 0. FORSYTH

III surveilled the cottage of

GABRIEL MANNARINO located on Old Leechburg Road, R. D. No: 3,

Leechburg, Pa,, with & view toward ascertaining

of a technical installation.

All construction appeared to be

complete and nobody was observed in the neighborhood

Because of

the rural location,

terrain, limited service facilities and

proximity of neighbors friendly toward MANNARINO, It was apparent

mechanical

that such an installation would have numerous technieal, mechanical

and security problems and would be very difficult.

Special Agents

handling these matters will continue to be alert for possibialties

for technical coverage for this and other logical locations.

The spot fisur on GABRIEL MANNARINO's surfside, Florida, houge

on March 14, 1961, was conducted by SA C. GRAHAM HURST.

The spot fisurs at MANNARINO's Surfside, Florida, house on

April 7, 1961, and April 19, 1961, were conducted by SA ROBERT K.

LENIS.

The spot fisure at GABRIEL MANNARINO's cottage near leechburg, Pas

on March 23, 1961, and April 19, 1961, were condueted by SA FORSYTH.

at MANNARIN's cottage, was conducted by SAs PAUL D.
