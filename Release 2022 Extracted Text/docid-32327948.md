displayed a friendly attitude and invited the PCI to step into
another office, where they could have,a private conversation.

Le 5B

At the outset Che“ conver: ion, GRANELLO apologized
for the conduct of GEORGEXLEVINE, in the latter's relationship
with the PCI several yeafsNago. He stated that LEVINE was
corrected for his actions, that time, and described LEVINE
as "crazy",

GRANELLO then proceeded to advise the PCI that he and
LEVINE were both in trouble with the Federal Government. He
added that he was not concerned relative to his own problems,
since they only involved money and if worse came to worse, he
would simply have to pay a fine, but not go to jail. He further
stated that the people behind him would not let him go to jail.
However, he stated that LEVINE's situation presented a different
problem. He commented that LEVINE is under a sentence of 22% years
but he, GRANELLO, does not intend to see LEVINE serve any time.
At this point, he asked the PCI if the latter would be willing or
felt obligated to furnish $7500.00 for LEVINE's appeal. The PCI
stated that he does not have the money and did not feel any moral

obligation to furnish ee
G LO préceeded to inquire relative to the current

Ll
status of JO] TILLY, who was associated with GRANELLO, LEVINE
and the PCI iy e past. The PCI told GRANELLO that he has not

had any contact with KEILLY and is not cognizant of his present
financial status. The subject asked the PCI if the latter would
be willing to check into KEILLY's current status and see if he
would have any money available for LEVINE's appeal. He stated

to the PCI that GRAZIANO could furnish the PCI with KEILLY's
current business card and suggested that the PCI get in touch with
KEILLY,

The PCI stated that GRANELLO did not make any direct
threats such as he received from LEVINE in the past. However,
he stated that there were a couple of veiled threats made by
GRANELLO. In one instance, GRANELLO stated that the only way his
people are separated from money is by death. The PCI explained
that this meant either GRANELLO or his associates would resort
to murder as a means to acquire money, or that they would have to
be killed to prevent them from such actions. The PCI also stated

He added that FRANKIE. (LNU) arranges dates for a number of girls
that frequent the establishments,

GRAZIANO further told the PCI that one, HARVEY \gREEN, !
a cookie distributor, had recently run into difficulty wi'th the
Teamsters Union. After contacting GRANELLO, lative to the
situation, GRANELLO called ANTHONY "Tony Pro\KeROVENZANo in NJ.
and had the situation with GREEN“straighterieéd ut. According to
GRAZIANO, GREEN has not had any problems since‘that time.

The aforementioned information was withheld from the
details of instant report, since the PCI has indicated on several
occasions that GRANELLO and his associates are suspect of the PCI's
activities. Since most of this information was furnished directly
to the PCI by GRANELLO, it is felt that the unnecessary disclosure
of, this information may tend to compromise this informant.

following information to SA WILLIAM AY VERIC!
