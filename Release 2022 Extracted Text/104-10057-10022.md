Marina and Lee Harvey OSWALD

interrogation during a discussion about the difficulty a

Soviet citizen, who marries a foreigner, encounters in

attempting to leave the USSR if the KGB

chooses (for some

reason) not to parmit the Soviet citizen to emigrate.

Subjet stated that it goos without saying that prior to

receiving KGB's

sanction not a single Soviet citizen,

whether

he or she is marriod to a foreigner, would be allowed to

leavo the USSR.

Asked if the case of Marina OSWALD's departure from

the Soviet Union was typical, Subject replied that her

departure from the Soviet Union was neither typical nor usual,

particularly in view of the fact that her husband, Lee Harvey

OSWALD, was a vory strange Individual.

He had been in Cuba,

and then came to the Soviet Union not as a tourist, but as

an American defector who renounced his American citizonship

and attempted to become a Russian citizen. This in 1tso1f

is unusual for an American - it 1s not typical and vory raro.

for an American to do so, and Subject belleved that an

American doing what OSWALD did (soaking Soviet citizenship

and renouncing American citizenship) could only do so because

ho was a traitor.

In answer to a request for his opinion regarding the

OSWALD case, Subject: said that all of his Information was based

only on what was known to averyone who read the nerspapors

aftor the KENNEDY assasination and on what he read in a con

densed version of the Warren Report while he was in Western:

Europe:

When pressed for his personal opinion he said it was

a very unusual situation..

Normally a Soviet citizen (like

Marina) would not be allowed to leave the Soviet Union, in

fact the soviet authorities would try in some way to convince

the citizen not to leave..

However, if a Sovlet married a

foreigner, and insisted on leaving he or she could always, as

a last resort, be refused an exit visa.

There have been

cases where a Soviet citizen married a foreignar and received

an exit visa, however, In such cases the Soviet authorities

have conceded to the oxft visa requests only because they felt

that the foreign spouse may have had some influence, and could

have created adverse publiolty for the Soviet Government bad

the exit visa not been granted. This vas definitaly not so

In OSWALD's case.

OSWALD could not insist that Marina be

granted an exist

visa since he was not in a position to do so.

and consequently the Sovlet authorities were not compollod to

do so unless they specifically wanted to let her go to America

with OSWALD.

When asked to still further elaborate on bis bellofs

regarding the

case, Subject stated that in this case (OSWALD's).

Subject couldn't guess, and in order to come to any kind of a

valid conclusion he would bave to know something (factual).

which he doesn't. His opinion, nowever..

is strictly an

opinion without any basis or fact.

He thinks that KGB was

definitoly interested In OSWALD while the latter restded in the

USSR.

To presume that OSWALD could have lived in the Soriet

Union as a simple Amorican 1s excluded. Subject belloves that

RYBAT SECRUI

the KGB kept OSWALD In "their flold of vision" and

undoubtedly worked with him.

To Subject it is unthinkable

that the KGB would miss such an opportunity.

since it

always considers using persons (such as OSWALD) for work

either directly in intelligence,

as an

agent, or in any

other way "to infllet damage to

the West".

Asked whether the assasination of President KENEDY

could be considarod as

"being damaging to the West", Subject

answered in the affirmative.

Subjeot explained that the existence of a government

such as the United States 1s a threat to the Soviat ragine.

The United Statey is an example to the rest of the world

(Soviets included) that people can live, survive, and have

a higher standard of living in a democracy.

Therefore, the

Soriet Union tried, and tries, to cut the U.S. Government

down at every opportunity.

Since President KENNEDY was looked

upon by many In the Soviet Union as a popular personality.

KENNEDY's porsonal attraction further raisod this feeling

that living in a democracy had its benefits to an even bighor

lovel with the goneral population of the Soviot Union.

When asked if it was possible that KlB could or would

sanction such an operation (the assasination) Subjeet

answered: "yes, at that time (KHRUSHCHEY's) 1t could have"

KHRUSHCHSY was considered by Subjeet to. be an ignorant

individual who was willing to take risks and adventurous under-

takings. Subject said,

however, that this could never accur

under the present soviet leadership.

Subject considered that

the decision to carry out such an oporation, (the assasination)

could not havo been made by the Chairman of

the KGB since ha

does not possess such authority, and, therefore, could only

have been made by KHRUSHCHEV himself.

Subject was askod if such an operation wight not have

Involted a torrific risk which could have possibly resulted

in an armod confliot between the two nations, had Soviet

involvement been proven by the Americans.

Subject folt that

even 1f. the Amerleans did accuse the Soviet Goverrment of

complicity in the assasination, the Sortet Government would

certainly.dony such an American acousation, claiming that the

Americans wore Using OsHALI, a crazy man wha had been in the

Soviet Union, would say that the accusation was a provocation,

and in all probability would repudiate such American claims.

To underline his point, Subjoct mentioned that ever

though OSWALD was in the Sovlet Union,

and was suspected

because he was in

Cuba.

nothing happened and the Sovlet Union

wasn't accused by the Americans.
