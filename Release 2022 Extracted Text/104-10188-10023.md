REFERENCE 2, HMMA+39,679, 28 October 1970

1. Primary responsibility for the operational and
udministrative handling of tha LIEMPTY Project was transferred,
effective 1 Decomber 1970, within the Station from the REDYTOP
to the Operational Support Section, This transfer was made
as part of our effort to consolidate basic support functions
in the Operational Support Section, and to relieve tho REDTOP
Section of activities. which do not contribute directly to the
pursuit.of priority recruitment targets, However, the REDTOP
Section will continue to be the principal consumer of the
LIEMPTY product as received from the LILYRIC and LICALLA
photo surveillance points, It will also be the maia provid~
er of guidance and requests for special LILYRIC/LICALLA
coverage,

2, The provious REDTOP Case Officer (Bruce H. FERNALD)
introduced the new Case Officer, Howard T. BAGAUS, to LIEMPTY-
9, =13, aud ~14 in early December. LIMOUSINE, owner of the
LILYRIC property, will continue to be handled by Timothy M.
ARCHBOLD of the REDTOP Saction.

REFERENCE; HMAW-15952, 27 November 1967

1. Headquarters’ confusion regarding the various LIEMPTY
Properties 1s understacdable, although each change in location
was duly reported as it occurred, and at various times project
renewal requests, progress reports, and other correspondence has
pinpointed the locations of the base houses involved, The con-
fusion undoubtedly stems from the unfortunate fact that LIMITED
and LILYRIC in effect exchanged approximate locations in 1966
without changing cryptonyms, Up to this point, LIMITED bad been
in a building owned by WOFIRN (with LIMOUSINE fronting for NOFIRY).
LILYRIC had been renting an‘apartment in a building in which
WOFIRM had no financial interest. [n 1965, howevex, LIMOUSINE
bought the property coutaining the building in whieh LIMITED had
been located, Yaced ihe building, and built a new building. in
. which an apartment was rented to the Station (the rent, however,

was to be returned to the Station for three years as partial
Paynent on the Joan which the Station had given LIMOUSINE so that
he could buy the building), For various operational reasous it
was decided to put the LILYRIC personel into the new building,
instead of the LIMITSD crew, LIMITED was therefore moved into the
- building which LILYRIC had occupied, at, this point, of course,
new cxyptonyms Should probably have beeni assigned in order to
[" avoid the. confusion which has evidently develcped, (‘This was not,
however, simply a switch of personnel ~ eact base house retained
its organizational integrity, which is undoubtedly why crypts were
nol changed). AS far aS LICALLA 18 concerned, the contusion

(most of the LIEMPTY progress reports have identified each agent
in each house), and the personnel have uever Leen switched from

Raymond H. GERENDE's security review, forwarded with HMMA-31164,
24 January 1967, : H

: fi

3, “Station Real Property reports are also, with one
exception (NEXI-41), up-to-date and they reflect current condi-
tions, MEXI-03 does, of course, include LICALLA, Nevertheless,
the Station asked for $1800 for rent-and utilities for the
following reasons; first of all, utilities are an unrecoverable
expense no matter who owns the apartment, Secondly, the’ rent,
aven though returned to the Station because WOFIRM owns| the
building, must. physically be paid by the occupant of LICALLA,
He, in turn, is reinbursed by the Station via GERENDE. | LIMOUSINE
eventually returng the money, at which tice it is credited to
expense, This-could, of course, be handled differently, but the
Station has always found it convenient to finance in this manner,
largely because finances with LIMOUSINE are handled on a! semi-
annual basis, The reimbursement, therefore, often comes, many
menths after the payment,

4, The Station neglected to cancel “ZXI-41, which, should
be done as it refers to LILYRIC in its old location, before the
move in 1966, LILYRIC is now MEXI-132, and is in the building
owned by LIMOUSINE, Rent payments are, as originally latended,
being used to ‘help liquidate LIMOUSIN! bt, and, as instructed
in HMMS-4814, 15 June 1966, € erediting this money
to miscellaneous receipts, therefore, nol question
of the need to include money for LILYRIC rent and utilities in
the LIEMPTY project, LILYRIC rent is, and has been since the
apartment was occupied in October 1966, 3,000 pesos per, month,
which amounts to $2,889 per year ($3,200 has been requested in
order to include utilities), Headquarters is correct in stating
that the agreed-upon figure for the rent in this new building
was 2,300 pesos per month, Station files indicate that. ithe
reason for the iocrease (and this apparently was not reported
-to Headquarters) was that the bank which holds the major. part
of LIMOUSINE's loan had determined that 3,000 pesos was a fair
price for the apartment, The Station had, of course, re choice

but to go along with this, tf

5. The Station has no record of MEXI-02, but it is likely
that this is the old LIMITED Apartment, which was indeed
purchased by NOFIRM (via LIMOUSINE) in 1955, But since ithat
building was later purchased and razed by LIMOUSINE, the old
LIVITED apartment ceased to exist. The LIMIT. base house was
subsequently transferred to the building which had previously
sed LILYRIC (but not to the same apart and LIMITED is

and credited to exvense; LILYSIC rent is, and will be through
September 1969, returned to the Station by LIMOUSINE and credited
to miscellaneous receipts as partial payment on Statica loan to

LIMOUSINE,

G6. Finally, the LIEMPTY darkroom is the room where the
films taken by LICALLA, LILYRIC, LIMITED, and LIENTRAP are
developed, printed, and (on request) enlarged by LIEMPTY-4.

This darkroom .is located -in GERENDS's apartment, and he is paid
1,000 pesos: per month for maintenance of the darkroom in
recognition of the fact that one room in his living quarters

has been turned into a darkroos, and his electric and water

bills are substantially higher than they would normally be with-
out a darkroom on the premises, GERENDE is building a house

which he expects to’ occuzy in February 1968, His plans for the
house specifically include a LIEMPTY darkroom, and he will continue
to be paid 1,000 pesos per month for this, To cover this payment
dn the new house, MEXI-137 has been written and will be forwarded

to Headquarters shortly,

the following suamary will end the confusion:

here. The Chief of Station authorized payment to GERENDE
for the use of a room in his quarters as a darkroom in
1964, after GERENDE .vas moved out of a base houce in which
he lived (rent-free) and maintained the dark room,

(4) and (5) Annual cost ig $960.00, including
utilities,

(6) The occupant is GERENDE, although the photo
processing is normally done by LIEMPTY-4.

8. It is hoped that. the above will shed some light on the

problem; the Station will be glad, to answer any further questions

Neadquarters may have.

1, The presence of so many new desk personnel at
headquarters - people who are unfamiliar with station __
history - means that we must turn to you with questions
oftener than you might wish, Our present question
concerns property involved in LIEMPTY, (We arc submitting
the-project as. received from the field, but do not
understand the background very well.)

: 2, HIMA-11257 of 16 January 1959, a project renewal, said
that "approximately one year ago the LICALLA base wae
purchased by KUBARK ‘through:. LIMOUSINE”, and we ‘have not found
any cables or dispatches which would show a change in that
status. Does NEXI 03 LIMUST/LIMESA (see Real Property Report
of August 1967) Include LICALLA? If go, ‘und if we own
LICALLA, why does it cost us $1800 a year for rent and
utilities? (Up until the subsission dated 1963 the project
renewal used to say "LIMITED and RICALLA rents are returned.
to station by LIMOUSINE and credited to station miscellancous
receipts" but after that time this sentence was eliwinated.)

the fact. that we are no-longer sure what the nane refers
to. Originally we bought LIMITED and then sold {t in

“the lot.and saved an apartment for our use, LiNOUSINE
now owns thé new building, but"MEXI 02, LIMITED Safchouse"”
is shown on the Real Property Report as "purchased" by
WOFIRM in 1955 - should this not be corrected? A further
complication is that HMMA -31164, GERENDE's January 1967
security review, speaks of LILYRIC in its present new

.location, inhabited by LIEMPTY/13, /14 and /27, Has the -

old LIMITED been re-christened LILYRIC because of its new
inhabitants?.. When was it completed and are we still = |
withholding rent from LIMOUSINE in settlement of his
payment to us for.the property, The REAL Property Report shows
LILYRIC, MBXI 41, a5 baving been leased in 1958 and

costing $1030. to maistain ($856 rent, $44 reparis, and $130.
