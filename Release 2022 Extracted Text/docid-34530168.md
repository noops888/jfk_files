ROBERT SCHEER

Robert Joyce Kaldenbach resides at

1843 Capistrano

Street, Berkeley, California.

Ribaard Francis Hyland, II, Apartment 1, 1309 10th

Avenue, San Francisco, was

reported by Andrew J.

Eyman, Judge of the Superior Court, City Hall, San

Francisco, on July 9, 1968, as having arranged to

be married by this judge.

During the course of

Judge Eyman performing the wedding July 3, 1968,

Richard Francis Hyland and Susan

Greenwald,

Eyman asked Hyland to repeat the words, "with this

ring I thee wed according to the laws of the State

of California." Hyland replied "with this ring I

believe in the overthrow of the government of the

United States." Unbelieving, the judge asked Hyland

there ana to us a y

statement but he refused to do so.

Then the judge crossed his name off the marriage

license and refused to perform the ceremony requiring

Hyland to get another license before he could get

married:

A confidential source reported March 9, 1969, that

Rick Hyland was active in the Bay Area

Revolutionary

Union as also was Hyland's wife but Hyland was being

expelled for individualism. The same source stated

May 7, 1969, that Hyland was no longer a member of

the Revolutionary Union but his wife was still a

member.

A characterization of the Bay Area Revolutionary

Union is contained in the appendix attached hereto.

REVOLUTIONARY UNION,

ALSO KNOWN AS

PED UNION, BAY AREA

REVOLUTIONARY UNION

In September, 1968, a source advised that the

Revolutionary Union, commonly known to its

membership as

the Red Union (RU), was formed in early 1968 as a covert,

revolutionary, Marxist-Leninist organization ideologically

oriented toward Communist China, which it views as the

model of the correct revolutionary Marxist-Leninist line

developed through MAO Tse-tung.

The Pl advocates the necessity

of violent revolution and open.

guerrilla warfare to overthrow

the existing political system in the United States and effect

radical changes in this nation,

and some members are collecting

firearms, explosives, and other weapons and have engaged in

guerrilla warfare and

firearms training.

In the San

Bay

Area, the RU consists of three locals, one each in ancisco

Francisco, the East Bay, and the Peninsula.

In April, 1969, a second

source advised that the RU

partially surfaced

during

that month through advertisements in

• select

"New Left" periodicals, identifying three members of the

Executive Committee as public spokesmen and offering

for sale

select writings of the RU, including a "Statement of Principles,"

in the

form of "The Red Papers."

With the exception of the three

sublicly identified spokesmen,

the general membership of the PU

vill remain covert; however, individual members are free to revead

their RU membership

to close political associates as the necessities

of political effectiveness dictate.

The RU's published "Statement of Principles" calls for

the smashing of the existing state

apparatus by the United States

working class and the establishment of communism and the dictatorship

of the proletariat; recognizes the necessity of violent revolution

and organized armed struggle to achieve those ends and calls for

the creation of a revolutionary party based upon Marxism-Leninism

as develoded through MAn Tse-tung.
