Righard Francis Hyland, II, Apartment 1, 1309 10th
Avenue, San Francisco, was reported by Andrew J.
Eyman, Judge of the Superior Court, City Hall, San
q Francisco, on July 9, 1968, as having arranged to
be married by this judge. During the course of

q Judge Eyman performing, the wedding July 3, 1968,
between Richard Francis Hyland and Susan Greenwald,
Eyman asked Hyland to repeat the words, “with this
ring I thee'wed according to the laws of the State
of California." Hyland replied "with this ring I
believe in the overthrow of the government of the
United States." Unbelieving, the judge asked Hyland
to repeat his statement but he refused to do so.
Then the judge crossed his name off the marriage

| license and refused to perform the ceremony requiring
Hyland. to get another license before he could get
married.

A confidential source, reported March 9, 1969, that
Rick Hyland was active in the Bay Area Revolutionary
| Union as also was Hyland's wife but Hyland was being
7 expelled for individualism. The same source stated
May 7, 1969, that Hyland was no longer a member of
the Revolutionary Union but his wife was still a
member. :

A characterization of the Bay: Area Revolutionary
Union is contained in, the appendix attached hereto.

REVOLUTIONARY UNION, ;
ALSO KNOWN AS

PED UNION, BAY AREA
REVOLUTIONARY UNION

In September, 1968, a source advised that the
Revolutionary Union, commonly known to its membership as
the Red Union (RU), was formed in early 1968 as a covert,
revolutionary, Marxist-Leninist organization ideologically
‘oriented toward Communist China, which it views as the
model of the correct revolutionary Marxist-Leninist line as
developed through MAO Tse-tung. The PU advocates the necessity
of violent revolution and open guerrilla warfare to overthrow
the existing political system in the United States.and effect
radical changes in this nation, and some members are collecting
firearms, explosives, and other weapons and have engaged in
guerrilla warfare and firearms training. In the San Francisco
Bay Area, the RU consists of three locals,'!one each in San
Francisco, the East Bay, and the Peninsula.

In April, 1969, a second source advised that. the RU
partially surfaced during that month through advertisements in *
select "New Left" periodicals, identifying three members of the
Executive Committee as public spokesmen and offering for sale
select writings of the RU, including a "Statement of Principles,"
in the form of "The Red Papers. "With the exception of the three
publicly identified spokesmen, the general membership of the PU
will remain covert; however, individual members ‘are free to reveal
their RU membership to close political associates as the necessities
of political effectiveness dictate.

The RU's published "Statement-.of Principles" calls for
the smashing of the existing state apparatus by the United States
working class and the establishment of communism and the dictatorship
of the proletariat; recognizes the necessity of violent revolution t
and organized armed struggle -to achieve those ends and calls for
the creation of a revolutionary party based upon Marxism-Leninism
as developed through MAN Tse-tung.
