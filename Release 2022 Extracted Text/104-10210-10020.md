Soviet Officiels* Statesents About NOSENKO

The portreit of NOSENKO which exerges from Soviet
cffictala' statements abuut hin siuce his defection coin-
cides warkedly with NCSLNEO's seii-descriprion. According
to the comments of Soviet officials, principally intelli~
gence officers most likely to be speaking authoritatively,
defector NOSENKO was tue son of the deceased Minister, he
served over a decade in the KGB, his personal shortcomings
were overcome througn the patronage of KG3 General GRIBANOV,
and in connection wita uperations against Americans ise
occupied positions of progressively greater trust and
responsibility, ultimately becoming Deputy Chief of the
largest department in the xey Second (Counterintelligence
Chief Directorate. According to these sources, his defection
wrought severe damage “for years to come" to the KGB
because of his knowledge of KGB operations against American
targets, and his treaciery prompted the expulsion and
disgrace of numerous senior KGB personnel, the cecall of
many others from abroad, the virtual suspension of KGB
operations in the United States, and extraordinary plans to
assassinate him.

These statements are related in chronological order in
Annex A.

Baku), where he finished the Eighth Class in spring, 1943.
In a second version [more probable since entry to the Moscow
Special Naval School required prior completion of the
Seventh Class] NOSENKO said that when the war broke out he . i
and his mother were evacuated to Chelyabinsk, where he i
completed the Seventh Class in summer of 1942. They returned
to Hoscow afterwards, and NOSENKO was then enrolled in the : ‘
Moscow Special Naval School (then in Xuybyshev) where he :
completed the Eighth Class in 1943; in the fall o. 1943 iz
NOSENKO was enrolled in the Leningrad Naval Preparatory
School (then in Baku).

After just six months in Baku, without completing the
Ninth Class, “OSENKO ran away from school and returned to
Moscow.

Comment: NOSENKO has asserted variously that he ran

= away and fought on the front at Tuapse, and
that he had finished the Tenth Class in Baku
and then spent the period 1943-1945 at the
Frunze Higher Naval School, the cquivalent of
Annapolis. He.has retracted both assertions.’

NOSENKO completed the Ninth Class in June 1944 at the
Moscow Mining Institute, and when the Leningrad Naval
Preparatory Scnool returned to Leningrad from Baku,.he
resumed his studies there. Early in 1945, howeve: OSENKO
received a gunshot wound in the hand, and after being
hospitalized for a month, he left the Naval school.

to CIA that he had known the son of th
Minister NOSENKO in the naval school in
Leningrad from 1944 to 1946.

NOSENKO completed the Tenth Class at the Leningrad S po
building Tekhnikum in June 1945, and he successfully passed
the necessary examinations to qualify him for entrance to
the Mcscow Institute of International Relations that summer.

Birth to 1945: Summary and Conclusion

NOSENKO is virtually the sole source of information on
his early life. However, this portion of his claimed
biography is consistent with the NOSENKO family's where-
abouts as publicized in press accounts at the time cf his
father's death in 1956, and with the existence of the
schools he claims to have attended.

Allowing for exaggerated claims of boyhood heroics
(fighting at the front, attending the Frunze Academy, and
formal induction in and discharge from the Navy), all of
which NOSENKO has retracted under interrogation, NOSENKO's
claimed identity as the son of Minister Ivan I. NOSENKO
and the substance of his claims about his life uati, 1945
are accepted as true.

trips abroad'. “There was no proof, only suspicions, and
furthermore, SHAKHOY was a member of the personal staff of

the head of the Scviet delegation, S.K. Tsarapkin." According
to NOSENKO, SHAKHOVY was not and never had been a KGB officer.

SHAKHOV has served in and visited the United
States since 1942, when he was assigned to the
Soviet Consulate General in New York. He at-
tended the 1945 Conference on International
Organization in San Francisco, and he had at-
tended a number of sessions of the UN General
Assemiiy. Most recently SHAKHOV was assigned
to the U.S. in 1963 as a member of the Soviet

NOSENKO said that he was the sole KGB officer 1 the 94-
man Soviet delegation to the Disarmament. Conference and as.
such he was responsible for the security ard behavior of the
entire delegation. [KGB officers 1.S. MAYOROV and 4.S.
TSYMBAL came with the delegation to Geneva, but they had left
Geneva before NOSENKO made the foregoing statement to CIA.)
To assist him in carrying out his security functions, NOSENKO
had the services of a number of coopted informants of the KGB
who were serving in the delegation, [NOSENKO has never re-
ported what, if any, security checks he ran on the delegates
in his charge, or what, if any, information his informants
provided hin.]

NOSENKO has never been precise about how he spent his days
and nights in Geneva, but he has indicated that he disposed
of his time as he saw fit, and for the most part had littie
to do. He explained in 1962 that he could come and go as he
pleased because Ambassador Zorim knew who he was, as did most
of the delegation. No one paid him any attention. It was
known that he was not really a Ministry of Foreign Affairs
officer, and he could absent himself from conference meetings
at any time.

assigned to the United States. In Geneva, he and TSYMBAL kaj
dinner together several times a week, sometines accompanied

NOSENKO said, which secured NOSENKO access to the residency

NOSENKO's Information

SLESINGER came under suspicion by the KGB First
Chief Directorate because of his business transactions
with a number cf Soviets who visited his store and in
whom he seemed to show more than casual interest. The
First Chief Directorate was of the opinion that
SLESINGER was trying to become closely acquainted with
some Soviets, to study them, SLESINGER had visited the
Soviet Union several times. Learning SLESINGER planned
another trip to the USSR, the KGB suspected that "he
might make some contacts or do something interesting”
while visiting the Soviet Union. The KGB wanted to
resolve its suspicions’ that SLESINGER was possibly an
agent or operational contact of the FBI. The KG3 had
a file on SLESINGER, md a senior case officer in the
American Section of the Seventh Department, Yu. M.
DVORKIN, was the responsible case officer. An agent
of the Seventh Department who was director of a photo-
graphic shop in Moscow was instructed to beccme friendly
with SLESINGER while the latter was visiting the Soviet
Union, and the two men later exchanged correspondence.
SLESINGER went to Odessa-to visit relatives, and DVORKIN.
directed: the Odessa KGB to "surround" him with agents. who.
could watch his behavior. If there had been any indication
of intelligence activities, the KG2 would have attempted.
to recruit SLESINGER, but since no evidence was developed,
no approach was made. SLESINGER had travelled to the

KOTEN's Arrest and the KGB Agent QGED

NOSEKKO was asked in Geneva in 1964 whether he was
involved in the arrest of an American tourist in the
USSR in the fall of 1963. Almost at cnce, NOSENKO
identified the case as that of Zernard KOTEN, a guide for
Afton Tours in New York City (and hence an employee of
Alexander SVENCHANSKIY, se2 above) who had been arrested
on homosexual charges in Vv. NOSENKO ‘said that KOTEN'”
was involved with an American agent of the KGB Scientific
and Technical (Sat) Directorate. NOSENKO did not know the
agent's name, but from the description he provided he is
believed identicai with

agen’ lentified earlier on the basis cf a May 1962 report
from a sensitive source.

NOSENKO's Information

KOTEN was a longtime member of the American Communist
Party and a-frequent visitor after the Second World War
to the Soviet Union, where he had extensive contacts among
dissident literary figures and other Soviet citizens,
particularly among Russian Jews. [NOSENKO explained in
another context that the KGB is wary of foreigners’ contacts
with Soviet Jews because the Israeli Intelligence Service . ‘
has: frequently inspired such contacts.] Because of these
many suspicious contacts, roth the KGB First and Second
Directorates had concluded that KOTEN might be a Olle
agent” planted in or recruited from the ranks. of the
Communist Party in the United States.

NOSENKO's Information

SHUBIN was a native of California of Russian ex:
traction, a Russian speaker, and a university professor
in New York City. SNUBIN, who had visited the Soviet
Union twice before, visited the Soviet Union in 1953
or 1959, while NOSENK9 was serving his first tour of
duty in the Seventh Department. At that time, SHUBIN
was the. target of Severith bepartment case officer
AA. SKIY, -NKO heard later that SHUBIN was
placed under surveillance, and when the KGB surveillance
observed SHUBIN as a passenger in a ilinistry of Dofonse
automobile, the GRU was asked about Mnerican., "They
very furtively said that they were interested in him,"
from which the KGB concluded that SHUBIN was a GRU agent.

In 1962 (sic) NOSENKO was reviewing a list of foreign
visitors to the Sovict Union and he noted SHUBIN's name
and recalled his earlier identification as a GRU agent.
NOSENKO himself telephoned GRU General SOKOLOV's office
and informed SOKOLOV of SHUBIN's presence (or, according
to another version, SOKOLOV's office was advised by
others). SOXOLOV's office eventually apologized for
having failed earlier to notify the KGB of the GRU's
interest in SHUBIN.

a sensitive source
Comment: Carlier, GREAENORES® identified agp

agent apparently identical with SHUBIN
and PBI sources reported SHUBIN's travel
to the USSR in suzmer 1961 and in
September 1963.

SHUBIN had no valid U.S. passport
between 1940 and June 1961; if he visited
the Soviet Union during that period it was
not as an American tourist under his true
name. Consequently, he could not then have
been the tourist target of the Seventh
Department case officer, as NOSENKO claimed.
If NOSENKO erred, and actually was referring
to SHUBIN's visit in 1961, there is a further
contradiction: NOSENKO could not have
noticed his name while reviewing tourist
lists in the Seventh Department, because
he claims he was in the American Department.

Knowledge of Other Seventh Department

The notes NOSENKO brought to, CIA in Geneva in 1964
(see p.319) included brief reference to thirteen cther KGB
operations conducted, ayainst what NOSENKO descrited as
tourists during the 1962-1563 period. for reasons cited
in the description of these operations in Annex B, these
operations are not material to NOSENKO's claim to service

Immediately following his defection NOSENKO continued to
refer to this special and personal relationship, which
touched on nearly every aspect of NOSENKO's KGB’ service.
Under interrogation, hcwever, NOSENKO could not susta
this claim. The extent NOSENKO's statenents were retracted
or contradicted with respect to GRIBANOV or contradicted by
other evidence, is scen from the following examples excerpted
