boats are maintained to the rear of the DIAZ residence
and are presently being spot checked on a daily basis,
further efforts to interview DIAZ at this time would
interfere with this coverage.

Regarding Lead #4, inquiry in the vicinity of ‘
the Standard 011 Station at 4420 N.W. 7th Avenue reflects
this station is operated by Cubans and that almost all business
is with Cuban exiles. In an effort to obtain some coverage
on this station on the possibility that the SNFE is obtaining
gasoline there, Mr. RAY STAMPER, owner of the Amoco Station
on the opposite corner, has been contacted as a source in this
regard. STAMPER is most cooperative, anti-Cuban, and stated
he will immediately contact the office when he observes
large amounts of gasoline being purchased from this station.
STAMPER said that on several occastons in the past he had
observed as many as six 55-gallon drums being loaded and
transported from the station during the course of one day by
individuals whom he considered to be Cubans. No direct
contact will be made with the proprietor of the Standard
Station at this time. .

: [Regarding the information furnished by CIA concerning
alleged surveillance by FBI, it is ‘to be noted that the only,
surve 1llai conducted by Miam1 has been the spot check of
SNFE‘ bogts.| Mention by RAMON QUESADA of the bank account o ay::
SNFE indicates that CARLOS ARBOLEYA, cashier at the Boulevard
Bank, advised SNFE of our inquiry. It is noted ARBOLEYA is
a Cuban friend of VECIANA. :
