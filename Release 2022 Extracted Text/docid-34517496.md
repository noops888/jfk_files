Mr Charles that I regerd as reliable. He is epecifically referred to
08 "Papa Doc's” “banker end finnnetal mmeger. Mr Charles, as would
be expected is "very close to the Paloce” and has ready ececss to
President Duvelier. As for his character, he is @oneribed as "a
crook and a poor liar." In other words, Mr Charles is truly @ Haitian
political character and not to be trusted under any conditions.

6. I noted that Mr Charles mentions bis activity in 1954 as a negotiator

‘on behalf of the Haitinn Goverment with the Genoral Electric Co of
for modernization of the country's telecammnications system.

‘As a result of this contract Haiti experienced one of its greatest
political scandals for the contract was for USth million, ond the
actual. delivery of products wos only US}l million. I, likewise,
observea that Mr Charles 10 proaident of the Iaitien Banana Corp
yisich vas originally operated by Eric Tippenhauer and Coloncl Prosper,
end subsequently was bankrupt because of financial mismnagenent.
Still further, Essential O1la Co vas at one time the exclusive domein
of Senator Louis De Joie, end since his death the company is henéed
‘by Hr Charles.

7. Tam personally satisfied that Mr Ciécara Joseph Charles is President
Duvelicr's personal financlel manoger, and the companies directed
by Mr Charles ere in fact owned and/or controlled for the benefit
of Haiti's chief executive. At the moment Mr Charies' principal
escistemt in the tobacco industry is Henry Sicloit, who just happens
to be Director of the Haitian Tobacco Mono} and Secretary-freasurer
of Le Tabac Haitien, 5. A. Biclait is believed to be Mr Charles"
“hatchet man” tut I vas not able to verify this allegation.
