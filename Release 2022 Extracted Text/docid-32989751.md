HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS
U, S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES (HSCA)

Per HSCA requests dated January 9, 1978, and
March 7, 1978, the HSCA requested access to all information
pertaining to William Hugh Morris. Pursuant to the Memorandum
of Understanding, this information was made available for the
HSCA by Director letters to Assistant Attorney General, Criminal
Division, Peeebeiner saa My. Robert L. Keuch, dated February 17,
1978, and March 8, 1978.

Subsequent to making the releasable material regarding
Morris available, HSCA staff member Mark Speiser advised that
in an article in the Atlanta Constitution dated February 7,
1978, William Hugh Morris stated that he had been an informant
for the FBI. Mr. Speiser orally requested that the informant
file of Morris be made available.

An informant file relating to William Hugh Morris
was located and reviewed. A communication from the Mobile
Office of the FBI to FBI Headquarters dated October 8, 1958,
reflected Morris volunteered information to the FBI on one
ocassion but the possibility of him furnishing valuable infor-
mation was considered unilkely. A notation on this communication
Peflected that the Bureau telephonically advised the Mobile
Office that contact with Morris should not be initiated.
Additionally, the Mobile Field Office informant file reflected
that, by communication dated October 14, 1958, no consideration
was being given to opening Morris as an "informant.

Mr. Spetser was advised of the above information and
he requested a copy of that communication. On March 15, 1978,
a copy.of that communication was furnished to the HSCA.

NOTE: Attached to the yellow copy is a waiver from Geppert

authorizing HSCA access to files regarding his informant
relationship with the FBI, This wiiver was delivered to the FBI by
the HSCA on 1/10/78.

According to Bureau file 170-5569, Geppert was opened as
a racial informant during 7/71 by the Springfield Office. He primarily
furnished a limited amount of information concerning White Hate
activities. He was closed in 9/71 after it was learned that he told
other members of the National States Rights Party that he had talked
to FBI Agents. A request by Springfield to reopen Geppert in 3/72
was refused by FBIHQ.

By teletype dated 1/19/78, Geppert's files in Springfield
were requested and by airtel dated 1/23/78 Springfield enclosed.
pertinent files and references concerning Geppert.

In view of the nonsensitivity of information furnished by
Geppert, the short period of time he was operated as an informant,
and in view of the above-mentioned written authorization furnished
by him, it is believed that information in his field and Headquarters
iiiformant files should be made available to the Committee. This -
matter has been coordinated with SA M, V. Hale, Top Echelon and
Criminal Informant Unit, Criminal Investigation Division.

Attention: Mr. Robert L. Keuch

NOTE: Based on the time period of interest to the HSCA, only
Sections 68 through 80 of the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference (SCLC) file have been prepared for HSCA access.

The Black Nationalist-Hate Groups Counterintelligence
Program (COINTELPRO) file (100-448006) was reviewed for the
period of interest to the HSCA, January 1, 1967, to May 1, 1968.
From this file approximately 25 serials relating to actions or
considered actions against King and SCLC have been processed for
Committee access.

The Communist Party U. S. A. (CPUSA) COINTELPRO file
(100-3-104) was not reviewed for material pertaining to King or
SCLC. There was previously conducted at FBIHQ a thorough review
of COINTELPRO files. Summaries of all actions were prepared in
order to respond to Department and Congressional inquiries about
the scope and depth of the programs. Therefore, serials in
this file pertaining to King and SCLC have already been identified.
These serials, approximately 15 in number from 1962 to 1968,
have been processed for the HSCA (100-3-104~34). -

It should be noted that the majority of counterintelligence-.
type activities against King and SCLC were carried out in their
substantive investigations and not under any COINTELPRO.

To date, Congressional Inquiry Unit procedure has been
to remove classified information from material being prepared for
HSCA access and to make the classified material available upon
request only to HSCA staff member with appropriate security
clearance. Since most staff members now have their clearances
and the volume of classified serials involved in this request is
considerable, all classified information is being left in the
material processed for the HSCA. The Congressional Inquiry Unit
will insure that only HSCA staff members with security clearances

will be granted access to these files.

Other items in the HSCA request of 11/30/77, are being
prepared and upon completion a response will be submitted.

FROM THE FORCE. INDEED, THE POLICE OFFICER PRINCIPALLY
CONCERNED, CHIEF SUPERINTENDENT BUTLER, IS NOW DEAD.
ANY OFFICERS STILL SERVING, WHO WERE INVOLVED IN THE

NOT BE IN A POSITION TO GIVE THE SELECT COMMITTEE THE

TYPE OF INFORMATION IT MAY REQUIRE.
REALISING THE PUBLIC IMPORTANCE OF THE MURDERS WITH

WHICH THE SENATE COMMITTEE IS CONCERNED, THE BRITISH
AUTHORITIES WISH TO CO-OPERATE AS FAR AS THEY CAN, AND
ARE PREPARED TO SEE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE COMMITTEE, IF
THEY COME TO THIS COUNTRY, AND TO FACILITATE THE PRO-
VISION OF INFORMATION BY THE POLICE AS APPROPRIATE. WE

SHOULD, HOWEVER, BE IN A MUCH BETTER POSITION TO HELP
IF THE COMMITTEE COULD PROVIDE IN ADVANCE THE INFORMA-~

TION REQUESTED AS TO THE PURPOSE AND SCOPE OF THE
INQUIRY AND THE USE THAT WOULD BE MADE OF ANY EVIDENCE

OBTAINED. I SHOULD EMPHASISE, HOWEVER, THAT THERE
CANNOT BE ANY PROSPECT OF THE COMMITTEE BEING GRANTED

DIRECT ACCESS TO POLICE FILES. END QUOTE.
