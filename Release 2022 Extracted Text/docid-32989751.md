ocassion but the possibility of him furnishing valuable Infor

mation was considered unlikely. A notation on this communication

reflected that the Bureau telephonically advised the Mobile

Office that contact with Morris should not be initiated.

Additionally, the Mobile Field Office Informant file reflected

chat, by communication dated Detober 14, 1958, no consideration

was being given to opening Morris as an informant.

hir. Speiser was advised of the above information and

he requested a copy of that communication.

Attached to the yellow copy is a waiver from Geppert

authorizing HSCA access to files regarding his informant

relationship with the FBI. This waiver was delivered to the FBI by

the HSCA on 1/10/78.

a racial informant us to a file springfield offere a premar asy

furnished a limited amount of information concerning White Hate

activities. He was closed in 9/71 after it was learned that he told

other members of the National States Rights Party that he had talked

to FBI Agents. A request by Springfield to reopen Geppert in 3/72

was refused by FBIHQ.

By teletype dated 1/19/78, Geppert's files in Springfield

were requested and by airtel dated 1/23/78 Springfield enclosed

pertinent files and references concerning Geppert.

In view of the nonsensitivity of information furnished by

Geppert, the short period of time he was operated as an informant,

and in view of the above-mentioned written authorization furnished

by him, it is believed that information in his field and Headquarters

informant files should be made available to the Committee. This:

Criminal Division

Attention:

Mr. Robert I. Keuch

NOTE: Based on the time period of interest to the HSCA, only

Sections 68 through 80 of the Southern Christian Leadership

Conference (SCLC) file have been prepared for HSCA access.

The Black Nationalist-Hate Groups Counterintelligence

Program (COINTELPRO) file (100-448006) was reviewed for the

eriod of interest to the HsCa, January 1, 196%, to May 1, 1968.

From this file approximately 25 serials relating to actions or

considered actions against King and SCLC have been processed for

Committee access.

The Communist Party U. S. A. (CPUSA) COINTELPRO file

(100-3-104) was not reviewed for material pertaining to King or

SCLC.

There was previously conducted at FBIHQ a thorough review

Of COINTELPRO files. Summaries of all actions were prepared in

order to respond to Department and Congressional Inquiries about

the scope and depth of the programs.

Therefore, serials in

this file pertaining to King and SCLC have already been identified.

These serials, approximately 15 in number from 1962 to 1968,

have been processed for the HSCA (100-3-104-34).

It should be noted that the majority of counterintelligence-.

type activities against King and SCLC were carried out in their

substantive investigations and not under any COINTELPRO.

To date, Congressional Inquiry Unit procedure has been

to remove classified Information from material being prepared for

HSCA access and to make the classified material available upon

request only to HSCA staff member with appropriate security

clearance.

Since most staff members now have their clearances

and the volume of classified serials involved in this request is

considerable, all classified information is being left in the

material processed for the HSCA.

The Congressional Inquiry Unit

will Insure that only HSCA staff members with security clearances

will be granted access to these files.

Other items in the HSCA request of 11/30/77, are being

prepared and upon completion a response will be submitted.
