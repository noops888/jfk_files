Carrazedo uses "Mercedes" or 'Mercedes Castro"; CHAIN

uses "Augasto, " "Captain Augusto, " "Captain Chacon, "" or

"Captain Augusto Chacon. " Benito uses the alias "Saul" or

'Saul P." The "p" probably stands for PEREZ and may be

Benito's true name; when DGI colleagues teased him about

the "p" standing for PEREZ, he became angry and upset,

which led them to think it was perhaps his name.
