COMMENTS (Number each comment to show from: whom

to whom.

Drow a line across column after each comment.)

Ake sor this. SA has gone over it.

He recommends that when this is

prepared that it be given to

Jarvis for return delivery in an

envelope that is unsealed. This

is so that Jarvis can know what

the contents of the communications

are. He apparently does not know

now and is curious about it, quite

properly we think. This would be

letting him know, in other words,

if he wants to read the contents.

It would be a simple courtesy to

Peter Barbour. 24

Jim had no feelings one way or the

other about referrals to the

Attorney General or the FBI. His

feeling was that we should let the

Australians work that out them-

selves.

He expressed no concern

about this point one way or the

other.
