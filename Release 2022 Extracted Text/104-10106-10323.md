s for this. JA has gone over it.
He recommends that when this is

prepared that it be given to
Jarvis for return delivery in an

envelope that is unsealed. This
is so that Jarvis can know what
the contents of the communications

are. He apparently does not know
now and is curious about it, quite

properly we think, This would be
letting him know, in other words,
if he wants to read the contents,

It would be a simple courtesy to
e service and to its chief,
Peter Barbour. 24

Jim had no feelings one way or the

other about referrals to the
Attorney General or the FBI. His
feeling was that we should let the

Australians work that out them-
selves, He expressed no concern

about this point one way or the

other.
