DN T-I reported on February 3, 1964, that he observed

an advertisement in one of the Denver newspapers and correspon

ded with DE PUGH indicating his interest in MM. T-1 reported

that he began receiving publications and literature from the MM.

T-l advised that some time in 1962, DE PUGH contacted

him telephonically and urged him to assist in setting up a meet-

ing in Englewood, Colorado. DE PUGH also invited T-l to visit

the MM headquarters near Kansas City.

T-l reports that he still receives, through the mail,

literature distributed by the MM but has never attended any meet

ings of the MM in Denver or anywhere else in the United States.

T-l advised that dues to the MM are $4.00 per year; however,

DE PUGH has made requests for contributions

for various causes

during the period 1962 and 1963.

HAROLD C. TAYLOR, 2513 South Quitman Street, Denver,

advised on February 3, 1964, that in August or September, 1961,

he corresponded with DE PUGH as a result of reading an advertise-

ment in a local newspaper. He stated that the advertisement had

to do with securing a catalog on guns. TAYLOR stated he was

interested in collecting guns and had no interest in any political

activities of the MM. TAYLOR stated he did not secure from

DE PUGH any guns of any type and, after receiving some literature

from MM, he decided to disassociate himself with the organization

and wrote a letter to DE PUGH requesting that his name be removed

from DE PUGH's mailing list. TAYLOR stated he recalls receiving

a letter from DE PUGH right after he joined MM to help organize

a group in Denver but because of his disinterest in the aims of

the MM he did not make any effort for such an organization and

did not attend any meetings whatsoever held in Denver or anywhere

else in the United States.

PRESENT ACTIVITY OF MM

Information Received from

GEORGE W. TALLENT

On September 13, 1963,

an individual who identified

himself

as Reverend GEORGE W. TALLENT of Evergreen, Colorado,

visited the Denver Office of the FBI and stated he

was an

ordained minister of the National Union of Christian Churches

and was presently the National Chaplain for MM. TALLENT stated

that recently he had become disaffected with both the church

and with the MM inasmuch as he has determined that elements of

both organizations are strongly anti-Semitic and anti-Negro.

TALLENT advised that he knew ROBERT DE PUGH of Norborne,

Missouri, on a personal basis. He stated that DE PUGH is the

national

leader of the MMand that he has visited DE

PUGH on a

number of occasions, his last visit being in April, 1963. TALLENT

stated that he was asked by DE PUCH at that time to attend an

intelligence and sabotage school sponsored by the MM; however,

he was uncertain as

not know either the location of the dates when this school was

to be conducted, TALLENT stated he is in possession of DE PUCH's

manual on guerrilla warfare, sabotage and espionage.

is set up with cells of individuals at the lowest level. He

said there are never more than six persons per cell. A certain

number of cells then come under a group leader and there are

never more than thirty persons per group. A certain number of

groups make up

adistrict and all the United States is divided

into six such districts. All these districts come directly

under DE PUGH. TALLENT advised that the organization is poten-

tially dangerous and there are strong anti-Semitic and anti-

Negro elements in the individual cells which could overthrow

here are i'

DE PUGH and possibly even the U. S. Goverrment. TALLENT stated -

that many cells in the organization are willing to take arms

against the United States should the need arise.
