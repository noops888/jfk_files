COMMENT:
1) Action {6 for Seymour Bolten and George Ladner in their’ respective
fiolds,

2) Obvious questions are

8) Were ve trusting enough or sloppy enough to let the group get
docs which can-hurt us to any extent?

d) If 80, why would they be in the group building rather than in
@ number of other safe places, including hones of group leaders?

¢) Can we find 4 solution which will avoid total animosity from
Gvoup menders and their friends among the exiles?

4) Ie the probability of finding the docs, if. they extat, strong
enough to merit the risk of the proposed breaking Job and possible bad
political consequences,not only from the exiles but from sone U.S, types
who'd Jike to second gueses us?

) Can we make token’ payment tarough the group to ite mexbders to lot
the group leaders cave face and still make our om arrangezents with such
Andivfidual ne xxm as ero vorthwhile for ops of interest to us?
