who Naye provided ‘useful. reports for two years, from an untested
source concerning information on Oscar ‘CONCEPCION Mendoza.” The
report was dated 4 November 1963.

CONCEPCION arrived in the city of. Camaguey shortly after, the.
Hubert MATOS incident in 1959 and began ‘eniployment as a member
of the Cuban Intelligence Service; then-called:"G-2". According
to rumors, he has taken courses in political and revolutionary
instruction, and is a militant member pf ‘the Communist Party.
He has participated in almost all of the revolutionary trials

in Camaguey, and also the execution of "Billy" PATTEN in March
1961. He participated in the wholesale arrest of persons at the
time of the Giron invasion, and arrested a few thousand
Camagueyans who were believed to be anti-Communist or opponents
of the regime. CONCEPCION and Eliseo ALTUNAGA, also a member

of the G-2, committed thefts in the city of Camaguey amounting
to almost 2,000,000 pesos and for this reason CONCEPCION was
