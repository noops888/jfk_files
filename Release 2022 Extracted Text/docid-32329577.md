Then Kr. PIVAR demonstrated that ve could buy a company

In Los Angeles that would retura about $1,000,000 to us,

which purchase we went ahead with.. HARRY ". BANK was

to be the financier, which he did not do. Mo this led

to a fight between the purchasers and the sellers.

Then

1n June, 1963, I received a telephone call fron C.H. DEATON

of Dallas, who said that JAMEs JACKSON said that they

had purchased the ownership of the French Pavilion and the

World of Food Pavilion at the New York Morld's Fair

and would ve be the contractor for they and that they rould

finance the job. Funds 1n BsCION frOM various exhibitors vere

urned over to then in trust because in some nanner they got

to be the officers offthe corporation. Their attorney at

N

that tiMe HaS GEORGE MONAl.N, fOrmer COnnissioner of police

of new jock aitr The three of them undoubtedly were out

to fleece the exhibitors. He didn't know this at the time

but the money in trust was turned over to then and we sere

called in again to exanine the prints and agroed we would

do the job at cost plus 10.

"While there was a light between the purchasers and

the sellers; Mr. HUGHES net with Mr. DIATON In New York City

and they discussed Mr. DIATON buying Kalghin and Hughes

and MI. HUGHES sas satisiled... I loft the decision entirely

up to his because you could see as trustee and President

of the company, I uns getting in the widdle of about three

of four groups.

Ar. HUGHrS stated that he would sell to anyone

who had the soney.

r. DiATON gave three checks,

one in the

amount or $104,000 and two totalling 3250,000. $100,000

tas the deposit on the purchase and $250,000 was the down payment

on the purchase of Kaighin and Hughes. While I was out of tova,

I got a telephone call fron the office and learned that the checks

had bounced.

To got hold ou DRATON and JACKSON and we ran

a chock on then timediately. DIATON, ne could find nothing

about at all, oxcept that he was carrying with hin a letter on

a Bank at Nassau stating that he had a line of credit of

$1,000,000 and as an officer of this bank. On JAMES JACKSON,

learned that he had sorved a term for fraud in the state

of Florida or GeOrgIa. I'm pretty sure 1t vas Florida. So, ve

Joi OnsiAn, the former Commissioner of New York City

N. Y.

Poltce Department, because he was the trubt viticer sor

the runds. To bod to take part in 1t. Thop this brought

the warfare between the group that I represented and LLOYD

HuGhEs out in the open because they said, "You are interferring

with the operations of the company and behind ous' backs tried to

sell to people we didn't vant. "

DEATON And JACKSON professed

complete innocence and stated that JACKSON had received a pardon

and had established a now l110 so to speak.

so, on September 13,

1963, things becamo unbearable.

I went into consulting practice

and did consonably woll.

I continued testilying, fisting and

representing the purchasers, and it was taken before the federal

Court. Mr. HUGAsS had confession sotes so ho imediately had

judgments and ve coutered with a counter suit for 95,000, 000 and

a hearing was held and it vas stated that we had grounds for

our case so the judgments were set aside and the fight was on.

BOSEBANK and POMERs couldn't have and didn't come up with their

share of the expenses. Mr. SHARP, who had very ittle to do

W1th Ka1ghis and Hughes, came up with $25,000 cash bond to the

court to support the fact that we were people of substance, paid

the legal fees and he put dut about $50,000 cash and said that

ho wanted to get rid of BANK and PIVAR and anyone else in the ness

and lets get out of this. He scused ue of very poor judgment

and he was right. He threw ne a couple of bones to work on as

an engineer, one of which was a cement plant, and I nas ableto

Bary much real. He had obtained letters of intent from all

of the people giving us equity and construction, providing

ve could finance.

He took me down for coffee and said he would

like to give

me the background. The background was in two

phases; 1.

"Do you know who I am?" I said, "No, I do not."

He sald, "I am the attorney of one of the attorneys lor the

syndicate and they have control of banks and insurance companies.

The banks and insurance companies are very real and very

clean and there 1s nothing irregular about them at all. l

would like you to meet my partner." GuIDe

FIDANZI appeared and

he was introduced as POWERS'

partner. He

sold me that whatever

he got Mr. FIDANZI would get half of 1t, and they could assist

me 1n this progiam.

I said, 'Well, lets make it understood

now, the person I don't want to do any business with 15 Mr.

JACKSON. I'*e had a very bad experience.

I don't know Mr.

Ni%.

FIDANZI of you, MI. POWERS, but I would want to check you out."

They said, "Anytime anything doesn't look right, you can leave

and you can move into my office at 75 Bast Hacker." '

The y

put my name on the door of POWERS' office and I moved 1n.

The second phase was that be had to describe to ne

the reason

for certain people being in the picture.

The story

was 50 complex that I truthfully cannot repeat

, It to you so

I will tell it to you as l belleve it to be.

DRATON and JACKSON appeared on the

scene with some

securities of proported that they could obtain some securities,

from which they could borrow a very sizeable sum of money

which would increase the net worth of North West Construction

Company considerably.

To do this they would need $60,000.

MI. BILLINGSLEY Called MI. ESPENSCHEID and gave hiM this StOry

and as unbelleveable ag 1t 15, Mr. ESPENCHKID did not bring

a check but he came with $60,000 in cash and they sat him in

a motel room.

Present at the meeting was HARVEY Portis,

BILLINGSLEY, DEATON, JACKSON, and a gentleman appeared on the

scene by the name of FRANK BLoSSER, the President of a bank

in Denver. I never did meet him.

The neeting had something

to do with the securities being carried by DIATON and sonething

to do with the Denvor

Bank.

INo socurities appeared and,

without the advice of Mr. POMERs, the $60, 000 Mas handed to

Mr. DEATON.

Also at this sane time, $70, 000 vas paid by

MI. ISPENCHZID tO MI. BILLINGSLEY for stock in a sining

company that would pay in gold of reclain gold. They spoke of

having another processing systen that vould make steel very

quickly and they showed se the data. I told then it was not

a steel producing formula at all, 1t was merely a mix that you

put in a blast furnace that would speed 1t up.

HI. ESPENCHEID

clained that he had been bilked of a $130,000. C.". DIATON

disappearod 1n Iive minutes and was driven to the alrport

by BILLINGSLBY and left tith the noney.

POwERS, being there,

offered his services to Mr. ESPENCHLID to collect the money

for 25 per cent of bat be collected and he brought in GUIDo

FIDANZI as the man able to collect it.

They kept putting

OII MI. ESPENCH.ID stating that he would build the Gary Projoct

and the Bhreveport, Louislana Project.

I felt sincerely that

he would be given the opportunity to build then.

They clained

that bocause of the moneys involved that originated fron the

Sypdicate in Chicago, they had to keep JACKSON in the pot,

but the money always came Iron ESPENCHLID, who 15 very clean

businessman.

So they must have had a third dealing which I

didn't know about and that JACKSON is and has been notified

over the phone concerning. The deal was that he was to pay the

$60,000 back to POWBRS.

In August, they said they would introduce ie to a nan

So I called OMEN MiDDLs

too many people, and I talked too much and that this man

owed 332,500 and he better get it in because no are going to di

pay $325,000.

I bald, "Noll, I like to know how but I won't

talk any more." I later learned that OMIN/MEDDLES, 1s to receive

Then I received a paczage

gurveys on 1t. I told them that I was going to send 1t back.

Tey gave me the word I shouldn't send it back, that they

said he was a principal at Pocono, and if we put it through

would there be a percentage on the concessions and prograns.

I said, "Who are you, Mr. MESSINA?"

He said, "I'm a princtal"

1n a very gruii voice.

I said, "Hell, I don't see your same

on the list of principals."

He said,

"Lets just say that I'

a principal and I have other people handling 1t for me." About

'a half hour later I got chewed out by FIDANZI.

In October, apparently they sad the projects that 1

had coming and they were all excited so then it becane a question

as to who was to run the operations. They had signed this contract

with Mr. BILLINGSLEY and I learned that they had collected

$25,000 and I don't belleve more than $2,000 of 1t got into the

bank. I had been to Denver with BOB FeRRElL and net the .

Denver people and then I net JOB STEIN and they agreed that

STEIN would help us.

There was dissension between FIDANZI,

RUBINO, and DAUBER.

So on & Saturday 1n October, I got & telephone call

Iron GUS RUBINO and he said, "Can you nork with se?"

I said;

"Yes. I'm world wide Mortgage, so 11 you can get mortgages,

yes." An hour later I got a call fIon FIDalul ana he sala

I said, "I would

He Bald,

"Well, can you

quietly sneak into Chicago, but don't you tell FIDANZI

So I came 1n Sunday mornias on the 8:00 plane and only

RUBIXO was there. He took no in a cat and I said, "Who an

I sald,

"I want to knon what this 18 lending to" and he sald, "e

logitinato prograng and no want to keep 1t logitinate. "e

w1th 1t."

This land loan he spoke of; the Gary H18h RiBe

cosmittaent; a loan to a nan where they vero going to nako

845,000 cash; and he nentloned fourth one which he didn't tell

about, but it mas snaller.

JIN really got mad and said,

"He sold it to hin for how nuch?"

I said, '*825,000."

He said,

"Did you need the soney?" I said, "No.

That 18 what

DAUBER then cane in and said that they

decided that I would stay with RUBINO because he could get

conmitments and DAUBER nould stay with FIDANZI so that ho

Me moved out to RUBINO's real estate office called

King's Rental, 14428 South Hestern Avenue, Posen, Illinois.

Newere there

for about a meet and out of a clear blue sty

FIDANZI and RUBINO were good friends and I sald, "I would

11ke 'to talk to the man agata to seo what the situation 18."

8o RUBINO and DON ROSS and DAUBXR and I went back to JIl C's

home.

He decided that RUBIND's time was up and he couldn't

get the connitnents but FIDANZI lnen how to raise the money

and that he was supporting business.. I again asked bow

1g he supporting the business when be collected 825,000 that

FIDANZI did sign and the money mas never deposited, he

just put 1t 1n his pocket and he went.

That was the night

- JOE BANANAS' nother died and they were having a valo.1n

Chicago Heights and over the phone by code they said,

"Jog's nother's wake, you know where, and he wants you there

at 8:00."

FIDANZI went there and JIM told him, "Got the

Denver Package back or you put the $25,000 back." That 1s

when it really dawned on me there was going to be no package or

$25,000 back. When I got the nail 1s November, there was

& letter Iron Ashland State Bank stating they chose not to have

us as an account. "

He had my secretary,

Mrs. ROSE BICK, call ASHLAND

to find out why and me learned that a check for $5,700 had been

written on our account that GUIDO FIDANZI had taken. They

had schened up an arrangement with a fellow. by the name of DON

BIAZAVIER who 18 an innocent dupe and whom they have gotten for

about $30,000 to date. Now what he was to do with this check

was they had arranged to take lt to a fellow by the name of

BICKL in Kenosha and he would give them $5, 700 in cash, hold

the check for a few days and then deposit it.

And, GUIDO

FIDANZI got the $5,700, and he got two additional checks that I

don't know their exact arounts, but I know that the three checks

together totaled $10,800. The

$5,700 check was not held by BICKL

but immediately deposited with the bank the next day and they had

closed our account.

That 15 when I sald that I demanded to see jIlty

because I don't want to have anything to do with that at all,

that there was not any attempt being made to be legitinate and I

wanted out.

So I got a call' by coincidence free GUIDO FIDANZI,

and 1 g81d,

"GUIDO, I have typed up my resignation and I want

an explanation for

the $5,700." I sald, "I also vant an

explanation for the $25,000", and he says, "Well the operating

funds for the company have come out of my pocket."

And, I

Bald, "How could that be? How much have you put in?" so he

went

down the line and he itemized about anything that he could

possibly think of, iscluding fictitious payments to themselves,

and he could only go up as high as about $14,000. So I said,

"Actually, then GUIDO, you haven't put any soney 1n, have you?"

I said,

"I was told that I was president

an animal. It was something that I can't describe.

He threatened

me with language, that I couldn't repeat. He said

that I was going

to stay and nake my projects come through and get these deposits and

He said that he didn't like me from the beginning anyhow

and that I didn't understand the situation. He said, "I take care
