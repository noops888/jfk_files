ADMINISTRATIVE

On 6/12/67, the Los Angeles Office furnished the

following information:

On 5/31/67, FRANK DESIMONE, LCN boss, Los Angeles,

accompanied by LA 4476 CTE, drove by automobile and intended

to go to San Jose, California, and there meet with one ANTHONY

MAGGIO. After an

overnight stay they recontacted MAGGIO, then

made

a business contact in Fresno.

In an effort to buy

canneries

while

on this trip, DESIMONE met with JOSEPH BRIGANTANO and his

son RALPH of Hollister, California, and made arrangements with

these individuals to contact canneries up for sale and to advise

the informant of any such potential sales.

On approximately 6/6/67, the informant stated that he

learned through RALPH BRIGANTANO that a representative of Hunt's

Foods, Dallas,

had previously contacted canneries in the San

Francisco, California, area and had negotiated with them for a pur-

chase but had offered

too little and the sale was refused.

On 6/8/67, JOSEPH CIVELLO telephonically contacted

the informant to advise that he was still seriously interested in

informant's locating canneries for sale and repeated the offer

to split the finder's fee with the informant

and FRANK DESIMONE.

sale for DESIMONE's cousin, JOE CIVELLO of Dallas. CIVELLO

has a man who is interested in buying a tomato cannery.

The

linders fees would go to MARSHALL, CIVELLO, DESIMONE and

him the locating of a suitable cannery. DESIMONE suggested

that he and informant drive over to San Francisco on the

weekend of 5/6-7/67• MARSHALL was on 4/25/67, en route to

Los Angeles from Dallas.

By teletype dated 4/28/67, the Los Angeles Office

the following information

to the Bureau, San Francisco,

and Dallas:

LA 4476 CTE met with AL MARSHALL On 4/26/67.

MARSHALL informed that he was in Dallas the preceding weekend

with TONY BUFFANO (PH) and JOE CIVELLO where they all attended

a wedding.

CIVELLO reportedly hates BUFFANO but had to

attend this wedding.

CIVELLO was in Leavenworth 22 years

ago and MARSHAL went to a friend who was head of the U.S.

Parole Board-and obtained CIVELLO's release in 48 hours.

BUFFANO later told IRS where the $7,500 came from to get

CIVELLO out.

According to MARSHALL, the money came from

BUFFANO and CIVELLO's family.

CIVELLO has a friend who is the purchasing agent

for H. L. HUNT, Texas multimillionaire, of Hunt's Foods.

HUNT has had arguments with Alpha Beta

Market owner and

HUNT is trying to corner the tomato market by

buying up all

U. S. crops of tomatoes and purchasing canneries.

He intends

to buy three canneries in California, one of which is the

Wilson Cannery in Stockton. The asking price is about one

million dollars.

Purchasing agent steers CIVELLO, who is

able to contact seller and obtain finders fee.

CIVELLO

expects 50% of the finders fee for his group, including

MARSHALL and probably the purchasing agent.

FRANK DES IMONE

will take 50% to be split with friends in

The los Angeles Office by communication dated

5/25/66, had advised that contact with LA 4448-C-TE on

5/12/66,

developed that CI had met subject in Los Angeles

some years ago and

subject was introduced to CI as a member

of LCN. CI has had no further contact with subject, had never

been to Texas, and has no info re present activities of subject.

CI has heard

subject's name mentioned on several occasions

since.

On a couple of occasions several years ago, Los Angeles

"under boss" NICK LICATA,

mentioned to CI that subject was

the

"'boss" of the Texas LCN "Brugad".

The last occasion the Texas

ICN "Brugad" was mentioned in CI presence was January, 1965, in

connection with FRANK DESIMONE, relaying some instructions fron

the "Commissione" to the "Boss" of the Texas "Brugad". CI

also recalled that about four or five years ago he had met Los

Angeles

"Capo" ANGELO POLIZZI, at the Hollywood Park Race Track.

POLIZZI was accompanied by an

individual whom he introduced to

CI as an LCN "member of the Texas "Brugad".

Informant did nt

recall the name of this individual. Los Angeles advised that CI

is a long-time ICN member of the los Angeles "Brugad".

By communication dated 7/7/66, Los Angeles was requested

to recatact LA 4448-C-TE and oltain a description of the individual

whom

POLIZZI had introduced to CI as

LCN member of Texas "Brugad".

By communication dated 8/24/66, Los Angeles advised that

CI was recontacted and stated that this introduction occurred

approximately four to six years ago. CI's only contact with this

individual was at the track at that time.

CI believed this

individual to be in his late thirties at the time CI met him.

CI described this individual as about six feet tall, 200 pounds,

rather husky build, with brown hair. On 8/23/66, CI advised

that he had been in contact with POLIZZI on 8/21/66. CI casually

recalled the incident of the meeting to POLIZZI and POLIZZI

remarked that he had not seen this individual in some time,

referred to him by the name of JOHN RUSSO or JOHN ROSSI (both

phonetic). POLIZZI made no further comment relative to him,

nor did he refer to a particuar place in Texas where this .

individual resided.

Check of Dallas files fails to disclose any one known

to the Dallas Office by similar names as being identical and

the description does not fit subject JOSEPH CIVELLO, CHARLES

told that this was rejected as being too risky as there was

too good a chance of recruiting "FBI spies" and there was

no need for more members in the Dallas area due to present

conditions.

CIVELLO has decided to finance BOSCO's book-

making operations in an effort to enlarge it and to show

the people up East that a group in Dallas can operate profit-

ably and therefore with a need for more members.

CIVELLO

has requested Bosco to slowly, but surely, get rid of all

non-Italians from the bookmaking operation.

BOSCO that if he gets a chance to increase the group in

Dallas, he would attempt to propose for membership, BOSCO,

PATRONO, NICK MORALE, and SAM LOMONACO.

LOMONACO is a close personal friend of BOSCO

and CIVELLO, and has assisted BOSCO in bookmaking operations

in the past.

CIVELLO told BOSCO he could not use IANNI

because of

his bad heart, and could not use JOE CAMPISI

because of his

"big mouth."

CIVELLO also stated he did not

like

to have any dealings with PETE INTERRANTE because PETE

was "too hot headed."

BOSCO told the informant he would keep him advised

of CIVELLO's progress as he knew it would be of interest to

the informant who had expressed a desire to BOSco to become

actively engaged in any operation with which JOE CIVELLO

was connected.

On June 17, 1966, informant furnished the following

information:

During the pat two weeks informant has taken

MORALE out to dinner on two occasions and has tken him to

some private clubs for some "social drinking" on three or

four other occasions under the pretext that informant was

trying to interest MORALE in the purchase of insurance policies

from the informant.

On June 16, 1966, while drinking at a private club,

informant complained

to MORALE that BOSCO would only take

big bets and therefore informant was not in a position to

bet on baseball or football like he desired (BOSCO previously

told informant that anytime the informant wanted to bet any

amount, big or small, on anything, that he should contact

MORALE

who would get

it down for the informant with BOSCO.)

This discussion turned to the general discussion of gambling

in Dallas to which MORALE advised the informant that BOSCO

ánd NORVELLE STANFIELD practically controlled all football

betting during

fall of 1965.

MORALE said that BOSCO will

handle any sort of bet now on baseball or horse races but

that business is very slow. MORALE noted that BÖSCO and

STANFIELD appear to be having some

arguments recently as

MORALE heard BOSCO tell STANFIELD that if he was

to continue to put up all the money, and make all the arrange-

ments for the apartments and the phones through his friends,

that he wanted at least 2/3 of the profit instead of 50%.

MORALE stated that it appeared that BOSCO was trying to get

rid of STANFIELD before the fall of 1966.

Informant asked

MORALE where BOSCO got all the money for his bookmaking

operation and MORALE said that two of BOSCO's friends,

JOE CIVELLO and

JOE IANNI had evidently bought an interest

in BOSCO's book

had helped put up the money.

told the informant

that it appears these three want to take

over all bookmaking in Dallas and BOSCO once told MORALE

that if it were needed, CIVELLO could get some money from

some of his friends

"up East."

MORALE then told the informant that he would do

anything for BOSCO as BOSCO had given him a job after MORALE

went bankrupt running a liquor store. He stated that BOSCO

has always taken good care of him and recently told him that

1I he, MORALE, kept his nose clean and did what he was tola,

"'we'll make sure you have got no worries." MORALE then told

identified LOMONACO as BOSCO's friend who furnishes apartments

and obtains phone service for the bookmaking eration. BOSCO

has described LOMONACO as an old and trusted "friend."

Informant asked MORALE if he meant that they were

trying to form a mafia-type thing and MORALE answered "I

guess - only BOSCO keeps calling it 'our business' and claims

CIVELLO and IANNI are close 'friends'."

According to MORALE,

BOSCO once told him that CIVELLO is the "boss" and if "we're

smart, we'll do what he tells us and make a lot of money."
