following information:

On 5/31/67, FRANK DESIMONE, LCN boss, Los Angeles,
accompanied by LA 4476 CTE,drove by automobile and- intended
to go to San Jose, California, and there meet with one ANTHONY
MAGGIO. After an overnight stay they recontacted MAGGIO, then
made a business contact in Fresno. In an effort to buy canneries
while on this trip, DESIMONE met with JOSEPH BRIGANTANO and his
son RALPH of Hollister, California, and made arrangements with
these individuals to contact canneries up for sale and to advise
the informant of any such potential sales,

On approximately 6/6/67, the informant stated that he
learned through RALPH BRIGANTANO that a representative of Hunt's.
Foods, Dallas, had previously contacted canneries in the San
Francisco, California, area and had negotiated with them for a pur-
chase but had offered too little and the sale was refused.

On 6/8/67, JOSEPH CIVELLO telephonically contacted
the informant to advise that he was still seriously interested in

sale for DESIMONE's cousin, JOE CIVELLO of Dallas, CIVELLO
has a man who is interested in buying a tomato cannery. The
finders fees would go to MARSHALL, CIVELLO, DESIMONE and
informant, DESIMONE advised informant that he knows a man
near San Francisco who they could talk to and turn over to
him the locating of a suitable cannery, DESIMONE suggested
that he and informant drive over to San Francisco on the
weekend of 5/6-7/67. MARSHALL was on 4/25/67, en route to
Los Angeles from Dallas.

a wedding. CIVELLO reportedly hates BUFFANO but had to
attend this wedding. CIVELLO was in Leavenworth 22 years
ago and MARSHAL went to.a friend who was head of the U. S.
Parole Board -and obtained CIVELLO's release in 48 hours.
BUFFANO later told IRS where the $7,500 came from to get
CIVELLO out, According to MARSHALL, the money came from
BUFFANO and CIVELLO's family.

CIVELLO has a friend who is the purchasing agent
for H, L. HUNT, Texas multimillionaire, of Hunt's Foods.
HUNT has had arguments with Alpha Beta Market owner and
HUNT is trying to corner the tomato market by buying up all
U. S. crops of tomatoes and purchasing canneries. He intends
to buy three canneries in California, one of which is the
Wilson Cannery in Stockton, The asking price is about one
million dollars. Purchasing agent steers CIVELLO, who is
able to contact seller and obtain finders fee. CIVELLO
expects 50% of thé finders fee for his group, including
MARSHALL and probably the purchasing agent. FRANK DESIMONE
will take 50% to be split with friends in the North and

told that this was rejected as being too risky as there was’
too good a chance of recruiting "FBI spies" and there was
ne need for more members in the Dallas area~due to present
conditions. CIVELLO has. decided to finance BOSCO's book-
making operations in an effort to enlarge it_and_ to show
the people up East that a group in Dallas can operate profit-
ably and therefore with a need for more members. CIVELLO
has requested BOSCO to slowly, but surely, get rid of all
non-Italians from the bookmaking operation. CIVELLO told
BOSCO that if he gets a chance to increase the group in
Dallas, he would attempt to propose for membership, BOSCO,
PATRONO, NICK MORALE, and SAM LOMONACO,

- “LOMONACO is a close personal friend of BOSCO
and CIVELLO, and has assisted BOSCO in bookmaking operations
in the ‘past. CIVELLO told BOSCO he could not use IANNI
because of his bad heart, and could not use JOE CAMPISI
because of his "big mouth. '"  CIVELLO also stated he did not
like to have any dealings with PETE INTERRANTE because PETE
was "too hot headed."

BOSCO told the informant he would keep him advised
of CIVELLO's progress as he knew it would be of interest to
the informant who had expressed a desire to BOSCO to become
actively engaged in any operation with which JOE CIVELLO
was connected.

On June 17, 1966, informant furnished the following
information;

During the pat two weeks informant has taken
MORALE out to dinner on two occasions and has tken him to
some private clubs for some "social drinking" on three or
four other occasions under the pretext that informant was
trying to interest MORALE in the purchase of insurance policies
from the informant.

On June 16, 1966, while drinking at a private club,
informant complained to MORALE that BOSCO would only take
big bets and therefore informant was not in a position to
bet on baseball or football like he desired (BOSCO previously
told informagt that anytime the informant wanted to bet any

‘amount, big or small, on anything, that he should contact
MORALE who. would get it down for the informant with BOSCO. )

goo

This discussion turned to the general discussion of gambling
in Dallas to which MORALE advised the informant that BOSCO
and NORVELLE STANFIELD practically controlled all football
betting during fall of 1965. MORALE said that BOSCO will
handle any sort of bet now on baseball or horse races but
that business is very slow. MORALE noted that BOSCO and
STANFIELD appear to be having some arguments recently as
MORALE heard BOSCO tell STANFIELD that if he was going

to continue to put up all the money, and make all the arrange-
ments for the apartments and the phones through his friends,
that he wanted at least 2/3 of the profit instead of 50%.
MORALE stated that it appeared that BOSCO was trying to get
rid of STANFIELD before the fall of 1966, Informant asked
MORALE where BOSCO got all the money for his bookmaking
operation and MORALE said that two of BOSCO’s friends,

JOE CIVELLO and JOE IANNI had evidently bought an interest
in BOSCO's book and had helped put up the money, MORALE
told the informant that it appears these three want to take
over all bookmaking in Dallas and BOSCO once told MORALE
that if it were needed, CIVELLO could get some money from
some of his friends "up| East."

MORALE then told the informant that he would do
anything for BOSCO as BOSCO had given him a job after MORALE
went bankrupt running a liquor store. He stated that BOSCO
has always taken good care of him and recently told him that
if he, MORALE, kept his nose clean and did what he was told,
"we'll make sure you have got no worries.'' MORALE then told
the informant he.was of the opinion that BOSCO, CIVELLO and
IANNI along with BOSCO's good friend, SAM LOMONACO were
trying to set up an Italian organization in Dallas. MORALE
identified LOMONACO as BOSCO's friend who furnishes apartments
and obtains phone service for the bookmakingageration. BOSCO
has described LOMONACO as an old and trusted "friend."

Informant asked MORALE if he meant that they were
trying to form a mafia-type thing and MORALE answered "I
guess - only BOSCO keeps calling it ‘ouy business’ and claims
CIVELLO and IANNI are close ‘friends'," According to MORALE,
BOSCO once told him that CIVELLO is the "boss" and if "we're
smart, we'll do what he tells us and make a lot of money."
