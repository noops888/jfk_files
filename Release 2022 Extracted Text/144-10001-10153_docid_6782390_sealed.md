Dear Mr. Marwell: “or *
=

(FOUO) In response to your letter of March 9,,1995 We tasked appropriate elements’ f
NSA Operations and Archives as well as the Legislative Affairs Office (LAO) and Office ai

General Counsel (OGC) to search for information résponsive to your questions. The fello

represents the composite response of these elemenits. . i
(U) “What technical capabilities did NSA have during the early 1960's for collecting»
deciphering, and analyzing communications?” . 8h

SHEE NSA had an excellent capability to meet the SIGINT challenges of the 1960's. We.
had field sites in position to copy the signals of interés: in the USSR, both High Frequency: arid *

Line-of-Sigit, in Cuba, and those cogimunications exchinged internationally berween coun-» *

tries. We accomplished this through‘a mixture of fixed gites manned by armed forces persOnngl..
airbome and shipbome platforms,.éxchanges with Second and Third Parties, and clandestine dnd,

special sources. We exploited miny enciphered communications of interest, eee it .
commmunicasions and those of a few ther countries that employed very gophis-

ticated cryptosystems. Our analytic capabilides were excellent, both in our civilian and military
workforce. . a . t

(U) “What COMINT did NSA actually interckpt during ¢
Union, Cuba, and Mexico, from organized crime or internacional drug smugglers?”

communicacions. We also produced product on

ucts of any activity that might have been related to the assassination, only post-assassination re-
flections of U.S. political and protocol developments and Cuban releases of statements denying
crime or narcotics smuggling at that time. One organization did follow international arms wade
activity and issued product reports, but there was nothing to tie any of their reporting to the as-

sassination. é

(U) “What actions did NSA take in the immediate wake of President Kennedy’s assas-
sination? For example, did any agency task NSA to perform any funcaons regarding the assas-
sination? Was any task force, group directorate, or other entity at NSA formed or charged with
any responsibilities for collecung informacion that in any way pertained to the assassination of
President Kennedy? Was any traffic analysis performed? Were any product reports produced?

Were there any TSRs?

“CFS=EES} Collectors, based on their personal recollections, were alerted to put greater empha-
sis on Soviet Bloc and Cuban milimry targets to look for signs of increased readiness in their
force posture. Analysts at NSA were also looking for signs of diplomatic reactions to and for-
eign intelligence reporting on the assassination. Any voice and cipher traffic were thoroughly
processed from the surrounding timeframe. Analysts on targets that were unexploitable from a
cryptanalytic standpoint reviewed traffic pattems to ensure that no deviations indicating unusual
activity had been overlooked. :

(U) “Did NSA ever collect, isolate, or segregate any records relating to the assassina-
tion? -*

(FOUO) One file, related to Lee Harvey Oswald, was accessioned into the NSA/CSS Archives

in 1986. The LAO holds five files that topically relate in some way to the Assassination. In

1993 NSA searched for and collected documents in respoise *0 Public Law 102-526. Copies of

the records responsive to the law are held in the Office of Policy.

(U) “What actions has NSA taken, since 1964, with respect to the assassination? For
example, other than with respect to the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA), has
NSA had any program to collect any data with respect to the assassination?” :

(FOUO) Since 1964 NSA has answered queries from various congressional commirees. Files

about the information provided are held by the LAO and OGC. NSA's only program to collect

data related to the assassination was the response to PL. 102-526.

(U) “What files or records has NSA ever had pertaining to congressional investigations
of the assassination or the intelligence community? For example, are there (or were there) NSA
files on the Warren Commission, the HSCA, the Church Committee, the Pike Committe, etc.”

(FOUQ) The LAO, OGC and Archives holds files related :o this question covering all of the
topics except the Warren Commission.

(U) “What records retention (and records destruction) policies has NSA ever proposed
or implemented that might have affected records pertaining to the assassination? You siated, for
example, that records identifying Americans were destroyed in the wake of the Church Commit-
tee investigation, and you suggested that records identifying Oswald might have been among
those destroyed. What were the destrucdon orders: who implemented them; how many records
were destroyed; and how were records identified for destruction?” .

(FOQUO) NSA has created records disposition schedules for some documents. However,
SIGINT records disposition remained predominantly unscheduled during the period in question,
and consequendy their handling is uncertain. Serialized records (reports) are usually retained
intact and are preserved to this day. The retention or destruction of other types of records were
not handled systematically. The decision to retain or destroy was made by the originating ele-
ments.

(U) “What records from intercepts involving the Soviet Union, the Soviet Bloc, Cuba,
and Mexico from the early 1960’s are still extant? For example, does NSA have untranscribed
Cuban tapes from 1963 (but that may subsequently have been brokea)? What records does NSA
have from the Bay of Pigs and from the Cuban Missile Crisis?

<S=CEO} There are end-product reports, code books on target communications and cipher taf-
fic available dating from the early 1960's on these targets in the NSA archives. Our records
show no instances of codes being broken in which we did not go back and decrypt waffic from


the period that had been unexploitable at the time. It is our standard practice to do so regardless
of the circumstances. When such events occur it is also the SIGINT modus operandi to ensure
all voice material having any possible connectivity whatsoever to the event is scanned for intelli-
gence purposes. We found no indications of any SIGINT collection that did not get reviewed.
Such records also cover the missile crisis and Bay of Pigs timeframes as well. There has been an
historical perspective written in 1984-85 on the SIGINT effort during the Missile Crisis that also
touches on the Bay of Pigs, and one is planned on the Assassination (no estimated completion
date). i

(U) “Does NSA have files on American defectors to Communist countries during the
late 1950’s and early 1960’s?” :

—F5—€€8)- There was one NSA organization which, as part of their mission, tacked the activi-
ties of such individuals in the 1960’s, first manuaily and later by machine. However, almost all
records of such endeavors and files were destroyed in 1974, and any such activity ceased in the
wake of the Church and Pike Committees’ reports on such activities and the subsequent Execu-
tive Order issued. The two exceptions to this would be files on Martin and Mitchell who were

employees of NSA.

(U) “Did any foreign government or intelligence service ever supply NSA with any in-
formation pertaining to the assassination?”
< ever being passed by any foreign

(FOUO) We are unaware of any information of this subj
government or intelligence service to NSA.

(FOUO) We have also collected a list of personnel who were working the target ar the
time or who have contributed to these answers. After you have reviewed these responses, please
do not hesitate to contact us to on (301) 688-6798 with any questions which you have.
