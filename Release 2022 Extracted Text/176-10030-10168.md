July 11, 1970
Alexandria, Virginia

By Dennis J. O'Brien

For the John F. Kennedy Library

I think a logical place to begin in anything
like this is just simply with the question,
when did ‘you first meet President Kennedy,

or Senator Kennedy, if you met him before

he was President?

IT don} t recall meeting him wetere, he was
belie?

Presidentg, The first meeting was] - J-wbetiéve, |

the first Saturday following the inauguration,

’ whatever date that was. I was called into a

meeting in the White House by GRobert s.J

on a premise pet any people in Cuba were very
unhappy with the, Castro administration and the
way it was turning away from the initial
revolutionary objectives and the capture of the
revolutionary movement by the Communist Party,
which surprised many of the supporters of i
Castro as a guerilla and as x revolutionary
action. sof. the: thought was to pack a number
of Cubans who either had been supporters of
Castro or were very unhappy, were still resident
in Cuba, and to cause some overturn at the time. i

December, when the planning had “obviously

point to’get military planning in on the

Bissell was a very ‘hard;working, intenseperson,
almost high: strung type eon. He

became rather impatient with my questioning

of the changed concept when it took place. Ak Hows
pititay! te they had the correct’ personnel

and- ff they had a correct reading of dissent

inside of Cuba, that was a.fair chance to do
something. My only concern at the time was/:

did. #Ke | CIA have thes Americans who could work

with such a situation? I just didn't know

of any, “put I was Gtetuetheta that, there were such

Americans but I'n not certain that there were.

Did you question the kind of intelligence that

was coming out ‘about Cuba and the expected

reaction of Cubans’ to an invasion / and the


-10-

reaction to Castro in general?

re LANSDALE: Just in very general terms. :: I didn't have

enough concrete and specific information
myself that was separate from theirs: Most
of the intelligence take at the time, avail-
able inside the U.S. government, was pretty .~
colored with this dissatisfaction and state-
ments of it. go) I had no real way of
determining the accuracy or inaccuracy of it.

was an accurate thing, so. this is about as far
as I went.

O'BRIEN: How deed a guy like Douglas react? Do you

LANSDALE: Well, he approved of the plan, so he and the
others at the policy level approved of going
ahead with it fond. developing it. ' I was his
advisor on this thing! (zhat was my staff 0b),

or not. That was my last advisory role with

him. I was taken off advising on the project

‘after that, actually by my own request because

I was apparently causing too much trouble and

av'sS tae reaction of the Joint Chiefs, People

They had. fe difficult time taking this really :
seriously. Later, I know, when the JCS got

ard helps
anion the actual planning of this, they became
a -

share of it.

Well, do you get involved in the informing
of McNamara and Gilpatric about this? Do you

Well, in terms of the Agency, there's a nunber

were somewhat interested but wouldn't really

have expressed the interest unless they were

word to describe it T-anong the military about

any otandesting operations. They felt that

once it got over into guerrilla type of operations

or anything that would involve a military subject,

Peeee lee aaioe far better to let the military

establishment of the U.S. handle it.” But that

would happen. :
O'BRIEN: Does the fact: that you get this reputation,
mainly out,the writings of guys like [Eugene]
Burdick and Greham Greene, does this affect you
in any way in your relations with the bureau-

LANSDALE: Yes. It-made life rather difficult. With

I came back from a lot of operations abroad

and went up into policy-forming levels in
: A ‘



-2y-

Washington almost immediately, and into facing
people who were very sensitive on my presence
abroad initially. Since I didn't just stick
in.a regular military category but would get
over into their own subject matter, this made
them very a ee can understand
it while it happened but it was carried to
too great an emotional length." at times I
“would suggest certain individuals be sent to
look into a situation in a given country and
would arrange their transportation and so ong
A I would get backing throughout the U.S.
government for this thing/ ana have an individual
approved by the Secretary of State’ as well as
Defense and up at the White House and so on,
but would set up a means of communicating
back so that we would get reports back. There
wipura be times. when these individuals would
‘show up in.a country,and the first time they
sent a mess sce to me, the ambassador would
ask them kindly to Leave the country, to get
out of there, just because of my name. I esse

wash
apparently the seem to some, of these


i -25-

people. ‘One of my assistants was traveling

vetween-Thailand and Saigon, and there was a

a : . a

‘coup going on in Saigon at the time an@ h: his

Pee) which was Air aanaah put down--commercial
flight--in Phnom Penh, in “Cambodia, and the
military attaché very kindly picked up this
guy and several other Americans from: the

plane and found a place for them to stay
until they could get another flight out of
Phnom Penh. He asked this lad of mine where
he'd worked, and he said, "In the Pentagon/"--
he was a civilian employee--and he mentioned
that he worked for me) and the. attaché got

all excited, ‘called a ambassador, and he

was given two hours to come out of the country.

[Laughter] All he was doing was looking for

‘ie place to sleep at night» so it became very

‘emotional and very silly, and detrimental to
the U.S. For example, once in Indonesia, in
meeting our folks around the embassy in
Djakarta, I had spotted an assistant army

one of the economic mission guys--there were



two Americans; who "were a only best known

I think so. There were 2 number of attempts

by the. Vietnamese themselves, and unfortunately)
some of them werecouched in terms of wanting .
me to come out as ambassador, by the Vietnamese@
but Nolting and I had very friendly relations,
and I think he had proposed that I come on if
out several times. But these things would
usually only come to me sort of second or

Kennedy had said something to the JCS because
suddenly my relations with the Chiefs went

down to less than zero. and sub=zerog we I
finally asked General (Curtis E.] Lemay of

the Air Force, because I'm an Air Force officer,
what the trouble was. And he said; "You and
