•1.. Introduction

Jorge VOLSKY is a Cuban citizen of Polish origin, now a permanent

U.s: resident, who is currently employed by the USIA office in

as editor of the USIA Weekly Report on Cuban Developments.

came to the attention of JMWAVE because of his extra-curricular

activities which appear to be incompatible with his position as an

the U.s. Government. A conflict of interests appears to

have developed

in VOLSKY's case as a result of his position in the

his glose association with prominent American journalists (one

whom had an entree to high members of the Kennedy Administration), Tad

and his Involvement in propaganda activitles for both the Jure and saul

the UR counterrevolutionary groups.

shows that he has used *

his USIA position to obtain information for a leftist political

group, has engaged in anti-US propaganda campaigns for it,

and may

be guilty of duplicity in his dealings with KUBARK.

VOLSKY is a

Cuban citizen of Polish origin whose background includes a two ar

three year period in a Russian prison camp,

Because of this back-

ground and the nature of his present political activities,

following compilation and analysis of the material currently avail-

able to JMWAVE concerning VOLSKY are deemed necessary and are hereby

presented as a prerequisite to the determination of the future

course of action to be taken by KUBARK in this case.

2. „ Original JMWAVE Operational Interest in Subject

Jorge VOLSKY first became of interest to KUBARK in February

1963 when it was learned that he was the source of an anti-CASTRO

plan known as Operational Leonardo designed to split the Cuban

Regime by the recruitment of certain elements of the Rebel Army and

Militia in the GOC.

This plan had been presented to ODACID through

Tad SZULC, editorial writer of the New York Times Washington Office,

and ODACID sent it for action to KUBARK Headquarters.

The disclosure of Jorge VOLSKY as the originator of Operation

Leonardo came about when a KUBARK case officer contacted SZULC

his home in Washington concerning the plan.

SZULC was reluctant at

first to reveal the name of the author but did so when the case

officer pointed out that it was necessary for KUBARK to talk to the

source in order to clear up various points.

SZULC, stating that he

would rely on KUBARK's discretion to safeguard the

identity of his

-source, named Jorge VOLSKY of the USIA in Miami.

SZULC related a

¿short biographic sketch of VOLSKY in which it was revealed that

during World War II, VOLSKY, a Pole, had been a prisoner of war in

Russia.

At Headquarters' request JWAVE contacted Jorge VOLSKY and

made arrangements

to sponsor his plan which involved Cuban infil-

tration/ exfiltration

It was the intention of KUBARK to use

VOLSKY only

as a funding channel for the operation; however, because

of the Station's belief that the operation's team would inform

VOLSKY in detail about operational matters, a POA was requested on

A request was also made that Headquarters check on VOLSKY's

activities prior to his arrival in Cuba.

•Locally the AMOTs were

requested to provide information on Subject's activities in Cuba.

3. Polish Background Prior to Cuba

Using the information subsequently made available to the Station

by Subject in his PRQ Part I,

submitted to JMWAVE March 1963 and. the

Headquarters trace reply (Reference A) which includes information

contained in Royal Air Force and Polish exile records in London and

information on Subject recently solicited from various JMWAVE assets,

the following

account and analysis of Subject's life up to his

entrance into Cuba in November 1947.'

In his PRQ Part I Subject lists his full name as Jorge

Stakistaw Ajbuszyc VOLSKY Kraisler,

Poland.

born 8 March 1921 in Warsaw,

He lists his parents as Josef.A. VOLSKY Zascycki, an

engineer, and Maria KRAISLER Madeirka, a medical doctor, both

(Education) VOLSKY'S PRQ states that his education consists

of high school attended in Krakow from

1930 to 1938 and one year of

medical school at a University in Krakow.

(1) USIA records (information supplied by Subject) agree

with the above,

showing that he attended the St. Anna Lyceum in

Krakow from 1930 to 1938 and the Jagiellon University in Krakow from

1938

to 1939.

(2) The Headquarters trace reply which included a London

Station check of the Royal Air Force and Polish exile World War II

records, however, did not mention his attendance at the Jagiellon

University,

stating only that Subject matriculated in 1939 in the

•St. Staszic Humanistic College in Chrzanow.

(WAVE comment: Chrzanow

15 West Krakow, 27 miles WNW of Krakow.)

c. World War II Service

(1) VOLSKY claims in his PRQ that during the years 1939

te 1947 he served in the Rayal Air Foree Polish Group, Serial number

705740, rank:

Officer - Cadet, Private Flight Sergeant.

different section of the PRQ he also states that he was a prisoner

of war in Russia (1939 to 1941).

within the PRQ itself that requires clarification.

This is an obvious contradiction

The RAF and Polish exile check (Reference A) mentioned

above confirmed service in the Royal Air Force for a person with the

name of Jerzy Stanislaw AJBUSZYC (the first three names of Subject)

DOB: 8 March 1921, Serial number 705740 with rank:

Leading Air-

craftman Radio Telephone Operator.

This record which is obviously

of subject showed that on 19 June

1942, while in the USSR, he

enrolled in the Polish Army Service where he

served for one year

until 30 June 1943 and then enlisted in the Polish Air Force Service

under the British Operational Command on 1 July 1943

and served

27 July 1947 when he was discharged

at his own request and

to Ecuador.

The Polish exile representative

further noted in

Reference A that in 1942 the Soviets had attempted to subvert some

of the young

Poles who were recruited at that time in the USSR for

_Polish- Army Service and that such might have been the case with

Subject:

(3) (JMWAVE Analysis) It is interesting to note that

Subject's PRQ and USIA records which stated he

was in the RAF from

1939 to'1947 do not agree with his official RAF records which show

that he did not enroll in the RAF until 1 July 1943.

The RAF records

also show that he had enrolled

one year earlier (19 June 1942) in

the Polish Army Service in the USSR and served in it for a full year

before joining the RAF.

However, even allowing the year 1942 as his

induction date

into the RAF, there is a discrepancy in what

he reports in his PRQ (1939) and what the RAF record shows (1942).

It is possible that he has falsely reported the date of his induction

in his PRQ in order to cover up his activities during

that period (1939-1942). This was a period of time when great numbers

of Polish prisoners of war were shot by the Soviets.

It is possible.

Jerzy VOLSKY (i.e. Jorge VOLSKY) who was born in 1917 and killed in

action in 1941 and speculated that Subject might have assumed the name

of this man!

In Reference. A, Headquarters stated it had made an exhausti

analysis of the allegation that Subject might have

taken the name of

Jerzy VOLSKY killed in action but found no indication that would justify

that conclusion.

In an effort to determine why Sübject's

the RAF rolls as AJBUSZYC instead of VOLSKY,

it was surmised by

Headquarters that it was "understandable" because of the length of

Subject's name.

In this regard, it was noted by Headquarters that

Subject had listed his full name in his PRQ Part I as Jorge Stakistaw.

Ajbuszyc VOLSKY Kraisler.

(2). In analyzing the above interpretation by Headquarters;

IMWAVE felt that if

the RAF were to shorten Subject's name on their

records for brevity's sake,

they would have been more likely to omit a

second or third name rather than his family name of VOLSKY. An investi-

Bation was initiated by JMWAVI in March 1964 to attem LEAK-1, a personal

existing confusion concerning Subject's identity.

wife, Mercedes ROVIRA Bertran.

following pertinent information to offer:.

During the Second World. War at a session of the Havana

Rotary Club it was decided to ask members of the Club who had single

daughters to act as pen pals for officers. fighting with the Allied

armies in Europe. Mr. Jose ROVIRA presented the names of his three

single daughters. Only one of these daughters maintained this corre-

spondence (with two officers), one of whom was Subject, a pilot aviator

in the RAF.

According to Mrs. QUESADA, Subject's father died in

the Second World War and Jorge had joined the RAF.

She stated that

as she could remember, VOLSKY was born in Warsaw, Poland and that

the name VOLSKY was that of his mother or of a grandmother and that

name began with "A" and continued, she believed, with a "w"

(c) At. the end of World War II, VOLSKY, then in London,

phoned: his pen pal, Senorita Mercedes ROVIRA, and they beeame engaged.

As it was not possible for VOLSKY to obtain a visa for Cuba,

he obtained

one for Ecuador and arranged to stop over in Cuba in transit.

- (d) . Upon VOLSKY's arrival in Cuba, Source's husband, Mr.

David MASNATA; by virtue of his connection in

the Cuban Ministry of

'State, was able to arrange permission for VOLSKY to remain in Cuba.

Within a year of his residence in Cuba, he married Miss ROVIRA and

because of the fact that his name was virtually

unpronounceable, he

decided to adopt the name of VOLSKY legally, stating that this was the

name of his mother or of a grandmother.

e.

Station JMWAVE analysis of Subject's background prior to his

arrival in Cuba is inconclusive.

The following points, however, are

worthy of further investigation:

(1) The fact that the name YOLSKY was overtly or semi-overtly.

assumed. by Subject does not totally clear him of suspicion in this

respect.

It becomes evident that VOLSKY fabricated a name for his

father,

that of Josef A. VOLSKY, which would fit his own new name.

it is assumed that VOLSKY is not the real name of Subject's father,

three possible solutions to this puzzle emerge:

(a). VOLSKY is the name of a grandmother as Subject claims

and Subject attributed it to his father

to avoid lengthy explanations

on forms.

(b). Subjèct, AJBUSZYC, took the name of VOLSKY from the

(c) Subject is a communist agent who assumed one or both

of the subject names either in an

effort to

erase a derogatory back-

ground or,

more likely, to assume a new identity and attempt to con-

fuse the issue.

(2)

Still in connection with Subject's true name,

deliberately withheld information when he made out his PRQ for

JMWAVE in March 1963.

The PRQ specifically calls for

"name at birth

if different from Item 1"

(Item l being Subject's full name).

VOLSKY marked the item as not applicable.

The slight discrepancy in education listed in paragraph

3 b should be checked into.

2010130725

(4) On 8 February 1963 Headquarters reported Jorge VOLSKY

probably identical with one Joseph SKULICZ "although this still

questionable",

(DIR 16243 dated 8 February 1963).

•Station traces on SKULICZ and further mention of this tentative

identification was never made by Headquarters.

(5) Still to be explained by VOLSKY are the circumstances

surrounding his imprisonment

in Russia and his joining the Polish

Army Service there at a time when Soviet intelligence was attempting

to subvert those recruits..

4.:

Background in Cuba Prior to U.S.

a. Family

(1) VOLSKY reports in his PRQ that on 7 August 1948 in

Havana he married his present wife,

Mercedes ROVIRA Bertran.

Immigration and Naturalization Service (I&NS) in Miami has a copy of

this marriage certificate on file which confirms the marriage date

given above

and gives the following information:

The full name of VOLSKY's wife is Mercedes

Antonia Juana/*ROVIRA Bertran, daughter of Jose ROVIRA and Mercedes

BERTRAN, natives of Spain.

(b)

VOLSKY is listed as Jorge Ajbuszyc VOLSKY, son of

Jose and Maria, natives of Poland.

(c) From 1937 to 1938 Mercedes was listed as a student

in Santiago de Cuba and from 1938 to 1961 as a housewife in Havana:

(2) Thé fact that Mercedes ROVIRA says

she was a housewife

• in Havana from 1938 to

1961 does not coincide with the story told

above to the effect that during the war years she was the single

daughter of Jose ROVIRA in Santiago de Cuba, engaged to Jorge VOLSKY.

It

is possible that she mistakenly put the year 1938 instead of

1948 on

her record.

However,

that leaves ten years of her life

unaccounted for in

the Immigration records.

b. Business

Jorge VOLSKY reported in his PRQ that he directed and

owned his own business in Cuba from November 1947 to May 1961 when

he left for the United States.

This business, whichhe described as

a publicity office was named Dekora Studio S.A., P. Gomez 283, Habana,

and was subsequently confiscated by the CASTRO Government.

also told AMLAME-I that in addition to his publicity business in Cuba,

he had rendered services to the Information

Service of the United

States Embassy in Habana. The following reports on VOLSKY's business

publicity business which engaged mainly in the production and

decoration of floats for carnivals.

that the ROVIRA family

helped him financially to set up this business.

Mrs. QUESADA reported that the ROVIRA family was

very wealthy as they were the proprietors in Cuba of the CASTILLO RUM

and CINEMA REX enterprises, among others,

and that Mr. ROVIRA put

VOLSKY to work in a decorating firm which he owned.

(c) Aureliand I*sBRETON, formerly in the advertising

billboard business in Cuba, reports

that when

Studio Dekora was

nationalized VOLSKY was working on a large advertising plan for

Central America ordered by the Coca Cola bottling plant in Cuba.

...

Contacts and Travel

(1). VOLSKY traveled frequently while in Cuba and amassed an

extremely large number of influential contacts. He was a member of

the Havana Biltmore Yacht and Country Club and predominately

class professional industrialists and

particularly

cultivated the friendship of American journalists.

(2) According to his PRQ, VOLSKY traveled to Europe in 1957

on a

pleasure trip at his own expense and also had traveled to the

United States many times during the years he lived in Cuba. He also

listed frequent travel to Jamaica.

d. Politics

(1) During the period before his business was nationalized,

VOLSKY is described as a socialist, who had publicly said that the

future of the world is socialistic. He was avidly pro-CASTRO and

had often denounced the United States for putting up with the BATISTA

Government in Cuba which was riddled with graft, (AMOT-119 Report

AA -774/1?, September 1962) :

According to Tad SZULC, see Paragraph 5 below, VOLSKY

became disenchanted with the Regime

when his business was intervened

the latter part of 1959 and most of 1960 actively

supporting anti-CASTRO activities.

SZULC amplified this remark by

knew of instances of VOLSKY's transporting explosives and

hand and shoulder weapons in his private car.

(3) VOLSKY was arrested and imprisoned in La Cabana prisen

around 20 April 1961 during the Invasion

roundup,

an event he has

made much of ever since and has used to establish counterrevolutionary

'AMBLEAK-1, who was imprisoned during the same

period,

stated.that VOLSKY was

held for a short time,

a matter of weeks,

probably had been included in this roundup because he was a known

"MRP member; foreigner,

or member of the middle class.

According

Tad SZULC,

VOLSKY was

able to leave Cuba shortly thereafter as he had

a valid U.S. visa in his passport. VOLSKY arrived in Miami on

22 May 1961

5. JMWAVE Knowledge of VOLSKY Relationship with Tad SZULC

a. On 17 September 1962 AMOT-119 presented a report to KUBARK

which contained information to the effect that VOLSKY had influence

with certain elements of the American press, especially the New York

Times and the Washington Post.

This influence was derived from

in particular

A close relationship exists between

saule in Washington and VOLSKY in Miami and they are in touch

periodically by both telephone and personal visits. VOLSKY iS a

source of information for SZULC and evidently influences his thinking

as is manifested by the transfer of VOLSKY's political philosophy

into the principal thesis of a book on Cuba written by SZULC:

that Cuba should not be attacked by the United States and that the

Cuban problem can be solved internally. This book entitled, The

is mentioned in paragraph 2.a.:

Tad SZULC presented to ODACID

in operational plan based on VOLSKY's ideas which was subsequentl

turned over to KUBARK.

SZULC was contacted by KUBARK on 6 February

1963 concerning this plan and gave the following information concerning

the background of his relationship with VOLSKY, whom he reported as its

author.

VOLSKY has been a friend of his for the past three years

and he (SZULC) considers him one of the most informed exiles on Cuban

internal affairs and

stated that he was, in fact, his contact for most

of his important information emanating from inside Cuba. He referred to

"our man in Havana" even though he was living in Miami.

SZULC reported that VOLSKY, by virtue of his advertising

business, had traveled extensively throughout the provinces of Cuba

and had made many friends before said business was intervened.

been able to keep these internal contacts and passes on information

obtained from them to SZULC.

Among the most important of his contacts

is AMSTRUT-2; a lifelong friend of VOLSKY's sister-in-law (unidentified)

what SZULC considers vital information by means of this

friendship to VOLSKY.

In August 1962 SZULC had arranged an interview in Washington

fOr VOLSKY with Richard N. C

GOODWIN

advisor to former President KENNEDY.

In late October 1962 AMBLEAK-1 had reported that VOLSKY called

upon him to assist him in rounding up recently arrived refugees who

had. Seen Soviet missiles and

troops in Cuba.

It was VOLSKY's purpose

to have AMBLEAK-1 serve as interpreter for interviews of the refugees

by correspondent Tad SZULC.

Tad SZULC reported that he had a standing invitation extended

since November 1961 to contact directly President Kennedy His opinions

Vice President

Johnson, or McGeorge Bundy at any time on Cuban matters.

obviously carried weight with the Aministration and therefore,

backing of VOLSKY's plan, to the point where he sat in on ODACID/KUBARK

meetings concerning it

was probably the primary reason it was adopted

so quickly.

VOLSKY and SZULC maintained a mutually profitable

relatsonship, VOLSKY by providing SZULC with up-to-date information

obtained through his USIA position and through his contacts in the exile

VOLSKY's ideas.

As SZULC

could exert his influence and indirectly pressure KUBARK

into adopting an operation, so could he apply pressure through his media

to run certain details pertaining to it.

The following example shows

the position KUBARK was maneuvered into

by these influences.

the principals of the subject operation, AMICE-27,

whom KUBARK wished

to remove from said operation because of his indiscretion and inability

to accept control, but who was an informant on all aspects of the oper-

ation for VOLskY and SZULC, had to be handled with kid gloves and

offered a juicy alternative position in an effort to appease him as it

was felt that he would take his case to SZULC.

The time picked by KUBARK

to disengage AMICE-27 was one when SZULC was on an extended Latin America:

AMICE-27 refused the substitute position, delivered an ultimatum

which was not accepted by KUBARK, and, as expected highest authority

was reported by a

teammate to be threatening to take his case to the

through the VOLSKY/SZULC channel. It was JMWAVE's feeling that AMICE-27

understood power and politics to the extent that once he became aware

that SZULC would not be available for immediate consultation, he would'

be willing to reopen his discussions concerning an alternative position

This he did subsequently.

The next step

for himself with KUBARa: his situation was to attempt to assuage VOLSKY

taken by JMWAVE to ease

who was cold and uncommunicative at first, obviously upset over the

dismissal of AMICE-27 and, at the same time, temporarily cut off from

his powerful Washington channel. However, this treatment released the

pressure, diverted a case which might otherwise have been presented to

SZULC,

and obviated a situation which might otherwise have been diffi-

cult and embarrassing for KUBARK.

VOLSKY and SZULC were in very frequent contact with each other

during the MWAVE sponsorship of the VOLSKY plan.

This fact was

ascertained through VOLSKY's comments to a JMWAVE case officer in

which he often referred to recent activities of SZULC and through the

reactions. of SZULC and VOLSKY when any decisions concerning the opera-

tion made by Headquarters or JMWAVE were relayed to one member of this

partnership without the knowledge of the other.

Decisions concerning

the operation handed out by Headquarters and JMWAVE had to be given

simultaneously to SZULC and VOLSKY in order to avoid misunderstandings

which would arise when one would immediately inform the other of same.

It is mere speculation to guess whether there is more to this

relationship than that mentioned in paragraph 6.e. above.

interesting to note, however,

that on 6 January 1964 in a conversation

between AMICE-14 and a JMWAVE case officer concerning language abilities,

AMICE-14 remarked that VOLSKY and SZULC always speak together in Polish.

When asked if they conversed in Polish so that no one would be able to

understand them, AMICE-14 replied that he thought it was just to practic.

the language:

This fact does not agree with VOLSKY's earlier statement

to COS, IMWAVE that he preferred not to speak in Polish because

not used the language for a long time.

It seems strange that VOLSKY

would refuse to speak his native tongue with COS unless he were afraid

that his accent or pronunciation would disclose some element of his

background which he did not wish so disclosed.

On 20 February 1964, Chief of Station, JMWAVE, had luncheon

with Conrad MANLEY, Chief of the

of USIA.

During this

that osky was tie setticial stringer for szure of the Times and

in a discussion of VOLSKY, MANLEY stated that he was aware

that his superior in Washington had recently brought this relationship

to his attention, asking MANLEY to discourage it.

The reason for this

was that several newspaper personnel in the Washington area had com-

plained to USIA about the preferential treatment afforded SZULC by his

relationship with VOLSKY.

The most recent information indicating that the SZULC/VOLSKY

relationship continues is a letter written on

23 February by Theodore

DRAPER, well known author and political analyst, to Miss Phyllis FREEMAN

Frederick A. Praeger Publishing Company,

(Reference B) •

letter DRAPER recommends that VOLSKY be chosen

as the author of a book

to be written on Cuba and set up an appointment for him to meet FREEMAN

while he was in New York.

Reference B also includes a memorandum in

which FREEMAN, reported that VOLSKY was highly recommended for this job

by both Theodore ,DRAPER and Tad SZULC who rely on him for much of their

day to day information on Cuba.

she stated that VOLSKY "is now a

"stringer' for the Washington bureau ef The Times, which is evidently

a special SZULC-engineered deal"

AMCARBON-1 reported on 24 May 1964

that VOLSKY receives $100 a week for his work as a stringer. In regard

to VOLSKY's forthcoming book, he has mentioned to AMBLEAK-1

that he

expects to have it published in September 1964 under the title of Cuba

(Note:

In reference B, Phyllis FREEMAN has indicated that

VOLSKY claims that he was educated in England and that he had gone to

Cuba in 1945, a decidedly different version of his background.)

6. • VOLSKY's Knowledge of the Cuban Exile Community

a.

VOLSKY Refugee Status and Personal Life in Miami

In a recent conversation with AMLAME-1 VOLSKY stated that

he had become an American citizen.

(2) A check of Immigration and Naturalization Service records

in Miami shows that VOLSKY is not a citizen of the United States as he

but became a permanent resident on 5 February 1963, and that

claims's wite, Mercedes ROVIRA, had petitioned for this status for him.

AMBLEAK-1 reported that VOLSKY lives with his in-laws,

He is inordinately fond of his

of JURE, had issued orders to infiltrate a trusted JURE member into

to learn the details of any plans with regard to Cuba

and if possible to use the contacts of Jorge VOLSKY for this since he

knew more than ten agents of KUBARK operating in the Miami area who

had been coming to him to gather reports emanating from Cuba.

might be of interest to KUBARK, responded with the name dose AGUIAR and

let slip that he was a member of JURE. The case officer felt that

VOLSKY also stated that it was his understanding that

RAY said

"KUBARK agents are more dangerous than the KENNEDY Administration as

tween CISNEROS and VOLSKY in which they discussed a propaganda campaign

against Batistianos to be launched soon thereafter.

AMOT-119 learned on l November 1963 from Max

LESNICK

Menendez, editor of REPLICA newspaper, that JURE pays for REPLICA's

printing

and that LESNICK immediately

gives a copy to Jorge VOLSKY as

soon as it is published.

(JMWAVE traces on LESNICK, 201-209258, show

tendance at PSP and Ortodoxo leadership meetings.

The purpose of the

newspaper, REPLICA, is to counter pro-BATISTA propaganda in the Cubar

exile community.)

LESNICK told AMTAUP-2 that the Americans are degen-

erate because they give money to homosexuals such as AMCORE-2 and

refuse to help him (LESNICK) and that he

would take his case to Harvey

SUMM, Department of State Representative in Miami.

(g) On 30 July 1963. Harvey SUMM contaated the Chief of

Station, IMWAVE, by telephone in an effort to persuade IMWAVE to

SPONSOX HASNICK's radio program, "Cuba Despierta"

, taped in Miami and

broadcast daily from the Dominican Republic.

SUMM stated that both

he and USIA thought that LESNICK had a worthwhile radio program and

asked COS if he could insure that LESNICK receive the necessary funds

to stay on the air.

COS informed Mr. SUMM that JMWAVE had access to a

number of radio outlets and if he or USIA had a propaganda theme or

basic message they wanted delivered to the Cuban people,

KUBARK would

be glad to accommodate them if this material were in keeping with the

broad policy concepts under which JMWAVE was currently operating.

SUMM stated he was not interested in themes or programs, he was merely

interested in finding a sponsor for LESNICK and became irritated when

IMWAVE would not comply with his wishes.

He indicated that he intended

to check further on the matter to determine why KUBARK would not

has relatives in Cuba (BOSQUE)!

(i) On 8 January 1964 Esteban'

in USIA, reported to AMTAUP-2 that VOLSKY urgently requested that LAMELAS

take a poll among the arriving Cuban refugees to determine what they

think of JURE so that he, in turn,

could report the results to Manolo

RAY in order to determine whether

JURE's propaganda policy should be

changed.

LAMELAS said that his

involved in such a poll; he informed A-2 that this was not the first

time VOLSKY had used USIA for JURE propaganda.

Ail stated that

picked the "so called Cuban leaders that attended the meeting".

•(a) On 13 July 1963 CISNEROS approached Esteban LAMELAS

Maura and requested information from and concerning Cuba in order to

facilitate the infiltration of JURE members into Cuba.

When LAMELAS

refused to give that type of information, CISNEROS said he would see

(b) On 8 January 1964 AMTAUP-2 reported that VOLSKY called

Jose AGUIAR Fernandez to his USIA offices to interview two refugees who

were interested in receiving training and returning to Cuba to fight

CASTRO: AGUIAR Fernandez told A-2 that VOLSKY spotted refugees for

leads and submitted reports on them to JURE.

He added that VOLSKY

diverts refugees from contacting or reporting any information to KUBARK

Fight CASTRO.

Apparently these contacts had no clandestine overtones and A-1 in his

position as UR liaison officer found nothing remarkable about his visits.

In late April 1963 A-1 began working with various members of the UR

including AMICE-27, Mario SEIGLIE Montoro, and Eduardo SOTOLONGO Medina

a paper on the solution to the liberation of Cuba.

showed this plan to his JMWAVE case officer,

who disliked it as he felt

it would whip up UR enthusiasm for the development of an active clan-

destine arm within the UR and that this was not desired.

On the night

of I May 1963 A-1 gathered with AMICE-27 and others at his home to work

on the draft again.

A-27 took the draft home with him, stating that he

just wished to polish it up a little.

The following morning A-27 called

A-l and said that he had had a lucky idea and had passed the paper to

VOLSKY who was an experienced writer of policy papers and who liked the

paper very much.

VOLSKY told A-27 that he would get in touch with

AMBLEAK-1 directly to discuss the paper.

After about a week of phone

calls from VOLSKY, A-l agreed

to see him and

subsequently met him and

received his original paper back.

A-1 then began

to be plagued by

visits from VOLSKY at the UR offices plus phone calls in which VOLSKY

entreated. A-1 to take the paper to Harvey SUMM.

(2) On 18 July 1963 at a meeting between VOLSKY and a JMWAVE

case officer,

Vousky stated he had recently undertaken to assist the UR

in the propaganda field.

He said that the UR was starting a new daily

radio program over a New York radio station, lasting twenty minutes a

that: it will be specifically tailored to attempt to increase

to resist within Cuba and particularly attempt to reach the

higher military echelons. VOLSKY said he had originally written all

the VOA broadcasts for over a year after he came to Miami and that he

therefore could greatly assist the UR with their new program. Asked

whether the UR had anybody to write the program or whether he would

actually write it himself, VOLSKY said that the UR has one good man but

that he himself expected to have a major hand in editing the program.

He said that because of this he was spending a great deal of time at UR

Headquarters.

(JMWAVE Analysis) VOLSKY is in contact with a large segment of

the influential members of the exile community.

This is the consequence

of his USIA position which affords him the opportunity. to make these con-

tacts to solicit information for propaganda purposes.

AMING-2 reported

that VOLSKY is on a first name basis with many of the leaders of counter-

revolutionary groups whom he frequently phones or sees in his office.

agent although he has no facts upon which to base his opinion.)

As seen from

the foregoing, VOLSKY has maneuvered himself into a remarkably advan-

exile matters. According to VOLSkY his motivation is clear, he claims
