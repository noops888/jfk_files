MIMORANDUM FOR CI/RMO

SUBJECT:

Response to FOI Request 75-150

1. The Agency's response to Paul L. HOCH's request

for certain records in the OSWALD case should contain the

following points:

a.

Mr. HOCH should be inforned that Harren

Commission Documents (CD) 347 and 384 cannot be declassi-

fiod in whole or part at this time dus to the continued..

sensitivity of sources and the revelation of our nethods

of operating.

b.

The attachnent to CD 1287 which is an affi-

davit of MI. Helms was previously released to the public

domain and is availablo at National Archives. No have

reviewed the menorandun which transmitted the affidavit

and conclude that it, too, can be declassified.

Mr.

Hoch is welcome to a copy of the transmittal nemorandum

and to the affidavit.

c.

which was proviously released to the public domain in

of the man in that CD is not of OSWALD but of the unidenti-

fiod man in the photograph which was later shown to OsHaLd's

mother.

we should reiterate to MI. Hoch that when we

furnished to the FBI the photograph of the unidentified

man, we had no photograph of Lee Harvey OSWALD. OuT

assumption that the unidentified man in the photograph

vas OSHALD WaS an eFTOr which can be attributed only to

the sense of urgency of the nonent and the excitement

prevailing at the tihe of the assassination.

The unidenti-

thad man in the photograph remains unidentifiod.

The

personal description that was furnished was also in error

and did not portain to Lee Harvey OSWALD. It was, of course,

the description of the unidentified man.

kir. Hoch should also be advisad that the

information no furnished to the Warren Comnission on the

Albert Schweitzer College and USWALD's relatlonship with

chat school, as based on Ch 321 and CD 818, 1s not classI-

fied and is includod in the larIon connission'& report,.

Voluse XVI, Pp. 621 - 637. The Commission's report, as a

satter of fact, contains even more information than we had

on that school.

Ne shall be pleased to furnish Mr. Hoch

the data pertaining to the school in the form of excerpts

fTOn CD 321 and CD 818, 1f

he wishes.

z.

The information on the lapruder filn which Mi.

Hoch requested is in the possession of the Pictorial

Services Branch of CRS and they have been notified that a

response from then will no doubt be requested through

regular fOl channels.
