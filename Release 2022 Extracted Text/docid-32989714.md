MEMORANDUM TO ALL BUREAU OFFICIALS AND SUPERVISORS

(A) COMMUNICATIONS TO FIELD OFFICES -- Communications of any

type sending instructions to field offices should be short, clear and sim-

ple. Use telegraphtype language. Reference prior communications to

avoid needless repetition of previous instructions.

(B) UTILIZATION OF LIAISON SECTION -- A reduction in the number of

Supervisors handling liaison with other Government agencies makes it

necessary that the time of the remainder be utilized most efficiently to

permit the productive handling of contacts with those agencies.

It is de-

sired that Supervisors refrain from designating mail for delivery by

Liaison unless a reason exists for such designation. Mail should and

will be delivered by Liaison if it requires discussion with or delivery to

a high-ranking official of another agency, if its sensitivity requires

specidi kaniling, üi if its content requires some explanation or romment.

In the absence of some such reason, mail should be designated for deliv

ery by the Courier Service or by regular mail.

Dissemination of Bureau reports and memoranda to other Govern-

ment agencies is the responsibility of the substantive Supervisor, and not

of the Liaison Section. Transmittal form 0-14 should be used whether

such dissemination is being made by Liaison, by Courier Service, or by

regular mail. Transmittal forms in the 0-14 series, sometimes referred

to as form routing slips, contain blocks to be checked which will inform

the addressee that no further investigation is contemplated, that the other

agency will be advised of pertinent developments, that the status of the

case is complete or incomplete, and that the item or items are being fur-

nished for the information of the addressee. The last notation is some-

times checked without any indication as to the status of the case or whether

further material may be expected, resulting in later inquiry from the ad-

dressee.. It is desired that when this form is utilized, it be fully executed.

Il a Liaison Supervisor is being asked to pass information orally

to another agency, he should promptly be furnished an appropriate letter-

head memorandum or other communication which will confirm his oral

dissemination. Do not send serials to Liaison with a routing slip asking

"please handle" or "please pass information to --."

Affirmative contacts are being discontinued with twenty-four

agencies with which we have relatively few interests in common. Liai-

son Supervisors will, however, continue to handle urgent matters re-

quiring personal liaison with those agencies. Supervisors should con-

tinue to designate for the Liaison Section tickler copies of memoranda

discussing matters involving other Government agencies, and consider-

ation should be given to discussion of such matters with the Liaison

representative prior to preparation of memoranda in order that full facts

concerning our relations with the other agency may be ascertained.

Matter's involving our relations with other agencies should be coordin-

ated, wherever possible, with the Liaison Supervisor at the outset.

Very truly yours,

John Edgar Hoover

ke my memorandum dated 7/15/70 in which I pointed

out that liaison was being discontinued with 65 agencies and

that six Agents from the Liaison Section are available for

reassignment. I contemplate using five of the six Agents

some of

the existing vacancies in the Domestic Intelligence

Division which have been approved for filling.

The sixth Agent

will be used to staff the midnight to 8 a.m. Shift. This shift

has previously been

filled on

in the Division but

the increased correspondence engendered

Iby the reduction of liaison will not make it possible for

the

"Sections to spare a man for this shift.

I certainly agree with the Director that contacts

with the agencies with which we will continue liaison can in a

great many instances be made by telephone and this was considered

in my request ior the reiention vi linee ageuts to perioim teuroon

with the agencies indicated in my memorandum. Even then, because

of the tremendous volume of business we have with these agencies,

it will be necessary for

the Section Chief and the Number One

Man to both perform active liaison functions outside the office,

Ivisiting, as the other men do, the approved agencies.

These liaison contacts with whom we would be doing

business by phone must be developed and maintained by persoual

contact and because of the substantial turnover in agencies,

new contacts must be constantly developed on a personal basis.

These remaining liaison men will also have to act as alternates

for one another during periods of leave or illness and where

emergency situations arise that require handling of an item when

the regular liaison Agent is otherwise engaged. The 1iai5on

S1 HJ8.CT :

DISCONTINUANCE OF LIAISON FUNCTIONS

Pursuant to the Director's instructions, I have carefully looked into dis -

continuance of liaison functions and resultant release of Agent Supervisory personnel

for reassignment. I have reviewed the Director's instructions (pertinent memoranda.

attached) and have conferred with various Bureau officials.

The Director instructed liaison be restricted to White House, Vice President

and National Security Council. Domestic Intelligence Division (DID) listed 65 agencies

* being eliminated from liaison contact but also respectfully suggested continued liaison

Servilate, Aix Force, Army, Navy, Secret Service, Intermal Revenue and Civai

DID feels that some disadvantage or possible criticism could result from

a discontinuance of liaison with these key agencies.

At this point possible criticism or problems are anticipatory. Obviously

- .:

we will be alert to such possibilities, and if problems arise, we will meet them and

take such steps as are necessary to solve them. We ran always modify our

procedures when it is in the Bureau's interests to do so. Furthermore, there appear

to be no question but that almost all business and necessary dissemination can be

handled by teletypes, letters, dissemination memoranda, or by telephone with con-

firmation in writing if necessary. Emergency or unusually delicate situations can

be handled by direct contact.

For above reasons, we should immediate jarscontinue liaison service

with all agencies except White House, Vice President, and National Security Council.

'Our teletype network to key agencies and our regular courier service will provide

expedite transmission. An emergency, such as a threat against the President, can

be handled by phone with confirmation by letter. DID can prepare necessary in -

structions

and guidelines to implement our new procedures. Nine Agent Supervisors;

including a Section Chief, will be made available for other assignments:

Mr. Sullivan also proposed one of Agents released from liaison be

designated permanent night supervisor on midnight to 8:00 Aze shiftIlDID which

is presently filled on rotation basis. Sullivan points out additional correspondence

anticipated because of reduction in liaison, making it more arffeult for various units

to spare men for midnight shift on rotation basis. There may be an increase but it

is impossible now, to determine exact extent. DID should defer this request for 90

Memo for Mr. Tolson

Re: Discontinuance of Liaison Functions

Mr. Sullivan pointed out in his memorandum (attached) that there are

•5 vacancies in DID (none at Section Chief or # Man level -- SA R. L. Shackelford •

was promoted to Chief of Internal Security "Section from' Unit Chief level).

Vacancies

are as follows: (!) Three in New Left Groups Unit, one caused by the promotion o

SA Shackelford -- replacement requested but not yet approved ~- and two based on

request for additional personnel to handle sharply increased work load involving

violence-oriented groups. Two from Inspection Staff have been ordered under

transfer in. Transfers being held in abeyance. (2) One vacancy in Racial Intelligence.

Section based on request for additional supervisor to handle increased work load re

black militant groups -- approved and Agent under transfer in from Los Angeles.

(3) One vacancy in Subversive Individuals Unit caused by transfer of SA S. S.

Czarnecki to the Inspection Staff. Replacement approved but transfer in not yet

ordered.

In addition, there are 4 immediate vacancies in other Divisionat seat of

Government: two in Special Investigative Division and one in Crime Records

Division (Inspection Division memoranda recommending replacements attached).

In addition, there is Section Chief vacancy in Administrative Division.

OBSERVATIONS:

Remaining functions will be liaison with Whiie House, Vice Fresident ai

* National Security Council plus supervision of Legal Attache Offices and related

: matters. These duties are now being handled by three Agent Supervisors. This is

not enough to justify continuance of Section; however, a new unit could be established

for administrative control consisting of Unit Chief and three Agent Supervisors." Unit

Chel would administer unit and also be responsible for irregular contacts with key

agencies to maintain effective relations and to resolve and avert incipient problems.

These matters have been discussed with Mr. Sullivan. While he does not

agree with extent of proposed cutbacks, feeling we should maintain liaison with

certain key agencies as set out in his previous proposals, he advises DID will

vigorously strive to effectively implement the new procedures.

It these proposals are approved, a total of nine Agent supervisors will be

removed from liaison, thus reducing approved DD Agent complement from 124 to 115.

Nine Agents being released from liaison assignment can be assigned as follows:"

for existing vacancies in DID; 2 transferred to existing vacancies in Special

Investigative Division; SA Bernard C. Rachner has been transferred to field; and

Section Chief Brennan to Administrative Division at no change in grade or salary

to replace Section Chief C. Q. Smith, who is retiring effective 7/31/70 (this has

been coordinated with Mr. Mohr and Mr. Callahan).

It is felt the vacancy in the Crime: Records Division can best be filled

experience in Crime Records Division.

with other agencies has been handled by the Liaison Super-

We propose to advise the agencies that any requests

section by telephone or mail and

I that requests dealing with

matters

special situations arising with respect to coordination of matters with other

U.s. agencies.

SA Haynes will handle liaison with the White House, Vice President and

National Security Council.

SAs Flemister and Bermingham will continue handling foreign police

cooperation cases, coordination of Bureau Legat operations and visits of

foreign officials who are contacts of our Legats. SA Flemister's area of

responsibility in foregoing is the European area and SA Bermingham's is the

MR. FELT

FROM . : MR. KINLEY

SUBJECT: Liaison Section

DATE: June 29, 1972

I would appreciate your observations and recom-

mendation on the following suggestion:

For many years, FBIHQ had a Liaison Section

which maintained official liaison with the head-

quarters

of other governmental departments and

agencies in Washington, D. C. The discontinuance

of that Liaison

• Section resulted in an attempt by

the washington Field Office to handle many inquiries

of high-level officials of those departments and

agencies.

It should be noted, of course, that this

office of necessity maintains

liaison on

a relatively

low level with all governmental departments and

agencies to insure the prompt referral of cases and

to handle matters pertaining to the effective

operation of this office in the District of Columbia.

I feel that a reinstitution of the Liaison Section

in FBIHQ would place the high level fiaison with

other agencies at the headquarters level where it

would obviously be more effective.

nation outside your Committee.

SUBJECT:

LIAISON SECTION

You requested my observations and recommendations with regard

to the re-establishment of the Liaison Section,

The Liaison Section was broken up in July, 1970, and since that time

necessary and desirable liaison with other Federal agencies has been handled

by written communication as well as by direct contact with persons at various

levels at lie Bureau with their counterparts in the other Federal agencies.

When the Liaison Section was discontinued it had grown too large and represented

a waste of manpower. 10 Agents, not including a Section Chief, were engaged

in handling domestic liaison with

sone 8i different agencies, many of which

obviously were of minor importance to our operations. Since that time necessary

liaison has not been handled as much by Washington Field Ofice as you indicated as

by supervisors and officials in FBIHQ. Washington Field Office's liaison with

other agencies relates almost entirely to the handling of leads and the Bureau's

routine business with those agencies.

...

I believe we could more efficiently and effectively handle our business

with the other major Federal agencies if we re-established a Liaison Unit of limited

size to handle only those agencies with which we have the greatest amount of traffic.

I propose we have a five-man Unit under the Chief of the existing Special Coordination

Unit (L. F. Schwartz);

SA Robert H. Haynes is currently in that Unit handling liaison with the

White House, the Vice President, and the National Security Council! To his

assignments we should add Secret Service;

SA John E. Manning currently assists tie Unit Chief in handling telophone

inquiries. He could-be assigned to handle laison with the following.

Memo for Mr. Kin ley

Re: Liaison Section

SA B. C. Rachner currently in this Unit could handle liaison with:

Department of State

Immigration and Naturalization Service

Treasury Departm"ent and related agencies with exception of

Secret Service

A 4th Agent could handle Central Intelligence Agency and related committees:

• U. s. Intelligence Board

Signal Intelligence Committee

Security Committee

Watch Committee

Technical Surveillances Countermeasures

Interagency Defector Committee

A 5th Agent could handle:

National Security Agency

Atomic Energy Commission

U. S. Postal Service

Department of Transportation

Under the above proposed arrangement we would have five Agents handling

the major agencies with which we regularly need to resolve problems and handle

the greater volume of our business elating to other agencies. This Unit could be

effectively supervised by its present Chief (Schwartz) and would function under

A. J. Decker, Jr., Chief and G. A. Day, Number One Man of the Nationalities

Intelligence Section. Both Decker and Day are highly competent for this kind of

supervisin and administration, it being noted that Day is our top expert on liaison

matters, having served as Number One Man in the old Liaison Section. Two other

supervisors in the Unit (R. A. Bermingham and H. C. Flemister, Jr.) would

continue to handle foreign liaison, to which they are presently assigned, including

the supervision of Legat operations. A third Agent would need to be added for

supervision of foreign liaison to replace Rachner, who is now engaged in these

rise is

RECOMMENDATION:

That the Special Coordination Unit be renamed Liaison Unit and organized

along the lines indicated above with Unit Chief Schwartz; 5 Agents handling domestic

liaison, and three Agents to handle foreign liaison. I approved, this would require

the assignment of three additional Agents to this Unit.

SUBJECT: LIAISON SECTION

This memorandum is in response tour. Gray's

comments concerning your memorandum to Mr. Kinley 6/30/72:

Mr. Gray asked for a review of current and past liaison

procedures.

The supervision of our foreign liaison representatives

was not affected by the conversion in 7/70 of the Liaison

Section to the Special Coordination Unit. That responsibility

continues to be handled in the Special Coordination Unit in

the same mainer as it was handled in the former Liaison Section.

This memorandum, therefore, is addressed to the question of

the Bureau's domestic liaison gnerations.

Former Liaison Section

The objective of the Liaison Section was, through

the development of high-level contacts in appropriate U. S.

agencies, to insure that the Bureau's business with those

agencies was accomplished promptly, effectively, economically,

and with a minimum of jurisdictional or policy problems.

By the establishment of effective liaison contacts, we sought

to recognize and solve minor problems before they became

major problems requiring protracted and/expensive negotiations

between the Bureau and other agencies.

Procedures under Liaison Section

The objectives cited above were achieved by placing

seasoned Büreau representatives of broad experience in contact

with officials at the highest lovels of other agencies where

the Bureau either

ndeded help or hat concurrent interests,

In the former Lizison section; ten Agents maintained linison

with approximately 81 U.S. agencies including major intelli

gence agencies,

the military, other major departments, bureaus

and! commissions and many lesser agencies. They frequently

visited the major agencies, developed a broad knowledge of

their operations and established a close personal rapport with

i high-level officials in those agencies. For example, in matters

of major importance the linison Agent could make immediate

personal contact with "Cabinet officers, directors of bureaus and

many other officials of the highest level..

tions required interviews of persons of this caliber, the inter-

views would be handled by the liaison Agents in order that the

interviews could be accomplished without delay and with a

minimum of inconvenience to the official involved. Many of these

high-level contacts were the result of years of development by

the Bureau liaison representatives and through them we were able

to obtain assistance which might otherise have been difficult

or impossible to obtain. Some examples of this type of support

National Security Agency-One of the Bureau's

secure telephone systems was provided and

installed by this Agency at no cost to the

Bureau, a

savings of approximately $150,000.

Through'high-lovel contacts in this Agency,

we have also been able to secure the results

of its technical research which might have

been difficult or expensive to obtain through

other sources.

Post Office-Our close association with the

Chiet Postal Inspector and his top officials

has resulted in that agency providing support

in some of our most delicate intelligence

operations looking to the identification of

illegal hostile intelligence activities in

this country.

State Department-In addition to providing

at no cost to the Bureau another secure

telephone network and making available to the

Bureau worldwide cable facilities of the State

Department, our high-level contacts in this

Department

have on many occasions assisted in

the speedy.resolution of complicated.investigative..c...

problems both in the criminal and security fields.

An. excellent example would be the support provided

by the Passport Office of the State Department in

identifying James Earl Ray as the assassin of

Martin Luther King.

Memorandum E. S. Miller to Mr. Felt

Re: LIAISON SECTION

Military Agencies-The military intelligence

agencies have consistently provided excellent

support to the Bureau in both the security and .

criminal fields.

Much of this is due to the

high-level liaison contacts developed over the

years with these agencies. In the Yablonsky

murder case, the military provided, on very

short notice at no cost to the Bureau, ar

expert diving team which was able to locate

one of the weapons involved which was an

essential piece of evidence in this crime.

Likewise, the military has been able to provide

a wealth of deceptive information to be used

in our double agent operations directed

against

Soviet-bloc intelligence agencies.

Immigration and Naturalization Service

Through high-level contacts with this Service,

we have been able to arrange with a minimum of

compiicated paper work the speedy deportation

of persons entering the United States who are

considered to be threats to the internal security,

such as Arab terrorists sent to the United States

on assassination missions.

In many other instances: through close established

Jiaison, we were

able to avoid the development of situations

in other agencies which could have resulted in operational

problems for the Bureau.

Our liaison, for example, with the

President's Commission on the Causes

and Prevention of

Violence and the Commission on Civil Rights provided advance

information concerning possible publications or statements

by those commissions which could have reflected adversely

on the Bureau.

Under these procedures, the Bureau, liaison repre

sentative would be visiting the agencies assigned

to him on

a frequent basis so that officials.of. those agencies would '"'"i

be able

to aiscuss potential policy problems with him

wbefore making them a 'matter of formal correspondence vith

the Bureau.

In many of these situations, the Bureau liaison

representative, being fully conversant with Bureau policies

and

procedures,

would immediately resolve the question to

the satisfaction of both the Bureau and the officiàl of the

other agency without the necessity of getting into expensive;

Re:

LIAISON SECTION

Special Coordination Unit

Objectives of the Special Coordination Unit, while

similar to those previously stated for the former Liaison

Section,

are necessarily. less broad and are directed more

towards

facilitating the resolution of problems raised by

other agencies than producing effective action by other

agencies on behalf of the FBI.

Procedures under Special Coordination Unit

Under the current setup, two Agents assigned to

the Special Coordination Unit are handling our domestic

liaison work. One of these is assigned to liaison with

The White House, the

• Vice President, and the National Security

council. He is

backed up by the other Agent who also attends

meetings of various intelligence committees and assists the

Unit Chiet in handling inquiries from other agencies doing

business with the Bureau.

We have been able in our current system to carry

on an effective liaison operation primarily because of the

quality and number of high-level contacts which had been

developed under the previous Liaison Section system.

Although effective, this has really been a holding operation

largely

dependent upon the existing reservoir of well

developèd contacts. Due to transfers and retirements in

the most important agencies with which we do business, our

established contacts have been deteriorating so that we

are approaching

; the point of diminishing returns.

This

• situation could be reversed if we

had sufficient man power

to visit the more important agencies, renew old contacts and

establish new ones.

Costs

In measuring the cost of a domestic liaison operation,

the only measurable cost is the total salary for personnel

involved. Liaison Agents are normally selected from among

Supervisors of GS-15 caliber ($25, 583-$33,260) ; that is, men

who have the ability and experience required to handle a

Unit Chief's job or a job of similar responsibility. Based

on current median salaries, there is set out below a comparison

of the annual salary cost of the former Liaison Section and

the current Special Coordination Unit. In considering these

figures, it should be recognized that the section Chief and

Number One Man in the former Liaison Section, and the Unit

Chief in the present Special Coordination Unit devoted only

part of their time to domestic liaison, and also supervised

the coordination of our offices abroad and the investigation

of the many "Foreign Police Cooperation" cases handled in

the United States in reciprocity for the work done for us

abroad. The former Liaison Section also handled other

matters, now absorbed elsewhere, such as emergency planning

and the Bureau's participation in the NATO Special Committee.

I recommend re-establishment of a Liaison Section on the

restricted basis outlined above. The Liaison Section should maintain

smooth and continuing contact with top officials in the intelligence com-

munity and related departments. We would not change in any way very

effective liaison maintained by other divisions with Congress, Budget

Bureau, Civil Service Commission, Department of Transportation in

connection with hijackings and security matters, etc. This action would

eliminate any remnants of criticism concerning our liaison. We would

set up strict guidelines and carefully select our personnel to insure that

we would get the type of liaison outlined above. We would guard against

it becoming a mail courier operation.

I recommend the re-establishment of the Liaison Section

and the adding of three additional agents to implement this.

SUBJECT: LIAISON SECTION

Mr. Gray's approval of the re-establishment of a Ifaison section

included an instruction that the section not supervise offices overseas and in

foreign countries. As this work is so basic to the responsibilities of a

liaison section, I am respectfully presenting several points for Mr. Gray's

consideration in the hope that he will reconsider this prohibition.

The supervision of the foreign offices is handled by three men

who reviey the correspondence with our Legats. resolve their numerous

problems -and handle their many contacts win visit Washington. The latter

also visit other United States agencies while here, requiring coordination which

can best be arranged by a domestic liaison supervisor familiar with the

agency in question. In addition, some of the foreign agencies with which

our Legats are deeply involved maintain representatives in Washington.

These include RCMP, MI-5, MI-6, and the Australian Security Intelligence

Organization. These foreign representatives regularly visit the Bureau

to discuss the various requirements which have been made of them by their

headquarters. The foreign liaison supervisors simply do not have the time

to handle these persons in'addition to their regular work, and this responsibility, -

which for many years was handled in the front office of the former liaison section,

is now temporaxily being handled in the front affice of the section to which the

foreign liaison sunervisors are attached. The processing of the requests made

by these men and the discussion of their problems with them is a matter of

basic liaison and should logically be handled by whoever will be in charge

of the new liaison section. The courtesy and attention which is given to:

the requests made by these foreign liaison representatives in Washington

"is reflested in the treatment which their headquarters affords the requests

made:by.our Legal Attaches:

Memorandum E. S. Miller to Mr. W. M. Felt

Re: LIAISON SECTION

with other agencies is handled by domestic liaison supervisors dealing with

those agencies. In similar fashion the British will not furnish derogatory

information directly to the Department of Defense in connection with its

background-type investigations but require that such data be channeled

through FBI. These are just two of the instances in which a foreign liaison

.. matter becomes a domestic liaison matter and should be under the same

supervision.

Our foreign offices are necessarily closely involved in the

operations of several U. S. agencies and require domestic liaison with those

agencies. Our many problems surrounding the establishment and maintenance

of foreign offices have to be coordinated with the Department of State. It is

essential that we know and have access to the proper official at State in order

to solve problems faced by the Legats as without prodding State moves very

slowly. Our foreign offices work closely with the Central Intelligence

Agency(CIA) stations abroad. CIA Headquarters does not permit its overseas

stations to disseminate information to other agencies overseas, including our

Legats, except in unusual circumstances. They frequently, however, suggest

to our Legats that CIA Headquarters be asked for particular items. These

can most rapidly be secured by direct request from a domestic liaison

supervisor. In a number of areas, our Legal Attaches work closely with

local representatives of the U. S. military. Leads are passed to our Legat

which are then followed up by liaison contacts in Washington with the appropriate

military headquarters.

Liaison, or, in other terms, the establishment of a harmonious

relationship, is basically the same whether practiced in Washington or Tokyo.

I feel that it would be to the Bureau's advantage to have our liaison operations

closely coordinated and directly supervised in the same area. This has proved

to be an efficient and productive arrangement in the past, and we believe that

the re-establishment of limited direct liaison in Washington should be händled

oy the same

supervision which has been given to our posts abroad. The work in

both areas is primarily intelligence oriented, yet does not fall within the

normal responsibilities of the present operational sections. It is considered

that we should not leave the foreign supervision in its.present area; which is

fully occupied with Arab terrorism, Chinese espionage, ard Cuban, Arab,

Chicano and Jewish extremists. A logical and economical step wouls be to

make the present fercion linison supervision an integral part of the new

JIaison section. Under this arrangement, the foreign liaison sunervision

SUBJECT LIAISON SECTION

--

Since I think my recommendations to you may possibly be

the source of the confusion that appears to have resulted from your

order approving the reestablishment of the Liaison Section, this

memorandum is written in an effort to dispel the confusion,

When the recommendation was made to you to reestablish a

Liaison Section, I recommended you reestablish the Section but the Section

as reestablished should not operate in the same way as the old Liaison

Section had operated, according to my understanding.

Specifically, i recommended that tha reconstituted Section should

have responsibility only over liaison with other agencies and should not

operate out of the Domestic intelligence Division (DID). I suggested that

the proper location within the Bureau for the new Section might be an

appropriate topic for discussion at an ExecutivesConference meeting.

Supervision of foreign Legats, which supervision had been

included among the responsibilities of the old Liaison Section, would,

under my proposal, continue to be handled within the DID and thus would

not be handled by the reconstituted Liaison Section.

This recommendation was based on the assumption that the

foreign Legats have seen their responsibilities increased in recent years

to include the collection of political intelligence information for dissemination

to DI., Kissinger and others. I they are going to do intelligence work, it

seemed appropriate for them to be supervised by the FBI's intelligence

division,

You ordered that the new Section net supervise offices overseas

and in foreign countries. If this order was in any way based upon my

recommendation to you, my recommendation stould not have been accepted

unless you were also prepared to order that the new section would not,

• operate. out of the DID.

Headquarters liaison is entirely different from field

operations and requires a thorough knowledge both of the problems

and policies of the domestic and foreign fields and of the opera-

tions of the major agencies here in Washington with which we have

interests in common. Day has had extensive liaison experience,

having served as Number One Man of the former Liaison Section and

having handled top liaison assignments prior thereto. He is cur-

as Number One Man in the Nationalities Intelligence

Section, in which Section the present Special Coordination Unit

supervision, and the FPC matters.

Schwartz was assigned to the previ-

ous Liaison

Section and has an unusually wide personal acquaintance

with both top and working level personnel in other U.S. agencies as

well as having represented the Bureau on several of the

U. S. Intelli

gence Board Committees. Prior to dissolution of the Liaison Section,

he was given a special citation by the U.S. Air Iorce in appreciation

for the liaison which he was then maintaining with that service.

Schwartz has recently been handling the numerous telephone calls irom

other areas of the Executive Branch and has thereby continued his

relationship with other agencies.

In addition to a highly successful

and productive career at Headquarters, Schwartz directly supervised

in the New York Office the then highly important investigation of the

New York State Communist Party and its membership prior to his assign-

ment in Washington.

GS-15: Will handle

Liaison with the white House, Office of the Vice President, foreign

Intelligence Advisory Board, National Security Council, and Bureau 01

He handled the Bureau's liaison with

the White House, Office of the Vice President, and the National Secu

rity Council for a number of years in the old Liaison Section and was

continued in this assignment by the former Director after the Liaison

Section was dissolved. Haynes also has a wide range of contacts in

many other agencies, both military and civilian. He, too, has repre-

sented the Bureau on a number of security type committees. In addi

tion to his

experience in the Executive Branch, Haynes was selected

for and served with the investigative staff of

the House Committee on

Appropriations, discharging his responsibilities in highly commendable

fashion.

For a number of years, McDonnell handled our liaison with NSA and

was directly responsible for some of the major contributions NSA

has made to FBI work. He fis widely known and respected at NSA and

other agencies with which he has dealt. He is currently SIC of a

..unit within the Nationalities Intelligence Section. He had broad

supervisory experience in New York Office prior to transfer to FBIHQ,

serving as supervisor of the major case squad in the Criminal Section,

and subsequently of the Satellite

Section handling Soviet-bloc

espionage matters.

He later became Number One Man to the SAC of

the Espionage Division of the New York Office.

Internal Revenue, Customs, and Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms). In

the old Liaison Section, Rachner maintained liaison with State

Department and Secret Service.

He enjoys a first-name relationship

with the Secret Service Director and has an

encyclopedic knowledge

of State, including contacts at all levels. He is currently assigned

to the roreign Liaison

Desk where many State Department officials

Further, liaison is not conducted inside the office and we believe

that each of these men should report directly to the Section Chief

It is proposed that the men be designated liaison supervisors without

It should be observed that the newly constituted section

will not interfere with the specialized liaison currently maintained

by other divisions and will not attempt to handle liaison across the

board with all other departments and agencies in the Executive Branch,

but, rather, will concentrate on those agencies having the most mat-

of mutual interest with us and with which problems are most apt

to arise.

cerning this matter outlined this

in some detail. Specific guidelines

in detail above, the balance of the section will, as approved by

DATE:

FROM : W. M. FELT

SUNJECT: PERSONNEL CHANGES

You previously approved the establishment of a Liaison

Section and the purpose of this memorandum therefore is to submit

the names of candidates to fill the position of Chief of this Section.

On 10-11-72 available members of the Personnel Selection

Board met in my office, consisting of myself and Messis. Walters, Miller,

Bishop, Callahan, Dalbey, Jenkins, Conrad, Baker and Bates. In view of

the pending transfers of SACs Kunkel and McDermott, I did not invite them

to attend the meeting; however, in the future I intend to utilize the services

of nearby SACs.

With the exception of Assistant Director Baker: all members

have recommended the following 3 employees and they are, in order of

preference, SA Graham A. Day, ASAC James J. Dunn, and SA Homer A,

Boynton. Mr. Baker recommended, in his order of preference, SA Boynton,

ASAC Dunn and SA Day.

1. SA Graham A. Day, No. 1 Man, Nationalities Intelligence Section, DID.

He entered on duty 1-4-43, is in Grade GS-15, age 60, married, 2 children,

He reported to DID 11-11-54, served as No., 1 Man of the former Liaison

Section from 3/61 until 7/70 when the section was disbanded and since 5/10/72

has served in his current position. Mr. Day's age, length of service at FBIHQ

were carefully considered during the meeting; nevertheless, with the exception

of Mr. Baker, the others present, including me, feel that Day is without a

doubt the most qualified employee to fill this particular position. He has had

vast experience in liaison work and even in his current position has continued

: to directly supervise both domestic and foreign liaison functions. He has a

thorough knowledge of the problems and policies of the domestic and foreign

fields and of the: operations of the major agencies here. in Washington, He

1s without doubt the Bureau's top expert on liaison matters and lie has many

top-level contacts in Government. It was also pointed out that during the

critical initial stages of re-establishing our liaison functions it is essential

that the man heading the section be exceptionally strong in this field and Day

certainly fulfills this requirement.

SUBJECT:

LIAISON SECTION

Mr. Gray has approved the reconstitution of the Liaison

Section and has appointed SA Homer Boynton of the New York Office

as the Section Chief.

In line vith this and pursuant to Mr. Gray's

request that Section personnel be selected who have had previous

Liaison Section experience, I have prepared the attached organi-

zational chart indicating the new personnel and their assigmments.

Lach of the Domestic Liaison Supervisors, with one exception, was

assigned to the former Liaison Section; each is currently assigned

to this Division and no replacements are being requested; and each

has had at least twenty years'

experience in the FBI with wide

experience both in the field and at FBI Headquarters. My memo-

sandum 9/27/72 contained full details concerning these men and

their assignments

The

appointment of SA Boynton has necessitated

some changes and the following is a summary of the anticipated

assignments:

that the new section Chies be given the benerit of the most expe-

rienced assistant available to provide knowledge and background

Washington with which the new Section will deal. SA Day was

-SUBJECT: LIAISON SECTION

In line with the re-establishment of the klaison

Section, as approved by Mr. Gray in my memorandum of 10/19/72,

• I am recomnending that the 10 Supervisors assigned to this Section

be given the title of Inspector with no change

in pay for the

duration of their liaison assignment and be authorized to use

personal cards for official business as needed.

The men handling both our domestic and foreign liaison

contacts for the Bureau have been carefully selected on the basis

of their background and experience to effectively represent the

Bureau at the highest levels of

important foreign and domestic

agencies. All of these men will be meeting fremantly with it. s.

and foreign officials of the highest rank, which will include

Cabinet officers, Ambassadors and heads of important domestic and

foreign agencies.

In order to carry out their assignments in the most

effective manner, I believe that it is important that these men

be recognized as

much as possible by the officials they are con-

tacting as key representatives of the FBI. This procedure has been

roLlowed in the past with regard to the two Bureau representatives

handling our liaison with Congress and the American Bar Association,

both of whom carry the title of Inspector. This has been found

to be highly beneficial in assisting these individuals in fulfilling

their important liaison responsibilities and I feel it should be

equally helpful

to the men of our new Liaison Section who have been

selected to handle our domestic and foreign liaison assignments.

Memorandum E.S. Miller to W. M. Felt

Re: Liaison Section

ADDENDUM ADMINISTRATIVE DIVISION

11/24/72

There are currently 36 Special Agents who have credentials with

title of Inspector. Most are Number One Men to Assistant Directors or to

Acting Associate Director or assigned to Inspection Division. About six or

seven carry the title of Inspector so as to give them stature as Bureau

representatives above the rank of Special Agent in keeping with their duties

requiring them to represent the Bureau in significant contacts in the

Congressional, diplomatic, Government agency, business, and private sectors.

Although I feel the issuance of Inspector's credentials should be restricted as

much as possible, the duties of our liaison agents are such as to qualify them

for the tomporary title of Inspector for the duration of their liaison assignment

and at no change in grade or salary. Upon reassignment from liaison duties

authority to carry Inspector's credentials should be automatically terminated.

ADDENDUM W. M. FELT

11-27-12:

I have carefully considered the information submitted by Domestic

Intelligence and Administratiye Divisions as to the conferring of the title

• Inspector on the 10 supervisors currently assigned to the Liaison Section,

However, I do not feel that the best interests of the Bureau will be served

in the long run by taking favorable action. I am convinced that to accede

to this request would result in similar requests from other divisions, many

of which would appear to be as justified as the issue currently in hand.

In the long run therefore, we would, in a sense, be lessening the importance

of the Inspector's title in the Bureau.

Moreover, I can also foresee problems in reassigning a man from

such duties and removing the Inspector's title from him. Such action would

be in the form of a demotion in accordance with the Veterans' Preference

Act which specifically states 30 days advance written notice must be furnished

to an employee if he is reduced in grade, salary or rank. If we were to

advise an employee that this title was temporary and would be in effect only

for the duration of his current assignment we would still have to abide by the

law in giving the employee 30 days' advance written notice. Therefore, in

considering all ramifications of this matter, approval is not given to the

recommendation.

MEMORANDUM FOR MR. SULLIVAN

I have given very careful consideration to your memoranda of

rune 7, 1971, and June 16, 1971, together with the memorandum of

1971 nitlalled by you; mi

september 22, 1970; Mr. Brennan's memorandum of September 21, 1970,

nitlalled by you; and also Mr. Child's memorandum of May 23, -909:

sIlices and the problems incident thereto, together with the recommendations

of Messrs. Dalbey, Felt, and Beaver upon

• the recommendation made in your

nemorandum of June 7, 1971, suggesting the closing down of a number of

the foreign liaison offices, some of them recently established last December

with your approval.

First and foremost, I want to clarify a point you have raised in

your memoranda, namely that our loreign lalson utter, waul the encertur

of Mexico City, are not operational and that we cannot develop "hard, high

quality, positive intelligence by sending men to these countries only in a

liaison

capacity."

We do not have the legal right to establish any foreign

offices on an operational basis.

SUBJECT. EXPANSION OF FOREIGNJLIAISON

On 10/12/71 I met, at their request, with Ämbassador

and Research, Department of State,

and P. Glynn Mays, also

of the Department of State but assigned to the National

Security

Council, Under Secretaries Committee, Also present WaS sA

Graham A. Day of this Division.

The State representatives advised that the Director's

letter of 9/20/71 to Secretary Rogers requesting clearance for

six new liaison posts abroad had been

referred to the Committee

for clearance. As part of their normal procedure, the views of

the affected Ambassadors were solicited with the result that a

number of questions were raised.

State is currently in the process

of effecting a five per cent reduction in U.S. personnel overseas

and each Ambassador was concerned with

the proposed increase in

the personnel complement with which he is charged.

Several

Ambassadors asked

what information might be given

to the host

government and others inquired as to why their post had been

selected.

Both Coerr and Mays appeared to be genuinely cooperative

and indicated that they merely wanted our assistance: in preparing

brief material which might be forwarded to the Ambassadors as'

a general response to their inquiries.

They were pleased to

learn that a number of the new posts will be, in effect, acting

as regional offices, covering more than one country. No question

was raised, and of course no comment was made, concerning the

dévelopment of high-level intelligence and it

was explained that,

as in the case with our other posts, our representatives will be

establishing and maintaining liaison with the police and other

investigative agencies of the countries visited in order to

expedite and insure the thorough handling of leads abroad arising

from the Bureau's domestic investigations.

It was explained that three of the new posts (Manila,

Rio de Janeiro and Santo Domingo) represent a reopening of

offices formerly in existence and that only one post (New Delhị)

will be in a country not previously covered.

They did not, however, indicate:

how much time this might involve.

In response to their inquiry we have prepared a

Dear Ax. Irwin:

Ambassador Wymberley Coerr and Mr. R. Glynn Mays

of your Department have asked for additional details with

reference to my letter of September 20, 1971, to Secretary

Rogers.

Specific questions were raised concerning the

location of the proposed new posts aná concerning our

method of operation when they are established.

In goneral, our need for additional liaison

abroad stems from the constantly increasing travel abroad

of United States citizens under investigation in this

country.

for example, Just five

a total of 853 persons

wanted in

che United states were

located through requests initiated by our legal Attaches.

In fiscal 1971, 2369 such persons were located. In Iiscal

gese, slightly more than 5300,000 in property stolen in the

United States vas located abroad; while in fiscal utty ..

nearly $1,500,000 of such property vas so located. In

response to earlier programs aimed at reducing United states

personnel abroad, I closed our posts at lanila, Rio de Janeiro

end santo Domingo and endeavored to cover those areas by

i road trip from other posts. This has resulted in inevitable

..delays and in materially increased travel costs. As a

result, when the President asked that I increase our liaison

activities abroad, I

suggested the reopening of these three

posts.

Our method of operation at each post will continue,.

as in the past, to include the developpent and haintenance

has become apparent that prompt coverage

can only be secured through direct and

continuing liaison with the investigative

agencies of this huge country.

SANTO DOMINGO, DOMINICAN REPUBLIC

This office, originally opened day 21,

1965, was closed March 18, 1969, as an

economy measure and coverage has been

maintained by Agents assigned to the FBI

office in san Juan, Puerto Rico. It is

proposed that the Agent assigned to

santo Domingo will initiate coverage in

Haiti. There is a considerable population

o1 Dominican exiles residing in the

United States who continue to be involved

with the various poiiiicai luctions in tho

Dominican Republic, thereby creating

problems of IBI interest in connection with

the Neutrality Act,

the Foreign Agents

Registration Act and other matters alfecting

Internal security interests.

• To a smaller

extent, this is also true of Haiti.

Although my request for this limited expansion

was nade at the specific instruction of the President, I

know that he would not sanction an operation which was not

economically worthwhile. You may be assured that, as 1n

che past, these new posts will be carelully supervised anc

prompt action taken should it be determined either thal

their continued existence is not warranted or that additional

assistance is necessary. I hope that it will be possible

for you to secure the requisite clearances in the near future.

EXPANSION OF FOREIGN LIAISON

on 11/2/71 we called Mr. R. Glynn Mays, who is

assigned

by the Department of State to the National Security

Council Under Secretaries Committee, and inquired concerning

when we could expect a response to our letters of 9/20/71

and 10/14/71 regarding the opening of six additional foreign

liaison posts.

Mays stated that Bureau letter 9/20/71 had been

referred to the National

Security Council Under Secretaries.

Committee as that group is responsible for the establishment

and alteration of overseas personnel ceilings.

Inasmuch as

each U. S. Ambassador is a personal representative of the

President

and is not subservient to the Department of State,

inquiries were sent to the six affected Ambassadors regarding

their concurrence in our proposal.

Each of the Ambassadors

responded by raising

various questions concerning such

matters as what information might be given to the bost

government, FBI

methods of operation overseas, and reasons

as to why their particular post had been chosen. These

inquiries resulted in the visit of Ambassador Wymberley Coerr,

Deputy Director

of State's Bureau of Intelligence and Research;

and Mr. Mays to the Bureau on 10/12/71 as reported in my

memorandum of that date.

As a result of that memorandum,

& detailed letter dated 10/14/71 was forwarded to Under

Secretary of State John N. Irwin II furnishing specifics.

concerning our overseas operations and our reasons for

selection of the posts involvea..

Mays stated that upon receipt of the second letter,

individual responses were prepared and forwarded to each of

the six Ambassadors who had raised questions.

Replies are

still pending, and Mays said he knew no way of hurrying the

Ambassadors short of telephoning them. It was pointed out

to him that nearly a month and a half

had elapsed since the

original request, which had been made at the instruction of

the President. He was asked to communicate our concern at

SUBJECT: EXPANSION OF FOREIGN LIAISÓN

R. Glynn Mays of the Department of State who has

been handling, on a working level, our request to expand our

foreign liaison telephoned 11/4/71.

He stated that the

affected Ambassadors had been canvassed again for their :

concurrence

He explained that basically Sed a number of additional questions.

the Ambassadors were chafing

at a request for expansion at a time when the Government is

in the throes of additional contraction in its overseas posts,

and

he indicated that a number of the Ambassadors had pointed

out that there are existing arrangements under which FBI

leads can be handled in their territory and they do not under-

stand, based on the small volume of work they have witnessed

in the past, why FBI wishes to station a man in the territory

full time.

With reference to our request to open in Kuala

Lumpur, Malaysia, he said he would like us to authorize him

to emploro tho rossibility of opoting in singapore as ar

alternative.

He stated an overwhelming percentage of the

personnel in the American Embassy at Kuala Lumpur are actually

Central Intelligence

Agency representatives, and the Ambassador..

felt there should be no further addition of

security/repre-

sentatives.

Mays said that Ambassador Coerr, who had visited

the Bureau with Mays 10/12/71 to discuss

our request, had

suggested that there be a further discussion at which the

numerous questions raised by the Ambassadors could be dis-

_cussed.

Mays asked whether Assistant Director Miller and/or

another Bureau representative could come to the Department...

of State on 11/8/71 so that other interested State officials

could participate in the discussion.

Mays was told that the

request we had made was, as he has previously been informed,

He was told that we felt

no useful purpose would be served by further discussion of

operational details but that if the Department of State

had questions it desired answered, it should address them

to us in

writing and we would deal with them in an appropriate

manner.

We made no comment concerning the proposal to

exchange Singapore for Kuala Lumpur actually, the two points

ale very close and we see no objection to the change).

Mays said he understood our position and would

relay'it promptly to his superiors. He indicated that the

United Nations Chinese problem and the Congressional action

concerning foreign aid had occupied the full time of the

top personnel at State with the result that they are not

familiar with the latest developments surrounding our

frequest. It is quite apparent that unless we call a halt

as we have done in our discussion with Mays today, we could

continue conferences and discussions endlessly without

achieving our objective. With reference to the implied

questioning of the volume of FBI work in the new areas, it

should be noted that our selection of the locations for the

new posts was based not on work load but on potential for

production of high level intelligence of interest to the

White House. This has not, of course, been included in

either our letters to State or our discussion with its

representatives.

SUBJECT: EXPANSION OF FOREIGN/LIAISON

As instructed, I met on 11/24/71 with Stäte Under

Secretary John N. Irwin

II; Deputy Under Secretary William

B. Macomber, Jr.; his Executive Assistant, Samuel

R. Gammon;

Hymberley Coerr,

Deputy Director, Bureau of Intelligence and

Research; and R. Glynn Mays of State's Methods and Systems

Staff.

I was accompanied by SA Graham A. Day of this Division.

Mr. Irwin, who was unable to stay for the entire meeting,

stated he was most appreciative

of the Director's rapid

and

cooperative response to his request for further discussion.

He pointed out that he has a

tremendous respect

for the Director

and for the organization which he has built and has instructed

his personnel at State to do everything in their power to

Iulfill the FBI request. He notod that the request did, however,

represent a substantial

problem for State and that he had

asked for discussion because of

the difficulties which State

had encountered.

State is fully aware of President Nixon's instruction

that FBI liaison activities be expanded.

The President has

also, however, instructed that the official profile of the

United States

be lowered abroad and that a five percent

across-the-board reduction in United States overseas personnel

be made.

Coming as it does on the heels of President Johnson's

• fifteen percent reduction and President Nixon's earlier ten

percent reduction, this has created serious staffing problems

in each U. S. Embassy.

As the Ambassador's concurrence is

necessary before any new personnel can be sent abroad, each

of those potentially affected by our expansion was consulted

by State and each one raised serious objections. Some, as

will be indicated below, questioned the necessity for an Agent

to be stationed in their countries and several, pointing to

the current expansion of the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous

Drugs, which is also being strongly resisted, asked why one.

Justice representative could not represent both agencies.

As a result,

both Mr. Irwin and Mr. Macomber asked that we

take a hard

look at our proposals

to see if some adjustments

could be made which would result in a smaller overall increase

in our overseas-personnel.

Memorandum E. S. Miller to Mr. Rosen

Re: EXPANSION OF FOREIGN LIAISON

I pointed out that there would be no possibility

of our "doubling up" with Narcotics investigators, explaining

that our functions and methods of operation are totally

different and would actually be incompatible in some areas.

noted that our modest request had actually been scaled

down before it was forwarded to State and that we had limited

each office to a singlé Agent with only one Clerk-Stenographer.

I referred to the detailed explanation for our request which

had been furnished in our letter of 10/14/71 to Mr. Irwin

and stated that we would not have made the request if we

had not felt it fully justified and responsive to the

President's instruction. I said that we would, however,

carefully consider each part of the request once more to

see if there was any way in which the total number of

personnel

involved might be reduced.

It was agreed that following this

review, we would meet again for further discussion during

the week of November 29, 1971. Comments and

• recommendations

concerning the specific areas follow:

Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

The Agency for International Development Mission

here has been withdrawn in the face of local criticism of

U.S. efforts to influence the Brazilian Police.

We have

been covering this enormous country from our office in

Argentina on a 2,500 mile round trip basis. No criticism

has been made of

our liaison contacts with the Brazilian

Police or other agencies,

and we feel we should insist on

reopening our office here. By reducing our staff in

Buenos Aires by one

Agent and one clerk (which we intended

to do anyway), reopening this office will result in no

Increase in personnel.

Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia

There is an abnormally large percentage of Central

Intelligence Agency personnel here on both an overt and covert

basis,

and the addition of another investigative agency is

feared by the Ambassador as objectionable to the Malaysian

Government which is endeavoring to maintain a neutral position.

State asks that we let them explore the possibility of opening

In singapore

instead of Kuala Lumpur.. Singapore is extremely

close and is actually a better location from the standpoint

of travelers both east and west as Singapore is a normal

international aviation stop.

We believe Singapore would be

just as good a location as

Kuala Lumpur and recommend that

State be asked

to make

the necessary arrangements without

further delay.

As indicated in memorandum 11/29/71, we had an

appointment to discuss our expansion

further with Deputy

Under Secretary of State Macomber at 3:30 p.m., 11/30/71.

At noon on 11/30/71, Mr. Macomber's office advised that he

had been unexpectedly summoned by the Secretary of state

to a meeting which would occupy the balance of

the afternoon,

and we were asked to postpone our discussion until 12/2/71..

I stated that I was quite anxious to resolve this matter

without further delay and asked to meet with other state

representatives to discuss our proposal as originally planned.

Accordingly, we met with Ambassador Wymberley Coerr, Deputy

Director. of State's Bureau of Intelligence and Research;

Samuel R. Gammon, Executive Assistant to Mr. Macomber; and

R. Glynn

Mays of State's Methods and Systems Staff. I was

accompanied by SA Graham Day of this Division.

• I stated that the staffing problems encountered

by State had been explained to the Director and that, in

an effort to cooperate, he had authorized us to materially

reduce our initial request.

I said that we would agree to

Singapore in place of Kuala Lumpur as suggested by State,

and we would cancel our request to open offices in Canberra

and Santo Domingo.

I pointed out that we would staff our

office in Rio de Janeiro by reducing our present staff in

Buenos Aires and that we were therefore requesting, in effect,

only six additional positions abroad (3 Agents, 3 clerks) in

plage of the original 12, from which we would open offices

the possibility of our opening there in place of Kuala Lumpur.

of Manila, possibly covering. the Philippines from Canberra.

In addition, Mr. Mays said that the Ambassador in New Delhi

iri had expressed doubt whether there was. sufficient EBI work ID

India to justify stationing a man

there. Mays asked for

figures which State could use to support our request.

I stated that we were faced with a situation in

which the President had, on September 20, 1971, asked the

• Director to expand his

liaison operations abroad and that

here we were more than two months later without having taken

a single action in direct response to the President's instruction.

I pointed out that it seemed to me that the President's instruction

Should take precedence over any Ambassadorial question and

that I saw no point in

becoming involved in quibbling with

individual Ambassadors in efforts to justify doing what the

President had asked. Ambassador Coerr said that he understood

our position perfectly and State would proceed to correspond

with the Ambassadors further. He did ask that we present

the special prohlem of Manila for determination by the Director.

With respect to Manila, we have a fair volume of

work there now which we do not have in Australia. Further,

we do not feel it would be feasible to cover Manila from

Australia because of the distance involved, and we want to

leave our office in Hong Kong free to concentrate on the

greatly enlarged Chinese problem.

We feel, therefore, that

despite the Ambassador's objection, we should insist upon

reopening our office in Manila.

ACTION: If approved, we will inform Ambassador Coerr that

his proposal that Canberra be substituted for Manila has been

reviewed by the Director and that he feels, as he did when

he approved the reduced proposal, that it is essential for

us to reopen our office in Manila. We will also tell

ToDoRovICH the same thing:

I again re-

quested the name of

. the Agent.

He arain declined to give it. to

I very"emphatically told TODOROVICH that untii he gave me

the name of the Agent who supposedly gave him and FRITz, this in-

formation, that I would not believe that either he or FRITZ had

been given any information such as this by any Agent of this

Bureau and this was based on the fact that no Agent would have

any reason natsoever to nake such a statement since we had

not conducted any investigation in this matter nor did we

have any information concerning RIHA and, therefore, we would

not be in a position to make such a statement as to whether or

not RIHA was all right.

I then also pointed out to Mo. TODOROVICH that if he-

gave the information to Mr. MC KEVITT and advised Me. MC. KEVITT

the information had come from an FBI Agent and if Mo. MC KEVITT

contacted me I would certainly advise him that the information:

did: not come from anyone in the FBI for the same reasons as

set, forth above.

I am enclosing, for the Bureau's information, an

article which appeared in the February 11, 1970, issue of The

Rocky Mountain lews, a Denver newspaper.

Towards the end of the article it reports that

MC KEVITT had received an official denial from "a Washington source"

that any of the official

agencies which have been named in

connection with the RIHA case actually had any knowledge of

where RIHA is now.

The source, according to the article which

MC KEVITT refused to identify, also said RIHA was not involved

in espionage of any sort and that none of these agencies

have ever told anyone in Boulder, Denver, or elsewhere that

RIHA was alive and well.

The article points out the most frequently mentioned

agencies have been the FBI, CIA, Military Intelligence agencies

and the U. S. INS.

OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR

26 february 1970

dentia

The Honorable J. Edgar Hoover

Director

Federal Bureau of Investigation

Washington, D. C.

Dear Mr. Hoover:

Mr. Papich has orally informed me that you wish io have the

identity of the FBI agent who was the source of certain information

communicated to an employee of this Agency, Mi. Michael T'odorovich.

This information regarding the disappearance of one Thomas Riha was

in turn passed to Dr. Joseph Smiley, then President of Colorado

University, Boulder, Colorado, now President of a university in El

Paso, Texas, and to the District Attorney of Denver, Mr. James

McKevitt.

In view of your personal interest in this matter, I instructed

Mr. Todorovich to report to me in person.

I have revicwed this complicated case in detail with Mr. Todorovich

and have requested him to reveal the identity of his source. As a point

of honor and personal integrity, Mi. Todorovich was adamant that he

could not disclose the identity of his source. Under further pressure

from me, Mi. Todorovich maintained his position, stating that in de-

fense of it he was prepared to submit his resignation immediately.

Mx. Todorovich éxplained that the Riha/Galya Tannenbaum cases

had been given extensive news coverage, much of it being sensational

in nature. He stressed that there was embarrassing public speculation

as to the possible involvement of the CIA and the FBI in Riha's

disappearance.

Warned

actido

tenanty.

The purpose of Mr. Todorovich's conference with the District

Attorney of Denver was to solicit his good offices to remove pres-

sures and the possible serving of a subpoena on Di. Joseph Smiley.

He also sought to orient the District Attorney properly so that he

would not continue to have an erroneous impression of the roles of

the CIA and the FBI, thereby eliminating further adverse publicity.

Mr. Todorovich affirms that before going to District Attorney

McKevitt he called upon the FBI Special Agent in Charge, Mr. Scott

Werner, and sought to coordinate with him our respective interests.

He also solicited Mr. Werner to accompany him to the District

Attorney.

Mr. Todorovich states that Mr. Werner refused absolutely to

cooperate in this matter.

Instead, Mr. Werner engaged in an oral

exchange during which he remarked that our representative in

Boulder was "lying" and then proceeded to challenge the veracity of

Mr. Todorovich. Subsequently, Mr. Todorovich conferred with

the District Attorney alone. He was successful in persuading the

District Attorney to make a favorable public statement which had

the effect of putting this issue regarding Di. Smiley and other rumors

to rest as far as the public was concerned.

I have carefully reviewed the statements of Mr. Todorovich.

I feel that poor judgment was employed in passing the information in

question to DI. Smiley and later to the District Attorney. This should

only have been done with specific FBI approval. I wish to assure you

that I do not condone violations of the third agency rule, and I am

taking steps to impress once again this elementary fact upon all Agency

officials.

With regard to Mr. Todorovich, I have no reason to doubt that

he has acted honestly.

I believe that he has reported to me in good

faith.

He is sincerely interested in preserving a sound working

relationship between the CIA and the FBI. Nevertheless, because a

situation of this sort adversely affects the relationship between the two

agencies, I am taking administrative action in this matter with regard

to Mi. Todorovich.

While the following is not pertinent to your request, my review

of this case suggests the advisability of a re-examination of Riha's

disappearance and past activities and, necessarily, the Tannenbaum

case.

Briefly, since 1958 we have commuricated to your Bureau

significant information which relates to Riha's involvement with

Czech and Soviet intelligence services, when he was behind the Iron

Curtain. I attach for your information and convenience copies of

pertinent reports regarding this aspect of the case.

I hope sincerely that this recent incident will not impair our

mutual efforts in making certain that we have not overlooked factors

possibly having a significant bearing on U.S. intelligence and internal

security interests. I shall pursue this matter through our respective

liaison offices.

In closing, Mr. Hoover, I wish to state

that this Agency can only

fully perform its duties in the furtherance of the national security when

it has the closest coordination and teamwork with the Federal Bureau of

Investigation. Furthermore, it is necessary that we continue to con-

duct our business in an atmosphere of mutual respect.

I trust that we

can coordinate closely any future developments or actions in these cases,

in order to prevent the airing in public of conflicts or differences between

the two agencies. I feel strongly that there are representatives of the

news media who are eager to exploit alleged differences on a national

scale. Disturbing as this experience has been, I wish to thank you in

the interests of our common cause for having communicated with me

in such a forthright and candid manner.

ATTACHMENT

SUBJECT: Ritzi, Thomas

1. The January 1970 receipt of information from

your Bureau that Mrs. Ruth Ann COOK,. Thomas RIHA's

mother, had mentioned rinars uf her son's work for CIA

in letters to the SAC, Denver, caused us to verify the fact

RIHA has never been employed or used operationally by

this Agency.

2. In 1958 and 1959 you were provided information

that RIHA, when transitting Prague en route to Moscow,

was contacted by Czech Intelligence and asked to remain in

the CSR.

Later in 1958 Czech Intelligence introduced RIHA

to the KGB in Moscow and our source reported RIHA accepted

certain privileges from the KGB while asserting he would not

become a spy for the Soviets. Details reported by our source

about RIHA's KGB contacts did not emerge during a 1960 BI

interview of RIHA.

3.

This indication that RIHA may not have been truthful

in 1960, when added to our current knowledge about KGB interest

in recruiting American exchange students and RIHA's 1968 trip

to the USSR, suggests the circumstances of RiHA's disappearance

might be i'e-evaluated. This Agency is reopening its file on this

case in view of the information disclosed in the attachments.

: RIHA, Thomas

I. The following report concerning an attempt by a

member of Czech Intelligence to effect the repatriation of

subject, a naturalized American bast-west Exchange student,

to his country of origin was recently submitted by a source

of this office.

8...

2. Source first became acquainted with Subject during

the past year at The

Russian Research Center, Harvard University.

On 10 September 1958

he ran into Subject by chance at the SAS

office in Vionna as the two boarded a

SAs flight to Conenhagen

via

Duesseldorf.

During the trip Subject disclosed the

101loning to source which nas been supplemented trom

intormation from our files.

3.

RIHA, who was born in Prague, Czechosiovakia

17 April 1929, is one of the twenty American students

selected for the East-lest Exchange Program and will be

studying in the USSR

for the 1958-59 academic year. Files

in this Agency indicate that RIHA arrived in the U. St on

15 July 1947 and became a citizen in 1952.

4.

Our source informed is that put had gone to praulis

June of this year, to see his father and other relatives:

father and mother

are divorced and according to information

in our files, his mother is listed as Nrs. Ruth 1-.c00k.

Berkeley 4, California.,

address: 2023 Etna streets n

5. RIHA told our source that when he arrived in Prague

he was put into a Government hotel for three days before he

was allowed to stay with his relatives and friends. During

this time, and perhaps later, RIliA was accompanied through

the city

by a guide whom he

described as a "Government

Official" name unknown, who attempted to effect Subject's

repatriation to Czechoslovakia. RIllA told our source that

this man has sot up an appointment (date and address unknown)

to meet

him in Moscow

to talk further.

Subject told our source that this "Government

Official" did not mention Czech Intelligence or Security

Forces as such

and that he (RIHA) is not too worried

concerning this contact. RIMA apparently feels that it

is the price he must pay in order to study in the soviet

Union and once he gets deeply into his studies in Moscow

he feels that he can plead that he is too busy with his

academic work to have contact with any officials.

Our

source also stated that RIHA is in some kind of correspondence

with the Czech official. We have no description or name for

the Czech official.

7. It is requested that no further dissemination be

made of this information without prior clearance from this

office, and that our source be fully protected in the event

that contact is made with RIHA.

1. Reference is

made to our CS CI 3/751,690 of

27 October 1958 concerning an

attempt by a member of Czech

Intelligence to effect Subject's repatriation while the

latter was in Prague in June of 1958 visiting relatives

en route to study in Moscow during 1958-59 as

an East-West

Exchange Student.

The following report describes further

action taken by the KGB

in Moscow to cultivate Subject, and

was recently submitted by a sensitive and reliable source.

Sometime in December 1958, Subject again met

the

Cech Official no hau triod to have Sübject copatriaic to

According

to our source, it

was apparently an accidental

meeting at a Moscow railroad

station as the Czech was returning to Prague.

The Czech was

delighted to see subject, and

introduced him to a Soviet

official. This Soviet identified himself only by a first

name and

a telephone number,

both unknown to our source.

The Soviet described his work as

blandishments as trips in a chauffered private limousine

into. forbidden areas outside Moscow, tickets to any enter-

tainment, access to material from previously inaccessible

archives, the use of private country villas and all the

"beautiful, interesting and intelligent girls" he might want.

Subject has further been promised the opportunity of returning

to the Soviet Union for as long as he wants at any future

date.

He would have to pay only his way

over there; his

expenses and return trip to the US would be paid by the

Soviets.

4. Subject has taken advantage of this offer to take

several trips for sightseeing into forbidden areas around

Moscow in a private

car with the Soviet Official, and has

also taken un a few offers for entertainment.

Subject visited

one of these villas, but

refused the girls on the ground that

he wants a woman to like him for himself, and not because she

has been told to do so.

The Soviet answered that "some of

them will really learn to like you for yourself, as well as

work for us," but Subject still declined to get

However, Subject has recently been taken up by a Soviet girl

who had previously tried to seduce another American student

and subsequently blurted out that she was put onto the latter

American by the MVD, which she has also told Subject. Subject

he has flatly told her he doesn't trust her nor any Russian

Subject has reportedly told

Soviet Official in order to cover himself "in case anything

happened".

6. This Soviet Official has evinced an interest to

Subject in many of the American Exchange students, with the

explanation that some would undoubtedly be back in Moscow

within two years as Diplomats and that since this is his

area of responsibility, he wants to know as much as possible

about them. The Soviet indicated that he was

quite aware of

US Embassy and what they do in the university buildings, but

a clever and humorous conversationalist who likes to be

Subject,

and his adamant refusal of any such offer.

This latest

information was recently received from RIHA by a sensitive

2. During April 1959, the Soviet Ufficial tho said i

was from the American Section of the MVD (sic) and who had been

cultivating Subject, allegedly asked the latter to make complete

and regular reports

on Michael Martin/LUTHER,

one of the other

American Exchange Students at Moscow University. Subject was

asked to spend as much time as possible with LUTHER, and to

report where he

goes, what he does

and with whom he

associates.

If Subject were to do this reporting, the Soviet Official

said he would make available certain material from Archives

which Subject has been

unable to get permission to use although

research in this material is vital to his having a successful

3.

Subject alleges he flatly refused this "deal"', saying

that if he ever got mixed up in such a dirty business, 'it would

be for his own side and not for the Communists. The Soviet

Official then told Subject he should engage in such observation

and reporting io the Soviets to lose some "naivete" about how:

the United States is exploiting the Cultural Exchange Program

for intelligence purposes.

To back up this assertion, the

Soviet Official told' Subjcot about a "spy nest where spies deposit

things for one.

near

a university, entrance frequented by still another American

student, Walter CLENENS, who, the Soviet implied, was not engaged

history at Colorado University, who departed Denver area 3/69

had

constant sexual affairs with Riha and used this as a club over

his head to prevent disclosure of forgeries.

Riha is dead since he vas close to his friends and if alive would

contact them.

Investigation indicates Riha abnormal in his sexual

desires and could not leave women alone.

Alter leaving Boulder, SMILEY was advised by

Dean WILLIAM i. BRIGGS, College of Arts and Sciences,

University of Colorado, Boulder, that a letter was

received by the University purportedly written by RIJA

in which he

stated that he would not be returning to

the University. BRIGGS advised SMILEY that in his

opinion, the

letter was a forgery, since the signature

did not compare with that of RIJA.

After the disappearance, SMILEY began receiving

a great many inquiries from the news media and he was

pressed for a statenent regarding his knowledge of RIJA

and whether or not he was alive.

THE FOLLOWING WAS FURNISHED BY DR. SMILEY

IN THE STRICTEST OF CONFIDENCE WITH THE UNDERSTANDING •

THAT IT WAS FOR THE INZORIATION OF THE FBI AND NOT

FOR DISSEMINATION TO ANY OUTSIDE AGENCY SINCE HE WAS

BREAKING A COXFIDENCE WITH AN ASSOCIATE IN THE DENVER

OFFICE OF THE CENTRAL INTELLIGDICE AGENCY:

Being hounded by the press for a statement,

he contacted a source in the CIA Office at Denver since

he, SmiLEY, Fas formerly a member of the Office of Naval

Intelligence, thinking that perhaps that agency could

assist

hin ofi the record with any information

it night

possess.

SMILEY was avare that the CIA had interviewed

RIJA following a trip by RIJA to the Soviet Union. The

CiA source

subsequently told Dr. SMILEY to merely advise

the press

that he had infornation to the effect that

RIJA MaS

"alive and well". •

This information was subsequently

roleased by Dr. SMILEY to the studant press at the University

of Colorado, and it appeared in print.

When the Office of the District Attorney in

Denvér instituted investigation into the disappearance

Of RIJA, SMILEY waS contacted by the DA's Office regarding

the source of his statement.

Dr. SMILEY again contrcted

the Denver CIA Office source and was advised that he

was to state nothing and that he would be recontacted.

Some days later, tha CIA source recontacted

him and told hin that he would be receiving an inquiry

from the Difice of the DA in the foru of a stateront,

and that he should agree with the statement even though

It "was not quite the truth". SMiLEY did not question

2

NW 65360 Docld:32989714 Page 132

---

## Page 133

these instructions, since he felt that CiA knew what

should be done in this type of case.. He received a

telephone call from the DA's Office and a statement

• DRES

was read to him to the effect that the infornation

which he had received and made public to the effect

that RIJA was

alive

and well was in error.

SMILEY

told the caller that he agreed with the statement and

nothing further came of this.

Dr. SMILEY does not know what part, 1f any,

the CIA has in this case, but since ho, SMILEY, is

himself a former intelligence agent he

did not

feel

that he had the right to question something which

might be of vital inportance to his country.

DR. SMILEY REQUESTED THAT NO HINT OR

INFERENCE BE GIVEN TO THE CIA WHICH WOULD INDICATE

• THAT HE HAS REVEALED TO THE FBI HIS CONTACTS REGARDING

THIS LATTEP WITH THE DENVER OFFICE OF THE CIA.

He stated

that though he has no evidence to

substantiate his belief, he cannot get it out of his

mind that RIJA may have been a double agent for the

Soviets or the Czechoslovaks.

He is aware that ons

rs: TANNENBAU!, a vonan indicted for a number of frauds

and

a suspoct in

two arsonic poisonings, is considered

a suspect in the disappearance of RIJA.

He never knew

RIJA to be associated

with any such woman, but stated

that he was not acquainted with the personal life of

FIJA who was sonewhat of a "loner".

RIJA, when he joined the

staff of the University

of Colorado,

was single but in 8/68, an individual came

to visit RIJA ostensibly for the purpose of arranging

a marriage between RIJA and the man's sister.

The

intended bride was a Czechoslovakian girl who was born in

Prague, Czechoslovakia, and this "brothor-in-lay" was

entertained by a member and colleague of kios in che

History Departient.

This individual indicated to situat

that although the "brother-in-law" supposedly did not

speak any English, and had RIJA translate every statement

Into Czech, 1t ras

apparent from the gestures and expressions

of the "brother-In-lan" that he understood more than he

let on. Three weeks after the visit of this wan, the woman

who becare drs. RiJA came to boulder, colorado, mere sue

and Ridi vere married.

The marriage resulted in divorce

& short time later and the girl reportedly returned to

the last coast fron whonce she cane.

Dr. SMILEY indicated that he has no further

information regarding this matter, but that Dean MILLIAM E.

BRIGGS, Colege of Arts and Sciences, University of

Colorado, Boulder, should be in possession of the letter

purportedly written from Canada by RIJA, and may be in

& position to assist in answering any question the Bureau

might have regarding RIJA's association with the University

of Colorado, since BRIGGS mould have possession of these

records.

He stated BRIGGS is a trusted confidant of his

and Dr.

Responses to the alorementioned questions are set

forth below and appear in the same order as posed.

1. The rBI conducts surveillances of denonstrations

occurring on or near federal property; at othor locations

whon facts indicate a violation of federal statutes over

which the roĩ has investigative jurisdiction may occur; or

at a site where indiviauals of investigative interest to

tho dis are present or the demonstration is sponsoled by

an organization Di Investigativo interest In this instance,

the ILI had received information iron a source, who

has

provided rollable intormation in the past, that an organiza-

tion of investigative interest to the FLI

would be attempting

to gain publicity by entering tho Foderal Building is Acron,.

creating disturbances and delacing Federal property. This

organization has been deterninod to be intluencad by a

superatE organization tich espouses a basic inexisi-

Leninist-laoist revolutionary idcology.

Investigation of

both of these organizations is based on infornation which

indicates they may be engaged in activitios which could

Sections in (Leneinion me tenanted in, cat (sedations

Conspiraey), 2335 (Advocating Overthion of Government),

2387 (Sedation). In addition,

inasmuch as the possibility

exisied Individuals present at the denonstration would

atcount to deface Federal property, there was reason to

believe a viointion of Title 19, United States Code,

Section 1361 (Destruction e1 Govornuent Proportz) could occur.

At a later dato, additional inframation tas reccived fron a

second source, tho has provided reliable intorcation in tha

past, that the ¿monstration aù the Federal Building in Alron

would be to protest United States involvoucat in Southeast

Subcomnitteo on Civil

and Constitutional Eights

of the House Cormittee

on the Judiciasy

Surveillance in this case was not related to any

bomb threat; however, based on the infornation stated above,.

there was reason ici

the FBI to suspect that there might ke

violations o1 I'edoral statutes over which the lul has investi

gative juäisdiction.

In the event such violations did occur,

it would be necessaay that Agents be piesent to gather tha

Decossary evidence.

The BI did bave an interest relating to tha

Identitios of the particular individuals tho were involvod

in organizing the denonstration. One such individual, who

in aganlalag the denonstration, has been arrested and

convicted tos abusa to a police

assenily in the past and has been descilboa by a source,

Rho bas

provided reliable inicamation in the past,

to have indicatod in the pasi a cosito to "get sonething

going with tho police."

This same individual is also

considered by the source to bo unstable and violence-prone.

In addicion: the inuividuais planning the dencastratico,

as previourly montioned, were afitilatod with an caganiza-

tion which follows a revolutionary ideology.

s.. Those were no known violations of Federal es

10201 statutes during the demonsiration; there was no violence;

and there vose no arrests as a result of the denchstrasion.

Both prints and negatives of photographs taken by

the FEI have been maintained, from the time processed, as

film was daveloped because, among the approximately 15

demonstrators preseni outsice the Akron federal Building,

were of better quality than existing photographs, the improved

1966

FROM

Fred M. Vinson, JI.

Assistant Attorney General

Criminal Division

NATIONAL SECURITY INFÖRMATION

SUBJECT: XElectronis Devices

Unauthorized Disclosure

Subject to Criminal Sanctions

In recent months the Department has been confronted with serious

problems concerning the prospective or continued prosecution ot individuals

who have been the subject of prior electronic surveillance. These problems

have sometimes arisen comparatively late in the investigative or prosecutive

process. For example, we recently were forced to close an important

wrestigation involving major gambling figures in Miami because we were

advised that the evidence necessary to obtain a conviction was tainted: In

other cases the problem arose after indictment (United States V. Davis,

United States v. John Drew) or in the appellate stage after

trial (United States v. Black; United States v. Kolod).

In view of these experiences, it appears necessary and desirable

that the Department have full knowledge of the extent of any device probler

at as early a stage of preparation for prosecution as possible in order to

determine whether a particular case may or may not be tainted or what

responses will be necessary with respect to a motion under Rule 16 to

produce statements.

1

Accordingly, I feel it is imperative for us to establish between

the Bureau and the Department (and perhaps United States Attorneys in

cases of direct referral) some sort of "early warning" system. This may

require the Bureau to set up and maintain appropriate indices with respect

to electronic surveillance and the materials derived therefrom

I have discussed this suggestion with the Attörney General and tne

Deputy Attorney General. Both feel that the establishment of such indiões

is necessary. They have suggested that I discuss the details of their

establishment with representatives of the Bureau. I should therefore

appreciate your designating an individual for this purpose at your earliest

convenience.

-1%

This is in reference to your memorandüm of September 28

to the Attorney General concerning information developed through

(electronic surveillance devices.

I am pleased to learn that the

Bureau maintains indices on such information which will be avail-

able to Department attorneys. However, to make effective use of

such records, I believe we should know how any such index is

constituted. Specifically, it would be helpful to know whether or

not there is a central index which will permit a rapid determina-

tion as to whether any given person was overheard, present, or

¡ referred to in the course of a conversation.

I assume that in all cases investigated by the Bureau you

will advise the appropriate Division of the Department as early |

as possible concerning information derived from an electronic

surveillance bearing on the case or any person involved in that,:

case. We would, of course, propose to set up machinery to

advise the Bureau promptly of our interest in any case which is'>

being investigated by another agency.

We look forward to a discussion of the general problem?

with Mr. DeLoach, but feel that such a discussion will be more

fruitful after we understand the nature and extent of your index

system and can evaluate its impact on our operations

FRON T5. H. Gale

SLBJEGT, MICROPHONE AND CELEPHONE SURVEILLANCES

In connection with problems arising out of past

electronic surveillance coverage of individuals now under

prosecution, or against whom prosecution is being conten-

plated, the Department, as you know, made a general request

that ve establish an "early warning system" in the form of

an index or other administrative device to

enable a check

to be made to determine if ve have so monitored the voices

of such individuals. The Department was advised that we

had such a system in operation.

In line with the Department's requirements, this

index, which is now in operation, is made up of names

individuals whose voices were monitored by microphone

surveillances, technical surveillances, or other similar

electronic listening devices since. january, 1960.

As you know, the Department has recently forwarded

a list of 151 names of individuals currently of prosecutive

interest in the Tax Division, with a request thai these nailes.

to determine if they were the

subjects of direct electronic surveillance coverage; whether

Memorandum to Mr. Dejoach

Re:

Microphone and Telephone Surveillances

ybe an additional example of the Tax Division going far beyond

what is required by the courts or even by another division of

the Department. Nevertheless, in order to answer any inquiries

along this line with the dispatch desired, it will be necessary

to include in our index the names of persons mentioned in

microphone logs.

Attached is a communication to the field divisions

involved, alerting those offices to this additional requirement

on the part of the Tax Division and instructing those offices

to prepare Index caras on indivicuals who are mentioned 1I

monitored conversations.

The field is being instructed to use a certain amount

of common sense in recording names in this category inasmuch as

there are literally thousands of instances in which a subject

covered engages in completely inconsequential conversations in

which he may mention the name of a third party. Examples of

this would

be instructions to a maid or servant to get in

touch with a particular merchant or serviceman to handle monial

errands such as handling dry cleaning, getting a car washed and

like situations.

Where a name is mentioned in this way, no

purpose is served by including it in this index. We are, of

course,

following the Director's instructions in connection

with furnishing everything of possible pertinence to the

Department and allowing Department personnel, not IBI personnel,

determine it it is relevant.

ACTION:

Attached for your approval is an airtel to offices

involved in the compilation of this index, instructing that

cards also be prepared on all individuals who are mentioned

or discussed in monitored conversations, except those in the

completely inconsequential category cited above, in addition

to names of individuals already being included as those whose

voices have been monitored.

(G) TECHNICAL AND MICROPHONE SURVEILLANCES -- USE OF

INFORMATION FROM ELECTRONIC DEVICES IN CRIMINAL PROSE-

CUTIONS -- The Acting Attorney General by memorandum 493 dated

• November 3, 1966, has transmitted to all United States Attorneys

instructions to be alert as to each prosecutive case for evidence that

might be tainted because of the use of electronic devices auring the.

investigation. The instructions require that in the event the United

States Attorney believes that there has been wire tapping or other

immediately notify Mr. J. Waller Yeagley, Assistant Attorney General,

Internal Security Division.

With reference to this subject matter the Bureau is currently

handling numerous requests from the Department to check the names of

various subjects against the special indices set up at the Bureau on all

persons who have been subject of any FBI electronic surveillance. It

is expected that any cases questioned by the United States Attorneys

and referred to Mr. Yeagley will be given the same examination on the

request of the Department.

Although instructions to the United States Attorneys by the

Acting Attorney General do not specifically require contact with the

various investigative agencies at the field love?, it is quite likely that

some of our field offices will receive inquiries from the United States

Attorneys. In case such inquiries are received by field offices requesting

that information obtained from electronic surveillances be furnished, the

Bureau should be immediately advised of the request and all 'pertinent

details. No response should be made to the United States Attorneys in

such instances without prior Bureau authorization. This procedure is

nécessary in view of the possibility that the subject of a case may have

been in some way covered by an electronic surveillance in a field office

not participating in investigation of the prosecutive case in question.

• The instructions issued to me unea stares auorneys oy tre

• Acting Attorney Gen

il are as follows:

"You will recal that in May 1966 the Depart

ment advised the

Supreme Court of facts relating to the case of Black v. United States,

October Term, 1965, No. 1029. Its memorandum in that case staied

in pertinent part:

'Notwithstanding the Department of Justice's conclusion

that the monitoring of conversations between petitioner and

his attorney had no effect upon his conviction or the fairness

of his trial; we have no doubt that in the circumstances

outlined above petitioner is entitled to a judicial determination.

We also recognize that petitioner has standing to raise, in a

district court, the question whether other conversations (i. e.;

conversations not involving an attorney-client relationship)

which were overheard as a result of the listening device

installed in his suite furnished any leads or evidence

in his case. At an appropriate hearing, the government

proposes to submit all of the facts upon which a full

judicial determination can be made.'

"This Department must never proced with uny investigation or

case which includes evidence liegally obtained or the truits of that

evidence. No investigation or case of that character shall go forward

until such evidence and all of its fruits have been purged and we are in

a position to assure ourselves and the court that there is no taint or

untairness. We must, also, scrupulously avoid any situation in which

an intrusion into a confidential relationship would deny a fair hearing

to a defendant or person under investigation.

"For this reason we are in the process of requesting each

investigative agency concerned to review its files in order to determine

whether there has been wiretapping or electronic surveillance touching

a particular case or matter. We are making a similar review of cases

and mätters pending in the Department. You will be informed im-

mediately whenever a case or matter in your office is found to fall

in this category.

"Many matters are referred directly to your offices by the

investigating agencies. Special attention must be given to these. But,

it is imperative that you and your assistants make every effort io

ascertain whether any cases, now pending or hereafter received, present

the problem of wiretapping or electronic surveillance. No single means

of checking is infallible but you should keep in mind that the same

person or matter may have been investigated by several Federal or

State agencies and the iniormation supplied to you may in fact come

from more than one source. You snould be particularly attentive

to those cases which involve, directly or indirectly, hard core elements

of organized crime.

"NW 65360 Docld:32989714 Page 189

---

## Page 190

"It is, of course, the very rare case--one out of thousands--

in which you will encounter the problem to which this memorandum is

addressed. The problem will arise in cases in which some investigation

was conducted prior to July, 1965.

Present practice, adopted in July

1965 in confirmity with the policies declared by President Johnson on

June 30, 1965.for the entire Federal establishment, prohibits the

installation of listening devices in private areas (as well as the

interception of telephone and other wire communications) in all

instances other than those involving the collection of intelligence

affecting the national security. The specific authorization of the

Attorney General must be obtained in each instance when this

exception is invoked. Intelligence data so collected will not be

available for investigative or litigative purposes.

"If you have any reason whatever to believe that there has

been wiretapping or electronic surveillance touching a particular case,

you should immediately notify Mr. J. Walter Yeagley, Assistant

Attorney General, Internal Security Division, so that further inquiry

may be pursued by the Department."

As you now, the decision of the Supreme Court

in'.

United States expanded

the concept of standing with respect to electronic surveillance and :

held that an irdividual has standing not only with respect to his own

overheard conversations but also with respeot to overhearings on

premises in which he has a proprietary interest, even though he was

not present at the time of the conversations.

Because of this decision,

iü will be necessary in future sequests for electronic surveillance

information to ascertain whether or not there was coverage on premises

in which the subject had a proprietary interest.

Accordingly, it is

requested that you advise as to each of the individuals on the

attached

list:

• (a) Whether the named individual appears to be present at,

or a participant in, conversations overheard in any electronic surveillance

by your agency.

(b) Whether an electronic surveillance was conducted on any

premises of which the named individual was the owner, lessee or licensee.

(c) If the individual or the premises of which the individual

was owner, lessee or licensee was the subject of an electronic surveillance,

did the surveillance consist of wiretapping or an electronic eavesdropping

device.

(a) If the latter, please advise us ef the method of entry!

utilized in the placement of the device

(e) Was the information from any such device disseminated in

any manner to any other agency. If so, when and to hor

•(1) Did the information from any such device appramdiractly

or indiroctly in any reports made in reference to the individual by

your agency.

It so, would you please advise us of the reports in which

such infornation appeared and if the information was attributed to

"I" symbol, the designation of that symbol in the pertinent report.

If your records indicate that the individuals have used names

oüher than those indicated, please check your alectronic surveillance

Re: Electronic Surveillance

This systen will enable each office to dotermine

eloctronic surveillanco coverare of individuals; as in the past,

and the blue card will be easily recognizable as coverage under

& court approvod electronic surveillanco.

Those cards are to

be subaitted to the attention of the Special Investigative Division,

Criminal Intelligence and Organized Crime Section, each eriday

in line with existing

Instructions.

You will note that, as to each individual on whom a

card is prepared, the card must indicate whethor or not the

individual vas the subject of direct coverage, a participant 12

'..convorsation or mentioned by othere who were monitored. Only

one of the last three items on the index cards should ba utilized.

The Bureau requires only one card in the special indices

for an individual monitored or montionad in conversation covored

by an installation. If the individual was monitored or mentioned

in conversation by more than one installation, a sepzrate cara

must be submitcod on each individual for each inotallation.

In the event an index card is forwarded, disclosing

an individual was mentioned in a conversation covered by an

electronic device and subsequently the individual 1s monitored

by the same device, an appropriate indox card revealing this

coverage must be forwarded.

It is not necessary to list all

dates on which he nas monitored by a particular source, only the

fixot date:

Sach source will be identified as to judicial dictrici

where the court order was approved followed by a number starting

with number I for the first order, and each subsequent order

recelving one nuaber larger. In audition, the abbreviation for

the office which obtained the court order should be utilized to

identify the source (for example:

AL NONY 1).

You are reminded of the necessity to handle these

SOurCes

on a strictly nood-to-know vasis in order to afford maxinum

security to this type of surveillanco.

Insure that eppropriate

adninistrative procedures are established for such handling..:

Keep in mind that all electronic surveillance logs

must be properly indoxed in accordance with the instructions set

microphone surveillance, a blue card should also be prepared and submitted

on each individual on whom the application is being prepared, that is to say,

the principals, along with the initial submission of the application to FBIHQ

Each field office is also being requested to review their prior ;

Each office is reminded of the necessity to comply with existing

Bureau policy and request a search of the FBIHQ special indices regarding

lance prior to the submission of same to FBIHo.

FBIHQ is also receiving an increasing number of requests from

the Department for electronic surveillance information on individuals appearing

before Federal Grand Juries or defendants in criminal prosecutions. Therefore,

it is imperative the special indices at FBIHQ contain the names of individuals

who were monitored in conversations covered by our electronic surveillances

and be current.

All SAC's are reminded of the necessity to handle the sources on

a need-to-know basis in order to afford maximum security for this type of

surveillance. Compliance with these instructions must be closely followed.

MR. TOLSON

DATE: July30, 1964

J. H. GALE

L'JECT:

INVESTIGATION OF KU KLUX KLAN AND OTHER HATE

GROUPS

has pronesed that the develonment of informants in the Ku Klu:

Klan (KK 5) and other hate groups as weil as the investigation ana penecration of these

organizations from an intelligence standpoint be transferred from the General

Investigative Division to the Domestic Intelligence Division (DID). He bases his

recommendations on the premise that organizations like the KIk and supporting

groups are essentially subversive in that they hold principles and recommend courses

of action that are inimical to the Constitution as are the viewpoints of the Communisi

Party. •He does not maintain that the actions.of the hate groups constitute the same

menace as the Communist Party inasmuch as they are not controlled by a foreizn

power.

He feels that the DID over the years has developed wide experience in the

penetration of subversive organizations through informants, anonymous sources,

sophisticated microphone and technicai surveiliances, interview programs of

a highly specialized nature, etc., and that his division could put this experience

to excellent use in penetrating the Klan and other hate groups.

..*

-feels that the DID would be in a position to launch a

disruptive counter-intelligence program against the Klan and other hate groups

with the same effectiveness that they are now doing insofar as the Communist Party

is concerned. He also proposes an immediate series of regional conferences to

Instruct pertinent fieid personnel and to devise imaginative, aggressive anc highiy

specialized programs to carry out the responsibilities in question. He states the

Communist Pariy is increasing its activities in the field of racial miters and

civil rights, direcing more and more of its fire against the iKK and similar

organizations to contuse the issue. He feels that because of the steppea up

activitics of the Communist Party in this arca it would help prevent maried confusion

from developing in the areas of activities being handled by the Generai Investigative

and Domestic Intelligence Divisions if the DID assumes these responsibilities.

The functions in question were formerly handled by the DID up until 1953

When they were transferred to the Gencrai Investigative Division. This matter wa

emo for Mr. Tolson

Uvestigation of Ku Klux Klan and Other Hate Groups

de of the prime factors in the decision to transfer these responsibilities from the

D in 1958 was the almost complete absence of Communist Party activity in there

cial area although at that time the Communist Party sought to capitalize on such

cidents after their occurrence. •

was opposed to the transfer. of the functions. in question to the

eneral Investigative Division in 1958 and his present position is consistent in that

maintains that the development of informants and the penetration of the Klan is."

d other. hate groups are primarily. intelligence_functions.which.should be.handled

the DID as suggested by.

feels that the Bureau can

st keep abreast of the whole fieid bj having til angies of the racial field united

one division as suggested by

points out that the

velopment, supervision and administrative handling of racial and security

formants are analogous.

--

feels that there is a tendency toward oversimplification

blaming all racial murders on Klansmen and hate groups. He points out that the

irders of Medyar Evers, Postman Moore and even the assassination of Presicent

ennedy were initially and generally attributed to Klan and hate gio up members

treas irvestigation showed that the individuals charged with the murders of

vers and Moore were without organization aifiliation and the Presi dent was

ain by an avowed Marxist who was active in the Fair Play for Cuba Committee.

and

both agree that the investigation of individual

ses, i.e. bombings, murders, police brutality, etc., should be handled by the

eneral Investigative Division.

feels that whether subject or victims

e Klan memders, Communist Party members or completely without organizational

filiation has no more bearing on our supervision of the substantive civil rights

olation than it would have if the violation involved were Theft from Interstate Shipment,

ink Robbery or White Slave Traffic Act.

disagrees with,

and

and feels

at while the proposed transfer of functions from the General Investigative

the Domestic Inteligence Division is theoretically appealing, it is not a

actical answer to our probiem.. He states that at the time of the 1958 transfer

functions in question the basis was the close inter-relationship between the

tivities of the Klan and hate groups and the entire civil rights field of investization.

a feels this argument has even more strength today than in 1958, because, over-

elmingly, our interest in Klan and hate groups today is their relationship with

tegration and civil rights.

believes the transfer of functions would

eate an undesirable division of authority and responsibility; that our best chance

break major civil-rights cases such as bombings, murders, etc., is through

formation developed from the inside as a result of coverage established in th.

groups, subversive organizations, but also sources not connected with any group, .

who will report potential violence and indiviauals prone to violence. We are following

the policy of aggressively, seeling out persons adaicted to violence even though they

ave not violated a Federal-law as

yet. He feels that the Division that is going to

nvestigate these cases should forge the necessary tools to use for this purpose.

does not feel that the transfer of this responsibility will be helpful to the

Bureau from an invesagative stanchoint nor in meeting the heavy responsibilities we now

nave in this a"sa.

VIEWS OF THE INSPECTION DIVISION:

feels there is certainly some merit and logic in

reasoning and it is felt instant issue is not one that is completely black or white.

Under the present setup there is coordination and daily exchange of

normation between Domestic Intelligence and General Investigative Divisions

in that both Divisions insure that communications and other matters of information

re brought to the attention of each other as they arise from matters for which

ach Division is primarily responsible. However, it seems the real issue today

ust.as in 958, is where does the weignt of the interest lie in the racial question.

n 1958 it clearly lay in the General Investigative Division because, according to

normation available to the Bureau at that time, in practically no instances had

acial incicients been caused or inspired by Communist Farty elements aithough

he Party naturally sought to capitalize on incidents after they occurred. Also,

n 1958, it was felt that consolidation would streamline certain operations.

Today it seems clear from information developed by Domestic

ntelligence Division that the Communist Party now has evidenced a definite interest

n the racial probiem, is becoming deeply enmeshed therein, and appears to be

xploiting it to an ever-increasing extent. Although prosecution for civil rights

ind other criminal violations is still an ultimate objective, there is cernite

leed for an intelligence type penetration of these racial and hate groups so as

o keep abreast of and thead of their plans and activities. This seems more

properly the function of the Domestic Intelligence Division.

Analysis was made by

relative to coverage of the Klan and other

ite groups.

The General Investigative Division has been putting a great deal of

pressure on the fielt to increase informant coverage. They have recently instructed

he field to conciuct surveys relative to instituting technical coverage on certain key

Slan figures, la ve interviewed at least once all inown Klan members, all islan

caders have been investigated irom intelligence standpoint and recommencations

lave been made that intelligence type cases be opened on each Klan memver. A

Memo for Mir. Tolson

Re: Investigation of Ku Klux Klan and Other Hate Groups

the fact that the DID has had broad experience in the penetration of subversive

organizations and has acnieved noteworthy results in infiltrating the Communist

Party and Soviet intelligence operations. It is felt that unquestionably this

experience and know-holy could be put to good advantage in penetrating the Klan

and other hate groups.

The Inspection Division feels that the advantages in having the

direction of all informant and intelligence matters in the racial field in one division

as outlined by

outweigh the advantages of naving the

hate group informants and intelligence functions with the substantive civil rights cases.

Under the proposed transfer of phases of the racial problem to Domestic Intelligence

Division there will still be definite responsibility in both divisions,

to retain responsibility for supervision of substantive civil rights violations and

other criminal violations. This dual responsibility, however, should pose no

problem because there are numerous examples of it successfully being handled

in the Bureau today. In this regard it will be noted that the acministrative handling

of the entire criminal informant program is handled by the Speciai Investigative

Division which includes the informants beinz utilized on General Investigative

Division cases. It will also be noted that the Special Investigative Division handles

the informant and intelligence aspects of organized crime. However, the General

Investigative Division hanciles key substantive violations such as Baniruptcy,

Extortion, Assaulting a Federal Officer, and Theft from Interstate Shipment

violations committed by members of the organized criminal syndicate utilizing

Criminal Intelligence informants. It is understood that there have been no in-

soluble problems in this regard and it is felt that there should be no insoluble

probiems in the coorcination of racial intelligence and informant information

between the General Investigative Division and the DID.

In any event there will certainly be no lessening of pressure and.

supervision on the field if these functions are transferred. The same Agents

in the field will be working the cases and developing the informants. However,

it is felt that the DID should be given a chance to demonstrate whether their

broad knowledge of and experience in penetration techniques and infiltration

tactics can possibly increase our penetration oi these hate groups. It is felt

that a study of counter-intelligence and disruption tactics against the Illan certainly

merits further consideration. It is aiso felt that the proposed series of field con-

ferences on this problem should be favorably considered.

Recommended Agent Transfer:

OBSERVATIONS

Agent personnel and supervisory functions have been analyzed and dealt with

in the foregoing proposed reallocations; clerical functions have not. It is suggested

that clerical functions and personnel now simply move with the Agent desks and

units to which they are attached. Questions of space also have not been covered

and it is readily apparent that a substantial portion of the functions and personnel

suggested for transter to Training Division might feasibly operate at Quantico

(e. g. Library, Special Productions and Publications Unit). Five units of Iraining

Division are now located at Headquarters and the Research Unit of Research and

Service Section proposed herein for transfer to Training Division, likewise should -

remain at Headquarters. Accordingly*

formerly in the

Front Oifice of Crime Research Division, has been proposed for transfer to Training

Dirision in order to act, during this transition period, as a special coar dinator

of functions that may be divided between Headquarters and Quantico.

Na!,

The questions of adequacy of clerical porsonnel, space reallocation, and

we This appears logical and feasible. I snags develop we can an

readjust. I agree that the Research and Servica functions, which will remain

under®

should be reassigned to the Training

Division, I do not believe that this Section should be transferred to Quantico,

nowever, because there is daily need for access to illes and other material

at headquarters and occasional contacts win the puolic. burthermore, there

is no available space at Quantico escept in the Library Building: Accordingly,

i recommend that the FBIHQ Library. be moved into the Library Building ai

Quantico. We would need to retain at FBIHQ the telephone directories and

encyclopedias which are used on a daily basis by other Divisions. The

space into which the FBiH? Liorary was to have been moved in the 9th and D

Suilding can be used and in fact is bacily needed by the Domestic Intelligence

Division which is very crowded.

I recommend that you approve now the transfer of functions and

that any necessary realignment of personnel be considered by separate

memoranda.

Bureau Library at FBI Headquarters

A survey has been made of the library, its books, facility and

personnel. At the present time, the library is housed in six rooms in the 4200

corridor at fBl Headquarters and has a staff of the following:

.

From a survey of the books, all books can be removed from the

library to the library at Quantico with exception to certain reference books

and out-of-town telephone directories which are necessary to be maintained at FBI

Headquarters for ready-reference purposes by the Bureau staff at Headquarters.

from the survey, it was determined these books can be maintained iu two rooms"

presently occupied by the library, thus freeing four rooms as surplus spate."

' In the library is a lending library which has about 100 members.

These members pay $1 every six months for membership dues and have the privilege

of using the library. Because of the minor use of this lending library, I am proposin

that we phase out this part of the library during the next six months, removing the

books at the end of that period to Quantico.

SUPERVISORY REORGANIZATION OF

CRIME RESEARCH DIVISION

Reference is made to the memorandum of. Mr. Walters to Mr. Felt:

dated 12/14/72, in captioned matter. A review has been made of the units assigrea

to the Training Division from the former Crime Research Division, particularly

the Research and Service Section.

As you know,

, has retired. I believe we can consolidate the Training Program

Processing Section and the Research and Service Section at FBI Headquarters

into one section, calling it the Training Programs Processing and Research Sects.

This would eliminate one section chief.

As you know, we have recommended and it has been approved that i=

Library in the Crime Research Section be moved to Quantico. It is my proposal

with the Research Unit leaving three units from the iormer Research and Service

Section; namely, the Research Unit;

Special Productions Unit and Publications

Unit.

I have discussed with Mr. Callahan the transferring of the Suggestics

Forms, Reports Management, Manuals and Chief Clerk Matters to the Adminisera===

Division and he is agreeable.

This would mean an addition to his division of cha

Special Agent and seven clerical staff. The remaining units presently in the Irair==

Division would remain as is.

This would give the Section Chief of the Training Division stationed

at FBi Headquarters a total of 18 Agents and 53 clerks under his supervision. I

believe that current Section Chief

is capable of handling this

assignment as Section Chief, particularly if:

is retained as

Haheu during the rall of 1900 for the purpose of using Maheu

as a "cut-out" in contacts with Sam Giancana, a known noodlun

in the Chicago

area.

Colonel

CIA's clandestine

efforts against the Castro government.

No details or rethods used by laheu or Giancana

in accomplishing their missions were over reported to

In confirmation of our orál discussion on 17 May 1966, this

"Edwards, as you'knos, is a former Director of Security oi this

Edwards met with the undersigned on 13 May 1966 and related the

following:

"Johnny" had called Colonel Edwards at 11:30 a.m.,

on 12 May 1966. He said that he wanted five minutes with

Coloncl Edwards and that he had something to tell him.

Colonel Edwards agreed and made arrangernents to meet

him at the Cocktail Lounge of the Lawyers Club at

5:00 p.m.

"According to Colonel Edwards, "Johnny" arrived

promptly at the agrecd time. The Lounge at that hour

is usually deserted excent for the bar waiter. They

ordered drinks. It is Colonel Edwards impression that

"Johnny" has aged a lot since he saw him last.

Colonel

Edwards got the distinct impression that although no wäs

trying to put on a good front, he looked worried and sames

conversation but "Johnny", although friendly, was ansious

to get to the point of his visit. The following is the essence

of "Johnny's"' story as he told it to Colonel Edwards.

Colonel Edwards let him talk frecly and asked only a few

questions since he did not consider it wise to interrogate

him or press him for further details.

"Johnny" said that he had been approached on the street

•in Los Angeles by an FBI agent named Dodge, who said he

wanted to talk to him. He said that he told the agent that he

did not want to talk to him and kept on walking. Another

agent, named Hill joined "Johnny" and Dodge as they walked

down the street. The agents told him that the interview had

nothing to do with him personally and that they had nothing

against him. They tried to give him an envelope and a card.

"Johnny" said he told. them that if they had a legal document

such an a summons on cubacena! he would ester, with in

law, but they would have to deal with his attorncy or have

his attorney present.

The agents said they wanted to talk

to him alone and said it had nothing to do with him personally.

They proposed that they meet him in a suburb in Los Angeles,

which "Johnny" said was about forty miles away (either at

this point, or later through his attorney) they told hina they

wanted to talk to him on a matter they knew he did not want

an attorney to know. They said it was a matter of National

Security. He still refused and they left him.

"They left him and whon he got back to his apartment

the envelope was there. He said he did not open it but called

• his attorney and had him open it. The envelope contained a

, picture of a woman and a child about four years old.

"Johnny" said the child was himself at that age (Colonel

•Edwards tried to get a little more detail on the envelope and

the woman, but "Johnny" was very touchy on this).

"The attorney, Jimmy;

Calimonte, has talked to the FÉI

but has gotion nowhere excey! that they want to talk to

"Johnny" alone. "Johnny" julio has had considerable

experience in these malters) felt at the time and still feels

that this is not the orthodox approach of the FBI and he is

puzzlcd. He said to Colonel Edwards that if he did talk to

the FBI, he was not going to tell them anything relating to

National Security (this was volunteered and Colonel Edwards

did.not advise on this point either pro or con).

"After "Johnny" had finished his tale, Colonel Edwards

• asked him if he were being told this in confidence.

"Johnny"

said no, that Colonel Edwards could tell anyone he wished.

In this regard, Colonel Edwards gave no advice and made

no commitment. He did tell him that he might tell his suc-

cessor (the undersigned) as a matter of information.

"Colonel Edwards' estimate of this development is that

"Johnny" is in some kind of "bind" personally. Colonel

Edwards referred to an article in the Saturday Eveninz Post

.. on the Mafia and San; Giancanna, who is now in jail in

Chicago. Colonel Edwards thinks that "Johnny" believes

that if he talks to the F'Bl alone, Sam or Sam's friends will

bélieve he is "talking" which would be fatal for "Johnny" -

he knows a lot about Sam. On the other hand, Colonel

Edwards believes that "Johnny" wants to keep square with

the Bureau.

"Colonel Edwards noted that "Johnny" barely finished

one drink, which is unusual for him. He left, saying he

was mecting his attorney, who was lying down from New

York: City on the shuttle (they had flown from Los Angeles

to New York together). "

Although "Johnny" did not say so, Colonel Edvards is of the

opinion that "Johnny" wanted this Agency to inform your Burcau of

these developments and is using this channel for this purpose. This

• information is passed to you with the rcquest that it not be relcasca

outside of your Bureau without prior coordination with this Office.

In addition, it would be appreciated if you would not inform "Johnny"

that we have passed this information to you without giving us an

opportunity to consider its implications to this Agency. Colonel

Edwards has indicated to the undersigned that he would be more

than willing to be interviewed by representatives of your Bureau

should you consider it necessary or desirable. Further, this Office

is willing to provide whatover support or assistance you may con-

sider desirable in any further

action the Bureau may wish to take.

The Director approved my memorandum of 6/23/69

report for Mo. Tom Charles

Huston, Stadi Assistant to the President, at his request

regarding our coverage oi foreign comnunist support of

revolutionary youth activities in the United States to reach

him by 6/30/69•

We advised Mr. Huston such a report would

be forthcoming.

Our report sets forth the traditional channel

for communist support of revolutionary activity in this

country by the established basic revolutionary groups under

foreign dominacion such as the Communist Party, USA, and the

•Socialist Workers Party.

We also cover the capabilities oi

hostile intelligence operations directed at the United States

by the soviet Union, Cuba and Conmunist China.

Next we show the newer, bolder avenues of support

and direction being utilized by revolutionaries, often

without any attempt to conceal their purpose.

These include

international conferences which in this period of history

are ostensibly for peace in Vietnam but which also have the

usual underlying goad ot destroying United scates prestige

in world affairs.

The case of international travel and

connunication with revolutionary intent by New Left and black

extronist adherents from the United States and abroad is then

set forth.

The section dealing with our coverage of the above

threats to. our internal security clearly shows our strong

reliance upon the use of live informants and physical surveillance

techniques contrasted by the tighly salcetive and limited use

on electronie coverage.

that they pose new and unique threats to our internal security.

It shows we have readjusted our investigative intelligence

efforts to cope vith the new problems created. It stresses

the fact that these movenents are developing increasingly

into hard-core revolutionary elements which will demand

still greater attention in the form of increased coverage

as it appears there will be increasingly closer links between

that revolutionary protest movements:existing within the

puNew Left movement and the black extremist movement

The New Left movement, which grey out of the

undisciplined group of individuals who view our system of

government as irredeemably corrupt and oppressive.

Their

stated ains

and objectives are simple; they are dedicated

to the total destruction of our traditional values and

democratic system of government.

The New Left movement in this country is clearly

an integral pasi of a world-wide revolutionary movement of

-Students and

•young intellectuals. There is a definite

sinilarity oi goals,, a uniformity of action from country to

country, and a rapport among leftist organizations and

individuals in this and foreign countries:

Left movement, the black extremist

movement in the United States can be traced to the civil rights

movement of the early 1960s and the violent response to civil

rights agitation. This is best

seen in the history of the

Student Nonviolent Coordinating

Committee (SNCC), foxied in

1960 in Atlanta, Georgia.

behind the Freedon Riders of the carly 1960s and was

OBSERVATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS

Historically, the United States has been the

target for subversive

activities emanating from and directed

by the international connunist movement in regard to elforis

to foment disocder and disruption in a revolutionary vein.

The change from the monolithic nature of the movemeni io

polycentrism only servod to magnify the problem in that it

diversified the

subversive attack.

Regardless of the diversification, the basic nature

of the attack remained the saie.

Sin regard to countering

These subversive thrusts, there were

two significant factoes which enabled us to nount effecilve

counterintelligence operations.

The firsi facior was that the activities themselves,

took place for the mosi part within onr borders.

It was a

insituation which Jent itself to effective utilization offr

manpower for coverage and counterintelligence purposes.

The second factor vas

that the activities

wate

engaged in by organizations, such as

the CPUSA, which vene

rightly scruciured organizationally in the traditional pactecu

of communist parties throughout the world. As such, they

presented clear-cut targets for

anormant penetration.

democratic centralism with an insistence on rigid discipline

aï all levels.

Here, too, it was possible to effectively.

The emeigonce of the New Left and black extremist

movemenis in out socioty drastically. altered the situation.

they evolved mostly out of social reform movements which

increasingly have been tsanstorned into hard-core revolutionary

Thé Honorable Edward M. Kennedy

Chairman, Subcommittee on Adminis-

trative Practice & Procedure

committee on the Judiciary

Washington, D. C. 20510

Dear Senator

Kennedy:

In response to your letter of April 24, 1975, I am

presently able to provide you with most of the information

you have requested concerning the electronic surveillance

activities of federal departments and agencies.

The in

Formation contained in this letter and the enclosed material

relates mainly

to electronic surveillance conducted within

the United States pursuant to the criminal law enforcement

responsibilities of the federal government. It does not

include electronic surveillance that may be conducted either

in the interests of national security, or outside the United

States by federal departments and agencies other than the

Department of Justice.

As to these latter

areas, the De-

partment is still in

the process of assembling and review-

ing the materials relevant to your request, and we are thus

unable at this time to determine what information we may be

able to provide. I should note that in several instances

your letter requests information that is either not in the

possession of this Department or pertains to areas outside

its proper jurisdiction. Since I understand that you have

sent similar letters to other federal departments and agen-

cies, I expect that you will receive responses from them.

Nevertheless, I believe the information contained in this

letter and the enclosed material will answer in substantial

part the questions you have raised concerning electronic

surveillance..

Apart from the area of national security, electronic

surveillance conducted within the United States by federal

departments and agencies may be divided into two broad

NW 65360 Docld:32989714 Page 327

categories: consensual and non-consensual. Consensual

electronic surveillance refers to those instances in which

one, ox more parties to the communication is a federal agent,

1s. cooperating with a federal agent, or has consented to

the surveillance.

The Supreme Court has repeatedly held

that the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment does

not apply to consensual surveillance.

See, e.g., United

States v. White, 401 U.S. 745 (1971); Lopez V. White, 373

U.s.

427 (1963); Rathbun v. United States,

355 U.S.

107

(1957); On Lee v. United States, 343 U.S. 747 (1952) .

con-

gess has also excepted consensual electronic surveillance

from the provisions of Title III of the Omnibus Crime Con-

trol and Safe Streets Act of 1968, including the requirement

of a court order.

Thus, sections

2511(a) (c) and (d) of Title

18 of the United States Code provide:

(c) It shall not be unlawful under this

chapter for a person acting under color of law

to intercept a wire or oral communication, where

such person is a party to the communication or

one of the parties to the conmunication has given

prior consent to such interception.

(a) It shall not be unlawful under this

chapter for a person not acting under color of

law to intercept a wire or oral communication

where such person is a party to the communication

of where one of the parties to the communication

has given prior consent to such interception un-.:

less such conmunication is intercepted for the

purpose of committing any criminal or tortious

act in violation of the Constitution or laws of

the United States or of any State or for the pur-

pose of committing any other injurious act.

Although consensual electronic surveillance may thus

be conducted without a court order, its use by federal agents

since 1967.

Re: Monitoring Private Conversations with the Consent of

a Party," and in a subsequent amending order issued by

Attorney General Saxbe. Copies of the memorandum and order

are enclosed herein.

In general, all federal agencies and departments

axe required to obtain advance authorization from either

the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Criminal

Division, or Deputy Assistant Attorney General of that

Division

before any electronic device may be used to over-

hear, transmit, or record a private conversation, other than

a telephone conversation,

without the consent of

all the

parties to that conversation. In exigent circumstances

precluding a prior request for authorization -- such as

imminent loss of essential evidence or a threat to the

immediate safety of an agent or informant - emergency

monitoring may be instituted with the authorization of the

head of the responsible department or agency or his designee.

The Assistant Attorney Ceneral of the Criminal Division, how-

ever, must be notified promptly of any such monitoring and

of the specific conditions that precluded obtaining prior

approval.

The above procedures do not apply to consensual moni-

toring of telephone conversations.

Because they involve the

transmission of a participant's voice through a complex and

far-reaching network of wires, the common use of party lines

and extension telephones, and

the possibility of an unseen

participant permitting another person to listen on the same

extension, telephone conversations have long been thought

not to enjoy the same expectation of privacy as face-to-face

conversations.

For this reason, supervision and control over

consensual monitoring of telephone conversations are vested

instead in the head of each federal department and agency,

who is required to adopt appropriate regulations and pro-

cedures on the subject.

These

regulations usually do not

restrict consensual monitoring of telephone conversations

•in

any significant respect. The relevant regulations of the

Drug Enforcement Administration are enclosed herein.

The current regulations issued by the Attorney

General also require the head of each federal department

and, agency to exercise responsibility for the security of

all consensual monitoring devices, including the maintenance

of current inventories as to amounts, storage, and users of

such equipment, and to submit to the Attorney

• General dur-

ing July of each year a report containing an inventory of

all electronic and mechanical equipment designed for the

monitoring of conversations and a brief statement of the

results obtained from their use during the prior fiscal year.

All federal departments and agencies having criminal

investigative responsibilities are authorized

to conduct con-

sensual electronic surveillance.

These agencies include,

intor-alia; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms,

the

Bureau of Customs, the Department of Agriculture, the Internal

Revenue Service, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the

Drug Enforcement Administration, the Postal Service,

the

Secret Service, the Department of Defense, the Naval Investi-

• gative Service, the Immigration and Naturalization Service,

and the Department of Interior. The number of consensual

uses of electronic surveillance devices authorized by the

Department of

Justice between 1970 and 1974 is set forth in

the attached

memoranda.

The total

annual authorizations were

as follows:

1970, 512; 1971, 840; 1972, 1272; 1973, 1484;

1974, 2518.

In the first quarter of 1975, the total number

of authorizations was 1,125. In March 1975, the total author-

ized was 461.

The above figures, of course, dọ not include

consensual monitoring of telephone conversations.

Nor do

they include consensual electronic surveillance that may be

conducted either outside the United States or in the inter-

ests of national security.

"Apart from the area of national security and foreign

intelligence, non-consensual electronic surveillance within

the United States is conducted pursuant to a court order.

ment of Justice. With the exception of the Drug Enforce-

ment Administration, no division, bureau, or agency of

this Department conducts electronic surveillance outside

the United States for any purpose, including national

security.

The Drug Enforcement Administration does con-

duct electronic surveillance outside the United States in

cextain limited circumstances.

This surveillance is pres-

ently undertaken only on a bilateral basis, that is, with

the approval

and participation of the foreign country in-.

volved. It is my understanding, however, that a predecessor

organization of DEA did conduct non-consensual electronic

surveillance unilaterally in at least one instance occurring

in 1973.

The surveillance was initiated in connection with

that organization's criminal law enforcement responsibilities

and was designed to obtain information concerning inter-

national drug traffickers.

The subject of the

surveillance

was a foreign national, and not an American citizen or an

alien

resident of the United States.

Under its current policy, DEA does not conduct

any

non-consensual electronic surveillance abroad without the

approval

and participation of the foreign country. In al-

most all cases, the surveillance is actually conducted by

law enforcement officials of the foreign country, rather

than by DEA, and is not initiated as the result of a request

by DEA. I am informed that the instances in which DEA has

been responsible in any way for electronic surveillance

conducted abroad are exceedingly few, and that in none of

these was the subject of the surveillance an American citizen

or an alien resident of the United States.

Under existing regulations, the approval of the U.s.

Chief of Mission in the host country is required before DEA

may conduct, or request a foreign country to conduct, non-

consensual. electronic surveillance outside the United States.

In addition, I have ordered that henceforth DEA shall obtain

the prior approval of the Attorney General before conducting,

or requesting anyone else to conduct, non-consensual elec-

tronic surveillance outside the United States where the sub-

ject of the surveillance is an American citizen or alien resi-

dent of the United States.

Although the approval of the

Attorney General has not been required previously, as indi-

cated above there have apparently been no instances in

which an American citizen or resident has been the subject

of non-consensual electronic surveillance conducted abroad

bY DEA or initiated at its request.

On occasion DEA has also conducted consensual elec-

tronic surveillance outside the United States, usually in--

volving the use of a voice transmitter concealed on an

informant, a DEA agent, or a law enforcement officer of the

host country.

device is used with the specific approval and participation

of the foreign country. Again, in almost all cases, the

suvame atll conducted by a law enforcement

official of the foreign country; rather than by dEA, and

DEA's involvement is in general limited to supplying the

equipment necessary to conduct the surveillance. So far as

DEA can determine, no American citizen or alien resident of

the United States has been the subject of consensual elec-

tronic surveillance conducted abroad through use of this

device by DEA, or by a foreign country at DEA's request.

I have ordered that whenever practicable DEA shall

obtain the advance approval of the Assistant Attorney General

in charge of the Criminal Division, or Deputy Assistant At-

torney General of that Division, before conducting, or re-

questing anyone else to conduct, consensual electronic sur-

veillance outside the United States where the subject of the

surveillance is an American citizen or alien resident of the

United States. Where circumstances preclude a prior request

•for authorization, DEA may conduct the surveillance, but

shall notify promptly the Assistant Attorney General in charge

of the Criminal Division of the surveillance and the specific

conditions that precluded obtaining prior approval. This

procedure parallels that outlined in Attorney General Klein-

dienst's memorandum of October 16, 1972 governing consensual

electronic surveillance within the United States by federal

departments and agencies. It applies, of course, only to

private conversations, other than telephone conversations,

that are sought to be monitored without the consent of

all the parties to that conversation. For the reasons

mentioned earlier, prior approval for consensual monitor-

ing of telephone conversations is not required.

DEA has also used certain electronic devices abroad

in order to track the location of drug shipments.

These

devices do not transmit, overhear, or record private con-

versations, but rather merely emit signals which indicate

the location of

the device.

DrA's policy concerning electronic surveillance

nas aiso been descilued in ils response io your ictter of

April 24 to Mr. Bartels.

The remaining divisions, bureaus,

and agencies within the Department do not conduct electronic

surveillance of any kind outside the nited States.

I trust that the information I have furnished will

assist your subcommittee in its inquiry concerning the prac-

tices and procedures of the federal agencies in the area of

electronic surveillance.

sincerely,

The Honorable Edward M. Kennedy

Chairman, Subcommittee on Administrative

Practice and Procedure

Committee on the Judiciary

Washington, D. C. 20510

Dear Senator Kennedy:

vant to your inquiry

regarding electronic surveillance con-

ducted within the United States in the interests of national

security and foreign intelligence.

Pursuant to a review of

this matter, I am able to provide you with the following in-

formation.

Since 1940 by directives of the President, the Attorney

General has been vested with responsibility over

electronic

surveillance conducted within the United States in the inter-

ests of national security and foreign intelligence. This sur-

veillance is authorized pursuant to the personal approval of

the Attorney General, rather than by court order.

Based on

• an examination of the relevant precedents, it is the position

of the Department of Justice that the Executive may conduct

electronic surveillance in the interests of national security

and foreign intelligence, and in aid of his conduct of the

nation's

foreign affairs, without obtaining a judicial warrant.

This has been the position of the Department of Justice for more

than three decades and is supported by historical practice as

well as judicial decision.

The only two Courts of Appeals to

Ivanov v. United States 419 U.S. 881 (1974); United States

and Safe Streets Act of 1968, Congress also explicitly dis-

claimed any attempt to place

limitations on the President's

authority in this area.

18 U.S.C. $ 2511(3). The Supreme

Court has, of course, expressly left open the question whether

the warrant requirement applies to electronic surveillance con-

ducted for national security and foreign intelligence pur-

poses.

In United States v. United States District Court, 407

U.S. 297, 308-9 (1973), however,

the Court, while holding that

the domestic security area was

subject to the warrant require-

ment, was careful to note that "the instant case requires no

judgment with respect to the activities of foreign powers, with-

in or without this country.

There is no evidence of any

involvement, directly or indirectly, of a foreign pover."

More-

over, in the Butenko case, although the United States prevailed

in the Third Circuit,

the Department acquiesced in the petition

for certiorari.

Nevertheless,

the court denied certiorari,

thus leaving undisturbed the Third Circuit's decision upholding

the authority of the Executive to conduct electronic surveil-

Iance without a court order where national serurity and foreign.

intelligence is involved.

Under the standards and procedures established by the

President, the personal approval of the Attorney General is re-

quired before any non-consensual electronic surveillance may

be instituted within the United States without a judicial war-

rant.

A11 requests for surveillance must be made in writing by

the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and must

set forth the relevant factual circumstances that justify the

proposed surveillance.

Both the agency and the Presidential

appointee initiating the request must be identified. Requests

from the Director are examined by a special review group which

I have established within the Office of the Attorney General.

authorization will not be granted unless the Attorney Genexal

has satisfied himself that the requested electronic surveillance

is necessary for national security or foreign intelligence pur-

poses important to national security.

In addition, the Attorney General must be satisfied that

the subject of the surveillance is either assisting a foreign.

pover or foreign-based political group, or plans unlawful

activity directed against a foreign power or foreign-based

political group.

Finally, he must be satisfied that the

minimum physical intrusion necessary to obtain the informa-

tion will be used.

All authorizations are for a period of ninety days or

less, and the specific approval of the Attorney General is

again required for continuation of the surveillance beyond

that period. The Attorney General has also been directed to

review all electronic surveillance on a regular basis to en-

sure that the aforementioned criteria are satisfied. Pursu-

ant to the mandate of United States v. United States District

Court, electronic surveillance without a judicial warrant is

not conducted where there is no foreign involvement.

All electronic surveillance related to national security

and foreign intelligence within the United States is conducted

by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The Bureau has estab-

lished strict internal review procedures with regard to all

electronic surveillance activities.

The extent of telephone and microphone surveillance

conducted within the United States in the interests of nation-

al security and foreign intelligence was last disclosed

in 1973.

On a comparable basis, the extent of such surveillance between

1969 arid May 1975 is set forth in the attached memoranda.

The

total number of subjects of telephone surveillance during that

period is as follows: 1969, 113; 1970, 90; 1971, 87; 1972; 102;

1973, 116; 1974, 148. These figures do not, of

course, indicate

the number of persons whose conversations were intercepted, but

rather only the number of subjects to whom the surveillance

The total number of subjects of microphone surveillance

• during that period was as follows:

1969, 14; 1970, 19: 1971, 10;

1972, 31; 1973, 38; 1974, 32. Again, these tigures do not In-

dicate the number of persons whose conversations were inter-

cepted, but rather. the number of subjects to whom the sur-

veillance was directed.. Moreover, I should further note that

the above figures are duplicative to an

• extent since in several

cases the same subject was under both telephone and microphone

• surveillance.

The total installations of telephone and microphone sur-

veillances during the above periods would, of course, exceed

NW 65360 Docld:32989714 Page 337

these figures by varying margins.

On occasion, the sub-

ject under surveillance moved to a new location, thus nec-

essitating a re-installation of the surveillance at the new

address.

On other occasions, the surveillance was discon-

tinued because the subject left the promises for an extended

period, but was later re-instituted when the subject returned.

In still other cases, the surveillance was discontinued for a

period as part of the Department's continuing review and re-

evaluation of all electronic surveillance activities. The

subsequent re-institution of the surveillance pursuant to a

new approval by the Attorney General would be counted as an

additional installation.

For the above reasons, the number

of installations of telephone and microphone surveillances is

greater than the number of subjects of such surveillance,

and

would thus not provide an accurate basis for evaluating the

extent of electronic surveillance. Nevertheless, pursuant to

your inquiry, I

am including in the attached memoranda the total

number of installations of electronic surveillance devices for

• both telephone and microphones.

Tam also enclosing the maximum and minimum number de.:

telephone and microphone surveillances installed and in opera-

tion fox each month between November 1972 and April 1975.

These

figures are based on data compiled on a daily basis

and reflect

installations and discontinuances of electronic surveillance de~

vices.

The records of daily counts were initiated in November

1912. Comparable intormation 1s not available for prior periods.

As these tigures indicate, the maximum number of telephone sur-

veillances in operation at any time during 19/3 was 93; the

minimum number in operation that yeai was 65. The maximum

number of microphone surveillances in operation during 1973

was 22; the minimum was 10.

telephone surveillances in operation was 106; the minimum nun-

ber in operation was 15. Microphone

surveillances in operation

during that period ranged from a maximum of 21 to a minimum of

10. During the first four and a half months of 1975, the maxi-

mum number of telephone surveillances in operation at any time

was 91; the minimum was

:67. The maximum numbex of microphone

surveillances in operation at any time during that period was

20; the minimum was 9. On April 1, 1975, there were 75 tele-

phone and 15 microphone surveillances in operation.

I trust that the information supplied to date is of

assistance to your subcommittee in its inquiry into the prac-
