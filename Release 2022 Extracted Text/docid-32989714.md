_ MEMORANDUM TO ALL BUREAU OFFICIALS AND SUPERVISORS

(A) COMMUNICATIONS TO FIELD OFFICES -- Communications of any
type sending instructions to field offices should be short, clear and sim-
ple. Use telegraphtype language. Reference prior communications to
avoid needless repetition of previous instructions. :

(B) UTILIZATION OF LIAISON SECTION -- A reduction in the number of
Supervisors handling liaison with other Government agencies makes it
necessary that the time of the remainder be utilizéd most efficiently to
permit the productive handling of contacts with those agencies. It is de-
sired that Supervisors refrain from designating mail for delivery by
Liaison unless a reason exists for such designation. Mail should and
will be delivered by Liaison if it requires discussion with or delivery to

a high-ranking official of another agency, if its sensitivity requires
special hamiling, oF if its content requires s
In the absence of some such reason, mail should be designated for deliv-
ery by the Courier Service or by regular mail.

Dissemination of Bureau reports and memoranda to other Govern-

ment agencies is the responsibility of the substantive Supervisor, and not
,of the Liaison Section. Transmittal form 0-14 should be used whether
such dissemination is being made by Liaison, by Courier Service, or by
regular mail. Transmittal forms in the 0-14 series, sometimes referred
+. . .. ,to.as form routing slips, contain blocks to be checked which will inform
: the addressee that no further investigation is contemplated, that the other
agency will be advised of pertinent developments, that the status of the
case is complete or incomplete, and that the item or items are being fur-
nished for the information of the addressee. The last notation is some-
“times checked without any indication as to the status of the case or whether
further material may be expected, resulting’ in later inquiry from the ad-
dressee. It is desired that when this form is utilized, it be fully executed.

This document ts prepared in response to your request and is not for disse:
nation outside your Committee. Its use is limited to official proceedings by
your Committee and the content may not be disclosed to unauthorized person-
nel without the express approval ‘pf the FBI.

If a Liaison Supervisor is being asked to pass information orally
to another agency, he should promptly be furnished an appropriate letter-
head memorandum or other communication which will confirm his oral
dissemination. Do not send serials to Liaison with a routing slip asking ;
“please handle" or "please pass information to --." “

. Affirmative contacts are being discontinued with twenty-four '
agencies with which we have relatively few interests in common. Liai- :
son Supervisors will, however, continue to handle urgent matters re- }
quiring personal liaison with those agencies. Supervisors should con-
tinue to designate for the Liaison Section tickler copies of memoranda
discussing matters involving other Government agencies, and consider-
ation should be given to discussion of such matters with the Liaison
representative prior to preparation of memoranda in order that full facts
concerning our relations with the other agency may be ascertained.
Matters involving our relations with other agencies should be coordin-
ated, wherever possible, with the Liaison Supervisor at the outset. .

Very truly yours,

coun "Ke my memorandum dated eae in which r potas i
out that liaison was being discontinued with 65 agencies and
that six Agents from the Liaison Section are available for
reassignment, I contemplate using five of the six Agents to
fill some of the~éxisting vacancies in the Domestic Intel ligence
{Division which have been approved for filling. The sixth Agent
jwill be used to staff the midnight am. Shift.” This shift
; | ues previously peen fitled on a x “pasis by the Sections

jn the Division but the increased correspondence engendered

ie the reduction of liaison will not make it possible for the
&*Sections to spare a man for this “Shift. ieee

I certainly agree with the Director that contacts

with the agencies with which we will continue liaison can in a
great many instances be made by telephone and this was considered
in my request for tne retention of ilree Ageuts to perform Liaison
\waee the agencies indicated in my memorandum. Even then, because
\oz the tremendous volume of. business: we have with these agencies,
(i will. be necessary for the Section Chief and.the Number One

Man to both pérform active liaison functions outside the office,

litte be as the_other men do, the approved. agencies.

7 These liaison contacts with whom we would be doing
business by phone must be developed and maintained by personal
contact and because of the substantial turnover in agencies,

new contacts must be constantly developed on a personal basis.
These remaining liaison men will also have to act as alternates
for one another during periods of leave or illness and where
energency situations arise that require handling of an item when
the regular liaison Agent is otherwise engaged, The a

When ‘the’ Hombex” ‘One han “is ‘dorlting outside the office the
Section Chief will be present to run the Section and when he
is outside working the Number One Man will handle the Section.

The remainder of the Section will be comprised of
ind supervisors handling supervision of all foreign offices,
igVts to the U. S. of Legal Attache contacts, Foreign Police
ieeideg matters, and coordination of the Bureau's defense
{ planning; three Agents handling supervision of all security
iinforvmant matters in the U. 8.3; and one_Agent supervising
{foreign informants and contacts, and the border coverage program,

I believe strongly that this is the barest minimum
number with which the Section can operate under the revised
program because even as projected, the Number One Man and the
Section Chief will be engaged in active liaison outside the
office for substantial periods of time, Although the plan
outlined above represents a drastic reduction in personnel,

I am confident that by the concerted and extra efforts of those
remaining, we can continue the suggested revised program of
operation, :

ACTION: :
1, If approved, I will proceed as indicated above,

inert 7 DCO TINUANGE OF fiarson’ FUNCTIONS |
Pursuant to the Director's instructions, I aes ‘eatrefully looked ifito dis -
continuance of liaison functions and resultant release of Agent Supervisory personnel
for reassignment. I have reviewed the Director's instructions (pertinent memoranda .
attached) and have conferred with various Bureau officials. :

The Director instructed liaison be restricted to White House, Vice President
and National Security Council, Domestic Intelligence Division (DID) listed 65 agencies
being eliminated from liaison contact but also respectfully suggested continued liaison
, with State, Air Force, Army, Navy, Secret Service, Internal Revenue and Civil
M Service. DID feels that some disadvantage or possible criticism could result from

3 discontinuance of liaison with these key agencies, : i 7
At this point possible criticism or problems are anticipatory. Obviously

we will be alert to such possibilities, and if problems arise, we will meet them and

. take such stens as are necessary to Solve them. We can always modify our

«=m Procedures when it is in the Bur eau's interests to doso, Furthermore, there appear
: to be no question but that almost all business and necessary dissemination can be
! handled by teletypes, letters, dissemination memoranda, or by telephone with con~

“! firmation in writing if necessary, Emergency or eee delicate situations can
_ be handled by direct contact,

For above reasons, we should immediater#Ziscontinue liaison service
with all agencies except White House, Vice President, and National Security Council,
‘Our teletype network to key agencies and our regular courier service will provide
expedite transmission. An emergency, such as a threat against the President, can
be handled by phone with confirmation by letter. DID can prepare necessary in-
structions and guidelines to implement our new procedures. Nine Agent Supervisors}
including a Section Chief, will be made available for other a: Hasseuzaaes

Mr. Sullivan’ also peooceat one of Agents released from liaison be
designated permanent night supervisor on midnight to 8:00 AkS sIUTtaR like, which

is presently filled on rotation basis, Sullivan points out additional correspondence
anticipated because of reduction in liaison, making it more diifcult for various units
to spare men for midnight shift on rotation basis. There may be an increase but it
is impossible now to determine exact extent. DID should defer this request for 90

days to determ ‘extent of increased works load. ad and submit additional jystification

L. Remaining functions will be liaison with While House, Vice President anc

; not enough to justify continuance of Section; however, a new unit could be established
for administrative control consisting of Unit Chief and three Agént Supervisors.” Unit
Chief would administey unit and also be responsible for irregular contacts with key
agencies to maintain effective relations and to resolve and avert incipient problems,

ant These matters have been discussed with Mr. Sullivan. While he does not
agree with extent of proposed cutbacks, feeling we should maintain liaison with
certain key agencies as set out in his. previous proposals, he advises DID will
vigorouSly strive to effectively implement the new procedures.

If these proposals are approved, a total of nine Agent supervisors will be
removed from liaison, thus reducing approved DID Agent complement from 124 to 115.
Nine” Agents being released from liaison assignment can be assigned as follows: 5 ~
for existing vacancies in DID; 2 transferred to existing vacancies in Special
Investigative Division; SA Bernard C. Rachner has been transferred to field; and
Section Chief Brennan to Administrative Division at no change in grade or salary =
to replace Section Chief C. Q. Smith, who is retiring effective 1/31/70 (this has

Reference your memorandum 7/27/70 "Liaison Section," addressed
to all Division Chiefs, advising that a separate unit was to be set up in
Nationalities Intelligence Section to handle foreign liaison, foreign police
cooperation cases, and liaison with White House, Vice President, and National
Security Council. Clerical personnel assigned to this work in the past were to
be part of the new unit. In compliance with foregoing instructions, following
reorganization accomplished within the Nationalities Intelligence Section:

The new unit, known as the Special Coordination Unit, will be headed
by SA Graham A, Day as Supervisor-in-Charge and will include SAs Robert H.

SA Haynes will handle liaison with the White House, Vice President and
National Security Council. :

SAs Flemister and Bermingham will continue handling foreign police
cooperation cases, coordination of Bureau Legat operations and visits of
foreign officials who are contacts of our Legats. SA Flemister's area of
responsibility in foregoing is the European area and SA Bermingham's is the
remainder of the world.

With respect to clerical personnel assigned to the former Liaison
Section, it should be noted that Edna Mae Jones and Margaret A. Zank, Clerk~

suBjecT: Liaison Section Ht oe

‘

I would appreciate your observations and recom-
mendation on the following suggestion:

For many years, FBIHQ had a Liaison Section
which maintained official liaison with the head-
quarters of other governmental departments and
‘agencies in Washington, D. Cc. The discontinuance
ef that Liaison Section resulted in an attempt by
the Washington Field Office to handle many inquiries
of high-level officials of those departments and
agencies. It should be noted, of course, that this
office of necessity maintains liaison on a relatively
low level with all governmental departments and
agencies to insure the prompt referral of cases and.
to handle matters pertaining to the effective
operation of this office in the District of Columbia.
I feel+that a reinstitution of the Liaison Section
in FBIHQ would place the high level jiaison with
other agencies at the headquarters level where it
‘would obviously be more effective, -

SUBJECT: LIAISON SECTION :

¥ aan . 5
You requested my observations | and recommendations with fegard :
to the re-establishment of the Liaison Section. 5

The Liaison Section was broken up in July, 1970, and since that time
necessary and desirable liaison with other Federal agencies has been handled .
by written communication as well as by direct contact with persons at various :
levels at tlie Bureau with their counterparts in the other Federal agencies, *
. When the Liaison Section was discontinued it had grown too large and represented
a waste of manpower, 10 Agents, not including a Section Chief, were engaged |
in handling domestic liaison with some 81 different agencies, many of which :
Obviously were of minor importance to our operations, Since that time necessary ©
Maison has not been handled as much by Washington Field Office as you indicated as
by supervisors and officials in FBINQ, Washington Field Office's liaison with
a other agencies relates almost entirely to the handling of leads and the Bureau's Pg
' routine business with those agencies, |
r ' Ibelieye we could more efficiently and effectively handle our business :
with the other major Federal agencies if we re-established a Liaison Unit of limited
' size to handle only thosé agencies with which we have the greatest amount of traffic.
' I propose we have a five-man Unit under the Chief of -_ existing Special Coordination
Unit (L. F. Schwartz); ‘

SA Robert H. Haynes is currently in that Unit handling liaison with the
: White House, the Vice President, and the pak Segupity, “Coungils To his

Memo for Mr, Kinley
Re: Liaison Section

SA B. C, Rachner currently in this Unit could handle liaison with:

Department of State —~ -.

Immigration and Naturalization Service

Treasury Department and related agencies with exception of
Secret Service

A 4th Agent could handle Central Intelligence Agency and related committees:

U. S, Intelligence Board

Signal Intelligence Committee

Security Committee

Watch Committee

Technical Surveillances Countermeasures
Interagency Defector Committee

A 5th Agent could handle:

National Security Agency
Atomic Energy Commission
U, S,. Postal Service
Department of Transportation

Under the above proposed arrangement we would have five Agents handling
the major agencies with which we regularly need to resolve problems and handle
the greater volume of our business xlating to other agencies, This Unit could be
effectively supervised by its present Chief (Schwartz) and would function under
A. J, Decker, Jr, , Chief and G, A. Day, Number One Man of the Nationalities
Intelligence Section. Both Decker and Day are highly competent for this kind of
supervisim and administration, it being noted that Day is our top expert on liaison
matters, having served as Number One Man in the old Liaison Section, Two other
Supervisors in the Unit (R. A. Bermingham and H, C, Flemister, Jr.) would

:, continue to handle foreign liaison, to,which they are presently assigned, including .
the supervision of Legat operations, A third Agent would need to be added for
Supervision of foreign liaison. ,-who is now engaged in these -

replace Rachner ,

RECOMMENDATION:

That the Special Coordination Unit be renamed Liaison Unit and organized

along-the lines indicated above with Unit Chief Schwartz; 5 Agents handling domestic -
~ ¢liaison;.and.three Agents.to handle foreign.liaison, If approved, ‘this would require. |:

the assignment of three additional Agents to this Unit.

This memorandum is in response to_Mr. Gray's

5 comments concerning your memorandum to Mr. Kinley 6/30/72.
| Mr. Gray asked for a review of current and past liaison
procedures.

The supervision of our foreign liaison representatives
was not affected by the conversion in 7/70 of the Liaison
Section to the Special Coordination Unit. That responsibility
continues to be handled in the Special Coordination Unit in
the same mahner as it was handled in the former Liaison Section.
This memorandum, therefore, is addressed to the question of
the Bureau's domestic liaisan anerations,

Former Liaison Section

The objective of the Liaison Section was, through

the development of high-level contacts in appropriate U. S.

agencies, to insure that the Bureau's business with those

agencies was accomplished promptly, effectively, economically,

and with a minimum of jurisdictional or policy problems.

By the establishment of effective liaison contacts, we sought

to recognize and solve minor problems before they became

major problems requiring protracted ‘and/expengive negotantyons

_ their operations and established a close personal rapport with
i high-level officials in those agencies, For exampl¢, in matters
‘ of major importance the linison Agent could make immediate
+ personal contact with!Cabinet officers, directors of bureaus and
many other officials of the highest level, When our investiga=
tions required interviews of persons of this caliber, the inter~
views would be handled by the liaison Agents in order that the
interviews could be accomplished without delay and with a
minimum of inconvenience to the official involved, Many of these
high-level contacts were the result of years of development by
the Bureau liaison representatives and through them we were able
to obtain assistance which might otherwise’have been difficult
. or impossible to obtain, Some examples of this type of support
are the following: :

National Security Agency-One of the Bureau's
Secure telephone systems was provided and
installed by this Agency at no cost to the
Bureau, a savings of approximately $150,000,
Through*high-level contacts in this Agency,
we have also been able to secure the results
of its technical research which might have
been difficult or expensive to obtain through
2 other sources,

Post Office-Our close association with the
Chief Postal Inspector and his top officials |

in soe of our most delicate intelligence

Memorandum E. S. Miller to Mr. Felt
Re: LIAISON SECTION

Military Agencies-The military intelligence
agencies have consistently provided excellent
support to the Bureau in both the security and.
eriminal fields. Much of this is due to the
high-level liaison contacts developed over the
years with these agencies. In the Yablonsky
murder case, the military provided, on very
short notice at no cost to the Bureau, an
expert diving team which was able to locate i
one of the weapons involved which was an |
essential piece of evidence in this crime. {
Likewise, the military has been. able to provide |
a wealth of deceptive information to be used Hl
in our double agent operations directed against
Soviet-bloc intelligence agencies.

immigration and Naturalization Service-
Through high-level contacts with this Service,
we have been able to arrange with a minimum of
complicated paper work the speedy deportation ot
of persons entering the United States who are
considered to be threats to the internal security,
such as Arab terrorists sent to the United States
on assassination missions.

In many other instances, through close established
liaison, we were able to avoid the development of situations
in other agencies which could have resulted in operational
problems for the Bureau, Our liaison, for example, with the
President's Commission on the Causes and Prevention of
Violence and the Commission on Civil Rights provided advance
_information concerning possible publications or statements e
by those commissions which -could have reflected adversely
on the Bureau.

Memorandum E. S. Miller to Mr. Felt
Re; LIAISON SECTION

Special Coordination Unit ,

Objectives of the Special Coordination Unit, while
similar to those previously stated for the former Liaison
Section, are necessarily. less broad and.are directed more
towards facilitating the resolution of problems raised by
other agencies than producing effective action by other
agencies on behalf of the FBI.

Procedures under Special Coordination Unit

Under the current setup, two Agents assigned to
the Special Coordination Unit are handling our domestic
liaison work. One of these is assigned to liaison with
The White House, the Vice President, and the National Security
Council. He is backed up by the other Agent who also attends
meetings of various intelligence committees and assists the
Unit Chief in handling inquiries from other agencies doing
business with ihe Bureau,

We have been able in our current system to carry
on an effective liaison operation primarily because of the
quality and number of high-level contacts which had been
Geveloped under the previous Liaison Section system,
Although effective, this has really been a holding operation
largely dependent upon the existing reservoir of well
developéd contacts, Due to transfers and retirements in
the most important agencies with which we do business, our
established contacts have been deteriorating so that we
are approaching the point of diminishing returns. This

- Situation could be reversed if we had sufficient man power.
to visit the more important agencies, renew old contacts and
establish new ones. 7

Costs

In measuring the cost of a domestic liaisoy operation,
the only measurable cost is the total salary for personnel
involved, Liaison Ageyts are normally selected from among
Supervisors of GS-15 caliber ($25,583-$33,260); that is, men
who have the ability and experience required to handle a
Unit Chief's job or a job of similar responsibility. Based
on current median salaries, there is set out below a comparison
of the annual salary cost of the former Liaison Section and
the current Special Coordination Unit. In considering these
figures, it should be recognized that the Section Chief and
Number One Man in the former Liaison Section, and the Unit
Chief in the present Special Coordination Unit devoted only
part of their time to domestic liaison, and also supervised
the coordination of our offices abroad and the investigation
of the many "Foreign Police Cooperation" cases handled in
the United States in reciprocity for the work done for us
abroad, The former Liaison Section also handled other
matters, now absorbed elsewhere, such as emergency planning
and the Bureau's participation in the NATO Special Committee.

such as savings in reduced paper work, savings in man hours
of consultation, savings in the climination of unnecessary
or duplicative investigative effort and, of overriding
importance, the increasing of our operational effectiveness
through the establishment of good will with other agencies.
These savings offset to a considerable degree the increased
salary expenditure.

Conclusion

Although we enjoy a strong operational relationship
with other agencies, including the intelligence agencies,
wherein in many instances we have face-to-face meetings at
the desk level with counterparts in other agencies, we
believe that from the overall standpoint the Bureau can
profit from the assignment of three additional Liaison Agents
to this work. We are not recommending that we enter into
liaison functions as broadly as we were engaged in the past 7
as we believe such an expenditure would not be justified,
What we are recommending is the assignment of one-half the
personnel which had previously been assigned to direct
liaison functions at less than one-half the previous cost,

ADDENDUM OF W, M. FELT 17-19-72 &

Irecommend re-establishment of a Liaison Section on the
restricted basis outlined above. The Liaison Section should maintain
smooth and continuing contact with top officials in the intelligence com-
munity and related departments. We would not change in any way very
effective liaison maintained by other divisions with Congress, Budget
Bureau, Civil Service Commission, Department of Transportation in
connection with hijackings and security matters, etc. This action would
eliminate any remnants of criticism concerning our liaison. We would
set up strict guidelines and carefully select our personnel to insure that
we would get the type of liaison outlined above. We would guard against
it becoming a mail courier operation.

Irecommend the re-establishment of the Liaison Section
and the addine-of three additional agents to implement this. _

Mr. Gray's approval of the re-establishment of a liaison section
included an instruction that the section not supervise offices overseas and in
foreign countries. As this work is so basic to the responsibilities of a
liaison section, Iam respectfully presenting several points for Mr. Gray's
consideration in the hope that he will reconsider this prohibition. Peseraras

The supervision of the foreign offices i L en

problems, and handle their many contacts who visit Washingtan, The latter
also visit other United States agencies while here, requiring coordination which
can best be arranged by a domestic liaison supervisor familiar with the
agency in question. In addition, some of the foreign agencies with which
our Legats are deeply involved maintain representatives in Washington.

These include RCMP, MI-5, MI-6, and the Australian Security Intelligence
Organization. These foreign representatives regularly visit the Bureau

to discuss the various requirements which have been made of them by their
headquarters, The foreign liaison supervisors simply do not have the time

to handle these personé in‘addition to their regular work, and this responsibility , _
which for many years was handled in the front office of the former liaison section,
is now temporarily heing handledi a i section to which the -
oreign liaison supervisors are attached. The processing of the requests made

by these men and the discussion of their problems with them is a matter of

basic liaison and should logically be handled by whoever will be in charge

Re: LIAISON SECTION

with other agencies is handled by domestic liaison supervisors dealing with
those agencies. In similar fashion the British will not furnish derogatory
information directly to the Department of Defense in connection with its’
background-type investigations but require that such data be channeled
through FBI. These are just two of the instances in which a foreign liaison

“~- matter becomes a domestic liaison matter and should be under the same
supervision.

Our foreign offices are necessarily closely involved in the
operations of several U. S. agencies and require domestic liaison with those
agencies, Our many problems surrounding the establishment and maintenance
of foreign offices have to be coordinated with the Department of State. It is
essential that we know and have access to the proper official at State in order
to solve problems faced by the Legats as without prodding State moves very
slowly. Our foreign offices work closely with the Central Intelligence
Agency(CIA) stations abroad. CIA Headquarters does not permit its overseas
stations to disseminate information to other agencies overseas, including our
Legats, except in unusual circumstances. They frequently, however, suggest
to our Legats that CIA Headquarters be asked for particular items. These
can most rapidly be secured by direct request from a domestic liaison
supervisor. In a number of areas, our Legal Attaches work closely with
local representatives of the U. S. military. Leads are passed to our Legat
which are then followed up by liaison contacts in Washington with the appropriate
military headquarters.

Liaison, or, in dther terms, the establishment of a harmonious
relationship, is basically the same whether practiced in Washington or Tokyo.
I feel that it would be to the Bureau's advantage to have our liaison operations
closely coordinated and directly supervised in the same area. This has proved
to be an efficient and productive arrangement in the past, and we believe that
the re-establishment of limited direct ‘aison in Washington should be handled
.. by the same supervision which. has been given to our posts abroad. - The work in
both areas is primarily intelligence oriented, yet does not fall within the

Since I think my recommendations to you may possibly be
the source of the confusion that appears to have resulted from your
order approving the reestablishment of the Liaison Section, this
memorandum is written in an effort to dispel the confusion.

When the recommendation was made to you to reestablish a k
Liaison Section, I recommended you reestablish the Section but the Section :
as reestablished should not operate in the same way as the old Liaison
Section had operated, according to my understanding. :

Specifically, j recommended that the reconstituted Section should .
have responsibility only over liaison with other agencies and should not
operate out of The Domestic intelligence Division (DID), I suggested that
the proper location within the Bureau for the new Section might be an
appropriate topic for discussion at an ExecutivesConference meeting.

Supervision of foreign Legats, which supervision had been
included among the responsibilities of the old Liaison Section, would,
under my proposat, continue to be handled Wwithia the DID and thus would

This recommendation was based on the assumption that the

RE: LIAISON SECTION

*

Your order reestablishing the Section appears to contemplate
that the new Section will operate out of the DID. If this is your intention,
then there is no reason why, in my opinion, the Section should not also be
permitted to supervise foreign Legats. The only reason for my recommen-
dation to you that the new Section not supervise foreign Legats was my
parallel recommendation that the new Section be located elsewhere than
the DID.

In accordance with Mr. Gray's approval, we have prepared
and attached an organization chart of the new Liaison Section,
As he requested, each Agent assigned to domestic liaison has had
previous liaison experience and, with one exception, each was
assigned to the former Liaison Section, Each of these men is
currently assigned to this Division and no replacements are being
requested, Each of the domestic liaison men has had at least
twenty years’ experience in the FBI, has had wide field, experience,
and is thoroughly seasoned in Bureau policy. /THe/follswing larg
the personnel selected:

Section Chiéf ~ Graham ‘Day, GS-15:" I have carefully
evaluated not only the supervisors in this Division but also those
elsewhere in the Bureau who have had experience in liaison opera-
tions and I have concluded that Day is the best qualified for this
position from the standpoint of experience and specialized back-
ground, Headquarters liaison is entirely different from field
operations and requires a thorough knowledge both of the problems
and policies of the domestic and foreign fields and of the opera
tions of the major agencies here in Washington with which we have
interests in common.+ Day has had extensive liaison experience,
having served as Number One Man of the former Liaison Section and
having handled top liaison assignments prior thereto. He is cur-
rently serving as Number One Man in the Nationalities Intelligence
Section, in which Section the present Special Coordination Unit

‘Memorandum to Mr. Felt
. ‘Re; LIAISON SECTION

directly administering the present limited liaison, the’ foreign office’
supervision, and the FPC matters, Schwartz was assigned to the previ-
ous Liaison Section and has an unusually wide personal acquaintance
with both top and working level personnel in other U. S. agencies as
well as having represented the Bureau on several of the U. S. Intelli-~
gence Board Committees. Prior to dissolution of the Liaison Section,
he was given a special citation by the U. S. Air Force in appreciation
for the liaison which he was then maintaining with that service,
Schwartz has recently been handling the numerous telephone calls from
other areas of the Executive Branch and has thereby continued his
relationship with other agencies. In addition to a highly successful
and productive career at Headquarters, Schwartz directly supervised

in the New York Office the then highly important investigation of the
New York State Communist Party and its membership prior to his assign-
ment in Washington. \

Liaison Supervisor ~ Robert”H.“Haynes, GS-15: Will handle
liaison with the White House, Office of the Vice President, Foreign
Intelligence Advisory Board, National Security Council, and Bureau of
Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs. We handled the Bureau's liaison with
the White House, Office of the Vice President, and the National Secu-
rity Council for a number of years in the old Liaison Section and was
continued in this assignment by the former Director after the Liaison
Section was dissolved. Haynes also has a wide range of contacts in
many other agencies, both military and civilian. He, too, has repre-
sented the Bureau on a number of security-type committees, In addi-
tion to his experience in the Executive Branch, Haynes was selected
for and served with the investigative staff of the House Committee on
Appropriations, discharging his responsibilities in highly commendable
fashion. : -

_ With the exception of Assistant Director Baker, all members
have recommended the following 3 employees and they are, in order of

: Mr. ES. Miller = 4 EHH ete : :

In line with the Pe-establighment of the Liaison
Section, as approved by Mr. Gray in my memorandum of 10/19/72,
-I am recommending that the 10 Supervisors assigned to this Section
be given the title of Inspector with no change in pay for the
guration of their liaison assignment and be authorized to use
personal cards for official business as needed.

The men handling both our domestic and foreign liaison

: contacts for the Bureau have been carefully selected on the basis

of their background and experience to effectively represent the
Bureau at the highest levels of important foreign and domestic
agencies. All of, these men will be meeting frequently with WS.
and foreign officials of the highest rank, which will include
Cabinet officers, Ambassadors and heads of important domestic and
foreign agencies,

In order to carry out their assignments in the most

effective manner, I believe that it is important that these men

be recognized as much as possible by the officials they are con-
tacting as key representatives of the FBI, This procedure has been
followed in the past with regard to the two Bureau representatives
handling our li&ison with Congress ahd the American Bar Association,
both of whom carry the title of Inspector. This has been found

to be highly beneficial in assisting these individuals in fulfilling
their important liaison responsibilities and I feel it should be
equally helpful to the men of our new Liaison Section who have been
selected to handle our domestic and foreign liaison assignments.

Memorandum E.S. Miller to W. M. Felt 7 7
Re: Liaison Section

ADDENDUM ADMINISTRATIVE DIVISION’ ww 11/24/72

There are currently 36 Special Agents who have credentials with
title of Inspector. Most are Number One Men to Assistant Directors or to
Acting Associate Director or assigned to Inspection Division. About six or
seven carry the title of Inspector so as to give them stature as Bureau
representatives above the rank of Special Agent in keeping with their duties
requiring them to represent the Bureau in significant contacts in the
Congressional, diplomatic, Government agency, business, and private sectors.
Although I feel the issuance of Inspector's credentials should be restricted as
much as possible, the duties of our liaison agents are such as to qualify them
for the temporary title of Inspector for the duration of their liaison assignment
and at no change in grade or salary. Upon reassignment from liaison duties ©
authority to carry Inspector's credentials should be automatically terminated.

. . i ‘

| NW 65360 Docld:32989714 Page 54 :



” ADDENDUM W.M. FELT

I have carefully considered the information submitted by Domestic
Intelligence and Administratiye Divisions as to the conferring of the title
. Inspector on the 10 supervisors currently assigned to the Liaison Section,
However, I do not feel that the best interests of the Bureau will be served
in the long run by taking favorable action. I am convinced that to accede

‘11-27-72:,

to this request would result in.similar requests from other divisions, many

of which would appear to be as justified as the issue currently in hand.

In the long run therefore, we would, in a sense, be lessening the importance
of the Inspector's title in the Bureau.

Moreover, I can also foresee problems in reassigning a man from

such duties and removing the Inspector's title from him. Such action would

be in the form of a demotion in accordance with the Veterans' Preference

Act which specifically states 30 days advance written notice must be furnished

to an employee if he is reduced in grade, salary or rank.

If we were to

advise an employee that this title was temporary and would be in effect only
for the duration of his current assignment we would still have to abide by the

law in giving the employee 30 days’ advance written notice.
considering all ramifications of this matter, approval is not not given to the

recommendation,

aalyzing the work and the accomplishments of our various foreign liaison
offices and the problems incident thereto, together with the recommendations
of Messrs. Dalbey, Felt, and Beaver upon the recommendation made in your
nemorandum of June 7, 1971, suggesting the closing down of a number of
the foreign liaison offices, some of them recently established last December

with your approval.

First and foremost, I want to clarify a point you have raised in
your memoranda, namely that our Toreign liaison offices, with the exception
of Mexico City, are not operational and that we cannot develop "hard, high
quality, positive intelligence by sending men to these countries only in a
liaison capacity." We do not have the legal right to establish any foreign
offices on an operational basis. The law specifically limits foreign intelli
gence operations to coverage by the CIA, and, therefore, we have known
all along that our offices in foreign cowmmtries could not be in an operational

status.

I cannot agree that establishing liaison offices in foreign coun-
tries without being operational prevents us from developing hard, high qualit:
and positive intelligence. Certainly in all memoranda prior to your memo-
randum of June 7, 1971, you did not indicate any such reservation and, in
fact, you specifically initialled the memorandum of Mr. Brennan addressed

that by. Kissinger inquired of me as to what had happened to the expacsion
of our foreign liaison which the President bad approved being expandéd in ~~
Septernber, 1970, When I told br. Kissinger the? this matter bad been
dslayed in the State Department and that ] had been awaiting word for approval
of tha same by the Searetary of tate, Gr, Kiesinger stated he would persosally
take thig matter up with the President and that 1 wauld raceive ina few days

several days later In Desembar, 1978, I received a telephone eallirem .

Honorable John Neifwin 12 -
Under Secretary of State
Department of State '
Washington, D. C.

Dear Mr, Irwin:

Ambassador Wymberley Coerr and Mr. R. Glynn Mays

‘of your Department have asked for additional details with

reference to my letter of September 20, 1971, to Secretary
Rogers. Specific questions were raised concerning the

location of the proposed new posts and concerning our

method of operation when they are established. : aa

In general, our need for additional liaison
abroad stems from the constantly increasing travel abroad
of United States citizens under investigation in this
country. sor example, just five vears azgu in fiscal ics,
2 total of 653 persons wanted in the United States were
ocated through requests initiated by our Legal Attaches.
n fiscal 1971, 2369 such persons were located. In fiscal
966, slightly more than $800,000 in property stolen in the
itnited States was located abroad; while in fiscal 1971, ..
yearly $1,500,000 of such property was so located. In .
lesponse to earlier programs aimed at reducing United States
lersonnel abroad, I closed our posts at lianila, Rio de Janeiro

- #nd Santo Domingo and endeavored to cover those areas by

road trip from other posts, This has resulted in inevitable

~delays and in materially increased travel costs, Asa

result, when the President asked that I increase our liaison
activities abroad, I suggested the _Teopening of these three
posts. :

Our method of operation at each post will continue,
‘2s in the past, to include the development and waintenance:
a a close, cooperative relationship with the police and

. gi ’ ies

_. the, purpose of expediting and insuring the thorough coverage

* of leads abroad arising from the investigations, being

“conducted by the: FBI within the-United states:.:My repre~
sentatives are not operational, will conduct no investigations,
and will secure the information and assistance--they. need -by'- »
direct request of the appropriate foreign agency in the ‘i
country concerned, As a matter of reciprocity, my repre-
sentatives will accept requests from those agencies for.
information or assistance in the United States. Specific
comments concerning the six proposed new offices follow:

CANBERRA, AUSTRALIA Australia and New Zealand
Were originally covered by road trip from
eet! Manila and subsequently, following the close
~- | of our post in Manila, from Hong Hong. The
SSESEESLEEEEeEEEi volume of work, particularly in Australia,
7 has increased to the point that it can no

\ MR. BISHOP

Honorable John N. Irwin, II, Under Secretary of State, called.
He said he was calling about the positions abroad (Legal Attaches) that I
talked to the President about and the President authorized tc be done, and
Mr. Irwin said they, of course, want to work out how to do this. Nr. Irwin
continued that after getting my letter in October they sent it to the embassies
to get some comments back and they wanted to talk about these and how was
the best way partly because of the situation overseas and a good part because
of the recent Presidential order in connection with the new economic policy
of reducing 5% overseas and this roises, from an internal point of view,
problems as to how they take this and where and the amount of support
they have to give overseas to the variety of agencies they support over and
beyond themselves. Mr. Irwin said it would be helpful if they could talk about
these with me or whomever I might designate. Mr. Irwin continued that he
thought they had talked once and then the FBI officer said he would like to
have it in writing rather than further discussion.

Mr. Irwin said he talked to Secretary of State William P. Rogers
and Kr. Rogers thought it would be helpful if they could, rather than going
back and forth in writing, try and work it out because they know this is what
the President requested be done. I commented that the President is amrious.
Mr, Irwin said they do want to try to fit it in with the miscellaneous politi-
cal and administrative problems that exist rather than to just move without
the opportunity for further discussion.

I told Mr. Irwin I thought Mr. Miller, Assistant Director in charge
of the Domestic Intelligence Division and umier whom the Legal Attaches oper-
ate, would be the one to talk to and if he, Mr. Irwin, would tell me what time
was convenient for him, I could check with Mr. Miller. Mr. Irwin asked if they
should call Mr. Miller direct .and I told him I would call Mr. Miller and tell
him that kr. Irwin would be in touch with him. Mr. Irwin thanked me.

B. Macomber, Jr.; his Executive Assistant, Samuel R. Gammon;
Wymberley Coerr, Deputy Director, Bureau of Intelligence and
Research; and R. Glynn Mays of State's Methods and Systems
Staff. I was accompanied by SA Graham A. Day of this Division.
Mr. Irwin, who was unable to stay for the entire meeting,
stated he was most appreciative of the Director's rapid and
G cooperative response to his request for further discussion.
He pointed out that he has a tremendous respect for the Director

| i and for the organization which he has built and has instructed
panel his personnel at State to do everything in their power to
fulfill the FBI request. He notcd that the request did, however,
represent a substantial problem for State and that he had
asked for discussion because of the difficulties which State
had encountered. :

that FBI liaison activities be expanded. The President has
also, however, instructed that the official profile of the
United States be lowered abroad and that a five percent
across~the-board reduction in United States overseas personnel
be made. Coming as it does on the heels of President Johnson's
. fifteen percent reduction and President Nixon's earlier ten
percent reduction, this has created serious staffing problems

“ necessary before any new personnel can be sent abroad, each
of those potentially affected by our expansion was consuited
by State and each one raised serious objections. Some, as
will be indicated below, questioned the necessity for an Agent
to be stationed in their countries and several, pointing to
the current expansion of the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous
Drugs, which is also being strongly resisted, asked why one.
Justice representative could not represent both agencies.
As a result, both Mr. Irwin and Mr. Macomber asked that we
take a hard look at our proposals to see if some adjustments

Memorandum E. S. Miller to Mr. Rosen
Re; EXPANSION OF FOREIGN LIAISON

I pointed out that there would be no possibility
of our "doubling up" with Narcotics investigators, explaining
that our functions and methods of operation are totally
different and would actually be incompatible in some areas.
I noted that our modest request had actually been scaled
down before it was forwarded to State and that we had limited
each office to a single Agent with only one Clerk-Stenographer.
7 I referred to the detailed explanation for our request which
Pauek 2 .-had been furnished in our letter of 10/14/71 to Mr. Irwin
a and stated that we would not have made the request if we
‘.«had not felt it fully justified and responsive to the
~ President's instruction. I said that we would, however,
ecaréfully consider each part of the request once more’ to
see if there was any way in which the total number of personnel
involved might be reduced, It was agreed that following this
review, we would meét again for further discussion during
the week of Novembér ‘29, 1971. Comments and recommendations
concerning the specific areas follow:

Rio de Janeiro, Brazil
The Agency for International Development Mission
here has: been withdrawn in the face of local criticism of
U. S, efforts to influence the Brazilian Police, We have
bden covering this enormous country from our office in

There is an abnormally large percentage of Central

Government which is endeavoring to maintain a neutral position.
State asks that we let them explore the possibility of opening
in Singapore instead of Kuala Lumpur.. Singapore is extremely _ .-.
-elose' and is actually a better location from the standpoint
of travelers both east and west as Singapore is a normal

It was pointed out that, whereas we had planned

As indicated in memorandum 11/29/71, we had an
appointment to discuss our expansion further with Deputy
Under Secretary of State Macomber at 3:30 p.m., 11/30/71.
At noon on 11/30/71, Mr. Macomber's office advised that he
had been unexpectedly summoned by the Secretary of State
to a meeting which would occupy the balance of the afternoon,
and we were asked to postpone our discussion until 12/2/71..
I stated that I was quite anxious to resolve this matter
without further delay and asked to meet with other State .
representatives to discuss our proposal as originally planned. -

y - Accordingly, we met with Ambassador Wymberley Coerr, Deputy

7 Director,of State's Bureau of Intelligence and Research;

Samuel R. Gammon, Executive Assistant to Mr. Macomber; and
R. Glynn Mays of State's Methods and Systems Staff. I was
accompanied by SA Graham Day of this Division.

{ Singapore in place of Kuala Lumpur as suggested by State,
and we would cancel our request to open offices in Canberra

: I pointed out that it seemed to me that the President's instruction
should take precedence over any Ambassadorial question and
that I saw no point in becoming involved in quibbling with
individual Ambassadors in efforts to justify doing what the
President had asked. Ambassador Coerr said that he understood
our position perfectly and State would proceed to correspond
with the Ambassadors further. He did ask that we present
the snecial prohlem of Manila for determination by the Director.

With respect to Manila, we have a fair ‘volume of
work there now which we do not have in Australia, Further,
we do not feel it would be feasible to cover Manila from
Australia because of the distance involved, and we want to
leave our office in Hong Kong free to concentrate on the
greatly enlarged Chinese problem. We feel, therefore, that
despite the Ambassador's objection, we should insist upon
reopening our office in Manila,

where RIHA is now. The source, according to the article which
MC KEVITT refused to identify, also said RIHA was not involved
in espionage of any sort and that none of these agencies

The Honorable J, Edgar Hoover

-- + Director
” Federal Bureau of Investigation
Washington, D.C, : ”

iDear Mr. Hoover: : : aH

Mr. Papich has orally informed me that you wish to have the
identity of the FBI agent who was the source of certain information _
communicated to an employee of this Agency, Mr. Michael Jfodorovich.
This information regarding the disappearance of oné
in tern passed to Dr. Joseph Smiley, then President OF Colorado”
University, Boulder, Colorado, now President of a university in El
Paso, Texas, and to the District Attorney of Denver, Mr. James
McKevitt. In view of your personal interest in this eat I instructed!
Mr. Todorovich to report to me in person,

Ihave reviewed this complicated case in detail with Mr. Todorovich
., . and have requested him to reveal the identity of his source. As a point
‘a. of honor and personal integrity, Mr. Todorovich was adamant that he
af -could not disclose the identity of his source, Under further pressure
7 from me, Mr, Todorovich maintained his position, stating that in de-
fense of it he was prepared to submit his resignation immediately,

Mr. Todorovich éxplained that the Riha/Galya Tannenbaum cases
had been given extensive news coverage, much of it being sensational
in nature. He stressed that there was embarrassing public speculation
as to the possible involvement of the CIA and the FBI in Riha's
disappearance, . oh

The purpose of Mr. Todorovich's conference with the District
Attorney of Denver was to solicit his good offices to remove pres-
sures and the possible serving of a subpoena on Dr. Joseph Smiley,
He also sought to orient the District Attorney properly so that he
would not continue to have an erroneous impression of the roles of
the CIA and the FBI, thereby eliminating further adverse publicity.

Mr. Todorovich affirms that before going to District Attorney
McKevitt he called upon the FBI Special Agent in Charge, Mr. Scott
Werner, and sought to coordinate with him our respective interests,
He also solicited Mr. Werner to accompany him to the District
Attorney. ,

Mr. Todorovich states that Mr. Werner refused absolutely to
cooperate in this matter. Instead, Mr. Werner engaged in an oral
exchange during which he remarked that our representative in
Boulder was "lying'' and then proceeded to challenge the veracity of
Mr. Todorovich. Subsequently, Mr. Todorovich conferred with
the District Attorney alone. He was successful in persuading the
District Attorney to make a favorable public statement which had
the effect of putting this issue regarding Dr, Smiley and other rumors
to rest as far as the public was concerned.

Ihave carefully reviewed the statements of Mr. Todorovich,
I feel that poor judgment was employed in passing the information in
question to Dr. Smiley and later to the District Attorney. This should
only have been done with specific FBl approval. Iwish to assure you
that I do not condone violations of the third agency rule, andI am
taking steps to impress once again this elementary fact upon all Agency
officials.

‘With regard to Mr, Todorovich, I have no reason to doubt that,
acted honestly. I I believe’ that “he has, “reported 1 to me in good,
eis sincerely interested in preserving a sound working.
lationship between the CIA and the FBI, Nevertheless, because a
situation of this sort adversely ‘adfects the relationship between the two
agencies, lam taking administrative action in this matter with regard
to Mr, Todorovich,

While the following is not pertinent to your request, my review
of this case suggests the advisability of a re-examination of Riha's
disappearance and past activities and, necessarily, the Tannenbaum
case. Briefly, since 1958 we have communicated to your Bureau
significant information which relates to Riha's involvement with
Czech and Soviet intelligence services, when he was behind the Iron
Curtain, lattach for your information and convenience copies of
pertinent reports regarding this aspect of the case.

Ihope sincerely that this recent incident will not impair our
mutual efforts in making certain that we have not overlooked factors
possibly having a significant bearing on U.S. intelligence and internal
security interests. I shall pursue this matter through our respective
liaison offices,

in closing, Mr, Hoover, I wish to state that this Agency can n only
fully perform its duties in the furtherance of the national security when
it as the closest coordination and teamwork with the Federal Bureau ‘of
‘ Investigation. Furthermore, it is necessary that we continue to con-
jlduct our business in an ‘atmosphere of mutual respect. I trust that we
ES can coordinate closely any future developments or actions in these cases,

in order to prevent the airing in public of conflicts or differences between
the two agencies, I feel strongly that there are representatives of the
news media who are eager to exploit alleged differences on a national
scale. Disturbing as this experience has been, I wish to thank you in
the interests of our common cause for having communicated with me

in such a face and candid anand

following to source which has been supplemented from :
information from our files.

3. RIHA, who was born in Prague, Czechoslovakia
17 April 1929, is one of the twenty American students
selected for the East-West Exchange Program and will be

he was put into a Government hotel for’ three days before he

6. Subject told our source that this "Government

i ;concerning this contact. RIHA apparently feels that it
‘is the price he must pay in order to study in the Soviet

academic work to have contact with any officials. Our
source also stated that RIHA is in some kind of correspondence

the Czech official.

1. Reference is made to our CS CI 3/751,690 of

27 October 1958 concerning an attempt by a member of Czech
Intelligence to effect Subject's repatriation while the
latter was in Prague in June of 1958 visiting relatives

en route to study in Moscow during 1958-59 as an East-West
Exchange Student. The following report describes further
action taken by the KGB in Moscow to cultivate Subject, and
was recently submitted by a sensitive and reliable source,

2. (Sometime in December 1958, Subject again met the
Czech Official who had tvicd to have Subject gepatriate to
the CSR in Prague last summer. According to our source, it
was apparently an accidental meeting at a Moscow railroad
station as the Czech was returning to Prague. The Czech was
delighted to see Subject, and introduced him to a Soviet
official. This Soviet identified himself only by a first
name and a telephone number, both unknown to our source.

The Soviet described his work as being in the American
‘Section of the MVD.

3. This Soviet Official has been cultivating Subject

(trying to see him as often as possible, sometimes twice a
.week) since their introduction in December, by offering such
blandishments as trips in a chauffered private limousine
into- forbidden areas outside Moscow, tickets to any enter-
tainment, access to material from previously inaccessible
archives, the use of private country villas and all the
"beautiful, interesting and intelligent girls" he might want.
Subject has further been promised the opportunity of returning
to the Soviet Union for as long as he wants at any future
date. He would have to pay only his way over there; his
expenses and return trip to the US would be paid by the
Soviets.

4. Subject has taken advantage of this offer to take
‘several trips for sightseeing into forbidden areas around
Moscow in a private car with the Soviet Official, and has
also taken up a few offers for entertainment. Subject visited
one of these villas, but refused the girls on the ground that
he wants a woman to like him for himself, and not because she
has been told to do so. The Soviet answered that "some of
them will really learn to like you for yourself,.as well as
work for us," but Subject still declined to get involved.
However, Subject has recently been taken up by a Soviet girl
who had previously tried to seduce another American student
and subsequently blurted out that she was put onto the latter
American by the MVD, which she has also told Subject. Subject
is reported to be responding warmly to her approaches although
he has flatly told her he doesn't trust her nor any Russian
completely. He claims he enjoys her company but will not
have a serious affair with her, and suspects she may be tied
up with the other women offered him by the Soviet Official.

5. In his relatiouship with the Soviet Official, Subject
is reportedly aware that he is playing a risky gaine, and is
only utilizing the situation for the comfort and convenience
it brings him. He has told the Soviet frankly that he cannot
be wom over ideologically. Subject says he feels that the
Soviets’ interest in him is to cultivate him as a scholar of
possible future importance to insure that he will always be
sympathetic to the Soviet Union. Subject has reportedly told
“several other American students of his relationship with the
Soviet Official in order to cover himself "in case anything
happened".

6. This Soviet Official has evinced an interest to
Subject in many of the American Exchange students, with the
explanation that some would undoubtedly be back in Moscow
within two years as Diplomats and that since this is his
area of responsibility, he wants to know as much as possible
about them. The Soviet indicated that he was quite aware of
the pattern of the American Exchange students' trips to the
US Embassy and what they do in the university buildings, but
is not so sure of their activities around the city. To
demonstrate to Subject his knowledge about the American
students, the Soviet Official mentioned an affair going on
within the American group of which Subject had been unaware.
The Soviet's information turned out to be true.

7. Subject was described by a reliable source, who
knows him from group social gatherings at Harvard, as mature
and socially vivacious with a warm personality. Subject is
a clever and humorous conversationalist who likes to be
“——-..__ surrounded by people, make new acquaintances, and develop
friendships. Subject's patriotic motivation was not known
to our source, but the latter felt that Subject was completely
"Americanized" in manners and interests. Our source would
guess that Subject has courage.

8. It is requested that no further dissemination be
made of this information without prior clearance from this
office. It is further requested that such clearance be
obtained if Subject is to be contacted by you either before
or after his return to the United States.

where Subject is an Exchange Student during 1958-59. The
following report describes further action by the KGB to recruit
Subject, and his adamant refusal of any such offer. This latest
information was recently received from RIHA BYE a sensitive
and reliable source. :

2. During April 1959, the Soviet Of¥iclai-who-said-iet—~
was from the American Section of the MVD (sic) and who had been
cultivating Subject, allegedly asked the-‘latter to make complete
and regular reports on Micha nel Marti UTHER «one of the other
American Exchange Students at Slosco sity. Subject was
asked to spend as much time as possible with LUTHER, and to
report where he goes, what he does and with whom he associates.
If Subject were to do this reporting, the Soviet Official
said he would make available certain material from Archives
which Subject has been unable to get permission to use although
research in this material is vital to his having a successful
year academically in Moscow,

3. Subject alleges he flatly refused this "deal", saying ~~~...
that if he ever got mixed up in such a dirty business, it would
be for his own side and not for the Communists. The Soviet
Official then told Subject he should engage in such observation
and reporting to the Soviets to lose some "naivete" about how.
the United States is exploiting the Cultural Exchange Program
for intelligence purposes. To back up this assertion, the
Soviet Official told Subject about a "spy nest where spies deposit

THOMAS RIHA
“MISCELLANEOUS

“{NrORMATION CONCERNING

Pursuant to Director's request Denver District Attorney
James "Mike" McKevitt interviewed 5/5/70 as to investigation of
Riha, Czechoslovak-born, naturalized, former professor of Russian
history at Colorado University, who departed Denver area 3/69
without notifying friends, associates or estranged wife. His
disappearance has been glamorized and spiced up in newspaper
articles by references to Galya Tannenbaum, his paramour. “lMcKevitt
| stated investigation at standstill, all leads being exhausted. He
feels Tannenbaum may have killed subject since bad feeling developed
between them prior to his disappearance due to her forging checks
on his account. Further, Tannenbaum probably a nymphomaniac who
{had constant sexual affairs with Riha and used this as a club over
his head to prevent disclosure of forgeries. In MeKevitt's opinion
Riha is dead since he was close to his friends and if alive would
jcontact them, Investigation indicates Riha abnormal in his sexual .
iidesires and could not leave women alone. Possibility exists one f:
Fs ! of these involvements may have resulted in his death,

5 Dr. Joseph Smiley, former President, Colorado University,
iwhere subject, employed,is now President, University of Texas,
yE1 Paso, Texas. Smiley after subject's disappearance stated subject
was alive andvell, When challenged by McKevitt to disclose basis
\ror statement he refused and appealed to CIA, his source, for help.
‘Bureau vigorously refuted CIA's claim that Bureau Agent was original
lsource for statement. AS result McKevitt publicly announced
statement was not true and resulted from "honest mistake." No
[indication Smiley has any facts to contribute concerning subject's
current whereabouts or basis for “his disappearance, Sinee Pureau
has conducted no investigation into Riha's disappearance, i terview
-tof ‘Smiley could result in impression Bureau entering case, However,
if Director so desires, El Paso will be instructed to interview

1 After leaving Boulder, SMILEY was ‘advised by

| Dean WILLIAM EZ. BRIGGS, College of Arts and Sciences,

if University of Colorado, Boulder, that a letter was

‘. geceived by the University purportedly written by RIJA,
in which he stated that he would not be returning to

esssoerntine the University, BRIGGS advised S'UILEY that in his : :
“opinion, the letter was a forgery, since the signature :
did not compare witb that of RIJA. :

-After the disappearance, SMILEY began receiving
a@ great many inquiries from the news media and he was
pressed for a statement regarding his knowledge of RIJA
and whether or not he was alive.

.. THE FOLLOWING WAS FURNISHED BY DR. SNILEY |
“IN THE STRICTEST OF CONFIDENCE WITH THE UNDERSTANDING -
THAT IT WAS FOR THE INFORVATION OF THE FBI AND NOT
FOR DISSEMINATION TO ANY OUTSIDE AGENCY SINCE HE WAS
BREAKING A CONFIDSNCE WITH AN ASSOCIATE IN THE DENVER

vena

OFFICE OF THE CENTRAL ANYBLLIGENCE AGENCY: _

Being hounded by the press for a statement,
.he contacted a source in the CIA Office at Denver since
he, SMILEY, was formerly a member of the Office of Naval
Intelligences, thinking that perhaps that agency could
assist’ him off the record with any information it might
‘possess, SMILEY was aware that the CIA had interviewed
RIJA following a trip by RIJA to the Soviet Union. The
CXA source subsequently told Dr. SMILEY to merely advise ~
the press that he had information to the effect that
siete _ RIJA was “alive and well", - This information was subsequently
tHe released by Dr. SHILEY to the student press at the University
of Colorado, and it appeared in print,

: When the Office of: the District Attorney in
Denver instituted investigation into the disappearance
of RIJA, SMILEY was contacted by the DA's Office regarding
the source of his statement. Dr. SMILEY again contacted
the Denver CIA Office source and was advised that he
was to state nothing and that he would be recontacted,

Some days later, the CIA sovrce recontacted
him and told hin that he would be receiving an inquiry
from the Office of the DA in the form of a statenent,
and that he should agree with the statement evon though
it “was not quite the truth". SMILEY did not question

NW 65360 Docld:32989:


these instructions, since he felt that CIA knew what
should be done in this type of case. He received a

+ telephone call from the DA's Office and a statement

-. Was read to him to the effect that the information
which he had received and made public to the effect

. that RIJA was alive and well was in error. SHILEY

- told the caller that he agreed with the statement and
nothing further came of this.

: Dr, SMILEY does not know what part, if any,
the CIA-has in’ this case, but since ho, SMILEY, is
hinself a former intelligence agent he did not feel
that he had the right to question something which
might be a vital importance to his country. —

DR. SUILEY REQUESTED THAT NO HINT OR
"INFERENCE BE GIVEN TO THE CIA WHICH WOULD INDICATE
“THAT HE HAS REVEALED TO THE FBI HIS CONTACTS REGARDING
THIS MATTER WITH THE DENVER OFFICE OF THE CIA,

He stated that though he has no evidence to
substantiate his belief, he cannot get it out of his
mind that RIJA may have been a double agent for the
Soviets or the Czechoslovaks. He is aware that one
Urs, TANNENBAUM, a woman indicted for a number of frauds
and a suspect in two arsenic poisonings, is considered
® suspect in the disappearance of RIJA, He never knew
RIJA to be associated with any such woman, but stated
that he was not acquainted with the personal life of
RIJA who was somewhat of a "loner",

.  RIJA, when he joined the staff of the Univers‘ity
of Colorado, was single but in 8/68, an individeal came
to visit RIJA ostensibly for the purpose of arrang
a@ marriage between RIJA and the man's sister. The
intended bride was 2a Czechosiovakian girl who was born in
- Prague, Czechoslovakia, and this "brother-in-law" was
- entertained by a member and colleague of RIJA in the
History Departrent. This individual indicated to SMILEY
that although the “brother-in-law" supposedly did not
Speak any English, and had RIJA translate every statement
into Czech, it was apparent from the gestures anc expressions
of the “brotker-in-law" that he understood more than he
let on. Three. weeks after the visit of this man, the voran
who became Mrs, RIJA cane to Boulder, Colorado, whera ste
and RIiJA were married, The marriage resulted in divorce
a short time later and the girl reportedly returned -
the East conse from whence she cane. :

‘pr. SUILEY indicated that he has no further .
information regarding this matter, but that Dean WILLIAM E.
BRIGGS, College of Arts and Sciences, University of
Colorado, Boulder, should be in possession of the letter
purportedly written from Canada by RIJA, and may be in
& position to assist in answering any question the Bureau
might have regarding RIJA's association with the University
of Colorado, since BRIGGS would have possession of these

Responses to the aforementioned questions are set
forth below and appear in the same order as posed. 7
1. The FBY conducts surveillances of denonstrations
occurring on or near Federal property; at other lecations
when facts indicate a violation of Federal statutes over
which the FSi has investigative jurisdiction may occur; or
at a site where individuais of investigative interest to
the FBI are present or the demonstration is sponsored by
an organization of investigative interest. in this instance,
the €LE had received information from a source, who hag
provided reliable intormation in the past, that an organiza-
tion of investigative interest to the FUL would be attempting
te gain publicity py entering tha Federnl Building in Akron, -
ereating disturbances and defacing Federal property. This
organization has been deternincd to be influenced by a
seperate organization which espouses a basic lntxisie
Leninist-Naocist revolutionary ideolegy. Investigation of
both of these organizations is based on information which
Andicates they may be engaged in activitics which could
involve violations of Title 18, United States Code,
Sections 25uy (Uiepeiiion or Insucresiivuy, 2904 (soditions
Conspiracy), 2885 (Advocating Overthrow o£ Government), and
2367 (Sedition). in addition, inasmuch as the possibility
‘ existed individuals present at the demonstration would
atteznt to deface Federal property, there was reason to
belicve a violntion of Title 18, United States Code,
Section 1361 (Destruction ef Govornnent Property) could occur.
At a later date, additional information was received from a
second source, who has provided relinble dufvormation in the
past, that the demonstration at the Federal Building in Akron
would be to protest United States involveucat in Southeast
Asia, and leaficts urging sort of this demonstration wers
being distributed in the Abron-Kent, Ohio, aren. in :
keeping with existing FEI policy, the Akron Police Department
and the Generel Services Administration Building Manager in
charms of the Akron Federal Building were notified of the :
impending demonstration and of information received indicating
@ possibility that disruptive activity would occur during
the demonstration. :

Surveillance in this case was not related to any
bomb threat; however, based on the informaticn stated above,
there was reason for the FLZI to suspect that there might ke “-
violations of Wederal statutes over which the FSI has investi-
Bative juvisdicticn. In the event such viclations did occur,
it would be necessary that Agents be present to Lubaellh the
necossary evidence.

The FEI did have an interest relating to the
Adentiticos of the particular individuals who were involved
in crganizing the demonstration. ‘Une such individual, who
Played a key yole in plans to cause disruptive activity and
in organizing the denonstFaticn, has been arrested and
convicted tor abuse to a police officer, resisting arzost,
discrdosly conduct, trespassing, and dievupting lawful
assembly in the past and has been deseribed by a source,

~ who has previded reliable inickmaticon in the past,
to have indicated in the past a desive to “get something
going vith tho police." This same individual is also - -
considered by the source to be unstable and violence-prone,.
In addition: the individuais planning the dencnstraticn,
as ptevicunly mentioned, were affiliated with an organiza
tion which felicus a revolutionary ideology

‘Local statutes during the demonstxation; thore was no violenre;
and theve vere no a sts as a result of the denonstraticn.
Both visual and photorrarhic surveillances were conducted by
the FSi during the demonstration. Current FRI instructions
state that pkotegravhic surveillances should be considered on
a gelective basis when cixcumstancas indicate they may be
preductive. Ths decision-making authofity in such a’ matter ©

Both prints and negatives of photographs taken by
the TEI have bean maintained, from the timo processed, as
exhibits in records of the FDi'sa Cleveland Office. The
film was developed because, among the approximately 15
denonstrators present outsice the Akron Federal Building,
Agents recognized five individuals known to be affiliated
with tho organization in which the FBI had investigative
dnterest. In tho event photographs depicting these individuals
were of better quality than existing photographs, the improved
ones would be, in accordance with Foi policy and in line with
an agreement between the FBI and the Secret Service concerning
Preside ntial protection, forwarded to the Secret Service for
possibie future use by that asency in conncetion with its
responsibilitics, The photographs obtained, however, were
not suitable for this purposs.

Prints of those photegraphs were net meade avaliable
to the Akron Police Department, were not forwarded to FBI
Headquarters in Washington, D. C., and were not made available
to anyone else. These prints were not retained at the Akron~
nd FEI
Office and are maintained in the rises of that offices,

‘ attenpt to identigy the unknown participants in the

tion, Information concerning the identities of some of the
denoustratorsa was provided by the Akron Resident Agency to

the Intolligenco Division, Akron Police Department, for the
purpose of bringing to their attention the identities of those
individual participants who have been involved in disruptive
activities in tne past and who may becore so involved agnin
in the future. One of the individuals so identizied to the
Akvon Police Department has reportedly urged "spontaneous

‘Mr. DeLoach)

: In connection with problems arising out of past
electronic surveillance coverage of individuals now under
prosecution, or against whom prosecution is being conten-
plated, the Department, as you know, made a general request
that we establish an “early warning system" in the form of
‘an, index or other administrative device to enable a check
to be made to determine if we have so monitored the voices
of such individuals, The Department was advised that we
had such a system in operation. :

ry Yn line with the Department's requirements, this
iindex, which is now in operation, is made up of names of
Lindividuals whose voices were monitored by microphone
isurveillances, technical surveillances, or other similar
electronic listening devices since January, 1960. =

As you know, the Department has recently forwarded

| a list of 151 names of individuals currently of prosecutive

interest in the Tax Division, with a request that these names.
i be checked through our index to determine if they were the
$, subjects of direct electronic surveillance ‘coverage; whether
an individual in question appears on any records, logs, notes,
memoranda, et cetera, either as a participant in conversations
overheard, or as a person mentioned or discussed.

This new and belated category introduced by the Tax

{be an additional example of the Tax Division going far beyond
1 | what is required by the courts or even by another division of
ithe Department. Nevertheless, in order to answer any inquiries
:falong this line with the dispatch desired, it will be necessary
jto include in our index the names of persons mentioned in
' microphone logs.

Attached is a communication to the field divisions
\tanvolved, alerting those offices to this additional requirement
Ho on the part of the Tax Division and instructing those offices
(to prepare index cards on individuals who are mentioned in
\[aonitorea conversations,

| The field is being instructed to use a certain amount
of common sense in recording names in this category inasmuch as
there are literally thousands of instances in which a subject
covered engages in completely inconsequential conversations in
which he may mention the name ofa third party. Examples of
this would be instructions to a maid or servant to get in
touch with a particular merchant or serviceman to handle menial
errands such .as handling dry cleaning, getting a car washed and
like situations. Where a name is mentioned in this way, no
purpose is served by including it in this index. We are, of
s course, following the Director's instructions in connection .
with furnishing everything of possible pertinence to the
Department and allowing Department personnel, not FBI personnel,
determine if it is relevant.

ACTION:

Attached for your approval is an airtel to offices
involved in the compilation of this index, instructing that
cards also be prepared on all individuals who are mentioned
or discussed in monitored conversations, except those in the
completely inconsequential category cited above, in addition
to names of individuals already being included as those whose
voices have been monitored. .

(G) TECHNICAL AND MICROPHONE SURVEILLANCES --USE OF

‘November 8, 1966, has transmitted to all United States Attorneys
‘instructions to be alert as tc each prosecutive case for evidence thai

immediately notify Mr. J. Waller Yeagley, Assistant Attorney General,
| Internal Security Division.

With reference to this subject matter the Bureau is currently
handling numerous requests from-the Department to-check the names ‘of
various subjects against the special indices set up at the Bureau on all
persons who have been subject of any FBI electronic surveillance. It
is expected that any cases questioned by the United States Attorneys
and referred to Mr. Yeagley will be given the same examination on the
request of the Department. :

Although instructions to the United States Attorneys i the
Acting Attorney General do not specifically require contact with the
various investigative agencies at the field level, it is quite likely that
some of our field offices will receive inquiries from the United States
Attorneys. In case such inquiries are received by field affices requesting
that information obtained from electronic surveillances be furhished,’ the
Bureau should be immediately advised of the request and all’pertinent ,
‘details. No response should be made to the United States Attorneys in

“nécessary in view of the possibility that the subject of a case may have
been in some way covered by an electronic surveillance in a field office

INSTYUCTIO! ssw STATES ATOIMEYS Dy Ue
eee Attorney Gen 1 areas follows: - |

: "You will receil that in May 1966 the seen Pe advised the
Supreme Court of facts relating to the case of Black v. United States,
October Term, 1965, No. 1029. Its memorandum in that case staied
in pertinent part:

‘Notwithstanding the Department of Justice's conclusion
that the monitoring of conversations between petitioner and
his attorney had no effect upon his conviction or the fairness
of his trial, we have no doubt that in the circumstances
outlined above petitioner is entitled to a judicial determination.
We also recognize that petitioner has standing to raise, ina

* district court, the question whether other conversations (i.e. ;
conversations not involving an attorney-client relationship)

which were ‘overheard as a result of the listening device

installed in his suite furnished any leads‘or evidence

in his case. At an appropriate hearing, the government
* proposes to submit all of the facts upon which a full

judicial determination can be made."

"This Department must never proceed with any investigation or
case which includes evidence iliegaiiy obtained or the iruits of that
evidence. No investigation or case of that character shall go forward
until such evidence and all of its fruits have been purged and we are in
& position to assure ourselves and the court that there is no taint or
unfairness. We must, also, scrupulously avoid any situation in which

‘an intrusion into a confidential relationship would deny a fair hearing
- to a defendant or person under investigation.

"For this reason we are in the process of requesting each
investigative agency concerned to review its files in order to determine
whether there has been wiretapping or electronic surveillance touching
a particular case or matter. We are making a similar review of cases
and matters pending in the Department. You will be informed im-
mediately whenever a case or matter in your office is found to fall
in this category. - j

“Many matters are referred directly to your offices by the
investigating agencies. Special attention must be given to these. But,
it is imperative that you and your assistants make every effort to
ascertain whether any cases, now pending or hereafter received, present
the problem of wiretapping or electronic surveillance. No single means
of checking is infallible but you should keep in mind that the same
person or matter may have been investigated by several Federal or
*. State agencies and the information supplied to you may in fact come
from more than one source. You should be particularly attentive 1
to those cases which involve, directly or indirectly, hard core elements
of organized crime.
“NW 65360 ‘Docld:32989714 Page 189



"It is, of course, the very rare case--one out of thousands--
in which you will encounter the problem to which this memorandum is
addressed. The problem will arise in cases in which some investigation
was conducted prior to July, 1965. Present practice,. adopted in July
4965 in confirmity with the policies declared by President Johnson on
June 30, 1965.for the entire Federal establishment, prohibits the
installation of listening devices in private areas (as well as the
interception of telephone and other wire communications) in all
instances other than those involving the collection of intelligence
affecting the national security. The specific authorization of the
Attorney Geieral musi be obiained in each instance when this
exception is invoked. Intelligence data so collected will not be
available for investigative or litigative. purposes.

"Tf you have any reason whatever to believe that there has
‘been wiretapping or electronic surveillance touching a particular case,
you should immediately notify Mr. J. Walter Yeagley, Assistant
Attorney General, Internal Security Division, so that further inquiry
_ may, be pursued by the Department."

(A) INDEX SYSTEMS -- In an important case with great public
interest, an individual was not identified because of the failure of
an office to properly index a nickname.

Recent court decisions have resulted in the public
disclosure of electronic surveillance logs and related material
which heretofore were confidential. The information in these
surveillance matters is being afforded close scrutiny by the news
media, the general public, Federal, state, and local officials;
therefore, the importance of p. Y indexing has hecome
increasingly significant.

Each Special Agent in Charge will be held strictly
resporisible for insuring that ali names, nicknames, and alia
appearing in electronic surveillance logs and related material

ES

‘ are properly indexed in accordance with the instructions set forth

in Part Il, Section 3, page 4, of the Manual of Rules and Regulations.

: has vronosed that the development of informants in the Ku Klux
Klan (KKX) and other hate groups as weii as the investization ana penecration of these
organizations from an intelligence standpoint be transferred from the General
Investizative Division to the Domestic Intelligence Division (DID). He bases his
recommendations on the premise that organizations like the KX and supporting
groups are essentially subversive in that they hold principles and recommend courses
of action that are inimical to the Constitution as are the viewpoints of the Communisz
Party. -He does not maintain that the.aciions .oi.the hate groups constitute the same 5
menace as the Communist Party inasmuch as they are not controlled by a foreizn
power. - : iSatavaBeb tase eeEhate see teeeyeeseety ctaeueettetoeesatd

: a e.. ar can = “a
He feels that the DID over the years has developed wide experience in the
penetration of subversive organizations through informants; anonymous sources,
sophisticated microphone and technicai surveiliances, interview programs of
a highly specialized nature, etc., and that his division could put this experience
to excellent use in penetrating the Klan and other hate groups.

os ° 7 i

«feels that the DID would be in a position to launch a ,

disruptive counter-intelligence program against the Klan and other hate groups
with the same effectiveness that they are now doing insofar as the Comraunist Part: 4
is concerned. He alse proposes an immediaie series of regional conferences to
instruct pertinent fieid personnel and to devise imaginative, agrressive and aizhiy
specialized prozrams to carry out the responsibilities in question. He states the
Communist Party is increasing its activities in the field of racial miters and
Civil rights, directing more and more of its fire against the ICSX and similar
Organizations to confuse the issue. He feels that because of the stepped up : ;
activilics of the Communist Party in this arca it would help prevent marxed confusion
from developing in the areas of activities being handled by the Generai Investigative
and Domestic Intelligence Divisions if the DID assumes these responsibilities.

The functions in question were formerly handled by the DID up until 1953
when they were transferred to the Generai Investigative Division. This matter wa’ - (

blaming all racial murders on Klansmen and hate groups. He points out that the
ders of Medgar Evers, Postman Moore and even the assassination of President

wreas investigation showed that the individuals charged with the murders of im
ers and Moore were without organization aifiliation and the Pres dent was

“and i both agree that the investigation of individual
ses, i.e. bombings, raurders, police brutality, etc., should be handled by the

e Klan memoers, Communist Party members or completely without organizational
filiation has no more bearing on our supervision of the substantive civil rights :
olation than it would have if the violation involved were Theft from Interstate Shipment,
ink Robbery or White Slave Traffic Act. .

' disagrees with. x and and feels
at while the proposed transfer of functions from the General Investigative
the Domestic Intelligence Division is theoretically appealing, it is nota
actical answer to our probiem.. He states that at the time of the 1958 transfer
functions in question the basis was,the close inter-relationsnip between the
‘tivities of the Klan and hate groups and the entire civil rights field of investigation.
> feels this argument has even more strength today than in 1958, because, over-
nelmingly, our interest in Klan and hate groups today is their relationship with :
tegration and civil rights. : believes the transfer of functions would :
‘eate an undesirable division of authority and responsibility; that our best chance i
break major civil rights cases such as bombings, murders, etc., is through
formation developed from the inside as a result of coverage estabiished in th.

VIEWS OF THE INSPECTION DIVISION:

feels there is certainly some merit and logic in. seeee
éasoning and it is felt instant issue is not one that is completely black or white.

i

: -

Under the present setup there is coordination and daily exchange of
information between Domestic Intelligence and General Investigative Divisions
mn that both Divisions insure that communications and other matters of information
e brought to the attention of each other as they arise from matters for which
ach Division is primarily responsible.” However, it seems the real issue today
st.as:in.l958, is where .does the weight-oi.the interest lie in the racial question.
1958 it clearly lay in the General Investigative Division because, according to
nformation available to the Bureau at that time, in practically no instances had
facial incidents been caused or inspired by Communist Party elements although
he Party naturally sought to capitalize on incidents after they occurred. Also,
n 1958, it was felt that consolidation would streamline certain operations.

Today it seems clear from information developed by Domestic

intelligence Division that the Communist Party now has evidenced a definite interest
P the racial problem, is becoming deeply enmeshed therein, and appears to be
xploiting it to an ever-increasing extent. Although prosecution for civil rights

ve other criminal violations is still an ultimate objective, there is definite

eed for an intelligence typé penetration of these racial and hate groups so as

0 keep abreast of and ahead of their plans and activities. This seems more
roperly the function of the Domestic Intelligence Division.

Analysis was made by _., relative to coverage of the Klan and other
ate groups. The General Investigative Division has been putting a great deal of
ressure on the field to increase informant coverage. They have recenily instructed
he field to conduct surveys relative to instituting technical coverage on certain key
Clan figures, In ve interviewed at least once all inown Klan members, all lan
eaders have been investizated from intelligence standpoint and recommencaiions
lave been made that intelligence type cases be opened on each Klan member. A
Feekly prozress airtel is being obtained from field concerning informant development.
However, undoubtedly additional coverage is neéded particularly in the Klaverns
babeseeobecena Sonewa a gigeezshe civil rights bill passed. There is no question about

investigative standpoint nor in meeting the keavy.responsibilities we now

Meino for Mr. Tolson 4
Re: Investigation of Ku Klux Klan and Other, Hate Groups _

the fact that the DID has had broad experience in the penetration of subversive
organizations and has achieved noteworthy results in infiltrating the Communist -
Party and Soviet intelligence operations. It is felt that unquestionably this
experience and know-how could be put to good advantage in penetrating the Klan .
and other hate groups. ~

The Inspection Division feels that the advantages in having the
direction of all informant and intelligence matters in the vacial field in one division
as outlined by and atweigh the advantages cf naving the
hate group informants and intelligence functions with the substantive civil rights cases.
Under the proposed transfer of phases of the racial problem'to Domestic Inteligence
Division there will still be definite responsibility: in both divisions,
to retain responsibility for supervision of substantive civil rights violations and
other criminal violations. This dual responsibility, however, should pose no
problem because there are numerous examples of it successfully being handled
in the Bureau today. In this regard it will be noted that the administrative handling
of the entire criminal informant program is handled by the Special Investigative
Division which includes the informants being utilized on General Investizative
Division cases. It will also be noted that the Special Investigative Division handles
the informant and intelligence aspects of organized crime. However, the General
Investigative Division handles key substantive violations such as Bankrupicy,
Extortion, Assaulting a Federal Officer, and Theft from Interstate Shipment
violations committed by members of the organized criminal syndicate utilizing
Criminal Intellizence informanis. It is understood that there have been no in-
soluble problems in this regard'and it is felt that there should be no insoluble
problems in the coordination of racial intelligence and informant information
delice the General Investigative Division and the DID.

In any event there will certainly be no lessening of pressure and.
supervision on the field if these functions are transferred. The same Agents
in the field will be Working the cases and developing the informants. However,
it is felt that the DID should be given a chance to demonstrate whether their
broad knowledge of and experience in penetration techniaues and infiltration
tactics can possibly increase our penetration of these hate groups. It is felt
that a study of counter-intelligence and Gisruption tactics against the Klan certainly
merits further consideration. It is also felt that the proposed series oi field con-
ferences on this problem should be favorably considered.

the work of the Uniform.Crime Reporting Section, including

assignment until the aecaie bene of his retirement, 2- i- 73.

:. ground, plus his familiarity with news media problems, is ideally suited

‘. to handle this assignment.

ff he has time, .Mr. Bishop will also analyze and develop
; theaningful practieal cases which will enable new agents to meet present-
day needs,

Ihave arranged with Mr. Jenkins for suitable office facilities
to be used by Mr. Bishop at Quantico and haveinstructed Bishon to yeport

OBSERVATIONS

Agent personnel and supervisory functions have been analyzed and dealt with

in the foregoing proposed reallocations; clerical functions have not. It is suggested
-that clerical functions and personnel now simply move with the Agent desks and
units td which they are attached, Questions of space also have not been covered :
and it is readily apparent that a substantial portion of the functions and personnel
suggested for transier to Training Division might feasibly operate at Quantico

e.g. Library, Special Productions and Publications Unit), Five units of Training -
ate are now located at Headquarters and the Research Unit of Research and
Service Section proposed herein for transfer to Training Division, likewise should -
remain at Headquarters, Accordingly | : 7 “tormerly. jn the’
Front Office of Crime Resear ch Division, has) ‘been pr oposed for. transfer to Training
Division in order io act, during this tr ansition, period, as a special coordinator
of functions that may be divided between Headquarters and eee Wo Vo f,

_ ADDENDUM OF W. M. FELT . 12-6:

-. This appears-logical and feasible snags develop we can. ,
readjust. I agree that the Research and Servics functions, which will re
under * shouid be reassigned to the Training
Divisions 1 do not believe that this Section should be transferred to Quantico,
however, because there is daily need for access to files and.other material
: at Headquarters and occasional contacts with the public. Furthermore, there -
_ ig no available space at Quantico except in the Library Building. Accordingly, .
~ ¥ recommend that the FBIHQ Library.be. moved into the Library Building at. .
Guantico. We would need to retain at FBUQ the teleohone directories and
encyclopedias which are used on a daily basis by other Divisions. The _
space into which the FBIHQ Library was to have been moved in the Sth and D
Building can be used and in fact is badly needed by the Domestic intelligence ©
Division which is very crowded. : . :

that any necessary realignment of personnel be considered by separaie :

Bureau Library at FBI Headquarters

A survey has been made of the library, its books, facility and
personnel. At the present time, the library is housed in six rooms in the 4200
corridor at FBI Headquarters and has a staff of the following: ‘|

‘

From a survey of the books, 411 books can be removed from the
library to the library at Quantico with exception to certain reference books
and out-of-town telephone directories which are necessary to be maintained at FBI
Headquarters for ready-reference purposes by the Bureau staff at Headquarters.
From the survey, it was determined these books can be. maintained jx two rooms”
presently occupied by the library, thus freeing four rooms as:gurplus spate”  -

“Ih the library is a lending library which has about 100 members. _
These members pay $1 every six months for membership dues and have the privilege
of using the library. Because of the minor use of this lending library, Iam proposin
that we phase out this part of the library during the next six months, removing the
books at the end of that period to Quantico. :

conversation but "Johnny", although friendly, was anxious
: to get to the point of his visit. The following is the essence
H “of "Johnny's" story as he told it to Colonel Edwards.
: “Colonel Edwards lct him talk freely and asked only a few
~+— questions since he did not consider it wise to interrogate
him or press him for further details. ‘ ee
.+ oo “- "Johnny" said that he had been approached on the street
: : ‘in Los Angeles by an FBI agent named Dodge, who said he
wanted to talk to him, He said that he told the agent that he
did not want to talk to him and kept on walking. Another
ee agent, named Hill joined "Johnny" and Dade as they walked
te “, down the street. The agents told him that the interview had
*" nothing to do with him personally and that they had nothing
against him. They tried to give him an envelope and a card.
i : "Johnny" said he told. them that if they had a legal document
tpt, with Gc
law, ‘but ae would have t to "deal with his attorney or have
his attorney present. The agents said they wanted to talk
to him alone and said it had nothing to do with him personally.
They proposed that they meet him in a suburb in Los Angeles,
- which "Johnny" said was ebout forty miles away (either at ©
. -. this point, or later through his attorney) they told him they
Vee wanted to talk to him on a matter they knew he did not want
- an attorney to know. They said it was a matter of National
Security. He still refused and they left him,

oe : “They left t him'and when he got back to his apartment

if the envelope was there. He said he did not open it but called
‘his attorney and had him openit, The envelope contained a
.picture of a women and a child about four years old.

"Johnny" said-the child was himself-at that age (Colonel
“Edwards tried to get a little more detail on the envelope and

ae the woman, but "Johnny" was very touchy on this), a

Hae “The attorney, a ere ey has talked to the FEL

experience in these thatters) felt at the time and still feels
that this is not the orthodox approach of the FBI and he is
puzzled, He Said to Golonel Edwards that if he did talk to
the FBI, he.was not going to tell them anything relating to
uae _ National Security (this was volunteered and Colonel Edwards
ee did.not advise on this point either pro or con),

"After "Johnny" had finished his tale, Colonel Edwards
‘asked him if he were being told this in confidence. "Johnny"
said no, that Colonel Edwards could tell anyone he wished.

= . Inthis regard, Colonel Edwards gave no advice and made
ce no commitment. He did tell him that he might tell his suc-
Page cessor (the undersigned) as a matter of information.

a ol
aie - "Colonel Edwards! estimat€ of this development is that
"Johnny" is in some kind of "bind" personally. Colonel
' Edwards referred to pn article in the Saturday Evening Post
+. on the Mafia and Sam, Giancanna, who is now in jail in
. oe Chicago. Colonel Edwards thinks that "Johnny" believes
oS : that if he talks to the FBI alone, Sam or Sam's friends will
4°" bélieve he is "talking" which would be fatal for "Johnny" -
he knows a lot about Sam. On the other hand, Colonel
_ Edwards believes that a enpnye: wants to keep square with
“the Bureau. :

“Colonel Edwards noted that "Johnny" barely finished
faa one drink, which is unusual for him, He left, saying he
ee _ was mecting his attorney, who was flying down from New
u York City on the shuttle _ (they had flown from Los Angeles
to New York together). " i

: Although "Johgny" did not say so, Colonel Edwards is of the
opinion that "Johnny" wanted this Agency to inform your Burcau of
‘these developments and is using this channel for this purpose. This
information is passed to you with the request that it not be released

Our report sets forth the traditional channel
for comaunist support of revolutionary activity in this :
country by the established basic revolutionary groups under
foreign domination such as the Communist Party, USA, and the , 4

hostile intelligence operations directed at the United States i
by the Soviet Unien, Cuba and Communist China.

Next we shoy the newer, bolder avenues of support
and direction being utilized by revolutionaries, often
without any attempt to conceal their purpose, These include
international conferences which in this period of history
are ostensibly for peace in Vietnam but which also have the
usual underlying goal of destroying United States prestige
in world affairs. The ease of international travel and
communication with revolutionary intent by New Left and black
ab abriaiachd adherents from the United States and abrosd is then
set forth. :

May 12,1975,

Thé Honorable Edward M. Kennedy
Chairman, Subcommittee on Adminis-—
trative Practice & Procedure
Committee on the Judiciary
Washington, D. C. 20510

Dear Senator Kennedy:

In response to your letter of April 24, 1975, Iam
presently able to provide you with most of the information
you have requested concerning the electronic surveillance

‘ activities of federal departments and agencies. The in-
formation contained in this letter and the enclosed material
relates mainly to electronic surveillance conducted within

. the United States pursuant to the criminal law enforcement
responsibilities of the federal government. It does not
include electronic surveillance that may be conducted either
in the interests of national security, or outside the United
States by federal departments and agencies other than the
‘Department of Justice. As to these latter areas, the De-
‘partment is still in the process of assembling and review-
ing the materials relevant to your request, and we are thus
unable at this time to determine what information we may be
able to provide. I should note that in several instances
your letter requests information that is either not in the
‘possession of this Department or pertains to areas outside
its proper jurisdiction. Since I understand that you have
sent similar letters to other federal departments and agen-
cies, I expect that you will receive responses from them.
‘Nevertheless, I believe the information contained in this
letter and the enclosed material will answer in substantial
part the questions you have raised concerning electronic
surveillance...

Apart from the area of national security, electronic
surveillance conducted within the United States by federal
@epartments and agencies may be divided into two broad |

categories: consensual and non-consensyal. Consensual
electronic surveillance refers to those instances in which
one or more parties to the communication is a federal agent,
is. ‘cooperating with a federal agent, or has consented to
the surveillance. Th. Supreme Court has repeatedly held
that the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment does
not apply to consensual surveillance. See, e.g., United
States v. White, 401 U.S. 745 (1971); Lopez v. White, 373

U.S.

427 (1963);

Rathbun v.

United States,

355 U.S. 107

(1957); On_Lee v. United States, 343 U.S. 747 (1952).

Con-

gress has also excepted consensual electronic surveillance
from the provisions of Title ITI of the Omnibus Crime Con-
trol and Safe Streets Act of 1968, including the requirement
of a court order. Thus, sections 2511(a) (c) and (a) of Title
18 of the United States Code provide:

(c) It shall not be unlawful under this
.|. | chapter for a person acting under color of law
| to intercept a wire or oral communication, where
: such person is a party to the communication or
one of the parties to the communication has given
prior consent to such interception.

: (a) It shall not be unlawful under this
chapter for a person not acting under color of
law to intercept a wire or oral communication
where such person is a.party to the communication
or, where one of the parties to the communication
has given prior consent to such interception un-’-'
iess such communication is intercepted forthe
purpose of committing any criminal or tortious
act in violation of the Constitution or laws of
rt ., the United States or of any State or for the pur-
| pose of committing any other injurious act.

Although consensual electronic surveillance may thus
be conducted without a court order, its use by federal agents
has been subject to regulations issued by the Attorney, General
since 1967. The current regulations are specified in Attorney
General Kleindienst's memorandum of. October 16, 1972 entitled
“Memorandum to the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies,

Re: Monitoring Private Conversations with the Consent of

a Party," and in a subsequent amending order issued by
Attorney General Saxbe. Copies of the memorandum and order
are enclosed herein.

In general, all federal agencies and departments
are required to obtain advance authorization from either
the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Criminal
Division, or Deputy Assistant Attorney General cf that
Division before any electronic device may be used to over-
hear, transmit, or record a private conversation, other than
a telephone conversation, without the consent of all the
. parties to that conversation. In exigent circumstances
precluding a prior request for authorization ~- such as
imminent loss of essential evidence or a threat to the
immediate safety of an agent or informant -- emergency
monitoring may be instituted with the authorization of the
head of the responsible department or agency or his designee.
The Assistant Attorney General of the Criminal Division, how-
+ ever, must be notified promptly of any such monitoring and
of the specific conditions that precluded obtaining prior
approval. :

The above procedures do not apply to consensual moni-
toring of telephone conversations. Because they involve the
transmission of a participant's voice through a complex and
far-reaching network of wires, the common use of party lines
and extension telephones, and the possibility of an unseen
participant permitting another person to listen on the same
extension, telephone conversations have long been thought
not to enjoy the same expectation of privacy as face-to-face
conversations. For this reason, supervision and control over
consensual monitoring of telephone conversations are vested
instead in the- head of each federal department and agency,
who is required to adopt appropriate regulations and pro-
cedures on the subject. These regulations usually do not
restrict consensual monitoring of telephone conversations in
any significant respect. The relevant regulations of the
Drug Enforcement Administration are enclosed herein. :

NW 65360 Docld:32989714 Page 329

Hon. Edward M. Kennedy
May 12, 1975

The current regulations issued by the Attorney
General also require the head of each federal department
and agency to exercise responsibility fox the security of
all consensual monitoring devices, including the maintenance
of current inventories as to amounts, storage, and users of
such equipment, and to submit to the Attorney General dur-
ing July of each year a report containing an inventory of
all electrenic and mechanical equipment designed for the
monitoring of conversations and a brief statement of the
results obtained from their use during the prior fiscal year.

All federal departments and agencies having criminal
investigative responsibilities .are authorized to conduct con-
sensual electronic surveillance. These agencies include,
inter-alia, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, the
Bureau of Customs, the Department of Agriculture, the Internal
Revenue Service, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the

+ Drug Enforcement Administration, the Postal Service, the
Secret Service, the Department of Defense, the Naval Investi-

‘ gative Service, the Immigration and Naturalization Service,

and the Department of Interior. The number of consensual
uses of electronic surveillance devices authorized by the
Department of Justice between 1970 and 1974 is set forth in

- the attached memoranda. The total annual authorizations were
as follows: 1970, 512; 1971, 840; 1972, 1272; 1973, 1484;
1974, 2518. In the first quarter of 1975, the total number
of authorizations was 1,125. Jn March 1975, the total author-
ized was 461. The above figures, of course, do not include
consensual monitoring of telephone conversations. Nor do
they include consensual electronic surveillance that may be
conducted either outside the United States or in the inter-
ests of national security.

“” Apart from the area of national security and foreign
intelligence, non-consensual electronic surveillance within
the United States is conducted pursuant to a court order.
Under Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets

.. Act of 1968, the Attorney General may authorize an applica-
« tion to a federal judge of a competent jurisdiction, who may

ment of Justice. With the exception of the Drug Enforce-
ment Administration, no division, bureau, or agency of

this Department conducts electronic surveillance outside
the United States for any purpose, including national
security. The Drug Enforcement Administration does con-
duct electronic surveillance outside the United States in
certain limited circumstances, This surveillance is pres-
ently ‘undertaken only on a bilateral basis, that is, with
the approval and participation of the foreign country in-
volved. It is my understanding, however, that a predecessor
organization of DEA did conduct non-consensual electronic
surveillance unilaterally in at least one instance occurring
in 1973. The surveillance was initiated in connection with
‘that organization's criminal law enforcement responsibilities
and was designed to obtain information concerning inter-
national drug traffickers. The subject of the surveillance
was a foreign national, and not an American citizen or an
alien resident of the United States. °

i Under its current policy, DEA does not conduct ‘any
non-consensual electronic surveillance abroad without the
approvel and participation of the foreign country. In al-
most all cases, the surveillance is actually conducted by
law enforcement officials of the foreign country, rather
than by DEA, and is not initiated as the result of a request
by DEA. I am informed that the instances in which DEA has
been responsible in any way for electronic surveillance
conducted abroad are exceedingly few, and that in none of
these was the subject of the surveillance an American citizen
or an alien resident of the United States.

Under existing regulations, the approval of the U.S.
Chief of Mission in the host country is required before DEA
May conduct, or request a foreign country to conduct, non-
consensual]. electronic surveillance outside the United States.
In addition, I have ordered that henceforth DEA shall obtain
the prior approval of the Attorney General before conducting,
or requesting anyone else to conduct, non-consensual elec-
tronic surveillance outside the United States where the sub~
ject of the surveillance is an American citizen or alien resi-

dent of the United States. Although the approval of the
Attorney General has not been required previously, as indi-
cated above there have apparently been no instances in
which an American citizen or resident has been the subject
of non-consensual electronic surveillance conducted abroad -
by DEA or initiated at its request.

On occasion DEA has also conducted consensual elec-
tronic surveillance outside the United States, usually in- ~
volving the use of a voice transmitter concealed on an
informant, a DEA agent, or a law enforcement officer of the
host country. Under DEA's current policy, this transmitter
device is used with the specific approval and participation
of the foreign country. Again, in almost all cases, the
Surveillance is actually conducted-by a law enforcement

official of the foreign country, rather than by DEA, and
DEA's involvement is in general limited to supplying the
equipment necessary to conduct the surveillance. So far as
DEA can determine, no American citizen or alien resident of
the United States has been the subject of consensual elec-
tronic surveillance conducted abroad through use of this
device by DEA, of by’a foreign country at DEA's request.

I have ordered that whenever practicable DEA shall
obtain the advance approval of the Assistant Attorney General
in charge of the Criminal Division, or Deputy Assistant: At-
torney General of that Divisiori, before conducting, or re-
questing anyone else to conduct, consensual electronic sur-
veillance outside the United States where the subject of the
surveillance is an American citizen or alien resident of the
United States. Where circumstances preclude a prior request
‘for, authorization, DEA may conduct the surveillance, but
shall notify promptly the Assistant Attorney General in charge
of the Criminal Division of the surveillance and the specific
conditions that precluded obtaining prior approval. This
procedure parallels that outlined in Attorney General Klein-
dienst's memorandum of October 16, 1972 governing consensual
electronic surveillance within the United States by federal
departments and agencies. It applies, of course, only to

private-conversations, other than telephone conversations,
that are sought to be monitored without the consent of
all the parties to that conversation. For the reasons
mentioned earlier, prior approval for consensual monitor-

ing of telephone conversations is not required.

: DEA has also used certain electronic devices abroad
-in order to track the location of drug shipments. These
devices do not transmit, overhear, or record private con-
versations, but rather merely emit signals which indicate
oee location of the device.

DEA's policy concerning electronic surveillance
has aiso been described in ils response to your lctter of
April 24 to Mr. Bartels. The remaining divisions, bureaus,
and agencies within the Department do not conduct electronic
surveillance of any kind outside the United States.

X trust that the information I have furnished will
_assist your subcommittee in its inquiry concerning the prac-
“tices and procedures of the federal agencies in the area of
electronic surveillance. z

The Honorable Edward M. Kennedy : i
Chairman, Subcommittee on Administrative suas es

Practice and Procedure
Committee on the Judiciary :
Washington, D. C. 20510 ~ :

Dear Senator Kennedy:

In my letter to you of May 12, I stated that the De-
partment was in the process of assembling the materials’ rele-
vant to your inquiry regarding electronic surveillance con-
ducted within the United States in the interests of national
security and foreign intelligence. Pursuant to a review of
this matter, I am able to provide you with the following in-
formation.

Since 1940 by directives of the President, the Attorney
General has been vested with responsibility over electronic
surveillance conducted within the United States in the inter-
ests of national security and foreign intelligence. This sur-
veillance is authorized pursuant to the personal approval of
the Attorney General, rather than by court order. Based on :
- an examination of the relevant precedents, it is the position
of the Department of Justice that the Executive may conduct
electronic surveillance in the interests of national security
and foreign intelligence, and in aid of his conduct of the
nation's foreign affairs, without obtaining a judicial warrant.
“This has been the position of the Department of Justice for more
than three decades and is supported by historical practice as
‘well as judicial decision. The only two Courts of Appeals to
address the issue, the Third Circuit and the Fifth Circuit, have
held that the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment does
‘not apply in the area of-national security and foreign intelli-
- gence.and.that under. the.Constitution the President. has the -. -. - =
_ authority to conduct electronic surveillance without a court
order as part of his diplomatic and military or commander-in- :
chief functions. See United States v. Butenko (Appeal of Ivanov),
494 F.2d 593 (3rd Cir. 1974) (en banc), cert. denied sub nom. ]

NW 65360 ,Docld:32989714 Page 335 =



26 419 U.S. 881 (1974); United States
ve. Bre rown, GBA FL2d rae (5th Cir. 1973), cert. denied, 415
U.S. 0 (1974). In Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control

and Safe Streets Act of 1968, Congress also explicitly dis-
claimed any attempt to place limitations on the President's
authority in this area. 18 U.S.C. § 2511(3). The Supreme

Court has, of course, expressly left open the question whether
the warrant requirement applies to electronic surveillance con-
ducted for national security and foreign intelligence pur-
poses. In United States v. United States District Court, 407
U.S. 297, 308-9 (1973), however, the Court, while holding that
the domestic security area was subject to the: warrant require~
ment, was careful to note that "the instant case requixes no ;
judgment with respect to. the activities of foreign powers, with-
in or without this country. . . There is no evidence of any
involvement, directly or indirectly, of a.foreign power." More~
over, in the Butenko case, although the United States prevailed
in the Third Circuit, the Department acquiesced in the petition
for certiorari. Nevertheless, the Court denied certiorari,

thus leaving undisturbed the Third Circuit's decision upholding
the authority of the Executive to conduct electronic surveil-
lance wiilwuut a court order opal security and foreign |
intelligence is involved.

Under the standards and procedures established by the
President, the personal approval of the Attorney General is re-
quired before any non-consensual electronic surveillance may
be instituted within the United States without a judicial war~
rant. All requests for surveillance must be made in writing by
‘the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and must
set forth the relevant factual circumstances that justify the
proposed surveillance. Both the agency and the Presidential
appointee initiating the request must be identified. Requests
from.the Director are examined by a special review group which

. I have established within the Office of the Attorney General.
Authorization will not be granted unless the Attorney General.
has satisfied himself that the requested electronic surveillance
is necessary for national security or foreign intelligence ie
Poses important to national: security. :

In addition, the Attorney General must be satisfied that
the subject of the surveillance is either assisting a foreign

NW 65360 Docid:32989714 Page 336 can


ae fag | a

power or foreign-based political group, or plans unlawful
activity directed against a foreign power or foreign-based
political group. Finally, he must be satisfied that the

. minimum physical intrusion necessary to obtain the informa-
tion will be used.

: !

‘All authorizations are for a period of ninety days or
less, and the specific approval of the Attorney General is
again required for continuation of the surveillance beyond
that period. The Attorney General has also been directed to
review all electronic, surveillance on a regular basis to en-
sure that the aforementioned criteria are satisfied. Pursu-
ant to the mandate of United States v. United States District
Court, electronic surveillance without a judicial warrant is
not conducted where there is no foreign involvement.

All electronic surveillance rélated to national security
and foreign intelligence within the United States is conducted
by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The Bureau has estab-
lished strict internal review procedures with regard to all
electronic surveillance activities.

The extent of telephone and microphone surveillance

conducted within the United States in the interests of nation-
al security and foreign intelligence was last disclosed in 1973.
On a comparable basis, the extent of such surveillance between
1969 arid May 1975 is set forth in the attached memoranda. The
total number of subjects of telephone surveillance during that
period is as follows: 1969, 113; 1970, 90; 1971, 87;-1972, 102;
1973, 116; 1974, 148. These figures do not, of course, indicate
the number of persons whose conversations were intercepted,, but
rather only the number of subjects to whom the surveillance was
directed. The total number of subjects of microphone surveillance
+ during that period was as follows: 1969, 14; 1970, 19; 1971, 16;
1972, 31; 1973, 38; 1974, 32. Again, these figures do not in-
dicate the number of persons whose conversations were inter-
cepted, but rather the number of subjects to whom the sur-
veillance was directed. , Moreover, I should further note that
the above figures are duplicative to an extent since in: several
cases the same subject was under both telephone and microphone

- Surveillance. : : uaseees

: “The total installations of telephone and microphone sur-
veillances during the above periods would, of course, exceed

NW 65360 Docld:32989714 Page 337


SS ee :
these figures by varying margins. On occasion, the sub-

ject under surveillance moved to a new location, thus nec-
essitating a re-‘nstallation of the surveillance at the new
address. On other occasions, the surveillance was discon-
tinued because the subject left the premises for an extended
period, but was later re-instituted when the subject returned.
In still other cases, the surveillance was discontinued for a
period as part of the Department's continuing review and re-

“ evaluation of all electronic surveillance activities. The
subsequent re-institution of the surveillance pursuant to a

new approval by the Attorney General would be counted as an

additional installation. For the above reasons, the. number

of installations of telephone and microphone surveillances ‘is
greater than the number of subjects of such surveillance, and

would thus not provide an accurate basis’ for evaluating the
extent of electronic surveillance. Nevertheless, pursuant to

your inquiry, I am including in the attached memoranda the total

number of installations of electronic surveillance devices for
both telephone and microphones. :

I am.also enclosing the maximm and minimim numher oF
telephone and microphone surveillances installed and in opera-
tion for each month between November 1972 and April 1975. These
figures are based on data compiled on a daily basis and reflect
installations and discontinuances of electronic surveillance de~
vices. The records of daily counts were initiated in November
1972. Comparable information is not available for prior periods.
As these figures indicate, the maximum number of telephone sur- —
veillances in operation at any time during 1973 was 93; the
minimem number in operation that year was 65. The maximum
number of microphone surveillances in operation during 1973
was 22; the minimum was 10. In 1974, the maximum number of
telephone surveillances in operation was 106; the minimum num-
ber in operation was 75. Microphone surveillances in operation
‘during that period ranged from a maximum of 21 to a minimum of
10. During the first four and a half months of 1975, the maxi-
mum number of telephone surveillances in operation at any time
was 91; the minimum was 67. The. maximum number of microphone
surveillances in operation at any time during that period was
20; the minimum was 9. On April 1, 1975, there were 75 tele-
phone and 15 microphone surveillances in operation.

‘I trust that the information supplied to date is of
assistance to your subcommittee in its inquixy-into the prac-
