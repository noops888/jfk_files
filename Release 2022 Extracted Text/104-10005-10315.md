MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, CI Liaison
FROM : SR/CI/R

SUBJECT 3 ° Questions Concerning Defectors
Joseph J, DUTKANICZ (201-289236) and
Vladimir O. SLOBODA (201-287527)

1. DUTKANICZ's Army assignment at time of defection.

USAREUR Case Summary 2-62-2 (copy attached) confirms
DUTKANICZ's assignment to the 32nd Signal Battalion in Darmstadt.
However, his wife indicated that he had CIC connections. In an interview
at the American Embassy Moscow on 5 December 1961 (cited in DBA-288,

24 January 1962), she indicated that their trip behind the Iron Curtain "had
been made possible because her husband worked for the CIC and was allowed
to do things the ordinary 'GI' could not do." There are also penciled no-
tations in the 201 file suggesting that his Army assignment may have included
intelligence functions of some kind.

2. Previous KGB connection of both defectors.

Per USAREUR Case Summary 2-62-2, DUTKANICZ himself
told American Embassy officials in Moscow that he had been approached by
KGB representatives in a bar near Darmstadt in 1958 and had accepted
recruitment as a result of their threats and inducements. He claimed to
have given them minimum cooperation from then until his defection, although
the Army considered it probable that he had done more than he admitted. A
further indication of his KGB involvement before defection is the fact that the
special decree granting him Soviet citizenship was enacted three months before
his arrival in the USSR; see Emb tel 851.

SLOBODA's prior KGB involvement was confirmed by BEVISION,
as reported in YT-1192. See attached memorandum of 28 March 1962 in
regard to passage of this information to the Army. Further indications are
the facts that SLOBODA was a KGB resettlement case and that he later told
an American Embassy Moscow official that he had been blackymailed and
framed into going to the USSR. See Moscow Emb tels A-572, 23 October 1962,
and 851, 23 March 1962.

3. Army security investigations as immediate cause of defection.

Per USAREUR Case Summary 2-62-2, DUTKANICZ told American
Embassy Moscow officials that he had informed his KGB handler that he was
under investigation for security reasons. He defected soon after, in accord
with a KGB suggestion that he do so.

SLOBODA's defection was precipitated by increased Army
security measures, according to BEVISION.

Summary

Dutkanice claims ho was recruited by representatives of Scviet
intelligence in West Germany during 1958. A combination of threats and
inducements' were used to gain his cooperation. He admits having had
four meetings with his Soviet handlers during a two-year period, but
claims he supplied only limited infcrmation to the KGB. There are, how-
ever, substantial indications that the compromise was greater. His
espionage activity was terminated by his defection to the USSR in June |
1960. He was subsequently exploited for propaganda purposes by the
Soviets. Details of his complicity were obtained from statements made
by Dutkanicz to US cee aera in Moscow.

E&I and Assignmonts

Dutkanicz's principal mission was to report changes in the status +
a and Gispesition of USAREUR forces indicating possible preparations for

“hostilities. Ho also admits receiving detailed instructions from the. ~
4 SIS which probably included additional collection EEI, but he did not
elabcrate. cn these missions.

Recruitment and Modus Operandi

Dutkanicz, a naturalized US citizen born in Poland, was. shipped to
Gerany in 1943 as:a slave laborer and immigrated to the United States:
, aftor World War II. Ne was drafted into the US Army in 1951: and wa cy

Sergeant in the 32nd Signal Battalion, Darmatadt, at the. time of :;

; defection. He is a convinced liberal and has espoused leftist cause: *
igia~ which led to a review and reve cation of his SECRET: olearance in. January ©
1960. : :

«°° Dutkaniez claims he was approached by KGB personnel in 1958 while *
drinking in a bar at Crumstadt,,neur Varmstadt. ‘In the initial: con-2:. =
versation, a combination of threats and inducements were used to obtain
his promise of cooperation.’ The threats were mostly implied and

‘directed against relatives in Poland, his immediate family in West’ °°:
Germany.and !luatkanicg personally. Inducements consisted of promises..to
assist relatives residing behind the Iron “urtain. He also admite having

instigated by:the Soviets for Propaganda purposes ‘after-he lost access

* controlling agency was the KGB. ° He admits: having four meetings with
the. KGB representatives, who were allegedly. from Vienna, Austria,”

during the period 1958 to 1960. He was furnished: an. accommodations |
address which he no’ longer remembers and * was) ‘given secret. writing —
materials,’ He claims to have sent only four letters to the accommo-
dations address and he alleges to have furnished only negative
imminence reports.

In May 1960 Dutkanicz informed his SIS handler that he was. being
investigated for security reasons and he was advised to apply for.
leave and defect with his wife and family to the USSR via Austria and
Czechoslovakia. Dutkanicz complied with the instructions. Contact
with KGB representatives was established on 26 June 1960 in Bratislava,
Czechoslovakia, a short distance from Vienna. He and his family then
drove to Lvév, USSR, with a Soviet escort. He was subsequently
exploited by the Soviets for propaganda purposes. The actual propaganda
material was prepared by the KGB based on details furnished by
Dutkanicz. In March 1962 the Soviets permitted his wife to return to
the United States, but the children were retained in the USSR. Dutkanicz
was allowed to accompany his wife to the US Embassy in Moscow for making
the necessary preparations for her return. During this period Dutkanicz
made a statement concerning his espionage activities in behalf of the
KGB.

USAREUR Comment

Although Dutkanicz's confession was obtained under unusual ciroum-
stances, his statements appear substantially true although obviously
inoomplete. A strong possibility exists that he worked for tho KGB for
a longer period than he admits, and it is probable that Dutkanicz pro- ©
vided the KGB with considerably more information than negative imminence
reports. His statement that his SIS recruiters were from Vienna-is ’
possibly correct and is supported by his alleged defection route. His
statement that he refused payment from the SIS seems unlikely, since he
reportedly was spending considerable amounts of money before. his defection.
The. case is of unusual significance since it constitutes one: of the most
serious known penetrations of USAREUR forces by hostile intelligence.
Also important is the fact that Dutkanicz's defection was apparently.
