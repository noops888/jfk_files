SUBJECT

°Questions Concerning Defectors

Joseph J. DUTKANICZ (201-289236) and

Vladimir 0. SLOBODA (201-287527)

1. DUTKANICZ's Army assignment at time of defection.

USAREUR Case Summary 2-62-2 (copy attached) confirms

DUTKANICZ's assignment to the 32nd Signal Battalion in Darmstadt.

However, his wife indicated that he had CIC connections. In an interview

at the American Embassy Moscow on 5 December 1961 (cited in DBA-288,

24 January 1962), she indicated that their trip behind the Iron Curtain "had

been made possible because her husband worked for the CIC and was allowed

to do things the ordinary 'GI' could not do." There are also penciled no-

tations in the 201 file suggesting that his Army assignment may have included

intelligence functions of some kind.

2. Previous KGB connection of both defectors.

Per USAREUR Case Summary 2-62-2, DUTKANICZ himself

told American Embassy officials in Moscow that he had been approached by

KGB representatives in a bar near Darmstadt in 1958 and had accepted

recruitment as a result of their threats and inducements. He claimed to

have given them minimum cooperation from then until his defection, although

the Army considered it probable that he had done more than be admitted. A

further indication of his KGB involvement before defection is the fact that the

special decree granting him Soviet citizenship was enacted three months before

his arrival in the USSR; see Emb tel 851.

SLOBODA's prior KGB involvement was confirmed by BEVISION,

as reported in YT-1192. See attached memorandum of 28 March 1962 in

regard to passage of this information to the Army. Further indications are

the facts that SLOBODA was a KGB resettlement case and that he later told

an American Embassy Moscow official that he had been black mailed and

framed into going to the USSR. See Moscow Emb tels A-572, 23 October 1962,

and 851, 23 March 1962.

3. Army security investigations as immediate cause of defection.

Per USAREUR Case Summary 2-62-2, DUTKANICZ told American

Embassy Moscow officials that he had informed his KGB handler that he was

under investigation for security reasons. He defected soon after, in accord

with a KGB suggestion that he do so.

SLOBODA's defection was precipitated by increased Army

security measures, according to BEVISION.

Summary

Dutkanice claiing ho was recruited by representatives of Siviet

Intelligence in Wect Germany during 1958. A combination of threats and

inducements' were used to gain his cooperation. He admits having had

four meetings with his Soviet handlers during a two-year period, but

claims he supplied only limited infornation to the KGB.

There are, hor-

ever, substantial indications that the compromise was greater.

espionage

activity was terminated by his defection to the USSR in June

He was subsequently exploited for propaganda purposes

Soviets.

Details of his complicity were obtained from statements made

1 Dutkanice to US officials in Moscow.

Eit and Assignmonts

Dutianicz's principal mission was to report changes in the status

and cisposition of USARGUR forces indicating possible preparationo for

hostilities. Ho also adnits receiving detailed instructions fron the

SIS which probably included additional collection EEI, but he did not

elabrrate. on these missions.

Recruitment and Mudus Operand1

Dutkaniez,

a naturalized Us citizen born in Poland, was shipped to

Gormany in 1943 as a slave laborer and immigrated to the United States

aftor ilorld War II.

He was drafted Into the US Army in 1951 and was a

surgeant in the 32nd Siznal Battalion, Darnatadt, at the time of

defection.

He is a convincod liberal and has espoused leftist causes:

led to a review and revucation of his SECRET clearance In January

1960.

Dutkanicz claims he was approached by KGB personnel in 1958 while

drinking in a bar at Crumstadt, neur varmstadt. In the initial con-

versation, a combination of threats and inducements were used to obtain

his promise of cooperation. The threats were mostly implied and

directed against relatives in Poland, his immediate family in West

Germany and latkanica personally. Inducements consisted of promises to

asdist relatives residing behind the Iron urtain. He also admits having

been offered noney on several occasions, but he allegedly refused to

accept payment for hia esmionage activitles. Dutkanioz claime that the

CONSPANTIAL OF

controlling agency was the KGB. He admits having four meetings with

the KGB representatives, who were allegedly from Vienna, Austria,

during the period 1958 to 1960.

He was furnished an accommodations

address

which he

no longer remembers and was given secret vriting

materials. He claims to have sent only four letters to the accommo-

dations address and he alleges to have furnished only negative

imminence reports.

In May 1960 Dutkanicz informed his SIS handler that he was being

investigated for security reasons and he was advised to apply for

leave and defect with his wife and family to the USSR via Austria

Czechoslovakia. Dutkanicz complied with the instructions.

Contact

with KGB representatives was established on 26 June 1960 in Bratislava,

Czechoslovakia, a short distance from Vienna.

He and his family then

drove to Lvov, USSR, with a Soviet escurt. He was subsequently

exploited by the Soviets for propaganda purposes. The actual propaganda

material was prepared by the KGß based on details furnished by

Dutkanicz.

In March 1962 the Suviets permitted his wife to return to

the United States, but the children were retained in the USSR. Dutkaniez

was allowed to accompany his wife to the US Embassy in Moscow for making

the necessary preparations for her return. During this period Dutkanicz

made a statement concerning his espionage activities in behalf of the

KGB.

USAREUR Comment

Although Dutkanicz's confession was obtained under unusual ciroun-

stances, his statements appear substantially true although obviously

inoomplete.

A strong possibility exists that he worked for tho KGB for

a longer period than he admits, and it 1s probable that Dutkanioz pro-

the KGB with considerably more information than negative imminence

reports. His statement that his SIS recruiters were from Vienna is:

possibly correct and is supported by his alléged defection route. Hie

statement that he refused payment from the Sis seems unlikely, since he

reportedly

was spending considerable amounts of money before his defection.

The case 18 of unusual significance since it constitutes one of the most

serious known penetrations of USARDUR forces by hostile intelligence.

Also important is the fact that Dutkanicz'a defection was apparently

instigated by the Soviets for propaganda purposes after he lost access

to sensitive information.

Additional reports will be prepared as information becomes available.

MOMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

Subject: , JACUAR Request for Questions to be usedin interview with

Mrs. Illian SLOBODA, wife of American defector

Vladimir SLOBODA

1. IOND 0883 (IN 47926) of 23 March 1962 regarding the Subject

was discussed with Mi°. James Hunt, DC/CI on 27 March 1962. He was

asked if the Amy had been advised of BEVISION's identification

Of SIOBODA as a KGB arent (YT-1192, 16 January 1962) and if this

information shold be passed to JACUAR. Mr. Hunt said that the

Army was somewhat embarrassed about this case since SLOBODA had

"flunked 4 or 5 ICFLUTTER examinations" before his defection,

80

the infornation had not been passed to the Army." As noted in IT-1192,

SLOBODA was not particularly important, according to BEVISION,

and Hunt belicved the army assumed he was an RIS agent when he

went over the hill.

Mr. Hunt saw no reason to five the information to JAGUAR

but sugrested that

in our cable we say SLOBODA was presumed RIS.

The Polish Desk said that BEVISION is currently being

interrogated by the Army and they probably will ask him questions

about SI,OBODA.
