Subject: Cuban Exile Reactions to the
Resignation of Dr. José MIRO Cardona

1. This memorandum is for your information and is
in response to your request for an updating of reference .
memorandum,

2. Our Station in Miami reports that Dr. MIRO has
called a meeting of the Cuban Revolutionary Council (CRC).
for. today. to reiterate his intention to resign and actually

bed go. through with his resignation if he does not receive word
_ that the President wants to. discuss the matter with him or
if he receives no indication from Washington that there
is a definite plan for the liberation of Cuba. The final
decision may be postponed until 18 April, at which time it
is expected that Dr. MIRO*s resignation will be formally
accepted. MIRO would accept a military man, such as
General Maxwell Taylor as an emissary from the President,
_ but does not want to deal with a “Harvard Professor." MIRO
would expect this emissary to be able to point to specific
United States policies and programs for the overthrow of
the CASTRO regime.

3. Our Station in Miami further reports that Dr.
MIRO has decided not to release his entire 25 page
resignation statement to the press in its present form
as it. is too long to. be published in the newspapers except
as a paid advertisement. MIRO does intend, however,



13-00000 ~

SECRET

to delete quotes from high level United States Government
officials and issue instead a “hard hitting" statement
based on the substance of the 25 page document.

4. It is Dr. MIRO*s opinion that when he resigns
the CRC will liquidate itself. He feels that the United
States Department of State had planned the liquidation
of the CRC as one of the last steps in the development
of a co-existence policy with the CASTRO regime. When
his resignation becomes effective, Dr. MIRO feels it
will be impossible for him to continue living in the
United States after all the furor created by this
incident. It has previously been reported that Dr. MIRO
might leave the United States to form an organization
similar to the CRC in another friendly country.

5. Meanwhile, there appears to be sharp differences
of opinion within the CRC and’ among other independent
exile groups and individuals as to the wisdom of Dr.
MIRO*s precipitous action in threatening to publish his
letter of resignation, thus causing the alienation of
the United States Government and the probable collapse
of the CRC itself. Dr.-MIRO is confident that the CRC
will support his action and its members will, in turn,
use his resignation as an occasion for denouncing current
United States policy on Cuba. According to Dr. MIRO,
the Revolutionary Students* Directorate (DRE); and the
Association of Cuban Lawyers in Exile have pledged their
support to him and will make public statements in his
behalf. He claims that he is receiving messages of
support from Mexico, Brazil and Chile, some requesting
copies of his 25 page resignation statement. A plan to
create. a Hemisphere-wide organization to begin a
campaign to free Cuba is allegedly underway.

6. Dr. MIRO claims that the United States Government

is now taking the line of insulting and attacking him

and he has declared that. he "will not stand for being
insulted" by the U.S. Government in addition to the
followers of BATISTA and CASTRO. He added that CASTRO*s
announced support of United States Government treatment
of him tends to support his suspicion that the U. 8S.
Government is following a line of péaceful co-existence.



13-00000 .

He states that he has heard from "friends," whom he did
not further identify, that the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee might request him to testify before that
committee. Although reluctant to get involved in a
political situation in which certain questions would

be asked which he feels probably should not be answered,
he would, of course, comply, if subpoenaed. He has sent
word to Cuban trainees in the U. S. Army not to abandon
théir training, having heard that a number of Cuban exiles
undergoing officer training had their bags packed ready
to leave Fort Benning as a result of the incident
concerning him.

7. The Miami Herald of 12 April, speculated that
MIRO may be using the United States anti-raid decree
and threatened resignation in order to win support from
exile groups not affiliated with the CRC. A spokesman
for one such group claimed that Dr. MIRO was displaying
to exile leaders a letter from President Kennedy purported-
ly pledging United States aid to exiles in their fight to
liberate Cuba. According to The Miami Herald, opposition
to United States anti-raid policy has brought about exile
unity not seen since April 1961. UPI correspondent Adolfo
Merino is preparing a campaign in favor of Dr. MIRO,
according to Dr. MIRO. Merino allegedly told Dr. MIRO
that there appears to be a campaign in Washington to.
denigrate Dr. MIRO, and he intends to counter this campaign.
Merino also stated that he knew the contents of Dr. MIRO*s
25 page resignation statement although he had not personally
seen. the document itself.

8. A Miami Station source reports that the present
crisis between Dr. MIRO and the United States Government
has caused great and wide-spread pessimism in exile groups.
This is not due to any popular support which Dr. MIRO has
among the exiles, but because of the issue involved, i.e.,
the restrictions imposed upon Cuban exile efforts to
defeat CASTRO, and upon this issue the exiles are compelled
to support Dr. MIRO whether they like him or not.

9. It is noteworthy that Manuel Antonio de VARONA
Loredo, a leading member of the CRC and one of the most
outspoken critics of the United States policy on. Cuba,
privately believes that Dr. MIRO has gone too far and too
fast in-his dispute with the Kennedy administration.

VARONA understands that MIRO was asked by Washington
officials to wait 30 days before taking a definitive
position and thus be able to view the crisis more

calmly, but MIRO refused. VARONA believes that the
abruptness of this action was an error on MIRO*ts part.
VARONA said that he.is opposed to the publication of
MIRO*s resignation because the document touches upon
sensitive and confidential areas and would be prejudicial
to the Cuban cause. He hopes that a middle course can
be found as a way out of the present crisis. There
appears to be some sentiment in the CRC to continue the
organization with a new president. . Enrique HUERTAS Pozo,
head of the Cuban exile doctors* association, has

hinted that he would be prepared to step into the vacant
presidency of the CRC.

10. Dr. MIRO'fs rivals and enemies in the Cuban
exile community are reportedly making plans to exploit
the political vacuum which they expect will be created
by the resignation of Dr. MIRO and the anticipated
collapse of the CRC. Followers of Manuel RAY Rivero
are reported to be pleased with the crisis between
the CRC and the United States Government and hope that
the split becomes irrevocabhe. If Dr. MIRO resigns
they believe that RAY, with the backing of liberal
Latin American leaders, will become the principal
Cuban exile leader. Although Manuel ARTIME Buesa,
secretary general of the MRR and former political chief
of the Brigade, has extended his support to Dr. MIRO
in the present crisis, it is known that ARTIME has
nothing but contempt for MIRO. This may, therefore,
be a political tactic to encourage MIRO to break relations
between the CRC and the United States Government and
thus place ARTIME in a more advantageous position,
vis a vis, the Cuban exile community and the United
States Government. One group, the Peoples* Revolutionary
movement (MRP), which had recently decided to join
the CRC, changed its plan when Dr. MIROts controversial
resignation was publicized. The MRP leaders came to
the conclusion that the CRC was finished and they
thereupon entered into negotions to omalgamate with
the ALPHA 66 and the Second National Front. of the
Escambray. (SKEE). Followers of former President
Fulgencio BATISTA are reported to be delighted with
MIROts difficulties and they now feel that MIRO is
getting what he deserves for having played the role
of a U.S. puppet.

11. In another development, related to, but sot



13-00000 -

-5-

directly a result of the MIRO situation, there appears
to be a movement within the Cuban Brigade to organize
a formal request for the return of the Brigade flag, .
which was peesented to President Kennedy at the Orange
Bowl ceremony for the Brigade on 29 December 1962,

An attempt will be made to obtain the support of those
members of the Brigade who are stationed at Fort
Jackson and Fort Benning who will be on leave in

Miami over the Easter weekend. Subsequent to this,

it is planned to circulate a letter to all local

Miami radio and T.V. outlets announcing the intention
of the Brigade to demand the return of their flag.

12... We conclude from the foregoing that Dr.
MIRO*s usefulness to the U.S. Government and to the
Cuban exile community has come to an end, even if he
should reconsider at the last moment his decision
to resign. His resignation and.the probable
disintegration of the CRC is likely to usher in a
period of. intense political. manuevering and jockeying
for status’ among the various political graups and
the many self-styled leaders in the Cuban exile
community. It is not likely that this process will
result in any greater degree of genuine unity and
cohesiveness in the Cuban exile community than has
existed in the past. More than ever, the prime.
target of these exile leaders in their efforts to
gain support and patronage will be.the United States
Government, without whose assistance, they are convinced,
no effort to unseat the CASTRO regime can be successful.

3. Discussed in some detail the Donovan negotiations in Cuba. Gave
the President a copy of Miskovsky's summary of the Donovan discussions
and a copy of my memorandum of April 15th on Cuba. President raised the,
question of Miro Cardona, stated that Cardona had misrepresented the facts.
I urged that the President not involve himself personally in a public argu-
ment with Miro Cardona.

I raised the question of the possibility of working on Castro with
the objective of disenchanting him with his Soviet relations causing him to
break relations with Khrushchev, to effect the removal of Soviet troops
from Cuba, reorient his policies with respect to Latin America, and
establish in Cuba government satisfactory to the rest of the Hemisphere.
I. explained to the President that the Cuban problem must be solved in
one of two ways; either the manner outlined above or alternatively, by
bringing consistent pressure of every possible nature on Khrushchev to
force his withdrawal from Cuba, and then'to bring about the downfall of
Castro by means which could be developed after the removal of the
Soviets troops (but not before) and thereafter establish a satisfactory
government in Cuba. I stated to the President that we were studying
both courses of action andI had not made up my mind concerning the
feasibility of either plan. The President thought both approaches should
be carefully examined and suggested the possibility of pursuing both
courses at the same time. In any event it was decided that we should

keep the Donovan channel open, I advised the President that Donovan
has to return to Havana at the end of the week and that I will see him
privately prior to his departure.

4, The President and I talked at some length concerning sabotage
in Cuba. I expressed grave doubts and pointed out the hazards from his
standpoint in view of the stand-down of the hit-and-run exile operations,
the danger of attribution, etc. The President seemed to question
whether active sabotage was good unless it was of a type that could
"come from within Cuba," I said this was very difficult and that the
initial operations conceived were from the sea. I said I thought a program
should be engaged in only if it was an essential building block in an
agreed program to remove the Soviets from Cuba and to take care of

Castro,

was concerned he had dismissed the entire matter. I told the President
I had not discussed the Board's report with the Board, but if they brought

1. James Donovan returned from Cuba yesterday after a four-
day visit. As a.result of talks with Castro, the Americans ‘imprisoned :
on the Isle of Pines are to be released on 22 April, During the intervening
period Castro will observe closely American policy toward Cuba and make
sure that the Red Cross deliveries are being concluded in good faith,

2. The main thrust of Donovan's discussion, however, was
political and can best be evaluated by a very confidential statement made
to Donovan by Doctor Vallejo, a close personal advisor of Castro who
was present at the meetings. Vallejo said Castro knew that relations
with the United States are necessary and Castro wanted these developed.
However, there are certain Cuban Government officials, communists,
who are strongly opposed, even more than certain: people in the United
States. These officials are under close surveillance. They have no
great following in Cuba; but if they rebelled at this time, Cuba would be
in chaos, He believed that Donovan and Castro could work out a plan for
a reasonable relationship between the two countries.

3, Donovan had two sessions with Castro, one for five hours, the
other for fourteen hours. A variety of subjects were covered including
the role of Red China in world politics, the Cuban economy, and Cuba's
role in Latin America. In discussing any subject Castro came around

Soviet Union useful, but Cuba under Castro he claims will never become
