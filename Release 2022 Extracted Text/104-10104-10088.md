“SUBJECT: Orlando Avila y Bosch

03

1. Mr. (Gremillion of the WH Haiti Desk called oa
25 May 1967 and stated that they

in New York that Rene Juares Leon
FBI in New York City on that date.
arrest of Leon had been issued by the District Court for the
Southern District of Florida cince he failed to appear for hie
arraignment in March 1967. He was indicted along with °3
Rolando Masferrer for plotting an invasion of Haiti. Mr.(Gremillica)
eaid that they had no operational interest in Leon, but their sources
had indicated Leon might beconsidered a political asect in the post
Davailier era in Haiti. Mr.(Gremillion asked my opinion as to
whether or not this possible ase of Leon might have an
effect on charges being dropped against him. I told

ay nora apri-eg agency peineerrrd apis gree

the United States Attorney would consider dropping the charges
since Leon had failed to appear before the court when ac ordered.

2 Icalled Mr. Morris, Internal Security Divisian,
Department of Justice, the atterney handling both the Masferrer
and Bosch prosecutions, and told him that Leen had been arrested.
It was in a previcus conversation with Mr. Morris that he told
me that the United States Attorney expected to obtain the indictment
against Bosch on 31 May 1967. Mr. Morris said that both the
United States Attorney and the Department of Justice were
censidering postpening the date of bringing the iadictment against
Boesch because cf the problems which had developed in Miami after
@ Cuban refugee named Rivero had been arrested. ‘The information
available indiestes that Orlando Besch has been the leader of the
protest demonstrations against Rivero’s arrest. tt would therefore
seem prudent to delay the indictment rather than precipitate
greater demonstrations in the Cuban community of Miami.
