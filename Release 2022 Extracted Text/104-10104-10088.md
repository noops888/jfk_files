MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECI: Orlando Avila y Bosch

03

Mr. (Gremtllion) of the WH Halt! Desk called on

25 May 1967 and seated that they had been advised by as anset

a New York laat Rose Juares LoOn bad been arrested by the

F'BI in Now York City on thas date. A bench warrant for tbe

arrest of Loon had bena laned by the Dlatzles Court for tbe

southern District of Floride elnce he falled to appear f0s his

arralgament in March 1967. He was indleted along with

Rolando Masferrer for plotting an lavasion ol Halti. Ms. (GrAmillion

naid thas they had so operational interest in Leon, bat their sources

had indicated Loan might be, connidered a political ascot la the post

Divallies ora in Haltl. Mi. (Gromillion asked may opinion as te

whether or not this possible future use of Leon might have an

ellect on the charges being droppod agalast hiza. I told

Mr. (Gremillion) that it seemed highly unlikely that the Judge or

the United Stares Attorney wonld consider dropping the charged

since Loan had falled to appoar before the court when no ordered.

2. I called MI. Morris, Interaal Security Divlolas.

Department of Justice, the attorney handling both the Maaferrer

and Bosch prosecutions, and told him that Leen had been arrested.

It was ta s previous conversation with MT. Morris that he told

se that the United States Attorney expected to obtain the ladletment

agrinal Bosch on 31 May 1967. Ms. Morris said that both the

United States Attorney and the Departuent of Justice were

considering postpontag the date ol bringing the tadletment againat

Bosch because of the probleras whies had developed in Miazai aftex

a Cuban relagae named Rivero had been arrested. The laformatlos

avallable indieates that Orlando Bosch has been the leader of the

proteat demonstrations agalnst Rivero's arrest. It would sherefore

seem prudent to delay the indictarent rather than precipitate

groates demonstrations la the Cubas communisy of Miami.
