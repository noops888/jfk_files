‘ , PROS AND CONS OF THE ROBERT MAHEU CASE

1, Senator Long has been told by Morris Shenker, his personal attorney, that Robert Maheu
was involved in certain assignments for this Agency. He is specifically aware of our interest in
the Onassia-Niarchus Case, as well as our use of Giancana (not the mission), Senator Long: allegedly
agreed to withhold the subpoena of Maheu if the Agency simply confirms Maheu's statement that he
has been utilized in the past on sensitive assignments for CIA. Senator Long reportedly does not
desire to know any of the particulars and reportedly agrees not to get the Agency involved through
other witnesses that may be called.

2. Ifthe Agency accepts this proposal, the following possibilities exist:

‘a. Ifthe Senator honors the agreement, the following Pros and Cons.exist:

b. Ifthe Senator does not honor the agreement, the following Pros and Cons exist:

Even though Maheu refers the Committee

to the Agency in this matter, the Giancana
situation could be most embarrassing,

First of all, even though Maheu would not

be involved in the questioning, the Committee
might call Giancana to testify. The attendant
publicity would possibly identify Maheu as

an Agency intermediary to other members of
the Giancana family,

If Maheu's association with the Agenc is
" _publicl identifig gy, ths may caus

information on the Djakarta incidouts.

The Senator could also leak it to the Press.

c. If the Agency does not accept Senator Long's. proposal, the following Pros and Cons exist:

PROS

We have made no admissions and have
furnished no validation to the Committee
concerning our association with Maheu,

We have not admitted to the Committee
our involvement in the Onassis or Giancana

affairs. We are ina position to simply

deny any involvement in wire tapping in
the Maheu case, which after all, is the
purpose of the hearings of the Long
Committee.

__CONS __

We risk arousing the ire of Maheu,

Morgan, and Shenker because of our lack
of cooperation.

Since the Senator has reportedly been
informed of our involvement with Maheu
and we have not acknowledged it, he may
then feel free to dig into the matter
completely since we have not furnished
him with the information,

‘Giancana may be called to testify and we

could not control Giancana.

. re
it Project HARPSTAR\ could

€ome into the picture asa result of the
television publicity involving Maheu.

Our involvement in the Giancana situation
would become known to other members of
the Giancana family.
