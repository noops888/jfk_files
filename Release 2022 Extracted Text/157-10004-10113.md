absolutely positive that the people involved in this E
plot, and primarily ROLANDO L.{CUBELAS, would definitely
an the near future make an attempt upon the lives of
FIDEL CASTRO and several other leading figures in
the Cuban Government. : : ‘

ESPINOSA on 6/25/65 stated that CIA probacly
was reluctant to commit itself to him but he felt sure
that one way or another, CIA must be fully cognizant
