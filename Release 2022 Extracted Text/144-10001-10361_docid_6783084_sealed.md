vote) on the question of ag for the Congo operations and UN forces in

the Near East fsee our Nro

From’the constant ‘emphasis that the new administration in Washington
will concentrate on internal matters and that it needs time before it will be
capable of conducting an active foreign policy, we surmise that they fear
pressure from our sjdeo
