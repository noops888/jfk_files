I am performing she same type Job which I dia in 1:45 ata CAF-4

I know that I an not proficient enough in the language for an
assignment in Latin America, and.fsel that I would be better off
in another area.

3.__For the benefit of the case officer in assigning a
replacement, has suggested that I outline the duties which
ny replacement whould be trained to perform. The routine can be
learned in the field within two or three weeks,

a) Copy typing. About 75% of the time will be taken
up with routine typing.

b) Index carding. About 600 index cards a week are now
being typed for the card files and for the visa section
tiles.

c) Preparation of courier mail. Couriers usually 59
te the border approximately every two weeks but there is

tz noregular schedule, end pouches are sometines prepared
on a few hours notice,

4) Cosmmmications. The inc:mbent should have conplete

[MEMORANDUM IN LIEU OF FITNESS REPORT

"SUBJECT: Ann L. GOODPASTURE oo oy
H 18 October 1970 ~ 31 October 1971 7 : ete

i

To the immense regret of. this writer Ann Goodpasture..

is retiring very soon. It would be silly to rate her ‘ e
competitively against any of her colleagues, male or female, «
young or merely well-preserved, Concerning her fitness be

it recorded that she is-very fit indeed to perform any of
the tasks listed as her current ones or almost any othe

I can think of -at alinost any grade, I Venture to-rate her
over-all performance, thirty years of it, as OUTSTANDING,
Annis one of the tough warp-threads on which this organiza- .
tion is woven, and when she retires the fabric of this
organization will be weakened,

COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL:

Miss Goodpasture is indeed a fine officer who consistently
turns in a Strong performance when she,is not doing an out-
Standing job. She is an.excellent office and project manager
iwho is cost conscious and she is a careful thorough instructor
and briefer. Her retirement will leave a great gap in CI/OPS
and, as Mr. Johnson has said, in the organization. I hope
she gets the official Agency recognition she deserves for
the many years she has made substantive contribution to the

MEMORANDUM IN LIEU OF FITNESS REPORT:

, SUBJECT: ‘Ann L.'GOGRPASTURE ~~ Sek

8 October 1970 + 31 October 1971

To the immense regret ‘of this writer Ann Goodpasture
is retiring very soon. It would be silly to rate

’ ‘competitively against any of her colleagues, male or female,

young or merely well-preserved. ‘Concerning her fitness he

it recorded that she is very fit indeed.to perform any of

the tasks listed as her current ones or.almost any. others
I'can think of at ‘almost any grade. I venture. to rate her
over-all performance, thirty years of it, as OUTSTANDING.

Ann is one of the -tough warp:threads on.which this orgariza- ~
tion is woven, and-when she retires the'fabric of this
organization will be weakened.

dive bd lurr,

nL, Goodpasture

COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL:

Miss Goodpasture is indeed a fine officer who consistently

turns’ in a Strong performance when she is not doing an out-
standing job. She is an excellent office and project manager
who is cost conscious and she is a careful thorough instructor
and briefer. Her retirement will leave a great gap in CI/OPS
and, as Mr. Johnson has: said, in the organization. I hope
she gets the official Agency recognition she deserves for

the many years she has made: substantive contribution to the
