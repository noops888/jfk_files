1. Chief, KUSODA, has sovised, In response to jour query contained

in Reference A, that "at this late date Subject has no recourse to over-

tura ODACID's ruling that he lost his PBPRIME cItizenship by his accept-

lag employment in the PERUMEN Governmeut. In protect the PBPRIME

citizenship of an individual who engages

in activities which would

normally expatriate himself requires prior agreement between KUBARX and

ODACID. Thia was not done in Subject's case. Then, too, Subject, by

his application for and acceptance of ?u immigration visa to enter

PBPRIME as & permment resident allen is in eifect an adulasion by hin

of loss of his previous PBPRIME citizenchip".

2. The above opinion reiterates that expressed in a previous review

of this case, see reference 3, which was the basis for Subject's applying

for his lumigration visa.

3. While ve regret any past alaunderstandings on the part of

Subject end, in particular, my slainterpretations which say have been

presented to hin by his various KUBARI contacte, ve ask that JWAvE

Infora Subject that KUBARK cannot non intercede on his bebalf for

restoration of citizenship.
