“ACTION REQUIELO- REFERENCES.

REFS: A.UFGA 16973, 24 July 1964
B.UFGS 1018, 6 Feb. 1962

1. Chief, KUSODA, has advised, in response to ysur query contained]
in Reference A, that “at this late date Subject has vo recourse to over-|
turn ODACID's ruling that he lost his PBPRIME citizenship by his accept-
dag employment in the PRRUMEN Government. Tr protect the PBPRIME
citizenship of an individual who engages in activities which would.
normally expatriate himself requires prior agreement between KUBARK and
ODACID. This was not done in Subject's case. Then, too, Subject, by
his application for and acceptance of 21 inmigration visa to enter
PBPRIME as a permanent resident alien is in effect an admission by him
of loss of his previous PBPRIME citizenchip".

2. The above opinion reiterates that expressed in a previous revi:
of this case, see reference BS, which was the basis for Subject's apply
for his immigration visa.

3. While we regret any past misunderstandings on the part of
Subject and, in particular, any misinterpretations which may have been
presented to him by his various KUBARK contacts, we ask that JMJAVE
iufors Subject that KUBARK cannot now intercede on bis behalf for
restoration of citizenship.
