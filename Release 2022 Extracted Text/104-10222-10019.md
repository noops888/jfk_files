In the perfod April to December 1964,° Subject was the Chicl of
JMWAVE’s Paramilitary Branch, In this capacity he way ghapeed with
the responsibility of mounting successful paramilita SORE ons into
a denied area, Subject met-his responsibilities in an exemplary
manner and his Branch did mount successful operations into PBRUNEN

in which intelligence was collected, resistance nuclei were establised
dn the rural areas of PBRUMEN, and “in- and exfiltration routes were
developed whereby supplies and men could be moved: in and out of
PDORUNEN, In addition, his Branch maintained a UDT and a Commando

unit in a high state of combat rendiness, The UDT and Commando units
were not used opexationally in their specialties because of policy-
prohibitions against committing them against the PGRUNEN target: .
however, they were available to meet contingency situations, Subject's
performance a8 a Branch Chief was characterized by drive, dedication,
reliability, imagination, and the use of sound first-cchelon manage=
ment techniques. Subject is realistic and effective in delegating
authority and responsibility to his subordinates. Subject has the
ability to weld into a cohesive unit a diverse group of men who av
Staff agents, Career Agents, Contract Employees, and military person-
nel on detail to KUBARK, This quality of leadership developed sound
principles of team work in the PM Branch and made it easy for the

Branch to coordinate its activities ww: the programs of the other
Branches in a Station that has over employees and is engaged in

Subject is a hard working, dedicated officer who has an unusual
amount of drive. Subject isa distinct asset to the Station. In the
period covered by ‘this Fitness Report, Subject has worked in a perseverin,
manner toward the goal of making the Station's PM operations resporbive ti
the realities of a target area which moved in twelve months ie frm a

area Climate. Subject has had to accomplish his PM missip:
Adverse circumstances of having to do a current job in regponsg,to s$rong
pressures for immediate production while simultaneously oes up
operational backlog which was inherited from predecessor ojests. %
Additionally Subject had to project his PM plans into the Zuturg@ agai$st
a predictable operational climate ‘in which only the most rigid licdtio}
of sound PM techniques would enable tho Station to continue ‘opeietions
against the target with either PM infiltration teams or commando raider
units, Subject accomplished theso multiple tasks despite the reluctance
of the agent material from the target area to accept the rigid discipline}

and dedication which was required.

Subject: was able to accomplish his PM mission by the use of sound
operational concepts and principles, the delegation of authority, and
the proper use of management techniques. Subject has an appreciation
for intelligence and has harnessed his-PM assets to provide valuable
bread and butter type covoraye on tho rural areas of the target.

Although designated us Chief of Operations, WAVE, during the entire
period that Mr has been under my supervision he has been,
occupied with a highly sensitive special operation controlled by :
Hqs, and has not been able to oxccute his normal duties. I have
been able to closely observe his work, and can more than attest to
tremendous drive and energy and this ‘all-around professional capa=
bility, attested to 1n previous fitness reports. Mr. wt
truly exceptional operations officer and ig best utilized in that
role, rather than in an administrative or supervisory capacity,
although his own administrative responsibilities are always well
handled. Perhaps his groatest contribution to the Station during
the reporting period has boon his vast background and knowledge
of the complex PBRUMEN picture which he cheerfully and unstintingly
makes available to all Station officers, many of whom are without

MEMORANDUM FOR: Secretary, Agent Panel

SUBJECT + Sta EMT - Promotion
nerake, bank FS,

a sit has been in the vortex of Cuban

field operations for the past four and one-half years and

has developed into a senior operations officer with out.

Standing abilities, experience and professional stature.

2. During the past two major operational efforts
against Cuba he has proven himself to be a superior agent
handler with ready access to members of the exile community
and ability to start and run operations which produced
valuable intelligence. His background knowledge of the
area has been invaluablo to the JMWAVE Station operators and
his tireless efforts and willingness to devote long hours to
his work have set an example which others have been compelled

to follow,

3. Regardless of @@@89s time in grade he is of that
senior officer caliber fully deserving of and ready to assume
the responsibilities of tho next higher grade, #8E2S has
displayed outstanding performance in FI, CI and PM operat ions
and has the potential to fill a wide variety of senior

operational assignments.

4, In view of the foregoing I strongly recommend the
promotion of 8205 from GS-14 to GS-15, I have discussed
this action with the Chief of Station, JNWAVE, and he
endorses my view that fully merits advancement to the
next higher grade at this time. ,

1. For the information of Headquarters and for G33

3 contribution to the JMATE project. Beginning with
his arrival in the WAVE area in October 1960, @guewinitiated
an operational program directed to the establishment of a
Cuban intelligence service, both for positive collection of
intelligence and to establish protective security on JMATE
operations, In a remarkably short time ,«tif@ziwas able to
recruit, train, and organize such a service which has
effectively responded to intelligence and counter intelli-~
gence operational tasks, and has shown willingness and
ability to ably perform a number of support functions for
other types of substantive operations, principally para-
military. In addition, the Cuban service wnscrs ee
organized ig likely to be the nucleus of a post- ae
Cuban Government service which will serve KUBARK ends, not
enly on the basis of liaisen, but by means of penetrations
of this service already established.
2. In the swift accomplishment of so many objectives,

e2eoPxas shown executive ability, diplomacy, energy and

“uaagination commensurate with a grade level well in excess
