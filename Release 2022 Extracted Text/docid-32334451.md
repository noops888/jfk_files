RC 62-7797

On December 10, 1965, RALTHBY R, HUSTED (Conceal
Identity) who was then residing and working in "Hinutemen”
headquarters, 408 South Pine, Norborne, Missouri, and
who at that time was voluntarily furnishing the Kansas City
Office with information concerning the "MM" organization;
furnished approximately 400 4 X 6 index cards from trash
being discarded at "MM" headquarters.

HUSTED believes these cards were discarded as
@ result of headquarters workers consolidating several
duplicate sets of cards into one file. He advised he
had been told by others at headquarters that at least
four different individuals have custody of various
amounts of these cards, which they keep in their places of-
residence. He further advised these 4 X 6 cards are kept
in file card boxes and are referred to by ROBERT B.
DePUGH, his wife, and others at "MM" headquarters as
membership records.

HUSTED stated that some of the cards show
dates of dues payments or contributions, with many of
them showing no payment date subsequent to 1963 or
1964. According to HUSTED, the lack of a current date
should not be construed as an indication of failure to
pay dues or lack of interest in the "MM" on the part of
the member, inasmuch as he had observed ROBERT DePUGH
and WALTER PATRICK PEYSON, who also works in "HH"
headquarters, on many occasions open mail, take out
any money contained in the letters and thereafter destroy
the letters without making any record of amounts received
orfrom whom. At other times he had observed that
Q@ young woman named MARY (LNU) (believed by the Kansas
City Office to be MARY TOLLERTON) appeared to be keeping
a record of some of the money received in a ledger book,
however, he advised that upon carefully inspecting this
ledger, he was of the opinion that she was attempting
to keep records in some sort of code. No amounts were
indicated in this ledger. .

It is noted that DePUGH has repeatedly admonished

contributors to send in their dues or contributions in
cash rather than by checks which could be traced.
