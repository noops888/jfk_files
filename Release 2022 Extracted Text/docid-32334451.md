КС 82-7797

On December 10, 1965, RAITHBY R. HUSTED (Conceal

Identity) who was then residing and norking in "Minuteren"

headquarters, 408 South Pine, Norborne, Missourl, and

who at that time as voluntarily furnishing the Kansas City

Office with information concerning the "Mi" organization;

furnished approximatoly 400 4 X 8 Index cards IrON trash

being discarded at "HM" headquarters.

HUSTED believes these cards vere discardod as

a result of headquarters workers consolidating several

duplicate sots of cards into one file. Ho advised he

had been told by others at headquarters that at least

four different indiuiduals have custody of various

anounts of these cards, which they keep in their places of

residence. He further

advised these 4 X 6 cards are kept

in file card boxes and are referred to by ROBERT B.

DePUGH, his wife,

and others at "IN" headquarters as

nenbership records.

HUSTED stated that some of the cards show

dates of dues payments or contributions, with many of

then showing no paynent date subsequent to 1963 or

According to HUSTED, the lack of a current date

an indication of failure to

pay dues or lack of interest in the "HM" on the part of

the member, inasnuch as he had observed ROBERT DePUGH

and WALTER

PATRICK PBYSON, Who also works in "MH"

headquarters, on many occasions open mall, take out

any noney contained in the letters and thereafter destroy

the letters without making any record of amounts received

or fron whom.

At other times he had observed that

& joung wOman named MARY (LNU) (believed by the kansas

City Office to be MARY TOLLERTON) appeared to be keeping

a rocord of some of the money received in a ledger book,

however; he advised that upon carefully inspecting this

lodger, he was of the opinion that she was atteupting

ловка лого

to keep recorda in some sort of code. No amounts were

indicated in this ledger.

It is noted that DePUGH has repeatedly admonished

contributors to send in their dues or contributiona 1n

cash rather than by checks which could be traced.
