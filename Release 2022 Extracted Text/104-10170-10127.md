Sergio Viconte ARCACHA Smith (Enclosure 2 of reference memorandum)

DPOB: 22 January 1923, Cuba 7 7

1. .“Tracesen.ARCACHA do riot reflect the date he first
arrived -in'tho-U.S.- However, he becamo the ‘FRENTE REVOLU~
CLONAREO.DEMOCRATICO: (FRD). delegate in Now. Orleans prior
to tho Bay ‘of Pigs invasion and coiitinucd in that position
until the -FRD ceased to function. The FRD was the predecessor
Of the CUBAN: REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL, and was organized and
. ¢ +. Supported by the Agency The organization was used as a +
. front for recruitment: of Brigado 2506 for the invasion. .
During this period ARCACHA reported to the FRD headquarters
in Miami. ‘through ‘a post-office box in Coral Gables, and
reportedly maintained extensive relations with the New
Orleans FBI and’ Immigration offices, Two of his regular
FBI contacts were a Mr, De Bruce and the deceased Guy

Banistor, ‘

2, ARCACIIA was also one of the promoters of the
FRIENDS OF DEMOCRATIC CUBA, INC (FDC) which was incorporated
in New Orleans:.on 6 January 1961. This organization was
ostensibly created by several New Orloans: business and
political figures, including the deceased former FBI agent,
Guy Banister, to.collect money to aid Cubans in their :
fight against Communism, According to the articles of
incorporation, these donations would also be used to support
the FRD and the. funds were to be channeled through ARCACHA,
less a percentage to be retained by. the FDC. An investi-
gation conducted by a reliable Miami Station asset concluded
that the FDC. was organized strictly for the personal gain
of the promoters with. the approval and collaboration of
ARCACHA. ‘The investigation produced no evidence that any oe
individual donations. were ever solicited or received and .
recommended that the funds of the ‘Stevedores Union and the
books of the.New-Orleans Exporters Company be investigated
for evidence of personal gain and Possible evidence of
federal tax evasion, since both the president of the New
Orleans Exporters Company, Gerard F, Tunague, and the Chief
of New Orleans Stevedores Union, Alfred Chittenden, were
officials of the FDC, Approximately one month after the
FDC was created, strong criticism from some prominent Cubans
put the organization: out of business.

3. Information inan immigration card reflects that
ARCACHA travelled to Caracas, Venezuela at an unspecified
date. His address in, Venezuela was HOTEL TIUNA, Caracas,

and his US addréss was listed as 4523 Duplesses Street,
New Orleans. Passport No, 00433.

Emilio SANTANA (paragraph 7 C of reference memorandum)

DPOB: 7 Sept 1935, Cardenas, Matanzas, Cuba
(also reported 7 Sept'1936 and 7 Sept 1937

1. Subject is probably identifiable with” Emilio SANTANA
Galindo, who was.recruited by JMWAVE- in December 1960. as a
guide for an infiltration team, SANTANA was paid a monthly.
salary, under provisions of his MOC until he was terminated
on 15 October 1963: when the ratline developed by the team

‘became inoperable due to occupation of the target area’ by
“Soviet technicians, Another compelling reason for SANTANA‘S

termination stemmed: from his untruthful reporting concerning
certain aspects of the team operations,

2, In an attempt to establish positive identification,
JNWAVE obtained a réport from the Dade County (Miami)
Sheriff's office that an Emilio SANTANA (no matronymic)
born 6 July 1936 in.Cuba, was. declared a. fugitive from
Louisiana on a federal warrant 22 December 1965, FBI Sheet
132287F, based on two counts of burglery in Louisiana,

He. was arrested and booked by the Dade County Sheriff's
office on 2 February’ 1966 and was presumably sent back to
Louisiana. At the time of his arrest SANTANA gave his
address as 851 SW 4th Street, Miami, which is the same
address shown on an.old immigration’ frm when he was

living in Miami, Headquarters files indicate SANTANA .is
separated from his wife who apparently still resides at

the old Miami. address. Since SANTANA's date of birth. varies .

. 0n various documents in his 201 file, the variation in birth

date on his arrest.sheet is not conclusive: The fact he

did give his former address to the arresting officers
indicates he is Emilio SANTANA Galindo, A. 1962 immigration.
form includes a photograph which could be obtained: from
JMWAVE for identification purposes if this becomes necessary.

3, Although JNWAVE has had no contact with SANTANA
since his termination, there is a-note in Station files
dated 23 June 19€4 that SANTANA used the Agency as his
employer on an auto credit application,

FRENTE REVOLUCIONARTO DEMOCRATICO (FRD)
(CUBAN DEMOCRATIC REVOLUTIONARY | FRONT)

1. Tho FRD was created with Agency assistance,
guidance and financial support in May 1960 and consisted
of several anti-CASTRO groups, The FRD was formed asa
political action, ‘propaganda and military unit. Initial
actions consisted of extensive radio and printed propaganda,
demonstrations, and trips throughout the Hemisphere to gain
support for the fight against CASTRO, The FRD also functioned
as the front organization for recruiting the members of
the Bay of Pigs invasion force and carried out a missive
program of social assistance to Brigado 2506 meabers in
training camps and their families. Although. the FRD head-
quarters were based in Mia 4, delegates were assigned to
other arcas which included New Orleans, Louisiana, Tampa,
Florida, and Moxico City, to gather intelligenco and
coordinate Cuban refugee activities,

2: In late 1960 or carly 1961 the CUBAN REVOLUTIONARY
COUNCIL (CRC) was formed to coordinate and dircct FRD
activities and this group was headed by Agency and White
House sponsored Dr. Jose MIRO Cardona, assisted by Manuel
ARTIME and Dr, Antonio VARONA. Both the FRD and the CRC
continued to function until October 1961.when the FRD was
completely absorbed by the CRC in order to avoid the confusion
resulting from duplication of personnel, activities and
funding. The CRC also had direct access to President
Kennedy and top Mhite House aides, Because of the magnitude
of the FRD and CRC operations and the Agency participation
in the activities and funding of the groups, a large number
of JMWAVE and Headquarters were directly involved with both
FRD and CRC personnel.
