MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

OSS-495-74
13 March 1974

SUBJECT: Mr. Stephen Van Cleave

1. On 27 and 28 February cai Peere received from Bill
Cantrell, OPS/ITG, an ") WH/4/AR, concerning
00-A(S)-322/03435-74... Cantrell wanted to be sure FBI had
information and uanted to advise DCD that there was
a file on subject. and DCD should be aware of some of his
background. Evan Ames stopped in to see on his
next visit to headquarters and received a fill-in on subject! s
background. %

2. Subsequently a call was received from Charlotte in
c/w Division office (x-7350). It was imperative to determine
the exact date of contact with Van Cleave as C/WH, thru
Legislative Counsel, had advised Congress on 7 January 1974
that the Agency had no contact with Van Cleave. Atlanta and
Miami were contacted and date of first contact was set at 25
January 1974. Both offices were requested to provide a record
of contact with Van Geave. Atlanta had several hours of tape
(from first and second meeting) which Pangburn would have transcribed
and forwarded for the record. Called John Peterson later and
advised that WH has asked that tapes also be forwarded to
headquarters for retention.

3. We.were advised that the Congressional inquiry on
Van Cleave resulted from a remark overheard at a cocktail
party - that Van Cleave. had commented that he was working with
CIA under cover. Van Cleave was scheduled as potential witness
of House Internal Security Committee so House had inquired é
as to whether his appearance would embarrass the Agency. As
noted, response on 7 January was that Agency had no contact with
Van Cleave.
