Streets, N.W., Washington, D.C,, in a large residence and thet
NESLINE, although ho had an interest iu the operation, was
not participating in the game as yet. Informant stated that
SOURINE, METCHELL end ROHANNA were running the game but that
the action was small due to a lack of players.

On 5/1/63, WF 1469-C advised SA BOWARD N.. WILLS
that he had heard that there wag a large dice game recently
atarted at 1915 Biltmore Street, N.W. On 5/3/63, informant
advised SA WILLS that ho had been to 1915 Biltmore Street, N.W.,
the previous evening (5/2/63) and that ROHANNA and TOURINE
were present. ROHANNA indicated that there was net to be a
dice game on that evening because of a lack of playing customers.

HOHANNA veferred to TOURING as “bows”, Informant advised that
the following individuals were present at the establishment;
JOSEPH GORDON, aka SROOKLYN; ERIC EDMONSTON, aka TOM MIX; and
two or three other individuale that he only knew by first name,
"LARRY", "BILL" and "SMITYY".

: WF 1469-€ described the residence at 1915 Biltmore

On 5/7/63, STEVE X¥DAS, PCI, advised SA CARLTON
GIOVANNETTI thet he had been to 1915 Biltmore Street, N.W.,
on the night of Saturday, 5/4/63, and that there was a fairly
large dice game held that night. PCI said that the dice gane
was held in a large room on the second floor and that the
following individuais participated: TOURINE; MITCHELL;
REMONSTON, JIMMY LUBIN and others whom ‘he could not identify.

On 5/6/63, Doputy Chief ROY BE, BLICK, Metropolitan
Police Departwent (MPD), advised SA ROBERT L, SHACKELFORD
that he had received inforaation that there was a gambling
operation located at 1915 Biltomore Street, N.W. According
to Chief BLICK he sent two Morale Division personzel (not
aumed) to the establishment Saturday evening, 5/4/63, at
approximately 10:45 p.m. Chief BLICK advised that the
establishment was a large three story structure and that the
interior was lavishly furnished. According to Chief BLICK
there was no gambling activity during the period that the
MPD representatives were there and he advised that JOSEPH
GORDON and "BILIS" MITCHELL were the only ones present.

in connection with information furnished by Chief
BLICK it is Likely that the MPD officers were at 1915 Biltmore
Strest prior to the time PCE KXYDAS participated im the dice
he game the same night.

in view of the above developments it appears that

the dice game at Ripley, Maryland, bas been abandoned for
the present. Inasmuch as the operation at 1915 Biltsore
Strest involves substantially the same individuals as wore
involved in the Ripley, Haryland, operation, it is likely
that thé Site for the game bas been moved. Accordingly it
is recommended that the office of origin be changed from
Baltinore to WFO since it appears that the operation hae been

- moved from Ripley, Maryland, to the District of Columbia.
Extra copies are provided for the Buresu for notification to
Baltimore and WFO of the changes He

Information copies of instant communication are
being directed to all offices whe have an interest in the
subjects involved. ‘
