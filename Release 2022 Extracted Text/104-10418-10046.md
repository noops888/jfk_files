WERE DATED JUL 7%, ONE HAVING BEEN SIGNED BY OLTMANS AND THE

OTHER TKO BY DEWT SUKARNO, OLTMANS' LETTER WAS AN EXPRESSION

OF INTEREST IN ay SENATE INVESTIGATIONS AND PARTICULARLY IN ANY
ASPECT REGARDING INDUNESTA, OLTMANS CLAIMED TO HAVE KNOWN SUKARNO
QUITE WELL» AND SAIG THAT HE HAD HAD SEVERAL DISCUSSIONS WITH SUKARNO
ON THE SUBJECT CF THE ACTIVITIES OF THE CIA AND HOW THE CIA WAS
TRYING TO OUST SUKARNG+ DEWI SUKARNO'S TWO LETTERS HERE REQUESTS
FOR JNFGRMATIGN ON THE RESULTS UF THE SENATE INVESTIGATION AND

HOPED THAT THE INOUIRIES WOULD SERVE TO CLEAR HER HUSBAND'S NAME.

3. SINCE THe LETTERS WERE ACTUALLY WRITTEN TO SENATOR FRANK
CHURCH AS HEAL OF TRE SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE, @acuad FOUND IT
INTERESTING THAT AGEE WOULD BE ABLE TO OBTAIN COPIES OF LETTERS
WRITTEN TO A UsSs SENATOR IN HIS OFFICIAL CAPACITY AS HEAD OF SUCH
A COMMITTEE. Gaslad WONDERED JF SOMEONE ON THE SENATE COMMITTEE HAD
SENT THE LETTERS TO AGEEs BUT WE FEEL IT POSSIBLE THAT OLTMANS/
SUKARNG GAVE COPIES GF THEIR LETTERS TO PEOPLE IN PARIS WHO GOT
THEM TO AGEEr

4, REQUEST ADDEES TRACES OLTMANS WITH INDICATION OF WHAT MAY
BE PASSED Gacuhe)
