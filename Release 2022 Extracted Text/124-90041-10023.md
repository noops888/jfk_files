On about 25 August 1959 Manuel BLANCO Navarro, in Miani,wrote a letter to one of

his followers in cubao. Feeloped with the latter were two mossages which bie

asked be forwarded to

(Sic). One of the messages reads as follows:

"Dear Brother:

I am writing these lines to accompany a letter from my friend

Dr. Rodriguez Couceiro, in whose house I am staying since I found

out that they have arrested Leonel and that I cannot return there.

As you will see in the letter, I am sending you a series of instruc

tions to see if we can maintain the group that is presently without

any leaders.

Just as you have probably read in the newspapers, they

have caught all the leaders in the roundup. This doesn't mean any-

thing more than that we shall he delayed until we are reorganized

again. Only about 100 were arrested, and the group mmbered about

3,000.

As he (my friend) informs you, I do not believe that you ought

to visit Reinaldo BLANCO Navarro in La Cabaña prison, You should

send someone in whom you bave confidence. In the new contacts that you

made do not use your own name. Use an alias..

do these things, but I want to warn you to be careful and use other

persons to make your contacts. Don't do it personally..

The principal

objective is to is able to maintain yourself as the leader of the

movement st least until you select chiefs if your work prevents you

from leading in Habana.

We have made contact here with a large group which was not caught

and which is also organized from Autentico people.

Miami 21 August 1959

Dear friend:

As I suppose

you already know, because of the treason of Willian

Morgan 12and ClOtGUTTURREZ Meneyel?, the leaders of the Organizatior

have been arrested, and it is most necessary that our people be

reorganized so that the movement is not lost. The only person who is

able to do so is you I know that the responsibility is very greate

but I also know your abilities, and we are sure that you will be able

to do the job.

As a first objoctive, it is necessary to establish

contact with

Captain Reinaldo BLANCO Navarro. He is the chief of our organization

and will continue to be.

He is in prison in La Cabaña, according to

our information, but is allowed to receive visitors.. He knows you,

since you met each other in his office. You can introduce yourself as

the brother of

He will give you names of persons and instruc

tions to follow.

However, it is very important that, while he remains

a prisoner, you set up a courier so that you don't have to make sub

sequent visits. This would be dangerous in the extreme.

With respect to the rebels, be very careful in making your contacts,
