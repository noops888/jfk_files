INTERVIEW OF DANIEL STANLEY WATSON:

On June 4, 1978, House Select Conmittee on Assassinations staffers
Gary Cornwell, Dan Hardway, Edwin J. Lopez and Harold Leap met with
Mr. Daniel Stanley Watson, aka Bernard G. Edgebrook, at his home in
Cuernavaca, Mexico. Mr. Watson was born on November 16, 1917. His
Social Security number is 098-32-0443. Mr. Watson graduated from Knox
College in Illinois and did his graduate work at Georgetown University
in Washington, D.C. He was in the Army from 1941 to 1949, joined the
Central Intelligence Agency in 1949 and worked with them until he
retired in 1973. His assignments while with the Agency were as follows:
Rome 1949 to 1950, Germany 1951-1952, Japan 1953-1955, Pakistan 1957-
1962, New York (United Nations) 1963-1964, Mexico 1965-1967 as Chief
of Covert Action, and 1967-1969 as Deputy Chief of Station, Saigon
1969-1971, and, finally, United States (Headquarters) 1971-1973.

Mr. Watson stated that sometime between 1965 and 1966 while he
was stationed in Mexico City he requested Lee Oswald's personality file.
When it was brought to him it contained only one or two photographs and
intercept transcripts. Mr. Watson stated that the file was very thin
and that the photo(s) was a 3/4 shot from behind--"basically an ear
and back shot". He did not think there was anyone else in the picture
and thoght that it was of Oswald. He could not recall what was on the
transcripts but does remember reading them. When asked why he had orig-
inally requested the file he stated that he could not recall. When the
House Select Comnittee staffers asked Mr. Watson if it would surprise
him if we told him that Oswald's personality file from Mexico was seven
volumes, he said yes. The staffers asked him if Scott would destroy

files, pictures or would keep highly sensitive material in a special

place. Mr. Watson answered that it would not surprise him if Win

Scott had destroyed some files and pictures, He also stated that Scott
kept highly sensitive material which he did not want in the system in

a personal safe in his office. Mr. Watson stated that when Win Scott
retired he took the contents of the personal safe with him and stored
them in a safe in his home. When asked if the Oswald p-file he saw
had-a note from Winston Scott that stated that nothing should be removed
as he was highly interested in it, Watson stated that it did not. He
said that a note like that on a file would draw attention to it. "Every
one would want to read it." He said that he did not think it likely
that Scott would put such a note in a file that was sensitive.

Stanley Watson stated that before Win Scott had been buried, James
Angleton flew to Mexico and emptied the personal safe in Scott's bedroom.
Mr. Watson said that he knew this from Scott's wife, Janet. When asked
if Angleton and Scott were close friends, Watson said, "they were".
Watson stated that he thought the CIA Mexico City Station had given
all the material in their possession to the Warren Commission but that
he also knew that Win Scott was capable of "phoneying a photo if asked
to produce one. I never believed Win Scott the first time he told me
something." Watson also remembers Richard Helms congratualating Win
Scott for his excellent job on the Oswald trip to Mexico because "the
Agency had not looked all that bad."

Regarding Charles Thomas, Watson said, "He was rock solid; you can
rely on anything he said. He was sharp and perceptive. In fact I found
him to be way ahead of me many times." Watson said that he was responsible
for keeping Charles Thomas next to Elena Garro de Paz. Watson said

that Charles Thomas was skeptical of Elena's story at first. He does

remember if he later believed her but said that if he did then there must
have been someting to her story.

Regarding Elena Garro de Paz, Watson stated that she was a neurotic
genius.. "All the key people did not give her much credence." He stated
that Elena was not an intelligence agent. His last contact with Elena
Garro de Paz was in 1968. He thinks she left town around that time.
Watson stated that he thinks she left under "hurried" circumstances.

He also recalled that when Thomas left he (Watson) dropped all contact
with Elena. Finally, Watson stated that if the Company had helped Elena
depart he would not have necessarily known about it.

Watson stated that Cynthia Thomas was a troublemaker but that she
aided Charles and himself by introducing them to the intellectual crowd.

He apologized for not knowing more but stated that there was much
compartmentation in the Agency.

When asked if he had anything more to add to what he had told us,
he stated that it bothered him that the Agency had destroyed many P~files
when Win Scott retired.

Mr. Watson requested that we use his true name in any writeups.

The. omnibus release letter was explained to Mr. Watson before the
interview started. He stated that he believed us and did not have to
see the letter. He was shown the letter at the end of the interview and
was asked if he wanted a copy for his. records. He stated that he had
read it and understood it and had been truthful in what he had told us
and that he did not want ro copy of the letter lying around the house for

the maid to read.
