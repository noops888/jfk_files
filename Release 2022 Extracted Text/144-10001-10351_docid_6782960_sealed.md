The incident of the killing of the,United States President
KENNEDY caused great indignation and gfief in Finland. A sort
of period of national meurning wes established in Helsinki with
flags lowered to half-mast everywhere. Cn the 25th cf the
month in the city of {3 gr G/M), ay ‘Mess was arranged in which the
President cf the Republic will, aiso participate, All means of
publicaticn are discussing the exceptional personality of KENNEDY
and his service to humanity and’ peace,

The press, taking up the perscnality cf L. JOHNSON whe
ascended to the presidency dinexpectedly, wrote that: the afore-
mentioned in his yourh was.” a protégé of ROCSEVELT and went to
Australia aod New Zealand’ as his special representative during
the war; that he was one of those who defended the [1 gr U] at

especiaily in internal politics and in the party, his
experience in the matter of foreign policy expanded: by his trips

As was submitted during his visit to Helsinki several months
ago, the impression which he left as a statesman f1 gr Gj] is
negative. °. qi

Some of*the opinions expressed in official and political
circles are a& follews: the incident of the death of the presi-
dent is of a nature to alter conditions of domestic policy;
in spite of the.certainty cf KENNEDY'’s Democratic Party candidacy
in the future elections, now the party will be the scene of a
great dispute; héwever, from the struggle between the [1 gr U]
and liberal wings’pf the [1 gr G] party, it can sbe expected that
NIXON will be the wictor.

The primary poikt which these circles [1 gx U} upon is
that the incident of the sudden withdrawai fron the scene cf
KENNEDY whose perscna wes forcefully felt gn east-west
(B val relations) wt taking a faverablie! direction despite
the [1 gr G} deviations ‘recently, {L ax G! destructive reactions
on these relations. ae
