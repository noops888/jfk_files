month in the city of 13 gr G/Ml, a.Mass was arranged in which the

As was submitted during his visit to Helsinki several months

ago, the impression which he

left as a statesman f1 gr G] is.

negative.

Some of the opinions expressed in official and political

circles are as follows: the incident of the death of the presi-

dent is of a nature to alter conditions of domestic policy;

in spite of the, certainty of KENNEDY's Democratic Party candidacy

in the future elections, now the party will be the scene of a

great dispute; however, frem the struggle between the (1 grU]

and liberal wings of the [1 gr G] party, it can'be expected that

NIXON will be the victor.

The primary poiht which these circles (1 gr U] upon is

that the incident of the sudden withdrawal from the scene of

KENNEDY whose perscnality was forcefully felt in east-west

(B val relations) which, are taking a favorable, direction despite

the [1 gr G] deviations racently, [1 g= G; destructive reactions

on these relations.
