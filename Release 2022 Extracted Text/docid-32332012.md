12 million dollars worth of Canadian Government Bonds, Jewelry

and Cash from a burglary of the Brockville Trust and Savings

Company, Brockville, Ontario, Canada, on 5/3-4/58.

Canadian

bonds stolen from the Brockville Bank had been cashed throughout

North America and in Europe.

MANNARINO was apprehended on the basis of a bench warrant

issued by the U. S. District Court, Chicago, Illinois, on

6/30/59, following

Federal

Grand Jury In Chicago the same day charging MANNARINO

and NORMAN ROTHMAN with aiding and abetting WILLIAM W.

RABIN of Chicago in the use of a wire or radio communication

no to be

for the purpose of defrauding a swiss bank, through the

pledging of $140,500 worth of the stolen 'Canadian Government

Bonds.

MANNARINO and ROTHMAN were also charged in the

indictment with alding and abetting RABIN in the concealment

of $9,000 worth of the stolen bonds which were transported

from Brockville, Ontario, Canada, to Chicago, Illinois, during

January-February, 1959.

GUISEPPE COTRONI, deseribed by one of the eo-conspirators,

and one of

his lieutenants, RENE ROBERT, were also named in the secret

Indictment returned by the Chicago Federal Grand Jury.

dollars.

The RCMP have advised that the arrests

culminated an extensive investigation with the cooperation

WILLIAM RABIN was also arrested by Bureau Agents in Miami,

Florida, with ROTHMAN on 7/2/59, anc. they are now at liberty under

$5,000 bond along with MANNARINO.

RABIN, during previous Interviews with Bureau Agents in the

EZHAYA case, has stated that he

received the bonds pledged

In Switzerland and Chicago from one ALFREDO GARCIA, not

further identified, In return for his services andanticipated

purchase of weapons for FIDEL CASTRO. On the basis of

investigation in the EZHAYA case, It appears that the

bonds were

turned over to the MANNARINe combination in Montreal,

Canada, in late August, 1958, by RENE ROBERT.

It has been

determined from one of

the co-conspirators that sometime in

1957, MANNARINO, ROTHMAN and their confederates received certain

gambling rights in Cuba from the BATISTA Government and

reportedly moved 2,000 slot machines into the Havana area.

During the ensuing period, up to the summer of 1958, the slots

became less and less profitable due to larceny from

the machines

and also because of the increasing charges placed upon the

operation of the machines by the BATISTA Government.

Accordingly,

MANNARINO began watching the activities of FIDEL CASTRO and

his 26 July Movement with a view toward gaining favor with

him in the event the Rebellion was successful.

The MANNARINO

combine desired to secure a large sum of money which would

- be used to purchase a bank in Europe and the eventual purchase

of arms and ammunition for the Cuban Rebellion.

It is

Indicated that these hoodlums considered the possibility that

CASTRO might be defeated.

Consequently, they laid plans

simultaneously for furnishing military aid and assistance to

the BATISTA forces.

Apparently, during 195T, a plan was

formulated to transfer 3 million dollars to a bank in Europe

for the purchase of arms.

The transfer was to be handled

by WILLIAM W. RABIN, a Chicago, Illinois, business consultant

and fomer front for MANNARINO in an unsuccessful venture into

the jukebox manufacturing business in Chicago during 1947.

As plans further developed, RABIN reportedly planned to transfer

10 million dollars to a European bank in exchange for a fee of

$250,000.

Dr. JAMES THORNTON MCCLOWRY, MD,

a PCI of the Pittsburgh

office, on 7/2/59, advised

SA THOMAS G. FORSYTH, III, that

he had examined SAM MANNARIN@'S medical records

on file at the

Mercy Hospital in Pittsburgh. It is recalled that MANNARINO

-B-

PG 52-1687

underwent surgery at Mercy Hospital during the summer of

1958, for the removal of an alleged cyst from his intestinal

tract.

Dr. McCLOWRY pointed out that the medical record

he examined on MANNARINO showed only that an exploratory

operation was performed by Dr. GEORGE REGIS MILLER, Chief

Surgeon at Mercy Hospital, and that the medical report while

describing the surgieal techniques invold in some detail,

made no mention whatever of the reason ur the exploratory

operation.

Dr. McCLOWRY deseribed this as somewhat of an

unusual recording since It was obvious that the physician

performing the operation did not want his findings made

a matter of record.

Dr. McCLOWRY went on to say that in

the interest of obtaining a clear picture of MANNARINQ'S

state of health, he was able to discreetly obtain a copy

of another medical record on MANNARINO in the private office

of Chief Surgeon GEORGE REGIS MILLER. According to Dr.

MCCLOWRY, this record discloses that MANNARINO is suffering

from a spreading cancer in his lower abdomen which was

discovered during the operation in the summer of 1958.

The record indicates that MANNARINO is undergoing radiation

and cobalt treatments at Mercy Hospital and Dr. McCLOWRY's

diagnosis is that MANNARINO will probably die sometime within

the next 12 months.

Dr. McCLOWRY, on 7/23/59, advised SAS FORSYTH and DOUCE that

SAM MANNARINO got in touch with him several days ago and

requested that he become his personal physician. Dr. McCLOWRY

said that the introduction to MANNARINO was arranged by the

Reverend NICKOLAI FUSCO, Pastor of the St. Peters Roman

Catholic Church in New Kensington.

Dr. McCLOWRY mentioned

that he had discussed the possible treatment of MANNARINO with

Father FUSCO who appeared to be very concerned that MANNARINO

might have cancer and he wanted Dr. McCLOWRY to become his

physician as soon as possible and conduct necessary examinations

and tests in an effort to confirm his suspicions.

Dr. MeCLOWRY

told Father FUSCO

that he would examine MANNARINO at the first

opportunity.

MAJOR PEDRO LUIS DIZ LANZ

"Time" Magazine, July 13, 1959, Issue, carried an article

concerning the dismissal of Major LANZ as Commander of the Cuban

Air Force because of his outspoken attitude regarding

, the

alleged communist infiltration in the Cuban armed forces.

"Time"

Magazine described Pilot LANZ as one of the authentic

heroes of the Cuban Rebellion who flew weapons from the

United States Into rebel territory.

The article stated that

LANZ was the object of a nation-wide man-hunt in Cuba following

11/2he inter States -Committee

his resignation and since news broadcasts in Pittsburgh on

7/12/59, pointed out that Major LANZ had been granted asylum

in the United States and would appear before the Senate

Internal Security Sub-Committee on 7/13/59, the Pittsburgh

Office requested Bureau authority for Washington Field to

conduct a complete interview.

The Bureau has since authorized an interview with Major

LANZ when he concludes his testimony before the Senate Sub-

Committe and the Committee has no further interest in Major

LANZ.

Previous investigation in this case indicates the possibility

that Major LANZ may be acquainted with JOSEPH MEROLA and

NORMAN ROTHMAN, both of whom are exceptionally familiar with

the Cuban interior in connection with MANNARIN® slot machine

interests in Camaguey and santiago de Cuba.

As a matter of

Information, Camaguey 1s located some 75 miles from CASTRO's

wartime command post in the Sierra Maestra Mountain Range.

BURGLARY OF THE NATIONAL GUARD ARMORY, CANTON, OHIO, 10/14/58

PCI FRANCIS LA CAMERA on 6/25/59, advised SA HOBART C. LOVETT

that his brother, CHARLES LA CAMERA, aka.,

"RED", (also a PCI

of the Pittsburgh Office) and JOHN MOLDOVAN of Farrell,

Pa., told him several months ago that they had been approached

by JOHN and PHIL SCARDINA of Sharon, Pa., to pull the Armory

job in Canton.

PCI further advised

that his brother and MOLDOVAN

refused to accept the score but referred the SCARDINA brothers

to JAMES ZIMMERMAN and WILLIE NAPOLI.

PCI pointed out that

ZIMMERMAN and NAPOLI also refused to accept the job because 1t

involved a Federal violation but added that ZIMMERMAN and NAPOLI

made arrangements for the SCARDINAS to contact SANDY NAPLES of

Youngstown, Ohio.

PCI stated that he

did not know the identity

of those who actually pulled the score at the Armory but he is

positive that SANDY NAPLES hired the men for the job. According to

PCI, CHARLES CARABBIA, brother of RONALD CARABBIA, who was

recently apprehended by the FBI for Unlawful Flight to Avoid

Prosecution for the crime of Burglary, also knows the identity

of the men who stole the weapons from

the Armory. PCI stated

that he has had little contact with NAPLES recently but would

attempt to learn the identity of the men who pulled the Armory

entity or

job.

PCI went on to say that he did not know the person who contacted

the SCARDINA brothers but described him as a comparatively

young man from New Kensington or McKeesport, Pa., who is a

member of the MANNARINe combination and one of the men now

under indictment in Pittsburgh in connection with the Armory

job.

It is noted that VICTOR CARLUCCI, aged 37, the son-in-law of

SAM MANNARINO, Or DANIEL HANNA, aged 32, would most closely

fit Informant's description of the contact man..
