Msg Nr: 501.

It is knawn that the Mexican Foreign Minister was obviously

disturbed by the knowledge of the note sent by the Cuban

Government to the Mexican Government attributing to it partici-

pation in a plot aimed at involving the CASTRO Government in:

the plan for the attack on KENNEDY. Because of this, it is

felt that there may be a change in the well-known Mexican

position toward the Cuban problem.
