Reference t pin=90317;4.,ACL.

1. The Station, after reference incident, felt more strongly
than ever that [¢ really did-not have a complete assessizent of
TICHBORN in the aense of what is his real ideslogical vicupoint.
This Is not ta say that the Station was overly cencerned that
TICHRORN was flirting with the opposition. As a result of the
events described below, the Station-feels it. has.a reasonably

clear idea on these points now.

2. On 1S May, being-a Saturday and two days prior to
TICHEURN. entering a Mexican hospital for a long-delayed and
somewhat apprehensive {on his part) hernia operation, TICHCORN
was In an unusually loquacious mood for a luncheon engagement
with the Statlon case officer. “He sh d little opposition to
three good Manhattans and, for the first time, the Station case
officer felt he was see clearly TICHBGRN "the person" and
not TICHBORN "the lawyer" In other words, there was no protective
veneer involved In the -ratier lona luncheon discussion which
followed, The Issue which brotight forth the entire discussion

(was reaction of the Mexican intellectual to the Dominican Republic
situation, -In the process, TICHBORN brought out very sincerely,
_passtonately, and clearly the following points:

a. When he was a trial lawyer in California for five
years, his real Inclinations were what he termed "leftist".
harbored a number of "reservations" about the way that things
were or were net happening in the U.S. under the U.S..system.
These were private. thoughts and ‘reservations and diu not translate

themselves into action, but nonetht 88 polnts of real concern

to him, Then, he ‘cane to: Mexico for # perfed to cet "thet" novel
and writing off his chest: during. that period, he saw the 2
Mexican system anu sumeot the satin Ame in Systems. At thet
juncture, he became very much awerelof the fact thee it was the
"system" that counted, In spite af ‘whatever Imperfections existed,
and that there "was, and Is, nothing: thot can anywhere nearly
approach the U.S, system". As hy re are a lot
of things wrong,: because of deci asbe ings: who
are fallible and have their oun after, but
there. Is so much good and so many ‘compensations on the plus side
of the system and the way it works, you can afford ta recognize |
the wrongs and work them out within’ the, system". he sald that
this was’ so’ obvious, from abroad that he just wondered why he

ever had worrted about Incident’s and didn't realize that it

was the "system" that mattered, |

be He told shout some of the discussions he had had with
lefeist Mexican intellectuals en these points such as, "Is the

Soviet system capable of producing and ahsorbir pictures
as '0r. Strangelove! or having a: J a ‘Grapes
iting snd.motton

of Wrath’ and run off with all pri
Bleture Fleld? Can you even api
the furore over 'The Children of
of Wrath'-was every bit as harsh with resoect to sir
circumstances in the U.S. and won everything." Qn and on, In

so many words, our systom thrives on "self-ceiticisat, and

there are things to criticize, but what other system in this world
is not only permissive: of that, but thrives on it. nd so on,

He has no doubts about. any yovernnental/social /politieal economic
system In any combInatton being able to even approach it.

itness

anchez' here while

3.- The foregoing is a very brief synopsis of a rambling and
long philosophic discussion on these points in which TICHBORN
concluded his statement -and, even, tirade (his Latin heritage
had gotten the better of him at that point) with the statement
that "My philosophy on this potnt, and my present sentiments,
have been forged in the fire of thinkIng as a leftist critic
and having come to see and -undeistand a great deal; and they,
can't cell me a dann thing about what is the best system nor.on
the basIs-of their present circumstances in their on countries
have they any right or basis for criticizing the U.S.-and its
actions. Nothing is perfrect, and t can't defend it as being
perfect, but for every Imperfection they try to show me in the
U.S. and what it has or has not done, { can show them hundreds
in thelr country and any other one they try to hold up as a model.”

4. In’so many words, at least the Station case officer at
the present time is satisfied In his own mind that TICHSORN was
speaking sincerely during this discussion and there is no question
in the 3taticn's mind about where TICHBORN stands ideatogically
even though he may be considered “left of center,"

5.) Since this Issue seems to hover constantly tn the back-
ground with TICHEORN josofar_ag KUSARK Station

Folt it would be a good idea to regi inciaent
and appealsai with Headquarters.

1, Forwerded herewith -ia the referenced amendment
Edward G, TICHBORH's contract which. provides for a, one year
extension effective 19 November 1964 and a compensation
increase from $9,000 to $12,006. |

2. During Subject's recent TOY.in Washington it was
made clear to him that this substantial pay raise and extension
of his contract. was on the basis that’ TICUBORN continue to
devote 85 to 90% of his time to KUBARK activity. Inv Y of
the fact that Subject iy currently handling only one intellectual
project for the Station,. please explzin to him that in the event
that his work losd reverts to the 50. to..65% level, he cannot
expect. to continue to'recéive thé present ‘amount of ‘compensation,
During Subject's talks at Headquarters, it appeared that
TICHBORN understands this most clearly, As a contract agent,
he is refillferated on the basis of services rendered, In return
“for this arrangement, the government makes no claim on incone
he might receive from his private business activities. “Obviously
it is our hope that. coupled with the occasional full-time
assignments in other WH countries levied on TICHBORN, that the
"Station will. be able to continue ‘to utilize Subject 's services
at the high level of activity which walt justity bis current

_compensation,

Dear Fr..-Thomes: :

. Due“to increesed demands -unon my tine ‘frov other clients,
I fina it necessery to relinguish my duties as legel counsel
for the IILR here in-Hexico, end I do v0 with ereat reluctence,
One of ny heretofore-legser clients has recently expended his
activities in certain resl estete developrents in Guedalejara
and Puerto Vallarta, thereby necései tating "YZ frecuent absence

“from Yexico City. Then, too, I had underestinsted the erount.

of tine ond effort required to satisfactorily attend the verious
legel and edzinistre tive sattera confronting CEDS, Should’ you
so desire, I could reéonnend other legel counsel; but I em
duclined to feel thet the Centro's Principal problens vould be
of an séministrative nature rather then a legel ones

As for sy legrl fees to date, I em subaitting a dill for

superficial cover for his presence and activities here up to this time.
However; he has been here long enough no# and msde enough trips to other
Latin American countries where a concinuation of this toucist status and
present cover arrangemencs should be chaagéd for something more substantial,
All of chis became apparent vhen he tegan to try to obtain his working

47.3. ‘Taking all the foregoing inco consideration and to avoid complications with

hic present projects or TICHBORN, ‘the Station acked him what understanding he
had on the proportion of hts rime ta be davoted to KUBARK activities, We said
that his presene contract was predicated on approximately 60 to s6-2/3% of
his time being utilized by KUBARK. His present estimate is that he is devoting
85 to 90%-of hie time to KUBARK activities; and, if ke is to do the kind of job
thats desired on the two intellectual projects recently acquired, he will
ustain that percentage, Of. courge, he-Contiaues to be available for appropriate
ignments {such ax FUASPEN) in other countries ‘from time

that his present contract extension éxpires 19 November 1964, i

5. ‘The Station would like to emphasize that this matter was brought up at ito
faitiative in order to try (a) to assure that demands being placed on TICHBORN
recently could’ be reasonably expected to be fulfilled and (b) to get a complete
understanding on all aspects cf TICHBORN's contractual status (written and
unweitten) so that neither the Station wor TICHBORN get committed to these
continuing activities and suddenly find themselves in contentian about the

_ TMekiborns original contract provided for travel on an sctual :

expense ‘basis. ig was when-he. was working:on a daily or job

+ ‘This;.contract was terminated: and a new contract was written.
Sn May 1961.- ‘He given'en $8,000 per year, and the reimbursement
for ‘operational travel section reads "Tbis may include per diem in

None of Tichtorn's: travel claims have been processed since the
new contract has been effective. All travel claims submitted by
him, starting in June 1961 have been submitted on an actual expense
basis. 7

Finance takes the view that the "This may include per diem---"
as restriéting Tichborn to per diem only plus of course operational
expenses. Processing Tichborns old accounts on this basis would .
require him to refund several hundred dollars.

‘An amendment, tothe contract would take care ef these old
accounts as submitted:
