extension effective 19 November 1964 and a compensation

Increase from $0,000 to $12,000.

a 91200.

During Subject's recent TDY. in Washington it was

ande clear to him that this substantial pay raise and extension

of his contract was on the basig that TICHBORN continue to

devote 85 to 90% of his time to KUBARK activity.

In view of

the fact that Bubject iu currently handling only one intellectunl

project for

the Station, please explein to him that in the event

that his work

load reverts to the 50 to 65% leyel, he cannot

expect to continue

to receive the present anount

of compensation.

During Subject's talkg at Headquarters, it appeared that

TICHBORN understands this most clearly.

As a contract agent,

he is reminerated on the basis of services rendered.

for this arrangement, the government makes no claim on incono

he might racelve Iron his privato bustness activities.

Obviously

it is our hope that coupled with the occasional full-tine

assignments in other WH countries levied on TICABORN, that the

Station will be able to continue to utilize Subject's services

at the high level of activity which will justify his current

compensation.

Dear F.r.. Thomes:

Due to ircreesed demands unon my time fron other clients,

I find it necessery to relinquish my duties es legal counsel

for the IlLR here in Mexico, end I do so with great reluctence..

One of oy lieretofore-lesser clients has recently expended his

activities in certain real estate developrents in Guadalajara

sad Fuerto Vallarta, thereby neceseitating" frequent absence

from Mexico City.

Then, too, I had underestimated

the enount

of time and effort required to satisfactorily attend the verious

legel and aisinistre, ive matters confronting CEDS.

Should you

so desire, I could recommend other legal counsel; but I cm

inclined to feel that the Centro's principal problens would be

of an edministrative nature rather then a legal one.

As for my legal fees to date, I em subaitting a bill for

$650.00 U.S. Có. This represents a totai of 65 hours et the

rate of $10.00 per hour.

Hy regular fees anount. to 820.00 per

hour, but, in keering with uy own political affinity for labor

causes, I have

reiuced then to the lesser figure.

Rey I theol you again for your confidence and good will in

hevine chosen de es legal counsel for your ore-nization's activities

ir. Mexico. I shall be happy to give you a personal report of my.

observations on my next trip lo New York.

Sincerely yours,

Henry P. Lopez

PiGlo As Headquarcers is aware,-Edward G. TICHSORN is In Mexico on a tourtst

visa and with a number of "associations" (i.e., law firm in PBPPIME, TV

and movie contacts in Mexico) which have sufficed to provide satisfactory

superficial cover for his presence and activities here up

to this time.

However; he has been here long enough now and made enough trips to other

Latin American courtrics where a concinuation of this tourist status and

present cover arrangemencs should be changed for something more substantial.

All of chis became apparent when he began to try to obtain his working

papers. TICHSORN's profession, of course, is that of a lawyer; but he

s.cannot_practice-this-profession_in.Mexico.under-Mexican-law.rTherefore,-=a

to find a peg for working paper approval, something else had to be found.

.1. As probably.can.be.discerned from previoud communications on thie subject,

the Station has never been too certain about the original understandings with

subject on his relationghip wich KUBARK. At lengt some understandings have

been

supplementary. to the forml contractfsuchcas;his.avallibility for-extended

trips to Latin American areas in election periods).

This is no complaint on

the part of the Station, büt merely a prelude to a maccer which the Station

brought up with TICHBORN in connection with his Intellectual magazine and

QRMINS activities.

2.

It has been the Station's inference, from calking to TICHBORN as well a8

comunications on oiher aspects of his relationship with KUBARK net covered

in his contract, that he 1a not to be considered a full-time contract agent.

In other words.

entered into his

original relocionship with KUBARK. As can be discerned from

his biographic data, he has operated at a level and enjoyed an income out look

chat sould not be

satisfied by the present contractual arrangements on salary.

It has become obvious to the Stacion, however, that if he is to handle, properly,

.3.. Taking all the foregoing into conalderation and to avoid complications wich

hio present projects or TICKBORN, the Station asked him what understanding ho

had op the proporriou of his time to be dovoted to KUBARX accivities.

He said

chat his present contract was predicated on approximacely 60 to 80-3/38 of

his time being utilixed by XUBARK. His predent estimate is chat he la devoting

85 to 90% of hia ciue to KUBARK actlultied; and, if he la to do che kind of job

that Is destred on the too intellectual projects recently acquired, ho vill

suetain chat percentago, Of couroe, he continues to be available for appropríato

assignments (such as FUASPEN) in other couperios from elmo

to time; but, 1t has to be recognised that when he is absent froa Moxico,

chle represents 1007 of ble time.

4.

The Station agreco with his analysts on currert commitments against hia

time on behalf of KUBARK.

Thorefore,

it was indicated to TICHBORN chat he

should be prepared to toke-up this matter with Headquarterseat the time he

wakes his late October trip to PBPRIME In connection with the nes intellectual

magazine (see reference) and that the Station would request Headquartors to be

prepared to dlacuss the matter at that time. It 18 the Station's understanding

that his present contract extension expires 19 November 1964.

5.

"The

Station would like to emphasize that this matter was brought up at ito

Initiative in order to try. (n) to assure that demands being placed

on TICHBORN

recently could be reasonably expected to be fulfilled and (b) co get a complete

understandlug on all aspects uf TICHBORN's contractual status fritten

and

unwrittend so that neither the Station nor TICHBORN get commicted to these

continuing actlvities ard suddenly find themselves in contention about the

. line/salary-Involved.-It-should also-be emphasized chat TICHBORN 4as. not.

complained about recent requiremants, but has devoted whatever time requirod

to handle them and do the Job expected.

None of Tichtorn's travel claims have been processed since the

All travel claims submitted by

Finance takes the view that the "This nay include per diem---"
