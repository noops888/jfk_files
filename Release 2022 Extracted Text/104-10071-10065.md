Forwarded herewith is a pamphlet prepared by the Japan

"Peace for Vietnam" Committee (BEHEIREN for distribution to U.S.

servicemen stationed in Japan or visiting Japan. BEHEIREN activists

are distributing these pamphlets outside major U.S. bases throughout

Japan.

BEHEIREN had planned to drop copies of this pamphlet over

the USS ENTERPRISE and the U.S. Navy Base at Sasebo during the

ENTERPRISE's visit there this month. However, this planned action

fell through due to BEHEIREN's inability to obtain the cooperation

of a Japanese newspaper, MINAMI KYUSHU SHIMBUN, in obtaining a

helicopter for the exercise.
