MEMORANDUM FOR : General Counsel
Director of Security

FROM : S.D. Breckinridge
SUBJECT 2° HSCA Request of 20 July 1978 -
a OLC- 78-2728 .

1. Attached is correspondence from the DDO focal

point on the IISCA investigation, responding to Question

£2 of reference. It states that there ure and have been

no agreements (at least not as described in the HSCA

request) between CIA and the FBI, or other governacnt

agencies, that pertain to the Agency's responsibilities

to report on U.S. citizens abroad who contact Communist

: embassies or officials. It also states that current :

legislation forbids such reporting.

Hy 2. Attached are copics of Papers collected by
i O/IG during the Rockefeller Commission's inquiry; I
recall that there vas a 1966 Treenent, which is not in
these papers. In any event ti icy do not scem to contain
’ @ specific provision such as is envisioned in the report.
It is possible that interpretations of NSCID and DCID
Provisions resulted in routine reporting of such con-
tacts, although there were no agreenents, per se, for
such action. Since the Proaulgation of Executive a
Orders 11905 and 12036 there have been limitations on
Teporting on U.S. persons, which may affect past practice.
Mouever, this office is not in a position to provide an
Agency position on this issue. . of

3. It is requested that you coordinate with the
