TEXT:

1. ACTION REQUIRED: PLEASE INCORPORATE THE FOLLOWING INTO THE
*TALKING POINTS TO BE USED IN THE PRESENTATION TO THE<JFK>
*<ASSASSINATION>RECORDS REVIEW BOARD.

2. AMBASSADOR MONDALE, THE EMBASSY STRONGLY

OPPOSE RELEASE TO THE PUBLIC OF ANY REFERENCE TO THE EXISTENCE OF A
SSIES | SUCH ACTION COULD HAVE ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES
RELATIONS AT A TIME WHEN A NUMBER OF DIFFICULT SECURITY

FOR) J
AND ECONOMIC ISSUES REMAIN UNRESOLVED. IT ALSO WOULD RISK REIGNITING

EARLIER CONTROVERSIES
PUBLIC CONFIRMATION WOULD, WITHOUT A DOUBT,
DISRUPT COOPERATION ON IMPORTANT
COUNTERTERRORIST AND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE CASES. BY MAKING THE

OBJECT OF GREATER PUBLIC AND POSSIBLY OFFICIAL SCRUTINY,
IT WOULD LOWER THE CONFIDENCE IN OUR
ABILITY TO PROTECT THEIR IDENTITY AND SECURITY.

3. IMPACT THE GOVERNMENT DOES
NOT PUBLICLY ADMIT THAT IT COLLECTS INTELLI . AS A COROLLARY,

DOES NOT ADMIT TO HAVING LIAISON RELATIONSHIPS WITH US INTELLIGENCE

AGENCIES . |AVOIDS PUBLIC ACKNOWLEDGEMENT BECAUSE IT KNOWS THAT
IS ANATHEMA TO THE LEFT WING OF THE

POLITICAL SPECTRUM, AND ANY ADMISSION WOULD GIVE THE LEFT NEW

OPPORTUNITIES TO ATTACK WHICH WAS THE
RULING PARTY AND IS TODAY THE PARTY OF THE PRIME
ANY

MINISTER AND THE LEADING PARTY WITHIN THE RULING COALITION.
OFFICIAL CONFIRMATION THAT CONTRADICTED EARLIER
SECRET



SECRET

|WOULD BE USED AS A CLUB BY THE LEFT
‘THI

TO ATTACK| asta
PRESENCE OF US/ \ WITH A STATE VISIT BY THE US

PRESIDENT FAST APPROACHING AND DELICATE NEGOTIATIONS
LIKELY TO CONTINUE INTO 1997, THIS WOULD BE A PARTICULARLY
BAD TIME TO OPEN THE DOOR TO ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS ABOUT US ACTIVITIES

AND INTENTIONS

4. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT WOULD ALSO REVIVE OLD
CONTROVERSIES THAT HAVE LARGELY RECEDED FROM THE HEADLINES.
THE PRESS MADE A MAJOR ISSUE | IN ITS
FORMATIVE YEARS. ANYTHING THAT LENT CREDIBILITY TO THE STORY WOULD
BE A SERIOUS POLITICAL LIABILITY | THEN FOREIGN MINISTER
[PERSONALLY ASKED AMBASSADOR MONDALE THAT
THE US GOVERNMENT NOT RELEASE DOCUMENTS ON THIS SUBJECT.
EXPLAINED TO AMBASSADOR MONDALE CAN DEAL WITH RUMORS AND
EVEN UNCONFIRMED LEAKS, BUT OFFICIAL CONFIRMATION

WOULD BE AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT AFFAIR, THREATENING TO Dz

BOTH THE CONSERVATIVE POLITICAL LEADERSHIP AS WELL AS THE
RELATIONSHIP. EXPLICITLY IMPRESSED ON THE AMBASSADOR

THE NEED FOR THE US GOVERNMENT TO HOLD THE LINE AGAINST DISCLOSURE.

Ss IN THE FALL OF 1995, A NEW YORK TIMES ARTICLE ALLEGED THAT
HAS SINCE BECOME PRIME

{ _\ IN RESPONSE TO THE ENSUING PRESS QUERIES, JAPANESE

OFFICIALS OF THE CONCERNED MINISTRY DISMISSED THE STORY AS
IMPLAUSIBLE. IF THE US GOVERNMENT DECLASSIFIES A THAT
CONFIRMS IT WOULD HAND THE RESS NEW
OPPORTUNITIES TO REOPEN THE ISSUE OF ALLEGED ECONOMIC ESPIONAGE AND
ATTACK THE UNITED STATES AND ITS FRIENDS WITHIN THE

GOVERNMENT .

6. DISRUPTION OF LIAISON RELATIONSHIPS:
GO TO GREAT LENGTHS TO KEEP THEIR RELATIONSHIPS WITH US INTELLIGENCE
AGENCIES SECRET. IN THE CASE.OF THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THOSE
RELATIONSHIPS, ALL CONTACT COULD BE SEVERED IN THE EVENT OF
DISCLOSURE AND EMBARRASSMENT. SUCH A RUPTURE IN THE RELATIONSHIP
DEFIES EASY REPAIR. THE SOUTH KOREAN AGENCY FOR NATIONAL SECURITY
PLANNING, WHICH SERIOUSLY EMBARRASSED JAPANESE LIAISON WHEN IT
KIDNAPPED OPPOSITION POLITICIAN KIM DAE JUNG FROM TOKYO OVER TWO
DECADES AGO, IS STILL TREATED AS A PARIAH TODAY.

IMPACT ON CONTINUING OPERATIONS: OUR ONGOING COOPERATION

IN PURSUIT OF A MAJOR INTERNATIONAL
TERRORIST GROUP COULD BE TOTALLY DISRUPTED BY DISCLOSURE. EXTREMELY
IMPORTANT US LAW ENFORCEMENT AND INTELLIGENCE EQUITIES ARE AT STAKE
IN THIS COOPERATIVE ENDEAVOR. THE TERRORIST GROUP IS PROBABLY NOT
AWARE OF THE EXTENT OF US INVOLVEMENT IN THEIR PURSUIT. DISCLOSURE
THAT REMINDED THEM OF THE POSSIBILITY OF (COOPERATION
AGAINST THEM COULD BE DETRIMENTAL TO OUR ABILITY TO COLLECT

INTELLIGENCE ON THE GROUP.
