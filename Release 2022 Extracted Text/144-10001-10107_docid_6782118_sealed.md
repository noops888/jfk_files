For

In conversation with me, MCCLOY, a member of the presidential

commission; stated that. he has serious doubts of the credibility

of the investigation to date. He does not eliminate the possibility

that the attempt on KENNEDY was made by two persons. However, in

view of JOHNSON's order that the commission investigate also the

circumstances' Of OSWALD's slaying, some of the commission's

operations and its report could come after RUBY's trial and perhaps

even after the verdict and appeals. In the mantime the trial

was postponed until 3-January (sic], and the FBI released to the

press information that their investigation confirms OSWALD's guilt,

and that he had no accomplices.
