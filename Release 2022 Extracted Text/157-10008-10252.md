Castro's life. The following exchange w:th Richard Helms makes this

point:

Senator Hart of Michigan. You tell us that it is your
impression that nothing done w: th respect to Castro by
the Agency was done without authority.

Do I understand that correctly’

Mr. Helms. It was done within the guidelines of ap-
propriate authority. In other words, we felt that we

were operating as we were supp: sed to operate, that

these things if not specifical:y authorized at least

were authorized in general terns. (Helms testimony, p. 61)

Senator Baker. Was it in your view the general policy of
the government of the United S ates as proposed to be
implemented by ‘the CIA to. kill Fidel Castro?

Mr. Helms. I believe it was tl.e policy at the time to
get rid of Castro and if killiig him was one of the things
that was to be done in this connection, that was within
what was expected.

Another witness, Samuel Halpern, re ated to the Committee a dis-

cussion he had had with Richard Bissell, who was then Deputy Director

Plans, concerning a meeting Bissell had .ttended in the Cabinet Room

of the White House:

Mr. Halpern. Mr. Bissell said he had recently-~and he didn't
specify the date or the time--iie had recently been chewed
out in the Cabinet Room of the White House by both the Presi-
dent and the Attorney General ‘or, as he put it, sitting on
his ass and not doing anything about getting rid of Castro
and the Castro regime. His or.ers to both Mr. Zogbey and to
me were to plan for an operation to accomplish that end.

Mr. Schwarz. Was any content >ut into the term "get rid of,"
or was that the term that was ised, and only that term?

Mr. Halpern. To the best of m’ recollection, that was it.
There was no limitation of any kind. Nothing was forbidden,
and nothing was withheld. And the objective was to remove
Castro and his regime. (Halpen testimony, p. 8)

It is clear that the U.S. Governmen. wanted to see the removal of

the Castro regime from Cuba and that the CIA took steps, including

Chairman Church. Deputy Direc or for Plans.

Your record shows that Helms h..d knowledge of the Z2RRIFLE
operation, which, among other -hings, was to develop an
executive capability--whatever that means. Presumably
that means a capability to com.uct an assassination if
and when authorized by proper ..uthority?

Mr. Breckinridge. That is my i.nderstanding.

Chairman Church. Is that your understanding?

Mr. Breckinridge. Yes, sir.

Chairman Church. Do your reco: ds show that, or is that
based upon what has been revea’ed through your interroga-

tion?

Mr. Breckinridge. First, let te go back and clarify,
then I will answer this questicn, if I may.

Mr. Helms approved ZRRIFLE, wh: ch the record shows has
the responsibility of stealing codes, essentially.

My understanding, from my intei views, is that ZRRIFLE
had also the responsibility fo: executive action capability.
That is a difficult phrase.

The record does not show that lr. Helms knew when he
approved the project that it hid this dual role.
(Colby testimony, pp. 66-67, 6{-70)

William Harvey confirmed the fact tlat he had been given the responsibility

of developing the ZRRIFLE project by Mr. Bissell.

Mr. Schwarz. Now, did you have a conversation with
Mr. Bissell at some point in which Mr.. Bissell asked
you to investigate a capability for Executive Action?

Mr. Harvey. Yes.

Mr. Schwarz. In any event, sone time in early '61?
Mr. Harvey. Yes.

Mr. Schwarz. What did Mr. Bissell ask you to do?

Mr. Harvey. He brought up the question of Executive
Action. He said he was concerred about it--about not
only our capabilities, if any, to perform it, but the
basic questions of protections, methods, techniques,

decisions, judgment as to its aivisability in any given
case, and this whole sort of panoply of--again, pardon



TO? SECRET

The Select Committee has not been alle to determine any direct

van
@

link between the CIA and the death of Pa:rice Lumumba. It has, how-

ever, heard testimony to the effect that an official within the CIA isirrarsaattt
directed a subordinate to investigate th: possibility of assassinating

Lumumba; that a lethal virus was transfe: red to the Congo (now Zaire)

apparently for the purpose of killing Luumba; that a foreigner was

recruited for a mission in the Congo, with assassination being originally

part of this mission; and that President Eisenhower may have ordered,

at least indirectly, an attempt to be mace on the life of Lumumba.

Investigating the P:ssibility
The CIA official directly involved :n investigating the possibility
of assassinating Lumumba was Richard Bis: ell, who was, at that time,

Deputy Director Plans. The following exc hange refers to a discussion

. By

Mr. Rissell had with Justin O'Donnell, tl.en Deputy Chief, of Staff, in

the DDP.

a eeeeae Mr. Schwarz. Did you ask him :n words or substance to seeaeeeae
kill Mr. Lumumba?

Mr. Bissell. I asked him to il vestigate the possibility
and to make explanation for so doing.

Mr. Schwarz. When did you do that?

Mr. Bissell. I don't remember the date of that. I may
have it on a chronology here, tut I image that is a
matter of record, or that he his testified to that date.
I don't remember the date.

Mr. Schwarz. Did you tell him this connection with
making plans to go see the pas:er of the poison,
Mr. Gottlieb?

Mr. Bissell. I think I probably did.

nw'47129 “Docid



Se

Mr. Schwarz. Did he tell you le wouldn't do it?

Mr. Bissell. Later he told me that he didn't want
to do it. But he also said thi.t he thought it was
an inappropriate action, and tl.at the desired object
could be accomplished better ii. other ways.

Mr. Schwarz. Who authorized yu to tell Mr. O'Donnell
to take steps to move toward a: sassinating Mr. Lumumba?

Mr. Bissell. Nobody.
Mr. Schwarz. Did you inform tle White House of that? |
Mr. Bissell. No.

Mr. Schwarz. To the best of ycur knowledge, did any-
body inform the White House of that?

Mr. Bissell. To the best of m knowledge, no.

Mr. Schwarz. Why did you seek to assassinate Mr.
Lumumba?

Mr. Bissell, I didn't seek to assassinate him. I told
a member of the clandestine se: vice to make plans and
develop the capability to do s« if it were approved” and
ordered.

Senator Goldwater. Approved b:: whom?

Mr. Bissell. It would have thin had to have approval
at the highest level of goverment.

The Chairman. Where did the icea come from?

Mr. Bissell. I don't remember Mr. Chairman. It could
possibly have been mine.

The Chairman. It could possib’ y have been yours?

c

Mr. Schwarz. Did you tell Rosiow that was your initiative?

Mr. Bissell. I told him that the instruction as to O'Donnell

was my initiative.

Senator Baker. How many other: did you plan on, just as
a contingency?

How many other people did you :nstruct to draw up plans
to assassinate?

Mr. Bissell. I don't believe i here were any others which
went to the point of instructirg that a man be prepared.

In his testimony before the Select ommittee, Mr. O'Donnell

rf

r confirmed Mr. Bissell's account.

Mr. O'Donnell. And so he callcd me in and he told

me he wanted me to go down to he Belgian Congo, the

former Belgian Congo, and to e.iminate Lumumba. I eee
would also like to add the cau ion that any remarks

I may make about Mr. Bissell o anybody else that it

is all indirect discourse. Wh:n I say, Mr. Bissell

said go to the Congo, please di not include quotation

marks, go to the Congo. It's .11 Mr. Bissell said,

that he wanted me to go to the Congo.

Mr. Wides. What did you under.itand him to mean by
eliminate?

Mr. O'Donnell. To kill him am. thereby eliminate his
influence.

Mr. Wides. What did you say to him?

Mr. O'Donnell. TI told him tha: I would absolutely
not have any. part of killing Limumba. He said, I

-~ want you to go over and talk t Sidney Gottlieb-- ere
And I went over--he was Dr. :Bo:tlieb at the time and
since--and he told me, I told iim I had been sent

oe by Mr. Bissell, and he told me that there were four
or five--and I use the word foir or five advisedly,
I'm not just saying three or four, as I recall one
of the methods was a virus and the others included
poison.

. And I just felt at the time thit with Gottlieb, don't ——
argue with him.

Mr. Wides. He told you there vere four or five what?
What did he say to you?

Mr. O'Donnell. Let me say let'ial means of disposing
of Lumumba. I then left his o fice and I went back
to Mr. Bissell's office and I :old him in no way
would I have any part in the a:sassination of Lumumba.

Mr. Wides. Before you go on any further, did you or
he mention whether there was any higher authority than
Mr. Bissell for this operation either Mr. Dulles or
outside of the CIA at the Pres dential level?

Mr. O'Donnell. No, sir, in no way. I felt--again,
this has to be tenuous--but I certainly would not

have done it if I thought Mr. julles was opposed to eet
it.

You assumed-—

Mr. Wides.

Mr. O'Donnell. I assumed that he had authority from
Mr. Dulles in such an importan: issue, but it was not
discussed, nor did he purport -:o have higher authority
to do it.

@>

Mr. Wides. Did you then, afte: speaking to Mr. Bissell,
speak to anyone else that even.ng about this request and
your reactions?

Mr..O"Donnell. Yes, sir. An! I went into Mr. Helms'
office, and I said, Dick, here is what Mr. Bissell
proposed to me, and I told him that I would under no
conditions do it, and Helms sad you're absolutely
right.

Now, again, indirect discourse He told me that I was
absolutely right. And I felt chat then I had a senior

man who was on record as far a.; my position was concerned.
(O'Donnell testimony, June 9 p». 11-16)

The Lethal Vi-us
~ Shortly after his conversation with Mr. Bissell, Mr. O'Donnell
eS went to the Congo. Upon his arrival, he discovered that a virus had,
* in fact, arrived in the Congo and was in the possession of the CIA

Station Chief.

‘ Mr. Wides. Shortly after that did you, in fact, go to -
the Congo?

Mr. O'Donnell. I went, I woul guess, within 48 hours.

Mr. Wides. You were there for about three months, the
last quarter of 1960, approxim: tely?

Mr. O'Donnell. Yes, that is « rrect.

Mr. Wides. The Station Chief \as who at that time?

Mr, O'Donnell. Mr. Larry Devl:n, a very fine, dedicated
person. Mr. Devlin indicated'to me that there was a

virus in the safe.

Mr. Wides. Did he indicate it was a lethal virus?

Mr, O'Donnel?. He did not, bul I knew it wasn't for a
somebody to get' his polio shot up to date.

an
The Select Committee has been unabl.. to determine how the virus
[ ) found its way to the Congo and for what ‘se it was intended. The
Committee has reason to believe the viru: was ultimately returned to

Agency headquarters in Washington.

A Clue to Presidential Involvement
The discussion between Mr. Bissell ind Mr. O'Donnell, as well as

the arrival of the lethal virus in the Congo, occurred during the fall
of 1960. The Select Committee has heard the testimony of one witness
who remembered a National Security Counc .1 meeting in the summer of
1960 in which President Eisenhower made -eference to his desire to see
Lumumba eliminated. This witness, Rober: Johnson, made it clear to the
Committee that what he had heard at this meeting should be considered
"a clue, rather than precise evidence of Presidential involvement."

Mr. Johnson. What I am going .o tell you should be

understood clearly for what it is--a clue, rather

than precise evidence of Presi.ential involvement

in decision making with respec: to assassinations.

I would be extremely concerned if I felt that this

information were to be the bas s in itself for ©

. conclusions by this committee ur if it were other-
wise to be made public.

As a member of the NSC staff during the Eisenhower
Administration, I sometimes at ended meetings of
the National Security Council .o take notes on the
discussion.

I attended one such NSC meetin;, in the summer of
1960. I shold note parenthet cally that I have
refreshed my-memory as to the »robable time of
the meetipg by checking the hi:.torical record of
international developments. A that meeting, there
was a discussion of developmen s of what was then
the Congo, now Zaire.

At some time during that discu:.sion President Eisen-
hower said something--I can no longer remember his
words~-that came across to me «.s an order for the
assassination of Lumumba who wis then at the center

of political conflict and contioversy in the Congo.
There was no discussion; the meeting simply moved on.
I remember my sense of that monent quite clearly
because the President's statement came as a great
shock to me. I cannot, however, reconstruct the
moment more specifically. (Rotert Johnson testimony,
June 18, pp. 5-6)

Concluding Remark
In his testimony before the Select (ommittee, Director Colby had
this to say about U.S. involvement in the death of Patrice Lumumba:

Mr. Colby. There are a series of other charges,

Mr. Chairman, about assassination that have been

made about CIA in the past, of Mr. Lumumba. There

is no question about it that at one point there

was a low level discussion that maybe that would

be something that should be dore. There is an in-

dication that a foreigner was recruited to go down _

there, but our records very clearly indicate that

his function turned entirely irto other activities
ro and things of

that nature, and there is no irdication of any

attempt by us to engage in an zssassination of
r Mr. Lumumba. He was actually essassinated by some
Congolese forces. Clear, that we have absolutely
nothing to do with, so the Lummba case I think we
can absolutely say we had nothing to do with the
Lumumba case. (Colby testimony, May 15, p. 65)

October 6, 1961: McCone Cable %egarding Assassination

Mr. Kirbow. The record before the Committee indicates
that Smith’reported that he hai recommended to Ambas-
sador Lodge that "We do not se: ourselves irrevocably
against the assassination plot since the other two
alternatives mean either a bloodbath in Saigon or a
protracted struggle which couli rip the army and the
country asunder."

Mr. McCone directed by cable t» Saigon of 6 October--
"McCone directs that you withd-aw recommendation to
Ambassador concerning assassinition plan under McCone
instructions as we cannot be i1 position actively con-
doning such course of action aid thereby engaging our
responsibility therefor."

Senator Schweiker. Would you :xplain what that means?

Mr. Colby. What that means? ‘t means we don't want
to have anything to do with an assassination plan.

Senator Huddleston. You are eiminating that as an
alternative?

Mr. Colby. That is part of ou: concept of what to do.
Senator Schweiker. Didn't tha: contradict what you
were saying a few minutes ago? Didn't you say we

were in essence--

Mr. Colby. We were looking to the overthrow of the
government.

Senator Schweiker. I see what you are saying.

Mr. Colby. But not the assass nation in this case of
the brothers Nhu and Kahn.

Senator Schweiker. The other vent forward?

Mr. Colby. The other program «continued, yes.

van

Mr. Colby. This is a memorandim written after a
debriefing of our Ambassador tlere. And the de-
briefing apparently covered th: conversation, which
indicated that the dissidents id need guns and
ammunition from the U.S., and ;articularly they
needed a small number of high-owered rifles with
telescopic lenses.

The Ambassador said he saw no ; roblem in the pur-
chase and delivery clandestine y of the arms for
the dissidents, but he said, 0. course, this raises
the question of whether the U.‘. Government wants
to engage in this activity.

And our officer said that this is, of course, a
policy decision, the CIA could deliver the arms,
if this is the group we want tv support.

Mr.:Schwarz. In June of 1960 «id the government
state that policy decision, an. state that the
government of the U.S. was prevared to participate
in the overthrow of the Trujil..o regime to the
following extent:

"To provide a small number of iniper rifles or
other devices for the removal wf key Trujillo
people from the scene?" a

Mr. Colby. Yes.

Mr. Schwarz. And who made tha. decision on behalf
of the U.S. Government?

Mr. Colby. Well, we have a meiorandum that in-
dicates that that was told to -he Chief of our
Western Hemisphere Division by t
Secretary of State for Latin A ertuaw Affairs.

Mr. Schwarz. Who was then Ying ayetitom?

Mr. Colbiiemalir, Rubgttom.

Mr. Schwarz.~ In July of 1960 lid General Cabell,
the Acting BCI, accept the recommendation made by
the CIA staff and concurred in by Mr. Richard Helms,
that 12 0s. rifles, model 1903, with telescopic
sights, be sent to underground opposition forces

in the Dominican Republic?

Mr. Colby. Yes. The proposal was to procure
and deliver them by air, paracuting them into
the country.

If they could not be delivered by air, they were
planning for a way in which tise weapons could

be delivered by sea. And ther: was a considerable
discussion of ways to get it it

\

Mr. Breckinridge. There was n delivery.

Mr. Colby. And there was neve’ a delivery of those
particular weapons.

Mr. Schwarz. Going back to th: reference to the
Assistant Secretary of,Staté wi.o authorized the
delivery of the rifles on beha £ of the U.S. Govern-
ment, who authorized his makin;, that statement?

Mr. Colby. I don't think we kiow.

The Chairman. Under your proci:dure, if you receive

an order from the-Assistant Se: retary of State to

send rifles into a Latin Ameri: an country, or any

other foreign country, for the purpose that we have

discussed that the record disc. oses, is that a suf- a
ficient authority on which the CIA would then take

action?

cn Mr. Colby. No, I don't beliew: it is. Certainly _ —
it is not under our present ru'es. And I think at
that time it is really quite wlikely, in my opinion,
that that approval could have leen given by the
Ag¥tsteht Sdécretary*acting alore unless he was
acting under a general delegat: on of authority to
approve details of a larger idia that had been dis- cet
cussed even orally at the senicr levels.

Now, I don't think we have any record of those dis-
cussions.

Mr. Schwarz. Do you have any «oubt that the policy
question referred to and the qiestion "Whether the
U.S. Government wants to engage in this activity"
refers f@™BRe use of such weapcns for the purpose
of killing people, assassinatiig people?

Mr. Colby. Killing people, ye:. Assassinating is
another werd, unfortunately.

The Chairman. Killing is the tetter word.

FOP SECK

Mr. Colby. Yes. But assassin.tion has a slightly
different meaning. But I thin’. that in particular
quotation of page 22 there is -ery clearly reflection
of the thought process that I \'as explaining, that
the CIA could do it if it had . policy approval to
do it. And we don't know wher: that policy approval
actually came, except from the Assistant Secretary.
(Colby testimony, June 4, pp. +7-40)

January, 1961: Special sroup Decision

Mr. Schwarz. In 1961, January 12, 1961, did the
Special Group approve a recomm:ndation made apparently
by the Department of State tha: limited supplies of
the small arms and other materials to be made avail-
able for dissidents inside the Dominican Republic?

Mr. Colby. Our records do indicate a memorandum that
the Special Group did explain, did approve that on
January 12th--

Mr. Schwarz. January 12, 1961, and January 24, 1961
confirmed?

Mr. Colby. The 24th, really, [ think it was discussed
on the 12th and-- -
Mr. Schwarz. They approved it on the 12th and con-
firmed it on the 24th?

Mr. Colby. Right.
The Chairman. The Special Gro ip being--

Mr. Colby. The predecessor of the Forty Committee.
I can't tell you exactly who wis a member at that time.

Mr. Schwarz. Now, recognizing the difficulty you have
been having with respect to whit is an assassination as
opposed _to what is help to dissidents, are you capable
from the retords here of testizying whether the Special
Group--testifying which branch of that Special Group
thought they were approving? r is that something that
you cannot_tell from these records?

Mr. Colby. This record merely says, limited amounts of
small arms, a limited supply o: small arms and related
equipment. I do not know whetier Mr, Rubottom, for
instance, attended the Special Group meeting. It was
the pattern at that time for tie action officer of the
CIA, the Division Chief of the area, and frequently the
Assistant Secretary of that ar2a, to attend that kind
of a Forty Committee meeting wien a subject in their
area was being discussed.

Mr. Schwarz. Is it fair to sa: from the written
record as presented in the 196° Report that one
cannot tell, up to this point, whether the Special
Group approved merely the send.ng of arms to
dissidents in a sort of genera. fashion, or ap-
proved the sending of arms to -lissidents in a
target fashion for use in an a;:sassination?

Mr. Colby. No, you cannot tel., except by the
knowledge of possibly the Assi itant Secretary ©
of State. (Colby testimony, Jine 4, pp. 41-43)

March, 1961: The Purpose of the Weapons

Mr. Schwarz. It is perfectly :lear, is it not,
from the written record that a: least by March 17,
1961 that any weapons that wer.: delivered were de-
signed for the purpose of assa.isination?

Mr. Colby. That any weapons wiich would be --
delivered would probably be us::d by the dissident ~~
group in an attack on Trujillo

—
Mr. Schwarz. And that means tle assassination

of Trujillo does it not? : —

Mr. Colby. Yes.

Mr. Schwarz. It is clear, is .t not, looking at

the cable of March 17, that th..t weapon is for the y
purpose of an assassination, aid the CIA headquarters

was so informed?

Mr. Colby. Yes.

The whole discussion of the va: ious kinds of

weapons was aimed at providing the dissident group

with the weapons that they cou'd use against Trujillo

and those around him. (Colby :estimony, June 4, p. 67)

March, 1961: Weapon: Provided

Mr. SchwaxzZ. Following the in: tial turndown of

delivery by the pouch, did the Agency in fact ship

the revolvers sometime after Mirch 25th and were

authorized by Mr. Bissell to dc so? --

Mr. Colby. I don't think we slipped the revolvers.
What we shipped, were carbines.
