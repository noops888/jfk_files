MEMORANDUM FOR: Assistant Deputy Director/IOS

SUBJECT : Military Armament Corporation,
Powder Springs, Georgia; Subsidiary of
__Environmental Industries,..Inc. ,
“Washington, D. C. - alleged CIA
Involvement

1. On 3 November 1970, T. Preston HENDRICK, Washington,
D. C. District Manager, Dun and Bradstreet, Inc., (DOD Contract
61-88 ML),,.; extremely valuable WFO information source, contacted
Special Agtit(David W. GLASS, Jr} ‘by telephone and said he had a
matter which he thought, in the interest of national security, we possibly
might be interested in looking into. He-briefly explained the problem
which had come to his attention from Dun & Bradstreet's Atlanta, Georgia
Office, and it was agreed that Special Agent(GLASS} 3 would meet with him
in his “office the following day.

2, Gn 4 November 1970, Mr. HENDRICK gave Special Agent
GAs: he attached xerox copies of an informal memo dated 20 October
1970 from D&B's Atlanta, Georgia Office, Subject: Environmental
Industries, Inc. (Exhibit 1); a D&B Business Information Report dated
9 September 1970 on Military Armament Corporation, Powder Springs,
Georgia, representing a subsidiary of Environmental Industries, Washing-
ton, D. C. (Exhibit 2); and a ten page article from the August 1970 issue
of "Atlanta" Magazine (Exhibit 3). HENDRICK commented that this article
(Exhibit 3) has no by-line heading, and no mention of the author's name
and is written in such a manner as to imply an association between CIA
and the principal of Military Armament Corporation Mr. Mitchell L.
WERBELL II.


3. Mr, HENDRICK noted that the attached memorandum
from the D&B Atlanta Office (Exhibit 1) is self-explanatory, but
added that the Atlanta Office is receiving a lot of inquiries on both
of the companies, The D&B Report (Exhibit 2) is the first and only
such report yet produced by Dun & Bradstreet's Atlanta Office. The
Dun & Bradstreet Washington, D. C. Office has had no other require-
ments for information on the local company, Environmental Industries,
Inc. However, the D&B Washington Office, in response to the D&B
Atlanta Office request for information, has so far ascertained only
that Environmental Industries located at 955 L'Enfant Plaza S, W..,
-Washington, D. C. ostensibly is a one room type operation with a
telephone (554-9572) and one female employee who would not identify
herself; this person told D&B's investigator that he should not have come
there-that everything about both firms had to come from Powder Springs,
Georgia.

4, Mr, HENDRICK said his first impression after the article
(Exhibit 3) was that the comments involving CIA "were ridiculous, pre-
posterous, and were written by a nut who is as nutty as Mitchell L.
WERBELL III seems to be", however, aS a citizen he (HENDRIC. ) 8
did not want to take any chances and decided to call Special Agen David
W. GLASS.\ HENDRICK also thought it conceivable that fraud might
possibly be involved, but indicated that he has not mentioned this matter
to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
5. Mr. HENDRICK said that at some point he will have to
respond to Atlanta's request for information on Environmental Industries,
Inc. either by saying the Washington Office is not going to write a report
or stating an opinion that the information in the "Atlanta" Magazine article
ems completely ridiculous. Mr. HENDRICK indicated to Special Agent
°3(GLASS) that if at all possible he would appreciate some guidelines - if
nothing more than sending the D&B Atlanta Office a xerox copy of the
National Security Agency Act and CIA Mission as described in the United
States Government Manual or some other public document. HENDRICK
made it clear he was passing all above information to us on a completely
informal unofficial basis and indicated he realized it is possible confirma-
tion or denial of implied CIA interest may not be possible.

thing but visible—visible and audible, for that
matter—spent an unhappy time in the ’60’s ad-
justing to the discovery that the United States had an
invisible government, too: in point of fact, two of
them. There is, for one, the CIA, all over Washington;
then, second, there is the national syndicate of or-
ganized crime, all over everything else. But it has re-
mained for the ration of the '70’s to discover
that—perhaps bly—once these two shadow
powers collided somewhere, the confrontation esca-
lated into an invisible war. 7
It may well be the first full-scale secret war Ameri-
cans have ever fought: its origins disguised, its battles
unreported, its casualties anonymous, even its most
obvious scars so blithely ignored that when a French
reporter recently wrecked her car in one of its gaping
bomb craters, she complained of “potholes.” The

LN mericans who never thought of politics as any-

battleground is the nearby Caribbean nation of Haiti
and the immediate issue is simple: who will con-
trol her Maryland-sized national territory and 4.5
million desperate people? But the real struggle is for
far bigger stakes: primacy over the entire Caribbean
and its vast potential wealth. And—in the ultimate
upset to American tradition—the bad guys seem to

Tt is not impossible that, as in Vict Nam, our ‘un-
declared war in Haiti might flicker on and off until
the ’80’s arrive, but one of its most un-American
aspects is bound to disappear by then: it-will no longer
be a secret. It will be the much-debated public prop-
erty of historians, policy scholars, social acientists—

rey, a plumbing contractor in Melbourne, Florida.
ne spring morning: two men in-neat dark suits drove
up.to the Humphrey house in Melbourne :and handed
Jay a strange draft notice. They were friendly men
with an easy way of getting down to first names (“I'm
Bernie,” “I’m Raymond, just call me Ray”), and they
had all the usual accoutrements: a basic Chevy with a
clipboard on the dash; some. papers to sign; some
money in an envelope; an air ticket to Miami.

Eight weeks later Jay Humphrey, a six-foot-four,
spectacularly muscled Air Force veteran and champion
weight lifter who had flown combat in Korea, found
himself back at the controls of a heavily laden attack
bomber. Coming in on deck over the glittering Carib-
bean, roaring rooftop level past the piers of Port-au-
Prince, Humphrey banked sharply into a low-altitude
bombing run on the triple-domed presidential palace
of Doctor Duvalier.

Dead ahead, the bomber crew saw the presidential
guard’s gunnery crew scramble wildly for the four-
harreled Oerlikon ack-ack cannon mounted on the
palace roof, but Humphrey felt only elation. He had

“If that. do had lasted another week, I’d made first-

‘And although the Cuban invasion beachhead vanished
in 48 hours, the list with Jay Humphrey's name on it

to flight duty against another tropical tyrant.

But how did Jay, a good ol’ boy from grits-and-gravy

named Kathy and a baby son—how did he happen to
find himself up here in the sultry, sinister tropical sky,
aiming explosive eggs at the president of anation legally,

government just dropped the case.”

Wherever the military equipment came
from, Papa Doc necded it desperately, for
throughout the ‘60's Washington's invis-
ible government pressed its attack on
the detested dictator.

In 1963 Gen. Leon Cantave, the
whitehaired, widely respected former
chief of staff of Haiti's army and a self-
exile from Duvalicr’s dictatorship, was
secretly offered funds and facilities by a
White House adviser for a commando in-
vasion of Haiti across the Dominican
frontier. The funds subscquently came

and as a paramilitary “adviser.” He is
a compulsive warrior, an armed crv-
sader fighting against what Gov. Les-
ter Maddox calls “ungodly Common-
ism.” WerBell is not alone in this oc-
cupation, but he practices it in a
~—“uitiqoe-mamner. Most soldiers of for--
tune are nothing else; and they- live
from one little war to the next, brawl-
ing and boozing their way through a
tough and financially unrewarding
life. - :
WerBell, by contrast, is a business-
man who dabbles in military adven-
ture only when and as far as it suits
him. If combat didn’t titillate him, he
wouldn't partake of it. His business is
supplying weapons, not using them in
anger. He specializes in the weapons
and techniques of “counter-insur-
gency,” which may be roughly de-
fined as the forceful suppression. of
coups d'état, rebellions and the like.
The way WerBell operates, this
means defending established regimes,
some of them dictatorships, against
armed revolt. This political posture
not only docs not trouble WerBell, it
* pleases him. “I have no objection to
dictatorship if it serves the interests of
the country,” he says. Particularly if
the threat to those interests is from
the left: “Communism has no place in

Now and again, WerBell'’s name
pops into the news, bringing Powder
Springs a certain national attention.
= a-noted journal
ist-adventurer, a few years ago wrote
pieces for True and London’s Daily
Telegraph Magazine on arms brokers
and sprinkled them liberally with tales
and pictures of WerBell’s exploits.
The first issue of the new muckraking,
magazine, Scanlan’s, carried an -ex-|
haustive story on CBS’ involvement in|
an abortive invasion of Haiti in 1966.

tion. (WerBell was arrested and it
dicted after the fiasco, but charges}
against him were dropped, while six}
others arrested were brought to trial.
Asked by a friend for an explanation,

WerBell replied jauntily, “When you!

work for the company, they take care
‘of You. Till never feat another word
about it.” So far he hasn't, he main-
tains.)

Last December, WerBell hit the
front page of The Atlanta Constitu-
tion when a shipment of captured
enemy weapons bound from Vietnam
was detained at Eglin Air Force Base,
Florida. A national columnist conjec-

tured that WerBell or his friends
meant to distribute the weapons io
right-wing extremist groups in the
U.S. WerBell angrily denies that.
They were souvenir weapons given to
him by friendly forces in Vietnam, he
said, and they were shipped to the
States for display in military mu-
seumsj

Not surprisingly, WerBell has often
been called an operative of the Cen-

tral Intelligence Agency (CIA), a
‘ge that angers him only when it is

leveled too vehemently. It is not that
he has anything against the CIA. He
just doesn’t, he says, happen to be
one of its boys. His paramilitary
work, which consists of advising and
sometimes directly assisting foreign
governments, is done in the employ of
what he calls “an independent group
of well-intentioned, patriotic Ameri-
cans.” The Birch Society? The Min-
utemen? A bunch of far-right Texas
millionaries? WerBell won't say, other
than to insist that it is not the CIA.

It hardly matters, for according to
WerBell it is all in the service not
only of freedom and anti-Communism
but of the U.S. government; he does
not supply or advise or fight for re-
gimes not bearing the State Depart-
ment seal of approval. A heavy per-

centage of his merchandise goes di- ©

Town THE DRIVEWAY that snakes
through the country estate came two
tcen-aged boys. They were clean-cut
and handsome in the traditional col-
lege fashion, and they looked at home
iu the quiet, ieaty setting. But one
wore. a camouflage suit and carried a
large pistol in each hand; the other
had an M-3 “grease gun” tucked
under one arm and a silencer-
equipped sniper rifle under the other.
Behind them, propelling himself vig-
orously in a wheelchair, came thcir
father, Mitchell Livingston WerBell

III of Powder Springs, Georgia—sol--

dicr of fortune, militant anti-Com-
munist and one of the nation’s leading
developers of military weapons and
accessories.

Mitch IV and Geoff chatted lightly

about the weapons they. were-carry--
~ing—Their father, temporarily immo=

bilized by a fractured heel, punctured
the conversation with brief bursts of
information about the sniper rifle, one
of his most choice products. “This
weapon has killed nineteen hundred
V.C. [Viet Cong] in six months,” he
said proudly. “Those V.C. took only
one-point-three rounds per kill.
Twenty-seven cents apiece they cost
Uncle Sam. That’s the greatest cost
effectiveness the Army's ever known.

LEFT: Matchen WerBail Mi
Raa (NOU Meo Beit Coben

And there hasn’t been a single Ameri-
can casualty.”

Moments later, as WerBell and I
stood closer than I like to an operat-
ing firearm, young Mitch and Geoff
pumped round after round from the
weapons into the bullet-shattered hulk
of an automobile that serves as the
primary target on the WerLell M4
range. While the boys were loading, I
was struck by the incongrvity of the
setting. The 60-acte Powder Spriags
estate, designed to fulfill the hunting
and fishing desires of its first owner,
Talmadge Dobbs of ihe Life Insucance
Company of Georgia, was now being
used for the design and testing of
deadly weapons. Dobbs, I thought,
would spin in his grave.

My little reverie was interrupted by

-the BANG of young Mitch firing one

pistol,-a’standard-Army~.45. The gun
jerked upward, and the noise echocd
across the fields and treetops. He then
picked up a strange, smoothly rectan-
gular handgun, an Ingram Model 11,
equipped with a “flash and muzzle
suppressor,” and began firing it. The
muzzle barely moved, and the only
sound was a metallic click, followed
by the zing of the bullet and the pop
as it hit the target. The effect was
eerie, almost chilling, especially when

young Mitch put the gun on full auto-
matic and whipped off 15 clicking
tounds in one second. Geoff provided
the same kind of demonstration with
the grease gun. a standard military
submachine gun and the sniper rifle,
which WerBell calls the XM-21 and
which is also equipped with a sup-
pressor.

On the way back to the house,
WerBell explained why the ‘suppres-
sor, commonly called a silencer, is so
effective a firearm accessory. “It
hides the muzzle flash and reduces the
fiting sound to just metal on metal.
You can't silence the bolt noise with-
out an elaborate system, and it’s not
worth it. You can’t hear the bolt noise
anyway in a combat situation, so for
all practical purposes the firing is
soundless. Often, the loudest noise is

“when the bullet hits home. If it hits a

human, it makes a peculiar, thunking
sound, like hitting a watermelon.”
Mitch WerBell sounds completely
matter-of-fact when he talks about
firearms and death, and with reason.
He has been in the military hardware
business for years, and he has either
heard or produced—or both—the
thunking watermelon sound many
times—in Latin America and South-
east Asia, in the U.S. armed forces

rectly to the U.S. government, which
distributes it to its own forces that
need silent or exotic weapons. The
balance is sold to friendly govern-
ments, either directly or through the
good offices of the “independent
group.” He says he does not sell to in-
dividuals, not even if they're certified
anti-Communists.

WerBell takes pains to point out
that he is no ordinary arms broker.
That is, he is not one of those shad-
owy figures who sell weapons to both
sides at exerbitant prices or who take
Possession of contraband shipments
on the high seas. “We do represent
certain producers other than our-
selves, and we can get a tank or a de-
stroyer or an airplane for customers
who want them. But we've never been
in the surplus business, and we’ve
never supplied Loth sides. We've always
adhered to a basic policy: There is only
one friend of the U.S. in a given area,
and we deal only with that friend.”

What does WerBell peddle? A
range of firearms from machine guns
to desk-sized cannons, from the
meancst-looking weapons to innocent-
looking swagger sticks that fire a bul-
let or even a small rocket; an array of
techniques—"systems,” he calls them
—that will help an American soldier
or a foreign army hold off insurgent

forces; and, occasionally, his personal
services. These services preseny
WerBell at his most shadowy. Serving
as a combatant in the armed forces of
a foreign nation is against U.S. law,
and WerBell is understandably reluc-
tant to admit having done so. He de-
scribes himself in such terms as “par-
amilitary” and “adviser,” but ac-
quaintances suspect he has been in
the thick of the fighting a number of
times. He may even have zapped an
insurgent or two..

For one thing, he loves a fight. CEnvi

“Mitch is afraid of nothing,” says a
long-time Atlanta friend. “I remem-
ber he used to get into fights in bars.
One time he got into a hassle at the
railroad station. He was seeing some
friends off, after having a few drinks,
and he decided he didn’t want the
train to leave just then. He wound up
getting arrested, and the list of
charges, resisting arrest and all that,
kept stressing ‘profanity’ at the tag
end of each charge. He was a wild
one, all right.”

The WerBell of today still likes his
whiskey and savors a good round of
counter-insurgency, but the urge to
fight for the hell of it is waning. He is,
after all, primarily a businessman, a
designer, developer, and peddler of
special purpose weapons. The pur-

prings, Military ce a

poses are almost as varied as the
weapons themselves: from mowing
down a line of combat troops to si-
lently picking off a lone Y.C. to cut-
ting short a would-be assassin to turn-
ing the tables on the bad guys by as-
sassinating them.

He comes by both his militarism
and his anti-Communism honestly.

His father was an officer in the Rus-
n_Imperial_army, even though he

was born in the United States. “It was
.a tricky situation,” says. Mitch. “He
was a citizen of both the U.S. and
Russia. In those days you could do
that.” The elder- WerBell fought
against the Bolsheviks, but before the ’
collapse of the ezarist regime he
wisely secured an appointment as liai-
son officer between the Russian and
American forces—stationed in the
USS. He lived in this country for the
test of his life, putting his early medi-
cal training to use in cancer research
while living the good life. “My father
was a man of means,” Mitch says. “He
traveled a lot, did a lot of big game
hunting, things like that.”

Father came by that honestly too.
For generations, the WerBells have
isi been men of means. Mitch traces the

Another legacy from father is
Mitch's barcly disguised aristocratic
sympathies. He has been quoted as
saying, “Communism is a substitution
of a peasant dictatorship over the
istocracy—I prefer the arictac
He scoffs at such statements as “I kid
about being a constitutional monarch-
ist, bu: only if I'm the monarch”, yet
lic is without question an elitist. Not
surprisingly, his elite is comprised of
superpatriois and military men, who
would be given powerful roles in any
nation’s affairs.

Mitchell WerBell was born in
Pennsylvania, shortly after his Rus-
sian-American father and his
Scottish-bern mother arrived in the
U.S. at the end of World War I. His
parents traveled a good deal, here and
abroad, and Mitch traveled with
them, picking up his education as he
went. He got a degree in journalism
from the University of Pennsylvania

Rus:

in World War II, he joined the OSS_a-b .

sort of cloal:-and-daggcr Green Beret
operation. He served with an OSS
unit behind Japanese lines in China,
rising to the rank of captain and ac-
quiring a taste for guerilla-type war-
fare he would never lose.

WerBell came to Atlanta shortly

Rich’s advertising department. It was
a small department in those days, and
WerBell proved himself a capable ad
man. Soon he was head of the depart-
ment, and soon after that he went on
his own. He formed Mitchell WerBell
Advertising, which later became
WerBell, Seklemian and North. Vet-
eran Atlanta advertising men recall
WerBell as being aggressive and im-
aginative, a good addition to the busi-
ness, “He did some first-rate work,”
says one, “and he handled some big
accounts, Barwick Mills, for in-

In the mid-fifties, WerBell pulled
out of his agency (there are dark sto-
Ties about how he was done in by as-
sociates), and the agency collapsed
not long afterward. He then formed
his own public relations firm, and
here the story line gets fuzzy—be-
cause it begins to involve interna-
tional military intrigue. “I'd already
been drifting into international p.r.,”
WerBell says, “using my family back-

more of what he calls # “geopolitical”

amilitary operation was in the Donin

ican Republic, during the 1965 revolt.
He was, of course, on the side of the
govermacnt, which was fending off al-
legedly Communist insurgents; the
United States was on its side too.
WerRell wound up in the midsi of the
fighting. He was the second Domini-
can government man to reach the
Ozama River, scene of the major bat-
tle, Ellsworth Bunker, then U.S. am-
buassador to ine Organization of
American States, becaine highly exer-
cised aver WerBell’s activitics and his
hawkish views on the conflict (Wer-
Bell opposed a cessation of hostilities
and establishment of a coalition gov-
ernment). Bunker considered trying
to toss WerBell out of the DomRep,
as old Caribbean hands cali the coun-

‘try, but nothing came of it. WerBeli's

“independent group"—CIA, Texas

millionaires or whatever—saw to that.{}

WerBell was already active in the
anti-Castro| movement, and he
brought to it a sense of dash and dis-
cipline that the ragtag, bickering
bunch of Cuban exiles had seldom
seen. Perhaps his majer anti-Castro
exploit was a spcedboat foray into
Camarioca, on Cuba’s southern coast.
The mission was to drop a swimmer,
apparently = spy, offshore, fand to
pick up the family of an exile leader.
The boat, flying the Confederate flag
on the radio antenna, foundered in
high seas, and the raiding party was
captured. The Cubans, the story goes,
did not know what to make of the
brash WerBell, and he and his pals
wound up’stcaling a Castro boat and
spiriting some 16 anti-Castroites out
of the country before they themselves
returned to the U.S.

In the late °60s, WerBell turned his
attention to Southeast Asia. He is, of
course, a superhawk on Vietnam, and
would be happy if the U.S. were also
fighting Communism in all its neigh-
boring countries. He was in Thailand.
“working closely with the Supreme
Command,” for months, promoting
the sales of his weapons and system:
“I showed them things like surveil-
lance equipment and night vision
equipment, stuff that lets you surprise
the bell out of the bastards” (the
enemy). Did he do any fighting him-
self? WerBell chuckles. “I ain't sup-'
posed to be shooting the stuff, just
demonstrating how to shoot it.”

Three years ago, WerBell’s weap-
ons business became promising
enough for him to go into it full time.
He organized a firm called Sionics

(ior Studies in Operational Negation | [oo
of Insurgency and Counter-
Subversion”), tied in with Environ-
menial Induscrics, and began in carn- {
est to devziop a line of military hard- i
ware. Sons Mitch IV and Geoff be-
came integral parts of the firm. Mitch | !

barely missed out on a Cuban foray; | § {
his father took him to Miami a few | |
years ago, but the plans fell through. | !
Under the company reorganization |
that took place in May, both of the
boys have responsible _ positions: |
Mitch 1V, now 21, is a vice-president | j
in charge of sales for Military Arma- | }
ments, the successor to. Sionics; Geoff, | |
18, is assistant director of Interna | {
tional Operations. Each of them also
attends college—Mitch IV, Georgia
State University, and Geoff, Kennc- i
saw Junior College—and they drive | ;
off to night classes after a day in the | 5
lab or on the firing range. (WerBell i
suspects one of Geoff's teachers is a | i
Communist because he has been say- !
ing some favorable things about stu- | :
dent protesters. Generally, however, |

the old man is plcascd that the boys
are getting a college education. It will
better equip them for the job of run-
_ning Military Armaments later.)

One day I sat in WerBell’s office as
Geoff displayed a number of Military
Armaments’ most unusual weapons.
(Mitch IV was in Washington, dis-
playing some of the same to Pentagon A é
officials.) Geoff brought out “the Loree

inches long, weighing two-and-one- Ree
half ounces, that fires a .22 cartridge. EOL Lan

Nothing visible suggests a gun, and
the bullet, on its way out, dislodges a
thin plug that disguises the hole at the
end of the tiny barrel. WerBell com-
mends the Stinger to secret agents
who get caught with the goods and
must take “the last resort,” that is,
shoot themselves.

In the same exotic category is the
swagger stick, bound in leather, with
silver studs. By pushing between two
studs, one can fire a .22 or, with a
special model, a small rocket. The

rocket model to blast would-be assas-
sins a few years ago. Then there is a

politician's desk. It fires, with o:
Simple finger movement, a bullet that
will quiet an unruly visitor. More tra-
ditionally military is WerBell’s “spe-
cial long-range knocker outer,” a
redesigned Remington nine-millimeter
riffle that “will plug ‘em in the cye at
200 meters.”

The bulk of WerBell’s business is
in sound suppressors and Ingram
Modcl submachine guns. Suppressors
can be used on iarge as well as smali
weapons, and in fact have been used
effectively on the wicked-looking Vul-
can machine guns mounted on Ameri-
can helicopters in Victnem. The Aus-
tralian Ariy Journal ran a story call-
ing the Sionics suppressor “superior
to anything previously uscd ....
[with it) it is now possible for the
sniper to fire from relatively shori
ranges, especially when using sub-
sonic projectiles.”

WerBell is so enthusiastic about the
Ingram Model submachine guns
(there are two models, taking differ-
ent sized cartridges) that he predicts
they will eventually make “obsolete
every individual weapon in the
world.” The U.S. Army, he says, is
now looking carefully at the Ingram
models with an eye toward making
them standa:d equipment for Ameri-
can soldiers; if that happens, the fi-
nancial success of Military Arma-
ments will presumably be assured.
According to data published by the
firm, the. Ingram models are shorter,
lighter and capable of delivering more
firepower than anything on the mar-
ket. They are also, WerBell says,
ideal for secret agents; they fit snugly
into a dispatch case (Military Arma-
ments makes the.case, too), complete
with suppressor and six magazines.

Does WerBell feel a twinge of con-
science about providing the world
with such deadly and efficient weap-
ons? No. “I see no reason to be con-
cemed,” he says. “We're supplying a
certain product that is unfortunately a
part of the civilized world. As long as
people exist, there’s going to be an
arms business. I don’t see much dif-
ference between our supplying arms
to combatants and a surgical supply
house supplying gauze to bind up the
wounds inflicted.” There is his anti-
Communist argument, too. WerBell is
fighting the Communist menace; it is
a fight that must be won and weapons
are needed to win it.

Contrary to cynical opinion,
Powder Springs was not named in
honor of WerBell and his enterprise.

WerBell, in fact, stays as aloof fron,
the local community as possible, His
house is so well-stocked, it is prac’
cally self-sufficient save tur occasional
trips to the grocery and liquor stores.
(“The only disadvantage of 1:
here,” he says, “is that you ha
drive into Fulton County to get wi
key.”) There has been, from time io
time, ami-WerBell feeling in Powder
Springs. Hildegard WerBell helps
hoid it down by reguiar attendance at
the McEachern Memorial Mcthodist
Church. As for the rest of the feel:
WerBell declares, “The hell witn it
Who cares? I tell em I’m prepared to
purchase their property if they don’t
like the area.”

WerBell also sees little of his old
advertising buddies around Atlanta.
“We just don’i have much in common
any more,” he explains, in a resound-
ing understatement. He does not suf-
fer from loneliness, however. There is
a steady stream of visitors and cus-
tomers, forcigners as well as Ameri-
cans. A few weeks ago WerBell’s
son-in-law, an Air Force lieutenant
colonel, flew in from Ohio, mainly to
see what was new around the shop; he
hadn't been by in several months, he
said, “and things change awfully
quickly around here.” The day I was
there, the colonel and WerBell
swapped ideas on ridding the State
Department of no-win policy makers
and’ on bringing the enemy to its
knees, or its grave, in Vietnam.

WerBell recalls with relish one par-
ticular visitor. He came from the State
Department a few years back, and ac-
cording to WerBell, he said, “The

functions of the foreign policies of the ~

United States are the business of the
State Department in Washington, not
of Mitchell WerBell in Powder
Springs, Georgia.” WerBell’s reply?
“You can’t print it. It was all in An-
glo-Saxon words.” But that was the
old, swashbuckling WerBell. The
new, low profile WerBell says with a
grin, “My present policy is that I
agree with that theory completely. Pe-
riod.”

Tf actions to the contrary speak too
loudly, they, like WerBell's weapons,
can always be suppressed by the man
himself. Meanwhile, Mitch and his
“independent group” march on. W
