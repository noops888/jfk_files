MEMORANDUM FOR: Assistant Deputy Director/IOS

SUBJECT

: Military Armament Corporation,

Powder Springs, Georgia; Subsidiary of

Environmental Industries, Inc.,

Washington, D. C. - alleged CIA

Involvement

1. On 3 November 1970, T. Preston HENDRICK, Washington,

D. C. District Manager, Dun and Bradstreet, Inc., (DOD Contract

an extremely valuable WFO information source, contacted

Special Agent David W. GLASS, Jr, 'by telephone and said he had a

matter which he thought, in the interest of national security, we possibly

might be interested in looking into. He briefly explained the problem

which had come to his attention from Dun & Bradstreet's Atlanta, Georgia

Office, and it was agreed that Special Agent(GLASS would meet with him

in his office the following day.

2. On 4 November 1970, Mr. HENDRICK gave Special Agent

CLAsS the attached xerox copies of an informal memo dated 20 October

1970 from D&B's Atlanta, Georgia Office, Subject: Environmental

Industries, Inc. (Exhibit 1); a D&B Business Information Report dated

9 September 1970 on Military Armament Corporation, Powder Springs,

Georgia, representing a subsidiary of Environmental Industries, Washing-

ton, D. C. (Exhibit 2); and a ten page article from the August 1970 issue

of "Atlanta"' Magazine (Exhibit 3). HENDRICK commented that this article

(Exhibit 3) has no by-line heading, and no mention of the author's name

and is written in such a manner as to imply an association between CIA

and the principal of Military Armament Corporation Mr. Mitchell L.

WERBELL 1L.

3. Mr. HENDRICK noted that the attached memorandum

from the D&B Atlanta Office (Exhibit 1) is self-explanatory, but

added that the Atlanta Office is receiving a lot of inquiries on both

of the companies. The D&B Report (Exhibit 2) is the first and only

such report yet produced by Dun & Bradstreet's Atlanta Office. The

Dun & Bradstreet Washington, D. C. Office has had no other require-

ments for information on the local company, Environmental Industries,

Inc. However, the D&B Washington Office, in response to the D&B

Atlanta Office request for information, has so far ascertained only

that Environmental Industries located at 955 L'Enfant Plaza S. W.,

-Washington, D. C. ostensibly is a one room type operation with a

telephone (554-9572) and one female employee who would not identify

herself; this person told D&B's investigator that he should not have .come

there-that everything about both firms had to come from Powder Springs,

Georgia.

4. Mr. HENDRICK said his first impression after the article

(Exhibit 3) was that the comments involving CIA "were ridiculous, pre-

posterous, and were written by a nut who is as nutty as Mitchell L.

WERBELL II seems to be"

', however, as a citizen he (HENDRICK) °3

did not want to take any chances and decided to call Special Agent David

W. GLASS. HENDRICK also thought it conceivable that fraud might

possibly be involved, but indicated that he has not mentioned this matter

to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

5. Mr. HENDRICK said that at some point he will have to

respond to Atlanta's request for information on Environmental Industries,

Inc. either by saying the Washington Office is not going to write a report

or stating an opinion that the information in the "Atlanta" Magazine article

seems completely ridiculous. Mr. HENDRICK indicated to Special Agent

0 GLASS, that if at all possible he would appreciate some guidelines - it

nothing more than sending the D&B Atlanta Office a xerox copy of the

National Security Agency Act and CIA Mission as described in the United

States Government Manual or some other public document. HENDRICK

made it clear he was passing all above information to us on a completely

informal unofficial basis and indicated he realized it is possible confirma-

tion or denial of implied CIA interest may not be possible.

vival strategy: the discovery that if you are under at-

lack from Washington's spooks, you can find an ally

in America's other invisible governnent-organized

crime-make a common front, and win.

All this would have struck the generation of the

OU's as startling news. It was news, as late as 1908,

even to people touched by the war, like Jay W. Hum:

phrey, a plumbing contractor in Melbourne, Florida.

One spring morning two men in neat dark suits drove

up. to the Humphrey house in Melbourne and handed

Jay i strange draft notice. They were friendly men

with an easy way of getting down to first names ("I'm

Bernie," "I'm Raymond, just call me Ray"), and they

had all the usual accoutrements: a basic Chevy with a

clipboard on the dash; some papers to sign; some

money in an envelope; an air ticket to Miami.

Eight weeks later Jay Humphrey, a six-foot-four,

spectacularly muscled Air Force veteran and champion

weight lifter who had flown combat in Korea, found

himself back at the controls of a heavily laden attack

bomber. Coming in on deck over the glittering Carib-

bean, roaring rooftop level past the piers of Port-au-

Prince, Humphrey banked sharply into a low-altitude

bombing run on the triple-domed presidential palace

of Doctor Duvalier.

Dead ahead, the bomber crew saw the presidential

guard's gunnery crew scramble wildly for the four-

harreled Oerlikon ack-ack cannon mounted on the

palace roof, but Humphrey felt only elation. He had

a passion for flying and for adventure. In a way, he

secretly offered funds and facilities by a

on such a scale. A good deal of its de-

signing and manufacturing is done

under federal license. Silencers. for

example, are outlawed by the Na-

tional

Firearms Act,

gangland wars.

To manufacture his

suppressors, WerBell must pay a spe-

cial tar of $500 a year, collected by

the U.S. Treasury Department. The

T-men also check periodically to see

that his awesome collection of fire-

arms—over 200 individual pieces-is

properly registered. Apparently the

market for suppressors is not very

large, because according to WerBell,

his firm is the only one authorized to

manufacture them.

WerBell will not discuss the sales

or profits of Military Armaments ex-

cept to say that, after two years of ex-

tensive research and development (re-

sulting in "a tax loss of a half million

dollars"), the company is now doing

very well. It has about 12 employees,

including four machinists who work

under the direction of Gordog/In-

grayathe mustached, sport sinfi

wearing vice-president of Engineering

who has charge of the design opera-

tion. Ingram's name is on the Model

11 submachine gun that young Mitch

demonstrated for me on the firing

range. Ingram works in a well-

equipped machine shop-lab attached

to the main house on the estate, which

WerBell likes to call "the farm."

WerBell's office is next door to the

shop. Its walls are so loaded with

weapons, it is a-wonder they do nor

collapse. There are knives and spear

guns and pistols and rifles and ma-

chine guns, dozens and dozens oi

them, some purchased, some won in

combat, some presented by the appre-

ciative recipients of WerBell's

counter-insurgency techniques.

WerBell,

who has a sense of

humor, calls his enterprise a "cottage

industry" and likens himself to "a

country doctor. . . . I can fall out of

the living area upstairs right down to

the office." Upstairs is the domain of

his German-born wife Hildegard, a

pleasant, gray-haired woman who has

borne WerBell six children and put

up with his rather unusual way of life.

1968, he said he'd be gone for a year

comparison he definitely would not

find flattering. No matter. Both mus-

tache and inonocle are gone now, lost

to his effort to promote a "lower pro-

file" for himself.) He often dresses

around the office in military clothing

of indeterminate origin, and he en-

bellishes the image by talking in

slightly clipped sentences peppered

with military phrases. There is noth-

ing phony in this. WerBell has a

strong attachment to weapons and to

warfare, and he has been around

them so long that the ideas and styles

they foster are an ingrained part of

his personality.

He comes by both his militarism

and his anti-Communism honestly.

His father was an officer in the Rus-

sian Imperial army, even though ne

was born in the United States. "It was

a tricky situation," says Mitch. "He

was a citizen of both the U.S. and

Russia. In those days you could do

that." The elder WerBell fought

against the Bolsheviks, but before the'

collapse of the czarist regime he

wisely secured an appointment as liai-

son officer between the Russian and

American

forces-stationed in the

U.S. He lived in this country for the

rest of his life, putting his early medi-

cal training to use in cancer research

while living the good life. "My father

was a man of means," Mitch says. "He

traveled a lot, did a lot of big game

hunting, things like that."

Father came by that honestly too.

For generations, the WerBells have

been men of means. Mitch traces the

family to 13th-century France, where

the name was spelled "Vertbelle." At

least one branch of the family emi-

grated to Russia, where the French

name became Russianized, with the

final "e" dropped

and the "

changed to "W." It is impossible to

know just how strongly Mitch was in-(5

the boishcairs, but certainly the influ-

. ence

was considerable;

the White

Russiars and thoir descendants have

long been among the uncompromising

anti-Communists.

Another legacy fron father is

Mitch's barcly disguised aristocratic

sympathies. He has been quoted as

saying, "Communism is a substitution

of a peasant dictatorship over the ar-

istocraryl prefer the aristocracy.

He scoffs at such statements as "I kid

about being a constitutional monarch-

ist, bui only if I'm the monarch", yet

ic is without question an clitist. Nol

surprisingly, his elite is comprised of

superpatriois and military men, who

would be given powerful roles in any

nation's affairs.

Mitchell MerBell was born in

Pennsylvania, shortly after his Rus-

sian-American father and his

Scottish-bern mother arrived in the

U.S. at the end of World War I. His

parents traveled a good deal, here and

abroad, and Mitch traveled

with

them, picking up his education as he

went. He got a degree in journalism

from the University of Pennsylvania

in World War II, he joined the OSS, a

sort of Cloal-and-dagger Green Beret

operation. He served with an OSS

unit behind Japanese lines in China,

rising to the rank of captain and at-

quiring a taste for guerilla-type war-

fare he would never lose.

WerBell came to Atlanta shortly

after the war and went to work for

Rich's advertising department. It was

a small department in those days, and

WerBell proved himself a capable ad

man. Soon he was head of the depart-

ment, and soon after that he went on

his own. He formed Mitchell WerBell

Advertising, which later became

WerBell, Seklemian and North. Vet-

eran Atlanta advertising men recall

WerBell as being aggressive and im-

aginative, a good addition to the busi-

ness. "He did some first-rate work,"

says one, "and he handled some big

accounts, Barwick Mills, for in-

stance."

In the mid-fifties, WerBell pulled

out of his agency (there are dark sto-

ries about how he was done in by as-

sociates), and the agency collapsed

not long afterward. He then formed

his own

public relations firm, and

here the story line gets fuzzy-be-

cause it begins to involve interna-

tional military intrigue. "T'd already

Europe, and I moved into the Far

East, too." How much of this moving

in was military, WerBell won't say,

but his business look on more and

more of what he calls a "geopolitical"

flavor. Before long, he was dabbling

in Latin American dictatorships. "Be-

fore Fidel look over in Cuba, we w'cre

working closely with Batista." He

adds with a grin, "Our function was

is hip Batisin in power, although the

U.S. government was looking favora-

bly on Fidel at that point."

From all this, even WerBell doesn't

know exactly how, came a passionate

concern about Communism. "I de-

cided to devote whatever time I could

to anti-Communist activities,"

he

says. "At first it was sort of a hobby,

but shen it became my main drive in

life. What I'm doing now"—here he

gestures at the arsenal of his office

walls-"affords me a damned good

living. But the living is not why I do

it"

In 1948, while anti-Communismi

was still a hobby, albeit a paying

hobby, WerBell purchased the Dobbs

estate. He installed rudimentary de-

sign facilities and began experiment-

ing

with

weapons

of

counter-

insurgency, weapons he believed had

the best chance of preventing Coni-

munist takeovers in the small, under-

devcloped nations of Asia and Latin

America. "I realized that in counter-

insurgency, the primary problem was

a lack of depth in weaponry. People

say, Win the hearts of the enemy,

and you'll win the fight.' That's a lot

of bull. The best way to get their

hearts, if they're the enemy, is to

shoot 'em and cut the hearts out."

While he experimented with weap

ons quietly, to avoid problems with

the federals WerBell proceeded with

his personal brand of geopolitics. He

made himself

available to anti-

Communist regimes that wanted help

in fighting off one band of insurgents

or another. In the process, he became

friendly

with

a number of Latin

America's political strongmen. They

were delighted to discover a norie-

americano who felt as they did about

the need for stable, anti-Communist

regimes, especially their regimes, and

who had both the savy and the guts

to help preserve them. WerBell, oper-

ating out of Powder Springs, lashioned

a nice little career for himself as a

paramilitary adviser. He seldom

passed an opportunity to plug the

weapons he was developing back

He was, of course, on the side of the

govermnent, which was fending off al-

legedly Communist insurgents; the

WciBell was already active in the

anti-Castro

movement,

and

he

brought to it a sense of dash and dis-

cipline that the raglag,

bickering

bunch of Cuban exiles had seldom

seen. Perhaps his major anti-Castro

exploit was a spcedboat foray into

Camarioca, on Cuba's southern coast.

The mission was to drop a swimmer,

apparently i spy, offshore, and to

pick up the family of an exile leader.

The boat, flying the Confederate flag

on the radio antenna, foundered in

high seas, and the raiding party was

captured. The Cubans, the story goes,

did not know what to make of the

brash WerBell, and he and his pals

wound up stealing a Castro boat and

spiriting some 16 anti-Castroites out

of the country before they themselves

returned to the U.S.

In the late '60s, WerBell turned his

attention to Southeast Asia. He is, of

course, a superhawk on Vietnam, and

would be happy if the U.S. were also

fighting Communism in all its neigh-

boring countries. He was in Thailand

"working closely with the Supreme

Command," for months, promoting

the sales of his weapons and systems.

"I showed them things like surveil-

lance equipment and night vision

equipment, stuff that lets you surprise

the bell out of the bastards" (the

enemy). Did he do any fighting him-

self? WerBell chuckles.

"I ain't sup

demonstrating how to shoot it."

the bullet, on its way out, dislodges a
