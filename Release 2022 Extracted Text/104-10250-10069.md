MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Security

SUBJECT : KIMSEY, Herman Edward
#71 129

1. As you are aware, the Office of Security file of
Herman Edward KIMSEY contains an envelope, the contents of
which show the receipt by KIMSEY of $380,000 cash from
Colonel Sheffield Edwards on 22 May 1961, which was appar-
ently sent to Headquarters from the Khartoum Station. The
envelope also contains a receipt for $1,800, the serial ~
numbers of which are recorded. The file does not contain
an explanation for the transfer of these funds to KIMSEY.

2. After discussions with Mr. David CROWN, TSD Ques-
tioned Documents Laboratory--the assignment of KIMSEY as of
22 May 1961--on 1 December 1975 Mr. CROWN delivered to the
writer the attached copies of documents from TSD/QDL files,
which satisfactorily explain the transfer of the funds to
KIMSEY for examination and the subsequent transfer of the
money to C.V.S. ROOSEVELT on 23 August 1961.
