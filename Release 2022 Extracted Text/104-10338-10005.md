Ament Papich advised McCone that ie had a piece of business —
which needed ironing out before the end of the year, The Agent ex-
plained that since the assassiration o? rresident Kennedy, there
been various types of stories circuisted concerning the case
the evicence collected; that some of these stories could immedi- t
ve discounted; and that there was certain information received
he Bureau which very directly affected relations between the
~ureau and CIA.. The Agent stated that certain information had weet :

euca proportion to be most alarming and that the Agent had requested
crmission from Mr. Hoover to discuss the matter with the CIA Directo:

. UcCone .was then told that he was charged with being the
source of information conveyed to a high Government official and to
4}. Drew Pearson in that he, McCone, had stated that CIA had uncovered
a plot in Mexico City indicating that Lee Harvey Oswald had receivec
i $6,500 to assassinate President Kennedy. The Agent elaborated by

stating that if this were true, McCone had endeavored to leave the :

impression with certain people that CIA had developed information not

‘known to the Bureau and, in essence, made the Bureau look ridiculous.

She Agent advised that if McCone had made such statements, we could

+ ;only assume that he was ‘employing vicious and underhanded tactics

; |p since he and officials of his agency fully well knew that the story

{ I}concerning the $6,500 had been proved to be absolutely false. HcCone's
attention was directed to the Alvarado interrogation, Alvarado's

NcCone was very visibly incensed and left the impression
that he might at any moment ask the Agent to leave. After pausing
a few moments, he made the following statements:

(1) He stated that he has never talked to D; on
is life; that he has never sent any kind of message to
Peazsen ¢ directly. or r_Andixectiz and that he does not have any
communicating with Pearson. He briefly referred
aa the fact that he has been the target of attacks by Pearson,
one of these occurring within the last two weeks. (5)

(2) With regard to the "$6,500 story," McCone advised
that as soon as the original report was received from his
people in Mexico City, he contacted President Johnson and
informed him of the development. He explained to the Presi-
dent that this was a matter which required intensive interro-
gation of Alvarado and that CIA had coordinated very closely

} Feet the FBI. ..He told the President that Alvarado would be
kept in a safe house by CIA until the FBI was satisfied that
all necessary investigative action had taken place. &)

(3) KeCone advised that he has not been critical of the
Bureau; that if he had any criticism he would confer directly
with the Bureau and not get inYolved in malicious gossip. ke
commented that in connection with the Oswald case, he has
encountered people who have been critical of the Bureau dnd
the Secret Service and he, McCone, has gone to the defense

FROM: Barry Harrelson, Senior Reviewer
- ‘Historical Review Group
Center for the Study of Intelligence
Central Intelligence Agency

SUBJECT: Authenticity of Document

1. This is in response to your request to this office
to review the attached document and advise if it is a valid
Agency document or something made up using an Agency reports
format and information either entirely made up or from other
sources. The 3 August 1962 document purports to tie Dorothy
Kilgallen, Marilyn Monroe and former Attorney General,
Robert Kennedy, together with knowledge of an number of
matters, including the plot to kill Castro.

2. Those Agency officers who have reviewed the
document consider it to be fraiulent. While the format
resembles a “reports” form used in the 1960's, the
substantive information and presentation is foreign to
normal presentaion or collection efforts. Also, the control
stamps and other administrative items are not typical of CIA
reports written during the 1960's.

3. If you have any further questions in this regard,
please call me directly at (703) 351-2909.
