Wife: Mirtha Novoa Delgado do Cubela

Subject is separated fron his wife, whom he felt obligated to marry.

It is assumed that she became pregnant prior to this marriage.

They have one child, reportedly a girl, now (1963) about three.

Cubela reportedly likes and admireshis wife, and is concerned for

her welfare and happiness, although he does not love her in a

husband-wife sense, according to a statement Tepedino made to

Wainwright in 1962.

During the summer meetings in Europe in 1962,

Cubela told Mainwright that he could not go back to her if he

wanted to because she had been too outspoken in her dislike for the

Castro regime.

He also mentioned (cont'd on next page):

Pan American stewardess of French descent based in Miani (at least

1n 1962). Cubela wanted her to go t) Europe while he was there in

1962.

Cubela appears to have known her for some time, since

Tepedino reported that the stewardess had nade some comment to

Cubela concerning Cubela's political frame of mind in 1961 which

made Cubela (or Tepedino) think that she was working for us in some

One report from Army Intelligence on 9 June 1961 called

her Sonia Calero de Cubela (which would make her appear to be

Cubela's wife.

This is an obvious error, view above.

and of her desire to get out of Cuba.

This commentias based on

the supposition that Cubela would be working for us in Cuba on

his return, and was made to Tepedino-Hainwright during the

1962 meetings in Europe.

Wainwright expressed the belief that

"we" (possibly he was including Tepedino in his comment) do sot

think that Cubela does want to go back to his wife.

There has

also been

the comment that some of Cubela's "guilt" feelings come

from the necessity of resolving the probles of this separation.

Note:

since he still likes and admires her, he may be more

cautious while worsing against the regime while she, their child,

and his Mother remain in Cuba. Ed note.)
