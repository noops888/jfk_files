MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Res of Meetings with(MBTROIKA-7 in
a lew York City on 14 February and. in Virginia on
17-18 ets 1972 :

1. This memorandum covers recent meetings with
[MPTROIKA-7 in New York City and in the Northern Virginia
area. The meetings were héld under secure conditions and
there were no security incidents noted.

2. Operational:

"s persistent efforts to locate
join a pro-Mao study group finally paid off. The manager
of the China Bookstore finally broke down under M-7's
campaign and put her in touch with a local USCFA study

fea under the leadership of Mrs. Susan Warren, aka Frank.
M~)

has attended one session and, based.on her initial
observation, provided the assessment of Mrs. Warren attached
hereto at the undersigned's request. {M7 believes she has
hit it off with Mrs. Warren because of her understanding
of dialectics (thanks to Andy Ness's tutoring) and, consequently,
she was instructed to attempt to develop a social-business
relationship with her. With respect to the other members
of the study group, (M7 claims that the situation, to date,

has not been conducive to ferreting: out the identities of ae

these individuals, but. that she hopes that as the group -
continues to meet, Some Tapport will be established with her
classmates. :

b. New School and language instruction: (M-/7
has formally enrolied at the Graduate Faculty of the New
School for Social Research in a course entitled “Comparative
Legal Systems," which studies the theories, institutions,
concepts, Customs and which purports to analyze and compare
the law and the administration of law in selected countries,
included China, Japan, Vietnam, Germany, the U.S. and the
Soviet Union. {N37 will also enroll in a French language
instruction course in the near future.

: c. Ramparts' Tours - New York Media Workshop's
Womens' Tour: “Acting on a suggestion proposed by Mr. Tason
Horn, CI/S0, the undersigned raised the subject of the Women's
Tour which is scheduled to visit London, Paris (where they
will meet the DRV peace delegation) and Rome from 27 May -
25 June 1972 with dey and instructed her to attempt to determine. :
the interest in, and likely composition of, the New York ‘ y
group and explore tke possibility of joining such a group ~
and explore the possibility of joining such a group. (37's
first reaction tothe tour was that the cost ($699, which
7 price includes airfare, trains, hotels, etc.) was too high.
It was explained to her that the cost factor should t
» deter her from following through. It was then that {M-/7
voiced some concern that the timing of the tour may interfere
rs with her own PCS departure (we had been talking in terms of
“mid-May or June 1972 up to this point). It was made clear
to her that no fixed date has been established as yet for
her PCS departure and that the aforementioned tour may well
, bee prove to be.of operational interest, e.g. meeting the DRV
-. delegation and continuing the staging process prior to her
actual departure. (M77 said that she understood and would
look into the matter. She did not believe she would have
any difficulty in covering for funds should she find herself
included on the tour. i 5 ae

had incurred in enrolling at the New School and to pay for
her French lessons. (One of the reasons (M57 was brought down

‘17 February 1972 aoe tod
SUBJECT: Mrs. Susan Warren aka Susan Frank : i a

Susan is a tough cookie. One of her most outstanding
features is a complete lack of interest - in anyone but her-
self. When. leading, a. China study class this is her method:
. first she asks a question, from her notes, such as "What

do you think Mao meant when he sdid this.:." Then she

cldamly listens to what the class thinks Mao menat. When i

everyone finishes Susan begins to tell exactly what he a

meant to say. Through the evening her attitude remains z
sot the same "I've been here before and said this before." a

There is no enthusiasm in her that I couid see. :

Susan is an expert on China. I know because she told
me. She told everyone else too within the first eight
minutes of class. “Well, I spoke to those soldiers in
Yunan who fired on those "peasants..." But she really didn't
have to advertize her knowledge because it is very apparent.
She has a solid understanding of Chinese political line and
can smoothly defend Chinese history. :

’ As far as the woman herself is concerned she has
not as much money as she would like. I believe she wants
to dress in 'style.' Now, although dressing conservatively
she still developes an eye for color and she would clearly ~~
be receptive to intelligent male attention. She has a
7 > figure and is aware of it.

Perhaps the clue which best typifies Susan‘ s personality
. ‘is her voice... It is deep, slow, even and artificially
: cultured. For example, "r's" Loans "da" in "veddy" or
] : “Amedica". : : : 2

-Her hand movements when she ‘speaks are measured and
7 deliberate. While listening she fidgits a little but not
~~: much. ee

ay

Two noticible features are her thumbnails. Both. are
filed almost to points, are very thick and yellowish-
moreso than other nails. a E

While she is concerned with herself I believe she
would follow someone who either interested her or gently


led her. There is a part of her normally conservative
- character that would like to break away and try new things
oaaa not new ideas in politics.) :

“One last remark, she is.a straightforward person;
will look you in the eye, will tell someone not to speak
too anes if she wants to move on to something else.

These observations were made after one meeting in
a study class and for a few minutes before ace
