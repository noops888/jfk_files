(ace ls The fotloving is the text of a cable fron cnter, SR Division, sent
via closed channel from Frankfurt at 2316Z on 23 November, for the attention
of Mr. Angleton: 2

“lL. I desire that you consider these reactions tothe Kennedy
assassination:

a. Within minutes of the first news, Moscow radio statements
as heard in London attributed the assassination to "right-
wing elements." Only as the true identity of the believed
assassin became known did Moscow begin to complain that
U.S. reactionaries were using Oswald as a pawn.

b. Should not the assignment of 13th Dept. officers to the KGB
residency in the United Nations in New York be considered
in a new light?

ce. I discovered from Arthur Martin (of MI-5)] uring our long
- and exceptionally valuable discussions, tt one of Harold
Wilson's principal scientific advisors is Captain Ian Maxwell,
who has @ long Soviet intelligence background. This may
shed new light on AELADIE's report /I.e., that Harold Wilson
may be a Soviet agent7.

2. Putting it baldly, was Oswald, unwittingly or wittingly, part of

@ plot to murder President Kennedy in Dallas as an attempt to

further exacerbate sectional strife and render the U.S. Government

less capable of dealing with Soviet initiatives over the next

: year? If AELADLE's views on Wilson and the information noted in

ate paragraph le above have any substance (and they cannot be ignored),
By this suggests that we can expect major Soviet pressures over the
next several months, for which the Soviets have made careful,
long-range preparations."

2. The above reference to 13th Dept. officers in New York refers tothe
presence, reported by ean FBI penetration of the KGB locally, in New York or
Washington of one or two known officers of the 13th Department of the 1st Chie?
Directorate (Foreign Intelligence) of the KGB. ‘This department is charged with
"liquid affairs," sabotage and assassination. One of the 13th

by the wey met clandestinely with a Soviet "exchange student" from a
Pennsylvania university during the school year 1962-63, which suggests that
the Soviet student is also a 13th Dept. officer or agent. . Perhaps
significantly, his course of studies was in food chemistry!

3. You will note thet Mr. Murphy's comments e without. benefit of

“the traces we passed to. you earlier today, showing ‘that bees had contact

with a 13th Dept. representative in Mexico City.

4, Another recently-arrived cable, being sent to the Director “tontght,
suggests that Oswald's business with the Soviet Consul was connected with his
own vise to the USSR and Cuba (in transit) and my, therefore, have been .
really rather than ostensibly innocent.
