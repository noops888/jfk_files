On January 7, 1958, NO T-3 advised that JOSEPH

of the Nola Printing Company. T-3 believed that PORETTO

actually has some financial interest in Nola, but it is

general knowledge in gambling circles that the company itself

is owned by CARLOS MARCELLO. At the time of the interview

with T-3, the informant said that the wire service provided

by Nola costs $60.00 a week for individual books and $108.00

a week for bookmakers who operated business places.

The informant stated that in the middle 30's,

PORETTO lived in Houston,

Texas where he operated as a

gambler. He got in trouble with the Texas Rangers and was

ordered out of the state. PORETTO returned to New Orleans

and began associating with JOHN. J. FOGERTY, who then operated a

horse race wire service in New Orleans.

Informant said

MARCELLO moved in on FOGERTY and took over the wire service,

whereupon PORETTO associated himself with MARCELLO.

On December 17, 1957, NO T-4 advised that it is the

general opinion among bookmakers in Jefferson Parish that

Nola is controlled by CARLOS MARCELLO and that the operations

are managed by JOSEPH ALBERT PORETTO and MARCELLO's youngest

brother, JOSEPH MARCELLO, JR.

on January 3. 1958. NO T-S advised that

backing of CARLOS MARCELLO.
