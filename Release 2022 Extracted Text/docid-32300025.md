A search of this aircraft reflected that there were 135
rifles and guns located on the aircraft. Subsequent
investigation revealed that 121 of these weapons had been
stolen from the National Guard Armory in Canton, Ohio.

As a result of the seizure of these weapons, in igation
resulted in a conspiracy case being presented against
SUTOR, NORMAN ROTHMAN, and others. Upon his arrest, SUTOR
reported that the aircraft he was piloting had been rented
from DuPont Air Interest, Miami, Florida. : :

Further investigation fo this matter revealed
that righiecr 1958, J and_SAIMMETARUSSO_had contacted a

LEONARDYRICCI, a license aurearm dealer, and told hi
a contact nae @lorida who wanted all the United

they hal
States Army type rifles he could get. In October 1958,
ROTHMAN, who was described as a well known gambler formerly

of New Kensington, Pennsylvania, and who allegedly represented

the Ma no Gambling Interest in Cuba, contacted a Doctor
LEWIS C ESSOLANO’ in Miani Springs, Florida, ROTHMAN was

reported{to havé ked PESSOLANO to purchase an airplane for
the purpose of going north to pick up a load of firearms

and to.obtain the services of a pilot who could be trusted
for the flight. A short later, PESSOLANO contacted be
STUART SUTOR and made arrangements for SUTOR to pilot, this
plane. SUTOR was subsequently introduced to JOSEPH, MEROLA

at Miami, Florida, who with SUTOR left for.Pennsylvania

to pick up the weapons. On October 26, 1958, SUTOR and

MEROLA landed their plane at-the Alleghany Valley Airport.
near New Kensington, Pennsylvania, where -they were met by
three inen who arrived at the field in a 1958 Oldsmobile -
and panel truck with the name S and S Distributing Company
written on the side. The stolen weapons were apparently
transferred to SUTOR's plane at that time.

‘ This letter further reflects that GABRIEL and
sudfrarniantio, who were listed as co-conspirators in this
matter, were the owners of the S and S Distributing Company

and that their truck was used to transport the stolen weapons.
MANNARINO was reported to have made a telephone call to ~~
PESSOLANO a short time later and inquired if SUTOR would

keep -his mouth-shut in reference to the law enforcement
officers. ROTHMAN was reported to have described SAM
MANNARINO as. a "very dear friend."

HACKER said. he listened to the proposition only
to ascertain the extent of ROTHMAN's interest in muscling
in on the Hotel Workers Union.. He said he then presented
this proposition to JACK WEINBURGER, formerly Organizational -
Secretary, now General Secretary of the Union, WEINBURGER,
stated that this must be discussed with ED MILLER, who
agreed: with the proposal, except the appointment of ROTHMAN
as International Representative. MILLER indicated he would :
get around this somehow. In December, 1954, HACKER was — - fea
telephonically contacted by ED MILLER and instructed. to tnmn
over the affairs of Local 255 to. one ALBERT BERLIN, a former
associate of the gangster element. This appointment in
HACKER's opinion indicated ROTHMAN had gotten to MILLER,
apparently through ROGER LEBENNER, Business Agent. for Local 7
133 of the Hotel Workers Union, and. that MILLER was working . iy
with ROTHMAN. HACKER stated he could never work with |
MILLER and resigned on December 13, 1954. HACKER stated jen
that in April, 1955, the first hotel in Miami Beach was :
struck by the Hotel Workers Union, and the strike which :
presently involves 22 hotels is still going on. The Hotel '
Workers Union is pouring $120,000 a month into this strike.
He can only conclude the hotel operators did not accede to
ROTHMAN's shakedown. He is convinced, however, that ROTHMAN *
made the attempt, and that MILLER is cooperating with him,

On July. 30, 1956, AL MANHEIM advised that ABE !
GOODMAN was in the bolita business in Cuba with ELI QUAIN.
and NORMAN ROTHMAN, .

On July 30, 1956, NORMAN ROTHMAN, Chicago, -
Illinois, shipped 32,800 pounds of gambling equipment
to NORMAN ROTHMAN, Miami, Florida. The equipment arrived
in Miami, Florida, on August-3, 1956, and was located at
Tamiami Tours, Inc., Transport Capany. The U. S. Attorney,
Miami, Florida, authorized the seizure of this equipment; .:
and the equipment was seized on August 6, 1956, and turned «*
over to the US Marshal on August 7, 1956, Prosecution of
ROTHMAN was declined by the US Attorney's Office, Miami,
Florida, and the gambling equipment was destroyed.
