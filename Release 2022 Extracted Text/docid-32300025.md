HACKER said he listened to the proposition only

to ascertain the extent of ROTHMAN's interest in muscling

in on the Hotel Workers Union.. He said he then presented

this proposition to JACK WEINBURGER,

formerly Organizational

Secretary, now General Secretary of the Union.

WE INBURGER

stated that this must be discussed with ED MILLER, who

agreed with the proposal, except the appointment of ROTHMAN

MILLER indicated he would

In December, 1954, HACKER was

telephonically contacted by ED MILLER and instructed to tunn

over, the affairs of Local 255 to one ALBERT BERLIN, a former

associate of the gangster element. This appointment in

HACKER's opinion indicated ROTHMAN had gotten to MILLER,

apparently through ROGER LEBENNER, Business Agent for Local

133 of the Hotel Workers Union, and that MILLER was working

with ROTHMAN. HACKER stated he could never work with

MILLER and resigned on December 13, 1954. HACKER stated

that in April, 1955, the first hotel in Miami Beach was

struck by the Hotel

Workers Union, and the strike which

presently involves 22 hotels is still going on.

The Hotel

Workers Union is pouring $120,000 a month into

this strike.

He can only conclude the hotel operators did not accede to

ROTHMAN's shakedown.

He is convinced, however, that ROTHMAN *

made the attempt, and that MILLER is cooperating with him.

On July 30, 1956, AL MANHEIM advised that ABE

GOODMAN was in the bolita business in Cuba with ELI QUAIN

and NORMAN ROTHMAN.

On July 30, 1956, NORMAN ROTHMAN, Chicago,

The equipment arrived

in Miami, Florida, on August 3, 1956, and was located at

Tamiami

Tours, Inc., Transport Company.

The U. S. Attorney,

Miami, Florida, authorized the seizure of this equipment;

and the equipment was

seized on August 6, 1956, and turned

over to the US Marshal on August 7, 1956. Prosecution of

ROTHMAN was declined by the US Attorney's Office, Miami,

Florida, and the gambling equipment was destroyed.
