The Attorney General

NOTE:

By memorandum from Mr. W. R. Wannall to Mr. J. B. Adams,

dated 10/16/75, captioned as above, approval was obtained for transmittal

of a preliminary response, dated 10/17/75, to Congressman Pike's request

for FBI views on the future of the intelligence community. In our preliminary

response, we indicated that our views would be furnished at an early date

following consultation with appropriate FBI personnel.

Since transmittal of our 10/17/75 preliminary response, we have

learned that the heads of other member-agencies of the intelligence community

have received a similar request from the Congressman. In addition, we have

been informed that the Attorney General has met with White House officials

and determined that it would not be appropriate for us to make specific

recommendations in response to the Congressman's letter. The communication

to Congressman Pike attached for the Attorney General's approval sets forth

general observations on the future of the intelligence community and is

responsive both to the Congressman's inquiry and to the Attorney General's

determination that our reply should avoid specific recommendations.

At 10:47 a.m. on January 5, 1976, Joseph Leo Gormley,

formerly employed in the FBI Laboratory, advised that he retired June 30,

1973, and currently is employed at IACP, telephone number 948-0922, Ext. 248.

Mr. Gormley said that he was contacted by Richard Vermeire

J of the House Intelligence Committee who requested him to be available for an

interview this afternoon concerning FBI purchases from the U.S. Recording

Company. He told me that he had no personal knowledge of such purchases

and he requested advice from the Bureau as to his response to Vermeire.

I told Mr. Gormley that he should consider himself relieved of

the obligation of any secrecy agreement he may have signed with the FBI

for purposes of the interview with Vermeire concerning the subject matter

indicated. I told him that should the interview concern other matters, he

should be aware that he is not being relieved of the obligation to protect the

identities of confidential informants, not interfere with pending investigations,

not disclose information obtained from third party sources, and not disclose

sensitive investigative techniques. I also told Mr. Gormley that should the

proposed interview appear to require the advice of counsel to assist him, such

could be made available upon his request. He indicated that because he has

no personal knowledge of the U.S. Recording Company or the Bureau's

purchasing practices, he felt that he had no need to request counsel at this

time.

By letter dated 10/20/75, received at the Bureau Q

11/4/75 (copy attached), the House Select Committee (HSC)

requested that it be furnished with copies of all materials

contained in FBI files pertaining to the shooting of

Kenyon F. Ballew in Silver Spring, Maryland, on 6/7/71.

This shooting occurred when representatives of the Alcohol,

Tobacco and Firearms Division and local police officers

broke into the Ballew apartment with a warrant charging

Ballew with unregistered possession of firearms and explosives.

As a result of the incident, Ballew was wounded and suffered

a crippling injury. He filed suit against the Government

and the Civil Rights Division of the Department requested

this Bureau to conduct what amounted to a minimal amount of

investigation in this matter.

On 11/12/75, Special Agent (SA) Thomas J. McNiff,

after a conference with SAs Paul V. Daly, Legal Counsel

Division, and John J. Boyd, General Investigative Division,

discussed the propriety of the above request with Steven

Blackhurst, Deputy Special Counsel for Intelligence Coordination,

Department of Justice, as the request did not appear to fall

within the HSC mandate as outlined in HI. R. 591. Blackhurs

concurred with the above observation and stated he would

inquire of the HSC as to the purpose of their inquiry.

On 11/14/75, Blackhurst advised he had been informed

Bureau files contained any information supporting that

allegation.

On 11/17/75, Blackhurst was advised that a review

of Bureau files was negative concerning the above inquiry.

Blackhurst then stated he would determine whether additional

action need be taken by this Bureau in response to HSC

letter dated 10/20/75.

On 12/16/75, Blackhurst advised he had ascertained

from the HSC that this Bureau can disregard the request

contained in above HSC letter.

By memorandum dated 12/19/75. to the Attorney General, we

advised the Department of Justice that we were opposed to furnishing

captioned Committee information concerning proprietaries in response

to their letter of 12/1/75, since they are on-going Bureau operations.

We further advised the Department that we had afforded the "Committee

a briefing concerning these operations in as detailed a mariner as

possible without compromising the operations.

On 12/30/75 at the request of Rex Lee, Assistant Attorney

General of the Civil Division of the Department; Deputy Assistant

Director Fred Fehl; SA John McHale; Section Chief William O: Cregar;

and SA Paul V. Daly met with Mr. Lee, his assistant Thomas Martin

and Assistant Special Counsel for Intelligence Coordination Steven/\

Blackhurst concerning the captioned Committee's request for infor

mation pertaining to proprietaries.

It was brought to Mr. Lee's attention at that time of

the Bureau's concern

relative to the disclosure of the requested

information to captioned Committee and of the Bureau's position

that the information requested should not be furnished. It was

pointed out to Mr. Lee that such disclosure might adversely impact

on the on-going sensitive operations of the Bureau and create un-

necessary risks to the physical well-being of Bureau Agents and

informants and with regard to the proprietaries operating in the

criminal field;

jeopardize prosecutions.

Mr. Lee explained that he was sympathitic to the Bureau's

position; however, Mike Duval at the White House had instructed

him to attempt to reach some accommodation concerning this request.

According to Mr. Lee, this was prompted by a concern at the White

House that the House Select Committee might not abide by their

agreement with the President concerning the publication by that

Committee of material in their possession of a sensitive nature.

The aforementioned

agreement allows for the President to certify

the necessity that

a particular document or particular information

not

be published and the Committee would abide by that certification.

The Committee, in conversations with representatives at the White

House, had cited two areas where Executive Branch responses nad not

acceptable one of which was the Bureau's response concerning

proprietaries.

Mr. Lee concluded the meeting by indicating he would

contact a representative of the House Select Committee and attempt

to extract an agreement as to the matter and type of information

which would be given to that Committee without giving to the Com-

mittee information with which they might be able to identify the

proprietary in question.

He stated that if this was not acceptable

with the Committee, he would at that point refuse the Committee's

request.

On 12/31/75, Thomas Martin telephonically advised SA

Paul V. Daly of this Division that Mr. Lee had contacted Aaron

Donner and that Donner appreciated the Bureau's concerns relative

to furnishing information on the proprietaries.

Donner also in-

dicated that they would seek to keep such information from

Committee members.

Martin stated that Mr. Lee agreed to furnish

the Committee a financial balance sheet showing income, assets,

and liabilities (the balance sheet should go back no more than

five years

and if the original balance sheets would disclose the

operation in question, a

sanitized balance sheet would be prepared);

the original amount of money used to create the proprietary and the

source of same; and evidence of compliance with state and/or Federal

laws.

With regard to the latter, if the information concerning

be made concerning this material. He was asked whether the Committe€

was seeking access or delivery of the material in question. It

was pointed out to Martin that the Committee indicated access

might be sufficient for the Committee's needs.

• Martin stated he

would check on this particular question and advise the Bureau of

the answer.

Martin subsequently advised that the Bureau should

provide access to but not delivery of the material.

Additionally, Martin statea

explained to Martin that It may not be possible to gather and

furnish the information requested by that time.

RECOMMENDATION:

That the Intelligence Division with input from the

Special Investigative Division gather the necessary information

to prepare the appropriate response for the House Select Committee.

ADDENDUM BY SPECIAL INVESTIGATIVE DIVISION: 1/2/76 FCF :dI

The Special Investigative Division is of the definite opinion

the following points should be enumerated and brought to the attention

of the Director:

At the meeting which was held in the office of Assistant

Attorney General Rex Lee on the morning of December 30, 1975, Lee

commenced by advising that he would attempt to explain his complete

lack of knowledge of the situation. Deputy Assistant Director Fehl

then inquired of Lee as to whether or not he had reviewed the Director's

letter to the Attorney General dated December 19, 1975, captioned

"United States House Select Committee on Intelligence Activities," and

Lee said he had not seen the letter. In brief, the Bureau's position

in the letter of December 19, 1975, very Clearly stated to the Attorney

General that we have again reviewed this particular matter and feel that

a disclosure of information concerning an on-going Bureau operation

is not appropriate. We told the Attorney General we stood ready to,

of course, furnish information pertinent to discontinued proprietary

operations which would offer the Committee a chance to see the procedures

used by the Bureau in establishing and maintaining such operations. The

Attorney General was also advised that the Committee was afforded a

briefing concerning these operations in as detailed a manner as possible.

Several months ago, Peter Hughes, a staff member of the

Committee, was apprised in most general terms concerning the Bureau's

proprietaries (organized crime matters) at which time Hughes advised

that he was completely satisfied and had no further questions. Hughes

exhibited surprise at the nominal amount of dollars the FBI had expended

as compared to CIA operations.

The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities

requested information concerning on-going Bureau operations and was

advised this data would not be furnished. Church's committee made

no further demands on the Bureau.

At the conterence on December 30, 1975, Lee was advised

we did not feel that the matters being handled by the Special Investigative

Division were within the contines of the charter of the House Committee.

He was told that we were not gathering "intelligence" but rather we were

conducting criminal investigations looking toward prosecutive action in

U. S. District Courts. He said he understood and also said he would

review the charter.

There is no indication in this memorandum that Lee

has in fact reviewed the charter.

NW 68262 Docld:32989696 Page 13

## Page 14

- 2-

Lee was advised that the Bureau had no objection to discussing

the discontinued operations and we mentioned specifically those wherein

we had a small proprietary interest with LEAA. An example was given

to Lee of an undercover operation in New York wherein, due to loose talk,

an informant was murdered gangland style (Operation Flyer).

Lee discussed as an alternate, our preparing "sanitized balance

sheets' of the on-going operations. He was told by representatives of the

Special Investigative Division that this could well raise a question and pin-

point possible dates of the institution of the operation and most likely

the Committee would then request the back-up books and records to sub-

stantiate the balance sheets.

Deputy Assistant Director Fehl told Lee

in no uncertain terms that prior to the time that we would make any

disclosure of any matter whatsoever, the Bureau would close down any

of its on-going current operations. The well-being and safety of the

Bureau Agents was and is of paramount importance; therefore, any

disclosure would necessitate a discontinuance and we would so advise

the Department.

Of the three proprietary interests, one has been discontinued;

however, the informant still resides and is active in the locale of the

proprietary. Further, off-shoot investigations are being conducted of

the discontinued operation. The second operation has been discontinued;

however, we are in the process of obtaining indictments and prosecution

is, of course, pending.

The third operation is on-going and we contem-

plate reaching our ultimate objective within the next sixty days.

In view of the above observations, the Special Investigative

Division strongly recommends the following:

(1) That we do not disclose any information whatsoever to

Assistant Attorney General Rex Lee for access or review by the Committee

on our on-going undercover operations.

(2) That a representative of the Special Investigative Division

discuss this matter with Assistant Attorney General Thornburgh, Criminal

Division, who has the responsibility of the pending prosecutive action in these

matters,

so that he, Thornburgh, has an opportunity for input into furnishing

data to the Committee.

In accordance with the instructiong of the Attorney

General on 1/8/76, Charles Maddor, House Select Committee Start

Mencer, reviewed the balance sheets and other financial data

pertaining to the Bureau proprietaries. Mañdos, after review

of these materials, stated that there would be no more requests

for disclosure of information concerning Bureau proprietaries

and that this would satisfy the Committee's needs. Maddox did,

vol a formation

however, ask that the Bureau advise hin whether there are in

existence any internal regulations concerning the operation of

proprietaries, whether the Bureau's operation of proprietaries

are in violation of Section 859 of Title 31 of the u. S. Code,

and

ask the Bureau to work with him in the preparation of a

short paragraph on proprietaries for the Committee's puilic

report.

The Department of Justice is, at the request of

Haddox, responding

to the question relating to Title 31, U.S.

Section Chief William Harward of the Laboratory Division

who had previously been cleared to give a deposition to represen-

I tatives of the House Select Committee appeared for a deposition in

that Committee's space on 11/11/75.

During the course of his interview which pertained to

the U.S. Recording Company and the utilization by the Bureau of

other companies in a similar fashion, i.e. cutout purchases, he

did not respond to a question as to what other companies he

knew

of which this Bureau dealt with indirectly through the U.S. Re-

Hayward indicated to the Committee representatives

that these companies are confidential sources of this Bureau.

Sub-

sequently, Harward advised SA Paul V. Daly of this Division that he

could recall five companies which furnished the Bureau equipment

through the U.S. Recording Company--namely, General Teledyne, Bet

and Howell, Custom Electric, Knowles Microphone and Northeast

Electronics. The aforementioned companies furnished the Bureau

equipment such

as dial recorders, transmitters and microphones.

By way of background, the guidelines

for interviews for

this Committee have followed the guidelines we have utilized with

the

Senate Select Committee in

which a current or former employee

need not respond to questions in four separate categories: (1)

information provided by sources (or any other information) which

might tend to identify a confidential source; (2) information con-

cerning sensitive investigative techniques; (3) information derived

from other Government agencies, including information from foreign

which could adversely affect ongoing investigations. While unlike

the Senate Select Committee, we have no written agreement to the

aforementioned categories but the House Select Committee has not

resisted thus far on our placing limitations on the information

they, may, gain through.

Legal Counsel to Mr. Adams

RE.:

HOUSTUDY

Harward did not respond to the question relating to

companies dealing through the U.S. Recording Company with the

Bureau because he felt

that we were dealing with a confidential

source and he could not disclose the identity of same. He in-

dicated that it could be determined by the name of the particular

company what type of equipment this Bureau was purchasing, thereby

disclosing a sensitive technique. This information is protected

by the

guidelines.

On 11/11/75, Richard Vermeire, Staff Member of captioned

Committee, who participated in the interview of Harward was tele-

phonically contacted by SA Daly and it was explained to him the

reason for the reluctance of the Bureau to furnish the names of

• the companies.

Instead, SA Daly offered to

response as to the companies, a generic description of the company .

and the reason for not disclosing the particular information.

Vermeire explained that he could not accept the alternative response.

He volunteered that Chairman Otis Pike and another unnamed Congress-

man were very much interested in this particular matter and that

it would be necessary for the Committee to have the requested

information.

Vermeire stated that Chairman Pike was concerned that

there may be some improprieties involved in this matter and

indicated he would make all the inquires necessary to resolve

this matter.

Vermeire stated that because of Chairman Pike's

interest he was receiving considerable pressure from the Com-

mittee to obtain the necessary information for the Committee

to make a

determination as to whether improprieties existed.

As an alternative, it was suggested to Vermeire that

he might wish to submit a written request asking for the in-

formation and the Bureau could address that aspect.

Vermeire

stated he would not do this. He indicated he wanted the response

from Harward in response to the question asked during the deposition

the conversation with Vermeire indicated the Committee would

pursue this particular aspect further.

Legal Counsel to Mr. Adams

RE:

HOUSTUDY

If it is determined we should not respond to this

particular question because these companies enjoy a con-

• fidential relationship and/or the disclosure of the requested

information would jeopardize a sensitive technique, a letterhead

memorandum to that effect should be prepared and furnished to the

Attorney General with a copy to the Deputy Attorney General by

cover letter for the Department's forwarding to the Committee.

It should be kept in mind that our failure to furnish the re-

quested information in the deposition does not mean the Committee

would not receive the information in some other fashion. What we

are addressing in this particular memorandum is the fact that we

do not want the information furnished by Section Chief Harward as

part of his deposition. Additionally, consideration should be

given to the fact that by refusing to furnish this particular

information we may highlight this aspect of the House Select

Committee inquiry to Chairman Pike and he may draw unwarranted

conclusions.

To date we have, of course, been scheduled for only

one day of FBI hearings by that Committee and there are in-

dications that this Bureau will not be a major target for the

Committee. Our refusal to furnish

the requested information

could, of course, direct additional attention to the Bureau.

RECOMMENDATION:

That the Laboratory Division in conjunction with the

Intelligence Division should expeditiously prepare the letterhead

memorandum with a cover letter to the Attorney General with a copy

should decide not to furnish the

information.

As. was discussed at that meeting, our staff has agreed to cooperate

with the Bureau's suggested procedures in obtaining information

relating to the informants listed below on the case by case basis.

The agreement reached involves the following procedures: 1) submission

of names with specific reference to the material needed by the

Committee; 2)

a request by the FBI to each of the individuals in-

volved requesting. permission for the release of such information in

the cases where the former informant status is not public information;

and 3) immediate access to information on the individuals in cases

where the former. informant status is public information.

We hope

that these procedures will not be too cumbersome and that the in-

• formation will be forthcoming.

Therefore, we hereby request access to all notes, memoranda, files, and

reports pertaining to the former FBI informants listed below:

Alfred Burnett-Seattle bombings

Director Sec'y —

Attached is an article which appeared in the Washington

Star News on December 21, 1975, written by Orr Kelly alleging that

the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) agents and General Accounting

Attice (GAO) auditors had entered into the investigation of the

FBI's dealings with the U. S. Recording Company•

The article

alleges that the IRS is running

"net worth" checks on past and

present Bureau officials along with Joseph Tait, the President

of U.S. Recording Company •

Richard Vermeire, Staff Member of captioned Committee,

advised SA Paul V. Daly of this Division that to his knowledge the

allegations contained in the Kelly article are without foundation.

He stated the Committee did meet with IRS representatives sometime

ago to discuss this matter but he had no indication that anything

had been done by Irs in this regard and that he knew of no other

staff member on the Committee that had such information. Ad-

ditionally, concerning the allegations of GAO auditors. looking

into this matter, Roger Carroll the accountant who is

going over

the U.S. Recording Company records is a GAO employee who has been

Massigned to captioned Committee.

Carroll's work product will re-

main with 'the House Select Committee and in no way is this inquiry

connected with GAO.

Vermeire stated that with regard to the Orr Kelly

article and his observations concerning it that he was also

speaking for Timothy Oliphant, the other Staff Member of

captioned Committee who is participating in the inquiry.

Vermeire speculated that the source of the news article was

Committee Counsel. Aaron Donner; however, he did not indicate

the basis for this speculation.

Dear Congressman Dellums:

This is in response to your letier to me dated

Soptember 29, 1975, which was received on October 7, 1975,

To clarity your inquiries, it should be noted the

Resident Agency at Berkeley, Califomia, operates under the

seneral supervision of the

Federal Bureau of Investigation's

San Francisco Office.

The complement of Special Agents assigned to the

Berkeley Resident Agency

is consistent with need

• In that

portion of the torritory for which our San Francisco Field

Office is responsible.

The assigment of personnel to the

Berkeley Resident Agency is in proporcion to chat of areas

of similar size and of like metropolitan composition.

The FbI applies a positive program aimed at cir-

culating opporcunities in the FBI for members of minority

groups and attracting those tho are interested and qualitied.

Our positive program, which rcceives guidance through the

Bureau's Office of Iqual Employnent Opportunity Affairs at

Spocial Agents In Charge of our 59 field offices and their

Agents headquartered in Derkeley, we do have Special Agents

Orientals, and fomale Special Agents assigned to ou

San Francisco Office and they are available for assignmeni

Honorable Ronald V. Dellums

Based on a survey during March, 1975, the San Francisco

Office was devoting under 20 percent of its time to domestic

intelligence (internal security) matters. This survey did

not break down the allocation of manpower below the field

office level.

The Special Agent in Charge of every FBI field

office is responsible for the use of the manpower in his

office.

He has the authority to deploy specially trained

personnel as necessary. Our Apprehension Teams, which have

as their objectives the enforcement of laws within our juris-

diction and the protection of lives, may be used in FBI

cases in which the risk of danger to human life is greater

than normal. When we have jurisdiction, the decision of how

best to respond is ours alone.

We do not anticipate any

conflict with state or local law enforcement agencies in

this regard.

By "black bag" operations I assume you mean sur-

reptitious entries. Since the matter is being reviewed by

the Department of

Justice, it would be inappropriate for me

to discuss it.

Sincerely yours.

Diroctor Sec'y —

On 12-10-75 the House Select Committee heard testimony

from Roger Fischer (phonetic), Professor Of Law, Harvara

University; former Attorney General Nicholas deB. Katzenbach;

and McGeorge Bundy. The major topic of discussion was covert

operations abroad.

Of particular interest to the Bureau was a question

by Representative Morgan Murphy to Mr. Katzenbach. Mr. Murphy

asked what Mr. Katzenbach would recommend in the way of

controls of the FBI other than Congressional oversight.

Katzenbach suggested limiting the term of the Director, tightening

electronic surveillance legislation, requiring specific author

zation to investigate

groups and creating administrative or

legislative procedures which would grant the Attorney General

more power to review FBI activities; for example, giving a

prosecuting Government attorney access to FBI files.

Congressman Murphy asked if the FBI requested

local police departments to conduct illegal wiretaps and

thereafter received from the local police information gained

from those taps.

Katzenbach responded that he did not know

the answer to that question.

He said he suspected it took

place, but the FBI never told him about that. Later, Congressman

Philip Hayes asked Katzenbach, in effect, if he suspected it

"took place why he didn't do something.

Katzenback responded

that on occasion he did make inquiry but the FBI told him it

was not done. Katzenbach stated one should remember the

Statement by McGeorge Bundy

House Select Committee on Intelligence

December 10, 1975

Mr. Chairman:

It is a pleasure to respond to your invitation to appear before this

Committee for a general discussion of the disadvantages and advantages of

covert operations conducted by the Central Intelligence Agency. In this brief

opening statement I confine myself to a few propositions. I have stated them with-

out detailed defense and elaboration, and often in quite tentative form, because I

believe the questions presented are not simple and the answers that will be right

in the future are not easy to determine sharply today. Moreover, like many other

citizens I am still learning from the extraordinary revelations of recent months;

it has been particularly painful to learn for the first time of many things that

happened while I was myself in government.. I should also emphasize that for nearly

ten years I have been unconnected with this field and have seen to it that there was

no connection whatever between the Ford Foundation and any secret government

agency.

This statement does not address particular episodes, except for a few

that are clearly on the record already, and for two contrasting reasons. Those which

I did know about in government are not matters which I yet feel free to discuss publicly

in detail, and those which have happened at other times are matters on which I do

not have first-hand or authoritative knowledge. In any case I think it may be more

useful for your purpose to try to suggest a limited number of broad notions.

## Page 53

First and foremost, the general presumption, in considering covert action,

should in peacetime be against it. To put the point sharply, the general record of

the last twenty years suggest that only too often the covert activities of the United

States government have cost us more than they were worth. There are notable ex-

ceptions, and they may give some guidance as to the kinds of exceptions which may

be wise in the future, but the general proposition seems to me a strong one.

This proposition, if it is correct, has a very important consequence for

the management and control of such operations. While in principle it has always

been the understanding of senior government officials outside the CIA that no covert

operations would be undertaken without the explicit approval of "higher authority,"

there has also been a general

expectation within the agency that it was its proper

business to generate attractive proposals and to stretch them, in operation, to the

furthest limit of any authorization actually received. Indeed, as we now know, there

have been cases, notably in assassination plotting, in which activities have gone far

beyond any known authorization. I believe that these such inexcusable and unauth-

orized actions will not be repeated soon, and I think it is important to recognize

that internal corrective action was taken well before recent revelations. But the

general disposition toward activism in the operational offices of the CIA is another

matter, and it is this general disposition that I think could be significantly con-

strained by a recognized and general presumption that covert operations are

entirely out of order except when they have explicit and exceptional authorization.

Nor do I think it necessarily true that an explicit recognition of the

exceptional character of such operations would reduce their value and quality in

NIK 68262 Docld: 32989696 Page 53. -

---

## Page 54

-3-.

cases in which they were in fact authorized. On the contrary, I think a CIA with a

much smaller and leaner covert intelligence capability could easily have greater

specitic eftectiveness in its exceptional operations than the very large and over-

staffed enterprise developed in the last generation.

The kinds of exceptions which might justify occasional covert operations

are not numerous, and can be grouped under a few major headings.

(1) In time of open warfare, the case for covert activities is

significantly strengthened.

There is still good reason to be wary

in authorizing such activities, but the fact remains, when there

is open conflict, that the balance of the argument over special

secret operations shifts. In an unpopular and divisive war like

Vietnam, it will be dangerous to exaggerate the meaning of this

shift, but the historical and logical case for this exception is

strong.

(2) A critically important need for intelligence collection can

justify special operations that would otherwise be undesirable.

The early missions of the U-2 over the Soviet Union and the

special missions authorized over Cuba just before the Cuban

missile crisis are excellent examples. The messy handling of

the U-2 shoot-down of 1960 is a separate matter with its own

lessons, but the strategic arms race of the 1950s and the Cuban

missile crisis of 1962 would have been enormously more

dangerous without covert intelligence overflights.

Intelligence collection is often separated from covert operations

in the thinking of intelligence administrators and other concerned

officials. I think this distinction, like the parallel distinction in

the field of counterintelligence, deserves re-examination. Both

intelligence collection and counterintelligence have involved covert

activity which goes well beyond conventional espionage and counter-

espionage, and such enlargements of activity often present many

of the same dangers as covert actions of other sorts. The mas-

sive mail intercepts conducted in the name of counterintelligence

are an excellent example of an abuse which would have been much

less likely to occur if it had been adequately constrained by a

plain requirement of approval from "higher authority."

= 4 -

(3) It is at least worth consideration whether there may not be

need for some highly secret activity in emerging fields like those

of international terrorism and nuclear danger.

I do not know

enough about these subjects to know what could or should be done,

but I do not believe we can assert with complacency that there is

no need for such work here that might go beyond intelligence col-

lection. I find it hard to exclude the possibility that in these

fields situations could arise in which covert action of some sort.

would be the least evil choice available.

(4) It is not always wrong to give covert financial support to

beleaguered democrats in countries where the continuing right

of political choice is directly threatened by extremists of either

the right or left. This is a sensitive and difficult area, and it

is understandable that when excessive and heavy-handed inter-

vention seems to be conducted in ways which assist only right-

wing authoritarians, covert political action should get a bad

name. But that is not the whole of our historical record, and I

believe that heavy external support given by. others for anti-

constitutional totalitarians can legitimate support for genuinely

democratic and constitutional forces.

The hardest cases in this category are those of appeals for help

from political groups which are out of power and fear that con-

stitutional and democratic process may be extinguished by the

existing regime. Our experience in such anguishing cases sug

'gests that it is not easy to make a genuinely constructive response

in such situations. I conclude that there is a heavy burden of

proof on those that would support the opposition in such situa-

tions, but I do not find this a happy conclusion.

In concluding let me suggest briefly certain general standards which

ought to be met under all of the four kinds of exceptions I have suggested.

First, no operation should ever be covert if in fact it can be as effec-

tively conducted in the open.

Moreover, the justification for covertness must always

be sought in the international situation and not in any hesitations about public or

Congressional opinion in the United States. An overflight should be kept private

primarily because its public announcement is so painfully embarrassing to the

KHA 68262 Dold 32989696 Page 55

## Page 56

-5 -

country which is overflown. A political subsidy, if and when justified on other

grounds, can merit covertness

only if that is important to its effectiveness on the

scene - never because disclosure would be troubling at home.

The second general standard is the converse - that a covert operation

should never be authorized unless in fact it can be persuasively defended to the

American public and to the Congress if it is exposed. I should note that this

proposition is almost the opposite of the traditional doctrine of "plausible denial."

Here the mistakes over the U-2 shoot-down are instructive. If from the first day

of that affair the administration had explained what had happened and why the flights

were authorized in the first place, it would have had much less trouble both here

and abroad. The case of the U-2 flights over Cuba is still more striking, for here

the evidence obtained from the flights was published to the world within weeks, and

that evidence in itself provided complete and persuasive justification for the over -

flights. We will have fewer but better covert operations if all those who authorize

them ask themselves severely how they will defend them to the American public and

to the world in event of exposure.

Finally, it is my belief that the initiative in considering covert opera-

tions should be held firmly in the hands of political leaders and not operational

activists. The government should not be in a position in which there is constant

pressure

from large and zealous operational bureaus to make use of any and all

of their alleged capabilities. Nor should there be indulgence in the pretense thai

covert operations can readily substitute for more visible forms of action. They

are limited instruments, and the attempt to stretch them beyond their limited useful-

ness is usually both ineffective and costly.

Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee:

The fundamental problem with covert activities in support of foreign

policy objectives is, of course, the fact that they are covert. Their success

depends upon their secrecy.

And that simple proposition raises the central question for this Committee:

in a society which depends on a high degree of freedom of information to

control the activities of government, is it possible to exercise polítical control

over covert activities abroad? Is it possible to hold an agency charged with

such responsibilities accountable in our political system?

As obvious as that point is, it is easy to lose sight of in the spate of

revelations about covert activities of the past conducted by the Central

Intelligence Agency. Public debate sometimes seems to focus on the merits

or demerits of a particular CIA action; on the judgments exercised by those

conducting such activities, and on the morality of some techniques, or even

on the question of whether or not we should covertly interfere in foreign

political processes at all.

I start from the premise that some of our covert activities abroad have

been successful, valuable in support of a foreign policy which was under-

stood and approved by the electorate and Congress, and that situations may

MV 68262 Decld: 32989696 Page 58

---

## Page 59

well arise in the future--and may even exist today-where our capacity to

conduct appropriate covert activities could be an important adjunct to our

foreign policy and to stability in the world. I also start from the premise

that some of our covert activities abroad have not been successful, and

have been wrong and wrongheaded. In some cases we have grossly over-

estimated our capacity to bring about a desirable result and have created

situations unintended and undesirable. And, from recent revelations, I

would conclude that at least some of the ideas seriously considered were

plainly wild and irresponsible.

Secondly, I would like to make it clear that I believe that covert means

for collecting intelligence abroad are indispensable. When, in my 1973

article in Foreign Affairs, I said I would be prepared to give up all covert

activities, I excepted from that statement covert activities designed to gain

intelligence. There is a clear conceptual distinction between activities.

designed to gain intelligence, and activities designed to influence political

acts directly. But I do not think that line is easy to draw in factual circum-

stances, and I think my article was somewhat glib in giving the impression

that it could be.

At any given time the extent of covert activity designed to influence

political conditions in another country is very much a function of how one

views the world and the role of the united States in it. Thus for a quarter

NW 68262 Docld:32989696 Page 59

## Page 60

century alter World

mar Il the commonly-held American perception of a

competitive struggle with the Soviet Union everywhere dominated our foreign

policy. Both the United States and the Soviet Union were anxious to extend

their influence as far as possible. Both countries employed overt and covert

means to do so. Each country had the aim of installing and preserving in

power governments lavorably oriented to themsolves; and the United. States

was extremely active in preventing Communist governments from taking over

• Third World countries. Because we are an open society we made far more

use of open techniques, such as economic and military aid, than we did of

covert activities.

Nonetheless it is my strong impression that since 1960 we

have been making a major effort to wind down many of our covert activities,

despite the recent revelations concerning Cuba, the Dominican Republic,

and, of course, Chile.

Phasing down both our overt and our covert activities is a direct

reflection of our changing world and a changing foreign policy. The countries

of Europe and Japan have regained economic strength, and the potential of

world Communism for Soviet domination has been fractionated by the growth

of nationalism and the reemergence of China. I do not mean to sound sanguine

in this respect. Nobody can look at Portugal today, the potential in Spain,

the growth of the Communist Party in Italy, and the general decline of

Christian Democrats throughout Europe without feeling some measure of

concern. We will be faced for some time with the problems caused by the

radical elements in the Arab world, and there is much turmoil in S. E. Asia

as a result of the collapse of Vietnam.

NW 68262 Docld:32989696 Page 60

## Page 61

I wrote in 1973 that I thought the time had come to abandon all covert

activities (other than intelligence) designed to influence political results in

foreign countries. That is still my position today. But I arrive at it reluctantly

and with the belief that there are covert activities which are proper, useful,

and moral. I do not think it is an

easy conclusion to arrive at. Perhaps it is

not even a wise one.

I arrive at this conclusion for a number of reasons, all involving

judgments which the Committee may not share with me.

First, I believe the revelations of Watergate and of the recent investigations

into the intelligence activities of the CIA and the FBI have created a great mis-

trust by the people of the United States in their government. Unless one feels

that the loss is greater than I would estimate it to be, I think abandoning secret

activities abroad would help to restore public confidence in government in this

country.

Second, I think the public revelation of past CIA activities, while essential

to restoring confidence in government in this country, has done much to destroy

the CIA's capacity successfully to-conduct covert activities abroad. Further,

• unless we formally abandon them, I suspect we will get blamed for even more

things which we have not done in the future than has been the case in the past.

Given that situation, the game may not be worth the candle.

NW 68262 Docid:32989696 Page 61

---

## Page 62

Third, I think we need to put our energies into formulating and

articulating a forcign policy for the next several years which can command

public consensus and public support. We simply do not have that today

and I think it is important that we should. Not only do I believe covert activities.

are particularly dangerous when there is not broad support for the foreign

policy which they serve, but I fear that the emotional issues involved in covert

activities will tend to detract from and confuse propor public debate as to what

our foreign policy should be.

If we can achieve that consensus, and it is a

clear one, then perhaps at some future date we could consider the possibility

of covert activities in its support with such controls as we can devise. But in

the interval I think they should be suspended.

Fourth, I have the feeling from recent revelations that secrecy becomes

a source of power and a factor in misjudgment. Control over relatively large

resources, unconstrained by the knowledge and views of many of one's peers,

is itself a dangerous

situation in a political democracy.

I do not wish to be understood as saying. that I do not believe that there

are not some steps the Congress could take which would alleviate some of the

problems which have occurred in the past. It could, for example, forbid

any U. S. involvement in the assassination of foreign political leaders; forbid

any U. S. involvement in directly providing weapors to any non-govern-

mental

group abroad -- though it cannot probably effectively assure that

money provided may not in fact be spent for those purposes. It could

NW 68262 Docld:32989696 Page 62

---

## Page 63

6

insist on

lar tighter control in the Executive Branch of covert activities

aimed at influencing political decisions abroad, and insist upon review,

with written record, of all such activities at a very high level of govern-

ment, togciher with an appraisal of their success or failure. And it could

provide for review at specified periods -- perhaps every four or five years --

by an appropriate Congressional committee.

I believe procedures of this kind would be helpful in bringing

matters under control. I believe they would have the desirable effect of

reducing

clandestine activities, and chanelling these into what I would

regard as the more desirable and legitimate areas;

for example, helping

to fund activities on the part of local groups designed lo express diversity

of, opinion within a relatively closed society.

What I do not know -- and the Committee must judge -- is whether or

not steps of this kind are adequate to deal with the problems of secrecy in

the circumstances of today.

Reference o: memorandum of 11-10-75 from Mr. Branigan

to M

Wannall concerning inquiry from Congressman Otis G. Pike, Chairman

House select Committee on Intelligence, requesting information

regarding "alleged and confirmed" incidents of Soviet-bloc penetrations on

congressional staffs.

33-1164,41

Per instructions by Mr. Adams, Inspector Bowers met with

Senator James O. Eastland on 11-18-75 and advised him of this inquiry from

Congressman Pike since a former employee of the Senator's, one Kenneth Ra

Tolliver, was involved with the Soviets while working for the Senator.

Senator Fastland was told that while we had confirmed to Congressman Pike

the existencecof one incident wherein a member of a congressional staff had

furnished information to hostile intelligence agents obtained through his

congressional employment, we had declined to identify any of the parties

involved since this would infringe the privacy of others. Senator Eastland

expressed appreciation for our having informed him of this matter and asked

that he be kept currently informed of future pertinent developments.

Senator Eastland advised that he had received a letter from

Congressman Pike recently requesting that members of the House Select

Committee on Intelligence staff be allowed access to the files of the Senate

Subcommittee on Internal Security, which Senator Eastland chairs. He said

the letter indicates the staff would be interested in organizations and individ-

uals on lists maintained by the Subcommittee, and also inquired about the

FBI's relations with the Subcommittee. Senator Eastland said that he had

determined the letter was sent without Congressman Pike's knowledge or

approval; hence, he (Senator Eastland) will ignore it.

fore us is hardly debatable. The claim of executive privilege is based on

the assertion, set forth in the communcation to the Select Committee,

that the documents subpoenaed "in addition to disclosing highly sensi-

tive military and foreign affairs assessments and evaluations, disclose

the consultation process involving advice and recommendations of

advisers to former Presidents, made to them directly or to Committees

composed of their closest aides and counselors."

The argument is made that executive privilege may not be asserted

. by President Ford for communications directed to former Presidents

or to advisory committees of former Presidents. On this point, as far

there are no specific legal precedents. However, if the ra-

tionale of United States v. Nixon is applied it becomes apparent that

doctrine must extend to communications involving former

The doctrine of executive privilege is bottomed not on some legal

technicality but on plain and simple logic: the need for confidentiality.

This need can be served only if those who make recommendations to

the President know that their expressions will be protected even after

the f'resident to whom those expressions were made has left office. No

Secretary of State, no high government official, no aide to the Presi-

dent has any assurance that the man he speaks to as President today

may not be gone from the scene tomorrow. How can we espect him to

advise the President with that candor of which the Supreme Court

speaks in U.S. v. Aixon it he knows that the very next day the protec-

tion of executive privilege may be shattered because of a change in the

occupant of the Oval Office?

If the need for a confidential channel of communication exists, isn't

that need just as great on the day before the Presidency changes hands

in orderly fashion every four or eight years? It is just as important on

the last day of a President's term as it is on the first day. But if we

deny the application of executive privilege to conversations with a

former resident then we have to conclude that communications which

are ally protected on January 19 have absolutely no protection on

Those who do not believe that the doctrine of executive privilege can

be invoked by a current President as to occurrences prior to his admin-

istration contend that such & proposition would lead to the ridiculous

result that a current President might invoke executive privilege as to

communications to President Washington. The answer to that is quite

simple: the doctrine is applicable as far back as reasonably necessary

to protect the purpose of the privilege. After the passage of time has

eliminated the dangers of exposure the need for contidentiality disap-

pears and exccutive privilege dissolves.

In any event. Secretary Kissinger is charged by the Select Commit-

tee with a criminal act— violation of 2 USC 192— for obeying the law-

ful order of his superior, the President. It is unconscionable-and

indeed likely unconstitutional-to prosecute a subordinate official for

obeying the lawful direction of his superior.

I submit. therefore, that the resolution of contempt based on this

subpoena should be voted down because there is no critical need for

the documents sought, and because there is verv substantial doubt that

prosecution for contempt in this instance would be successful.

fold duties; the importance of this confidentiality is too plain

to require further discussion. Human experience teaches that

those who expect public dissemination of their remarks may

yell temper candor with a concern for appearances and for

heir own interests to the detriment of the decisionmaking

process. Whatever the nature of the privilege of confidenti-

alty of Presidential communications in the exercize of Art.

II powers, the privilege can be said to derive from the su-

premacy of each branch within its own assigned area of con-

stitutional duties. Certain powers and privileges flow from

the nature of enumerated powers; the protection of confi-

dentialty of Presidential communications has similar consti-

tutional underpinnings.

In this case the President challenges a subpoena served

he has a privilege against disclosure of confidential communi-

cations. He does not place his claim of privilege on the ground

political acceptability, than on precise reconstruction of past

Thus, in order to have any chance of success in judicial proceedings

which, it should be remembered, are criminal in nature. the Committee

must show that the recommendations of the various Secretaries of

State during the 14 years in question are "demonstrably critical to the

responsible fulfillment of the Committee's function. There is little

doubt in my mind but that this test cannot be met.

Then there is a second, and perhaps even more formidable, legal

hurdle. It is the hurdle of executive privilege asserted in this instance

by the President of the United States.

It is important to keep in mind that the assertion of erecutive

privilege was made by the President and not by the Secretary of State.

By letter from the President's counsel to Secretary Kissinger,

the

President advised the Secretary that he invoked executive privilege

as to the documents covered by the subpoena. The Secretary then trans-

mitted that decision to the Committee. This procedure followed the

method established several years before by presidential order.

But the important question is whether or not the assertion of execu-

tive privilege is valid in this instance. That such a doctrine exists and

has constitutional validity has been clearly recognized by our courts

including the Supreme Court of the United States. United States. v.

ing inquiry. But what pertinence do recommendations for covert ac-

tions have to the business of the Select Committee?

H. Res. 591 established the Select Committee "to conduct an inquiry

into the organization, operations and oversight of the intelligence

community of the United States Government."

The recommendations

of the Secretary of State, or the recommendations of anyone else for

are not relevant to the

"organization, operations, and

oversight of the intelligence community."

H. Res. 591 authorizes the

Select Committee to inquire into

"the necessity, nature,

of overt and covert intelligence activities by United States intelligence

instrumentalities

* * *" While the authority of the Committee ex-

tends to covert activities actually carried out, that authority does not

give the Committee the power to force anyone to disclose what recom-

mendations he made for covert activities. Perhaps there are some in

the Congress who would like to know what the Secretaries of State

from 1962 to 1972 were recommending. That would make fascinating

mandate is to determine how our intelligence community operates.

There isn't any need for our Committee to look into the minds of the

Secretaries of State over the last 14 years in order to determine how

the intelligence community carried out its functions. Our inquiry be-

gins with the process by which a decision is made to carry out a covert

operation, not with a recommendation to the decisionmakers.

Therefore, I submit that there is no real need for the Committee to

have the information sought by the subpoena. Regardless of our legal

right. we should not pursue the criminal prosecution of the secretary

of State for something that we have no real need for in carrying out

our legislative function.

First, there is the legal question as to whether or not the subpoenaed

materials seek information which is beyond the scope of our inquiry.

In making this determination the courts will look to the scope of our

authority as defined by H. Res. 591, and will also look to the facts

of the particular case to determine if the subpoenaed materials are

critical to the performance of the Committee's function. The United

States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia (to which court

such an issue as we have before us would travel) spoke to this issue

in Senate Select Committee v. Nixon, 498 I. 2d 725 (1974). The court

must depend solely on whether the subpoenaed evidence is

Committee's functions.

at the White House for decision on the question of executive privilege.

On November 14, the Committee voted, 10-2, to bring contempt

action against Secretary Kissinger for non-compliance with the sub-

)n the same day a letter on behalf of the Secretary of State was

delivered to the Chairman of the Select Committee respectfully des

clining compliance. The letter reads, in part, as follows:

The subpoena sought "all documents relating to Stat

Department

recommending

covert action made to the Na-

tional Security Council and the Forty Committee and its pre

decessor Committees from January 20, 1961, to present." The

Committee staff has made clear that this is intended to cover

recommendations originating with the State Department. An

examination of our records has disclosed ten such documents.

dating from the period 1962 through 1972. These consist of

recommendations from officials in the State Department,

sometimes the Secretary of State, to the Forty Committee or

its predecessor, 303 Committec, or to the President himself

in connection with consideration by one of those Committees.

The documents in question, in addition to disclosing highly

sensitive military and foreign affairs assessments and evalua-

tions, disclose the consultation process involving advice and

recommendations of advisers to former Presidents, made to

them directly or to Committees composed of their closest aides

and counselors.

A very extensive effort was required to identify documents meet-

ing the description in the subpoena.

This was no small undertaking

considering that a period of more than 14 years was involved. As

of November 14, the date of the letter referred to above, the staff of

the administration of President Ford, or the period of time in which

Henry Kissinger has been Secretary of State, and that nine of the

I question the need of the Committee to have recommendations by

the State Department of covert actions. I admit that this is an interest-

NW 68262 Docld:32989696 Page 94

## Page 95

24

All factors, legal and otherwise, should be weighed by us in making

this decision: is it wise for the House of Representatives to vote favor-

ably on

the resolutions? Our decision could have

far-reaching

consequences.

I would now like to give my own views on this question. I offer them

without pretense of sagacity, but with assurances to my colleagues in

the House that they have been reached sincerely, honestly, and with

much reflection.

It is my opinion that it was not wise of the Select Committee to

vote the resolutions of criminal contempt against the Secretary of

State. Thus, I believe it to be the better part of wisdom for the House

to disapprove the resolutions. I say this for three principle reasons:

(a) To lay down the legal gauntlet now runs the risk of increasing

lostility on both sides. This will lead to a freezing of positions.

onciliatory approach will probably result in the Committee gettin

more information. H.Res. 591, which established the Select Com-

mittee, directs the Committee to report to the House no later than

January 31, 1976. If we send this matter to the courts there is no way

that the issue can be resolved prior to that date nor prior to any reason-

able extension of the life of the Committee.

(b) It is questionable that we need all of the information called

for by the subpoenas. I am convinced that we can obtain,

on a nego-

tiated basis, sufficient information to carry out our legislative man-

date. We should insist on our "legal rights" only when the informa-

tion sought to be withheld from Congress is absolutely necessary

to its legislative function. Especially is this true when the insistence

of asserted legal rights involves the dissembling and enormously dis-

ruptive contempt proceedings against an executive official with heavy

responsibilities. Whatever our views may be of the policies pursued

by Secretary Kissinger and/or the President, we should have a decent

regard for the effects of a judicial confrontation on the ability of

, the Secretary of State to carry out his duties. To require him to direct

his time and energy to a judicial battle would cause a corresponding

diminution of the time that he can devote to his responsibilities. This

is an important element to be placed on the scales in resolving the

equation of wisdom.

(c) Thirdly, I believe it unwise to pursue contempt because there

are serious legal questions as to whether the action proposed by the

Committee will be successful. The Committee has chosen a course of

action which will place the judicial branch in the position of being

the arbiter. If the judicial proceedings are destined to 'be unsuccessful,

because of weaknesses in the committee's case, it behooves the House

not to proceed for at least two reasons. First, we should seek to avoid

the substantial expenditures of money and human effort which wil

have to be expended by both sides. Second, we should seek to avoid

the possible establishment of an adverse precedent because of a weak

case.

II. SPECIFIC VIETS ON THE RESOLUTION COVERED BY THIS REPORT

Let us turn now to the specific resolution covered by this report and

the subpoena on which it is based. It may be useful to the Members

to break out the details of the subpoena as follows:

NW 68262 Docld:32989696 Page 95

CONCURRING VIEWS OF OTIS G. PIKE

This Committee, since its inception, has had some diticulty pene-

trating veil after veil of secrecy thrown by the various intelligence

agencies over the various intelligence activities of the United States

government. One of the mandates of the Committee, as set forth in

the resolution which created it, was to look at:

the nature and extent of executive branch oversight and

control of United States intelligence activities

This we have attempted to do and the results have been disturbing.

In general, rather than being circumscribed by oversight and control

the CIA was acting in every activity of questionable legality and/

or morality, on orders from

"higher authority"- either the President

himself or the National Security Council or its "40 Committee."

I'hose covert actions generated 'by the Central Intelligence Agency's

orofessionals have tended to be that-professional. Those generated

oy the White House or the State Department have tended to be more

questionable, yet apparently they were rarely questioned. In further-

ance of our mandate, the Committee, on the motion of Mr. McClory,

and by a vote of 8 ayes, 5 present, issued a subpoena asking for the pro-

duction of all recommendations made by the State Department to the

National Security Council for covert actions by the CIA. The Na-

tional Security Council is a statutory body, created by Congress in

the National Security Act of 1947. It is not simply an extension of

the Presidency. If there is any legal authority for covert actions by

the CIA (other than the alleged Constitutional power of the President

to lies co the actions by they A hot he c. t het in that a vin

authorizes "such other functions and duties related to intelligence af-

fecting the national security as the National Security Council may

from time to time direct." This is the language on which the CIA has

cil for covert actions.

The State Department, for reasons unclear to this member, has held

itself to be in a wholly different position from every other Department

with which the Committee has dealt. At an earlier time, this Commit-

charge of the Cyprus desk in the State Department had objected

strongly to our actions during that period, had believed that both the

coup and invasion could have been prevented, and had expressed his

views in wilting. The Committee sought, by subpoena, to obtain that

document, and the State Department refused to provide it, rasing the

awful spectre of McCarthyism if Congress were able to get the recom-

nendations of middle-level officers. In refusing to provide the recom

nendations of the man in charge of the Cyprus desk as to what we

should have done in Cyprus, the Secretary of State, on October 14,

1975, wrote the Committee as follows :

It is my strong belief that the Committee should look to

the

policy levels of the Department,

and not to junior and

is my principal aers, eos the police in ortisible dor policy,

middle-level officers, for the

and it is we who should be held accountable before the Con-

gress and the American people for the manner in which we

exercise the authority and responsibility vested in us by the

President and Congress of the United States.

In keeping with

this principle I am prepared now, as I

got the bonged it veted in whis the

have been from the begining, to do the following :

*

*

Authorize any policy level officer of the Department or

the Foreign Service to testify before the Select Committee

on recommendations received by him from his subordinates,

but without identification of authorship, and any recommen-

dations he forwarded to his supervisors.

Just stay away from the poor middle-level officers and we policy

makers will be happy to tell you about our recommendations!

All that is at issue in this subpoena is precisely what the Secretary

of State assured Congress it would get. We want the recommenda-

tions of the State Department's policy makers for covert actions.

If the recommendations of lower level officers in the State Depart-

ment are to be denied to Congress on the grounds of "McCarthyism"

and those of top level officers in the State Department on the grounds

of "executive privilege" then the State Department has arrogated

unto itself total non-accountability for its recommendations as to

operations by the CIA or the NSA or any other intelligence agency.

Oversight by Congress demands, first of all, the will and the stamina

to exercise oversight. Secondly, it requires knowledge as to what ac

tions

are being undertaken.

The Congress simply cannot exercise

oversight if the Executive branch or any Department thereof uni-

laterally determines what facts Congress may have.

There cannot be

comity between the branches if the solemn commitments of October

are broken by November.

The Secretary of State is in contempt of Congress and if Congress

fails to meet its own responsibilities it will well merit that contempt.

DISSENTING VIEWS OF HON. DAVID C. TREEN

The majority of the Select Committee has voted three resolutions of

contempt against Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. In each in-

stance the resolution recommends criminal prosecution of Secretary

Kissinger under sections 192 and 194 of Title 2 of the United States

Code.

first. I want to make some general comments applicable to th

hree resolutions taken together. Following will be my observation

on the specific resolution covered by this report.

I. GENERAL VIEWS ON THE THRDE CONTEMPT RESOLUTIONS

Like every member of this Committee I am interested in the Select

Committee receiving whatever information is necessary and appro-

priate to our function. It is of vital importance that our intelligence

community

efficiently, economically, prudently, and

proper regard for the rights of individuals.

I differ with the majority on the question of what is "necessary and

appropriate" to our function. I also differ with the majority as to the

wisdom and appropriateness in these circumstances, of our attempts

to hold the Secretary of State in contempt.

The issue of a congressional committee's authority to obtain testi-

mony and materials from the executive branch of the government is a

most important and, indeed, a most interesting issue.

This is a legal

issue, a constitutional issue.

It is the view of some,

if not all, of the

Committee majority that this fundamental issue must be thrashed out

here and now.

In my opinion, neither this Committee nor any other congressiona

committee should feel compelled to assert its leral richts just for the

necessary to the legislative function to obtain the testimony or mate

ials and when there is no other way to meet that legislative neec

hus. it is my hope that the distinction between, what the Selec

committee, or the Congress, may be entitled to legally, on the on

hand, and the appropriateness and necessity of asserting and prosecut-

ina those rights, on the other hand, will be kept clearly in mind in the

debate on the issues raised by the resolutions of contempt.

I am not saying that the legal and constitutional questions should

not be considered and debated. Indeed they should, because the legal

CONCURRING VIEWS OF RONALD V. DELLUMS

Throughout our investigations the Select Committee on Intelligence

has encountered a pattern of non-cooperation from

branch agencies. The refusal to provide this information is yet another

critical example of their unwillingness to cooperate. There is no doubt

that the documents sought are essential to the Committee's inquiry

The material requested is all of the documents relating to State

Department's recommendations for covert actions to the National

Security Council and the Forty Committee and the predecessor

directed without 40 Committee and NSC approval, contrary to law.

This specific information would be invaluable in establishing those

actions forwarded for approval by the Horty Committee and in estab-

lishing ways and means of approval.

The subpoena was voted subsequent to unsuccessful staff attempts

to secure the specitied information.

After the subpoena was issued, no eftort was made to comply with

the request of the Committee. To preclude the Committee's review oj

this information would be contributing to a cover-up of possible wrons

still very much alive and to set a precedent in this case in which

Presidents and their closest ades could tear revelation of their internal

deliberations after they left the government would certainly have a

chilling effect on the trank, forthright,

and sometimes publicly un-

populi advice which the Chief Executive has a right to expect from

he majority report. The Committee subpoenaed and the Executive ha

ompiled a total of 25 documents prepared by the Department of Stat

which were sent to the National Security Council and the Forty Com-

mittee in which the Department initiated 18 proposals for covert action

projects. These documents cannot be described as a normal part of the

remendous paper flow between an Executive department and th

White House. Rather. these documents contained hiohly sensitive in

formation and went directly to the National Security Council, which

is chaired directly by the President, or to the Forty Committee, which

is chaired by the Assistant to the President for National Security Af-

fairs-one of the President's two closest advisors in matters of foreign

which he is aware, did any covert operation receive approval without

nents either went directly to the President or were the basis for a

in writing the President's instruction to the Secretary of State to re-

spectfully decline compliance with the subpoena on the grounds of the

President's personal assertion of executive privilege. The Majority Re-

port falls to mention the tact of this assertion of executive privilege;

neither does it, in any way, challenge the validity of the assertion.

In the above-mentioned letter from the President to the Committee,

the Committee received the President's personal word that

the documents revealed to an unacceptable degree that con-

sultation process involving advice and recommendations to

Presidents Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon, made to them di-

rectly or to committees composed of their closest aides and

counselors.

The Committee has no evidence, and has, in fact, made no claim

that this is not the case. In the absence of any such claim, it seems to

me that the President's claim in this respect ought to be honored and

respected.

The Committee's action in pressing the contempt resolution in the

face of the President's assertion of executive privilege in this case

creates a conflict between the House of Representatives and the Presi-

dent which cannot be resolved by following any definitive precedent..

However, there is a clearly established manner for the House to meet

a challenge which it regards as contumacious. 'There is no need to refer

this matter to the courts. If this House had the gumption, it could

utilize its own authority to order the Sergeant-at-Arms to seize the

Secretary and confine him to a common jail in the District of Colum-

bia or the Guard Room of the Capitol Police. Of course there is no.

apparent intention on the part of any members of this Committee to

follow this course of action. Indeed, no Congress has even undertaken:

to exercise its contempt authority in this manner against a sitting

member of the President's cabinet-but the members ought to be

aware that if the full House approves this resolution, it will set in

motion a course of events which can result in an equally disastrous

spectacle.

My point is that there may never be a "good" time in the course of

Congressional-Executive Department relations for seeking a definitive

ruling on the question of the power of a House Committee to secure

documents or information where a defense of "executive privilege" is

raised. While, indeed, there may never be a "good" time for pursuing

such a procedure, now would seem to be the "worst" time considering

the turbulent situation in world affairs.

Several members of the Committee have questioned the President's

authority to assert executive privilege on behalf of his predecessors in

office. Bearing in mind that the raison d'etre of the privilege is the pro-

tection of the integrity of the consultation process between the Chief

Executive and his closest advisors, it would seem obvious that the priv-

ilege runs to the Ofice of the Presidency rather than to the individual

President himself and numerous precedents can be cited in support

of this particular assertion. The President has not claimed a privilege

which covers a period going back to the founding of the Republic-

cather he has sought to protect the consultation process in the im

mediate past three Administrations as it occurred over the past li

years. Many people who served in the past three Administrations are

CONCURRING VIEWS OF JAMES P. JOHNSON

The response to the subpoena issued to Henry A. Kissinger as Sec-

retary of State raised a fundamental issue and deserves the closest.

attention and scrutiny. The subpoena requested "all documents relat-

ing to State Department recommending covert action made to the

National Security Council and the Forty Committee and its prede-

cessor committees from January 20, 1961 to present."

On November 14, 1975, the Chairman received a letter read into the

record by Mr. McClory as follows:

DEAR Mr. CHAIRMAN: The Secretary of State has been in-

structed by the f'resident respectfully to decline compliance

with your subpoena to the Secretary of November 6.

for the reason that it would be contrary to the public interest

and incompatible with the sound functioning of the Executive

Branch to produce the documents requested.

the subpoena sought "all documents relating to State De-

partment recommending covert action made to the Nationa

Security Council and the forty Commit and see pree

cessor committees from January 20, 1961, to present.

committee staff has made clear that this is intended to cover

recommendations originating with the State Department. An

examination of our records has disclosed ten such documents.

dating from the period 1962 through 1972. These consist of

recommendations from officials in the State Department,

sometimes the Secretary of State, to the Forty Committee or

Its predecessor, 303 Committee, or to the President himself

in connection with consideration by one of those committees.

l'he documents in question, in addition to disclosing highl

sensitive military and foreign affairs assessments and eval

uations, disclose the consultation process involving advice

and recommendations of advisers to former Presidents, made

to them directly or to committees composed of their closest

aides and counselors.

Therefore, I advise you that the Secretary of State is de-

clining to comply with such subpoena on the basis of the

President's

assertion of Executive

privilege. Sincerely,

George FI. Aldrich, Acting Legal Advisor to the Depart-

ment of State.

The key paragraph says, "The documents in question, in addition

to disclosing highly sensitive military and foreign affairs assessments

rectly or to committees composed of their closest aides and counselors."

This language was nearly identically repeated in a Presidential letter

to the Chairman dated November 19, 1975..

The secrecy raised peripherally by the letter must not be allowed to

deflect attention away from the real issue.

The President and the

Chairman and Ranking Member previously worked out an agreement

under which the committee would receive classified information. Pur-

suant to this agreement, no classified information received by the com-

mittee can be released without the President's prior approval. Since

reaching this agreement, no information requested has been denied the

committee on the grounds of its classification, and the President has

not said here that the documents are denied because they are highly

classified. Rather, the assertion is made that they

"disclose the con-

sultation process involving advice and recommendations of adorsers

to former Presidents, made to them directly or to committees composed

of their closest aides and counselors."

But, the subpoena was for documents from the State Department to

the National Security Council and Forty Committee and its prede-

cessor. To allow the doctrine of Executive privilege to extend to gov-

ernment documents of prior Administrations where publication and

classification is not an issue, is to my mind a dereliction of my duty as a

Member of Congress. The claim was not made by the Presidents in-

volved. The documents were not removed at the expiration of the

terms as being private. They are not being held in private, Presiden-

tial files. They were left as government documents in the State Depart-

ment files. They are classified, but their classification is not asserted as

a reason for withholding them from the committee which has access

to secret documents ranging from assassination attempts to SALT

compliance. They are withheld because they are allegedly "recommen-

dations of advisers to former Presidents, made to them directly or to

the committees composed of their closest aides and counselors." Thus.

the claim is made, public documents become private communications

which qualify for the doctrine of Executive privilege.

If the State Department documents recommending covert action,

made to the National Security Council or the Forty Committee or its

predecessor constitute recommendations of advisers to Presidents, then

what government document doesn't become subject to similar claims of

Executive privilege? The State Department is not a department of

the United States Government under this assertion; rather, its em-

ployees are advisers to Presidents. State Department documents di-

rected to another agency of government have become recommendations

of advisers to Presidents, made to committees composed of their closest

sides and counselors. Thus, the National Security Council, created bi

Jongress throuch the Act of 1947 to be the chief advisory bodv'to th

President with respect to National Security affairs is reduced to a

group of the "closest aides and counselors."

The doctrine of Executive privilege to protect the privacy of Presi-

dential policy makino procedures is surely a sound one. But, to estend

it to a prior President vho did not assert it, to apply it to government

documents between governmental agencies, amounts to a claim of the

power of censorship that cannot be accepted, in my view.

I asked the representative of the Executive Branch who appeared

fore our committee. Mr. Scala, if there was another way to get &

court determination of the issue besides a contempt citation of the

Secretary of State. He replied that this was not an issue for the courts.

DISSENTING VIEWS OF REP. ROBERT MCCLORY

In the final sentence of his letter to the Select Committee dated No-

vember 19.

with which , he Parties of tur. The & States ired a si believe

"I believe

that the national interest is best served through our cooperation and

adoption of a spirit of mutual trust and respect." It is my earnest con-

tention that in this area of complex national security issues and in an

atmosphere of ongoing serious negotiations with the Executive Branch,

the Committee ought to have continued to work together with the

President to resolve remaining differences rather than follow the pre-

spitate route of voting a contempt citation against the chief foreign

affairs officer in this Administration at such a crucial time in world

events. As the President stated,

there'is a legitimate national interest

at stake here that ought to transcend all the recriminations, misunder-

standings, and personality conflicts which have brought the Commit-

tee to this unfortunate action.

The House Select Committee on Intelligence has been given one of

the most sensitive and important responsibilities which has faced the

Congress since World War II. It has been no easy task to pierce the

veil of secrecy which has surrounded the intelligence community's op-

erations since our nation became the most powerful country on earth—

and it has been more difficult still to come to grips with some of the

most fundamental questions at the heart of the operation of a secret

intelligence function in a democratic society. It I do say so, I believe

that the Select Committee, with the aid of unprecedented cooperation

on the part of the Ford Administration, has been conducting a cruci-

illy important investigation in a most honest and responsible manner

It is in this context of respect for the dedication and hard work o

the Committee that I must express my regret that the majority has

chosen to take the hasty and mistaken action of voting a contempt

resolution against the Secretary of State. In my opinion, the Commit-

tee has made an unfortunate and serious error in citing the Secretary

for contempt, and this resolution does not merit the support of the

full House of Representatives.

Secretary Kissinger ought not to have been cited in contempt for re-

fusing to surrender State Department documents for which the Preci.

dent of the United States has aserted a claim of executive privilege.

The Committee's subpoena to the Secretary sought "all documents re-

lating to State Department recommendino covert action made to the

National Security Council and the Forty Committee and its predeces.

sor committees from January 20, 1961 to the present.» After service of

the subpoena, the appropriate documents were identified and referred

to the White House for review. The Attorney General was asked to

carefully review these documents and rendered an opinion that erecn-

tive privilege could appropriately be asserted. By letter to the Secre-

ary dated Ñovember 14, 1975. the Counsel to the President confirmed

Therefore, prior to demanding possession of extremely sensitive

documents,

tem that will provide safeguards for the protection of these vital

national secrets. No such safeguards presently exist. Current House

House customs must be altered before closely held secrets can be prop-

In past Congresses, highly classified matters and extremely sensi-

tive situations have been handled by a few key members of Congress

on behalf of the entire body. Exposure of these vital national secrets

was very limited.

Beginning with the 93rd Congress, and accelerating rapidly in the

94th Congress, numerous "reforms" have drastically altered past prac

aces. While the new reforms have greatly increased individual mem-

ber participation in the legislative processes, these same reforms have

proportionately placed the nation in jeopardy concerning official

"leaking" any information to the press, re-

gardless of the security classification. There is no legal way tò prevent

an individual member from unilaterally releasing all or any part of

a floor speech. The wide diversity of opinions between individual Con-

gressmen makes this procedure dangerous to national security and

foreign relations.

We are left with the choice of accepting this claim of Executive privi-

lege or of citing the Secretary of State-two distasteful alternatives.

In my opinion,

claim, if allowed to stand unchallenged, can be extended and infinitum

to nearly all important government documents or officials which would

result in a complete destruction of the system of Congressional over-

sight. This claim, unchecked, makes the office of the President into a

monarchy.

The same assertion can be made (though it hasn't been) for CIA

documents to the National Security Council, going back to the incep-

tion of the agency. The same claim applies to Defense Department

recommendations; to Transportation Department recommendations to

this material is subject to the claim of Executive privilege, then Con-

past in this critical area. The right of Congress to participate in de-

cisions of utmost urgency would once again be emasculated. Obviously,

the Legislative Branch cannot allow this claim to go unchallenged.

Hopefully, a solution will be forthcoming, short of pursuing this

citation, but it must not be by Congressional acquiescence in this claim

of Executive privilege.

DISSENTING VIEWS OF THE HONORABLE

DALE MILFORD

A Constitutional confrontation between branches of this nation is a

very serious matter. As in any battle, there will be a loser. In this in-

stance, both sides could very possibly lose.

Public confidence, in a government's structure and its system is an

absolute necessity for the survival of a democratic regime. A Consti-

utional confrontation, brought about by a serious national need or as

& result of well-defined issues, can maintain or even build public con-

fidence. On the other hand, such a confrontation that is politically

very detiremental to this country's welfare.

Committee's request to interview Special Agent James W.

Awe regarding his participation on the U. S. Intelligence

Board Information Handling Committee.

In connection with this request, Special Agent Awe

was

interviewed in his office on 12/3/75 by House Select

Committee Staff Member, Tina Yamamotto.

She was specifically

interested in the nature of the Information Intelligence

Handling Committee (IHC) and its relationship to the

U.S: Intelligence

Board (USIB), the extent of FBI

participation in this committee, the value of the committee

and

whether it should be continued, and to determine if

there was any FBI objection to the fact that CIA serves

as chairman of the committee.

It was explained that IC was one of many

committees of USIB.

IHC has as its general mission the

promotion of effective interchange of Intelligence informa-

tion among the members of the Intelligence Community from

a records management point of view.

The Bureau's participa-

tion in the activities of IHC has been limited to the status

of observer with the exception of an effort by a Subcommittee

toward uniform application of procedures in the National

Agency Check Program. The committee has been of value to

the Bureau in that it allows the Bureau to keep in touch

with other records managers throughout the Intelligence

Community which provides ready access to information regard-

ing record problems, procedures, and status of records

HOUSTUDY

sharing of information regarding record problems, automation

efforts and the efforts toward certain data standards has

been and will continue to be important from cost effective

point of view for all the members which should result in

general economies

for the entire federal

government.

Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) also

serves as the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) fOr

the Intelligence Community.

For CIA to continue in this

capacity would seem appropriate and the FBI woula interpose

no objection, insofar as IHC committee activities are

concerned.

RECOMMENDATION:

For information.

Director Sac'y -

On 12/9/75, SA John M. Kirsch was interviewed

at the J. Edgar Hoover Building, Washington, D. C., by Mr. Timothy

Oliphant in the presence of SA Paul Daly. Mr. Oliphant who is representing

Congressman Pike's Committee inquired concerning social activities at

Harper's Ferry, West Virginia. SA Kirsch advised that he had attended

two such gatherings primarily composed of Bureau personnel (present and

former) during early 1974, the first such occasion being in January or

February and the second a few months later, probably April, 1974. In

response to Mr. Oliphant's question as to who invited SA Kirsch to attend

Harper's Ferry, he was advised that SA Kirsch attended at the invitation

of Assistant to the Director, Deputy Associate Director Thomas J. Jenkins

who was at that time Assistant Director in charge of Training Division.

Mr. Oliphant asked what the costs were for meals and lodging at Harper's

Ferry and SA Kirsch advised that at best he could recall the costs were

not excessive and probably $12 to $15 covered the entire affair. Certainly

no more than $20 was expended at either of the two outings by SA Kirsch. W

SA Kirsch did not recall exactly who collected for the meals but believes

it was probably Mr. John Mohr. Mr. Oliphant asked what the table stakes

were at Harper's Ferry and SA Kirsch advised that while he could not i he

recall specifically, he believed they were rather low, perhaps 10¢ and 25ç.

SA Kirsch was specifically asked if he had met Mr. Joe Tate

at which he replied that he had met him on one or two occasions but that he

wouldn't know Joe Tate if he met him on the street. He was then asked if

he knew Mr. Gus Oberdick. SA Kirsch advised that he has seen Mr. Oberdick

a half dozen occasions during the past 20 years and noted that Mr. Oberdick

was a friend of former SAC Henry Sloan e SA Kirsch stated that he did not

believe Gus Oberdick would know him if

were to see him on the street.

Mr. Oliphant asked if SA Kirsch had ever been assigned to the Administrative

arranged for the purchase of any law enforcement equipment from

Mr. Oberdick to which he replied no. Mr. Oliphant asked if SA Kirsch

had ever recommended any type of weapon or equipment be purchased

in the police line at which time he was advised that SA Kirsch had in fact,

as part of his duties, made recommendations for a variety of such purchases

over the past several years. He was advised that the only large purchase

of firearms with which SA Kirsch had anything to do was the acquisition of

military weaponry from the Department of Defense for use by FBI

Apprehension Teams.

states material in possession of a House Committee is accessible.

to all Congressmen in the House, since the material may not be

All indications are that captioned Committee will go out of

existence in January and the problem of access subsequent to the

• At 4:11 p.m. on November 21, Bryan Gettings, the

attorney representing Joe Tait of the U. S. Recording Company,

telephonically advised me that he and Mr. Tait appeared for interview

by staff of the captioned Committee concerning Tait's dealings with the

FBI. Mr. Gettings said that the interview was unproductive in that the

staff seemed to have very little basis for their questions. He said that

they did request delivery of Mr. Tait's records concerning Bureau

transactions pertaining to the Martin Kaiser Company. I told Mr. Gettings

that the Bureau was reviewing the records and that upon completion of the

review copies would be made of the appropriate excisions of sensitive

material,: Mr. Gettings requested that the original records; plus a set

of excised copies, be delivered to his office on Monday morning, November

(24, prior to 11:30 a,m., in order that he might haye the set of excised

copies for delivery to the staff representatives of captioned Committee.

I spoke with Assistant Director Cochran, advised him of

Mr. Gettings' request, and requested him to prepare the necessary copies

for delivery to Mr. Gettings.

I spoke with Assistant Director Bassett and explained to him

the arrangements I had made with the attorney for Mr. Tait and requested

him to provide for delivery of the original records, plus a set of excised

copies, to Mr. Gettings' öffice on Monday morning,-

November 24, prior to

BLACK PANTHOR PARTY

FORMERLY KNOWN AS THE BLACK PANTHER PARTY FOR SELF-DEFENSE

The Black Panther Party (BPP), organized in December,

1966, at Oakland, California, by Huey P. Newton and Bobby George

Seale, has the publicly-stated purpose of organizing black

people to take control of the life, politics and destiny of

the black community. The Party, operating the Black Panther

Intercommunal News Service, publishes a newspaper called

"The Black Panther," which at one time openly advocated the

use of guns and guerrilla tactics in a revolutionary program

to end the oppression of the black people but since early

1971 has spoken for a survival program pending revolution.

BPF national headquarters, aka Black Panther Intercom-

munal Headquarters, is located in Oakland, California.

While openly advocating direct overthrow of the

U. S. Government by force and violence until 1971, leaders

have since avoided extreme statements in favor of calling

for action within the established order. Newton, in an

interview appearing in the May, 1973, issue of "Playboy"

magazine, stated the Panthers'

chief

ambition is to change

the American Government by-any means necessary but that

ultimately such change will be through armed violence.

Despite its claimed dedication to community service,

indicators of the BPP's contimed attraction to violence persist.

Since July, 1974, Newton and other BPP members have been arrested

in Oakland, California, for threatening police officers,

murder of a 17-year-old female and the pistol whipping of

Newton's tailor. Newton failed to appear on these charges and

is now, a local fugitive. Additionally, one died and three

were wounded as a result of a shooting at a BPP-sponsored

dance in Oakland, California, in October, 1974.

SYMBIONESE LIBERATION ARMY

The Symbionese Liberation Army (SIA) was reportedly

formed in the Summer of 1973, in California. An SLA

document captioned,

"Declaration of Revolutionary War and

the Symbionese Program," dated 8/21/73, states "

• • • Therefore,

we of the Symbionese Federation of the

SIA. . . do now, by

the rights of our children and people and by force of arms

and with every drop of our blood, declare revolutionary war

against the fascist, capitalist class.

We support by

force of arms the just struggles of all oppressed people

for self-determination and independence within the

United States and the world, and hereby offer to all

liberation movements, revolutionary workers'

groups and

peoples' organizations our total aid and support for the

struggle for freedom and justice for all people

and races . . ."

the Sia has claimed credit for the 11/6/73 assassination of

DI. Marcus Foster, Oakland, California, School Superintendent;

the 2/4/74 kidnaping of Patricia Campbell Hearst, daughter

of newspaper publisher-owner Randolph A. Hearst; and the

4/15/74 robbery of the Hibernia Bank, San Francisco,

California, in the furtherance of its revolutionary

objectives.

Six members of the SLA were involved in a

shoot-out with the FBI and Los Angeles, California, police

on 5/17/74, resulting in their deaths.

Although no

current information has been developed indicating the

group has been active in areas other than California, other

groups and individuals have surfaced claiming adherence

to the SLA's revolutionary tenets.

NOTE:

The Fund For the Republic (FFR) was incorporated in

December, 1952. Today it is better known as the Center for the

Study of Democratic Institutions (CSDI), under which title it

has published its numerous studies throughout the years.

We

activities of the organization. Numerous individuals connected

with FFR have, in the past, had questionable associations with

persons or organizations suspected of having subversive affilia-

tions. From 1953 to 1955, we followed the projects and studies

of the FFR and kept the Attorney General advised of the back-

ground of the various officers and employees of the FFR. In

August, 1955, I. H. Ferry, the vice president of the FER, made

off eng

it known that the Fund intended to investigate the FBI and the

American Legion.

The Director, at that time, instructed that

a comprehensive memorandum be prepared on the FTR with background

data on the principal officers and that this memorandum be kept

up-to-date at all times. This running memorandum began as a

continuation of a monogram on the FFR prepared by the Central

Research Section in November, 1955. It was brought up-to-date

every three months since January 1, 1956, by the Liaison Section.

By memorandum July 14, 1958, it was pointed out that the memorandum

had become too cumbersome for Director Hoover's use and it vas

recommended and approved that it be discontinued. Many of the

memoranda dealt with the investigation of the FFR by the Internal

Revenue Service which had been going on for several years and

which concerned the eligibility of the Fund of the FTR as a

tax-exempt organization.

A thorough review of these volumes

concerning the FFR disclosed no active investigation of it by

the FBI.

It is noted that HSC Staff Member John Atkisson when

queried 11/12/75, as to the notivation behind this inquiry,

advised SA Thomas J. McNiff that an associate of his from California,

suggested to him that the HSC should look into the Bureau's

interest in CSDI, as the Bureau probably used the same investi-

gative techniques against CSDI as hasebeen publicly alleged in

the Bureau investigation of Institute for Policy Studies.

As a result of an agreement reached on November 12,

The CSDI has never been the subject of an investi-

other investigative techniques against this organization.

However, in the past we have gathered public source material

regarding it and have reviewed and researched pamphlets,

periodicals, surveys, and books promigated by it, when the

U. S. HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE

ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (HSC)

Reference is made to the hearings held on November 18, 1975,

before the U. S. House Select Committee on Intelligence Activities (HSC)

at which testimony was given by James B. Adams, Assistant to the Director-

Deputy Associate Director, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI); W. Raymond

Wannall, Assistant Director, Intelligence Division, FBI; and other FBI

representatives. The information set forth below is in response to specific

questions raised during the hearings.

One aspect of the hearings dealt with the FBi's investigative interest

in the Institute for Policy Studies (IPS). You asked Mr. Adams if a phone

call from your Administrative Assistant to IPS was intercepted and recorded

by the FBI. You specifically referred to information attributed to a source,

WE T-4, which appeared in a document labeled WEO 100-46784.

from a review of our file, it was determined the symbol, WI T-4,

was used in this instance to designate a one-time retrieval of some IPS

trash abandoned by a trash truck at a Washington, D. C., sanitary dunip on

August 23, 1972. The recovered trash included carkon typewriter ribbons,

from which information was subsequently transcribed. The actual

transcription from one ribbon read as follows:

"Nirs. Woolbert of Congressman Pike's office was asked by

Byron Johnson to call you. He is running for the 5th Congressional District

of Congress. He wonders it you will be willing to go around and round up a

group of liberal, anti-war folks for the evening of August 6-12th. She expects

Dep. AD Am. - you to call her when you get back. "

U. S. House Select Committee on Intelligence Activities (HSC)

You requested information concerning attacks by the IPS on the

FBI mentioned in the document labeled WFO 100-40784.

Information responsive to your inquiry is contained in pages

2 thraugh & of the report of our Washington Field Office entitled "Institute

for Policy Studies, 1520 New Hampshire Avenue, N. W., Washington, D. C.;

IS - REVACT," dated March 15, 1973. A copy of this report was furnished

to the HSC by letter dated November 14, 1975. As the information is already

available to you and is classified "Confidential," it is not being submitted

herewith for inclusion in the public record.

Congressman Delluras inquired as to the FBI's basis for the

investigation of the IPS. He asked if the FBI's investigative interest in

IPS was based on an association between IPS and "Ramparts" magazine,

rather than to determine the degree of association between IPS and the

Students for a Democratic Society (EDS).

Washington Their stige one FS base upon da ormation set forth in the

communication dated June 19, 1968, from the New York Office of the FBI.

This communication, captioned "Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), "

contained information from a source who had furnished reliable information

in the past that on May 27, 1968, Arthur I. Waskow of IPS, Washington,

D. C., had contacted Jeff Jones of the New York Regional Office of SDS.

Waskow reportedly advised Jones that his name had been included among

50 young, intelligent, leitist militants recommended to attend a three-day

meeting of the Foreign Folicy Association (FPA) at the New York Filton

Hotel, New York City, on May 27-29, 1908.

The source expected members of SDS to attend and possibly

attempt to dominate the meetings.

The investigation of IPS was initiated to determine its association

with SDS and what, if any, influence the New Left, of which SDS was an

integral part, had on the FPA.

U. S. House Select Committee on Intelligence Activities (HSC)

Later in October of 1968, the Baltimore FBI Office reported

information relating to a 1908 trip to Cuba by SDS members. "Paparts"

magazine was preparing an article, with some apparent cooperation from

IPS, on this trip by SDS members.

Consequently, FBI Headquarters sent

instructions on November 1, 1968, to appropriate field offices to determine

if there was a relationship between "Ramparts" and IPS, inasmuch as both

had demonstrated an interest in SDS.

In response to the inquiry of Congressman McClory, there are

currently 110 members of the Socialist Workers Party (SWP) on the

Administrative Index (ADEX).

In discussing the FBI inquiry concerning Lori Faton, Congressman

Johnson asked when the inquiry stopped and how long it took to establish that

Miss Paton was a high school student. At subsequent points both you and

Congressman Basten made similar inquiries regarding this matter.

Miss Paton first came to the attention of the FBI in mid-February,

1973, when her name and address were obtained from a legal mail cover

on the headquarters of the SWP, New York City. This information was

torwarded by letter dated February 28, 19%5, to our Newark Ortice for the

purpose of identifying her and determining whether any further inquiry vas

warranted. The Newark Office reviewed its indices and contacted established

confidential sources in an effort to determine the reason for her contact with

the SWP. These inquiries proved negative. On March 22, 1973, Newark

opened an individual case on Miss Paton and requested a further inquiry at

Chester, New Jersey, to determine her identity and whether she was involved

in subversive activities. On March 28, 1973, inquiries were made by our

Resident Agent at Chester, New Jersey, with the local credit bureau and

the Chief of Folice, which indicated Miss Faton had probably graduated

from the local high school. Later on this same date, our Resident Agent

contacted the principal and vice principal at the high school and determined

that she was in fact still a student there and had probably contacted the SWP

in regard to one of her school courses. No further inquiries were made

regarding Miss Paton. The Resident Agent, in the normal course of his

business, dictated and forwarded to his Newark headquarters the results of

his inquiry in a memorandum dated April 2, 1973. The Newark case Agent

routinely reviewed the information from the Chester Resident Agent,

recommended closing, and on May 7, 1973, the case was officially closed.

The above information concerning Miss Paton is furnished for

inclusion in the transcript of the hearings concerning FBI surveillance

activities, November 18, 1975, at line 19, page 4165.

It is requested that all of the above information be made a part

of the official record of the November 18, 1975, hearings.
