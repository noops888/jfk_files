The Attorney General

NOTE:

By memorandum from Mr. W. R. Wannall to Mr. J. B. Adams,
dated 10/16/75, captioned as above, approval was obtained for transmittal
of a preliminary response, dated 10/17/75, to Congressman Pike's request
for FBI views on the future of the intelligence community. In our preliminary
response, we indicated that our views would be furnished at an early date
following consultation with appropriate FBI personnel.

Since transmittal of our 10/17/75 preliminary response, we have
learned that the heads of other member-agencies of the intelligence community
have received a similar request from the Congressman. In addition, we have
been informed that the Attorney General has met with White House officials
and determined that it would not be appropriate for us to make specific
recommendations in response to the Congressman's letter. The communication
to Congressman Pike attached for the Attorney General's approval sets forth
general observations on the future of the intelligence community and is
responsive both to the Congressman's inquiry and to the Attorney General's
determination that our reply should avoid specific recommendations.

U.g. RECORDING COMPANY

At 10:47 a.m. on January 5, 1976, Joseph Leo Gormley,
formerly employed in the FBI Laboratory, advised that he retired June 30,
1973, and currently is employed at IACP, telephone number 948-0922, Ext, 248.

Mr. Gorniky said that he was contacted by Richard Vermeire
of the House Intelligence Committee who requested him to be available for an
interview this afternoon concerning FBI purchases from the U.S. Recording
Company. He told me that he had no personal knowledge of such purchases
and he requested advice from the Bureau as to his response to Vermeire.

I told Mr. Gormley that he should consider himself relieved of
the obligation of any secrecy agreement he may have signed with the FBI
for purposes of the interview with Vermeire concerning the subject matter
indicated. I told him that should the interview concern other matters, he
should be aware that he is not being relieved of the obligation to protect the
identities of confidential informants, not interfere with pending investigations,
not disclose information obtained from third party sources, and not disclose
sensitive investigative techniques. I also told Mr. Gormley that should the
| proposed interview appear to require the advice of counsel to assist him, such
could be made available upon his request. He indicated that because he has Nl
no pexsonal knowledge of the U.S. Recording Company or the Bureau’s =
purchasing practices, he felt that he had no need to request counsel at this

time. Sill REESE GaA_ Wo ¥he/ - el

By letter dated 10/20/75, received at the Bureau
11/4/75 (copy attached}, the House Select Committee (HSC)
requested that it be furnished with copies of all materials
contained in FBI files pertaining to the shooting of
Kenyon F. Ballew in Silver Spring, Maryland, on 6/7/71.
This shooting occurred when representatives of the Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms Division and local police officers
broke into the Ballew apartment with a warrant charging
Ballew with unregistered possession of firearms and explosives,
As a result of the incident, Ballew was wounded and suffered

a crippling injury. He filed suit against the Government

and the Civil Rights Division of the Department requested

this Bureau to conduct what amounted to a minimal amount of
investigation in this matter.

On 11/12/75, Special Agent (SA) Thomas J. McNiff,
after a conference with SAs Paul V. Daly, Legal Counsel
Division, and John J. Boyd, General Investigative Division,
discussed the propriety of the above request with Steven
Blackhurst, Deputy Special Counsel for Intelligence Coordination,
Department of Justice, as the request did not appear to fall
within the HSC mandate as outlined in H. R. 591, Bhackhurs

~ oncurred with the above observation and stated he would iN

Attached is a letter from the House Select Committee

October 28, 1975. Apparently the HSC is interested
primarily in reviewing materials developed as a result
of an FBI investigation into this matter which was done
at the request of the Civil Rights Division of the
Department. The HSC also wants to know what documents,
if any, have been turned over to Mr. Ballew or his

this or as the result of a Freedom of Information Act
request. If you have questions concerning an appro-

By memorandum dated 12/19/75 to. the Attorney General, wa
advised the Department of Justice that we were opposed to furnishing
captioned Committee information concerning proprietaries- in response
to their letter of 12/1/75, since ‘they are on-going Bureau.operations.
We further advised the Department that we had afforded the ‘Comniittee
a briefing concerning these operations in as detailed a mariner as-
possible without compromising. the operations.

On 12/30/75 at the request of Rex Lee, Assistant Attorney
General of the Civil Division of the Department; Deputy Assistant
Director Fred Fehl; SA John McHale; Section Chief William O- Cregar;
and SA Paul V. Daly met with Mr. Lee, his assistant Thomas Martin ja
and Assistant Special Counsel for Intelligence Coordination Steven’ be
Blackhurst concerning. the captioned Committee's request for info:
mation pertaining to proprietaries.

It was brought to Mr. Lee's ‘attention at that time of
the Bureau's concern relative to the disclosure of the requested
information to. captioned Committee and of the Bureau's position
that the information requested should not be furnished. It was
pointed out :to Mr. Lee that such disclosure might adversely impact
on the on-going sensitive operations of the Bureau and create un-
necessary risks. to the physical well-being of Bureau Agents and
informants: and with regard to the prop: ietaries operating in the
criminal field, jeopardize prosecutidns'. S

Mr. Lee explained that he was sympatifts to the Bureau's
position; however, Mike Duval at the White House had instructed
him to attempt to reach ‘some acconitydddation concerning this request.
According to Mr. Lee, this was. prompted by a conéern at the White

RE: HOUSTUDY —

agreement with the President concerning the publication by. that
Committee of material in their possession of a sensitive nature.

The aforementioned agreement allows for. the President to certify

the necessity. that a particular document or particular information
not be published and the Committee would abide by that certification.
The Committee, in conversations with representatives at the White
House, had cited two areas where Executive Branch responses had not
been acceptable one of which was. the Bureau's response concerning
proprietaries.

Mr. Lee concluded the meeting by indicating he would
contact a representative of the House Select Committee and attempt
to extract an agreement as to the matter and type of information
which would be given to that Committee without giving to the Com~-
mittee information with which they might be able to identify the
proprietary in question. He stated that if this was not acceptable
with ‘the Committee, he would at that point refuse the Committee's
request.

On 12/31/75, Thomas Martin telephonically advised SA
Paul V. Daly of this Division that Mr. Lee had contacted Aaron
Donner and that Donner appreciated the Bureau's concerns relative
to furnishing information on the proprietaries. Donner also in-
dicated that they would seek to keep such information from
Committee members. Martin stated that Mr. Lee agreed to furnish
the Committee a financial balance sheet showing income, assets,
and liabilities (the balance sheet should go back no more than
five years and if the original balance ‘sheets would disclose the
operation in question, a sanitized balance sheet would be prepared);
the original amount of money used to create the proprietary and the
source of same; and evidence of compliance with state and/or Federal
laws.

With regard to the latter, if the information concerning
compliance with state and/or Federal laws would expose the operation
in question, Martin stated we should so advise the Department so

that a decision might be made as to what disclosure,.if any, would
be made concerning this material. He was asked whether the Committee

was seeking access or delivery of the material in question. It
was pointed out to Martin that the Committee indicated access
might be sufficient for the Committee's needs. Martin stated he
would check on this particular question and advise the Bureau of
the answer. Martin subsequently advised that the Bureau should
provide access to but not delivery of the material.

Additionally, Martin stated that ree, Committee desired
the requested information by delivery*6n ‘Monday , 1/5/76. It was”
explained to Martin that it may not be possible to gather and
furnish ‘the information requested by. that time.

ADDENDUM BY SPECIAL INVESTIGATIVE DIVISION: 1/2/76 FCF:dlb

The Special Investigative Division is of the definite opinion
the following points should be enumerated and brought to the attention
of the Director:

At the meeting which was held in the office of Assistant
Attorney General Rex Lee on the morning of December 30, 1975, Lee
commenced by advising that he would attempt to explain his complete
lack of knowledge of the situation. Deputy Assistant Director Fehl
then inquired of Lee as to whether or not he had reviewed the Director's
letter to the Attorney General dated December 19, 1975, captioned
"United States House Select Committee on Intelligence Activities, ' and
Lee said he had not seen the letter. In brief, the Bureau's position
in the letter of December 19, 1975, very clearly stated to the Attorney
General that we have again reviewed this particular matter and feel that
a disclosure of information concerning an on-going Bureau operation
is not appropriate. We told the Attorney General we stood ready to,
of course, furnish information pertinent to discontinued proprietary
operations which would offer the Committee a chance to see the procedures
used by the Bureau in establishing and maintaining such operations. The
Attorney General was also advised that the Committee was afforded a
briefing concerning these operations in as detailed a manner as possible.

Several months ago, Peter Hughes, a staff member of the
Committee, was apprised in most general terms concerning the Bureau's
proprietaries (organized crime matters) at which time Hughes advised
that he was completely satisfied and had no further questions. Hughes
exhibited surprise at the nominal amount of dollars the FBI had expended
as compared to CIA operations.

The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities
requested information concerning on-going Bureau operations and was
advised this data would not be furnished. Church's committee made
no further demands on the Bureau.

At the conference on December 30, 1975, Lee was advised
we did not feel that the matters being handled by the Special Investigative
Division were within the confines of the charter of the House Committee.
He was told that we were not gathering "intelligence" but rather we were
conducting criminal investigations looking toward prosecutive action in
U. S. District Courts. He said he understood and also said he would
review the charter. There is no indication in this memorandum that Lee
has in fact reviewed the charter.



: Lee was advised that the Bureau had no objection to discussing
the discontinued operations and we mentioned specifically those wherein
we had a small proprietary interest with LEAA. An example was given
to Lee of an undercover operation in New York wherein, due to loose talk,
an informant was murdered gangland style (Operation Flyer).

Lee discussed as an alternate, our preparing "sanitized balance
sheets" of the on-going operations. He was told by representatives of the
Special Investigative Division thatthis could well raise a question and pin-
point possible dates of the institution of the operation and most likely
the Committee would then request the back-up books and records to sub-
stantiate the balance sheets. Deputy Assistant Director Fehl told Lee
in no uncertain terms that prior to the time that we would make any
disclosure of any matter whatsoever, the Bureau would close down any
of its on-going current operations. The well-being and safety of the
Bureau Agents waS and is of paramount importance; therefore, any
disclosure would necessitate a discontinuance and we would so advise
the Department.

Of the three proprietary interests, one has been discontinued;
however, the informant still resides and is active in the locale of the
preprietary. Further, off-shoot investigations are being conducted of
the discontinued operation. The second operation has been discontinued;
however, we are in the process of obtaining indictments and prosecution
is, of course, pending. The third operation is on-going and we contem-
plate reaching our ultimate objective within the next sixty days.

In view of the above observations, the Special Investigative
Division strongly recommends the following:

(1) That we do not disclose any information whatsoever to
Assistant Attorney General Rex Lee for access or review by the Committee
on our on-going undercover operations.

(2) That a representative of the Special Investigative Division
discuss this matter with Assistant Attorney General Thornburgh, Criminal
Division, who has the responsibility of the pending prosecutive action in these
matters, so that he, Thornburgh, has an opportunity for input into furnishing
data to the Committee.

Section Chief William Harward of the Laboratory Division
who. had previously been cleared to give a deposition to represen-

tatives of the House Select Committee appeared for a deposition in
that Committee's space on 11/11/75.

During the course of his interview which pertained to
the U.S. Recording Company and the utilization by the Bureau of
other companies. in a similar fashion, i.e. cutout purchases, he
did not respond to a question as. to what other companies he knew
of which ‘this Bureau dealt with indirectly. through the U.S. Re-
cording Company., Harwatd indicated to the Committee representatives -
that these compshies ‘are confidential sources of this Bureau. Sub-
sequently, Harwand advised SA Paul V. Daly of this Division that he
could recall: five companies which furnished the Bureau equipme) t
through the U.S?Recording Company--namely, General Teledyne,,
and Howell, Custom Electric, Knowles Microphone and Northeas;
Electronics. The aforementioned companies furnished the yh
equipment such ~ was ag, 1 recorders, transmitters and a the Bye ones.

By way of “background, the guidelines for interviews for
this Committee have followed the guidelines we have utilized with
the Senate Select Committee in which a current or former employee
need not respond to questions in four separate categories: (1)
information provided by sources (or any other information) which

| might tend to identify a confidential source; (2) information con-_ ,~|

cerning sensitive investigative techniques; (3) information derived
from other Government agencies, including information from foreign
intelligence sources; and (4) any information the disclosure of

which ‘could adversely affect ongoing investigations. While unlike
the Senate Select Committee, we have no written agreement to the
aforementioned categories but the House Select Committee has not
resisted thus far on our placing limitations on the information

Legal Counsel to Mr. Adams
RE: HOUSTUDY —

Harward did not respond to the question relating. to.
companies. dealing through the U.S. Recording Company with ‘the
Bureau because he felt that we were dealing with ‘a confidential
source and he could not disclose the identity of same. He in-
dicated that it could be determined by. the name of the particular
company what type of equipment this Bureau was purchasing, thereby
disclosing a sensitive technique. This information is protected
by. the guidelines.

On 11/11/75, Richard Vermeire, Staff Member of captioned
Committee, who participated in the interview of Harward was. tele-
phonically contacted by SA Daly and it was explained to him the
reason for the reluctance of the Bureau to furnish the names of

. the companies. Instead, SA Daly offered to give him a numerical

response as. to: the companies, a generic description of the company -
and the reason for not disclosing the particular information.
vermeire explained that he ‘could not accept the alternative response.
He volunteered that Chairman Otis Pike and another unnamed Congress~
man were very much interested in this particular matter and that

it would be necessary for the Committee to have the requested
information.

. Vermeire stated that Chairman Pike was. concerned that
there may be some improprieties involved in this matter and
indicated hé would make all the inquires necessary. to resolve

. this matter. Vermeire stated that because of Chairman Pike's

interest he was receiving. considerable pressure from the Com-
mittee to obtain the necessary information for the Committee
to. make a determination as. to whether improprieties existed.

As an alternative, it was suggested to Vermeire that
he might wish ‘to. submit a written request asking for the in-
formation and the Bureau could address. that aspect. Vermeire
stated he would not do this. He indicated he wanted the response
from Harward in response to the question asked during. the deposition
and that as. the Bureau maintained these companies were confidential
sources. that matter would have to be resolved by. the Committee as
to whether they might pursue ait further. Every indication from

. the conversation with Vermeire indicated the Committee would

pursue this particular aspect further.

Legal Counsel to Mr. Adams
RE: HOUSTUDY

If it is determined we should not respond to this ©
particular question because these companies enjoy a con-
_fidential relationship and/or the disclosure of the requested
information would jeopardizé a sensitive technique, a letterhead
memorandum to. that effect should be prepared and furnished to the
Attorney General with ‘a copy. to the Deputy Attorney General by
. cover. letter for the Department's forwarding. to. the Committee.
It should be kept in mind that our failure to furnish ‘the re-
quested information in the deposition does. not mean the Committee
would not receive the information in some other fashion. What we”
are addressing in this particular memorandum is. the fact that we
do not want the information furnished by Section Chief Harward as ~
part of his. deposition. Additionally, consideration should be
" given to the fact that by refusing to furnish ‘this particular
information we may highlight this aspect of the House Select
Committee inquiry to Chairman Pike and he may draw unwarranted
conclusions.

To. date. we have, of course, been scheduled for only
one day of FBI hearings by. that Committee and there are in-
dications. that this Bureau will not be a major target for the
Committee. Our refusal to furnish ‘the requested information
could, of course, direct additional attention to the Bureau.

RECOMMENDATION:

That ‘the Laboratory Division in conjunction with ‘the
Intelligence Division should expeditiously prepare the letterhead
memorandum with ‘a cover. letter to the Attorney General with a copy
to. the Deputy Attorney General advising the Committee of our re-
fusal and explaining same if * should decide not to furnish ‘the
information. (*the Laboratory)

Dear - Shaheen:

Pursuant to a meeting between Mr. Hotis and Mr. Daley of the F.B.I.,and
Ms. Ellen Miller of our staff, we are hereby resubmitting our Oct.
3, 1975 request for materials relating to certain FBI informants.

As. was discussed at that meeting, our staff has agreed to cooperate
with the Bureau's suggested procedures in obtaining information
relating to the informants listed below on the case by case basis.
The agreement reached involves the following procedures: 1) submission
of names with specific reference to the material needed by the
Committee; 2) a request by the FBI to each of the individuals in-
volved requesting. permission for the release of such information in
the cases where the former informant status is not public information;
and 3) immediate access to information on the individuals in cases
where the former. informant status is public information. We hope
that these procedures will not be too cumbersome and that the in-
formation will be forthcoming.

Therefore, we hereby request access to all notes,memoranda, files, and
reports pertaining to the former FBI informants listed below:

Alfred Burnett-Seattle bombings

Jeff Desmond~-Seattle bombings

David Sannes~-Seattle bombings

Horace Parker--Seattle court house damage
Thomas Mosher--Stanford Univ. Anti-war movement

U. S, HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (HSC)

NOTE: CONFIDENT IA

ALL of the above 16 individuals are known to this
Bureau. Six individ als, Alfred Burnett, Jeff Desmond,
David Sannes, Eustacio (Frank) Martinez, Charles R. Grimm
and Pablo Manuel Fernandez, were never FBIHQ approved
informants although allegations to that effect have been
publicized in the past. Nine individuals, Horace Parker,
Thomas Mosher, Boyd Douglas, Larry Grantwohl, Emerson Poe,
George Demmerle, Lawrence Goff, Momlaung Singhata Thomas
Tongyai N'ayondlya and Terrence B. Norman, were Bureau
informants, whose confidential relationships with this
Bureau haye become public knowledge either through giving
testimony or because of irresponsible actions on their part.

Requested material apppropriately excised concerning
the above two categories of informants is being made
available to the HSC. These individuals are not being
notified by this Bureau of HSC interest in their activities
as the informant reports themselves are not being furnished
and the information concerning the specified activity hag
appeared in the mass media.

With regard to Carl Becker, this individual in
8/73 testified at the VVAW trial in Tallahassee, Florida,
Since 7/72, because of his subversive and extremist contacts,
he continued to furnish valuable information to the New Orleans
office, and is currently operated by the New Orleans Office
as a confidential source, If this communication is approved,
New Orleans will be advised that the HSC was furnished an
excised summary of Becker's relationship with this Bureau up to
and indluding the time of his testimony and no information
was volunteered concerning his current status, New Orlenns
will be instructed to so notify Becker and advise him to be
guided accordinfly in the event he is contacted by
representatives of HSC. He will. also be instructed to
immediately furnish his contacting Agent the results of any
such contact,

Above mentioned pertinent material concerning
Sannes, Grimm, Norman, Grantwohl and N'ayondlya has been
previously made available to the SSC in response to a
similar request from that committee. Documents being made
available contain only information concerning specific
areas of interest to the HSC with regard to these 16 individuals.

~"* “By Grr Kelly
Washington Star Staif Writer

The House intepigéhce
Committee has called in
Internal Revenue Service
agents and General Ac-
counting Office auditors ‘to
help in a potentially explo-
sive investigation of the
housekeeping side of the

Until the now investiga-
tion was started, both
House and Senate select
comrnitiees on intelligence
had been focusing on past
misdeeds of the intelligence
and investigative arms of
the bureau — especially the
Bt r effort to disrupt the
activities of a variety of
suspected do:nestic subver-
sive organizations.

But now the committee is
zeroing in on the other side
of the bureau’s operations
and asking whether there
has been Nnancial corrup-
tion within the bureau —
and whether itexists today.

WHILE THE FBI's mis-
deeds in the area of intelli-

ence and investigations

ave largely involved men
who are retired or dead, the
new investigation reaches
into an area of the bureau's
operations that has supplied
all of the top officials who,
working directly under FBI

* Director Clarence M. Kel-

Jey, now run the bureau.
The House committee’s
interest in the business and
financial side of the FBI
began this fall when Martin
Kaiser, who makes 480 dif-
ferent kinds of “electronic

* widgets,” as he calls them,

at a plant in Cockeysville,
Md., and sells them to a
variety of American and
foreign police and intelii-
gence agencics~toid the
committee about an ob-
scure Washington firm
eel as U.S. Recording
"0.

Kaiser told the commiit-

- , tee he had signed up the bu-

reau as a customer in the
late 1960s~Lywriting to J.
Edgar Hoover and describ-
ing some devices he had in-
vented to detect telephone
taps and. other kinds of
electronic surveillance
bugs. The late FB! chief
was so impressed, Kaiser
said, that ne invited him in
for a personal meeting.

: Shortly afterward, Kaiser
said in an interview, he
began getting orders
through U.S. Recording Co.
He said he Gropped by the
firm’s warehouse-like
building at_1247 South Capi-
tol St. and met Joseph X.

Tait, the president, but
never did Bet past thefront
loor.

KAISER SAID it quickly
became apparent to him
that U.S. Recording was
simply serving as a front
for the ‘FBI. Committee
investigators have now
found U.S. Recording also
has served as a similar
front for CIA and White
House purchases, although
Kaiser said his sales to
other government agencies
were made directly rather
than through a front.

So, Kaiser-saidy he began
making deliveries direct!
to the bureau, even thougi
the paperwork. and pay-
ments went through U.S.
Recording. But even that
worried him, he said, he-
cause it is iNegal to sell
surveillance equipment to
anyone except a law en-
forcement agency. Techni-
cally, the deal with U.S.
pecording was illegal even

ough the equipment was
being delivered directly to
the bureau. :

++ NW-68262 Docld:32989696 Page 40

The law permits agencies
‘such as tl

FBI to buy
avithaut” competitive Bits
through front companies so
it will be more difficult for -
foreign intelligence agents
to find out what kind of
equipment U.S. agencies

are using and to devise |

countermeasures to such
equipment. But that stil
leaves a problem with the
law limiting sales of bugs.

Kaiser said he became
more suspicious one day
when he.was visiting an
FBI office and saw an in-
voice from U.S. Recording
for equipment he had deliv-
ered to the bureau showing
a 30 percent markup.

ALTHOUGH atterneys
for the cormpany_have re-
portedly told the committee
that ‘the markup averaged
only about 12 percent to
cover handling of the

aperwork, GAO auditors
fave found the markup ran
about 25 to 30 percent, com-
pared with a reasonable
figure for the work involved
of about 5 to 10 percent, ac-
cording to committee
sources. i

When Kaiser first came The Washington iter a
to the committee, what he Washington Star-News
had to say seemed to in--peily News (New York)

volve, at most, a relatively

minor problem. Even a 25 The New York Times
percent markup on the The Wall Street Journal

amount when spread over a

.But the GAO auditors
have now determined, ac-
cording to committee
‘sources, that U.S. Record-
ing’s business with the bu-
Teau ran about $750,000 a
year. A 25 percent markup
‘on that amount would come
«to $187,500 a year.
“Where did all that money
BO? eenpemeas

TO FIND OUT, internal
revenue agents are running
“net worth” checks on Tait,
the president of U.S.
Recording, and some past
and.present bureau officials
who have been involved in
the administrative side of
the bureau, according to
committee sources. In a
“net worth’ check, the
agents establish a person’s
net worth at one time, then
determine it at a later time
and then ask the person’ to
account for the difference
in the two figures,

The dominant figure in
,the administrative area of
the bureau’s operations for
‘a decade and~a—half. was
John P. Mohr, who retired
three years age as the top
administrative official in
the bureau. Last week, ac-.
cording to committee
sources, Mohr refused to
give a statement to com-
-mitiee investigators under
oath. 7
Men who were closely as-
sociated with Mohr now
dominate the upper eche-
lens of the bureau hier-
archy, with the exception of
Kelley himself. Nicholas
Callahan is the top aide to
Kelley. Thomas Jenkins is
the associate director in
charge of the administra-
tive side of things — the job
Mohr had-at-tae-time of his
retirement. James Adams
has switched over to the
_ investigative side of the bu-
reau and is wow Jenkins’
‘counterpart responsible for
that phase of bureau opera-
tions. peeeec!

‘ WHEN QUESTIONS
were first raised about the
relationship between U.S.
Recording and the bureau,
Atty. Gen. Edward M. Levi
asked Kelley to investigate.

” The official in charge of the
investigation is Harold N.
Bassett, the assistant direc-

“tor in charge of the inspec-
tion division. Bassett, who
was @ close asscciate of
Mohr’s, is one of only two
assistant directors who re-
port directly to Callahan.

According to committee

” sources, Tait said, when

called up for questioning by
the cOifimitiee staff, that he
had talked beforehand with
Callahan. His advice, Tait
reportedly said, was-to “tell
the truth.” | Sannee

The close personal rela-
tionship between Mohr and
Tait first came to public
attention earlier this year
when Mohr gave 2 deposi-
tion in a lawsuit. Mohr, who
is the executor of the estate
of Clyde Tolson, for many

years the top aide fo Hoo-°

ver, is being sued by Tol-
son’s brother. 7

Mohr volunteered a list of
38 men — including top effi-
cials of both the FBI and
CIA — who had taken part
in marathon poker games
at the Blue Ridge Lodge,
- located in Virginia and not
far from Harper's Ferry,
W.¥a.
“We played draw poker,
five-card stud, seven-card
stud. Nothing wild,” he
said, Another former bu-
reau official said it was not
unusual for the winners to
take home $I50 and the
losers to go home that
much poorer.

MOHR NAMED “fait as
ore of these who took part
in the games, and coramit-
tee investigators have since
learned that he was the one
who arranged for the pcker
weekends. Although Tait
and others who attended the
poker sessions have told the
committee tiey-paid their
own way, one goal of the
GAO avditors is to trace the
individual payments to
make surc that U.S.
“‘kecording or Tait did not
pick up the tab,

and examine its records,
they found that the lodge

before... But the records
were not lost, and local .
investigators have blamed
the blaze on ‘an electrical

At this point the commit-
tee’ investigators have
many more questions than
they have answers. The
significance of the investi-
ation is that the questions
they are asking are the kind

Dear Congressman Dellums:

This is in response to your Letter to me dated
September 29, 1975, which was received on Octeber 7, 1975,

To elarify your inquiries, it should be noted the
Resident Agency at Berkeley, Californian, operates uder the
general supervision of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's
Sen Francisco Office, :

The complement of Special Agents assigned to the
Berkeley Resident Agency is consistent with need in that
portion of the territory for which our San Francisco Field
Office is responsible. The assignment of personnel to the
Berkeley Resident Agency is in proportion to that of areas
of similar sine and of like metropolitan composition.

The FBI applies a positive program aimed at cir-
culating opportunities in the FBI for members of minority
groups and attracting those who are Interested and qualified.
Our positive program, which receives guidance through the
Bureau's Office of Equal Employment Opportunity Affairs at
our Headquarters in Washington, D. C., is applied by the
Special Agents in Charge of our 59 field offices and their
staffs. Uhile we do not have any minority or female Special
Agents headquartered in Berkeley, we do have Special Agents
of various minorities, including Blacks, Hispanics and
Orientals, and fomale Special Agents assigned to our
San Frenciseo Offiee and they are available for assignment
wherever the need may arise including in Berkeley.

Honorable Ronald V. Dellums

Based on a survey during March, 1975, the San Francisco

Office was devoting under 20 percent of its time to domestic
intelligence (internal security) matters. This survey did
not break down the allocation of manpower below the field
office level.

The Special Agent in Charge of every FBI field
office is responsible for the use of the manpower in his
office. He has the authority to deploy specially trained
personnel as necessary. Our Apprehension Teams, which have
as their objectives the enforcement of laws within our juris-
dietion and the protection of lives, may be used in FBI
cases in which the risk of danger to human life is greater
than normal. When we have jurisdiction, the decision of how
best to respond is ours alone. We do not anticipate any
conflict with state or local law enforcement agencies in
this regard.

By “black bag" operations I assume you mean sur-
reptitious entries. Since the matter is being reviewed by
the Department of Justice, it would be inappropriate for me
to discuss it.

Sincerely yours,

On 12-10-75 the House Select Committee heard testimony
from RogeFischer (phonetic), Professor of Law, Harvard
University; former Attorney General NicholaS~deF zenbach ;
and McGeor' undy. The major topic of discussion was covert
operations abYtad.

t

\“

Of particular interest to the Bureau was a question

by Representative Morgan Murphy to Mr. Katzenbach. Mr. Murphy
asked what Mr. Katzenbach would recommend in the way of

controls of the FBI other than Congressional oversight.

Katzenbach suggested limiting the term of the Director, tightening
electronic surveillance legislation, requiring specific authorj-
| zation to investigate groups and creating administrative or lp ae
legislative procedures which would grant the Attorney Genera

more power to review FBI activities; for example, giving a
prosecuting Government attorney access to FBI files. wa

Congressman Murphy asked if the FBI requested
local police departments to conduct illegal wiretaps and
thereafter received from the local police information gained
from those taps. Katzenbach responded that he did not know
the answer to that question. He said he suspected it took
place, but the FBI never told him about that. Later, Congressman
Philip Hayes asked Katzenbach, in effect, if he suspected it
took place why he didn't do-something. Katzenbach responded ‘
that on occasion he did make inquiry but the FBI told him it
as. not done. Katzénbach stated one should remember the. e==>

Statement by McGeorge Bundy

House Select Committee on Intelligence
December 10, 1975

Mr. Chairman:
It is a pleasure to respond to your invitation to appear before this
Committee for a general discussion of the disadvantages and advantages of

covert operations conducted by the Central Intelligence Agency. In this brief

- opening statement I confine myself to a few propositions. I have stated them with-

out detailed defense and elaboration, and often in quite tentative form, because I
believe the questions presented are not simple and the answers that will be right

in the future are not easy to determine sharply today. Moreover, like many other
citizens I am still learning from the extraordinary revelations of recent months;

it has been particularly painful to learn for the first time of many things that
happened while I was myself in government.. I should also emphasize that for nearly
ten years I have been unconnected with this field and have Fey to it that there was
no connection whatever between the Ford Foundation and any secret government
agency. ae
This statement does not address particular episodes, except for a few

that are clearly on the record already, and for two contrasting reasons. Those which
I did know about in government are not matters which I yet feel free to discuss publicly
in detail, and those which have happened at other times are matters on which I do

not have first-hand or authoritative knowledge. In any case I think it may be more

useful for your purpose to try to suggest a limited number of broad notions.

CAPE LEY - 2-35
EXBLaSHDE!



First and foremost, the general presumption, in considering covert action,
should in peacetime be against it. To put the point sharply, the general record of
the last twenty years suggest that only too often the covert activities of the United
States government have cost us more than they were worth. There are notable ex-
ceptions, and they may give some guidance as to the kinds of exceptions which wet ‘
be wise in the future, but the general proposition seems-to me a strong one.

This ospoeitien: if it is correct, has a very important consequence for
the management and control of such operations. While in principle it has always
been the understanding of senior government officials outside the CIA that no covert
operations would be undertaken without the explicit approval of "higher authority, "
there has also been a general expectation within the agency that it was its proper
business to generate attractive proposals and to stretch them, in operation, to the
furthest limit of any authorization actually received. Indeed, as we now lmow, there
have been cases, notably in assassination plotting, in which activities have gone far
beyond any known authorization. I believe that these such inexcusable and unauth-
orized actions will not be repeated soon, andI think it is important to recognize
that internal corrective action was taken well before recent revelations. But the
general disposition toward activism in the operational offices of the CIA is another
matter, and it is this general disposition that I think could be significantly con-
strained by a recognized and general presumption that covert operations are
entirely out of order except when they have explicit and exceptional authorization,

Nor do I think it necessarily true that an explicit recognition of the :

exceptional character of such operations would reduce their value and quality in



See @. SIGE |
cases in which they oe in fact authorized. On the contrary, I think a CIA with a
much smaller and leaner covert intelligence capability could easily have greater
specific effectiveness in its exceptional operations than the very large and over-
staffed enterprise developed in the last generation.

The kinds of exceptions which might justify occasional covert operations
are not numerous, and can be grouped under a few major headings.

(1) In time of open warfare, the case for covert activities is
significantly strengthened. There is still good reason to be wary
in authorizing such activities, but the fact remains, when there
is open conflict, that the balance of the argument over special
secret operations shifts, In an unpopular and divisive war like
Vietnam, it will be dangerous to exaggerate the meaning of this
sbit, but the historical and logical case for this exception is
strong. : ‘ : :

(2) A critically important need for intelligence collection can
justify special operations that would otherwise be undesirable.
The early missions of the U-2 over the Soviet Union and the
special missions authorized over Cuba just before the Cuban
missile crisis are excellent examples. The messy handling of
the U-2 shoot-down of 1960 is a separate matter with its own
lessons, but the strategic arms race of the 1950s and the Cuban
missile crisis of 1962 would have been enormously more
dangerous without covert intelligence overflights.

Intelligence collection is often separated from covert operations
in the thinking of intelligence administrators and other concerned
officials. I think this distinction, like the parallel distinction in
the field of counterintelligence, deserves re-examination, Both
intelligence collection and counterintelligence have involved covert
activity which goes well beyond conventional espionage and counter-
espionage, and such enlargements of activity often present many
of the same dangers as covert actions of other sorts. The mas-
sive mail intercepts conducted in the name of counterintelligence
are an excellent example of an abuse which would have been much
less likely to occur if it had been adequately constrained by a
plain requirement of approval from "higher authority."

(3) It is at least worth consideration whether there may not be
need for some highly secret activity in emerging fields like those
of international terrorism and nuclear danger, I do not know
enough about these subjects to imow svhat could or should be done,
but I do not believe we can assert with complacency that there is
no need for such work here that might go beyond intelligence col-
lection. I find it hard to exclude the possibility that in these
fields situatious could arise in which covert action of some sort
would be the least evil. choice available.

(4) It is not always wrong to give covert financial support to
beleaguered democrats in countries where the continuing right
of political choice is directly threatened by extremists of either
the right or left. This is a sensitive and difficult area, and it
is understandable that when excessive and heavy-handed inter-

4 vention seems to be conducted in ways which assist only right-

\ wing authoritarians, covert political action should get a bad
name. But that is not the whole of our historical record, and I
believe that heavy external support given by. others for anti-
constitutional totalitarians can legitimate support for genuinely
democratic and constitutional forces.

The hardest cases in this category are those of appeals for help
from political groups which are out of power and fear that con-
stitutional and democratic process may be extinguished by the
existing regime. Our experience in such anguishing cases sug~
gests that it is not easy to make a genuinely constructive response
in such situations. I conclude that there is a heavy burden of
proof on those that would support the opposition in such situa-
tions, but I do not find this a happy conclusion.

le concluding let me suggest briefly certain general standards which
ought to be met under all of the four kinds of eeeepuions Thave suggested.

First, no operation should ever be covert if in fact it can be as effec-
tively conducted in the open. _Moreover, the justification for covertness must always’

be sought in the international situation and not in any hesitations about public or

Congressional opinion in the United States. An overflight should be kept private

primarily because its public announcement is so painfully embarrassing to the

68262 Dacld:32989696 Page 55


i @ -— j
country which is overflown, A political subsidy, if and when justified on other

grounds, can merit covertness only if that is important to its effectiveness on the

scene ~~ never because disclosure would be troubling at home,
The second general standard is the converse -- that a covert operation

should never be authorized unless in fact it can be persuasively defended to the °

American public and to the Congress if itis exposed. I should note that this
proposition is almost the opposite of the traditional doctrine of "plausible denial."
Here the mistakes over the U-2 shoot-down are instructive, If ‘from the first day
of that affair the administration had explained what had happened and why the flights |
were authorized in the first place, it would have had much less trouble both here

| and abroad. The case of the U-2 flights over Cuba is still more striking, for here

| __ the evidence obtained from the flights was published to the world within weeks, and

that evidence in itself provided complete and persuasive justification for the over-

flights. We will have fewer but better covert operations if-all those who authorize

them ask themselves severely how they will defend them to the American public and.
to the world in event of exposure.

Finally, it is my belief that the initiative in considering covert opera~
tions should be held firmly in the hands of political leaders and not operational
activists. The government should not be in a position in which there is constant
pressure from large and zealous operational bureaus to make use of any and all

of their alleged capabilities, Nor should there be indulgence in the pretense that

covert operations can readily substitute for more visible forms of action, They |
are limited instruments, and the attempt to stretch them beyond their limited useful- |

ness is usually both ineffective and costly,

STATEMENT OF
NICHOLAS deB. KATZENBACH
BEFORE

THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

December 10, 1975

ENCLOSURE:
| NW 68262 Docld:32989696 Page 57 NCLOSURG G2-116 46S - 2435



Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee:

The fundamental problem with covert activities in support of foreign
policy objectives is, of course, the fact that they are covert. Their success

depends upon their secrecy.

And that simple proposition raises the central question for this Committee:
in a society which depends on a high degree of freedom of information to
contro! the activities of government, is it possible to exercise political control
over covert activities abroad? Is it possible to hold an agency charged with

such responsibilities accountable in our political system?

As obvious as that point is, it is easy to lose sight of in the spate of
revelations about covert activities of the past conducted by the Central
. Intelligence Agency. Public debate sometimes seems to focus on the merits
_or demerits of a particular CIA action; on the judgments exercised by those
conducting such activities, and on the morality of eae techniques, or even
on the question of whether or not we should covertly interfere in foreign

political processes at all.

a I start from the premise that some of our covert activities abroad have

- been successful, valuable in support of a foreign policy which was under-

stood and approved by the electorate and Congress, and that situations may

WV,68262, Dgcld:32989696 Page 58



well arise in the future--and may even exist today--where our capacity to

conduct appropriate covert activities could be an important adjunct to our
foreign policy and to stability in the world. I also start from the premise
that some of our covert activities abroad have not been successful, and
have been wrong and \wrongheaded. In some cases we have grossly over-
estimated our capacity to bring about a desirable result and have created
situations unintended and undesirable. And, from recent revelations, I
would conclude that at least sone of the ideas seriously considered were

. plainly wild and irresponsible.

Secondly, I would like to make it clear that I believe that covert means
for collecting intelligence abroad are indispensable. When, in my 1973 -
article in Foreign Affairs, I.said I would be prepared to give up. all covert
activities, I excepted from that statement covert. activities designed to gain
intelligence. There is a clear conceptual distinction between activities

designed to gain intelligence, and activities designed to influence political

acts directly. - But I do not think that line is easy to draw in factual circum
stances,. and I think my article was somewhat glib in giving the impression | ‘

that it could be.

At any’ given time the extent of covert activity designed to influence

political conditions in. fauctaaa country is very much a function of ual one

views the world and the role of the United States in it. Thus for a quarter

NW 68262 Docld:32989696 Page 59



Iyw 68262 Docld:32989696 Page 60 :

3

century after World Sr I the conmnonly-held Americatperception of a
competitive struggle with the Saal Union everywhere dominated our foreign
policy. Both the United States and the Soviet Union were anxious to extend
their influence as far as possible. Both countries employed overt and covert»
means todo so, Hach country had the aim of installing Ae preserving in
power governments favorably oriented to themselves; and the United States
was extremely active in preventing Communist governments from taking over
Third World countries. Because we are an open society we made far more
use of open techniques, such as economic and military aid, than we did of -
covert activities. Nonetheless itis my strong impression that since 1960 we
have been making a major effort to wind down many of our covert activities,

despite the recent revelations concerning Cuba, the Dominican Republic,

and, of course,”Chile.

Phasing down both our overt and our covert activities is a direct
reflection of our changing world and a changing foreign policy. The countries
of Europe and Japan have regained economic strenglh, and the potential of.
world Communism for Soviet domination has been fractionated by the growth
of ScurEATESS and the reemergence of China. I do not pee to sound sanguine
in this respect. Nobody can look, at Portugal today, the potential in Spain,
the growth of the Comaunise Party in Italy, and the general decline of
Christian Democrats throughout Europe without feeling some measure of
concern. We will be faced for sonie time with the problems caused by the
radical elements in the Arab world, and there is much turmoil in S. BE. Asia

as a result of the collapse of Vietnam.

I wrote in 1973 that I thought the time had come to abandon all covert

activities (other than intelligence) designed to influence political results in
foreign countries. That is still my position today. But I arrive at it reluctantly
and with the belief that there are covert activities which are proper, useful, |
and moral. Ido not think itis an easy conclusion to arrive at. Perhaps it is

not even a wise one.

I arrive at this conclusion for a number of reasons, all involving

‘
judgments which the Committee may not share with me.

First, I believe the revelations of Watergate and of the recent investigations
into the intelligence activities of the CIA and the FBI have created a great mis-

trust by the people of the United States in their government. Unless one feels +

4
]

that the loss is greater than I would estimate it to be, I think abandoning secret
activities abroad would help to restore public confidence in government in this

country.

Second, I think the public revelation of past CIA activities, while essential
to restoring confidence in government in this country, has done much to destroy
the CIA's capacity successfully to-conduct covert activities abroad. Further,

unless we formally abandon them, I suspect we will get blamed for even more

things which we have not done in the future than has been the case in the past.

Given that situation, the game may not be worth the candle :

NW 68262 Docld:32989696 Page 61



a a

Third, I think we need to put our energies into formulating and

articulating a foreign policy for the next several years which can command
public consensus and public support. We simply do not have that today

and [ think itis important that we should. Not only do I believe covert activities.

are particularly dangerous when therc is not broad support for the foreign
policy which they serve, but I fear that the emotional issues involved in Oven
activities will tend to detract from and confuse proper public debate as to what
our foreign policy should be. If we can achieve that consensus, and itis a
clear one, then perhaps at some future date we could consider the possibility -

| of covert activities in its support with such controls as we can devise. But in
the interval I think they should be suspended...

Fourth, I have the feeling from recent revelations that secrecy becomes
a source of power and a factor in misjudgment. Control over relatively large

resources, unconstrained by the knowledge and views of many of one's peers

is itself a dangerous situation in a political democracy.

i do not wish to be understood as saying that I do not believe that there

are not some steps the Congress could take which would alleviate some of the
problems which have occurred in the past. It could, for camel. forbid

any U.S. involvement in the assassination of foreign political leaders; forbid
any U. S. involvement in directly providing weapons to any Hone ore
mental group abroad -- though it cannot probably effectively assure that

money provided may not in fact be spent for those purposes. It could

IW 68262 Docld:32989696 Page 62


_ insist on far tighter control in the Executive Branch of SoeeE activities
aimed at influencing political decisions abroad, and insist upon review,
with written record, of all such activities at a very high level of poy
ment, together with an appraisal of their success or failure. And it could
‘provide for review at specified periods -- perhaps paves four or five years --

by an appropriate Congressional committee.

I believe procedures of this kind would be helpful in bringing
_ matters under control. I believe they would have the desirable effect of
reducing clandestine activities, and chanelling these into what I would
regard as the more desirable and legitimate areas; for example, helping
- to fund activities on the part of local groups designed to express diversity

of,opinion within a relatively closed society.

What I do not know -~ and the Committee must judge -- is whether or
not steps of this kind are adequate to deal with the problems of secrecy in

the circumstances of today.

On 12/4/75, Richard Vermeire, Btaff Member of the

House Select Committee, requested that the Bureau determine

whether it would be possible for the House Select Committee

to review the records of the U.S. Recording Company unexcised

in the office of the U.S. Recording Company. Vermeire stated

it was not possible because of the excisions made on those

records by the Bureau for. the House Select Committee to make

a thorough review of same. Vermeire interposed no objection

to a Bureau representative being present during that review

and, in fact, thought it would be useful.

On the instructions of Assistant Director John A.
Mintz, SA Paul V. Daly of this Division contacted Attorney” 44,
Brian Gettings who is representing Mr. Joseph Tait to detérmifie
whether he interposed any objection to the Bureau makingéat ail-
able the U.S. Recording Company records for review in Baéreau

Reference »/ memorandum of 11-10-75 from Mr. Branigan

to Mp ‘annall concerning inquiry from Congressman Otis G. Pike, Chairman
ct ttee_on Intelligence, requesting information
ing "alleged and confirmed" incidents of Soviet-bloc penetrations off
congressional staffs.
bh? ~(hg,2 4 :

Per instructions by Mr. Adams, Inspector Bowers met with
Senator James O. Eastland on 11-18-75 and advised him of this inquiry from
Congressman Pike since a former employee of the Senator's, one Kenneth Bae
Tolliver, was involved with the Soviets while working for the Senator. /
Senator Eastland was told that while we had confirmed to Congressman Pike
the existencecof one incident wherein a member of a congressional staff/had
furnished information to hostile intelligence agents obtained through his
congressional employment, we had declined to identify any of the parties
involved since this would infringe the privacy of others. Senator Eastland
expressed appreciation for our having informed him of this matter and asked
that he be kept currently informed of future pertinent developments.

Senator Eastland advised that he had received a letter from
Congressman Pike recently requesting that members of the House Select
Committee on Intelligence staff be allowed access to the files of the Senate
Subcommittee on Internal Security, which Senator Eastland chairs. He said
the letter indicates the staff would be interested in organizations and individ-
uals on lists maintained by the Subcommittee, and also inquired about the
FBI's relations with the Subcommittee. Senator Eastland said that he had
determined the letter was sent without Congressman Pike's knowledge or 09

e

approval; hence, he (Senator Eastland) will ignore it. 75 en . Aw

REPORT
of the

SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ,
CITING HENRY A. KISSINGER,

together with
CONCURRING and DISSENTING VIEWS
INTRODUCTION

On November 6, 1975, the Select Committee on Intelligence of the
House of Representatives, established by House Resolution 591, 94th
Congress, First Session, caused to be issued a subpena to Henry A.
Kissinger, Secretary of State. (See Appendix A.) The subpena de-
manded that the Secretary of State, or any subordinate officer, official
or employee with custody or control deliver to the Select Committee,
of which the Honorable Otis G. Pike is Chairman, on November 11,
1975, at 10:00 a.m. in Room B-816 Rayburn House Office Building,
Washington, D.C., certain materials set forth and described in the
said subpena.? This subpena was duly served on November 7, 1975.

The said subpena was not complied with on the return date thereof
nor any subsequent date thereafter. . .

On November 14, 1978, the Select Committee met in open session at
10:00 a.m. in Room 2118 Rayburn House Office Building for the
purpose of determining what action should be taken in view of the

‘ailure of Secretary of State, Henry A. Kissinger, to comply with said

“All documents relating to State Department recommending covert action made to the
National Security Council and the Forty Committee and its predecessor committees from
January 20, 1961 to the present.”



iw - O+¢ , ey wos

subpena. The Select Committee, a quorum being present, on a record -
vote of 10-2, recommended the adoption of a resolution as follows:

Resolved, That the Speaker of the House of Representatives certify
the report of the Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of
Representatives as to the contumacious conduct of Henry A. Kissinger,
as Beeretary of State, in failing and refusing to produce certain per- .
tinent materials in compliance with a subpena duces tecum of said.
Select Committee served upon Henry A. Kissinger, as Secretary of
State, and as ordered by the Select Committee, together with all the
facts in connection therewith, under the seal of the House of Repre-
sentatives to the United States Attorney for the District of Columbia, .
to the end that Henry A. Kissinger, as Secretary of State, may be pro-
ceeded: against in the manner and form provided by law.

CHRONOLOGY OF EVENTS *

On November 6, 1975, the Select Committee on Intelligence met,
after due notice, to consider the question of the issuance of subpenas
to obtain materials pertinent to the investigative responsibility of the —_

Committee, as well as the Congress as a whole, and necessary to the
discharge of its mandate. Seven subpenas were authorized, each by a
record vote of a majority of the members of the Committee. The sub-
pena which is the subject of this resolution was approved by a vote of
. 8 ayes with five members voting present. The subpena is directed to the
roduction of classified materials as to which there could be no public
isclosure by the Committee without compliance with the release pro-
cedures previously agreed to. _. :

No materials were furnished to the Committee on the return date -
of November 11, 1975, or until the time of the vote on the accompanying
resolution. The materials which were the subject of the subpena are
necessary to the Committee’s ongoing investigation. The failure of the ~
Secretary of State to comply obstructs that investigation, and the
work of this Committee.

On November 18, 1975, at 9:00 a.m., two days after the return date
of the subpena, the Select Committee met in open session in Room
2118 Rayburn House Office Building for the purpose of being advised . .
by staff as to the status of compliance with said subpena. Staff reported
that none of the subpenaed materials had been provided.

AUTHORITY
The Select Committee on Intelligence is a duly established Com- che .
mittee of the House of Representatives, pursuant to House Resolution .
591, 94th Congress, First Session. H. Res, 591 was reported out of the *
Committee on Rules on July 11, 1975, and adopted by the House on ae
a voice vote on July 17, 1975.
Section 2 of IZ. Res, 591 authorizes and directs the Selact Committee ~

to conduct an inquiry, inter alia, into:

(1) the collection, analysis, use, and cost of intelligence in-
formation and allegations of illegal or improper activities of
intelligence agencies in the United States and abroad;

NW 68262 Docld:32989696 Page 83



NW 68262 Docld:32989696 Page 39

%

3-

(2) the procedures and effectiveness of coordination among
and between the various intelligence components of the
United States Government ; :

(3) the nature and extent of executive branch oversight
and control of United States intelligence activities;

(4) the need for improved or reorganized oversight by the
Congress of United States intelligence activities;

(5) the necessity, nature, and extent of overt and covert
intelligence activities by United States intelligence instru-
mentalities in the United States and abroad; ‘

* * ® *

(8) such other related matters as the select committee shall
deem necessary to carry out the purposes of this resolution.”

‘Section 3 of H. Res, 591 authorizes the Select Committee to inquire

into the activities of several enumerated components of the intelligence
community, including the National Security Council and the Central
Intelligence Agency.

Further, Section 4 of H. Res. 591 authorizes the Select Committee to
“require, by subpena or otherwise, * * * the production of such books,
records, correspondence, memorandums, papers, and documents as it
deems necessary.”

Pursuant, therefore, to its responsibilities and authority as man-
dated by the House of Representatives, the Select Committee has issued
subpenas for documents and information which, by the vote of the
Committee, were deemed essential to its inquiry. The subpena which
forms the basis of the recommended resolution was issued in full con-
formance with this authority.

As indicated above, Secretary of State, Henry A. Kissinger, was
summoned to furnish materials in his custody and control pursuant to
a valid, duly executed subpena of the Select Committee, but he delib-
erately failed to comply with the terms of said subpena.

CONCLUSION: i

All substantive and procedural legal prerequisities have been com-
plied with and the House of Representatives should adopt the accom-
panying resolution to refer the matter to the Untied States Attorney
tor the District of Columbia. Title 2, United States Code, Sections 192
and 194 states the necessary procedures for taking this action. (Seo
Appendix B.)

It is the position of the Select Committee that the proceedings to
date are in compliance with its mandate, its rules and the Rules of the
House of Representatives and we recommend that the House adopt the
resolution to report the fact of the refusal of Henry A. Kissinger,
Seeretary of State, to produce pertinent materials pursuant to a sub-
pena duces tecum of the Select Committee together with all the facts
in connection therewith to the end that he may be proceeded against
as provided by law.

a
th

fore us is hardly debatable. The claim of executive privilege is based on
the assertion, set forth in the communcation to the Select Committee,
that the documents subpoenaed “in addition to disclosing highly sensi-
tive military and foreign affairs assessments and evaluations, disclose
the consultation process involving advice and recommendations of
advisers to former Presidents, made to them directly or to Committees
composed of their closest aides and counselors.”

The argument is made that executive privilege may not be asserted

. by President Ford for communications directed to former Presidents

or to advisory committees of former Presidents. On this point, as far
as I know, there are no specific legal precedents, However, if the ra-
tionale of United States v. Nixon is applied it becomes apparent that
the doctrine must extend to communications involving former
Presidents,

The doctrine of executive privilege is bottomed not on some legal
technicality but on plain and simple logic: the need for confidentiality.
This need can be served only if those who make recommendations to
the President know that their expressions will be protected even after
the President to whom those expressions were made has left office. No
Secretary of State, no high government official, no aide to the Presi-
dent has any assurance that the man he speaks to as President today
may not be gone from the scene tomorrow. How can we expect him to
advise the President with that candor of which the Supreme Court
speaks in U.S. v. Wéwon if he knows that the very next day the protec-
tion of executive privilege may be shattered because of a change in the
occupant of the Oval Office?

If the need for a confidential channel of communication exists, isn’t
that need just as great on the day before the Presidency changes hands
in orderly fashion every four or eight years? It is just'as important on
the last day of a President’s term as it is on the first day. But if we
deny the application of executive privilege to conversations with a
former President then we have to conclude that communications which
are fully protected on January 19 have absolutely no protection on
January 20.

Those who do not believe that the doctrine of executive privilege can
be invoked by a current President as to occurrences prior to his admin-
istration contend that such. a proposition would lead to the ridiculous
result that a current President might invoke executive privilege as to
communications to President Washington. The answer to that is quite
simple: the doctrine is applicable as far back as reasonably necessary
to protect the purpose of the privilege. After the passage of time has

eliminated the dangers of exposure the need for confidentiality disap-
pears and exccutive privilege dissolves. ;

In any event, Secretary Kissinger is charged by the Select Commit-
tee with a criminal act—violation of 2 USC 192—for obeying the law-
ful order of his superior, the President. It is unconscionable—and
indeed likely unconstitutional—to prosecute a subordinate official for
obeying the lawful direction of his superior.

T submit. therefore, that the resolution of contempt based on this
‘subpoena should be voted down because there is no. critical need for
the documents sought, and because there is very substantial doubt that
prosecution for contempt in this instance would be successful.

treatment.

Thus, the Supreme Court has given firm foundation to the doctrine
of executive privilege. Its applicability to the circumstances now be-

Congress’ legislative tasks and the responsibility of a grand
jury, or any institution engaged in like functions, While fact- ‘
finding by a legislative committee is undeniably a part of its
task, legislative judgments normally depend more on the pre-
dicted consequences of proposed legislative actions and their
political acceptability, than on precise reconstruction of past
events; Congress frequently legislates on the basis of conflict-

ing information provided in its hearings.

Thus, in order to have any chance of success in judicial proceedings
which, it should be remembered, are criminal in nature, the Committee
must show that the recommendations of the various Secretaries of
State during the 14 years in question are “demonstrably critical to the
responsible fulfillment” of the Committee’s function. There is little
doubt in my mind but that this test cannot be met.

Then there is a second, and perhaps even more formidable, legal
hurdle, It is the hurdle of executive privilege asserted in this instance
by the President of the United States.

It is important to keep in mind that the assertion of executive
privilege was made by the President and not by the Secretary of State.

y letter from the ‘President's counsel to Secretary Kissinger, the
President advised the Secretary that he invoked executive privilege
as to the documents covered by the subpoena. The Secretary then trans-
mitted that decision to the Committee. This procedure followed the
method established several years before by presidential order.

But the important question is whether or not the assertion of execu-
tive privilege is valid in this instance. That such a doctrine exists and
has constitutional validity has been clearly recognized by our courts
including the Supreme Court of the United States. United States. v.
Niwon, £18 U.S. 683. Any Member who is troubled about the limits
and definition of executive or presidential privilege should afford him-
self the opportunity of reading the pertinent portion of that decision
beginning at page 705. .

in United Rices y. Miwon, the Supreme Court was confronted, with
a collision between executive privilege and the constitutionally pro-
tected rights, as set forth in the Sixth Amendment, that every de-
fendant in a criminal trial has: the right “to be confronted with the
witnesses against him” and “to have compulsory process for obtaining
witnesses in his favor.” The Supreme Court held that a generalize
claim of executive privilege could not be invoked to prevent access by
the judicial branch to material necessary in a criminal trial, :

Although the Supreme Court in United States v. Niwon was not
dealing with the issue of congressional access versus executive privi-
lege, nevertheless, the decision stands.as a strong pronouncement as to
the existence and extent of the doctrine. When- the privilege is asserted
on. ‘the basis of national security interests it may even foreclose access
in criminal cases. _

For those who may not have the opportunity to read the decision
of the Supreme Court in United States v. Nion, the following perti-

nent portions thereof will be helpful:

ing inquiry. But what pertinence do recommendations for covert ac-
tions have to the business of the Select Committee? an
H. Res. 591 established the Select Committee “to conduct an inquiry
into the organization, operations and oversight of the intelligence
community of the United States Government.” The recommendations
of the Secretary of State, or the recommendations of anyone else for
that matter, are not relevant to the “organization, operations, and
rsight of the intelligence community.” H. Res. 591 authorizes the
elect Committee to inquire into “the necessity, nature, and extent
of overt and covert intelligence activities by United States intelligence
« ‘instrumentalities * * *.” While the authority of the Committee ex-
8 tends to covert activities actually carried out, that authority does not
give the Committee the power to force anyone to disclose what recom-
: Lmendations he made for covert activities. Perhaps there are some in
& the Congress who would like to know what the Secretaries of State
§ from 1962 to 1972 were recommending. That would make fascinating
reading and undoubtedly would make for some great headlines were
the information divulged, But the mandate of the Select Committee
is not to inquire into the imagination of our Secretaries of State; our
mandate is to determine how our intelligence community operates.
There isn’t any need for our Committee to look into the minds of the
Secretaries of State over the last 14 years in order to determine how
the intelligence community carried out its functions. Our inquiry be-
gins with the process by which a decision is made to carry out a covert
operation, not with a recommendation to the decisionmakers.
Therefore, I submit that there is no real need for the Committee to
have the information sought by the subpoena, Regardless of our legal
right. we should not pursue the criminal prosecution of the Secretary
of State for something that we have no real need for in carrying out.
our legislative function. .
But, there are also at least two serious legal impediments to the
Committee’s right to obtain the information.
First, there is the legal question as to whether or not the subpoenaed.
materials seek information which is beyond the scope of our inquiry.
In making this determination the courts will look to the scope of our
authority as defined by H. Res. 591, and will also look to the facts
of the particular case to determine if the subpoenaed materials are
critical to the performance of the Committee’s function. The United
States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia (to which court
‘such an issue as we have before us would travel) spoke to this issue
in Senate Select Committee v. Niaon, 498 I. 24 725 (1974). The court
said:

Subpoena served: Friday, November 7, 1975.

Return date: Tuesday, November 11, 1975.

Directed to: Henry A. Kissinger, Secretary of State, or any sub-
ordinate officer, official or employee with custody or control of items

-described in the subpoena.

For the following: All documents relating to State Department
recommending covert action made to the National Security Council
and the Forty Committee aid its predecessor committees from Janu-
ary 20, 1961 to the present.

On November 11, the return date of the subpoena, William G. Hy-
land, Director of the Bureau of Intelligence and Research, Depart-
ment of State, notified the Committee staff director in writing that
documents relating to recommendations by the State Department were-
at the White House for decision on the question of executive privilege.

On November 14, the Committee voted, 10-2, to bring contempt
action against Secretary Kissinger for non-compliance with the sub-
poena. On the same day a letter on behalf of the Secretary of State was
delivered to the Chairman of the Select Committee respectfully de~
clining compliance. The letter reads, in part, as follows:

The subpoena sought “all documents relating to State
Department recommending covert action made to the Na-
tional Security Council and the Forty Committee and its pre-
decessor Committees from January 20, 1961, to present.” The
Committee staff has made clear that this is intended to cover
recommendations originating with the State Department. An.
examination of our records has disclosed ten such documents,
dating from the period 1962 through 1972. These consist of
recommendations from officials in the State Department,
sometimes the Secretary of State, to the Forty Committee or
its predecessor, 303 Committee, or to the President himself
ih connection with consideration by one of those Committees.

The documents in question, in addition to disclosing highly
sensitive military and foreign affairs assessments and evalua-
tions, disclose the consultation process involving advice and.
recommendations of advisers to former Presidents, made to
them directly or to Committees composed of their closest aides
and counselors,

‘A very extensive effort was required to identify documents meet-
ing the description in the subpoena. This was no small undertaking
considering that a period of more than i4 :years was involved. As
of November 14, the date of the letter referred to above, the staff of
the Secretary of State had discovered ten documents, dating from
the period 1962 thtough 1972. It is my understanding that none of the
ten documents, or any similar documents subsequently located, involve
the adininistration of President Ford, or the period of time in which
Henry Kissinger has been Secretary of State, and that nine of the
ten documents originated during the administrations of Presidents
Kennedy and Johnson. Thus, any notion that the documents are being
withheld to avoid embarrasment to the present administration should
be discarded.

TI question the need of the Committee to have recommendations by
the State Department of covert actions. I admit that this is an interest-



24.

All factors, legal and otherwise, should be weighed by us in making
this decision : is it wise for the House of Representatives to vote favor-
ably on the resolutions? Our decision could have far-reaching
consequences.

I would now like to give my own views on this question. I offer them
without pretense of sagacity, but with assurances to my colleagues in
the House that they have been reached sincerely, honestly, and with
much reflection.

It is my opinion that it was not wise of the Select Committee to
vote the resolutions of criminal contempt against the Secretary of
State. Thus, I believe it to be the better part of wisdom for the House
to disapprove the resolutions. I say this for three principle reasons:

(a) To lay down the legal gauntlet now runs the risk of increasin,
hostility on both sides. This will lead to a freezing of positions.
conciliatory approach will probably result in the Committee getting
more information. H.Res. 591, which established the Select Com-
mittee, directs the Committee to report to the House no later than
January 81, 1976, If we send this matter to the courts there is no way
that the issue can be resolved prior to that date nor prior to any reason-
able extension of the life of the Committee.

(b) It is questionable that we need all of the information called
for by the subpoenas. I am convinced that we can obtain, on a nego-
tiated basis, sufficient information to carry out our legislative man-
date. We should insist on our “legal rights” only when the informa-
tion sought to be withheld from Congress is absolutely necessary
to its legislative function. Especially is this true when the insistence
of asserted legal rights involves the dissembling and enormously dis-
ruptive contempt proceedings against an executive official with heavy
responsibilities. Whatever our views may be of the policies pursued
by Secretary Kissinger and/or the President, we should have a decent
regard for the effects of a judicial confrontation on the ability of

. the Secretary of State to carry out his duties. To require him to direct
his time and energy to a judicial battle would cause a corresponding
diminution of the time that he can devote to his responsibilities. This
is an important element to be placed on the scales in resolving the
equation of wisdom.

(c) Thirdly, I believe it unwise to pursue contempt because there
are serious legal questions as to whether the action proposed by the
Committee will be successful. The Committee has chosen a course of
action which will place the judicial branch in the position of bein;
the arbiter. If the judicial proceedings are destined to be unsuccessful,
because of weaknesses in the committee’s case, it behooves the House
not to proceed for at least two reasons. First, we should seek to avoid
the substantial expenditures of money and human effort which will
have to be expended by both sides. Second, we should seek to avoid
the possible establishment of an adverse precedent because of a weak
case.

IL. SPECIFIC VIEWS ON THE RESOLUTION COVERED BY THIS REPORT

the subpoena on which it is based. It may be useful to the Members

CONCURRING VIEWS OF OTIS G. PIKE

This Committee, since its inception, has had some difficulty pene-
trating veil after veil of secrecy thrown by the various intelligence
agencies over the various intelligence activities of the United States

overnment. One of the mandates of the Committee, as set forth in
the resolution which created it, was to look at:

the nature and extent of executive branch oversight and
control of United States intelligence activities

This we have attempted to do and the results have been. disturbing.
In general, rather than being circumscribed by oversight and control,
the CIA was acting in every activity of questionable legality and/
‘or morality, on orders from “higher authority”—either the President
himself or the National Security Council or its “40 Committee.”

Those covert actions generated by the Central Intelligence Agency’s
professionals have tended to be that—professional. Those generated
by the White House or the State Department have tended to be more
questionable, yet apparently they were rarely questioned. In further-
ance of our mandate, the Committee, on the motion of Mr. McClory,
and by a vote of 8 ayes, 5 present, issued a subpoena asking for the pro-
duction of all recommendations made by the State Department to the
National Security Council for covert actions by the CIA. The Na-
tional Security Council is a statutory body, created by Congress in
the National Security Act of 1947. It is not simply an extension of
the Presidency. If there is any legal authority for covert actions by
the CIA (other than the alleged Constitutional power of the President
to use covert actions by the CLA in the “conduct of foreign affairs”),
it lies in the National Security Act of 1947. It lies in that clause which
authorizes “such other functions and duties related to intelligence af-
fecting the national security as the National Security Council may
from time to time direct.” This is the language on which the CLA has
traditionally relied for its legal justification in conducting covert
activities. It has habitually referred to its covert actions as “intelli-
gente activities” as did the President himself in alleging that execu-
tive privilege prohibited the State Department from providing the
‘Committee with its recommendations to the National Security Coun-
cil for covert actions.

The State Department, for reasons unclear to this member, has held
itself to be in a wholly different position from every other Department
with which the Committee has dealt. At an earlier time, this Commit-
tee was investigating the performance of the intelligence community
‘and the role of the CIA, if any, in the 1974 coup on Cyprus and the
subsequent Turkish invasion of Cyprus. We learned that the man in.
charge of the Cyprus desk in the State Department had objected
strongly to our actions during that period, had believed that both the
coup and invasion could have been prevented, and had expressed his

(9)

10°

views in writing. The Committee sought, by subpoena, to obtain that
document, and the State Department refused to provide it, rasing the
awful spectre of McCarthyism if Congress were able to get the recom-
mendations of middle-level officers. In refusing to provide the recom-
mendations of the man in charge of the Cyprus desk as to what we
should have done in Cyprus, the Secretary of State, on October 14,
1975, wrote the Committee as follows:

It is my strong belief that the Committee should look to
the policy levels of the Department, and not to junior and
middle-level officers, for the policy information they seek. It
is my principal advisers and I who are responsible for policy,
and it is we who should be held accountable before the Con-
gress and the American people for the manner in which we
exercise the authority and responsibility vested in us by the
President and Congress of the United States.

In keeping with this principle I am prepared now, as I
have been from the begining, to do the following:

* * * % *

Authorize any policy level officer of the Department or
the Foreign Service to testify before the Select Committee
on recommendations received by him from his subordinates,
but without identification of authorship, and any recommen-
dations he forwarded to his supervisors.

Just stay away from the poor middle-level officers and we policy
makers will be happy to tell you about our recommendations!

All that is at issue in this subpoena is precisely what the Secretary
of State assured Congress it would get. We want the recommenda-
tions of the State Department’s policy makers for covert actions.

If the recommendations of lower level officers in the State Depart-
ment are to be denied to Congress on the grounds of “McCarthyism”
and those of top level officers in the State Bepartment on the grounds
of “executive privilege” then the State Department has arrogated
unto itself total non-accountability for its recommendations as to

. operations by the CIA or the NSA or any other intelligence agency.

Oversight by Congress demands, first of all, the will and the stamina
to exercise oversight. Secondly, it requires knowledge as to what ac-
tions are being undertaken. The Congress simply cannot exercise
oversight if the Executive branch or any Department thereof uni-
laterally determines what facts Congress may have. There cannot be
comity between the branches if the solemn commitments of October
are broken by November.

The Secretary of State is in contempt of Congress and if Congress
fails to meet its own responsibilities it will well merit that contempt.

DISSENTING VIEWS OF HON. DAVID C. TREEN

The majority of the Select Committee has voted three resolutions of
contempt against Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. In each in-
stance the resolution recommends criminal prosecution of Secretary
Kissinger under sections 192 and 194 of Title 2 of the United States
Code.

First, I want to make some general comments applicable to the
three resolutions taken together. Following will be my observations
on the specific resolution covered by this report.

I. GBNERAL VIEWS ON THE THREE CONTEMPT RESOLUTIONS

Like every member of this Committee I am interested in the Select
Committee receiving whatever information is necessary and appro-
priate to our function. It is of vital importance that our intelligence’
community operate efficiently, economically, prudently, and with
proper regard for the rights of individuals. .

I differ with the majority on the question of what is “necessary and
appropriate” to our function. I also differ with the majority as to the
wisdom and appropriateness in these circumstances, of our attempts
to hold the Secretary of State in contempt.

The issue of a congressional committee’s authority to obtain testi-
mony and materials from the executive branch of the government is a
most important and, indeed, a most interesting issue. This is a legal
issue, a constitutional issue. It is the view of some, if not all, of the
Committee majority that this fundamental issue must be thrashed out
here and now. .

In my opinion, neither this Committee nor any other congressional
committee should feel compelled to assert its legal rights just for the
sake of flexing its muscles or to prove a point. The assertion and
prosecution to an ultimate disposition by the Supreme Court of a
congressional committee’s “rights” should only occur when it is vitally
necessary to the legislative function to obtain the testimony or mate-
vials and when there is no other way to meet that legislative need.

Thus, it is my hope that the distinction between. what the Select
Committee, or the Congress, may be entitled to legally, on the one
hand, and the appropriateness and necessity of asserting and prosecut-
ing those rights, on the other hand, will be kept clearly in mind in the
debate on the issues raised by the resolutions of contempt.

I am not saying that the legal and constitutional questions should
not be considered and debated. Indeed they should, because the legal
and constitutional questions bear on the question of the appropriate-
ness and wisdom o: Pursuing the contempt process. What I am say-
ing is that one should not vote in favor of the resolutions of contempt
just because that Member concludes that the Committee has the better
side of the legal argument.

CONCURRING VIEWS OF RONALD V. DELLUMS

Throughout our investigations the Select Committee on Intelligence
has encountered a pattern of non-cooperation from the executive
branch agencies. The refusal to provide this information is yet another
critical example of their unwillingness to cooperate. There is no doubt
that the documents sought are essential to the Committee’s inquiry.

The material requested is all of the documents relating to State
Department’s recommendations for covert actions to the National
Security Council and the Forty Committee and the predecessor
committees.

There is evidence that some covert actions were authorized and
directed without 40 Committee and NSC approval, contrary to law.
This specific information would be invaluable in establishing those
actions forwarded for approval by the Forty Committee and in estab-
lishing ways and means of approval.

The subpoena was voted subsequent to unsuccessful staff attempts
to secure the specified information.

After the subpoena was issued, no effort was made to comply with
the request of the Committee. To preclude the Commitiee’s review of
this information would be contributing to a cover-up of possible wrong

loing.

Ths committee has a finite life; its end is rapidly approaching. If
we are to carry out as full an investigation as possible and still report
on the date required, further negotiation and other interim steps will
not be possible.

Within the framework of this investigation and as a precedent for
the continuing oversight that must follow, the right of Congress and
its duly appointed committees to obtain this information must be
assured.

- It is for these reasons and because of the unwillingness to cooperate
shown by the Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger, that I urge the
House to cite Mr. Kissinger for contempt of Congress.

still very much alive—and to set a precedent in this case in which
Presidents and their closest aides could fear revelation of their internal
deliberations after they left the government would certainly have a
chilling effect on the frank, forthright, and sometimes publicly un-
popular advice which the Chief Executive has a right to expect from
his advisors.

Finally, to help the members determine the vaiidity of the assertion
of executive privilege in their own minds, it may be useful to expand
upon the sketchy description of the documents which is contained in
the majority report. The Committee subpoenaed and the Executive has
compiled a total of 25 documents prepared by the Department of State
which were sent to the National Security Council and the Forty Com-
mittee in which the Department initiated 18 proposals for covert action
projects. These documents cannot be described as a normal part of the
tremendous paper flow between an Executive department and the
White House. Rather, these documents contained highly sensitive in-
formation and went directly to the National Security Council, which
is chaired directly by the President, or to the Forty Committee, which
is chaired by the Assistant to the President for National Security Af-
fairs—one of the President’s two closest advisors in matters of foreign
affairs and national security. Furthermore, the Select Committee has
received testimony from the Secretary of State that, in no instance of
which he is aware, did any covert operation receive approval without
the direct personal attention of the President. Clearly, these docu-
ments either went divectly to the President or weve the basis for a
Prsidential briefing by one of his closest advisors. They are at the
heart of the consultation process—and as such, deserve protection
under the doctrine of executive privilege, if the doctrine is to have any
vitality at all.

For the foregoing reasons it is the position of the undersigned that
the resolution seeking to hold Dr. Kissinger in contempt for failure to
produce materials under the State Department subpoena be rejected
overwhelmingly by the Members of the House of Representatives.

in writing the President’s instruction to the Secretary of State to re-
spectfully decline compliance with the subpoena on the grounds of the
‘resicent’s personal assertion of executive privilege. The Majority Re-
port fails to mention the fact of this assertion of executive privilege;
neither does it, in any way, challenge the validity of the assertion.
In the above-mentioned letter from the President to the Committee,
the Committee received the President’s personal word that

the documents revealed to an unacceptable degree that con-
sultation process involving advice and recommendations to
Presidents Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon, made to them di-
rectly or to committees composed of their closest aides and
counselors.

The Committee has no evidence, and has, in fact, made no claim
that this is not the case. In the absence of any such claim, it seems to-
ane that the President’s claim in this respect ought to be honored and
respected.

The Committee’s action in pressing the contempt resolution in the
face of the President’s assertion of executive privilege in this case
ereates a conflict between the House of Representatives and the Presi-
dent which cannot be resolved by following any definitive precedent.
However, there is a clearly established manner for the House to meet
a challenge which it regards as contumacious. There is no need to refer
this matter to the courts. If this House had the gumption, it could
utilize its own authority to order the Sergeant-at-Arms to seize the
Secretary and confine him to a common jail in the District of Colum-
bia or the Guard Room of the Capitol Police. Of course there is no:
apparent intention on the part of any members of this Committee to.
fellow this course of action. Indeed, no Congress has even undertaken:
to exercise its contempt authority in this manner against a sitting
member of the President’s cabinet—but the members ought to be
aware that if the full House approves this resolution, it will set in
motion a course of events which can result in an equally disastrous
spectacle.

My point is that there may never be a “good” time in the course of
Congressional-Executive Department relations for seeking a definitive
ruling on the question of the power of a House Committee to secure
documents or information where a defense of “executive privilege” is
raised. While, indeed, there may never be a “good” time for pursuing
such a procedure, now would seem to be the “worst” time considering
the turbulent situation in world affairs.

Several members of the Committee have questioned the President’s
authority to assert executive privilege on behalf of his predecessors in
office. Bearing in mind that the raison d’etre of the privilege is the pro-
tection of the integrity of the consultation process between the Chief
Executive and his closest advisors, it would seem obvious that the priv-
ilege runs to the Office of the Presidency rather than to the individual
President himself—and numerous precedents can be cited in support
of this particular assertion. The President has not claimed a privilege
which covers a period going back to the founding of the Republic—
rather he has sought to protect the consultation process in the im-
mediate past three Administrations as it occurred over the past 15
years. Many people who served in the past three Administrations are

CONCURRING VIEWS OF JAMES P. JOHNSON

The response to the subpoena issued to Henry A. Kissinger as Sec-
retary of State raised a fundamental issue and deserves The ‘ioseat
attention and scrutiny. The subpoena requested “all documents relat-
ing to State Department recommending covert action made to the
National Security Council and the Forty Committee and its prede-
cessor ‘Rommittees from J anuay 20, 1961 to present.”

mn. November 14, 1975, the Chairman received a letter read i .
record by Mr. McClory as follows: ead into the

Duar Mr. Cuarraan: The Secretary of State has been in-
structed by the President respectfully to decline compliance
with your subpoena to the Seeretary of November 6, 1975,
for the reason that it would be contrary to the public interest
and incompatible with the sound functioning of the Executive
Branch to produce the documents requested.

The subpoena sought “all documents relating to State De-
partment recommending covert action made to the National
Security Council and the Forty Committee and its prede-
cessor committees from January 20, 1961, to present.” The
committee staff has made clear that this is intended to cover
recommendations originating with the State Department. An
examination of our records has disclosed ten such documents,
dating from the period 1962 through 1972. These consist of
recommendations from officials in the State Department,
sometimes the Secretary of State, to the Forty Committee or
its predecessor, 303 Committee, or to the President himself
in connection with consideration by one of those committees.

The documents in question, in addition to disclosing highly
sensitive military and foreign affairs assessments and eval-
uations, disclose the consultation process involving advice
and recommendations of advisers to former Presidents, made
to them directly or to committees composed of their closest
aides and counselors.

- Therefore, I advise you that the Secretary of State is de-
clining to comply with such subpoena on the basis of the
President’s assertion of Executive privilege. Sincerely,
George H. Aldrich, Acting Legal Advisor to the Depart-
ment of State.

The key paragraph says, “The documents in question, in addition
to disclosing highly sensitive military and foreign affairs assessments
and evaluations, disclose the consultation process involving advice and
recommendations of advisers to former Presidents, made to them di-
rectly or to committees composed of their closest aides and counselors.”
This language was nearly identically repeated in a Presidential letter
to the Chairman dated November 19, 1975..

‘The secrecy raised peripherally by the letter must not be allowed to
deflect attention away from the real issue. The President and the
Chairman and Ranking Member previously worked out an agreement
under which the committee would receive classified information. Pur-
suant to this agreement, no classified information received by the com-
mittee can be released without the President’s prior approval. Since
reaching this agreement, no information requested has been denied the
committee on the grounds of its classification, and the President has
not said here that the documents are denied because they are highly
classified. Rather, the assertion is made that they “disclose the con-
sultation process involving advice and recommendations of advisers
to former Presidents, made to them directly or to committees composed.
of their closest aides and counselors.”

But, the subpoena was for documents from the State Department to
the National Security Council and Forty Committee and its prede-
cessor. To allow the doctrine of Executive privilege to extend to gov-
ernment documents of prior Administrations where publication and
classification is not an issue, is to my mind a dereliction of my duty asa
Member of Congress. The claim was not made by the Presidents in-
volved. The documents were not removed at the expiration of the
terms as being private. They are not being held in private, Presiden-
tial files. They were left as government documents in the State Depart-
ment files. They are classified, but their classification is not asserted as
a reason for withholding them from the committee which has access
to secret documents ranging from assassination attempts to SALT
compliance. They are withheld because they are allegedly “recommen-
dations of advisers to former Presidents, made to them directly or to
the committees composed of their closest aides and counselors.” Thus,
the claim is made, public documents become private communications
which qualify for the doctrine of Executive privilege. .

If the State Department documents recommending covert action,
made to the National Security Council or the Forty Committee or its
predecessor constitute recommendations of advisers to Presidents, then
what government document doesn’t become subject to similar claims of
Executive privilege? The State Department is not a department of
the United States Government under this assertion; rather, its em-
ployees are advisers to Presidents. State Department documents di-
rected to another agency of government have become recommendations
of advisers to Presidents, made to committees composed of their closest
aides and counselors. Thus, the National Security Council, created by
Congress through the Act of 1947 to be the chief advisory body'to the
President with respect to National Security affairs is reduced to a
group of the “closest aides and counselors.” . .

The doctrine of Executive privilege to protect the privacy of Presi-

~ dential policy making procedures is surely a sound one. But, to extend
it to a prior President who did not assert it, to apply it to government
documents between governmental agencies, amounts to a claim of the
power of censorship that cannot be accepted, in my view.
“ T asked the representative of the Executive Branch who appeared
before our committee, Mr. Scalia, if there was another way to get a
court determination of the issue besides a contempt citation of the
Secretary of State. He replied that this was not an issue for the courts,

DISSENTING VIEWS OF REP. ROBERT McCLORY

In the final sentence of his letter to the Select Committee dated No-
vember 19, 1975, the President of the United States voiced a sentiment
with which I wholeheartedly concur. The President wrote, “I believe
that the national interest is best served through our cooperation and
adoption of a spirit of mutual trust and respect.” It is my earnest con-
tention that in this area of complex national security issues and in an
atmosphere of ongoing serious negotiations with the Executive Branch,
the Committee ought to have continued to work together with the
President to resolve remaining differences rather than follow the pre-
cipitate route of voting a contempt citation against the chief foreign
affairs officer in this Administration at such a crucial time in world
events, As the President stated, there'is a legitimate national interest
at stake here that ought to transcend all the recriminations, misunder-
standings, and personality conflicts which have brought the Commit-
tee to this unfortunate action.

The House Select Committee on Intelligence has been given one of
the most sensitive and important responsibilities which has faced the
Congress since World War II. It has been no easy task to pierce the
veil of secrecy which has surrounded the intelligence community’s op-
erations since our nation became the most powerful country on earth—
and it has been more difficult still to come to grips with some of the
most fundamental questions at the heart of the operation of a secret
intelligence function in a democratic society. If I do say so, I believe
that the Select Committee, with the aid of unprecedented cooperation
on the part of the Ford Administration, has been conducting a eruci-
ally important investigation in a most honest and responsible manner.

It is in this context of respect for the dedication and hard work of
the Committee that I must express my regret that the majority has
chosen to take the hasty and mistaken action of voting a contempt
resolution against the Secretary of State. In my opinion, the Commit-
tee has made an unfortunate and serious error in citing the Secretary
for contempt, and this resolution does not merit the support of the
full House of Representatives.

Secretary Kissinger ought not to have been cited in contempt for re-
fusing to surrender State Department documents for which the Presi-
dent of the United States has aserted a claim of executive privilege.
‘The Committee’s subpoena to the Secretary sought “all documents re-
lating to State Department recommending covert action made to the
National Security Council and the Forty Committee and its predeces-
sor committees from January 20, 1961 to the present.” After service of
the subpoena, the appropriate documents were identified and referred
to the White House for review. The Attorney General was asked to
carefully, review these documents and rendered an opinion that execu-
tive privilege could appropriately be asserted. By letter to the Secre-
tary dated November 14, 1975, the Counsel to the President confirmed

(19) .

Therefore, prior to demanding possession of extremely sensitive
documents, the Congress must have. mechanism and an interna] sys-
tem that will provide safeguards for the protection of these vital
national secrets, No such safeguards Presently exist. Current House
rules, committee structures diversified intelligence jurisdiction, and

House customs must be altered before closely held secrets can be prop-

erly protected., . . :

n past Congresses, highly classified matters and extremely sensi-
tive situations have been handled by a few key members of Congress
on behalf of the entire body. Exposure of these vital national secrets
was very limited. . cane

Beginning with the 98rd Congress, and accelerating ra] idly in the
94th Congress, numerous “reforms” have drastically altered past prac-
tices. While the new reforms have greatly increased individual mem-
ber participation in the legislative processes, these same reforms have
proportionately placed the nation in jeopardy concerning official
secrets. .

"As an example, present rules in the House of Representatives allow
any member to have full and unlimited access to all committee files
and to any document within those files. There is no practical way to
keep any member from “leaking” any information to the press, re-
gardless of the security classification. There is no legal way to prevent
an individual member from unilaterally releasing all or any part of
an official secret by simply going to the floor and making it public in
a floor speech. The wide diversity of opinions between individual Con-

| gressmen makes this procedure dangerous to national security and
toreign relations. . .

In summary, the Select Committee on Intelligence has presented a
good “technical argument” but has failed to show significant cause
for bringing contempt action against Secretary of State Henry Kis-
singer, would leave itself open for serious public criticism for failing
to establish mechanisms to responsibly handle the classified and sensi-
tive matters that it seeks in the subpoenas. .

While the committee’s contention that “Congress has a right to the
material summoned in the subpoenas” has merit, there is no real press-
ing need for these documents, at this time. They can be subpoened at
a later date, after the House has established firm rules and procedures
that will properly protect the extremely sensitive and highly classified
national secrets that are involved. . .

By putting its own house in order before pressing this issue, Con-
gvess would then be able to rightfully and responsibly press ahead with
proper oversight functions. If a Constitutional confrontation should
then be necessary ; the issue would be clear to the public, the Congress
would not be subject to criticism, and national security would not be
endangered.

Any possible benefits at this time, in citing Secretary Kissinger for
contempt of Congress, are far outweighed by the grave dangers of
undermining public confidence in both Congress and the Administra-
tion. Neither branch would win, and the nation would lose.

Members are strongly urged to oppose the resolution to cite the
Secretary of State for contempt of Congress.

Dae Mrrorp.

We are left with the choice of accepting this claim of Executive privi-
lege or of citing the Secretary of State—two distasteful alternatives.

In my opinion, the more serious consequence would result from
allowing the doctrine of Executive privilege to be extended under this
claim, ‘The security classification system should not cloud the issue.
The right of privacy of a sitting President is not challenged here. The
right of privacy of private communications to previous Presidents is
mot the issue.

But, the President must not be allowed to censor material that goes
from one department of government to another by hiding it from Con-

‘essional committees, ‘The doctrine of Executive privilege must not

e allowed to hide or distort the history of previous Administrations
when the security classification system is not involved. The claim that
government employees in the State Department or the National Secu-
rity Council are advisers or aides or counselors to the President, who
are part of the consultation process which qualifies for Executive privi-
lege makes the Presidency, rather than the United States Government,
the object of loyalty of those who work for the United States, This
claim, if allowed to stand unchallenged, can be extended and infinitum
to nearly all important government documents or officials which would
result in a complete destruction of the system of Congressional over-
sight. This claim, unchecked, makes the office of the President into a
monarchy.

The same assertion can be made (though it hasn’t been) for CIA
documents to the National Security Council, going back to the incep-
tion of the agency. The same claim applies fo Defense Department
recommendations; to Transportation Department recommendations to
the Federal Energy Administration; or Commerce Department rec-
ommendations to the Council of Economic Advisers in prior Adminis-
trations, etc., etc. Perhaps more illustrative of the serious potential
consequences of this claim of Executive privilege is to try to differen-
tiate between the present claim and the testimony of an official of a
previous Administration before a Congressional committee. Could
President Ford prevent former Secretaries Rogers or Rusk from testi-
fying as to State Department recommendations. during their tenure
in office on the grounds of Executive privilege? If he can prevent the

_ documents from being delivered, can’t he stop testimony? It would

seem so.

Most importantly, if this claim is allowed to stand, how is a Con-
gressional committee to have oversight of the intelligence community?
Recommendations from the CIA, the DIA, and the State Department
with respect to covert action programs and other intelligence matters
go through the Forty Committee and the National Security Council. If
this material is subject to the claim of Executive privilege, then Con-
gress can be effectively by-passed in the future, as it has been in the
past in this critical area. The right of Congress to participate in de-
cisions of utmost urgency would once again be emasculated. Obviously,
the Legislative Branch cannot allow this claim to go unchallenged. ~

Hopefully, a solution will be forthcoming, short of pursuing this
citation, but it must not be by Congressional acquiescence in this claim
of Executive privilege. ;

DISSENTING VIEWS OF THE HONORABLE
DALE MILFORD .

The contempt of Congress citation against Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger should be opposed by members of Congress for three very
important reasons.

First, this unprecedented contempt action will force this nation into.
a full-fledged Constitutional confrontation between the Administra-
tive and Legislative branches of this government, which could result
in a disastrous loss of public confidence in both branches of
government. .

Second, while both the Administrative and Legislative branches can
argue ‘fine points of law that would tend to justify their positions in
this dispute, both also have “dirty hands” and both have failed to
make in-house corrections that would prevent a confrontation.

Third, Congress is not prepared to Protect the extremely sensitive
documents that it is seeking from the Administration, and its failure
to protect these documents could bring irreparable harm to this na-
tion’s foreign relations and national defense efforts.

A Constitutional confrontation between branches of this nation is a
very serious matter. As in any battle, there will be a loser. In this in-
stance, both sides could very possibly lose.

Public confidence, in a government’s structure and its system is an
absolute necessity for the survival of a democratic regime. A Consti-
tutional confrontation, brought about by a serious national need or as
a result of well-defined issues, can maintain or even build public con-
fidence. On the other hand, such a confrontation that is politically
motivated or that is based on nebulous and abstract points of law can
quickly destroy public confidence in both sides of the controversy. The
latter is particularly the case when the people know or suspect. wrong-
doing or incompetence on the part of either competing branch.

During recent months, the media has literally saturated the Amer-
ican people with accounts of improper past activities conducted by
7 Administrative agencies. Parenthetically, (although with less press
f coverage) the Congress has also been negligent by failing to maintain
I
¥

pong

proper oversight responsibilities. The sins must be equally shared.
i The gist of the arguments involved in the resolution to cite Secre-
oat tary Kissinger for contempt concerns the right of a Congressional
committee to obtain extremely sensitive documents that are in the
possession of the Administration. On the surface, this would appear
to be a substantive issue and one of considerable importance.

Few, if any, members of Congress would disagree with the commit-
tee’s position that Congress does indeed have a right to full knowledge
of all activities that are carried out by our intelligence agencies, All
responsible members of this body will also agree that the unauthor-

- ized release of extremely sensitive intelligence information can be
’ very detiremental to this country’s welfare.

In conriection with this request, Special Agent Awe
was interviewed in his office on 12/3/75 by House Select
Committee Staff Member, Tina Yamamotto. She was specifically
interested in the nature of the Information Intelligence
Handling Committee (IHC) and its rélationship to. the
U. S. Intelligence Board (USIB), the extent of FBI
participation in this committee, the value of the committee
and whether it should be continued, and to determine if
there was any FBI objection to the fact that CIA serves
as chairman of the committee.

It was explained that IHC was one of many ‘'p
committees of USIB. IHC has as its general mission the oO
promotion of effective interchange of Intelligence informa-
tion among the members of the Intelligence Community from
a records management point of view.
tion in the activities of IHC has been limited to the status

sharing of information regarding record problems, automation
efforts and the efforts toward certain data standards has
been and will continue to be important from cost effective
point of view for all the members which should result in

It was explained that the FBI has no objection
to CIA serving as chairman of the IHC committee, since the
Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) also
serves as the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) for
the Intelligence Community. For CIA to continue in this
capacity would seem appropriate and the FBI would interpose
no objection, insofar as IHC committee activities are
concerned.

On 12/9/75, SA John M. Kirsch was interviewed

Oliphant in the presence of SA Paul Daly. Mr. Oliphant who is representing
Congressman Pike's Committee inquired concerning social activities at
Harper's Ferry, West Virginia. SA Kirsch advised that he had attended
two such gatherings primarily composed of Bureau personnel (present and
former) during early 1974, the first such occasion being in January or
February and the second a few months later, probably April, 1974. In
response to Mr. Oliphant's question as to who invited SA Kirsch to attend
Harper's Ferry, he was advised that SA Kirsch attended at the invitation
of Assistant to the Director, Deputy Associate Director Thomas J. Jenkins
who was at that time Assistant Director in charge of Training Division.
Mr. Oliphant asked what the costs were for meals and lodging at Harper's
Ferry and SA Kirsch advised that at best he could recall the costs were
not excessive and probably $12 to $15 covered the entire affair. Certainly
no more than $20 was expended at either of the two outings by SA Kirsch.
SA Kirsch did not recall exactly who collected for the meals but believes \) vi
it was probably Mr. John Mohr. Mr. Oliphant asked what the table stakes
were at Harper's Ferry and SA Kirsch advised that while he could not
recall specifically, he believed they were rather low, perhaps 10¢ and 25¢.
THT
SA Kirsch was specifically asked if he had met Mr. Joe Tate |
at which he replied that he had met him on one or two occasions but that he
wouldnit know Joe (Taté if he met him on the street. He was then asked if
he knew Mr. Gus Oberdick. SA Kirsch advised that he has seen Mr. Oberdick
a half dozen occasions during the past 20 years and noted that Mr. Oberdick
was a friend of former SAC Henry Sloan:: Mie, SA Kirsch stated that he did not
believe Gus Oberdick would know him if,were to see him on the street.
Mr. Oliphant asked if SA Kirsch had ever been assigned to the Administrative

arranged for the purchase of any law enforcement equipment from

Mr. Oberdick to which he replied no. Mr. Oliphant asked if SA Kirsch

had ever recommended any type of weapon or equipment be purchased

in the police line at which time he was advised that SA Kirsch had in fact,

as part of his duties, made recommendations for a variety of such purchases
over the past several years. He was advised that the only large purchase

of firearms with which SA Kirsch had anything to do was the acquisition of
military weaponry from the Department of Defense for use by FBI
Apprehension Teams.

Steven Blackhurst, Assistant Special Counsel for

House Select Committee has requested a meeting tentatively
scheduled for 3 p.m., Friday, 12/5/75, to discuss the dispo-
sition of documents and materials furnished that Committée by
the FBI. Attending the meeting from the House Select Committee
will be Jackie Hess.

We have learned that the CIA has recommended to the
House Select Committee that the material they furnished be”
jturned over to Archives with future access to that material cat
being governed by procedures set up by the CIA. This. corldept~’.
was reportedly well received by Staff Members of the Com#fttt ee,
although it has not been finalized. The obvious advantage, af
this procedure is. to in effect take the material from the }
mittee and place it in the custody of the Executive Brafté
may, in part, obviate problems created by the House Rule“i1 which
states material in possession of a House Committee is accessible.
to. all Congressmen in the House, since the material may not be
considered to be in the possession of the House Select Committee.
All indications are that captioned Committee will go out of
existence in January and the problem of access subsequent to the
termination of the Committee by Congressional Staffers or Con-
_gressmen themselves is something that will have to be addressed

DARTHARD MAURICE EDWARD PERRY

Darthard Maurice Edward Perry, FBI Number
866-431 G, voluntarily appeared at the Los Angeles
FBI Office on February 12, 1974, and claimed he
wished to offey his assistance as an informant as
regards the Black Panther Party (BPP), a characteriza-
tion of which is contained in the appendix hereto,
and the Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA), a charactéri-
gation of which is contained in the appendix hereto,
the latter having received publicity in the news
media from the February 44, 1974, kidnapping of Patricia
Campbell Hearst. Darthard Perry was interviewed by
Special Agents William Otto Heaton and Brendan 0.
‘Cleary. He was found to have no information ‘concerning
the SLA but to have a somewhat extensive knowledge
of former leaders and events concerning the BPP.

Darthard Perry advised he was a 1969 Los
Angeles BPP chapter applicant but that he had never
been admitted to membership and had néver participated
in activities of the BPP.

At the time of initial interview on
February 12, 1974, Darthard Perry claimed he was
then employed and had been employed for the past
several years by the Watts Writer's Workshop, Los
Angeles, California. He produced a publication
entitled, Watts Writer's Workshop bearing his photo-
graph over the name Ed Riggs, Video Workshop. There
is no publication date on the pamphlet but the latest
date appearing therein is 1969.

conclusions of the FBI.. It is the property of the FBI

.DARTHARD MAURICE ‘EDWARD PERRY -

Darthard Perry described the Watts
Writer's Workshop as a theatrical
work group providing a forum for
the expression and promotion of
7 black theatrical talent, founded
: in August, 1965.

. From March 6, 1974, until March 21, 1975,
Darthard Perry was in active FBI informant status.
The BPP -had ceased to be a viable organization in
the Los Angeles, California area by 1972. Darthard ~
Perry was never guided, directed, or targeted by

, any FBI Agent to penetrate the BPP’as it had ceased
to exist in the.Los Angeles area, nor to penetrate
the Watts Writer's Workshop in Los. Angeles, California,
and the FBI has never conducted an investigation of
the Watts Writer's Workshop. Darthard Perry never
furnished any information concerning Watts Writer's
Workshop activities or personnel.

However, Darthard Perry did furnish infor-
mation to the Los Angeles FBI of various extremist
individuals identified as former members of the BPP,
principally members or followers of the Black
Liberation Army (BLA), a characterization of which.
is contained in the appendix hereto.

On May 31, 1974, Perry advised that Renee
Moore, also known as "Peaches" Moore, was urging
urban guerrilla warfare in the black community of
Los Angeles, California, and that she was in contact
with a BLA member, John William Washington, also °
known as Long John.

: On June 5, 1974, Perry advised that Byron
Walter Bartlett, a former BPP activist had applied
for and was seeking to obtain employment as a police
officer .by the Los Angeles Police Department without
His prior background being known to that law
enforcement agency.

DARTHARD MAURICE EDWARD PERRY

On June 19, 1974, Perry advised that "Peaches"
Moore went to San Francisco, California, on Monday,
June 17, 1974, following her appearance on a radio
talk show at station KPFK-FM, North Hollywood, Calif-
ornia, on whith she advocated urban guerrilla warfare.

On June 24, 1974, Perry advised he attended
a meeting on June 23. 1974; of a BLA cell led by
John William Washington, in Los Angeles, California.
Conversation centered on ways to free Elmer Gerard
Pratt, also known as "Geronimo", a former BPP leader-

“BLACK LIBERATION ARMY

_The Black Liberation Army (BLA) is a loose-
knit urban guerrilla organization whose self-described
purpose is to overthrow the Government, In announcing
the BLA's purpose, the 2/29/72 issue of "Right On!,"
its official publication stated. . . "The purpose of the
BLA is the same as that of the Tupamaros. in Uruguay,
Frelimo in Mozambique, and all the other liberation forces,
The BLA is simply brothers and sisters who have gone
underground to put all the revolutionary rhetoric and
theory into practice, paargeey

Since May, 1971, the BLA has been involved in
armed confrontations with law enforcement officials .
resulting in eight police officers being killed and

‘another 28 being wounded or injured. Since July, 1971,

the BLA has been involved in excess of 20 known bank

BLACK PANTHER PARTY
FORMERLY KNOWN AS THE BLACK PANTHER PARTY FOR SELF-DEFENSE

The Black Panther Party (BPP), organized in December,

1966, at Oakland, California, by Huey P. Newton and Bobby George
Seale, has the publicly-stated purpose of organizing black
people to take control of the life, politics and destiny of
the black community. The Party, operating the Black Panther
Intercomminal News Service, publishes a newspaper called
“The Black Panther," which at one time openly advocated the
Mj use of guns and guerrilla tactics in a revolutionary program

‘ to end the oppression of the black: people but since early
. 1971 has spoken for a survival program pending revolution.

BPP national headquarters, aka Black Panther Intercom-

munal Headquarters, is located in Oakland, California.

While openly advocating direct overthrow of the
U. S. Government by force and violence until 1971, leaders
have since avoided extreme statements in favor of calling
for action within the established order. Newton, in an
interview appearing in the May, 1973, issue of "Playboy"
Magazine, stated the Panthers' chief ambition is to change
the American Government by-any means necessary but that
poneaeecaey such change will be through armed violence.

Despite its claimed dedication to community service,
indicators of the BPP's continued attraction to violence persist.
Since July, 1974, Newton and other BPP members have.been arrested
in Oakland, California, for threatening police officers,
murder of a 17-year-old female and the pistol whipping of
Newton's tailor. Newton failed to appear on these charges and
is now.a local fugitive. Additionally, one died and three

+ were wounded as a result of a shooting at a BPP-sponsored
dance in Oakland, California, in October, 1974.

SYMBIONESE LIBERATION ARMY

‘ "The Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA) was reportedly
formed in the Summer of 1973, in California. An SLA
document captioned, "Declaration of Revolutionary War and

the Symbionese Program," dated 8/21/73, states" . . . Therefore,

we, of the Symbionese Federation of the SIA... do now, by
the rights of our children and people and by force of arms
and with every drop of our blood, declare revolutionary war
against the fascist, capitalist class, We support by

for self-determination and independence within the

United States and the world, and hereby offer to all
liberation movements, revolutionary workers' groups and

The SLA has claimed credit for the 11/6/73 assassination of
Dr. Marcus Foster, Oakland, California, School Superintendent;
the 2/4/74 kidnaping of Patricia Campbell Hearst, daughter
of newspaper publisher-owner Randolph A, Hearst; and the.

The Attorney General

NOTE:

The Fund For the Republic (FFR) was incorporated in
December, 1952. Today it is better known as the Center for the
Study of Democratic Institutions (CSDI), under which title it
has published its numerous studies throughout the years, We
have 21 volumes concerning this organization (Bureau file
100-391697). Throughout the years we have correlated information
concerning persons connected with this organization as well as
activities of the organization. Numerous individuals connected
with FFR have, in the past, had questionable associations with
persons or organizations suspected of having subversive affilia-
tions. From 1953 to 1955, we followed the projects and studies
of the FFR and kept the Attorney General advised of the back-
ground of the various officers and employees of the FFR. In
August, 1955, W. H. Ferry, the vice president of the FFR, made
it known that the Fund intended to investigate the FBI and the
American Legion. The Director, at that time, instructed that
a comprehensive memorandum be prepared on the FFR with background
data on the principal officers and that this memorandum be kept
up-to-date at all times, This running memorandum began as a
continuation of a monogram on the FFR prepared by the Central
Research Section in November, 1955. It was brought up-to-date
every three months since January 1, 1956, by the Liaison Section.
By memorandum July 14, 1958, it was pointed out that the memorandum
had become too cumbersome for Director Hoover's use and it was
recommended and approved that it be discontinued. Many of the
memoranda dealt with the investigation of the FFR by the Internal
Revenue Service which had been going on for several years and
which concerned the eligibility of the Fund of the FIR as a
tax-exempt organization. A thorough review of these volumes
concerning the FFR disclosed no active investigation of it by
the FBI. It is noted that HSC Staff Member John Atkisson when
queried 11/12/75, as to the motivation behind this inquiry,
advised SA Thomas J. McNiff that an associate of his from California,
suggested to him that the HSC should look into the Bureau's
interest in CSDI, as the Bureau probably used the same investi-
gative techniques against CSDI as ha¥ebeen publicly alleged in

the Bureau investigation of Institute for Policy Studies.

Reference is made to HSC letter dated October 28,
1975, Item 11, which requests access to any and all files
eonceming the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions
(Cspi), Santa Barbara, California.

As a result of an agreement reached on November 12,
1975, between Special Agent T. J. UcNiff of the FBI and HSC
Staff Member John Atkisson, the following is being submitted
in response to the aforementioned request:

The CSDi has never been the subject of an Investi-
gation by the FBI, nor has the FBI directed informants or utilized
other investigative techniques against this organization.
However, in the past we have gathered public source material
regarding it and have reviewed and researched pamphlets,

: » ¢ periedicals, surveys, and books promulgated by it, when the
OC content of the aforementioned material was of interest and
germane to the work of the FRI. The vast bulk of the research
conducted by the FBI pertained to Communism and related matters
due. bv, Od took place during the peried of time when CSDL was known as
op aD ade the Fund For the Nepublic (FFR).

U. 8, HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE
ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (HSC)

Reference is made to the hearings held on November 18, 1975,
before the U. S. House Select Committee on Intelligence Activities (HSC)
at which testimony was given by James B. Adams, Assistant to the Director-
Deputy Associate Director, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI); W. Raymond
Wannall, Assistant Director, Intelligence Division, FBI; and other FBI
representatives. The information set forth below is in response to specific
questions raised during the hearings.

One aspect of the hearings dealt with the FBI's investigative interest
in the Institute for Policy Studies (IPS). You asked Mr. Adams if a phone
call from your Administrative Assistant to IPS was intercepted and recorded
by the FBI. You specifically referred to information attributed to a source,
Ws T-4, which appeared in a document labeled WFO 1009-46784.

From a review of our file, it was determined the symbol, Wr T-4,
was used in this instance to designate a one-time retrieval of some IPS
trash abandoned by a trash truck at a Washington, D. C., sanitary dunip on
August 23, 1972. The recovered trash included carbon typewriter ribbons,
from which information was subsequently transcribed. The actual
transcription from one ribbon read as follows:

"Rirs. Woolbert of Congressman Pike's office was asked by
Byron Johnson to call you. He is running for the 5th Congressional District
of Congress. He wonders if you will be willing to go around and round up a
___ group of liberal, anti-war folks for the evening of August 6-12th. She expects
én. you to call her when you get back."

U. & House Select Committee on Intelligence Activities (HSC) v

You requested information concerning attacks by the IPS on the
FBI mentioned in the document labeled WFO 100-46784.

Information responsive to your inquiry is contained in pages
2 through § of the report of our Washington Field Office entitled "Institute
for Policy Studies, 1520 New Hampshire Avenue, N.W., Washington, D. C.;
IS - REVACT," dated March 15, 1973. A copy of this report was furnished
to the HEC by letter dated November 14, 1975. As the information is already
available to you and is classified "Confidential," it is not being submitted
herewith for inclusion in the public record.

Congressman Dellums inquired as to the FBI's basis for the
investigation of the IPS. He asked if the FBI's investigative interest in
TPS was based on an association between IPS and “Ramparts” magazine,
rather than to determine the degree of association between IPS and the
Students for a Democratic Society (DS).

| An investigation of IPS was initiated on June 20, 1968, by the

Yashington Field Office of the FBI based upon information set forth in a
communication dated June 19, 1968, from the New York Office of the FBI.
This comraunication, captioned "Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), "
contained information from a source who had furnished reliable information
in the past that on May 27, 1968, Arthur I. Waskow of IPS, Washington,
D. C., had contacted Jeff Jones of the New York Regional Office of SDS.

Vaskow reportedly advised Jones that his name had been included among
50 young, intelligent, leftist militants recommended to attend a three-day
raeeting of the Foreign Folicy Association (FPA) at the New York Hilton
Hotel, New York City, on May 27-29, 1968.

The source expected members of SDS to attend and possibly
attempt to dominate the meetings.

The investigation of IPS was initiated to determine its association

With SDS and what, if any, influence the New Left, of which SDS was an
integral part, had on the FPA.

U. &. House Select Comimittee on Intelligence Activities (HSC)

Later in October of 1968, the Baltimore FBI Office reported
information relating to a 1908 trip to Cuba by SDS members. "Raxaparts"
magazine was preparing an article, with some apparent cooperation from
IPS, on this trip by SDS members. Consequently, FBI Headquarters sent
instructions on November 1, 1968, to appropriate field offices to determine
if there was a relationship between "Ramyarts" and IPS, inasmuch as both
had demonstrated an interest in £DS.

In response to the inquiry of Conzressman MeClory, there are
currently 110 members of the focialist Workers Party (S¥/P) on the
Administrative Index (ADEX).

In discussing the FBI inquiry concerning Lori Paton, Congressman
Johnson asked when the inquiry stopped and how long it took to establish that
Biss Paton was a high school student. At subsequent points both you and
Congressman Kasten made similar inquiries regarding this matter.

Miss Paton first came to the attention of the FBI in mid-February,
1973, when her.name and address were obtained from a legal mail cover
on the headquarters of the SWP, New York City. This information was
forwarded by letter dated February 28, 1973, to our Newark Office for the
purpose of identifying her and determining whether any further inquiry was
warranted. The Newark Office reviewed its indices and contacted established
confidential sources in an effort to determine the reason for her contact with
the SWP. These inquiries proved negative. On March 22, 1973, Newark
opened an individual case on Miss Paton and requested a further inquiry at
Chester, New Jersey, to determine her identity and whether she was involved
in subversive activities. On March 28, 1973, inquiries were made by our
Resident Agent at Chester, New Jersey, with the local credit bureau and
the Chief of Police, which indicated hiiss Paton had probably graduated
from the local hish school. Later on this same date, our Resident Agent
contacted the principal and vice principal at the high school and determined
that she was in fact still a student there and had probably contacted the SP
in regard to one of her school courses. No further inquiries were made
regarding Miss Paton. The Resident Agent, in the normal course of his

business, dictated and forwarded to his Newark headquarters the results of
his inquiry in a memorandum dated April 2, 1973. The Newark case Agent

routinely reviewed the information from the Chester Resident Agent,
recommended closing, and on May 7, 1973, the case was officially closed.

The above information concerning Miss Paton is furnished for
inclusion in the transcript of the hearings concerning FBI surveillance
activities, November 18, 1975, at line 19, page 4165.

it is requested that all of the above information be made a part
of the official record of the November 18, 1975, hearings.
