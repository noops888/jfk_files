i information to SA JAMES, W. STEVENSON on extremely confidential
ms basis. KARELL is a former Lieutenant (Career Officer) on the
Havana Police Department and remained in Cuba after the Batista
overthrow for almost a year, having served as First Assistant
Governor General of Havana Province under CASTRO until he fled
the country to escape political persecution in the early part
of 1960. KARELL has known JESUS GOMEZ since the latter war
14 years old and knew of his father before him, He has previously
furnished information: re Cuban matters to the NYO of an innocuous
nature and though his reliability is untested, he appears sincere
and knowledgeable. uw

For information of Newark, KARELL has recently been
_threatened by GOMEZ -along the lines as described in enclosed
letterhead memorandum. Newark should exercise great caution
to protect the identity of KARELL in its investigation of

. Gaptioned subjects. KARELL prefers he be contacted through his
New York business office, rather than at his residence. g u

Newark is requested to conduct investigation to
_ determine the background of GOMEZ and SANCHEZ GARCIA and to
determine through its sources if they are engaged in activities
inimical to the security interests of the U. S. U

Two extra copies of enclesed letterhead memorandum
are being furnished Newark in the event Newark desires to
furnish same to INS, Newark. .

NYO will attempt to obtain additional information
concerning subjects through its sources. NYO Indices negative
re subjects. eet :
