source in mid-December that during her recent visit to Cuba her

son

told her that Cuban leaders now feel they will have to rely more and

more. on their own efforts to promote Communist peretration in South

America. Guerrillas will be used on a large scale after they have

received training in Cuba, Guevara said. He explained to his mother that

this 1s necessary since both he and Castro feel Khrushchev."

"let them

down" and has no further Interest in spreading-Communism In South Americaâ€¦

Guevara added that he and Castro believe they and the Chinese are

better Communists than Khrushchey. (CIA DD/p. Buenos Aires, 19 December,
