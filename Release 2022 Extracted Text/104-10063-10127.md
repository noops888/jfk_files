The following information is for your background use
only. It should not be discussed with any foreign

Nationals, including the British and Canadians.

British Virgin Islands

‘ 1, Although information received in October 1970 alleged
“that a new Black Power group known as "New World" existed in
the U.S, Virgin Islands, and that one chapter had been formed
ain the:-British Virgin Islands, there has been no confirmation
of the existence of the group in either territory. Black
Power sympathizers undoubtedly exist in the British Virgin
Islands, but there is no reliable evidence so far that they
have organized themselves into a cohesive group to challenge
the present administration.

Dominica

2, The Black Power movement of Dominica published the
second issue of its magazine "Flambeau" on 21 November. It
stressed the importance of moving out of the social. economic
‘and cultural: norm to achieve Black identity. <

c_ \Comment: The popularity of "Flambeau" way be accounted

Grenada

3. Twenty-two nurses at the General Hospital in

St. George's staged a protest demonstration on 7 November

organization, National Action Front (NAF), held meetings
in support of the nurses. The nurses' dispute continued
to escalate during December. Comment:
According to newspaper reports, on 19 Decemper, the police
used tear gas to eject a number of nurses and supporters who
had occupied the Ministry of Health, and 24 persons, including
Morris Bis ho p of the NAF, were arrested and charged
with assembling to commit riot.) A number of nurses: were
charged on 16 December with assaulting the matron and
assistant matron of the hospital by imprisoning them in
the matron's office. (Headquarters Comment: Morris Bishop

_ CSDB-312/00419-71 and/or Michael Bis ho p, reported
in CSDB-312/02061-70.)
