forwarding this list to New York as one of the names thereon

may have some significance to the New York Office. The names

are alphabetical by day, "procedencia” is home.area, "S.R." or
"sin reservacion" means they arrived without reservation, and | 4A
"cliente," means reservation was made by the person himself.

The following comment refers to information that an
attorney named "Bernabey" (phonetic) was going to attempt to
arrange for Subject's residence in Mexico. As reported, this
almost certainly refers to BERNAB! URADO, probably the most
famous criminal attorney in Mexico. It is considered that
JURADO's name would be among the first mentioned by persons
with’ any knowledge of the criminal scene in Mexico. It is not
considered that he would be a logical choice to arrange a
delicate immigration matter, nor that he would be recommended
for such by anyone knowledgeable about conditions in Mexico, ‘eye

It has been obvious for some time that SAMUEL

although officially declared undesirable. - Comment on m this ie -
situation has ‘appeared in the’ national magazines. Although———
LANSKY is not .known to have contacted GIANCANA on his previous
trips to Mexico, GIANCANA would be the obvious logical choice
to contact concerning seeking asylum in Mexico, legally or
illegally , (2) Ae (cy

reliability, commented I-4-73 that~GIANCANA had_a foolproof

contact in the Mexican Government] (Be)

He claimed that LANSKY did consult with GIANCANA
concerning coming to Mexico, but did so too late and there
was not time to make any sort of arrangement. (EGY

It appears that none of the information herein can _
be reported for dissemination and any extensive investigation
might also tend to prejudice these sources. In addition,
investigation concerning LANSKY in Mexico is now somewhat
historical; however, it is considered of some benefit to
identif Subject's supposed lawyers, either in Mexico or the
