forwarding this list to New York as one of the names thereon

may have some significance to the New York Office

The names

are alphabetical by day, "procedencia" is home area,

"S.R." or

"sin

reservacion" means

they arrived without reservation, and

"cliente,"

means reservation was made by the person himself.

The following comment refers to information that an

attorney named "Bernabey" (phonetic) was going to attempt to

arrange for Subject's residence in Mexico. As reported, this

almost certainly refers to BERNABESSURADO, probably the

most

criminal attorney in Mexico.

It is considered that

JURADO's name would be among the first mentioned by persons

with' any knowledge of the criminal scene in Mexico. It is not.

considered that he would be a logical choice to arrange a

delicate immigration matter, nor that he would be recommended

for such by anyone knowledgeable about conditions in Mexico.(gy*

It has been obvious

for some time that SAMUEL

• GIANCANA, BuFile 92-3171, has

an excellent arrangement permit-

ting him to more or less

although officially declared undesirable. Comment on

reside permanently in Mexico' this f-31

situation has 'appeared in the'

national magazines.

Although

LANSKY is not known to have contacted GIANCANA on his previous

trips to Mexico, GIANCANA would be the obvious logical choice

to contact concerning seeking asylum in Mexico, legally or

Illegally.(S

(C)

In this vein,

MEX-334-PCI, of questionable

réliability, commented

1-4-73 that GIANCANA hada foolproof

method of getting in and out of Mexico and and an excellent

contact in the Mexican Government, (SC)

He claimed that LANSKY did consult with GIANCANA

concerning coming to Mexico, but did so too late and there

was not time to make any sort of arrangement.(5C)4)

It appears that none of the information herein can

be reported for dissemination and any extensive investigation

might also tend to prejudice these sources.

In addition,

investigation concerning LANSKY in Mexico is now somewhat

historical; however, it is considered of some benefit to

identify Subject's supposed lawyers, either in Mexico or the

U.S.
