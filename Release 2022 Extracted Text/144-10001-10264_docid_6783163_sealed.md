MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD 15 June 1978

SUBJECT: Actions Taken by NSA to Locate Information Related
to the Assassination of President Kennedy

A. Over the past fourteen and one-half years, NSA has
performed a number of separate in-depth reviews of materials in
its files in an attempt to isolate data that might be relevant
to the assassination of President Kennedy. Nothing of significance
has been determined as a result of those reviews.

1. November-December 1963 - Immediately after the
assassination, NSAinitiated a large-scale manual and machine
review of available SIGINT, including all U.S./Cuba traffic (NSA
intercepted messages at an average of 1,000 per day at that time).
A computer search was initiated using Oswald's name as the minimum
for research criteria. Additionally, all traffic between Cuba/New
Orleans and Cuba/Dallas was manually reviewed (an analyst involved
recalled that 25 to 50 analysts reviewed the traffic manually,
along with traffic from Cuba and some Soviet traffic). Sometime
during the search, items from the Oswald address book provided by
the FBI were added to the search criteria.

2.  1964°- Warren Commission - The Commission, in the
person of Allan Dulles, asked NSA to review the exhibits for any
secret writings or.codes which might have been contained in the
documents. It also appears that NSA searched’ records for information
on the basis of other Warren Commission requests made informally
by Allen Dulles.

3. November 1975 - Senate Select Committee to Study
Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities (SSC):

In response to an SSC request on the Assassination,

NSA reviewed its Soviet and Cuban files, including Cuban military.
The search was also for material involving Marina Oswald, Jack Ruby
or Earl Ruby (a Harvest run was made). [or oalteaetic was also
reviewed, looking for information concernin iSwald's visit to
Mexico.

4, June 1976 - Pursuant to FOIA requests asking for
Material relating to Lee Harvey Oswald and the Assassination

Aa USC 2107(5)'g)(2(D XI)



®. Doc{D: 6783163: *

of President John F. Kennedy, NSA again searched the files.
Strongbox searches were made on the following:

Lee Harvey Oswald 1966 - 1976
Assassination of

President Kennedy 1966 - 1976
Earl Ruby 1966 - 1977
Cobo Cleaners 1966 - 1977

5. December 1976 - Senate Select Committee on Intelli-
gence (SSCI) - Requested all the material we had available on the
Cuban agent problem. It consisted of 485 reports for the period
1961 - 1965. All of these reports were received by Committee
Staff Members.

6. March 1978 - House Select Committee on Assassinations -
Requested all data on Cuban intelligence network and other materials
relating to the Assassination. All Cuban agent material (1961 ~ 1964)
was reviewed, as was material that had been previously compiled to
respond to the SSCI and SSC requests.

B. As a result of the reviews described above, the following
materials which may have some relevance to.the assassination were
located (referenced material inclosed at numbered tabs):

1. Four Cuban diplomatic messages which contained
official Cuban comments regarding press items that discussed Oswald's
activity in late September 1963 to obtain a visa to travel to
Moscow. There were also comments on'the assassination itself.

The messages are dated in the last week of November 1963.

2. Three Cuban military reports which show that Cuban
military forces did go on alert immediately after the assassination.

: 3. One 1962 Cuban Intelligence message’ concerning the
assassination of Antonio Veciana. This message was to (Puerto
Rico) SERAFIN.

4. One 1966 Cuban Diplomatic message concerning a Spanish
diplomat in Cuba. It referenced a 1960 plan in Cuba to assassinate
an USSR dignitary in Cuba and against ‘Raul Castro Ruz, possibly
-linking it to the CIA.

With relation to the informat on published todaytin the
Rewspaper: Excelsion ‘in Mexico City; affirming that LEE wARVEY:
OSWALD had requested a transit visa for travel to thé’sovist

Government requested informat lon from the officials ef our
Consulate in that city confirming that it ig certgin that 7
Mr. LEG HARVEY OSWALD requested the transit visa for travel te
the Soviet Union on 27 September in the said’ Consulate,

On being informed by the consular officials ‘that. t
office could not grant such a visa without the authoria
of the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Relations, which likewise
would not grant it if it was not previously authorized by the

country of destination, Mr. OSWALD left'the Consulate visibly
disgusted, :

The said visa was never granted,

ie is evident that these sectors planned beforehand ‘to
involve Cuba and the Soviet Union in these deeds. *

Thé inconceivable and inexplicable impunity with which" ar
individual of known penal antecwdents assassinated OSWALD, -the:
principal accused of the assassination of President KENNEDY, in
the presence of the police themselves’ and in the: {5G} of a
prison, demonstrates in a scandalous and indisputable, manner
that the powerful reactionary ‘political forces within the .
United States are making use of all their. resources and influences
.4n order to conceal those who master-minded KENNEDY's assassination,
and the true motives for it. a me . : a eres

World public opinion demands the enlightening of -the deeds.
it is absurd that the political authorities and-the progecuting
attomey of Dallas have declared that the case is closed when
hardly 68 hours have passed since a deed of so great a result as
the assassination of the President of the United Statea. 5

"Since February 1959, Counselor CALDEVILLA has undertaken the

to flee the country to avoid prosecution,

“Along this same line, he also used the aforementioned Miss
CARMEN JIMENEZ GOMEZ, instructing her to infiltrate student
“organizations for the purpose of creating diversionism in the
ideological order, and she established, for this purpose, intimate

Miss JIMENEZ GOMEZ went there and carried out military and political

on that occasion were transmitted to Counselor JAIME CALDEVILLA,

the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, Mr. ANASTAS MIKOYAN,

a guest in Cuba, for which purpose he delivered arms to a group

of counterrevolutionarly elements, It was not executed, according

to what Counselor CALDEVILLA himself claims, because of the

cowardice of the assassins, He.also sought refuge and protection in

the home of his collaborator JOSE LUIS“RODRIGUEZ((A)), for Mr. ISRAEL

an attempt against the life of the Vice Prime Minister and Minister
