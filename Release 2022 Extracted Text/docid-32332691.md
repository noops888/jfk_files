A. MUTUAL INTERESTS OF HOODLUMS AT MEETING

I.

Origin

On April 18, 1958, Albany Confidential Informant

I-28, contact with whom has been insufficient to determine reliability.

and who is an Italian businessman at Apalachin, New York, advised

Special Agents PATRICK A. MUNLEY and JAMES C. MEE that he was

born and raised at Pittston, Pennsylvania, and that he has known

DOMINICK ALAIMO, RUSSELL BUFALINO, JAMES OSTICCO and ANGELO SCIANDRA!

all of Pittston, Pennsylvania, who

are hoodiums who attended instant

BARBARA, SC's estate on November 14, 1957, as

being members oflthe Sicilian Group in the Pittston area.

1-28 related that SANTO VOLPE of Pittston, Pennsylvania,

Is the head of a tie stella me tavern coast and that te 15 le

probably the

individual who gave the orders for the meeting which

was held at BARBARAS.

I-23 said that BARBArA, from his observations

of the sicilians, would rank about either number three or four in

the Sicilian Group:

The informant said that the group that met at BARBARA's

was made up of mostly

"muscle men"

and apparently few of the real

leaders of the Sicilians.

He said that from his knowledge of the

sicilians he would say that the meeting was for the purpose of

Instructing those that were there concerning the new "bosses"

SO.

that they would return to their own areas and pass the word to other

sicilians in the group.

T-28 stated that the Sicilians for years have been

running the "rackets" in the Pittston, Pennsylvania area, and that

he has observed the activities of

the

individuals mentioned above

who were at the meeting and others in the Pittston area, and knows

that they have always been involved in some kind of illegal activity.

On April 25,

1958, T-23 advised SA MUNLEY that he had

talked to SALVATORE (SAM) ALECCIA, with alias BLACKIE ALECCIA,

an

associate of top hoodlum ANTHONY F. GUARNIERI on April 22, 1958.

je said that huecclA told him that ALECCIA and LOUIS CORDI, anotner

associate of GUARNIERI, were supposed to have attended the meeting

at JOSEPH BARBARA's on November 14, 1957,

but did not make it because

i having to work during the day.

Informant said he did not ask

whether they had intended

to be at the meeting in the evening ALECCIA

1 e

allegedly, said that the meeting was

for the purpose of naming the

bosses and that the meeting was strictly a Sicilian Group. Informant

said ALECCIA believes the

informant to be a Sicilian.

On May 7, 1953, T-28 informed SA MUNLEY that

SALVATORE ALECCIA had appeared at informant's place of business

on Tuesday night, May 6, 1957, and he had tried to get ALECCIA

talking, but was

unable

to have him make any conversation.

In respect to

the above information, it is noted

that the investigations of the individual top hooglums who

attended instant meeting have reflected that they are all of

Italian origin and a major portion of them were born abroad, and

became naturalized citizens of the United States.

By letter dated

May 2, 1958, the New York Office

forwarded to the Bureau and to Albany copies of the report of

New York State Acting Commissioner of Investigation ARTHUR L. REUTER

on the activities and associations of persons identified as

present at the residence of JOSEPH BARBARA, Sr. at Apalachin,

New jork, on November 14, 1957, and the reasons for their presence.

This report bears date of April 23, 1958.

* The

report is a

summary of the investigation conducted

by REUTER's office into captioned meeting upon instructions of

the Governor of the

State of New York issued November 15, 1957.

The New York Office received the report May 1, 1958,

from Chief Investigator HYMAN ROSENBIADI of the office of Commissioner

REUTER.

It should be noted that the office of Commissioner of

Investigation is no

longer existent, having been supplanted by the

New york state. Crime Commission, set up by legislative enactment

in 1958.

The New York Office has forwarded summaries of

information on individual hoodlums mentioned in the REUTER report

to interested offices for their files on the particular individual

hoodlums.

Additional details from this report will be set out

hereinafter.

In the instance above. related

from Commissioner

REUTER's report of JOSEPH BARBARA, SR. being stopped and

found in possession of a gun in New York City in 1931,

investigation has determined that he was accompanied by NATALE

EVOLA.

This was approximately 27 years ago. Also with them

was VINCENZO COPPOLA.

The data set forth from Commissioner REUTER'S

report concerning BARBARA's arrest for murder have previously

been reported.

It is noted that these incidents also occurred

approximately 27 years ago, and that the first murder mentioned

was allegedly due to a dispute between the victim and SANiO

VOLPE, SAM VOLPE and CHARLES DURALINO.

In the second murder it is noted that SANTO VOLPE

and ANGELO POLIZZI were allegedly involved and that during

investigation calls were traced. from BARBARA's home to

the

telephone of SALVATORE FALCONE and Brothers, 550 Bleegker

Street, Utica, New York. Brothers SALVATORE and JOSEPH FALCONE

were, of course, attendees at instant meeting. at BARBARA's home.

It is noted that ANGELO POLIZZI was a Detroit hoodlum

who visited JOSEPH BARBARA, SR. at spalachin, New York, not

long before POLIZZI's death in September 1957•

Since the above-mentioned murders occurred nearly

30 years ago, it is seen that the period of friendship covered

is extensive.

In connection with the relationship between BARBARA

and SANTO VOLPE, Albany Confidential Informant I-29, who has

furnished reliable information in the past, on February 10,

1958, made available to SA PATRICK A. MUNLEY

By memorandum to the Director May 9, 1958,

in instant case,

the Pittsburgh Division forwarded copies of

a memorandum detailing comments made by an attorney in

Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Confidential Informant Albany T-32,

in respect. to instant meeting.

T-32 was interviewed after be had

indicated a desire to discuss the meeting with a Bureau

representative.

Pittsburgh commented that T-3? is a politically

prominent figure and a somewhat controversial one since

unconfirmed rumors have linked him with

racket figures over

The rumors have never been

substantiated,

Pittsburgh noted

that I-32 was very close to Mayor DAVID L. LAWRENCE. Of

Pittsburgh who is a likely successor to the governorship of

Pennsylvania in the next election.

It should be nded that T-32 gave the

impression

to interviewing agents that he felt there might be some

possibility JOSEPH FILARDO could be infuenced to talk about

instant meeting as his attitude was far less rigid than that

Of CIVELIA and his position on citizenship more tenuous. T-32

stated that he feels that FILARDO may have attended as a victim

of the group rather than a member of it.

It is believed an

Italian

speaking agent would fare beiter in attempting to

interview PILARDO.

Both FILARDO and CIVEULA are mentioned

specifically below by I-32.

T. 32 was interviewed on May 6, 1958, by Special

Agents DAMON W. PITCHER and JOHN S, PORTELLA: He said that

meeting of the noodlums at Apalachin, New York,

he was telephonically contacted by NICK CIVELLA and an

elderly Italian who owns a bake shop in Kansas City (believed

They requested him to represent them

before, the Federal Grand Jury and State Grand Jury in New

York City.

T-32 said he told the hoodlums he was unable

to represent

them directly, but would look out for their

interests and would arrange for them to obtain counsel

in New York,

which he aid.

I-32 did not identify the counsel

he obtained for CIVELLA and FILARDo.

T-32 met the two hoodlums in New York City the night

before their hearing before the Federal Grand Jury

and, although

he had an eight o'clock apointment, they kept him waiting

until 12:15 A.M.

When they appeared they refused to say anything

to the attorneys. whom I-32 had arranged to represent them.

said that they had conferred with some unnamed persons

while en

route to New York city and had been told to say nothing, and that

24

## Page 7

AL 62-1152

they did not require the services of an attorney; however,

they did decide

to retain the counsel selected by T32 for

their appearances the following day.

The informant related that the elderly baker (FILARDO)

was naturalized about 13 years ago and was extremely afraid.

of losing his citizenship and of being deported.

He had no

record, according to T-32,

and had never even been interrogated

•y police belore.

I-32 said he was unable to speak Engish

very well and was scared to death.

T-32 said that FILARDO gave the impression he would

have talked to the

attorneys except that CIVEILO counseled

him frequently against saying anything, CIVuLLO told

1-32.

that he would not and could not admit to him that he had

been present at the captioned meeting and his story was that

he hau been

in the area to visit a giri friend who was married

and whom he did not care to involve.

CIVELIC said that he

would be unable. to adnit to the Grand Jury that it was raining

outside even if it was at the

time he appeared before them.

I-32 said that the two hoodlums and the attorneys

conferred. for about an hour and a half before the hoodlums

appeared before the Grand Jury and

the attorneys briefed

the hoodlums on what questions they could refuse to answer

and invoke the Fifth Amendment.

A series of possible questions

which they might be asked were

reviewed with them and CIVELLO

would frequently state, with

respect to those directed to the

baker,

conducted in a reception room outside the room where the Grand

Jury was sitting.

T-32 said that numerous witnesses who had been

subpoenaed to appear and who had been in attendance at the.

captioned meeting were present and absolutely refused to

talk to one another and acted like strangers.

'T-B2: related that he had no knowledge of the

subject matter discussed at instant meeting at Apalachin,

but related that from his experience and various contacts

he was of the opinion that

in the late 20's or early 30's a

national organization was formed. for the purpose of controlling

illegal activities.

This organization had a national council

and local "overlord' who would communicate with each other

by courier not trusting mail or telephone contacts.

He stäted

he believed that JoE BIANCO was a courier in the Pittsburgh

district. (It is noted that BIANCO was convicted in about 1951

for Interstate Transportation of Lottery Tickets.

He was

arrested at that time after getting off an airplane with a

## Page 8

1L 62-1152

I-32 said that after talking to both CIVELLO and

FILARDO and observing CIVELLO's attitude toward answering

any questions about the Apalachin meeting he had formulated

the opinion that the meeting was for an illegal purpose

and that those who attended have been warned that

they are

not to discuss its purpose with anyone under any circumstances.

1-32 stated that he feels that the reorganization which he

believed to be the purpose of the meeting was not effected

because of the investigative attention the local, state and

federal agencies have been giving the meeting.

By airtel May 13, 1958, Philadelphia advised that

Confidential Informant I-33, who is widely acquainted in

the Italian underworld in Philadelphia and is probably one

of the best persons in that area to develop infornation

concerning captioned meeting had been contacted on April 15,

29 and on May 7, 1958, but was unable to furnish any additional

information concerning any other neeting.

Philadelphia reported that at the time I-33 was

reactivated ana contacted on January 20, 1950, he pointed

out that the doubes of many concernine the existence of

a mafia should now be settled in view of the publicity

concerning the meeting of hoodlums at palachin on November 14;

1.957.

I-33 said that he felt that the proof of the meeting,

together with the identity of the persons there and the amount

of ready cash on their person should be a concrete example

of the power held by the maria.

The informant advised that

from his contacts in South Philadelphia, he had learned that

this was a meeting of the bosses and under-bosses, but he

did not know the purpose of the neeting other than that

there was some indication of discussion of business which

concerned ALBERT ANASTASIA.

I-33 has referred to the mafia as the "organization"

and he insists that the "organization": is the present day

maria. In his description of the organization, its membership

and activities, according to Philadelphia, ne

has always

stated that to be a member one must be an

Italian, either from

the Old Country or a direct decendent thereor and

must be

sponsored by a member of the organization.

He has pointed out

that by far the majority of the members of the organization

originate either from sicily or from the Province of Calabrie

near the top of the boot in Italy.

Informant is from Clabria,

and is an alien.

He said there are a few individuals who are

believed by him

to be active with the organization whom he

believes originated from Napoli, Italy.

what was the purpose of the meeting at JOSEPH BARBARA'S Apalachin

estate.

He said the only thing he obtained in his conversations

was that the

"Big Men" were meeting,

The informant added that by

"Big Men"

and others.

they had been at BARBARA'S.

Confidential Informant Albany I-28, mentioned previously

herein, advised SA'S MUNLEY and TAMES C. MFE on April 18, 1958,

that JOSEPH BARBARA, SR, from his observations of the sicilians

(whom he alleged composed the group meeting, would be about number

302 number 4 man in the group leadership.

The informant said

that the group which had met at BARBARA's was made up of mostly

"muscle men"

and apparently few of the real leaders of the Sicilians.

The informant said he believed that WILLIAM MEDICO of Pittston,

Pennsylvania, should have been at the meeting because he believed

that MEDICO was directly under SANTO VOLPE and was considered a

big man in the Sicilian group.

The informant said he thought that

"SWIMMEY" DI BELIA of Pittston

whom he identified as "SLUGGER"

Pennsylvania, and another individual

of Pittston, were probably at the

meeting and that 'SLUGGER" had been a chauffeur for SANTO VOLPE and

had driven him many times to New York City. .

The informant said that from his observations in the

BInghanton-Falcott, New York area JOSEPH BA Blinichthand not

have any one individual who would be known as his

man."

He said that BARBARA is looked upon in the area by the Sicilians

there as a

"king" and may be the head of the Sicilian group there.

from his. own knowledge and

follow orders to kill someone,

such as ALBERT ANASTASIA, It was

the informant's opinion that ALBERI ANASTASIA was murdered by the

Sie1l1an 'group

because he was

endeavoring to take control of it.

Confidential Informant Albany T-36, previously mentioned

herein, advised SA PATRICK A. MUNLEY on April 21, 1958, that he

had obtained information concerning instant meeting from conversa-

tiors with ANTHONY FRANK GUARNIERI, hoodlum who attended instant

meeting.

the meeting, he ascertained that the

JOHN MONTANA (Buffalo; SAVERIO and PASQUALE MONACHINO (Aubura, N.Y)g

RUSSELL BUFALINO (Pittston, Pa.), representing SANTO VOLPE of

Pituston; JOSEPH and SALVATORE FALCONE (Utica, N,Y.); VITO GENOVESE

(Newark); and a few others whose names he could not

recall,

said the

rest of the individuals at the meeting were chauffeurs and

bodyguards.

AL 62-1152

previously mentioned herein, succinctly characterizes captioned

meeting as follows:

"The convergence of these men, many

from considerable distances, at Apalachin on November 13 and

14, clearly indicates a planned meeting.

Their accommodations

were reserved in advance by the BARBARAS, their food was

ordered in advance.

The fact that several

traveled by airline

under false names indicates that their purposes were secret."

Confidential Informant Albany I'-46 has been

contacted on a number of occasions in respect to instant

meeting and he said that he has talked to EMANUEL ZICARI,

PASQUALE TURRIGIANO and BARTOLO GUCCIA, all of whom attended

the captioned meeting and in his conversations with these

individuals, I-46 said, he has been unable to develop, any

the reasons why the grous met:

He said

that in his conversations with them the best information he

could obtain from them was the fact that BARBARA, SR. had been

a very sick man for the past year and that these individuals

were all old friends of BARBARA and were visiting

him because

of that reason.

The informant said that he is now making

efforts. to locate a mutal friend of the mentioned hoodlums

who attended the meeting who might be able to furnish him with

information obtained from them.

Confidential Informant. Albany I-8 has been interviewed

on a number of occasions and he advised that he has been in

conversation with JOSEPH MARCONI (brother of LOUIS MARCONI,

associate of some Apalachin hoodlums particularly INTHONY F:

CUARNIERI) on several occasions but has been unable to develop

any information from MARCONI regarding the reason for the

meeting. : The informant said he has more or less steered

the conversation to this: particular affair but has been unable

to get any response from MARCONI other than that a group of

Italian friends met to have a big affair; meanings eating,

drinking and gambling. The informant will continue his efforts

to ascertain the reason for the meeting.

Confidential Informant Albany T-52 advised that

over 20 or 25 years ago the

subject, JOsEPh BArBARA,

SR.,

was

known to have been an associate. of SANTO VOLE, West Pittston,

Pennsylvania. I-52 related that VOLPE and others in

•the

Pittston area

were associated in coal mining activities. He

stated that all the Italians who are known today as hoodlums,

engaged in gambling and other activities, mostly originate.

from

the Pittston, Pennsylvania area and that SANTO VOIPE was

considered the boss of all the Italians in the area.

By airtel May 8, 1958, the Newark Office informed the Bureau that

Lieutenant JOHN HUNT (NA) Of the New Jersey State Police had told SA's MARTIN J.

GASS and OLIN E. JESSUP on May 8; 1958, that a source had informed him that

ANGELO BRUNO Of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, then residing in Miami, Florida,

was in the process of selling all his holdings in Philadelphia and allegedly is

getting ready to move in on the gambling in cuba.

The same source also stated, according to Lieutenant HUNT, that the

Apalachin meeting had been called for the purpose of each member contributing

$10,000 to a fund which was to be used in backing FIDEL CASTRO (Cuban Rebel

Leader) in his attempt to take över the control of Cuba. In return for this

support, they would obtain the concession forgambling in Cuba.

In addition

some of the money was allegedly to be used in Caracas, Venezuela, to set up

gambling establishments. Lieutenant HUNT pointed out further that Attorney

about a year ago and was alleged to have .

gone there to see

about obtaining

concessions for gambling:

Confidential. Informant I-36, previously mentioned, informed on

April 21, 1958, that ANIHONY F. GUARNIERI, hoodlum who attended instant meeting,

during. conversations has told him that captioned meeting included as one of

the matters discussed "Havana

gambling" since LOUIS SANTOS from Cuba was there

for only a short time and was in BARBARA'S home talking to the "big men."

inforant said that he did not get any information on the "big men"

GUARNIERI said he did not know who was. in there and there were so many around

the place that everybody was moving around in and out of the house and he did

not know whoSANTOS was actually talking to at the time he was there.

6. Ot'er Gambling

I...36 also said that on another occasion when he talked to GUARNIERI,

GUARNIERI told him that the money men in the group at Apalachin had been

connected with gambling (horse rooms, bookmaking, dice games, etc.) where they

have put their money into small operations of other individuals and built up the

operations with their connections. He said they would take a small "bookie"

give him financial backing and ther "throw their business" to him from

other sections of the country. He saia GUARNIERI toid him that if the small

bookie did not cooperate, then the money men would cut out his facilities' for

getting results and blacklist him with the group, or, according to GUARNERI,.

if they were in a gambling room operation and did not cooperate with the money

men when the money men became interested in them, they would make it miserable

for the gambling room operation so that it would be forced out of business by

frequent arrests or lack of business.

The informant commented that GUARNIERI has been a lottery ticket

operator in the past but has not been in this racket since 1948 and that

GUARNIERI is a small-time gambler and could not do any big-time gambling because

he does not have anything.

The informant said he has been trying to make a

living at the dress manufacturing business but has not been too successful at

= 148 -

NW 68262 Docld:32332691 Page 18

## Page 19

AL 62-1152

that operation either. (The informant meant GUARNIERI had been trying to make

a living at the dress manufacturing business.)

In connection with the lottery, attention is directed to the

interview of AMEDEO BERSANI of Syracuse, New York, previously set out in this

report: BERSANI advised the agent that

he thought the Apalachin meeting had

been held in regard to lotteries.

BERSANI also stated that VITO GENOVESE, who

was in attendance, was the outstanding lottery organizer and operator in the

United States today and the Apalachin group needed him because of his know-how.

and ability to make connections, although he is not a Sicilian.

By airtel February 26, 1958, Dallas advised the Bureau that

Confidential Infornant T-59 had informed that he has known the CIVELLO family

all of his life and went to school with CHARIES CIVELIO, brother of JOSEPH

FRANCIS CIVELLO, who attended instant meeting.

The informant said that he was

aware of the "setup" in regard to

JOSEPH CIVELLO'S visit to Apalachin,

New York. He saia that CIVELLO was invited

to attend but was reluctant to furnish details of the invitation.

The informant indicated that "they" wanted to know from CIVELLO

the present political setup in the Dallas-Fort Worth area and whether Dallas

would be good for certain organized activity at this time such as gambling

devices, headquarters for a narcotics route to the east or other interests..

CIVELLO stated, according to informant, that Dallas had never had

an organized syndicate and never would have one.

According to the informant,

CIVEL' further pointed out to the group that there weresmall-time gaublers

and other hoodlums on individual bases who had operated in the past but they

never had any national connection. By letter dated May 5, 1958, Dallas advised

that this informant has been unable to furrish any further information

concerning this matter.

On May 12, 1958, Confidential Informant I-60 advised SA PATRICK A.

MUNLEY that he was in Buffalo, New York, when the Apalachin meeting took place

on November 14; 1957, and when the information appeared in the newspapers, all

the hoodlums in Buffalo discussed it to some extent at the various bars there.

The informant said that from all the conversation he heard, no one had

information concerning the reason for the meeting.

The presumption by all was

that it had to do with the rackets, gambling, narcotics and illegal alcohol.

The informant mentioned

that another group of people who knew the individuals

in the Buffalo area

who

had attended the meeting was

surprised that these

individuals were associated with the group

at Apalachin because the Buffalo

indiviauals had such good reputations and were in legitinate businesses at Buffalo

and vicinity.

He said one of the individuals was closing his bar and restaurant

because of the publicity of the Apälachin meeting. The informant said he dia

not know the name of this individual but thought it was CARLISI. (ROY CARLISI

of Buffalo is a bar owner.)

8. Raising Funds to Influence Officials

On April 22, 1958, Confidential Informant I-62, considered in the

past a major hoodlum with particular connections with bootlegging and gambling

and now. "legitimate,! advised in connection with captione meeting that ne had

no personal information about why it was held and had not received any

information from anyone who attended it. He said, however,

that it was certain

the purpose of the meeting was financial.

The informant said that this was the

only possible explanation based on his years of experience with hoodlums of this

type.

He said that the only explanation of the wide attendance including

people from the West Coast, Texas, etc. was that-the meeting had a fund-raising

purpose or, in the informant's words, that they vere "settin together a

jackpot". to Influence legisiation of for investments.

It is noted that SANTO TRAFFICANTE, JR. was at the meeting and it would

appear logical that a prime investment considered was the Havana gambling

enterprise mentioned previously in instant report.

In this connection, Confidential Informant I-63 advised SA EDMUND I.

HART

ROSENCRANZ, "front"

Apalachin meeting had caused a lot of trouble. ROSENCRANZ. allegedly said he

understood that the purpose of the meeting was (1) to discuss the murder of

ALBERT ANASTASIA and (2) to see if the group could get together with certain

law enforcement officials and make a deal whereby they would stop the importation

of narcotics from Europe and in return would be allowed to run gambling

enterprises in their various locations without hindrance from law enforcement

officials.

9. ALBERT ANASTASIA Operations

As previously set forth in the report of Sa ARTHUR V. HART dated

March 5, 1958, at Albany, a number of sources has advised that the Apalachin

meeting was called for the purpose of discussing what

was to be done about

ALBERT ANASTASIA'S operations.

By airtel May 6, 1958, New York acvised that a review reflected that

ALBERT ANASTASIA had the following alleged interests:

1. Data in respect to ANASTASIA'S apparent attempt to obtain the

gambling concession at the Havana Hilton Hotel in Cuba have previously been

set. forth.

2. ANASTASIA was a powerful boss of the New Jersey-New York

waterfront, according to the New York City Anti-Crime Committee.

ANASTASIA

had strong control over the East River piers and the Brooklyn piers with control

of shylocking, numbers, bookmaking and narcotics on these piers.

at the meeting were interested in.

The informant said that he was not personally acquainted with JOSEPH

FRANCIS CIVELLO of Dallas, Texas, who attended the meeting, but was acqueinted

with I-67 frot Dallas who he thought would be acquainted with CIVELLO and

would certainly be in a position to know individuals in dailas who would know

CIVELLO and who could, in his opinion, obtain from CIVELLO the reason he

attended the Apalachin neeting.

Confidential Informant I-36 advised on May 9, 1958, that he had had

one coltact with ANTHONY F. GUARNIERI since last interviewed.

He said he asked

GUARND RI what was going on at the meeting and GUARNIERI told him that the

can trad that trot the cont

"money men" were "figuring things out." The informant said that GUARNIERI

had given him similar infornation in the past. He said that GUARNIERI then

explained that fron the conference of the "moncy men" some one or two of the

group are told that they are going to be set up in some business someplace

where it is thought that the business involved would be a good business. The

informant asserted that GUARNIERI said it might be a legitimate business or a

horse room, lottery or other specialty like that.

The informant said he asked

GUARNIERI if anything was decided on the day of the meeting and GUARNIERI tola

him that he did not know but thought it broke up too fast for any decision to

be made.

Confidential Informant I-28 advised SA PATRICK A. MUNLEY and SA

JAMES C. MEE on May 1, 1758, that SALVATORE ALECCIA, friend of ANTHONY F.

GUARNIERI, who attended instant meeting, told him on the night of April 29, 1958,.

that the meeting was for the purpose of introducing the younger men to the older

in the group and for dividing and assigning territory. The informant saia

that he. could not get any other information.

1?. Illegal Alcohol

•It is noted that a major portion of the hoodlums in attendance at

captioned meeting heve prohibition violations and bootlegging experience in

their bockgrounds.

It appears logical that they are currently involved in some

instances in illicit alcohol operations.

Confidential Informant' T-63; previously mentioned, for example has

advised that SAM ROSENCRANZ, FRANK CUCCHIARA'S "Iront: man, told him on

January 10, 1953, that he haû an illicit still apparently operating in Rhode

Island and, without specifically stating, indicated that FRANK CUCCHIARA was

financial backer in this still.

By letter dated February 6, 1958, the Buffalo Office advised that

JOHN FOY, NA, New York State Safety Connission, who conducted an investigation

relating to the Apalachin meeting for Governor AVERELL HARRIMAN Of New York,

told. SAC WESLEY G. GRAPP that his investigation indicated a principal reason

for the meeting was arrangements for obtaining sugar to manufacture illegal

'alcohol without it being traced. FOY was reinterviewed by Buffalo and on

- 155 -

NW 68262 Docld:32332691 Page 21

## Page 22

AL 62-1152

Inforwant said, he. heard NICK ALAIMO (DOMINICK ALAIMO who attended instant

meeting) and SAMMY DI BELIA, associates of RUSSELL BUFALINO (who attended

instant meeting) discussing the puryose of the meeting and they in their

conversations said that this was the purpose of the meeting.

The informant related that the only one who told him directly the

purpose of the meeting was LEONARD BLANDINA but added that on three other

occasions he overheard conversations indicating this was the purpose of the

meeting.

He said BLANDINA did not institute or commence these conversations

but they were conversations by ALAIMO and DI BELLA.

The informant said the instant meeting was to include jobbers,

manufacturers, truckers and others who would have only a financial interest

and the meeting was for the purpose of deciding what proportion or what interest

or what phase of the operation each would have when they took conürol of the

industry. The informant said they intended eventually to put pressure on

buyers to force them to buy garments from their group.

The informant stated that SCIANDRA and his associates in the Pittston

area intended to completely dominate the area from Binghamton, New York, to

Buffalo, New York, as they had assurance that they would have

garment trucking

rates. from that area to New York City guaranteed to them. It was their

intention

to use the plant of SCIANDRA for cutting and distribution and any gardent..

manufacturer in Northern New York would be forced to operate through SCIANDRA'S

plan, according to informant.

15. Control of Vending Machine Business

As previously set out in the report of SA ARTHUR V. HARI dated

March 5, 1958, at Albany, page 21, Confidential Informant I-22 advised that

THOMAS ALOYSIUS MARINO, was., a New York top hoodlum, said that the

palachin. meeting was for the purpose. of orcanizing the vendine machine business

throughout the United States.

The informant said he got the impression from

MARINO that this would include slot machines as well as jule boxes and cigarette

machines. MARINO mentioned, that he and JOHNNY ROBILOTTO controlled this

organizational drive in Brooklyn, New York.

MEETING BROKEN UP BEFORE COMPLETION OF AGENDA

As previously set förth in Albany airtel to Bureau May 12, 1958,

the New York State Police surveillance of instant meeting was set up on the

early afternoon of November 14, 1957, and was detected by persons at BARBARA'S

residence shortly thereafter. As has previously been reported in several

instances, persons fled through the woods to escape the roundup and were located

by the police. It is indicated that the meeting was rather rudely and abruptly

terminated when the police activity was detected and it would thus appear that

the meeting had not gone to its contemplated conclusion.
