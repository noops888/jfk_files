Address Rt. 1, Box 283 Place Residence

Basile, La.
Interview:

Investigator Robert Buras met with Mr. Fruge at the
above time.and date. Mr. Fruge stated that he is self-employed
now but he was a lieutenant with the Louisiana State Police from
1947 to 1967. He retired with twenty years' service.

"In 1963 he handled Rose Cheramie in Eunice, La. asa
possible mental patient; then as an informant he: worked with
her and the U.S. Customs from Houston, Texas. This occurred
from 11/20/63 through 11/27/63.

From 1965 through 1967, he assisted New Orleans
District Attorney Jim Garrison's investigator, Andy Sciambra,
in the Clinton-Jackson area of Louisiana.

From 1965 through 1967, he was assigned to the Louisiana
Sovereignty (State) Commission. in Baton Rouge, La.

On Wednesday, November 20, 1963, at approximately
10:00 P.m., Mr. Fruge was called to the emergency ward of the
Moosa Memorial Hospital in Eunice, La. by Mrs. Louise Guillory.

A patient, Rose Cheramie, was in the ward because she
had been struck by an auto on Highway 190 in front of the

Silver Slipper Lounge. She had only minor abrasions when she

was brought into the hospital by the man that hit her, a
Mr. Frank Odom. Mr. Odom was known to Mr. Fruge and is a
long-time resident of the area. Mrs. Guillory called Lt.
Fruge because she thought that the patient was on drugs. She
could not be released due to her condition, so Lt. Fruge brought
her to the local jail and locked her up for safekeeping until
she sobered up. Rose Cheramie had been hitchhiking when she
was struck by Mr. Odom. A short while later, Lt. Fruge was
called to the local jail because Rose Cheramie had stripped
off all of her clothes and was “cutting up" in the cell. He
called a Lafayette Charity Hospital ambulance and accompanied
the driver as he transported Cheramie to the East Louisiana
State Hospital for examination. He took this action on the
advice of Dr. Rodney Derouin, who met him at the jail and
sedated Cheramie.

The trip took about two hours and during this time
Cheramie was calm and asked the usual questions about why
she was being held and where she was being taken. During this
trip, she was in a straightjacket. Mr. Fruge: stated that this
procedure was used on any person that showed signs of drug
withdrawal to the extent that they needed medical attention.
The people would be treated until their withdrawal symptoms

stopped and were then released.

7 Francis Louis Fruge Interview...page 3

During the trip from Eunice to Jackson, Rose Cheramie
stated that she was just passing through town from Miami and
on her way to Dallas and Houston. She stated: "We're going
to kill President Kennedy when he comes to Dallas in a few days."
She talked about traveling with a couple of guys, but Lt. Fruge
did not take any of the conversation as serious due to her
condition. He admitted her to Jackson at about 3:00 a.m.
Thursday, November 21, 1963. She was still calm but she was put
into a patient sack for her own protection.

On Friday, November 22, 1963, Lt. Fruge was at his home
when he heard that the President had been shot in Dallas. He
called the Hospital and found out that Cheramie was kicking up again
to the extent that he didn't think a trip or talk to her would be
fruitful. He asked the doctors at the Hospital to call him
when she calmed down. On Monday, November 25, he found out that
she was calmed down and he went to Jackson to talk with her.

She stated that she was coniing from Miami with two men that

were either Cubans or Italians and she was going to go to

Dallas, then to Houston. The men were going to kill Kennedy

and she was going to check into the Rice Hotel, where reservations
were already made for her,.and pick up 10 kilos of heroin from

a seaman coming into Galveston. She was to pick up the money

for the dope from a man who was holding her baby. She would

then take the dope to Mexico. Mr. Fruge could not remember the

name of the seaman that she gave, or the ship's name, or the

NW 68261 Docld:32261445 Page 5


Francis Louis Fruge Interview...page 4

name name that she used as an alias at the Hotel. He stated
that the U.S. Customs would have this information if anyone
checks with them.

Lt. Fruge told Col. Morgan of the State Police and he
told Col. Burbank. Col. Burbank was in charge of the State
Police at the time Burbank told them to check out the story.
Morgan and Fruge called Nathan Durham, Chief Customs Agent in
Port Arthur, Texas and gave him the name of the seaman and the
ship that Cheramie said the dope was coming in on. Durham
called back in about 30 minutes and confirmed that a ship was
coming into Galveston by that name and the seaman's name was on
the ship's roster. Col. Morgan called Will Fritz of the Dallas
Police Department and told him the story about the assassination
and the heroin,.which had partly checked out. Fritz told
Morgan that it was inthe hands of the Federal Agents and gave
Morgan a name to call. Morgan called the agent and was told
that they weren't interested at that time. They made plans to
meet with Nathan Durham in Houston to work the heroin. Rose
Cheramie, Fruge, Morgan and a State Police Pilot took the LASP
plane and flew to Houston on Tuesday. They worked with the
Customs people and attempted to get the dope. The Customs
people checked the Rice Hotel and reservations were made just
as Cheramie had said. The man that allegedly had the money and
her baby was checked and his name showed that he was an

underworld, suspected narcotics dealer.

NW 68261 Docld:32261445 Page 6


Francis Louis Fruge Interview...page 5

While flying to Texas in the plane, one of the men
had a daily newspaper and it had a headline or story title
that stated that Oswald and Ruby were not connected. Rose
Cheramie saw the headline and laughed. She told the men in
the plane that Oswald and Ruby were "bed partners" when she
worked for Ruby as a stripper. She stated that she worked for
Ruby, but Fruge does not remember the name of the bar that she
said she stripped at. It wasn't the Carousel. It had a name
with something like the Pink Door or Red Door. Fruge thinks
that this might have been checked later, but they didn't do any-
thing with it at that time.

When Cheramie was first picked up on the highway in
Eunice, La., she had two cardboard boxes of clothes and
belongings. Fruge looked in one of the two boxes and found
baby clothes and shoes. This led him to believe that she
at least had a baby, but he didn't check the boxes any further.
An Agent named Bob Woody checked into the Rice Hotel with
Cheramie and acted as her sugar daddy. An Agent was assigned
to follow the seaman. The seaman got onto a bus from Galveston
to Houston, but he lost the tail. No one contacted the room
at the Hotel and Rose Cheramie missed her time schedule. The
whole deal fell through onthe dope. The Agent in charge of
Customs in Houston called the Agents, probably F.B.I., and asked
them if they wanted to talk to Cheramie. They didn't want to
speak with her so Fruge, Morgan and the pilot came back to
Baton Rouge. They cut Rose Cheramie loose in Houston. . Mr.

Fruge forgot about the incident.
NW 68261 Docld:32261445 Page 7


. Francis Louis Fruge Interview...page 6

In 1965 or '66, an investigator for Jim Garrison called
and asked about the above information. Lt. Fruge was loaned to
the Garrison investigation by the State Police. Lt. Fruge
stated that a Dr. Person had somehow heard about the Cheramie
case and had called Garrison. Fruge then helped with some of
the interviews in Jackson and Clinton, La. He got a set of
photos from the Garrison investigation and went to the man who
managed the Silver Slipper Lounge, Mack Manuel. Mack Manuel
remembered the incident and stated that he had seen Rose Cheramie
talk to three men. Two men were with her and a third came in
later and talked to the others. Mack Manuel went through the
mug shots and other photos and picked out the two men that
were with Rose Cheramie the night that she was there. One
was Sergio Arcacha Smith and the other was a name like Assanto,
unknown if last or first name. The man who came in and talked
to them was identified by Manuel as John Paul Jennette. This
man, Jennette, might have talked to Assanto previously because
he died of a heart attack in Eunice, La. on February 18, 1978.
He was born in Worcester, Massachusetts on April 17, 1927.

His social security number was 026-20-6157. This man, Jennette,
might have known Assanto. Mack Manuel stated to Fruge that
Assanto (or a name like that) used to bring girls to the Silver
Slipper from Miami. The girls would work for a couple of weeks
and then go back. The name of the man should be in some reports
of Garrison's investigator. Mack Manuel was shot to death

in 1974-75 in Villeplatte, La.

NW 68261 Docld:32261445 Page 8


“Fyancis Louis Fruge Interview...page 7

Fruge was asked in 1966 to attempt to find Rose Cheramie.
He learned that she was born in Houston, Texas and she died in a
small town in Texas in 1965. She was the victim of an auto hitting
her while she was either walking or hitchhiking on a highway.

Fruge found that the cause of death was listed as a fractured
skull and Jim Garrison wanted the body exhumed. Mr. Fruge stated
that the local authorities would not exhume the body and were
generally unfriendly. Mr. Fruge stated that he found it unusual
that a person would be hit by an auto and only have a fracture of
the skull without breaking any other bones in the body.

Mr. Fruge stated that he could not find any other records
of the driver that hit and killed Rose Cheramie except in the Police
Report and at the State Vehicle Office of Registration. He
checked the address given and no one at that address had ever
heard of the man. He states that someone might have found him
later but he (Fruge) doesn't remember hearing about it.

Mr. Fruge touched on a few other points that he remembered.
There was a Dr. Silva, who was born in Havana, Cuba, working at
the East Louisiana State Hospital in 1963. That is the only
year that he worked there and Mr. Fruge does not have information
nor does he imply that the doctor was involved in anything illegal. -
Mr. Fruge only mentions him because he was from Cuba.

Mr. Fruge asked if this Committee had found that diagrams
of the sewer system in Dealey Plaza were found in Arcacha Smith's
apartment in Texas. He thinks that Captain Will Fritz might have
mentioned something about that, but Mr. Fruge was not sure on this
point.

NW 68261 Docld:32261445 Page 9


Francis Louis Fruge Interview...page 8

Mr. Fruge stated that he had a letter in his possession
from Margarette Martens, the mother of Layton Martens, to a Father
Toups. The letter (a xerox copy) stated that Mrs. Martens heard
talk about killing President Kennedy among Ferrie, Shaw, and
Banister in 1963, but she denied that her son, Layton Martens, was
involved in the talk. This letter was written, to the best of
his memory, after Garrison called her son before the Grand Jury
in New Orleans. Mrs. Martens was dating David Ferrie -- or at
least was friendly with him. Mr. Fruge remembers checking on Mrs.
Martens and learning that Mr. Guy Banister had her committed to
Charity Hospital, New Orleans, then to Mandeville, Louisiana on
August 16, 1963. She was committed to Charity Hospital, New
Orleans again on November 30, 1966 by David Ferrie and Layton
Martens. Mr. Fruge and Andy Sciambra talked with her doctor,
whose name he doesn't. remember. The doctor, a psychiatrist,
stated that Mrs. Martens was not insame. He didn't talk with
Mrs. Martens. These dates might or might not be significant, but
he mentions that in August 1963 Oswald was in New Orleans handing
out leaflets and this would be the time that she claims to have
heard the talk of killing the President. The 1966 date would be
about the time that talk was going around New Orleans thatthe
District Attorney was going to call people before the Grand Jury.

Father Toups is now deceased.

NW 68261 Docld:32261445 Page 10


Francis Louis Fruge Interview...page 9

Another point of interest to Mr. Fruge was a statement
by one Andy Dunn of Clinton, Louisiana. Mr. Dunn was sitting
across the street from the black vehicle that was parked by the
voter registration office. He remembered seeing three men in the
car -- two in front and one in the rear -- at the time that
Oswald was in line to register. That would mean that there is one
man that was inthe car that has not been identified to this day.
Mr. Dunn, who was a local drunk, died in jail in Clinton a short
time later. Mr. Fruge does not have the report, but he remembers
the story that Mr. Dunn died by hanging himself while lying on his
bunk. He had a belt around his neck and around the head of the
bunk and he strangled while he was lying there. This has not been
verified to his knowledge.

Mr. Henry Sybly of Denin Springs or Hammond, Louisiana
was the chairman of the State Sovereignty Commission. Mr. Fruge
doesn't remember anything about Mr. Guy Banister's files ever
being brought there. It is possible that files were there that
he did not know about. Mr. Fruge stated that he never worked with
retired Major Russell Willie of the Louisiana State Police while

he was with the Commission.
