Interview:

Investigator Robert Buras met with Mr. Fruge at the

above time and date. Mr.. Fruge stated that he is self-employed

now but he was

a lieutenant with the Louisiana State Police from

1947 to 1967. He retired with twenty years' service.

In 1963 he handled Rose Cheramie in Eunice, La. as a

possible mental patient; then as an informant he worked with

her and the U.S. Customs from Houston, Texas. This occurred

from 11/20/63 through 11/27/63.

From 1965 through 1967, he assisted New Orleans

District Attorney Jim Garrison's investigator, Andy Sciambra,

in the Clinton-Jackson area of Louisiana.

From 1965 through 1967, he was assigned to the Louisiana

Sovereignty (State) Commission in Baton Rouge, La.

On Wednesday, November 20, 1963, at approximately

10:00 p.M.. Mr. Fruge was called to the emergency ward of the

Moosa Memorial Hospital in Eunice, La. by Mrs. Louise Guillory.

A patient, Rose Cheramie, was in the ward because she

had been struck by an auto on Highway 190 in front of the

Silver Slipper Lounge. She had only minor abrasions when she

was brought into the hospital by the man that hit her, a

Mr. Frank Odom. Mr. Odom was known to Mr. Fruge and is a

long-time resident of the area. Mrs. Guillory called Lt.

Fruge because she thought that the patient was on drugs. She

could not be released due to her condition, so Lt. Fruge brought

her to the local jail and locked her up for safekeeping until

she sobered up. Rose Cheramie had been hitchhiking when she

was struck by Mr. Odom. A short while later, Lt. Fruge was

called to the local jail because Rose Cheramie had stripped

off all of her clothes and was "cutting up" in the cell. He

called a Lafayette Charity Hospital ambulance and accompanied

the driver as he transported Cheramie to the East Louisiana

State Hospital for examination. He took this action on the

advice of DI. Rodney Derouin, who met him at the jail and

sedated Cheramie.

The trip took about

two hours and during this time

Cheramie was calm and asked the usual questions about why

she was being held and where she was being taken. During this

trip, she was in a straightjacket.

Mr. Fruge stated that this

procedure was used on any person that showed signs of drug

withdrawal to the extent that they needed medical attention.

The people would be treated until their withdrawal symptoms

stopped and were then released.

Francis Louis Fruge Interview...page 3

During the trip from Eunice to Jackson, Rose Cheramie

stated that she was just passing through town from Miami and

on her way to Dallas and Houston. She stated: "We're going

to kill President Kennedy when he comes to Dallas in a few days."

She talked about traveling with a couple of guys, but It. Fruge

did not take any of the conversation as serious due to her

condition. He admitted her to Jackson at about 3:00 a.m.

Thursday, November 21, 1963. She was still calm but she was put

into

a patient sack for her own protection.

On Friday, November 22, 1963, It. Fruge was at his home

when he heard that the President had been shot in Dallas. He

called the Hospital and found out that Cheramie was kicking up again

to the extent that he didn't think a trip or talk to her would be

fruitful. He asked the doctors at the Hospital to call him

when she calmed down. On Monday, November 25, he found out that

she was calmed down and he went to Jackson to talk with her.

She stated that she was coming from Miami with two men that

were either Cubans or Italians and she was going to go to

Dallas, then to Houston. The men were going to kill Kennedy

and she was going to check into the Rice Hotel, where reservations

were already made for her, and pick up 10 kilos of heroin from

a seaman coming into Galveston. She was to pick up the money

for the dope from a man who was holding her baby. She would

then take the dope to Mexico. Mr. Fruge could not remember the

name of the seaman that she gave, or the ship's name, or the

NW 68261 Docld:32261445 Page 5

## Page 6

Francis Louis Fruge Interview... page 4

name name that she used as an alias at the Hotel. He stated

that the U.S. Customs would have this information if anyone

checks with them.

It. Fruge told Col. Morgan of the State Police and he

told Col. Burbank. Col. Burbank was in charge of the State

Police at the time Burbank told them to check out the story.

Morgan and Fruge called Nathan Durham, Chief Customs Agent in

Port Arthur, Texas and gave him the name of the seaman and the

ship that Cheramie said the dope was coming in on. Durham

called back in about 30 minutes and confirmed that a ship was

coming into Galveston by that name and the seaman's name was on

the ship's roster. Col. Morgan called Will Fritz of the Dallas

Police Department and told him the story about the assassination

and the heroin, which had partly checked out.. Fritz told

Morgan that it was inthe hands of the Federal Agents and gave

Morgan a name to call. Morgan called the agent and was told

that they weren't interested at that time. They made plans to

meet with Nathan Durham in Houston to work the heroin. Rose

Cheramie, Fruge, Morgan and a State Police Pilot took the LASP

plane and flew to Houston on Tuesday. They worked with the

Customs people and attempted to get the dope. The Customs

people checked the Rice Hotel and reservations were made just

as Cheramie had said. The man that allegedly had the money and

her baby was checked and his name showed that he was an

underworld, suspected narcotics dealer.

Francis Louis Fruge Interview...page 5

While flying to Texas in the plane, one of the men

had a daily newspaper and it had a headline or story title

that stated that Oswald and Ruby were not connected. Rose

Cheramie saw the headline and laughed. She told the men in

the plane that Oswald and Ruby were "bed partners" when she

worked for Ruby as a stripper. She stated that she worked for

Ruby, but Fruge does not remember the name of the bar that she

said she stripped at. It wasn't the Carousel. It had a name

with something like the Pink Door or Red DOOr. Fruge thinks

that this might have been checked later, but they didn't do any-

thing with it at that time.

When Cheramie was first picked up on the highway in

Eunice, La., she had two cardboard boxes of clothes and

belongings. Fruge looked in one of the two boxes and found

baby clothes and shoes. This led him to believe that she

at least had a baby, but he didn't check the boxes any further.

An Agent named Bob Woody checked into the Rice Hotel with

Cheramie and acted as her sugar daddy. An Agent was assigned

to follow the seaman. The seaman got onto a bus from Galveston

to Houston, but he lost the tail. No one contacted the room

at the Hotel and Rose Cheramie missed her time schedule. The

whole deal fell through on the dope. The Agent in charge of

Customs in Houston called the Agents, probably F.B.I., and asked

them if they wanted to talk to Cheramie. They didn't want to

speak with her so Fruge, Morgan and the pilot came back to

Baton Rouge. They cut Rose Cheramie loose in Houston. Mr.

Fruge forgot about the incident.

## Page 8

Francis Louis Fruge Interview... page 6

In 1965 or '66, an investigator for Jim Garrison called

and asked about the above information. Lt. Fruge was loaned to

the Garrison investigation by the State Police.

Lt. Fruge

stated that a Dr. Person had somehow heard about the Cheramie

case and had called Garrison. Fruge then helped with some of

the interviews in Jackson and Clinton, La. He got a set of

photos from the Garrison investigation and went to the man who

managed the Silver Slipper Lounge, Mack Manuel. Mack Manuel

remembered the incident and stated that he had seen Rose Cheramie

talk to three men. Two men were with her and a third came in

later and talked to the others. Mack Manuel went through the

mug shots and other photos and picked out the two men that

were with Rose Cheramie the night that she was there. One

was Sergio Arcacha Smith and the other was a name like Assanto,

unknown if last or first name. The man who came in and talked

to them was identified by Manuel as John Paul Jennette. This

man, Jennette, might have talked to Assanto previously because

he died of a heart attack in Eunice, La. on February 18, 1978.

He was born in Worcester, Massachusetts on April 17, 1927.

His social security number was 026-20-6157. This man, Jennette,

might have known Assanto. Mack Manuel stated to Fruge that

Assanto (or a name like that) used to bring girls to the Silver

Slipper from Miami. The girls would work for a couple of weeks

and then go back. The name of the man should be in some reports

of Garrison's investigator. Mack Manuel was shot to death

in 1974-75 in Villeplatte, La.

NW 68261 Docld:32261445 Page 8

## Page 9

Francis Louis Fruge Interview.. page 7

Fruge was asked in 1966 to attempt to find Rose Cheramie.

He learned that she was born in Houston, Texas and she died in a

small town in Texas in 1965. She was the victim of an auto hitting

her while she was either walking or hitchhiking on a highway.

Fruge found that the cause of death was listed as a fractured

skull and Jim Garrison wanted the body exhumed. Mr. Fruge stated

that the local authorities would not exhume the body and were

generally unfriendly. Mr. Fruge stated that he found it unusual

that a person would be hit by an auto and only have a fracture of

the skull without breaking any other bones in the body.

Mr. Fruge stated that he could not find any other records

of the driver that hit and killed Rose Cheramie except in the Police

Report and at the State Vehicle Office of Registration. He

checked the address given and no one at that address had ever

heard of the man. He states that someone might have found him

later but he (Fruge) doesn't remember hearing about it.

Mr. Fruge touched on a few other points that he remembered.

There was a Dr. Silva, who was born in Havana, Cuba, working at

the East Louisiana State Hospital in 1963. That is the only

year that he worked there and Mr. Fruge does not have information

nor does he imply that the doctor was involved in anything illegal.

Mr. Fruge only mentions him because he was from Cuba.

Mr. Fruge asked if this Committee had found that diagrams

of the sewer system in Dealey Plaza were found in Arcacha Smith's

apartment in Texas.

He thinks that Captain Will Fritz might have

mentioned something about that, but Mr. Fruge was not sure on this

point.

NW 68261 Docld:32261445 Page 9

## Page 10

Francis Louis Fruge Interview...page 8

Mr. Fruge stated that he had a letter in his possession

from Margarette Martens, the mother of Layton Martens, to a Father

Toups. The letter (a xerox copy) stated that Mrs. Martens heard

talk about killing President Kennedy among Ferrie, Shaw, and

Banister in 1963, but she denied that her son, Layton Martens, was

involved in the talk. This letter was written, to the best of

his memory, after Garrison called her son before the Grand Jury

in New Orleans. Mrs. Martens was dating David Ferrie -- or at

least was friendly with him. Mr. Fruge remembers checking on Mrs.

Martens and learning that Mr. Guy Banister had her committed to

Charity Hospital, New Orleans, then to Mandeville, Louisiana on

August 16, 1963. She was committed to Charity Hospital, New

Orleans again on November 30, 1966 by David Ferrie and Layton

Martens. Mr. Fruge and Andy Sciambra talked with her doctor,

whose name he doesn't remember. The doctor, a psychiatrist,

stated that Mrs. Martens was not insane. He didn't talk with

Mrs. Martens. These dates might or might not be significant, but

he mentions that in August 1963 Oswald was in New Orleans handing

out leaflets and this would be the time that she claims to have

heard the talk of killing the President. The 1966 date would be

about the time that talk was going around New Orleans that the

District Attorney was going to call people before the Grand Jury.

Father Toups is now deceased.

NW 68261 Docld:32261445 Page 10

## Page 11

Francis Louis Fruge Interview. ..page 9

Another point of interest to Mr. Fruge was a statement

by one Andy Dunn of Clinton, Louisiana. Mr. Dunn was sitting

across the street from the black vehicle that was parked by the

voter registration office. He remembered seeing three men in the

car -- two in front and one in the rear -- at the time that

Oswald was in line to register. That would mean that there is one

man that was in the car that has not been identified to this day.

Mr. Dunn, who was a local drunk, died in jail in Clinton a short

time later. Mr. Fruge does not have the report, but he remembers

the story that Mr. Dunn died by hanging himself while lying on his

bunk. He had a belt around his neck and around the head of the

bunk and he strangled while he was lying there. This has not been

verified to his knowledge.

Mr. Henry Sybly of Denin Springs or Hammond, Louisiana

was the chairman of the State Sovereignty Commission. Mr. Fruge

doesn't remember anything about Mr. Guy Banister's files ever

being brought there. It is possible that files were there that

he did not know about. Mr. Fruge stated that he never worked with

retired Major Russell Willie of the Louisiana State Police while

he was with the Commission.
