INITIAL REPORT

SYNOPSIS:

Investigation requested by Comdr, Eglin AFB, FL on 7 Jul 69, to determine circun-
stances surrounding importation of 3 boxes of captured enemy weapons by SUBJECT.
Two boxes containing a total of 21 weapons, 5 noise suppressors, and related equip-
ment seized, Both boxes marked for SUBJECT. Munitions officials advised boxes
were stored at request of SUBJECT. Deputy Comdr, AFATL, advised his agency was
queried by ARPA, a DOD agency, about a box of weapons being sent through ARPA

channels. Investigation disclosed SUBJECT sent 12 weapons to Eglin AFB from SEA
while TDY in RVN in Nov 68. Eleven of these weapons were subsequently shipped from
Eglin AFB to Sionics, Atlanta, at SUBJECT's request and at government expense. The
twelfth weapon recovered at Eglin AFB. Deputy Comdr, AFATL, advised SUBJECT had no
known authority to send weapons from SEA nor to ship weapons to Sionics; Sionics
does not have AF contract. Records reflect SUBJECT, since Nov 68, has placed 7
long distance telephone calls to Sionics, at government expense. In verbal state-
mont, SUBJECT advised he shipped one box containing 12 captured enemy weapons from
SEA in approximately Nov 68 as part of his assigned duties to assist Vice-President
of Sionics; that 11 of the weapons were subsequently forwarded to Sionics in Mar
69, because he considered Sionics an AF contractor. He advised that official
telephone calls were placed for same reason. SUBJECT stated he acted as an agent
for the USAF in all instances. He declined to execute a written statement at this
time. SUBJECT's former supervisor in SEA advised that he did not authorize or di-
rect the shipment of any captured enemy weapons to Sionics, Matter coordinated
as U. S. Treasury agents who opined that SUBJECT was in violation of Public Law
90-618.

HOBAUGH attempted to contact SUBJECT, but ‘was unable to do so as
SUBJECT was. on. leave; however, he left a’message for SUBJECT to

12.- On 15 July 1969, CLARENCE M. COOLEY, GS-9, SSAN: 505-32-
7744, Logistics Officer, AFATL (ATDA-Log), was interviewed -at
Eglin AFB, Florida,.and advised as follows:. On 13 March 1969,

‘Sgt ARNOLD of -his office advised him that there were two boxes
of small arms and ammunition in. the logistics storage facility
for SUBJECT. COOLEY stated that he advised SUBJECT that. the
arms ‘and ammunition: could not be: shipped without authorization:
SUBJECT therefore requested by letter dated. 13 March 1969 that
the arms and ammunition be shipped as miscellaneous equipment
to Sionics, 1655 Peachtree Street, Atlanta, Georgia 30309, Attn:
Mr. FRED. BROWN. . COOLEY therefore. made the arrangements for the
shipment. and the DD Form. 1149, Nr FB2823 9073 X100XXX was exe-
cuted. A file containing the following documents was furnished
to the writer by COOLEY:

a. Original letter dated 13 March 1969, signed by SUBJECT,
requesting.Mr. COOLEY to ship two bokes of miscellaneous equip-
ment. to Sionics.

b.. Form letter dated 8 April 1969, to Sionics advising
them of..the shipment of weapons and ammunition to them; this
letter reflects. shipment received on 11 April 1969.

nator FB 5629 8325X002,. 20° Nov 68) reflecting the shipment of a

96307 to ACK 2823 Eglin AFB, FL 32542, marked: Hold for LtCol
’ MARRIOTT,

The above mentioned DD-Form 1149 further, reflects that an attempt
has been made to obliterate one of the serial numbers from the
list of 12 weapons. The effaced serial number appears to be
9473736.

COOLEY advised that the box of weapons was opened on 13. March
1969 in the presence of SUBJECT and Sgt ARNOLD, and that they

Headquarters, RVN, aS a munitions expert, he was ordered by his
OIC, Colonel FAGAN, to assist and sifpport WER BELL, the Vice-
President of Sionics, to the fullest extent possible. Therefore,
when WER BELL asked SUBJECT to send a box of 12 captured weapons
to the U.S., SUBJECT complied by sending the weapons through
official channels to Eglin AFB, Florida, as he (SUBJECT). con-
sidered Sionics, and therefore WER BELL, an official Air Force
contractor. On approximately 13 March 1969, at SUBJECT's request,
11 of the 12 weapons sent to Eglin AFB by him were further sent
to Sionics, after FRED BROWN, President of Sionics, assured
SUBJECT that the weapons had been licensed and registered with the
proper authorities. The shipment was sent to’ Sionics through
official government. transportation. channels, at government . expense.
SUBJECT also admitted placing approximately 7. long distance tele-
phone calls since November 1968 from his office at Eglin AFB,
Florida to Sionics or FRED’ BROWN in Atlanta, Georgia, at govern-
ment expense as he (SUBJECT) stated that Sionics is an Air Force
contractor, SUBJECT. further stated that he had the twelfth
weapon that was sent to Eglin AFB from SEA. in approximately
November 1968 stored in the lock-up. room at Range. 22, Eglin AFB.
SUBJECT also advised that during the approximate period of
February to June 1969, two additional boxes of captured. enemy
weapons were sent to Eglin AFB, Florida (Attn: Lt Col P. A. MARRIOTT)
from Bangkok, Thailand, by (to the best of SUBJECT's knowledge)
WER BELL. SUBJECT then asked the appropriate personnel at Eglin

SUBJECT's: former commander in RVN, was interviewed at his summer
home. ‘in.Destin, Florida. Colonel FAGAN. executed a sworn statement,
pertinent portions of which ‘are ‘set forth as follows:

"On or about 5 Sept 68 I was advised that a Mr. Mitchell. wer Bell
of. Sionics was arriving at Saigon Airport and would bring some
munitions equipment .(guns and. suppressors) for demonstration. *¥***

."Iassigned: Lt Col Marriott the task of handling all facets of Mr

Wer Bell's visit which he did by meeting Mr.Wer Bell at the
Commercial Terminal. and assisted him to get settled in a hotel. Mr
Wer Bell was in RVN.as a private citizen and we were aware that. he
had no. sectrity clearance. ******* "I departed on a Trip to
CONUS at the end.of. Nov 68, and returned to Saigon 13 Dec 68. Mr
‘Wer Bell was still in SEA, but I did not know where. I was aware
a-shipment of guns had gone to. Eglin during. my absence but had
.already arranged through the Commander of FTD W-PAFB that we should
have shipped such items to FTD and.they would. forward them to the
designated base... I did nothing to ‘counter this Nov 68 ‘shipment. as
it‘was going. to the A.F.: Armament Lab for a. "museum". 9 *##*k*

"In early. Feb 69.I found Mr Wer Bell. and we concluded that he would
leave RVN. about .17 Feb 69 and he would give me,his:MACV form 6 and
I.would ship back only what he brought. over. I was very specific
about no enemy weapons’ being involved and if he had such for the Air
Force, that I’ would ship them to FTD as instructed.. After my return
from my second CONUS trip.on 23 Apr 69:I found that Wer Bell did not
depart RVN.'° Ivasked around’ for him and heard many stories of his
activities and felt I should take direct action. I called. the. Ost
