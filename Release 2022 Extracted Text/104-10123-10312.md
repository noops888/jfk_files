MEMORANDUM FOR: Director, Security Office

SUBJECT

: Coumendation of Mr. James O'Connell

1. I would like to take this opportunity to commend

Mr. James O'Connell for the excellent manner in which he served

WE Division on 6 May 1956.

As you know, the son of Mr. James R. Hunt, Jr., Chief

of Station, Aeria, was killed on 5/6 May in Walsenbury, Colorado,

In an automobile accident.

The CIA Cable secretariat was notified

by State and in turn notified Mr. Idwin da Willard, C/WE/3. Mr. Willard

contacted Mr. Hunt's mother on 6 May and offered to be of any assistance

whatsoever.

3. At 2000 hours, 6 May, Mrs. Hunt, Sr. telephoned Nr. Willard

to say

the Funts were arriving in New York at 0710 hours 7 May. She

asked if Mr. Willard could expedite their entry through Customs.

Mr. Willard called the Security Night Duty Officer, who apparently

called Mr. James O'Connell. Within a half hour Mc. O'Connell telephoned

Mr. Willard to say that entry would be expedited and that two Agency

cars would le available for transportation. Mr. O'Connell further

offered any other help possible. Mr. MIlar@ was thus able to call

Mas. Hunt, SI. before 2100 hours, 6 May.

4. This prompt action on the part of Mr. O'Connell has been

brought to the attention of the Director. It is requested that a copy

of this memorandum be placed in Mr. O'Connel's official personnel folder.
