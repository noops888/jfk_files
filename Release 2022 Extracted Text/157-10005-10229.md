run into somebody on the street in Georgetown, a mutual friend,
some weeks before who by coincidence happened to say, oh, I

saw Manny Gunn the other day. He's retired and practicing out

| in Maryland. And that has got to be it because he was not an

intimate of mine. We didn't keep in close touch. So I never
attempted to get in touch with him at the Agency. I simply
looked him up or called information or something like that,
invited him into lunch and said I had a matter I wanted to
discuss with him.

Mr. Liebengood. Did you ever tell anybody or otherwise
make known to anybody at the Agency that you had just had this
contact with Dr. Gunn?

Mr. Hunt. I don't believe so. I think &

have known about it subsequently because he was a close friend,
but--Ivdon't think that I got in touch with Manny: through him.

as retired, too.

Mr. Liebengood. Would you have told geemeeebout this or

would Gunn have told him about it?

Mr. Hunt. If in fact knew about it?

Mr. Liebengood. Yes.

Mr. Hunt. I would have to say it was either Gunn or
Liddy.
Mr. Liebengood. Did you make any arrangements or have any

discussions with Dr. Gunn about maintaining the confidentiality

of your inquiry?

Mr. Hunt. No. |

Mr. Baron. Did you meet Richard Nixon personally at that
time? |

When did you first meet with him?

Mr. Hunt. Met with him, I never met with him. I have
met him on several occasions but I never had a private seance
with him. I met him first at Harvey's restaurant in about

1953, and I next saw him in Montevidea where I interpreted for

him for a while, I was down there and we
were waiting for General Walters to arrive, and I served as
an interpreter. |

I next saw President Nixon at a formal white House recep-
tion. He recalled, or he said he recalled our previous meetings
and I told him I was now working for Chuck Colson, and he said
yes, I know all about that. And that's all in my book, Underco

Mr. Baron. While you were in the Nixon White House you
didn't have a direct line to the President?

Mr. Hunt. I never met the President.

Mr. Baron. Moving back to 1964, there is a note in
Theodore White's book, "Breach of Faith," that. refers to
spying at Barry Goldwater's headquarters, which Howard Hunt
of the CIA had supervised for LBJ in 1964.

Mr. Hunt. That's in my book and in my testimony.

Mr. Baron. Senator Schweiker, who is a member of our

Committee, has expressed an interest in a quote by Frank Sturgis
