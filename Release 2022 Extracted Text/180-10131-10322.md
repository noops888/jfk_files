then provide you, if you desire, with your own copy.

Mr. Murphy. All right.

Mr. Klein. In 1962, Mr. Murphy, Mr. Yuri Nosenko made his |

first contact with the CIA; is that correct?
1s | Mr. Murphy. Yes.
16 | Mr; Klein. And he then defected to the United States in

1964. Would you tell us, beginning in 1962, in general, what

in on the case.

oe

In the fall of 1963, I became Chief of the Soviet Russian

Division and was Chief of the Division when Nosenko defected.

a

Mr. Klein. When Nosenko defected in.1964, when he came
6 | to the United States, was he in the custody of the Central

7 Intelligence Agency at that time?

Mr. Murphy. I don't want to be cute by saying I believe {

time did the control or responsibility over Nosenko change }

from the Soviet Russia Division to another division?

3 Mr. Murphy. My recollection is that it changed in the spri
@ 4 or early summer of 1967 and the responsibility was turned over to

9 Mr. Murphy. I was responsible for the case.
Mr. Klein. Okay. j

Mx. Murphy. Although the case was handled by one of the grdups

within the Division. i

Mr. Klein. But they would report to you?

Mx. Murphy. Yes.

H
19 Mr. Murphy. Until '67, until he died in July of "67, it wag

29 | Desmond Fitzgerald. \
21 Initially the DDP was Dick Helms and then sometime in '65, 3

think it was, I am not sure ‘of the date, '65, he became the

| Operations Directorate, he was still DDP and I reported oeeaian

that chain of command and I reported to the Chief of the

Counterintelligence Staff, Mr. Angleton.

2) Mr. Klein,. You stated that in the beginning you reported to

Richard Helms?

6 Mr. Murphy. He was DDP.

Mr. Murphy. Yes. |

Yi Mr. Klein. Now, in the following years, when different |

‘people held that ‘post of DDP, was Helms still involved in the
\

Nosenko case? |

rey

i Mr. Murphy. He was but I don't recall any specific pattern.
Iz would depend I guess.

H |
| i
16 | Mx. Klein. Can you tell us if you reported to the DDP? ;
i
i

17 Mr. Murphy. Yes.
18 Mr. Klein. What did he do? If you, for example, went to tHe
i

1S | DDP, whoever it might have been, and said we have a decision to

to whome he spoke?

\
i
3:1] Mr. Murphy: I can't give you a specific instance but the |

q
24 i pattern of operations is that the DDP would then discuss it with

command.

to Or he would make the decision on his own.
@ 2] Mr. Klein. So with regard to Helms, when he was DDP you
3 spoke to him directly. When he became Deputy Director or Direcr
4 tor, which eventually he did become, then the chain of command,
although you don't know of any specific instances, would have
6 || him still involved in the decisions?
7 Mr. Murphy. It would. In order to be absolutely correct

a} about it, the DDP as one of the Deputy Directors for Operations,
i

9 made his own judgment as to what he would discuss with the
if

q
io | Director, what he would not discuss with the Director.

i i

i |
inl Mr; Klein. There came a time in 1964, April 4, I believe, |
12 when the treatment received by Nosenko greatly changed in that |

. 13 | hostile interrogations began, is that dorrect?

! Mr. Murphy. I am not sure I agree with the formulation of
the question. |
|

16 Mr. Klein. Well, elaborate. :
Ww Mr. Murphy. No, the previous pattern of voluntary discussipn
18 of issues under consideration changed and Nosenko was not per-

19 | mitted to evade questions or to decide when he would or would

29 | not want to respond. i

5 Mr. Klein. Could you describe for us what the pattern was |
\
|

Se oe 22 | before as far as conditions and how it was changed?

Mr. Murphy. Well, the pattern before was one of pretty mach

permitting Nosenko to call the shots. In other words, we wanted

ag i his cooperation and we wanted to discuss these things in a

a full day's briefing, to want to go out socially all the time,

ie

'
3 which made it difficult the next day to continue to work. And
4] the most important apsect I think of the change was the decision
s | to confromt him with inconsistencies as opposed to taking what he
6 said and passing it on. |
74 Mr. Klein. What about the day-to-day living conditions,

8 | were they changed?

Mr. Murphy. Well, he was not permitted to leave. He was

|
|
10 | not permitted to depart? Other than that, in his day-to-day
q
i

n treatment, not the actual interrogation sessions, but just his |

12 | food intake, his recreation, was that changed at that time?

19 | Mr. Klein. Who made it to you?

. @ 2 a debriefing in which you permitted the person under debriefings,
3 in this case Nosénko, to believe that he was being believed when
ee es 4 | it was considered the issues under consideration were suffi-~ |
: |

5 ciently important and the inconsistencies seemed so glaring, |
“i so obvious, that it was thought by: confrontation we could resolve

‘5 | the matter and bring it to conclusion. Whereas the other way,

no, Nosenko would have rightly demanded full freedom, his |

regulization of his status, and an office in the building.

That was the reationale at that time.
i
Mr. Klein. Who actually made the decision to go ahead with}

this new mode of interrogation? ‘ : |

You said that Bagley recommended it to you? |
|

Mr. Murphy. «I concurred. ~~~
Mr. Klein. You consulted with Helms? i i
Mr. Murphy. I passed it on up the line and our recommendation
i
was agreed to, except with the proviso that Angleton did not

believe that we should attempt at this stage to confront him, we

18
1 ought. to spin it out for a long period of time. There were |
mi practical and legal security difficulties in that. If you pre-|
a
rf tend to a person that he is okay then you have to be prepared
2

| Mr. Murphy. Yes.

‘Mr. Murphy. I don't know.

Mr. Klein. Helms made on his own?

n

Mr. Murphy. I don't know.
Mr. Klein. Subsequent to April 4, is it correct that

|
| Nosenko was interrogated by people from the Soviet Russia

6

7 Division?

3 Mx. Murphy. That is right. |

9] Mr. Klein. And how were the particular sub-areas on which

10 he was interrogated chosen?

YW Mr. Murphy. I am not sure. I don't know. Subject areas? i

2 This is a guess, this is a recollection, but I think the decision
: @ 13 was made based on what the CIA people thought offered the best |
I i]

opportunity to get an admission and to break on that. In other!

1g | words, I think it was based on points that they had collatoral
- 1

i
16 | on. By that I mean other information which said what this man H

is saying is not the truth or this man does not know about this

13 | and, therefore, let us hit him hard on this. And so it was a fully

19 || tactical, these were tactical considerations relating to pos- |
\ i
20 | session.of information in the hands of the interrogators which ,

3) | then offered the best opportunity to get through and get the 1
|
2 | truth. |

22 || One breakthrough it was felt, as is normally the case, gives

24 | you other breakthroughs. The decision on what subjects to be

as i interrogated was essentially a factor of the tactics of the
a | ebriefing.

Mr. Klein. Would it be fair to say that after April 4 the
@ 2] subject areas were determined by a desire to try to catch him,
to break him, as opposed to a desire to gain knowledge that \
would be of use to you in your role as an intelligence agency?
3) In other words, knowledge of the operation.

é | Mx. Murphy. that is an accurate impression. The answer is
yes because by the end «of April there was a view that the man
8 \ was ae telling the truth, that parts of what he was saying wer

g known to be untrue and that, therefore, made no sense, and

mspenneesnenieue | Woe

19 i although the reasons for his behavior and his statements were
v | not clear, it made no sense then, it did not appear to make sende
12 to accept as valid any data he might provide unless you could

- e 13 be sure that that data was in fact correct, and there were so

: i

ig¢ | many doubts about this, leaving aside the motivation for it,
1s the contradictions or the way in which he presented it, that
16 : the information was not considered acceptable. .
7 Mr. Klein. And by the same token, when Nosenko was asked -7
this is again all subsequent to April 4 -- when Nosenko was asked
19 | followup questions, say, on Monday he was asked questions and on

i
20 Wednesday he was asked followup questions about the Monday's
i

21 | questions, would that again be determined by the fact that “1

22 | someone had made a decision that that area had potential for

at this time?

Mr. Murphy. Well, there were times when I wasn't there,
obviously, but I don't recall any major decisions of which IT |
would not have participated, at least in the discussion. |

Mr. Klein. Basically what I am saying is, would anybody haye

had the authority to make any kind of a significant decision coh-
cerning Nosenko without aoming to you and letting you know

about it, would Bagley for example have had that authority? |

Mr.

Would it be fair to say that you were closeenough to this that

if a decision was made of ny note you would know about it, if

not when it took place, afterwards?

Mr. Murphy. Yes, I would become aware of it.

Mr. Klein. Were you aware of the substance of what Nosenko

had to say bout Oswald?

Mr. Murphy. From the very first. I mean, when

lhe fixst said it back in February or March.

Mr. Klein. Do you recall now the substance of it?

Mr. Murphy. No, not exactly, anything I said would be

polluted by so much back anf forth. I know that the thrust of

the message was that Oswald was never of interest to the Soviet

Intelligence Services, that he was never debriefed by them, and

I can guarantee that because I was personally involved in the

jaffair.

There is moré detail but I can't really pin it down.

Mr. Klein. Did you accept this statement by Noesnko, you |
personally.

Mr. Murphy. I did not. I did not believe that it would
be possible for the Soviet Intelligence Services to have
remained indifferent to the arrival in 1959 in Moseow of a
former Marine radar operator who had served at what was an
active U-2 operational base. I found that to be strange. It

was only later, I.think that as the Nosenko case and its other

ramifications began to emerge that it seeme to me that the

Oswald story became. even: more unusual.

I think I mentioned the other day it seems to me almost i

didn't seem to be part of the real body of the other things

that he had to say, many of which were true. You understand i

that Nosenko was

much of what he said was true. i

Mr. Klein. You are talking about other areas?

Mr. Murphy. Yes sir. This one seemed to be tacked on and

i

didn't have much relationship and it seemed to be so totally
dependent on not just one coincidence but a whole series of
coincidences, for him to have been there and all that sort of
thing. That is what I mean.
Mr.. Klein. Do you recall any other specifics about what :
bothered. you about the Nosenko statements on Oswald? For

example, what incidences bothered you?

Mr. Murphy. Well, I didn't remember this very well, but


: Ur oobael 7

j the one when Oswald tried to commit suicide, Nosenko happened

nD

to be on duty or something, and what is how he knew what |
happened. This is very vague, in my mind, but that is one

other thing I recall.

a

3 | Mr. Klein. Do you recall any other specifics about what
é | you could not accept in Nosenko's statements about Oswald? i
7 Mr. Murphy. Yes, that they just ~- this is part of the

g | first one --=no contact was ever made,that he went up to Minsk

9 | and lived happily and well with no contact. The Soviet Union

with foreigners don't do that. I mean, he is the only person. f

Read the accounts of what happened to this poor gentleman,

what happened to Jay Crawford in Moscow and their intensive

debriefing of him on the layout of the American Embassy. It

17 Mr. Klein. Would you distinguish between first the fact \

13 |, that nobody debrieFe@Oswald when he first came to the Soviet

i

19 | Union, nobody tried to find out what he knew as a Marine, as |

20 a radar operator, and, second, the fact that once they decided i

2 | to allow him to stay, nobody debriefed him to find out if he

22 | was some kind of a Western security agent or working for CIA?

43 Mr. Murphy. Yes, they would be two different points. The
- a first point clearly involves the KGB and GRU. This is simply _

ag _ a Chap arriving with this background and no -one taking the time’

3

feet what did the blips look like. I don't think they had

many American radar operators handling operational traffic
s involving U-2s.
6 Mr. Klein. How would you react to a statement by Nosenko
7 | that although the KGB knew Oswald was a Marine, they did not

3 || bother to question him, and because of that never knew that he |

9 | was a radar operator or that he worked at the base from which j

the U-2s took off and landed? {
Mr. Murphy. I think it would be strange. |

2 | My other point, going back to your first question, that |

6 3 is, the first aspect of your question, which is the initial

arrival and lack of debriefing. There is no indication here |
that the GRU was advised, which in the case of a defector,
there is no operational interest in a defector. GRU would be

properly the outfit that would want to be talking to any Marine.

o

They will talk to a Marine about close order drill. You follow;

19 | me? It doesn't require that he be known to have been a radar

20 operator or that he be known to have been a -- they would talk

a to him about his military affiliation: just as we would.

73 | some. people think the Soviets are ten foot tall. I don't believe

i
| if
2 | they are. I think they are very, very, very much the other way.

they will not ascribe to the Soviets the same elemental

we in Germany will talk to a private in the East German Border |

private. He was a corporal in the Marine Corps, who had state

9 Mr. Klein. Andon the basis of your experience and know- ;

Mr. Murphy. And other things.

-@ 13 i Mr. Klein. Do you know of comparable situations where

: E is somebody wasn't questioned like this, was just left alone, as j
1s Nosenko says Oswald was?
16 | Mr. Murphy. I honestly couldn't find anyone, or I am not
7 | aware of anyone that the division or the CI Staff, that is,
13 | thos officers concerned with this case, were handling it i

did, I never heard of it.

Mr. Klein. During this interrogation period, beginning

in April of 1964, would it be fair to say that the questions

discussing relating to Oswald constituted a major’area for

guestioning. and interrogating Nosenko?

nw

oe

Mx. Murphy. Probably not.

Mr. Klein. Why would that have been?

Mr. Murphy. Because there were many other areas which

posed equally interesting aspects yet about which we knew much
more and which had occurred abroad and involved collateral

a knowledge, which obviously is not easy for us to obtain in the

Soviet Union.
10} Mr. Klein. Who in the Soviet Russia Division made the
n| decision as to who would question Nosenke, subsequent to
12 April 4th? oo . a
i
i
|

Mr. Murphy. Bagley, Chief of the Group.

Mr. Klein. And do you know of.any criteria that he used
to pick his interrogators?

Mr. Murphy. Some knowlege of Russian, as Nosenko's

English was not good, the fact that he had been exposed. Well
12 | that is one of the aspects of the CIA interrogation. You try
19 not to use too many people because you then lose. In the

first place, you are dealing with a potentially hostile guy

rey
tod

21 who is liable to go back to the Soviet Union or return to the
other side, and so you don't want to propose too many officers

plus the fact it is not a good idea to simply bring a lot of

people in. You have to have people who studied the case and

became in depth, know it in depth and therefore, so they use

the officers that they had available and there were a variety

of criteria.

Mr. Klein. As I mentioned to you in our conversations

about a weeks ago, it is our information that the person who

|| interrogated Nosenko about the Oswald matter had no Pckecocad |

4 whatsoever in Oswald, he didn't know anything about Oswald's

7 background or really about Oswald at all. Is there any reason |

8 that such a person would be used that you can tell us?

9 Mr. Murphy. I am not sure I understand. I thought the

|

10 point was that he had, he was not a man'of a lot of background |

WW | in the CI debriefings or interrogations. I wasn't sure of the |

2 point he didn't know about Oswald. I am not sure very many of |

c @ 13 | us knew very much about Oswald than was available at the time. :
Td Mr. Klein. Two points.--
1s | Mr. Murphy. The reason that the chap was chosen was |

16 | becasus he was levelheaded, extremely toughminded, and was

17 | going to be with the case for the long pull. He was not going

13 to be changed. That is why he was used. And his career since i
19 then has borne out the judgment of many, he is a very good
|
20 | officer.
21 Mr. Klein. But wouldn't --

| Mr. Murphy. I don't know that he didn't, that he wasn't,

\
73 | what you are saying, he knew nothing at all about Oswald's
i

case. I find that difficult to believe. But I don't know.

2s i Mr. Klein. Well, if I asked you to consider a hypothetical

i

oO Se |

| situation, where I told you the officer who interrogated Oswald
7) c knew nothing about Oswald other than what he learned from
3] Nosenko, would you think that was unusual that they would not H

8) everything that the CIA knew about Oswald, would you think htat
ry was unusual, they didn't do that? |
8 ; Mr. Murphy. I would certainly think so.
: | Mr. Klein. The second question, part of my question was
io the other point I made to you a week ago when we spoke, is |
n that to our knowledge, let me be frank, we spoke to the par-
12 ticular officer in a deposition, so that our knowledge is ~ |
@ 13 i gained from all that, it is possible that since I have not i
1a seen the typed up deposition that what I say might not be
18 | exactly what the deposition says, but my recollection of it is
\
164 that he also had little or no prior interrogation experience,
y i
7 and my question is would that be --
i
3 | Mr. Murphy. That wouldn't surprise me because there were |
| i
9 | very few people, relatively few people, in the Division or
indeed elsewhere who had a lot of interrogation experience. i

H
We hadn't done a lot of very many Hostile CIA debriefings. i
People who might have been used were probably otherwise, either

\
abroad, might have had experience, but I know it might sound |

strange. There just wasn't aquads and squads of highly trained

fluent Russian speaking CI experienced interrogators. |

1 Mr. Klein. One thing I would point out to you is that I

have listened to a number of tapes, and all of the ones I have

listened to were totally in English, there was no Russian.

oe

Mr. Murphy. Yes,

wo

Mr. Klein. My question. is, was Nosenko, the questioning

of Nosenko considered a major operation in the Bureau in 1964?
?
Mr. Murphy. It was an important operation, an'important |

a Mr. Klein. And yet there was nobody with interrogation |

|
n Mr. Murphy. I am sure some of the people had interroga- j

|) tion experience. I mean Bagley himself had a lot of background,

in this field. I can't explain why the officer who debriefed |

him on Oswald did not have prior briefing on Oswald except |
i
what I mentioned to you the other day, because it was not a i
|
thing that we thought we were going to get through on, because

we were weak in that area at that time.

Mr. Klein. You say at that time. Did you become stronger,

about today everybody seems at awe about, the Mexico angle,

fo 2 we knew nothing about, particularly involved Cubans. If it

involved one Russian case it was because of the coordination
collection was done by CI Staff. They made information
available to the Warren Commission and it was not lateral, tha

is what I meant by saying, I know more about it today than I

knew then.

a | Mr. Klein. In 1967, the decision was made to allow Bruce

Soley to in effect reinvestigate Nosenko's bona fides?
i

{

{ Mr. Murphy. Yes sir.

u | Mr. Klein. And eventually he wrote a report?

i2 Mr. Murphy. Bruce had participated in every way in the

case from the beginning. He monitored many of the debriefings
or interrogations, I can't tell you exactly how many, because
I don't know, but I know he was involved, I know I had many
discussions with him about the case, and some of the other

leads that developed from the case. So he was the logical man

18 | for the Office of Security and for CIS management to pick if

19 they wanted another look taken of the case.

20 | Mr. Klein. You say that you had many discussions with
21) him?

Mr. Klein. What was his general viewpoint prior to 1967

Mr. Murphy. He didn't know why Nosenko was saying the
‘@ i { things he was saying, but some of the things he said he thought

: ! Mr. Klein. The first part you have elaborated?
5 | Mr. Murphy. He didn't understand the motivation under-

@ 13 i Mr. Murphy. I don't mean, I am not being sarcastic. He

18 Divisions, was that they were not leads which went anywhere |

20 already out of play, and that is what I mean when I said that- |

assignment that he was given in '67?

for the case was transferred to the Office of Security, as a

Mr. Klein. What would be your reaction to learning. that

the reservations which you and others had concerning what

é Nosenko had to say about Oswald, were not resolved in any way
ca by Bruce Soley and yet he reached an opinion which, whether
a it is qualified or not, found Nosenko to be bona fide?

12 investigation into the statements Nosenko made about Oswald,

@ 13 nothing new came up, say in 1968, that you didn't know about

Mr. Murphy. It is very difficult for me to comment on

On the other hand, if Nosenko had been given this informa-
tion by some third person, in the KGB, even though he did not |
admit that he had been a dispatched agent, it would certainly
be important for us to know in terms of the way in which the i
Soviets looked upon the assassination case. {

Mr. Klein. Was Nosenko ever given any drugs?

Mr. Murphy. Not to my knowledge. |

Mr. Klein. Were there ever any conversations in which |
you took part about whether to give him drugs in order to get
him to tell the truth?

Mr. Murphy. There were many, nay conversations all the
time about various things that could be done, all the tech-
niques that are known, to get him to talk, but as far as I
know and in discussions with the medical officer who handled '
the case, there was never any decision made or any attempt

made to use these, because none of them appeared to be likely

to produce results and they all would be very harmful and,
therefore, not produce results.

Mr. Murphy. That is correct.

Mr. Klein. Is there any doubt in your mind that somehow
an order could have been given to give him drugs which never
would have been transmitted to you?

Mr. Murphy. It would certainly surprise me.

Mr. Klein. Does the CIA have any procedures when it
does administer drugs to subjects, record keeping procedures,

for example?

Mr. Murphy. I assume so, but I have no personal knowledge

of it?

Mr. Klein. Do you know?

Mr. Murphy. Because it would be done by the technical
division.

Mr.-Klein. What I am getting at --

Mr. Murphy. It wouldn't be -- the record keeping would
not be done by us.

Mr. Klein. ts there some kind of procedure used by CIA
whereby you could simply go to some records someplace and
check the dates involved and you could know beyond a shadow
of a doubt drugs were not administered since they are not in
the record?

Mr. Murphy. I don't know that.
