section, each shall be fined not more than $20,000 or impriséned
not more than twenty years, or both, and shall be ineligible for
employment by the United States or any department or agency thereof,
for the five years next following his conviction.

“As used in this section, the terms torganizes' and ‘organize’, with
respect to any society, group, or assembly of persons, include the
recruiting of new members, the forming of new units, and.the regroup-
ing or expansion of existing clubs, classes, and other units of

such society, group, or assembly of persons."

The courts have interpreted this statute to require advocacy to
action, i.e., advocacy to do something, now or in the future, rather
than merely to believe in something.

In addition to the three principal statutes outlined above, there
.are-two other statutes which might provide a statutory foundation for
an investigation under this section. These are:

d. [Internal Security Act of 1950 (T 50, USC, § 783a)

In addition to the three principal statutes outlined in sub-

paragraphs a., be, and co, the Internal Security Act could

provide a statutory basis for investigation of certain cases

under this Section. This Act makes it unlawful to knowingly

contribute to the establishment of a totalitarian dictatorship

within the United States which is controlled by a foreign

government, organization, or individual. ]
Prosecutive determination
All discussions pertaining to the prosecutive potential of investigations
initiated under this section will be conducted by FBIHQ with Departmental
officials. These cases should not be acre with local U. S. Attorney's
office without FBIHQ approval.
Related statutes
There are a number of other statutes under the FBI's investigative
jurisdiction which should be borne in mind in handiing these investigations.
Information concerning possible violations of such statutes is frequently
developed during these investigations. Where this occurs the field ‘should
consider the desirability of conducting investigation in line with the
policies. and procedures governing the statute in question.

A list of other Federal statutes which may arise during these investigations
is outlined in an appendix to this manual.

Definitions

The term "subversiye activities" as used in this section denotes

activities which are aimed at overthrowing, destroying or undermining the
Government of the United States or any of its political subdivisions by

the illegal means prohibited by statutes enumerated in A. 1. above. The
term "subversive organization" or "subversive movement" denotes a group

or movement which is known to engage in or advocate subversive activities,
as defined above.

a : . ORGANIZATIONS AND INDIVIDU: :

5. Predication for investigation
In all cases handled under the provisions of this section, the first
communication prepared for outside dissemination (report or LHM) should
show specifically the statute upon which the investigation is based
. together with necessary supporting facts. Where investigation has been
specifically requested by Department, this should be indicated. The
following examples are illustrative; however, the basis for each
individual case must be tailored to the circumstances of such case.
ae "This investigation is based: on information that the subject's
activities could involve violation of T 18, USC, § 2383 (Rebellion
or Insurrection), and § 2384 (Seditious Conspiracy)» A source whose
reliability has not been determined has informed that the subject
is planning, along with others, to travel to Washington, D. C.,

. on April 30, 1971, to participate in planned violent demonstrations
during the first week in May, 1971, to ‘shut down the Government.!
Demonstration plans include the blocking of streets and highways,
destruction of personal and Government property, and physical
obstruction to prevent Government employees from reporting to work."

b. "This investigation is based on information that the subject's
activities could involve a violation of T 18, USC, § 2385 (Advocating
the overthrow of the Government). The subject is an admitted member
(or has beén identified as a member by a confidential source who
has provided reliable information in the past) of (name of group).

The (name of group) in its public statements and publications :

advocates the desirability and necessity of overthrowing the U. S.
Government by force or violence, and the assassination of U. S.
sot Government officers. The same source has reported that the subject
actively supports these positions."

. Where possible, the first intra~Bureau communication prepared which
[ indicates that investigation is being[conducted]should specifically
: indicate the statutory basis for the investigation. However, there
may be occasions involving individuals or groups in contact with known
subversive clements where the purpose of the contact is not initially
known and where a preliminary inquiry must be made to determine
whether a statutory basis exists for full investigation. In these
instances, a preliminary inquiry may be undertaken, through estab-
lished sources, for a period not to exceed 90 days, without specifically
indicating the specific statutory basis for the inquiry. If after the
conclusion of 90 days it has not been possible to establish a
statutory basis but further inquiry appears necessary, FBIHQ must
be furnished a succinct summary of the facts by letter together with
specific recommendations as to further action. In all cases, of
course, investigations must be based on indications that subject
may be engaged in subversive activity, whether or not a specific
statutory basis is cited.

In the event preliminary inquiries fail to establish a sound basis

for investigation, the case should be promptly closed and there is.

no need to advise FBIHQ (unless FBIHQ has been previously advised

of the inquiry). Nor is there any need to prepare an LHM or report
where no pertinent subversive derogatory information has been developed.

If the statutory basis for an investigation should change or be
‘ expanded to include an additional statute or statutes, the first
D communication prepared subsequent to such change or expansion should
specifically show such changes. Similarly, this information should
be included in the next report or LHM prepared in the case.

characterizations, affiliations or memberships are not commonly and
publicly known.

7» Investigations and contacts with individuals connected with institutions
of learning
a. Prior FBIHQ approval is required to:

(1) Institute investigation of a faculty member or an organization
connected with an educational institution.

(2) Interview any student or faculty member who is not an established
source. (Requests to conduct interviews must include individual's
name, position, and an assessment of his reliability and dis-
cretion.)

SECTION 87. INVESTIGATIONS OF SUBVERSIVE
@. PATIOS OD MOWING

Furnish FBIHQ with copy of publicatioas which portray subversive
character of group or which advocate violence. Ascertain sources
of funds for publications. When it is operated as distinct entity,
a separate investigation should be initiated concerning the publication.
f. Finances
Sources of funds and nature of expenditures, in particular whether
any income is received from or contributions made to foreign elements.
8+ Connections with other groups
Develop pertinent information concerning ties with other subversive
elements including material and/or moral support given or réceived.
Be especially alert to detect connections with foreign subversive
elements or indications of foreign allegiance or control. Also
determine and report any significant connections or cooperation
with nonsubversive groups.
he Activities
Describe activities of groupe Afford special emphasis to any under-
ground operations or activities involving violence or threatened
violence. Include any pertinent data showing success or failure of
organization in achieving its stated goals.
Infiltration of nonsubversive groups
ae General
‘When information is received indicating that subversive group is
seeking to systematically infiltrate and control a nonsubversive
organization, available data should be submitted by letter with
recommendations as to initiating active investigation. Recommendation
to undertake investigation should be supported by available background
information concerning target organization (including name and
locations, estimated membership, principal officers, and nature of
activities) and resume of extent of subversive infiltration efforts
(including identities of known subversives who have joined target
organization and positions held), provide brief statement as’ to
investigation planned. If approved by FBIHQ conduct discreet
investigation limited to determining and reporting activities which
are related to or in furtherance of subversive infiltration. These
instructions apply to local chapters or affiliates as well as national
organization.
be Caption and preface
Captions of communications should show that subversive infiltration
of target organization is objective of investigation, not organization
itself, e.g., "Infiltration of (Name of target organization) by (Name
of subversive organization). All communications prepared for
dissemination should carry prefatory statement which clearly conveys
this point, e.ge\."This investigation is directed solely towards
establishing the extent of infiltration, domination, or control of the
(Name of nonsubversive organization) by the (Name of subversive
organization). It is not concerned with the normal activities of the
(Name of nonsubversive organization).'' In addition, preface should
succinctly show the predication for out investigation of the subversive
group involved. _
ce Limitations on investigation
(1) Other than with established sources, no interviews should be
initiated with members, leaders, or officers of infiltrated
organization without prior FBIHQ approval (except where they
can be handled by suitable pretext). However, this does not
preclude accepting information volunteered to FBI.

(2) Informants and sources should not be directed by FBI to join
: or participate in activities of target organization. However,
"if subversive group-requests informaht to do’So0, latter miay
comply.
(3) Be certain all persons interviewed, including informants, are
aware that FBI is not interested in normal activities of target
7 organization but solely in efforts to influence or control the
organization by subversive elements.
4. Conversion to full scale investigation 5
A If target organization becomes completely dominated and controlled by
, Subversive elements, advise PBIHQ on UACB basis that full investigation
is being initiated as subversive organization. Drop infiltration
designation from title of case.
5. Subversive publications
Each office should reviewlany independent subversive ]publications produced
in its territory[(as contrasted with publications issued by subversive
groups which are under investigation, see Be 3. e. above) |to determine
- whether any advocate violations within FBI jurisdiction. If so, submit .
available information by LHM to FBIHQ with copy of pertinent material and
make recommendations as to further action. Insure that FBIHQ is aware of
all subversive publications with brief identifying data.”
6. Investigative steps
Efforts should be made to develop reliable informants at all levels and
in all segments of subversive organization.

Live informant coverage should be supplemented by other logical investigation
including review of appropriate public records and publications,
interviews with former members ot group ana, on seieciive Lasis, through
such techniques as physical and photographic surveillance.
7. Administrative and reporting procedures
ae Reporting requirements and status
When necessary data has been developed concerning organization's
[ activities (See B.[3.]above), submit report. After initial report,
reports should be submitted semiannually (unless FBIHQ has instructed
otherwise in individual cases). LHM may be used to provide FBIHQ or
- other interested agencies with significant data of immediate interest
on an interim basis between reports.
De Informant coverage
Cover pages of reports should include a brief summary of informant
coverage available with respect to the organization, identifying
informants who report on the group's activities by symbol number and
showing specifically which informants are members of the group.
Ce Topical headings i
Both reports and LHMs should be organized under logical headings.
d. Character
All cases should use character "Internal Security," e.ge, "Communist
Party, USA; Internal Security.'* In case of subsidiary or front group,
character should show name or abbreviation of the parent organization,
eeg-, "Young Workers Liberation League, Internal Security ~- CPUSA";
"Young Socialist Alliance, Internal Security - SWP." Caption of
subversive infiltration cases should include name of subversive group
and target organization, e-g-, "Infiltration of (Name of target
organization) by Socialist Workers Party, Internal Security - SWP."

to their areas of responsibility and interest.
Individuals to be investigated
Investigations should be conducted to fully identify and determine
the activities and affiliations of persons who:
Are reported to be engaged in activities which may result in a violation
of statutes enumerated in A. 1. above. This includes individuals who
are current active members of subversive organization or movement.
Where formal membership in a subversive movement does not exist, it
includes individuals who are actively supporting the subversive goals
of the movement.
Priority investigative attention should be given to individuals who
are known or suspected of being involved in subversive activities
which are of a clandestine, underground, or violent nature.
Limitations on investigations
Ali investigations couducicd shuuid avuid acbulous oz
which are not relevant to objectives. Under no circumstances should

subversiveorganization, the office of-origin should promptly
furnish FBIHQ with a communication suitable for dissemination
setting forth sufficient identifying data and a brief summary

of the individual's subversive activities together with details
of the individual's candidacy for public office. In the absence
of a violation of a specific Federal statute, no investigation
should be conducted until subject's candidacy for public office
is resolved. Information received during the period of the indi-~
vidual's candidacy indicating a specific violation of Federal
law(s) should be furnished FBINQ by means consistent with the
exigencies of the situation along with recommendations as to
additional action warranted. Other unsolicited subversive infor~
mation received from sources and informants or obtained incidental
to other investigations should be channeled to the individual's

(7) Physical and photographic surveillances. These should be
considered on selective basis when circumstances indicate they

ce Interviews of subjects

(1) Policy
Subjects of investigation should be interviewed unless there
is a sound basis for not doing so. Generally, interviews should
be considered after background inquiries have been completed
and a good picture of subject's activities developed.

If a decision not to interview a subject is made, this should be

7 fully explained in case file and PBIHQ advised whenever FBIHQ
is cognizant of investigation.

(2) Purpose
To develop information regarding subversive activities in which
the subject is engaged.

3) Approval to interview
All interviews of subjects may be approved by SAC except following
instances which require FBIHQ approval:

(a) Deleted

(b) When subject is nationally prominent or where circumstances

otherwise indicate the interview could be widely publicized,
such as labor leaders, educators, religious leaders or
journalists.

(c) When interview is to be conducted in presence of subject's

attorney and/or aide.

(d) When subject is connected with institution of learning.

[In those instances where FBIHQ approval is not required, case
Agent should prepare a memorandum requesting SAC authority for
interview. This memorandum should include a succinct resume of

‘the case, including a review of office files concerning a subject,
and should indicate the objectives of an interview. Memorandum
must be approved by SAC or in his absence, by a designated official. J

List above items by number but headings need not be restated.
If no pertinent data is available concerning a particular
item, so indicate.

(b) Submit one copy of letter and additional copy of first page

- only which can be returned by FBIHQ stamped "Approved."
(5) If interview not conducted within 60 days, submit letter advising

FBIHQ:

(a) Reason interview not conducteds

(b) Any new information pertinent to desirability of interview.

(c) Whether efforts to interview subject will be pursued. There-
after, keep FBIHQ advised at least each 60 days as to progress
of matter.

(6) Conduct of interview.

(a) Interviews of subjects entitled to the warning and waiver
shall be conducted in accordance with the requirements set
forth in Volume I, Manual of Instructions, Section 2B,
page 15. If the interview is being conducted for intelligence
information rather than an admission or confession of
“guilt, no warning is required. Moreover, if the investigation
has failed to develop information indicating a possible
violation of Federal law by the subject, it would be
permissible to interview the subject without a warning as
he does not fit the criteria of those entitled to a warning
of rights. Carefully plan interview so there will be no
compromise of sources, sensitive techniaues or interviewing
personnel. An overriding consideration to always bear in
mind is that interview should elicit from, not provide

7 information to the subject. 7

(b) Interview at subject's place of employment should be
avoided if possible. If attorney or aide is present during
interview, interview must be conducted by two Agents.

(c) If, during conduct of interview subject desires that his
attorney or aide be present, the interview should be tact-
fully terminated, and FBIHQ should be informed with recommen-
dation whether or not to resume interviews

(ad) In all other instances, SAC has responsibility and option
of deciding when two Agents should handle interview. Safety
of Agents is first priority to consider.

(7) Direction of subject's activities.

Prior FBIHQ approval is required before taking any steps to direct

the subject's activities even though he may appear to bé cooperative

during the interview.
(8). Reporting results of interview.

(a) Record results of interview on FD-302.

(b) Pertinent results of interview should be included in next
report or LHM unless circumstances indicate need for more
expeditious reporting. In cover letter or administrative
pages, include observations of interviewing Agents as to
subject's cooperativeness, any relevant information
concerning subject's appearance or characteristics, and
assessment of information developed by interview in light
of other data known to your office.

Status c
Carry cases as pending until logical inquiries aimed at resolving
purpose of investigation have been completed. As minimum, case
snould be kept pending until essential background data regarding
subject has been secured and sufficient information developed. to present
good picture of nature and extent of subversive activities engaged in
by subject.
Closing and reopening of cases
If it is determined that subject's current activities do not involve
an actual or potential violation of one or more of the statutes
enumerated in A. 1. above, case should be closed.

“Case may be reopened at a later date if additional information is

received which indicates subject's subsequent activities involve or

may result in a violation of the statutes cited in A. 1.

Subject traveling abroad (Also see section 105G volume IV, of this

manual).

Take following action when information is received that subject of

current investigation intends to travel abroad or has departed on foreign

travel (except where travel is of brief duration and is known _to be

for innocuous purpose, such as vacation):

(1) Immediately notify FBIHQ of available details concerning travel,
including places and dates of departure and intended return,
destination, itinerary, purpose of trip, and pertinent passport
data. Include full description of subject, including aliases.

office of origin request verification within 30 days. If new residence
confirmed, office of origin submit FD~128 to transfer origin. Office
of origin should furnish new office with any pertinent subversive data
which has not previously been reported in a form suitable for dissemina- -

Dissemination. to Secret Service... af fe . epee .
inder agreement between FBI and Secret .Servicé concerning protective
‘réspofisibilities (Set -out*in' section 102, -volume IV, ‘of this marival); *

reports and LHMs are disseminated to Secret Service both locally

and at FBIHQ in all cases which meet standards set forth. This

includes virtually all cases on individuals where any substantial

information exists as to subversive activities or sympathies of
subject. When photographs are available send copies to Secret

Service locally and to FBIHQ for dissemination at headquarters

level.

(1) Secret Service should be advised of reason for referral; ice,
statement of class or classes of agreement which apply to
subject. FD-376 serves as letter of transmittal for both local
and FBIHQ dissemination. Forward original and one copy to FBIHQ
and maintain copy in case file.

(2) After initial dissemination, as changes occur in residence and
employment, advise Secret Service locally by FD-366 and furnish
two copies to FBIHQ. FD-366 must be submitted even though changes
in residence and/or employment are noted in report or LHM being
submitted.

(3) For instructions governing dissemination to Secret Service in
matters involving threats against President, refer to section
134B, volume IV, of this manual.

(4) Upon transfer of office of origin, old office of origin should
furnish Secret Service locally with subject's new residence and
business address by LHM or FD-366. Provide copies to FBIHQ and
new office of origin for dissemination to Secret Service head-
quarters and branch office covering new residence, respectively.

(5) As an administrative aid to insure proper dissemination, the rile
covers of cases in which dissemination is being made to Secret
Service may be stamped "SS."

MINISTRATIVE INDEX (ADEX)

Purpose and general policy ‘

ae To have a readily available and up-to-date listing of individuals
deemed currently dangerous to the national security. Objective is to
identify individuals who should be afforded priority investigative
coverage in the event of a national emergency.

be Under no circumstance should individuals be included in ADEX merely
because of their opposition to Government policies or because of the
exercise of their constitutional rights of protest and dissent.

c. ADEX is strictly an administrative device. It should not be treated
as a factor in determining basic investigative decisions, i.e.,
whether an investigation should be opened or closed, the extent of
investigation to be conducted in a particular case, etcs

Criteria :

ae ADEX should include individuals whose actions or statements have
established that they represent a current threat to the national
security, ise.,:

Individuals (whether affiliated with organized groups or not) who
have shown a willingness and capability of engaging in treason, _
rebellion or insurrection, sedition, sabotage, espionage, terrorism,
guerrilla warfare, assassination of government officials, or other
such acts which would result in interference with or a threat to

the survival and effective operation of national, state or local
government.

NW 65360 Docld:32989654 Page 32 9-13-73



SECTION. 87. INVESTIGATIONS OF SUBVERSIVE:

This would include leaders of organizations whose, aims include the
throw/or destiuction of ‘the Government, of ,the United States’ or-the .
.” govetnment ‘of ‘any’ ‘st: : 'y, district > or possession thereof,
“+-or the government ‘of any political subdivision therein, by unlawful
means. The term "leaders" denotes those individuals, irrespective
of title, who are in a position to significantly influence the
policies or direct the activities of the group. Mere membership
in an organization, without the element of leadership or without a
demonstrated willingness and capability described in paragraph a,
is not sufficient for inclusion in ADEX.

c. Individuals should be considered a “current threat" to the national .
security when reliable information has been developed that they have
engaged in activity or exhibited the requisite willingness and capability
falling within the above-described criteria during prior two years
and there is no indication they have ceased such activity. However,
there may be instances where retention of an individual in ADEX is
justified even though no pertinent information is available during
the prior two years. For example, such retention might be warranted
in the case of individuals who have gone into hidinglor]temporarily
left the country. [Following guidelines should be followed with
respect to imprisoned subjects. If already on ADEX and sentence is
such that the earliest possible release date from actual incarcera-
tion is more than two years after sentencing, subject should be rec-
ommended for removal from ADEX. If possible, stop should be placed
with facility where incarcerated so office will receive notifica-
tion of release, after which subject should be considered for pos-
sible reactivation on ADEX. Whether or not a stop can be placed,
necessary administrative procedure should be set up so that sub~
Jevi?s couiiuucd incarcération is verified at least every six months.

t If case is not pending, it should be placed in a pending inactive
rather than closed status. If a subject under investigation appears

to qualify for ADEX but is ‘under sentence for over two years as de-
scribed above, do not recommend for ADEX but follow procedures
described above to consider for ADEX upon release from imprisonment.
Sentences which permit releases in less than two years should be ignored
as a factor in considering ADEX status. These guidelines are for
application only as to ADEX status and have no bearing on whether or

not subjects should be investigated. For those cases in a closed

status at time these new guidelines become effective, they should be
brought in line with the new guidelines when the cases are next
reviewed for any reason. ]

d. ADEX should not include individuals who may be ideologically committed
to a philosophy which calls for the downfall of our form of government
or which favors another form of society but who have not shown a current
willingness or capability of engaging in meaningful action to promote
their beliefs. This might apply, for example, to rank-and-file members
of the Socialist Workers Party or the Communist Party, USA, or other
old-line revolutionary groups which have advocated an overthrow of
our present form of government but where subject's activity is
primarily ideological in nature and not oriented toward action. Each
case should be reviewed on an individual basis in the light of the
criteria enumerated above.

3. Recommendation for preparation of ADEX card

a. When dangerousness of subject has been established, office of origin
should prepare recommendation on FD=122, in triplicate. Forward
original and copy to FBIHQ, and place copy in subject's file.

be Attach additional page or pages to FD-122 setting out succinct
summary of facts on which recommendation based.

c. Nonprosecutive summary report should be submitted when subject is
recommended for ADEX unless one was previously furnished to FBIHQ. 4
In latter instance, submit up-to-date report. .

d. Do not delay recommendation for ADEX because of absence of complete
background or descriptive data.

4. GUIDELINES FOR FBI INVESTIGATIONS

Fundament21 to all investigations by the FBI is the need to protect the
constitutional rights of any individual while still thoroughly and
expeditiously discharging those responsibilities with which it is charged
by statutes and Directives of the President and the Attorney General.

The FBI is a fact-finding agency which seeks with equal vigor to gather
evidence which will aid in the successful prosecution, or establish the
innocence, of alleged violators of laws of the United States or of those
who are accused of seeking by force to subvert or overthrow the Government
of the United States. The FBI makes no determination of the guilt or
innocence of any individual or group so accused.

B
In matters affecting the security of the United States, under no circumstance
is an investigation conducted of any individual on the basis that such indi-
vidual supports unpopular causes or opposes Government policies. All inves-
tigations of subversive or extremist activities are directed to the collection
of information pertinent to a determination as to whether or not the subject
has violated, or is engaged in activities which may result in a violation of,

f one of several specifically enumerated Federal statutes; or are in fulfill-

and essential background data regarding the subjecte No electronic surveil-
lance may be instituted without the specific authority of the Attorney Generale
Prior FBIHQ approval is required to institute an investigation of a facuity
member or an organization connected with an institution of learning or to
interview a student or faculty member other than established sources. Inves-
tigations of foreign diplomatic or official personnel are not instituted with-
out ‘specific approval by FBIHQ and clearance from-the Department of State.

No investigations are conducted of active or retired members of the U. S.
military forces under terms of-a delimitations agreement entered into between
the FBI and the counterintelligence services of the armed forces.

+ CRIMINAL INTELLIGENCE - ORGANIZED CRIME 7 i
Where matters of @ criminal intelligence nature or organized crime are
concerned, investigations are conducted to develop and maintain current
information on the activities of organized crime in general, and to develop
substantive cases against individual racket figures. These investigations
are highly selective and are concentrated on the leaders of organized crime
and their reported associates. Any electronic surveillance used in these
investigations requires approval of the Bureau, the Attorney General, and
authorization by a court order.

D. APPLICANT-TYPE MATTERS

In the area of applicant investigations, specific standards have been
established to protect the rights of individuals, All relevant information,
both favorable and unfavorable, obtained concerning an individual must be
duly reported; investigation is limited to checks of pertinent records and
interviews of persons in a position to furnish relevant information; persons
furnishing derogatory information are requested to furnish a signed statement.
The FBI makes no evaluation or recommendation to the requesting agency
concerning the applicant. .

PREFACE. GUIDELINES FOR FBI INVESTIGATIONS

GENERAL CRIMINAL SND fe, ee 7 td

Our investigative jurisdiction in criminal cases is based on specizic
violations of Federal laws. Investigations are conducted when information
is received indicating a violation of a Federal law, over which we have been
Given investigative jurisdiction, has occurred. Results of our investigations
are furnished to United States Attorneys or the Department of Justice for
determination of the course of any prosecutive action, The decision may be
made to present the case to a Federal Grand Jury cr, if the facts so justify,
to arrest the subject, in which latter instance the arrest is made on the
basis of authorized prosecution and the issuance of a warrant. Upon arrest,
the subject must be brought before the nearest United States Magistrate or

Federal Judge -in accordance with established rules of Federal criminal
procedure.

Requests for FBI investigations in selected civil matters in which the United
States is or may de a party in interest are received from the United States
Attorneys and/or the Department of Justice, These are handled in strict
conformity with guidelines furnished by the Department of Justice, as are also

., investigations of violations of the civil rights, antiriot, election laws,

and antitrust laws.
GENERAL PRINCIPLES

In addition to these principles, numerous other restrictions apply to all
phases of our work. For example, our authority to arrest fugitives is
statutory. The United States Code empowers Special Agents to make arrests
and carry firearms but FBI policy further requires that only that force may
be used which is necessary to effect arrest with due regard being observed
for the safety of the arresting officers and others.

“Special Agents are not permitted to shoot anyone except in self-defense.

No surveillances are conducted in the White House, the Capitol, the Supreme
Court, or the House and Senate Office Buildings. No surveillance, electronic
or otherwise, may be instituted on any member of Congress, any Justice or
Judge, or any principal functionary of the Executive Branch. Our Special
Agents may not engage in entrapment or any other improper, illegal, or
unethical tactics in procuring information or evidence; any critical
complaints concerning FBI personnel must be thoroughly investigated; any
testimony by a Special Agent in court must be given clearly and without bias
or embellishment.

The foregoing is a general statement of guidelines for FBI investigations.
All investigative personnel must follow these rules.

to take pais ‘to find, ®. and’ ‘collate’ ity Court felt nat since it
cannot be unlawful to spread such information within U. S. it would be
fatuous to forbid its transmission to citizens of a friendly foreign power.
Gourt stated ,"it is enough in the case involved ‘to.hold as.wo a9 that. .+- -
whatever it ‘was levfnl to-broadcest throughout the country, it was “lawful
to send abroad The section is aimed at the substance of the proscribed
information, not at the act of making it more readily available for use."
Based on Heine decision, it appears Government must prove that information
gathered or transmitted is to some degree limited or restricted and not
available to general public.

DEPARTMENTAL INSTRUCTIONS [CUNCLASSIFIED) ]

According to Department, prohibitions in section 793(a) (b) are conditioned
upon suspect having ... the purpose of obtaining information respecting
national defense with intent or reason to believe that it is to be used to
injury of U. S. or advantage of any foreign nation; those in subdivision

(c) require same purpose plus suspect's knowledge or reason to believe that
it will be used contrary to espionage laws; subdivisions (ad) and (e) relate
to suspects who already have possession of or access to information relating
to national defense, either lawfully or unlawfully, which they have reason
to believe could be used to injury of U. S. or to advantage of any foreign
nation, and who willfully transmit it to unauthorized persons or retain it
after demand made by person authorized to receive it (a demand is only
necessary under subdivision (a) where individual has lawful possession - no
demand is necessary under subdivision (@) where person has unauthorized
possession); subdivision (£) applies to suspects who have lawful possession
of national defense information and permit it to be lost or destroyed through
gross negligence or fail to report its loss to proper authorities.

Department has instructed all USAs that its prior authorization is necessary
before instituting prosecutive action in espionage cases, except in emergency
where subject is fugitive or damage may result from delay.

In cases involving photographing violations, Department has advised such
gases can be more expeditiously handled by presenting directly to USA for
preliminary opinion. This does not alter policy of presenting all espionage
cases to Department prior to actual prosecution.

Concerning section 798, Department has advised that classification may be
effected by written directive, or by marking or stamping on item classified;
authorization may be established by written directive or oral testimony.
Decodes of unclassified information are covered by act where it can be proved
they facilitated analysis of cryptographic system.

Department holds that photographing or sketching of outside of commercial
establishment engaged in manufacture of classified military or naval arms

and munitions for U. S. Army, Navy, or Air Force would not constitute violation
of section 795 and/or 797, where no classified equipment or material appears

in photograph or sketch. :

Department has suggested following procedurés when obtaining and returning
photographs taken in violation of section 795: Subject should be requested
to relinquish film, Receipt should be given to subject and signed statement
obtained to effect film is being voluntarily relinquished. Film taken in
connection with section 795 should be submitted to FBI Laboratory for any
necessary processing and should then be submitted to commanding officer of
military post, or other installation, for censorship. If film contains
photographs in violation of section 795, it should be delivered to USA either
directly by commanding officer or through Bureau. 27 O27 [17-62

If prosecution deemed advisable, film should be retained as evidence and not
returned to subject unless, at conclusion of case, USA feels that any innocuous
negatives or prints may be returned. In such event film should be returned

prints therefrom should remain in possession of commanding officer, and
their disposition left to his discretion. Requests for return of film can

ys then.be referred to commanding officer. : :

As to rights of Bureau Agents in carrying out enforcement procedures regarding
violations of sections 795 and 796 by Soviet-bloc diplomatic and official :
personnel, Department advised in summary as follows:

In all instances in which photographs or sketches of defense installations are

made by Soviet-bloc nationals, every reasonable effort should be made to 7
recover and confiscate these items in interest of national security. Where
Soviet-bdloc nationals who have no diplomatic immunity are observed by Bureau

Agents to photograph or sketch military installations in violation of

sections 795 and 796, they may be arrested without warrant and film seized

as evidence. If observation is by person other than Bureau Agent, an arrest

warrant should be procured (because misdemeanor rather than a felony is

involved) and search warrant obtained if premises are involved.

Where Soviet-bloc or other foreign officials who may have diplomatic immunity
are observed taking photographs by Bureau Agents, they may be detained until
Bureau is satisfied they do in fact have immunity and film may be confiscated
in interest of national security, If Agents do not actually observe the
activity but received information from outside source, film may not be legally
seized since warrant of arrest or search may not be lawfully executed against
person or premises having diplomatic immunity.

D. POLICY
{ 1, Responsibilities of FBI[ (UNCLASSIFIED) ]
a. Investigation of violations of espionage and related statutes for
Prosecutive purposes

onsibilitied

By Presidential directive -FBI has counterintealligence responsibilities
which it shares with military intelligence agencies and is also )
charged with correlating information relating to espionage and

making appropriate dissemination, Coordination in domestic inte2ligence

Pield is effected through Interdepartmental Intelligence Conference.

By National Security Council directive, FBI and other U. 8S. intelligence
agencies coordinate foreign and domestic intelligence through U. S.
Intelligence Board. (See section 102A, volume IV, of this manual.)

|: To aid in interpretation of Bureau's policies, following terms are
defined:
(1) Intelligence - obtaining and distributing information required
for formulation and execution of Government policy
(2) Espionage - intelligence activity directed toward acquisition
of information through clandestine operations
(3) Counterintelligence - intelligence activity which is devoted to
destroying effectiveness of inimical foreign intelligence
activities and which is undertaken to protect security of nation,
+ana its personnel, information, and installations, against
espionage, sabotage, and subversion. Counterintelligence
includes process of procuring, developing, recording, and
disseminating information concerning hostile clandestine activity
and of penetrating, manipulating, or repressing individuals,
groups, or organizations conducting or capable of conducting
such activity.
C 2. General objectives| CCONFEBENTEAD) |
Principal goal is providing adequate protection to our national defense.
To achieve this end and discharge our responsibilities, investigations
Should be directed:

” Specific’ ‘objective Fi nan . pe

"a. Development of double agents (persons actively operated by foreign

intelligence organizations but working secretly on behalf of Bureau)

and defectors-in-place

Development of complete intelligence information, i.e.,. identifi

cation of all intelligence personnel; determining targets and ob-

joctives; ascertaining to fullest extent activities and contacts of

intelligence personnel; and development of 211 information necessary |

for protection of national security. {|

ce. When a and b have been achieved, to present case to Department for '

prosecutive opinion, where appropriate

C 4. Opening cases

Following general rules apply to opening of espionage cases:

a. Where specific complaint is received alleging that person is en-
gaged in espionage, together with supporting circumstances to indi-
cate this may be true, case is opened and investigation pursued to
point where, if possible, allegations can be established or disproved,

b. Where nonspecific complaint is received which is vague and indefi-
nite, submit information to Bureau, indicating no further investigation
is being conducted. However, this does not mean that before case is
opened, full or substantial evidence must be on hand. If responsible
sources, published data, confidential informants, double agents, or
any reliable citizen makes allegation which would indicate espionage
activities, careful consideration should be given to matter before
decision is made not to initiate investigation.

ce. Investigation of diplomatic or other foreign official personnel, in-
eluding persons within scope of International Organizations Immunities
Act, should not be instituted without prior Bureau authority. How-
ever, in emergency situations, discreet physical surveillances may be
conducted of such persons apparently acting outside scope of their
authority. In such instances pmo statety advise ce

C 5. Conducting investigations [|

a. Investigations must be complete, thorough, and expeditiously nandiea.
Bureau should be kept currently advised of important developments.
Determine at earliest possible time whether allegations have any pos-
sible basis in fact in order to conserve Agents' time and efforts.

b. Only photographing cases should be presented to USAs for preliminary
prosecutive opinion. Do not contact USAs regarding violations of
other statutes, but submit to Bureau for presentation to Department.

c. FBI Agents may photograph, sketch, or make graphic representations
of military or naval installations or equipment without obtaining
permission from commanding officer or higher authority when request
for investigation has emanated from latter or where urgent nature of
investigation prevents obtaining such permission. In latter instance,
photographs, etc., should be submitted promptly to commanding officer
or higher authority for review.

ad. Pursuant to consultations with Department of State and Department con-
cerning violations of sections 795 and 796 by Soviet-bloc diplomatic
and official personnel, be guided by following instructions:

Executive Order 10104, which defines defense installations covered by
sections 795 and 796, specifies that installations or equipment must

be classified, designated, or marked ... as "Top Secret," "Secret,"
"Confidential," or "Restricted." Arrests or seizure of film or sketches
must not be undertaken unless there is uo doubt that installation or
material photographed or sketched was so classified, designated, or
marked. Specific Bureau authority must be obtained prior to any arrests
of any diplomatic personnel or members of their staffs (including persons
affiliated with embassies, legations, etc., and missions to UN) or
employees of UN Secretariat; or before any seizwre of film or sketches
in their possession. Similar authority should be obtained before any
seizure of film or sketches from other nondiplomatic personnel (rep-
resentatives of Amtorg Trading Corporation, Tass News Agency, etc.)
unless it is apparent that evidence 1l be destroyed, removed, or
delivered to person or place where it would not be susceptible to
seizure before authority can be obtained.

INVESTIGATIVE PROCEDURE [¢szensey]

le.

—tsnerse}+

Interviews [ : '
As general rule, ionage subjects are not inter ed without prior oO

Bureau authority;“iowever, subjects may be interviewed without such author-
ity when it is apparent subject is cognizant of investigation, interview
would not jeopardize investigation, and there is no indication violation
is foreign-inspired. This would include photographing violations. Sub-
jects must not be interviewed at their places of employment or through
arrangements with their employers without prior Bureau authority.

Investigation should be based on premise alleged intelligence officers
and their agents have been thoroughly trained and their activities are
directed by experts. Most successful spy is ordinary~appearing person,
who has established an excellent “cover" for his activities.
Principal goal is providing adequate protection to national defense. Cer-
tain counterintelligence measures frequently will be more desirable than
immediate apprehension and prosecution. It may be desirable to permit
subject to remain at large, whereby continuing surveillance may disclose
information as to his associates, targets, or accomplices. Every pre-
caution must be used to prevent subject from becoming aware of our investi-
gation.
Climax of any espionage case is actual transmittal or disclosure of infor-
mation affecting national defense to foreign government or its representa~
tive. Investigations should be conducted with view to determining as soon
as possible actual method by which information involved is being transmitted
to foreign government or its representative. It may become necessary in
some instances to make an arrest to prevent transmission of classified in-
formation known to be in possession of a subject or to prevent his escape -
with information,
Although not all-inclusive, following investigative steps should be con-
sidered:
a. Ascertain complete background and activities if possible including:
residences; employment; associates; citizenship status, including date
and place of birth; credit and arrest checks, including subversive
police records; check of pertinent Government agencies' files; check
of public source materials; photograph ana physical description; iden-
tifying information as to any automobile involved. :
bd. Discreet physical surveillance, keeping in mind surveillance may be
" mecessary over long pe: cL timc. Obtain ploiigraphs, irneLuding
motion-pictures, whenever possible, particularly of espionage meets.
c. Development of sources of information, confidential informants, double
agents, and defectors-in-place
These may be secured through discreet contact with neighbors, friends,
business acquaintances, or accomplices. Make every effort to corrob-
orate conversations between informants or double agents and subject
in order that admissible evidence may be available to corroborate in-
formant or double agent. Make sure latter interprets instructions
correctly and have such instructions properly recorded.
d. <Ascertain method and nature of communications, including mail drops,
through:
(1) Check of communication company records. Facilities of these
companies should be used whenever possible and appropriate.
(2) Use ot highly confidential techniques. This is very important
and should be considered whenever security is assured. .
e. Ascertain financial status through:
{3 Credit checks
2) Check of bank records. When bank account is located, it should
be monitored and all sources of revenue fully explored.
f. Ascertain identity and purpose of all contacts through coverage as
outlined above. Also consider:

will be used and, as this excludes nearly 411 chemical tests, .examina-
tion may not be successful,

h. When questionable material is. obtained during investigation, forward
to Laboratory for examination, Also, when technical equipment needed
and not available to field, make inquiry of Laboratory.

i. Bureaw must be apprised of contents of all papers, documents, codes,
plans, blueprints, etc., in subject's possession and no opportunity
should be overlocked to examine his effects. Whenever'such material
consists of items of possible military, naval, or diplomatic signif~
icance or subject is known to be aware of such information, advise
Bureau immediately.

J. If subject travels abroad, consider checking Customs' records and

having his baggage examined by Customs. Also consider requesting CIA
to cover activities abroad.

k. When thorough investigation has been made, consider recommending inter-
view of subject. If interview authorized, consider obtaining waivers
of search to permit search of subject's residence and other premises
under his control.

2, Recommendations should be submitted to Bureau relative to placing

- subject's name on administrative index in accordance with section 87,
volume III, of this manual,

5. When interviews are conducted with person who has admitted being con-
nected with a foreign intelligence service, cover following points:
ae All information pertaining to organization and operation of intelligence

service with which he is connected, including setup of files section and

how their material is coordinated.
fac, descriptions, and cover names of a13
(both legals and illegals), co-opted workers, illegal agen S, and agents,
particularly those sent to U. S. by that intelligence service; who
trained them; how they were trained; what was their mission; in which
section of U. S. they were to operate; how they were to come to U. Se3
under what name they entered U. S.; whether subject knows of any infor-
mation having been furnished by them to his intelligence service; if so,
nature of information, how they obtained it, how they communicated it,
how they were paid, for what period they were active, and when was last
y time they were active.
ec. Where lists of names are found upon subject, obtain all identifying
information concerning persons listed and determine whether such are
merely social acquaintances or are of espionage significance.
a. locations of all training centers of intelligence service, both in
‘ home country and elsewhere, as well as identities and descriptions of
personnel connected with these centers.
e. Information concerning uses of mail drops in this country or in for-
eign countries,
6. Where members of foreign intelligence services offer their services as
defectors or defectors-in-place, they should be questioned thoroughly as
to their motives. Make certain they obtain no information concerning
Bureau which would be of value to foreign intelligence service since it
is known practice of intelligence services to plant person within opposing
intelligence service, and make every effort to check on latter possibility.
7. Codes, ciphers, secret writing, and methods of concealment
a. There is definite difference between a cipher and a code, aA cipher is
made by using individual letters of message as units. This may be
done either by substituting numbers, symbols, or other letters for
original letters in message; or by rearranging order of letters in
message, Ciphers obtained by first method are called substitution
ciphers and latter are called transposition ciphers.

b. Codes are constructed by replacing original words, phrases, or sentences
of message by code words. Because of regulations governing messages

| book which may contain as many as one hundred thousand or more code
.Words. or number gropps. Dictionaries are often used as code books.
dinars ly cede :messages.cannot be, ‘decoded without use of code book.
c. Frequent use has been made of books for setting up key to cipher.
"Best sellers" have been used as their possession does not arouse
suspicion. In making searches keep this possibility in mind. Com-
munication with foreign countries is frequently accomplished by
shortwave radio or secret writing in correspondence or by microdots.
While some types of secret writing may be detected with naked eye,
there are methods with invisible inks that cannot be detected with-
out extensive laboratory examination. When submitting codes or ci-
phers to Laboratory for examination, any collateral information which
might be of aid to solving code or cipher should be noted in cover
letter,
s, 8. Missing classified documents and disclosure of classified data (See
section 20F, volume II, of this manual.)
a. Whese cases generally are referred by other Government agencies.

(1) When documents are reported missing, referring agency should
advise why matter was referred and field should confirm receipt
in writing and state whether or not investigation is being
conducted,

(2) No investigation should be made of administrative misplacement,

. misfiling, or loss of documents in transmission. Do not investi-
gate if referral by other agencies has been delayed unreasonably;
advise Bureau promptly of facts, including reason for delay.

(3) Investigate where there is indication of loss or compromise
through gross negligence. However, locating missing documents is
administrative function of agency having security responsibility
for such material and no search for missing documents should be

: conducted for other agencies without Bureau approval.

(4) Investigate where there is theft, disclosure, or compromise with
intent to aid foreign power or injure U. S. or with reason to
believe this would result. z

(5) Advise Bureau promptly of cases of widespread interest, probable
publicity, or where classified information is of great strategic
importance.

b. Investigative steps - determine:

L Circumstances surrounding loss, disclosure, or compromise

2 Whether person disclosing information knew it was classified and
also knew person to whom information disclosed was not authorized
to receive it

3 Exact classified information involved

4 Its classification and significance to national defense (i.e.

would its disclosure to unauthorized persons injure U. S., or aid
a@ foreign power), and identities of competent persons who can so
testify

5 Whether information can be declassified for purposes of prosecution

6) Evidence of requisite intent or gross negligence (i.e., associa-

-tions with foreign officials; clandestine conspiratorial meetings;
evidence subject had been given security briefings or was aware

of security regulations; utter disregard of such regulations;
excessive carelessness or imprudent handling of classified infor-
mation, etc.), Where preliminary inquiries show requisite intent
did not exist or there was no gross negligence, discontinue and
submit closing communication.

ce. Where there is no indication cf foreign-directed espionage but requisite

intent or gross negligence does exist, early interview of subject is
generally desirable, at which time signed statement should be requested.
Conduct investigation to corroborate admissions,

SOVIET INTELLIGENCE FUNCTIONAL FILES [ (UNCLASSIFIED) ]

These files were set up to correlate information concerning methods of opera=
tion and organizational structure of Soviet intelligence services. They con-
tain information secured by field and FBIHQ through investigations and interviews
and from other U. S. and foreign intelligence and security servicés.

Included are a breakdown of Soviet intelligence services, methods of recruit-
‘ment, training, communications, payments, travel and entry, security precau~
tions, cover stories, targets, and modus operandi.

They should be thoroughly reviewed by all Special Agents engaged in counter-
espionage and counterintelligence investigations. New material received at
FBIHQ is forwarded to field for inclusion in these files; hence, Special
Agents engaged in counterespionage and counterintelligence investigations
should review this material periodically.

CURRENT ESPIONAGE DIGEST [ (UNCLASSIFIED) ]
Summaries of new techniques, methods, policies, etc., of communist intelligence
services are prepared at FBIHQ for distribution to all offices. .

1. Issues should be reviewed by all Special Agents handling counterespionage
ana counterinteisigence investigations.

2 Be alert to recommend pertinent items of significance.

3. File should be maintained under custody of SAC with same security as
Classification 134 files. Issues of lasting training and educational
value, however, should be permanently charged out and securely maintained
by supervisor responsible for counterespionage and counterintelligence
investigations in location accessible to involved SAs. (Legal Attaches
should destroy each issue when read.)

Bad- *. "dot... SEorron 84, REGISTRATION ACT

Although Bureau @ been authorized to examine so S and ¥ecords of
_ registered agents, no such examination should be at Pap eee except
. upon specific Bureau authority. .

Diphomatig and’ consular officens are. exempt from registra n

‘as their activities. are recognized by Department of State as proper
for such official. No investigation of diplomatic pr consular officers
is to be conducted without prior Bureau authority. When activities

are noted, which would seem to be outside regular activities of official

in question, advise Bureau promptly s6 that inquiry may be made of

: State Department to determine exactly what official's status and scope
of action are.
Investigative procedure
, & When it is desired to check whether subject is registered or, if
registered, to secure a copy of his registration statement, direct
lead to WFO.
1b. Suggestions for investigation are being broken down by elements of
principal violation. They are not all-inclusive but do represent type
of inquiry most uniformly productive in previous cases. Investigations
F i should be directed toward obtaining evidence that subject:

{1) Was an agent, or held himself out to be an agent, of foreign
principal
In addition to general suggestions set forth in section B, item
3a, above, special attention must be given those agents engaged
in propaganda activities.

(a) cone subject's printer or publisher, if reliable, and
btain copies of manuscripts, orders for printing, bills
‘pendered and receipts, and copies of publications.

C (bd) Interview appropriate [postal service Jauthorities to determine
if subject holds second-class mailing permit and for infor-
mation regarding quantity of his outgoing mail.

by enkiack.

tained from lecture bureaus, newspaper morgues, interviews

able time prior to date set for trial, request Bureau to

z obtain name and title of representative of Attorney General
who should be subpoenaed.
(3) Statute provides that in any proceeding under this act when foreign
principal is located outside U. S. evidence of specific identity
- of foreign principal will not have to be produced.
4, Miscellaneous
This act requires registration of persons accepting compensation from
foreign principal or actifig in U. S. on orders, instructions, or request
of foreign principal. Thus, agent of foreign principal engaged in send-
ing propaganda from U. S. to foreign countries could be required to
register. This interpretation is based on legislative history of statute.

5. Statute of limitations

Title 22, USC, § 612, provides: "The obligation of an agent of a foreign
princi pai to file a registration statement shall, after the tenth day of
his becoming such agent, continue from day to day, and termination of

C. VENUE
In judicial district where illegal act committed. Venue in conspiracy

violations in any judicial district where the conspiracy was entered into
or overt act occurs.

D. POLICY 7
1. Cases to be investigated ui

a. Specific complaint with prima facie evidence that act of sabotage
has been committed.

b. Information that actual or potential saboteurs are at large in the
U.S.

c. Specific request from one of the military services for FBI in- 7 4
vestigation of 2 definite allegation of sabotage even though the
case is within the investigative jurisdiction of[Air Force, Army, or
NavyJunder the Delimitations Agreement. The intelligence agency
with investigative jurisdiction under the Delimitations Agreement
must be agreeable to the FBI conducting the investigation and the
‘request must be made promptly after the incident occurs and without

: prior investigation by another agency,

a. If inquiry through local officials or other informed sources reveals
eause of incident and eliminates possibility of sabotage, no in~ _
vestigation is necessary. Keep in mind in this connection that a
saboteur may be expected to attempt to disguise his work as an
accident where feasible.

e. Instances of willful damage to or destruction of aircraft in inter-

“ state, overseas, or foreign air commerce are investigated under
destruction of aircraft or motor vehicles statutes, but bear in mind
sabotage violation coulda be involved. (See section 117, volume IV,
of this manual.)

2. Alleged plots of sabotage

a. Information is frequently received indicating an act of sabotage
will be committed. It is often impossible to cheok the source or
acouracy of such information. Take the following action immediately:
{1) Advise Bureau by teletype.

(2) Advise local representatives of{Air Force, Army, and Navy in-
telligence agencies; ]local police; and officials of plant,
facility, or utility involved.

(3) Conduct any logical investigation to ascertain basis for report.

b. In disseminating information regarding an alleged plot of sabotage,
the circumstances surrounding the receipt of the report should be
outlined and the facts allowed to speak for themselves. Do not
attempt to evaluate the information for other agencies and specifi-
cally advise them no evaluation has been made.

of sedition statutes, Department of Justice has designated following
of statements as being within prohibition of statutes:

7 a. False statements of fact in time of war intended to interfere wit

the prosecution of war
\ b. Utterances in time of war which cause or attempt to cause insubordi~

ty

\ nation in armed forces
\ ~e.° Utterances which have the direct effect of obstructing enlistment
| or the operation of the draft
a a. Advooacy of armed reyolt or overthrow of Government by force and |
violence
\ 2. Above types of utterances not considered all-inclusive of possibilities
i presented by sedition statutes but only guides

POLICY
(i Department of Justice has advised that USAs are not to authorize pyosecu~
tion without prior departmental authority in each individual case;/therero
no request should be mide of USA for institution of prosecution. [Depar
has instructed, however, that in all cases involving sedition in which
facts justify consideration copies of reports should be designated for the
— office of interested USA.]
[2- Copies of reports will be referred to Department by Bureau for decisions
.- relative to prosecution, /Should the USA authorize prosecution, proceed
in accordance with his imstructions since it is presumed he will have Hi
complied and obtained prior authorization, Where such proseoutive
action is authorized by a local USA and no advice from Bureau has been
received indicating knowledge that this action has been approved ty
the Department, immediately advise by telephone or teletype of acts
taken, In order for Bureau to properly discharge its obligation te
investigate all cases involving the distribution of seditious
literature and be aware of all such publications, make necessory 1
arrangements to be advised of all publications in your district whe

might be considered seditious, Within 24 hours after seditious article
reaches general public, each field office must prepare teletype summary
of article for Bureau which must be followed by two copies of publica—
tion in which it appeared, Such articles will be of type which reflect
race prejudice, anti-Semitism and material tending to cause disunity.
Cover all meetings of organizations engaged in seditious activities

and bring to attention of Bureau statements of seditious nature

or having propaganda significance by most expeditious means warranted,

» INVESTIGATIVE PROCEDURE

NW 65360 Docld:32989654 Page 70

General

a. Ascertain whether persons involved are civilian or uniformed
personnel of Army, Navy or Air Force,

be Ascertain whether offense occurred on military or naval establishment,
reservation, base, field, port or harbor, under jurisdiction of Army,
Navy or Air Force or on merchant vessel commissioned in Navy or
in service of Army or Navy.

co. If so, communicate facts to proper official of Army or Navy or Air
Porce and conduct no investigation until a request is received through
proper channels,

ad. General investigation should seek to establish identity and location

of all witnesses, All persons present when words spoken should be

interviewed immediately and made matter of record before lapse of

time may impair effectiveness and probative value of their testimony.

e. Important to establish in greatest detail factual setting in which
language was used since necessary part of proof in sedition case.

f. If member of armed forces present, ascertain name, address, rank,
branch of service and serial number. If men having obligations
under Selective Service Act present, ascertain locality, birth
and selective service status of each such witness in addition to
otner idenviiieble infuimatiun. Stecacces
determine whether or not speaker was aware of presence of member of
armed forces or persons having obligation under draft laws,

g. If speech was public in nature and delivered to audience, ascertain
in detail circumstances under which made. Inquiry should establish
whether speech was delivered extemporaneously or from prepared
soript. Inquiry should include date, time and place of occurrence,
as well as chronology of events leading up to utterance of
seditious statements: Ascertain age, sanity, sobriety and general

, demeanor of speaker, Manner in which words spoken has important

bearing on speaker's intent and must be clearly established before
facts will warrant prosecution, Determine if words addressed
generally to 211 persons within sound of speaker's voice, were
spoken without prompting or in response to a question and determine
whether words expressed in a deliberate manner or in temperamental
outburst.

h. Witnesses should be asked to evaluate effect of language upon
persons addressed. Inquire whether result of words was to arouse
patriotic ardor of listeners or whether its effect was demoralizing.

i.e Determine whether alleged seditious words have been repeated by
other persons since they were first uttered and with what results.

je. Bear in mind possibility that this investigation may uncover other
violations of existing statutes, such as failure to comply with
postal regulations, income tax or registration law requirements.

Written or printed words

a. Investigation of seditious statements appearing in written or
printed material should include inquiries extending beyond analysis
and examination of alleged seditious expressions themselves.

be If statements appear in a publication regularly issued, obtain
copies of the publication circulated before and after issue in
question and analyze from standpoint of ascertaining its seditious
content and establishing criminal intent of prospective defendants,

©. Analysis of seditious statements should seek to determine whether
statements are in fact original or plagiarized reproduction or
quotation from other sources.



NW 65360 Docld:32989654 Page 71

In some cases, it may be necessary to examine content of each issue
for a period of several months to develop seditious character of
publication. ‘In such cases, analysis of any one issue may fail to
disclose clearly seditious statements, whereas quantitative analysis
of number of issues may establish constant emphasis and frequent
repetition of same themes, Half—truths, continual slanting of facts,
habitual dishonest presentation and interpretation of world and
national events are cumulative in effect and may be seditious as a
matter of-law., Efforts should be made to establish repetition

of same themes and same treatment of them in number of issues,
Completely identify group or organization responsible for authorship,
printing, and publication of printed or written material in question.
Inquiry should not overlook possible collaboration, sponsorship,
support, and financial assistance of outside individuals and other
organizations. Consider possibility of subsidy and influence

by foreign sources. Inquiry concerning foreign travel by principals
involved in investigation should be made and circumstances under
which travel undertaken fully developed.

Examine books of account, financial statements, and credit reports

of individual or organization under investigaticn, as well as
organization records having to do with membership, dues, contributions,
and correspondence. 7

Deleted :
fake steps to locate and obtain records of printer as soon as possible.
Printer's complete job envelope should be obtained and rough drafts
and corrected drafts of printed material examined. Drafts may

assist in establishing actual authorship of article, collaboration

of others in its preparation, and that printed article is true
reproduction of material submitted to printer.

Examine mailing list or other compilation of names of persons to whom
seditious material addressed or distributed. Ascertain manner in 7
which list was compiled and source from which names obtained.
Determine who is responsible for distribution of publications and
whether intended to reach particular group, such as persons engaged

in national defense industries. Ascertain whether persons responsible
for circulation made any special efforts to distribute material among
members of armed forces, or persons having obligations under Selective
Service Act or relatives of such persons.

Proof that publication reached specific identified members of above
groups will aid in establishing that substantive evils which law seeks
to prevent have resulted. 7

Under first offense defined in Title 18, USC, § 2388, dealing

with false reports or statements courts have held not necessary to
prove such false reports or statements were made to persons who are

or are liable to become members of the military forces.

With reference to mailing lists, efforts should be made to determine
whether issues of publication distributed to persons outside U. S.
Determine if such publication exchanges mailing list or material

with other suspect publications,

Determine if persons receiving publication are paying or nonpaying
subsoribers.

Large cities have legitimate concerns engaged in business of compiling
mailing lists of particular or selected groups for advertising and other
purposes. Inquiry should be made of such concerns to determine whether
suspected individuals or organizations contracted for preparation of

a mailing list.

Determine from(U. S. Postal Service Jwhether prospective defendants
have been granted second-class or other mailing privileges in connec—
tion with circulation of material under investigation. If privilege
was granted, examine statements filed with Postmaster General concerning
ownership, editorial control and circulation.

B. STEP TAKEN BY COMMUNIST PARTY, USA, TO AVOID PROSECUTION UNDER THIS ACT
The Communist Party, USA, held a special convention in New York City on
November 16 to 17, 1940, This convention declared “that the Communist Party
of the USA in convention assembled, does hereby cancel and dissolve its organi~
gational affiliation with the Communist International, as well as any ana all
other bodies of any kind outside the boundaries of the United States of America
for the specific purpose of removing itself from the terms of the so-called

.

Voorhis Act."

{C, DEPARTMENTAL POLICY

{In 1941, the Department considered holding grand jury hearings under this
act at which leading Communist Party functionaries would be subpoenaed,
The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor stopped any action in this regard.
When proseoutive action was initiated against the Communist Party and its
top functionaries beginning in 1948, the Department selected the Smith
Aot of 1940 (Title 16, USC, § 2385) and the Internal Security Act of 1950
(title 50, usc, §§ 78i-e16} rether than the Voorhis Act. J

D. VENUE
Where the violation is the failure to register, venue will lie only in the
District of Columbia; however, aiders and abettors may be prosecuted in the
district in which their criminal acts are performed, and conspiracy charges
may be prosecuted in the district in which the conspiracy originates, or in
which any overt act thereunder takes place.

--) fulfillment of Departmental instructions.

There are three principal statutes which provide a basis for these

investigations, as follows:

(1) Rebellion or insurrection (T18, USC, §2383)
"Whoever incites, sets on foot, assists, or engages in any
rebellion or insurrection against the authority of the United
States or the laws thereof, or gives aid or comfort thereto,

than ten years, or both; and shall be incapable of holding
any office under the United States.”

(2) Seditious conspiracy (T18, USC, §2384)
“If two or more persons in any State or Territory, or in any

place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, conspire
to overthrow, put down, or to destroy by force the Government
ot the United States, or to ievy war againsi tiem, us tu upuoc
by force the authority thereof, or by force to prevent, hinder,
or delay the execution of any law of the United States, or by
force to seize, take, or possess any property of the United States
contrary to the authority thereof, they shall each be fined not
more than $20,000 or imprisoned not more than twenty years,
ox both."

‘ overthrowing or destroying the government of the United States
or the government of any State, Territory, District or Possess-
ion thereof, or the government of any political subdivision
: therein, by force or violence, or by the assassination of any

officer of any such government; or
“Whoever, with intent to cause the overthrow or destruction

of any such government, prints, publishes, edits, issues,
circulates, sells, distributes, or publicly displays any
written or printed matter advocating, advising, or teaching

the duty, necessity, desirability, or propriety of overthrowing
or destroying any government in the United States by force or

Prosecutive Determination

A1L discussions pertaining to the. “prosecutive potential of investi-

gations initiated under this section will be conducted by FBIHQ with

Departmental officials, These cases should not be discussed with

local U. S, Attorney's office without FBIHQ approval.

Related Statutes

There are a number of other statutes under the FBI's investigative

jurisdiction which should be borne in mind in handling these investi-

gations. Information concerning possible violations of such statutes

is frequently developed during these investigations. Where this

occurs, the field should consider the desirability of conducting

investigation in line with the policies and procedures governing the

statute in question.

A List of other Federal statutes which may arise during these investi-
gations is outlined in Subsection 9 of this section.

FBI Responsibility

The FBI has been charged by various Presidents with the’ responsi-~
bility to coordinate and collect all information relating to the
internal security of the United States, including information from

all other Federal and local agencies. See Section 102, Volume IV
