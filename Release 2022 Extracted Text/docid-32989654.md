fulfillment of Departmental instructions.

There are three principal statutes which provide a basis for these

investigations, as follows:

Rebellion

"Whoever incites, sets on foot, assists

or engages in any rebellion

of insurrection against the authority of the United States or the

laws thereot, or gives aid or comfort thereto, shall be fined not

"If two or more persons conspire to commit' any offerse named in this

section, each shall be fined not more than $20,000 or imprisoned

include

recruiting of

new members, the forming of new units,

and the regroup-

ing or expansion of existing clubs

The courts have interpreted this statute to require advocacy to

action, 1.e.,

advocacy

to do something, now or in the future, rather

than merely to believe in something.

In addition to the three principal statutes outlined above, there

. are two other statutes which might provide a statutory foundation for

an investigation under this section.

These are:

d. [Internal

security Act of 1950 (I 50, USC, § 783a)

In addition to the three

principal statutes outlined in sub-

paragraphs a., bo, and co,

Internal Security Act could

provide a statutory basis for investigation of certain cases

under this Section.

This Act makes it unlawiul to knowingly

contribute to the establishment of a totalitarian dictatorship

within the United States which 1s controlled by a foreig

government, organization, or individual..

20

Prosecutive determination

All discussions pertaining to the prosecutive potential of investigations

initiated under this section will be conducted by

FBIHQ with Departmental

officials.

These cases should not be discussed with local U. S. Attorney's

3

office without FBIHQ approval.

Related statutes

*. There are a number of other statutes under the FBI's investigative

jurisdiction which should be borne in mind in handling

these

investigations.

Information concerning possibie violations of such statutes is frequently

developed during these investigations.

Where this occurs the field should

consider the desirability of conducting investigation in line with the

policies and procedures governing the statute in question.

A list of other Federal statutes which may arise during these investigations

4.

is outlined in an appendix

to this manual.

Definitions

The term "subversive activities" as used in this section denotes

activities which are aimed at overthrowing

destroying or undermining the

Government of the United States or any of its political subdivisions b

the illegal means prohibited by statutes enumerated in A. 1o above. The

term "'subversive organization" or "'subversive movement" denotes a group

as defined above.

5. Predication for investigation

In all cases handled under the provisions of this section, the Ilist

communication prepared for outside dissemination (report or LHM) should

show specifically the statute upon which the investigation is based

together with necessary supporting facts. Where investigation has been

specifically requested by Department, this should be indicated.

following examples are illustrative; however, the basis for each

individual case

must be tailored to

the circumstances of such case.

"This investigation is based on information that the subject's

activities could involve violation of T 18, USC, 8 2383 (Rebellion

or Insurrection), and $ 2384 (Seditious Conspiracy).

A source

reliability has not been determined has informed that the subject

is planning, along with others, to

travel to Washington, D. C.

during the first week in May, 1971, to 'shut down the Government.'

1971, to participate in planned violent demonstrations

Demonstration plans include

the blocking of streets and highways,

destruction of personal and Government property, and physical

obstruction to prevent Government employees from reporting to work."

investigation is based

on information that the subject's

activities couid involve a violation of I 18, USC, § 2385 (Advocating

the overthrow of the Government) The subject is

an admitted member

(or has beén identified as a member by a confidential source who

has provided reliable information in the past) of (name of group).

The (name of group) in its public statements and publications

advocates the desirability and necessity of overthrowing

the U. S.

Government by force or violence, and the assassination of U. S.

Government officers.

The same source has reported that the subject

actively supports these positions."

the first intra-Bureau communication prepared which

where possible investigation is being|conducted]should specifically

indicates that

indicate the statutory basis for the investigation. However,

may

be occasions involving individuals or groups in contact with known

subversive elements where the purpose of the contact is not initially

known

and where a preliminary inquiry must be made to determine

whether a statutory basis exists for full investigation.

In these

instances, a preliminary inquiry may be undertaken, through estab-

11 shed

sources, for a period not to exceed 90 days, without specifically

indicating the

specific statutory basis for the inquiry.

If after the

conclusion of 90 days it has not been possible to establish a

statutory basis but further inquiry appears necessary, FBIHQ must

be furnished a succinct summary of the facts by letter together with

specific recommendations

as to further action.

In all cases? Of

course, investigations must be based on indications that subject

may be

engaged in subversive activity, whether or not a specific

statutory basis is cited.

In the event preliminary inquiries fail to establish a sound basis

for investigation, the case should

be promptly closed and there is.

no need to advise FBIHQ (unless FBIHQ has been previously advised

of the inquiry).

Nor is there any need to prepare an LHM or report

where no pertinent subversive derogatory information has been developed.

If the statutory basis for an investigation should change or be

expanded to include an additional statute or statutes, the first

communication prepared subsequent to such change or expansion should

specifically

show such changes.

Similarly, this information should

be included in the next

report or LHM prepared in the case.

Channeling information to case files

„Memoranda regarding membership or activity in subversive organiza-

including summaries of informant reports, should be

channeled to case

files of individuals involved.

When informa-

from informants or surveillances is channeled to individual

case files, it should be documented.

When preparing lengthy channeling memoranda reporting material of

interest to other offices, limit number of copies prepared to

two for each other office.

Clearly indicate next to. names of

other offices the page number containing information of interest

and note on cover page that distribution of material to individual

case files should be handled by recipient offices.

Movement of subjects between offices

If office of origin receives information that subject of current or

past investigation changes residence to territory of another division,

office of origin request verification within 30 days. If new residence

confirmed, office of origin submit FD-128 to transfer origin.

Office

of origin

should furnish new office with any pertinent subversive data

which has not previously been reported in a form suitable for dissemina- .

tion, or suitable for incorporation in an LHM or report..

Destruction of Channeling Memoranda

At the option of appropriate field supervisors, in order to avoid the

accumulation of channeling memoranda in a case file as well as to

facilitate the subsequent preparation of LIMs or reports, the following

procedure may be used:

Files may be reopened for preparation of an

"investigative insert" for later inclusion in a LFM or report, using

T symbols identifying informants who have furnished prior information.

Agent preparing this insert should also prepare a cover memorandum

showing what serials in the file have been covered by his review and

also identifying all symbol number informants involved and indicating

the location of the original data (similar to documentation in the

cover pages of a report The channeling memoranda covered in the

review can then be destroyed and the "investigative insert" along with

its cover memorandum can, if necessary, be forwarded to another field

E. ADMINISTRATIVE INDEX (ADEX)

• 1. Purpose and general policy

To have a readily available and up-to-date listing of individuals

deemed currently dangerous to the national security.

Objective is to

identify individuals who should be afforded priority investigative

coverage in the event of a national emergency•

b. Under no circumstance should individuals be included in ADEX merely

ecause of their opposition to Government policies or because of the

xercise of their constitutional rights of protest and dissent.

c. ADEX is strictly an administrative device.

It should not be treated

as a factor in determining basic investigative decisions, 1.e•,

whether an investigation should be opened or closed, the extent of

investigation to be conducted in a particular case, etc.

2. Criteria

a. ADEX should include individuals whose actions or statements have

established that they represent a current threat to the national

security,

1.l.,:

Individuals whether affiliated with

organized groups or not) who

have shown a willingness and capability of engaging in treason,

ebellion or insurrection

guerrilla warfare, assassination of

such acts which would result in interference with or a threat to

the survival and effective operation of national, state or local

government.

Individuals should be considered a "current threat" to the national

sible reactivation on ADEX. Whether or not a stop can be placed,

necessary administrative procedure should be set up so that sub~

If case is not pending, it should be placed in a pending inactive

rather than closed status. If a subject under investigation appears

to qualify for ADEX but is under sentence for over two years as de~

scribed above, do not recommend for ADEX but follow procedures

described above to consider for ADEX upon release from imprisonment.

Sentences which permit releases in less than two years should be ignored

as a factor in considering ADEX status.

These guidelines are for

application only as to ADEX status and have no bearing on whether or

not subjects should be investigated. For those cases in a closed

status at time these new guidelines

become effective, they should be

brought in line with the

ADEX should not include individuals who may be ideologically committed

to a philosophy which calls for the downfall of our form of government

or which favors another form of society but who have not shown a current

willingness or capability of engaging in meaningful action to promote

their beliefs.

This might apply, for example, to rank-and-file members

of the Socialist Workers Party or the Communist Party, USA, or other

old-line revolutionary groups which have advocated an overthrow of

our present form of government but where subject's activity is

primarily ideological in nature and not oriented toward action. Each

case should be reviewed on an individual basis in the light of

criteria enumerated above.

C. CRIMINAL INTELLIGENCE - ORGANIZED CRIME

Where matters of a criminal intelligence nature or organized crime are

concerned, investigations are conducted to develoy and maintain current

organized crime in general, and to develop

substantive cases against individual racket figures.

These investigations

are highly selective and

are concentrated on the leaders of organized crime

and their reported associates.

Any electronic surveillance used in these

investigations requires approval of the Bureau, the Attorney General, and

authorization by a court order.

D. APPLICANT-TYPE MATTERS

In the area of applicant investigations, specific standards have been

established to protect

the rights of individuals.

All relevant information,

both favorable

and unfavorable, obtained concerning an individual must be

duly reported; investigation is limited to checks of pertinent records and

interviews of

persons in a position to furnish relevant information; persons

furnishing derogatory information are requested to furnish a signed statement.

The FBI makes no evaluation or recommendation to the requesting agency

concerning the applicant.

PREFACE.

GUIDELINES FOR FBI INVESTIGATIONS

[E.

GENERAL CRIMINAL AND CIVIN

MATTERS

L

Our investigative jurisdiction in criminal cases is based on speciiic

violations of Federal laws.

Investigations are conducted when information

is received indicating a violation of a Federal law, over which we have been

given investigative jurisdiction, has occurred.

Results of our investigations

are furnished

to United States Attorneys or the Department of Justice for

determination of the course of any prosecutive action.

The decision may be

present the case to a Federal Grand Jury

if the facts so justily,

to arrest the subject, in which latter instance

arrest is made on the

basis of authorized prosecution and the issuance of a warrant.

Upon arrest,

the subject must be brought before the nearest United States Magistrate or

Federal Judge in accordance with established rules of Federal criminal

procedure.

[

Requests for FBI investigations in selected civil matters in which the United

States is or may be a party in interest

are received from the United States

Attorneys and/or the Department of Justice.

These are handled in strict

conformity with guidelines furnished by the Department of Justice, as are also

investigations of violations of the civil rights, antiriot, election laws,

and antitrust laws.

IF. GENERAL PRINCIPLES

In addition to these principles, numerous other restrictions apply to a11

phases of our work.

For example, our authority to arrest fugitives is

1

statutory.

The United States Code empowers Special Agents to make arrests

and carry firearms but FBI policy further requires that only that force may

L

be used which is necessary to effect arrest with due regard being observed

for the safety of the arresting officers and others.

I

'Special Agents are not permitted to shoot anyone except in self-detense.

No surveillances are conducted in the White House, the Capitol, the Supreme

Jourt, or the House and Senate Office Buildings.

No surveillance, electronic

or otherwise, may be instituted on any member of Congress, any Justice or

Judge, or any principal functionary of the Executive

Agents may not engage in entrapment or any other improper, illegal, or

Our Special

unethical tactics in procuring information or evidence; any critical

complaints concerning FBI personnel must be thoroughly investigated; any

testimony by a Special Agent in court must be given clearly and without bias

or embellishment.

The

foregoing is a general statement of guidelines for FBI investigations.

All investigative personnel must follow these rules.

According to Department, prohibitions in

section 793(a) (b) are conditioned

upon suspect having

national defense with intent

or reason to believe

that it is to be used to

injury of U.S. or advantage of any foreign nation; those in subdivision

(c) requira

same purpose plus suspect's knowledge

it will be used contrary to espionage laws; subdivisions (a) and (e) relate

to suspects who already have possession of

or access to information relating

to national defense, either lawfully or

unlawfully, which they have reason

to believe could be

used to injury of U.S. or to advantage of any foreign

nation, and who willfully transmit it to unauthorized persons or retain it

after demand made by person authorized to receive it a demand is only

necessary under subdivision (a) where individual has lawful possession no

is necessary under

subdivision (e) where person has unauthorized

possession); subdivision (I) applies to suspects who have lawful possession

of national defense information and permit it to be lost or destroyed through

gross negligence or fail to report its loss to proper authorities.

Department has instructed all USAs that its prior authorization is necessary

before instituting prosecutive action

in espionage cases, except in emergency

subiect is fueitive or damade may result from delay.

In cases involving photographing violations, Department has advised such

can be more expeditiously handled by presenting directly to USA for

preliminary opinion.

This does not alter policy of presenting all espionage

cases to Department prior to actual prosecution.

Concerning section 798, Department has advised that classification may be

effected by written directive, or by marking or stamping on item classified;

authorization may be established by written directive or oral testimony.

Decodes of unclassified information are covered by act where it can be

they facilitated analysis of cryptographic system.

Department holds that photographing or sketching of outside of commercial

establishment engaged in manufacture of classified military or naval arms

and munitions Ior U.S. Army, Navy, or Air Force would not constitute violation

of section 795 and/ or 797, where no classified equipment or material appears

in photograph or sketch.

Department has suggested following procedurés when obtaining and returning

photographs taken in violation of section 795:

Subject should be requested

to relinquish film.

Receipt should be given to subject and signed statement

obtained to effect

film is being voluntarily relinquished.

section 795 should be submitted to FBI laboratory for any

necessary processing and should then be submitted to commanding officer of

military post, or other installation, for

censorship. If film contains

photographs in violation of section 795, it should be delivered to USA either

directly by commanding officer or through Bureau. 24.02 117-42

It prosecution deemed advisable, film should be retained as evidence and not

returned to subject unless, at

conclusion of case, USA feels that any innocuous

negatives or prints may be

returned. In such event film should be returned

As to rights of Bureau Agents in carrying out enforcement procedures regarding

violations

of sections 795 and 796 by Soviet-bloc diplomatic and official

personnel, Department advised in summary as follows:

In all instances in which photographs or sketches

of defense installations

are

made by soviet-bloc nationals,

every reasonable effort should be made to

recover and confiscate these items in interest of national security.

Soviet-bloc nationals who have no diplomatic immunity are observed by Bureau

Agents to photograph or sketch military installations in violation of

sections 795 and 796, they may be arrested without warrant and film seized

as evidence.

If observation is by person other than Bureau Agent, an arrest

warrant should be procured (because misdemeanor rather than a felony is

invoived) and search warrant obtained if premises are involved.

Where Soviet-bloc or other foreign officials who may have diplomatic immunity

are observed taking photographs by Bureau Agents, they may be detained until

Bureau is satisfied they do in fact have immunity and film may be confiscated

in interest of national security.

If Agents do not actually observe the

activity but received information from outside source, film may not be legally

seized since warrant of arrest or search may not be lawfully executed against

person or promises naving diplomatic immunity.

D. POLICY

1. Responsibilities of FBI[(UNCLASSIFIED)]

Investigation of violations of espionage and related statutes for

prosecutive purposes

Twillegaee Cooperabilities

By Presidential directive FBI has counterintalligence responsibilities

which it shares with military intelligence agencies and is also

charged with correlating information relating to espionage and

making appropriate dissemination.

Coordination in domestic intelligonce

field is effected through Interdepartmental Intelligence Conference.

By National Security Council directive,

FBI and other U. S. intelligence

agencies coordinate

foreign and domestic intelligence through U.S.

Intelligence Board. (See

section 102A, volume IV, of this manual.)

To aid in interpretation of Bureau's policies, following terms are

defined:

(1)

Intelligence - obtaining and distributing information required

for formulation and execution of Government policy

(2) Espionage - intelligence activity directed toward acquisition

of information through clandestine operations

(3)

Counterintelligence - intelligence activity which is devoted to

destroying effectiveness of inimical foreign intelligence

activities and which is undertaken to protect security of

• and its personnel, information, and installations, against

espionage, sabotage, and subversion.

Counterintelligence

process of

procuring,

developing, recording, and

disseminating information concerning bostile clandestine activity

and of penetrating,

manipulating, or repressing individuals,

groups, or organizations conducting or capable of conducting

such activity.

2. General objectives! (CONFIDENTIAL)]

Principal goal is providing adequate protection to our national defense.

To achieve this end and discharge our responsibilities, investigations

should be directed:

a..

To perfect successful counterintelligence

To present to Attorney General for his prosecutive. consideration

Opening cases [SICRET)]

Following general rules apply to opening of espionage cases:

Where specific complaint is received alleging that person is en-

gaged in espionage, together with supporting circumstances to indi-

cate this may be true, case is opened and investigation pursued to

point where,

il possible, allegations can be established

or disproved.

Where nonspecific complaint is

received which is vague and indefi-

submit information to Bureau, indicating no further investigation

is being conducted.

However, this does not mean that before case

opened, full or substantial evidence must be on hand.

If responsible

sources, published data,

confidential informants, double agents,

any reliable citizen makes allegation which would indicate

activities, careful consideration should be given to matter before

decision is made not to initiate investigation.

Investigation of diplomatic or other foreign official personnel, in-

cluding persons within scope of International Organizations Immunities

Act,

should not be instituted without prior Bureau authority.

Determine at earliest possible time whether allegations have any pos-

sible basis in fact in

order to conserve Agents' time and efforts.

Only photographing

cases should be

not contact USAs regarding violations of

other statutes, but submit to Bureau for presentation to Department.

FBI Agents may

photograph, sketch, or make graphic representations

of military or naval installations or equipment without obtaining

from commanding officer or higher authority when request

for investigation has emanated from latter or where urgent nature of

investigation prevents obtaining such permission.

In latter instance,

associates; citizenship status, including date

and place of birth; credit and arrest checks, including subversive

police records; check of pertinent Government agencies' files; check

c .

Development of

sources of information, confidential informants, double

agents, and defectors-in-place

These may be secured through discreet contact with neighbors, friends,

business acquaintances,

or accomplices. Make every effort to corrob-

orate conversations between informants

or double agents and subject

in order that admissible evidence may be available to corroborate in-

formant or double agent.

Make sure latter interprets instructions

correctly and have such

instructions properly recorded.

Ascertain method and nature of communications, including mail drops,

through:

Check of communication company records.

Facilities of these

companies should be used whenever possible and appropriate.

Use of highly confidential techniques.

This is very important

and should be considered whenever security is assured.

Ascertain financial status through:

Credit checks

(2) Chook of bank records.

When bank account is located, it should

be monitored and all sources of revenue fully explored.

Ascertain identity and purpose

of all contacts through coverage as

outlined above.

Also consider:

(1)

Interviews with reliable current and past acquaintances and

associates.

(2)

Check of recorâs at hotels and other places of abode, as well as

public transportation companies when appropriate. When feasible,

maintain liaison with such companies.

POLICY

1.

Department of Justice has advised that USAs are not to authorize prosecu

tion without prior departmental authority in each individual case: therei.

no request should be made of USA for institution of prosecution. (Departze

has instructed, however, that in all cases involving sedition in which

facts justify consideration copies of reports should be designated for ta

referred to Department by Bureau

relative to prosecution. / Should the USA authorize prosecution, proceed

in accordance with his instructions since it is presumed he will have

complied and obtained prior authorization.

Where such prosecutive

action is authorized by a local USA and no advice from Bureau has been

received indicating knowledge that this action has been approved by

the Department,

INVESTIGATIVE PROCEDURE

Ascertain whether persons involved

are civilian or uniformed

personnel of Army, Navy or Air Force.

Ascertain whether offense occurred on military or naval establishment,

reservation, base, field, port or harbor, under jurisdiction of Army,

Navy or Air

or on merchant vessel commissioned in Navy or

in service of Army

If so, communicate facts to proper official of Army or Navy or Air

and conduct no investigation until

a request is received through

proper channels.

General investigation should seek to establish identity and location

Inquire whether

result of words was to arouse

patriotic ardor of listeners or whether its effect was demoralizing.

results.

Bear in mind possibility that this investigation may uncover other

violations of

existing statutes,

such as failure to comply with

postal regulations,

Written or printed words

Investigation of seditious statements appearing in written or

printed material should include inquiries extending beyond analysis

and examination of alleged seditious expressions themselves.

If statements appear in a publication regularly issued, obtain

copies of the publication circulated before
