Senator Schweiker. Would.you'raise your right hand?
Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to
‘| give is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth,
80 help you God?

Mr, Tweedy. I do.

Senator Schweiker. It haa been nice meeting you.

Mr. Tweedy. Thank you very much.

(Whereupon, Senator Schweiker left the hearing room.)

(Discussion off the record.)

Mr. Baron. Mr. Tweedy, you have just receivad the oath

from Senator Schweiker, who has now left tha room, and you are

)Undar no obligation to continues to testify in his absanca, but
obviously the Committesa would appraciate it greatly if you
would continue to testify.

Are you willing to continue to testify in the Senator's
absence?

Mr. Tweedy. I plan to testify fully.

Mr. Baro. You are willing to testify to the truth as
as you can do it?

Mr, “weedy. I will indeed.

Mr. Baron. Are you eware that vou hava the riaht to
counsel?

Teedy. 1 am.

Baron. You ar« appearing here voluntarily without

questions at any point if you wish to consult with counsel?

Mr. Baron. Are you also awara that you may cease answering

Mr. Tweedy. TI am,

Mr, Baron. Finally, areyou aware that all of your Consti-
tutional rights are intact, including your Fifth Amandment
rights to remain silent?

Mr, Tweedy. I am,

Mr. Maron. All right, then.

Lat us proceed to review a set of documents which were not

J available to us in your first examination. Tha attempt here

today is not to go over a lot of old ground that we covered

in your first examination but to focus our concerns on a few

4 main evants in the alleged story of an assassination plot
* againat Lumumba, and to refrash your recollection by review of

thease documants.

Let me introduce as Fxhibit 1 a cable from Allen Dulles
to the Leopoldville Station, marked for Robert Guthman on
October 26th, 1969.

(The document referred
to was marked Tweedy
Fxhibit No. 1 for

TESTIMONY OF BRONSON TWEEDY

Mr. Baron. Wa discussed this cable in your pravious
appearanca, did we not?

Mr. Tweedy. August 26th.

May I correct the date? It 18 Auguat 26th.

Mr. Baron. Certainly.

Mr. Tweedy. It is rather important.

Mr. Baron. It is August 26th,

Mr. Tweady. SS, wa did indeed discuss it the last time

Mr. Baron. After you took another look at this cable

. this morning before we want on the tecord, you made a remark to

{the effect that this cable was a aoures of authority am far as

| YOU Were Concerned at the time.

Is that your impression now?
Mr. Twaedy. Yes.

Let me just add to that a bit. The cable per se I did not

: Femembsr, but &t is perfectly obvious the cable is tha authorit-.

When I first talked to Mr. Bissell about this, he certainly
implied the only reason the subjact was being raised is because
it had been of national policy laval concern. 1 do not think
it could be more clear-cut than that. This was basically, this
was the formal expression of that bv the Director himself.

T cannot remamber which camz first, did I soe this cahle
first, or did I talk to Mr. Bisgal) first. 1 suspect that t

talked to Mr. Uissell first. It must have been absolutely in

TOP SECRET



the same tima pariod.

2 | This merely confirmed what I think I probably hi
(Mr. Bissell first.

4 i Mr. Baron. In this discussion with Mr. Bissell, you are

5 | referring to the subject of getting access to Lumumba for the

6 | purpose of assasaination.

7 Mr. Tweedy. I think it probably came up in the sense that.
“the thrust 6f: the Amafican position was that th was no
“solution in the Congo without the fail from power of Mr. Lumumba,
‘and no measure should be overlooked to achiave this -- constitu-

tional. ravolutionary and indeed, axecutive action, if you want
to call it that.

Mr. Baron. Meaning assassination?

3

é
:

Mr. Tweedy. Yes.

But none of these possible measures wars excluded, and the
main point was that everybody aqreed that fumumba. had to go or
We Were in for very serious trouble in the Conao.

Mir. Raron. You were refurrina a moment aao in discussina
this cable from AIle: Dulles to the fact that when you first
discussed the possitility cf assassiaating Lumumba as one means
of removing him from powar with Richard Bissell, Bissell refarrel
to this cabls.

Mr. Tweedy. No, I would hava sean this cable when it went
out. {1 am afraid you cannot pin ma down on this, because

cau.ot remember the sequance of events. It would have been 4

TOP SECRET



3 l Perfectly natural follow-up to my discussion with Bissell. rt

2 | 48 conceivable that this vant out before I talked to niesell,
do not exclude that, but the two were totally in tandem.

Mr. Baron. faving taken a look at all of the documents
, that we are about to introduca into the record today, before

| we begin taking your tastimony on the record, are you ‘able to
Pinpoint with any more precision your initial discussion with
Mr. Blasell of the prospect of assassinating Lumumba?

Mr. Tweedy. Pinpoint it in terms of time?

Mr. Baron. Yes.

Mir. Tweedy. No, not in terms of time, I can only asauma --

Mr. Raron. Tt would hava takan place shortly hefore this
Allan Dulles cable?

Mr. Tweedy. Either shortly befors, or shortly after,
because the next series of cables obviously qet the show, as
it ware, on the road.

May I comment just generally on those cables as a qroup?
There are no surprises in them as far as 1 am concernad, in
terms of detail. Much of it, even to this dav, 1 still do not
ramember .

One aspect emerges very clearly for me, that wa wars
careful about examining this on ths possibilities of doina
anything against Lumumba, "asically, this whole nariod was «
series of exchanqas with the field who were sewking, as vou cas

see from that cable traffic, various maasures that might nerfor>

TOP SECRET



or achieve the goal, including, indded assaesination, but not ;
by any means limited to-that, that we were in trouble finding
i maans which appeared secure, particularly means which kept the
U.S. hand hidden. It is the to and from, and the atmosphere
of it which is vary familiar to ma; the details of it, much of
J 4 eVen on reading them, is rather unfamiliar to me. I found
no surprises in it.

“ Mr. Baron. Having refreshed your recollection by reviewiccd

i
| thease cables, can you add any greater specificity to the record

about the substance of your conversations with Richard Biasell
on the possibility of assassinating fumumbe? ;

Mr. Twasdy. 1 think what we usad to do, as [ remember it.
whan it came to tha technical exchange with the Station on one
asset varsus another, the possible security weakness of this
man versus the possible strengths of another, Sissall left this
largely to me. I do not mean to sav that we did not from tims
to’ time review it. He did not debate with me on whether(white }

_ {TELE Y was somebody who was worth dealing with or not, becauss
she had Delqian connections, for sxample.

Mr. Baron. You are savinad he would have laft the operat ic
deteils to you?

Mr. Tweady, The oparaticnal details of trying to come u
with som: solution that looked as if it made sense, and had @
promise of success. T do not recall that we would discuss this

type of a cable in datail. As you can ses, he ralaased quite

i

because he wanted to remain familiar with

(Discussion off the record.)
Mr. Baron. Back on the record on thin subject.

i Mr. Tweedy. No, I do not have any further recollection of

| detailed discussions with Bissell on this. on the other hand,

H it was perfectly clear that he remained actively intereated in
“it. Tam aura that he waa the one that had the idea of Justin
O'Donnell, for exampla, I think he undoubtedly came up with

| that idea. As you recall, I had forgotten untirely that Justin
‘otporell had evar played @ role in this. 1 am sure when he
fixed on O'Donnel the possibility tr easirt the ‘hic’ of Statice
he must have discussed this with him. I can almost say I
remember it, but hardly.

Mr. Baron. Do you have any rscollection of what Bissell
‘said to you in the series of discussions on the prospect of
assaasinating Lumumba about the level at which the exploration

of this prospect had beer authorized?

Mr. Tweedy. No. That is the asvect I was never clear on
except that it was parfectly clear to ma that he was quite
confide.t thet this was -- I am now talking about the elimination
of Lumumba by whatever means. T am not tatking necessarily
about assassination: E want to be quite clear on thet.

1 was quite clear in my mind that the policy levels of

Washington ware agreed that Lumumba must qo. [ cannot go any

TOP SECRET



further than that. I cannot say, for example, that Bissell
said I think as an Agency we should consider assassination on
thia or that this had baen discussed with the policy levels
of government. I do not know, and it was never made clear to

Me-nor:does this cable make clear, but it was perfectly clear

| that Mr. Dulles felt quite quiet in his mind about discussing

J any of these aspects with the State Department or the Ambassador,

Mr. Baron. Off tha record.
(Whereupon, a brief recess was taken.)
Mr. Baron.. We are back on the record now.

When we stopped, we ware discussing your account of your

i meetings with Richard Bissell where the subject of asaasainatiny

; Lumumba had arisen among other means that had been considered

in disposing of Lumumba, Did Richard Bissell evar indicate

directly or indirectly to you that he had the authority of the

President of the United States for moving forward with an

“ operation which might include assassinating Lumumba?

Mr. Tweedy. Let me make it quite clear, he certainly
Aever mentioned the President at all.
Mr. Baron. Hy nama?

Mr. Tweady. By nem, or avan by any indication. It was

“merely my impression reinforced, cartainly, either befors or

after, of this cabla of Allan Dulles that this was a policy

[level decision, but the extent to which tha Rxacutive had

assassination discussed with him at all, I cannot comment on.

TOP SECRET



It is perfectly obvious that tha Agency felt that it had
the support of tha. Executive in efforts to aliminate Lumumba.
Tt was at least my imprassion throughout this whole period that

if it aver came down to the point where somebody said, I think

i
| we can do it, and wa decided upon the means, that someone would

| have said, well, bafore we do, obviously thare has to be final
approval. TI would not have known where the final approval

i would hava come from, I would not expect that. my corresporid:
twdth the Chief of Station in Laopoldville would result in the
assassination of Mr, Lumumba without further reference.

Mr. Baron. You ware under the imprassion that whatever
stepa you were involved in toward eliminating Lumumba, as you
put it, were fully authorized at the highest level of the
government?

Mr. Twuedy. Yes, I was.

Mr. Baron. That. would include the Prasidsnt?

Mr. Twaedy. I do not really think 1 can answer that
guestion, Mr. Baron. Whar. somabody at my lavel, fairly senior
though it was, receives clear-cut assurances that ths policy
leval wants something done, it is vary Mifficnl® for him to
Judge whether the President per se has bean in contact with the
Agency or that he has dons this through his “ational Security
Advisor, the Secretary of State, or whoaver. Thare could be
4O way that I could judde that,

I think 1# would) be quite misleading if I were to try to

TOP SECRET



read into it either then or now,

Mr. Baron. Whatever impression you had of the extent of
the authority for the steps that you were taking to eliminate
Lumumba was derived from your conversations with Richard
Bissell?

Mr. Tweedy. And the cable.

Mr. Baron, And the cable by Allen Dulles.

Mr. Tweedy. Which merely indicated to ma that the Agency
was confident that it had its policy guidance and was thus
acting accordingly.

Mr. Daron. Batwaen this cable on Auqust 26th which
Allen Dulles dispatched to tha Congo and tha cable we will now
mark Exhibit 2, which is a cable €rom yourself to Leopoldvilla
on September 19th, marked Fyes Only, Guthman from Jadwin--

{The document. refarred
to was marked Tweedy
Exhibit No. 2 for

identification.)

TOP SECRET



Mr. Baron. Were there any other meetings that you recall

j between yoursalf and Richard Bissell where he asked you to

move bayond the exploratory stage to the implementation staqe
“in assaasinating Lumumba?

Mr. Tweedy. I do not know at all. I just do not recall
that ever occurred.

Mr. Baron. Let us turn, then, to this cable.

This cable

Mr. Tweedy. This is the one on the 19th?

Mr. Baron. Yes.
(Discussion off the record.)
Mr. Baron. Back on tha record.
This cable begins with your indication to the Chief of
Statiou that someone was procesding shortly to the Congo who
. | would announce himself as Sid from Paris.
First of all, to backtrack, Guthman, in this cable, is
the Chief of Station, is that right?
Mr. Tweedy. Correct.
‘Nr. Baron. Who we agreed would be referred to as the
Chief of Stetion or by hin alias, Hadamana, and Jadwin ta --
“ir. Tweedy. My pseudonym,
Baron. Did you hava a first nate in the pi
Twaady. Thomas K.
Raro:. Who was Sid from Paris?

Twaedy. Twas trving to think. The idsntitv is Sid

TOP SECRET



Brown. Sid Brown &s a name means nothing to me.

Mr. Baron. If I reprasent to you that we have had testimony
trom Staney coteLieby that thie identity stood for himself, does
| that refresh your recollection?

Mr. Tweedy. Tt would not surprise me. [t was my assumption
that it probably was, but I could not recall, so I find -- in
j other words, your explanation, I think, te what T would hava
expectad.

Mr. Baron. Do you have any independent recollection of

—— -
dispatching Sidney Gottiiel} on a miseion to the Congo?

Mr. Tweedy. I have the most unclear recollection that 1
. discussed with Mr. Bissell Gitney wortiish*s qoina +o the
Congo. I have no recollections of any conversations 1 ha?
“with Mr. iebgninseit, although T am quite convinced I had
* them,

In other words,it is inconceivable to ma that he would hav<
gone.to the Congo without seeing me. I cannot-recall the
substance of our discussions, although I assume, and I imaai:
Mr. Sissall must have shared in this, we discussed what it wes
411 alout, the oparational preblams involved, so that ha, in
turn, could ba somawhat sensibls ahout what his own aupportin:
rule a: tnis miuat be,

When I say this, it is a rzesonahle assumption but it is
not direct rscollection.

Mr. Baron. ‘Poss this cable indicate to you that you did

TOP SECRET



dispatch {@ney"CSeel feb" tothe Congo on « highly sensitive
mission?

Mr. Twaedy. It does indeed.

When you say I dispatched him, I would say it would be
| more accurate to say that Mr. Bissell and I dispatched him.
am sure the authority for him going would have come from he
rather than ma, but we arranged the details.

Mr: Baron. Your comment about ‘the fact that tha authority

4 would have flowad from Mr. Bissell directy is borne out, is it

> il not, by Mr. Bissell's initials on this cable?

Mr. Tweedy. Yes, exactly.

Mr. Daron. Was that a fairly unusual practice, to have
both the DDP and the Chief of the Africa Division sign a
cable?

Mr. Tweedy. Quite common. Throughout the organization

ton matters of aither particular sunsitivity or so important that

the DDP wished to be constantly informed about correspondence
on @ subject, the Chief of the Division would originate and
send out cables and have it aetually signed off by the DOP
That was quite a common practice in the Agency. :

Mr. Baron. Do you have a recollection, having ssen this
documant, of the fact that you set up a special channe! using

the YOPROP sensitivity indicator?

e
Mr. Tweedy. T did not recall ¥OPROP, but I recall special

channels.

TOP SECRET



Mr, Baron. This would have restricted all traffic from
1f to Chief of Station, is that correct?

Mr, Tweedy. Yas. My Daputy would also have access to it
“dn my absence.

Baron. That would be Glen Fielda?

Tweedy. Yes.

Baron. Would Richard Aissell have access to it?

Tweedy. Indeed ha would.

Baron. Allen Dulles also?

Tweedy. Certeiniy if he wanted, absolutely.
“Mr. Baron. Why wag a special communications channel set
cup in this cable?

Mr. Tweedy. Because of tha sensitivity of the subject.
This, again, was a frequent procedure in ths Agency on sensitive

.matters. If One was abcut to mount a sensitive operation, one

“of the first things normaliy done was to set up special

communications procedures so the dissemination of the messages
could be restricted to what was raquirad.

Mr. Baron. In this case, the especially sensitive subject to
which you Were restricting communications access was the elini~
uation of Lumumba by one means or another?

Mr. Tweedy. That is corrsct.

My. Baron. What was the assianmant thee{Sidney 1
was to explain to the Chief of Station when he arrived in the

Congo?

TOP SECRET



“TOP SECRET

Mr. Twaedy. That, I do not recall. 1 can only

"that Edney Cott tebrwouta hava discussed with the Chief of

| Station Instrumanta which Tsp might have which could be of
sistance in an assassination attempt. I assumed he discussed

_ hie daventory, whatever it might be, and the two presumably were

, trying to coma to some concluaions as to what might have the

, bast chance or the most practical chance of being used.

: This ts my assumption. I think {n this early stage, that

would have been the purpose of the exercise.

Mr. Baron. Let me represent to you tha teatinony ot Sti
Gortliebyanout two conversations that he had at Headquarters
before he undartook the mission to the Congo in Septembar of
1960.

First, when Se. FeetTTaty looked at this cable and some
Subsequent cables which we will discuss today, he said thes=
cables applied to himself. He confirmed the fact that he took
a trip to the Congo and arrived on Sentember 26th as is indiceted

by a subsequent cabla, and left on October Sth, as is indicated

by another cable.

Gortlieb}said before he left the Convo -- 1 en sorry.

before he left for the Congo -- ha had ¢ convarsation with you
and Gles Fields in which you instructed him to take @ lathe)
material to the Conge and give it to tha Chie® of Station
with iustructions to assassinate Lumumba if it were nossible

and to instruct the Chi<’ of Station in the technical means hy

TOP SECRET



which this lethal material could be administered through

| Lumumba's food or toothpaste or something that he would ingest.

| Mr. GBEEYLasalso testified that in that conversation you

| indicated to him that thase instructions ware baing given at
Richard Sissell‘s authority.

Did that conversation take place?

(Dincussion off the record.)

Me. Tweedy. His testimony doss not basically refresh my

memory. Tha only aspact of it which T would find unr, ldstic is

I!
-lenat he had an instruction from ma to tell tha Chief of Station

to use this material and qo ahead and assansinate Lumumba, a5
if, in effact, that is all] the authority that was necessary.
To be frank, that does not make Sense. Tha rest of it is

‘ perfectly feasible. 1 do not recall it in the detail, but 1

am not going to deny whe (3 54j vata. T think his racollactior

| that 1 told him, in effuct, to go to the Chief of Station ant
sort of qat the show or the road and use the poison and
assassinate Lumumba without any furthar ceremony {s just not th
way it would have happened.

Mr. Raror. Why is that?

Mr. Tweady. For tha simple reason that. under ne cireumste:
would that instruction hava been given by me without referen
to higher authority up through the chein of command.

Mr. Maron. When yeu say reference to hicher authority,

what do you mean?

TOP SECRET



18
Tweedy. My higher authority in the first instance

Mr. Bissell.

Baron. SK] did testify --

Twaedy. I understand.

Baron. -- that you referred in your conversation with
him to the fact that you had authority from Mr, Bissell for the
assignment you were giving to Gottlieb.

Mr. Tweedy. The only thing that Mr.{GSteTiab, would disaqree
on 48 that there would be no further reference, which his
statement implies from Leopoldville bufore they took any action
on this matter, in other words, take the final action on this
matter, and that was navar @ matter, to the bast of my recotlec-
tion, that was aver delegated by Mr. Bissell. In other words,

Mr. Bissell never said, look, you have the picture, go ahead

and do it in your own good time without any further reference

i .
* to me or anybody else, nor is the tenor of this correspondance

ae I read it that way at all.

‘Ar. Baron. Mo you recall if Mr. Bissell ever want as far
as telling you that if an opportunity arose to carry off the
assassination of Lumumba in a situation where it would he
practically impossible to confirm, that there was authority
for proceeding with the assassination with Neadquarters, thet
the Chief of Station would be, under those circumstances,
authorized to procead to assassinate Lumumbe?

Mr. Tweedy. No, 1 do not.

TOP SECRET



Mr. Baron. Do you have 4 recollection about that one way
jor the other? :

Mr. Tweedy. I do not recall that he ever put it to me
: this way.

Mr. Baron. Let us then break down your statement about this

vee
meeting with iDr- Gottligb\ into component part:

You agree now, having heard Sr. aotti testimony, that
| dt de true that you had asked GF. Gottlfeij to go to the Congo?
Mr. Tweady. Indeed, as I assumed I had, yen.
Mr. Baron. It is also true that you knew that Or: coettiey -
was to carry a lethal material to the Chiaf of ‘station in the

Congo?

Mr. Tweedy. If he says so, T do not dlsaqres with him.

wane 8 reus

1 do not frankly recall thet at this point, but Tam perfectly
wadded to accept what. he says.

Mr. Baron. Assuming, for the momant, that you would have
required the Chisf of Station to check back with Headquarters
before he carriad out an assassination mission, would it be
true thet vou assigned oconky the task of inatructine
the Chief of Station toe essassinete Lumumba on that basis?

Mr. Taedy,. : was the head of the Technical
Services Division, or whatever it was called in those days.

Mr. Baron. Let me jump in for a momant.

At this point, for about a year anda half, ha was the

Sclence Advisor to Mr. Bissell, and ha moved to Tachnical

TOP SECRET



shortly thereafter.

Tweedy. The way you put 1 to me was that T instructed:

4 te assassinate Lumumba. The answer to that is, f am

‘sure I never instructed Gottlieb; to assassinate Lumumba, This

ie the way you put it to me.

Mr. Baron. Let me correct that.

What I maant to say was, would you have asked “Geet ee}

to convay the instruction to the Chief of Station that he was

toa sinate Lumumba if he found a way to do it and if he

' confirmed it with Headquarters?

“rl, Tweedy. My answer to that is almost certainly not.

That. would have beer, covared in other correspondunce, which T

“ think is demonstrated by thase cables, to tha Chief of Station

direct jfrom ma with authority of Mr. Bissell. 1 would not have
used, neither would ‘ir. Bissell, Mr. (QOetrled5as the channel
for thils instruction.

Mr. Baron. Gr. Gottly jas also tastifiad that, aside

fron carrying the materials to the Chief of Station aad

instructing in their use and giving him an inatruction abour «
mission to essassinere Lumumba, thet he had one further role
is, the Conge: he was to sarve 45 a technical advisor to the
Chisf of Steti on the faasihility of using these bioleric
substances to carry off ths oparation.

TR pues it, ey was to atay down there for

a short period of tins to datermina tha tachnical feasibility

TOP SECRET



of the operational plan that the Chief of Station might come

up with.

Mr. Tweedy, This ems quite reasonable to me. Presumably!

1 with his technical knowledges of the nature of these materials

| he would be in a position to eithar comment on or afvise the
| Chief of Station as he attempted to put together some kind of
operation. That makas good sense to me.

He would require, besieally, a technical advisor.

Mr. Baron. Dr’ aleo testified that the materials
lhe took with him were of a fairly short life. Their toxicity
“would wane within a matter of weeks.

Givan that bit of information to refresh your recollect {cs
“dows that make it more likely that Gottliehjwas there, to ald
the Chief of Station in actually carrying off the administration
of these drugs, 4s opposed to diving him qeneral instructions
in the use of such lethal substances?

Mr. Tweedy. I do not. know really that T can commant. on
thet. [ff the materials would deteriorate fast, the use of them

ossible, [ would stress the letter, would necessarily have
to be expeditied, but the overwheining concern of Headquarters
aud the field, again, demonstrated in this correspondance was
our coucera that this thing could be done at all, that it be
dons right, securely, aud that the U.S, hand should he
concealed.

If this ware at odds with the life of thase materials,

TOP SECRET



think that would have just been too bad. But I think it is

perfectly clear that we would not have expedited anything at

{ the risk of doing it unprofessionally.

Mr. Baron. At the point ‘that. EELiab: lett for the congo
; after talking with you, would he have been enpowerad to convey
i to the Chief of Station that an assassination of Lumumba could
“ba carried off if he could meet the criteria you just laid out,
i) Concealment of the U.S. hand and use of these materials before
© their potency waned?

Mr. Tweedy. My answer to that would be he would be in 20
position to do anything more with the Chia? of Station if they
reached that point in planning, that as of the last time ha

.was at Ileadquarters that thare would probably be an approval
from Washington.

Mr. Baron. You would axpect, then, the Chief of Station

‘would have been expected to reconfirm with Headquarters the
fact that he had a go-ahead?

Mr. Tweedy. It would aever have occurred to me othsrwis.

Mr. haron. It would be your testimony that, although you
do net specifically recall your conversation with aan
you would have made that clear to

Mr. Dawsen. The authorization of the assassination effor*,.
the alinination of Lumumba.

Mr. Tweedy. Only in tha most general terms. ‘lo opsretio:
had been put forward by the field. ta our business, these
thinas were done by operational planning, at which point one
came up with an operation thet was agreed upon by tha Station

Mr. Tweedy. In this cable traffic, was looking at all
i) sorts of ways and meane of eliminating Lumumba, not restricted
to assassination, which coincides exactly with my recollsction
of the: period betwaan when the subject was first broached to the
Station and that rathar indafinable period when, in effect, tt
was all over, which, [ sunpose, basically {s the disanpearance
of Lumumba.

I think all of this traffic supports my contantion thet

Leopoldville set about exploring all alleys and found none

* assessination mission in such a short period of tima?
Mr. Tweedy. T want to be careful to how T reply to that.
All 1 was saying to a vary profassional colleaque was that we
hed no illusie:s about tha fact that tha plenning operation
of this would be very difficult, at bast, and would taka time
and thoroughly agree with the fact that prospects, immadiate

prospects, wera such that there was no alternative for £

: Uecetlign to return. That is all [ was sayina.

But to say what T was trving to exprass to him was ths

fact that we were not overly disappointed that Lumumba was not.
assasainated at this point is just not the level of intercourse

that I had with a very professional Chiéf of Station. That is

yall.

Mr. Baron. Does not tha paragraph A here indicate that

| the objective of tha mission that was discussed in the YOPROP
. Y

i channel was to assaasinate Lumumba in view or in light of the

ete
that {Cote byhad gone to tha Congo with materials that

only going to ba lethal for a short pariod of time?
Mr. Twaedy. That is what it says.
Mr. Baron. In other words, what I am trying to explore

with you is your characterization of thin entire staqe of the

‘eperation as one of planning and exploration when wa know that
* Gottlieb took matarialx to the Congo which would only ba lethe!
"for a short pariod of timu‘and preaumably was prepared to move

Mr. Tweedy. If, ag a result of the Station focusing on
the problem for the first time, as a rasult of Neadquarters’
request, they had come up with @ plan that they thouaht was
exceedingly solid and which Headquarters approved, it is not
surprising, perhaps, that we wanted the matarials thare to tax=
advantage of such, if you like, an unlikely avant. But this
would not chanae tha normal sequence of events. which would bs

Tequest for approval or either approval or no approval. This
would not have changed.

Mr. Baron. . Because Gottiiet* took lethal materials to

ody
the Congo with him that had such a short period of lethality,
ware you not contemplating at that time that. the operation
might well mova from the exploration phase to the implementation
aa

phage just as soon as Gottliebjand HNedgeman determined that it
waa feasible?

Mr. Tweedy. I think I would put it quite differently.

T think that I would say that we would have been remiss in not

“being in @ position to uxploit, if we reached the point where

we all agreed that the thing was possible.

If they had merely gone over and said we think wa can +o

Mr. Baron. You would ‘have expected the Chief of
Station to cable back for confirmation, but 1* was certain);
within your contemplation at the tine that when Gottliap went
to the Congo, when the Chinf of Station cabled for confirme-
tion, you would probably give him a qo ahea:! to essassinat+
Lumumba?

Mr. Baron. You would’ have referred that to Bissell?

Mr. Tweedy. Yes.

Mr. Baron. He would have referred it?

Mr. Tweedy. le would have referrad it according to his
lights. That was not my business. le was his own level of
authority. lu was as aware of his authority as I was at my
leval. 1 only assume that thin would hava bean discussed at
the highest level, certainly at the Agency. 1 assume that the
decision would have had to have been mide by Allen Dulles and
who else he wished to consult in Washinaton.

These are pure assumotiona on my part. Under no circum-
stancas would I have qivan the go ahead.

Mr. Dawson. That is interesting.

Mr. Baron. I just have one more question on this line.

Tt veelive we are going very closely over this qround. We worl!

clarify for the record exactly what shade of maaning you want

Would it be fair te say that when you dispatched Gott

to the Condo you expected to hear back --

TOP SECRET



Mr. Tweedy. I expected this would result in a dialogue
between the Station and ourselves as to what might be feasible.

Mr. Baron. You were hoping?

Mr. Tweedy, Gottliebjassisting the Chief of Station in

his explorations.

Mr. Baron. In view of the entire policy of the Agancy at
that time, as indicated in the cables of Dulles and the cables
from yourself and Bissell to the Congo, you were hoping that

ind the Chief of Station would find a feasible means
of carrying out an acsassination mission and then inform you of
that.

Mr. Tweedy, I am not going to commant on the hope. [ do

| not know what my frame of mind was on that.

The purpose of the exercise was to sea wheather this was

il possible. One thing was clear, that I was the instrument of

: policy in carrying out the exploratsan which was entirely a

professional matter. If the exploration had reached a point
where we felt that we could submit to higher authority a plan
which we thought made some sansa, at that point hiahar authority
would have to take the ball and run with it and let us know
what they concludsd.

Mr. Baron. By higher authority hara, you mean any
authority highar than yourself?

Mr. Tweady. It would start with me in my chain of comm

to the President or anybody else, I was perfectly clear in my
mind bacause of what had occurred and the way that these matters
had been broachsd to the field by Mr. Pulles, that the thing
was in the national arena and was junt not in the Agency's
arena.

What Mr. Dulles would have done and what he felt his

| authorities ware from higher authority I cannot tall you.

Pawson. That would have been @ matter that would hava

Mr. Tweedy. In the first instance, {t would have baen

Mr. Dawson. Tha chain of comman? would have baan, you
would have talked to Bissell, you would not have bean expact+!
or would have asked what Mr. Dulles’ view werd?

Mr. Tweedy. Mind you, We were also an Adancy that was
very Flexible. 1 am not saying Yr. Mulles might not have talked
to ms about this, that was bacause Mr. Nissell was not
immediataly available, or something of this kind.

What Tam saying is ut the working level, tha operetio

In othar words, the degrea to which he thought he would

Mr, Daron. It was your job to find a feasible way to carry

; Out an assassination; it was the job of Bissell and those above

him to decide wheather to go ahead, as far as you ware concerned?

Mr. Tweedy. As far as I was concernad, that ia the way it

Mr. Dawson. You have no independent or cific recollac-

Mr. Baron. Returning to the cable of October 7th, 1960,

fy
which you sant to the Chief of Station, the referance to a

i
sanior case officer who might be dispatched to the Congo, is that

a referance to the fact:that Bissell was considering dispatching

Justin O'Donnell?

Mr. Tweedy. No other candidate, no other. I assume thet

| ie who tt is.

Mr. Baron. ‘O'Donnell's account = that he was asked by
Bissall to go to the Congo to carry off the assassination of
Lumumba would fit here?

Mr. Tweedy. Sure.

Mr. Baron. The third country national referred to in this

) cable and in other cables as someone you are considering

dispatching to the Congo to help with the operation, would that
be QJWIN or WIROGUR?

Mr. Twasdy. As I told you before, definitely not WDROGHF.

Mr. Baron, That was QUWIN, IT will represent to you that

QUWIN was the agent who wes supervised by Justin O'Monnell.

Mr. Tweedy. We read that that time, which is my only

recollection of it. That is the person I am sure.

Mr. Baron. t me correct myself here

I will reprasent to you that QJWIN was the agent thet was

use by O'Donnell and perhaps by the Chief of Station.

Is that consistent with your recollection?
Mr. Tweely. No, it is not consistent with my recollection.
It is certainly consistent with what [ read the last time I saw

‘you, which f have no reason to dispute. [ just cannot remember

"the blighter at all.

Mr. Baron. As Exhibit 10, let us introduce a cable of
October 15th, 1960, which ia not sent in the Yapror channel.
It ds marked RIBAT PLAT in the space whers sensitivity
indicators are usually placed.

(The document referred

Mr. Baron. This cable requests the views of the Chief of

Station on suggestions A, B and C for various covert operations.

: ve
In paragraph C, there is a reference toffiROaK.

Mr. Twaedy, we have received the representation from the

“ CIA that that was a cryptonym used to refar to Lumumba.

I Is that consistent with your intereptation of the cable?

Mr. Baron, It is indeed.
Mr. Twaedy. This paragraph C says in part: “Only direct
action we can now stand behind 1s to support immobolizing or

ra .
arresting ROAK, desirable as more definitive action might be.

" Any action taken would have to be entiraly Congolese.”

How, you signed this cable, but it wax not sent in the
special sensitivity channel that dealt with Gottiteb's mission
to the Corg8t

Before we discuss this cable, let us also introduce inte
the record as Exhibit 11 another cable which you sianed on

Mr, Baron. The cable ‘continues: “Raise above so you not

Now, dows this peir of cables indicate that at this point.
despite the iudication in the first cable that we looked at thee

Mr. Tweedy. I think that {2 accurate.

We had come to the end of the road, at least-temporarily
on the YOPROP aspect and for the tima being we were in no
position to approve anything but: what was discussed in the
. Oye cable. Nonetheless, as long as the threat to the Congo
from Lumumba axisted, there remained @ high priority to search
for means to take care of the fqproP Planning aspects.

Mr. Baron. When the cable refers to the specific purpose

you discussed with colleague -~

Nr. Tweedy. This 4s assassination with

Mr. Baron. I[t then says: This purpose remains highest

i priority. Would that not indicate to the Chief of Station

; that he should proceed to find a way that Lumumba could be

einated?

Mr. Tweedy. What this would mean to the Chief of Station

‘was that he should retaiA exploration of possible means of
“assassinating Lumumba as highest priority. He should continue
to suck means to do this, not to do it.

Mr, Tweedy. It would have baen restricted, but not as

Mr. Barom. Would somebody at the Embassy conceivably
have been cut in on cable traffic in the channel that dealt with
a operations?
Mr. Tweedy. Could be, certainly. a:
Mr.. Baron. In other words, the porpose of sending a

@econd cable on the same day which dealt with action against

Lumumba was: what?

Mr, Tweedy. The simple reason I think -~ I say I think,

obviously you'd coma temporarily to the and of the line on

Once again referring to tha original cable from Mr. Dullas
which said all means, in effect, ani I think the reason I'm
putting this in the open channel, the open channel is still --

Mr. Baron. Simply the ordinary channel uned between

Mr. Tweedy. Still a restricted channel. RIBAT is a

with the Ambassador or the Embassy, if any aspect of it seemu:

Mr. Tweedy, Yes.

Mr. Baron. The Chief of Station then makes « suggestion
in the fourth paragraph for equipment that might be provided if
yfuch a case officer were to be sent. He ssays, "If case officer

nt, racommend Ieadquarters pouch soonest high powered foreign

make rifle with telescopic sight and silencer. tlunting good
[here when lights right, However as hunting rifles now forbidden.
| Would keep rifle in office panding opening of hunting season.”
Would you take that to be a racommendation by the Chi
[of Station, 1f a case officer was sent to the Congo to concen-
"erate on tha Yrror operation, he should be provided with ths
kind of weapon that would he suited for a sniper shot at
Lumumbe ?

Mr. Tweedy. Yes. Not necessarily to be fired by the
case officer, obviously not, but at least used in the operatic...

Mr. Baron. ‘This reference to the hunting seeson can be

taken as a reference obliquely to tha fact that Lumumba was in

UN custody and that there would not be, in effect, “open
Season” or. him until he showed his face outside of tIN custo’y.
Would that be a fair interpretation?

Mr. Tweady. I would not have interpreted it quite the
same way. J would have interpreted it this way, which was if
it, as 4 rasult of Ileadquarters suggestion that a rifle be
providad to the Station, the Station would come up with an
operational plan involving the use of the ri€le which Neaddue: t-r5

would approve, and that thus, in uffact, tha cparation was on

by a rifle,that would be ‘the opening of the hunting season.

In other words, tha point where they knew how it could be used

Mr. Baron. I have one other general quastion before wa

take 4 break, and that is, returning to(Sidney cottileb’s
i account of his conversation with Richard Bissell about -making
| preparations for carrying off an assassination against an
| African foreign leader if it were required

that context that he.had higher authority for such an operation.

if So
Gottlied also said that he clearly interprated Bissell to mea:

that Aissell had Presidential authority for such an operation?
Did you have any knowledge of such a conversation hetwean
GSeCTew and Dinsell from any source?

Mr. Tweedy, I do not recall that ee li and [ evar
discussed highar authority and approval. 1 do not say that it
did not occur. re GottLieh said that he had this impression
in talking to Bissell, I cannot say no, but I cannot comment
on it further.

Mr. Baron. For the moment, we have no further questicrs
and we will take a break uow and pick up aqein before the full
Comaittes and Fxecutive Session this afternoon.

Thank you very much for your patience in qceing throuth th
