Mr. Robert A. Maheu

120 Rosemary Lane

Las Vegas, Nevada

Dear Bob:

In accordance with our recent phone conversation, I offer this letter of

resignation to Robert A. Maheu Associates, effective December 31, 1970.

I appreciated your understanding for my resigning in order to accept more

challenging opportunities over the years. Tenure with you was more than

rewarding, however.

Enclosed is a Sucre check drawn from First National City Bank (in Out

Because of devaluation last year, the cashable value will be less than

the $10, 000 originally deposited. Also, enclosed is the blank check

which you signed and returned to Jaime Duran.

In reviewing salary deposits, I find additional amounts due to me and

shall notify you when I determine exactly what is payable. I shall de-

duct the $500 I withdrew which you deposited to Bank of America

in Quito

I want to express my appreciation for your kind considerations during my

years with Robert A. Maheu Associates and I hope we shall meet again

in the future.

My sincere regards to you, your family, Peter, Richard Ellis, and Ceil

Nolan. I wish you much success for the future.

Sincerely,

APPROVED FOR RELEASE 1993
