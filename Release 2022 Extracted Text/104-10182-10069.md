been love of excitement and wish to make money, ie also claized that he did
not work for the French Resistance, althoucs it was possible and probably
that they gave hin orders to fill, He did nention working through internediaries
and cut-outs, so its possible that ho did actually work with the Resistance but

police for his activities, and later brought to Berlin where he was interrogated
for several months at Cestapo lieadquarters. ¥a ended up by spending tine in

__ 34 “Damage Report Contribution

1, . The following observations and. comments ‘are intended to
represent an- informal personality assessment and factors in’consid-
eration of resettlement ‘for. AESPIC, now WIROGUE.. It is based on a
period of-training and handling prior to: anticipated dispatch--early
Julystthrough late November.1960. These thoughts are based on
personal daily extended contact ‘as traincr/agent handler with Subject
as a member of prospective cross-border team for implementation of
REDSOX Operation. AESENTINEL. One member was re-assessed operationally
unsuitable; which left a team of 2 agents, both of which Undersigned
continued to handle.. It is:hoped that this assessment may be of
some benefit to the AF Desk Officer, who requested it the day of this
writing. It is intended that Subject's demonstrated suitability for
AESENTINEL, an infiltration-exfiltration operation into difficult’.
terrain in the Soviet Union, will serve as a mechanism rather than
an end in illustrating Subject's general abilities and limitations
for the task at hand. An attempt has been made to present this
material in subject categories considered operationally meaningful.
Quoted passages in Part I are Subjects own or the closest approx-

imation memory permits.
a
2. It is my considered opinion that the SubjectVof this writing

has the highest personal and professional regard for Undersigned. I

do also consider that, although thoughtful handling and self assured-
ness were prerequisite ‘agent control factors during this case, Subject
did not causevan uncomfortable amount of special handling problems.
The senior Project Officer was Mr. Perry Crookham, C/DOD/DOB during
the training and holding prior-to-dispatch phase of the operation.

3. Subject Background and Chronological Association Factors
Deemed Operationally, Significant

A, Subject is.an approximately 49 year old cithnic Georgiana
fluent in Georgian, French, German and English, Subject emigrated to
France with the remains of his family during the pre-Lycée stage of
his life. His father, a TBILISI University academician and intellect-
ual of some note , elected to stay in Soviet Georgia, during which
period Sovict dominance in the. West Caucasus was fairly well
solidified. Subject considers that his fathers decision was made of



his own free wit | ut which nevertheless disappointed Subject greatly,
as he greatly admired him, despite the fact that Subdject's’ fathers
decision was responsible for the suicide of his mother, whom Subject
greatly loved. Undersigned believes that Subject anguish in
memories of his parents was genuine, Subject was a clever though.
precocious child during his Lycée education, and frequently was
dismissed by ‘school directors who did not: appreciate his temperamental
though erratically brilliant performance. Subject,during this stage
€ ‘development, probably tricd as hard as ever in his life to conform
to the rules of society, which during that stage of French national
educdtion practices, would probably scem quite strict by American
middle-school practices. Subject greatly desired academic/professional
(+ recognition in-imitation of his father. These feelings were especially
frustrating hecause of hi$ quick mind and. seeming natural ability for
mechanical and electrical theory and principals. I do not: believe he-
ever has learned to consider*conventions of living anything more than
a tiresome game to be played when there is no alterndtive. Subject's
quick mind, and early appreciation, recognition and adaptance of
guile did much to ensure the ncessary understanding of French culture
for moderate success in that country. Subject who an unusual
looking man even by French standards, has ho trouble in identifying
with the under-privileged elements of French society. Subject is
teriporally bald, hooked nose, short,’ slender, bandy legged, wiry,
“and'of dark complexion but possessed of a dry, caustic wit eager to
‘Laugh and contribute in’ the Caucasian spirit of comarderie to those
whom he considers worthy of friendship. Subject, howsver, makes real
friends cautiously, and has conciously established for himself
perscnality assessment. criteria that would do justice
ful senior FI or CE C/O - agent handlers.

B. World War II offered Subject the welcomed opportunity to
ability,agd ingenuity by engaging in black market affairs in
luxury items andVtraVel documents in German-occupied France.” Subject
would wistfully recount stories of his escapades during that period,
which, after really getting to know Subject, seemed to te entirely
mossible, Subject admired the Germans as “worthy anponents",
particularly their efficiency and ability to act decisively whether the
problen be tactical or strategic, An extended period of German
encarceration (until war's end) did nothing to alter his ‘opinion.

Wars’ end left Subject bored and unfulfilled, The excitement and thrill
of "the game" were gone and Subject's unsettled, numb confusion was

for quite another reason than most of Europes milling thousands of
displaced and ‘shattered families. Therefore, it was not long before
Subject and a close friend from his black market days decided on a
daring daylight bank robbery in one’ of the: suburban centers of France.
Subject contends he planned the robbery from start to finish, and
needed only someone to help. Subject and his accomplice carefully.
cased a bank, stole a heavy truck and during the height of the business
day backed the truck fuli speed in reverse through the large street
level plate’glass window. Subject said he hopped out of the truck with

to many success-

show hi



an automatic weapon, while "the people were frozen’ solid", gathered
up the money and was away quickly. Subject sdid the scheme failed
because his accomplice went to the cache-site to get some of the money
to spend before it was safe to do so. His accomplice was apprehended
and in time broke down and implicated Subject. Subject said he wes
not :bitter at his betrayer, but rather professé¢d a genuine admiration
for French interrogation techniqués. Subject served a difficult
confinement of 5 yéars, andwas ‘paroled to an older brother in

Marseilles, as I recall.

C.. «Subject said that he began at that point to appreciate the
futility of violent actions, while opposing the authority of society.
He therefore attempted to go into business using some of the inventions’
that he had conceived during his confinement in prison. His winning
personality and intense drive .and self-confidence quickly gained him a
business partter with capital to invest in’ a cinematographic color
reproduction system that was pattened and earned decent profits for the
venture. Subject was still on parole and tied to his older brother
"self-righteous indulgence’, however. It was shortly after this that
Subject was approached by a'member of the AIS who was ‘following up on
Subject as-an-ops lead furnished by a cousin in the US who was a
moderately successful lawyer, and who had beer’ long since recruited as
an agent Spotter for cithnic Georgians. Subject was favorably assessed
and removed back from France, because of travel restrictions imposed
under his parole status. I believe that this opportunity rekindled
his old feelings of éxhilaration and ateful enthusiasm for the
opportunity to perform his deeds of ding for _an authority, sanctioned

by a national state, in this case the AIS.

D. Were at last, he considered, was a secure source of backing

and support, for his natural outlets. Subject always considered the
Agency as sn. Ge business partner, ally, and protector. Ile was

therefore a grateful, sincere "tool" who thoroughly enjoyed his role

E. He was a willing pupil, physically active -- since the job
called for physical endurance -- and looked on self-denial and fatigue
recognition ag a point of honor. ‘Undersigned was never a poor
athlete, however, was bested on numerous occasions at whatever the
field probéem. Subject absorbed Soviet Realities, order Troops M.0.
and basic tradecraft quickly and with great applied flexibility.

F. It was during this period that Subject began to confide
regularly and in depth to Undersigned, Subject would often tell
Fred, you must. belicve me, I want to do something."

"IT will do anything you tell me to do, only tell me.” "You (meaning

Undersigned ultimately conducted this

back to his Scandinavian home where resettlement.was achieved

6. WIROGUE Resettlement Considerations

A. AF/S representative has requested comment from Undersigned
on [NIROGUE's apparent reluctance at resettlement attempts in Frankfurt
a/M which are underweigh at the present time, I believe. It is
undersigned's understanding that (ouajeetsc2 has threated to work for
the French Service if resettlenent negotiations do not proceed to é
Subject'sS liking. Speculation has been that this is probably a bargain-
ing tactic t6 gouge an appreciable amount of additional dollars in his
resettlement claim. Undersigned considérs this a quite valid
assumption, and entirely attributable to Subject, Subiect probably
views this threat as particularly critical in view of the seeming
poli nfléct with the French, and appeeciates by now
one of the differences between the AIS and the IS of a fascist and/or
totalitarian state,



A
z

"internationally tolerated, “Spyi

B. However, Undersigned would like to suggest the following
interpretation h-tever valu: be in it. T suggest that money,
per se, is net the primary end that Subject is ‘striving for-now, just
as it never seered to be his pri concern throughout his-life. [
believe that. Subject genuinely enj clandestine operations; at least,
his conceptien of clandestine operations. Subject probably would,
prefer to work for the ‘AIS or: possibly the W. German Service because
he has a genuine fondness for the people and many aspects of the :
kulture of both countries. The idea of legalized, or at least

offers the opportunity to

legitimize, and thereby rationalize, Subject's sesadsecsten that he is
protecting equity in an important, unique,’ "professional"
category.~

C,-‘Subject,: during the period of Undersigned>exposure, always’

considered that..if he had money-fine, if not, then enough would come
his way from.someplace:to sustain him from one venture © the next.
Subject felt that the acquisition of money would be a by-product of
his’ opportunist. schemes and technical inventions in pursuance of his
main goal-personal recognition for perscnal achievements and triumphs’.

D. I believe Subject does not expect ‘to be accepted in his
offer of employment with the French.Service, but rather to let our
minds jump to the next logical step-the full meaning of the result
of such an atter3t on his part. Subject knows very well that he has
violated his parole and would be encarcerated on his return. I believe
his pride and the probability of censure and ridicule of family and
friends in France would disuade hin in the final analysis.

E, Subject is a most excellent chess player. [ have never
won from him, nor have I cver seen him lose a game. I consider that
Subject has thought this line of action out thoroughly. It.is
apparent that he is willing to gamble his quit claim settlement on
something that I beiieve he has specifically in mind--possibly the
offer of new docunents and identity in sone third country. He has
always had a great desire to "surprise" everyone back home (i.e. Paris):
with new docuzents, a new identity, plastic surgery, etc. I do not
believe that what he wants is necessarily more dollars, but rather
for the AIS to once again help h&n (as co-partner) to achieve his aim
of acclaim, su and recognition, possibly this time to family and
friends in France.

F, ¥ do net believe that. Subiect could ever be physically
intimidated. He lost half his front teeth to German interrogators and
the other half to French prison guar Additionally, he docs possess
a defiant spirit that sometimes c through as sheer obstinacy to
friends.

is considerd worthwhile, I believe an attempt should

G. f it
be made to lecate 2 C/O locally who has handled him in the past. A
C/O for who ct has respect as a higher echelon and whom he

this C/O interview Subject

considers understands him. T suggest tha
in an uncontrolled environment to determine what it is that Subject



‘
really wants. -To. bet of my ‘recollection, Subject thought highly
of Monty Love (T), the C/O that helped pitch him and who brought
him out Black from France. Monty was to'go to one of the German
Stations or bases the last time I saw him in late 1959.

8. Damage Report Contribution

"4 A, The following constitutes Undersigned's contribution to a
damage report that may well be necded in view of Subject's posture in

.the matter at hand. It covers only that time sequenteduring which
 Undersigned actively handled Subject.

B. This span. constitutes:

early July $9 - late Nov 1969

# “ C. At that time Undersigned was a junior C/O onthe
AESENTINEL Project which was’ to be prepared and launched from the ZI

“ by SR/DOB, a covert site ops base i formerly in the District of

Columbia.
D, In early July of 59, Undersigned as "Fred" and

George Fill (SR Staffer) as "Mr. George” met Subject and his teammate
“Al who arrived at Natl. Airport, D.C. with their agent handJer and
trainers. The group had returned from several weeks of survival
training in Alaska, and consisted of:
Zubject “Little David" (A)
(1) Mr. Gregg (A)

- "AL" (agent team mate)” Big Al” (A)
(T) Bill’ (A)

; We drove immediately to a Safehouse in the Virginia
countryside and conducted training, holding and orientations from
that: site until the operaticn was placed on indefinite c ervation
and ultimately cancelled becasue of the Powers U-2 incident.

F. | Safehouse keepers were ‘an elderly married couple -
"Geof and Janie." There were approximately 6 DOB QP vehicles exposed

to Subject.

G. During this holding period another C/O and several agent
handlers were there on regular occasions:

Perry Crookham (T} "Mr. Pat" (A)

Myron Toloczko (T) "Ski" (A)



Ray Hanchulak (T) "Ray" (A)
Gordon Mothes (T) “Gordon” (A) \
\

(1) "Joe" (A)

enamine |() : "Pod"

H.” Subject. knew the operating principles and handled the
scale mock-up of the ELINT géar to be used on AESENTINEL. Subject

was exposed to training in:
Q) Basic and Advanced Fieldcraft, to include small rae
(2), Basic tradecraft techniques and practices :
(3) Soviet Russian language training
(4) Soviet interrogation techniques \
(S) -M.0. of KGB Border troops
(6) AESENTINEL Ops. plan

1964, : ;

2. Subject arrived in Frankfurt/Main from the Congo on 22 May

“ » 1962, -KUBARK's “reasons: for ‘establishing contact were dictated by
the need to relieve Subjéct of his KUBARK-supplied false Austrian
Passport, the need to institute. or suggest a course of action
which would encourage him to establish himself as a contributing
member of society and, above all, prevent his return to the Congo.

3. Subject appeared to be primarily a resettlement problem,
therefore, Orme K, DARONNAT was assigned the Case Officer

responsibility.

4. Since adequate documentation was a primary.consideration for
“Successful resettlement, Subject was briefed on the relative merits
of the types of .FEDREP-documentation available. Although Headquarters
had recommeded a backStopped Fremdenpass, subsequent discussions
between DARONNAT ‘and MKTOPAZ FRAN representatives indicated a

1962 the BUNDESVERFASSUNGSSCHUTZ (BFV), the West German organization

OCA Bonn that Subject was strictly a HARVARD agent resettlement case

G. By summer 1963 detailed South American immigration data
had been acquired. This disclosed.that Subject's. language
deficiencies, background, knowledge of the Soviet Union, and work
history were insufficient to guarantee his smooth processing
through the INTERGOVERNMENTAL COMMITTEE FOR EUROPEAN MIGRATION ®
CICEM) «:) Our “investigation also pointed up the fact that until
Subject was provided with a‘detailed life history containing the
informetion required by prospective employers and/or immigration
authorities, he was not in a position to be resettled anywhere,
jet-alone South America, As a‘result, MARVARD's plans to process
Subject for immigration had to be cancelled, at least temporarily.

7, UA CABEZONE Stage I C.0.-was given the task of preparing a
life story containing the factual {nformation needed for the filling
out of job applications, to.stand up under detailed interviews and,
if South American immigration ever took place, to satisfy immigration
requirements. This-légend was givel: to. ODIBEX Camp King representa
tives who ‘prepared,a new political recognition interview story,
arranged for the removal of copies of the old story from the various
FEDREP files and replaced them with the new.

- 8, For the. first time since Subject had arrived in HARVARD's
custody the way was clear for a final resettlement. Subject's
Reiseausweis was renewed and he was’ quitclaimed and advised to
work and establish himself in Germany. He was told that nothing
more could be done for him and that immigration to South America
at anytime in the future would be without KUBARK assistance.

9. HARVARD has ‘done everything to insure Subject a successful
future -free from problems resulting from his "black" association
with KUBARK., Therefore, there is good reason to believe that
KUBARK will not have to become involved with any of Subject's
“future problens. It is also unlikely he will attempt to coerce
KUBARK with threats to reveal all. With his criminal background
he is aware that he can -be brought to the attention of the French
authoities. He also believes that. KUBARK's position in the FEDREP
is such that we have nothing to.fear from any action on his’ part.

10. At the time of this writing Subject has a position as
research and development engineer with a Munich firm, He allegedly
yeceives DM 1500 per month, has ai expense account and is to receive
a percentage of all profits realized’ from the sale of any devices
he develops. He expects to move to Munich permanently about the

end of May or June 1964,

11, HARVARD has arranged with CSB Data Processing Branch to
publish a noforn drop notice under Subject's: documented name so
that any attempt to immigrate to any country will bring him to the
attention of KUBARK and appropriate action can be taken,

12, It is suggested that Headquarters arrange to apprise
HARVARD of any inquiries regarding Subject under his documented
name or any of the names listed in Attachment C.

_-1. References represent an initial misunderstanding of. f
the problén. of WIROGUE which is now being clarified.

7 -2< The problem of bickstopping of resettlenent ‘and

disposal’.cases ‘has been carefully reviewed by elements of CSB
concerted including CABETONE,; MKTOPAZ: and CATHINE,” In this
connection there is attached's copy of a monorandin dated 27
August-1963 from Chief/MKTOPA?-whicn: outlines the current ~
gituation. As willbe noted MRTOPAZ has and will expand its
capability ‘for procurement of operational docuneuts independent
of the 513th ICG. It 4s believed that the present procedures
for backstopping of resettlezent and disposal cases should be
continued, In theory an inderendent Capability is desirable
but not really practical at this time. Creation of an
independent capability for backstopping resettlement cases
would require duplication of the procedures and practices now -
followed by lr, Tillms of the $13tu ICG. In addition, wo would
not nave the advantage of hiding our cases from the Germans among:
other Army disposal cases. Furthernore, USAREUR has requested
notification prior to contact with any German officials of any
Sensitive cases which we may desire to handle without military
assistance--sce USAREUR letters dated 7 August 19€1 and 25 March
19€2, attached. ith considerable effort it would be possible
to backstop some of our resettlenent and disposal cases directly
with German officials, It would be quict difficult, however, to
prevent the Army fron learniag of such action which is contrary
to thé USAREUR request,

3. It 1s possible that the FEDREP will enact new
legislation on the control of non-Gernan refugees. Likewise,
new FEDREP emergency laws may affect this type of case. We will
keep this situation under review and in the event the circun-
stances change will..inittate appropriate action,

DS-964 HARVARD has learned through

have returned to the U.S, where
both have found employment. and are
‘ now apartment. hunting,

DS-984 At Subjects request HARVARD made
arrangements to obtain a duplicate
of. the deregistration form covering
Subject's tiove from Frankfurt: to
Neuss in July1962,

Subject and family are being assisted
in obtaining West German citizenship,

Subject's Communist Party membership

was discussed informally but at some
length with. the. local ODURGE chief. :
Since the latter believed that Subject's
membership would, according to the strict
interpretation of the law, be ruled
voluntary, processing for immigration to
the U.S. under Public Law 110 has been
requested,

‘* Resettled during ‘the reporting period. Subject will not appear
on next month's or subsequent HARVARD reports unless and until
some new unforeseen aspect of the case arises requiring additional

“oo +“. HARVARD action, In this event the case will be listed and the new

action described under Category I C,- . :

WIROGUE Subject's legend is being rewritten
Z and when finished will provide the
basis for-a more plausible political
recognition story, HARVARD hopes that
‘with the substitution of the new story
for the old, positive steps can be taken
for Subjects resettlement.

IDEN-264 The morale problem created by the slow
moving quota under which Subject is
registered for U.S, immigration has
required HARVARD to register her for
immigration under the Parolee Act. It
is expected that Subject will receive
her visa.in August or September but the
Parolee Act. will be used in the event the
