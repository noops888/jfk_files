\CKGROUND

®peration AUTRUNK III/IV which was mounted in August 1963 was
ecessful in that the two principals of the team, AMICE~-27
and AMICE-14, were able to contact aod to Tecruit two princi-
pal agents and several other action agents to lay the ground-
work fo> the MHAPRON objectives of the AUTRUNK Operation. One
of the two internal P/A's, AMTRUKK~9, vas oxfiltrated with the
four-man AXTRUNK infiltration seam for training and operstioza:
* discussions in the JMWAVE area. In early September, ANTRUNK-9
was re-infiltrated into PBRUMEN in Operation AMTRUNK Vv, the
: - Same operation which exfiltrated AMFAUNAS <1, -3, -13 and -34.
.) ° + Ip late October AKICE-27 was separated from the clandestine
a Part of the AMTRUNK operation. The original objectives of
Operation AHTRUNK VI, postponed from December 1963 to January
1964, were to revitalize and re-direct the efforts of the two
internal P/A's toward their primary task, i.e. to spot and re-
- eruit among high level figures who are dissatisfied with the
Castro regime. In late December, the scope of this mission was
. altered by the receipt of a commercial telegram in open code
from AMTRUNK-9 indicating that he was in grave danger and wished
to be exfiltrated. The twin objectives of Operation AMTRUNK VI
then becare: first, to exfiltrate AMTRUNK-~9 and, this accon-
“plished, for AMICE-14 to Proceed to Havana for his task of re~
channelling ANTRUNK-10's responsibilities. The exfiltration of eo
AXTRUNK-9, who brought with him his entire family consisting of :
: wife, brother-in-law, and three small children, was accomplished
-- 09 9 January 1964. The unexpected presence of AMTRUNE-9'
family, couple? with reports of increased vigilance in the infil-
tration area, forced AMICE~14 to extiltrate the same night with-
, out attempting to accomplish the second part of his mission.

4085 IV (23° 14' 00" N and 80° 47° 00" #, H. O. 2624).

The AMTRUNE IC will then proceed to the vicinity of coor-
G@inates 133511, AHS 4085 III. . At this point, AMICE-14 and/or
AMTRUNK-7 will make contact:with either Oscar DIAZ Jabiela~
Garcia or his son Antonio DIAZ Torres in Casualidac
(17654795, AMS 4085 III). These two individuals are knowl-
edgable of the fact that the AMTRUNKs may return to the in-
filtration area although they do not know even the approxi-
mate date. Oscar DIAZ and his son Antonio are prepared to .
activate the ratline consisting of three different taxis, to ‘
move AMICE-14 and AMTRUNK-13 into the Havana area. AMTRUNK-7

and -16, the team guides, and AMAGREE-1, the radio operator,

Once in Havana, AMICE-14 and AMTRUNEK-13 intend to split up -
and seek refuge in different nafehauses. They will maintain
contact with each other, however. ~*

AMICE-14's primary task vis-a-vis AMTRUNK-10 is to cement

the recruitment of AMTRUNK-10 and to obtain his full coopera-
tion to work toward MHAPRON objectives. In addition, AMICE-14
will teach AHTRUNK-10 an OWVL system and leave a receiver with
AMTRUNK-10. AKICE-14 also intends to give ANTRUNK-10 a review

E. Secondary tasks to be accomplished with AMTRUNK-10 are:

:
(1) To debrief him on his activities since AMICE-14
recruited him in August 1963. . -

(2) To collect operational information on other possi- ~
ble recruitment targets aisaanr) “

(3) To explore the possibilities of accommodating and
supporting an, infiltrated radio operator.

F. AMTRUNK-13 will attempt the recruitment of ,Jose Alberto
SEMIDEY_Inalgue, a close friend of AMTRUNK-13's for 18
years and a first cousin of AMICE~14. The following is
4 short biographical sketch of SEMIDEY:

@ 37-38 years old. Born in l the son of ee

iisttiiasat i a of the National * ”
Krny and veteran of the Snanish-American War. SEMIDEY

studied for one vear at University, [~~ |.
S from the second class 0:
in 1942. SEMIDEY flew for
and or

| about 11 years before he became
(| for the lacter company after the Revolution. After
was absorbed into Cubana, SEMIDEY held
various positions of importance in Cubana. He also holds
the rank of Captain in the Rebel Air Force and reportedly
has made reconnaisssace flights and black flights carrying
arms and/or agents to and from other Latin American
countries. SEMIDEY has a close friendship with Victor
PINA Cardoso, the Director of Civil Aviation, and is re=
portedly close to Raul CASTRO for whom he is a frequent ~
personal pilot. Because of the close former friendship
between ANTRUNK-13 and SEMIDEY and because of reports
ibaa ' from AMICE-14's family which indicate that SEMIDEY has
: become disenchanted with the Castro regine,. both AMTRUNK-1S
-, and AMICE-14 consider SEMIDEY a prime candidate for re-
cruitment.

_.G. If SEMIDEY should be out of the country on a flying trip
ia _. at the time of infiltration, AMTRUNX-13 will attempt to
set up contact with Commandante Rene de los SANTOS Ponce,
_ Who ig reportedly stationed in Las Villas Province with
a unit of "Lucha Contra Bandidos", an anti-counterrevolu-
tionary force. AMTRUNK-13 and de los SANTOS are friends
from boyhood and, for a period of 6 or 7 years, de lo:
SANTOS worked as an apprentice plumber for AMTRUNK~13

and -16 and AMAGREE-1 who will be waiting with the IC
in the mangroves in the vicinity of the inno at coor -
dinates 129498, AMS 4085 III. _

TIMETABLE .
The scheduled date for the infiltration of the AMTRUNK tean
at the DRP is 2200 hours, 7 February 1964. Th exfiltration
of the five team members with the AMTRUNK IC and rendezvous
with the mother, craft at the DRP is 2355 hours, 17 February,
with an alternate on 18 February. If exfiltration is not
successful on either of these dates, the radio operator will
be in contact with the base and contingent plans for exfil-
tration can be set up through this medium.
