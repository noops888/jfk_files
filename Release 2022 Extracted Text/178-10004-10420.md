responsible for Chapters 14, 15 and 18 of the
Report, on Watergate, domestic activities of the
Directorate of Operations and CIA file systems.’ -

aa Baker-Weidner Files. This team was responsible for
(‘ chapters 9, 10 and Il and the federal portion of 17 of the
* Report, on mail intercepts, inter-agency domestic intelli-
gence evaluation, CHAOS and CIA aid to other federal
agencies.

Olsen-Roethe Files. (O-R). This team was responsible
for Chapters 12, 13, 16 and 19 and the state and local portion
of 17, on the Office of Security, the Directorate of Science
and Technology, the Kennedy assassination and CIA assistance
to state and local agencies.

Gellhorn-Cargill-Hardy Files (G-C-H), This team was
