ARR8 Proposed Interpretive Regulation

Horace Speedjoins me in sending this response to your invitation to comment on the subject document. We have focused particularly on

subsections 1400.2 (page 3) and 1400.7 (page 4).

The requirement therein for release of all materials that contain names, cryptonyms, code names, pseudonyms, and aliases needs some

qualification consistent with the DCI's responsibility to protect assets of continuing national security value, liaison equities, and privacy

of U.S. citizens.

Beyond the above statutory concerns of the DCl, there is one that seemingly should be countenanced by the ARRB as a prospective

administrative burden on the ClA. That is the likely flow of FOlA requests from full release of such identification detail.

Why cant these considerations be recognized in the ARRB document as proper subjects of productive, responsible dialogue with the CIA?
