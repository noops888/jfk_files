‘SUBJECT: ARRB Proposed Interpretive Regulation

(Horace Speedljoins me in sending this response to your invitation to comment on the subject document. We have focused particularly on
‘subsections 1400.2 (page 3) and 1400.7 (gage 4).

The requirement therein for release of all materials that Contain names, cryptonyms, code names, pseudonyms, and aliases needs some
qualification consistent with the DCI's responsibility to protect assets of continuing national security value, liaison equities, and privacy
of U.S. citizens.

Beyond the above statutory concerns of the OCI, there is one that seemingly should be countenanced by the ARRB as a prospective
administrative burden on the CLA. That is the likely flow of FOIA requests from full release of such identification detail.
3 a aos agg =
Why cant these considerations be recognized in the ARRB document as proper subjects of productive, responsible dialogue with the CIA?
