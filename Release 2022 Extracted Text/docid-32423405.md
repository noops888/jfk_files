TESTIMONY OF AMLASH CASE OFFICER

AMLASH Ci Officer. Yes.

Mr. Johnston. Is that satisfactory to you?

AMLASH Case Officer. Yes.

Mr. Johnston. Now, you understand that at any time we

refer to your participation or your authorship of“axdocument or

| receipt of a document, we are prepared to substantiate the

reference that we are making, and we are not trying to avoid
proving the fact that it is indeed you that were involved in
the incident. It is simply because we were not able to use
your name.

AMLASH Case Officer. That's right.

Mr. Johnston. Now, you've previously testified before this
Committee, and I assume you've had a copy of the Committee
rules, and we have another copy available in case you want to
refer to them.

And are you appearing here voluntarily today without

| a counsel?

AMLASH Case Officer. Yes, I am.

Mr, Johnston. Do you understand that at any point during

| ends examination you are free to stop answering any questions

and request the advice of Counsel?

AMLASH Case Officer. I do.

Mr. Johnston. And do you understand as well that all your ;

constitutional rights are intact here before the Committee



Prone (Ares 202) 544-6000 275

including the Fifth Amendment rights to remain silent, if you
choose.

AMLASH Case Officer. I do.

Mr. Johnston. All right.

Let me state that the purpose of this interview is to

refine and clarify certain questions about the AMLASH operation.

It is my understanding that you were the case officer on

the AMLASH operation from the time period, say, of the first
of September on through, for all rejevant purposes, December 64,
and November '64, is that correct?

AMLASH Case Officer. That's right.

Mr. Johnston. At this time you were a member of what was
called the Special Affairs Staff, is that correct?

AMLASH Case Officer. That's right.

Mr, Johnston. And that's abbreviated SAS.

AMLASH Case Officer. Right.

me. Johnston. Would you describe your position in SAS

| and your relationship to Mr. Fitzgerald, who was chief of

SAS?

AMLASH Case Officer. I was a special assistant to Mc.
Fitzgerald, charged with the responsibility of attempting to~
organize a military coup inside Cuba against Fidel Castro.

Mr. Johnston. Did you report directly to Mr- Fitzgerald
on your work?

AMLASH Case Officer. Yes, I did.

Jeet, 5.6, Wasmsnaton, B.6. 70003

Mr. Johnston. Was there anyone el: knowledgeable in
SAS of what you were doing?

AMLASH Case Officer. Only the other people who were
involved working on the project.

Mr. Johnston. What was the relationship between ‘SAS and

the Western Hemisphere Division under, at that time, I believe,

Mr. J. C. King?

AMLASH Case Officer. I don't recall exactly what the
organizational relationship was at that time. I do know that
we operated on a somewhat -- I wouldn't say autonomous basis
from the Division itself, but the chain of command was certainly

from Mr. Fitzgerald, not necessarily through the Division

Chief, but up to the DDP at that time.

Mr. Johnston. Who was Mr. Helms.
AMLASH Case Officer. That's right.

Mr. Johnston. In other words, there could be direct

| reporting from Mr. Fitzgerald to Mr. Helms.

AMLASH Case Officer. Oh, yes.

Mr. Johnston. Is: it necessary that Mr. King was knowledgeableg

of all operations of SAS?

AMLASH Case Officer. Not necessarily. I don't know if he
was kept fully advised of all the operations or not.

Mr. Johnston. Did he know generally what you were doing?

AMLASH Case Officer, I presume he did, yes.

Mr. Johnston. And how often did he and Mr. Fitzgerald

meet to coordinate. They do coordination of their work?

AMLASH Case Officer. I don't know. I wasn't involved
in that part of it.

Mr. Johnston. Was SAS targeted directly at Cuba, or
were there other countries under its jurisdiction?

AMLASH Case Officer. No. SAS was strictly a task force
set up to deal with the Cuban problem

Mr. Johnston. And finally on this general matter, who

did -- who gave the counterintelligence support for SAS operatid

AMLASH Case Officer. We had a Counterintelligence Branch
within SAS.

Mr. Johnston. Who headed that in the fall of '63?

AMLASH Case Officer. I don't recall. There was a change
I don't recall the name.

Mr. Johnston. Let me -- as I stated earlier, you of

First of all, how and why was AMLASH first contacted to
set up the September meeting that you attended?

AMLASH Case Officer. He had been contacted the year beford
in Helsinki, and we found out at that time that he was coming
out to a sporting event in the Western Hemisphere, so we went

down and contacted him.

Mr. Johnston. In my review of the file -- and I don't thin)

we have the document here today, but my notes indicate there

was a cable from Langley to Rome on 19 June 1963, that is in

the AMLASH file.

that this was a sign to AMLASH that CIA was back in contact

with him or wanted to go back in contact with him?

We had contact with AMLASH from the

AMLASH Case Officer.

Right.

Mr. Johnston. Then he returned to Cuba.

AMLASH Case Officer.

And this was the first time,



the best of my knowledge, that he had come out from Cuba
since the Helsinki trip.

Mr. Johnston. 3h other words, you're not aware of any
prior contact between CIA or an intermediary and AMLASH?

AMLASH Case Officer. Not between that period of time.

Mr. Johnston. All right. You met with AMLASH in Brazil
on September 5th through 9th. I don't mean you specifically,
but the general meetings with AMLASH were in that time frame.

Is that your recollection?

AMLASH Case Officer. That's right.

Mr. Johnston. Do you recall seeing a cable, or receiving
instructions from headquarters to the effect ~~ and this is
after your series of meetings -- instructions to the effect
that headquarters felt that AMLASH appeared hopeless as an
intelligence performer, and should be approached as a chief
conspirator allowed to recruit his own cohorts. He should

be urged to recruit a few trusted friends to assist him

| and more serious matters on a more orderly basis.

Do you recall seeing something to that effect after your

i Brazil meetings with him?

AMLASH Case Officer. I don't specifically recall the cabld

itself, but certainly that would be in line with the thinking

| at that time.

If I may state, he was not considered a controlled asset,

shall wa say, and it was somebody with whom we felt that we
could collaborate in organizing the internal group.

Mr.Johnston. But my summary of the cable would indicate
that on\September 9th, or after your meetings in Brazil, you

think of him as a gatherer of information, but
as someone who Wanted to go on to other things, as a
conspirator of some

Mr. Johnston. The file‘also has a-document in it, the

the document, it's a conversation of an intercept in th

name. I have sanitized this -- "Moreno. It is either a
tremendous secret or a top secret matter." And then there is an
unreadable portion, and then a word either "treason" or
“reason" I'm not sure what is referred to, and then a partici-
pant whose name is Betty says, "I believe it is a top secret
"matter."

My question to you is, did you, in September of '63, know

ee
xo)

$10 Furst Street, S.€., Warminuion, OC.

AMLASH Case Officer, I don't specifically recall today
that I would have known about it. I Presume if we had it in
file, that I was working with it, that I would have seen it.
Mr. Johnston, Do you have any information about any recollec-
tion about something on this order?
AMLASH Case Officer. No.
Mr. Johnston. And assume that at least the portion I

quoted seems to reflect on the Cubans’ view of AMLASH's

| activities in Paris,

AMLASH Case Officer. Yes, it may have. As I recall, I

think that he was also at that time -- I may be wrong, and we

would have to go back to the files to check, but he was rather

outspoken to some of his closer friends in the fact that he was
no longer happy with the revolution, with Castro.
Mr. Johnston. I don't want to dwell on this, if you don't ,

have a recollection, but this conversation seems to indicate

that the employees in the [Suan embassy Jehink that AMLASH is
yban~embass:

there on a top secret mission.

AMLASH Case Officer. Probably so because of his independent

“ way of comportment. He didn't answer to anybody.

Senator Schweiker. What was his role in government at

that point?

AMLASH Case Officer. Ne was -- excuse me, this must have

| been '63, He was a personal representative of Castro to the

games, first in Brazil, and I don't think he had a specific

| group and a Communist group, and that he acts as a moderator

post in '63, as I recall. He had been Deputy Minister of
Interior. He had been a military attache in spain. I don't think

he had a specific post at «that time.

\
\

Excuse me, if I may add just one more point. Before that he
|

1

had been President of the Student Federation at the university
of Havana. We may still have been in that post, or about the
time that he was getting out of it, and this is, I think, where

i
really the trouble between this particular fellow and the Castro,
brothers more or less came to ahead.

Mr. Johnston. On the 19th of September, Jim Wave sent a
message to headquarters pasically warning, giving a warning,
making the statement that there was an anti-Communist group in

i

Cuba, and the name AMLASH is part of that group, and it concluded

by saying that Fidel is allegedly aware of both the anti-Communist

between them in order to maintain cohesion in the government of!

, Cuba.

po you recall receiving that information?

AMLASH Case Officer, T don’t recall specifically receiving
that information, but I do recall that at that time Fidel
castro himself was talking about ~~ was concerned about 3

Communist takeover of the revolution, and he did meet with the

* subject and some other friends of his in order to prevent this.

Mr. Johnston. When was this?

AMLASH Case officer. This was in the early ‘60s sometime.



Senator Schweiker. What year were you in?

Mr. Johnston. '63-

AMLASH Case Officer. This was before '63. This must have !
been in '62.

Mr, Wallach. This is before his trip to the Soviet
union?

Mr. Johnston. Before castro's trip?

Mr. Wallach. Right.

AMLASH Case Officer. Yes-

MR. Johnston. The question being put is after your
meeting in Brazil with AMLASH, Jim Wave cabled headquarters that

AMLASH was part of a group of anti-Communist Cuban government

leaders and that Castro was aware of that fact.

AMLASH Case Officer. My answer to you is that he certainly
was because he had been talking with these people, including
AMLASH, a year before. Yes.

senator Schweiker. Castro was aware that he was anti-
Communist?

AMLASH Case Officer. Yes, that he was one of the anti-
Communist grouP-

senator Schweiker. Why would he be so trusted and be the

special representative at that point in time if he war known

tut. wasmnaten, DC. 2000

as anti-Communist?

AMLASH Case officer. Because of the relationship with

Axo Honan Street

Castro. Castro himself had not declared his Communist, more OF



410 Firat Street, S.E.. Washington, ©.C. 20003

less intentions, as of that time.

Senator Schweiker, Wait, this was after the Cuban missile
crisis. This was '63, and the Cuban missile crisis was '62.
I'm confused here.

AMLASH Case Officer. Let's go hack to the dates here.

Senator Schweiker. The Jim Wave date is September 1963,
and he knows at this point, allegedly now, that this AMLASI
was a member of an anti-Communist group. I have trouble
reconciling that with not pinpointing AMLASH and his possible
subversive agent. I think that is what Jim is getting to.

AMLASH Case Officer. Again, my answer is I don't know
specifically why or what the origin of the '63 J. M. Wave
cable was.

My answer again to the question is that Castro, from his

previous knowledge, going back to '62, did know and had consulted

with this group of people of which AMLASH was one, who were the
group of Anti-Communist officers in the revolution.

Mr. Johnston. So --

AMLASH Case Officer. I don't know why in ‘63 this report
would have come dut, but it would confirm Castro's knowledge
of this group, yes.

Mr. Johnston. Let me move on into October, There was a
meeting with AMLASH.

Senator Schweiker. How long did he tolerate anti-Communist

j
{
officers in high positions in his government? I've got to



wane a PAUL

“a0 Fist Street, S:E., Watnurgton, 0.6. 20003

believe there's some cutoff here. 1 realize the uniqueness and
broadness of his support earlier, but it would just seem to me
that at some point he really had to weed out, nottnecessarily
weed out or be suspect of anti-Communist officers who had too
high decision making in his government, would he not, or am L
missing something?

AMLASH Case Officer. Noy not really, because out of this
group that was mentioned, and with whom he himself discussed
the need in the early ‘603 to keep, SaYy the Communists out,
some of those officers are still in his goverment today.

Now, they may have changed, or Castro may have changed, but

he didn't purge all this group of officers. Maybe he won them

over, and if they are still there, evidently he has some

confidence in them.
ur. Johnston. According to the file, there was a meeting on
October 5th, apparently, in Paris, and I'm not sure that you wene

the case officer at that meeting, and the cable from Paris

sets the tone of that meeting as AMLASH apparently was trying

to get things off his chest in talking to you.

Were you the case officer at that meeting?

AMLASH Case Officer, I was the case officer during that
period of time.

Go into a little of the detail because we did talk about
these problems.

Mr. Johnston. There appeared from the file two meetings



wane a PAUL

410 First Stveat, S.E., Washington, 0.¢. 20003

in early October 1963, the first meeting on dr about October
Sth that AMLASH comes in and says I want to get things off my
chest, and seems to express great dissatisfaction with the
CIA's position.

Then there's a second meeting on October 13th or so where
he specifically asks to meet with Robert Kennedy, and you
previously testified about that second meeting.

AMLASH Case Officer, Yes.

Mr. Johnston. Now, the file indicates there was an
earlier meeting on October Sth, and AMLASH was complaining
apparently about the low level espionage matters that had been

discussed in Brazil, and implying that he had a more valuable

role to play, and the file says the case officer provided the

necessary assurances that his feelings were not in fact
true, and that his case was receiving the consideration at
the highest levels.

With this problem which had undoubtedly been bothering
AMLASH off his chest, a much more relaxed AMLASH departed,
stating his desire to return to Cuba to undertake the big
job.

Do you recall that meeting?

AMLASH Case Officer. I think you are getting those two
meetings mixed up. In other words, the later one, yes. I
was there and talking to him in the second meeting. In the

first meeting I don't recall precisely, but there could have



|Ai0 First Street, S.€., Washington, 0.C. 20003

been a meeting with a contact in Paris, in other words, not a
case officer, but the contact we had in Paris. I don't remember
who that was, one of the officers there. H
Mr. Johnston. In addition to you he was in contact with ~~
AMLASH Case Officer. Only for purposes of contact. I mean,
only to make contact with me, not to carry on the case. But
he knew that the other officer was a friend of mine, and he

was in touch with him, and when he came to Paris he would get

in touch with him, So I would be notified.

Mr. Johnston. I amie you have used his name in the
prior cronseriot SG ohEE the case officer?

AMLASH Case Officer. Yes, because he was the one who
furnished the quarters where we had the meetings.

Mr. Johnston. In furnishing the quarters, did you have a

taping system going as to the discussions that would take placed

AMLASH Case Officer. No, I don't believe we taped any of
those meetings?

Mr. Johnston. Is it procedure to tape meetings with
Agents?

AMLASH Case Officer. Sometimes. It is not a standard
procedure. Sometimes it is not physically possible.

Mr. Johnston. Let me go back into this meeting of October !
Sth, which you don't recall that you were at this meeting, is
that correct?

AMLASH Case Officer. There probably could have been the



meeting when he first arrived in Paris, and the meeting that he

had -- I don't recall specifically.

I do recall, if I mayr 1 do recall that he said he was
unhappy because of the rcjuirements, the intelligence require-
ments that we had levied on him in Brazil, and it +s true that
his position was at that time, even in Brazil, and later in
paris, that he was not disposed to cooperate just to furnish

intelligence. In other words, he felt that he wanted to do

something about the removal of Castro but was not just prepared
to keep us advised as to what was going on. He recognized that

this was certainly part of a needed operation, but he did not

consider himself just as a provider of information.
Mr. Johnston, Let me go off the record for a minute

because I want to use 4 code name.

(Discussion off the record.)

Mr. Johnston. Having mentioned the code name that is

used in this cable, you now recall you were at the 5 October
meeting?

AMLASH Case Officer. Yes.

Mr. Johnston. And the cable, you can look at it, indicates ©

that AMLASH was in a confessional mood. *

., washington, O.€. 20003

My question to you is, after recalling that meeting, was
it basically one where he was expressing his concern about

the CIA role for him?

Mr, Johnston. He was expressing nis concern for what?



wane a PAUL

‘aro Fst Street, S.6., Washungton, O.C, 20003

Mr. Johnston. The CIA's plans for using him,

AMLASH Case Officer, Yes. He was concerned as to how and
in what way he was to cooperate with CIA. He was also -- and
we must underline this, right from the beginning, dubious
as to our resolve to really follow through on initiating a
coup against Castro.

Mr. Johnston. Is the cable correct in stating that he was
assured that his case was receiving consideration at the
highest levels?

AMLASH Case officer. Yes-

Mr. Johnston. Was the word “highest level" used, Or was
a name used?

AMLASH Case Officer. Highest levels, but at that stage

of the game he knew he was talking to CIA, so highest levels
in CIA is what was meant at that particular time.

Mr. Johnston. That's the word you used?

You didn't say Director McCone?

AMLASH Case Officer. T did not use names, no-

Mr. Johnston. On October Sth, you reassured him that his
consideration, that his case was receiving consideration at
least at the highest levels of CIA, and the cable reflects
that when he left that meeting he seemed much more relaxed about
the case.

Is that an accurate portrayal of the meeting?

AMLASH Case officer. That's right.



wane a PAUL

810 Fiest Street, S.€., Washington, D.C. 20003

Mr. Johnston. As I mentioned; there was another meeting

on or about October 13th, where, as I understand it, AMLASH
made his demand or his request to meet with Robert Kennedy, and
he made that request to meet with Kennedy by name.

Is that correct?

AMLASH Case Officer. Yes, he did.

Well, he said somebody such as, somebody high in the
administration, again, to receive the assurances that we were
prepared to -- that we were serious about developing and
organizing a coup.

Mr. Johnston. After that meeting, you were recalled to
Langley for discussions, is that correct?

AMLASH Case Officer. I was traveling back and forth
between Paris and Langley, yes. I don't recall if I was
recalled at that particular time, but I would go there -- I
was TDY.

Mr. Johnston, I want to set the stage. There is a
message from the Director, 75693, to London, directing you to
return to headquarters for discussion of all facets of the
case.

This.is after you reported that AMLASH wants to meet
with someone like Robert Kennedy.

Do you recall that flow of events?

AMLASH Case Officer. Yes.

Mr. Johnston. What discussions did you have at Langley,

:

410 Fiewt Street, S.€., Washington, 0.€. 20003

but basically are we correct in understanding that out of the
discussions at Langley came a decision to go to Paris with

Mr. Fitzgerald representing himself as 4 personal representative
of Robert Kennedy?

AMLASH Case Officer, That's right.

Mr. Johnston. Then you met on October 29, according: to
the file, with AMLASH, Mr, Fitzgerald, in Paris,

Is that correct?

AMLASH Case Officer, Excuse me. Can I go off the
record?

(Discussion off the record.)

Mr. Wallach. I think you stated that AMLASH said that he
would like to meet with one of the U.S. leaders such as
Robert Kennedy?

AMLASH Case Officer. A high representative in the U.S.
Government.

Mr. Wallach. Did he mention any other names that you
recall?

AMLASH Case Officer. No, not that I recall,

Mr. Wallach. Just Robert Kennedy?

AMLASH Case Officer. Such as Robert Kennedy.

Mr. Wallach. Did AMLASH, to the best of your knowledge,
from what he told you, know about any prior assassination

attempts that had been run by the U.S.?



Wane & PAUL,

410 Fest Street, S.€., Washington, 0.C. 20002

AMLASH Case Officer.

Mr. Wallach. Did he have any reason to believe that Robert
Kennedy had been involved with any of the sabotage operations
as contrasted with any assassination attempts?

AMLASH Case Officer, If he knew, he never mentioned it to
me. Wa never discussed that.

Mr. Wallach, In other words, you didn't say to him,
how did you know that Robert Kennedy -- or why did you pick
Robert Kennedy.

AMLASH Case Officer. No, not at all. I mean, it's a
perfectly, I think, logical name to have been mentioned at
that time, because by him, since he was the President's brother |
and since he was the Attorney General, he wanted somebody high
in the Government; at one time he had mentioned the President,
you know, I want to talk to the President.

Mr. Wallach, It seems strange to me he didn't pick the

Secretary of State or someone like that.

AMLASH Case Officer. No.

Mr, Wallach, What I'm trying to get at --

AMLASH Case Officer. He wanted somebody directly to the
President. In other words, he wanted the assurances
from the highest authority, again, from the President of
the United States.

Mr. Wallach. What I'm trying to get at is we, from our

examination of the alleged assassination attempts, have also



MONGOOSE, ete, and found out

that Bobby Kennedy did play 4 role in the sabotage attempts.

What I'm trying to get from you is your understanding of
whether or not.AMLASH, from his Cuban side, knew that the
Xennedy's had played that role and would necessarily say I want
to talk to Robert Kennedy for that reason.

AMLASH Case Officer. No. He never mentioned it, not at
all in any way.

Mr. Johnston. Let me finally go to the October 29th meeting,
and before we went on the record this morning, you were
explaining to us how you characterized the AMLASH operation.

Would you repeat in summary form what you told us before

we went on the record?

AMLASH Case Officer. The operation was never conceived,
certainly, carried out during the period I was associated with
it, but was never conceived as an assassination plot. It was
conceived as a coup in order to organize a military group
within Cuba to overthrow Castro.

Mr. Johnston. Did you have the understanding that if

necessary AMLASH was proposing to assassinate the Castro
brothers?

AMLASH Case Officer. Assassination was not a subject of
discussion that came up at every meeting or contact that we

had with AMLASH. It was 80 stated by him that he felt that

410 First Steeet, SE. Wa

the only way to initiate a coup in Cuba was to direct the



WARD @ PAUL

Ax0 Fst Street, S-€., Washington, D.C. 20003

first blow at the

Since we were not Willing to discuss specifically eliminating
Castro, this was never discussed in terms of the operation.
We certainly had no doubt that in his mind this was the only
way to go about it.

Mr. Johnston. And you dealt with him on that basis?

AMLASH Case Officer. Trying to temporize this, and if
possible we were not looking-for a bloody coup at that time,
planning a bloody coup inside Cuba, but we were trying to
certainly get him to think in terms of much more than just the
elimination of the leadership.

Mr. Johnston. And to broaden it.

AMLASH Case Officer. To broaden it into a coup. Our
interest was the coup, not the specifics of how he got it
started.

Mr. Johnston. You- were. concerned about whether his
plans were realistic, weren't you?

AMLASH Case Officer. Very definitely, yes.

Senator Schweiker. _ did you personally evaluate AMLASH

as fully capable of leading a coup and being able to implement

dt and carry it out if support were given?

How did you evaluate AMLASH?

As I understand from the dialogue here, and also from
reading a summary of these, at first the operations talk was

fairly low level sabotage, which he out of hand rejected, and



wamo a PAUL,

410 First Strest, S.E., Wasnington, O.C. 20003

condition that it had assurances of government support and top
level support here.

Now, I guess my question to you is, how, as case officer,
did you evaluate his capability? Did you evaluate him as
someone who could lead a coup and who would, that our government|
could put trust in, faith in in terms of his ability to carry it
out or not?

AMLASH Case Officer. At that time we did not evaluate
him as the leader of a coup. He was not our candidate to be
the next ruler of Cuba. He was only evaluated in our dealings
with him on the basis of what he and his group could contribute
to a coup inside Cuba.

So I don't recall at any time that he was selected or that /
anybody ever talked of him as the next leader in Cuba.

Mr. Baron. Wasn't there some thought that he would be a
good rallying point for strong leaders of a new government in |
Cuba, that he had an ability to attract good people to work wit
him? |

AMLASII Case Officer. He had proven this because he had i

been one of the two leaders, or the two top leaders of the

pirectorado Revolutionario, which is the Revolutionary Directordte
i

which is a group not part of the 26th of July Movement, but a |
|

separate group, which is -- he was one of the leaders, and

became a military commander of that group, separate from the 26"

of July movement.

So he had a group in the DR which we knew about, and he
afforded himself very well in the fighting -- this was in the
province of Lasvillas, during the time that Castro was -- he
was in a separate area of the country.

Mr, Baron. I had a recollection which I haven't checked
against our transcripts that when we discussed this before,
you had said although AMLASH might not be considered the leader
of a new government, that he was a potential candidate for that
job. He might not be a good military leader, but he would have
an ability to bring good people together in a new government.

AMLASH Case Officer. Of the people left in Cuba at that tin
we didn't have much of a choice. I mean, you know, we weren't
din contact. He was one of the few who could travel.

Senator Schweiker. You put him up near the top but not
necessarily at the top.

AMLASH Case Officer. That's right, as one being able to }
contribute.

Senator Schweiker. And you didn't have too many options
at that point.

AMLASH Case Officer. That's right.

Mr. Johnston. One of the documents that CIA previously
provided us in a sanitized version is a memorandum for the
record dated 19 November 1963, and the subject is Plans for

AMLASH Contact, and let me :just show you that and ask you



arily prepared that document

sanitized document, but whether you prepared a document
that that apparently came from, the memorandum for record of
November 19th.
AMLASH Case Officer. Yes, I recall.
Mr. Johnston. You prepared that document?
AMLASH Case Officer. I believe I prepared the memorandum
which that extract was made, yes-
Mr. Johnston. When did you prepare that?
AMLASH Case Officer. It had to be late October sometime.
Mr, Johnston. November 19th is the date.
AMLASH Case Officer. Early November, certainly after

my October meeting with him in Paris, and before going back,

wane @ rauL

19 November, that's probably it.

Mr. Johnston. Is that the date you prepared it?

AMLASH Case Officer. That's the date I prepared it. I

don't remember when I returned from Paris after the October-
meetings.

Mr. Johnston. You prepared a memorandum for the record
on the contact before you went to the meeting in Paris on
November 22nd?

AMLASH Case Officer. Oh, yes.

Mr. Johnston. Part of that document, Paragraph 3, states

that you would show AMLASH a copy of the president's speech in

Mr. Johnston. Let me show you Paragraph 3 of that.
They were talking about leading up to the November 22nd

meeting with AMLASH,

I talked to him about it, but I don't recall ‘having shown: him
the speech, But it was probably clear that I could have taken
a copy of that speech to him and shown it to him.

Mr. Johnston, Paragraph 4 of that document states ~~~
would you just read it?

AMLASH Case Officer. "Chief SA has requested written
reports on AMLASH operation be kept to & minimum.”

Mr. Johnston. And that's Desmond Fitzgerald, is that
correct?

AMLASH Case Officer. That's correct.

Mr. Johnston, Did Mr. Fitzgerald tell you that on
November 19th?

AMLASII Case Officer. It might not have been the first
time he mentioned this because ~~ in other words, on sensitive
operations it was always a case of trying to limit the number

of people aware of sensitive operations and this certainly is

considered in that category.

He reiterated, I presume, since I put it in the memo at
that time that the written communications would be minimized.

Mr. Johnston. And this is a memorandum for record.

AMLASH Case Officer. Remember also this is primarily the
cables because I had to communicate with headquarters and the

station in Paris. TI didn't have my independent communications.

Mr. Johnston, Where we

AMLASH Case Officer. At headquarters. He told me this
personally.

Mr. Johnston. Okay, Is it normal to prepare a memorandu
for the record about plans for contact"of an agent?

AMLASH Case Officer. Normally, yes.

Mr. Johnston. So there's nothing unusual in your prepari
this memorandum for record. Is that your testimony?

AMLASH Case Officer. No, there wasn't anything unusual
about it. That's the usual thing unless advised to the contrary’.

Mr. Johnston, The last time you testified before the
| committee you mentioned on November 22nd you had a pen-like
device with a hypodermic needle on it. This memorandum for
record of November 19th does not mention that.

Is there some reason that it doesn't?

AMLASH Case Officer. No, I don't remember why it would

Mr. Johnston. I think that's correct.

RALASH Case Officer. I don't know if the decision hac

been made that we would even show him something like this

‘i that time.

Nr, Johnston, You're talking about the 19th?
AMLASH Case Officer. About the 19th, when I wrote the

memorandum,

A10 Fiat Street, 5.€.. Wasminuton, O.¢. 20003

Mr. Johnston.” When you left tor Paris my understanding i
is that you carried the device. :
AMLASH Case Officer. That's right, I carried it with me.
Mr. Johnston. And you had --approval to show it to hin?
AMLASH Case Officer. I had approval to show it to him.
Mr, Johnston, The file indicates that AMLASH was contactkd
on November 20th; I believe, in order to set up the Novenber
22nd meeting and he was telephoned by, I assume, somebody in i
Paris.

Did you arrange that or were you knowledgeable of that

AMLASH Case Officer. Yes. I was going to go there to
see him. We would have made arrangements to set the meeting up.

Mr. Johnston. The cable reporting the telephone call on

|

November 20th states that somebody apparently was in the room

with AMLASH when he was telephoned, and that therefore there

had to be a telephone conversation by the CIA agent calling H

him and the CIA agent -~ !
Pardon me. AMLASH asked if the meeting would be of interest

to. him, and the CIA agent said, I don't know if it!s going to

be of interest to you but it's the meeting you requested. And

I ask you your understanding of what was meant by the meeting

that you requested?

AMLASH Case Officer. Probably to give him an answer on

the caches that he wanted inside Cuba, and I understand that way

of this at the previous meeting with Pitzgerald, so were we
going to give him that materials In other words, it was given |
to him later in the caches, was that material going to be given
to him?

Mr. Johnston. What about the pen device? i

AMLASH Case Officer, The pen device was something again,:
it could have been part of that package. I don't think he was
specifically asking about the pen device because we had been
so reluctant to even discuss something like this with him and
he knew it that he was primarily concerned with the caches.

Mr. Johnston. Is it correct to say that at the October
29th meeting AMLASH was happy with the U.S. policy but asking
for equipment to do the job?

AMLASII Case Officer. To initiate the coup.

In other words, he didn't want a massive amount of
equipment but he said we do need some equipment to get the
thing started.

Mr. Johnston. And that that was in his mind on November

AMLASH Case Officer. When he made the call?

Mr. Johnston. When the call was made to him and he was

i told that the November 22nd meeting was the one that he had

requested,

AMLASH Case Officer. Probably so.

AMLASII Case Officer, To nee what could be given to him,

what we were prepared to tel. him at the 22 November meeting.

Mr. Johnston. “As you said before, you were at Langley
on the 20th, There's a table indicating you left Washington
arriving in Paris on the morning of November 22nd.

AMLASH Case Officer. No, I took the necessary precautions

in going to the meeting to assure myself. I didn't, have somebody

else following me to tell.me if I had any surveillance on me.
Mr. Johnston, What about AMLASH? !
AMLASII Case Officer. We don't know, I don't know if !
he was counter-surveilled. |
Senator Schweiker. Could AMLASII have been a double agent?
AMLASH Case Officer. That's a good question. I can only
give you an opinion. I didn't think so then and even with
everything that has happened today, I don't think so today.
Again, that is strictly my opinion.
Senator Schweiker, In a nutshell, and I realize this is |
avery difficult, complex area, why don't you think so?
AMLASH Case Officer, Because of the power play that
was taking place in Cuba at that time between certainly the
26th of July people and Castro trying to consolidate his
position, this was the early 'G0s now, around his people and
his movement, the fact that we had information from several
sources that he was disillusioned with the revolution.
Senator Schweiker. le, meaning AMLASI?
AMLASH Case Officer. We, AMLASH, was disillusioned.

Senator Schweiker. And he wasn't in the 26th of July?

AMLASH Case Officer. le was not in the 26th of July.

He was one of the other revolutionary groups which had student
support primarily and urban support and compared to castro's
rural so-called support.

So there was a struggle going on there. In other words,

this was not an imaginary type of thing. The background that

time lead us to pelieverin our relation with him at that time

that he was playing a double game.

we could check did not, to the best of my recollection at any |
i
\
|

The other reason that I felt that way at the time was that
we had to persuade him to return to Cuba to stay. He was ;
ready to defect, to leave. He didn't want to come to the
united States with all the rest of the Cubans who were here
because he had stayed on, he felt, too long with the revolution.
But he was ready to leave Cuba and to defect. He was fed up
with the way life was. A lot of the travel that he did was
that he would take any opportunity to get off of the island.
te had told us, me personally, that and this was also confirmed
by other sources.

senator Schweiker. Wouldn't one of your reasons also
be that he is in jail now?

AMLASH Case Officer. That would be a very good reason.

I think I mentioned that the last time, certainly when I was
talking about this. If he was taken back --

“Jai. now??
AMLASH Case Officer.;: ecked that T'believe the last
time, I think the last report we had was what, a couple of
years ago? : :

Mr. Baron, I was given’ the name of a CIA contact in
Florida who had been on the Island of Pides 2t one point and
said as far as he knew, although he hadn't been in cuba for
several years, AMLASH was a prisoner, but he wasn't in’ prison.

He was doing some sort of hospital work which was considered

part of his rehabilitation program,

AMLASH Case Officer. He was a doctor, wasn't he, (for
the prison?
Mr. Baron. Yes,

AMLASH Case Officer. We had more freedom because he
was being used as a doctor for the prisoner but he still was
still on the Isle of Pines.

Baron. It is my understanding that he was working

Mr.
as a doctor even outside the prison and again, this is just
hearsay of one contact that I called on the phone.

Mr. Wallach. Are you positive that someone just not
using his name is there, that he switched over using an alias?
You wouldn't have intelligence of that type?

AMLASH Case Officer. No.
Mr. Wallach. I want to quickly follow-up on somethin:

that Jim and the Senator were getting at.



wano a Au

810 First Steedt, S.E., Wasninaton, O.C, 20003

AMLASH.Case officer. We?

Mr. Wallach. You have told us -~

AMLASM Case Officer. We were very reluctant to discuss
the subject.

Mr. Wallach, Why?

AMLASH Case Office. I guess we didn't want to get ‘mvonwpe

in assassinations. H

Mr. Wallach. But you had them before this.

AMLASII Case Officer. I didn't know this, and certainly
in this operation the objective of this operation was not to
go in and assassinate Castro but a much bigger type of program.

Mr. Wallach. But that was the first step, or at least
the potential first step.

AMLASH Case Officer. He was convinced that was the only
first step. AMLASII, We weren't convinced: that it had to be,
at that time that it had to be the first step, and that's why
we didn't want to discuss and we didn't discuss and we were
reluctant to discuss this subject with him.

Mr, Wallach. At the late October meeting I think you
said before that -- what did you request that led to the giving

him of the pen, the hypodernic needle?

AMLASH Case Officer, The pen he requested was something

with which to protect himself now.



r76000M oa13

sage a gee pee

himself?

AMLASH Case Officer. He put himself in a situation and
asked us the question, He said I may be confronted by Castro
or by Raoul or by one or the other of Castro's people ina
meeting in which I am not armed, and I may be confronted with
an accusation of plotting against the regime,

And at that time he said this would be before we are
ready to move in foxmenting the coup, and he-said, I would like
to have something with which I can protect myself at that time.
In‘ fact, the words that I think I mentioned here before was,

if I fall, I don't want to be the only one going down.

So he was seeing himself in a situation of going back into

Cuba, of being in a meeting in which he could have been, because,
again, of the relationships. Fidel Castro himself or Raoul
Castro could confront him in their office, accuse him.

Nr. Wallach. Couldn't he use that pen offensively and

| not defensively?

AMLASH! Case Officer. Yes, he could have. He was not

, | at that time talking about using it offensively and we weren't

j
I discussing the offensive use of that pen.

Senator Schweiker. Following up the point that I

| switched away from as to whether Cuban intelligence might have

been trailing him or following him or observing what you were

doing with him, we have some knowledge, I gather, from a summary

be Cuban intelligence.
If this 1s correct, wouldn't that pretty well mean that

whatever he was doing over there might well be observed by

Cuban intelligence even though he might have been a straight
single agent in terms of working with us and not a double agent
that they may well have known or monitored what in fact he was
doing with us?

AMLASH Case Officer, This is possible, Senator. We
had no indication at the time that they were monitoring his
activities. again, he was at such a level and the people

certainly in Paris and the Cubans overseas knew that he was

wane a PAUL

at such a level that we never heard that they were ever given
this mission.

Senator Schweiker. Have you heard that his Cuban
mistress was’ working. with. Cuban intelligence?

AMLASII Case Officer. Which one of his mistresses,

| because he's had several, including his sister who worked for
the Presidency, his own sister.

Mr. Johnston. We extracted that from a file and I'm
sorry but in the respect and the need to keep that information
compartmented I did not take her name down and I don't think wc

have the file that indicates that.

AMLASI! Case Officer. I don't recall the specific case,
but let me remind you that he was the Deputy Minister of
the Interior, which did have the security services at that time
under that ministry. So it wouldn't surprise me that there would]
be somebody he would know in that ministry.

Mr. Johnston. AMLASII was?

AMLASH Case Officer. AMLASII was at one time before .he
was President of the Student Federation.

Mr. Johnston, Not in '63?

AMLASH Case Officer. No,

Senator Schweiker. And Cuban intelligence would have
come under him?

AMLASH Case Officer. Some of the security apparatus
was under the Ministry of Interior, but he was in that job,

I don't recall, a very short period of time.

Mr, Wallach. I£ Castro knew about the assassination
attempts, you would assume that AMLASI would have known, wouldn't
you, from being in that position?

AMLASH Case Officer. We don't know if at that time that
he knew that -- well, he was saying, in other words, he was on
the radio every day saying that the Yankees were making an

attempt on his life but that he knew the specifics of operations

T don't. think we-have n nation, or at least I never

After the Bay of Pigs every occasion that he had he would
accuse the imperialists of mounting another operation against
him.

Mr. Baron. Just a couple more questions on this point.
Did you take any special precautions aside from the Standard
precautions that you would take in dealing with any foreign

contact?

Were special precautions taken in dealing with AMLASII
to guard against the prospect that he was either a double agent |
or under surveillance by Cuban intelligence?

AMLASI! Case Officer. What would you mean by special
precautions?

Mr. Baron. You would have to tell me more about the
techniques that you could use, than I could tell you.

AMLASH Case Officer. What I would do is to make sure
that I wasn't under surveillance in going to the meeting or
at the meeting, and we would certainly check the meeting places |
to make sure that the meeting places were not under surveillanca
by them, which would adso hopefully would have picked up in
the surveillance that he would have had on him coming to the
meetings.

in Paris, which would have meant disclosing our interest in him

either to. a team'or the Prench police, ‘or whoever

So wa never did that. because, again, of our interest in
protecting and minimizing the number of people who knew we were
in cantact with him,

Again, I refer you, I think, to what the Senator raised
before, that he was arrested and sentenced, and as I recall,

I may he wrong but as I recall the contacts that we had with
him in Paris never surfaced in that trial. le never, as far
as the transcript that we have of the trial, he never reported, '
he never testified about the contacts that he had with us.

It was only afterwards when he was in contact with the exile
group.

Mr. Baron. So you never took any affirmative action
against him or investigated him or treated him in any way that
you would treat a person suspected of being a double agent.
or being closely watched by an intelligence service?

AMLASH Case Officer. Not. in mounting an investigation
against him because in doing that we would have to show our
interest in him to other people, so we did not do that.

What we could do with myself and with the other knowlecgd-
able people say in Paris,of him,we did do and did everything |
we possibly could do.

; In other words, to check where he was and who he was
seeing and through the telephone taps and to ensure that when

he came to meet us that that meeting was secure,



410 Feew Street. $.£., Washington, ©.€, 20003

that we did,

Mr. Johnston. Let me go back to the November 22nd

meeting.

As you recall, afteruyou met. AMLASH there, did you give
him the newspaper article about the Kennedy speech?

AMLASH Case Officer. I don't recall. I may have shown
him the article. To the best of my recollection, we talked about
the speech and he had, I think, at that. time, the article had
already appeared in the French newspaper and he had read it.

Mr. Johnston. What did you tell him about the article?

AMLASH Case Officer. Well, he liked the article. It
was one in which I think the Administration, as I vaguely recall
was taking a rather positive stand.

Mr. Johnston. Was this Kennedy's speech before the

Inter-American Press Association in Miami on November 18th?

AMLASI Case Officer. I believe so.

Mr, Johnston. I have an extract from that.

AMLASII Case Officer, I'm not 100 percent certain, but
I think it was,

Mr, Johnston. There's an indication that you told him
that Fitzgerald helped to write the speech.

Do you recall doing that?

WALASH Case Officer. I could have.

Mr, Johnston, Do you recall specifically?

AMLASII Case Officer. Specifically, no, but



WARD & PAUL

Mr. Johnston. eo fied a great deal about the

poisbn pen or the pen device and my only question is what is
your best recollection about what happened to the pen? Did
he take it with him? Did you take it with you when you left
the meeting?

,AMLASH Case Officer. Again, as I mentioned to you the
last time, I don't remember specifically if I kept the pen and
threw it away or if he kept it.

What I do remember,was his reaction when I showed him
the pen. I can't today tell you for sure that he kept the
pen.

Mr. Johnston. It seems to me that's rather compromising
evidence, if he kept the pen and you recall that. It's also
such compromising evidence -- I have difficulty believing you
would have thrown it away.

AMLASII Case Officer. Yes, because it was compromising
evidence. I had carried ‘it one way. I mean I wasn't going to
earry it back. It was nothing but a Papermate pen in which
a hypodermic needle had been inserted.

In other words, it wasn't a $10,000 piece of equipment
or anything like this.

Mr. Johnston. I agree, but it's a very compromising
piece of evidence to have around.

AMLASH Case Officer, That's right. But what I can't

AMLASI Case Officer, Me said he wouldn't. T al

remember this. He says, and then later on he says, I'm not
going to take any compromising material back with me.

This would have been a piece of compromising, material.

Ne did not like the pen, The only point probably that we made

with him ig:that we were willing to consider, because he knew

our opposition to something like this, that we were even willing
to consider showing him something that -- whether he could '
again defend himself.

He did not think it was a good idea.

Senator Schweiker. What kind of weapon or substance
could he get that would not compromise him? I'ma little
confused. ie wanted something to defend himself, but he
doesn't want anything that will compromise him.

Unless you have a disappearing weapon, what G6ild he
possibly get that would not compromise him to take back?

AMLASH Case Officer. Well, we were talking also about
to him inside Cuba. fe didn't exactly have to take it back

In other words, here again, the whole idea of this was

not to give him something there that he would be able to take

Mr. Johnston. Did you ever ask him for the pen back?
Do you recall asking him to give you the pen back before the
meeting concluded or after the conclusion of the meeting?

it that, you know, it's no good, I just can't logically believe
that he would have kept the pen. This is the point. But I

So he was not in any way enthused about what we had shown



WARD & PAUL

410 Fst Street. S.€., Washington, 0.C: 20003

Mr. Johnston, Let me ask you, is it correct you did
promise him at this meeting that you would drop rifles with
telescopic sights for him in Cuba?

AMLASH Case Officer, That's right,

Mr. Johnston. Was there any mention of paying him money
to support his coup plans?

AMLASII Case Officer, IM!e had never really asked for
money. In promising him full support for the coup, if money
was required I presume that could be conjecture that he could
qet that also, but he did not specifically ask for money.

Mr. Johnston, Was there discussion of his escape in
the event he assassinated Castro or killed Castro but did not
pull off the coup?

AMLASII Case Officer. At the last meeting I don't believe
that was discussed.

Mr. Johnston, At your prior meeting?

AMLASII Case Officer. If it was, it was touched upon,
but as I recall, and this is from reading the file afterward.
where this was discussed was a year later when he was in cont
with the exile group, I think it was with the exile group
he was then concerned about, how do I get out if something
goes wrong and we can't pull the coup.

but we did not at the 22 Noveinbor meeting, I don't il?

we discussed that. In fact, I'm sure we didn't discuss it.



What time did the meeting end?
AMDASII Case Officer. ‘Approximately 10:00 in the evening.

Nr. Johnston. And we basically discussed while we

i
were off the record the fact that the assassination occurred

1
at 12:30 in Dallas, which we think would have been around 7:30
in Paris, and the meeting was then over at 10:00 o'clock. i

When you walked out of the meeting you testified previously

that you heard about the assassination.

AMLASH Case Officer. ‘That's correct.

Mr. Johnston. And that's the first word you heard about

the assassination?
AMLASII Case Officer. Yes.

Mr. Johnston. You previously said that AMLASH made a

comment about that. Was there any other discussion of the
assassination by AMLASH?

MMLASII Case Officer. That was it, because I left hin
at that time.

Mr. Johnston, I don't understand, ‘If the meeting is
either in a house or somewhere else how you would leave together,

and you would have access to a radio or something to hear the

report.

10 First Street, S.€., Wasnington, O.C. 20003

AMLASH Case Officer. If it was in the house, it could

told us. |In fact, I

us he had just heard on tha radio about the assassination when
we came out of the meeting. We didn't go or come together
to the house. He left on his own and then I left after he left.

Mr. Johnston. So in other words, what you're saying is
that you're not walking out of the building but you're in the
house and the meeting is over and | a nows that the
meeting is over and that he tells you.

AMLAS!I Case Officer. We cama out of the room, out of
the:study in which we were holding the meeting, and when we
came out of that into his living room he told us what he had
just heard on the radio.

Mr. Johnston. And then AMLASII made this comment and

walked out of the door?

AMLASH Case Officer. ANLASI made this comment and

shortly thereafter I don't recall, we finished our business.
He was -- I don't remember the exact quote. You have it on
the record there, like why does it have to happen to somebody
like that.

Mr. Johnston. Did you know who committed the assassination
at this time?

AMLASH Case Officer. No.

Mr. Johnston, And even with that you don't recall whether

AMIASH walked out the door with the poison pen?

done is pull the hypodermic needle out of it, that's very
simple, and then it's just a pen, throw the pen away or keep
the pen.

It's not a complicated object, in other words. It was
very simple to just pull the hypodermic needle out of it, and
that's probably what was done, But I don't recall specifically i
that I did it.

Mr. Johnston, Did you do that after the meeting was over?

AMLASH Case Officer. No, it was during the meeting, not
after.

Mr. Johnston. Now there's an indication that you got
instructions from Washington after the meeting to break off

contact with AMLASH.

Do you recall receiving those instructions or instructions

to that effect? i

MILASH Case Officer. Yes, there was a cable, I :
believe, as I recall. It wasn't necessarily to break off contact
with AMLASH because everybody knew that that was the last
meeting. le was preparing to, we knew this, he had been prepari:
and we had been talking to him since October since he was out
about his return to Cuba.

Senator Schweiker. 9id the arms drop cache ever occur?

AMLASH Case Officer. I had left, I wasn't involved in



410 Fut Street, 5.6., wasmington, D.C. 70009

; ran ’
that part of it, Senator. only from the record that I

read afterwards, I think a couple of drops were made to him.
In fact, the next year or something like that.

Mr. Johnston. I'm not sure exactly what was left or
what he received or what was, available.

AMLASH Case Officer. And I don't know if he ever picked

them up, I don't think we know that.
Mr. Wallach. Why did he tell you he wanted ral rifles \

with telescopic sights? i
AMLASI! Case Officer. Well, he wanted grenades and he

wanted dynamite too to storm the headquarters later on. We

said, well, look, could you expand this somewhat too, and he

was talking about, well, yes, and we should probably attack

the radio station at the same time, It was a matter of attackine

a building, whether it was a radio station or whatever it was, |

in order to, in his mind, he was probably thinking of attacking i
the headquarters, Castro's headquarters.

Mr, Johnston. Let me refresh your recollection. In
your previous testimony with the Select Committee on page 114
you stated:

"When we came out of that meeting we heard the news
of President Kennedy's assassination and I received a cable
after that which I thought that this was probably the reason
the whole operation was being re-assessed.

AMLASH Case Officer. That was strictly my thought at that

Mr, Johnston

you said,"well, the whole Cuban operation, the way I interpreted|

it, was being called on.”

Did you receive a cable to that effect?

AMLASH Case Officer. It was,.a-very cryptic cable saying,

you know, return to Washington, which T was going to do anyway,
so this is why --

Mr. Johnston, Did it say to break off contact with
AMLASH?.

AMLASH Case Officer, I don't recall that it did but
it didn't make any difference because headquarters knew that
that was'the last meeting with him before he was returning to
Cuba anyway.

So there was no reason to tell me to break off contact
with him, This is what I'm trying to say.

Mr. Johnston. Supposedly the 1967 IG report, and 1
don't know where they got their information, said that was an
OPIN cable.

MMLASH Case Officer, That's Operation Immediate. In
other words, it's an immediate cable, That set precedence
on the cable.

Mr. Johnston. And what does that mean for transmitting

AMLASH Case Officer. It was transmitted before a routin

cable or a priority cable. It's just the precedence --

Mr. Johnston. Now there is“in the file a cable reporting)

Paris that morning of November 23rd and arrive in Washington

Did you in fact take that flight?

AMLASIT Case Officer, Did you ever find that cable?

Mr, Johnston. I saw the cable of your return to
Washington.

was the one telling me to come back, This is a travel-type

of exchange.

Mr. Wallach. ‘Why would they have sent you a cable

AMLASH Case Officer. 1 don't know. This was probably

a reaction to what had happened, But again, I want to point
out to you that travel cables of this type, even if your plans are

way I sent a cable to Paris telling them I'm arriving on such
and such a date.

Mr. Johnston, Would you have sent your cable without
getting a cable first from them?

AMLASI Case Officer. I could have, sure.

Mr. Johnston. I'm not sure I understand the purpose
of their cable. Were you saying it's a regular thing that they
will send extra traffic?

AMLASH Case Officer. I can't tell you what the purpose
of their cable was except what I'm trying to explain to you
is that keeping headquarters informed or headquarters inquiring

of you in such circumstances, it's not unusual to get a cable,

return or us sending a cable.

If there was any other reason for sending that cable, j

Mr. Johnston. I'd like the record to show that Senator
Schweiker has left and you are aware that without the Senator
being here you have the prerogative to stop your testimony.

Do you understand that?

AMLASH Case Officer. Yes.

Mr. Johnston. And that if we proceed, that you can cont

continue when we have a’Soenator present.

Do you understand that?

ANLASH Case Officer. Right.

Mr. Johnston, Are you willing to continue under the
conditions of not having a Senator here?

AMLASII Case Officer, Yes, I am,

Mr. Johnston. We have you back in Washington at 6:10
on November 23rd, and you may or may not have gone to the offic
that day and you said you definitely did go to the office on
November 24th, on Sunday.

AMLASII Case Officer. Probably so. Scratch definitely.
I'm probably not that definite about it, but I'm sure I touched
base with the office as soon as I returned, either telephonicall'
or physically going there.

Mr, Johnston, Let me refresh your recollection then and
remind you that Oswald was killed on November 24th, Sunday.

Does that aid you in recalling where you were at that

)

MMLASI! Case Officer. No. I mean I was home, certainly. ;

Mr, Johnston. You mean home in Washington?

AMLASII Case Officer. In Washington.

Mr. Johnston. But you don't know whether you were at
the office or at home on that day?

AMLASH Case Officer, It depends on the hour that we

If you're going back $0 asking about ‘normal hours that

we kept during that period of time, Sunday was just another
working day, so you know, it wasn't because it was Sunday that
we would not have been in the office.

Mr. Johnston, But you con't recall being in the office?

AMLASI Case Officer. I don't recall being in the office
When we heard the information that Oswald was involved, I
could very well have heen home.

Mr. Johnston. Do you recall being in the office when
you heard that Oswald was shot?

AMLASI! Case Officer. No.

Mr. Johnston. Did you hold, when did you first talk
to the chief of the section about your meeting?

AMLASII Case Officer. Specifically, I don't recall when.
What would have been ususual is for me to have called the offic
when I got in and whether I went there or not, I don't recall.

he was in on that Sunday and I went in, I would have talked to
him on Sunday, and if not, it would have been on Monday.

November 22nd meeting?

Mr. Johnston, Did you talk to anyone in technical

Mr. Johnston. So it was your recollection that the only
one you talked to in this time period of November 23rd and
November 24th, November 25th about the meeting in Paris is

Mr, Fitzgerald?

AMLASH Case Officer. To the best, of my recollection, yes

Mr. Johnston. And what is your recollection of that
discussion?

AMLASH Case Officer. The report, as to what had taken
place, reporting that he had not thought highly of the device
that we had provided him with, that he did not intend to carry
it back, that he was pleased with the fact that we had decided
that we would put caches down for him inside Cuba, the
reaffirmation of U.S..support for his movement inside of Cuba,
the fact that he had decided definitely to return and had
made his reservations to return, and his dismay and his
reaction when he had heard that Kennedy had been assassinated
when we got to the meeting.

Mr. Johnston, Was there a discussion about any link
between AMLASH or your Cuban operations and the Kennedy

assassination?

you saying that‘it's possible but you don't recall it, or are

the Kennedy assassination at that time, That we tied the
Kennedy assassination in with AMLASH, I don't recall any kind
of conversation of that nature.

Mr. Johnston. On November 23rd and November 24th and
November 25th?

Mr. Johnston. What about the fact that on November lyth
in your memorandum for record you indicated that Fitzgerald
wanted written reports to be kept to a mimimum?

contact report and I hadn't finished it, the secretary could
very well have started to type it, and then when I finished it
I would have given her the last page to type because it was all

were discussed “at the last. nokta. communications. So that

is not a new subject matter, That is definitely part of the
subject matter that was discussed at the last meeting, which
was communications with him.

Mr. Johnston, And it's your testimony that this report
as it exists in that file is exactly the report that you: prepare
on November 25th?

AMLASI! Case Officer, Yes..

Mr. Johnston. You'll note that the report does: not
mention the pen device or AMLASII's reaction to your giving it
to him,

AMLASII Case Officer, That's right.

Mr. Johnston. You left that out of your original report.
You did not make a written report on --

AMLASH Case Officer. I did not make a written report

lon that.

Mr. Johnston, Why was that?

AMLASH Case Officer, Probably because Fitzgerald said
not to.

Mr, Johnston. Do you recall Pitzyerald saying not to?

AMLASH Case Officer. I don't recall it, but that's
certainly what I'd have to assume.

In other words, don't include that part of it.

Mr, Johnston. Should it have gone in there in a normal



AMLASIL case officer. In a normal report, yes. But this
certainly was a rather, again, sensitive subject that we were
talking about. le did not accept it and I don't think that at
that time it was felt that-anything else should be said about
it.

Mr. Johnston. Why is that?

AMLASII Case Officer, I don't know why. Again, because
of the sensitivity, I presume, of the subject.

Mx. Johnston, And again, is it your recollection that
Fitzgerald, is it your testimony that Fitzgerald told you not
to put a reference to the pen device in the report?

AMLASH Case Officer. I don't recall if he specifically

was satisfied that it was not in.

any more sensitive than references to arms caches or suggestion:

of assassinations or all the other kinds of things that were

already in the file?

AMLASH Case Officer. Because again, in conjunction with
this particular operation it was not an assassination operatio: ;
It was a coup operation. ‘This was one of the aberrations of tha

operation which we got involved in strictly to provide bona

fides to the man that we were dealing with and we were concerne

q
for his personal security.
!



wane & PAUL

a0 Fest Street, S-€., Wasmungion, 0.€. 20009

to provide him with any such devices for the purposes of
assassinating Castro. The rifles and the grenades and all of
this was something that was necessary to start a coup.

In other words, it was not directed at one particular
person.

I think this was probably the thinking at that time and
why such points did not get into it because this was not part
of the AMLASH plan of operation.

Mr. Baron. For the sake of the accuracy of the records

and the protection of the people who were involved at the CIA,
|

wouldn't even the tender of such a device to AMLASII for whatever,
purporses normally be put into the records?
ANLASI! Case Officer. Not in a contact report because in Hl

a contact report this goes into the regular file. Whether

Fitzgerald would have made a note of this some. place else I

don't know, but in the regular contact report which goes into
the reqular file -- in other words, say the secretary would
know about it and this could have been the other part of it.
In other words, to reduce the number of people, to contain
the number of people.
Mr. Baron. Do you recall anything in your discussions
with Fitzgerald that led you to believe that one of the
factors that was in his mind in assessing the sensitivity of

this tender of a poison pen device was the day on which it

happened as oppos:

offered? :

AMIASH Case Officér. If Lt was in his mind, he never
stated it to me. I think it was just the overall sensitivity
that the Agency had been, has now, and always has had on
assassinations.

I mean it's not the specific of what had happened that
time. Assassinations were not part of the routine business of
the Agency.

Mr. Johnston. Let me ask you, you have mentioned the
secretary who prepared it, Do you recall the name of the
secretary who prepared this document?

AMLASII Case Officer. No, I don't.

Mr. Johnston. Did you have a regular secretary?

AMLASH Case Officer. Yes.

AMLASH Case Officer, She could have prepared it or

WARD a PAUL,

“a0 Funst Steeet, 5... Washington. D.C. 20003

you discussed this aspect of the speech?

AMLASH Case Officer. We did not discuss the speech
paragraph by paragraph. All we did was a very small passing
remark a about the speech.

lle had probably to the best of my recollection already
read it in one of the Parisian newspapers, or if T had a news~
paper clipping of the speech, he glanced at it while we were
there, but I don't recall that. But he was certainly satisfied
with the tone of the speech.

Mr. Johnston, You must have read the speech before
you mentioned it to him. Is this the portion that you had in
mind that would satisfy him about the tone of the speech?

AMLASH Case Officer. Certainly this sets the tone for
the whole speech. The extracts that you have made here sets

the tone for the full speech and specifically the one in which

once the barrier is removed, we will be ready and anxious

to work with the Cuban people in pursuit of those progressive
goals which in a few short years stirred the hopes and the
sympathy of many people throughout the entire hemisphere.

Mr, Johnston. Was it your intent by making reference to

[the specch in your meeting with AMLASH to show that higher

authority was behind what you were doing?

NILASIL Case Officer. Yes, precisely.



410 Fest Street, 5... Wayhington, D.C. 20003

Mr, Johnston.

and you felt that this speech coincided
with what you were telling AMLASII?

AMLASH Case Officer, Yes, that the U.S, Government was
prepared, the.assurances at first that Gerald had given him
and I had been giving him that the U.S. Government was willing
to support the Cuban people.

Mr. Baron, In the excerpt from the speech that we have
just shown you it says:

"It is important to restate what now divides Cuba from
my country and fram all the American countries, It is the
fact that a small band of conspirators has stripped the Cuban
people of their frecdom and handed over the independence and
soverignty of the Cuban nation to forces heyond the hemisphere. |

Then it continues: "This and this alone divides us.

As long as this is true, nothing is possible, Without it,
everything is possiile. Once this barrier is removed, we will
be ready and anxious to work with the Cuban people."

That's the end of the quote.

Is it your understanding that this reference to a small
band of conspirators is a reference to the Castro government?

AMLASH Case Officer. Precisely.

Me, Baron, And in your report of Movember 19th, or your

1 memorandum for the record of November 19th, you had mentioned

that -- well, I will simply quote from the report. It says:

AMLASH Case Officer. I can't give you a specific quote
but I presume that he had had some input into the speech. This

again, wouldn't necessarily be Fitzgerald himself, It could :

be but it could also be the SAS, the CIA input into the speech,
which is normal in Presidential speeches that there are inputs
from different agencies.

Mr. Baron. Did Fitzgerald say anything to you about
preparation of this speech that led you to believe that the
president or anyone close to him who had been involved in the

preparation of the speech had been made knowledgeable of the

AMLASH Cage Officer. No.

specifically that the President had been apprised of this,
The general objective, I never had any doubts in: my mind that
the general objective of organizing a coup against Castro did
not have the highest governmental approval, I mean this was
never a question, I don't think, in my mind. Again, not
specifically assassination because what I mentioned before,
I don't think Fitzgerald or Helms or anybody else would
anecifically have briefed anybody that the AMLASH operation was
an assassination plot because it wasn't,

Mr. Baron. So you had no basis for believing that the

President was informed that a component of the AMLASII operation

was assassination?
AMLASH Case Officer. No, I have no reason. I don't
know. Nobody told me that he had or he hadn't.

Mr. Baron. Did Fitzgerald make it clear to you that

lin providing input to this speech he had the specific purpose

| in mind of giving a public signal to AMLASIi that he would receive

support from the highest quarters of the U.S. Government if he
would move for a coup?
AMLASI! Case Officer. Yes, this was my understanding.
Mr. Baron. ‘That the speech was to be a specific signal
to opponents of Castro inside Cuba as opposed to a general

statement of U.S. policy?

AMLASII Case Officer. No, just the general conversation

In other words, we were trying to organize a coup. and
the problems that we had been through specifically with AMLASI
in trying to persuade him that the U.S. government was serious
about supporting Cubans who were opposed to Castro.

So this statement that appeared in the speech was
certainly public notice that this was the case.

Me, Baron, Did Fitzgerald or anyone else say anythiny
to you that led you to believe that the President had been
specifically informed that representations sould be made such
as the ones on Octoher 29th that Robert Kennedy or other high
american officials would stand behind AMLASI?

now, was there a decision after the assassination to break off

it wasn't an automatic decision ‘right after the assassination.

think the only hesitancy at that time was what's the new policy?

That probably was the hesitancy, not the fact that it |
was immediately decided to stop contact, which, as I said before.
it wasn't, because we saw him again, i
Mr. Johnston. Was there a discussion at all in November ;
or December 1963 ahout the relationship between the ANLASII ;
operation and the assassination of President Kennedy?
AMLASIL Case Officer. Not that I recall.
Let me show you, we have in several versions

and the one that is most available is this document here, and |

Mr. Johnston,

I have got the document you're looking at is in Volume 12,
I believe, of the AMLASI! file.
AMLASH Case Officer. Yes.

Mr. Johnston, And it is a yellow legal size paper.

AMLASH Case Officer. Let me correct, It's nota docume>
It is evidently somebody's type-written notes of probably the
recollection of what had happened.

Mr. Johnston, Okay, and it's on yellow legal-size papcr

typed, And I also have a document that I'm sure is in the file

but we don't have it pointed: o

of a memorandum for the record datdd 29 March, 1965, subject
AMLASII, and both of them convey the same subject, the same
information. And on the paragraph that has the marking at the |
left and the language of those documents, those Jocuments say |
"22 November, '63, Mr. Fitzgerald and Mr. Sanchez assured subject
that this Agency would give him everything he needed.?

Is that the portion you're reading?

AMLASIL Case Officer. Yes.

Mr. Johnston. "(Telescopic sight, nilencer, all the
money he wanted). Situation changed when Mr. Sanchez and

Nr. Fitzgerald left the meeting to discover that President

Kennedy had been assassination. Lecause of this fact, plans

of subject changed and it was decided that this Ayeacy coul.!
have no part in the assassination of a government leader (inclu:
Castro), and it would not aid subject in his attempt.

"ghis included the following: ' We would not furnish |
the silencer, nor scone, nor any money for direct assasainationy
furthermore, we would not lift a finger to hel» subject escam
from Cuba should he assassinate Castro.'™

Rid you prepare this document?
AMLASI Case Officer. I did not prepare this document.
I was not with the task force with SAS at the time this document

was prepared on 29 March, '65, I had already left,

Again, the only thing I can state for you here on +



fh og tae
‘ ia
I knew of, ‘the opel tion;, that this was somebody trying to put

together, this was a memo.from Chief FI probably in the task
force trying to put together by this time, 29 March, what had
happened. The other document since it's, it's probably a later
date, the yellow document was somebody probably again trying tc
reconstruct what had happened. The facts are not as I’ knew
them at the time.

Both paragraphs have condensed an evolution that took
place over a period of a year and the decision probably was not |
made until '65 after I had left the operation, that we were
pulling out.

But the facts as stated here in those two documents are
incorrect, and certainly the timing that they insinuate is
wrong.

Mr. Johnston. I think we should develop that on the

record and if you want to point out what facts are incorrect,

why don't you do so?
i

AMLASH Case Officer. "The situation changed when Mr.
Sanchez and ‘ir, Fitzgerald left the meeting to discover that
President Kennedy had been assassinated.’ That's incorrect.

Pitzgerald wasn't with me on the 22nd of November meeting

Mr, Johnston. Okay. What about the sentence before
that, that Mr, Fitzgerald and Mr. Sanchez assured subject that
this Agency would give him everything he needed, with your

qualifier that Fitzgerald was not at the meeting?



AMLASH Cage Officer, ..this was at the meeting in October
and not at the Noverber meeting because that is correct,
provided you put it in the right context,

Mr. Johnston. What about the statement, all the money
he wanted?

AMLASH Case Officer, Inferred. I mean I don't recall
that money was ever discussed with this man at any time. In
fact I was asked this question before and I couldn't really
recollect: when I had given him some money.

It turns out that the record shows that I did give him

$350 for his expenses. But money, specifically, again, that
is somebody else interpreting. I don't know of any other
document or certainly any memorandum for the record that I
prepared in which money specifically was mentioned.

Mr. Johnston. But would you disagree with the statement

Mr. Johnston, Well, that's what we want to leave in,
the money.

AMLASI! Case Officer. If he needs the money, I think it

Mr. Johnston. This makes a positive statement, him
saying that vou and Mr. Pitzgerald assured AMLASH that the

Agency would give him everything he needed, all the money he

AMLASH Case Officer, I can't recall that such an issue
was made of money because he never asked for money and we
specifically didn't have to respond to telling him that we
would give him money. In telling him that the support necessary),
all of the support necessary for a coup, I think it is implied
that he would get whatever he needed, bite would mean supplies,

put not specifically money, and the reason I state this is that |

money was never a subject of contention between the Agency and
|

AMLASH. He never asked for money, he never was offered
specifically money.

Mr. Johnston. Was he assured that he would get all the

money he wanted?

AMLASH Case Officer. All the support he needed, not
the money that he wanted. lle never asked for money.

Me, Johnston. I'm not asking you what he asked for.

putting together. These are rough notes: typed on ye. low, legal

sized paper of somebody trying to reconstruct what happened
here probably two or three years afterwards,

Mr. Johnston. I guess what I'm asking is a yes or
no answer. In October or November, 1963, aid you or Mr.
Fitzgerald, to your knowledge, assure AMLASH that he would
receive all the money he wanted? |

NILASH Case Officer. Wo, and I must qualify that. unless
you want to infer that in giving him the support that he needed
he would also receive money. But money specifically, all he
wanted, was never a part of the conversations, to the best of
my knowledge.

Mr. Johnston, We have talked about the next sentence

and it continues.

“Because of this fact plans of subject changed and it was
decided the Agency could have no part in the assassination of
a government leader,’ including Castro."

Is that accurate? I'm giving you an opportunity to
rebut the document.

AMLASH Case Officer. It's accurate from the point of
view --

You have to put it in the right time frame, in the
right context. When he was met in late '64, after having visited

AMLASH Case Officer. No. A year later in November of

Mr. Johnston, And you're saying that this does not
describe the fall AMLASH meeting?

AMLASH Case Officer, It does not. It is a mixture of
what happened over at least a two year period.

Nx, Johnston. It perplexes me somewhat that your
failure to keep written records would so warp later thinkers
as to what was going on. I mean take the March, 1965 document.
As of March, 1965 CIA is going on the assumption that you
and Fitzgerald met AMLASH in Paris, that you assured him that
he would get all the money he wanted and that your plans

changed after the mecting because of the Kennedy assassination.

‘ston, ©.C. 20003,

give you an explanation for that as to where the person who

prepared that particular memorandum got that information. The
file itself indicates; as you are well aware, that Fitzgerald
did not travel to Paris in November, lle travelled in October.
Sq the person who prepared the 29 March, 1965 memo came
up with this particular type of information, I don't know.
Mr. Johnston, Who is that memo addressed to again?
AMLASII Case Officer. This is to Chief, PI from Chief,
Reports. j
Me. Johnston. So your only explanation, your explanation
for the memo is that it is inaccurate but even if it is
inaccurate, it indicates that in March, 1965 these people had
it all wrong as to what the AMLASH operation was all about.
AMLASH Case Officer. If you want to interpret exactly

what they wrote here, yes, it was wrong. Now I'm not saying

that it was wrong because it could have been. I don't know.

I'm just saying it could have been that they didn't have access |

| to all the restricted files because this operation until it

received its recent publicity was kept on a very restricted
basis.

So the Chief of Reports, I don't even know, well,
probably the Chief of Reports in the division or maybe sone
place, probably did not have access to all of the operationa

files.

Mr. Greissing. But i'm saying over the period of a
year from 1 November to the following November when you actual
informed AMLASH of the feelings that the Agency had developed
at that time, I believe it is the next sentence down.

AMLASH Case Officer. What 1s wrong here, what is wrong
is that after we left that meeting, which I presume they left
the meeting, I presume they're talking about, yes, the 22
November, '63 meeting -~ this is absolutely wrong, that when
we left that meeting to discover that President Kennedy had

because in that same memorandum it does state that.

Mr. Johnston. Let me move ‘off these documents, The

indicated a source in the Cuban embassy in Paris.

AMLASH Case Officer, Excuse me. November 27th of

Mr. Johnston. 1963. A source in the Cuban embassy
in Paris was complaining about AMLASH's denigrating the

Did you see that report on November 27th, 1963?

AMLASH Case Officer. I probably did. I can't
specifically recall that I did.

Mr. Johnston. And as I read the report, or my statement
to you of its substance, it would suggest to you that AMLASI
was known by given diplomatic personnel in Paris to be putting
down the Castro revolution.

who did he say this to because he did have friends in the
different embassies.

AMLASH Case Officer, Well, that suggests -- and again, I
can't give you any definitive explanation for it -- what that
suggests is that she overheard AMLASH talking with somebody
else of like mind, and she didn't like what she heard, I guess.

Mr. Johnston. Let's go now to again what you talked about,
any link in your mind or in Fitzgerald's mind in November and

saying that this was not an assassination plot, so there would

assassination

with this assassination plot, This was not an assassination

Plot, it was not conceived as an assassination plot. As a coup
against Fidel Castro, yea, The fact that the U.S. Government
was not happy and was supporting people who were opposed to
Castro, this was well known. This‘was in the aftermath, '63, of
the Bay of Pigs. so there was really in the context of the
time the fact that this was not an assassination plot conceived
as an assassination: plot, there was really no reason to
connect this one particular operation with the tragedy of
President Kennedy,

Mr. Johnston. Okay,

We do know that on the 29th of October Fitzgerald told
AMLASH that Robert Kennedy was behind the plot or behind
AMLASH'S proposal ,'is that correct?

AMLASH Case Officer. What we told him was that the U.s.
Government was prepared to support a coup against Fidel
Castro.

Mr. Johnston. And AMLASH had Previously told you that
at least one of his plans for a coup would require the assassi- |
nation of the Castro Brothers,

AMLASH Case Officer. He had not exactly put it in those
terms, but he certainly felt that the first move would have
to be against the leadership, yes. In other words, we never

talked to him in terms of assassination, and I want this



wane & pave

AiO First Street, S.E., Wathington, D.C. 20003

Mr. Johnston. And he told you before the 29th meeting that

the first step would probably have to be the assassination of
the Castros?

AMLASH Case Officer. He never told me assassination becaus
he didn't even like to use the word "assassination."

Mr. Johnston. What word did he like to use?

AMLASH Case Officer. The neutralization, the elimination
if you will, of the leadership.

The first move in any coup attempt, in order for the
other officers to fall in line, would have to be the removal,
the removal of Fidel Castro, because of the loyalties that te
still had personally with some of the officers.

Mr. Johnston. And after he told you that on October
29th, you gave him an assurance that Robert Kennedy backed his

proposal generally.

AMLASH Case Officer. Yes, the U.S. Government and
Pitzgerald as the representative of Robert Kennedy, supported
a coup against Castro.

Mr. Johnston. On the very day of the assassination, you
referenced the speechof President Kennedy's talking about
an ouster of the current regime in Cuba.

AMLASH Case Officer. That's right.

Mr. Johnston. Were you aware of the September 7th

statement of Fidel Castro's, threatening the lives of U.S.



410 First Steet, S.€., Washington, 0.C. 20003

a portion of that statement by Fidel Castro on: September 7th
ata party at the Brazilian embassy in Havana, he talked to a
reporter, Daniel Harker of AP and said, among other things,
“we are prepared to fight them and answer in kind, The United
States leaders-should think that if they are aiding terrorist
plans to eliminate Cuban leaders, they themselves will not be
safe,"

I would think..from your description of the AMLASH operation
that AMLASH had a plan to eliminate Cuban leaders, and that
it is very possible --

AMLASH Case Officer. So did everybody else. So did every
other Cuban exile who was plotting against Castro,

Mr. Johnston. But this is in the Brazilian Embassy on
September 7th, and you started - meeting with AMLASH on

September 5th in Brazil, and it may be coincidence, but Castro

does give a warning about United States leaders aiding terrorist

plans to eliminate Cuban leaders, and you were doing that very
thing.

AMLASH Case Officer. There is probably a coincidence
there. I don't recall that I knew of this at that time. I've
certainly heardof it since, but I don't see the point that you
are trying to make, because if Castro is behind or was behind
AMLASH to involve him in the assassination of an American

leader, then are you proposing that he would also publicly

In other words, was he telegraphing this plan that he
had?

Mr. Johnston. ‘I-don'tiknow. I-assume not..° Mee

AMLASH Case Officer. I would find it highly unusual that
if he was serious about being involved in something like this,
that he would publicly announce his plan, but I may be wrong.
That's just my opinion.

Mr. Johnston. So we have this Castro speech of September

7th, whatever that means, and we have the AMLASH operations

we talked about in November and October, and then almost

at the very moment of the Kennedy assassination we have your
meeting with AMLASH and giving him the technical equipment or
the assurances of technical equipment that he had requested at
the October 29th meeting.

You knew on November 24th, certainly November 25th, that
the alleged assassin of President Kennedy was pro-Castro, Lee
Harvey Oswald was pro-Castro.

AMLASH Case Officer. I don't even know that at this
time,

Mr. Johnston. You don't know that at this time?

AMLASH Case Officer. No, where did you get that?

Mr. Johnston. You don't know?

AMLASH Case Officer. That he was pro-Castro?



Mr. Baron. , “logical-deduction from the fact

that he was part of ‘the Fair Play for Cuba Committee?

AMLASH Case Officer, It could have been, but I haven't
seen that.

Mr. Greissing. He had come out publicly in interviews
stating that he was for Castro and would defend Castro if the

U.S. took action,

AMLASH Case Officer, Well, probably so, but I never had --|

Mr. Johnston, And in fact, Oswald had visited Mexico City dy
on Novenber 25th, the very day you wrote your contact report,
the Mexico City chief of station cabled headquarters and remindei

them about the Castro speech threat, and I assume that our infora-ff

Wane a raun

tion is that Mr. King was handling the activity in Mexico
City.

AMLASH Case Officer. Yes.

Mr. Johnston. So on November 25th he was aware of the

threat, reminded of the threat.

I think it is fair to say that Mr. King knew that Oswald
had visited the Cuban embassy in Mexico City. He knew that on
November 25th.

Another CIA document indicates that Chief of Station Wynn

Scott -- I don't know whether you knew him -- in Mexico City,

rest, S-E., Washington, D.C. 20003

on November 25th read a message to the President of Mexico

in which he said, Mr. Scott's memo says there are still some

Mr. Johnston. No, on November 25th that is a question

Knowing now, looking back at Mr. King, we have the Western
Hemisphere Division on November 25th is informed that Castro
has made a threat against U.S. leaders, tad the chief of
station in Mexico City is telling [th
that there is a possibility that Castro was behind it,

Oswald was known to be pro-Castro, and on November 22nd, you
in turn were meeting in Paris, giving a high level Cuban
assurances that his coup plot. that. might include assassination '
of Castro was backed by the U.S. and that yet you made no
connection between those, all those events, and there was no
discussion of any connection.

AMLASH Case Officer. No, there was no discussion between
the -- the connection between the assassination of President
Kennedy and the AMLASH operation,

Mr. Johnston. Was there an investigation?

{ : O-my Knowledge, I left the
Operation right after that, 80 I wouldn't know if there was

Or wasn't, But the coincidence that you are talking about,

if you are connecting: or trying now to imply that there was a
Connection between AMLASH and the fact that it was on the 22nd
of November, the same date as President Kennedy's assassination,|
they must have had a very terrific system of communication,

Mr. Johnston, Although you had set up the meeting on the
20th of November, is that right?

AMLASH Case Officer. Yes, but he didn't know Specifically
what we were going to Say. In fact, the answer that we could
have given him could have been reversed,

Mr. Johnston. Well, you said he xequested it,

AMLASH Case Officer, Well, he requested it before he left
but the assurances, you can go back before that. You can go bagk

to the October meeting when the assurances of support were given

So I can't -- I fing it very difficult to follow what you
are trying to imply or to relate AMLASH directly to the
assassination on 22 November, This is what I find difficult to
understand,

Mr. Johnston. Let me show you a copy of a cable, no
indication that the cable went to SAS. The cable is Mexico
City, 7045, dated 24 November '63 and by way of background,

tell you that immediately upon the assassination, the Personnel

in Mexico City under surveillance ‘and ‘pulling the records, and I

don't want to read this into the record because it uses a
true name.

Let's go off the record,

(Discussion off the record.)

Mr. Johnston. Let me read it, except for the true name.

It says "Provided -below sufficiently definitive summary
of local contacts of Ivan Gavrilovich Alferiev." It gives his
contacts, it says "o3 December 1961 with the Third Secretary of
Cuban Cultural Attache, naming her, and arranging a press
conference for AMLASH, It's a very tangential relationship
with the AMLASH operation, but again, on November 24th, 1963,
Mexico City is reporting KGB ~. or: Alferiev's contacts, and
it includes a contact in '61 with AMLASH.

So I have difficulty believing that they are, in hindsight,
not related, and that on November 24th or November 25th no
one at CIA related the two events.

AMLASH Case Officer. What I'm telling you is -- I'm not
telling you that no one at CIA relates the two events. You
asked me the specific question, did you and Fitzgeraldcdiscuss
any relationship. My answer to you was that Fitzgerald and I
did not specifically discuss that.

Mr. Johnston. Do you know of anyone who discussed it?

AMLASH Case Officer. ‘No.

AMLASH Case Officer. No.

(A brief recess was taken.):

Mr. Johnston. Let me now talk << and again the groundwork
is that you were unaware of any investigation of a connection
between the two, and you were unaware of any discussion about
@ connection between AMLASH and Kennedy's assassination.

Is that a correct summary?

AMLASH Case Officer. That's correct,

Mr. Johnston. I will show you a document. For the record,
this is a document appearing in Volume IV of the AMLASH
file, and the first page of.it has AMLASH's name on it, but
I call your attention to the red handwriting in the upper right
hand corner of that, on that cover sheet, and it says, "not to
leave this office, per" blank's "orders."

Is that correct?

This document has handwriting in the upper writing hand
corner that it is not to leave this office, whatever that is.

AMLASH Case Officer. Without specific clearance, without |

orders.

Mr. Johnston, Do you have any recollection of such orders
being given by any one, yourself, or Mr. Fitzgerald?

AMLASH Case Officer. Yes, what we have talked about before

that Mr. Fitzgerald gave orders to minimize the Ech beaten

particular document? ‘

AMLASH Case Officer. Ye: ; "I can't see at this time that |
anything else would have been thought of at that time.

Mr. Johnston. What suddenly required that order to be
given?

AMLASH Case Officer, Well, nothing specific except that
by December of '63, the man with whom we were dealing, AMLASH I,
was going back, or was probably back by that time already in
Cuba. It was primarily probably I would say as much to protect
his security as anything else.

Mr. Johnston. So that nobody else -~ did this -have the
effect of blocking knowledge of the AMLASH operation from other
people within the Agency?

AMLASH Case Officer. Probably from my office down. Certainly
not Fitzgerald, not the Director of not anybody else who needed
to know about the operation, absolutely not. This was just
circulation within other components of SAS, That would not --
in other words, a note of this type would only mean that I
would be, or whoever would clear the order would be asked
before this file was allowed to circulate or was given to
anybody.

Mr. Johnston. And I don't want to indicate -- my question



WARD @ rave.

410 First Street, S.E., Watnington, 0.€. 20003

from getting access to this file?

AMLASH Case Officer, No. This is tuo informal. If you
want to block a file like this, there is a much more formal
procedure to go by, to block the file for, say, the Director's
use only, or even at that time, the Chief of SAS. A note
like this is strictly, can only be interpreted to restrict the
circulation of this file for the other people in SAS below my
office, not restricting it for anybody else.

Mr. Johnston. Upwards.

What about laterally? What about to the other divisions?

AMLASH Case Officer. Laterally also. In other words, they
would have to be checked out. It would have to be. We would

have to know who got the file. It is a matter of control. Thig

is what it amounts to, really. It is to know who the file
gcss to. It 4s to control the file.

Mr. Johnston. But you do that anyway, right?

That's routine procedure, This seems to be something more
than that, of saying don't let this leave without my approval. |

AMLASH Case Officer, No, it isn't anything more than that,

is.

and I think that you're really much more into it than what it |
|
|

I don't even recall giving -- telling the secretary this

particular thing. It probably came about’ from the miminized

420 Fuest Street, S.€., Washington, 0.c. 20003

eirculation order that’ Fitzgerald had: given way before in

October, as I recall.

Mr. Johnston, Did you expect this instruction to be carried!
out, that the file would not leave the office until you had
given your personal approval or Fitzgerald had approved it?

AMLASH Case Officer. Yes. I’would have thought that my
secretary would not have permitted this file to leave unless
cleared.

Mr. Johnston, We previously discussed whether Mr. King
knew about the operation.

Did he specifically know, to your knowledge, about the
AMLASH operation in the fall of 1963?

AMLASH Case Officer, I don't know. I never briefed him
personally.

Mr. Johnston. Did you have any reason to know that - he
did know about AMLASH eperation?

ASH Case Officer. No.

Mr. Johnston. Our notes indicate that on February 4th,
1964, Mr. King sent a memo to you requirements for AMLASH, and
I'll show you our notes. They basically detail questions,
intelligence information to be gathered from AMLASH.

AMLASH Case Officer. I don't specifically remember receivi
this, but. if we have -~ certainly the fact that we have an
asset who can surface any intelligence requirements from the

community or anybody else in the Agency, it would be perfectly

normal for anybody to
Z ite ates

Mr. Johnston. Would you agree, at least- from that summary
of the document, that really he's asking you to get intelligence!
type information from AMLASH?

Is that correct?

AMLASH Case Officer. Yes,

Mr. Johnston. And given the October Sth, 1963 meeting when|
AMLASII sort of indicated he didn't want anything to do with
that, this would be very inconsistent for someone who was
knowledable about AMLASH,

AMLASH Case Officer. What are the dates?

Mr. Johnston. October 5th, 1963, is when AMLASH complained
about the low level espionage requirements.

AMLASH Case Officer. He did not want -- he did not say
that he would not surface intelligence requirements. He did
not want to exclusively be that type of an asset.

So therefore it would be perfectly normal, regardless of
what he thought himself to be, or what even we may have thought,
for him to be, that if he had access to information, we were
going to levy the requirements on him,

Mr. Johnston. My direct question is, then, having read

the summary apparently prepared by Mr. King, and sent on

February 2nd, 1964, do you think that Mr. King knew about the
AMLASH operation, the events of October and November?

AMLASH Case Officer. If he sent us a memo giving us

requirements for AMLASH,

iindmum he had to know that we had
an agent with this particular access. But he knew about the
operation?” Not necessarily so.

Mr. Johnston. Do you find this consistent with the
nature of the operation as of November 22nd, 1963?

AMLASH Case Officer, Explain that. I don't understand.
What are you -- what is your question?

Mr. Johnston. As of November 22nd, 1963, you were now
involved in coup plotting with AMLASH, and were delivering or
planned to deliver the equipment, rifles, sights, explosives,
to assist him in that coup, It seems inconsistent, suddenly in
February, to go back to trying to get espionage information
from him.

AMLASH Case Officer. First of all, I have to address
that question from this point. Receiving a memo from King at
that time doesn't necessarily mean that we are going to levy
the requirements on AMLASII.

Mr. Johnston. Oh, I agree with that

i
AMLASH Case Officer. So, to clarify the other part of your

question, that if we needed intelligence after the October
"63 meeting in which he said I'm not going to be strictly a

source for intelligence, I want to do something more for my

country, it would not be in any way out of the orderinary to
ask him to send information that we felt was. required on the

outside,

this document'a conclusion one way or the other about whether

Mr. King knew the details of the AMLASH coup plotting.

Mr, Johnstons’ 80 you'are ‘saying you would not infer from

AMLASH Case Officer. No.

Mr. Johnston. As a final matter from my point, as we did
in your past meetings, could you briefly summarize, were you
contacted prior to today’s session at the Agency, and did you
discuss your testimony or the ramifications of your testimony
with anyone at the Agency?

AMLASH Case Officer. I was called yesterday morning,
February 10th, by Mr. Walter Elder, and informed that I was
to come here at 10:00 o'clock to discuss the AMLASH operation,
and that you would be over yesterday afternoon to mark those
portions of the file that you wished to discuss. |

.

I picked up the files from the review staff last night

ze this morning.

Mr. Johnston. Did you discuss the substance or proposed
substance of your testimony with anyone?

AMLASH Case Officer. No. I read the file and informed
myself as to those points that you wanted to talk about.

Mr. Johnston. That's all the questions we have.

I want to thank you very much for spending the time with
us today.

Is there any other comment you would like to make?

AMLASH Case Officer. No, not at all.

entitled matter was concluded.)

An Extract From Kennedy's Address to Pres!

Washington Post, Tuesday, November 19, 1963, p. ALS

(AP) Nov. 18 -- The following 1s a text of President Kennedy's address
tonight before the Inter-American Press Association;

* * ok

“The genuine Cuban revolution -- because it was against the tyran-
ny and corruption of the past -- had the support of many whose aims and
concepts were noble,

"But that hope for freedom and progress was destroyed.

wthe goals proclaimed in the Sierra Maestra were betrayed in Havana.

"It is important to restate what now divides Cuba from my country
and from all the American countries: It is the fact that a small band
of conspirators has stripped the Cuban people of their freedom and hand-
ed over the independence and sovereignty of the Cuban nation to forces
beyond the hemisphere, They have made Cuba a victim of foreign imperial-
ism, an instrument of the policy of others, a weapon in an effort dic-
tated by external powers to subvert the other American republics, This,
and this alone divides us, As long as this is true nothing is possible.
Without it everything is possible.

Ready and Anxious

“Once this barrier is removed we will be ready and anxious to work
with the Cuban people in pursuit of those progressive goals which, a few
short years ago, stirred their hopes and the sympathy of many people
throughout the entire hemisphere.

"No Cuban need feel. trapped between dependence on the broken prom-
ises of foreign communism and the hostility of the rest of the hemisphere.
For once Cuban sovereignty has been restored we will extend the hand of
friendship and assistance to a Cuba whose political and economic insti-
tutions have been shaped by the will of the Cuban people."
