he cabled report was received in Washington on 9 October and checked
in our files, vhere it was imedistely noted that the Lee OSWALD phoning the
Soviet Eubassy in Mexico City vas probably the Lee OSWALD who had defected to
the Soviet Union in 1959 and returned to the USA in 1962. Gm 10 October 1953,
the day after the report from Hexico City, CIA Headquarters sent out a cabled
report about Lee OSHALD's phone call to the Soviet Eubessy; the report went to
the FSI, the Depertnent of State (because OSWALD vas a U.S. citizen), end to
tha Navy Department (because be vas a forwer Nerine). ‘The cabled report to these
agencies highlighted the Liklihood that the Lee CSWALD mentioned vas probably the
former defector. Re ee Cea
a pT PET ‘The
same day & long cable went out to Mexico City informing our Station of the
‘background of defector Lee OSWALD and asking for more information. Our Station
vos instructed to pass its information on the phone call to the Mexico City offices

of the Fal, the Imbassy, the Naval Attache, and the Inmigretion and Naturalization

Service. This was done.

Our Haxico City Station very often produces information on U.S.
citizens contacting Soviet bloc cxbassies in Mexico City. Froquantly the
information ve get is extremely incriminating, and on one or two occasions we
have 4 even been able to apprehend and return to the USA Americen military
persomel who are attenpting to defect. In all such capes, our Headquarters
deak requests and obtaina the special peratasion of the Deputy Director for Plans
to pass the derogatory informstion on a U.S. citizen to other government agencies.
Ye were vob tnforsed of vheh action the Jal and other ageunies my heve taben ot
thet time based on our report. Later investigation has confirmed all the details
of his trip, where ha stayed, and whet he did. Ee

was put out.

As soon as the name of Lee CSHAID was mentioned in connection with the
esnassinstion of President Kennedy on 22 Novesber, CIA file checks vere begim
and the Mexican station was agked by cable for more information on OSWAID.
Yithin a week, tuenty-seven cabled reports had been sent to the White House, the
State Departuent, ani the Far.

CIA field stations provided meny ltstw of information during the week
wf ofter the assassination. ‘he Nexico City Station researched its telephone
tepe very thoroughly and came up with several more conversations probably
favolying OSHAID, tut not actually mentioning this nauey these connected him
also to the Cuban Consulate in Mexico City. Several Hexicens vere arrested
end questioned about his activities, giving a good picture of vbat he was really
up to. A host of febricators, some anonymous, boubexted overssas enbasaies ”
with spurious tips on the cese, nost of waich we investigated. All of these vere
soon discredited, but they are still coming in.

During this phase of our work, we served primarily in support of the FBI,

vhich wes entrusted by the President with the major responsibility for the

investigation. The Department of State photogreshed its entire file on


13-00000

OSWALD and passed then to us, and the Fat gave us a copy of the Sovies
Coasuler file on OSWALD vaich bai boan publicly given by the Boviet Aubassator
to the Secretary of State. On Friday 6 December 1963, Deputy Attorney General
Katzenbech invited us to review the FBI's comprehensive report on the case to
make sure our sources were not jeopardized and that our information was correctly
quoted, We found the report highly interesting emi no threst to our security, as
long as it ves read only ty the authorized investigative bodies.

After the first fev days, the CIA investigation of the case vas haniiled
ot Headquarters by a staff usually charged xk with investigation and analysis of
the post inportant security cases, and by officers and analysts of our Western
Scaischere Division.

As Boon as our Mexico City Station realized that Lee OSWALD vas the prime
suspect, it began re-ocreaning all the written telephone transcripts in ita
files m covering the Soviet Eubassy for the pertinent period. The actual tapes
were elso reviewed, bub mary of them hat been erased after the normal tvo woeks

wait. Several calls believed to involve OSWALD were discovered mt and their

As far os our records show, OSWAID did not phone the Soviet or Cuben

could get @ visa, and the conversation ended. (There 1s no special reason to
tie this in with OSWALD, who is now known to bave re-entered the U.S. at Laredo tha
some day.)

OBRAID's dealing with KGB men OBYEDKOV and KOSPIXOV was nothing more than a grin

Azbosssdor to Mexico Joaquin HERWANDEZ Armas on 26 Now 1963, the day after Silvia
