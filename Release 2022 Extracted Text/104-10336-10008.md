Re: — Status of CIA Responses to Assassination Records Review Board’s Requests for
Aditi ati Records

Dear John:

I am writing to follow-up on our telephone call earlier today and to convey my serious
concern about the status of CIA’s responses to the Review Board’s requests for
additional information and records. Although CIA has completed its responses to
several requests, and many others have been answered in part, a significant number of
requests have not been answered — including some that were made more than two
years ago. On many occasions we have been assured that responses would be
forthcoming, only to have promised dates come and go without answers. It is now
extremely important that these requests be answered promptly so that we may conduct
a proper follow-up if necessary. The issues that we can now identify as being of the
highest priority are identified in the text below by double asterisks (**)' and we request
that they be answered within the next month. We request that the remaining requests
be answered by April.1, 1998.

The remainder of this letter is divided into two parts: first, a listing of the formal
requests for information and records, and second, a listing of the informal requests for
information and records. Please. let me know if your understanding of any of the’
following points differs from ours so that we can resolve any potential discrepancies.

‘As identified more fully below, the issues are: CIA-1 Organizational Material,
CIA-6 Cables and Dispatches, CIA-13 Backchannel Communications, CIA-IR-03
HTLINGUAL Documents, CIA-IR-04 Disposition of Angleton Files, CLA-IR-07 Claude
Barnes Capehart, CIA-IR-15 Electronic “take” from Mexico City, CLA-IR-21 DRE
Monthly Operational Reports, CIA-IR-22 “A” Files on Clay Shaw and Jim Garrison.

:GIA-IR-09 George Bush Computer Search.

The Review Board provided CIA with a copy of an FBI document, dated
November 29, 1963, prepared under the name of John Edgar Hoover, which
states: “The substance of the foregoing information [on the assassination of
President Kennedy] was orally furnished to Mr. George Bush of the Central
Intelligence Agency ....” We have been informed that the DO has no record of a
“George Bush” being in the employ of CIA in 1963 with the exception of

Mr. George William Bush who has already given a swom affidavit that he is not
the “George Bush” in question. It is our understanding that the CIA has
confirmed that the search query included George Herbert Walker Bush prior to
1970. CIA should determine whether George Herbert Walker Bush is the person
to whom the memorandum refers and should provide a definitive statement
regarding the scope of its search and the basis of its conclusion. Any and all
personnel files of George Herbert Walker Bush should be reviewed to determine
whether he had any affiliation with CLA during the 1963 period. Once the formal
statement is provided, this request will be complete.

CIA-IR-10 IG Reports.

CIA will determine whether the IG’s office maintains an index or inventory of its
reports and determine whether the IG’s office prepared a report on the handling
of Oswald. Since April 1997, CIA has had no response and no time frame for a
response.

CIA-IR-11 Warren Commission Critics.

We are asking that CIA determine whether it possesses any files or records on
Warren Commission critics Edward J. Epstein, Josiah Thompson, Mark Lane,
Harold Weisberg, or Sylvia Meagher. The Review Board is not requesting
information per se regarding any FOIA requests by these individuals or any
Public Affairs news clippings.’ Since April 1997, CIA has had no response and
no time frame for a response.

°To the extent that CIA possesses FOIA files or records on any of these
individuals, and to the extent that those records contain information that was not filed
with the courts, such records are being requested for review by the Review Board.

SUBJECT: Call from (ban Mulqueen} OP/FOIA
re update on OP Name Trace: George Bush
(Previous results attached)

Barry,

\ Dan, called this morning to indicate that he had
retrieved the folder on George W. Bush, the individual who
had been a GS-05 Watch Officer in 1963. The only other
information in the file was that George W. Bush resigned
from the Agency 15 February 1964 and went to work for DIA.

{ Dan| added that he still had been unable to locate the file

on George H. Bush referred to in his 14 March call.

I told ‘Dan! that unless he heard from me in the next couple
of hours, he should consider this a closed query.

14 March 1997

SUBJECT: OP NAME TRACE - George Bush

1. On 14 March 1997, Joe Murphy asked me to conduct an
Office of Personnel name trace on George Bush. Joe advised
that other searches with DO, etc., were also being

conducted. This George Bush was not the former DCI or
former President, but a person supposedly associated with
the Agency in the 60's who may have been given information
about the Kennedy assassination.

2. I learned from voice mail that the OP Information
Officer, \Yean Kadaris, _$57636, was on leave and would not
return to the office until Monday, 17 March.
contacted the OP/FOIA Officer, ‘Dan Mulqueen,.

-fMulqueen/ questioned the direct call, indicating these
requests usually come through Becky Rant. I explained the
nature of my request and told him I would follow up with a
call to Becky Rant's office advising them of my call. This
was done by a call to.Pat Berl on 14 March who said she
would advise Becky of ‘the name trace request.

3. Mr. iulqueen| called later that day to indicate two
possible hits oa George Bush, as follows:

a. George W. Bush
a 5x8 card record identified by\ “No. 237286.
Per(Dan, it was not known if this was an
Employee Number and was thought it might
rather be a Security File Number. Dan)
suggested this be pursued with Office of
Personnel Security. The card record
indicated dates of service as 29 Sep 63 -
15 Feb 64 (resigned). Mr. Bush appeared to
be a GS-05 Watch Officer, with the office

He was born

b. George H. Bush
microfilm record showing #80-01155R00010096,
an indicator that the file was sent to
Archives in 1980. The file could not be
found. The name does not appear in any other
OP data bases.

4. Barry Harrelson has been advised and is awaiting
results of other component name traces.

Senior Reviewer

SUBJECT: ARRB Request No. CIA-IR-9, George Bush

1. The following is responsive to subject request.

xecords in an attempt to determine if an individual
identified as “George Bush of the Central Intelligence
Agency” in a certain FBI document dated November 1963 was
George Herbert Walker Bush. That search determined the
Agency has no record of any association with George Herbert
Walker-Bush during the 1963 time period.

3. I£ you require anything further in this regard,

please advise.
