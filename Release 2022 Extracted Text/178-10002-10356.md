On April 7, 1975 I testified as a witness before the
Commission on CIA Activities Within the United States
(Commission). As I reflected overnight about my answers
to certain questions, my recollection was refreshed and
the next morning I contacted the Executive Director of the
Commission, David W. Belin, and stated that I wished to
make some additions to the record, I conferred with

Mr. Belin at the offices of the Commission at 712 Jackson
Place, N.W., Washington, D.C.,°:and then Mr. Belin asked

me a number of questions to which I gave answers which

were recorded on tape. After receiving a-transcript of

the tape, I made certain additional corrections. The
following are the questions and my answers, as I have
corrected them. (There is one question and answer that

I have stricken because it is a matter of pure speculation.)

Mr. Belin: This a memorandum of a conference with McGeorge

Bundy on April 8, 1975. Mr. Bundy has refreshed
his recollection following his testimony before the Commission
on April 7 and wishes to make some additions to the record.

Mr. Bundy: You asked me yesterday whether I had any recollecti
of hearing the word "poison", or something to.
to that effect--whether I had any recollection of that kind
of activity or proposal in relation to the Castro regime
and I think I said I did not, and I did not as of yesterday.
But overnight I have had a vague recollection, which I cannot
pinpoint in time, that there was discussion that I knew about
at some time of a proposal or scheme or project that did ~
involve poison, and the characteristic that sticks in my
memory is that it would have involved a rather large-scale
use of poison and, as I recollect it, it never came anywhere
near approval. Proposals under the MONGOOSE scheme which
did come from time to time (mostly not with respect to
assassination) were reviewed in the first instance for
practicability and only after that for wisdom or political
rightness, and I recall NO proposal for liquidation that 5G
ever got past the first stage to the second.

Mr. Belin: I also talked to you, Mr. Bundy, about whether

or not there might have been any discussion in
early 1961 or any other time with regard to a request from
the White House to the CIA for the CIA to develop what was
called an executive action capability, which was defined
as a general stand-by capability to carry out assassinations
when required. Do you ever remember any discussions along
those lines?’

Mr. Bundy: Well, I recall the words “executive action capa-

bility" more clearly today than I did yesterday,
and I think I said yesterday that they rang some sort of
bell. But I do NOT have any recollection as to when I
knew about that or who requested it ox how much was done
under it. I don't recall having any continuing interest
in or information about that particular activity.

Mr. Belin: Do you recall that executive action capability

On was in substance discussed as a general stand-by

gcapability to carry out assassinations at that time--I'm
pot saying there was direction to undertake a plan but at
Wileast the development of the stand-by capability?

Mr. Bundy: I think it was something like that--a plan to
have some. kind of stand-by capability for action
against individuals.

Mr. Belin: Now, I'm going to turn to the Summer of 1962.

- Before we started this transcribing of your
remarks you indicated that you don't remember any specific
plan pertaining to the attempted poisoning of any Cuban
leader during 1961, but that you do remember some dis-
cussions that may have developed into this area sometime
in 1962. Is that accurate?

Mr. Bundy: Well, I think perhaps a slightly more precise
way of. saying it is that you have described to
me a broad outline of plans as you understand them that
existed in January or February 1961 and I simply have no +
recollection of plans that meet that description. I believe
my memory tells me in a more general way that my knowledge
of a scheme or idea of using poison probably relates to
the year 1962. .

Mx. Belin: Do you remember any discussions at any meeting
of the MONGOOSE group where this might have been

discussed? Either the general plan of possible liquidation |

or the particular plan of poison?

Mr. Bundy: I don't have any recollection of where or how

I heard about the poisoning possibility. I do
know that I ‘never knew of any approval of such a plan.
My recollection is the opposite--that it was a hairbrained
scheme that did not receive approval even on the ground
of practicability as distinct from the question of whether
you would make a final decision to go ahead. Now, as to
meetings where such things might have been discussed, the
only one I have any recollection of--and it is a refreshed
recollection--I would not have known about it a month ago--
is the one which we discussed yesterday on August 10, 1962
and I do NOT have any recollection of what specifically
was said in that meeting.

Mr. Belin: Do you have any recollection that there was any.
direction NOT to undertake any such plans?

Mr. Bundy: I think there was a general attitude toward

this matter in which those working on covert
operations were sometimes permitted to produce proposals,
although I recall nobody encouraging them to do so. As —
I said yesterday, I draw a sharp distinction between con-.
sidering contingencies of this sort and actually giving
them approval. That I think is the way in which the Kennedy
Administration approached the matter. I do not think there
was a flat general ban on considering such possibilities.

Mr. Belin: Earlier, before we started taping, you said

that if there had been any specific discussion
of that, that you were not a party to it and that it might
have~-

Mr. Bundy: A discussion of what?
Mr. Belin: --of a direction to carry out a plan, that you

certainly were not a party to such a discussion.
Is that what you said?

AUWdGIT GUOd ‘a GTWaXD AHL WOUA AdOOOLOHA.

Mr. Bundy: I am absolutely certain that I never knew of

ox believed that there was any authorization
to go ahead with an effort to liquidate Castro, or any
other Cuban leader.

Next question and answer deleted
Mr. Belin: Is there anything else that you want to add

so far as clarifying or correcting your
testimony of April 7 before the Commission?

Mr. Bundy: You asked me yesterday whether I had met Mr. William
Harvey--I think that's his name--

Mr. Belin: Yes

Mr. Bundy: --and I said I recollected the name and that

I thought I had seen him in large meetings.
I can check my appointment calendar which is the only
official document of record that I have from my Washington
days and see whether I met him in smaller meetings or alone
if that would be helpful to you.

Mr. Belin: It would. I'd like to have.you do it, please.

Mx. Bundy: Fine.

Mr. Belin: OK. Well, thank you very much. y

(END OF TAPE)

Following my return to New York I checked my appointment
calendar and there is no entry of William Harvey's name.
We did not make a habit of listing all the participants
in large meetings, but the calendar would ordinarily show
his name if he had come to see me alone or with only one
or two others.

I have no further changes or corrections to make with regard
to my testimony before the Commission.
