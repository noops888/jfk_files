Past experience has shown-that contact with ACGM
associates on the part of visitors from the United States
; is frequently of more than usual significance.. As the Bureau
# is aware, the ACGM is. not a formal organization and therefore,
‘ has no "members"; . The name American “Communist Group in
Mexico’ (ACGM) is a term developed by informants of this office
several years ago to designate the American .communists who had
for one reason-or another left the United States ‘and taken up
residence ‘in Mexico. Those individuals:'were not merely
ordinary cell members of the CP. USA prior to their arrival in
Mexico ‘but occupied leadership positionS in’ various functions
€ CP USA. While in.Mexico they: have continued to. main-
tain their communist-oriented “ideology. and firm-desire. to see
the government. of the United States overthrown, “The bifurcation
ofthe communist movement ‘in the. United.’ States resulting from
the development of the. Chinese communist. "‘theories and programs,
aS well as the development of the "New Left" and ‘the appearance
of militant black nationalism,..is reflected among the‘ associates
‘of “the ACGM. Although these individuals vary in their support
of the ‘Soviets, the Chine ©, the New.Left ‘and the militant
black nationalists, they still retain. the’ common. denominator
of dedication to the overthrow ‘of the U.S, government.
Although not openly engaged in subversiveactivities in Mexico
order to avoid being expelled *by. the Mexican government,
ey have continued to support ‘subversive movements inthe
ted States by givin, oth moral and financial support to those
bversive groups. : Ree ee ie aaeae

The ACGM is a very tightly=knit. group’ and coverage
as welias attempts to infiltrate informants into’ the group,
has shown that they accept on an equal-‘basis“only- visitors
iously known to them as’ "fellow revolutionaries" or who
to Mexico well documented ‘and recommended ‘by’ "trusted"
| “i comrades in the U. S.. Any person ‘to.whom ‘suspicion is attached (w)

--through failure to obtain proper. recommendations is ostracized.

in view of the makeup of this group, coverage has
been concentrated largely onthe principal. figures. ‘who are
e contact points: for Americans coming .to ‘Mexico, such as.CHARLES
OLIKOFF, and ELIZABETH CATLETT MORA :(Bufile.-100-395934)

While coverage is concentrated insofar as possible
on the SMOLIKOFFs, the MORAs and the. BELFRAGES, information
is available through informant coverag nd-confidential
coverage (maintained by CIA oncerning other associates of
the ACGM Who although*not as prominent as contact points: are
nevertheless as. selective in the political orientation of the
people they.accept in their homes and with whom they freely
associate.. Admittedly, coverage isnot) complete enough to
reveal all of ‘the subversive statements’ and activities of
the American visitors who are in contact with these ACGM
associates, but it is believed ‘that ‘their“acceptance.*by the
established ACGM associates isa very: good’ indication of the
tical orientation of those visitors.: Since the visiting
Americans come from widely scattered parts. of the United
States, this office is in‘no position to-evaluate their sub-
versive. potential in the absence’ of prior correspondence from
the Bureau or the domestic field. .Whenever.‘any information is
received which might assist in identifying the visitor or the
. locale from which he or she originates':in the U. S., this
1 ‘office has furnished that information to thé Bureau and the
| interested field office for information. and--any action. deemed
f." desirable. : Even though the limited’ coverage available: to this
office in. some cases does not reveal actual: subversive
act. ies.on the part of the visitors; ‘the fact that they are
accepted as contacts by associates of the“ACGM is sufficient
ke grounds, to alert. the Bureau and,.the -interésted field offices

se concerning the foreign travel of probable’ security: subjects. a)

This office remains vigilant ‘to fulfill the Bureau's
ponsibilities in detecting and identifying potential couriers,
Espionage agents and individuals: who might be-operating in a
covert intelligence capacity. To.satisfy this: responsibility,
logica ources vare constantly reminded to remain alert to the
i cation of individuals visiting’ Mexico and.who contact
bjects of interest residing in Mexico... Because of the sub-
ve potential of ACGM associates and these visitors, it is
iieved that initial inquiries by ‘the domestic. office involved

desirable whenever possible to detérmine the residence
oyment of the visitor and review records: for previous
rsive activity. A determination: as.:to whether,..in ‘the
light of information developed,. the visitor represents'a danger
