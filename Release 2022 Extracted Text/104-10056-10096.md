Attachment '1

Sorgio Vicente ARCACHA Smith (Enclosure 2 of reference memorandum)

DPOB: 22 January 1923, Cuba

1.

Traces on ARCACHA do not reflect the date he first

arrived in the U.S.

However,

he became the FRENTE REVOLU-

CIONARIO DEMOCRATICO (FRD) delegate in New Orleans prior

to the Bay of Pigs invasion and continued in that position

until the FRD ceased to function.

The FRD was the predecessor

vi the CUBAN REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL,.

and was organized and

suyported by the Agency.

The organization was used as a

front for recruitment of Brigade 2506 for the invasion.

period ARCACHA reported to the FRD headquarters

in Miami through a post office box in Coral Gables, and

éportedly maintained extensive relations with the

FBI and Immigration offices.

Two of his regular

FBI contacts were a Mi. De Bruce and the deceased Guy

Banister®

2.

ARCACHA was also one of the promoters of the

FRIENDS OF DEMOCRATIC CUBA, INC (FDC) which was incorporated

in New Orleans on 6 January 1961. This organization was

ostensibly created by several New Orleans business and

political figures, including the deceased former FBI agent;

Guy Banister,

to collect money to aid Cubans in their

fight against Communism.

According to the articles of

IncorporatIon,

these donations would also be used to support

the FRD and the funds were to be channeled through ARCACHA,

less a percentage to be retained by

the FDC.

An

investi-

gation conducted by a reliable Miami Station asset concluded

that the FDC was organized strictly for the personal gain

of the promoters with the approval and collaboration of

ARCACHA.

The investigation produced no evidence that any

individual donations were ever solicited or received and

recommended that the funds of the Stevedores Union and the

books of the New orleans Exporters Company be investigated

for evidence of personal gain and possible evidence of

federal tax evasion, since both the president of the New

Alfred chattenden, were ex

officials of the FDC.

Approximately one month after the

FDC was created,. strong criticism from some prominent Cubans

put the organization out of business.

Information in an immigration card reflects that

ARCACHA travelled to Caracas,

Venezuela

unspecified

date. His address in Venezuela was HOTEL TIUNA,

Caracas,

and his US audress was listed as 4523 Duplesses Street,

New Orleans.

Passport No. 00433.

Edward S. BUTLER (Paragraph 7 (A) of reference memorandum)

In January 1965 Subject's organization (INCA), sponsored

the New Orleans appearance of Juanita CASTRO shortly after

her arrival in the US.

INCA had a particular interest in

Miss CASTRO since they distributed hundreds of tapes

contam-

ing Miss CASTRO's declarations when she was

surfaced in

Mexico.

A JNWAVE asset; who is Miss CASTRO's business manager,

handled the planning and arrangements for the New Orleans

visit with INCA officials.

The only subsequent contact

between the JMWAVE asset and Edward BUTLER occurred

when

BUTLER was recently in Miami promoting the

INCA film on

"CASTRO-HITLER in HAVANA".

See Attachment 2 for a summary

of the INCA organization.

Emilio SANTANA (paragraph 7 C of reference memorandum)

DPOB: 7 Sept 1935,

1936 and

Matanzasy Sept 1937

1.

Subject is probably identifiable with Emilio SANTANA

who was

Gatindo for an intiltration team.

recruited by JMWAVE in December 1960 as a

guide

SANTANA was paid a monthly

salary under provisions of his

MOC until he was terminated

on 15 October 1963 when the ratline developed by the team

became inoperable due to occupation of the

target area by

Soviet technicians.

Another compelling reason

for SANTANA'S

termination stemmed from his untruthful reporting concerning

certain aspects of the team operations.

2. In an attempt to establish positive identification,

JMWAVE

obtained a report from the Dade County (Miami)

Sheriff's office that an Enilio SANTANA (no matronymic)

born 6 July 1936 in Cuba, was declared a fugitive from

Louisiana on a federal warrant 22 December 1965, FBI Sheet

132287F, based on two counts of burglery in Louisiana.

He was arrested and booked by the Dade County Sheriff's

office on 2 February 1966 and was presumably sent back to

Louisiana.

At the time of his arrest SANTANA gave his

address as 851 SW 4th Street, Miami, which is the same

address shown on an old immigration

Eam when he was

living in Miami. Headquarters files indicate SANTANA is:

separated from his wife who apparently still resides at

the old Miami address.. Since SANTANA's date of birth varies

on various documents

in his 201 file,

variation in birth

date on his arrest sheet is not conclusive.

did give his former address to the arresting officers

indicates he is Emilio SANTANA Galindo.

A 1962 immigration

form includes a photograph which could be obtained from

JIMWAVE for identification purposes if this becomes necessary.

Although JMWAVE has had no contact with SANTANA

since

his termination,

there is a note in Station files

dated 23 June 1964 that SANTANA used the Agency as his

employer

on an auto

credit application.

Carlos QUIROGA (Paragraph 7(C) of reference memorandum)

Subject is possibly identifiable with, Carlos QUIROGA,

a former student at Lousiana State University who was a

candidate for

the Agency Student Recruitment Program.

This

involved recruitment of Cuban students

in

the US who would

return to Cuba as agents in place.

an individual of the same name was an electrical engineer,

residing at 3134 Derby Place, New Orleans, in December 1964.

It was on outgrowth of the activist student group in Cuba

which fought against BATISTA and later against CÄSTR i960

Many of the leaders came into exile around September

and were subsequently trained and infiltrated into Cuba

by the Agency in late 1960 where they operated by obtain-

ing intelligence setting up action teams, etc., up through

the Bay of Pigs invasion.

While the DRE

was initially set

up as a psych warfare outfit, the organization was given a

large amount of paramilitary

aid in funds and material.

After the Bay of Pigs,

the DRE engaged in independent

military actions, which declined at Agency direction and

Members were used through 1966

as

political action agents, for publishing propaganda which

was sent throughout the Hemisphere,

attending international

student meetings at Agency direction, and producing radio

programs and special propaganda campaigns.

After the cutback in military operations, nany

THE INFORMATION COUNCIL OF THE AMERICAS, INC. (INCA)

INCA is an anti-Communist propaganda organization

with headquarters in New Orleans tapes and

that disseminates

English

and foreign language propaganda

'films on a world-

wide basis, conducts public forums of an extremist

political nature.

The organizational impetus and funds

apparently come from wealthy New Orleans figures including

Dr. Alton OCHSNER, of the OCHSNER CLINIC, and Willard E.

ROBERTSON.

In recent years funds have been supplied by the

SCHICK SAFETY RAZOR COMPANY.

An INCA letterhead listing all

the officers and officials has been requested from JMWAVE,

which has had some casual correspondence with the organiza-.

tion concerning Miss Juanita CASTRO.

There is no indication of any Agency relationship

with INCA prior to January 1965 when INCA sponsored Miss

CASTRO's appearance in New Orleans.

At that time an Agency

asset who functioned as Miss CASTRO's business manager was

involved with INCA officials in planning the New Orleans

visit

where Miss CASTRO was given an award at a dinner

sponsored by INCA.

The dinner, which was attended by civic

leaders and representatives of

all news media,

took place

shortly after Miss CASTRO's defection and there was

considerable interest in her appearance. INCA was particularly

interested since it bad distributed hundreds of English

and Spanish language tapes containing her statements when

she was surfaced in Mexico.

In October 1966 INCA again

requested that Miss CASTRO

appear as a guest speaker in

major American cities in connection with the release of

the INCA motion picture production "HITLER IN HAVANA".

Following various reviews of the film,

IMWAVE decided

film would probably become controversial and it would be

inadvisable to permit Miss CASTRO to accept the invitation.

Because of INCA's extremist political orientation, JMWAVE

wanted to avoid any more involvement between Miss CASTRO

and INCA and the

Station asset, in his capacity as business

manager, has managed to prevent this.

There has been only

one casual contact between our asset

and Edward BUTLER,

Executive Vice-President of INCA, since Miss CASTRO's

New Orleans trip.

This took place recently

when BUTLER was

in the area promoting the "HITLER IN HAVANA" film.

3.

According to IMWAVE, INCA officials have never

indicated in any way that they are aware of Agency control

and direction of Miss CASTRO or her business agent, and there

is no indication that INCA officials have had any official

contact with Agency officers.

FRENTE REVOLUCIONARIO DEMOCRATICO (FRD)

(CUBAN DEMOCRATIC REVOLUTIONARY FRONT

1.

The FRD was created with Agency assistance,

guidance and financial support in May 1960 and consisted

of several anti-CASTRO groups.

The FRD was formed as a

political action, propaganda and

military unit.

Initial

actions consisted of extensive radio and printed propaganda,

demonstrations, and trips throughout the Hemisphere to gain

support for the fight against CASTRO.

The FRD also functioned

as the front organization for recruiting the members of

the Bay of Pigs

invasion force and carried out a massive

program of social assistance to Brigade 2506 members

in

training camps and their families.

Although the FRD head- .

quarters were based in Miami, delegates were assigned to

other

areas which

included New Orleans,

Louisiana,

Tampa,

Florida,

and Mexico City,

to gather

intelligence

coordinate Cuban refugee activities.

and

In late 1960 or early 1961 the CUBAN REVOLUTIONARY

COUNCIL (CRC) was formed to coordinate and direct FRD

activities and this group was headed by Agency and White

House sponsored Dr. Jose MIRO Cardona, assisted by Manuel

ARTIME and Dr. Antonio VARONA. . Both the FRD and the CRC

continued to function until October 1961 when the FRD was

completely absorbed by the CRC in order to avoid the confusion:

resulting from duplication of personnel, activities and*

and top White House aides.

Because of the magnitude

of the FRD and CRC operations and

the Agency participation

in the activities and funding of the groups, a large number

of JMWAVE and Headquarters were directly involved with both

FRD and CRC personnel.
