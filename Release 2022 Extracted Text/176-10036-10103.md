THIS REPORI IS TYPICAL OF VIEWS HELD BY CERTAIN OPPOSITIONISTS, INCLUDING THOSE

IN THE FELLOW-TRAVELLING CATEGORY. COMMENTS OF TRIS NATURE HAVE ALSO BEEN MADE

BY GOVERNMENT PROVOKERS SEEKING 10 PROVOKE AMERICAN REACTION. THE LINE THAT

DIEM IS ACCEPTABLE, BUT THAT HIS FAMILY, ADMINISTRATION, AND PROGRAMS ARE NOT,

IS ALSO CHARACTERISTIC OF VARIOUS OPPOSITION ELEMENTS AS WELL AS SOME SEGMENTS

OF THE LEFT. THE ESTIMATE CONTAINED HEREIN ON A NUMBER OF SUBJECTS, INCLUDING

THE APPRAISAL THAT THE STRATEGIC HAMLET PROGRAM IS HICHLY DANGEROUS TO THE

GOVERNMENT OF VIETNAM OR TO AMERICAN OBJECTIVES, IS NOT ACCEPTED:

PAE-

TWO,

THE TWO REPRESENTATIVES INDICATED THAT, IF AMERICAN AID IS NOT

FORTHCOMING, OTHER SOURCES WILL BE CONTACTED. IF THE AMERICANS

HELP THE NATIONALIST CAUSE OF THE OPPOSITIONISTS, THEY WILL

HAVE SOME MEASURE OF CONTROL OVER THE RESULTS; OTHERWISE;

THEY WILL HAVE NONE: (FIELD COMMENT. FVS 8654, IDCS-3/540,447, REPORTEC

AN EARLIER DISCUSSION BY THESE INDIVIDUALS.)

2. ACCORDING TO THESE OPPOSITIONISTS,. THE COUNTRY HAS

REACHED A COMPLETE IMPASSE AND SOMETHING MUST HAPPEN SOON. IF

DIEM SHOULD DIE SUDDENLY, THE RESULT WOULD BE CHAOS, OUT OF

WHICH THE COMMUNISTS WOULD EMERGE AS THE ONLY BENEFICIARIES:

DIEM REMAINS IN POWER ONLY AS THE RESULT OF AMERICAN MILITARY

SUPPORT, WITHOUT WHICH HE WOULD BE COMPLETELY LOST. THE DIEM.

GOVERNMENT IS WORSE THAN IMPOSSIBLE: 'THERE ARE

A NUMBER OF. GROUPS IN THE COUNTRY, SUCH AS THE HOA HO AND THE

CAO DAI, THAT ARE COMPLETELY OPPOSED TO COMMUNISM BUT CANNOT

POSSIBLY SUPPORT THE PRESENT REGIME, WHEREAS THEY COULD

SUPPORT

• SOME OTHER NATIONALIST TYPE OF GOVERNMENT. PRESIDENT DIEM

IS PERSONALLY A DECENT AND HONORABLE MAN, BUT NGO DINH NHU AND

HIS WIFE MUST BE ELIMINATED; WITHOUT THEM, IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE

¡TO RE-ORIENT DIEM...

PAGi: THREE

UNAWARE OF ARE UNWILLING TO FACE IT, THE STRATEGIC HAMLETS ARE

HEAVILY INFILTRATED WITH VIETNAMESE COMMUNISTS (VC), WHOSE

PRESENCE WILL MAKE ITSELF KNOWN IN DUE COURSE. THE REPUBLICAN

YOUTH MOVEMENT IS ONLY A LONG SERIES OF MEETINGS AND IS

COMPLETELY LACKING IN "DEPTH AS AN ORGANIZATION; IT IS A

SUPERFICIAL VENEER; GOING THROUGH VARIOUS FRUITLESS MOTIONS.

THE PRINCIPAL CRITERION FOR SELECTION OF PROVINCIAL AND

DISTRICT LEADERS IS PERSONAL OBEDIENCE TO THE REGIME; COMPETENCE

IS ONLY AN AFTERTHOUGHT.

4. IF THE SITUATION CONTINUES IN ITS PRESENT VEIN, THERE

WILL BE A RENEWED VC OFFENSIVE ON A LARGER SCALE SOON AFTER

THE ONSET OF THE RAINY SEASON, WHEN BAD WEATHER REDUCES THE

EFFECTIVENESS OF HELICOPTERS AND AIR CAPABILITY IN GENERAL.

THIS WILL_ BEGIN NEAR THE SAIGON AREA, AND, - AT THE SAME TIME

THE VE WITHIN THE "STRATEGIC HAMLETS WILL GO INTO ACTION.
