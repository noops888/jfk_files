THE TWO REPRESENTATIVES INDICATED THAT, IF AMER 1 CAN AID 1S NOT
FORTHCOMING, OTHER SOURCES WILL BE CONTACTED. IF THE AMERICANS
HELP THE NATIONALIST CAUSE OF THE OPPOSITIONISTS, THEY WILL

HAVE SOME MEASURE OF CONTROL OVER THE RESULTS; OTHERWISE,
THEY WILL HAVE’NONE? (FELD COMMENT, FVS 8654, TDcs-3/540,447, REPORTER

"AN EARLIER DISCUSSION BY THESE INDIVIDUALS, )

2. ACCORDING TO THESE .OPPOSITIONI'STS,. THE COUNTRY HAS
REACHED A COMPLETE IMPASSE AND SOMETHING MUST HAPPEN SOON, IF
DIEM SHOULD DIE SUDDENLY, THE RESULT WOULD BE CHAOS, OUT OF
WHICH THE COMMUNISTS WOULD EMERGE AS THE ONLY BENEFICIARIES:
DIEM REMAINS IN POWER ONLY AS THE RESULT OF AMERICAN MILITARY
SUPPORT, WITHOUT WHICH HE WOULD BE COMPLETELY LOST. THE DIEM
GOVERNMENT 1S WORSE THAN IMPOSSIBLE...’ ' THERE “ARE
A NUMBER OF. GROUPS IN THE COUNTRY, SUCH AS THE HOA HAO “ANDTHE
CAO DAI, THAT ARE COMPLETELY OPPOSED TO COMMUNISM BUT CANNOT
POSSIBLY SUPPORT THE PRESENT REGIME, WHEREAS THEY ‘coud SUPPORT

SOME OTHER NATIONALIST TYPE OF GOVERNMENT. PRESIDENT DIEM

:.1S PERSONALLY A DECENT AND HONORABLE MAN, BUT NGO DINH NHU AND
HIS WIFE MUST BE. ELIMINATED; WITHOUT THEM, 1T WOULD BE POSSIBLE

TO RE-ORIENT DIEM...

ALTHOUGH THE AMERICANS AND THE GOVERNMENT OF VIETNAM ARE EITHER

UNAWARE OF OR UNWILLING TO FACE IT, THE STRATEGIC HAMLETS ‘ARE
HEAVILY INFILTRATED WITH VIETNAMESE COMMUNISTS (VC), WHOSE
PRESENCE WILL MAKE ITSELF KNOWN IN DUE COURSE.’ THE REPUBLICAN
YOUTH MOVEMENT IS ONLY A LONG SERIES OF MEETINGS AND 1S
COMPLETELY LACKING IN"DEPTH AS AN ORGANIZATION; IT IS A
SUPERFICIAL VENEER, GOING THROUGH VARIOUS FRUITLESS MOTIONS,
THE PRINCIPAL CRITERION FOR:.SELECTION OF PROVINCLAL AND
DISTRICT LEADERS’ 1S “PERSONAL OBEDIENCE TO THE REGIME; COMPETENCE
1S ONLY AN AFTERTHOUGHT.

4, IF THE STTUATION-GONTINUES IN ITS PRESENT VEIN, THERE
WILL BE A RENEWED VC OFFENSIVE ON A LARGER SCALE - SOON AFTER
THE ONSET OF THE’ RAINY SEASON, WHEN BAD WEATHER REDUCES THE
EFFECTIVENESS ‘OF HELICOPTERS AND AIR CAPABILITY IN GENERAL.
THIS WILL_BEGIN NEAR THE SAIGON AREA, AND,-AT THE SAME TIME
THE VC WITHIN THE “STRATEGIC HAMLETS WILL GO INTO ACTION.
