Inasmuch as Philadelphia is considering the po-

tential of TALLENT as an informant, all offices receiving

organization within the Philadelphia area.

Future extensive

interviews are arranged with TALLENT at which the organizational

setup, structure of cells, and identities of members known to

Philadelphia all information bearing on TALLENT's rellability

and veracity.

accord with the "Minutemen" have personal axes to grind and/or

personal aspirations of becoming National leaders.
