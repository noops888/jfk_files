exiled former President

of Cuba, into using the above described camp in the Dominican

: T-l said that TRUJILLO had even attempted to get

PRIO to make a personal visit to the Dominican Republic, but

that. PRIO had not fallen for that invitation.

he was of the opinion that the Cubans who received training

at this camp would have been killed under order of Generalissimo

TRUJILLO had It not been for public reaction and the attitude

taken by the United States Government with regard to the dis-

1956 of Professor JESUS DE GALINDEZ,

alleged implication of GERALD

pilot who was reportedly killed in the Dominican Republic in

December, 1956.

T-1 said that he personally advised PRIO not to

He was told by RODRIGUEZ that he would be in

Ciudad Trujillo for about twenty days for training so that

he could go into Cuba and give similar training to other

groups of Cubans, preparatory to overthrowing the govern-

of Cuba.

When the plane landed at Cludad Trujillo, the

Cubans were met at the airport by a Cuban, POLICARPO SOLER,

who was known in Cludad Trujillo as General JOAQUIN RODRIGUEZ,

and right-hand man to TRUJILLO. POLICARPO asked the Cuban

arrivals,

"Are you members of

Military Intelligence Service.) The group answered in the

negative.

The group was taken in several cars by POLICARPO

and others to a camp located five kilometers from Cludad

Trujillo on Canatera Duarte Road.

This camp had previously

been the barracks of the Fourth Artillery Battalion of

Dominican Army.

upon arrival there, a Cuban, Colonel GUZMAN, took

up their passports and papers.

GUZMAN told them,

"TRUJILLO,

POLICARPO and I control this camp."

THe, along with the others, was told to sign a

pink sheet of

paper without being given time to read it.

He said that these sheets contained the names and addresses

of these men and their relatives in Cuba and the United

States, along with information apparently extracted from

their passports.

He

said that on their first day in Ciudad Trujillo,

POLICARPO told them that CARLOS PRIO was a thief,

that when

he was in Cuba, PRIO had tried to catch him, and

that he had

no love for PRIO.

POLICARPO bragged that he was going to be-

come Chief of the Cuban Army. He3 said that POLICARPO was

known to him and the other Cubans as a Cuban gangster. They

were

surprised to find him in charge of this camp and im-

mediately under TRUJILLO.

POLICARPO wore the uniform of the

Dominican Army.

The Cubans were issued green Dominican Army fatigue

uniforms, without Insignia, and shoes. A seven-day-a-week

schedule was announced.

They were given no freedom

to leave the camp, although a few favorites were given this

privilege.

There were about sixty men in this camp when Informant

arrived.

The men were given training in the use of :45

calibre

automatic colt;

•45 calibre Thompson submachine gun;

• 30 calibre Browning automatic machine gun, both water and

air-cooled types; Mausers; Springfield rifles; o1 mm mortars;

hand grenades; and the knife.

They were taught commando

tactics in country and city warfare.

This training took

place at a Dominican training camp near Central Rio Haina,

to which they were transported in Dominican Army trucks.

All weapons were Dominican Army issue.

They were fed two meals a day on a diet of rice

and beans. He

lost twenty pounds.

Military Instructors were two Dominicans, Captain

PEREZ PEREZ, a Lieutenant COCO, and MIGUEL SANCHEZ, a

ing the

"Pandore" which he had recently purchased

and on

which he is now residing.

at Street #15 and 30th Street, Vedado, Havana.

His daughter,

ESTRELLA DIAZ, resides at 2939 North River Drive, with her

husband, E. D. POLHAMUS, where DIAZ can also be reached.

DIAZ said that several months ago a Cuban whom he

knew only

"CARLOS" had come to him stating that

to purchase a boat for the purpose of transporting cargo and

passengers between Puerto Rico, Port of Spain and other

Caribbean points.

"CARLOS" came to

DIAZ and asked him to look over the "Corinthea"

döcked in the Miami River.

On about May 1, 1957,

"CARLOS"

again contacted DIAZ and they again went to and examined

"Corinthea"

without contacting the owner or caretaker.

On about May 15, 1957, "CARLOS" again came to

DIAZ and said that he had

and was interested in

purchasing the "Corinthea."

"CARLOS" drove DIAZ in a blue

chevrolet car to the

"Corinthea" where they contacted an

American with whom

"CARLOS" spoke in English. DIAZ said

that as he does not understand any English he did not know

the substance of this conversation.

"CARLOS" told DIAY

that the American wanted $12,000.00 for the boat and DIAZ

advised "CARLOS" that the boat was not worth this much

DIAZ explained many Cubans come to him for advice

on boats knowing that he is in the business of buying and

reconditioning

boats and is considered somewhat of an ex-

pert by his fellow countrymen.

On the next day, "CARLOS" came to the "Pandore"

A portion of this interview was conducted in the

office of Breece's Fish and Lobster Market in the presence

Of CHARLES CARVER and HAROLD GOLDSTEIN.

AMBROSIO identi-

fied CARVER as being the American whom he had first met on

the boat and with whom CALIXTO SANCHEZ had conducted pre-

liminary negotiations.

DIAZ recalled having gone on the "Corinthea" on

a trial run prior to the sale of the boat, with CARVER,

CALIXTO SANCHEZ WHITE and three other Cubans.

He believed

that two of these Cubans remained on the boat after the

boat docked, after which CALIXTO SANCHEZ, AMBROSIO and

one of the other Cubans went with CARVER

to Breece's Fish

and Lobster Market where the purchase was consummated.

AMBROSIO claimed that he had not received any compensation

from CALIXTO SANCHEZ WHITE or anybody else for his part

in the purchase of this boat.

He said that CALIXTO SANCHEZ

Indicated that the boat was going to be placed in the name

of his wife whose name DIAZ did not know.

DIAZ also claimea

that he did not know the source of CALIXTO's money and that

at no time did CALIXTO confide to him that the boat was go-

ing to be used for any unlawful purpose.

DIAZ also claimed

that he had nothing further to do with the boat after he

went with CALIXTO SANCHEZ and the other Cuban to Joneg!

Boatyard to arrange for the boat to be docked

there.

Report of Investigator JOSEPH A. THURMAN,

ment was taken from JOSE BRAULIO ALEMAN Y GUTIERREZ, age 26,

to the present government in Cuba.

He admitted knowing PRIO,

but denied having any knowledge of revolutionary activities

on the part of PRIO,

and he also denled having in any way

financed the "Corinthea"

expedition.

It 1s to be noted that

JOSE ALEMAN is the son of a former Minister of Education in

the PRIO government of Cuba and heis reputedly a very wealthy

extensive real estate holdings in Miami.

The "Miami Daily News" carried in its May 27,

1957 issue an article entitled "PRIO Denies Tieup to Cuba

Invasion," by MILT SOSIN,

"Miami News"

staff writer.

this article PRIO expressed the opinion

that two

insurgents

captured by the BATISTA forces had been

forced by

threats of

torture to name him as instigator of an

"invasion" of Cuba

by the

"Corinthea."

He stated "I have taken no part in any

planning of the invasion of Cuba.

Although I cannot deny

sympathy with these fighters for freedom,

I have in no way

directed

their activities."

PRIO claimed that BATISTA was

always seeking to

embarrass him with the United States

Government by

seeking to link PRIO's name with activities

against BATISTA.

UNDERWOOD alleged that BAYO admitted hav-

ing trained the followers of FIDEL CASTRO in Mexico pre-

paratory to the voyage of "damma" to Cuba where FIDEL

CASTRO landed with 82 men; and that UNDERWOOD also learned

that BAYO had sent another boatload of men and guns from

Miami to Cuba.

UNDERWOOD stated, however, BAYO's

was short lived when the "Corinthea" was intercepted with

loss öf life and capture.

He said that BAYO became panicky

and moved from place to place around New York,

(Information set forth hereinafter in this re-

Department of Investigation, Cuban National Police, ad-

vised that about 9:30 p.m.,

on August 7,

a private plane

had landed on a strip of

road under construction to the

east of Havana.

He said that according to Information ob-

tained by the police from an eye witness, the strip of

road had been lighted by the headlights of four automobiles.

Lleutenant HERNANDEZ stated that the plane had

been identified by

police as bearing

States

registration number N 69727, and pointed

out that this

was the plane which,

in March, 1957, had been purchased

by DANIEL VAZQUEZ and had later been rigged with extra

gasoline tanks and reportedly was to be used to throw

out live phosphorus bombs over Cuba.

Lieutenant HERNANDEZ

said the police were of the opinion

that the plane may have

been utilized to bring arms to Cuba from the United States.

He said that a witness, who lived nesr the landing place,

had reported that a plane had landed in the same place on

several previous occasions.

It is to be recalled that previous investigation

was conducted in March and April, 1957, based upon a report

that CARLOS PRIO SOCARRAS had purchased a Beechcraft

Registration No. N. 69727, and that a load of incendiary

bombs were to be dumped by this plane

cion then disclosed that this Beechcraft plane had been

purchased by DANIEL VAZQUEZ Y COEJO from

the Jack Adams

Aircraft sales, Inc., Walls, Mississippi, for

the sum of

$13,645.00 on March

9, 1957.

VAZQUEZ had

extra fuel tanks

installed on the plane and also had had a round hole cut

in the bottom near the rear of the plane, claiming this to

be for the purpose of aerial photography.

VAZQUEZ furnished a signed statement on April 9

and 10, 1957, claiming that he purchased

this plane with

his own money and he denied any plans for dropping in-

cendiaries on Cuba.

He admitted being a friend and

associate of PRIO,

but denied that PRIO had any interest

in this plane.

He admitted having signed an application

for registration, which

application certified,

among other

things,

that the

owner, whose name appeared on the applica-

tion,

was a citizen of

that

the United States.

VAZQUEZ claimed

he did not know that the application had

contained

such a statement.

He indicated that he planned to get the

plane re-registered in the name of a corporation to

known as Vamar,

Miami, in order to avoid violating

any regulations of the CAA.

Report of Immigration & Naturalization Service

Investigator JOSEPH A. THURMAN, dated January

in the PRIO case reflects that ESTRADA reported

having attended a meeting with PRIO at the home of Colonel

RAFAEL ISQUIERDO,

at which time PRIO privately told ESTRADA

that BATISTA's days are numbered and that he is planning

a big expedition which would strike at three provinces at

one time.

This same report reflects that on September 10,

ESTRADA reported having attended another meeting on

September 9, 1957, at which time PRIO told ESTRADA to

stand by for an expedition; that PAULA

(JOSEPH PAULA

owner of PAULA'S Restaurant, Miami,) was handling the recruitment

for the expedition and was receiving $25,000.00 for such

services; that the contact

man in Tampa was Doctor MUNOZ

(not otherwise identified).

It is to be noted that no information has

received substantiating the above information reported

by ESTRADA and circumstances indicate that PRIO may have

intentionally planted this information with ESTRADA for the

of camouflaging other plans.

FIDEL CASTRO studiously avoided PRIO while they were in

Miami, indicating that they were not in sympathy with PRIo.

The June 10, 1957,

issue of the "Miami Daily

News carried an article entitled "Revolutionaries Here

Dis-United By Feuds" by staff writer JACK W. ROBERTS.

This article disclosed that there was a feud between the

exiles backing CASTRO's revolutionary movement

and CARLOS PRIO SOCARRAS and it pointed out

that during the

preceeding week when the CASTRO sisters staged a rally

at the Flagler Theatre in downtown Miami a CASTRO

supporter got upon the stage and denounced all past regimes

in Cuba which naturally 'included that of PRIO; that when

he started his tirade, the PRIO supporters got up

walked out of the meeting.

On May 22,

1957, T-2 stated that-he had received

information from a close

associate of CARLOS PRIO; that PRIO;

while outwardly claiming admiration of FIDEL CASTRO was

inwardly plotting his destruction. T-2 said that according

to his source, PRIO planned to draw FIDEL CASTRO out of the

Sierra Maestra Mountains so that FIDEL CASTRO could be

eliminated by the Cuban Government and that in order to achieve

this aim, PRIO was planning to send help to FIDEL to encourage

FIDEL to come out into the open.

T-2 said that according

to his source, PRIO resents the

fact that FIDEL CASTRO has

captured the imagination of the Cuban people and has become

che humber one hero of the anti-BATISTA population and that

PRIO believes that if FIDEL is killed that he will then become

the number one man.

T-ll advised that a Miami

attorney who represents some

with PRIO had disclosed that PRIO desires to serve out the

remainder of his term, this being approximately six months,

but that if elections were held in Cuba he would have no

such opportunity.

T-ll said that according to his source,

PRIO is especially concerned about FIDEL CASTRO's growing

to raise a Revolutionary force in Cuba to work with the PRIO

people, but OCHOA had replied that his best chance, politically

speaking, was through a regular political campaign. T-ll

said that his source
