SYNOPSIS: (Cont'd. )

Seized $50,000. worth of guns in Miami and arrested 2 men,
one of whom was former official in PRIO Government. On
10/13/57, U. S. Customs seized load of guns and ammunition
at Pompano, Fla. being transported by DANIEL VAZQUEZ,
associate of PRIO, along with others, President BATISTA
of Cuba reportedly accused PRIO of responsibility for
9/5/57 uprising at Cienfuegos, but investigation fails to
establish such responsibility. Unsubstantiated reports
received concerning plan to bomb Camp Colombia, Cuba, by
means five B-25 bombers from Miami on 10/10/57. Miscella-
neous information received concerning boats, including a
report PRIO paid $12,000. for "Blue Chip" which was uséd
relative Cuban revolutionary activities in Mexico, Dur-
ing period 5/6/57, PRIO made statements to the press, ap-
peared on television and spoke in meetings denouncing
BATISTA. Also wrote "an open letter" to BATISTA, suggest-
ing BATISTA step down, suggested formation temporary junta
and renouncing political aspiration on his own part.
Leaders of anti-BATISTA Cuban political parties reportedly
holding meetings in Miami, along with PRIO, for purpose
achieving unity. Several acts of violence occurred re-
cently in Miami involving Cuban exiles. Reports indicate
PRIO is resentful of FIDEL CASTRO, leader of July 26 Move-
ment, and hopes to eliminate him. Unverified reports re-
celved concerning sabotage sugar industry in Cuba for pur-
pose arousing U. S. against BATISTA. PRIO has balance
only $40, at North Shore Bank, Miami Beach.

A. General Information

Previous investigation in this case disclosed that
approximately 150 Cubans received military training ata camp
which operated near Ciudad Trujillo, Dominican Republic,
from the fall of 1956 to April, 1957.

On May 7, 1957, Miami Informant T-1 advised that
Generalissimo RAFAEL TRUJILLO, of the Dominican Republic,

had entrapped CARLOS PRIO SOCARRAS, exiled former President.
of Cuba, into using the above described camp in the Dominican
Republic, T-1 said that TRUJILLO had even attempted to get
PRIO to make a personal visit to the Dominican Republic, but,
that PRIO had not fallen for that invitation., T-1 said that
he was of the opiniom that the Cubans who received training
at this camp would have been killed under order of Generalissimo
TRUJILLO had it not been for-public reaction and the attitude
taken by the United States Government with regard to the dis-
appearance in March, 1956 of Professor JESUS DE GALINDEZ,
Columbia University Professor, from New York City; and the
alleged implication of GERALD LESTER MURPHY, an American
pilot who was Reportedly willed in the Dominican Republic in
December, 1956.

T-1 said that he ‘personally advised PRIO. not to
accept any assistance whatsoever from Generalissimo TRUJILLO,
but. Ghat ¥ PRIO disregarded this warning, apparently feeling
that he had to accept aid from “TRUJILLO because he had no
other recourse.

Fo.202 (6-8-57) FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION
INTERVIEW REPORT =34NoSaS

On April 16, 1957 Miami Informant advised that he
returned to Miami in the early part of April, 1957, after
receiving military training in the Cuban camp in the Dominican
Republic, He expressed fear for his life should his identity
become known, but stated that he would be willing to consider
testifying, if necessary, at a later date.

He examined manifests in possession of Immigration
and Naturalization Service, Miami, reflecting travel from the
Dominican Republic to Miami. via CDA Airlines for April 2, 1957
when 24 Cubans and one American returned, for April 4, 1957
when 34 Cubans returned, for April 9, 1957 when 13 Cubans re-
turned, and for April 12, 1957 when one Cuban and 3 Mexicans
returned. He advised that the men listed on these manifests
(who have been named in a previous report in this investiga-
tion) had been receiving training in the same camp in the
Dominican Republic. He estimated that there were a total of
140 to 150 men at this camp during its peak enrollment.

Miami Informant furnished the following information:

\
He belonged to an action group of the Federation
of Students Union (FEU) in Havana, Cuba, and had been engag-
ing in activities aimed against the BATISTA\ Government in
Cuba, Fearing that his identity would be disclosed to the
Cuban Police by an FEU member who had been arrested, Informant
sought the advice of JOSE ANTONIO ECHEVARRIA, President of
the FEU, who said that Generalissimo RAFAEL! TRUJILLO was
making facilities available to all Cubans who wanted to come
to the Dominican Republic. He already knew,| from newspaper
sources, that MENELOA MORA, Cuban Senator and follower of
CARLOS PRIO, had been buying guns from the Dominican Republic
and had established relations with that country. He claimed
that he did not know who was responsible for the Cuban set-up
in the Dominican Republic. \
He arrived in Miami on or about November 8,°1956,

where, upon instructions of ECHEVARRIA, he contacted HUMBERTO
CONRADO RODRIGUEZ SABORIT, whose’ photograph he identified.
RODRIGUEZ purchased a Compania Dominicana De Aviacion Airlines
ticket for him, with $60.00 being provided by Informant, and
the balance of $40.00 by RODRIGUEZ. He left on the same day
via CDA for Ciudad Trujillo. On the-same plane were a number
of other Cubans with the same destination.

He was told by RODRIGUEZ that he would be in

Ciudad Trujillo for about twenty days for training so that

he could go into Cuba and give similar training to other
groups of Cubans, preparatory to overthrowing the govern-
ment of Cuba. “a

When the plane landed at Ciudad.frujillo, the
Cubans were met at the airport by a Cuban, POLICARPO SOLER,
who was known in Ciudad Trujillo as General JOAQUIN RODRIGUEZ,
and right-hand man to TRUJILLO, POLICARPO asked the Cuban
arrivals, "Are you members of SIM?" (SIM is the Cuban
Military Intelligence Service.) ‘The group answered in the
negative.

The group was taken in several cars by POLICARPO

and others to a camp located five kilometers from Ciudad

Trujillo on Canatera Duarte. Road. This camp had previously
been the barracks of the Fourth Artillery Battalion of the

Dominican Army, \

Upon arrival there, a Cuban, Colonel GUZMAN, took
up their passports and papers. GUZMAN told them, "PRUJILLO,
POLICARPO and I control this camp.” a

°He, along with the others, was told to sign a
pink sheet of paper without being given time to read it.

‘He, said that these sheets contained the names and addresses

He” said that on their first day in Ciudad Trujillo,
POLICARPO told them that CARLOS PRIO was a thief, that when
he was in Cuba, PRIO had tried to catch him, and that he had
no love for PRIO. POLICARPO bragged that he was’ going to be-
come Chief of the Cuban Army. *#e) said that POLICARPO was
kmown to him and the other Cubans as a Cuban gangster. ‘They
were surprised to find him in charge of this camp and im-
mediately under TRUJILLO. POLICARPO wore the uniform of the
Dominican Army.

The Cubans were issued green Dominican Army fatigue
uniforms, without insignia, and shoes.; A seven-day-a-week
training schedule was announced, They were given no freedom
to leave the camp, although a few favorites were given this
privilege. /

There were about sixty men’ ‘in this camp when Informant
arrived. ‘The men were given training in the use of .45
calibre automatic colt; .45 calibre\Thompson submachine gun;

-30 calibre Browning automatic machine gun, both water and
air-cooled types; Mausers; Springfield-rifles; 81 mm mortars;
hand grenades; and the knife. They were taught commando
tactics in country and city warfare. This training took

located in Ciudad Trujillo, adjacent to the airport.

JOSE FALLAT, who was in charge of food and who
lived in town. fo

The status of GONZALEZ CARTAS, alias "EL
EXTRANO," was uncertain, i

Also at the camp was a Cuban Negro of Jamaican
origin, McDOWELL O'REILLY SHERWOOD, who acted as an errand
boy for POLICARPO. t °

TRUJILLO never visited the camp, although one
day, the trainees were told to prepare for a visit by him.

On November 30, 1956, when FIDEL CASTRO landed
on the coast of Cuba, the Dominican radio reported that
BATISTA was running away. A group of the Cubans went to
POLICARPO and said they wanted to go to /Cuba immediately.
POLICARPO replied that they must wait for permission from
TRUJILLO. The Cuban trainees then began to feel that they
were trapped. ‘He’ and others requested (permission to leave
the Dominican Republic, but POLICARPO ordered them to re-
main, stating that they would talk too much. About this
same time, POLICARPO proposed to some ofthe Cubans that
they join the Dominican Army. \ G

\

The Cubans then began plotting to escape, but

all plans failed because of "squealers."_

During the latter part of December, 1956, the
Cubans learned that a representative of Cuban Government
had come to Ciudad Trujillo to talk to TRUJILLO and
POLICARPO. Shortly after this, POLICARPO showed signs of
sudden wealth, He bought several new cars, flashed big
rolls of bills and acquired several girlfriends. Tnformant
assumed that POLICARPO had received this money from BATISTA.
At the same time, many of the Cubans were allowed to visit
Ciudad Trujillo; however, when the Cuban Agriculture Mission
visited the Dominican World's Fair, on January 6 or 7, 1957,

the Cubans wereitransported on the preceding day, by
Dominican boats, to a Dominican Naval Base. on Hermosa

Bay and kept there until after this Mission departed.

He’ was unable to reconcile this incident with his assump-
tion that POLICARPO had sold-out to BATISTA.

Several Cubans, and Infermamt, feeling like
prisoners, began to plot against the life of POLICARPO.
They dropped their plans, however, when they reasoned
that TRUJILLO would kill all the Cubans in reprisal.

Four men, ORESTE GUILLERMO RUIZ PEREZ, JOSE
MURILLO, ANIBAL ACOSTA and MARIANOA HERRERA then attempted
to steal a P-T boat, but their plans were thwarted by
McDOWELL O'REILLY SHERWOOD, who reported to POLICARPO.
POLICARPO called MURILLO in and questioned him. He had
no proof against him and dismissed him after threatening
him with death if he again attempted to escape,

On February 10, 1957, 96 of the Cubans signed
a letter addressed to TRUJILLO, requesting authority to
leave the Dominican Republic. One of the group, without
the letter, went to POLICARPO as a delegate. POLICARPO
said that he would arrange a meeting between TRUJILLO
and a committee of this group. The next day, some cars
were sent to the camp. Seureg and fourteen other men were
taken to the main police station in Ciudad Trujillo where
they were all placed under arrest, relieved of their
personal belongings, and all placed in the same cell where
they slept on the floor as there were no cots, They were
given no food for four or five days. ‘Two men, MARIO ROMO
OROPEZA and ARTURO MARTINEZ DEL CAMPO, both Mexicans, were
released within a few hours.

The Cubans could hear the cries of other prisoners
being whipped. On the sixth day, they were told by the
Dominican police to prepare to die. On the fifteenth day,
all the prisoners, with the exception of three, were sent
back to the camp, along with CARLOS MORALES, a Cuban who
had been three months and five days in solitary confine-
ment in a dungegn because he had accused POLICARPO of being
a gangster. MORALES had not seen daylight during this

remaining prisoners, JOSE MURILLO, JOSE MOLEON CARRERA

GUILLERMO RUIZ PEREZ, MANUEL MEJIAS, LUIS ORLANDO TORRES
Y_ RAMOS, RAUL VENTA Y DEL MAZO, MANUEL BARANDA, JESUS
MENDES and HUMBERTO VINAT AQUERO.

When they. returned to camp, they learned that
GUZMAN had told the other trainees that the twelve in jail
would be killed if the others did not keep order.

| He? said that this treatment amounted to "brain-
washing" through the use of fear.

During the month of March, they received addi-
tional training. :

Four days before Trey left the Dominican Republic,,
POLICARPO came to the camp and announced that by the grace
of TRUJILLO, all the men would be set free and sent back
to their homes and families and that if any wanted to return
with their families, they would be received with open arms.

On April 2, 1957, while at the airport preparing
to depart for Miami via CDA, “Hé was called before POLICARPO,
who was in his house adjacent to the airport. In the room
also was a Dominican, FELIX BERNARDINO (former Dominican
Consul General in New York City.) BERNARDINO glared at Him,
but said nothing. POLICARPO told Him, "When you get away
from here, you had better keep your mouth shut because
TRUJILLO has a long arm and he can catch you anywhere you
go, even if to China. You remember 'PIPI' HERNANDEZ?"

.He answered, "Yes," knowing that POLICARPO had
reference to the 1955 assassination of the Dominican exile,
"PIPI" HERNANDEZ, in Havana, by a Cuban, "EL MUERTO," who
reportedly was acting upon instructions of POLICARPO. ‘He
recalled that "EL MUERTO," real name (FNU) SOLER, had ad=
mitted, according to newspapers, having also been propo- +
sitioned by POLICARPO to kill JESUS DE GALINDEZ, anti-saimmam- 770 7/LLO
professor at Columbia University, New York City, (who dis-
appeared on March 12, 1956).

He possessed no lmowledge of other Cubans having
been similarly questioned by POLICARPO.

Another Cuban, ERASMO GUTIERREZ RAMOS, was placed
in jail soon after his arrival at the camp and none of the
Cubans know if he is dead or alive. He was suspected by
POLICARPO of being a spy.

CANDIDO DE LA TORRE, (friend and follower of
CARLOS PRIO), who had words with and was struck by POLICARPO,
was kept in detention at the camp for a period of time;
DE LA TORRE, a good friend of JUAN EVARISTO LOVACO DIAZ,
is reported to be in Mexico.

MIGUEL SANCHEZ, American citizen who fought in
Korea, told the Cubans that he had a job at the American
Embassy in Ciudad Trujillo. They suspected him of being a
Lieutenant in the Secret Service of the Dominican Govern-

ment.

RICARDO CABRERA was one of POLICARPO's best
friends.

GUZMAN left Ciudad Trujillo two er three days
before April 2, 1957, stating that he was going to manage
a hotel in New York City. GUZMAN was a geod friend of
GARLOS MARISTANY, cf Miami, Florida, who was also among
the Cubans in Ciudad Trujillo. .

In February, 1957, POLICARPO offered one of the
Cubans, (FNU) HERNANDEZ, the sum of $30,000.00 to go to
Havana, Cuba, and kill a Dominican newspaperman, whose
mame Source could not recall, HERNANDEZ was instructed
by POLICARPO to go to the Dominican Embassy in Havana and
collect the $30,000.00 after accomplishing this mission.
HERNANDEZ accepted this offer in order to leave the
Dominican Republic. He departed without the intention of
killing this man and never made an attempt, so far as
Informant knew. He said that this Dominican newspaper-
man is now supposed to be in New York City. This news-
paperman fled to Havana shortly after incurring the dis-
favor of TRUPILLO because of some article or articles
he had written or for which he had been held responsible.

INTERVIEW REPORT

SECRET

On May 8 and 9, 1957, Miami Informant furnished
the following information concerning his priod of
service at the Cuban training camps in the Dominican
Republic:

Informant disclosed that he had left Cuba in
1955 as a political exile because he was opposed to the
BATISTA regime. He went to New York City where he became
a member of the Accion Civica Cubana, which he described
as an anti-~BATISTA organization. He claimed that upon
the basis of rumors that Cubans were going to Santo
Domingo (Ciudad Trujillo), Dominican Republic, for training
against BATISTA, that he departed New York City in November,
1956 with 3 companions, all members of Accion Civica
Cubana, without having been recruited by anybody, arrived in
Miami, and departed the next day for the Dominican Republic,
each man purchasing his own ticket. He admitted knowing
CARLOS PRIO, but denied implication with him in this
venture.

Upon arrival at the airport in Ciudad Trujillo,
informant and his companions were met by a Doctor BENEJE
after a Dominican Customs Officer had stated upon recognizing
them_as Cubans "Those are the men of General JOAQUIN .
RODRIGUEZ who are going to invade Cuba."

Informant said he had heard of Dr. BENEJE ag a
Cuban doctor of great reputation, but he lived to learn
that BENEJE was in the secret service of TRUJILLO.

BENEJE took informant and his companions by car
to a house near the airport which was the home of General
JOAQUIN RODRIGUEZ, who was absent. They were met by a
Colonel GUZMAN, a Cuban, who identified General RODRIGUEZ
to them as POLICARPO SOLER, who was known to informant as a
Cuban gangster and killer. Informant said that he and his
companions expressed such surprise that GUZMANhad BENEJE
drive them to the camp before POLICARPO returned to greet
them.

This camp, which was also located near the airport,

who were wearing olive drab fatigue outfits.

CANDIDO de la TORRE explained to the Cuban trainees that
they were going to be trained so that when they went to Cuba,
they would be prepared to fight BATISTA, Informant was of
the opinion they would go to Cuba within one or two weeks.

Informant said that on his first day in camp “he
learned that POLICARPO SOLER was the commander and top
leader of the camp under TRUJILLO, He thereupon went to
CANDIDO de la TORRE and demanded to know how it was that a
common murderer like POLICARPO should be appointed ‘chief.

Informant said that some of the Qubans in this
camp were sympathetic to PRIO and some to FIDEL CASTRO RUZ,
leader of the July 26 Movement in Cuba; and that he, himself,
felt that after the revolution Succeeded, the Cuban people
would elect a man as President. He Said that practically all
of the Cubans in camp despised POLICARPO and TRUJILLO.
Consequently, on November 27, 1956, commemoration day
in Cuba in honor of students killed during the Spanish
American War, informant made a speech in the presence of all
the trainees and their leaders denouncing TRUJILLO and
POLICARPO, The next day, JOSE MANUEL SANGHEZ, alias
"EL COREANO," who was one of the drill masters, ordered the
trainees to sign a petition of appreciation and thanks to
TRUJILLO. Informant was the only man who refused to sign.

stating that Cuba was being invaded ana that he was waiting
for PRIO to come to the Dominican Republic, but that PRIO
would not come and that he, POLICARPO, was. going to lead the
men. Informant said that at this point, he got up and

said "You are not the kind of a man to lead us. You are

a epiminal and shold be in prison."

On the morning of December 1, 1956, Agformant
was sent by CANDIDO.de 1a TORRE in custody of Dr, BENEJE

to POLICARPO's house and POLICARPO placed a telephone call
to a Captain soTo, Thereafter, BENEJE drove informant to

a large building in Ciudad Trujillo which was the head-
quarters for the Police Department. Dominican police took
informant in custody and also feigned arrest of BENEJE, They
entered this building by an entrance marked "Jefatura de
Policia," i

Informant was given a thorough search and his belt.
and coat and suitcase were removed. He was neither Photographed
ner fingerprinted. He was conducted down a corridor where
a@ guard took his name and recorded the time 11:15 AM and the
date, December 1, 1956. He was then conducted to an under—
ground dungeon, without windows and lighted only by a very
small bulb. ‘There was a small barred hole in the door, His
fare consisted of tomato juice and cold chocolate water. He

. Was never beaten nor tortured, but was -almest ‘completely
ignored. He kept a record of the days by making marks on the
wall. f

Informant said that on February 4 he was conducted
to the office of the police chief where POLICARPO and
SANCHEZ were waiting. The next. day BENEJE took him
from the prison to the home of POLICARPO where POLICARPO,
GONZALES CARTAS and SANCHEZ met him. POLICARPO told him
to keep quiet or he would find himself back in jail,
Informant was then returned to the camp where’ his fellow
trainees had given him up for dead. He was Allowed to rest
and rebuild his strength; and was excused from any duty.

On March 30, 1957, POLICARPO told the trainees
they had been there a long time; their families were
worried, and that they were being returned to their point of
embarkation. Informant said that one day he ‘and others read
an article in the Dominican newspaper "El Caribe" that relations
between BATISTA and TRUJILLO were now friendly ‘and they
believed this to be the reason they were being sent home.
He said that even at the ent: “@&the camp. opinion differed among

either for PRIO or FIDEL CASTRO, but he

admitted that he had.called upon PRIO to say "hello"

JUAN JOSE VALDES GUZMAN, a Cuban Citizen who had been
arrested on June 17, 1957. by Agents of the Department of
Investigation of the Cuban National Police. VALDES furnished
the following information to 7-5. /

MM 2-165

VALDES said that in October, 1956, he had been
recruited to go from Miami, Florida, where he.was a legal
resident, to the Dominican Republic to become a member
of a "Cuban Army of Liberation" which was being formed
in the Dominican Rapublic for the purpose of traveling to
Cuba to overthrow President FULGENCIO BATISTA. VALDES said
that arrangements for his travel and Payment for his passage
were made by one HUMBERTO RODRIGUEZ SABORIT, a Cuban residing
in Miami, and he was givenito understand that the group would
only be in the Dominican Republic for a period of! approximately
ten days while arrangements for departure to Cuba were made.

He said he arrived at Ciudad Trujillo, Dominican
Republic, on October 28, 1956 and at that time there were no
more than ten or twelve Cubans in the group which had arrived
ahead of him, He said he was much surprised and disgusted
when he arrived to learn that the group was under the
domination and direction of POLICARPO SOLER, whom he described
as_a Cuban-gunman and gangster. In the Dominican Republic
VALDES said that SOLER utilized the name of General JOAQUIN
RODRIGUEZ and as insignia of his rank had five stars on the
collar of his uniform.

VALDES said he was given the rank of colonel and
placed in immediate charge of the group of Cubans in the
Dominican Republic. He said that ‘the maximum number reached
by this group was approximately 147 and that although the
majority of these were Cubans, a few were of other nationalities.

VALDES said they were allowed very few liberties,
were not ‘permitted to be armed except when actually in
training, and that in general an atmosphere of fear pervaded
the group throughout the time they were in the Dominican
Republic due to the fact that they did not know whether they
would ever be permitted to leave.

- 23 -



MM 2-165

VALDES recalled that about February, 1957,
POLICARPO SOLER and FELIX BERNARDINO, a Dominican who at one
‘time.had served as Dominican Consul General in Havana, made a
trip to one of the Central American countries, probably
Nicaragua, and returned with a quantity of arms. VALDES
said he knew they brought back arms because these arms were
stored in a house near the Cuban training camp and the
Cubans were required to clean them. He said that among the
arms.were a number of old type German Mauser rifles and about
30 new Thompson submachine guns,

VALDES said that the majority of the Cubans in the
group in the Dominican. Republic had become so disillusioned
after the long stay there that they discussed the possibilities
of seizing the arms and POLICARPO SOLER and an airplane and
taking off for Miami. He pointed out that the Cubans were in
a camp immediately adjacent to the airfield and they felt
this would not have been too difficult to accomplish; however,
the plans were never carried “Gut?

VALDES advised that he returned to Miami about
April 3, 1957, and said the majority of the Cubans in the
Dominican Republic were permitted to leave there about the
same time. He estimated that there probably were no more
than ten or fifteen Cubans still remaining in the Dominican
Republic from the group who originally went there to form
the "army of liberation."

VALDES stated that after spending about a week in
Miami he proceeded to Key West, Florida, and from there
traveled to Havana via Aerovias Q Airline under the name of
GEORGE MILTON, United States citizen. He said he had been in
hiding since that time until arrested on June 17, 1957.

Files of the Immigration and Naturalization
Service, Miami, reflect that a considerable number of Cubans
who served in the Cuban camp in the Dominican Republic were
interviewed following their return to Miami from the
Dominican Republic.

II, EXPEDITION OF THE "CORINTHEA"

A. Reports on Landing of the "Corinthea"

On May 22, 1957, Miami Informant T-2, reported that
he received information from several different sources,
which he believed to be reliable, that in about June, 1957,
PRIO would "jump into Cuba" sending some fifty to sixty men
on the expedition from Florida, and that other men would be
sent from Mexico to Cuba. (

On May 24, 1957, Miami Informant 7-6, advised that
information had been received that on that date a group of
some 27 men had made a landing in the Cabonico Bay region,
which is located in Oriente Province in the Northeastern part.
of Cuba. -6 said that it had been reported that this group
was headed by CALIXTO SANCHEZ WHITE, former leader of the
Airline Workers Union in Havana, who was forced-to go into
exile in the latter part of March, 1957. According to T-6,
this group had departed from Miami on May 19, 1957 aboard the
“Corinthea", -6 said that the chief sources of information
relating to this landing were two members of the invading
party named LAZARO GUERRA CALDERON and MARIO RODRIGUEZ
ARENAS, who had been captured.

On May 27, 1957, T-6 advised that he had received
information from one of his agents, who had interviewed the
two prisoners, that the "Corinthea" had departed Miami at
7:30 PM, May 19, 1957; that the boat had been tied up in the
Miami River and had been boarded there by the group which
came’ to Cuba. The two prisoners, according to T-6, said that
just prior to the departure of the "Corinthea" a large part
of the group had been at the apartment of MARISOL ALBA in
Miami. T-6 pointed out that MARISOL ALBA was formerly \
married to RICARDO ARTIGAS, Directo: of the National Lottery
during the:regime of PRIO, and at the present time she is \
married to DANIEL VAZQUEZ, an airline pilot who was a close
associate of PRIO. T-6 said that the two prisoners said that

MM 2-165

some ef the group had been at the Paltis Hotel in Miami
just before departure, and that they had counted at least
30 persons aboard the "Corinthea." 1-6 said that the
boat also carried a large quantity of arms and ammunition,
to the extent that there appeared to be more than could
be carried off by the persons on the boat.

7-6 stated that M§RIO RODRIGUEZ ARENAS had re-
turned from Ciudad Trugillo'to Miami via Puerto Rico on
May 7, 1957, and had resided at the Palms Hotel, before
deaving for Cuba.

7-6 said that the two prisoners claimed that
a few days before the departure of the "Corinthea,"
PRIO had sent word that he could not give more peney
$o the’Cuban revolutionaries residing in Miami unless
they embarked for Cuba to assist FIDEL CASTRO RUZ, leader
of the 26th of July Movement, in his fight against the
Cuban Government, The two prisoners also disclosed that
just prior to departure, each was given $200.00, which
presumably came from PRIO. T-6 said he had received in-
formation from an informant that PRIO had told a friend
that because of the "Corinthea” incident, he would have
to leave the United States very soon and wowld probably
depart in a small plane with a group of his friends,

The "Miami Herald" carried an article in its
May 25, 1957 issue entitled "Landing Fizzles in Cuba -
27 Rebels Land, But 2 Caught,” bearing a Havana, Cuba
Associated Press date line. This article reflected that
according to Cuban Army Headquarters, a rebel force of
27 men landed at Cabonico Bay, that two were captured
and that the landing party was headed by CALIXTO SANCHEZ.
The Cuban Army announced that ex-President PRIO, in exile
in Miami, had sent the invasion force to Cuba and that
both prisoners captured were wearing orange arm bands
with the letters "OMA", standing for Organizacion Autentico,
(PRIO's Party). This article disclosed that PRIO, when
contacted in Miami by newspaper representatives, denied
that he had anything to do with the landings.

This article also disclosed that CALIXTO

SANCHEZ had recently come to Miami and in an interview
with the "Miami Herald" had said that he and two other
pilots had fled from Havana to save their lives; that
SANCHEZ and the other two pilots, Capt. ROBERTO
VERDAGUER BOAN and ROBERTO GUILLERMO VERDAGUER BOAN,
brothers, said that they had been accused by BATISTA's
Government of revolutionary activities. The newspaper
article stated that all three denied-this, but. admitted
they were friends of Dr. CARLOS PRIO SOCARRAS,

On May 31, 1957, T-2 advised that according to
Cuban official sources, that the "Corinthea" went aground
before it reached its destination in Cuba and that

fishermen were requisitioned by: CALIXTO SANCHEZ to transport

the men and their equipment ashore. T-2 said that
according to these fishermen, twelve machine guns, two
mortars, four M-ls and one hundred Winchester and Springfie
Rifles were unloaded from the "Corinthea" by them.

On June 17, 1957, T-2 made available a list
received from official Cuban sources of the expeditionaries
of the yacht "Corinthea," This list reflected 16 were
dead, 5 being without papers; that 2 were arrested and 9;

resides at 922 Pizarro Street, Coral Gables, Florida,
advised that he is a partner in Breece's Fish & Lobster
Market, located at 400 Northwest North River Drive,
Miami, and in connection with his business, engages
in commercial fishing. He said that he bought the
"Corinthea"in December, 1956 for crawfishing on the
Cay Sal Banks off the coast of Cuba. Mrs@OLDSTEIN
Said that he has an agreement with CHARLES CARVER, a
commercial fisherman who operates fishing boats and sells
his fish to GOLDSTEIN, who markets them. He said that
CARVER owes him approximately $32,000. and as security
for this debt, the titles to the fishing boats, including

the "Gorinthea" which are used by CARVER, are held in the
name of GOLDSTEIN,

Mr. GOLDSTEIN said that CHARLES CARVER had a
friend, GOLDWIN N, ACKERMAN, who resides‘ in the vicinity
of Mélbarne, Florida, who is financially well off and
who had been interested in buying into GOLDSTEIN's business.

\
On April 4, 1957, ACKERMAN gave MLDSTEIN a
mortgage on 11 acres of land in lieu of $6,000., with the
understanding that ACKERMAN was to pay GOLDSTEIN $6,000.
by August 1, 1957, and GOLDSTEIN transferred title of the
"Corinthea" to ACKERMAN, who planned to resell this boat
for profit at the earliest opportunity. In the meantime,
ACKERMAN left the boat in GOLDSTEIN's custody and the
boat was docked in the Miami River above the 17th Avenue
Bridge near a houseboat occupied by CHARLES CARVER.

During the first part of May, CARVER advised
GOLDSTEIN that some Cubans had approached him, offering
to buy the "Corinthea" for $12,000. Several days later,
CARVER brought these Cubans to Mr. GOLDSTEIN's office at
Breece's Fish & Lobster Market, at which time GOLDSTEIN’
received a sum of $9,000. from one of these Cubans.
Mr. GOLDSTEIN said that he advised that Cuban that he could
not sell him the boat, but could aecept the money in

of the boat and that, consequently, each received
$1,400. in cash.

\ INTERVIEW REPORT

On May 27; 1957, Mr. CHARLES CARVER, who resides
in a houseboat docked in the Miami River on the South side
and just above the 17th’ Avenue Bridge, advised that he is
a commercial fisherman who operates several boats, the title
of which are in the name of HAROLD GOLDSTEIN, a partner in
Breece's Fish and Lobster Market, 400 N. W. North River
Drive. CARVER said that from about December, 1956 to March,
1957, he used the "Corinthea" for crawfishing in the Caysal
area. As the crawfish season closed on about March 1, 1957,
with a loss of money to CARVER, he took the "Corinthea" up
the Miami River to about 900 N. W. 13th Court, this being
the approximate location of CARVER's houseboat. CARVER said
that he had become indebted to HAROLD GOLDSTEIN and wanted
to arrange the sale of the "Corinthea" so that with¥his +
share of the proceeds he could pay off part of his’ indebted-
ness to GOLDSTEIN with whom he has been doing business for
many years, CARVER said that he has known GOLDWIN ACKERMAN,
of Malabar, near Melbourne, Florida, for ten or eleven years,
and went to ACKERMAN and persuaded him to put up eleven acres
of land to HAROLD GOLDSTEIN as security to enable GOLDSTEIN
to borrow money on the eleven acres, a8 GOLDSTEIN was financially
strapped. ACKERMAN agreed to this proposition with the thought
in mind of selling the "Corinthea," to which he was given a
bill of sale, for a profit. It was agreed that CARVER would
act as ACKERMAN's agent in finding a buyer for this boat.

On the morning of about May 13, 1957, five men who
appeared to be Cubans, arrived in a 1956 Ford, 4-door green
automobile. Only one appeared to know English. He announced
that he would like to buy the "Corinthea" and indicated that
he was willing to pay $10,000.00 for it. He did not indicate
the purpose for what he desired the boat. Several days later,
on May 16, 1957, the Cuban. spokesman and several of his com-
panions returned to the "Corinthea," which was docked opposite
CARVER's houseboat, picked up CARVER, and went with him to
Breece's Fish and Lobster Market in order to close the deal
for the purchase of the boat. Prior to the closing of the
deal, CARVER took several of these Cubans, including the
spokesman, on a trial run down the Miami River.

Upon arrival at Breece's Fish and Lobster Market,
one of the Cubans, who CARVER felt may have been the spokes-
man, produced from his pocket $9,000.00 in’ $100.00, $50.00
and $20.00 bills. CARVER said that he signed a receipt,
along with GOLDSTEIN, which was made payable to HORTENCIA
MACHADA, upon request of one of the Cubans, who described
her as being’ a woman in New York City. As the Cubans went
out the door, one, the spokesman, returned and CARVER gave
him $200.00 of the purchase money, as a commission for ar-
ranging the purchase. CARVER said that he personally drove
in a car to Malabar, Florida on the night of the same day
and delivered to ACKERMAN a check in the amount of $1,400.00.
He said that ACKERMAN had no previous. knowledge of this trans-
action.

CARVER said that the Cubans said that they planned
to put two Diesel motors on the "Corinthea;" that they worked
on the boat on May 18, 1957, at about 13th Avenue and the
Miami River. He said the Cubans took this boat to Jones!
Boatyard. on about the following Sunday, May 19, 1957.

CARVER explained to the Cuban purchasers prior to
delivery of the money by them that another man held the title
to the boat and that they would be unable to furnish a bill
of sale to these Cubans until after the owner had been noti-
fied. CARVER described the "Corinthea" as being in very poor
condition. It had a maximum cruising speed of 15 to 16 knots
per hour.

On June 19, 1957, CARVER was shown photographs of
a number of Cubans. He positively identified a photograph
of JUAN HERRERO CAMEJO as being the man who piloted the
“Corinthea" from the dock near CARVER's houseboat to Jones!
Boatyard. He said that HERRERO was also present in the
office at Breece's Fish and Lobster Market when the deal
was closed and was on the trial run.

He positively identified a photograph of DIOMEDES
PEREZ YANES as having been with HERRERO when the boat was
taken up the Miami River to Jones! Boatyard. He said that

this man slept on the "Corinthea" from the day the boat was
purchased and that people brought food to him on the boat.

the trial run,

CARVER positively identified a Photograph of HECTOR
CORNILLOT MONTANO as having been on the trial run and as hav-
ing been in the office when the deal was closed.

CARVER said that the photograph of JORGE PRIETO
looked like one of the men who was in the office when the
deal was closed.

He said that the photograph of CLETO COLLADO DEL
CUETO looked familiar but he was not certain this man had
been present during any of the negotiations,

He said the photograph of JOAQUIN FERRER DE BLANCK
also looked familiar but he was not positive that he was
among the Cubans with whom he had dealt.

CARVER was positive that the Photograph of CALIXTO
SANCHEZ WHITE was identical to the individual who spoke
English and who had served as a spokesman for the purchase
of the "Corinthea" and who had been on the trial run of this
vessel down the Miami River.

CARVER said that CALIXTO SANCHEZ indicated they
intended to use this boat for commercial fishing purposes,
and at no time did he indicate they wanted it for any
revolutionary purpose, nor did he mention the name of
CARLOS PRIO,

a INTERVIEW REPORT SECRES

On May 28, 1957, AMBROSIO DIAZ RODRIGUEZ, age 53,
advised in the Spanish language that he has been buying and
selling boats for many years and is presently recondition-
ing the "Pandore" which he had recently purchased and on
which he is now residing. DIAZ said that he resides in Cuba
at Street #15 and 30th Street, Vedado, Havana. His daughter,
ESTRELLA DIAZ, resides at 2939 North River Drive, with her
husband, E. D. POLHAMUS, where DIAZ can also be reached.

DIAZ said that several months ago a Cuban whom he
knew only as "CARLOS" had come to him stating that he wanted
to purchase a boat for the purpose of transporting cargo and
passengers between Puerto Rico, Port of Spain and other
Caribbean points. On about April 20, 1957, "CARLOS" came to
DIAZ and asked him to look over the “Corinthea" which was
docked in the Miami River. On about May 1, 1957, "CARLOS"
again contacted DIAZ and they again went to and éxamined
the "Corinthea" without contacting the owner or caretaker.

On about May 15, 1957, "CARLOS" again came to
DIAZ and said that he had’ some money and was interested in
purchasing the "Corinthéa." "CARLOS" drove DIAZ in a blue
Chevrolet car to the "Corinthea" where they contacted an
American with whom "CARLOS" spoke in English. DIAZ said
that as he does not understand any English he did not know
the substance of this conversation. "CARLOS" told DIAZ
that the American wanted $12,000.00 for the boat and DIAZ
advised "CARLOS" that the boat was not worth this’ much
money. . DIAZ explained many Cubans come to him for advice
on boats knowing that he is in the business of buying and
reconditioning boats and is considered somewhat of an ex-
pert by his fellow countrymen.

On the next day, "CARLOS" came to the "Pandore"
with another man, age about 50, 6 feet tall, large mustache,
about bald, Cuban, who spoke no English. "CARLOS" asked DIAZ
to accompany them as he was going to purchase the boat, They
drove in "CARLOS" Chevrolet to the "Corinthea” where they
picked up the American with whom "CARLOS" had previously
talked and then drove to a fish market where they met
another American. Before arriving at the fish market "CARLOS"
gave DIAZ a paper bag containing money. After entering the
fish market office "CARLOS" took the money which he had
given DIAZ, and stacked it along with money which he had in
his possession, Ys.

| "CARLOS" then paid one of the Atieric’ns a con-
siderable amount of money in $100.00, $50.00 and $10.00
bills. DIAZ noticed that "CARLOS" kept about $100.00 or
$200.00 of this money and returned it to his own pocket.
DIAZ said that since all of the negotiations were in
English with "CARLOS" serving as spokesman he did not

know the details of the transaction. He said that after
they left the office "CARLOS" returned to the office for
three or four minutes before again returning to his car.
They then drove to the "Corinthea" where there were two
Cuban friends of "CARLOS" waiting in an old dark blue
automobile, One of these Cubans had a finger cut off and

| it was bandaged. He had a thin mustache, was 25 or 30
years of age, 5 feet, 4 or 5 inches..tall and was to serve

| as cook on the boat. The other man who drove the automobile
appeared to be about 45 years of age, short, dark, with a
mustache, and looked like an Indian. These two individuals
talked to "CARLOS" and then "CARLOS" asked DIAZ if he knew
where he could take the "Corinthea" to have some work done
on it. DIAZ suggested Jones' Boatyard.

"CARLOS" left these two men at the boat and pro-
ceeded with AMBROSIO and their original companion to Jones"
Boatyard where JONES called for a Cuban employee to serve
as interpreter, and arrangements were made for the
"Corinthea" to be docked at the boatyard. "CARLOS" paid
$20.00 to JONES.

DIAZ said that at no time was any information
furnished which indicated that CARLOS planned to use this
boat for revolutionary or other illegal purposes, He
claimed that he believed it to be strictly a commerical
transaction, He described "CARLOS" as having been a
Cuban pilot, age about 35, height 5 feet, six inches,
weight 200, stocky build, clean shaven, swarthy, well
dressed, brown hair,

. On June 7, 1957, DIAZ identified a photograph
of CALIXTO SANCHEZ WHITE as being identical to the man
whom he had known as "CARLOS."

A portion of this interview was conducted in the
office of Breece's Fish and Lobster Market in the presence
of CHARLES CARVER arid HAROLD GOLDSTEIN. AMBROSIO identi-
fied CARVER as being the American whom he had first met on
the boat and with whom CALIXTO SANCHEZ had conducted pre-
liminary negotiations. Va

DIAZ recalled having goneon the "Corinthea” on
a trial run prior to the sale of the boat, with CARVER,
CALIXTO SANCHEZ WHITE and three other Cubans. He believed
that two of these Cubans remained on the boat after the
boat docked, after which CALIXTO SANCHEZ, AMBROSIO and
one of the other Cubans went with CARVER to Breece's Fish
and Lobster Market where the purchase was consummated,
AMBROSIO claimed that he had not received any compensation
from CALIXTO SANCHEZ WHITE or anybody else for his-part
in the purchase of this boat. He said that CALIXTO SANCHEZ
indicated that the boat was going to be placed in the name
of his wife whose name DIAZ did not know: DIAZ also claimed
that he did not know the source of CALIXTO's money and that
at no time did CALIXTO sonfide to’him that the boat was go-
ing to be used for any’unlawful purpose. DIAZ also claimed
that he had nothing further to do with the boat after-he
went with CALIXTO SANCHEZ and the other Cuban to Jones'
Boatyard to arrange for the boat to be docked there. He
also claimed that he had not seen the boat depart as he
had been in Jackson Memorial Hospital as a result of having
had one finger amputated while working on the "Pandore"
during the day of May 19, 1957. He said that he was in the
hospital for more than one day as a result of this accident.

DIAZ said he had no reason to believe that CARLOS
PRIO was implicated in the purchase of this boat,

On June 5, 1957, Mr. WILLIAM MORRIS, Immigration
and Naturalization Service, Miami, made available for examina-
tion a file on AMBROSIO ATANESIO DIAZ Y RODRIGUEZ, 3601 N. W.
35th Aventie, Miami, in care of the "M/V Pandora? which re-
flected that DIAZ was born June 22, 1904, at Cardenas, Cuba,
and resides at: 30-15 and 17, Vedado, Havana, Cuba. He ar-
rived in the United States on April 4, 1957, for one month,
to prepare the "Pandore" for operation. He applied for and
was granted an extension of temporary stay to July 15, 1957.

On July 3, 1957, T-2 advised that he had received
information from a source, which he believed reliable, that
AMBROSIO DIAZ had had an interview that day with CARLOS PRIO.

The. report of Investigator JOSEPH A. THURMAN,
Immigration and Naturalization Service, Miami, dated Septem-
ber 27, 1957, relative to PRIO, reflected that AMBROSIO
DIAZ was questioned relative to the vessel "Pat Doris." He
admitted that he is associated with ENRIQUE CASADA, and that
he inspected the "Corinthea" for CALIXTO SANCHEZ. He denied
knowing PRIO. He stated that he has $5,000.00 invested in
the "Pat Doris;" that CASADA has .;$3,000,00; and that $30,000.00
is still due Mr, FRAZER of the Eastern Shipping Company, Miami,
on the "Pat Doris.”

The same Immigration and Naturalization Service re-
port reflects that GOLDWIN N, ACKERMAN, a United States
citizen, was interviewed by Immigration and Naturalization
Service. He stated that he made a collateral: loan of $6,000.00
to HAROLD GOLDSTEIN and CHARLES CARVER on the motor vessel
"Corinthea" and that when it was sold for $9,000.00 by
GOLDSTEIN, he received the check from GOLDSTEIN for $1,400.00
as his share of the profit. He said that he had never heard
of PRIO and had no part in the sale of the boat; that he only
furnished the mortgage for the boat and received $1,400.00 of
the profits of the sale and was told by GOLDSTEIN that the
boat had been sold to some Cubans.

Mrs. C. H. JONES, who resides in a house adjacent
to Jones! Boatyard, advised on May 26, 1957 that Jones' Boat-
yard is operated by her sons. She said that on or about
Friday, May 17, 1957, the "Corinthea" docked at Jones! Boat-

served that what appeared to be oil barrels were loaded on
the boat on Sunday, May 19,1957. She observed on the morn-
ing of Monday, May 20, 1957, that the boat had departed,
apparently during the night, unobserved by her.

Mrs, JONES pointed to a Chevrolet automobile bear-
ing 1957 Florida license 1-183385, which she said had been
abandoned opposite the point where the "Corinthea" had been
docked and she believed that this car had been abandoned by

INTERVIEW REPORT

On May 26, 1957, Mr. CLEVELAND H. JONES, JR, advised
that on or about the preceding Wednesday or Thursday, a Cuban,
known to him as AMBROSIO, had come to the Jones! Boatyard with
another Cuban and had made arrangements to dock the "Corinthea"”
for about fifteen days, paying the sum of $20.00, Mr. JONES
said that he used one of his employers as an interpreter but
that no names were furnished as it was strictly a matter of
dockage. He was given to understand by the Cubans that they
were going to convert the gasoline engines on the boat to
Diesel engines, and that they would make a trial run before
departing from the dock.

Mr. JONES said that he last saw the "Corinthea"’
at the Jones Boatyard dock at about 10:00 a.m. or 11:00-a.m.,
Sunday, May 19, 1957, at which time he observed that 55-gallon
drums were being loaded by four Cubans from a truck, apparently
for the purpose of being placed aboard the "Corinthea." He
said the boat had disappeared by the morning of May 20, 1957,
and that he did not kmow any of the circumstances of its de-
parture.

On May 28, 1957, Mr. D, M. WEST, Bridge Tender at
the 27th Avenue Bridge, made available for examination a log
which 1s maintained by the bridge tenders and which reflects
traffic going up and down the river. This log reflected
that at 1:05 p.m. on May 18, 1957, a yacht, the "Corinthea"
went up the Miami River. This log did not reflect that the
"Corinthea" ever came down the river; however, an entry at
9:15 p.m., on May 19, 1957 reflected that a yacht went East
(down the river) and that the name of this yacht was not
visible at that hour. As this was the only boat which could
not be accounted for between May 19, 1957 and May 20, 1957,
it appears that this was undoubtedly the "Corinthea" which
departed at 9:15 p.m.

On June 5, 1957, Mr. J. D. WYSONG, 27th Avenue
Bridge Tender, advised that he was on duty on May 19, 1957;
and recalled that a "no name" boat came down the river on
the evening of May 19, 1957. He said that he saw no men on
the deck of this vessel and that at no time did he see any
large number of men.on any boat coming down the river while
he was on duty.

With regard to the Chevrolet automobile bearing
1957 Florida license 1-183385, it was ascertained on May 275
1957, from the Dade County Motor Vehicle Bureau that this
license is registered to G, CAMACHO, 1234 8. W. 4th Street,
for a 1949 Chevrolet Sedan, bearing Motor No. GAA 244631.

On June 7, 1957, Mr. GREGORIO CAMACHO, 1234 Ss. W.
4th Street, Miami, advised Special Agents LEMAN L, STAFFORD,
JR, and GEORGE E, DAVIS, JR. that he is a naturalized
citizen born in Cuba, unemployed, and suffering with a
serious case of coronary thrombosis. He appeared to be a
man in his early sixties. Mr. CAMACHO said that he is the
owner of the above described Chevrolet automobile, He
claimed that several weeks previously, immediately prior.
to taking a trip to Cuba, he had lent this automobile to
CLETO COLLADO, with whom he has a casual acquaintance, and
who had been delivering Cuban newspapers to CAMACHO's ad-
dress. CAMACHO said that when he returned to Miami the
car had not been returned to him by COLLADO, but that on

May 28, 1957, while driving with a friend to Miami Inter-
national Airport, he chanced upon his car on N. W. South
River Drive opposite Jones' Boatyard and recovered it.

Mr. CAMACHO said that he had subsequently learned
that COLLADO had been among those killed in the landing of
the "Corinthea."

CAMACHO said that he himself had no interest in
Cuban politics and had no previous knowledge of COLLADO's
plans to use his automebile in connection with any such
matter, He said that COLLADO's wife, EVA GUTIERREZ, re-
sides in Miami.

C. Concerning CALIXTO SANCHEZ WHITE, Commander of the Expedition.

The March 31, 1957, edition of "Bohemia," weekly
Cuban news magazine, contained an article entitled "CALIXTO
SANCHEZ Exiled." This article indicated that one of the
most important leaders of the CTC (Confederacion: de
Trabajadores Cubanos, Confederation of Cuban Workers),
CALIXTO SANCHEZ, who was Secretary of the National Air
Federation, and s man who had the full confidence of
EUSEBIO MUJAL, the Secretary of the CTC, had left the country
suddenly and had renounced all his responsibilities on the
Central Board of the CTC. This article indicated that he had
departed from Havana by plane and gone to Miami on March 24,
1957, and that the reason for his sudden departure was that
he had been accused by certain police groups of being in-
volved in the latest conspiratorial movements and concerned
with arms found in Havana. This article further indicated
that he was alleged to have been involved in the transporta-
tion of dynamite to Cuba.

Miami Informant T-7 advised on May 9, 1957 that his
records contain the following information concerning SANCHEZ:
On February 10, 1950, subject was reportedly visited by
JORGE AGOSTINI. AGOSTINI was a former Cuban revolutionary
and follower of CARLOS PRIO SOCARRAS, who was killed while
reportedly resisting arrest in 1955. On November 11, 1955,
SANCHEZ was reported to be in Mexico and to have interviewed
FIDEL CASTRO. On September 27, 1956, a report was received

| NW 64954 Docld:34517433 Page 58


MM 2-165

that arms and ammunition were being sent from the United
States to Cuba in bundles of fabric by the Expreso Aereo
Inter-Américana (Inter-American Air Express), This re-
port indicated that SANCHEZ and ROBERTO GUTIERREZ ARRATE
and one SUAREZ DUMAS were involved in these shipments.

T-7 further stated that on December 27, 1956
it was reported that SANCHEZ was working with RICARDO
MADAN and that they were responsible for shipping a
large quantity of arms into Cuba via air express. It
was alleged that there were 70 howitzers included among
these arms, -7 further informed that on April 3, 1957
the Cuban Urgency Court ordered the detention of SANCHEZ
because of the discovery of a suitcase filled with arms
at Calzada and Second Streets in the Vedado Section of
Havana. No reference was'made of SANCHEZ's connection
with these arms. T-7 further informed that on April 27,
1957 a report was received that SANCHEZ and RICARDO MADAN
had been sentenced to death by certain elements of the
"PRIO group" who accused them of not having distributed
all of the ammunition for the attack on the Presidential
Palace -in Havana on March 13, 1957. This report indicates
that SANCHEZ had accused MADAN of being the only one re-
sponsible for the failure of the attack on the Palace.

The May 30, 1957 issue of the "Diario Las
Americas" carried an article entitled "Political Testa-
ment - Exclusive." As a predication to the article the
newspaper explained that the wife of CALIXTO SANCHEZ had
turned over to the newspaper a message written by her
husband before he left on the expedition of the "Corinthea."

The letter written by CALIXTO SANCHEZ is addresse
"Po the Cuban Workers," and reads in part as follows: .

"As I am about to leave for the war of libera-
tion in the mountains of Cuba at the head of the
Eighth Command of the 0.A. (an Authentic Army of
the Cuban Revolution), I entrust to friendly hands
this message which I address to my comrades, the
Cuban Workers, to the armed forces and to the
people in general. What we have by way of men and

"military equipment and our exact routé are a secret,
but it can be said that in our force there are
citizens from different social sectors (among them,
several well-qualified labor leaders), and our pro-
gram and our doctrine are the same as those of the
Cuban Revolutionary Party, founded by our Apostle
Jose Marti, which even today answers completely the
desires for liberty, for economic prosperity and
social justice which can be felt by the citizens

of any country which wishes to call itself civilized
and democratic.

“We know in advance that the dictatorship
which 1s strangling our fatherland will try to con-
fuse the people by accusing us of being Trujillists
or Communists. We are only members of the same
party which was the instrument of the gesture for
liberation. .No one can forget that Cuba owes its
greatest social and economic progress since the
Independence to the Cuban Revolutionary Party.

"In the face of that wishy-washy attitude of
false opposition comes the 0.A., which is an authentic
army of the Cuban revolution, in order to fight along
with the people and the other real revolutionaries
against those who have made of Cuba a private estate
and who are choking in blood the voices of the popular
protest.

"May destiny permit us to put our feet on the
soil of our fatherland in order to undertake the
fight for liberty. Whatever our fate may be, this
is our message: Cuban workers, let us remember our
tradition of fight! Let us not give truce to the
tyranny: People of Cuba, to arms! Let us fight
united for the freedom of Cuba!

acknowledged that CAMEJO was on the same flight, but they
did not travel together, although he happened to meet CAMEJO
at Miami International Airport after the plane's arrival there.

PEREZ denied that he had gone to Cuba on board the
"Corinthea". He admitted being anti-BATISTA and being a

Mexico. He refused to give details as to where they had
stayed on the trip following arrival in Mexico City and he
refused to give any other details concerning his departure
from Mexico and arrival in Cuba or the nature of his
activities while in Cuba. He admitted having returned to

the son of CANDIDO Ge la TORRE offered him a job as a
bodyguard for PRIO in Miami. After agreeing to accept this
position, GUERRA was told to go to Santo Domingo, Dominican

provided with $180. Upon arrival\in Santo Domingo, he was
told that he would have to get some military training and
he was taken to a camp which was under the command of

his people. He said that staying. at the Colonial Hotel
were other men who were subsequently killed in the
"Corinthea" expedition. He said that on May 19, at about
11:00 AM, LINO ELIAS came to him and his friend (MARIO

them up to take them to talk to Dr. PRIO and that they should
wait for him two blocks from their hotel around 6:00 PM that
day. At 6:00 PM ELIAS picked them up and drove them to
a house where PRIO was waiting. En route, they picked up
three other men. About 27 men were in the house at the same
time. PRIO greeted these men and stated tht he had sent for
them because the government in Cuba was already falling and
that he needed their cooperation in connection with an
expedition; that everything was well and that he would follow
afterwards. PRIO then gave those present a Cuban flag and

ARENAS at Havana, Cuba. RODRIGUEZ stated that he was

enough to give everyone all they wanted to eat. The

camp was discontinued and RODRIGUEZ was given a ticket to

in Miami on about May 7, he was met by LINO ELIAS who took
RODRIGUEZ and GUERRA to the Palms Hotel, gave each of them

second in command. You People are going there now and two
other ships are going and I am going later, ‘because the Army has
turned against BATISTA, I do not know if you have seen an
article from a Mexican newspaperman, that on May 20 BATISTA
would turn over the government to someone, some big figure
in Cuba. He said 'I hope to see you soon there. TI hope
you will triumph and you will form part of the government. '"

RODRIGUEZ said that it was about 7:15 or 7:30 PM
when PRIO spoke to this group, after which they were taken, _
five at a time, to the "Corinthea." They were told to remain
below deck. ‘The boat departed Miami and reached the coast
of Cuba on May 24 at about 6:30 PM. One of the motors broke
down and with the aid of fishermen the men went ashore,

GUERRA and RODRIGUEZ were captured by the cuban
Military, and were Placed in prison at Holguin. They were

Report of Immigration and Naturalization Service
Investigator JOSEPH A. THURMAN, dated August 23, 1957, Miami,
relative to the PRIO case, reflects that on August 22, 1957,
JESUS ESTRADA of Miami, advised Immigration and Naturalization
Service that CARLOS PRIO met with persons on the "Corinthea"
expedition. ESTRADA named JOSE ALEMAN as also being present
and as having contributed $30,000.00 toward this expédition;
however, ESTRADA himself was not present at the alleged meet-
ing. Mr. THURMAN has stated that in his opinion the veracity
of ESTRADA is highly questionable.

Report of Investigator JOSEPH A. THURMAN, of
Immigration and Naturalization Service, Miami, dated Septem-
ber 13, 1957, on the PRIO case, reflects that a sworn state-
ment was taken from JOSE BRAULIO ALEMAN Y GUTIERREZ, age 26,
and citizen of Cuba, who freely admitted that he 1s opposed
to the present government in Cuba, He admitted knowing PRIO,
but denied having any knowledge of revolutionary activities
on the part of PRIO, and he also denied having in any way
financed the "Corinthea" expedition. It is to be noted that
JOSE ALEMAN is the son of a former Minister of Education in
the PRIO government of Cuba and heds.reputedly a very wealthy
man with extensive real estate holdings in Miami.

The "Miami Daily News" carried in its May 27,
1957 issue an article entitled "PRIO Denies Tieup to Cuba
Invasion,” by MILT SOSIN, "Miami News" staff writer. In
this article PRIO expressed the opinion that two insurgents
captured by the BATISTA forces had been forced by threats of
torture to name him as instigator of an "invasion" of Cuba
by the "Corinthea." He stated "I have taken no part in any
planning of the invasion of Cuba. Although I cannot deny
sympathy with these fighters for freedom, I have in no way
directed their activities." PRIO claimed that BATISTA was
always seeking to embarrass him with the United States
Government by seeking to link PRIO's name with activities
against BATISTA.

On June 13, 1957, T-2 stated that he had received
information from an informant to the effect that PEDRO LUIS
CHAVIANO Y REYES, a Cuban exile in Miami, had selected and
paid the Cubans who went on the "Corinthea."

On June 17, 1957, T-2 said that CHAVIANO was try-
ing to make arrangements for three fugitives from the
"Corinthea" to return to Miami from Cuba. These were HECTOR

CORNILLOT, MANUEL ROQUE, FERNANDO VIRELLES and CELSO STAKEMAN
GOMEZ.

On June 19, 1957, Mr. HOWARD MELCHING, Immigration
and Naturalization Service, Miami, advised that his office
had received information from Havana to the effect that PRIO
had effered $10,000.00 to the captains of three different
boats to bring FERNANDO VIRELLES INIGUEZ, HECTOR CORNILLOT
MONTANO and MANUEL ROQUE GARCIA back to the United States
from Cuba as PRIO hoped to use them as witnesses before the
United Nations.

had beén in the st, Petersburg area during the pertinent
period,

It appears that PRIO may have planted falsé in-
formation with the informant of T-2 for the purpose of
diverting investigative attention from Miami,

: The United States State Department, Washington,

D. C., has advised that on July 20, 1957, JAMES BARTON
OOD, then in Port-au-Prince, Haitl, where he had

been arrested by the Haitian authorities, wrote a letter
concerning his association with General ALBERTO BAYO
GIRAUD, of Mexico, who had also been arrested in comp:
with UNDERWOOD, UNDERWOOD alleged that BAYO admitted hav-
ing trained the followers of FIDEL CASTRO in Mexico pre-+
paratory to the voyage of "Gamma" to Cuba where FIDEL
CASTRO landed with’ 82 men; and that UNDERWOOD also learned
that BAYO had sent another boatload of men and guns from
Miami to cuba, UNDERWOOD. stated, however, BAYO's elation
was short lived when the "Corinthea" was intercepted with
loss of life and capture, He said that BAYO became panicky
and moved from place to Place around New York, fearing that
one of PRIO's "hand picked executors such as RENE MARTINEZ
or MOSHA CRESPO" might be sent to take care of him for hav-
ing failed, (Information set forth hereinafter in this re-
port reflects that JAMES BARTON UNDERWOOD was an undercover
agent of the present Cuban Government at the time he accom-
panied BAYO to Haiti, and that his mission was to antice

III, REPORTED CLANDESTINE LANDING AUGUST T, 1957
IN CUBA OF A PLANE ALLEGEDLY PILOTED BY
DANIEL VAZQUEZ

On the morning of August 8, 1957, Lieutenant
HERIBERTO HERNANDEZ, head of the Alien Control Section,
Department of Investigation, Cuban National Police, ad-
vised that about 9:30 p.m., on August 7, @ private plane
had landed on a strip of road under construction to the
east of Havana. He said that according to information ob-
tained by the police from an eye witness, the strip of
road had been lighted by the headlights of four automobiles.
Upon landing, the plane made a ground loop which resulted in
the destruction of the landing gear. Thereafter the occupants
of the plane set it on fire and drove away in the four automo-
piles which had been waiting for them.

Lieutenant HERNANDEZ stated that the. plane had
been identified by the police as bearing United States
registration number N 69727, and, pointed out that this
was the plane which, in. March; 1957, had been purchased
by DANIEL VAZQUEZ and had later been rigged with extra
gasoline tanks and reportedly was to be used to throw
out live phosphorus bombs over Cuba. Lieutenant HERNANDEZ
said the police were of the opinion that the,plane may have
been utilized to bring arms to Cuba from the United States.
He said that a witness, who lived near the landing place,
had reported that a plane had landed in the same place on
several previous occasions.

It 1s to be recalled that previous investigation
was conducted in March and April, 1957,; based upon a report
that CARLOS PRIO SOCARRAS had purchased’ a Beechcraft plane,
Registration No. N.69727, and that a load of incendiary
bembs were to be dumped by this plane on Cuba. Investiga-
tion then disclosed that this Beechcraft plane had been
purchased by DANIEL VAZQUEZ Y COEJO from the Jack Adams
Aircraft Sales, Inc., Walls, Mississippi; for the sum of
$13,645.00 on March 9, 1957. VAZQUEZ had extra fuel tanks
installed on the plane and also had had a round hole cut
in the bottom near the rear of the plane, claiming this to
be for the purpose of aerial photography.

VAZQUEZ furnished a signed statement on April 9
and 10, 1957, claiming that he purchased this plane with
his own money and he denied any plans for dropping in-
cendiaries on Cuba. He admitted being a friend and
associate of PRIO, but denied that PRIO had any interest
in this plane. He admitted having signed an application
for registration, which application certified, among other
things, that the owner, whose name appeared on the applica-
tion, was a citizen of the United States. VAZQUEZ claimed
that he did not lmow that the application had contained
such a statement. He indicated that he planned to get the
plane re-registered in the name of a corporation to be
known as Vamar, Inc., Miami, in order to avoid violating
any regulations of the CAA.

INTERVIEW REPORT

Mrs. CLAYTON GAMBER, Red Aircraft Company, advised
on August 8, 1957, that to her knowledge the twin engine
Beechcraft plane, which is usually operated by DANIEL

VAZQUEZ, had been on the field all that Wednesday, August 7,
1957. She was unaware of the plane's departure.

Later on the same day she recalled that on
August 6, 1957, at about 6:00 p.m., an Oldsmobile automobile
with charcoal bottom and white top, pulled up to the Beech-
craft which was parked some distance from the office. She
observed that this automobile carried three men. She
noticed that the trunk was opened, at which time three
wooden boxes, described as approximately four feet long,
one foot wide and one foot deep, were loaded onto the plane.
No other articles were loaded, to the best of her knowledge.
She observed that these three men waited in the vicinity of
the plane as if expecting other arrivals, but shortly there-
after departed. She observed that the! plane did not leave
the field on that day, August 6, 1957.} ‘
\
Mrs, GAMBER said that the Beechcraft plane had
had a complete motor overhaul at the instruction of an in-
dividual representing himself to be ANGEL BANOS, on May 16,
1957. She produced a worksheet dated May 16, 1957, in the
name of BANOS, which reflected that the plane was worked
on during the period May 27 through June 24, 1957, and that
this plane was finally released to the owner.on about July 15,
7 1957. No installations or body changes were made during this
period; however, when the plane was overhauled 1t was noted
that a CAA-Approved camera hatch had been installed. She
said that about this time one of the mechanics, JIM McMANN,
who had done some work in the past for VAZQUEZ, met VAZQUEZ
at Red Aircraft Company and renewed their acquaintance,

Mrs. GAMBER said that McMANN informed her that the

man whom she had been observing operating this plane was
actually VAZQUEZ and not BANOS, as she had presumed previously.

for travel by bus to Mexico City and with $25.00 in cash.

ORTA instructed the source to proceed to 125 Solis Street,

Apartment Number 3, Mexico, D.F. upon his arrival there and

to ask for CANDIDO’de la TORRE. The source said that there

were no witnesses present during the times that either PRIO
RTA gave him these instructions.

MIRET questioned source as to who had sent him.
When the source replied "PRIO", MIRET answered that he had
been expecting the source. MIRET on July 10,1957, then
drove the source in an automobile to a farm located near the
Village of Ixtapan de la Sal on the Toluca Highway about a

hour drive southwest of Mexico City. This farm was

distinguished by the fact that the farmhouse was of yellow
Stucco and had a pink roof. Corn and black beans were grown
on the farm. The source was never able to learn the name
of the owner of the farm.

The source said that he was taken to a very
long large unpainted wooden barn which served as a barracks
for approximately 55 Cubans who were there. The source
and another man named RODRIGUEZ immediately upon their
arrival were thoroughly searched by CELSO MARAGOTA, a
Cuban Revolutionary follower of PRIO who was one of the
leaders'at the camp. GELSO's search included the clothes,
pockets, and wallets of these 2 men. He tore up the
passport of RODRIGUEZ.

The source ascertained that PEDRO MIRET was in
charge of this camp. Other leaders in line of order were
LEONEL GOMEZ, who had been at the Cuban Camp in the
Dominican Republic; CELSO MARAGOTA, who appeared to have
direct supervision; and ALEJENDRO FERREIRA CORRAL who lived
in the barracks with the other men. The other leaders lived
away from the barracks, Of the 55 men quartered in these
barracks, source identified SERGIO TEUTELO, RAUL VENTA,
RICARDO PAREJA, MARIO DIAZ, MANUEL MEJIAS, ’ JOSE MORALES
BDUARDO ROIG, CARLOS ALFARO, .(FNU) BONANZO, (FNU) MILAN?
(NU) ALDAMA, (FNU) RODRIGUEZ, and (FNU) FRESNADAg.

Source said on the morning of July 11, 1957,
he returned to Mexico City with CELSO MARAGOTA and MARIO
DIAZ where 7 men including several of those named above
were picked up and taken into the city. The new arrivals
were registered at the Principal Hotel, Mexico City and
CELSO MARAGOTA registered at the Galveston Hotel. While
in Mexico City, LUIS CARBAJAL ESTRADA, who was a member of
the Triple A, which is under the leadership of AURELIANO
SANCHEZ ARANGO, who is also a member of the July 26 Movement,
joined a drinking partycwhich included the source.

. On July 13,.1957, the above Cubans, with the
exception of CARBAJAL returned to the camp near the village
of Ixtapan de la Sal and began training with 30°.06°rifles
using telescopic sights, some M-1 ‘and M-2 rifles,’ .45
caliber colts, 6 or 7 machine guns, and 2 mortars. They
were also supplied with ammunition belts and canteens and
8 or 10 in the group had uniforms. The 8 or 10 men were
also supplied with arm bands bearing the letters "0.R.”
(representing Organization Revolutionary). There were
no 26th of July insignia. /

The men arose at 6:00 AM each morning, received
calisthenics and at 9:00 AM were given coffee and milk
which was brought in from the main farmhouse. After
training with the above weapons they were taken by bus at
11:30 each morning to the village for lunch, Other
miscellaneous instructions and training were given during
the course of the afternoon. ‘

Source said that no general instructions concerning
future plans were disclosed to the man; however, CELSO
MARAGOTA confided to the source that an expedition would
leave Mexico on the night of July 26, 1957, if the Mexican
Federal Police allowed a yacht owned by CANDIDO de la
TORRE to depart. MARAGOTA indicated that this. boat would
leave from Paso Rico or Cosa Rica and that a landing would
be made in Cuba at about Arracoa or at Pilon as second choice.

The source said that morale was very poor at this
camp because the men only received 7 Mexican Pesos per day
| this being the equivalent of 56¢ on which they were expected
| to purchase their meals. -MIRET served as paymaster and
source believed that he obtained this money from CANDIDO
de la TORRES * Source learned that PABLO DIAZ
GONZALEZ, a July 26 leader in New York City, also sent money
to this group. .

On July 17, 1957, the camp at Ixtapan de la Sal
was abandoned for the stated reason that it.was always
raining there. The men were transported by bus and private
car to a farm about 1 mile from Beli Tuxpan which is located
near the Gulf of Mexico. Source said that here they were
also quartered in a big barn from which point one could see
the ocean about 3 or 4 miles away.

MARIO DIAZ on the morning following their arrival
went to MIRET and demanded that the men receive more money
as they were losing weight and were hungry. MIRET refused
whereupon DIAZ stated that he was leaving. DIAZ was joined
by_the source and together they walked to the village of
Beli Tuxpan where they caught a bus to Vera Cruz where they
separated. Source proceeded to Mexico City by plane arriving
there on July 18, 1957. On July 19, 1957, the source
contacted LUIS CARBAJAL ESTRADA, who arranged for the source
to see AURELIANO SANCHEZ ARANGO, who lives at Medellin,
Number 216, Apartment 3, Mexico’D.F. SANCHEZ ARANGO told
the source that he is opposed to PRIO and his group because
he considered PRIO to be a traitor as PRIO had returned to
Cuba under the BATISTA administration. SANCHEZ ARANGO
proposed that the source join his group, but stated that he
possessed no money and could not maintain source in Mexico,
although he needed men for his movement. Source said that he
also saw in Mexico FRANCISCO CAIROL, one of SANCHEZ ARANGO's
men who had been reportedly beaten up in Miami by an unknown
assailant earlier in July, 1957.

SANCHEZ ARANGO claimed to the source that he
has support in Cuba from military men who will revolt
against BATISTA.

SANCHEZ ARANGO told source that he could communicate
with him by writing to MARIA B, RANJEL, Medellin 216, Apartment
2, Zone 7, Mexico, D.F. and that he should place the name
"HELIA" in the corner of the envelope. Source said that
"HELIA" is identical to Dr. HELIA CALVO who resides at the

same address.

SANCHEZ ARANGO also told the source that he may
very likely lead an expedition out of Florida into Cuba.
This is to take place in the event his military following
in Cuba did not revolt against BATISTA.

On August 15, 1957, T-2 said that PRIO's group
in Mexico was getting prepared to leave the camp at Tuxpan
for a new base.

On August 16, 1957, T-2 advised that the Mexican
authorities had arrested CANDIDO de la TORRE and TULIO
PRIETO, skipper of the "Blue Chip", along with seven other
men who were not on board this boat at the time they were
arrested. In addition to the "Blue Chip", the Mexican
authorities seized the "Puxcatan™ owned by RODOLFO TIBERCIO
MARQUEZ. T-2 said that both of these boats at the time they
were seized were fully provisioned, but that there were
no guns on board. Among those arrested in addition to
CANDIDO and TULIO PRIETO were ARALDO HERNANDEZ, GUIDO
BUSTAMANTE, EDUARDO RAY, FERNANDO OROZCO, RAFAEL LEAL, and
ACHILLES IGLESIAS, [-2 said that these men were supposed
to have departed on August 15, 1957, for the Triangle
Islands, located approximately 225 miles from Tuxpan and
that they had been scheduled to pick up arms in another
Caribbean country, according to T-2's sources’ T-2 said
that the total number of Cubans who were to participate in
this expedition was estimated at about 200 men. Their
ultimate destination was Cuba.

On July 22, 1957, T-2 advised that General
ALBERTO BAYO, 5R., of Mexi¢o, reportedly left West Palm
Beach, Florida, aboard the "Blue Chip" on duly 13, 1957,
destined for either Cuba or Tuxpan, Mexico. 7-2 said that
the master of this boat was TULIO PRIETO, who has been
previously associated with CARLOS PRIO SOCARRAS, exiled
former President of Cuba, on matters relating to boats.
T-2 said that four American citizens, whose names he did
not know, were also allegedly on board this vessel.

On August 21, 1957, Miami Informant T-11 reported
that he had made certain investigation at West Palm Beach
concerning the "Blue Chip" and had ascertained that the
"Blue Chip" was docked just north of the George Washington
Hotel at West Palm Beach. T-1l said that the "Blue Chip”
took on $104.00 worth of Diesel fuel oil while there and
departed on July 20, 1957 (instead of July 13 as réported
by T-2) from West Palm Beach without élearing United States
Customs or Immigration and Naturalization Service. T-1l
said the boat had reportedly come to West Palm Beach from
Savannah, Georgia, and that when it left it was supposed
to put in at Key West although inquiry by T-1l indicated that
it did not arrive at the Port of Key West.

T-11 said that on board this vessel at the time
it departed West Palm Beach was an American captain, name
unknown, one individual who appeared to be a Puerto Rican,
and four or five other men whose nationalities were unknown
but who were probably Americans. T-1l said’ that he had
exhibited a photograph of ALBERTO BAYO, SR. to various people
who work at the dock where this vessel had been preparing
to depart, but that no one had been able/to identify BAYO
as one of those on board the vessel. T+1l said that he
ascertained, however, that it would havé been very easy for
BAYO or anybody else to board the vessel without having been
observed.

Miami newspapers carried articles date lined August
16, 1957, Mexico City, Mexico, reflecting that the "Blue
Chip" or "Blue Ship” of which TULIO PRIETO was master, had
been seized by Mexican authorities in frustrating an
alleged revolutionary expedition which was about to leave
from Tuxpan, Mexico, against Cuba; +but no mention was made
in any of these articles of General ALBERTO BAYO.

On September 8, 1957, T-2 advised that he had
received information to the effect that the "Blue Chip"
was in the process of returning to the United States with TULIO
PRIETO among those on board. T-2 said that he possessed
no information indicating that General ALBERTO BAYO was on
this vessel. \

On September 16, 1957, Mr. WILLIAM MORRIS, Investigatoy
Immigration and Naturalization Service, advised that he had
received information from an Informant to the effect that
General ABLERTO BAYO is dying in Mexico of a heart condition
having had two heart attacks. Mr, MORRIS said that according
to his Informant, ALBERTO BAYO, JR., son of General ALBERTO
BAYO, had written a letter from Mexico to a girl friend in
Miami Beach reporting his father's condition and asking
that this information be furnished to CARLOS PRIO.

On September 23, 1957, Mr. JOSEPH. THURMAN,
Investigator, Immigration and Naturalization Service, Miami,
advised that ALBERTO BAYO COSGAYA, son-of subject, had
arrived at Miami’ on September 22, 1957, via Guest Airlines
from Mexico City. BAYO, JR. advised Immigration and
Naturalization Service that his father is presently in a

Hy hospital, Sanatorium Espanol Avenida Ejercito, Mexico
Nacional, Mexico City, suffering from a serious heart
condition. He said that his father resides at Country
Club Avenue, 67 Churubeseo, Mexico, D. F., and that he
himself is a dust pilot residing at'45 Avenida North
Number 5, San Salvador, El Salvador.

BAYO, JR. admitted that his father had trained
63 men for FIDEL CASTRO in Mexico, but denied any im-
plication in the "Blue Chip;" and denied that he himself
is implicated in any revolutionary activities.

On August 26, 1957, T-2 stated that he had
recently learned through Cuban sources that CANDIDO
DE LA TORRE left Tuxpan on or about August 29-31, 1957,
1 on the "Blue Chip" with about 30 men, including General
ALBERTO BAYO on board. The "Blue Chip" proceeded to a
Small island off the Yucatan Peninsula. A small boat
was supposed to follow the "Blue Chip" with drinking
water, but this small boat failed to appear. The "Blue
Chip" was overloaded with men, arms, and suppliea and
had only. a limited amount of drinking water. As a
erisis began to develop, CANDIDO DE LA TORRE left four
men on this small island and proceeded with the remainder
of his force to a point near Veracruz where he put these
| men, including General BAYO on shore. After walking for
approximately 8 hours in the heat, BAYO suffered the heart
| attack which resulted in his having been taken to a hospital
in Mexico City. 1-2 said that PRIO subsequently sent BAYO
the sum of $600.00.

T-2 said that the "Blue Chip," upon leaving Tuxpan
was supposed to proceed to Costa Rica and that the ultimate
| destination, after sufficient guns had been obtained,was
Cuba. 1-2 alleged that the expedition was a "PRIO deal.”
Te2 said that the Mexican Navy seized the four men who had
been left off on the island and that each of the men had a
machine gun in his possession.

1-2 said that the "Blue Chip" is now at Vera-
888%, Mexico undergoing repairs. He said that FELIX de la
VORRE, son of CANDIDO, was reportedly in Miami around September
19 or’20, 1957, reporting to PRIO.

It is to be noted that the uprising at Cienfuegos,
Cuba(which will be set forth later in this report) occurred
on or about September 5, 1957, and that the "Blue Chip"
departed from Tuxpan, Mexico on or about August 29 - 31,
1957, for Costa Rica and Cuba. T-2 did not know whether
the "Blue Chip's" arrival in Cuba was to be synchronized
with the Cienfuegos uprising,

On September 26, 1957, Miami Informant T-12
reported having received the following information from a
source which has been in contact with T-12: &)

ENRIQUE CAPETILLO, a Cuban citizen who resides in
Mexico and who is described as being the right hand man of
CARLOS MARISTANY, former Minister of Communications in the
Guban Government under CARLOS PRIO SOCARRAS, disclosed that
a military junta is presently being organized in Cuba, and
that the members of this junta are in daily contact with
CARLOS PRIO who resides in Miami, Florida. The plan is to
hold a simultaneous military uprising and landing by
revolutionists who will.come from outside Cuba. SY

The arrival of CARLOS PRIO in Cuba is to be synchronized
with the revolt, Plans are being made for a general strike
in Cuba to be carried on against the will of EUSEBIO MUJAL,
head of the largest Cuban labor confederation. %\

About two weeks ago, LUIS ALBERTO MONGE, Secretary
General of ORIT (Oreanizacion Regional Interamericana de
Trabajares), a known Communist union, conferred with CARLOS
MARISTANY. 'MONGE is an enemy of MUJAL. After the meeting,
CARLOS MARISTANY stated that it had been very satisfactory.
It is to be noted that CARLOS MARISTANY is reportedly PRIO's
deputy in Mexico.t6)

The organizer to come from outside Cuba is CANDIDO
de la TORRE, alias "EL VIEGO". toh

The recent arrest of some Cuban revolutionists
and the confiscation of some weapons at Tuxpan, Mexico, )
delayed the revolt, but did not cause it to be called off.1.

MM 2-165

The recent purge of army officers in Cuba by
President FULGENCIO BATISTA may also delay the revolt,
but the corps of the army group is still intact.

T-12 said that CAPETILL@ did not disclose to
T-12's source the time of the revolt, but indicated that it
might come early in October.

CAPETILLO disclosed to T-18's source that a-radio
station had been set up in each province of Cuba and one in
Central America. T-18's source was of the opinion that the
Cuban revolutionists have a radio station in Veracruz,
Mexico, because CARLOS MARISTANY is known to make frequent
trips to Veracruz. T-38's source also believed that one
MARGOLLES is operating a clan?estine radio station station
in Miami orclose by on behalf of PRIO because PRIO must
have frequent contact with his fellow consprators in Cuba.
(It appears that MARGOLLES is identical to FERNANDO MARGOLLES,
a Cuban radio technician who resides in Miami and who was
reported previously as having gone to Mexico shortly prior to
the December, 1956, landing in Cuba of FIDEL CASTRO RUZ,
leader of the July 26 movement in Cuba. It was reported
on that occasion that MARGOLLES had gone to Mexico for
the purpose of setting up a clandestine radio in conjunction
with CARLOS MARISTANY. )

In Mexico training of Cuban revolutionists is
being carried on unier JOSE FALLAT, who was described as
having served in the Cuban revolutionafy camp which existed
in the Dominican Republic from the Fall of 1956 to April,
1957. (It appears that this individual is possibly
identical to JOSE RAMON FAYAT AQUERES who furnished a sworn
statement on September 24, 1957, to the Immigration and
Naturalization Service in’Miami, FAYAT had arrived in Miami
on September 23, 1957, from Mexico. The-day after his
arrival as a non-immigrant, he applied for an extension,
requesting political asylum, He admittéd to Immigration
and Naturalization Service having been an active
revolutionist as one of the officers in the military training
camp in the Dominican Republic, and admitted that in Mexico
he was grouping men together to go to Cuba to fight against
BATISTA.) The OA (Autentico Organizacion) has about 30 people
in Mexico in training, The July 26 group also has some people
in Mexico, and these will probably go along with the OA.
The July 26 group is finanefally-in bad straights, and PRIO
is contributing somewhat to their~support.

AURELIANO SANCHEZ ARANGO, who is chief of the
Cuban revolutionary organization known as the Triple A,
is also in Mexico, but he is not involved in the-above
plot although he has people in Cuba who are organized.

MM 2-165 :

The Cuban revolutionists in Mexico, according
to T-18's source, have a ship called the "Blue Chip",
captained by TULIO PRIETO, which ship is reportedly at Tuxpan,
Merida, Mexico, Another ship, name unknown, owned by one
CARAMES, a former police chief under PRIO,' is also now in
Merida,’ (It is believed that CARAMES is identical to JOSE
CARAMES, who was previously reported as one of the owners
of the "Mollie-O", a boat which has been reported from
tineto time in Miami as being of a’ suspicious category with
regard to revolutionary activities.) CARL MARISTANY is
expected to come to Miami soon from Mexico. @\)

There is considerable friction between the July
26 members in Mexico and the PRIO group in Mexico. According
to T-12's source, members of the July 26 group in Mexico
are unaware of the fact, as alleged by T+12's source, that
CARLOS PRIO financed the landing of FIDEL CASTRO in Cuba. SY

[-12's source feels that if the revolution against
BATISTA succeeds, the July 26 people will be pretty well
eliminated from influence in the Cuban Government because
they do not have the power and backing of the PRIO group.

V. ALLEGED PLANS TO USE HAITI
AS A BASE FOR REVQLUTIONARY
OPERATIONS .
On July 3, 1957, T-2 advised that General ALBERTO
BAYO GIRAUD andhis son ALBERTO BAYO COSGAYA, who have
been previously mentioned under Section’ IV :
of this report had gone by plane from Miami to Haiti on or
about June 25, 1957, in order to establish contact with
A. F. W. GRIFFIN, JR., United States Naval Depot, Box 33,
Naval Base, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. T-2 said that this was
for the purpose of aiding FIDEL CASTRO who is reported: leading
a croup of Cuban revolutionaries in the Sierra Maestro Mountains
in Cuba and also for establishing contact with Ex-Cuban army
officers in Haiti.

T-2 said that. ALBERTO BAYO, JR. returned to Miami

by airline from Haiti on June 29, 1957, after having apparently
failed to establish contact with GRIFFIN. He proceeded to

the home of MANOLO FERNANDEZ, an associate of CARLOS PRIO,

who resides at 1521} Southwest Second Street, Miami.

T-2 pointed out that immediately before the

BAYOs went to Haiti, they stayed at the Airways Hotel, Miami,
for 2 days after arriving from New York City and that while
there the BAYOs were in conference with CARLOS PRIO.

T-2 said that it appeared at the time that PRIO hoped

to establish a base of operation in Haiti. 1-2 also
reported on July 3, 1957, that FIDEL CASTRO had allegédly
decided to place General BAYO in charge of military tactics
and preparations and that CASTRO expected PRIO to provide
BAYO with funds.

On July &, 1957, T-2 reported having received the
following additional information. General ALBERTO: BAYO was
arrested on Friday, July 5, 1957, by the authorities in
Haiti and he was Still in jail as of July 7, 1957. He was
arrested because the Haitian authorities believed him to be
in contact with Haitian Communists. Also arrested at the
same time with him was an American, JAMES BARTON UNDERWOOD,
who had travelled with the BAYOs to Haiti from Miami. T-2
said that UNDERWOOD is a New Yorker and had apparently
met the BAYOs in New York City prior to this trip.

T-2 said that he had learned through an official
source that when BAYO was arrested he was in possession of
maps and plans relating to revolutionary activities in the
Province of Oriente, Cuba. T-2 said that he had learned
through another source that on Juke 25 or 26, ALBERTO BAYO,
JR. placed a long distance telephone call from Port-au-Prince,
Haiti to MANOLO FERNANDEZ, 1528% Southwest 2nd Street, °
telephone number FR 3-2950 and disclosed that an emissary

was expegted to arrive in Miami within twenty-four hours,
bearing information from FIDEL CASTRO.

On June 28, BAYO iagain contacted MANOLO FERNANDEZ
from Port-au-Prince, and FERNANDEZ advised that the emissary
MOISES CRESPO, had arrived in Miami from Cuba with a letter
from FIDEL CASTRO, addressed to PRIO and advising PRIO +
that General BAYO would be in charge of all military
arrangements, including the purchase of supplies.

[-2 said that following the arrival in Miami on
June 29, 1957, of BAYO, JR. from Haiti, that BAYO, JR. had
conferences with PRIO on July 1 and 2.’ BAYO, JR. disappeared
from Miami on July 3, 1957, and his whereabouts is presently
unknown to T-2. -2'said that~while BAYO, JR. was in Miami
he stayed atthe home of MANOLO FERNANDEZ.

T-2 said that he also learned through a source
in Haiti that BAYO, SR. is a Communist and that his. particular
function and mission was to obtain control of the Cuban
Army and to indoctrinate it little by little along Communist
ines.

With further regard to General ALBERTO BAYO, SR.,
[-2 advised that he was born March 28, 1892, at Camaguey,
Cuba, but later went to Spain, where he seryed with the
Spanish Republican Army; later he went: to Mexico, sponsored
by LOMBARDO TOLEDANO, whom T-2 described as being the
Communist Mexican labor leader. T-@ said BAYO now possesses
a Mexican passport. His son, ALBERTO BAYO, JR., was born
in 1927 in Spain.

1-2 said that he had learned also from his source
in Haiti that BAYO, SR. had an interview in Haiti with
Dr. FRANCISCO DUVILIERE, Haitian political leader, at which
time DUVILIERE told BAYO "Of course CARLOS PRIO can have
a base in Haiti if I become President. Didn't he help me
with arms and money?”

T-2 said that PRIO had-sent TEMISTOCLES FUENTES
to Haiti several months ago forthe purpose of establishing
contact with DUVILIERE and that PRIO subsequently sent arms
to Haita for DUVILIERE, but that these arms were discovered
and TEMISTOCLES was forced to go into hiding. 1-2 said that
Haitian officials know that FUENTES gave money to DUVILIERE
from PRIO. 1-2 said that PRIO extricated FUENTES from Haiti
by sending DANIEL VASQUEZ, Cuban pilot to Haiti by a
commerical “airline and that VASQUEZ drove FUENTES by car to
the Dominican border, where he delivered FUENTES to POLICARPO
SOLER, Cuban gangster and gun-man, who was in charge of the
Cuban’revolutionary camp which operated in the Dominican
Republic from about October, 1956, to April, 1957. T=1 said
that FUENTES returned to Miami from the Dominican Republic
in April, 1957.

T-2 said that according to his source, General
BAYO will be in charge of an expeditionary force against
the BATISTA Government. T-2 was of the opinion that no
invasion was imminent inview of the time that would be
required by BAYO to organize such a force. 1-2 said that
BAYO and his son are living somewhere in the Miami area,
but not in Miami proper.

On July 10, 1957, American Embassy at Port-au-Prince,
Haiti, advised that the HaltianPolice had arrested ALBERTO
BAYO GIRAUD on July 5, 1957, in connection with an alleged
arms plot involving American citizen JAMES BARTON UNDERWOOD
and some former Haitian army officers and that BAYO was
deported on July 6, 1957. The Embassy stated that UNDERWOOD
who was still in the custody of the Hatian authorities
then claimed that BAYO is a Communist and that he is involved
in the activities of the PRIO - CASTRO rebels in Cuba.

On July 22, 1957, T-2 advised that General BAYO
told _PRIO after he returned to Miami upon being released by
the Haiti authorities, that he was arrested, but had been
able to talk himself out of prison because of his knowledge
of the French language.

T-2 said that on July 6, 1957, he was present in
Havana when FRANCOIS MAGLIORE, a Haitian, came there
claiming to represent the Chief of the Military Junta of
Haiti. MAGLIORE reported the arrest of General BAYO and
JAMES BARTON UNDERWOOD in Haiti, stating thatBAYO and UNDERWOOD
had been conspiring with ex-army officers of Haiti concerning
a revolution which was aimed primarily against Cuba rather
than against Haiti. T-2 said that he later determined,
however, that MAGLIORE and. General BAYO flew from Haiti
to Miami aboard the same plane on July 6, 1957, after which
MAGLIORE proceeded to Havana to make the above described
report. MAGLIORE did not mention that he had left Haiti
on the same plane with BAYO and that BAYO was then in the

On June 7, 1957, T-2 reported that he had received
information from two. separate sources to the effect that
CARLOS PRIO was again rounding up his men preparatory to
some revolutionary plan, and that his men were being in-
structed to contact JOSE MURILLO at. the Palms Hotel, Miami,

B.. Concerning SERGIO EUPLIO HEREDIA Y CORRALES

In connection with a separate investigation, Miami
Informant T-13 reported on July 19, 1957 that SERGIO HEREDIA,
who claimed to. be a former Cuban representative, residing at
the Royalton Hotel, Miami, had sought the assistance of
HARRY ROLLIN, Miami, in carrying on revolutionary activities
for the following week in Holguin and Guantanamo, Cuba.
HEREDIA disclosed that he had two brothers employed at the
United States Navy Base, Guantanamo, Cuba, allegedly assisting

revolutionary followers of CARLOS PRIO. T-13 said that
HEREDIA had propositioned ROLLIN to go to Cuba to train
the revolutionists in the use of firearms, but that ROLLIN
had declined this offer.

On August 12, 1957, T-2 reported that two
Americans, CHARLES BLASDEL and JULIO FUENTES had been re-
cruited by HEREDIA for revolutionary activities in Cuba,
and that BLASDEL and FUENTES had departed Miami after
attending a meeting with CARLOS PRIO. Also present at
the meeting were HEREDIA and HARRY ROLLIN. T-2 said
that ROLLIN later proceeded to Cuba on August 9, 1957.

On August 13, 1957, T-5 advised that CHARLES
WESLEY BLASDEL, JULIO FUENTES and HARRY ROLLIN had been
arrested by the Cuban authorities in Cuba and were being
involuntarily deported to Miami. 1-5 said that BLASDEL
and FUENTES, according to the Cuban police, were re-
eruited in Miami by SERGIO HEREDIA to go to Cuba and pro-
ceed to Guantanamo for the purpose of training some 150
men in the use of firearms and grenades.

On August 13, 1957, T-2 expressed the opinion
that HEREDIA had actually been operating a confidence
scheme against PRIO, using BLASDEL, FUENTES and ROLLIN
as window dressing.

BLASDEL, FUENTES and ROLLIN returned to Miami
on August 14, 1957, and were interviewed by Special”
Agents LEMAN L. STAFFORD, JR. and GEORGE E. DAVIS, JR.

BLASDEL, who was then residing at 121 N. E.
5th Street, Miami, advised on August 14, 1957, that he
met HEREDIA in Miami, and that HEREDIA questioned
BLASDEL concerning his previous military experience as
a United States paratrooper in the United States Army,
and HEREDIA wanted to know if BLASDSL possessed knowledge
of guerrilla warfare.

HEREDIA then recruited BLASDEL to train a group
ef 156 Cubans located near Guantanamo, Cuba; later HEREDIA
claimed he had ever 200 men. He offered BLASDEL $500.00
upen arrival at Guantanamo to train these men in the use
of grenades, pistels, rifles, machine guns and submachine
guns. /

/

On August 6, 1957, immediately prior to de-
parture, BLASDEL, FUENTES and ROLLIN and HEREDIA were
driven to the home of MARISOL ALBA on DiLido Island,

Miami Beach, Florida, where they were introduced to

CARLOS PRIO. PRIO sheck hands with those present and

then remarked to BLASDEL, "it is a very nice thing that
young Americans are fighting for independence and democracy."
BLASDEL said that he told PRIO that he had military ex-
perience and instructions in the use of firearms. As the
party get up to leave HEREDIA remarked to PRIO, "0. K. Mr.
President," and then said goodbye.

Shortly thereafter BLASDEL and FUENTES departed
fer Cuba, having been furnished $100.00 by HEREDIA with
the understanding that they were to receive $500.00 from
a contact in Cuba. However, upon meeting this contact,
PASTOR TARRERO, they learned that he knew nothing about
HEREDIA's plans and they received no money from him.

‘BLASDEL said that FUENTES had no military ex-
perience and could not have trained any revolutionaries.
BLASDEL frankly admitted that he and FUENTES had\ intended
only to obtain the $500.00 without performing any services
in return. He said that he possessed no information of
HEREDIA having received any money from PRIO, and that
HEREDIA told him that he should take his orders solely
from HEREDIA. BLASDEL said that as a result of this trip
+0 Cuba he now realized that HEREDIA's proposition was a
big hoax, apparently for the purpose of obtaining money
from PRIO, and that 1t became obvious to him as a result
of this trip that HEREDIA was not the head of any revolutionary
group in Cuba, did not have any organization, and that
HEREDIA had made false representations. The present where-
abouts of BLASDEL is unknown.

On August 14, 1957, JULIO FUENTES, 93 N. W.
3lst Street, Miami, gave similar information but did
not admit having met PRIO, although he acknowledged
having gone to the home of MARISOL ALBA on Dilido Island.
FUENTES claimed that he merely went on the trip to Cuba
as an interpreter and escort for BLASDEL, and he claimed
that they planned to leave Cuba immediately after’ receiv-
Ing the $500.00, which they had been offered by HEREDIA.

On August 14, 1957, JOSEPH EMMANUEL HARRY
ROLLIN, then residing at the South American Hotel, Miami,
now residing 5056 S. Woodlawn Avenue, Chicago, Illinois,
advised that HEREDIA first claimed, in about July, 1957,
to have come to Miami for the purpose of getting $6,000.00
from PRIO to obtain guns at the United States Navy Base,
Guantanamo, ROLLIN admitted having met PRIO, along with
HEREDIA, BLASDEL and FUENTES, at the home of "MARISOL,"
who said that PRIO remarked that he was glad to know that
American boys were interested in freedom in Cuba, and that
PRIO remarked to BLASDEL, "you don't speak Spanish but you
speak enough to call BATISTA a SOB." ROLLIN stated on
August 9, 1957, he went to Cuba carrying a letter for
HEREDIA, but this letter was never delivered and ROLLIN
was placed in jail with BLASDEL and FUENTES, who had been
arrested by the Cuban authorities at Santiago, Cuba.

On August 18, 1957, SERGIO EUPLIO HEREDIA
CORRALES, now reportedly living at the Palms Hotel, Miami,
was interviewed by Special Agents STAFFORD and DAVIS, upon
termination of an interview of him by Immigration and
Naturalization Service, Miami, following his return to
Miami from Jamaica on August 17, 1957.

HEREDIA admitted being a friend of CARLOS PRIO,
put stated that he is affiliated with the Free Orthodox
Party of Cuba. He denied having gone to Cuba in July,
1957 to obtain guns at the United States Navy Base. He
a@mitted having met FUENTES, BLASDEL and ROLLIN, and
said that he told them that he was the leader of a group
ef 300 or 400 in Santiago, Cuba, whereupon FUENTES ad-
vanced the idea that he and his two companions train

this group.

HEREDIA said that he offered to put them in
teuch with CARLOS PRIO. He said that he lent FUENTES
and BLASDEL money for. airline travel before they con-
tacted PRIO; that he then arranged for an audiénce with
PRIO for FUENTES, BLASDEL, ROLLIN and himself on August 6,
at which time FUENTES, BLASDEL and ROLLIN expressed to
PRIO their desire to fight for the downfall of BATISTA.
HEREDIA said that PRIO then remarked to the effect that
he was very glad that there were Americans interested
in the noble cause of independence in Cuba and willing
to fight for it. HEREDIA said that after BLASDEL, FUENTES
and ROLLIN left the room he then talked privately with
PRIO and told PRIO that the other three had no money for -
expenses and that he himself had obtained airline tickets
for two of them but had nothing else to give them.
HEREDIA said that PRIO then peeled off two $100.00 bills
from money in his pecket and said that this was to be
used for the boys' expenses.

HEREDIA said that prior to the departure of
FUENTES and ROLLIN that same day he gave them the name
ef PASTOR TARRERO, a PRIO chief in Santiago, as a person
to contact, but he denied stating that TARRERO would pay
them $500.00.

On August 9, 1957, ROLLIN departed Miami on the
game mission, according to HEREDIA, with money given him
by HEREDIA from the same funds supplied by PRIO. On the
same day HEREDIA departed for Jamaica with expectation
of being prepared for a hop to Cuba.

On August 20, 1957, ROLLIN advised Special
Agents STAFFORD and DAVIS that he, BLASDEL and FUENTES
had contacted attorney GINO NEGRETTI on August 15, 1957,
and that on August 19, 1957, NEGRETTI, in the presence
of a Cuban named MARTINEZ, gave each of them $20.00, ad-
vising them that PRIO was going to furnish each with
money, and NEGRETTI instructed them to recontact him on
August 20, 1957. ROLLIN said on August 20, 1957, MARTINEZ,
in the absence of NEGRETTI, gave each of them $180.00 and
told BLASDEL to "stick around" as there would be more money.
ROLLIN said that NEGRETTI described MARTINEZ as being a
representative of CARLOS: PRIO.

with PRIO as a personal friend for twenty years and said
that PRIO frequently visits in her home. When questioned
as to whether HEREDIA, BLASDEL, FUENTES and ROLLIN had
been in her house during the first part of August, she re-
plied that during the first weeks of August Dr. PRIO came
to her house and there were some other persons mentioned
present. She said that "Dr. NEGRETTI" introduced her to
BLASDEL and FUENTES. When specifically questioned as to
whether PRIO had met in her home FUENTES, ROLLIN (and
VICHOT) at any time during the first weeks of August,

the time that Dr. PRIO came to my house to visit me and
he said hello to them. It was a social party." She said
that Dr. NEGRETTI was on the porch and PRIO was in the
living room.

With regard to BICHOT, it is to be noted that

| c Training Pamphlet

On June 11, 1957, Mr. E. DAVID ROSEN, Assistant
United States Attorney, Miami, made temporarily available
to Special Agent GEORGE E, DAVIS, JR. for examination a
pamphlet which he had obtained from a person whose identity
| he could not disclose, Mr. ROSEN described this person as
being a Miami attorney who had merely loaned him this
pamphlet. Mr. ROSEN said the pamphlet was apparently being
used by Cuban revolutionaries in the Miami area, It is
net kmown whether this pamphlet is being used by followers
of CARLOS PRIO or by other Cubans.

An examination of this pamphlet reflects that
it is entitled "A Soldier's ABC," and was published in
Mexico in 1955. It purports to be a summary of military
science, The author, unidentified, concludes his fore~
word with the statement "If the heroic youth who attacked
the Moncada Barracks had had military experience, the
Monstrous Crime which was committed with those who sur-
rendered, would not have happened. For the lack of this
elementary knowledge, their precious lives were lost at
the sadistic hands of those who dishonored the noble
uniform of our army forever, and cther officers will know
how te avenge the glory and the &enor of that institution."

It is to he noted that the attack on the Moncada
Barracks was led by FIDEL CASTRO, leader of the July 26
| Movement and not by PRIO.

The Manual relates to Training, Combat, Rules of
Discipline, Security Measures, Nomenclature of Weapons,
Combat in the City, Combat Teams, Defense, Combat in the

Miami newspaper reports on September 6, 1957 re-
flected that an uprising, involving elements of the Cuban
Navy and Army, took place at Cienfusps, Cuba, on Septem-
ber 5, 1957. The uprising was soon crushed by government
troops which were dispatched to the scene of the uprising.

On September 6, 1957, Immigration and Naturaliza-
tion Service Investigator JOSEPH THURMAN, Miami, reported
having received information from JESUS ESTRADA, who claimed
to have attended a meeting on September 5, 1957, between
12:20 p.m. and 12:30 p.m., with CARLOS PRIO SOCARRAS, and
ethers, at the home of Colonel RAPHAEL IZQUIERDO, Aide to
PRIO, at which time PRIO stated that the uprising at
Cienfuegos, Cuba which had just been announced that day
was under the direction of his people and that seven mem-
bers of the Cuban Naval Training Detachment had joined his
forces.

On September 6, 1957, T-2 advised that he had

the situation at Cienfuegos was under complete control
ef the BATISTA Government.- T-2 said that the insurgents,
many of whom were members of the FIDEL CASTRO July 26
Movement, dressed as Cuban Navy officers, had surprised
the Navy garrison at Cienfuegos on September 5, 1957, and
had succeeded in occupying some outer buildings.

T-2 said that he had received information from
several sources which indicated that CARLOS PRIO was com-
pletely surprised by the uprising and had nothing whatso-
ever to do with it but may be attempting to claim credit.

The September 7, 1957 issue of the "Miami Herald"
carried an article entitled "BATISTA Points to PRIO," by
GEORGE SOUTHWORTH, Herald Assistant City Editor. This
article, which was date lined Havana, reflected that
President FULGENCIO BATISTA placed all the blame for the

IX.. MISCELLANEOUS REPORTS OF ALLEGED
EXPEDITIONS

On September 5, 1957, Immigration & Naturalization
Service Investigator JOSEPH THURMAN, Miami, advised that
JESUS ESTRADA, previously mentioned in this report, attended
a meeting with CARLOS PRIO on September 3; 1957, at which
time PRIO explained, according to ESTRADA, that he was now
in the process of forming an expedition which would leave
from Tampa, Florida; that he had some planes available and
that PRIO considered Tampa to be a logical place for such
an expedition because there are many Latins and not much
surveillance in Tampa.

Report of Immigration & Naturalization Service
Investigator JOSEPH A. THURMAN, dated January 13, 1957,
Miami, in the PRIO case reflects that ESTRADA reported
having attended a meeting with PRIO at the home of Colonel
RAFAEL ISQUIERDO, at which time PRIO privately told ESTRADA
that BATISTA's days are numbered and that he is planning
a big expedition which would strike at three provinces at
one time. This same report reflects that on September 10,
1957, ESTRADA reported having attended another meeting on
September 9, 1957, at which time PRIO told ESTRADA to
stand by for an expedition; that PAULA (JOSEPH PAULA ,
owner of PAULA's Restaurant, Miami,) was handling the recruitment
for the expedition and was receiving $25,000.00 for such
services; that the contact man in Tampa was Doctor MUNOZ
(not otherwise identified).

It is to be noted that no information has been
received substantiating the above information reported
by ESTRADA and circumstances indicate that PRIO may have
| intentionally planted this information with ESTRADA for the
| purpose of camouflaging other plans.

| On August 23, 1957, Miami Informant T-2 reported

| that ORLANDO GARCIA VASQUEBZ,'an associate of CARLOS PRIO,

who has been spending most of his time in Costa Rica,

had reportedly departed Miami on August 23, 1957, for

Costa Rica via Pan American Airways after allegedly negotiating
an agreement between PRIO and EUFEMIO FERNANDEZ, former

Cuban Police Official and Caribbean Legion Member, who

resides in San Jose, Costa Rica, where he is a close

friend of the secretary of JOSE FIGUERES, President of

Costa Rica.

T-2 expressed the belief that’ a major revolutionary
attempt would be launched by PRIO by September 15, 1957,
from Florida and from the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico with.
the possibility of Costa Rica being used as a third base of
operations.

On September 13, 1957, T=-9 reported that ORLANDO
GARCIA VASQUEZ, when in Costa Rica, had stated that MARIO
DELIO MASIP MASIQUE, a Cuban henchman'of PRIO'ts, had arrived
in San Jose from Miami on September 6, 1957, T-9 reported
having received information that since his arrival MASIP
had instructed Cuban exiles in San Jose to try to get to
Miami as soon as possible to join PRIO in launching a new
front against BATISTA, either from Florida or Mexico.
T-9 said that ORLANDO GARCIA was: planning to leave Costa
Rica for Florida on September 13, 1957. (SY

T-9 said that upon his return from a trip to Miami
on August 23, 1957, ORLANDO GARCIA brought back instructions
from PRIO to dissolve any Cuban group that had any intention
of invading Cuba. T-9 said that according to GARCIA, the
fact. that United States authorities had confiscated .
arms destined for Cuban rebels was the determining factor. S)

On October 1, 1957, ORLANDO GARCIA VASQUEZ, 251
Southwest 12th Street, came to the Miami Office, reported
that he had returned on September 29, 1957, via Pan American
Airlings Flight 732 from Costa Rica via Pan American Airways
and that there are only about 35 Cubans left in San Jose.
He said that all of these men are hoping to come to the
United States; that there are no organized activities in
Costa Rica and that there is no cooperation between
President JOSE FIGUERES of Costa Rica and PRIO, He also
claimed there is no Cuban training camp in Costa Rica and
that EUFEMIO FERNANDEZ is resting on his reputation and is
not engaged in any revolutionary actitivies.

It is to be noted that ORLANDO GARCIA VASQUEZ
yas accompanied to the Miami Office by DANIEL VAZQUEZ,
iwho has been previously mentioned in this report.

planes at Marathon, Florida, and that T-2's Informant had
been sent by PRIO to chauffeur a Cuban aviator named
VERDAGUER to Marathon on May 29, 1957, for reasons
unknown to T-2's Informant,

On June 26 and July 2, 3, and 10, 1957, SA CHARLES
W. KELLY made observations at the Marathon Airport, Marathon,
Florida, but no C-45 planes were observed, On July 10
1957, Mr. HARRY SENNING, Manager, Orange State O11 Company,
Bulk Plant, which is logated adjacent to the Marathon
Airport, advised SA KELLY that he is the unofficial manager
of the airport. Mr. SENNING said that he had never seen
any C-45 planes land on this field; although, in the past
on several occasions planes of Cuban registry had made
emergency landings.

On the same date, Mr. D. M. ANDREWS, Constable,
District 3, Marathon, Florida, who is a pilot’and who
maintains an airplane at the Marathon Airport, advised that
he has maintained a close watch on this airport for several
years upon the request of another Federal Investigative
Agency and that he has not seen any C-45 planes at that
field. He said that the only Cuban pilot with whom he had
become friendly was one "VERDAGUER" had had been a pilot for the
“Tlisro-: IntersAmericano Expresso which had made two emergency
landings at the airport, He possessed no information
indicating that VERDAGUER had engaged in any irregular
activity on those occasions. -It is to be noted that ROBERTO and
GUILLERMO VERDAGUER, brothers, are Cuban pilots formerly
employed by the Aero Inter-Américano Expresso Company,
but who are now employed in Mexico. They are reportedly
followers of PRIO.

On October 7, 1957, T-5 advised that RAPAEL
CASTRO SAN ROMAN, a former Cuban Navy Officer, had been
arrested October 2, 1957, by the Cuban authorities following
his arrival on October 1} 1957, in Cuba from Miami. SAN ROMAN
told T-5 that on about Séptember 29, 1957, DANIEL VASQUEZ,
Miami Cuban pilot and friend of CARLOS prio, disclosed to

SAN ROMAN that the Cuban Revolutionaries in Miami had five
B-25 airplanes located at Tampa, Tallahassee, and New York
City; that these planes were scheduled to be brought

- 118 -

WM 2-165

individually to Miami International Airport from whence they
would depart on October 10, 1957, individually; that they
would rendezvous over Marathon, Florida, and would then
proceed to Cuba for the purpose of bombing Camp Colombia.
According to SAN ROMAN, each of these planes were scheduled
to load 10 one hundred’ pound bombs in Miami before departing
on this mission. SAN ROMAN claimed that VAZQUEZ had proposed
to sign up SAN ROMAN as a pilot for oné of these planes

along with ROBERTO and GUILLERMO VERDACUER] brothers, and
ANTONIO MICHEL YABOR JUSTI, all pilots. 3AN ROMAN, according
to T-5 claimed that he did’not know if PRIO was involved.

T-5 said that MICHEL is now in jail in Cuba, but
that DANIEL VAZQUEZ did not know about MICHEL's imprisonment.
T-5 said that the VERDAGUER brothers were reportedly in
Mexico.

On the same day, T-2 reported similar information
along with the allegations that the above planes would arrive
in Miami between October 8 and 10, 1957, and park near hangars
of the L. B. Smith Aircraft Corporation, located at Miami
International Airport. T-2 said that this company is
presently overhauling B-25s for the Venezuelan Government
and that it was apparently felt that if the above five
described B-25s were parked in the vicinity of the L. B.
Smith Company, that these planes would not attract notice.

T-2 said that MICHEL YABOR, immediately prior to
his arrest by the Cuban authorities in Cuba had been planning
to return to Miami on the "Veramar" which he said is the same
boat that DANIEL VAZQUEZ feturned to Miami on along with
ex-Lieutenant CROSS and RAUL DIAZ ARGUELLES, all of whom
had made a claydestined landing in Cuba in A twin engine
beachcraft as previously reported under

<$écttar III of this report. T-2 said that the "Veramar"
is presently being detained in Cuba; that the crew of the
boat are in jail and that the "Veramar" is Cuban owned
boat which flies the Honduran Flag.

On October 7 and 8, 1957, Mr. HERROL BELLAMY,
Executivel/Vice-President and’ General Manager of the L. B.

and that it would be ready for flight by the end of this week
and would be delivered to MIAD, at the Air Force Reserve
Base, Miami International Airport, for Storage there by the
Venezuelan Government. He said that the second plane would
not be ready for at. least two weeks and that the other

B-25s would not be ready for use until later dates. Mr.
BELLAMY said that all of these B-25s are fenced in and are
maintained under guard and that it would be relatively
impossible for anyone to use these planes without his
knowledge. Mr, BELLAMY said that he possessed no information

indicating any planned use of these planes by Cuban Revolutionaries.

Mr. BELLAMY also reported that he had returned
from a plane hunting trip to the west coast and that if
there were any B-25s anywhere in Florida, he would most
likely know about them. He said that he knew of no such
planes; that B-25s are scarce, and that the few not in service
of the United States Air Force have been converted to
executive planes by large corporations.

On October 7, 1957, Mr. MARTIN E, HANSEN, ,
Supervisor, Control Tower, Civil Aeronautics Administration,
Miami International Airport; Mr. HENRY B. IBBETSON, Assistant
Supervisor of Communications, CAA, and Mr. WILLIAM J. BARKER,
Aviation Safety District, CAA, advised that they possessed
no information concerning any’B-25s in the Miami area which
were "not known to be in legitimate use. They offered to
immediately notify the Miami Office in the event any B-25s
arrived in Miami under questionable circumstances or
whose ownership and operation could not be satisfactorily
accounted for.

SA HOWARD K. RUTHERFORD at Tampa, Florida, contacted
Mr. HOOIE of the United States Customs Service on October
8, 1957, and he contacted Mr. PHIL CRAWFORD of the Immigration
& Naturalization Service on October 9 and 10, 1957, and on
October 8, 1957, he contacted Mr. BRUNER, Chief of the CAA,
Tampa, for information concerning the above B-25s with
negative results.

On.October 8, 1957, the Mobile Office advised that
investigation at Tallahassee, Florida, reflected that the
only regular airport having landing facilities in Leon
County for B-25 planes is the Tallahassee Municipal Airport

- 120 -

MM 2-165 5

and that authorities at this airport statelthat no B-25
plane is there now and no such plane has been there for at
least two weeks. A physical inspection of two landing
strips in rural areas outside Tallahassee failed to disclose
any 3-25 planes.

On October 10, 1957, the New York Office advised
that the CAA, CAB, INS,’United States Customs, and airports
in the metropolitan area, New York, were alerted and that
none could furnish any substantiating information conceraing
the above described B-25 planes.

On October 10, 1957, Mr. WILLIAM LANKFORD, United
States Customs, advised that he had surveyed airplane
landing fields in the Miami area for B-25s with negative

XI. REPORTS CONCERNING EFFORTS TO
ACQUIRE BOATS FOR ALLEGED
REVOLUTIONARY PURPOSES

On June 27, 1957, T-2 reported having received
information from a source to the effect that CARLOS PRIO
had acquired two boats, one being under repair in the Miami

\. area, and that one of these boats was going to Costa Rica
to pick up EUFEMIO FERNANDEZ and men under his command
and would then proceed to an island off the coast of Mexico
for more men and arms and would then proceed to Cienfuegos,

A. Rez "Oldot™

On June 26, 1957, Miami Informant T-14 advised
that on June 21, 1957, Miami Yacht Broker CHARLES MILLS
sent two men to see WILLIAM LANCASTER, owner and master of
the "Oldot™, a houseboat docked at Nuta's Boatyard, Miami
River. Upon visiting the "Oldot", a 53 foot gas motored
eight knots speed American registered houseboat, the two
men expressed a desire to charter this boat for a trip of
five or six days to the Southwest end of Andros Island,
British West Indies, for the alleged purpose of surveying
commercial lobster fishing prospects. It is to be noted
that Andros Island is a rather isolated island of the
Bahaman group and is a logical approach to Cuba. Tel4
said that one of the men who inquired about the "Oldou™
told WILLIAM LANCASTER that he did not want his name
entered on any documents. This man, who will be referred
to as number 1, stated that he desired to depart Miami on

- lal-

MM 2-165

the following Monday and that it would be unncessary ‘for the
boat's owner to have his steward on board , but that he did
desire to take along a skiff with an outboard motor.

Number 1 also expected LANCASTER to pilot the boat. T-14
said that on June 23, 1957, CHARLES MILLS expressed to
LANCASTER his opinion thatthe two prospective lessors

of this boat were implicated in Cuban political matters and
planned to meet another boat on the high seas.

T-14, who had an opportunity: to view both of the
men who attempted to charter this boat, examined a photograph
of JUAN HERRERO CAMEJO and stated that he felt reasonably
certain that HkRRERO is identical to the number 1 man whom
he described as being about 45 years of age; 5 feet, 11;
stocky build; swarthy complexion; black hair and mustache
and spoke no English. He described this man as being a

ban.

T-1h described the number 2 man as being about
45 years of age, slender ‘build, dark hair, fair complexion,
and who spoke good English.

T-ly said that LANCASTER expected to enter
into a contract that same day with CHARLES MILLS, his
broker, for the above two men to charter this boat at
$100.00 per day.

It is to be noted that JUAN HERRERO CAMEJO
has been previously identified in this report as being one
of the individuals implicated in the purchase of the ‘Corinthea’.

On June 28, 1957, T-12 advised that the two Cubans
“interested in chartering the "Oldot™ never returned to see
LANCASTER.(S\

On June 30, 1957, HANS MILTON, employee of
CHARLES MILLS, Boat Broker, Miami River, identified ENRIQUE
CASADO as one of two Cubans who had come to him and who
had been interested in chartering the "Oldot", Mr, MILTON
was unable to identify JUAN HERRERO CAMEJO. He said that
he sent. two Cubans to Nuta's Boatyard so that they could
personally examine the "Oldot™, MILTON said that he knew
CASADO as a Cuban businessman who had expressed a desire to
survey the craw fishing possibilities in the vicinity of
the Andros Island. He also knew CASADO -to be pro-PRIO and anti-
BATISTA, ;

- 122 -

Previous investigation in this case has indicated
that ENRIQUE CASADO is a Cuban businessman who is associated
with CARLOS PRIO. He presently resides in Miami.

B. "Sergeant Day Turner"

On August 20, 1957, T-11 advised that FILABERTO
MARTIN residing at the Gomez Hotel,Miami, is the owner of
the "Sergeant Day Turner", which is docked in the Miami
River and that MARTIN had been recruiting deck hands
ostensibly for a trip to Columbia. T-1l said that it was
rumored around the Gomez Hotel; however, that MARTIN was
actually trying to round up some Revolutionaries for a trip
to Cuba,

Report of Immigration & Naturalization Investigator
JOSEPH A. THURMAN, dated August 30, 1957, Miami, in the PRIO
case reflects that an anonymous report was received by that
office’ that the "Sergeant Day Turner" was probably being
outfitted for use in connection with the Cuban’ Revolutionaries
Investigator AL CANTA ascertained that this boat was sold
by the Hastern Shipping Corporation, Miami, to FILASERTO
MARTIN for the sum of $5,000.00 and that the boat was docked
at Jones! Boatyard in the Miami River. Mr. CANTA determined
that this boat had no motors and that it was intended to be
used to haul school desks from Miami to Cuba by being towed
by another boat.

C. Re: "Johmi. Morreli"

On June 3, 1957, T-2 advised that he had received
information from a source that a converted LCI. vessel,
located on the Miami River above the 17th Avenue Bridge was
being worked on preparatory to transporting Cuban Revolutionaries
and arms from Miami to Cuba for the purpose of engaging in
Revolution against the Government of BATISTA. T-2 said
that his source had identified this vesse] as the "John I.

distributor of automobiles, refrigerators, ete. T-15

said the "Joh® I. Morrell" is 159 feet long, 215 gross
tonnage; that the ceiling price was $36,000.00, and that it
is a converted LCI... 1-15 said the deal appeared to be
legitimate and T-15 possessed no evidence that it was to be
used for any revolutionary purposes.

On June 8, 1957, Mr. DuBOIS KNAPP, 3464 Oak
Avenue, Coconut Grove, Miami, advised that he is the
Chief Engineer of this boat and is employed by ANTONIO
SANPERE of Caracas, Venezuela, who is a distributor of
automobiles, refrigerators and other similar equipment in
South America. Mr. KNAPP stated there was no reason
whatsoever to believe that this vessel was to be used for
any revolutionary purposes. He produced stationery of the
SANPERE firm reflecting that it is known'as Distribuidore
SANPERE, C.A., telephone 412847, Caracas, Venezuela.

On August 20, 1957, United States Customs, Miami,

De. Re: 0O/S"Edvina"

On September 5, 1957, T-16 advised that he had
reason to suspect that the 0/S "Edvina" was to be used
by Cubans for revolutionary purposes. T-16 said that he
was unable to furnish additional information.

On September 23, 1957, Mr. CURTIS A. RIGGS,
United States Customs, Miami, advised that the 0/S "Edvina"™
is a 52 foot wooden vessel which was registered in Miami
on April 20, 1955, but which had apparently been dismantled
in March, 1956, at which time the boat was owned by the
Dietel Marine Salvage Company of Opa-Locka, Florida,

Mr. RIGGS said that on June 14, 1957, Mr.
OSMOND V. BODDEN, 830 Northwest 34th Avenue (not necessarily

XII. POLITICAL ACTIVITIES ~ PRIO
ETS _~ _PRIO.
A. Press Comment by PRIO 5/12/57.

The May 12, 1957, issue of the"Diario Las Americas"
carried an article in the Spanish language entitled "Dr.
PRIO SOCARRAS Comments on the Fall of General ROJAS PINILLA,*
This article quoted PRIO: "The fall of ROJAS PINILLA in
Colombia must bring joy to men throughout the world who
profess democratic ideals. One more dictator has disappeared
from the political scene of America... «This lesson
applies to dictators who, like BATISTA in Cuba, believe
that they are strong because momentarily they count on the
suprort of armed forces...,..The resistance against the
dictatorship of BATISTA is" constantly growing in spite of
the efforts of the Dictator to deceive the Cuban people
and foreign public opinion with false gestures of democratic
conciliation,"

B. Cuban Politicians in Miami on the Week-end
of May 17-20, 1

The May 21, 1957, issue of the "Diario Las
Americas" carried an article entitled "Cuban Politicians
Display Unusual Activity This Week-end" by RENE VIERA,
reading as follows:

"The week which has just ended was filled with
gvents for the Cuban colony of this city. Without
any exaggeration, we could say that the Cubans from
the neighboring island have turned their eyes to
what is going on in Miami.

NW 64954 Docld:34517433 Page 131


MM 2-165

| "Things began to happen last Monday, when a
meeting organized by the members of the Revolutionary
Directory and the July 26 Movement was held in Bay-
front Park in memory of those who had died in Havana

| on March 13.and April 19. At that meeting, /ex-President

PRIO said that he was opposed to the holding of elec-
tions in Cuba, under the present circumstances. Coinci-

dentally, it was announced in Havana that ‘TONY VARONA

would leave for Miami in order to confer with PRIO on

the election possibilities, and that MARQUEZ STERLING

would do the same thing, in order to take steps for

the return of Dr. EMILIO OCHOA and to have him participate

in the elections which have been convoked. MARQUEZ

STERLING arrived in Miami Friday night and his

arrival was the object of demonstrations of dis-

pleasure on the part of some unidentified persons

VARONA arrived Saturday morning. Others also-arrived,

among them ex-Senator HECTOR PAGES and journalist

LUIS CONTE AGUERO.

"While VARONA was conferring with PRIO and MARQUEZ
STERLING was speaking with OCHOA, the Revolutionary
Directory invited the Cubans to a Requiem Mass, in
memory of those who had died in the Palace and on
Humboldt Street, which was celebrated Sunday in St.
| Patrick's Church, Miami Beach, In their turn, the
members of the July 26 held two different meetings in
the Lodge Buildings The presence of PRIO at one of them
and that of the sisters of FIDEL CASTRO at the other
| brought coments from the whole Cuban colony in this
city. And to add still greater importance to the mat-
ter, Television Channel 4 exhibited in private to about
two hundred Cubans, among them PRIO, himself, VARONA
| and a sroup of Cuban journalists, the movie filmed on
the Sierra Maestra, in which is reported the activity
of the guerrillas commanded by CASTRO. More than 300
persons stationed on North Miami Avenue uttered shouts
of protest against some persons present, describing
them as electionists, and against some Cuban newspaper-
men who came to report the event.

"Bor the time being, it seems that PRIO is in favor
of abstaining and that VARONA seconds him in that position.
Up to now, it is not known what position OCHOA will
take. Apparently, the talks with MARQUEZ 3TERLING

- 126 -

"are still going on. In the meantime, we have been told
that the Orthodox leaders, Dr. HUMBERTO FIGUERAS and
JOSE MANUEL GUTIERREZ, aré also in Miami, and that they
according to the assumption of informed sources, favor
that OCHOA continue to abstain in the elections.”

On May 22, 1957, T-2 said that while in Miami
ANTONIO VARONA told’ PRIO to forget about a revolution aS

BATISTA was going to hold elections, but PRIO answered "No,
I will ride this revolutionary horsé all the way through."

C. May 13, 1957, Speech by PRIO

The May 12, 1957, issue of the "Diario Las
Americas" carried an advertisement in Spanish announcing
that the "Revolutionary Directory" and "July 26 Movement”
invited all Cubans to attend a meeting May 13, 1957, in
Bayfront Park, Miami, during which time a floral offering
would be deposited at the statue of JOSE MARTI, Cuban hero,
in memory of the Cubans who died in Cuba on March 13, 1957,
during the attack on the Presidential Palace, Havana.

The May 15, 1957, issue of the "Diario Las
Americas" carried an article entitled "We Cannot Compromise
with the Dictatorship, Says PRIO SOCARRAS, "by RENE VIERA.
PRIO stated, in part, according to this article, "We want
the unity of all Cubans who are fighting to restore liberty
to our oppressed fatherland; we want the unity of all the
sectors engaged in this battle for the restoration of our
Constitution, but we cannot ask for unity with those who
basely go along with the Government of usurpation.” Other
speakers were OSVALDO GARCIA, master of ceremonies; Mr.
SERRANO; student leader TE “ISTOCLES FUENTES; ALBERT MORA
BECERRA, son of the Cuban Legislator ,MENELAQ MORA who died
during the March 13th attack on the Presidential Palace;

at the I.0.0.F. Hall, Miami, sponsored by the July 26

Club of Miami, presided over by JACINTO VAZQUEZ, President.
T-17 said that among the speakers was CARLOS PRIO who stated
"I want you to know that being President entails many
responsibilities and many mistakes are made, since many

times the ambition is very great. I remember. when we were
fighting MACHADO and we were young. We were fighting in

the streets and we did what we were told. I know that revolutions
cost much bloodshed, and I no longer feel that Ihave the
strength to go and fight-in the streets. It is necessary

to let the youth go ahead. I do not aspire to anythirg.And I
repeat to you that you can count on my help for whatever you
want. Unfortunately, here and in Cuba, there are those who
are traitors and who turn their backs to reality. BATISTA
is going, and so are his clique and the traitors. There must
be liberty and democracy. in Cuba. I leave everything to
youth and hope that at the given moment they will know how
to act wisely."

E. The May 30 Statement of PRIO Appearing in 5/30/57
Issue of "Dairio Las Americas"

The May 30, 1957, issue of the Spanish language
newspaper "Diario Las Americas", Miami, carried an article
entitled "Ex-President PRIO Expresses His Opinion on Recent
Events", reading as follows:

Miami, Florida, May 29 (UP)="Through good fortune
for the cause of liberty, Cuba will soon see itself free
of BATISTA," declared CARLOS PRIO SOCARRAS, the Cuban
President who was deposed by BATISTA in 1952.

PRIO made a statement to the press because of the
events which are taking place in his fatherland. "As he
hasdone on every similar occasion in the past, BATISTA
is blaming me for the most recent incident in the long fight
of Cuba against his bloody dictatorship: the landing of
an expeditionary force on the northern coast of the Island."

After stating that if one believed this statement,
one would suppose that he, PRIO SOCARRAS, must be "tremendously
popular in Cuba, since every time something happens,he
credits me with having directed or inspired every bit of
discontent or rebellion against his hated regime”, The ex-
President said that the truth is that BATISTA is faced
with the opposition of a whole people, six million resolved
persons "in open rebellion against his tyranny throughout
the Island, and who will surely overthrow his brutal regime

in the near future.”

He likewise rejects the label of Communist which
the Cuban Government applies to its adversaries and claims
that in reality the one who was elected in an alliance
with the Communist Party "unier the emblem of the hammer
and the sickle was FULGENCIO BATISTA" in the elections of
1940.

It is to be noted that CESAR FONSECA, who served as
spokesman, according to the "Miami Daily News"’article, is
a close friend of CARLOS PRIO, Also among those arrested
by the police are several who were in the Cuban camp in
the Dominican Republic, JACINTO 4. VAZQUEZ and a number of
others are members of the July 26 Club of Miami, which
sponsored the meeting on May 18, 1957, before which PRIO
spoke. Other individuals such as M4 Rio MASIP, ENRIQUE
CASADO and PEDRO L. CHAVIANO REYES have been previously
reported in this investigation as being associated with
FRIO.

Those arrested were booked on charges of disorderly
conduct by unlawful assembly and some were also charged
with resisting arrest and assault on police officers.
Subsequent newspaper articles reflected that only several
of the above group were fined and the charges against the
others were dropped.

On May 31, 1957, T-2 advised that he had received
information that PRIO had given. instructions for as many
of his men as possible and their wives to gather at the
statue of JOSE MARTI and to march with Cuban and American
Flags to the Pan American Building in order to stage a
mstration there, The Cuban consulate is housed in this
bu: ding. T-2 said that in view of this information he had
personally notified the Miami Police Department, who had
police officers waiting in front of the Pan American Building
before the demonstrators arrived there.

G. Qpen Letter By PRIO to BATISTA in June, 1'

The June 11, 1957, issue of the "Diario Las
Americas" set forth an open’letter by PRIO to BATISTA in
an article entitled "PRIO Would Accept Even a Military.
dunta if BATISTA Would Resign". This letter reads in part
as follows:

"For the first time since the treason of March
10, I write to you, impelled only be a sense of duty, for
thé purpose of indicating to you how necessary it is to
find a Solution which will solve the chaotic problem of
Cuba.

"There is a formula for immediately re-establishing
peace in Cuba. It is not very complicated. It consists,

merely of having you leave,

That alone would stop the heavy

flow of blood which is terrorizing the country,

"All the time you had has run out, and all the
doors for conciliation have already been closed. There will
never be peace so long.as you remain in power. There is
only enough time left for you to leave. I do not ask
you to leave, Isimply say to you: you are a father, too,
and it is the children of parents who are dying. It is
the fathers and the mothers and brothers and husbands and sons
who are crying in the silence of the Cuban nights, May
these words, uttered thus, reach the innermost recesses of

your conscience!

"Go away, BATISTA.

You_ are the obstacle. We

are all ready to accept even a Military Junta, composed of
the very men who are today under your command. Men like
CANTILLO, DIAZ TAMAYO, ROBAINA, RODRIGUEZ AVILA,

FERNANDEZ REY, DUENAS, DRIGGS GUERRA, LEON SANZ, COMESANAS,

HERNANDO HERNANDEZ, or like

so many others who appear by

your side, will be welcome to substitute for you and to

exhibit some inclination to

serve their country, It will

be enough for them to understand that the most important
thing is Cuba and the most noble mission at this time. is to
re-establish peace in our country. A junta which will respect

the constitution in all its

parts and will convoke general

elections in as brief a time as possible,

"I, who am a father, and who have my eyes and my
heart in Cuba, say these things to you without any political

ambition, The only thing I

desire is the happiness of Cuba

and the happiness of its children... In’ order to get them,
in order to have them become a reality, I promise to the
court of public opinion which is listening to us, to renounce

every political aspiration.

My mission will be fulfilled

the day you leave the government, whoever the substitutes
may be. I know that.on that day, happiness will return to
my people, and it will be possible for me to retire behind
the curtain of silence with the satisfaction of having

fulfilled my duty.

"You still have time. to do something noble. Go

away, BATISTA,

MM 2-165

principal speech, stated that he wanted to discuss the

unity of all Cubans. He announced that he accepts the unity
which had been presented and proposed by the Revolutionary
Directory and that he wanted the.leaders of all the anti-
BATISTA groups to do the same in order that they might discuss
the best formula. PRIO disclaimed any personal ambition to
office. He stated that he had not refused his cooperation
to the Cubans who had knocked at his door asking for help

Mockery of his Oath before a United States Court, BATISTA
Says". This article was date lined Havana, June 25, 1957,
and quoted President BATISTA of Cuba as stating "It’is
astonishing the manner in which PRIO has made a mockery of
the oath he took before a Federal Court which he
Pranised and swore that he would not conspire. He is doing
that openly today and a Miami newspaper affirms that;
although mention has not been made about who will be the
leader of that plotting movement, due to the form in which
PRIO expressed himself he results to be logically the one
selected."

Americas" carried an article entitled "BATISTA Is Trying
to Make the Rules for the United States - PRIO", This
article set forth PRIO's answer to BATISTA's allegation.
PRIO claimed that BATISTA is not satiSfied with being
dictator of Cuba but claimed that he is also trying to extend
his dictatorship to the United States, He alleged that
BATISTA is trying to usurp the authority of the North
American Officials who have the duty of determining whether
or not PRIO had violated his asylum by the speech which he .
had made at the Flagler Theatre. He claimed that BATISTA
is preparing in Cuba an atmosphere of animosity toward
the United States, and that BATISTA and his spokesmen
have systematically been accusing the opposition of trying
to get the mediation of Washington in Cuban affairs.

XIII. EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE UNITY AMONG
ANTI-BATISTA CUBAN POLITICAL
PARTIES

On October 2, 1957, Miami Informant T-5 reported
having received information in Cuba to the effect that a
series of con¥erences are being held in Miami between CARLOS
PRIO SOCARRAS, exiled former President of Cuba, and the
leaders of other anti-BATISTA political groups, for the. purpose
of achieving unity among Cuban revolutionary forces, T=5
said that within a week, according to his sources, these
Cuban political leaders plan to issue a manifesto pro-
claiming an agreement to establish a responsible government
in Cuba to guarantee property, lives, and investments;
and that they would then present this manifesto to the
United States State Department in Washington, D.C.

T-5 said that these Cuban political leaders were
reportedly working with JULES DU BOIS, of the International
American Press Association (IAPA).

T-5 said that among those reportedly attending
these conferences with PRIO are MANUEL BISBE, a leader of
the Orthodax Party; ANTONIO VARONA, leader of PRIO's Autentico
Party}; ROBERTO AGRAMONTE,who was a Presidential candidate
of the Orthodox Party in 1952, at which time elections were
not held; FELIPE PAZOS, a well known Cuban bank official
who had recently been-in the Sierra Maestra Mountains with
FIDEL CASTRO, leader of the July 26 Movements LINCOLN RODON,

IBANEZ and MANUEL PRENDES VARELA, whose identities were
unknown to T-5. T-5 said that FELIPE PAZOS was due to
arrive in Miami from Mexico on October 2, 1957.

On Oétober 3, 1957, Mr. JULES DU BOIS, Miami
representative of the *Chicago Tribune Press,” and who is
also chairman of the Freedom of the Press Committee of the
IAPA, furnished the following information:

On Saturday, September 28, 1957, having learned
that TONY VARONA, head of the Autentico Party of Cuba,
had just arrived in Miami, after having been allowed to
leave Cuba following his arrest there several days previously
by the BATISTA Government, Mr. DU BOIS went to the Columbus
Hotel-where he met VARONA as he was conferring with MANUEL
BISBE, President of the Orthodox Party faction, of which
ROBERTO AGRAMONTE and RAUL CHIBAS are members. VARONA was
telling BISBE of the need for unity among the political
parties opposed to BATISTA. }

On Monday, September 30, 1957, ROBERTO AGRAMONTE
came to see Mr. DU BOIS, stating that he wanted to thank
him for a recent newspaper article ‘written by Mr. DU BOIS
which mentioned AGRAMONTE “and CHIBAS. Me. DU BOIS said
that he then invited AGRAMONTE to have lunch with him and
suggested that they invite VARONA to join them. They then
proceeded to the Columbus Hotel where they found VARONA in
the lobby talking with CARLOS PRIO.-’PRIO referred to the
National Broadcasting Company television program of Sunday,
September 29, 1957, cdti8%sting of a televised interview of
FULGENCIO BATISTA by MARTIN AGRONSKY. PRIO said that. he
planned to ask the National Broadcasting Company for equal
time on a broadcast since BATISTA had attacked him personally
on Sunday's program, PRIO said that he did not believe that
he would be violating his parole with the Immigration and
Naturalization Service as he had told the Immigration and
Naturalization Service that he would make no public state~
ments unless personally attacked.

PRIO also remarked that he had just recently been
in New York City and Washington, D.C., and that many people
had questioned him about political unity.

Mr, DU BOIS said that after this discussion he then
took VARONA and AGRAMONTE: to lunch at the McAllister Hotel.,
VARONA told AGRAMCNTE the story of his arrest and his
interrogation by the Cuban police.

VARONA then told AGRAMONTE that he felt there was
a great need for the issuance of a declaration of unity by
the anti-BATISTA political authorities and he disclosed that
he had alréady talked to BISBE concerning this problem,
AGRAMONTE did not make any commitments. VARONA also men=
tioned that he had talked to EMILIO OCHOA, and later, on
October 3, 1957, VARONA told Mr. DU BOIS that OCHOA vas
ready to accept unity. OCHOA is the leader of one faction
of the Orthodox Party and presently resides in the Miami
area.

Mr, DU BOIS said that on Wednesday, October 2,
1957, BISBE, LINCOLN RODON, and another Cuban whose identity
he did not know, came to his office along with Professor
SALVADOR MASSIP, who had been Dean of Philosophy and Letters
at the University of Havana, and had just fled Guba follow.
ing efforts by the Cuban police to apprehend him. Mr. DU BOIS
said that RODON asked him if it would be permissible for the
anti-BATISTA political pa. es to have a committee represent-
ing them in a’ lobbying-ea; ify attend the IAPA conference
in Washington, D.C., which opens October 16, 1957. Mr.
DU BOIS said that he:told them they were free to do whatever
they wanted but that’his advice was "no". Mr. DU BOIS said
that he explained that. representatives of the Cuban press
will be in attendance at the conference and that press
representatives are certainly well informed concerning all
of the problems of their respective countries. Mr, DU BOIS
said that RODON and his companions said that they hoped to
obtain a declaration of unity and were awaiting the arrival
in Miami of Dr, FELIPE PAZOS from Mexico to confer with
them and the other political leaders concerning this declara-
tion of unity. They explained they hoped to have meetings
individually and collectively on this subject. When asked
by Mr. DU BOIS if they actually expected to achieve unity,
one of the party laughed.

Mr. DU BOIS said that FELIPE PAZOS is coming to
Miami as a direct representative of FIDEL CASTRO, and that
PAZOS has been in the Sierra Maestra Mountains with FIDEL
CASTRO, ROBERTO AGRAMONTE and RAUL CHIBAS.

Mr. DU BOIS said that the arrival in Miami of
TONY VARONA has given an impetus to unity talks, He said that
VARONA is considering going to New York City for the purpose
of talking to United States Ambassador to Cuba, the Honorable
EARL SMITH.

Mr. DU BOIS said that VARONA and his associates
plan to draw up some sort of a written document stipulating
that they have achieved unity, if such is accomplished.

Mr. DU BOIS said that they will undoubtedly publicize any
such document.

Mr. DU BOIS said that he asked VARONA if they plan
to request intervention by the United States Government and
VARONA replied in the negative. However, VARONA did say
that if sugar cane fields were set afire in Cuba; that under
no circumstances would he and his associates be able to con-
trol the situation; and that he felt the United States
Government would be interested.

On October 5, 1957, Mr. DU BOIS advised that he
had attended luncheon that afternoon at the Lighthouse

“Inn with PRIO,VARONA, RODON, PAZOS, a man named PRENDES and

another named MASSIP, the latter being a member of the
Orthodox Party. Mr. DU BOIS said that this was strictly
a social function in his own'honor, but that those Cubans
attending indicated that they were working on a statement
of principle to insure that choas would not ensue in Cuba
after BATISTA is put out of power. Mr. DU BOIS said that
PRIO did not appear to have any part in the drawing up of
this proposed statement of principle.

He said that PAZOS, while representing the July
26 Movement, indicated that he had received no instructions
from FIDEL CASTRO, but would sign the statement of principle
if he could do so’in keeping with the principles of FIDEL
CASTRO.

Mr. DU BOIS said that he received the impression
that unity has not yet been achieved between the parties:
represented at this meeting, that is the Autentico Party,
Orthodox Party, and the July 26 Movement. He received
the impression that AGRAMONTE and BISBE representing the
Orthodox Party ,did not want EMILIO OCHOA, who represents
one faction of the Orthodox Party,in on the matter. Mr.
DUBOIS said that VARONA of the Autentico Party remarked
that he could not understand why no one from the Revolutionary
Directory was represented at this meeting.

With regard to FELIPE PAZOS, T-17 reported on
October 14, 1957, that he attended a unitymeeting of the

July 26 Movement in Miami én October 10, 1957; that PAZOS was
the principal speaker and that it was the consensus of opinion
to many present that PAZOS would be the next President

of Cuba.

carried.an article entitled "Cuban Politicians Display
Unusual Activity This Weekend". This article reported
that several meetings had recently been held in Miami and
that the presence of PRIO at one of them and the presence
of the sisters, EMMA and LIDIA, of FIDEL CASTRO at the other
meeting brought comments from the whole Cuban Colony in
Miami. T-2 reported on May 31, 1957, that the sisters of

FIDEL CASTRO studiously avoided PRIO while they were in
Miami, indicating that they were not in sympathy with PRIO.

The June 10, 1957, issue of the "Miami Daily

News" ¢arried-an article entitted "Revolutionaries Here
Dis-United By-Feuds" by ‘staff writer JACK’ W. ROBERTS.
This Xrticle' disclosedthat there was a: fad-between the
Cuban ‘exiles backing CASTRO'S ‘revolutionary movement
and CARLOS PRIO SOCARRAS and it. pointed out that during.the
preceeding week when the CASTRO sisters staged a rally
at the Flagler Theatre in downtown Miami a> CASTRO
supporter got upon’ the stage and’ denounced’ all past regimes
in Cuba which naturally ‘included that. of! PRIO3‘:that when’
he started his tirade, the: PRIO supporters got up and
walked: out ofthe meeting

. On ay 22, 1957, ‘T-2 "stated that? he: had received
information froma ¢1036 associate of CARLOS PRIO;" that PRIO,
while outwardly claiming admiration of FIDEL CASTRO yas
inwardly plotting his destruction, T=2 said that according
to his: source’, PRIO: planned to: draw FIDEL CASTRO out of the
Sierra Maestra Mountains so that. FIDELCASTRO ‘could ‘be
eliminated by: the?Cuban Government and'that inorder to achieve
this aim, PRIO was planning ‘to Send help.to FIDEL to encourage
FIDEL to cdme out: into the open.’ T-2 said that according
to his source, PRIO'résents the fact that -FIDEL ‘CASTRO has
captured the imaginationof the Cuban people and has: become
the fiumberéne Hero -ofthe.anti-BATISTA populstion and tht
PRIO believes that if FIDEL is Kiled that he will then become

attorney who represénts’ some Cubans and who is :acqudinted
with PRIO had disclosed that PRIO desires to serve out the
remainder of his term, this being approximately six months,
but’ that if elections were held‘ in’ Cuba he would have no

said that his source said that PRIO then indicated that ite
would like to find someone to assassinate FIDEL CASTRO

XVI. PRIO and AURELIANO SANCHEZ ARANGO

It is to be recalled that previous investigation
had disclosed that.a AURELIANO SANCHEZ ARANGO heads the
Triple A, this being an underground anti-BATISTA organization;
and that SANCHEZ was formerly closely associated with PRIO
and formerly served as Minister of Education in PRIO's
cabinet.

On June 23, 1957, Engineer FELIX MARTINEZ spoke
at the unitymeeting which was held at the Flagler Theatre,
purporting to be representing the Triple A. As a result
of this meeting, there appeared in the July 6, 1957, issue
of the"Diario Las Americas" an article entitled "I Cannot
Accept Any Connection with PRIO, Declares SANCHEZ ARANGO",
In this article AURELIANO 3ANCHEZ ARANGO, Secretary General
of the Triple A, stated in”part "The National Democratic
front - Triplé~A’- cannot accept ties of any sort with Doctor
PRIO SOCARRASsince his attitude in 1955 and his trip to Cuba
where he deliberately sowed’ anarchy by destroying the
framework of the Revolutionary Movement.",...%It is not
our purpose to start a collateral firht now against Doctor
PRiO because all our energy is consumed by the task of
freeing the Cuban people from the monstrous dictatorship
of FULGENCIO BATISTA, But, for no reason can we consent fo
being used as a tool for the swindling manuever which
Doctor PRIO is carrying on to serve as a curtain of smoke
for the wicked farce which he*has set up with which he can
deceive for those who are very unwary."

"Diario Las Americas" article disclosed tha SANCHEZ’
letter had been delivered to that newspaper by FRANCISCO
CAYROL GARRIDO, representing 3ANCHEZ ARANCO, The letter
was dated Mexico, June 30, 1957.

The July 12, 1957, issue of the "Miami Herald"
reflected that FRANCISCO CAYROL, International Courier
for SANCHEZ ARANGO had been beaten up in Miami on the previous
Thursday by three unidentified Spanish speaking men; that
CAYROL did not report the incident to the police. The
article stated that PRIO was not available for comment.’

XVII. REPORTS OF ALLEGED PLANS TO
COMMIT SABOTAGE IN CUBA
On August 23, 1957, T-2 reported having received

information from an Informant who claimed that he had attended
a meeting with CARLOS PRIO and others on the night of

=e - ECRE

2346 °

| NW 64954 Docld:34517433 Page 150


MM 2-165

August 22, 1957, at which time PRIO allegedly gave instructions
HUMBERTO MURSULI y RODRIGUEZ and another Cuban named

MEDINA, both leaders of Cuban sugar mill workers to commit

acts of sabotage in Cuban sugar mills, the primary targets
being the Amazonas and San Francisco-Mills, both American
owned in Las Villas Province of Cuba, for the purpose of
arousing the United States against BATISTA.

On September 10, 1957, T-9 reported having
received information from Cuban exiles in Mexico who are
followers of CARLOS PRIO, that a wave of sabotage would
sweep over the entire land of Cuba after September 15,

1957; that the main objectives would be industries and
interprises in which a great deal of American money is
invested; namely, sugar cane fields, freight cars, telephone
installations, and gasolene stations. These interprises
would be sabotaged in an attempt to force the United

States Government to oust BATISTA from Cuba. GY

XVIII. REPORT RE RADIO

On September 5, 1957, T-9 advised having received
information from a source that CARLOS MARISTANY HERNANDEZ,
Cuban exiled follower of CARLOS PRIO, told a group of

Cuban exiles that Cuban Revolutionaries havea powerful

radio which operates on a frequency of 7750 kilocycles

and which is hidden in Miami, Florida. MARISTANY said

that the radio is operated or is set up by a person named \
MARGOLLES, (probably FERNANDO MARGOLLES, formerly reported).

On September 16, 1957, Mr. ARTHUR GILBERT,
Federal Communications Commission, Miami, advised that he
knew of no such radio transmitter operating at the present
time, but that he would immediately attempt to establish
whether or not such broadcasts were being made.

XIX. FINANCES

On October 16, 1957, Miami Informant T-19 advised
that the account of CARLOS PRIO SOCARRAS at the North Shore
Bank, Miami Beach has had a balance of only $40.00 since
September 23, 1957; that there has been no appreciable
nor significant activity on his account since April, 19573

“and that PRIO has apparently transferred his banking to
another institution unknown to T-19.
