Castro) of AMLASH-1, AMWHIP-1 was told we were loosing into

b. In discussing CUHOPS' desire to cooperate, AMWHIP
stated that QUHOPS would do what he could to help but that
in exchange for this he wanted to get his wife, two children,
and bis mother-in-iaw to the United States along with higse!?f.
AMNHIP-1 stated that QUHOPS' plan in brief was to accept
the guard duty on Sunday thus maxing probably only hinself
and the wife of code clur: present in the embassy. Ve
thanzed AMWHIP for his information and suggestions and
stated that they would be conveyed to the appropriate parties

concerned.

@. Gustavo GONZALES. (AMLASH-1's “cousin") AMWHIP-1
stated that he had no Information on Gonzales, in whom
Nestor Sanchez has an operational interest with regard to his
(Sanchez') pending PCS to Caracas, Venezuela.

d. “Venezuelan” Returning from Moscow. Regarding the
Venezuelan who has reportedly to have just come from Yoscow
and returning to Cuba, AM@HIP-1 stated that he had no
information to contribute about the man. He did say, however,
that one time during his recent trip to the Cuban Embassy
Paris talking with UNSNAFU-19, the Ambassador had interrupted
their conversation in order to tal< to two men (about 30-35
years old). AMWHIP-1 met them briefly and was told by one
of thes that they were from Oriente Province AMWHIP=1
stated that he could tell immed: ly by their accents
that they were not Cuban. In order to confirm this he
asked them where in Oriente they were from because one of the
Cuban officials in Paris was from Oriente and always wanted
to chat with any people from Oriente who passed through Paris.
After a brief stumbling exercise, groping for a name of a
city in Oriente, the "Cuban" confessed that they were not
Cubans but Venezuelans. AMWHIP did not have suffident tine
to learn more about them. The two Yenezuelans spent about
thirty minutes talking with UNSNAFU-19 while AMWHIP was there.
He did not know how much longer previous to this thirty
minutes that the Venexuelans had been in the Embassy or to vhom
ise they talked. AMMHIP-1 suggested that UNSNAFU-9 might
be able to obtain the names of the two Venezuelans in question.

©. UNSNAFU=19's Membership in the “Gaslight Club".

* As a support service for a Paris Station operation to get
UNSNAFU-19 membership in the Gaslight Club where it would be
attempted to run a highly desirable female agent against him.
AMLASH-1 stated that he had been unable, due to UNSNAFU-19's
busy schedule, to get the latter down to the Gaslight Club
and enrolled as a vember. AMWHIP stated, however, that be
could do the job just as well by taxing out a gift membership
for UNSNAFU-19 through the slight Club in New Yor« City,
and sending UNSNAFU-19's membership card and <ey to hia in
Paris. We encouraged AMWHIP-1 to do this and to xeep us
advised of his progress. a

£. Cuban Air Force Comandante DteLeisy Regarding
| DICLOIS who had allegedly arrived in Yaris from Algeria during
the time that Sanchez and AMWHIP-1 were there, AMHHIP-1 said
| that he did not know the man or did he have any information on
| @ Comandante with that name or a name that sounded lise that.

G. Security man with Che Guevara. AMWEIP-1 was

. asked if he had any Information on a man calied “Bernie”
iportedly one of the men who accompanied Che Guevara on his
ican trip, and probably also the one to China as 8 member of
his security force. AMWHIP said that the name did not register
with him and he had no other information to give. He again
i<,o suggested that AMLASH-1 might be able to help. One thing more
Y AMBEIP. eaid.wag that he did not thinx that any of Che's security

a\ men were named Bernis, and he thought this was not a correct

y name. He did say, however, that while he was in Paris there had

: ° been two security types there who were guarding two or three

\W" dark green trunis about the size of foot locxers and four or
4 five suitcases. AMWHIP said that they both had Pistols, one a
Soviet machine pistol and the other a 32 calibre. AMWHIP does not
remember the exact date that they left Paris for Madrid but he
remembers that the flight left at 4:50 im the afternoon and
took place about two weeks ago (ca. 5 February). AMWHIP says that
UNSHAFU-9 knows both of these men and could be contacted for their
names and a better description.

h. Carlos Frangui. AMWHIP-1 had no additional
~iefernetica on Franqui except to say that he cnew he was not
happy. He also believed that AMLASH-1 had additional information
on Franqui. : _- ‘i

i. B & L Locomotives. with regard to the requirements:
concerning secukity measures on the shipeent of locouotives to
Cuba, AMWHIP said that he had no additional information to

“~~ contribute. AMWHIP also stated that he had obtained no additional
information frou FISSOLA, the engineer concerned with the shipment,,
to, and the use of, these locomotives. AMWHIP stated that he
thought AMLASH-1 might have some additional information. AMWHIP
also stated that he thought “Americo” tals too much and that
maybe "Mario" would be best to assist in the operation.

J- AMLASH-1's Accommodation Addi eaants.
AWIHIP-1 stated that be bad reviewed acc ‘addresses
with AMLASH-1 and bad given appropriate instructions to
AUNHIP-2 in the event of the receipt of letters fron
Havana signed by AMLASH-1 or signed by a “Cuban” whoa
AMMEHIP-2 did not know. (Comment: it was a good thing ve
reviewed accommodation address with AMWHIP-1, see below.)
For the record AMLASH~1 will address his letters to AMWHIP-2
either in care of bis business address in Rome which is:

Cavaliere Hilton
Jewelry Shop
Monte Mario
Roma

or to AMVEIPLS's business address in Geneva (which incidentally

“4g identical with his home address, as AM¥HIP-2 opera in
Geneva from his apartment): Rue Crespin, Geneva, Switzerland.
(It should be noted that AMWHIP-2 intends to open a proper
office in Geneva in the near future. However, this is no
particular reason for changing the accommodation address in
Genova.) AMWHIP-% stated that he had given the undersigned's
Postoffice box in Washington (William A. Thompson, P.O.

° Box 7224,Apox Station, Washington, D.C. to AMMHIP-2, believing
that this would’ expedite our receipt of letters from AMLASH-1.
AMIHIP-l was told that bis concern for rapid transaittal of

aay “the letters was certainly appreciated, but that for security
sake, it was much better that they be forvarded in a cover
envelope to AMVHIP's address in New Yorx City, pretorably,
his business address. AMNHIP'- was also told to remind
AKYEIP-2 that he ¢hould handle the letters he received from

; Havana as little as possible and put them in cover envelopes 4

te and send them as quiccly as possible to AMWHIP-1 in New Yor< :

City. In this connection it resains the problem of obtaining A

|
|

these letters on a expeditious basis when AMWHIP-1 is, for B
example, out of town for a prolonged absence. It.is ie i
suggested that William Thompson's accommodation business 4
in Washington be given to AMWHIP's father So that he aay

forward AHWHIP-2's letters to Washington without undue delay.

(This is an excellent example of a brea<down in cozpartmentation

in Cuban operations.)

k. Paris Embassy Personnel. According to a telephone
all on 18 February from AWLASH-I in Paris, AMWHIP-1 stated
that AMLASH~1 had said that UNSNAFU-8 and, perhaps, UXSKAFU-9
Would be out of jobs in the near future in accordance with
the present economy drive by the Cubans. AMLASH stated that
UNSNAFU-8 most certainly would be ousted, while UNSNAFU-9's
case was more uncertain.

“I. Cuban Government Financial Straits. (Ref.
PARI 9067, IN 73872, 4 February 65) ASYWHIP-I added some
additional comments on the silver payments cited in ref.
AMWHIP#l stated that the Cubars were apparently very anxious
to sell the silver cited in Ref. Actually AMWHIP-1
stated that the total anount of the payments would be in
the neighborhood of $350,000 and this included antiques,
postage stanps, silver bullion, and “wor<ed" silver articles.
AMUHIP alsotgtated that he kad been assed if he would
be willing/buy $100,000 worth of silver on the pot, the
cash to be placed in a reputable international ban«.
This discussion had been carried on by international telephone
with Pepin Sanchez, brother-in-law of Celia Sanchez, and Jose
Iglesias Lopez, good friend of AMMHIP=1 and former Havana
Jeweler. AMWHIP-1 talxed to the above in Havana from the Cuban
Embassy, Paris. This $100,000 was a part of the total $350,000
mentioned above. AMWHIP-1 turned down the sale, stating that
he did not normally deal in silver, and was not sure of the
values of the vorked items offered for sale. AMWHIP-1 stated
that this sale vas to be executed on behalf of Castro
personally and did not necessarily reflect the overall
financial picture of the Cuban government. AMWHIP-1 stated
that AMLASH-1 had told him that such an action was typical
of Castro, who in many instances, conducted business
arrangersates of his own, without regard or without consultation,
with the members of his governsent normally involved in Cuban
national finances. AMHIP-1 stated that UNSNAFU-19 also had
intimated the above. AMMHIP-1 stated that he believed that
this money was needed for the downpayment on two factories
which had been purchased by the Cubans in Great Britain.
He also stated that he believed these factories were for
the processing of agricultural products of some type. Also,
concerning the silver, according to AMWHIP-1, that 30% had
been reduced to bullion and that the rest consisted of “wor<ed"
silver articles (antiques, art treasures, jewelry, otc.)
AMIHIP stated that this entire offering of silver antiques, etc.
had eventually been sold on the spot in Havana for cash to
@n unknown person of Turcish/Itaiian bac«ground. AMYHIP
tried to find out the identity of the person but neither
UNSNAFU-19, in person, nor Iglesias, by phone, would
j Feveal the identity of the buyer. AMWHIP-1 offered to write
or as< Iglesias for the name, but we cautioned against it
as shoving undue interest in the matter, AMWHIP-1 was told
“that 1f he ever saw Izlesias in person and could safely asc
him he should do so together with any details he could
obtain about the transaction, as it was related to Cuban
financial problens. AiM#HIP-{ stated that on his return to

the Paris Ambessador's conference in Madrid, UNSNAFU-19 carried
@ very large trunx in his car. It was so heavy that the rear of
the car was clearly weighted-down. AMWHIP Bpeculated that this
trunk had been brought to Madrid by Arnold RODRIGUEZ Camps and
was turned over to UNSNAPU-19 prior to the latter's return to
Paris. in connection with this, AMWHIP-) received @ phone call
from AMLASH-1 from Paris stating that UNSNAFU-19 was woing to
Geneva on the 18th of February and had invited AMLASH-1.
AMLASH~1 declined the invitation, due to his desire to return to
Havana vio Madrid on the 23rd of this month. On the morning of
the 19th of February AMWIP-1 received a call fros AMWHIP-2
stating that UNSNAFU-19 was driving to Geneva on the 19th. He
had with him some $11,000 in silver articles. AIHIP-2, who saw
the items, said that the “stuff was cheap" (meaning inferior
workmanship and quality).

m. AMLASH-1, Morale and Finances. We then broached the
topic of Al Ba and present frame of mind after our
refusal to give him $10,000 that he requested for operational
uses. AMWHIP=] stated that he thought AMLASH-1 vas not overly
disturbed by this, but that in general he was somewhat upset by
the fact that he had even entered into negotiations with AMBIDDY-1,
objecting to his “political mentality". It might be noted that
AMVHIP~1 also stated his reservations about AMBIDDY-1. Frou
this, we derived the feeling that AMLASH-1 and AMWHIP-1 both
had strong but unspecified reservations about the motivation and
morality of AMBIDDY-1. AMLASH said that due to this reservation
Of AMLASH-1's, and due to the relative newness of the contact,
AMLASH-) was extremely reluctant to taxe any money from AMBIDDY-1,

_Which, of course, in the end he did not. AMWHIP-1 stated that
AMLASH folt that he had been pushed by the Americans into a
basically unwanted relationship with AMBIDDY-1. ALWHIP-1 stated
that he, as well as AMLASH-1 were still baffled at the American
reluctance to deal across the board on all matters with
AMLASH-1. He stated that AMLASH-1 had received certain items
from AMBIDDY-1 that he was not able to obtain from the Americans.
AWIHIP-1 made it a point to state that AMLASH-1 noted immediately
and pointedly that the items provided to hin by AMBIDDY-1 vere
not homerade nor apparently one-of-<ind items. (the inference here
being quite clearly conveyed to the unders gned was that these
items obviously came from commercial source

n. The Subject of the Funds Requested by AMLASH. AMOEIP
stated that these wore absolutely necessary Yor AULASH to seep

involving only AMWHIP, He felt that he could be more effective
with continuous guidance and direction during his European
sojourns. (AMWHIP also implied that the case officers were
understandably busy with their many local probiems and could
not devote as much time as possibly was desirable to AMWHIP-1's
case. On the other hand, AMWHIP=1 delicately submitted that

if he was willing to tase the tine for the operations, and if
in fact they were worthwhile and necessary, we should make
every reasonable effort to glean the most benefit from his
efforts. In summary, if feasible, he prefers to deal with one
case officer on all aspects of his operational activity.

AMLASH~1, According to AMWHIP-1, he and AMLASH-1 have
established an open code for signalling his desire for exfiltration
or to inform AMWHIP-1 when the date of his Attempt will be.
Exfiltration involves the use of birthday greetings to Loretta

respectively. AMBIDDY-1 presumably has the details for execution

P. Deception Ploy (Rumor plant with UNSNAFU-19) .
Ia response eo request for bis opfaloa this subject

‘after it had been outlined as agreed upon at Headquarters,

AMIHIP-1 stated that he thought that he could carry this off
without UNSKAFU-19 being Suspicious. He stated that this type
of information would have to coue forth at the right moment in
a@ natural manner, and during a rather lengthy personal meeting.
He felt that to do this by telephone or letter would be totally
out of keeping with his normal rélationship with UNSNAFU-19
and that it should not be done in that manner. In response to
the suggestion, hovever, he said that it could be done if his
stopping off in Paris to see UNSNAFU-19 too’ place as a part of
& normal business trip to Europe. He also stated that he felt
he had to have sowething upon which to peg the story. AMWHIP=<1
agreed with the feasibility of the Buggestion of putting him in
touch with a reputable businessman in New Yorx, who has good
connections in Governsent circles in Washington and whom he
conceivably could have xnown for some time as a result of a
normal business relationship. AXWHIP-1 agreed to return to
Burope in wo or three weexs especially to perford this tas<.
He was in agreement with the undersigned's idea that, in order
to play it as safely as possible, this meeting with UNSNAFU-19
Should not taxe place at least until after the 24th of February,
the expected return date of AMLASH-1 to Havana. Both. for this

made for him to «ow about, or actually to meet, the ostensible
souree of this information in New Yor< sometime during the last
week of February or the first weex of March. He waa told also
to xeep in touch with the undersigned in the event of any
