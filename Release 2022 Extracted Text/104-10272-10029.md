four GOP members. “The life of the
committee still hangs by a slim:

in a television appearance last week,

Waller called attention to Jack Anderson's column in today's

note that the House Committee on Assassinations has, as a matter of
practice, elected to leak information that we are apt to be called
upon to clarify. Later in the meeting, Miller noted that Chairman
Stokes has indicated that he is prepared to receive a briefing from
us on procedures for the handling of sensitive material, security
clearances, etc., similar to those worked out with the SSCI.

that Ray “was the assassin and that he

House investigators, however, have
challenged the Justice Department's
findings. In a confidential, 16page

Jack Anderson andLes Whitten -
JFK Data Quashed, Memo Says

A confidential House memo accuses
the FBI and CIA of “a serious suppres-
sion of evidence which was vital to this
country’s investigation” of the 1963 as-
sassination of President Kennedy.

A House Assassinations subcommit-
tee “has uncovered a good deal of in-
formation which suggests that Lee
Harvey Oswald was associated with
one or both of these grganizations,”
the memo says.

It charges bluntly “that both the CIA
and FBI intentionally withheld rele-
vant Information from the Warren
Commission and In at least one in-
stance, provided the commission with
information known to be false.”

The memo accuses the FBI of with-
holding 23 Oswald files from the com-
mission. The FBI “was in possession of
69 pre-assassination files.on Lee Har-
vey Oswald,” states the memo. “How-

ever, of these files, only 46 were

turned over to the commission.”

‘The information that allegedly was
withheld was contradictory. On one
hand, the CIA suppressed facts sugg-
esting that Cuba's Fidel Castro may
have retaliated against President Ken-
nedy after learning about the CIA's
plot against his own life. But on the
other hand, the CIA allegedly covered
up evidence linking Oswald to CIA-
sponsored, anti-Castro Cubans.

‘The House memo draws no conclu-
sion about the Kennedy killing. But it
lays out the evidence that the commit-
tee has gathered thus far. Here are the

bight ts

* The CIA did not disclose to the
Warren Commission that it iad been
brig, Hod knock off Fidel Castro at the
time Kennedy was shot. Killers from

the Havana underworld, controlled by
mobster Santos Trafficante, were used.
in the plot against the Cuban premier.
The mobster who directed the.attempt
on Castro's life, John Roselil, hinted
privately that the same killers had

een caught by Castro and had been
turned against Kennedy. Interestingly
enough, a Cuban exile, according to
the memo, quoted Trafficante as say-
Ing “that Kennedy was going to be

“bit”

© Roselli had also suggested that the
mob had ordered Jack Ruby to kill Os-
wald to prevent any disclosure of the
‘Trafficante connection. One of Ruby's
underworld associates, the memo re-
ports, “Indicates that in 1959 Jack

luby traveled to Cuba and visited
Santos Trafficante in jail.” The same
source also reported that “Ruby and
Roselll had meetings in Miami several
months prior to the assassination.”

¢ A witness had told committee in-
vestigators that Ruby introduced her
to Oswald at a Dallas nightclub two
weeks before the assassination. She
“had been afraid to come forth with
her Information,” according to the
memo, because another woman disap-
peared after she mentioned seeing Os-
wald at Ruby's nightclub. But the Iong-
Hel witness “is now willing to tes-
tity.”
¢ The Warren Commission met be-
hind closed doors on Jan. 27, 1964, to
discuss “evidence” that Oswald had
been a $200-a-month FBI informant up
to the time of the assassination. The
evidence came from two “indepen-
dent” and “rellable” sources. The com-
mission's general counsel, J. Lee Ran-
kin,.took ‘this up with the late FBI di-

rector J. Edgar Hoover, who categorl:
cally denied any relationship between
Oswald and the FBI. Reports the
memo: "The Warren Commission de-
cided that rather than embarrass J. !
Edgar Hoover and the FBI they would:
not pursue the evidence.” iis

.°¢ A Dallas woman, named Sylvia}
Odio, reported that she had been vis-!
ited by anti-Castro Cubans. They Intro-;
duced her to an American, whom she:
Jater recognized as Oswald. The Cu-
bans told her that the American was,
trying to persuade anti-Castro groups:
“to kill President Kennedy becaure of-
Kennedy's reaction to the Bay of Pigs:
invasion.” Not long afterward, Ken-
nedy was shot. But the FBI mis-
represented the woman's story to the |
Warren Commission, the memo alle-
Bes. This report "of what the bureau

new to be patently false,” declares
the memo, “requires further Investiga..
tion.”

¢ The memo cites Photographs and
stories linking Oswald to members of a
paramilitary, anti-Castro unit known
as the “No Name Key Group.” Some of
the photos show “CIA agents assigned
to train the Cuban exiles and soldiers
of fortune.” Some members of the
group were traced to Dallas shortly be-
fore the Kennedy assassination. «

Kelley has told us that all 69 summa-
ries were provided to the commission.

Odd CIA Activity in Dallas in 1963 —

The secret files of the House Assas-
sinations Committee contain reports of
strange CIA activities in Dallas on the
tid of the John F. Kennedy assassina-
Uon.

Credible witnesses have confirmed
our past reports that the accused assas?
sin, Lee Harvey Oswald, was in touch’
with antl-Castro Cubans In Dallas. One
coridential report states that “in 1963,
Oswald was seen leaving the Dallas of-
fice of Alpha 68.” This was a Cuban
sommando group trained by the CLA.

‘A Cuban CIA operative, Antonio Ve-
ciana, also told investigators that he
had been summoned to Dallas in Au-
gust 1969, by his CLA contact—a myste-

ricus man who went by the name of ;

Morris Bishop. States a confidential
summary: “When (Veciana) arrived,
Bishop was.accompanied by another
maa, Lee Harvey Oswald.”

Another witness who impressed the
investigators, Sylvia Odio, told them
that two antiCastro Cubans had Intro-
duced her to an American by the name
ot Leon Oswald. She was told that Os-
wald was trying “to convince anti-
Castco Cuban groups. . .to kill Presi-
dent Kennedy.” After the assassina-
‘on. she recognized this American as
Lee Harvey Oswald.

The House Investigators don't really
believe that the CIA had any part In
tbe murder of President Kennedy.
More likely, they suspect the CLA may
have Urled to cover up some embar-
rassing contacts with Oswald in Dallas.

In any case, the CIA took pains to
give the Impression that Oswald was In
Mexico City at the tne that witnesses
claimed be was dealing with the CLA-
guided Cubans In Dallas. Veciana, for
ple, told of a strange call he re-

celved from his CIA contact after Ken-
nedy was killed.

‘The CIA man, Morris Bishop, asked
Veclana to contact his cousin, Buil-
Jamo Rulez, who worked for the Cuban
embassy In Mexico City. Relates a con-
(dential report: “Veclana was to relay
Bishop's offer to pay Rulez and bis
wife to say that they had met with Os-
wald in Mexico City.”

This not only would have placed Os-
wald out of Dallas but would have
thrown suspicion on the Castro gov-
ernment. The ruse was later called off.
Instead, the CIA cited secret tapes and.
photographs as evidence that Oswald

ad been In touch with both the Cuban:
and Soviet embassies in Mexico City. _

‘The CLA kept tapes of all phone caiis
“golns in and out of the two embassies.

hotographs were also taken of every-
one entering and leaving these embas-
“sles. On Oct. 1, 1963, the CJA notified
other U.S. embassies that “an Amerl-
cap male, who identified himself as
Lee Oswald, contacted the Soviet Em-
bassy in Mexico City.” i:

Oswald was described In the cable as.
“approximately 35 years old, with an
athletic build, about six feet tall, with
a receding hairline.” The committee
files note that this “In no way phys!-
cally resembles the Lee Harvey O3-

« wald accused of assassinating uae
dent Kenoedy.” 7
‘The CIA sought photographs from
the navy to compare with its pho-
tographs of Oswald at the Soviet em-
bassy. Declares a committee report:
"These photographs, though obviously
not of the correct Lee lirvey Oswald,
became the Warren Commission's ex-
hibit 237, The CIA admitted that there

had been a mix-up but never cleared |
the matter up.”

A CIA witness has told committee In-
vestigators, meanwhile, that the CIA’s
monttoring camera happened to break
down on the day that Oswald allegedly
visited the Soviet Embassy. But the
CIA tap on the Soviet Embassy's phone

roduced an alleged telephone call
From someone who Identified himself
as "Lee Henry Oswald.”

‘The CIA witness claimed that the ac-
tual voice recording of the telephone
conversation "was destroyed In rou-
tine destruction procedures approxi-
mately one week after it was re-
ceived.” Yet more than seven weeks
later, the FBI claimed to have heard
the telephone conversation that the
CIA said had been destroyed. ‘Tho
FBI's judgment was that the voice did
not belong to Oswald.

Wrote the late FBI director J. Edgar
Hoover on Nov. 23, 1063: “The Ceotral
Intelligence Agency advised that on
Oct. 1, 1963, an extremely sensitive
source had reported that an individual
Indenti(led himself as Lee Oswald,
who contacted the Soviet Embassy In
Mexico City Inquiring as to any messa-

ges.

“Special agents of thls bureau, who
have conversed with Oswald In Dallas,
Tex. have observed photographs of
the Individual referred to above and
have listened to a recording of his
volce. These special ‘agents are of the
opinion that the abovereferred-to in-
dividual was not Lee Harvey Oswald”

‘The House Investigators are begin-
ning to wonder whelber the CIA con-
cocted the whole Oswald adventure tn
Mexico City in an attempt to conceal
Als real activities In Dallas.

Behind the Bureaucratic Detente

The top brass of the Justice Depart-
ment's Antitrust Division and the In-
terstate Commerce Commission got to-
gether in the back rooms the other day-
to discuss their mutual animosities. Ev-
eryone shook hands and, immediately
atierward, the antitrust officials began’
pulling their punches to spare the ICC
{rom embarrassment. ts

Here are the fascinating events thal
led lo the detente between the two bu-
reaucratic baronies. a +

‘The ICC's reluctant regulators had
been fuming over some slinging criti-
cism from the Justice Department's
trustbusters. The Antitrust Division
uncharitably had blasted the ICC for
several anti-consumer decisions.- _

‘This stirred the ICC’s new boss, A.
Daniel O'Neal, to seek a peace confer-
ence with the Justice Department's
acting antitrust chief, John Shene-
field. They sat down together behind
closed doors, each attended by aldes.

An O'Neal aide asked the antitrust

officials, please, to stop Issuing “cbeap- .

shot press releases” against the ICC.
O'Neal put it more delicately: with ap-
parent sincerity, be offered to incorpo-
rate more antitrust philosophy Into
ICC decisions, . °.,

By all accounts, the trustbusters
were so overcome by O'Neal’s coopera-
tive attitude that they rushed out and
reversed an earlier decision to chal-
lenge another ICC ruling. ~~.

‘This was a ruling to deny a small bus
company; Latin Express Service, the
right to provide limited service be-
tween Miami, Fla., and Union Cily, N.J.
‘The company wanted to serve Spanish-
speaking travelers who have difficulty
on Greybound and Trailways buses.

‘supposed to encourage competition, -
objected to the ridiculous ruling. One
fuming antitrust official calicd it “so
outrageous as to boggle the mind.” It
was absurd, he sail, “to (hink Latin
Express could have diverted enough
revenue from Greyhound or Trail-
ways” to endanger them. -

. The Antitrust Division, therefore,
decided to challenge the ICC decision, :
and another sharp statement was star-

ted through the bureaucratic machin- -

ery. But then the trustbusters, basking
in the .warm glow of their. mecting
with O'Neal, changed their, minds
‘about the Latin Express case. © -

A spokesman acknowledged, quile
candidly, that the antitrust chiefs
didn’t want to attack the ICC so soon

after the truce with O'Neal. So the
spirit of detente prevailed. «+ it

Unfortunately for O'Neal's sensibili-
ties, however, the top trustbusters for-
-got to tell the press office, about their
change of heart. The unwitting press
office, therefore, issued another blis-
tering release. =~ sagt

“For the second time in two
Months,” declared the embarrassing
release, “the Department of Justice

. has challenged an ICC decision deny-
ing a small bus company authority to
provide new Intercily service.” “""

The relcase quotes the antitrust
chief, Joe Sims, as proclaiming: “The

commission's decision points up the
Impossible burden placed on new ap-
plicants for motor carrier operating
authorily by the ICC, even when the
proposed service Is highly spectalized
and the applicant is very small.”

The only trouble with the press re-
Tease was that the ICC ruling was not
challenged as advertised and the deci-
sion to drop the challenge was made

FBI Documents on JFK Killing Raise
Questions on Bullets, Oswald’s Moves

{ .by Margaret AsGentry
: ‘Asrotiated Prost

Newly disclosed FBI documents on
thé assassination of Johni F. Kennedy
raife, but do not answer, questions
abbut. Lee Harvey Oswald's move-~
mehts in the days before Dallas, and
abdut the source of the bullets that
killed the President.

The 597 pages of documents are the
firft of more than 40,000 the FBI will
reltase Dee. 7 to comply with requests
uniler the Freedom of Information
Ac} for its material on the investiga-
top bf Kennedy's death in Dallas on
Nok. 22, 1963.

The: first three volumes were pro-
vided to a private researcher several .

months ago and were made available
yesterday to the Associated Press,

The documents, many heavily cen-
sored, show that the FBI attempted
to trace the fatal bullets from the
time they were manufactuyed until
they reached the assassin's hands.

Agents initially were perplexed by
a piece of evidence they found.

The bullets were  6.5-millimeter
Mannlicher-Carcano ammunition.
Agents determined that the manufac-
{urer was the Western Cartridge Corp.
of East Alton, JI.

Agents in Illinois examined the
company's production records and
found that the firm produced 4 million
rounds of this type of ammunition for

the U.S. Marine Corps in 1954,

a

“The interesting thing about this
order js that it Js for ammunition
which does not fit and cannot he
fired in any of the USMC weapons,”
sald an FBI memo dated Dec. 2, 1963.

“This gives rise to the obvious spec:
ulation that it Is a contract for am-
munition placed by CIA with Western
under a USMC cover for concealment
purposes,” the memo continued.

In other words, FBI officials spec-
ulated that the CIA was using the
Marine Corps as a cover to purchase
ammunttion In secret.

A’ memo written at FBI headquar:
ters the next day noted that the
George Zucker Sales Co. of Chicago
had purchased about 2 miilton round:
for commercial resale in 1962.

Jn the first batch of files released.
these were the only two memos deal
ing with the ammunition. The materi:
al said nothing more to explain or
resolve the agents’ speculation. Nor
was Jt known whether the files to be
released next week, and another 40.
00 pages duc later, would shed mort
Jight on the question.

The Warren Commission investigal
ed the assassination and concluded
that Oswald, acting alone, killec!
Kennedy, The commission reported
that thls type of ammunillon “ts
Tendily availnble for purchase fron
imail order houses as well as a fev:
gun shops.” It noted that “some °
mnillton rounds have been placed on
sale in the United States.”

The records showed that the FBI
kept close watch and a voluminous
file on Oswald from his defection to
the Soviet Union in October, 1951.
and after he returned to the Uniled
States in June, 1962,

But the bureau lost track of him
for several wecks in September anid
October, 1963, and agents jn Dallas.
Lille Rock and New Orleans were
put on alert to loeate him and his
Russian-born wife, Marina.
