On 4 Oct 57, Pte ROBERTS made his successful bid to return

to the WEST.

He did NOT tell his wife of his intention and when

she returned home

from work, she assumed he had left for WEST

Subject stated that several such discussions had taken place and

her arguments against escape to the WEST were always the same.

On 9 Oct 57, she received a letter from her husband telling

her that he had reached WEST BERLIN and surrendered himself to the

BRITISH military authorities.

On about 1 Nov 57, subject received

another letter from Pte ROBERTS, dated 18 or 19 Oct 57, asking her

to visit him in BERLIN-SPANDAU on 29 Oct 57.

On 1 Nov 57, she travelled to BERLIN from BAUTZEN by the

recently-introduced

omnibus service.

She had been given an

address in EAST BERLIN by Doris MULLER (now the wife of. the BRITISH

defector 23247530 Pte McLANE, W., 1 BW

She discussed this

15.

Interrogator's opinion of subiact.

She is of

average

intelligence and appeared

to

be a fairly shrewd sort of person.

From what we have already heard of her, and from her own story,

she would appear to have mediocre moral standards.

She undoubtedly

knew a lot about the defector colony in BAUTZEN, but did not volunteer

information until she began to appreciate

that the interrogator had

a sound background knowledge of events in BAUTZEN.

On some occasions

she inadverdently disclosed items of knowledge which showed

she knew

more than she had previously said.

When taxed with these 'slips of

the tongue',

she replied

that they had occured to her as afterthoughts.

In view of her present circumstances she, naturally,

endeavoured to

create

the impression

of a person who had nothing to hide

and who wag

willing

to co-operate.

In spite of this, or perhaps becsuse of it,

she did not make a good impression and there appeared to be

an

intangable

air of doubt and mistrust about her and it is considered

that no great reliance

can be placed on her.

The information she

gave on BRITISH defectors (Annexure I refers) is thought to be

generally reliable.

Her alleged activities as an informant in BAUTZEN

may have been exaggerated by returned defectors, but it is considered

that, at least,

if

she heard of escape plans by defectors which

Involved

her husband

she

did inform SCHATTEL, in erder not to

jeopardise her own personal security and way of life with her husband,

para 5 above also refers.

This may well have been an additional

reason why Pte ROBERTS did not tell his wife of his intended escape

attempt on 4 Oct 57, even taking into consideration the criminal

aspect of his reasons, para 45 of ref 'A' refers.
