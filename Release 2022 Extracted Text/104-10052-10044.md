Svoject: Background on Mexico Station Support Assets
(Coverage of Soviet and Cuban Embassies)

1. (Uablaterat Jooverage. From the time the Mexico Station was opened in

as Bin) ) (oy Bill Doyle) until arrival of Win Scott as COS in 1958, Charles
Anderson IIT (still in LA/HQ) had developed a support apparatus to 2am
exploit leads from the Soviet Fubassy, This umbrella type project (LIFEAT)

consisted of milti line phone taps,(three photo sites,)a mobile surveillance

team and a mail intercept operation.

a. Fhone taps were placed/by i Sapleyes Of the telerhone company \

Se Aas
tapped was limted by availability of a listening post nearby

(since the taps were not made in the main central) and English/
Spanish (Soviet, Polish, Czech, etc) transcribers. Generally 7
these agents (mostly Mexican or Mexican American) were related ;
(which the station et that time felt was good security in that

4f they talked about’ shop, they would talk to each other.)

of Harry Mahoney (retired, living in Chicago) and TDY TSD

devices, These kad sub-cripts under LIFEAT (LIMITED, LILYRIC,

that block, LIMITED was the first base ard it operated strictly on an

er!

atcl basis in the early stages, I think the Mexi Station bought

one storey
this property (e/Sranish Colonial stone house) through LIMOUSINE (check to
be sure), Later this house began to fall apart, This base was closed when
the Station got word thet the photo of "uniden man" was being released to the
public by the Warren Cosmission. The photo operators were moved to another apt
neerby. The property was sold (under an operational agreement with LIMOUSINE
for a long term lease on the top floor of a new apartment blding to te built
on this site). © LILYRIC was planned as an alternate photo base to LIMITED,
It was in an upper storey (3rd floor -check) on the sane side of the street
as LIMITED but. in the middle of the block South. It had a slanted view of

the front gate of the Soviet Embassy, The agents in LIQTED and LILYRIC (both
Vexican fanilies) as far as we knev, were not acquainted with each other.

LILYRIC was a rented apartment. LICALLA, the third photo site, was located

one of a row of four houses on the South side of the Soviet Exbassy compound
which the Mexico Stetion purchased in about 1958 (check date), also using
LIMOUSINE as the purchaser (check), This site overlooked the back garden of

the Soviet Enbassy compound. The purpose of this operation was to get good
identification photographs of the Soviet personnel (vho at thet time were largely
unidentified in Mexico Station records), The three photo sites were handled by
ary level at )

was run out of another ohe of these houses (crypt for the four-houses vas
LEUST/1, etc). This was handled by Glen WIDDEN (outside TSD officer) and
Yahoney using HQ TDY teams for monitoring. This operation ves also separate

from LICALLA. The two houses in between were rented to unsuspecting tenants.

¢. Nobile surveillance wes developed by Anderson and later placed

under Makoney and Joseph Sancho, This team consisted of a half

dozen or so agents ‘who used three to four lete model cars end a

panel truck (which could be used on stake_outs for photo covera::e).

The plan was to activate this group by radio (from LIMITED BASE)
Soviet

when soneone of interest left the/iubassy gate and stay with then

until they made their meetings. These nts knew about the LEUITED

SASE bedause they had LIMITED photos for identification purposes.
This worked fairly well until about the middle of 1958 (check date)
when one of the surveillance agents got too close to his terget and
was arrested by the Mexican transit police end turned over to the

Mexican Secret Service. By the time the Stetion could arrange through

a cleared attorney to bail him out (Judd Austin of the
(Little and Riquelme firm),\ the agent. had identified Sancho (iho wes

evacuated across the border at Nogales by Bob Shaw) and the inside——

up into several others. The agents were not changed but were given

think the staff first developed from a pro-Castro group celebrating on New

2 Polish, “and 1 Yugoslav line. The basehouse listening post had a live
mss

monitor who made short summaries of interesting conversations for a daily

resume vhich was received each day around 8 a.m. (passed by Flick to Gocdpasture
to get to Scott before 9.a.m.) Later (when the reel was completely recorded)
full transcripts were typed ard passed to the stetion in the same way, however,
there was usually a time leg of a day or eo. ‘ Those transcripts which hdd
Russian or another language besides Spanish or English went out of the listening
post the day after the transcript (of other conversations on the reel)was |
typed. These reels vere taken to another location where they were trenslated
end typed. In the case of the Russien translations, Boris Tarasoff usually ren

about a week behind the date of the conversation because of the volume oF Py

“Russian conversations among the «embers of the Soviet Exbassy. During this

period (fell of 1963) the reels vere probably being brought into the station

and carried to Boris by one of the people from the Soviet Section or they nay

I am certain thet the Osvald call came to our attention from the
Soviet line. It was picked uz end taken to Boris for a transletion because
the caller was trying to speak Russian. Any delay was caused by waiting to
