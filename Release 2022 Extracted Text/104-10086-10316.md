ACTION REQUIRED - REFERENCES

We would like to take

time out in our Investigation of the President's

assassination to appraise the role of the Mexico City Station in the whole affair.

the early afternoon of 22 November 1963, Mexico City has been the only

overseas reporter

While this is partly dictated by the

of Lee OSWALD's life, we have not overlooked the really outstanding per-

formance of Mexico City's major assets and the speed, precision, and perception

with which the data was forwarded.

Here it was relayed within minutes to the

White House, ODACID, and ODENVY.

Your LIENYOY data, the statements of Silvia DURAN, and your analyses

were major lactors in the quick clarification of the case, blanking out the really

ominous spectre of foreign backing.:

We rezret that we have been able to send you so little information in

return, but we have not been siven much yet.

We do know that Lee OSWALD denied

ne had ever been to Mexico except for a jump to lia Juana.

We have quickly

screened the FBI report on the whole case but we do not yet have a copy for

retention.

It does not

Times has printed about

copromise your sources. Basically, what the New York

we report is all true.

We have meanwhile been flooded with fabrications, of which the ALVARADO

story was the most troublesone.

They are still coming in.

You have had good support from your llaison, but as usual the really

outstanding features were Mexico Station's lamous generalship and the skill and

devotion of its personnel. Please convey our admiration to all who participated,

down to the last technician, translator,

We know that

your station did during the President's 1962 visit made you feel this tragedy

with particular keenness, as did we.
