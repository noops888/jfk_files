"RGTION REQUIRED - REFERENCES

1. We would like to take time out in our investigation of the President's i
assassination to appraise the role of the Mexico City Station in the whole affair.
Since the early afternoon of 22 November 1963, Mexico City has been the only
major overseas reporter in the case. While this is partly dictatea by the
fects of Lee OSWALD's life, we have not overlooked tie,yeally outstanding per-
formance of Mexico City's mejor assets and the speedy precision, and perception
with which the data was forwarded. Here it vas:reldyéd within minutes to the
White House, ODACID, and ODENYY. ae

2, Your LIENYOY data, the statements of Silvia DURAN, and your analyses |
were major factors in the quick clarification of the case, blanking out the really i
ominous spectre of foreign backing, aa anaeaasanaenaaet
nn

3. We regret that we have been able to send you so little information in
return, but we have not been-23 a We do know that Lee OSWALD denied
he had ever been to Mexico except for a jump to Ta Juana, We have quickly
screened the FBI report¢oy:tke“whole case but we do not yet have a copy for
retention. It does n gigioronise your sources. Basically, what the New York
Times has printed ans fe

report is all true.

3- We have meanwhile been flooded with fabrications, of which the ALVARADO
story was the most troublesome, They are still coming in.

4, You have had good support from your liaison, but as usual the really
outstanding features were Mexico Station's famous generalship and the skill and
@evotion of its personnel. Please convey our admiration to all who participated,
down to the last technician, translator, and monitor. We know that the work
your Station did during the President's 1962 visit made you feel this tragedy
with particular keenness, as did we.
