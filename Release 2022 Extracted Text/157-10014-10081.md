Mr. Goodwin. Richard M. Goodwin, 1536 32nd Street, N.W.,

| Washington, 0.¢.

Mr. Schwarz. And as a mactar of course, we tall all of
our witnesses what they no douht know, that they have their
right to counsel, and you know that, and if you want to stop
te obtain counsel, you know that you can do that?

Mr. Goodwin. I already have too many lawyers,

Mr. Schwarz. And you know what your constitutional
rights ere?

Mr. Goodwin. Hopefully.

Mr. Schwarz. Now, what connection did you have with the
Dominican Republic in the winter and apring of 19617

Mr. Goodwin. I cama into the White House aa Assistant
Special Counsel to the President, having worked on Latin

American affaira policy statements in the preceeding campaign.

i became involved in Latin America. And from that period until

I left to go to the State Department, I was involved on a
daily basis with President Kennedy and his actitities'’in Latin
America which dncluded what was happening in the Dominican
Republic in terms that I drafted contingency plans, I prepare:

cables that went to Mr. Dearborn focussing on the areas that

you are interested in, and f was with him every day on somethin;

connected with Latin America.

Mr, Schwarz, Without your turning to the documentary

material, would you recount for the Committee your understand! n:

of what the United States governmant policy toward the Dominic
Republic was in the winter and spring of ‘61 and what actions
wera taken to implement that polley,

Mr. Goodwin. Well, that policy was 4 continuation of th.
policy established by Prasident Eisenhower when he, in
sccordance with the vote of the OAS, voted to sever == decided i
te saver diplomatic and commercial relations with the Dominican.
Republic and the sithation whith you know arose was precipitated
by the attempted assassination of Prasident Retancourt by the ‘
President of the Dominican Republic.

So that from that point on whan we came in, tha feeling
was, first of all, of course that Trujillo was even more
at odds with the philosophy of the Alliance for Progress than
had besn and beyond that, having cut off diplomatic and other
relations, that Trujillo's time: dh office was probably, ~  *
numbered. The principal support of the regime in that decade
which was often in great domestic difficulty had been the
concept of American support, it strengthened Trujillo agains:
his opposition.

At that peint our policy became ons of trying to anticio.:
at least, the fall of Trujillo. Of course the Castro thing
waa vary much in averybody's mind and the principal concern «!
the President, thea one thing he didn't want was for Trujillo

to go and a Communist leader to coma in.- So ft think the policy:

« a PIM

was to keep up our economia and diplomatic prassure to hope

that when Trujillo went, howaver he went, wheather violently or
Peacefully or died a natural death that the guccassion would
be a moderate, democratic group friendly to the interests of
the United States in the Caribbean and therefore try to keap in
touch with and halp out and keep communications open with

the potential sucesssor groups, and it was very hard to
pinpoint.

Mr. Schwarz, What steps did you take during the period
of time you ware involvad, or prior thereto, if you know
about it, in order to assist one or more of the dissident
groups?

Mr. Goodwin. Well, wa did al) sorta == everything from
Policy statements, tha usé of USIA, the ude of: ecodomic
Pressure, to maintain our network of contacts with exile
groups principally'in New York and elsewhere. A certain number

of limited covert operations, some transfer of arms. Dearborn

of course was ona of ths principals, his principal instruction
was to try to kasp all channels of communication open, he was
zealous in thie beacause he disliked Trujiilo intensely hinself |
and felt that he ought to be allied with these other groups.
And I raad through the sort of overall Planning papers, and ©
think they fairly reflect that range of operations.

None of them warw terribly affactive.

Mr. Schwarz. In connection with the transfer of arma,

what, to your understanding, waa the time at which authorizatio

was provided to transfer arms?

Mr. Goodwin, January 12, 1960, under President Eisenhower.;

Mt. Schwarz. And that was at a muating of the Special
Group?
Mr. Goodwin. Well, 1 don't know because they didn't let
me in that week, but there wae an NSC action memorandum of
some kind which just set forth the authorization. 1 don't real}
know the procedure.

Me. Schwarz. When ware the arms passed?

Mr. Goodwin, 1 don’t know. 1 becama aware of the transfer

of arms. The transfer I think you're thinking of is the
transfer of a couple of carbines and .38 pistols. After the

transfer had boon made

came to us from the Dominican Republic along with the request

for the transfer of machines guns which were to be used in an i

effort to kill Trujillo, tha smaller guns ware to be given as
Dearbern told me later in conversation efter the assassination
because these psople felt their own lives wera in danger,
especially if they embarked on anything ‘as risky as trying to
kill Trujillo, and they wanted some self-defense weapons, and
they were given to them for self-defense and then they made a

tried and most of them, thay were all dead. ft was a vary
risky business. It's not tha kind of thing they would want to
try with a .38,

And f think also, I mean nobody, TI think -- as I say, we
had no particular anticipation that thia or any other group
would be successful in something that nobody had been able to
do for thirty years, but at any rate, those were the backstops.

Mr. Schwarz. Did you know how the arms were passed into
the Dominican Rapublic, as opposed to passed to the dissidents?

Mr. Goodwin, No, I only know what Dearborn later told ma
in conversation. I only have this fifteen year old mamory
on my part that he qave them to them in the consulate. IT may
have known at one time how ha qot them. There were @ lot of

gune in the Dominican Republic. \ ay

Mr. Schwarz, Did you know

Mr. Goodwin. I did not know that, but T wouldn't be
surprised, waapons of that size.
Mr. Schwarz. Now again, when were the arms passed, as

far as you know?

Mr. Goodwin, Well I don't know, I don't have the exact --

the message is in here. J think it was after President
Kennedy took office. .

Mr, Goodwin. 1961.

Me. Schwarz. Somatime aubsequent to Jahuary 20th.

Mr. Goodwin. Well, now that I look at this, all it says
was late January.

The Chairman, ‘This is June lst, this is dated June lst,

Mr, Goodwin. TI may have known. All I -- my firet
knowledge was this documant, the timetable that I requested
which simply informed me that the delivery of carbines had heen
made in late January. {I don't know any more than that

Mr. Schwarz. All right.

Mr. Goodwin. Thie is my source of knowledge. I may have
learned more subsequent to it if Mearborn pinpointed it.

Me. Schwarz. In addition with dealing with Dearborn, ware
you dealing with anybody from the CIA on this?
Goodwin.

Mere Well, they wore always at the maetings.

Me. Schwarz. Who do you remember from the CIA?

Me. Goodwin. ‘Tracy Barnes =~ T can't be sure who all was
there. At the meeting with the Vice President, I'm sure some-
body like Bissell, at least, would have been thera. But I'm
sure you must have a list.

a series of questions as to what you were or ware not told.

Now, were you teld that the arma which had been delivered
had been delivered to persona who said at timea that they
wanted to use tham for parsonal defense, but who said more
often that they wanted to use them for assassination purroses?

those arms were denied and «=

Mr. Schwarz. I'm going to come to that. I want to know
what you wera informed about the intentions of the dissidents.
You didn’t answer my question. You said you were frequently

apacifically with raspact to the Dominicen Republic, were you
or ware you not informed that the Aqency had been told by the
dissidents that they intended to accomplish the assassination
of Fidel Castro -- excuse me, of Trujillo -- whather or not
they received the machine quns?

Than the second paragraph, “We consider it essential that

of the United States is to assure that Castro-Communist

is an analysis of the dissidents and their intention, the ‘

Now don't those words at laast convey or land themselves

Mr. Goodwin. Well, I don't heldeve so, Senator, because

1 think, to me, the plain meaning of the worda and as 1
understood it was that we must not run the risk of U.S.

be associated with the process of political assassination in
any form.

to an authorization of January 12th, prior to Kennedy's taking
office. I'm not sure of the date of the transfer, 1 haven't
sean any indication of the date of that transfer, 1 do know
that the President waa not aware of any transfer of guns,
because he told ma ha was not aware of it, until wa finally
requested a raview a couple of months, a few months later, of
our complete covert operations in the Dominican Republic, at
Which point we became aware that this transfer had occurred.

I etill don't know the date of that transfer.

And then it was the basia of that hrisfing paper, whieh
obviously the Dominican Republic was not the first matter on
President Kennedy's agenda when he came into offica, on the
basis of that briefing paper, he reviewed our policy and sant
this telegram.

‘The Chairman. And was the purpose of the telegram to call
oft any further involvement by the United States government in
an assassination attempt against Mr. Trujillo.

Mr. Goodwin. The purpose was to make sure the United
States was not involved in any assassination. The purpose was to

slow down that kind of over-zealousness. The Prasidant was

Senator Tower. That doasn't totally anawur the question.
Mr. Goodwin. Well, t'm sorry.

The Chairman. Well, you S6%, We know, from your tastimony,

that you had been advised in May that certain weapons had been
transferred to certain dissident groups who at least had
expressed an interest in assassinating Trujillo.

Mr. Goodwin. Corzect.

The Chairman. $0 there was 4 connection, the connection
being that the American government, through the CIA, furnished

weapons to a group that had communicated ite interest, if not

ite intention, to assassinate Trujillo.

So then you send this massage, and I'm asking you if the
massage was Meant to call this off, thin involvement. What
axactly was meant? You weren't saying recover those arms.

Mr. Goodwin, No, I wasn't. No.

The Chairman. But at the same time, you ware saying, don's

transfer the machine guns, Wera you not?

Mr. Goodwin. That's right. I think the Prasident -- what
wa were saying is --

The Chairman, What exactly were you saying?

Mr. Goodwin, We were saving that we didn't want to do
anything that would involve us further, the United States
further, in any effort to assassinate Trujillo.

position. So what, again the interpretation that can be drawn
from this is that wa don't want to be involved, but go ahead
and have the other-guys on, because their position would be to
assassinate Trujillo, s0 what you are in affect doing is saying,’
let's don't be involved in it but let's indicate our support
for what they are doing.

Mr. Goodwin. We were indicating our support for what they,

were doing on the basis of the astimate in the contingency

paper that Trujillo's days ware numhered and whoever took offica

we wanted to ba our man. that is correct. And so wa were goina |
to support and try to retain relations and say we would support,
which in not a difficult thing to do, as you know, any qdroup
that might take office and ba moderate and pro-tnited States.
That was all we wore interested in, was having a pro-American
government. :

Senator Schweiker. Wall, there are two other references
here, Mr. Goodwin. Paragraph 3, “In case of assassination or ¢
overthrow” -- obviously you still had a reference thare, whether
dnitiated by a pro-U.S. group or not, was #till part of the
planning, and then back on page 3 you say, "In actual fact, we
feel tha transfer of arms would serve very little purpose and

expose tha United States to great danger of ultimate disclosure |

1 in participation in an easassination attempt," and that is

scratched out, and says “assassination attempt,” meaning that

“ in fact did you dalete those four words, “uitimate disclosure

Since the ultimate would still be disclosed if you gave this.

So what interpretation? I mean, thie is rift here with
assassination propositions, and tha fact that you have “ultimate!
disclosure," fear of ultimate disclosure of participation,
meant that certainly there was something already afoot, that
ultimately would be disclosed if you went ahead with this
pass through.

Mr. Goodwin. I think what wa were saying is if wa did,
it would be found out ultimately, which means not right away,.
but later. In the case cf asnasaination or overthrow, there
ware many groups, & continual flow of groups, of information,
that there were various groups planning te assassinate

Mr. Goodwin, Well, the words wara deleted because they
ware words that ware going to giva exactly the impression you
are talking about. By talking about ultimate disclosure, We
were afraid of being found out and what we didn't want was any
ct ciation with the assassination attempts, so the reference
to disclosure was struck and the words asscciation were
inserted.

Senator Schweiker. But you still call off -- you still
left the language, in actual fact we feel the transfer of arms
would serve very little purpose and expose the Unitad States
to great danger of association with assasaination attempts.
That still makes the point that you want to make, but you had
other language, that says “ultimate disclosure of participation)
which implies to me you were concerned about other things you |

were doing and things that had already been programmed and an |

operation that you wers as much concerned about those belinda -~
or you wouldn't have changed the language to still say the same;

Sanator Schweiker. You changed the language, but the first
part of it remained exactly tha same, In fact, wa feel the
transfer of arma would serve very little purpose and expose
the United States. So while you changed the language, you had

to use the weepons we had supplied to assassinate Trujillo in

that before you wrote the telagram, or not?

Mr. Goodwin. No, because what I'm responding to is a
request that says we can't do it unless we have the machine
guns, and that's to be used for the assassination. Weare

Mr. Goodwin. Well, let ma say, Senator, first of all,
that the question of assassination now is Paramount in people's

minds. There - is no doubt that we hoped that Trujillo would. he

unanimous vote of the Organization of American States that it
ba ostracized and sanctions imposed with the hops that it
might happen. And that occurred aver before wa took office and
we were in full agraament with it.

There are papers here which talk about the avent of a coup

; of how you're going to get Trujillo some Monsey to get him out

lof tha country, Assassination waa always 4 possibility, but

4 coup d'etat, # revolution or a civil war of some kind, a whole!
range of possibilities. And we did, in fact, believe that
Trujillo was going to be overthrown one way or another and

not necessarily, or even in paramount in our minds, by assassi~

ination because -- in fact, it would sasm at that time to he the
“most difficult thing of all to do. He was heavily guarded and

| protected, ordinarily. Thay knew more about it than we did.

And when that happened, which wa favored that happened,

Senator Mondale. Yeah, but » if we wers completely

goulda't communicate with tham after the forces had been set

Mr, Goodwin. Well, may I tell you, [ don't know that there

i ever was any statement that those guns that were authorized on
i January 12th, either in the authorization or subsequent, for
the purposes of assassination or otherwise.
Mr. Schwarz. Well,.theare’' were ‘scores of those,

and that those guns were to be used for an assasaination effort

Senator Mondale. Well, you saw, that could be important,

because if your understanding was as you have just described
then the telegram makes more 8@! « But if in fact we were
implicated, as I understood earlier in assassination attempts --

The Chairman. Fritz, leok at the way Dearborn is. 7
think {t's very important to understand this matter, to look
at the way Dearborn apparently understood the instruction. He
was the one to whom it wae given, and he wires back, having
received the instruction, the following -- now this is at Tah

Mz. Goodwin. Yes, I do.

The Chairman. It says: “One, I beifeve we can hold pro-tiniter
States dissidents, although with soma grumbling on the basis
get forth." Now you're not likely to hold them if you tell
them you're no longer connected with their scheme and tr.
Dearborn had not been instructed to tell them that.

“two, following our obasrvations for Department and CAS

had said in the telegram. And the request had been to know
whether or not he could supply arms.

So that I see from that point of view, I am not sure,

quite clear, in what way he misinterpreted the telegram

Tha Chairman. Well, let's go down -- I don't think he
has misinterpreted his instructions not to supply more arma.
That's clear enough. Aut Lf you go down to B =~ are you with

Mr. Goodwin. Yea.

position.”

Now Y would read those words aa meaning that Mr. Dearborn
anticipated at least the real possibility of assaseination
attempts in the immediate future and that he was recommendine
that thoaa CIA officers that had been connacted with having
supplied weapons should be taken out of the Dominican Republic

right away.

Mr. Goodwin, Well, T would agraa with a good part of that.)
i

Senator, although I think that there were assassination plots
aimmaring in the Dominican Republic and now, and of course this
in fact took place. And f think he wes concerned that the
assassination would be unsuccesaful, that Trujillo would pick
up the Americans and find out not simply about the transfer of
guns but the whole range of covert activities that thay had
been engaged in, torture them and perhaps kill then.

And he thought the safest thing to do, with this thing in

the alr, was to get them out of the country. There was nothings

I think, in the telsgram that waa sent to him that denies the |
possibility that Trujillo might be assassinated or that there
might be an attempted assassination, which igs the purport of
Duarborn’s, because if the assassination was successful, thern
was no nuad to get the CIA out.

The Chairman. . But there is somathing more, raally. If

the possibility of assassination was a long continuing thins,

always on the mind of Pearhorn, why doas he raspond to this

inatruction by saying, gat these man out now?
Mr. Goodwin, Well IY think obviously these people had

ralayed to him that they're going to try to make the attempt

anyway, with or without the machine guns. lle thought the attempt

might be ebortive, and if so, ha thought that all Americans or

people that worked for him or with him would be in danger

The Chairman. Then -you would have to aares with me,
wouldn't you, that in his opinion, Mearborn's opinion, he had
evidence that suggasted te him that en assination attempt
was imminent.

Mr, Goodwin. 1 think that’s clear. Yaa, T think it was.

The Chairman. And he took this sufficiently serious to
recommend gatting the three CIA agents out without further
delay?

Mr. Goodwin. 1% think that's right. That's absolutely

l true, because I think he believed that there was a serious

attempt in the offing, as‘indesd there was, and he was absolute!)
right and he was doing his job wall.

I would like to say, if T might go back, that in terms of

| che telegram, is that I sat in the office with Prasident
b Kennedy who instructed me to draft a telegram to say that ha

ll wanted nothing to do with political assassinations, which 1

did, so it's not a matter of interpretation, because ha cannot

Senator Mondale. In othar words, the President was
advised by you that there was an aséasaination plot in which we
were implicated and he told you that we don't want any part of
it and you are to send & message on his authority saying that.
and that is what you thought you had done?

Nr. Goodwin, 1 would phrase it a little bit differently,
Senator, which is to say I would say there were people who
wanted to assassinate Trujillo to whom wa had given some guns
! and his response was probably like, ycu mean some idiot dave
them guns? I said, yes. Ha said -- thin is a paraphras!

you know, if you knaw Senator Kennedy, or President Kennedy,

 t mean, he said, well, let’s make it clear. And if you compara

| this message through but we're blocked by Mr. Goodwin and hava

course, than the President.

It 4s clear that the stress is changed to make it clear

that the President wants nothing to do and cannot condone
"assassination. t does not say cannot condone being caught at
assassination, 4¢ says cannot condone assassination. And.t did
that becauss he told ms to do that.

you knew that, to the extent that weapons had heen furnished

Mr. Goodwin, ‘That's right. Wa found == the President

«continue to inform dissident elements of U.S. support for

Mr. Goodwin, They were -- thelr position was that, what

the other mambers of the Organization of American States, an?
va wanted to make it very clear that we d{4 support that
position, and we wished them wall in their efforts to establish
i that position and if they did we would recoqniza their govern-
meant and send them assistance, which we did.

As a matter of fact, we took much greater efforts to
{got cid of Ramfas Trujillo in the six monthe that followed the

assascination than anything that preceeded it, including brinqing

the American fleat practically into the harbor at Cuddad

f
Trujillo at the direction of the Secretary of Defense. Instead !

of carbines and pistols, we brought in destroyers, aircraft

| carriers and Marina battalions ao that thay would know what

' the consequences might be if they didn't get out when they cot
"out.

Tf I might make one more point, Senator, if I may, is that

the countries of South America are full of quns sent there

by the American government to be used to kill thousands of
I

" people over the last several decadas, and with the lone

“exception of both revolutionaries from underneath and armies
from on top -- of course you'rns well-acquainted with that --
sant knowing that they would be used to kill people in interne)

‘ struqqles. The only distinction in this case is that Trujillo

happened to be tha head of State, which is a practical

“distinction, but you'could hardly make a moral one.

The Chairman, Well, I am not sure I agree with that,
geithough that ig a philescphical argument.

Senator Raker. Are you tailing us, Mr. Goodwin, that
assassination, not of heads of stata, hut assassination of
lesser figures was a common, ordinary occurrance in South
America at tha behest of America or with American support?

Mr. Goodwin. No, 1 am talking about that we supply arms
to revolutionary groups or to armed groups which we did in
say Bolivia, or sometimes to the government itself, of in Chile
we gave assistance of various kinds to dissident groups with
the knowledge that our assistance would he used in internal
atruggies.

I don't have to use the word assassinations.

Senator Baker. Sut how about for internal struggles, then,

4 as opposed to assassination?

Mr. Goodwin, Well, this is an internal struggle in the
Dominican Republic.

The Chairman, 1 think you racoqnize the distinction,
because it is well-defined in our criminal laws. There is
a difference between first deqres murder and manslaughter.

Mr. Goodwin. Well, there are gradations, although I do
think that many of the activities against, say, someone like
Allende or others are equally tarqettsd in Latin American
countries and not just general conflict or the killing of
particular t- Mexicans, ‘ofcourse, traditionally go out and

about meetings held after the assassination back {n Washington
whan Mr. Dearborn came back as well as those maetings held
after the assassination before he came back, at which the
whole matter was discussed, initially with Vics President
Johnson presiding and ultimately, the last one, with President
Kannedy.

Mr. Goodwin. That's right. Wa had, of course, « series
of amargencias. Wa had an emergency meeting, and cabled the
President who was in Paris, and the first matter on our mind
was how to ksep Ramfes Trujillo, who was the son of Trujillo,
from taking over, and we didn't know where he was, at first,
it took us awhile to find out that he was in Paris, which at
least (ndicated, Senator, that if they were planning it, it
: wasn't done in a very comprehensive fashion, and wa found he
was in Paris and we wanted to stop him from returning, to
detain him, but it was too hate. By the time wa found out, he
had already chartered an Air France jet and was on his way to
Cuidad Trujillo, and I believe thare was some affort made to

biufé him off by sending massages to ths plane in flight,

diverting it to somy Amyrican airport, but he didn't do that.

and he landed and took ovar. And I think the principal aim of
our policy from that point on was how to qat him and his uncle,
Nector -- and I forget tha othar fellow's nama -- out of there
so that tha kind of moderata government that wa wanted could

i bu installed.
