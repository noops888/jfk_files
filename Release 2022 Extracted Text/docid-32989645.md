ACTION
H ADEX should be changed to include the new alias and
subject's position 6 a staff writer for the Times. Also,

since subject is writing under a still different pseudonym,
for the Monterey Park Progress newspapers, it is suggested
that consideration be given to advising the Internal Revenue
Service that she may be receiving payroll checks under these
pseudonyms and not reporting her total income correctly. Appro-~
priate investigation should be conducted to verify subject's
use of the additional pseudonym.

Y GOVERNMENT

SUBJECT: APPLICANT INVESTIGATIONS

7 ; 7 7 7 , El tone,
The Director has ingutred conéerning the procedure wht chi Ser tea

was followed in the Atomic Energy Act applicant casé whereby Tee feose

the Washington Field Office was not alerted to the fact that
Harold Ickes, whose name was given as a reference, should not b
interviewed eo :

There is attached a memorandum dated December 20, 1949 from
Ur. Rosen to Ur. Ladd with respect to the specific Atomic Energy case|
mentioned, namely Fred Ernest Schnepfe, who had gtven Harold Ickes :
as a@ reference on his PSQ or application form. From a reading of the.
attachéd memorandum which was prepared by Section Chief G, C. Callan~
of the Applicant Section, t% ts ‘obvious that the Supervisors who handle
applicant matters .in the Investigative Division do not have any policy
with respect to the interviewing of references, former employers,
associates or others except where the Bureau has specifically tndicated
that certain individuals should not be contacted, such as Henry Steele
Commager, personnel of CBS and the like. As a matter of fact, the z
present policy in effect at the Seat of Government concerning applicant
investigations is to interview all references and the attached memorandun
indicates that Harold Ickes had been interviewed in the past tn connec=
tion with applicant investigations and has exhibited a cooperative ..
attitude. It would seem, therefore, that no action should be taken
with respect to the supervisory personnel at the Seat of Government con=
cerning the referral of Harold Ickes' name to the Washington Field :
Office for interview in connection with the Atomic Energy Act case :
mentioned o :

As you know, at the Erecutives Conference the Directors wishés

with regard to interviewing persons who have demonstrated hostile .
attitudes toward the Bureau have been considered in the past qgnd no
instructions have been issued to the Supervisors at the Seat of Govern~
ment or. to the field concerning this matter except as to specific in=
gividuals whose names have been sent to the field in the recent past

in an SAC Letter. This matter was called to the attention of the
Brecutives Conference as recently as December 20, 1949 and the Confer~
ence felt it would be undestrable for the Bureau to embark upon a prow
gran of advising the field to not interview certain ‘individuals in
connection with various types of investigations conducted by the Bureau,
The Executives Conference realized that the hostile attitude toward -the
Bureau stéms not srom our criminal investigative work but from the
Bureau's investigative activity in the field of applicant investigations
and the Loyalsy Program. fhe Conference feels that the blacklisting

of individuals ts fundamentally bad and will ultimately result in ecm
treme enbarrassment to the Bureau. Thrks, also felt it is extremely

lifficult to draft a letter to all SAC's pointing up the problem to
them and expecting them to adhere to any policy whitch wtl1l eliminate
the difficulty which we have encountered heretofore.

I have discussed this matter with Mr. Carlson in some detatl
and he feels that we may be. able to control to some extent the inter
viewing of persons hostile to the fureau at the Seat of Government
without furntshing a "black list” or statement of policy to the field.
ur. Carlson feels, and I agree with him, that the major portion of our
difficulty stems from the Loyalty investigations and applicant investi-
gations. Mr. Carlson and I therefore propose that the following pro=
cedure be instituted immediately at the Seat of Government tn order to
neet the objectives desired by the Director tn‘connection with this
matters ‘

1. The Crime Records Sectton shall be responsible for preparing
and maintaining in a current status a list of those individuals known
to be hosttle to the Bureau. ‘It is felt that it is imperative that a
dist be prepared. because the judgment of individual Supervisors re~
ferring cases to the field will:differ depending upon the extent of
their day to day newspaper reading, radt6 listening and perusal of
various and sundry periodicals. It would also mean that each Supervisor
would have to either prepare his own list or endeavor to depend on a-
faulty memory. Furthermore, an individual may at one time appear to be
hostile to the Bureau and subsequently his attitude may change and t¢
may be very desirable to interview hin.

aes

2. This list shall be furnished to only those Supervisors at the,
Seat of Government who have the responstbility for assigning Loyalty
or applicant cases to the field. This will include Supervisors in the vi
Loyalty Section of the Security Diviston, the Applicant Section of the 7
Investigative Diviston and those Supervisors in the Administrative ee
Division handling Bureau applicant cases. This will mean that not more |
than 25 Supervisors at most at the Seat of Government will have pos~—
session of such a list. These Supervisors shall check all references
and present end former employers against this list before referring
the case to the field for investigation. .- : X

re It should be realized that the procedure recommended will not
‘provide against interviews with neighbors of the applicants or
associates whose names are brought up during the course of the inves=
tigation. It is felt, however, that the dulk of the people who are .
interviewed in these cases are set out as references by the applicant’ ™
and it would only be on @ rare occasion that a person hostile to the
Bureau will be interviewed on a netghborhood investigation or as an

associate of the applicant. . ,

The Bseouttives Conference of January 4, 1950, cdrnsist~(fe
ing of Messrs. Tolson, Glavin, Harbo, Ladd, Rosen, Clegg,

structions, considered the attached memorandun of December 2h,
1949, with respect to the procedures in conducting applicant
investigations and particularly the method suggested to avot
views with those individuals having a hostile or critical attitude.

foward the Bureau and its work.

It was pointed out to the Conference that apparently the
hostility and crittcitsm of the Bureau stem not from our normal day to
day criminal investigative work but to a very slight extent to inves~
tigations in the Internal Security field and very specifically and
[definitely to applicant and Loyalty investigations. It was fe that
if some procedure could be devised to avoid interviews with individuais

in applicant type eases where the individuals have exhtbited a hostile
or critical attitude toward the Bureau that much could be accomplisned
[eo eliminate the dipftculties experienced in the past. The Conference
ifelt it would be undesirable to prepare a list of any sort which night
jbe termed a "blacklist" to be distributed to all ofthe divisional
offices. It was proposed that the following procedure be instituted
imnedtately at the Seat of Government in order to meet the objectives
desired by the Director in connection with this matters:

Section sh 11 be responsible for preparing
and maintaining in a current status those individuals known

It was pointed out that the procedure recommended will not |
provide against interviews with neighbors of the applicants or subjécts
under investigatton in connection with the Loyalty Program nor would it
provide against interviews of associates whose names are brought up
during the course of the investigation. Likewise it would not provide
against interviews with college professors whose names were not given
by the applicant or the Loyalty subject as references, but who are
contacted, in the course of the ordinary investigation. It was felt,

‘ however, that the bulk of the people who are interviewed'in these
cases are set out as references by the applicant and it would only be
on @ rare occasion that a person hostile to the Bureau would be inter~
viewed tn a netghborhood investigation, as an associate or as a college
professor. 7 :

It was also unanimously recommended .by the Conference that in
addition to the preparation of the list recommended and the checking
at the Seat of Government by the indicated Supervisors, that where a
specific individual has manifested hostility or unjust criticism against
the Bureau that the specific field-office or offices which would likely
contact the tndividual be advised in writing in the form of a@ Personal
and Confidential SaC letter. In these letters the SAC will be instructed
that it is his responsibility to advise all of the Agents in the office
of the undesirability of contacting the individual in question without
prior Bureau authority. The field will be instructed that in address-
ing thetr communications to the Bureau requesting authority to contact
such individuals, the letter or communication should not contain the
phraseology thot the interview will be conducted unless advised to the
contrary but specific approval must be obtained from the Bureau before
such a contact its made. :

Should the Director agree with the recommendations of the
Conference set forth in this memorandum, appropriate steps will be
taken to inaugurate the policy recommended. 7

ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED

OF THE DEPARTMENT se Q Nr?

in line with the Director's approval, the Attorney General was H
contacted this morning, July 7, 1961, relative to his observation as to the
ij possibility of utilizing "electronic devices” in organized crime investigations,

,
It was pointed out to the Attorney General that we had taken action
with regard to the use of microphone surveillances in these cases and while
i they represented an expensive investigative step, we were nevertheless utilizing
--} them in all instances where this was technically feasible and where valuable
:. | information might be expected, The strong objections to the utilization of
7 “telephone taps as contrasted to microphone surveillances was stressed. The
Attorney General stated he recognized the reasons why telephone taps should

lusing microphone surveillances where these objections do not apply wherever’.
_ }{possible in organized crime matters.

The Attorney General noted that he had approved several technical
3 surveillances in connection with security-type investigations since he took
“ 1) office, but that he had not kept any record and didn't really know what he had
-~ approved and what surveillances were currently in operation. He said that for
his own information he would like to see a list of the technical surveillances
\ now in operation. He added that this could be brought over to him personally
and that he would look it over and immediately return it because he realized
> | the importance of having these records maintained under the special security
| conditions which only the FBI had.

SJ

> Vi If the Director approves, we will have the list of technical

aS surveillances prepared, delivered personally to the ee General and

August 17, 1961

In connection with the use of microphone
surveillances it is frequenily necessary io lease 2 special telephone -
. line in order io monitor such a surveillence. These situations
q . occur when it is impossible to locate a secure monitoring point
; in the immediate vicinity of the premises covered by the microphone.
Even though a special telephone line is utilized, this activity in
( no way involves any interception of telepnonic communications and
7 is not a telephone tap. -

In the New York City area the telephone company
‘. has over the years insisted thai a leiter be furnished-to the telephone
compony on each occasion when a special telephone line is leased by
the FSi, It is recuired that such alezse arrangement be with the
approval of the Attorney Genersl, In the past we have restricted

the utilization of leased lines in New Yorx City to situations involving
telephone taps, all of which have been approved by tuo +ttorney General.

We have not previously used leased 2.1es in connection
with microphone surveillances because of certain technical Loulties
which existed in New York City. These technical difficulties have,
however, now been overcome. if we are vermitted io use leased teleshon
lines as an adjunct to our microphone survetilances, this type of coverage
can be-materially extended both in security and major criminal cases.
Accordingly, your ayprov7i of our utilizing this leased line arrangerient
is requested. A sample oi the letter which it is proposed will be sent
to the telesnone company if a leased line is secured in comection wit
microphone suxveillances is attached,

The Not To Contact list is a card index of A in-

on official business, gave rise to doubts as to the advisability
of contacting them again. When a person was placed on the
Not To Contact list, the Field Office covering the residence
or occupation or both was advised that this particular individual
should not be contacted without prior Bureau authority. Thus,
the Not To Contact list did not prohibit future contact, but
specified it could be made only after clearance with the Bureau.
