It was dis cussed in Dave Phillips

book as

in my

view was

unjust and unnecess ary

was talking about).

Normally, the Spanish transcript for the 1 October

The Russian language portion

would have. gone

the film stayed in the camera until a full

He wanted the photographic coverage tied in with

Mexico Station Coverage of Soviet and Cuban Embassies (1963)

1. Unilateral Coverage:

From the time the Mexico Station was opened in April 1947 until

the arrival of Mr. Win Scott as Chief of Station in 1955, the Station had

developed a support apparatus to exploit leads from the Soviet Embassy in

Mexico City. This umbrella type project (LIPSTICK

phone taps, three photographic sites, a mobil

surveillance team and a

mail intercept operation.

Telephone taps (LIFEAT

telephone company who

case officer. The number

of lines tapped wa

inited only by the availability of a listening post

nearby and the availability of langauge (English, Spanish, Soviet, Polish,

Czech, etc.) transcribers. Generally, these were Mexican or Mexican-

• American recruited agents.

Three photographic sites were handled by a Station case officer

assisted by technicians on TDY from Headquarters who advised the Station

on the best types of cameras, films, and concealment devices. These

operations had

sub-crypts under project LIPSTICK (namely: LIMITED, LILYRIC

and LICALLA): LIMITED was a fixed site directly opposite the Soviet Em-

bassy (across the street) which had both a vehicle and a pedestrian en-

trance. The gate to the Soviet Embassy was on the northwest corner of the

Soviet compound and the LIMITED site was diagonally across a double laned

street on the southeast corner of' that block. (See attached diagram).

LIMITED was the first photo base and operated strictly on an experimental

basis in the early stages. This base, however, was closed when the Sta-

tion received word that the photograph of the "unidentified man" was

being released by the Warren Commission. LILYRIC was an alternate photo-

graphic base. It was located in an upper story of an apartment building

on the same side of the street as the LIMITED site bu

the block south. It had a planted view of th

Embassy. LICALLA, the third photograph

arden of the Soviet Embassy compound. The

purpose of this operat

was to get good identification photographs of

Soviet personnel.

The three photographic sites were managed by a re-

cruited agent who was a Mexican citizen, the son of an American mother

and Mexican father (deceased). This agent collected the film from the

LIMITED and LILYRIC sites three times a week. The film was then de-

veloped and printed into 8 x 10 contact print strips. LICALLA film was

originally processed in the Station but in early 1959, due to the resig-

nation of a technician, this film like that of LIMITED and LILYRIC was

processed on the outside by a recruited agent.

Mobile surveillance was conducted by two American staff officers.

These two officers organized a surveillance team of six recruited agents

which used late model cars and a panel truck for surveillance. The team

could be activated by radio from the LIMITED site whenever someone of

interest left the gate of the Soviet Embassy. These agents were aware of

the LIMITED site since they had been issued LIMITED photographs for

identification purposes.

The Station also conducted a unilateral mas

of Federal Security (DFS), with which we conducted liaison, was a hip-

was principally occupied with political investigations and control of

foreigners. Their agents were wis reity, and corrupt. A Station

officer trained a number of them in name tracing and travel control.. In

1958, at the instigation of a Mexican official, a joint telephone tap

operation came into existence.

LIENVOY, was run by a Mexican officer. The listening post had 30 lines

connected at one time. The transcription room was staffed by Mexican

Army officers. In 1961, because of mismanagement by the Mexican prin-

cipals, the Station chief, himself, became the project case officer. A

Station officer assisted him in the daily supervision of the listening

post, and in picking up the transcripts and the tapes.

There was also

an American technician inside the listening post.

3. Oswald Coverage:

In mid-1962, the Mexican officer in charge of LIENVOY (the

joint tap operation) asked the American officer at the LLENVoY listening

post for the telephone numbers of the Soviet, cuban satellite in

Soviet lines, three Czech lines, two Polish lines, and one Yugoslav

line. At the listening post, a live monitor made short summaries of

conversations of interest which were then included in

a daily resume

for the Chief of Station. Later, when a reel was completely recorded,

full transcripts were typed and passed to the Station; however, there

was usually a time lag

of a day or two. Reels which contained Russian

for translation and typing. Mr. Boris Tarasoff did the Russian transla-

usually ran about a week behind the date of the conversation.

As soon as the Station learned that an American identifying him-

Background on lexico Station Support Assets

(Coverage of Soviet and Cuban Embassies)

1. Unilateral coverage. Fron the time the lexico Station was opened in

April 1947 (by Bill Doyle) until arrival of Win Scott as

cos in 1955, Charles

Anderson III (still in LA/HQ) had developed a support apparatus to Faste

exoloit leads fron the Soviet Embassy. This umbrella type project (LIFEAT)

consisted of multi line phone taps, three photo sites, a mobile surveillance

team and a mail intercept operation.

a. Fhone taps were placed by an emaloyee of the telephone company

The number of lines

tapped was linted by availability of a listening post nearly.

those agents (most lon

or Mexican American) were related

it that time felt was good security in that

if they talked about shop, they would talk to each other.)

b. Three photo sites were handled by Anderson with the help

of Harry Vahoney (retired, living in Chicago) and TDY TSD

people checking the best type of canera, film, and concealment

devices. These had sub-cripts under LIFEAT (LIMITED, LILYRIC,

and LICALLA). LINITED was a fixed site bang opposite across

strictly on an

or erizental basis in the early stages. I think the lexi Station bought

one storey

this property (a/Sranish Colorial stone house) through LINOUSIE (check to

be sure). Later this house began to fall apart. This base was closed

when

the Station got word thet the photo of "uniden man" was being releasea

to the

public by the Warren Connission. The photo operators were moved to another apt

nearby. The property was sold (under an operational agreement with LINOUSINE

for a long term lease on the top floor of a new apartment biding to be built

on this site). LILYRIC was planned as an alternate photo base to LIMITED.

It was in an upper storey (3rd floor-check) on the sare side of the street

as LIITED but in the middle of the block South.

It had a slanted view of

the front gate of the Soviet Erbassy. The agents in LITED and LILYRIC (both

lexican farilies) as far as we knew, were not acquainted with each other.

LILTRIC was a rented apartment. LICAIIA, the third pacto fate,) was located

LOUSINE as the purchages lcheer), This site overlooked the back garden of

the Soviet Embassy complotia.

The purpose of this operation was to get good

identification photographs of the Soviet personnel (uno at thet time were largely

unidentified in Mexico Station records). Tre three photo sites were handled by

Ramon Alvarez (Mexican citizen of U.S, mother who taught elecentary level at

the American School). Ranon collected the film zellensest

In from LilIED

and LILYRIC three tines a week. His sister's husband, Carlos (flexican doctor)

developed and printed the film into 8x10 contact print strips. The master plan

to accumulate, the inside CO (l'aroney) becane disgusted and took the filn out

for Ramon's brother-in-law to process (probably early 1959). Thus Ranon became

the handler for all three photo bases.

During 1958, Wit Scott met socially some of the chronies of the

Mexican President elect, Adolfo Lopez lateos. During this period, the U.S.

Ambassador Robert C. Hill (reflecting the policy of then Sec State J.F. Dulles)

was energetic in organizing groups to "fight cormunisn". One of these seeds

grew into a proposal Miguel Aleman (jr. son of forner lexi President), acting

for Lopez lateos, made to Win Scott for a joint telephone tap operation. This

project (LIEVOY) went through about four distressing years of a shakedown.

The Mexican in control (LIELEGANT) was inexperienced, old, and greedy. His

son (LIENVOY-2) was a masterpiece of deceit and corruption.. LIELEGANT also

manipulated control over the principal agent of LIBIGHT mail intercept. The

for the telephone nunders of the Soviet, Cuban, and Satellite Embassies.

With this forevarning, LIFEAT (unilateral coverage) was disconnected. However,

as I recall, the Mexicans connected 5 Cuban lines, 5 Soviet lines, 3 Czech,

2 Polish, and 1 lugoslav line. The basehouse listening

post had a live

monitor tico made short summaries of interesting conversations for a daily

resume which was received each day arourd 8 a.1. (passed by Flick to Goodcasture

to get to Scott before 9.a.1.) Later (when the reel was

completely recorded)

full transcripts were typed and

passed to the station in the same way, however,

there was usually a time lag of a day or so. Those transcripts which rad

Russien or another language besides Spanish or English went out of the listening

post the day after the transcript (of other conversations.on the

reel)was

typed. These reels were taken to another locatien Mai

were translated

and typed. In the case of the Russien there

Boris Tarasoff usually ran

about a week behind the date af

aversation because of the volume of

Russian conversations

"embers of the Soviet Eubassy. During this

period (fall of 1963) the reels were probably being brought into the station

and carried to Boris by one of the people from the Soviet Section or they may

have been carried to him by Flick but I think I brought the reel in and gave

it to Herbert Manell to take to Boris. Herbert Manell and his wife Barbara

handled all of the processi:g of Soviet transcripts. Hy job involved screening

the photographs as soon as we learned that the man calling hinself Oswald was

probably an American. However, here again there was a backlag because the

photos were picked up three times a week but the ones ricked up were usually

for dates a few days prefiously because the doctor processed the film on a

night time basis. Photographs were made usually until one roll vas used but

later we got it changed to one day coverage on each roll - in other words the

roll of film exposed. Instructions were to cover office hours, photograch each

error did oscur but generally the agents were conscientious. The Cuban

embassy coverage had more sophisticated equipient (a pulse ca:era) but it

frequently develored nechanical difficulties. Bob Zambarnerdi and Scathar

(I think) handled this film - pick up and delivery. Lorna l'ackay screered

the film inside the station.

I am certain that the Oswald call came to our attention from the

Soviet line. It was picked us and taken to Boris for a translation because

the caller was trying to speak Russian. Any delay was caused by waiting to

compare the photographs with the typed transcript. There were no copies of

transcricts every made in languages other than Spanish or

At 1626 hours, A Soviet calls from the Soviet Embassy Chancery

the Cuban Consulate and asks for Sylvia DURAN.

DURAN if the american has been there.

DURAN: Yes, he is still here.

According to the letters that he showed them from the (Soviet)

Consulate

in Washington, he wants to go to the USSR to stay

a long time with his wife who is Russian, but also the

answer had not been received (by him regarding his problem.

That accordingly these transactions take 4 or

without prior approval from the USSR, they have to request

then, they could not issue the visa here (in Mexico

City) without asking Washington.

Yet accordingly

(the American),

showed him a letter in which he the man

American) is a member of an organizationtin favor of Cuba

and said that the Cubans could not give him the visa without

the Russian visa and now the Soviet doesn't know what to do

with him, because he has towar

for the answer from

Washington.

DURAN:

..with

them

also, beg

the problem with him (the American)

is that he

is very diffi

doesn'

anyone in Cuba and in that case

give him a visa, because he was

it

thinking of

cessing his visa, because he knew it was

going to take

a long time waiting for the Russian visa in

Cuba, and then go on to the USSR.

SOVIET:

..that the thing is that if his (the American) wife were

now in Washington (and) going to receive the visa right now

or the permission from the USSR to return to her country, (1f

she is going to receive her visa in Washington, then having

this visa, she can communicate to whatever place, this

permission, for example, here or in any other place (he) can

receive it, but right now they do not have them.

DURAN:

..certainly and neither can (the Cubans) give him a letter

because they do not know if the visa will be approved.

SOVIET:

DURAN:

SOVIET:

They can only give the visa according to instructions.

Then that is what she will put on his application.

Neither can I give him any letter of recommendation because

I don't know him and pardon me for bothering you.

Item 74, page 2

An unidentified man (speaking Spanish) calls the Soviet Embassy

Consulate at 1037 hours and asks for the Consul. He is told that

the Consul is not there.

The unidentified man asked what is needed

to get visas to go to Odessa. He is told to call back at 1130 hours.

Item 137, page 2

At 1235 hours a man named ALATRISTE (not a Soviet) from inside the

Soviet Embassy Consulate calls out to number 45-37-72 (Colonial

America, probably a pension or hotel but number not listed in the

telephone directory) and speaks with a man named SAN ROMAN.

ALATRISTE says that he is in the Russian Embassy and they need to

know what day the boat "KALONIA" will arrive in Odessa, that the

Soviets will also need copies of the passenger manifest....

(One concludes that ALATRISTE and SAN ROMAN are shipping representatives

for the boat

"KALONIA"', and needed routine visa information, First

a call was made to the

first listing for the Soviet Embassy in the

Mexican telephone directory (which turned out to be the Military Attache) •

They got the phone number for the Consulate and the address.

making a call to the Consulate and learning that it would not be open

until 1130 hours, ALATRISTE went to the address to get the needed

information.)

• Item 395, pages 7 and 8

Just after 1600 hours!

the Soviet Consulate received a call from the

Cuban Consulate (Sylvia DURAN)

who said she had there a U.S. citizen

who had requested a transit visa to Cuba because he is going to the

USSR. DURAN wants to know with whom he spoke at the Soviet Embassy

because she sent him over to them telling him that if the Soviets

approved the visa then the Cubans would give him one without anything

more, advising the (Department of) Immigration in Cuba.

She wants

to know with whom he spoke because he says that he doesn't know

either with what person and who told him that certainly there would

be no problem.

The Soviet asks DURAN to wait a minute.

After a

short wait DURAN explains the same thing to another Soviet. This

Soviet tells her to leave her telephone (number) and her name and

someone will return the call. DURAN gives her nane and telephone

number 11-28-47 then says as a personal thing, she has moved and

has not advised them of a change of address so will not receive their

Bulletin and can give it to them now.

The Soviet asks her to call

KOUKHARENKO in order to change that address and asks for the name

of the (Cuban) Cultural Attache.

DURAN says it is Teresa PROENZA

whose number is 14-13-26. The Soviet thanks her.

SILVIA DURAN, ONE IMPORTANT QUESTION STILL PUZZLES US

CHEN LEE

• 104/00

OSSALD WAS IN MEXICO CITY IN LATE SEPTEMBER ANEARLY OCTOBER TO

GET A SOVIET VISA AND A CUBANTRI

NSIT VISA, DID HE WANT TO TRAVEL

TO CUBA RIGHT AWAY, ALONE, OR HAVE HIS WIFE JOIN HIM THERE AND

THEN LEAVE FOR CUBA, OR DID HE PLAN TO RETURN TO THE STATES FIRST

AND THEN LEAVE LATER. ALTHOUGH IT APPEARS THAT HE WAS THEN THINKING

ONLY ABOUT A PEACEFUL CHANGE OF RESIDENCE TO THE SOVIET UNION,

IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT HE WAS GETTING DOCUMENTED TO MAKE A QUICK

ESCAPE AFTER ASSASSINATING THE PRESIDENT•

THE DIRECTOR OF INTELLIGENCE AND RESEARCH

SECRET

OCT 25 1960

Dear Dicks

Our efforts to answer recent informal inquiries, including

some.

from the white House Staff, have revealed that,

though CIA and

the

FBI have detailed records concerning Americans who have been recruited

as intelligence agents by Bloc countries,

there does not appear to be

a complete listing of those Americans now living in Bloc countries

who might be called "defectors".

Using the definitions of DID 4/2,

these persons might be described as those who have either been

capable of provicing useful intelligence to the Bloc or those whose

desire to resettle in Bloc countries has been significantly exploited

for communist propaganda purposes.

This would mean that no attention

need be paid to Americans whose resettlement within the Bloc had no

counter-intelligence implications or had attracted no particular

attention; for instance, this definition rould not cover individual

US citizens of East European or Chinese origin who returned to the

"homeland" because they had never been completely assimilated into

the American society.

There is attached a list of such persons, covering the last 18

months, and it would be appreciated if the Agency could verify and

possibly expand this list for the use of interested Bureaus of, the

Department.

Sincerely yours,

tand

The wife is being interrogated. I don't now if that took place jesterds

With regard to that, Nicaraguan's, allegations that the man was in the

he applied for a tourist card about the 15th of Segtemker. There is a

record showing entry into Mexico on Septenber 26. On about the 15th he

applied in New Orleans for a tourist cafe.

entering Mexico on the 2oth which very strongly suggests that be was not in Mexico

She says that in the Cuban Embassy there is a North

American who was at f

minute. Silvia DURAN speaks English with someone - and comments

in Spanish that they gave APARICIO telephone 14-12-99 and to take

the number down - Silvia DURAN then says the American

citizen is

going to talk with you, i.e., the Soviet. The American first

speaks Russian and the Soviet speaks English. They continue in

English. The American talks broken Russian and says I was

takes the phone and asks the American in English what does he want?

The American says please speak Russian. The Russian says what else

do you want? The American says I was just now at your Embassy and

they took my address. The Soviet says I know that.

The American,

in hardly recognizable Russian, says I did not know it then. I

went to the Cuban Embassy to ask them for my address, because they

have it. The Soviet says why don't you come again and leave your

address with us, it is not far from the Cuban Embassy. The Ameri-
