THiS 1S UNEVALUATED INTORMATION. SOURCE GRADINGS ARE OEFINITIVE APPRAISAL OF CONTENT 1S TENTATIVE

source, ~ A former Cuban_IS officer who served with the Cuban Intelligence
Service untit” 1 1964. ‘

1, Although there are many membors of the Direccion General de
Inteligencia (General Directorate of Intelligence - DGI) who
appear interested in and favorable toward:the Communist ‘Party,
Source knows of only three persons who are actually members:
Saul GONZALEZ, alias"Denis"; Manuel VEGA Perez, alias "Marcos
Viera"; and Felix SUAREZ; alias “Federico Santiesteban",
SUAREZ was a sert cf political adviser in the DGI operations
departments, but insisted he was not a commissar, but, rather,
a person in charge. Although Source and the other officers
would teaSe SUAREZ by calling him "Comisario", SUAREZ greatly
“Fesented the term and actually physically attacked Source for
doing so. Every Saturday morning at 8:30, SUAREZ held a
political indoctrination meeting which all personnel were
Supposed to attend. Source was habitually late to these
sessions, and althcugh he was given penalties for his obvious
disaffection, he never paid any attention to them. The DGI
personnel Source knew were perfectly willing to talk politics
among themselves but in a rather desultory way; the discussions
never went on very long.

2. Apparently during 1962, there had been considerable sentiment
for Anibal ESCALANTE ard his faction, the Partido Socialista
Popular (PSP), but in 1964 the PSP group was disrupted and
the real loyalty was to Fidel CASTRO rather than to ihe Party.

ESCALANTE, while he remained in Cuba, was apparently the
liaison officer between the DGI and the PSP. When ESCALANTE
left Cuba, the liaison between the DGI and the PSP was

taken over by Ramiro VALDES, as a CP member, and he was
described as a true representative. The DGI operated
strictly on orders from the Party, conveyed through VALDES.

Membership in the Partido Unido Revolucionaria Socialista
(PURS) made life easier and entry into the DGI more simple.
Between August 1963 and April 1964, all new personne] hired
by the DGI came from the Union de Joveres ‘Comunistas (Union
of Young Communists - UJC), which was PURS-oriented.
