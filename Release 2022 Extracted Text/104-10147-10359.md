MEMORANDUM FOR: Legislative Counsel

FROM

SUBJECT

: B. Hugh Tovar

Chief, Counterintelligence Staff

: Possible Identification of Person in

Photograph Released by the House Select

Committee on Assassinations

1.

On 30 July 1978 the House Select Committee on

posite drawings of persons who the committee hoped might

President John F. Kennedy and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr."

The photographs were shown on a newscast on Channel 5 (WTTG)

on 30 July.

CIA Career Associate Petr Sergeyevich Deryabin,

who saw the telecast, reported that the photograph showing

a profile view of a man is that of Nikolay Sergeyevich Leonov,

"journalist" known to Deryabin as a KGB officer.

2. The July-August 1976 edition of the Soviet publica-

Latinskaya Amerika contained an article entitled "To

Your Health! Fidel" by "journalist N. S. Leonov."

Written

in connection with Castro's 50th birthday, the article

praised Castro highly and implied a personal acquaintance

between Leonov and the Cuban leader.

It also briefly

mentioned that the CIA had planned "a physical liquidation

of F. Castro." Deryabin comments that he knows "journalist"

Leonov to be a KGB officer who has worked in Moscow

headquarters as well as in Mexico and Cuba. He believes

that Leonov's implied personal acquaintanceship with Castro

in fact stems from his official position as

a KGB officer.
