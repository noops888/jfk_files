CRYPTOGRAPHIC CLEARANCE - BRIEFING STATEMENT

1. I, (print)

¿emes P. O'Connell.

_ about to be

authorized to have custody of, access to, or knowledge of staff crypto-

graphic material or information of the Central Intelligence Agency, and

fully understanding that the preservation of the security of cryptographic

material or information 1s vital to the national interests of the United

States, do solemnly swear (or affirm) and declare without any mental

reservations whatsoever that I will protect the security of such material

or information to the best of my ability, and that I will not disclose

such material or information to any unauthorized person. I understand

that the only persons authorized to have custody of, access to, or knowl-

edge of staff cryptographic material or information of this Agency are

those who hold a current CIA cryptographic clearance and need the specific

material or information for the proper performance of their official

dutles.

2. I further swear (or affirm) that I will also protect to the

best of my ability the security of the cryptographic material or infor-

mation of other U.S. Government agencies should I gain possession or

knowledge of such material or information as the result of my perform-

3. I will thoroughly familiarize myself with the pertinent commu-

nications security, regulations, instructions, and principles which govern

the protection of cryptographic material or information.

I will at all

times provide the required degree of physical security in the handling

of the material to ensure that it does not fall into unauthorized hands

or be exposed to or otherwise be made known to unauthorized persons.

4. I have read the provisions of Public Law 513. I understand

that I am bound by that Act, both presently and also after the termina-

tion of my employment with the Central Intelligence Agency and/or the

revocation of my cryptographic clearance. I fully understand that im-

proper disclosure or loss of cryptographic material or information could

subject me to punishment under the provisions of that Act, or as provided

by the appropriate regulations and practices of the Central Intelligence

Agency.

5. 1 understand that a cryptographic clearance is not a permanent

clearance, that it will be revoked immediately should I fail to maintain

the required security standards, or for lack of need or for other sub-

stantial reasons. I understand

that revocation of my cryptographic clear-

ance bars me automatically from further access to cryptographic Informa-

tion, but does not release me from my obligation to protect the security

of cryptographic information, the knowledge of which I might still retain.
