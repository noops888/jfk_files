underline the diversive trends within the emigration end tend
to crystallize then; that a congress meeting under the banner of

“ demooraoy should be prepared to permit a demooratic expreseten
of opinion; and that” partioi pation in a meating of this kind
with rival groups would in no safize constitute endorsement or

YONCRANIKN OF CONVERSATICS
SUBJEOR: Congress for Cultural Freedoa

2, On 15 August, $ discussed the Berlin Cultural Congr
with Kenneth E. Harbley, with verticular éxphasie on the problea
of bringing the continuitg Congress organteation under control
and, at the sate tine, expardirg it into an effective anti-~

comminist wéapon: **

beciecee get ea to \Raibley our concern over the manner in ~
which Charles A. Skeges had condceted bisself during the Congress,
and Hozbley replied that he had deen equally coucerucd. Ee sald,
hovevor, that while Skeges activities bad cnused an unfavorable
reaction on the part-of a mmbér of the delegates, that reaction
had been more ‘directed against Skeggs personally than against hin
as-a representative of the goveraneat. Enabley agreed With my
uggestion that two bits of eilvér lining could be found ia the”

“ Skeges cloud, namely that ‘he had texen nost of the opposition

heat binself, ths spariag sone of our other pooplo, and that
he had ‘conducted ‘hinself like anything tut the "Polizolgpitzel®
tha. commnist préss.of Germany nage bin out to be. In fact,

“gata Bacbkey;" Skegés”ganeral attitude was such as to ‘cause Bone

of the delegates to disrencrber that Sxeggs vas attached to the.
governuent in any fashion or presuzably subject to any discipline

at all. .

3. Hambley, said that most of the dologétes with whon he
had talked vera perfectly willizg to accent the explanation that
the Congress was sailed upon by: the United States Goverment to
the exteit that sone official funds Vere suppliod for thé physical

".- gteging of “the meeting (as indeed they vere) but that the rest

of the money caio. fron somewhat verse unofficial sources in the
United States. Those vho suspected sorething more, with the
éxcention 6f the Trevor-Roper ¢rocp, vere generally heppy that,”
the Dnited States was ‘doing sonething of ¢his’kind and were ir
no mood to ask-any etbarraséing questions or raise any delicate |
points. : Ayers :

4. I asked Eotbley. what he: thought. bie futuro role: in the

Congress should be. He replied that he vag perfectly willing to

"ai activities we acked bin to wadertake but persomally,
felt he skosld retire into the beckerouné as rapidly as ‘possible.

suByEct: ~ Project “pxuiee

cle With reference to cy conversation with Mr. Baker concern-
ing the project outline covering the subjact project, I have approved
this project subject to the following condition. It nak
te ze that wé'-siould state In paragraph 6 under the heading of security
that all practicable zeasures will be taken to disguise the official
U. S$. interest, financial and othérvise; and at the same tine to pro-
vide; that one of the two'active sponsors will be Mr. Melvin J. Lasky,
editor-of the overt HICOG monthly mgazine "Der Monat.". I underotand” ~~
that Mr. Lasky ie needed as, one of the priicipal organizere and ope!
tives but I think it quite unnecessary for his name to be flourished
abcit ag a sponsor, After all, he is officially employed by HICOG-~
ke is, therefore, an acknowledged memer of tho U. 5. apparatus in
many. Why then should bis name be used? Reuter is an excellent
eponsor and surely it will be-possible to find one or more others=-
,Ron-dserican or at least non-official American--to serve as sponsora.

2. Generally in the eame connection I me that our con-
‘sultant, Mr. Burnhas, will operate ‘n the wings and that hie nege
will not be too prominently displayed. As the result of hia recent
book and. the furer of comminist conmentary, he 1¢ a "sitting duck"
for hostile propagania in ry opinion. I an entirely in favor of hia
participating extensively in the arrangements, but the wore hig par-
‘ticipation can be in the form of “off-stage shisperse” the better.

1.. Mhon Mr, Stribling's chop requested 0, at the behost of Fa
a cable requost of Kr: Hambley, to attexpt to appease’ Schiller tn ee
eonnectica. with his indignstion fer the manner in which kax Yergin,
tha Anerican Negro, had-doon handled in Berlin, Schiller reacted in
the manner described in ay earlior nenorandun on thie subject, which
wa 1o whole satisfactory. se ince received a complete re-
port. fea & reliable and competent observer at the Jerlin Congress

which Tam quoting below:

"on the wholé, the Congress has achieved ome useful resulte.
In % opinion, the test thing about the Congress vas that it vag
held in Berlin, A Congress in faric, in Switserland or tn any
otaer place would have had neither the ange political efzolficance
nor vould it have roceived the saze :udlicity. for the Herlinora,
tho fact that Berlin vac chosen as the meoting place wao renevod
, proof of Vestern solidarity vith their resistance ngainst the
i qauisaiit Rusos They nosd: euch presf again and again, eopocially in
view of the fact that they have a definite and Justified impression

_ ‘At a cortain eozent, the debates teck a very unfortumte

1) that labout 706 of tho delegatoa vere poogle who professed ‘i
socialist opinions; 2) that tho purpose of the Congress roqul:
that @ unity of all denocratic intellectuals, both socialists and
hon-eocinlists in the otruggle against totalitartanisn be euwphastsed
and 3) that tha chairman of tho Congrons sas “rnst Beater, head of
the social~denocrati¢ city governsent of derlin -- Koestlor’a attack
was absolutely out of place and sho:}d not have’ deon made regardl
of. whether he was right or not. Ae a aatter of fact, the paper in
question. proved-that Koestlor 19 mistaken {a assuming that a brilliant
Journaiiet and a succesoful rovelist 1s a9 iz8q qualified to play the
role of a philosopter, bfstorian ant sociologiot. In addition,
mistaken statements by British Labor regarding the problem of
Yuropean unity do'not Jrotify in my opinion the kind of vitriolic
all-out attack against the dritiah Labor Governmsnt which was made
ty Koestler who-seena to have forgotten, that, regardless vhat one
-may think of sone ofits polictes, British Labor 1s today one of the =
principal pillars of*the world dezoctatié front. :

‘Fyideatly Keeatlar's attack provoked tmcediste reaction on the
partlof the Socialist Congress dolegstea, beginning with Reuter who
vas in the chair, ‘In my opinion, this entire discussion vas completely
unneceauary. The British conservative . P,, Arery, showed mich
better judgeont than Kosotler by atudfedly avoiding in hie pronounce-
mente, any eriticisa of the Labor Government. If an attitudo oinilar
to that of Koeotler would have been adopted in the trade union field, :
the I.C.F.7.U. could not have beon created. As in the labor rovenent,
the organitation of intellectuals for. the defense of democracy cannot
be auccesafel unleso it to understood that decocratic socialion io a
poverfnl infiuencé azong the best intellectuals of Europe and Asia
and that, therefore, everything should be done to secure cooperation
of all derecratic forces in srite of all ideological differences. I
wae rather astonished tc find thyt irving scomed to like Koestle:
Giecourse on eoctaliax. I spoke with quite a number of dologates and

foutd that they didn't like it at all.

®Tnetead of appointing on the firet and second days of the Congr
a resolution Comittee vhich would have been able to vork sericuely

‘,on any draft resolutions, proposals and suggestions made dy the

delogates, a draft muntfocto and draft résolution vore aubaitted te a

Subjects Information From Mr. MELVIN LASKY Concerning the i
Berlin Congress :

l.. I attach (a) a copy of the letter received from t
MELVIN LASKY, (bd) a list which he prepared of the expected

American delegates .at the Congross, (c) together with three A
additions to the British list.

2. IASKY evidently moans the American list to be ee ht a
definite as of this date. However, according to ay information, fa
: _) at least two or three of the delexates whom he lists are still \
~ uncertain; for example, SIDNEY-HCOX and DAVID LILIENTHAL,

i
\
3. Trio idea of a strong Soviet delegaticn, gathered
fron Western Germany seems to mo excellent, and capable of riajor H
exploitation as we noted yesterday. However, it does not seem to
require SHUB's presence in Germany.

ka “I don't know. exactly wtiat arrangenents LASKY has in
mind for contimulng the paynenta necessary to maintain the New
York office, One sentence in thie letter suggests that he plaas «.
to maka payment from Berlin, This matter ought to be olarified
imediately.

5. You will note in tho LASKY letter the addredé and
telephone number of the. New York office.

‘The underaigned called upon Profeseor Hook at his home, 696-A Third

precent. i

, Profescor Hook oponed the converaation ty exphasiaing the need to

+ essential to retain tho op;osrance. of a conplotaly private senturo, I
assured hia thia rae elso the Departzent's view, Referring to tho statue
* of Unlvin J, laoky, oscretary of tha Congress in Berlin, as an ezployee.
of HICCG, Profousor Hook then said he thought itr. Laaky shold be given -
‘a leave of absonco in order to carry through. the project in-a private.
capacity. I promised to look into thie probles, and ecemented that it
gould not be done readily without Mr, Losky's cooperation. I also :

a. The communist youth mass meoting planned for Ferlin during. the
Whitsun holidays, 27, 28, and 29 tay, has been and ds the subject of a
uajor- propsganda offensive ty the Rugsians and by Germsa comuunists.

It has follcwed the characteristic Soviet pattern of creating confusion

and ‘tenseness on the part of the propaganda targets achieving’ this ‘ob-  -™
- jective ty alternating belligerent threats.with. neaceful, platitudes.

The threats have ranged fron doclarations that the conmunigt youtn would
stern imperialists out cf Berlin to outright statements that
they would seize the western Eerlin governnont and restore ‘the city to
a unified, peaceful capital of Germany. The peaceful declarations. have
stated that the demonstration of 559,900 toys and girls (from all over
Gerneny, and fron other countries) vill chiefly take place in Eastera
iP Berlin and will consist of rally-sarching, sports evects, firoworks, and zs
al huge ceace’ meetings. Peraisaion was requested ty the FDJ, of Oberburger- :
S * meister Reuter, ‘to march in a bod7 to. the Olympic Stadium (in the Eritish
