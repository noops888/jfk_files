TESTIMONY OF RICHARD N, BISSELL

Mr. Baron. Mr. Bissell, since we have talked with you
last about the subject of the Congo we have taken. testimony
from a number of witnesses. ghe first that we would like to
turn to is Bronson weedy, who in 1960 and 1961, as I am
sure you will recall, waa the Chief of the African Division.
He indicated to us in his testimony that he had a number of
talks with you, probably in the summer or fall of 1960,

where the prospect of assassinating Lumumba wae raised.

what can you tell us about those discussions?

Mr, Bissell. 1 am afraid I can't tell you anything.

r don't remember the specific discussions with him, Tt seems:

to me, however, entirely to be expected that such conversa

tions took place. I think T testified previously, but in any »
case, I remember assigning Justin O'Donnell to study

the possibilities and to make plans for the assassination or
elimination of Lumumba, And since that was in the Africa
area, I think ‘it most unlikely that I would have done that
without saying something to the pivision Chief about it.

Mr, Baron. Mr- Tweedy's testimony was to the effect
that he was in fact not being informed of some on-going
operation or some instruction that was contemplated, but
rather that you and he were discussing the feasibility of
assassinating Lumumba.

Did such discussions take place?

Mr. Bissell. I don't happen to remember them, but
it seems to me entirely probable that they did. And if he
said so I would certainly accept that.

Mr. Baron. And would you assume that if such dis-
cussions took place they would have taken place in the summer
or fall of 19607

Mr, Bissell. Yes.

Mr. Baron. Would such discussions have involved planni
for an actual assassination mission?

Mr, Bissell. Yes, planning for, but not necessarily
any authorization to take specific steps to implement such
a plan.

Mr. Baron. Would planning discussions in the sense
that you are using the term included sending instruments of
assassination to the Congo?

Mr. Bissell. They might have, although again I
don't happen to remember that. I am aware, I think, that
there is a record that something was said, but I had no
recollection that things went that far. But that still could
have been included in what I mean by the term “planning and
preparing”.

Mr. Baron. Did you give Mr. Tweedy any specific
instruction as to steps he Was to take to further a plan
to assassinate Lumumba?

Mr, Bissell. I may have. I don't remember them. The

only clear recollection 1 have is of what I think was
the initial discussion on this matter that I had with Justin
O'Donnell. And I believe that he and I had that alone, in
other words, that Mr. Tweedy was not present in the dis-
cussion I had with O'Donnell.

Mx. Baron. We will turn later to filling out the
details of your conversation with Justin 0’Donnel?

For the moment, sticking with Mr. Tweedy's testimony,
he also testified that during this same period of time he

composed cables that went to the Chief of Station in Leopold-

i
:

\

ville inquiring at to ifthe Chief of Station could gain acces$
to Lumumba for the purpose of assassinating him.
pid you send such cable?
we, Bissell. I would think the record would show
whether they were sent. If they were waent the record would
presumably also show if T signed them. And I expect that
if they were sent I would have signed them. Sut I don't
happen at this distance in time to remember the specific
cables.
Mr. wides. T£ you had sent cables of that kind,
Mr. Bissell, would ‘they have gone in the normal channels out
from the African Division, of might they more likely have
gone on a restricted basis from yourself to the Station
Chief without --

“Mr. Bissell. 1 think it is very probable that it would

have been the latter, although given the fact of conversations
with the Division Chief, presumably he would have been on the
distribution for these cables. But probably it would have
paan restricted to the Director or the Deputy Director or
the Division Chief, and probably Mr.Helms puty.

Mr, Baron. It was Mr. Tweedy's testimony that although
he composed such cables, they went out, as far as he could

recall, under your signature ox from your office.

Mr, Bissell. ‘That would be a very normal procedure.

Mr. Baron. De you recall discussing with Mr. Tweedy
the fact that he should write such cables, whether or not you
recall the specific cables?

Mr. Bissell. I really don't.

Mr. Baron, Mr. Tweedy also testified that the cable
traffic that he was sending ‘to the Congo was part of a back and
forth communication in which he was receiving information fromi
tne Chief of Station in Leopoldville about the kind of :
access that he could gain to Lumumba.

pid you read such cables from the Chief of Station in
Leopoldville?

Mr. Bissell. I am sure I did. I don't remember it
specifically. ’

Mr. Wides. Do you recall the question of access
being one part of the exploration that you were doing?

Mr. Bissell. Yes, that indeed would have been a key

TOP SECRET

part of it.

Mr. Wides, Do you recall that being s07

Mr. Bissell. I don't specifically recall it. But
since I am clear that at least in the case of O'Donnell, and
I now presume in the case of Mr. Tweedy, I authorized and
indeed directed this planning and preparatory activity. A
major part of this would have been a search for ways in
which access could be gained,

Mr. Baron, And what kind of access were you looking
for at that time?

Mr. Bissell. Obviously I would aay the access of an
individual who for one reason or another could get close to
Lumumba.

Mr. Baron, In the summer and very early fall of 1960
this would have been access to Lumumba for the purpose of i
assassinating him rather than snatching him from U.N. custody?

Mr, Bissell, Well, it could have been for the pur-
pose really of eliminating him from his tneyfo itical acti-

vities. And that could have been assassination, or it

“could have involved some form of incapacitation, or it could

possibly have been, in your words, snatching him so
that he could be put into the custody of what we regarded
as friendly authorities.

Mr. Baron. Would you have sought information from

the Chief of Station on whether he could gain access to

TOP SECRET



Lumumba for the purpose of poisoning Lumumba.

Mr. Bissell. It could very well have. That was one
method of elimination, and that was obviously thought about
at the time as part of the planning, and almost certainly

would have been in touch with the Chief of Station to see
if he could gain accese for that purpose.

Mr. Baron. Were you alao in touch with the Chief of
Station to seek access for the shooting Lumumba?

Mr. Bissell. I would guess that really the questions

to the Chief of Station would have had to do with gaining access

for whatever method -~ an access that could be used for
whatever method of eliminating Lumumba might be ainple,
practical and workable. And I doubt if the question would
have been a different one, depending on the device or weapon
to be used.

Mr. Baron. {To retrace something you said a moment
ago, if Mc. Tweedy had authored cables seeking information
from the Chief of Station in Leopoldville about gaining
access to Lumumba, you would have approved such cables?

Mr. Bissell. Yes, I would most certainly have.

Excuse me. Let me elaborate on that.

Given the procedures and relationships in effect,.1
think Mr. Tweedy, on the basis of an oral authorization from
me, would have had the authority to send such a cable without

my signing off on it. But in a matter of this sensitivity

TOP SECRET



r think :it highly likely that he would have drafted the
cable, initialed it and sent it to my office for dispatch.
Mr. Baron. And you wouldn't dispute hie testimony that |
he did so?
Mr. Bissell. Oh, no. Hia testimony seemed to me to be

absolutely consistent with my recollections, which, alas,
att
are somewhat inform. indir:

Mr. Baron. Would your discussions with Mr. Tweedy have!

|
Involved discussing the possibility of poisoning Lumumba? \

Mr. Bissell. I suppose 50+

Mr, Baron. We have also taken teatimony from the man
who was Chief of Station in Leopoldville during this period of,
time, from mid-summer of 1960 throughout 1961, and he testified--

Mr. Bissell. Would you remind me who it was? ‘

Mr. Baron, Off the record for a moment.

(Discussion off the record.)

Senator Hart of Colorado. Back on the record.

Mr. Baron. While we were off the record we explained
the arrangement under which the Chief of Station would
testify before the Cor ittee under alias. And we will refer
to him here today as.the Chief of Station, or by his alias,
which is that of Victor Hedgman. ;

Mr. Bissell, when the Chief of Station testified before
us he indicated that at some point in the late summer or

early fall of 1960 probably toward the latter part of August

TOP SECRET

or the very first days in September, he received a cable from
CIA headquarters to the effect that a messenger wili come

to the Congo who you will recognize, and who will bring in-=
structions which you are to carry out.

pid you send such @ cable to the Chief of Station?

Mr. Bissell. I could have.

put I have perhaps a peculiar reason for questioning
whether in this particular case I did. And my reason is
the following.

You will notice that the cable you have just shown me
that was sent out by the Director of Central Intelligence in
late August, the cable was released by his initials. And
it bears the notification that the only other distribution
was to be to Mr. Helms, who was then, you will remember,
Deputy -- my deputy.

Now, it is virtually inconceivable to mey given my
knowledge of and involvement in this operation, that the
Director would have sent a cable, denied circulation to me
and had it circulated to Mr. Helms, if I had been in
Washington. And I suspect that we could establish on the
record that I was on vacation when the message you have shown
me was sent.

Mr. Wides. That was in early August?

Mr. Baron. Let's introduce as Exhibit No. 1 for

this session the document that you are referring to, which

is a cable dated Auguat 26, 1960, from Allen W. Dulles to
Leopoldville. And this cable includes the paragraph:

“In high quarters here it is the clear-cut conclusion
that if LLL continues to hold high office inevitable result
will at best be chaos and at worst pave the way for Communist
takeover of the Congo with disastrous consequences for the
prestige of the U.N. and for the interest of the free world
generally. Consequently, we conclude.that his removal must
be an urgent and prime objective, and that under existing
conditions this should be a high priority of our covert action

(The document referred to was :

Mr. Baron. Mr. Bissell, would LLL refer to Lumumba

which are blurred in the copy we have?

Mr. Bissell. They may be there, but in any event, the
releasing signiature is definitely his.

If 1 may complete the answer to your question, for the
reason I have given you, my surmise is that T was not
in Washington, and probably on vacation, when this was
sent. I suspect that I might be able to dig out calendars
and establish that if it became very germane.

If that is the case, it is quite possible that the
cable you asked me about stating that a messenger would
soon arrive in Leopoldville was sent also in my absence.

Mr. Baron. If such a cable was sent in your absence
would you be apprised of it upon your return to headquarters?

Mr. Bissell. I suspect so, yes. In this case I would

be almost certain that I would.

TOP SECRET



Mr. Baron. And what would such a cable have referred

Mr. Bissell. Well, I suppose just what that said.

Prone (Ares 202) $44-£000

Explicitly it refers, as you quoted, or characterized it, to
a messenger with instructions to be followed.

Mr. Baron. And who was that messenger to be?

Mr, Bissell. I have no idea without digging back into thd

traffic.

Mr. Baron. And were those instructions ralated to
the assassination of Lumumba?

Mr. Bissell. It certainly sounds as if they were
related to his elimination in one way or another.

Mr, Wides. Why is that, Mr. Bissell?

Mr, Bissell. Just because the method of transmission

is peculiar, and suggests.high sensitivity, But it seems

to me, on the basis of what you hve told me of the message,
it can be only inference.

Mr, Baron. And one means of eliminating Lumumba con-
templated at CIA headguarters at this time would have been
an assassination?

Mr. Bissell. Yes.

Mr. Baron. In the testimony of the Chief of Station
who was in Leopoldville at that time, he made the representa-
tion -- let me back track for a moment.

Did you ever discuss with Sidnéy Gottlieb the assassination

of Lumumba?

Mr. Bissell, I think it is very probable that I did.

Mr. Baron. What would these discussions. have involved?

Mr. Wides. Excuse me. Was Mr. Gottlieb at that time
science advisor to yourself?

Mr. Bissell. I believe he was. I would answer that
question definitely if the record shows that he had not yet
taken that position. But I am almost sure -- I had better
not say that. Assuming that he had assumed the position .

of science advisor, I think that my answer would stand, that

I very probably would have consulted with him.

Mr. Bissell. No, he was not. His assignment to my
office was hia full time and sole responsibility.

Mr. Baron. And you say that you probably did dis-
cuss with Sidney Gottlieb the assassination of Lumumba.

What would have been the substance of those discussions?

Mr. Bissell, It would have been discussing with him
possible weapons or other means to use. When he was my
science advisor, I frequently used him as in effect liaison
with the Technical Services Division, the person who had

been a member of it. And he knew the personnel and he knew

a great deal about their programs. I presume that if I had

TOP SECRET

had such iacuasions with him I would have been asking him to
give thought to ways and means.

Mr. Baron. And you were asking Mr, Gottlieb, then,
to think about the technical means by which an assassination
could be carried out?

Mr. Bissell. Correct.

Mr, Wides, That is an assumption that you were, or

can you recall now?

Mr. Bissell. No, it is an assumption -- it is an in-

|
ference, if you like, from the circumstances. I think it ist

quite likely that I would have had such discussions with him;
assuming, as I believe to be true, that he-waa the acience
advisor at that time.

Mr. Wides. But you have no recollection?

Mr. Bissell. No.

Senator Hart of Colorado: Excuse me, Mr. Baron.

I am going to have to go to vote, and I would just
like the record to reflect your acquiescence that there is
no committee member here if in fact that is the case

Mr. Bissell. I do so acquiesce, and I am happy to
continue.

Senator Hart of Colorado. With that understanding
you are willing to continue?

Mr. Bissell. Yes.

Senator Hart of Colorado. Thank you very much.

TOP SECRET



Mr. Baron. Did you have oy Sther kinds of discussiong
‘with Sidney Gottlieb about the assassination of Lumumba?

Mr. Bissell. None that I remember,

Mr. Baron. Did you discuss with Mr. GottiLeb your
conversations with Justin O'Donnell?

Mr. Bissell. I just have no recollection of that.

Mr. Baron. Did Mr. Gottlieb come to you and report to
you on his conversations with Justin O'Donnell about the

assassination of Lumumba?

Mr, Bissell, Again, I am sorry, I just have no

recollection one way or the other.

Mr. Baron, Did Mr. Gottlieb make you aware that he had!
dn his shop, or he knew how to obtain the means to assassin-
ate Lumumba?

Mr. Bissell, Well, I certainly was aware in a general

way that various means were available in the Technical

Services Division. I don't know whether I obtained that
information specifically fronMr. Gottlieb, but probably I
did obtain some of it through him.

Mr. Baron, But however you obtained this information,
you were aware that the means were available to assassinate
Lumumba?

Mr. Bissell. I think you put it too specifically.

I was aware that as part of it is on-going activity. The

Technical Services Division did a lot of work in the develop

ment of various weapons of a sort appropriate for a clandes-

tine service. And I was aware, I am quite certain, that
these included poisons, type of firearms, and a whole range
of capabilities. But my belief today, and my recollection,

ia that I-was aware of these as the products, I repeat, of

an on-going development program which itself was not targetted
at any type individual or operation.

Mr. Baron. And with whom did you have discussions of
technical means that might be used to assassinate Lumumba
other than Sidney Gottlieb?

Me, Bissell. I do not know. I could have had with
Mr. Roosevelt, whom I think was still the head of the Techni-
cal Division. _ IX don't believe it would have been any but
those two.

Mr. Baron. This would be Cornelius Roosevelt?

Mr, Bissell. That is correct.

Mr. Baron, Did Mr. Gottlieb express to you hi's
reluctance to participate in an assassination plan?

Mr. Bissell. I don't ever remember his so doing.

Mr. Baron. pid Mr. Gottlieb appear to be willing to
see what he could do to obtain or develop the means to be
used in such a plan?

Me. Bissell. 1 really don't have any recollection that
would enable me to answer that. I do believe that -- if

he had demurred strongly, and urged its abandonment, or

TOP SECRET



Pmone (Ares 2021 $44.6000

opposed it, I think it is likely that I would have remembered
that position on his part, because I do remember very clearly
Justin O'Denneli's reaction, And since I don't remember

any such negative reaction from Mr. Gottlieb, my inference is
that there probably was none.

Mr. Baron. The Chief of Station in Leopoldville at
that time further testified to us that in very early
September he received a visit from Sidney Gottlieb in the
Congo.

Did you sent Mr. Gottlieb to the Congo at that time?

Mr. Bissell. Probably, if he went there, I certainly
would have been fully knowledgeable of it.

Mr. Baron, And you would have approved his visit?

Mr. Bissell. Yes. :

Mr. wides. Particularly if this occurred when he was
your science advisor.

Mr. Bissell. Right.

Mr. Wides. Is it correct that he would only have
gone there pursuant to your direction?

Mr. Bissell. Correct.

Mr. Baron. What were Mr, Gottlieb's instructions, or
what was his mission at that time?

Mr, Bissell. I do not know.I can draw inferences from
the circumstances that have already been mentioned.

Mr. Wides. In the course of his duties as your science

“TOP SECRET
advisor, did he take fraquent trips abroad?

Mr. Bissell. I would say infrequent. It seemed to me
there were one or two others,

Mr, Wides. ' Would these trips be involved with
highly sensitive operations as distinct from scientific
evaluation?

Mr, Bissell, TI believe that for the most part they
would not have been involved with highly sensitive specific
operations, but rather would have involved consultation with
people in the field on the effectiveness of devices, tech-
niques, procedures, underdevelopment in the Technical
Services Division,

Mr. Wides. And given the unusual of his going to the
Congo if he did in connection with clandestine operations
there, you would have no recollection of that today?

Mr, Bissell. I don't have any recollection of that
today, no. This is the first time I realized, since many
years ago, that he had made such a trip.

Mr. Baron, Would he also have been aware that he

“had made such a trip?

Mr. Bissell. Well, the Chief of Station obviously,
Bronson Tweedy, obviously. Quite probably the Director,
but not certainly, And several others.: I assume that Mr.
Helms would have known about it at the time, because there

would have been some kind of cable traffic, and I strongly

TOP SECRET

suspect that Cornelius Roosevelt would have known
about it.

Mr. Baron. Did Mr. Gottlieb's trip have anything to do
with the assassination of Lumumba?

Mr. Bissell. I don't know, since I don't remember the
circumstances, I really can't say.

Mr. Baron, Would you assume that Mr. Gottlieb's trip
have had something to do with the assassination of Lumumba?

Mr. Bissell. I think it might very well:

Mr, Baron. And again we are talking about the plot
to assassinate Lumumba rather than Lumumba's ultimate demise

Mr, Bissell. Correct.

Mr, Baron.If Mr. Gottlieb's visit related to the plot
to assassinate Lumumba, would such a sensitive operation

,have been made known to Bronson Tweedy?

Mr. Biasell. I believe so, specially in the light
ef the fact that apparently this possibility had been dis-
cussed with Bronson Tweedy more than once.

Mr. Baron, Is it possible that Bronson Tweedy would
have been cut out of the actual mounting of an assassination
operation despite the fact that the feasibility of an
assassination had been discussed with him?

Mr. Bissell. Yes, it is possible.

Mr. Baron. Was that the case?

Mr. Bissell. I don't remember. But if you ask me to

guess, I think I would I think my gueasing would come down
slightly on the side of his having been cut out rather than
knowledgeable.

Mr. Baron, Why would that be?

Mr. Bissell. Well, I repeat, I am guessing about this,
and the reasoning that leads me to make that remark is that
my recollection is that my assignment to O'Donnell was very

narrovly held. And I do not remember discussing that assign-

ment with Bronson Tweedy. And so I think there is a real
possibility -- and it is a guess, trying as beet I can to recan-
struct what was going on at the time, but not based on any
vecollection of actual discussions -- but my guess, as I say, :
would come down very slightly on the side that 0’Donnell’s
assignment was not known to Bronston Tweedy, and that he, there~
fore, was cut out of this phase.

Mr. Baron. And would have been cut out of knowledge
of Gottlieb’s viait to the Congo?

Me. Bissell. Could have been, although that is
more unlikely. Tt seema to me that if he was being cut out
of knowledge of the ‘specific operation, that he would have
nad to be knowledgeable of the visit, and would have Peen
given an explanation of the visit other than the postulated
true explanation.

Mr. Baron. In the light of that, Mr.Bissell, is it

likely that the cable traffic that Mr. Tweedy describes going

back and forth between himself and the Chief of Station

in the Congo concerning gaining access to Lumumba could have
unbeknownst’ to him related to gaining acceags to Lumumba for

the purpose of an assassination plot that waa further along

the line than Mr. Tweedy knew?

Mr. Bissell. It could have. I would put it another
way. It seems to me that the information gleaned in that
interchange was probably an input to the planning -- the prep-*
atory activity that identity with O'Donnell.

Mr. Baron. To repeat for a moment, Gottlieb's
visit to the Congo would have been known to the Chief of Sta-
tion, yourself and Director of Central Intelligence, and
possibly Bronson Tweedy?

Mr, Bissell. I think probably Bronson Tweedy, and
almost certainly a few other people. I repeat, I think
Cornelius Roosevelt would have known of it. I think Richard
Helms would have knwon of it, and I think several others
I am making a distinction between those who would have known
of the visit, an event that would not be easy to keep secret
from a number of people in the Agency, and knowledge of the
true purpose of that visit, if indeed its true purpose were,
as was suggested.

Mr. Baron, Did you have any discussion with Richard
Helms about the assassination of Lumumba?

Mr. Bissell. I don't remember ~~ wait a minute. No,

TOP SECRET



I believe I:did not with Mr. Helms.

Mr, Baron. You paused for a moment there. Was there
some discussion that you were thinking about that could have
related to Lumumba?

Mr. Bissell. Yes.

I think what came into my mind was a later and
subsequent conversation with Mr. Helms sometime after.
And this had to do with O'Donnell, and I seem to remember
Mr. Helms making a remark that he was a somewhat -- on
occasion a somewhat unsable person, And at that point the sub-
ject may have come up with Mr. Helms. But ny impression is :
that any such conversation with Mr. Helms was a good deal

later.

Mr. Wides. Mr. O'Donnell indicated that after he spoke

to you and told you that he would not participate in the

assassination effort, that he went essentially nextdoor to

your office, to Mr. Helms' office, and recounted his dis~
cussion with you to Mr. Helms.

Do you recall any discussion about that time that
Helms might have come back to you to find out about?

Mr. Bissell. Let me explain, the dim recollection
that I have just voiced of a conversation with Helms after
the termination of O'Donnell's assignment, and Helms comment
on it. But I still believe that Mr.Helms did not know of

this until after what I would refer to as the termination of

O'Donnell's involvement, which was. the occasion you have just
referred to.

Mr. Wides. It was not described by Mr. O'Donnell as
the termination of an assignment.

Mr. Bissell. All right, that 4s my phrase, but as I
have already testified, my recollection -- and it is recollec-
tion -- is that Mr. O'Donnell came in to me -- I thought it :
was a matter probably of at least several weeks, but I
could be wrong on the timing -- after I had originally
given him the assignment, and expressed both his personal
reluctance to attempt to carry it out, and his belief that
it was the wrong way to proceed. Whether he so stated to Mr.
O'Donnell, it certainly was my decision at that time that it
be dropped, And to the best of my knowledge and belief,
no further action was taken.

Mr. Schwarz. By “it” in that example do you mean the
assassination of Lumumba, or O'Donnell's involvement in the
assassination of Lumumba?

Mr. Bissell. At any rate, O'Ponnell's involvement
the project that he had been asked to pian and prepare for,
that that would not be continued.

Mr. Baron. And that was the assassination of Lumumba?

Mr. Bissell. Yes. ;

Mr. Schwarz, You mean one officer comes in and gives

you a negative; and then you decided to turn off something

TOP SECRET



that you had been looking into for weeks because
officer says he wouldn't do it?

Mr, Bissell. To turn it off, or at least if it be

Prone 1Aree 202) 544-6000

continued, to change not only the people connected with it, but

probably the whole modus operandi, And the reason for that
decision, theofar ae I can recollect ft, 4s, my grave concern
that, given O'Donnell's reaction, there was a risk that the
planning of such an operation would be blown.

Mr. Schwarz. You mean if it was done he would expose

the conversation?

Mr, Bissell. Something of that kind could happen,

Mr. Dawson. Who were you worried about O'Donnell in
that case exposing it to? Certainly not the press.
Mr. Bissell. I can't recally answer that, except by

surmise, but I do remember that this had been in my mind

a very sensitive assignment to him, limited -- with the
knowledge of it to be limited very narrowly even within the
Agency. And it is difficult to separate recollection from
inference on occasion. But I seem to recollect that after
this conversation with him I wanted this put very much on
the back burner and inactivated for quite some time.

Now, that doesn't rule out the possibility that some
action through completely different channels might have gone

forward, But the best of my recollection is, I viewed this

not only as terminating the assignment for him, but also
as reason for at least postponing anything further along that
line.

assignment to O'Donnell and its. true'purpose.

Mr. Bissell. IT would guess that ~~

Mr. Bissell. I don't know. What I was going to Say is

that I think the Director did.

Mr. Schwarz. Guess, think, don't know, You have got to!
have a basis, Mr. Bissell, for testifying to something-

Mr. Bissell. All right.

The bafis is, as has been in so much of my testimony,
how business was conducted within the Agency at that time.
There had been, as the Fxhibit 1 cable suggests, there had
already been consideration at high levels in the Agency and
elsewhere of the elimination of Lumumba: Obviously I had
been involved in conversations with the Director on that sub-
ject. Given the way business was conducted, I would infer that
y would have told the Director of my assignment to O'Donnell.

Mr. diGenova. Mr, Bissell, you are telling us that
you don't remember this, is that correct?

Mr. Bissell. ghat is right

Mr. diGenoya. You have seen this Exhibit No. 1 which

“In high quarters here it is the clearcut conclusion
that if LLL continues to hold high office inevitable result
will be chaos". +

And then it goes on and says:

“Consequently we conclude that his removal must be an
urgent prime objective and that under existing conditions
this could be a high priority covert action”.

That is dated August 26, 1960, signed, according to your
identification of his signature, by Mr, Dulles personally.

And it follows by one day a meeting in the white House of the

Special Group attended by the President of the U.S., where
Dulles said he would procéed --

Mr. Baron. I don't think this meeting was attended by
the President.

Mr. diGenova. Excuse me, attended by Mr. Dulles --
where he said he would proceed as vigorously as the situation
permitted, And it was agreed that the planning for the
Congo would not necessarily rule out consideration of any
particular kind of activity which might contribute to getting
rid of Lumumba.

Does that in any way refresh your recollection about
what was happening at that time?

Do you remember anything independently of what Mr.
Dulles was talking to you about? We had trouble areas in the-

world, including Cuba, and the African Continent in particular:

TOP SECRET



prone (Ares 202) $44-£000

Does that refresh your recollection -in any way
independently?

Mr. Bissell. Well, my recollection, I think, is
pretty clear about the atmosphere at the time. And I think
it is quite ‘eloquently described in the cable which you
have just quoted. And I have already said that I think
probably, from the evidence of the format of that document,
Twas absent from Washington at the time when it was sent.
put I certainly would have seen that when I returned, and
it certainly would have been the subject of conversation
between Dulles and myself. 1¢ is for that reason that T
draw the inference that Justin otponnell's assignment would
have been reported by me to Allen Dulles.

Mr. diGenova. But you personally don't remember
discussing this with Mr. Dulles?

Mr. Bissell. No.

Mr. diGenova. You conclude now that you must have be-
cause of the physical evidence?

mr. Bissell. Could I just interrupt for a moment to
say, I used to see Mr. Dulles almost daily during’ these years.
It was rare that we would meet without touching on perhaps
sever} on-going operations oF plans or prospects. And this,
over a period of several years. It is not, I think surpris-

ing that rarely have I been able in the course of my testi-

mony to say, f specifically remenber a particular meeting, and

TOP SECRET



even roughly what was sid of it.
Mr, diGenova. Mr. Bissell, that is somewhat important
obviously, because the idea is to try, if possible, to estab-

lish what the precise facts were.

bmone (Ares 202) 544-6000

Now, I am sure you don't mean to say that the assassina- |
tion of a foreign leader blurs into the everyday activity of !
the Agency because it was so commonplace -- or is that what
you mean to say? .

Mr. Bissell. No, I don't. But I do mean to say
that; the Agency had put a top priority, probably, on a range
of different methods of getting rid of Lumumba in the sense
of either destroying him physically, incapacitating him, or
eliminating his political influence. And a conversation

about this particular facet of what was a many-sided attack on’

the problem doesn't stand out in my mind.

Mr, diGenova, What you are saying, then, is the de-
tails of any specific day or meeting or cable you don't
recollect, but you don't have any trouble recollecting the
fact that the assassination of Lumumba, among others,
was part of a strategy at that time, if needed?

Mr. Bissell. Yes.

Mr. Baron. And that was part of a strategy at the
level of the National Security Council as well as within the
AGency?

Mr. Bissell. I believe that the language quoted would

so indicate, yes.

Mr. Schwarz. Did you attend any meeting of the National
Security Council?

Mr. Bissell, I don't remember any on this subject,
and I don't think I did. I very rarely attended the NSC
as such, or its so-called planning committee. Robert Amory
was the agency representative on that, and I have already
said -- well, I did not by any means always, I would say not

more than half the time, attended Soecial Group meetings.

And since I also think Iwas out of town when that was
sent, it seems to me highly unlikely that I was at the Special,
Group meeting the day before that cable was sent.

Mr, Baron. I think we should introduce for the record
as Exhibit 2 the memorandum for the record of that
Special Group meeting of August 25, 1960, which records Mr.
Dulles being present, and does not list yourself as one of
the participants. And it contains a paragraph substantially
as Mr, diGenova related it where Gordon Gray, who was at
that time Special Assistant to the President for National
Security Affairs, commented that his associates -- and we have
testimony by Thomas Parrott, the Secretary who took these
minutes, that Mr. Gray's associate was a euphemism to refer to
the President.

Mr. Bissell. Correct.

Mr. Baron, "Mx. Gray commented that his associates
had expressed extremely strong feelings on the necessity for
very straightforward action in thia situation, and he wondered
whether the plans as outlined were sufficient to accomplish
this.

"Mr. Dulles replied that he had taken the comments re- |
ferred tw seriously, and had every! intention of proceeding as |
vigorously as the situation permits or requires, but added that

he must necessarily put himself in a position of interpret- |

ing instructions of this kind within the bounds of necessity j;

and capability. It was finally agreed that planning for the
Congo would not necessarily rule out 'consideration' of any
particular kind of activity which might contribute to
getting rid of Lumumba".

Then the next day after this meeting Mr. Dulles
sends out the telegram or the cable that we have already
discussed.

Mr. Bissell, Right.

Me. Baron. Would you assume that Mr. Dulles'cable,
which was sent to Leopoldville, was a direct outgrowth of
this meeting that he had attended the previous day?

Mr. Bissell, Obviously, sir.

basis of the documents.

Mr. Baron. Po you assume that assassination was one
of the means of removing Lumumba from the scene that is
contemplated within the language of Mr. Dulles' cable?

Mr. Bissell. Correct -- and also the language reported
in the minutes of the Special Group.

Mr. Baron. And that would be in essence language--

Mr. Bissell, Could T just interrupt to say in

elaboration of that point, you may remember that I perhaps un-|

fortunately used the word "circumlocutious” in earlier testimony
to describe the way this kind of topic was discussed. This
ty a prime example of it, When you use the language that
no particular means were ruled out, that is obviously what it !
meant, and it meant that to everybody in the room.

Mr. Wides. Meant what?

Mr. Bissell. Meant that if it had to Pe assassination,

that that was a permissible means.

Mr. Baron. And that this: was permissible in the eyes i
of the President, whose: sentiments -- who was being repre-
sented at the meeting by Gordon Gray?

Mr, Bissell. At least permissible by his representatives
sitting in the room. You don't use language of that kind
except to mean in effect, the Director is being told, get

rid of the guy, and if you have to use extreme neans Up

to and including assassination, go ahead.

Mr. Baron. And in effect the Director is being told

Mr. Bissell, Right.

Mr. Baron. Through his representative?

Mr. Bissell. Right.

Mr. Schwarz. Did Mr. Dulles tell you that President
Eisenhower wanted Lumumba killed?

Mr. Bissell. I am sure he didn't,

Mr. Smothers. Did he ever tell you even circum-

locutiously through this kind of cable?

Mr. Bissell. Yes, I think his cable says it in effect.

Mr. Smothers. Was this a thing that was clearly under- *
stood here by everyone? What was that in your experince with
the Agency that had prepared you to understand this kind of
coded dialogue, if you will? Was assassination something
that was discussed fairly often?

Mr. Bissell. No, I would say really very infrequently,
very infrequently even discussed, let alone attempted.
put I submit that the language just quoted from the minutes
of the Special Group was not language internal to the Agency,
it was language from a Cabinet level committee.

You may remember another document that was offered earlier
in my testimony which was again minutes of a Special Group
meeting, and it quoted Livingston Merchant, the State Depart-

ment representative, again asking if there was no way to get

TOP SECRET



Prone (Ares 202) 544-6000

rid of the Castro leadership in that case, I am sure you
remember that document.

now, when senior political officers meet in a Cabinet
committee, especially when some kind of a record is being
kept, they do talk around a subject of that kind. But it
doesn't mean that it is obscure or not understood by anyone
there. I believe in both of these caees it is perfectly
clear -- in the firat Livingston Merchant case it is clear that

he was raising a question at to whether physically getting |

rid of these people was possible, and in the second case, the
one just quoted here, it seems to me that -- if you like to
call it that the consensus of the Special Group was that
sno means should be excluded in the effort to get rid of
Lumumba".

and that, I repeat, is not CIA language. If it is
gobbledegook it is ona good high level.

Mr. Dawson. Is Mr. Gray in this cable or memorandum

for the Special Group on August 25, 1960, conveying the feeling

of his associate, which we have identified clearly as

president Eisenhower?

Mr. Baron. Moving back now to the testimony of the
Chief of Station who was in Leopoldville in 1960, he said
that shortly after he received this cable that a messenger
would come whom he would recognize and who would give him

instructions to carry out. He received a visit from Mr.

TOP SECRET



prone (Ares 202) 344-6000

And we have discussed that visit. He then goes
on to testify that Br. Gottlieb gave to him, or told him that
he would very shortly thereafter receive, some lethal biologi-
cal substances, and the tools for administering those sub-
stances, namely, a syringe, gauze masks, and rubber gloves.
Were such lethal biological substances sent down to the
Congo?

Mr, Bissell, I don't know. I assume the record shows
one way or the other, I don't have a recollection of that
I was really rather surprised on the occasion of
the earlier testimony to have it reported that they had been
sent.

Mr. Baron, Would you assume now, hearing this testimony,

that indeed such substances were sent to the Congo?

f
Mr. Bissell. I think what you have told me, repeating :
i

the evidence of the Station-‘Chief,that Dr. Gottlieb told
i

_him to expect that, is that correct?

Mr. Wides. The testimony is that the materials were
brought by Pr. Gottlieb or essentially arrived while he was
there, and that he went over their use with the Station Chief.
That doesn't refresh your recollection at all with regard --

Mr. Bissell. No, it doesn't, But I am sure if the
Station Chief so testified it is correct, there is nothing
in mind that I remember that would be in conflict with that.

Mr. Baron. It would not have been against the policy

TOP SECRET

at that point for the AGency to have proceeded to the point
of sending poison to the Congo?

Mr, Bissell. No, it would not.

Mr. Wides. You draw a distinction before between what
you called the planning stage and the implementing stage. I
take it it was not common to send lethal means by the use of
such a highly unusual messenger to a foreign country and
turn them over to a Station Chief as distinct from experi~
menting in the laboratory in Washington?

Mr. Bissell. The phrase I used, or tried to use,
most of the time was the phrase of planning and preparation
versus the phrase of implementation.

Mr. Wides. By implementation do you mean simply the
actual commencement of =~

Mr. Bissell. Of an active assassination, yes.

To answer your first question as directly as I can,

it was the practice, if I remember correctly, that devices

or agents, biological agents, or other things of this sort,
that some stocks of these were kept in certain major stations

4
overseas.: I would be very surprised if that were not the

case, and had not earlier been the case in the Station

Ay
at, and in thee stations, because these were

big organizations.

Mr. Wides. These were lethal biological agents?

Mr. Bissell. I suspect,yes.

TOP SECRET



Mr. Dawson. And the purpose for these stockpiles would

have been ~~ :

Mr. Bissell. In case there was @ sudden need for their
,

use, so that there would not be & logistic problem.

Mr. Dawson. To use for what? To kill people?

Mr. Bissell. I suppose BO, if they were truly lethal
agents .

vr, Wides. | You say you suspect 80.

Do you have any recollection that you were at the time

aware of such stockpiles abroad?

Mr. Bissell. If there were Loam pure I was aware of
it, and i seem to remember that in the two biggest overseas
stations there were one or two or three staf£ members who in
effect represented the Technical Services Division.

I could be wrong on this, but that, for what it is worth, is

my recollection of the organizational pattern.

Now, to come back to your question again, however, it would
indeed have been rather unusual to send such materials -~
a specific kit, if you like, of this sort -- out to 4 rela-
tively small station, unless planning for their use were
quite far along.

Mr, Wides. I@ it fair to say, then, that your

dichotomy between planning and your use of the term imple-

ots $6, WaNt sar08, 1-6, 7000)

mentation would mean that if -- let us take a different

example -- a sniper rifle and special bullets were sent

TOP SECRET



ois

TOP. SECRET

to the city where they were to be used, and there waa re-
connaissance, and every step necessary to actually carry out
the execution, that the implementation as far as your use

of the material would not start until someone actually picked
up the rifle and pointed it at him?

Mr. Bissell. Let. me try to sharpen it by reference,
if my memory serves, to the Dominican Republic. It is there,
if I remember, that submachine guns were sent down to the
Station by CIA, The State Department never authorized the
release of those to the anti-Trujillo plotters. And I
believe they never were released.

Now, in that case, to take that example, I would say
that implementation would have started at the moment that you
turned those over and they passed out of our control. I
would say that as long as any weapon of any kind remained
securely within the Agency's control, that you were still
short of what I would call <=

Mr. Schwarz. Doesn't that turn on the nature
of the order to the Agency personnel who has them?

Mr. Bissell. It does, right.

Mr. Schwarz. In the Lumumba case, was the AGency
person who had the lethal agents authorized to use them to
kill Lumumba?

Mr. Bissell. To that question I do not know the answer

Clearly the Station Chief had been not only authorized but

encouraged, aa we hava developed -- as you have developed --
in this testimony to seek out individuals who might have
close access to Lumumba for the purpose of hostile action
against him. Clearly the Station Chief was then sent, or
a kit was then brought out to him and put in his possession,
presumably so that if and when an individual with suitable
access and other appropriate circumstances materialized and
authorization was given, if it was still required, the

operation could proceed.

Mr. Baron. Let me see if I can refresh your recollec-

|
tion on that one point, whether authorization had been given.

The Chief of Station testified that when ‘Sidney Gottlieb
gave him poison or instructions in the use of poison, he
also made it very clear that these were for the purpose of
assassinating Lumumba, and that he should proceed to carry
out the assassination of Lumumba if it were possible, that the
use of poison was not a sine qua non to the assassination,
Af he could find another way to do it, that would be fine
but that it was clear that he was to proceed with an assassin-
ation operation if he could find a way to do it successfully.
Mr. Bissell. Accepting that testimony, then, the
authorization was given.
Mr. Schwarz, -But we are dealing with your testimony,

Mr. Bissell. No,

“ know, authorize him to do the act?

Do you recall any fact which bears upon that? or is
your mind ablank on that subject?

Mr. Bissell. Iam afraid, as far as recollection is
concerned, that my mind is a blank on that subject. I know
the Committee doesn't find inference particularly helpful,
but I would strongly infer :in this case that such an author-
ization did pass through me, as it were, if Sid Gottlieb
gave that firm instruction to the Station Chief,

Mr. Baron. You say passed through you. From what
source would it have passed?

Mr. Bissell. From the Director. As I would recon-
struct the sequence of events, the Director, after the meet-
ing and the cable in late August, made it clear that this was
to go forward -- to me that this was to go forward if and
when feasible circumstances permitted it, and it was on that
basis.that I would have authorized Gottlieb to deliver by
word of mouth such instructions from the Station Chief,

That is a highly unusual procedure, even in a sensitive
matter of this sort.

Mr. Schwarz. What is unusual about it?

Mr. Bissell. That the authorization should have been

by word of mouth rather than by cable, I don’t mean a cable

setting it forth in as many words, with you this would have
been identified with a project name by this time, and it is
most unusual that even with a highly sensitive project that
the nature is known to very few, probably only to the Station
Chief itself. |

What I would have expected is an authorizing cable saying,
implement project such and such. i

Mr. Schwarz. But in the normal -course of CIA
assassination activity, if I may use that term --

Mr. Bissell. In the abnormal course

Mr. Schwarz. -~ you would have been instructed by
Mr. Dulles to do something?

Mr. Bissell. Instructed or authorized,

Mr. Schwarz. | And then you would have spoken to or
cabled some other officer?

Mr. Bissell. Correct. And knowing Mr. Gottlieb,

it is literally inconceivable to me that he would have acted
beyond his instructions.

Mr. Baron. The Chief of Station, to be fair to his
testimony, indicated that he was greatly surprised when he
received such instructions, and he was doubtful about the
practicality of pulling off such an operation, at the
least he was convinced it would be difficult. But he did
say -- he added that as a fairly junior Chief of Station he

might have checked back before he could have mounted such an

pression that he would proceed to try to perform such a mission

Mr. Wides. He also cabled.

Mr. Baron, Now, the next step that the Chief of
Station took after Mr. Gottlich departed from the Congo,
according to his testimony, was to cable to headquarters
for confirmation of such an extraordinary mission.

Did you receive such a enable from Leopoldville?

Mr. Bissell. The record would have to show that.
don't remember it.

Mr. Saron. The Chief of Station also testified that
he shortly thereafter received confirmation back in cryptic
fashion to the effect that he was to proceed with the in-
structions to carry out the instructions he had been given.

Did you sent such.confirmation to him?

Mr. Bissell. I assume so, if the cable went out.

Mr. Baron, And that confirmation would have come
from yourself directly as opposed to Bronson Tweedy or anyone
else in the African Division?

Mr. Bissell, Probably.

But again, if you have that cable, the initials would
show who signed off on it, and so on,

Mr. Schwarz. These cables have not been found.

Mr. diGenova. The Committee is making an effort to find

them, and the AGency has not been able to produce them yet.

Mr. Bissell. If it ia any help for me to say, this
sounds highly likely as an account if it is established, as
evidence seems to have established, that pr. Gottlieb brought
such instructions, I would expect the Station to seek con-
firmation. And I would expect,given the background, that
that confirmation would have been forthcoming. And I would
also be almost certain that I would have signed off on such
acable, or signed such a cable, initialled it, even if it
had been going to Mr. Dulles for final approval.

Mr. Baron. These events occurred in early September,
which was prior to your conversations with Justin O'Donnell
about the assassination of Lumumba?

Mr. Bissell. Yes.

Mr. Baron. So at that point an assassination mission
had in effect been mounted in the Congo?

Mr. Bissell. Right.

Mr. Baron. After you spoke with Justin O'Donnell,
did you send a cable to Leopoldville to stand down the
assassination mission?

Mr. Bissell. Again, I would have to go back to the

he received these instructions. And the instructions were

so specific that he wanted to be very sure that the authoriza-

The answer was, it came from the top, or something to

And then the Chief of Station pushed on to pin it down.
And the response he got from Dr. Gottlieb was, something to
the effect that --

Mr. Schwarz, Will you read the exact answer?

Mr. Baron. I will read you from Mr. Hedgman's testi-
mony. At page 30, quoting from the testimony of the Chief
of Station in the Congo at that point, testifying under the
alias of Hedgman, the Chief of Station said:

"In essence I must have -- and again I am guessing

probably said that I had never heard of it being done -- which

Agency had I ever heard any reference to such, in my recollec-
tion at least, such methods. and it is my recollection, I

qhen the testimony proceeds to the bottom of page 31:

mr, wides. Can you recall whether he said ‘the Presi-

or ‘President Eisenhower'?

Mr, Hedgman. I cannot recall whether he just said ~~
whether he said the President or whether “he said President
Eisenhower.

"Mr. Wides. But it was one of those two, is your
best recollection?

"Mr. Hedgman. I would say almost certainly".

Further down the page Mr. Hedgman continues:

“1 nave trigg: to go back in my mind on that, and I
think, 1 believe -- but again now this one is pretty loose in
my mind -- it was something to the effect that the President
had instructed the Director".

And then on page 33 Mr. Dawson says:

“you are not the least unclear whether or not you
came away with a very clear impression that the President's
name had been invoked in some fashion?

"Mr. Hedgman. yes, I came -- certainly that is my
recollection”.

Did Mr. Gottlieb make you aware at this point that he
had made such a representation to the Chief of Station?

Mr. Bissell. I have no such recollection.

Mr: Bissell. There was no possibility.

Mr. Dawson. Is there any doubt in your mind that you
would have then assumed that Dulles had received the
President's okay to do so?

Mr. Bissell. Well, I might well have believed that the
Director was proceeding under the mandate of the Special
Group as reported in/the minutes of the meeting.

Mr. Schwarz. Did you tell Gottlieb anything about
President Eisenhower?

I think it is probably unlikely that Allen Dulles would have
said either the President or President Eisenhower even to me.
I think he would have said, this is authorized in the highest
quarters, and I would have known what he meant.

Mr. Baron. And you have communicated that to Mr.

Mr. Bissell. I could very easily.

Mr. Schwarz. Is all of that line that we have just

what you regarded as the planning stage, this meaning if it
occurred, Dr. Gottlieb taking the poison to the Congo, that
you would not have taken that step without the approval of

the Director, was that your testimony?

Mr. Bissell. What I will:now say at any rate is that
the mere act of taking the kit to the Congo I would classify
as still in the planning stage. But if it be taken as es-
tablished that Mr. Gottlieb took specific instructions "to
implement", I would say that we had then passed into an im-
plementation phase.

Mx. Wides. Let me read to you from your testimony on
June 11, and then ask you a question based on that

on page 54 Mr. Schwarz said:

"who authorized you to tell Mr. O'Donnell to take steps
to move toward assassinating Mr. Lumumba?”

And you said: “No one".

And then Mr. Schwarz:

“Did you inform the White House of that?

"No."

"To the best of your knowledge did anybody inform the

House of that?”

"Mr. Bissell. To the best of my knowledge, no.

"Mr. Schwarz. Why did you seek to assassinate Mr.

Lum mba?

"Mr. Bissell. I didn't seek to assassinate him. I

told the members of the clandestine service to make plans
and develop the capability so to do if it were approved and

ordered."

Now, in regard to your answer that no one had told you

to tell Mr. O'Donnell to take steps to move toward assassinat~ .

ing Mr. Lumumba, I take it that reading that now in the
context of other information we have, that answer was not
intended to mean that -- page 54 -- you were not then testi-
fying affirmatively that no one had spoken to you at a higher
level about trying to assassinate Lumumba, but merely in
regard to your discussion with O'Donnell, which you did recall

Mr. Bissell. My recollection -~ and this I will des-
eribe as a recollection, it may be faulty -- is that it was
my own idea to give O'Donnell this assignment. He had, T
believe, recently completed some other, or there was a change
of position of some kind, and he was available. And given
the background which has here been established this afternoon,
I believe it was my notion to give him this assignment in
parallel to any other thingsthat were still going forward

It would have been. unusuai to have advised anybody
outside the Agency of a specific assignment to an individual
of that sort.

Mr. Wides. And the implication of the lack of author:-
zation from above yourself, or discussion with anyone above

yourself, was confined simply to the giving of the asignment

TOP SECRET



to Mr. O'Donnell?
Mr. Bissell. That is correct

And it is my recollection, as I have testified in

Pmone (Ares 202) 544-6000

Part earlier this afternoon, that when O'Donnell came later
and declined the assignment and expressed the view that this
was not the way to solve the problem, that 1 shut off the
©'Donnell operation completely.

Mr. Wides, Let me go back to that 4f I can. Mr.
O'Donnell's testimony, which I believe we went over with you
when you testified, we might ask you to see now if you have
any different recollection.

In essence it is the following: that you called
him in and asked him to go to the Congo for the purposes
of trying to see if Lumumba could be assassinated, that

very evening you asked him, right at that moment, and it was

toward the end of the day, as he recalled it, you asked him

to see Dr. Gottlieb; that he expressed reservation about

assassination, but did go down to see’ Dr. Gottlieb. and

diately came back.

Goor, as I say, and discussed it with Mr. Helms

This is Mr. O'Donnell's testimony.

Mr. O'Donnell further testified that he told you he
would be willing to go to the Congo to explore the possibility
of neutralizing him in other ways, and that shortly thereafter
in the space of a few days went to the Congo. and I believe
the record suggests that he was there from October through
December, and that while he was looking into the possibility
of trying to get Lumumba out of the property away from effect-!
ive custody of the U.N. with the thought that if the |
Central Congolese Government obtain control of him, they night.
try him for capital crimes, and this might result in his
physical removal. And this was mooted by Lumumba's escape and
recapture and death, and he then came back. i

Is it still your recollection that there was a period
of several weeks between the time you broached the subject
of an assassination and the time that Mr. O'Donnell
expressed his opposition to it?

Mr. Bigsell. I shouldn't be firm on the several weeks
But my recollection of the course of events differs in, 1
think, only one -- or is inconsistent with his recollection
as you reported it in only the one respect, that the impres-
sion I carried away was that at a minimum some days -- and
I had thought a period of at least a week elapsed between

my giving him the assignment and his coming back to decline

the assignment and recommend a different approach. What
you further quote from his testimony I had not remembered, but
it does now seem to me that I do remember -- part of my
original recollection was that when he came back to me I have
several times used the phrase, this was not the way to deal
with the problem of Lumumba, And that is wholly consistent
with his having proposed other means of neutralizing Lumumba
short of using physical’ violence on him directly. 1 do seem
to recollect that.

And although I had not remembered it, I do now seem to
recollect that he went out there and with the assignment,
most of it in his recollection rather than mine, of looking

at other ways of neutralizing Lumumba. But my recollection

simply differs from his on the matters of the timing and how
goon he came back.

Mr. Wides. Do you recall when you proposed: to Mr
Harvey, in what I think we concluded was most probably very
early 1961, that he explore executive action capability,
and that two people who had been cut in in some way on earlier
considerations or explorations of assassination, and two

people whom therefore Ke might discuss this with, were Mr.

Mr. Wides. But you don't recall suggesting -- -or if

part from a security angle, because Mr. Gottlieb had already

been cut in, so to speak, with regard to prior considerations
of assassination possibilities?
Mr. Bissell. Well, I am.sorry to have to retreat
the inference, I think I would have encouraged him to talk

to them myself. And I don't think I would have particularly

worried at that point about the Security implications.

Mr. Bissell. Well, there was an agent recruited in
Europe who was used against the Lumumba faction in the
Congo,

Now, the agent I have in mind, he was extremely success-
ful. He made a deep penetration of not only the Lumumba
sympathizers, but also of those individuals physically lo-
cated in Europe who were supplying Lumumba with money, and in
some cases giving him logistic support. This agent was ob-
viously engaged in an extremely hazardous business, because
if his cover had been blown he certainly would have been,

I think, killed,

Now, this may be the agent in question. I do not
remember that agent ever being put under O'Donnell's control.
But if O'Donnell was given the assignment to find ways of
neutralizing Lumumba, given that assignment to O'Donnell
when he went out there, it is very possible that this
agent would have been put in touch with him.

Mr. Schwarz. Why did you pick O'Donnell, incidentally,
for the initial assignment, the part that was killing him,
as opposed to other methods of neutralizing him?

Mr. Bissell. My recollection is that I regarded him
as highly competent in the craft, I think correctly. 1
regarded him, I think incorrectly as the events turned out,
as a very tough guy in the sense this guy Harvey had, that

such reputation, and I think with hindsight deserved it.

Mr. Bissell. I think it was 1960. And the back-
ground, as I am sure the record shows, was that Dr. Gottlieb
had been in TSD, and he had then gone for a tour of duty, I

believe, to where he continued in the same kind of

work. But he had a much closer connection with espionage
operations and counter espionage in the field. When I brought
him back his mission in effect was a very broad.one,it really
was to find ways and means -- to concentrate on technical ways!
and means, meaning by technical within the general area of i
the physical and biological sciences, of improving the effect-
iveness of all kinds of covert operations. }

Now, in a sense that was-the mission of the Technical

technical people in TSD and the operators in the rest of the

special attention to the interconnections between the |

you do recall the discussions with O'Donnell, and that although

you can't remember specific discussions with Tweedy, in i

general you recall that you were looking into the possibility |

of exploring and planning the possible assassination of i
Lumumba?

Mr. Wides. In the light of the documents from the
group and Mr. Dulles' cable that have been read, do you have
any recollection now wheher you thought at your level you

of Lumumba at that time?

ever, given the context, it ia very uniikely that T would
have taken such a step without clearing it with Allen Dulles.

Mr, Wides. You say you probably so believe. Is
that based at all on a recollection, or simply inference?

that given the evidence here and the background as it has

given the way my mind works, T probably did think I had :
authority.

But it is also very unlikely.

Mc. Schwarz, There are two parts of your answer which
were at war with each other. On the one hand you say, based
upon having seen some Special Group minutes and a cable,
both of which say in effect that killing should not be ruled
out as a matter of consideration ~~

Mr. Bissell. Right.

Mr, Schwarz. on the one hand you say that based upon
those two items, you probably believe you had authority to

order action?

Mr, Bissell.

Mr, Bissell, Right.

Mc. Schwarz. On the other hand you say, well, yes,
although I probably believed that, on the other hand I
probably spoke to Mr. Dulles about it, or would have spoken
to Mr. Dulles about it.

Mr, Bissell. You will recognize that here again I am
talking about the pattern of my relationship with him and the
way the Agency worked.

Now, here was a matter in which the authorization, such
as it was, had come down clearly from the Special Group to
Mr, Dulles personally.

Mr. Schwarz. Now, we are talking about the exhibits
which show an authorization -- assuming you read the words
as meaning killing -

Mr. Bissell. Not excluding, yes.

Mr. Schwarz. -- an authorization to consider that.

Mr. Bissell. Right

Mr. Schwarz. And that had come down?

Mr. Bissell. It had come down to me via Allen
Dulles, and in terms that Allen was in effect being strongly

encouraged to pursue the course of action outlined in the

gone back to him with, for instance, any cable of authoriza-

did believe him.

But let us say in his absence from Washington I had the
authority to send.

Mr. Dawson. You say unlike the-:case-of:.the-White Housd

where you would not take details back, in the case of Mr.

Dulles you would discuss the, details of a specific operation?
Mr, Bissell, Yes.
Mr. Schwarz. But it is not really amatter of details,
Mr. Bissell. That is an important distinction. We have
been talking about a chain that starts with two memos, or threa
memos. We have talked about contemplation or consideration,
don't rule out killing, it doesn't use the word killing, but
it could be read to mean killing, don't rule out killing from

the items to be considered.

Now, moving from doing it is not a detail, is it?

Mr. Bissell. No, I wouldn't call it a detail by any
manner of means, but I would read that language as authorizing
any decision by the Director or the Director's authority.

Mr. Schwarz. May I see that?

After talking about extremely strong feelings, straight—
forward action, and Dulles commenting on taking this ser-
iously, proceeding vigorously, ‘the agreement is:

"It was finally agreed that planning for the Congo
would not necessarily rule out ‘consideration’ of any
particular kind of activity which might contribute to
getting rid of Lumumba",

“Now, the first point, you read that to mean not

ruling out killing?

Mr. Schwarz. Now, was it just your testimony that
you believe that the agreement that planning for the Congo
would not necessarily rule out possible consideration of -~
and now I will substitute ‘the word killing -- is authority

the President had instructed the DC] to carry out this

Mr. Baron. This is a cable that we reviewed, Mr.

turn your attention to the paragraph that says:

"It ig-still difficult to determine whether Mobutu
had sufficient control army to enforce decisions announced

And then there is a sanitized paragraph --

"Station advised two moderate Congolese politicians
‘try work with key Congolese contact’ in effort eliminate .
Lumumba. Fear UN protection will give Lumumba opportunity
organization counterattack. Only solution is remove him
from scene soonest".

Now, the night of September 14 was the night of a coup
in the Congo where Mobutu took power, is that correct?

Mr. Bissell. Correct.

Mr. Baron. And does this cable refresh your recollec-
tion as to the attitude at the Agency toward Lumumba even
after he was in U.N, custody?

Mr. Bissell. Yes. It seems to say rather clearly
that it was still desirable to eliminate him.

there was a continued sense of urgency about eliminating

Baron, You are, not Listed as a participant iat the
meeting, although Mr, Dulles is present, and the following
Paragraph relates a remark of Mr. Dulles:

"Nobutu appeared to be the effective Power in the
Congo for the moment, but Lumumba waa not yet disposed of
and remained a grave danger as long as he was not disposed of"
Does that accord with your understanding of the policy
of the National Security Council toward Lumumba even after
he was in U.N. custody?
Mr. Bissell. It does,
Mr. Baron. And the language "disposed of" would contem-
plate assassination at least as one means of disposing of
him? :

Mr. Bissell. As one means, as one possible means, if

necessary,

Mr. Baron. I have one further exhibit which we
will mark Exhibit 6, that is, a cable dated December 17, 1960
sent to the Director from Leopoldville.

Mr. Baron. And this cable deals with an incident where
an asset of the Chief of Station who'-was. known by the cryptonym
WIROGUE made an approach to agent QJWIN. And the cable says:

"QOWIN, who resides same hotel as WIROGUE, reported that
he had lived Alaska, Japan, South America, Germany and other
parts Europe. QJWIN said, WIROGUE smells as though he in
intel business. Station denies any info on WIROGUE. 1A
December QJWIN reported WIROGUE had offered him $300 per
month to participate in intel net and be member execution
squad. When QJWIN said he not interested, WIROGUE added
there would be bonuses for special jobs. Under QUWIN
questioning, WIROGUE later said he worked for PVB?-PRIME
Service”.

Do you recall this incident?

Mr. Bissell, 1 don't, no.

Mr. Baron. Does P.B, Prime Service refer
American Intelligence Service?

Mr. Bissell. Yes, it does.

Mr. Baron. Namely, the CIA?

Mr Bissell. Yes.

Mr. Baron. Do you recall anything about the formation
of an execution squad in the Congo during this period?

Mr. Bissell. I take that to be a phrase used by an
agent.

Mr. Baron. And this is a cable sent from headquarters

to the Havana Station dated July 21, 1960, The first
sentence of the cable reads:

"Possible removal top three leaders is receiving
serious consideration at headquarters”.

The cable is signed by E. H. Hinkle by direction Tracy
Barnes for DDP, and about E.H. Hinkle by direction J.C. King,
Chief, Western Hemisphere Division as authenticating officer
Relseasing officer was Tracy Barnes.

Do you have any independent recollection of that, cable
and what surrounded its:issuance at headquarters?

Mr. Bissell. It does not, I am afraid.

Mr. diGenova. It is apparent that this cable was
sent out at a time when you were having conversations in the
summer or the fall of 1960 with Mr. Tweedy and Mr. O'Donnell
concerning Mr. Lumumba, is that correct? _

Mr. Bissell, Correct.

Mr. diGenova. Did Mr. Dulles at any time during this
period or prior to it or subsequent to it ever issue a directive

assigning assassination as an agency action?

Mr. diGenova. Sthe duty officer who had issued the
first cable about serious consideration, he had no personal
knowledge, but he had heard that Mr. Dulles had countermanded
the original cable, talking about the possible removal,
and authorizing the approach’: to the asset, the Cuban pilot,
who actually attempted the crash of the plane which would
carry Raol Castro from Prague to Havana.

Do you have any personal knowledge as to why Mr. Dulles
would have countermanded, assuming that he aia?

Mr, Bissell, I don't have any recollection. I could
surmise lots of things.

Mr. diGenova. What Z want to ask you is this: do
you have an independent recollection that any assassination
efforts against the Cuban leaders which were being considered

contmmplated simultaneous action against all three, other~

wise it would be useless action?

Mr. Bissell. The only evidence I know of, hard evidence)
is the Special Group minute to which I referred earlier, :
which was an exhibit in earlier testimony.

Mr. diGenova. You are referring to the Merchant cable
exchange of November 3, 1960?

Mr. Bissell. That is correct.

Mr. diGenova. Now, Mr. Hinkle, the duty officer,

has no personal: knowledge about’ the rescission of that cable.

Does it seem to you upon reflection, knowing what you

TOP SECRET



prone (Area 202) 544-6000

Street, Sifls Wayninaton, 0.6, 70003

know -- for example, Mr. Dulles ‘cable to the Congo personally

authorizing, apparently, the assassination of Mr. Lumumba,

“and $100,000 to do it is it inconsistent to your way of

thinking that he would have authorized that assassination and
would have rescinded this cable that would have apparently
authorized the assassination of ragh Castro,

Mr. Bissell, Not inconsistent at all, I think it may
well have embodied a judgment on Mr. Dulles part that this
effort concerning Radi Castro was altogether too risky, and
technically not sufficiently likely of success.

Mr. diGenova. During our initial telephone conversa-
tion on August 6 you speculated, and you clearly identified it,
as mere speculation, that one of the reasonsthat Mr. Dulles,
assuming he did, ordered that initial cable countermanded was,
first, too many innocent persons on the plane would have
been killed, and second, that it was so risky because there
had been just an initial approach of the asset and it wasn't
known whether or not he was a double agent, and thirdly, it
appeared that the contemplation of all three, the assassina-
tion of all three was being considered, and, therefore, since
only Raol would be on this plane that it would have resulted
in the dilemma that they sought to avoid, that is, if
he had been killed there would have been two left over, and
there may have been a reason that he ordered the countermand.

Would you take by that as a form of speculation at this

point as one of the reasons'that he would have countermanded
that cable?

Mr. Bissell. I would.

Mr, Schwarz. Could I follow up on the Congo, Exhibit
2, the Dulles cable to Leopoldville.

Now, we apparently read to you when I was out of the
room the first paragraph at least, which talks about the clear!
cut conclusion:

"If he continues to hold high office the inevitable
result would be chaos and at worst pave the way for Communist
takeover. Consequently, we conclude that his removal must
be an urgent and prime objective, and under existing conditions
this must be a high priority of your covert action".

And you have read that language as meaning killing, right?

Mr. Bissell. Yes.

Mr. Schwarz. I want to ask you if you continue to

read it as killing in the light of the third paragraph of

\

the cable which reads as follows:

"To the extent that Ambassador may desire to be con-

case he does not wish to be consulted you can act on your
own authority where time does not permit reference here.

“Paragraph 4, this message has been seen and approved
at competent level of the Department of State".

Do you still believe in the light of the authorization

to discuss the matter with the Ambassador that assazsination
was involved?

Mr. Bissell. Yes, especially since there is evidence
here that it was discussed with and: approved at State, and
in the light of the background in this special croup,

Me. Schwarz, You don't think thia is referring to
a coup?

Mr. Bissell, I don't think so. But I can't be
perfectly certain. But I think it refers to more than that.
I think actually it is saying, his removal by some means or
other is the very high priority objective. 1 would infer
from this that what we know was discussed at least in the
Special Group, and that is that removal might be by the means
of assassination, although obviously others would be preferred.

Could I add one word in answer to that question, I am
almost certain I am correct, that the then Ambassador to
the Congo was Edward Gullion.

Mr. Baron, I believe it was Timberlake.

Mr. Bissell, 1 think Gullion had arrived by this
time. But certainly in Gullion's regime there was extremely
Close collaboration between the Ambassador and the Chief of
Station, And the Ambassador was an individual who would have
been quite prepared to contemplate this kind of action.

is complete in terms of your efforts to analyze that, if 1°

represented to you that at the time thamwas traffic between
the station and headquarters in the normal African Division
channels regarding U.S. efforts to influence President
Kasavubu and others to dismiss Lumumba from political power as
premier, and also traffic relating to a takeover of the real
power by certain military figures such as Mr. Mobutu, would
your reading of that cable still be that it suggests authori-
zation of assassination as opposed to possibly discussing
only authorization of removal of him from political power?

Mr+ Bissell. I think it authorizes removal. And I
think that probably Mr. Dulles would have said, if you
can possibly really remove him through political power, that
is obviously the preferred course of action.

But I think this authorizes the whole tone of it very
strong measures indeed.

I say in support of that, there had been a record
established that even after Lumumba had been removed from
political power and had taken refuge in the U.N. he was
still widely regarded as a menace.

Mr. Dawson. I would like to follow very briefly on
this. I would like to ask you about this agent that you did
have a firm recollection of being President of the Congo. He
was described as being a well-placed or a very good agent,
was he not?

Mr. Bissell. I think he was a very good agent,

also he made an effective penetration of Lumumba's supporters
beth in the Congo, and as it were, in the line of funding
and supply in Europe.

Mr. Dawson. So, he was in place, so to speak?

Mr. Bissell. Yes.

In other words, he was a dual agent.

Mr. Dawson. Did he have access directly to Lumumba?

Mr, Bissell. I think he did, yes.

Mr. Dawson. Do you remember having been told that he
sometime in November or December went to Stanleyville?

Mr. Bissell, I don't remember the specific case, but
it fits the pattern very well. What I do remember is one
operation. But he knew:of,he was close enough to ~- he
was used as a courier from Lumumba, I think, first in the
capitol, and then later from Stanleyville to Europe. . And
on one occasion, because he had penetrated so effectively, he
was aware that a large amount of cash was being taken by two
other couriers down to the Congo, and as a result of his
awareness of that, and all the details of that trip, that
shipment was intercepted.

Mr. Dawson. The Chief of Station testified about
having an agent that had access.

Would this have been the agent that he believed he
would have access to?

Does that ring a bell at all?

all. I remember enough of the plan that I referred

Mr. Wides. Either when you became DDP or before,
whether or not you were personally involved, did you ever hear
anything regarding any efforts by the CIA to assassinate Nasser
and to send teams, assassination tems into Egypt for that
purpose?

Mr. Bissell. No, I never did. I could almost go so far|
as to say that that was one that was never even thought of.

Mr. Schwarz. We forgot to ask you a question which we
ask almost all the other high people who come down here to

testify.

rid of assassination as a tool? i

Mr, Bissell. I think in today's atmosphere the answer

is yes.

Mr. Wides. why do you think that?

Mr. Bissell. I think that to use means for the
advancement of policy of such a sort that in the pre-
vailing climate these days would be almost certainly dis-
approved of by a large majority of the legislative arm, and
the public at large, and everybody else, is unwise unless
you can have absolute confidence of total security. And by

security I mean that outside of the two or three people who

Now, that circumstance doesn't obtain today, it never
has, but it certainly doesn't today. And I think the climate
is as I have described, and I, therefore, would eliminate. this
method.
Mr. diGenova, I just’ have one question. I apologize for
jumping around, but part of this is to get you out of here. |
When the phrase"receiving serious consideration" in i

headquarters was used in that cable that we alluded to in

regard to the attempt to kill Raol Castro, what does that mean
to you when Tracy Barnes authorized that sort of language
to be used in a cable?

Mr, Bissell, It means that he had fought and talked
about this, and almost certainly that I have, And it
may refer to considerations with Allen Dulles. TI can't
tell how wide ranging they would be. Théy would probably
have involved J.C. King, the head of that division.

Mr. Schwarz, Did Barnes work for you?

Mr. Bissell. Yes, he did.

Mr. Schwarz. He is now dead, isn't he?

Mr. Bissell. Yes.

Mr. diGenova. But that was not light language when
it was sent to a station?

Mr. Bissell. No.

It was sent to encourage careful planning.
