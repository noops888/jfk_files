| MEMO OF CONVERSATION BETWEEN : .
ae : WM. GEORGE GAUDET AND BERNARD FENSTERWALD . piassecceettctestarsenesssttt
AT WAVELAND, MISSISSIPPI, MAY 13,1975

Gaudet is 67 yéars of age and in poor health. Semi-retired.
Writes for local newspaper.

During WW II, Gaudet worked as secret agent in Latin America
“fox Nelson Rockefeller, Coordinator of. Latin American affairs under
FDR. Switched to CIA in 1947 and worked for them until. 1969. During
‘this time he published Latin American Newsletter and Latin American
[Report, which he claims were.100% commercial ventures and not CIA
fronts. However, he travelled constantly in Latin: America and : _
combined his commercial.work with his’ CIA assignments;.the latter,
‘according to him, were basically uncompensated (some expenses were
picked up by CIAY.and ‘doxé for patriotic purposes. There were 3 others
in the New Orleans area who did likewise..." i :

Gaudet is'a right-winger; generally disliked JFK. ' Peeseaeertirerien
: \

Kept his CIA activities very secret, not even telling his wife.
Only told FBI in 1963. No one else. .

‘Latin American Newsletter cost $15.00 per week. Both the CIA
and the KGB had in excess of 20 subscriptions, which means that each
of them "subsidized". Gaudet to the tune of more.than $15,000 annually.
; a : :

“ -as to JFK slaying, believes Warren Report is a fairy story
‘which shall become completely unglued very S00n. .Believes anti~Castro
forces involved. Personally believes they had a-right to hate JFK.
Thinks plot was, hatched soon after Bay of Pigs and came to fruition
in 1963.” :

As to having the Mexican Travel Permit serially next to Oswald's,
Gaudet explains that it was complete coincidence and that he never met
Oswald. He backs and fills on whether he flew to Merida.or Hexico City.
What,is of more interest is'thé fact thathe was interviewed three times
by FBI about:it. Before telling them anything, he checks ywith."Bill", ©. .
the CIA station chief in‘’New Orleans, who, in turn, checks with Langley.
It is decided, that.Gaudet should answer guestions re Mexican trip but
nothing more, and FBI promises to keep Gaudet's riame \to, itself, and
save his covers: ‘Apparently, *thby did so until+1972 when his. name lwas
(inadvertently?) declassified. : : :

Gaudet says the FBI’ report about his having reported. on Ruby's
buying paintings from Borenstein is a complete fabrication. (He didn't
know either Borenstein or Ruby and he wouldn't volunteer the time of day ~
to the FBI. :

In last week, FBI has called and is going to re-interview
Gaudet... For whom? : :

-: “Gaudet says he never met Oswald, and that _he only observed him”
upon otcasion: Question mark on this? In any .event, he describes. him
as a “miserable little creature who would do anyting for money."

“Believes he was*heing financed-hy-sameane, Most seriously doubts if
' he could have pulled off the rifle fire in Dealey Plaza, as LHO was
terribly nervous and disorganized.*

Doesn't really admit. knowing what he was up to. Rumored to have.:.:
",an office in a building immediately across street from Trade Mart,

Knew LHO went to Mexico by bus.

CIA New Orleans had closed circuit -to Langley. 702

Cra only paid Gaudet's special travel expenses when their’

tasks couldn't be done on his.regular trips.

Gaudet was once flown to Langley to brief CIA .on* Latin
American affairs. : : ho

Laughs when he thinks of Rockefeller as head of Commission
