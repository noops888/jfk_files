Latest Follawup to Call-In to Agency Keadquarters/John Daniel
Williamson? |Carrolltoa, Georgia water

ATL-4-75, 14 January 1975, same subject

1. On 13 February 1975, Special Agent (fou) Austin of the Special
Investigations office of the US Bureau of Customs Atlanta office
(Phone: (404) 526-7731) called and wanted to speak to the writer of
this memorandum. We were out of town at the time and he asked the
secretary, who took bis call, to have us return his call Tuesday norning
(18 February) when we returned, Wa called him back the morning of
18 February.

2. Mr. Austin sald that the reason he was calling wae with regard
to a contact he had had froma friend of “Dan Williamson” (the individual
who had called our Agency and whe was the aubject of the above-referenced
memorandum). The information that Austin had to impart was essentially
as follows;

3. Williamson's friend, whe was the one that Williamson called us
about with regard to informatiern on the shipment of arma and the impending
overthroy of 2 foreign country (see cited memorandum), had contacted Austin,
and asked that Austin try to set up a meeting between him (iillienson’s
friaod) and us (Austin and Peterson). He had provided Austin with our name
and phone number vhich had been given him by Filifamson. We told Austin
that we had only talked with Williamson one time—on the phone—when
Williamgon had sought to set up a agating between us and bis friend, and
that we had never met Williamson's friend and knew nothing aboot him other
than what Williamson had told us on the phone. We told Austin that we had
givea our name and offics phone nusber to Williamson because Willigmson
had said his friend would like to get in touch with us, aad further told
him that siace that time (7 January 1975) we hed had wo call from him—which,
we said, seemed strange for someone apparently so eager to contact us. Ye
inforeed Austin that we often get crank calls and wa don't just go around
meeting vith people who call up on some weird subject. We said that we were
sorry now that we had ever given Williamson our number. We also told Austin
that the type ef information that Williasson spoke of—shipment of arms to
other countries—was something entirely outalde our area of jurisdictions,
and that should #illiauson's friend call or had he called ve vould sygess
that he provide his information to the FBI.

4, Austia said that Williamson, himself, had not been in toueh with
him. We understood Austin to say that Williamson's friend was a past
inforser. Austin said that the lasr time he had talked with him he had
told Austin about a “super dope deal’ that apparently Custoas was never
able to confirm. Austin described him as one who seems to have ‘flights
of faney,” and at one point in his conversation with us he said, "I'm
really a little leary of the guy.” According to what Austin said,
Williamsoa's friend had told him that “they” (whoever “they may be) were
‘running guns into Nicaragua and into Maxico supposedly through the Port
of Laredo, Texas. Austin said that they had had people doing some
checking at Laredo and so far nothing had checked out.

5. Williamgon's friend had told Austin that he “was only going to
do this (provide information) for the noney,” and mofety was discussed.
whem the figure of $50,000 wss brought up, Williamson's friend indignantly
told Austia words to the effect: “I can go te the CIA and they will pay
me more than that just for the information.” When Austin told bim to go
abead, Willianson's friend said “Well, aa a matter of fact, this friend of
mine (apparently referring to Williamson) already has." Then he asked
that Austin as a favor act as a go-between and set up a meeting for him
with us. All of which led to Austin’s calling ua.. Wa reiterated to
Auatin that we had vo desire to meet with Williamson's friend. We hope ha
wilh get the message and that will be the end of this waste of tine,

6. Ne explained to Austia our mission aa collectors of foreign
anformation, and Austin said that if anything should turn up that would be
ef legitimate interest to us he would let us know. Austin was very
frleadly throughout. and ve thanked him as a matter of courtesy for having
gone to the trouble of contacting us.
