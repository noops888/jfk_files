DISPATCH SECRET | EAOHA-34682

3. The product of LIZIXG-4's efforts to case the

LIRING consulate will be revieved in a separate dispatch i

which will also transmit floor plans and dravirgs o{ that

LIRING component. There is little question that the-1e7s

of LIBING-3's ariest in Guatemala gained LIRiNG-4 the sym

pathy of various members of LIRING including LIRING-3, -9

and -16, They seex to understand LIRING-4‘s desire to postpo:

her departure for PBRUMEN after having received her long awaited

PERUMEX visa. The problem now is to have LIEISG-4 leave for |

~ BPBRUMEN while LIRING-3 is still incarcerated in Guatemala. As
mentioned in a receat cable, ROYTON has encouraged LIRING-4's.
plans to try to visit LIRISG-3 in jail in Guatemala City as ¢
ROWIOX feels that LIRING-3 will probably urge LIRING-4 to
spend in PBRUMEN at least sone of the time he has to spend in
jail, As for the conduct of Sergio VALDEZ (see ROWTON's reports
dated 19 April and 6 May), it appears that tke latter has delib-
erately been provocating LIRING-4. As this Station sees it,
VALDEZ's purpose was to try to “shake up” LIBING-4 in the absence
of LIRING-3 to test her reactions. It is doubtful that he acted
onsaid=-toastaahhadeem~b-Poaoe-a-P- start Thirs le ew San se eviae
indication that he nay fe been doing this for the PBRUMEN's
(although this is no doubt a possibility). The Station is look-
ing into the desirability, at this point, of placing VALDEZ
under surveiilance. The claim that ROWION in alias offered
Carmen LOZADA « certain sum oi money for intelligence information

2, According to reports subnitted to Wallace B, BOSTON !by

LIRING-3, the latter =<«t Carlos Manuel Persaval Varcue origiqaily
through the latter's sister-in-lav, Carmer*Lozada de R2mirez/
who had been carrying on an extra-marital affair with LIRING-3
since early November 1367. On the evening of 3 March 1968, *
Persaval approacned LIRING-3 in connection with the seteie

that a young Guatemalan voman living in Mexico City vas havi
in obtaining false docusentation to enable her to travel to
Guatemala to recontact her husband, whom Persaval described as
“an important guerrilla leader”. Persaval revealed to LIRING-3
that he had been assisting the FAR in propaganda work in Wexico
for some tine and gave LIRING-3 several copies of a pamphlet |
eatitl:a "Violencia en Guatemala" which Persaval said had been
published cn one of his uncle's presses and was being sold at the
hominal price of three Wexican pesos to help raise money for ithe
FAR, '

i !

3. When LIRING-3. under RO®TON's direction, respoaded
favorably to tkis initial appro>~a, Persaval pursued the matter
and finally, on § April, reveal. that he vas in touch with two
ie leade.e” uu necucu oeap an returning ¢
clandestinely to Guatenala. Persaval asked LIRING-3 to arrange
to guide these persons across the Guatemalan border south of
Chiapas, an area LIRING-3 had previously told Persaval he was very
faniliar with from his previous residence in San Cristobal.
Percaval made no further reference to the "young Guatemalan wife
of the FAR leader”, LIRING-3 surmised to ROWTON that this person
night actually have been the wife of Francisco Lara Barrios, but
that plans for her return were discarded in favor of the trip
by Lara himself.

4. At ROWTON's urging, LIRING-3 insisted on meeting the tvo
Guatenzlans involved and in talking to them before undertaking
such a mission. Persaval finally introduced LIRING-3 to Francisco’
Lara Barrios on 17 March 1968, and the latter presented LIRISG-2
: to a certain "Rodolfo", who LIRING-3 ascertained subsequently wes
Hee | a member of the 13th of November group headed by Yon Sosa by the

nane ofySandoval. Francisco Lara Barrios confided to LIRING-3
that he had in his possession a false Guatemalan passport in the
name of Jose Maria‘Oliva Carranza and that he had obtained legal
residence in Mexico with his wife and children through the efforts
of ex-Mexican President Lazaro Cardenas. He also named a certaia
yEskenazi and LIREBEL-1 as persons who assisted Guatemalaa exiles
in Mexico. Station believes Eskenazi may be identical vith
Luis DavidfEskenassy Cruz, a former agent of the Guatemala City
Station. *

5. With the approval of RO¥TON, LIRING-3 agreed te! help
the above-mentioned persons to cross the Mexican/Guatemalan border
and te accompany them to Guatemala City. This latter extension of
the original trip was made by Lara at the suggestion of LIRING-3
so that the latter could meet with the FAR woman responsible for
logistics, LIRING-3 reported to ROVTON subvequently that just
before their departure, Lara also offered to arrange for LIRING-3
to travel clandestinely to the Sierra de las Minas to meet directly
with FAR and 13th of November leaders to discuss further| support
that LIRING-3 might be able to provide ehrough | his co ial
contacts in Chiapas and northern Mexico.

<6, “LIRING-3 fabricated a false Mexican identity d nt
(Secretaria-de Education) for Francisco Lara Barrios in the |
name of. Jacinto‘Rangel Cervantes with Lara slightly disguised so
that tke latter could move about more unobtrusively on the Mexican
side of the border just prior to crossing. On 3 April 1988,

just prior to their scheduled departure date, Francisco Lara
oars

ASE peeoNs cones.



CONTINUATION OF
DISPATCH

informed LIRING-3 that their mutual friend Rodolfo Sandoval
would not be accompanying them since he was too vell known and
his mission was not important enough to justify the risk and the
expense involved.

7. LIRING-3 did not depart as he had hoped on 5 April 1968,
because Lara unfortunately accidentally shot himself in the ankle
on the norning of that day while cleaning his gua and had to be
given medical attention before he could make the trip. LIRING-4
told ROWION that LIRING-3, Francisco Lara and Razl/Moreno, a
friend of LIRING-3, finally left Mexico City in personal
car of Raul Moreno on 10 April 1958. but that Moreso had returned
to Mexico City two days later as a result of an-eccident that
disabled the car sorewhere in Chiapas. LIRING-4 did not report
anything concernirz the subsequent involvement of Carlos Persaval
Yarcue, stating that she tad not received any ccmnunication from
LIRING-3 after his telegram of 12 April, in whics te reported
the return of Raul Moreno. 20¥TON surmises that wren Raul
Moreno Lad to return to Mexico City. LIRING-3 lara asked
Carlos Persaval Marcue to join then and drive trem to the border
fs hit om cor, ana thet Persaval continued on vita them toward
Guatemila City.

8. Guatemala City Station advised on 22 Arril 1968, that
the story of the arrest of Lara, Persaval and LIZING-3 had reached
the local press and that they would be turned over to the appro-
priate courts for trial. This indicates that LIRING-3 may
eventually be released and hence be available to ROWION for
complete debriefing.

9, The only significant name that had surfaced as a result
of LIRING-3's involvement with the Guatemalan rezeis in Mexico
City is that of Rolando’Mendez Aguilar, vhom Frascisco Lara
Barrios contacted on 45-60-30 extension 27, in early April from

SUBJECT: LIRING-3 Visit To Guatemala With Guerrillas |
FRANCISCO ADALBERTO LARRA BARRIOS and CARLOS’

MANUEL PERSAVAL MARCUE .

1, On 5 March 1968, LIRING-3 had dinner with CARLOS
PERSAVAL MARCUE, nephew of MANUEL MARCUE PAROINES, director
of the now defunct magazine “POLITICA”, a Cot-zunist bi-
monthly publication. During the dinner PE25A4VAL queried
LIRING-3 if he could obtain a false passport for the wife
of an important Guatemalan guerilla leader so that she:
CoULS tierce Saum Meascu Cu ufatem-ta, Lininu-3 replied
that he would do his utmost to assist.

2. On 8 ¥Yarch 1968 PERSAVAL told LIRING-3 that two(2)
Guatemalan revolutionaries had need to travel to Guatemala
by mid-March, LIRING-3 commented that there vas limited
possibility of obtainirg false documents, but that he could.
brief the Guatemalans so as to facilitaté their illegal
crossing of the Mexican/Guatemalan border, or if they desired,
he would guide them.

i
3. On 9 March 1968, PERSAVAL again discussed the matter

-with LIRING-3, saying that one of the two travellers possessed
- legal travel decurents. Since the other person has no:such

legal documents, they should enter Guatemala tMegstiy,
J MEXI-479077

4, LIRING-3 reported on 27 Yarch 1968, that one of the
traveller to Guatemala is FRANCISCO ADALBERTO LARA BARRIOS,
The group is of the opinion that LIRING-3 should also go to
Guatemala in order to meet an unidentified woman, described
as the FAR logistics officer, to discuss FAR support from
Mexico,
/-MEXI-500077

5. Departure was delayed because LARA sustained a self-
inflicted gun shot wound while cleaning a weapon, On 10 April
LIRING-3, LARA, and another person--described as a member of
the YON SOSA Faction--departed en route to Guatemala. |
LIRING-3 was informed that the FAR and the YON SOSA group
are now working together, but that a certain amount of
compartmentation exists.

1. The development, handling, and exploitation of any

fas tee oo ieawhacte Tm that
ease of LIRI a/Lia G-4 the situation is further complicated
by the fact that PBRUMEN nationals at home and in LIRING (the
main target against whom the two have been directed) have -
long suspected their motives for maintaining contact and
wanting to cooperate with thea. The ups and dowus of the
LIRING-3/LIRING-4 marital relations have from time to time
further complicated the conduct of operations involving them.
The Station can understand that Headquarters has some reser-
vations on the conduct of these operations. They have beea
cozplicated, time consuming, and have blown hot and cold
depending on the state of mind of the PBRUMENers at the time
and the difficulties between LIRING-3 and LIRING-4. Because
of incomplete control, an almost inescapable feature of this
type of operation, a considerable effort was made to check
the reliability of LIRING-3 and LIRING-4. This involved ,
LIFEAT coverage, audio monitoring (LIROSIN), and occasional

surveillance by the LIEMBRACEs. The results, at least in the
PBRUMEN phase of this operation, have been unspectacular so:
far. The main usefulness of LIRING-3 and LIRING~4 has been;
a) as access agents to LIRING, (although this has been |
largely reduced to the LIRING Consulate), and b} to introduce
Wallace B. ROWTON to visiting PBRUMEN officials and members|
of the local leftist community with access to PBRUMEN and |
LIRING. A major effort was started recently to take this 7
opersvion up one more notch and, taking advantage of a recent
crisis in the relations between LIRING-3 and LIRING-4, send
the iatter to PBRUMEN on a mission to assess and hopefully
recruit new sources of information. The exploitation of
LIRING-3's contacts with representatives of the Guatemalan
FAR rebel moverent was the object of separate correspondence.
LIRING-3's renewed contacts with these representatives do
not at this tine involve PBRUMEN, although the latter clearly
supports at least some of their activities.

2. Y¥orwarded under separate cover are fifteen reports
prepared by Wallace B, ROWICN on the activities of LIRING-3,
TERING4, and coma nf their contacts from late January to
31 March 1968. The Station has noted Headquat‘ers' desire
for more frequent progress reports per reference A. It felt,
however, that in this case partial reporting of LIRING-4's
difficulties in obtaining a PBRUMEN visa (by far the most
important aspect of this operation during the period under ae
review) could have been misleading, as the situation changed
several times and LIRING-4 did not really know what to expect
from LIRING fron one meeting with its representatives to the
uaxt, not to again mention the ups and downs of the LIRING-3/
LIRING-4 relationship, which hit a new low during this period.
The Station would like to point out in passing that, in
addition to cable reporting and dispatches transmitting:
ROWTON's contact reports, the operations in which LIRING-3
and LIRING-4 are involved in are reviewed in sone detail in ww
the over-ail monthly report submitted by the PBRUMEN Section
of this Station.

3. The last time LIRING~4 accompanied LIRING-3 to PBRUMEN,
she obtained an entry visa in a few days, LIRING-4 thus felt
that as an ex-exployee of LIRING with good connections in
PBRUMEN and LIRING she would obtain a new PBRUMEN entry! visa
fairly easily. Entry visas are now quite a bit more difficult
to obtain, however, for PPRUMEN nonofficial citizens abroad.

It also appears that the LIRING staff did not really know

what to make of LIRING-4's stated desire to return to PBRUMEN
for an extended period of time, as this was obviously based

on a domestic quarrel. LIRING-3 and LIRING-4 have had other
quarrels, and the LIRING staff may have thought that this last
one would subside and that LIRING-4 would postpone or cancel
her plans for going to PBRUMEN. It was to convince the LIRING
staff that the difficulties with his wife were serious ‘that.
LIRING-3. first went to LIRING. In a maneuver to further
convince the LIRING employees, particularly LIRING-2 and
LIRING-9, that LIRING-4 seriously wanted to go to PBRUMEN as

a@ fesult of domestic problems, ROWTON decided to have LIRING-3
openly question LIRING-4's right to take their child with

her. It must be remembered that, in Wexico, u wife cannot
leave the country, and especially take a child with het,
without the express and official consent of the husband. This
little scenario appears to have been well played. On the
other hand, it did not help LIRING-4 obtain a visa any faster.
LIRING-2 appeared to be waiting, among other things, for
LIRING-3 to arrive at a decision regarding their child jaccept~
able to his wife. LIRING-3 finally "agreed" to let LIRING-4
take the child at his 26 February meeting at LIRING. Two
days before, LIRING-4 had been told by LIRING-2 that the

rome
= So

aN
USE euros coinoW, SECRET [x]



CONTINUATION OF
DISPATCH SECRET HMOIA - 34484

“consejo superior" of LIRING, of which he said he was a member,
had not yet taken up her case. This was indirectly confirmed
by LIRING-16, who told LIRING-4 the same day that nothing
about her visg case had yet been sent to PBRUYEN as he would
otkeivisc kuot it, isco he hendlcd 211 vis« correspondence.

4. There is naturally the possibility that LIRING-4's
visa request was handled by LIRING via classified correspondence
not seen by LIRING-16. This channel may have been used because
LIRING-4's visa request brought out the old problem of
LIRING-3's reliability in the eyes of the PBRIMENers. Although
LIRING-2, LIRING-9, and Idertity appeared sympathetic toward
LIKiNG-4 and her projected visit to PBRUMEN (to the point
where they advised her on more than one occasion not to come
back to Mexico), they, at the same tire, sought to clarify
two things. They first made another attempt to throw some
light on the sources through which LIRING-3 had obtained
information of particular interest to LIRING. Secondly they
brought up the question of "the Greek” (ROWTON) and tried to
obtain answers to pertinent questions. LIRING, as mentioned
by woth LAKLAG-2 aod luenticty, is noe used wo veiug Biveu
sensitive information without at the same time obtaining good
source description. Specifically, how did LIRING-3 hear of
the arrest of the LIRING member involved in a subversive case
4n 1966, how did he learn of its proposed publication in the
press of a Central American country, how did he obtain the -
report on Rico GALAN which he passed to LIRING, and how could
he have learned of certain of the activities of Moises OROZCO
Leal? To all these questions LIRING-3 replied by saying that
he had good sources in Mexico and Central America and that he
was not about to divulge tnem to the PBRUMENers. Both LIRING-2
and Identity in their conversations with LIRING-3 and LIRING-4
took pains to say that LIRING-3's conduct in his dealings
with LIRING and PBRUMEN was "above reproach.” They wanted to ,~
be sure, however, that he \d not fallen victim to unscrupulous
elements constantly surrounding the revolution.” To quote the
old cliche, LIRING-3 "got their message." i f

5. ROWTON’s introduction to LIRING-2 and other LIRING
members by Rodolfo REYES Cortes and his subsequent meetings
‘with LIRING-2 were bound to make the latter sonewhat curious
about this wealthy Greek businessman and proclaimed friend of
“the revolution” who seems to travel extensively and appears
to have well-informed and influential friends in many parts
of the world. LIRING-2 was apparently ruffled by ROWTON's
criticism of the LIRING efficiency (see ROWTON's report dated
1 January sent as an attachment to reference B) since he

_ finally phoned ROWTON's "office" after the incident described
in ROWTON's 1 January report. For some reason LIRING-2 made
the call on a legal holiday when offices are usually closed,
and the operator of ROWTON's answering service answered
“Mr. ROWION's (in alias) office." This apparently made : 5
LIRING-2 even more inquisitive. During a one hour meeting
at LIRING on 15 February LIRING-2 asked LIRING-4 about her
relationship with "the Greek." LIRING-2 wanted to know where
and for whom he worked, et cetera. ROWTON's report of
17 February covers this conversation in detail. LIRING-2
appeared to suspect ROWTON may have been one of the sources
of the information passed LIRING by LIRING-3 and warned
LIRING-4 "to go easy with the Greek," if not for herisake, at
least for LIRING-3, who "has not always treaded on firm ground."
LIRING-4 provided some "information" on her Greek acquaintance
on 24 February. ROWTON, who had briefed her in detail on what

she should tell LIRING-2, felt, after listening to LARING=4's
report, that the latter had at least partly succeeded in «
lessening LIRING-2's suspicions. These suspicions may have
been further reduced after LIRING-3's discussion with LIRING-
on 26 February. ROWION did expect LIRING-2's questions and
felt in the end that he had “passed the test."

ae ee Ne an ee

6. The Station does not know at this point whether
LIRING-4 will get a PBRUMEN entry visa but is still optimistid
that she witl. The PBRUMENers appear convinced that there is!
serious trouble between her and LIRING-3, and LIRING-1, to
whom LIRING-4 wrote for help recently, asked her to be patient,
pointing out that red tape in PBRUMEN takes time. The i
possibility that the PBRUMENers may allow LIRING-4 in their {|
country to interrogate her about the activities of her husband
and some of her friends has occurred to ROWTON and the Station.
Such a possibility is, however, most unlikely as the object
of the PBRUMEN suspicions is LIKING-3 and net LIRING-4, who
has several times told them that she knows little of what
LIRING-3 does. The most important consider-tion, however, is
that LIRING-4 is married to a Mexican citiz.n, and as
suspicious as they nay be of the latter's doings, the

tn the Moet of cur teoctedeo, mn nreoe that

this Mexican has done anything against their fegime. On the
contrary, LIRING-3 has time and again warned them of impending
difficulties or problems. The fact that LIRING-4 is married
to a Mexican and that she enjoys the status of immigrant in
Mexico is also the best assurance that ste would be allowed 7
to return to Mexico, as the PBRUMENers want no trouble with
the Mexicans. The SGSWIRL examination recently given LIRING-4
has cleared the air at least on two points. First, that :
LIRING-4 is not an enemy penetration, and, second, that she
has not revealed the nature and extent of her contacts ¥ith
ROWTON to anyone else than LIRING-3. The Station agrees with:
ROWTON that LIRING-4 would, if given a chance, prove herself
to be a good asset. As for the question of being left with
continuing obligations in this operation, both LIRING-3 and
LIRING-4 Enow that there is little ROWTON could do beyon:
providing legal-type advice to bring LIRING-4 back to Mexico '
if the PBRUMENers refused to allow her to return to her husband,
an unlikely possibility as mextioned above in view of current
Mexican/PBRUMEN relations. The letter of understauding signed
by LIRING-4 specifies the extent of RO¥TON's commitment and
leaves no doubt as to the extent of his obligations. The
Station hopes that LIRING-4's relationship with LIRING-3 will
not improve with time to the point where she will lose the
proper motivation and cover to undertake the mission to PBRUMEN
for which she has been trained and briefed.

7. The attempt made tc exploit Carmen LOZADA's trip to
PBRUMEN to obtain assessments and vulnerability information |
on a number of persons she knows who have operational potential
turned out to be a complete failure. LOZADA ran into such
difficult family problems in PBRUMEN that she had no time (or;
as it turned out, desire) to obtain the information requested
of her. The strain of her personal problems was such that
she nearly had a nervous breakdown after returning to Mexico
City on 16 February. Not even LIRING-3 could get anything out
of her. The victim of a type of family blackmail by her [pro-:
AMTHUG husband, LOZADA returned to PBRUNEN on 15 March. }
ROWTON did not fare much better with Rodolfo REYES Cortes,
who returned to Mexico City in early March, REYES, who is i
preparing to go to Chile to put on’a ballet performance, (has. !
been extremely busy since his return with private and |
professional matters. ROWTON nevertheless manaced to debriet

him at least partially on his contacts ia PBRUMEN. The only
concrete result of REYES' trip to PBRLMEN so far is the contact
which he made with Sukendah**HANAFI, the ex-Ambassador of
Infonesia in Havana, According to REYES, HANAFI expressed
rest in meeting ROYSTON to “work something out" to the
mutual sdvantage of both the Greek and Indonesian revolutions.
After a couple of phone calls, it turned out, however, that
HANAFI would probably be unable to obtain a Mexican entry visa.
The Station believes, anyway, that little would be gained by
ameeting. From the information at hand, HANAFI is a convinded
leftist who does not lack for money and seems to have an!
enjoyable life in PBAUWFN. The Station is finally not !

i interested in the Indonesian “revolution” or in what HANAFI
could do to help the Greek leftists.

to further exploit the antagonism LIRING-4 has developed for
the personnel of LIRING in the course of her attempts to

the propesed publication of the a:rest in the Guatesalen press, the report

conceriing the letter of Rico Galan ead tae Crozco afcir, but they were

send her S/i aesssges with innocent text cover to the following address:

gised to sail an innocent text letter as soon efter arrival as possible so
that icwt.n would have a g_od idea of the lenta of tine anvdéved in his

.%. LIRinG/S was advised that she would receive S/s resssges from Zowton

be auéressed to a thiré rerty and contain a brief nesssge of grecting in
the handwriting of LIRIiNG/3 and woule be sent as an actachment to a rou-
tine letter from LIKING/3 sent by hand or through the id RING pouch. Both
LIal:.G/& and aewton agreed that open mail, since it would have to bear her

might ettract uriae ettention. t

6. It was therefcre arreed that LIZ1G/4 would also write S/w iz letters

7. At his meeting with LIRING/4 on 14/2/68 the following acditicnal signals
were agreed on:

8. As far as inceming S/d was concernéd, xowtor stated that if ea cover

Reference: HMMA-31821, dtd 3 April 1967.

1. Om 15 April 1968, circa 1410 hours, the audio installation
described in reference was deactivated. The SPT-2A was recovered
by Walter ¥. CORNEURY and returned to Station stock. The UP equip-
ment, am SPE-2A and UHER 4000 L, will also be returned to Station
stock.

2. ‘Inasmuch as LIRING-3 and LIRING-4 vere terminating their
“lenge” on the target apartment, it was felt the SPT-2A carrier
current transmitter would have to be removed because of its shallow
concealment. To continue the assessment of target personalities
however, we wanted to wait until almest the last minute. ‘The week
of 15 April 1963 was selected as an appropriate time by Waliace Lad
ROTTON, who is in contact with the targets. 5

3. At about 1300 hours, 15 April 1968, Walter ¥. CORREURY and
Gliver BD. Cim0CH catered the LF and were grevied by LIRGSIA who knew
we vere coming but did not know why. A check of the audio device
revealed that LIRING-4 and a young (teen-age) male relative were in
the target. This was as expected. At 1330 hours, LIRING-4 left.

a few minutes later and made the male relative accompany ber. (This
wes cbviously at tne insistence of 20VTON.) The telephone number of
the target apartment was tried a few minutes after their departure
and was not answered, again as expected. At 1400 hours a telephone
call was received in the LP from the Station as a relay from ROWTON
that the targets were safely ensconsed for at least the next hour.
(It was known that LIRING-3 was out of the city.) Another ‘telephone

Mexico and contacted the person who bad carried to

Subject: SGSs1zL Zxanination of LIRING/3. i
1. From about 1330 uztil 1530 on 29 September,19¢7, LIRING/3 was

given an SGSJIRL exazination. Rowton arrived at the safehouse ( Tacu-
baya) with the SGOsIRL operator at 0930 that corning and remained with

the operator until the exazination was coupleted. ‘ie had not given LI-
RING/3 any previous notice of the nature or extent of the examinaticn,

but simply asked hiz,on 27 September, to keep the entire day of 29 Septen—
ber free for a lezzthy dicussicn with Zowton. Zowton introduced the SG-
SdIRL operator as sefior Albertini, a trusted "sccio", and spent tne first
hour or so reviewing his relationship sith iIzIG/3, ostensibly for the
weneriu ol Aluextict. Moston then,intretecicr the ewhient of certain
doubts that he hab in the past concerning it ;/3's reporting, stated

that Albertini had = means of checking scientis&fically the truthfulness
of LIRING/3's statezents. Rowton explained tit ne was particularly con-
cernéd about the possiblity of LIRING/3 having doubled back with LIZLiG
andmaintaining with them a secret agreement of soe sort to report on i
Rowton and his activities. :

2. LIRIKG/3 wHet into a state cf visible shock at this and stated that
even the thought of betraying Rowtcn had never cccurred to him at any time.
When the SGSaI2L cperator explained the scientific means he was to use on
LIBUIS/3, the latter stated that he could not pcssibly accept this bucili-
ating means of testing him since it was diazentrically opposed to his
principles. He pointed out that he had accepted sowton at his word and be
could mt see or uccerstand why Rowton could not do the same for hin, adding :

i that the whole thing smacked of nethods used by «CFACT and LIRING. He added

i that if this meant that he would have to break with Rowton, then resret-

fully he would have to accept this alternative. He explained that submit-

1 ing to the SGS#IRL examinetion would inevitably destroy the idealistic and

ql profound relationship which he had previously felt he balan with Zowton.

3. Rowton and the SGS«IRL operator spent the next two hours ‘calming LIRING/? -

down and finally convincing him that he would not be compromising with his

@eeply-felt principles by taking the test. He at last consented to be ques

tioned on his lovalty to Rowton and insisted thet he be asked,"%Do you be-

: lieve in kowton?™ : | aa
4. after a brief break for lunch the exawination was i inone of the bed-

rocus aff the opartaent while Rowton vaited in the living room. LIATNG/3

LIRING/3 bad been an LIRING do.ble agent or betrayed Rowton in any way.

2.

'
appeared to be in reasonably good spirits after the test, although
he was obviously emotionally strained by the experience. Rowton nade
a date to see him again that evening at 21CO to talk things over in
a@ clazer atmosphere. 7

5. At that meeting with LIRIHG/3 Rowton explained that he had felt it
necessary to ascertain as otjectively as pcssiblp the extent of LIxI:5/3's
loyalty to him and he was happy to have scientific proof that LIRING/3
bad not berayed ain to the ZIRING's. LIXTiG/3 stated that after it was
all over he felt wetter and aénitted that he agreed with Rowton on the _
necessity for such an exariation, huniliating as it might at first have

rel (fakntactions ona net gedand

gpremmed te he, Fe cantacend thet one ve:

that he had made in the past, were due to his intense desire to produce
for Rowton, since he still felt very sensitive about having to accept soney
from owton without being, able to render commensurste services. .' He stress—
ed, however, that at no time had he ever been disloyal to Rowton or done
anything against Howton's interest, as sefior Albertini could prove with

the results of the SGSWIRL. LIRING/3 promised in the future to follow Row-
ton's direction serupulously and assured Kowton that he no longer feit
unde> any compulsion to exaggerate or fabricate anything to impress Rowton.

6. Headquarters and the Station may find the SGSWIRL examination disaproin-
ting in its limited coverage, but it miust be realized that LIRING/3's,
initial reaction sas entirely negative and at one point he theatenea to
break off completely with Rowton because of the “insult to his “dignity”.
Although the SGS¥IRL operator felt that from a professional standpoint it
would be better to administer the exazination at another time when LIZiNG/3
was less enotionally upset, Rowton asked both him and LIRinG/3 to go thru:
with it on the spot, fedling that psychologically it was' essential to
make LIHING/3 subz=it, even for a limited test. Rowt:n also feels that the

. test did serve as a very favorably deterrent over LIRING/3 in the future,

when a second one can be more painlessly adainistered, in a calmer atzos=
phere. It, of course, also covered the very pertinent question of whether

2. Please note that the 2GS¥IEL interviewer has mde the
point that the principal misfortune in this’ interview probably i
H waa that LIEING/3 was not tested on the fabrication of contacts
with the IDEM D's, which was thought to be the most probable i

area of deception. : |

3. In view of LIRIHG/3's threat to quit working for
ROWTON, ve would be interested in hearing of any repurcussions
i or change im attitude that may bave resulted froa LIRING/3's
i having taken the test. We also are interested in the Station's
conmenta and recoumendations as to the continued use of LIALSG-3,

been invited by LIRING-4 to come to the party. As previously agree
with the Station, ROWTON directed his main attention to REYES.’
The latter has resided in Havana since 1960 when he founded the
Cuban Ballet Folklorico. Until recently REYES has received the
monthly salary of one thousand pesos from the Cuban government,
and, according to LIRING-3 is well acquainted with political and
government personalities in Cuba. As pointed out in Reference,
ROWTON found REYES to be apolitical, a superficial sympathizer of
- the Cuban revolution and a great admirer of American choreography
(he told ROWTON he would very much like to go to New York to see
some of the shows there.) REYES complained about the relatively
low salary he is currently receiving from the \exico City Belles
Artes for organizing a Cuban Ballet Folklorico show to be held
in Mexico City next December. He readily agreed to RONTON's offer

on a very discreet basis. ie said he hoped to put on another Cuban

2, Carmen MOLINA de CARRASCO is the leftist wife/of a
prominént local neurosurgeon, Juan CARPASCO with whom she spent
some yeas in Cuba. Eoth are Mexican citizens. According to what
she previously told LIRING-3, Carmen MOLINA helped gather some of
the inforzation used to defend both Victor RICO-Galan and the
ROSENBERGS. With the help of Alicia ECHEVERRIA and the‘ latter's
vacle (who is the current Mexican Minister of Interior) Carmen
obtained a prominent position on the Mexican Olympic Committee
in the publication department. She is a close friend of Carmen
LOZADA who is planning to divorce her husband, Enrique RAMIREZ, a
rabid pro-CASTRO Mexican chemical engineer who is still in Cuba.
Carmen LOZADA's father, Armenegildo LOZADA, a noted Mexican '
physician is married to a pro-CASTRO Cuban. According to informa~
tion made available to LIFTER-1, in early 1967 both he (Armenegildo
and his second and present wife are hard core Marxists.) This
Le, wa mala yicwila ue ia CALS, a Cusau, oiild acc! to
LIFTER-1, is a personal friend of several Cuban leaders including
the CASTRO brothers. Husband and wife naintain a close relation-
ship with the local Cuban Ambassador, Joaquin HERNANDEZ-Armas.
Carmen LOZADA apparently also started out as a hard line Narxist.
Information dated 1961 from RNLABILE indicates that she was !
active in Communist organizational work at UNAM and participated
in Cuban led activities directed against ex-Peruvian President
PRADO. Although ske is still clearly a leftist, Carmen may not be
quite as red now. She told ROWTON, for example, that she felt
nothing but disgust for ner fanaticaiiy pro-CASTR and
had strong resentment toward her step-mother. Per LIENVOY, July
1961, Carmen was in contact with Teresa PROENZA when the latter

was at the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City. H os

3. At a private lunch with Carmen MOLINA, 28 Cctcber,
ROWTON explained that he was a Greek leftist (although not a KKE
member) involved in lucrative international business. He said
that because of the current situation in Greece, it was difficult
for him to operate in Mexico as openly as he would like. He.
could thus use MOLINA's help in obtainiag certain types of
information and making discreet contacts with Mexican government
and business circles. MOLINA agreed to do what she could. She
stated that she was not a member of any Mexican or an} ther.
Communist organization, but merely a leftist sympathizer. She
also stated that she currently maintains little or no contact with
the Cuban Embassy. LIONION-1, to whom a photograph of, MOLINA,
REYES and LOZADA (copy of which is forwarded attached) | was shown
stated he had never seen these three persons enter the; Cuban o

Following the developments described above, Station

per Reference, he may be recruited by ROWTON either und

member to become a reporting source in Havana. Primary
motivation in REYES’ case would alnost certainly :
financial. H

b. To continue social development of MOLINA as

to live together) and a possible extree to tke Mexican:
Olympic Committee and foreign olympic delegation.

e. To attempt operational development of Carmen
q LOZADA directly via ROWION or indirectly via LIRING-3 in
the hope that we can play on her "disgust" for the
fanaticism of her husband and her dislike of her mother-
in-law to elicit information on the activities of the
Cuban Embassy in Mexico City and its personnel, and,
hopefully to attempt her recruitnent.

5. Station would welcone addressees’ coments on the
above. Headquarters attention is attracted to ROWIOX's report
of 30 October which quotes REYES’ statecents to tke effect that
sone members of the Mexican colony in Havana believe that
LIRING-3 may be working for WOFIRM (or for the CASTRO government.)

to convince all sresent that he actually was not from WCLADY (althcuxh
most apparentiy had that ixpression at the outset}. Eowtonimanaged to toss
out a few phrases of itussian at the right time in the direction of Carmen
Molina to impress her ( fortunataly her Russian is weaker even than Zoston')
Kowton spoke some nglish with as good an accent as he could manage. Carmen
Molina volunteered to hin privately that she had a great many "progressive"
friends in the U.S. Rowton was able to insert severe] ich hdl about the
current political situat:ou in Greece tuat was forcing him|linto a virtually
“clandestine exiestence in Hexico, as well as elsewhere. Bvéryone eppeared
to sympathize with dowtcn and ceased asking any personal questions.

Subject: Report of LINING/3 Suspect affiliatice with WC7IaM.

1. LIRING/2 reported to “owton at 6900 on 30 Ccto:er,1967, that he
had finally zenged to have a private talk with Roéolfo! Reyes Cortes,
bis Mexicen chereographer friend, ou the afternoon of 27 Gctober,19673
and that, ir the course of conversation, Zodolfo xeyes' had revealed

to LIRING/3 in confidence sat the reason why the LIZiNGS had assumed
arather cool attitude toward LIXING/3 over the pest year. 2odolfo
Reyes explained that the last time he was in “avana he md heard rumors,
arong his frienés in the Mexican colony, that LIRIiG/3 was working
“either for «(FIRM or the Cubans". Rodolfo went os to say that the
origin of tors rumor, as Lar as ne could ascertain, was the fact that
LIRiNG/3 had nade two trips into Havana for no known specificreason and
at his own expense. Rodolfo Reyes, indicating that se himself did not
believe the runors or, at least, did not care whether they wére true or
not, commented to LIRING/3 that other members of LIZING/3's profession
were naturally jealous of the success of anyone of tueir group and were
always quick to draw their own conclusions.

2. LIRING/3 co:mented to Rowton that, although this news had shaken bi.
and LIRING/4 badly at the time, neither of them cared particularly whet
the LIRINGs taought of them, since their own conscience was clears. 1I-
RING/3 added that it was important, however, to continue to develop his
commercial ectivity in Chiapas ( especially since acdolfo geyes' home is
by coinciderce located in San Cristébal) so that word ‘woulé gradually
filter back to the LIklics that he actually did have financial resources
outside his art production. LIRING/3 continued that obviously the LIRLiGs
did not have any specific proof or they would long ago have cut off all
contact with hin as well as LIAING/4. He concluded that since the LIRIiGs
had certain suspicions, they naturally warned all his |friends and forzer

contacts (including, of course, Arnol Rodriquez) to ayoia close contact

_ with him until their doubts could be resolved. : i:

: 3. In reply to Rowton's query LIRZING/3 stated that he Reyes and Carmen
Molina (separately) bad commented to him that they sere favorably inpressea
by Rowton ard did not voice any suspicion of Rowton's bona fides (as a
Greek leftist businessuan). Carnen Mobina, in fact, had gone so far as to

show some irritation that LIRING/3 had not introduced her to Rowton pre-
viously since she was anxious to develop sone sort of ;lucrative business



2.

deaiing witn him, Carren Molina comnented to LIZ-:6/3 that she felt
sure she could help Howton in his business and’ politics) problens and
at the sane time make a little zuch-needed money for aed own living
expenses.

4, LIRLiG/3 continued that he had been maintaining discreet ‘personal

contact with Carmen Lozada over the week-end ( he commented that LIRING/4&

has already shown some sisns of Jealousy and thereZore he ad to be careful

2 not to give her cause to distrust him). LIzIh3/3 stated that Carmen Lo--
zada had told hin that her father, a well-to-do Mexican doctor residing
in Coyacai, had remarried tand that her step-motzer was a Cuben sicentist
wus Led daved wauy year:: in Mexico. She added that both her father and
step-ootber were on excellent social terms with Ambassador Herrdudez Armas.
She revealed that she oad already notified her husband, Enrique Ramirez,
tk-t she intended to divorce him, and she expected a storm of protest bota:
froz bim ( in Havana) and her father and step-mother, both of whos were
“puritanic" despite their "progressive" convictions. She adéed that she
expected Snrique Ramirez to rush over from Havana as soon as he received
her letter and to appeal to her fzther and step-zother to save his mar-
risge. She, however, insisted to LIKIiG/3 that she hed made up her mibd
that she woulé go through with the divorce. She added tzat for this reason
she did uot wish to live with her father and had decidei to stay with.
her friend, Carmen Molina, until the divopce papers were through and the
storm had blown over. She added that she did not particularly like being
@ house-guest in the sali aprtment of Carmen *olinc, bat at the iunaitd
