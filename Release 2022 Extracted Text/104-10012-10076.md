Warren Commission Report: Article on the Investigatian Condi
District Attorney Garrison :

‘AGTIOM REQUIRED - REFERENCES

‘

1. We are forwarding herewith a reprint of the article "A Reporter At Large:
Garrison", published in THE NEW YORKER, 13 July, 1968. It was written by
Edward Jay Epstein, himself author of a book, ("Inquest"), critical of the
Warren Commission Report. 7

2. The wide-spread campaign of adverse criticism of the U.S.,.most recently -
again provoked by the assassination of Senator Robert Kennedy, appears to have
revived foreign interest in the assassination of his brother, the late President
Kennedy, too, The forthcoming trial of Sirhan, accused of the murder of Senator
Kennedy, can be expected to cause @ new wave of criticism and.suspicion against

death of President Kennedy, an alleged "conspiracy", and about the possible
involvement of Federal agencies, notably the FBI and CIA. i

3. The article is not meant for reprinting in any media. It is forwarded
primarily for your information and for the information of all Station personnel.

evidence of any such conspiracy. In this context, assets may have explain to
their audiences certain basic facts about the U.S, judicial system, its separation
of state and federal courts and the fact that judges and district attorneys in the
states are usually elected, not appointed: consequently, D.A. Garrison can continue
in office as long as his constituents re-elect him, Even if your assets have to
discuss this in order to refute-<or at least weaken--anti-U.8. propaganda of ~~

personality in the U.S.) must be strictly avo: .
