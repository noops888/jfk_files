attention of DEA either as potential informants or as

conducted by DEA, there were indication's that these

individuals had past records of "political and revolú-

DPOB: 16 June 1927,

GARCIA (at one time a naturaliied U.S.

citizen/18 May 1945 in South Carolina), becane a

V'enezuelan citizen ca 1962. GARCIA has a long history

as a political thug since pre-Batista dajs in Cuba.

He was a member of the Union Insurrectional Revo-

lucionaria (UIR) in Cuba along with Fidel Castro and

other persons who were involved in political assasi-

He claims to have served with the U.S. 82nd

Airborne Division from 1945-47 and to have returned

to Cuba thereafter to attend the University of Havana

legedly committed by GARCIA.

In 1953 he became a

bodyguard for Costa Rican President FIGUERES, who

It is believed that GARCIA's

fast rise in the Venezuelan governnent is based on his

earlier service to Accion Democratica (AD) exiles in

Costa Rica,

where he revortedly eliminated several

to kill BETANCOURT.

When BETANCOURT

president of Verezuela (1959-64), GARCIA was

appointed a division chief in the Directorate General

of Police (DIGEPOL) "prevention (DISIP). GARCIA left

now the Directorate for the Services

of Intelligence and

Venezuela for Miami In 1964 for health reasons (ulcers)

and during this stay in Miami worked at the Venezuelan

Consulate.

He returned to Venezuela in 1966 and re-

portedly held positions within the l'enezuelan Ministry

of Interior (exact positions.not known).

1969 GARCIA was assigned as First Secreiary to the

Venezuelan Embassy

in Georgeto.n,

He returned

to Venezuela sometime during 1970 or 1971 and was

Manuel De ARMAS. DPOB:

06 November 1947;

Havana, Cuba, naturalized U.S. citizen living in Miami.

On 17 October 1975 one Manuel De ARMAS contacted our

overt Domestic Contact Division

(DCD) office in Miami

offering his services as a doubic agent.

Following are

excerpts from two DCD Reports dated 20 October 1975 and

19 january 1976 based on debriefings of De ARIAS: While

in Cuba De ARVAS claimed to have been the neighbor of.

Raul BETANCOURT, the brother of the former Venczuelan

President Romulo

BETANCCURT, and his two daughters:

Antonieta and Mariela, who was De ARMAS' girl friend:

De ARMAS' mother decided in 1962 that Subject should

leave Cuba, which he did.

In 1975, De ARMAS found out

that his two joung cousins had been placed in an orphan-

age in Cuba.

He made contact with Mariela BETANCOURT,

telling her

that he was fed

un with the U.S. system of

government in order to gain her attention on the matter

of taking his cousins out of Cuba.

Mariela asked him

if he would be willing to work for the Cuban Government

and he replied he rould if it would help the youngsters.

Mariela then told De ARMAS to go to Caracas and meet

with her sister Antonieta.

De ARMAS went to Caracas on

02 October 1975 and met with Antonieta,

but no proposals

were made on the possibility of his working for the

Cuban Government.

On 17 October 1975 De ARMAS again

called Mariela and was told that he should return to

Venezuela to hold more talks with Antonieta and

"other

people." After talking with Mariela on 17 October 1975,

De ARilAS called

our DCD/Miami Office because as a U.S.

itizen he clained that he did not want to get involve

with the Cuban Governnent unless he had this Agency's

approval.

De ARMIS graciously olfered his services as

a double agent.

He called DCD/Miami on 20 October 1975

No mention of drugs was made on this

trip but according to De ARMAS he was taken to the Cuban

Embassy in Caracas on 12 February 1976, where he was

allgedly approached to work for the Cuban Government

in an intelligence capacity.

De ARMAS reported these

events to DEA Caracas on 12 .February 1976; he was ad-

vised to return to the U.s.

Following a revier of all information on the

that there is no data or other evidence to suggest an

outside organization is attempting to manipulate these

individuals in an operation aired at discrediting che

U.S. Government and DEA. le believe there may be

collusion among the three Subjects located in Caracas,

probably to assist one another in nefarious schemes to
