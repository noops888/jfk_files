backgrounds of five Cuban exiles who have come ‘to the
attention of DEA either as potential informants or as H
liaison contacts: According. to preliminary checks ’
conducted by DEA, there were indications that these
individuals had past records of “political and revoli-
tionary intrigue." DEA, concerned that it may be the
target of a provocation operation by another govern-
ment, requested this Agency's assessment of the
situation. This memorandum contains the results of a
check of cur Headquarters records on these individuals,

3. Orlando GARCIA Vasquez. DPOB: 16 June 1927,
Havana, Cuba CARC. at one time a naturalized U-S,
citizen/18 May 1945 in South Carolina). became a
Venezuclan citizen ca 1962. GARCIA has a long history
as a political thug since pre-Batista days in Cuba.

He was a member of the Union Insurrectional Revo-
lucionaria (UIR) in Cuba along with Fidel Castro and
other persons who were involved in Political assasi-
nations. He claims to have scrved with the U.S. 82nd
Airborne Division from 1945-47 and to have returned

to Cuba thereafter to.attend the University of Havana
on the GI Bill. About mid-52 Subject left Cuba for
Miami because of a scandal in Cuba over a crime al-
Jegedly committed by GARCIA. In 1953 he became a
bodyguard for Costa Rican President FIGUERES, who
introduced him to Romulo BETANCOURT, who was then in

cexile in Costa Raca. It is believed that GARCIA's

fast rise in the Venezuelan government is based on his
earlier service to Accion Democratica (AD) exiles in
Costa Rica, where he reportedly eliminated several

- gunmen sent to kill BETANCOURT. When BETANCOURT

became’ president of Verezuela (1959-64), GARCIA was
appointed a division chief in the Directorate General
of Police (DIGEPOL), now the Directorate for the Services
of Intelligence and Preventicn (DISIP}. GARCIA left
Venezuela for Miami in 1964 for health reasons (ulcers)
and’ during this stay in Miami worked at the Venezuelan
Consulate. He returned to Venezuela in 1966 and re-
portedly held positions within the Venezuelan Ministry
of Interior (exact Positions not known). In August
1869 GARCIA Kas assigned as First Secretary to the
Venezuelan Embassy in Georgetown, Guyana. He returned
to Venezuela sometime during 1970 or 1971 and was
assigned as Special Assessor (Advisor), Ministry of
Foreign Relations, where he was mainly concerned with
Venezuelan national border incidents and violations.
According to information dated July 1974, GARCIA was
appointed to head a special foreign intelligence
service within the Ministry of Interior:

In Novenber 1973 our representative in Caracas
Was queried oy DEA Caracas concerning a report which
was prepared on 06 September 1973 in Miami by S

Michael D. Brom, which accused GARCIA of b
volved in narcotics trafficking



SUBJECT: Cuban Exiles Involved with DEA Page 4

T DEA Caracas was advised that
\ DEA Caracas was advised _

[Although it is known
that GARCIA has associated with known traffickers, no
hard facts concerning his direct involvement in
narcotics have been uncovered. GARCIA has been
escribed over the years as a political thug, a
murderer, a con-man, a pathological liar, and a
“bright, aggressive rogue who is ruthless: when neces~
sary." GARCIA has apparently always sided with the
men in power and seems to have gaincd the confidence

of many leaders in the countries around the Caribbean. ~

A DEA ROI, dated 10 October 1974, written by S.A. Brom
at Miami reported that GARCIA was in the United States

and was in contact with Ricardo MORALES (sce paragraph -

4). GARCIA made several trips to the U.S. on behalf
of the GOV during 1974-75.. Your, Agency is referred
to the FBI for information concerning GARCIA's
activities in the U.S.

5. Justo LARAZO Alfonso. A check of our records

turned up one Justo Alfonso (no DPOB), a Cuban-exile,

who was active in anti-Castro organizations in the
late 1960's. Your Agency is referred to the FBI for
information on this individual.

6. Manuel De ARMAS. DPOB: 06 November 1947,

Havana, Cuba; naturalized U.S. citizen living in Miami,

On 17 October 1975 one Manucl De ARMAS contacted our
overt Domestic Contact Division (DCD) office in Miami
offering -his services as a doubic agent. Following are
excerpts from two DCD Reports dated 20 October 1975 and
19 January 1976 based on debriefings of De ARIAS: While
in Cuba De ARMAS claimed to have been the neighbor of.
Raul BETANCOURT, the brother of the former Venezuelan
President Ronulo BETANCCURT, and his two daughters.
Antonieta and Mariela, who was De ARMAS' girl friend.
De ARMAS' mother decided in 1962 that Subject should
leave Cuba, which he did. In 1975, De ARMAS found out
that his two young cousins had been placed in an orphan-
age in Cuba. He madé contact with Mariela BETANCOURT,
telling her that he was fed up with the U.S. system of
government in order to gain her attention on the matter
of taking his cousins out of Cuba. Mariela asked him
iff he would be willing to work for the Cuban Government
and he replied he would if it would help the youngsters.
Mariela then told-De ARMAS to go to Caracas and meet
with her sister Antonieta. De ARMAS went to Caracas on

02 October 1975 and met with Antonieta, but no proposals

were. made on the possibility of his working for the”
Cuban Government. On 17 October 1975 De ARMAS again
called Mariela and was told that he should return to
Venezuela to. hold more’talks with Antonieta and “other
people." After talking with Mariela on 17 October 1975,
De ARMAS called our DCD/Miami Office because as a U.S.
citizen he claimed that he did not want to get involved
with the Cuban Government unless he had this Agesicy's
approval. De ARMAS graciously offered his services as
a double agent. He called DCD/Miami on 20 October 1975

and again on 07 January 1976 to resubmit his offer and
insisted on a tesponse, He was told that his offer
would be forwarded through the appropriate channels.
(Note: Our records show that there was no CIA interest
in De ARMAS, past or present.) On 13 January 1976 our
representative in Miani was told that the FBI Miami
office had been in contact with Subject and wished to
verify De ARMAS' clain that he was in contact with our
DCD Miami office. The FBI also asked whether this
Agency had any objection for further FBI contact with
Subject. on the "same basis they had previously." (Note:
The type or length of FBI contact with De ARMAS is not
known. Your office is referred to the FBI for additional

information.)

On 04 February 1976 DEA Caracas received a
DEA message (# 02406) which requested permission for
Miami CI Manuel Leonardo De ARMAS to travel to Caracas
for a one kilo heroin, buy from a Colombian whom De ARMAS
had previously met through a Naria A. BETANCOURT. Per-
mission was given and De ARMAS arrived in Caracas on 11
February 1976. No mention of drugs was made on this
trip but according to De ARMAS he was taken to the Cuban
Embassy in Caracas on 12 February 1976, where he was
allgedly approached to work for the Cuban Government
in an intelligence capacity. De ARMAS reported these
events to DEA Caracas on 12.February 1976; he was ad-
vised to return to the U.S. Our representative in

Caracas was briefed o; se by SAIC Duncan
on 13 February 1976. was very interested
in having De ARMAS return to Caracas for use asa

/ A background check was conducted

“on De ARNAS at that tine and on 20 February 1976 the

FBI representative in Miami reported the following in-
formation: "The FBI has been avoiding contact with
De ARMAS for the past couple of months since he was
assessed as a ‘mentally unbalanced fabricator’. De
ARMAS gave a press interview in Miami in early February
1976 in which he clained an affiliation with virtually
every U.S. intelligence agency. He said that he had
worked for CIA and had attended a CIA training school.
The press interview has thus far not been published,
Presumably because it is too far fetched. De ARMAS

received a bank loan of $1,500 in Miami and has‘defaulted
on some $800 of the amcunt, The final note on De ARMAS
is that he reccived a general discharge from the U.S.
Army with a notation that he had psychological and
behavioral problems." The gist of the aforementioned
FBI information has been passed to DEA Caracas. All
agencies concerned agree that contact with De ARMAS
should cease. De ARMAS again -contacted S.A. Duncan in
Caracas on 26 February 1976 and requested a meeting; he
said that the request was not drug related, but con- ie
cerned the "Cuban matter." S.A. Duncan advised De ARMAS.
that he was on his own and that DEA would not get in-
volved. As DEA Headquarters is aware, De ARMAS re-
portedly left for Mexico o/a 26 February 1976. We have
no subsequent reporting on his movements,

are own to have had past connections: GARCIA Vazquez

was in contact with GARCIA in the
mite tates during 1974-75. Although there have been
allegations aimed at. nd GARCIA over the years
accusing them of being Cuban agents and/or of narcotics
involvement, these Claims have not been substantiated
and for the most part are based on circumstantial

evidence or guilt by association, which happens

operation. A check of our records reflected no past
intelligence backgrounds for LAZARO Alfonso and De
ARMAS, . While there is a paucity of background infor-
mation in our files on Justo LAZARO, in our opinion he-
is attempting to extort moncy from the U.S. Government
based on a poorly conceived idea of his own. The De
ARMAS case appears to have been resolved satisfactorily
for all concerned. All Agencies concerned agree he is
unstable and contact should be either severed, or if
unavoidable, it should be made with extreme caution.

8. Following'a review of all information on the
foregoing Subjects available at DEA Headquarters and
at this Agency's Headquarters, we are of the opinion
that there is no data or other evidence to suggest an
outside organization is attempting to manipulate these
individuals in an: operation aimed at discrediting the
U.S. Government and DEA. We believe there may be
collusion among the three Subjects located in Caracas,
probably to assist one another in nefarious schemes to - a
One degree or another; however, the ‘information on
hand does not suggest their motivation would go beyond
personal, financial or influence objectives. . While one
cannot absolutely rule out the possibility, for example,
that ‘the Cuban Service has run one or more of the afore-
mentioned Subjects at DEA for the purpose of harrassing Ef
the U.S. Government, there is no conclusive information 2
in our files to connect them with Cuban intelligence or
a Venezuelan entity whose interests are inimical to the is
