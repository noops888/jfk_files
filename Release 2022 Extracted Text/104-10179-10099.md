=0,

Ray has been described by many as an ambitious man

who will sacrifice anything OR ANYBODY for these ambitions.

Mr. Adolfo Arenas has said that the people who wor

ked with him durina the resistance against Batista say these

two instances show he will sacrifice people to obtain hie am-

bitions.-

He planned

an assault on a gun shop in Havana in the

month of April 1958 knowing:

Ist. - That it was impossible to do because it was at

a time the auto traffic was at its peak.-

2nd. - There were not enough guns at the shop worth

while stealing.

3rd. - Even though they would have been successful

their ultimate goal the attack on the Cabaña fortress would

only bring death to the attackers.-

Yet he sent those people to their death to have more

martyrs but did not go himself.-

Mhen he was throin out of the cabinet post he inven

ted some technical Job to be located in the Coluabla barrackto

He maintained himself close to Fidel Castro until he saw Cas-

tro would not pass through a Cabinet session for approval the

law creating the job he wanted: - During this time he endorsed

publicly and in private conversations his approval of Castro e

policiaa..

Although there is no proff of him ever belonging to

the Communist Party it is believed that he will deal and ba-

come one if convenient to him elther nationally or internatio

nally. -

Considers him a fanatic that will pursue an idea without

regard to tho welfare of his family, even though unimportant. -

Unpractical and bad manager to the extreme that he has

falled in three business enterprises he tried to develop.-

Extrcmely dangerous in the government due to the programs

he belelves in, he says although he has no knowledge of communist

connection he follows the same principles as Fidel Castro and be-

lelves the measures taken by Castro are good. -

Unmerciful, a deffect he showed when he was Secretary of

Public Works he through out hundreds of employces without due cause,

he destroyed every successful contractor that existed to that mo-

ment. -
