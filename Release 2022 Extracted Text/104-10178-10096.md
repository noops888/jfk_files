MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

:
i

SUBJECT: Luis Clements POSADA-Carriles

REFERENCES: a. Memo for Record, 26 June 1967, by LRH,
same subject
b. Williameson/Heaze Telephone Conversation, —
28 June 1967

1, In my meeting with the Department of Justice today, I
confirmed that POSADA-Carriles was our man. I outlined the pre-
liminary information we had developed on the transactions between
him and one Lefty Rosenthal.

2. Justice was advieed that our information disclosed that
| POSADA-Carriles had passed silencers and grenadea to Rosenthal
i daring July 1965, and that in October 1966 he had furnished pencils
. Lalso stated that it was our understanding that POSADA-
ectaiee was in contact with FDI/Miami and that it had been advised
of these dealings. Justice-was told that the itema involved were not
| of Agency origin. It was emphasized, however, that this was our
i preliminary conclusion and that we would undertake to verify it.

H 3. Justice acknowledged that FBI reporting disclosed
} POSADA-Carriles as its contact but apparently the details
|

what vague. To make a federal case agaiast Roserthal because of his
suspected involvement in the bombings, it will be necessary to show
7 . that the iteme used were obtained through interstate commerce. A
1 \ preliminary reading suggests prosecution under Title i8 Section 837.
Out of concern for the allegation of entrapment, Justice asked that



“4

we mupply answore to the following: (a) did POSADA-Carriles

Volunteer himselfto the FBI or did it approach him initially;

(b). who informed the FBI of the July 1965 deal - the Agency or

*POSADA-Carriles;'(c) on what date wae thie information given;
Ad) oimilarty as regards tho-October 1966 transaction, the dato

. the information farnished asd by whom; (e) what were POSADA-

: 8 courees for the items or their components; (f) were

7 \ these: sources within or without the State of Florida? And inci- _

: dentally ‘were we awéro that supposedly POSADA-Carriles realised
"a 'profit™ for furnishing the October 1966 items and that he tried
a eas to turn it into the "company"? While I agreed to

on undertake to obtain the information requested, I suggested that

ee thuch of it might be readily available from thé FBI. Justice con-
iu ceded this and = to have further discussions with it.

4. Daring the course of the meeting the interesting
: . hypothesis was suggested to the effect that POSADA-Carriles
i : might have been "moonlighting" for Rosenthal, and only when he
i began to feel the pressure did he start reporting to the Agency and
the FBI

| 5. Under strictly controlled conditions with POSADA-
ut Carriles acting as a conduit, Justice is considering the possibility
of assisting Rosenthal to obtain his needed items, whereupon he
will be arrested immediately for possession. [ told them while we
might be willing to have POSADA-Carril o used we were under-
standably concerned over the adverse comment thai our employse's
involvement.could generate.

i 6, Opa matter that may be related: one Alhert LARRAIN

! Maestre is alleged to have admitted to POSADA-Carriles that he haa
i been involved in the bombings with Rosenthal and to have said more

j explosives were needed. LARRAIN Maestre is a fugitive under a

H “narcotics endictment having formerly resided at 153 East 57th Street,
iH New York, New York. Do we have any information on this person?
