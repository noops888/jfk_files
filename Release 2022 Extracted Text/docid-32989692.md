END THE DRAFT REGIONAL CONFERENCE

SEPTEMBER 17 - 19

.«. to make the draft inoperable in the Northeast

‘ A regional conference for people interested in mounting an intensive
nonviolent campaign, based on the assumption that there is no reason
for anyone to be drafted into the U.S. military.

A campaign, not a demonstration or series of demonstrations, not a
mobilization, parade or rally as appropriate as all these are, but

| a program of comparatively long and specific duration aimed at
immobilizing Selective Service throughout our area through all levels
of action, persuasion and education, engaging every possible community
resource.

We look forward. to a decentralized effort witn a common approach.

A major purpose of the conference is to identify specific goals
realizable through nonviolent action, attainable goals along the road
to the eradication of the draft. We need experiences of real success
to energize the movement and to bring the ultimate goal closer.

Come together to work out strategies and to learn skills in:
-~ noncooperation :
~~ nonviolent direct action at draft boards and induction stations
-~ getting draft board members to resign
-~ overcooperation
-- mounting a broad based educational campaign
-~ making draft information centers more effective

’ -- draft board research
-~ mill-ins
~~ early morning shows

TIME: From dinnertime (about 6 p.m.) Friday, September 17, to
lunch, Sunday, September 19.

COST: $12 covers room, board and program. Please register in advance
with a $5 (unreturnable) deposit for each person plannin;; to
attend. If you're really short of bread we can arrange sometiin,;.

a deserter who is now in hiding. Among the articles
taken from the trio and reporteclv still held by

the police department was a notebook which allegedly
contained names and numbers of members of "movement"
contacts in Quebec, Canada, Algeria, and domestically.
Ste stated that she felt the Elizabeth P.D. had not
really gone through the notebook or they would have
turned it over to the FBI. She based this conclusion
on the fact that SMART has made no mention to her of
FBI attempts to locate him. She stated that her personal
friends had helped hide the deserter before moving
him on. She advised she would forward the name of the
deserter to New Haven so that the New Haven Office of
the VVAW could make sure the deserter's name did not
appear in any of their records.

The above information is being furnished to Newark as
it may be of some intelligence value.

New Haven upon learning the identity of the deserter will
forward same to Newark as possibility exists he may

be Bureau fugitive. Newark should be most discreet in
any future action on this information as it would un-
doubtedly led to exposure of New Haven informant.

7 SEPTEMBER i7- 19, 1971

On Septenber 20, 1971, a source who has furnished
’ reliable information in the past, furnished the following
information: :

On September 17, 1971, approximately forty
people representing various peace groups throughout New
England met at the Communal Farm of the New England
Committee for Non Violent Action in Voluntown, Connecticut,
for the End the Draft Regional Conference.

The New England Committee for Non
Violent Action (NECNVA) is self-described
as a non-partisan pacifist organization
formed to protest the defense policy of
the Government and to “enable millions of-
Americans to resist by non-violent means-=
any tyranny or foreign invasion.” It is
headquartered on a 40 acre farm in
Voluntown, Connecticut, where conferences,
. weekend seminars, work camps and training
. , programs in non-violence are held.
: : The ate of the meeting during the evening
o : of September 17, 1971, was to establish workship guide-

lines for the. rest of the weekend. ART-BOYD of Cambridge, ~

Massachuséet'$s" A American Friends Service Committee, appeared
to be leading the group in discussion, At 2:00 a.m. the
meeting was still bogged down in total disagreement. The

only tiling that was agreed upon was that they wanted

to end the draft and if necessary hamper the function
of the draft boards and induction centers, but although
@ great many ideas were noted, no more than four or
five people could agree on any one point, and then

the agreement of that small group was net in total.
Either they disagreed ideologically or politically

or on the different needs of different areas or on

. the role of liberated women or many other similar points.
It also became quite apparent that none of the people
there really wanted to wind up in jail, and they showed
much revolutionary fervor until it became a matter of
committing themselvss to a cause that might place them-
selves in jeopardy. The different ideas were placed

on a blackboard and discussed by various members of

the groups, and dealt with the following subjects:

‘Draft board "buddy" system (make friends
with members of draft boards and try to
convince them to resign);

Boarding busses containing inductees;
Chaining oneself to busses for inductees; _
Destroying files;

Appearing at draft boards and induction
centers dressed as death;

Boycotting busses owned by draft board
members ;

Swamping draft boards with varied mail,

i.e. swamping draft boards with requests

to review individual files, daily notifications
of health status and/or changes, having

women flooding draft boards with requests

for equal induction status;

SEPTEMBER 17-19, 1971

Start campaign in junior and senior
high schools concerning draft counseling;

Leafleting, picketing for use of harassing
tactics against draft board members

which would include picketing their homes
and places of employment.

: At one point, a spokesman who remained unnamed
for a group tvhich he did not identify, made a short
.speech concerning the fact that he and his people felt
that the overall group was doing nothing more than re-
stating things that had already. been tried in other
areas of the country and that this meeting had nothing
new to offer and that they would also become entangled
and crippled by its own diversity, and that he was
pulling out the next morning. Shortly thereafter a
: young man got up and made an hysterical speech about

ae the group becoming violent in that it was voicing open
disagreement and that if it did not stop, he would ex-
plow and jump on somebody. He continued raving and
became more emotional and less coherent and screamed
again that he would "jump out of his skin and onto
someone if the disagreement continued." He finally
sat down, muttered to himself, and shook for the remainder
of the meeting. At 2:00 a.m. the meeting ended without
the group even being able to agree on the hour for
breakfast.

At approximately 9:30 a.m. on September 18,
1971, it was decided to discuss the procedure all over
again. Approximately one hour later it was decided
that nothing was being accomplished and so the meeting
broke down into groups of 10 individuals, but it appeared
that even at this level nothing could be accomplished.
The discussion came to an end around 12 noon.

such as 18 year old voters,

11. Mass education campaigns directed at the

12, Boycotts and strikes,

13, Negotiations with United States Senators,

The approach taken was to Lock at the draft to see
what makes it operate, and to try to find a way to halt it,
The campaign's criteria were:

1, Its relevance to the publiq

2. Different tactics designed so anyone can fit
in,

3, Positive outlook and alternatives,
4, Build up momentum,

5, Clearly define goals and clearly differentiate
between means and goals,

6. Have built-in short-range successes ~ victories.
7. Wise use of the media for an education campaign.

On September 17, 1971, the group became somewhat
divided as to the purpose of the weekend, and three people
from Binghamton, New York, left the Conference, Some people
wanted to discuss local tactics and actions, but not work on
a campaign,

On September 18, 1971, the Conferenced broke up into
small groups to go over actions, education or legal methods for
the campaign; These groups were to use former experiences and _
creative ideas fo work for the campaign, One group then divided
into two smaller groups, one discussing an education campaign,
and the other direct action, In the afternoon,

the whole group met to discuss the morning and plans were
made for an evening game. The game was a role-playing of
a@ community. The group assigned different persons to
represent seven parts of the community which functioned
“as usual"; campaigners, students, blacks, parents, the
Chamber of Commerce, Draft Board and the City Government,
The game shoved those attending the Conference where and
how problems arigce, and pointed out the serious lack of
communication within the community.

On September 19, 1971, in thenmprning, the group
returned to discuss the plans for a campaign, No direct
action campaign was agreed to or planned, but persons
attending made contacts with others of similar interests,
and plans for a future action or actions may result ata
later date,

Those who discussed direct action in the smaller
group alluded to above, on September 18, 1971, included \
Tom er eaeaae Fraser, Jean Kijek, Rita Neimeyer, Jack
Shattuck, ndres, Gary Lynes and Linda Meadowcroft, i,
The group started by discussing the value of draft board 4
raids, like the recent Camden, New Jersey, adtion, It
was the general consensus that that type of raid at night
wassnot very successful in ending the draft, In fact, it .
was agreed that the Selective Service System has copies of
files, and the damage done is to the registrants applying
for deferments, The group also agreed that such actions
antagonize the public by the way they are done,

Tom Cornell stated that any direct action on a
draft board office should be announced and done openly.
He suggested going in’and pouring blood on the files. Gary
Lynes suggested that they aim the action at draft board
members by pouring sugar in their car gas tanks, or in the
bus gas tanks on the days of physicals at AFEES,

The group discussed using the time of physicals
to tour the AFEES and millaaround., Cornell suggested going
to the office to do an action called "Spectre" ~ walk in
dressed like death and screech and open a bag of animal
intestines, seemingly pouring them from your body, Another
person suggested the “buddy" system of selecting a draft
board member to picket, write to, talk with, et cetera,
to get the member to quit or make changes.

Cornell suggested sitting in mourning in draft
boards, or “hiring” an Irish professional mourner to wail
and cry over the deaths of Vets,

No final plan or campaign was decided on in the
direct action section of the Conference, It was strongly
felt that getting to know the board members as well as
possible was a good method tobegin making yourself and your
views known, over and over.

Mike Murphy, of Englewood, New Jersey, summarized i
the final results of the Conference as follows:

Art Boyd of AFSC, Cambridge, Massachusetts,
offered the "final Draft Newsletter" to serve as the
communication link for the campaign, toinform people of
activities, The goal of the campaign is to make the draft
as inoperative as possible, and to show the public alternative
Systems of society. (Alternative systems meaas other ases
for draft board and AFEES facilities), a
The activities suggested are: a "peace bridge" for
the American exiles in Canada; the so-called "Charlottesville
Pledge" was acceptable to many (pledged non-~cooperatica
witb draft by masses of people); Paul Frazer's suggestion of
having people register at draft boards for activities other
than the draft, and alternative buses at AFEES to offer
transportation to a constructive alternative; destruction of
- billboards bearing draft advertisements, particularly on
- Federal highways, where, it was said, billboards are illegal;
and the previously explained harrassment of "buddies". on
local boards.

VOLUNTOWN, CONNECTICUT,
SEPTEMBER 17-19, 1971 :

Paul Fraser told about a plan, mentioned above,
to have 500 Canadian exiles meet at the bridge to return
to the United States, The plan is to cause a backlog
in the legal machinery of the draft and make it open to
the public,

A future follow-up meeting may be held, to
compare what has been done and to. work toward a joint
action,

During the course of the Conference, Sister
Elizabeth Hillman of Tewksbury, Massachusetts, advised that
she is a friend of Father Philip Berrigan, She said that
the arrest of John Peter Grady in the Camden break-in
was a real blow to the "Movement." She said Grady is the
key person to many of the actions (which ones unspecified),
and he knew who to contact and how to put people in touch
with one another. She stated that she hasinet participated
in any of the actions, She declared. that no one had
expected that they would all get arrested, so no provisions
had been made,

Philip and Daniel Berrigan are currently
serving Federal prison terms for
convictions stemming from draft file
destruction in Maryland,

Also during the Conference, Mike De Gregory told
a story about the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)
coming to the home of one Mr. Cunningham in Camden, New
Jersey, looking for Grady, After a brief altercation,
Agents left and later returned in force, He said that a
meeting was going on in the house when Agents first
approached it,

On September 19, 1971, there was a liturgy and
vigil at Danbury Federal Correctional Institution, Danbury,
Connecticut, At about 11:15 am, Fred Lord, Jena Kijek,

left CNVA for Danbury. Mike True was the coordinator
of the liturgy.

About 34 persons were present outside the main
gates of Danbury Prison, mest from the Worcester,
Massachusetts "Floating Parish," From about 1; 15 pm
until about 1:45 pm, the liturgical service was conducted,
A vigil began thereafter, Nearly everyone but about
five persons who remained for a continuing vigil then
left the prison «t about 2:15 for lunch, From lunch,
they returned home. It appeared that the group at Danbury
was strongly and emotionally pro-Bertigan Brothers, and
they all called for those present to return October 2,
1971, to the Danbury area for a demonstration, the location
for which is still in litigation, Among those present J
at this liturgy and vigil were Mariai-Siinde1, of the Coww:

- On Octobér 2nd, wage marching on Danbury Federal Beison -- and on prisons
* around the country — to unite ourselves with the Danbury Resisters and other

. (prisoners.

On August 6th, the Danbury Resisters released a statement and began a fast
* and work stoppage which, in Fr. Daniel Berrigan's words, "called attention to
the duplicity and non-accountability of the Federal Parole Board" and-which "dared

to link crimes against domestic prisoners to crimes against Vietnamese pricuners."”

. They demanded:

1. Major reforms of a parole system that has recently boasted_a 12.6%

decline in parole grants.
An early reivew of the parole application of Fr. Philip Berrigan
. and a parole grant for Fr. Daniel Berrigan, whose poor health has
led Danbury doctors to predict continuing physical deterioration
so long as he remains in prison.
3. An end to the U. S. -funded tiger cages used for political prisoners

in South Vietnam.

2,

Demands issued by a similar group ui the Conmittee on Prisons of South

Vietnam —~ have been added as our own, These include:

%
1. The end to U. S. funding and staffing of prisons and interrogation

camps for political suspects in South Vietnam.
2. The release of all those who are sick, disabled, and are being held

without trial, or whose sentences have now expired.

The October 2nd date coincides with the non-elections of South Vietnam in
order to make clearer the connection between the political use of prisons in

“both the U. S. and South Vietnam, and most especially, imprisoning of acti-

vists for peace and justice in both countries.

What is upsetting our campuses are the real ond terrifyingly
large -ond difficult problems besetting our whole society. One of
these has a special impact on the campus. That is the draft.

Nothing-now so poisons academic life in America as the draft.
To draft about 400,000 men each year, we keep about 5 million
young men between the ages of 19 and 26 continuously on tenter-
hooks. And don’t think the young women aren't there, foo! Our en-
tire younger generation, students, and even more nonstudents, is
kept in a continuous state of insecurity and uncertainty, unable to
plan their lives,

Almost all the students | teach were born since World Wor 11.
Just after World Wor 11, a series of new and abnormal procedures
came into American life. We regarded them at the time as tempo-
rary aberrations. Ye thought we would get back to normal American
life some day.

But those procedures have stayed with us now for more than
20 years, ond those students of mine have never known cnything
else, They think those things are normal. They think we've always
had a Pentagon, that we have always had a big army .and that we
alwoys had a draft. But those are all new things in American life,
and {| think thot they ore incompatible with what America meant
before.

A peacetiine draft is the most unAmericon thing | know, All the
time 1 was growing up, | was told about oppressive Central Euro-
pean countries ond Russia, where young men were forced into the
army, and | was told whot they did about it, They chopped off a
finger, or shot off a couple of toes; or better still, if they could
manage it, they come to this country. And we understood that, ond
sympathized, and were glad to welcome them.

wet

—Nvv"88262~Docld:32989692-Page-80.

aN,
rg



Now, by present estimates, 4,000 to 6,000 Americans of draft
age have left this country for Canada, another 2,000 or 3,000 have
gone to Europé and it looks as though many more are preparing to
emigrate. :

There are choices in getting rid of the draft. { think that when
we get rid of the draft, we. must also cut back.on the size of the
armed forces. It seems to me that in peacetime a total of one mil-
lion men is surely enough, :

1 don’t think we con live with the present: military estoblish-
ment ond its $80—100 billion a year budget and keep America any-
thing like we have known it in the past. It is cgrrupting the life of
the whole country. It is buying up everything in sight: industries,
bonks, investors, universities, and lately it seems also to have
bought up the labor unions.

1 say that the Vietnam war is just an immediate incident, be-
cause so long as we keep that big an army, it will always find
things to do. If the Vietnam war stopped tomorrow, with that big a
militory estoblishment, the chances are that we would be in a
nother such adventure abroad or at home before you knew it.

Dont’ reform the draft - - get rid of it.

Captioned organization continues to maintain a

half dozen individuals, Their activities are anti-war in
nature and this case is currently in a closed status at New
Haven, :

(an 624-PSI}continues periodic contact with NECNVA and
their activities have been handled under individual case caption
such as the "War Tax Resistance" (WTR) and the recent bicycle
sojow®through New England by WIR participants.

Their activities have been non~violent in naiure and
poorly attended receiving little or no publicity in Cona, e
However, New Haven will continue coverage of the farm through
informants for intelligence purposes as the farm does offer
anonymity and could be logically used by those individuals in
a fugitive status.

~HON=VIOLERT. ACTION (RECNVA)

According to literature distributed in the
past by the Committee for Non-Violent Action (CKVA),
this group was originally formed in 1957 as the National
Committee for Non-Violent Action Against Nucl ear Weapons.

A press release issued June 1, 1960, by the
CNVA, 158 Grand Street, New York City, noted that the
CNVA described itself as-a non-partisan pacifist organi-
zation which would hegin to center its activities in the
New London-Groton, Connecticut area, but activities would
also "spread from New York to Boston in a series of peace
walks, demonstrations, and public meetings."

A leaflet distributed by CNVA in 1960 described
the intent of the organization to protest the defense
policy of the Government and to "enable millions of Americans
to resist by non-violent means----any tyranny or foreign
invasion." The leaflet listed certain acceptable resistance
techniques as "refusal to serve in the armed forces or work
in military industries; refusal to pay Federal income taxes
wnich go for guns and bombs,"

"The Hartford Courant", a daily newspaper published
in Hartford, Connecticut, noted on August 20, 1961, that the
CNVA "maintains two offices in this country, one being in Rew
York and the other in New London, Connecticut."

A solicitation letter dated September 29, 1960,
noted that members of NECNVA, an adjunct for CNVA, held the
initial meeting of the WECNVA at New London, Connecticut, on
September 25, 1960.

Literature distrituted by NBCNVA in 1968, noted,
"Today the NECNVA conduets a region-wide program in six New
England States in eastern New York State, and occasionally
across the border with Canadians in the saeg movement,"

"Mrs, Marjorie Swann, 51, said ina 2 telephone . a

information in -the past, advised that Marjorie Swann resides
in Ashby, Massachusetts,.and she is employed nearby in
the office of Cushing Academy, a private boarding school:
in Ashburnham, Massachusetts. : :

. This sotirce went on’ to say that Marjorie

Swann is one of the leaders in that area of the so called
"Counter Culture," who favor drug usage, havé demonstrated 7
against the war in Vietnam and who are generally opposéd *

to policies of the U.S, Government. He stated that shé*

has, on more than one occasion, been a participant in the*

"talk show" known as "Frankly Speaking,” which is ponsored

by a Fitchburg, Massachusetts, radio station. On these:

radio appearances she has promoted her ideas of organizing

people to go to North Vietnam to help work.and rebuild of
that country. atin i : cage

The .solirce advised that Swann had held a
meeting in Ashby on February 28, 1973, at the Unitarian
Church, and very few people were in attendance. He further _
advised that it was -his understanding that Swann's- promotion.
of a trip to Vietnam had practically "fizzled" and that |
many of the individuals who had initially supported Swann
and her idea had reneged on actually participating in -
such a trip. . Suet aueEe ~ : .

END THE DRAFT REGIONAL CONFERENCE

SEPTEMBER 17 - 19

«+. to make the draft inoperable in the Northeast

A regional conference for people interested in mounting an intensive
nonviolent campaign, based on the assumption that there is no reason
for anyone to be drafted into the U.S. military.

A campaign, not a demonstration or series of demonstrations, not a
mobilization, parade or rally as appropriate as all these are, but

a program of comparatively long and specific duration aimed at
immobilizing Selective Service throughout our area through all levels
of action, persuasion and education, engaging every possible community
resource.

We look forward. to a decentralized effort with a common approach.

A major purpose of the conference is to identify specific goals
realizable through nonviolent action, attainable goals along the road
to the eradication of the draft. We need experiences of real success
_ to energize the movement and to bring the ultimate goal closer.

| Come together to work out strategies and to learn skills in:
: ~~ noncooperation :
| ~~ nonviolent direct action at draft boards and induction stations
! -- getting draft board members to resign
| -- overcooperation
-- mounting a broad based educational campaign
~- making draft information centers more effective
~- draft board research
-- mill-ins
~- early morning shows

TIME: From dinnertime (about 6 p.m.) Friday, September 17, to
lunch, Sunday, September 19.

COST: $12 covers room, board and program. Please register in advance
with a $5 (unreturnable) deposit for each person plannin;; to

a deserter who is now in hiding. Among the articles
taken from the trio and reportedly still held by

the police department was a notebook which allegedly
contained names and numbers of members of "movement"
contacts in Quebec, Canada, Algeria, and domestically.
She stated that she felt the Elizabeth P.D. had not
really gone through the notebook or they would have
turned it over to the FBI. She based this conclusion
on the fact that SMART has made no mention to her of
FBI attempts to locate him. She stated that her personal
friends had helped hide the deserter before moving
him on. She advised she would forward the name of the
deserter to New Haven so that the New raven Office of
the VVAW could make sure the deserter's name did not
appear in any of their records.

The above information is being furnished to Newark as
it may be of some intelligence value.

New Haven upon learning the identity of the deserter will
forward same to Newark as possibility exists he may

be Bureau fugitive. Newark should be most discreet in
any future action on this information as it would un-
doubtedly led to exposure of New Haven informant.

THE END THE DRAFT REGIONAL CONFERENCE
IN VOLUNTOWN, CONNECTICUT
” SEPTEMBER 17-19, 1971

On September 20, 1971, a source who has furnished
- xeliable information in the past, furnished the following
information:

On September 17, 1971, approximately ae
people representing various peace groups throughout New
England met at the Communal Farm of the New England
Committee for Non Violent Action in Voluntown, Connecticut, —
for the End the Draft Regional Conference.

The New England Committee for Non

Violent Action (NECNVA) is self-described
as a non-partisan pacifist organization
formed to protest the defense policy of
the Government and to "enable millions of-
Americans to resist by nonevi olent means-= 7
any tyranny or foreign invasion." It is
headquartered on a 40 acre farm in
Voluntown, Connecticut, where conferences,
weekend seminars, work camps and training
programs in non-violence are held.

only thing that was agreed upc’ was that they wanted

to end the draft and if necessary hamper the function

of the draft boards and induction centers, but although

a@ great many ideas were noted, no more than four or

five people could agree on any one point, and then

+ the agreement of that small group was net in total.
Either they disagreed ideologically or politically

or on the different needs of different areas or on

.the role of liberated women or many other similar points.
It also became quite apparent thxt none of the people
there really wanted to wind up in jail, and they showed
much revolutionary fervor until it became a matter of
committing themselvss to a cause that might place them-
selves in jeopardy. The different ideas were placed
on a blackboard and discussed by various members of

the groups, and dealt with the following subjects:

‘Draft board "buddy" system (make friends
with members of draft boards and try to
convince them to resign);

Boarding busses containing inductees;
Chaining oneself to busses for inductees;
Destroying files;

Appearing at draft boards and induction
* centers dressed as death;

Boycotting busses owned by draft board
members;

Swamping draft boards with varied mail,

i.e. swamping draft boards with requests

to review individual files, daily notifications
of health status and/or changes, having

women flooding draft boards with requests

for equal induction status;

THE END THE DRAFT REGIONAL CONFERENC
IN VOLUNTOWN, CONNECTICUT, 5
SEPTEMBER 17-19, 1971

Start campaign in junior and’ senior
high schools concerning draft counseling;

Leafleting, picketing for use of harassing
tactics against draft board members

which would include picketing their homes
and places of employment.

: At one point, a spokesman who remained unnamed
for a group which he did not identify, made a short
.speech concerning the fact that he and his people felt
that the overall group was doing nothing more than re-
stating things that had already been tried in other
areas of the country and that this meeting had nothing
new to offer and that they would also become entangled
and crippled by its own diversity, and that he was
pulling out the next morning. Shortly thereafter a
: young man got up and made an hysterical speech about
la the group becoming violent in that it was voicing open
disagreement and that if it did not stop, he would ex-
plod and jump on somebody. He continued raving and
became more emotional and less coherent and screamed
| : again that he would "jump out of his skin and onto
| someone if the disagreement continued." He finally
“sat down, muttered to himself, and shook for the remainder
of the meeting. At 2:00 a.m. the meeting ended without
the group even being able to agree on the hour for
breakfast.

At approximately 9:30 a.m. on September 18,
1971, it was decided to discuss the procedure all over
again. Approximately one hour later it was decided
that nothing was being accomplished and so the meeting
broke down into groups of 10 individuals, but it appeared
that even at this level nothing could be accomplished.
The discussion came to an end around 12 noon.

The approach taken was to took at the draft to see

The campaign’s criteria were:

1, Its relevance to the public

2. Different tactics designed so anyone can fit
in.

3, Positive outlook and alternatives,

5, Clearly define goals and clearly differentiate
between means and goals.

On September 17, 1971, the group became somewhat
divided as to the purpose of the weekend, and three people
fromBinghamton, New York, left the Conference, Some people
wanted to discuss local tactics and actions, but not work on
a campaign, :

On September 18, 1971, the Conferenced broke up into
-small groups to go over actions, education or legal methods for
-the campaign, These groups were to use former experiences and

VOLUNTOWN, CONNECTICUT,

SEPTEMBER 17-19, 1971

the whole group met to discuss the morning and plans were
made for an evening game. The game was a role-playing of
a community, The group assigned different persons to
represent seven parts of the community which functioned
"as usual"; campaigners, students, blacks, parents, the
Chamber of Commerce, Draft Board and the City Government.
The game saowd those attending the Conference where and
how problems arise, and pointed out the serious. lack of
communication within the community.

On September 19, 1971, in themprning, the group
returned to discuss the plans for a campaign. No direct
action campaign was agreed to or planned, but persons
attending made contacts with others of similar interests,
and plans for a future action or actions may result at a
later date,

Those who discussed direct action in the smaller
group alluded to atove, on September 18, 1971, included
Tom Cornell, Paul Fraser, Jean Kijek, Rita Neimeyer, Jack
Shattuck, Ray-andres , Gary Lynes and Linda Meadowcroft,
The group started by discussing the value of draft board
raids, like the recent Camden, New Jersey, adtion, It
was the general consensus that that type of raid at night
wasnot very successful in ending the draft, In fact, it
was agreed that the Selective Service System has copies of
files, and the damage done is to the registrants applying
for deferments, The group also agreed that such actions
antagonize the public by the way they are done,

Tom Cornell stated that any direct action on a
draft board office should be announced and done openly.
He suggested going in and pouring blood on the files, Gary
Lynes suggested that they aim the action at draft board
members by pouring sugar in their car gas tanks, or in the
bus gas tanks on the days of physicals at AFEES,

END-THE-DRAFT REUIONAL CONFERENCE,
SPONSORED BY NEW ENGLAND COMMITTEE
FOR NON-VIOLENT ACTION (CNVA),
VOLUNTOWN, CONNECTICUT,

SEPTEMBER 17-19, 1971

The group discussed using the time of physicals
to tour the AFEES and millaaround, Cornell suggested going
to the office to do an action called "Spectre" - walk in
dressed like death and screech and open a bag of animal
intestines, seemingly pouring them from your body, Another
person suggested the "buddy" system of selecting a draft
board member to picket, write to, talk with, et cetera,
to get the member to quit or make changes.

Cornell suggested sitting in mourning in draft
boards, or "hiting" an irish professional mourner to wail
and cry over the deaths of Vets,

No final plan or campaign was decided on in the
direct action section of the Conference. It was strongly
felt that getting to know the board members as well as
possible was a good method tobegin making yourself and your
views known, over and over.

Mike Murphy, of Englewood, New Jersey, summarized
the final results of the Conference as follows:

Art Boyd of AFSC, Cambridge, Massachusetts,
offered the "final Draft Newsletter" to serve as the
communication link for the campaign, toinform people of
activities, The goal of the campaign is to make the draft
as inoperative as possible, and to show the public alternative
systems of society. (Alternative systems means other anes
for draft board and AFEES facilities). | He

The activities suggested are: a “peace bridge" for
the American exiles in Canada; the so-called "Charlottesville
Pledge" was acceptable to many (pledged non-cooperation
with draft by masses of people); Paul Frazer's suggestion of
having people register at draft boards for activities other
than the draft, and alternative buses at AFEES to offer
transportation to a constructive alternative; destruction of
billboards bearing draft advertisements, particularly on
Federal highways, where, it was said, billboards are illegal;
and the previously explained harrassment of "buddies". on
local boards.

SEPTEMBER 17-19, 1971

Paul Fraser told about a plan, mentioned above,
to have 500 Canadian exiles meet at the bridge to return
to the United States, The plan is to cause a backlog
in the legal machinery of the draft and make it open to
the public.

A future follow-up meeting may be held, to
compare what has bsen done and to work toward a joint
action,

During the course of the Conference, Sister
Elizabeth Hillman of Tewksbury, Massachusetts, advised that
she is a friend of Father Philip Berrigan. She said that
the arrest of John Peter Grady in the Camden break-in
was a real blow to the "Movement." She said Grady is the
key person to many of the actions (which ones unspecified),
and he knew who te contact and how to put people in touch
with one another, She stated that she hasinot participated
in any of the actions. She declared. that no one had
expected that they would all get arrested, so no provisions
had been made,

Philip and Daniel Berrigan are currently
serving Federal prison terms for -
convictions stemming from draft file
destruction in Maryland.

Also during the Conference, Mike De Gregory told
a story about the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)
coming to the home of one Mr, Cunningham in Camden, New
Jersey, looking for Grady. After a brief altercation,
Agents left and later returned in force. He said that a
meeting was going, on in the house when Agents first
approached it.

On September 19, 1971, there was a liturgy and
vigil at Danbury Federal Correctional Institution, Danbury,
Connecticut, At about 11:15 am, Fred Lord, Jena Kijek,

left CNVA for Danbury. Mike True was the coordinator
of the liturgy.

About 34 persons were present outside the main
gates of Danbury Prison, most from the Worcester,
Massachusetts "Floating Parish." From about 1:15 pm
until about 1:45 pm, the liturgical service was conducted.
A vigil began thereafter, Nearly everyone but about
five perscus who remained for a continuing vigil then
left the prison at about 2:15 for iunch. From lunch,
they returned home. It appeared that the group at Danbury
was strongly and emotionally pro-Berrigen Brothers, and
they all called for those present to returti October 2,
1971, to the Danbury area for a demonstration, the location
for which is still in litigation, Among those present 7 /
at this liturgy and vigil .were Mariati-Sitindel, of the Cow

dear brothers and sisters,

the local draft board on church street in spring valley is still going
about "business as usual", the reality of this is that many young men from
our community are being processed into a brutal war which the draft continues
to serve. we must take the responsiblity -f letting our draft board kmow that
the community of resistance in rockland county is growing and working on meny~
levels. e

we believe the program described here is a foundation for the building of
that visible commmity of conscience. we have attempted to make the program
sensitive to the different needs of people and flexible enough to find a place
in their various living situations. it is open to new possiblities for action
and education. we trust that you will be exploring these possiblities with us.

please join us, in the belief that we are all responsible’ for what goes on
in ovr community. through action flowing from the spirit of lové and openess,
we trust that we can reach the people who work at the draft board and those
in the county who. oppose our efforts. :

love and peac.

"on October end, “@e marching on Danbury Federal i = ~~ and on prisons
* around the country ~~ to unite ourselves with the Danbury Resisters and other
prisoners.

On August 6th, the Danbury Resisters released a statement and began a fast

* and work stoppage which, in Fr. Daniel Berrigan's words, "called attention to

the duplicity and non-accountabi lity of the Federal Parole Board" and which "dared

/ to Link crimes against domestic prisoners to cximes against Vietnamese prisoners."

. They demanded: i perrseed

1. Major reforms of a parole system that has recently boasted_ a 12.6%

decline in parole grants.

2. An early reivew of the parole application of Fr, Philip Berrigan

. and a parole grant for Fr. Daniel Berrigan, whose poor health has
led Danbury doctors to predict continuing physical deterioration
so long as he remains in prison.

3. An end to the U. S. -funded tiger cages used for political prisoners
: in South Vietnam.

_ Demands issued by a similar group - the Conmittee on Prisons of South

Vietnam — have been added as our own, These include:
. 7 w
1. The end to U. S. funding and staffing of prisons and interrogation
: camps for political suspects in South Vietnam.
2. The release of all those who are sick, disabled, and are being held
eevee : without trial, or whose sentences have now expired.
The October 2nd date coincides with the ‘non~elections of South Vietnam in
- order to make clearer the connection between the political use of prisons in

"both the U. S. and South Vietnam, and most especially, imprisoning of acti-

vists for peace and justice in both countries.

Whot is upsetting our campuses are the real and tertifyingly
large and difficult problems besetting our whole society. One of
these has a special impact on the campus. That is the draft. ane

Nothing now so poisons academic life in America as the draft,
To droft about 400,000 men each year, we keep about 5 million
young men between the ages of 19 and 26 continuously on tenter-
hooks. And don’t think the young women aren't there, too! Our en-
tire younger generation, students, and even more nonstudents, is
kept in a continuous state of insecurity and uncertainty, unable to
plan their fives.

Almost all the students | teach were born since World Wor 11.
Just after World War 11, series of new and abnormal procedures
came into American life, We regarded them at the time as tempo-
rory aberrations. We thought we would get back to normal American
life some day.

But those procedures’ have stoyed with us now for more than’
20 years, and those sfudents of mine have never known anything
else. They think those things are normal. They think we’ve always -
had a Pentagon, that we have always had a big army .and that we
always had a draft. But those are all new things in American life,
and | think that they are incompatible with what America meant
before,

A peacetiine draft is the most unAmerican thing | know, All the
time | was growing up, | was told about oppressive Central Euro-
pean countries cad Russia, where young men were forced into the
army, and | was told what they did about it. They chopped off a
finger, or shot off a couple of toes; or better still, if they could
manage it, they came to this country. And we understood that, and
sympathized, and were glad to welcome them.

qiewenmnymrnrere™ |

—Nv"88262—Bocld:32989692-Rage-181 2 : pasissie : }



Now, ‘by present estimates, 4,000 to 6,000 Americans of draft
age have left this country for Canada, ‘another 2,000 or 3,000 have
gone to Europe and it looks as though mony more are preparing to
emigrate.

There are choices in ae rid of the draft. | think that when
we get rid of the draft, we. must also cut back on the size of the
armed forces. It seems to me that in peacetime a total of one mil-
lion men is surely enough.

1 don’t think we con live with the present: Palas estoblish-
ment and its $80-100 billion a year budget ond and keep America any-
thing like we have known it in the past. Thi is corrupting the life of
the whole country. It is buying up everything in sight: industries,
bonks, investors, universities, and lately it seems also to have
bought up the labor unions.

1 soy that the Vietnam war is just an immediate incident, be-
cause so long as we keep that big an army, it will always find
things to do. If the Vietnam war stopped tomorrow, with that big a
military establishment, the chances are that we would be in o-
nother such adventure abroad ox at home before you knew it.

Dont’ reform the draft - - get rid of it.

Captioned organization continues to maintain a
communal farm at Voluntown, Conn,, staffed by approximately a
half dozen individuals, Their activities are anti-war in
nature and this case is currently in a closed status at New
Haven,

SovRACE continues periodic contact with NECNVA and
their activities have been handled under individual case caption
such as the "War Tax Resistance" (WTR) and the recent bicycle
sojowNthrough New England by WIR participants.

Their activities have been non-violent in nature and
poorly attended receiving little or no publicity in Conn, t
However, New Haven will continue coverage of the farm through ‘J:
informants for intelligence purposes as the farm does offer “~y
anonymity and could be logically used by those individuals in
a fugitive status.

NONVIOLENT ACTION (EECKVA),

According to literature distributed in the
past by the Committee for Non-Violent Action (CKVA),
this group was originally formed in 1957 as the Kational
Committee for Non-Violent Action Against Kuclear Weapons.

A press release issued June 1, 1960, by the
CNVA, 158 Grand Street, New York City, noted that the
CNVA described itself as a non-partisan pacifist organi-
zation which would begin to center its activities in the
few London-Groton, Connecticut area, but activities would
also "spread from New York to Boston in a series of peace
walks, demonstrations, and public meetings."

A leaflet distributed by CNVA in 1960 described
the intent of the organization to protest the defense
policy of the Government and to "enable millions of Americans
to resist by non-violent means---~-any tyranny or foreign
invasion." ‘The leaflet listed certain accertable resistance
techniques as "refusal to serve in the armed forces or work
in military industries; refusal to pay Federal income taxes
wnich go for guns and bombs."

"The Hartford Courant", a daily newspaper published
in Hartford, Connecticut, noted on August 20, 1961, that the
CNVA "maintains two offices in this country, one being in Few
York and the other in New London, Connecticut."

A solicitation letter dated September 29, 1960,
noted that members of NECNVA, an adjunct for CNVA, held the |

3 initial meeting of the NECNVA at New London, Connecticut, on

y September 25, 1960. |

q Literature distributed by NECNVA in 1968, noted, i
"Today the NECNVA conduets a region-wide program in six New

v England States in eastern New York State, and occasionally

N across the border with Canadians in the peace movement."
