MARJORIE. SWANN

Reference is made to FBI memorandum dated

March 16, 1973 at Boston, Massachusetts,

On May 9, 1973 a source who has furnished reliable

information in the past, advised that Marjorie Swann resides

in Ashby; Massachusetts, and she is employed nearby in

the office of Cushing Academy, a private boarding school...

in Ashburnham, Massachusetts.

This sotice went on to say that Marjorie

Swann is one of the leaders in that area of the so called

"Counter Culture," who favor drug usage, have demonstrated

against the war in Vietnam and who are generally opposed

to policies of the U.S. Government. He stated that she'

"talk show" known as "Frankly Speaking,

has, on more than one occasion, been a panich in pon the

by a Fitchburg, Massachusetts, radio station. On these.

radio appearances she has promoted her ideas of organizing

people to go to North Vietnam to help work and rebuild

that country.

The source advised that Swann had held a

meeting in Ashby on February 28, 1973, at the Unitarian

Church, and very few people were in attendance. He further

1.9732

advised that it was his understanding that Swann's promotion

of a trip to Vietnam had practically "fizzled" and that

many of the individuals who had initially supported Swann

and her idea had reneged on actually participating in

such a trip.

The source related that Marjorie Swann is an

intelligent shrewd woman, who by virtue of her prior trip

to North Vietnam and her compatability with the younger

"drug culture," has assumed a leadership position of this

type of people in the Ashby area. The source concluded,

however, that her support was very liminted in the

community.

Swann was born February 15, 1921, Social

Security Number 335-14-9374, and resides on

END THE DRAFT REGIONAL CONFERENCE

SEPTEMBER 17 - 19

... to make the drait inoperable in the Northeast

1 regional conference for people interested in mounting an intensive

nonviolent campaign, based on the assumption that there is no reason

for anyone to be drafted into the U.S. military.

A campaign, not a demonstration or series of demonstrations, not a

mobilization, parade or rally as appropriate as all these are, but

a program of

comparatively long and specific duration aimed at

immobilizing Selective Service throughout our area through all levels

of action, persuasion and education, engaging every possible community

resource.

We look forward. to a decentralized effort witn a common approach.

A major purpose of the conference is to identify specific goals

realizable through nonviolent action, attainable goals along the road

to the eradication of the draft.

We need experiences of real success

to energize the movement and to bring the ultimate goal closer.

Come together to work out strategies and to learn skills in:

_ noncooperation

- nonviolent direct action at draft boards and induction stations

- getting draft board members to resign

- overcooperation

- mounting a broad based educational campaign

- making draft information centers more effective

- draft board research

- mill-ins

- early morning shows

TIME:

From dinnertime (about 6 p.m.) Friday, September 17, to

lunch, Sunday, September 19.

COST:

$12 covers room, board and program. Please register in advance

with a $5 (unreturnable) deposit for each person plannin; to

SEPTEMBER 17-19, 1911

On September 20, 1971, a source who has furnishec

reliable information in the past, furnished the following

information:

On September 17, 1971, approximately forty

people representing various peace groups Inroughout Ner

England met at the Communal Farm of the New Englan

Committee for Non Violent Action in Voluntown, Connecticut,

for the End the Draft Regional Conference.

The New England Committee for Non

Violent Action (NECNVA) is self-described

as a non-partisan pacifist organization

formed to protest the defense policy of

the Government and to "enable millions of

Americans to resist by non-violent means--

any tyranny or foreign invasion."'

It is

headquartered on a 40 acre farm in

Voluntown, Connecticut, where conferences,

weekend seminars, work camps and training

programs in non-violence are held.

The purpose of the meeting during the evening

of September 17, 1971, was to establish workship guide-

Massachus the emerie the vende dea

the weekend. ART BOYD of Cambridge,

American Friends Service Committee, appeared

to be leading the group in discussion.

At 2:00 a.m. the

meeting was still bogged down in total disagreement. The

only tiing that was agreed upon was that they wanted

to end the draft and if necessary hamper the function

of the draft boards and induction centers, but although

a great many ideas were noted, no more than four or

five people could agree on any one point, and then

the agreement of that small group was not in total.

Either they disagreed ideologically or politically

or on the different needs of different areas or on

the role of liberated women or many other similar points.

It also became quite apparent that none of the people

there really wanted to wind up in jail, and they showed

much revolutionary fervor until it

became a matter of

committing themselvss to a cause that might place them-

selves in jeopardy.

The different ideas were placed

on a blackboard and discussed by various members of

the groups, and dealt with the following subjects:

• Draft board "buddy" system (make friends

with members of draft boards and try to

convince them to resign);

Boarding busses containing inductees;

Chaining oneself to busses for inductees;.

Destroying files;

Appearing at draft boards and induction

• centers dressed as death;

Boycotting busses owned by draft board

members;

Swamping draft boards with varied mail

l.e. Swamping draft boards with request.

to review individual files, daily notifications

of health status and/or changes, having

women flooding draft boards with requests

for equal induction status;

high schools concerning draft counseling;

Leafleting, picketing for use of harassing

tactics against draft board members

which would include picketing their homes

At one point, a spokesman who remained unnamed

for a group which he did not identify, made a short

speech concerning the fact that he anü his people felt

that the overall group was doing nothing more than re-

stating things that had already. been tried in other

areas of the country and that this meeting had nothing

new to offer and that they would also become entangled

and crippled by its own diversity, and that he was

pulling out the next noming.

Shortly therearter

young man got up and made an hysterical speech about

voicing open

disagreement and that if it did not stop, he would

plode and jump on somebody.

He continued raving and

became more emotional and less coherent and screamed

again that he would "jump out of his skin and onto

someone if the disagreement continued."

He finally

sat down, muttered to himself, and shook for the remainder

of the meeting. At 2:00 a.m.

the meeting ended without

the group even being able to agree on the hour for

At approximately 9:30 a.m. on September 18,

1971, it was decided to discuss the procedure all over

again.

Approximately one hour later it was decided

that nothing was being accomplished and so the meeting

broke down into groups of 10 individuals, but it appeared

that even at this level nothing could be

accomplished.

The discussion came to an end around 12 noon.

the whole group met to discuss the morning and plans were

made jor an evening game.

The game was a role-playing of

a community. The group assigned different persons to

represent

seven parts of the community which functioned

"as usual": campaigners, students,

blacks, parents, the

Chamber of Commerce, Draft Board and the Clty Government.

The game shored those attending

• the Conference where and

how problems arise, and pointed out the serious lack of

communication within the community.

On september 19, 1971, in the morning, the group

returned to discuss the plans for a campaign.

No direct

action campaign was agreed to or planned, but persons

attending made contacts wich others of similar interests,

and plans for a future action or actions may result at a

later date.

Those who discussed direct action in the smaller

1971, included

Shattuck, Ray Andres, Gary Lynes and Linda Meadoweroft.

The group started by discussing the value of draft board

raids, like the recent Camden,

New Jersey, adtion.

was the

general consensus that that type

of raid at night

was not very successiul in ending the draft. In fact, it

was agreed that the selective Service System has copies of

Illos, and the damage done is to the registrants applying

for deferments.

The group also agreed that such actions

antagonize the public by the way they are done.

Tom Cornell stated that any direct action on a

draft board office should be announced and done openly.

He suggested going in and pouring blood on the files.

Lynes suggested that they aim the action at draft board

members by pouring sugar in their car gas tanks, or in the

bus gas tanks on the days of physicals at AFEES.

Cornell suggested sitting in mourning in drait

No final plan or campaign was decided on in the

direct action section of the Conference. It was strongly

felt that getting to know the board members as well as

possible was a good method tobegin making yourself and your

Views known, over and over.

Mike Murphy, of Englewood, New Jersey, summarized

the final results of

the Conference as follows:

communication link for the campaign, to inform people of

activities.

The goal of the campaign is to make the draft

as inoperative as possible, and to show the public alternative

systems of society. (Alternative systems means other ases

for draft board and AFEES facilities). .

The activities suggested are: a "peace bridge" for

the American exiles in Canada; the so-called "Charlottesville

Pledge" was acceptable to many (pledged non-cooperation

with draft by masses of people); Paul Frazer's suggestion of

having people register at draft

than the draft, and alternative buses at AFIES to offer

transportation

to a constructive alternative; destruction of

billboards bearing draft advertisements, particularly on

Federal highways, where, it was said, billboards are illegal;

and the previously explained harrassment of "buddies". on

local boards.

paul Fraser told about a plan, mentioned above,

to have 500 Canadian exiles meet at the bridge to returi

to the United States.

The plan is to cause a backlog

in the legal machinery of the draft and make it open

A future follow-up meeting may be held, to

compare what has been done and to. work toward a joint

action.

During the course of the Conference, Sister

Elizabeth Hillman of Tewksbury, Massachusetts, advised that

she is a friend of Father Philip Berrigan. She said that

the arrest of John Peter Grady in the Camden break-1n

was a real blow to the "Movement." She said Grady is the

key person to many of the actions (which ones unspecified,

and he knew who to contact and how to put people in touch

with one another.

She stated that she hasinot particinated

in any of

the actions.

expected that they would all get arrested, so no provisions

had been made.

Philip and Daniel Berrigan are currently

serving Federal prison

terms for

convictions stemming from draft file

destruction in Maryland.

Also during the Conference, Mike De Gregory told

a story about the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)

coming to the home of one Mr. Cunningham in Camden,

He said that

dear brothers and sisters,

the local draft board on church street in spring valley is still going

about "business as usual", the reality of this is that many young men from

our community are being processed into a brutal war which the amit continues

to serve. we must take the responsiblity of letting our drait board know that

the community of resistance in rockland county is growing and working on many

levels.

we believe the program described here is a foundation for the building of

that visible community of conscience. we have attempted to make the program

sensitive to the different needs of people and flexible enough to find a place

In their various living situations. it is open to new possiblities for action

and education. we trust that you vill be exploring these possiblities with us.

please join us, in the belief that we are all responsible for what goes

in our community. through action flowing from the spirit of love and openess,

we trust that we can reach the people who work at the drait boara and those

in the county who oppose our efforts.

love and peace

On October 2nd,

e marching on Danbury Federal

aison - and on prisons

around the country - to unite ourselves with the Danbury Resisters and other

prisoners.

On August 6th, the Danbury Resisters released a statement and began a fast

and work stoppage which, in Fr. Daniel Berrigan's words, "called attention to

the duplicity and non-accountability of the Federal Parole Board" and which "dared

to link crimes against domestic prisoners to crimes against Vietnamese priioners."

They demanded:

1. Major reforms of a parole system that has recently boasted a 12.6%

decline in parole grants.

An early reivew of the parole application of Fr. Philip Berrigan

and a parole grant for Is. Daniel Berrigan, whose poor health has

led Danbury doctors to predict continuing physical deterioration

so long as he remains in prison.

.:

3.

An end to the U. S. -funded tiger cages used for political prisoners

in South Vietnam.

Demands issued by a similar group - the Committee on Prisons of South

Vietnam - have been added as our own. These include:

1. The end to U. S. funding and staffing of prisons and interrogation

2.

camos for political suspects in South Vietnam.

The release of all those who are sick, disabled, and are being held

without trial, or whose sentences have now expired.

The October 2nd date coincides with the non-elections of South Vietnam in

order to make clearer the connection between the political use of prisons in

both the U. S. and South Vietnam, and most especially, imprisoning of acti-

vists for peace and justice in both countries.

What is upsetting our campuses are the real and terrifyingly

large and difficult problems besetting our whole society.. One of

these has a special impact on the campus. That is the draft.

Nothing-now so poisons academic life in America as the draft.

To draft about 400,000 men each year, we keep about 5 million

young men between the ages of 19 and 26 continuously on tenter-

hooks. And don't think the young women aren't there,

too! Our en-

tire younger generation, students, and even more nonstudents, is

kept in a continuous state of insecurity and uncertainty, unable to

plan their lives.

Almost all the students I teach were born since World War 11.

Just after World War 11,, a series of new and abnormal procedures

came into American life. He regarded them at the time as tempo-

rary aberrations. He thought we would get back to normal American

life some day.

But those procedures have stayed with us now for more than

20 years, and those students of mine have never known daything

else. They think those things are normal. They think we've always

had a Pentagon, that we have always had a big army .and that we

al ways had a draft. But those are all new things in American life,

and I think that they are incompatible with what America meant

before.

A peacetime draft is the most unAmerican thing I know. All the

time l was

growing up, I was told about oppressive Central Euro-

pean countries and Russia, where young men were forced into the

army, and I was told what they did about it. They chopped off a

finger, or shot off a couple of toes; or better still, if they could

manage it, they came to this country. And we understood that, and

sympathized, and were glad to welcome them.

ine . ..

Now, by present estimates, 4,000 to 6,000 Americans of draft

age have left this country for Canada, another 2,000 or 3,000 have

gone to Europe and it looks as though many more are preparing to

emigrate.

There are choices in getting rid of the draft. I think that when

we get rid of the droft, we. must also cut back.on the size of the

armed forces. It seems to me that in peacetime a total of one mil.

lion men is surely enough.

ment and think o i lin year he resend ali An erite listy-

thing like we have known it in the past. It is corrupting the life of

the whole country. It is buying up everything in sight: industries,

banks, investors, universities, and lately it seems also to have

bought up the labor unions.

I say that the Vietnam war is just an immediate incident, be-

cause so long

as we keep that big an army, it will always find

things to do. If the Vietnam war stopped tomorrow, with that big a

military establishment, the chances are that we would be in a-

nother such adventure abroad or at home before you knew it.

"Mrs. Marjorie Swann, 51, said in a telephone .

"Mrs. Swann said she and another antiwar acelvist

Mrs. Louise Bruyn of Newton, were in Paris July 27 - August

000

"She said she would have no fear of living in

Commnist territory. "I believe our reception would probably

be quite warm for the nost part," she said.

"So far, she said, about 50 women have indicated

they would be interested in the trip. The women range

in age from 18 to 74, she said.

"We would set up a good screening process because

MARJORIE SWANN

Reference is made to T'BI memorandum dated

March 16, 1973 at Boston, Massachusetts,

On May 9, 1973 a source who has furnished reliable.

information in the past, advised that Marjorie Swann resides

in Ashby, Massachusetts, and she is employed nearby in

the office of Cushing Academy, a private boarding school:

in Ashburnham, Massachusetts.

This source went on to say that Marjorie

Swann is one of the leaders in that area of the so called

"Counter Culture," who favor drug usage, have demonstrated

against the war in Vietnam and who are generally opposed

to policies of the U,S. Government. He stated that she*

by a Fitchburg, Massachusetts, cadio station, On these

radio appearances she has promoted her ideas of organizing

people to go to North Vietnam to help work and rebuild

that country•

The soarce advised that Swann had held a

meeting in Ashby on February 28, 1973; at the Unitarian

Church, and very few people were in attendance.

He further

advised that it was his understanding that Swann's promotion

of a trip to Vietnam had practically "fizzled" and that

many of the individuals who had initially supported Swann

and her idea had reneged on actually participating in

such a trip.

The source related that Marjorie Swann is an

intelligent shrewd woman, who by virtue of her prior trip

to worth Vietnam and hes compacability with the younger

END THE DRAFT REGIONAL CONFERENCE

SEPTEMBER 17 - 19

... to make the draft inoperable in the Northeast

A regional conference for people interested in mounting an intensive

nonviolent campaign, based on the assumption that there is no reason

for anyone to be drafted into the U.s. military.

A campaign, not a demonstration or series of demonstrations, not a

mobilization, parade or rally as appropriate as all these are, but

a program of comparatively long and specific duration aimed at

immobilizing Selective Service throughout our area through all levels

of action, persuasion and education, engagine every possible community

resource.

We look forward. to a decentralized effort with a common approach.

A major purpose of the conference is to identify specific goals

realizable through nonviolent action, attainable goals along the road

to the eradication of the draft.

We need experiences of real success

to energize the movement and to

bring the ultimate goal closer.

Come together to work out strategies and to learn skills in:

- noncooperation

- nonviolent direct action at draft boards and induction stations

- getting draft board members to resign

- overcooperation

- mounting a broad based educational campaign

- making draft information centers more effective

- draft board research

- mill-ins

- early morning shows

TIME: From dinnertime (about 6 p.m.) Friday, September 17, to

lunch, Sunday, September 19.

COST:

$12 covers room, board and program. Please register in advince

with a $5 (unreturnable) deposit for each person plannin;; to

only thing that was agreed upc? was that they wanted

to end the draft and if necessary hamper the function

of the draft boards and induction centers, but although

a great many ideas were noted, no more than four or

five people could agree on any one point, and then

the agreement of that small group was not in total.

Either they disagreed ideologically or politically

or on the different needs of different areas or on

the role of liberated women or many other similar points.

It also became quite apparent that none of the people

there really wanted to wind up in jail, and they showed

much revolutionary fervor until it became a matter of

committing themselvss to a cause that might place them-

selves in

jeopardy.

The different ideas were placed

on a blackboard and discussed by various members of

the groups, and dealt with the following subjects:

•Draft board "buddy" system (make friends

with members of draft boards and try to

convince them to resign);

Boarding busses containing inductees;

Chaining oneself to busses for inductees;

Destroying files;

Appearing at draft boards and induction

• centers dressed as death;

Boycotting busses owned by draft board

members;

Swamping draft boards with varied mail,

i.e. swamping draft boards with requests

to review individual files, daily notifications

of health status and/or changes, having

women flooding draft boards with requests

for equal induction status;

So chroning the sat that he and as people felt

that the overall group was doing nothing more than re-

stating things that had already. been tried in other

areas of the country and that this meeting had nothing

new to offer and that they would also become entangled

and crippled by its own diversity, and that he was

pulling out the next morning.

Shortly thereafter a

young man got up and made an hysterical speech about

the group becoming violent in that it was voicing open

disagreement and that if it did not stop, he would ex-

plode and jump on somebody.

He continued raving and

became more emotional and

less coherent and screamed

again that he would "jump out of his skin and onto

someone if the disagreement continued."

He finally

sat down, muttered to himself, and shook for the remainder

of the meeting.

At 2:00 a.m. the meeting ended without

the group even being able to agree on the hour for

breakfast.

At approximately 9:30 a.m. on September 18,

1971, it was decided to discuss the procedure all over

again.

Approximately one hour later it was decided

that nothing was being accomplished and so the meeting

broke down into groups of 10 individuals, but it appeared

that even at this level nothing could be accomplished.

The discussion came to an end around 12 noon.

the whole group met to discuss the morning and plans were

made for an evening game.

The game was a role-playing of

a commurity. The group assigned different persons to

represent

seven parts of the community which functioned

"as usual": campaigners, students,

blacks, parents, the

Chamber of Commerce, Draft Board and the Clty Government.

The

game sowed those attending

the Conference where and

how problems arise, and pointed out the serious. lack of

communication within the community.

On Saptember 19, 1971, in the morning, the group

returned to discuss the plans for a campaign.

No direct

action campaign was agreed to or planned, but persons

attending made contacts with others of similar interests,

and plans

for a future action or actions may result at a

later date.

Those who discussed direct action in the smaller

Shattuck, Ray Andres, Gary Lynes and

Linda Neadowcroft.

The group started by

discussing the value of draft board

raids, like the recent Camden,

New Jersey, adtion.

It

was the general consensus that that type of raid

at night

wasnot very

successiul in ending the draft. In fact, it

was agreed that the selective service System has copies of

tiles, and the damage done is to the registrants applying

for deferments.

The group also agreed that such actions

antagonize the public by the way they are done.

Tom Cornell stated that any direct action on a

draft board office should be announced and done openly.

He suggested going in and pouring blood on the files.

Gary

Lynes suggested that they ain the action at draft board

members by pouring sugar in their car gas tanks, or in the

bus gas tanks on the days of physicals at AFEEs.

SEPTEMBER

17-19, 1971

The group discussed using the time of physicals

to tour the AFEES and milliaround.

Cornell suggested going

to the office to do an action called "Spectre" - walk in

dressed like death and screech and open a bag of animal

intestines, seemingly pouring them from your body.

Another

person suggested the

"buddy" system of selecting a draft

board member to picket, write to, talk with, et cetera,

to get the member to quit or make changes.

Cornell suggested sitting in mourning in draft

boards, or "hiring" an Irish professional mourner to vail

and cry over the deaths of vets.

No final plan or campaign was decided on in the

direct action section of the Conference.

It was strongly

felt that getting to know the board members as well as

possible was a good method to begin making yourself and your

views known, over and over.

Mike

Murphy, of Englewood, New Jersey, summarized

the final results of

che conterence as tollows.

Art Boyd of AFSC, Cambridge, Massachusetts,

offered the "final Draft Newsletter" to serve as the

communication link for the campaign, to inform people of

activities.

The goal of the campaign is to make the draft

as inoperative as possible, and to show the public alternative

systems of society.

(Alternative systems menas other saes

for draft board and AFEES facilities).

The activities suggested are: a "peace bridge" for

the American exiles in Canada; the so-called "Charlottesville

Pledge" was acceptable to many (pledged non-cooperation

with draft by masses of people); paul Frazer's suggestion of

having people register at draft boards for activities other

than the draft, and alternative buses at AFEES to offer

transportation

to a constructive alternative; destruction of

billboards bearing draft advertisements, particularly on

Federal highways, where, it was said, billboards are illegal;

and the previously explained harrassment of "buddies". on

local boards.

paul Fraser told about a plan, mentioned above,

to have 500 Canadian exiles meet at the

bridge to return

to the United states.

The plan is to cause a backlog

in the legal machinery of the draft and make it open

the public.

A future follow-up meeting may be held, to

compare what has been done and to work toward a joint

action.

During the course of the Conterence, Sister

Elizabeth Hillman of lewksbury, Massachusetts, advised that

she is a friend of Father Philip Berrigan.

She said that

the arrest of John Peter Grady in

the Camden break-in

was a real blow to the "Movement." She said Grady is the

key person to many of the actions (which ones unspecified),

and he knew who to contact and how to put people in touch

with one another.

She stated thai she hasnot participated

in any of the actions.

expected that they would all get arrested, so no provisions

had been made.

Philip and Daniel Berrigan are currently

serving Federal prison terms for

convictions stemming from draft file

destruction in Maryland.

Also during the Conference, Mike De Gregory told

a story about the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)

coming to the home of one Mr. Cunningham in Camden, New

Jersey, looking for Grady.

After a brief altercation,

Agents left and later returned in loice.

He said that a

meeting was going. on in the house when Agents first

approached it.

of the liturgy.

About 34 persons were present outside the main

zates of Danbury Prison, most from the Worcester

Massachusetts "Floating Parish." From about 1:15 pm

until about 1:45 pm,

the liturgical service was conducted.

A vigil began thereafter.

Nearly everyone but about

five persons who remained for a continuing vigil then

left the prison at about 2:15 for lunch. From lunch,

they returned home.

It appeared that the group at Danbury

was strongly and emotionally pro-Berrigan Brothers, and

they all called for those present to returi October 2,

dear brothers and sisters,

the local draft board on church street in spring valley is still going

about "business as usual". the reality of this is that many young men from

our community are being processed into a brutal war which the arait continues

to serve. we must take the responsiblity it letting our drait boara now that

the community of resistance in rockland county is growing and working on many •

Levels.

we believe the program described here is a foundation for the building of

that visible community of conscience. we have attempted to make the program

sensitive to the different needs of people and flexible enough to fina a place

in their various living situations. it is open to new possiblities ior action

and education. we trust that you will be exploring these possiblities with us.

please join us, in the belief that we are all responsible for what

goes

in our community. through action flowing irom the spirit of love and openess,

we trust that we can reach the people who work at the draft boara and those

in the county who oppose oux efforts.

love and peace

On October 2nd, we

marching on Danbury Federal

son - and on prisons

around the country. to unite ourselves with the Danbury Resisters and other

prisoners.

On August 6th, the Danbury Resisters released a statement and began a fast

and work stoppage which, in Fr. Daniel Berrigan's words, "called attention to

the duplicity and non-accountability of the Federal Parole Board" and which "dared

to link crimes against domestic prisoners to crimes against Vietnamese prisoners."

They demanded:

1. Major reforms of a parole system that has recently boasted a 12.6%

decline in parole grants.

2. An early reivew of the parole application of ir. Philip Berrigan

and a parole grant for Fr. Daniel Berrigan, whose poor health has

led Danbury doctors to predict continuing physical deterioration

so long as he remains in prison.

3.

An end to thi U. S. -funded tiger cages used for political prisoners

in South Vietnam.

Demands issued by a similar group - the Committee on Prisons of South

Vietnam - have been added as our own. These Include:

1. The end to U. S. funding and staffing of prisons and interrogation

camos for political suspects in South Vietnam.

2. The release of all those who are sick, disabled, and are being held

without trial, or whose sentences have now expired.

The October 2nd date coincides with the non-elections of South Vietnam in

order to make clearer the connection between the political use of prisons in

both the U. S. and South Vietnam, and most especially, imprisoning of acti-

vists for peace and justice in both countries.

What is upsetting our campuses are the real and territyingly

large and difficult problems besetting our whole society. One of

these has a special impact on the campus. That is the draft.

Nothing now so poisons academic life in America as the draft.

To draft about 400,000 men each year, we keep about 5 million

young men between the ages of 19 and 2ú continuously on tenter-

hooks. And don't think the young women aren't there, too! Our en-

fire younger generation, students, and

even more nonstudents, is

kept in a continuou. state of insecurity and uncertainty, unable to

plan their lives.

Almost all the students I teach were born since World War 11.

Just after World War 11, a series of new and abnormal procedures

came into Americon life. He regarded them ai the time as tempo-

rary aberrations. He thought we would get back to normal American

life some day.

Bus those procedures have stayed with us now for more than

20 years, and those students of mine have never known anything

else. They think those things are normal. They think we've always

had a Pentagon, that we have always had a big army and that we

always had a draft. But those are all new things in American life,

and I think that they are incompotible with what America meari

before.

A peacetime draft is the most unAmerican thing I know. All the

time I was growing up, I was told about oppressive Central Euro.

pean countries and Russia, where young men were forced into the

army, and I was told what they did about it. They chopped off a

finger, or shot off a couple of toes; or better still, if they could

manage it, they came to this country. And we understood that, and

sympathized, and were glad to welcome them.

Now, by present estimates, 4,000 to 6,000 Americans of draft

age have left this country for Canada, another 2,000 or 3,000 have

gone to Europe and it looks as though many more are preparing to

emigrate.

There are choices in getting rid of the draft. I think that when

we get rid of the draft, we. must also cut back on the size of the

armed forces. It seems to me that in peacetime a total of one mil-

lion men is surely enough.

I don't think we can live with the present military establish-

ment and its $80-100 billion a year budget and keep America any-

thing like we have known it in the past. It is corrupting the life of

the whole country. It is buying up everything in sight: industries,

banks, investors, universities, and lately it

seems

also to have

bought up the labor unions.

I say that the Vietnam war is just an immediate incident, be-

cause so long as we keep that big an army, it will always find

things to do. If the Vietnam war stopped tomorrow, with that big a

military establishment, the chances are that we would be in a-

nother such adventure abroad ci at home before you knew it.

Dont reform the draft - - get rid of it.
