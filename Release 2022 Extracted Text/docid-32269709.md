"B — from inside outer edge of safe door," and the
inked fingerprints appearing in the two photographs

The remaining latent fingerprint is not
identical with the inked fingerprints appearing in
the five submitted photographs.

The specimens are being retained in the

Latent Fingerprint Section until called for by a
representative of your office.

July 10, 1978

TO: G. Robert Blakey |
Chief Counsel and Director
House Select Committee on Assassinations

FROM: Robert Morrison, Director of Security
William H. Cross, Assistant Director of Security

RE: The tampering with Kennedy Autopsy photos located
in Safe #102095 in the Reading Room of Room 3381
of the Committee Offices.

About 4:05 P.M. Friday June 23, 1978, Mark Flanagan upon
returning some autopsy material to the Security Room along with
Lance Svendsen of the Security Staff upon opening safe #102095
noted that several Kennedy autopsy photos were. loose:on-top. of
the Kennedy Autopsy photo books. The photos removed from the
books were numbered 39E1, 39E2, 40E and 41E. This was two pages
consisting of 4 photos. 39E1 and 39E2 along with the cellophane
cover had been ripped from the book, and the cellophane enclosure
was torn at binder holes. One photo, 39E2 was out of the cellophane
enclosure and lying loose. A quick check by Flanagan and Svendsen
revealed the photos were from Book Five, Part One of the Kennedy
Autopsy photos. An immediate check of all the photo books was
begun to ascertain if any other photos were missing. This check
by Flanagan and Svendsen showed no other photos to be missing
or tampered with. Book Five, Part One had not been signed out
since September of 1977 according to the check out log.

Both Flanagan and Svendsen stated they would have noticed the
photos when the safe was opened at 10 A.M. Friday June 23, 1978

if they had been lying where they were when discovered. They

both feel there was no way this could have been done accidently.
Someone had to enter the safe, and do this. The safe was unlocked,
but shut.

Approximately 5 P.M. Friday, June 23, 1978 at the request
of Committee Investigator John Moriarty, three members of the
Metropolitan Police Identification section responded to Room
3381 for the purpose of attempting to get latent prints. Pvt.

Pat McGinnis, Sgt Blake and Detective Pvt McGinnis was

able to lift 13 separate cards of latent prints from the interior
of the safe, and from the Kennedy Autopsy photo book that was
tampered with. These men left at approximately 8:35 PM Friday !
June 23, 1978. Investigator John Moriarty, William H. Cross

or Chief Counsel G. Robert Blakey were present at all times

during the lifting of the prints. The lifted prints were turned
over to Investigator John Moriarty, and remained in his possession.

The persons who were in this office alone on Friday June
23, 1978 were Edwin Lopez, Dan Hardway and Mitch. Mars of the
Committee Staff, and Regis Blahut of the CIA.

On Monday. June 26, 1978 the 13 cards of prints lifted by
Pvt McGinnis were turned over to Director of Security Robert
Morrison by Investigator John Moriarty and locked in safe #45471
in Room 3381 of Committee Office.

On June 27, 1978, and June 29, 1978 requests were made to
the FBI for certain Committee Staff member fingerprint cards.

NW 68261 Docld:32269709 Page $9


The first request for cards was filled, and received the latter
part of the week of June 25, 1978. The second request was filled
and received on July 5, 1978. Investigator John Moriarty had |
contacted a Pvt Colon Alford of the Metropolitan Police Ident-
ification section, and requested he try to make comparisons of
known and latent prints. During the week of, June 26, 1978 Pvt.
Alford spent one hour in Committee spaces checking staff members
prints against those lifted. On July 5, 1978 at the request of
Pvt Alford, and. with.the consent of Chief Counsel G. Robert
Blakey the 13 cards of lifted prints and all staff member print
cards from the FBI were turned over to Pvt Alford which he
receipted for, so he could take them away from Committee spaces
to enable him to spend more time studying them. During the week
of July 2, 1978. Pvt Alford was able to obtain the fingerprints
of Regis Blahut, an employee of the CentralIntelligence Agency. |
On Friday July 7, 1978 at approximately 2:30 P.M. Pvt Alford
phoned William H. Cross of Security Staff and stated he had made
a tentative identification of Blahuts prints on the inside of
the safe door, and on one of the photos in Book Five, Part One
of the Kennedy Autopsy photos. On Monday July 10, 1978 at 2;30 P.M.
\ Pvt Alford responded to the Committee offices and in the presence
of Chief Counsel G. Robert Blakey, Robert Morrison, and William
H. Cross returned all fingerprint cards, and the 13 cards of
lifted prints. These were returned to safe #45471 in Room 3381.
Pvt Alford stated he had identified a certain number of points
in several prints, and in his opinion they were those of Regis |
Blahut. These prints were matched with those on the inside of
the safe door, and on the back of photo 39E2 which had been
ripped from Book Five, Part One of the Kennedy Autopsy photos,
and the photo which had. been removed from the cellophane cover. {
After returning all materials Pvt Alford departed Committee Spaces
at 2;55 P.M. Monday July 10, 1978.

On_two occasions on this date Gary Cornwell and I spoke
with Regis Blahut of the CIA. We first spoke to him at
approximately 11AM in Gary Cornwell's office. We spoke
with him a second time at approximately 2PM at which
time we recorded his statement pertaining to a breach
of security at the HSCA. The recorded statement fully
covers the substance of the first conversation with

two exceptions:
1) In the first conversation Regis originally told us that
he looked through an autopsy photo book after receiving
permission to do so. Later, during that same conversation,
when asked From whom he received permission to 160k

through the autopsy photo book he denied having said he |
received permission to look through the book and stated |
that he at no time received permission to look through |
the autopsy photo book. Both Gary and I distinctly recall
him telling us at the outset of the conversation that he

looked through tne book only attér reécevind permission to

do so.

The first request for cards was filled, and received the latter
part of the week of June 25, 1978. The second request was filled
and received on July 5, 1978. Investigator John Moriarty had
contacted a Pvt Colon Alford of the Metropolitan Police Ident-
ification section, and requested he try to make comparisons of
known and latent prints. During the week of June 26, 1978 Pvt.
Alford spent one hour in Committee spaces checking staff members
prints against those lifted. On July 5, 1978 at the request of
Pvt Alford, and with the consent of Chief Counsel G. Robert
Blakey the 13 cards of lifted prints and all staff member print
cards from the FBI were turned over to Pvt Alford which he
receipted for, so he could take them away from Committee’ spaces
to enable him to spend more time studying them. During the week
of July.2, 1978. Pvt Alford was able to obtain the fingerprints
of Regis Blahut, an employee of the CentralIntelligence Agency.
On Friday July 7, 1978 at approximately 2:30 P.M. Pvt Alford
phoned’ William-H. Cross of Security Staff and stated he had made

in several prints, and in his opinion they were those of Regis :
Blahut. These prints’ were matched with those on the inside of

security violation which had been discovered by the Committee.

Blakey. began by describing to Turner the nature of the Kennedy

autopsy pictures, the restrictions under which the Committee

has acquired and possessed them, the security precautions

(separate safe, limited access, and log record) utilized to

safeguard: them, and_the possible motives that might exist for

someone unlawfully removing them from the Committee.

. Blakey next described the circumstances and details of ~

the Committee's discovery, made on 6/23/78, that the autopsy

photos had been tampered with, and the investigation which
the staff thereafter conducted, including the identification
of all of those persons who had access. to the security space
where they were located, the fingerprinting process and
results, and ultimately the questioning of Regis Blahut,
the CIA employee who was in the security space on that date.

Finally, Blakey recalled to Turner his (Turner's)
statement made to Blakey and Cornwell on February 4, 1978,
to the effect that if the Committee found any impropriety
or wrongdoing on the part of any CIA employee, he would
personally look into and get to the bottom of it. Blakey
stated that the Chairman had been told of Turner's comment
on February 4, 1978, and now requested that Turner conduct
a further investigation of the Blahut matter. Blakey stated
that the Committee felt such an investigation was necessary
for the following reasons:

1. The Committee had spoken to Blahut on three

occasions (July 11, 13 and 14) about his knowledge

of the tampering with the autopsy photos, on two

of which, by Blahut's own subsequent admissions,

he had lied about significant details, and on

the last of which, by independent evidence, Blahut

had also lied;

2. Blahut's actions were deliberate, as evidenced

NW 68261 Docld:32269709 Page 108


Admiral Stansfield Turner OCR Page three

by the fact that Blahut had opened the Committee's

safe in which the photos were stored, and on the

first two interviews with the Committee, he lied

about having done so;

3. There is only one possible innocent motive for

Blahut's handling and viewing of the autopsy photos,

that being personal curiosity, and the evidence

unequivocally shows that personal curiosity was not

the motive (a page was ripped out, a photo was re-

moved from the plastic sheeting, the log shows that

the photo book in question had not been removed from

the safe by the Committee staff since September, 1977,

and Blahut's story about his handling of, and access

to that photo book on June 23, 1978 is patently un-

believable); and most significantly,

4. Prior to at least two of the three occasions

on which Blahut was interviewed by the Committee

staff, he spoke to his superiors at the Agency, and

after each of those conversations he told lies to

the Committee about his involvement.

Turner said that he had already looked into the matter,
and handed us a report which had been written. Turner sug-
gested that Blakey and Cornwell go read the report (not take

a copy with them from the building), and also look at Blahut's

NW 68261 Docld:32269709 Page 109


Admiral Stansfield Turner. OCR Page four

personnel file, and then let the Agency know what else he
(Blakey) suggested they should do.

Upon inspection, the report reflected the following:

(a.) The Agency interviewed Blahut on Friday evening,

July 14, and polygraphed him three times for roughly

two hours each time on Saturday, July 15;

(b.) Blahut's supervisors had been spoken to, and

denied any involvement;

(c.) Blahut admitted lying to the Committee;

(d.) Blahut basically told the same story to the

polygraph expert (Felippo) he had finally told the

Committee on the morning of July 14, except that

on July 15 he admitted that he was never given

permission by any Committee staff member to view

the Kennedy autopsy pictures;

(e.) Blahut persisted in his story (but lied in

doing so, according to the polygraph) that he had

opened the Committee safe only once, and that was

to put a photo book into the safe, and also (again,

untruthfully) stated that he had only viewed the

autopsy books on two occasions.

(£.) Blahut has been assigned to a CIA operation

code named MHCHILD since April, 1977.)

Office of Security Chief Gambino, and Carlucci's as-
sistant, Hav Smith, met with Blakey and Cornwell after they

Admiral. Stansfield Turner OCR Page five

had reviewed the investigative report provided by Turner.
Blakey requested that he be permitted to see Blahut's security
file. Gambino refused, but offered the personnel file instead.

The personnel file reflected that Blahut had consistently .

Che was Yous baight + nalooe,
received excellent ratings, from his superiors, | that he showed
leadership qualities in‘his work, and that he had been com-
mended for consistently reporting to his superiors what he
had observed and done during his assignments, and alerting
them to any problems he encountered -*

Finally, Smith and Gambino asked Blakey what he felt the
Agency should do now. Blakey said that full interviews of all
of Blahut's supervisors should be conducted, and written
reports made. In addition, Blakey stated that new polygraphs
should be taken, focusing primarily on the area that was es-—
-sentially omitted on July 15, namely, the question of motive.

Hav Smith asked whether the Committee was going to accept
the Agency's investigation after it was completed; he said
he wanted to know now, that he wanted'a commitment. Smith
said that he was 99 percent sure that the final report would
show no involvement in the tampering on the part of the Agency.
Gambino said, "We know we're clean." In reply, I asked how
the Agency could be so sure at this early point that none of
their employees except Blahut were involved, and I also com-
mented that Smith was asking the Committee to "buy a pig in
a poke" in suggesting that we should tell him now whether or
not we would be satisfied with the Agency's investigation

before it was even conducted. Both Blakey and I
stated that what we could now state was that we had come
to the Agency with the suggestion that they investigate it,
because we felt that from among the alternatives now available
to the Committee, that alternative was the one with the
best chance of success. Finally Blakey also noted that
his hope was that after the Agency's investigation was
complete, copies of the reports could be placed in the
Agency's and the Committee's files, and that would be the
end of it.

The meeting was terminated with the general understanding
that Blakey's suggestions would be followed, and the Agency

would let us: know when they had their reports complete.

Re; The tampering with Kennedy Autopsy photos located
in Safe # 102095 in the Reading Room of Room 3381
of the Committeroffices.

About 4:05 P.M. June 23, 1978 Mark Flanagan upon returning
some autopsy material to the Security room along with Lance Svendson
of Security staff upon opening safe #102095 noted that several autopsy
photos were lying loosely on top of the other books. The photos
removed were 39El, 39E2, 40 E and 41 E. This'was two pages consisting
of 4 photos. Photos 39 El and 39E2 had been ripped from the book.

One photo 39E2 was out of the cellophane enclosure and laying loose.
A quick check showed that these photos were from Book Five, Part One.
An immediate check of all books was begun by Flanagan and Svendsen
to ascertain if any other photos might be missing. No other photos
were found to be missing or tampered with. Book Five,Part One had
not been signed out recently according to the check out log.

Both Mark Flanagan and Lance Svendsen stated they would have noticed
the photos when the safe was open at 10 AM June 23, 1978 if they

had been lying were they were. They both feel there is no way this
could have been done accidently. Someone had to enter safe and do
this. The safe was unlocked but shut.

Aprroximately 5 P.M. June 23, 1978 at the request of Committee
Investigator Jack Moriarty three members of the Metropolitan Police
Identification section responded to Room 3381 for the purpose of
attempting to get latent prints. Pvt Pat McGinniss, Sgt Blake and
Det. Pvt. McGinniss was able to lift 13 separate cards of
latent prints from the interior of the safe, and from the KennedyAdirey
photos book that was tampered with. These men left at approximately
8:35 PM June 23, 1978. Investigator Moriarty, William H. Cross or
G. Robert Blakey were present at all times during the lifting of the
prints. The lifted prints were turned over toInvestigator Moriarty,
and remained in his possession.

The persons who were in this office on June 23, 1978 other than
Security personnel wereEdwin Lopez, Dan Hardway, Mitch wars, tard So
Regis Blahut of the CIA.

On June 27, and June 29, 1978 requests were made to the FBI for
certain staff members print cards. The first were recieved the week
of June 26, 1978, and the second packet on July 5, 1978. Investigator
Moriarty had contacted a Pvt. Colon Alford of the Metropolitan Police
Department ID section and requested he try to make comparisons of
known and latent prints. During the week of June 26, 1978 Pvt Alford
spent one hour in Committee officeachecking staff members prints

against those lifted. on July 3, 1978 the latent prints and all

staff members print cards from the FBI were turned over to Pvt.
Alford which he yempeet EOF «fo he could take them away from

the week of July 2, 1978 Pvt. Alford was able to obtain the
fingerprint card of Regis Blahut(a Former D.C. Fireman) On Friday
July 7, 1978 at approximately 2:30 P.M. Pvt Alford contacted William
Cross of Security staff and stated he had made a tentative identifi-
cation of Blahuts prints on the safe door and one of the photos in
Book Five,;Part One of the Kennedy Autposy photos. On Monday July

10, 1978 at 2:30 PM Pvt Alford responded to the Committee offices
and in the presence of G. Robert Blakey, Robert Morrison and
William H. Cross returned all fingerprint cards, The 13 cards

of lifted prints, and stated he had identified a certain number of
points in several prints, and in his opinion they were those of
Regis Blahut. These prints were on the inside of the safe door and

RE: The tampering with Kennedy Autopsy photos located
.in Safe #102095 in the Reading Room of Room 3381
of the Committee. Offices.

About as 05 P.M. Friday June 23, °1978, Mark Flanagan upon
-returning some autopsy material to the Security Room along with
Lance Svendsen of the Security Staff upon opening safe #102095
2, noted that several Kennedy. autopsy photos were’ loose7on top :of
~ the) Kennedy Autopsy photo books. The photos removed fromthe
books. were numbered: 39E1, 39E2, 40E and 41E. This was two pages
consisting of 4 photos. 39El and 39E2 along with the cellophane
cover had been ripped from the book, and the cellophane enclosure
was torn at binder holes. One photo, 39E2 was out of the cellophan
enclosure .and lying loose. A quick check by Flanagan and Svendsen
- revealed the photos were from Book Five, Part One of the Kennedy
Autopsy photos. An immediate check of all the photo books was
begun to ascertain if any other photos were missing. This check
