Special Agent ELMER C, MULLEN was the Agent who
conducted spot checks of the subject's residence and place
UW of employment on numerous occasions during the period
covered by instant report,

Miami attorney who occupies Apartment 2 at above address and
is also engaged as subject's attorney, It is noted that RICHARD
BERGSTRESSER is the subject of Miami file 97-390, a Registration
Act case, BERGSTRESSER is a partner in the firm Taylor and
Bergstresser located at Suite 803, Biscayne Building, Miami,
Florida, It is also noted that BERGSTRESSER and TAYLOR have
in the past represented Cubans in litigations in the Miami
area and ‘have also represented the Cuban government.

Referenced Bureau letter dated June 7, 1961,
indicates that the Central Office of Immigration and
Naturalization Service (INS) had advised that a Miami attorney
named BENTON, who had recently returned from a business trip

to Canada, had reported that the subject was in close contact +

with "CHE" GUEVARA. BENTON was to be located, identified, _ en
and interviewed for details regarding subject's connection “yo
with "CHE" GUEVARA. ie ea tena

Investigation by the Miami office has indicated
that SAM BENTON is a business partner with the Subject in
the G & B Sales, Inc.,; and is shown as the President of this
corporation, with the subject as Treasurer, Inasmuch as
BENTON and TEJADA are officers of the same business firm
BENTON has not yet been interviewed, pending development’
of additional background information concerning him, as a
direct interview with the subject will probably be more
desirable and productive if the subject is to be interviewed,
