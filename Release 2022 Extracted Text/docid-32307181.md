for information regarding the subject.

- ADMINISTRATIVE -

Special Agent ELMER C. MULLEN was the Agent who

conducted

spot checks of the subject's residence and place

of employment on numerous occasions during the period

covered by instant report.

It is noted the subject was recommended for

occupancy of the apartment at 7926 East Drive, Apartment

4, Harbor Island, Miami Beach, Florida, by RICHARD BERGSTRESSER,

Miami attorney who occupies Apartment 2 at above address and

is also engaged as subject's attorney.

It is noted that RICHARD

BERGSTRESSER is the subject of Miami

file 97-390, a Registration

Act case. BERGSTRESSER is a partner in the firm

Taylor and

Bergstresser located at Suite 803, Biscayne Building, Miami,

Florida.

It is also noted that BERGSTRESSER and TAYLOR have

in the past represented Cubans in litigations in the Miami

area and 'have also represented the Cuban government.

Referenced Bureau letter dated June 7, 1961,

indicates that the Central Office of Immigration and

Naturalization Service (INS) had advised that a Miami attorney

named BENTON, who had recently returned from a business trip

to Canada, had reported that the subject was in close contact

with "CHE"' GUEVARA. BENTON was to be located, identified,

and interviewed for details regarding subject's connection

with "CHE'' GUEVARA.

Investigation by the Miami Office has indicated

that SAM BENTON iS a business partner with the subject in

the G & B Sales, Inc.; and is shown as the president of this

corporation, with the subject as Treasurer®

Inasmuch as

BENTON and TEJADA are officers of the same business firm,

BeNToN has not yet been interviewed, pending development

of additional background information

concerning him, as a

direct interview with the subject will probably be more

desirable and productive if the subject is to be interviewed.

Indices of the Miami Office are negative regarding

subject and YALE GOLDBERG.

Indices reflect one reference to

SAM

BENT

ON, which intormation was furnished by PSI HEROINA

G.

MELO

Special Agent MAURICE F. FARABEE

on October 31,

1960.

It was reflected that pSI was approached on October

31, 1960, by an individual who identified himself as SAM

BENTON, who had previously been observed by PSI in the

office of JUAN ORTA in September, 1960, in Cuba. PSI

advised that BENTON contacted PRIMITIVO CONDIS, a former

Cuban Consulate employee in Miami, on October 28, 1960,

regarding the extension or renewal of a passport for a

Cuban friend. PSI described BENTON as follows: 0)

PSI has not observed BENTON since October 31,

Miami has been unable to locate BENTON as of

August 24, 1961.

It is noted that the enclosure to Legat, Ottawa,

letter to Bureau indicates a newspaper clipping from the

"Gazette" of Montreal, Canada, dated June 17, 1961,

captioned, "No Bail on Cuban

Charge," states

that ROBERT

B. SLAVEN, a 45 year old Toronto, Canada, exporter, was

held without bail on a $158,000.00 fraud conspiracy charge

preferred by a Cuban import

firm which also accuses one of

its employees of being a co-conspirator. The co-conspirator

was identified as "JUAN TEJUDA,"

age 30, formerly of Havana

and now of "parts unknown." There was no indication in the

newspaper article as to whether TEJADA, described as a co-

conspirator, was wanted.
