TESTIMONY OF ROBERT T. SHAW

Mr. Goldsmith. Would you state your name and address
for the record?

Mr. Shaw. Robert T. Shaw, 3715 Acosta Road, Fairfax,
Virginia, 22031.

Mr. Goldsmith. What is your present occupation, Mr.

1 Shaw?
Mr. Shaw. I am undercover with the Department of State,

but my actual-occupation is Inspector, Officé of the Inspector °

General, Central Intelligence Agency.

Mr. Goldsmith. Mr. Shaw, I handed you earlier a copy
of a letter from the Acting Director of the Central Intelli-
gence, Mr. Carlucci, to the Chairman of this Committee. It

corresponds to JFK Exhibit No. 94 in the Committee's hearing

| record.

Have you had a chance to read that letter?

Mr. Shaw. I read.it justtnow.

Mr. Goldsmith. Do.you: understand it?

Mr. Shaw. I understand it.

Mr. Goldsmith. I also would like to hand you the

Committee's rules and resolutions and ask you at this time

i to read Rule No. 4 to yourself.

(Pause)
Mr. Shaw. I read it over.

Mr. Goldsmith. Do you understand that?

Mr. Shaw. I understand it.

Mr. Goldsmith. Do you understand that you have a right
to counsel?

Mr. Shaw. Yes.

Mr. Goldsmith. Do you waive that right to counsel?

Mr. Shaw. I do not need counsel.

Mr. Goldsmith. Do yourunderstand that, under the
Committee rules, that you have a right to receive a copy of
the statement you are going to give us at this deposition?

Mr. Shaw. I should hope so, to check it for accuracy.

Mr. Goldsmith. However, by virtue of the arrangement

that the Committee has worked out with the Central Intelligence

Agency, we have been asked to request of Agency employees that

they waive their right to receive a copy of the deposition

for their own retention. By that, I mean we would certainly

be willing to grant you access to the deposition, to correct

it in any way necessary, but the Agency has requested that
we ask you to waive your right to receive an actualy copy of
the deposition.

Mr. Shaw. I have no problem with that.

Mr. Goldsmith. Thank you.

For the record, I would like to say that the Committee's

mandate is to investigate the assassination of the President.

The scope of the mandate includes who killed the President,

| was there a conspiracy? We are also required to evaluate

training. That would be March, 1948.

Mr. Goldsmith. Would your State Department file, if
reviewed by a member of this Committee, indicate that you were
actually a CIA employee?

Mr. Shaw. I have no idea.

Mr. Goldsmith. You do not understand how the cover
arrangement would work between the Agency and the Department
of State?

Mr. Shaw.. I have never had anything to do with the
setting up of such cover, It would well be that there might
be some sort of an indicator or flag, or something in that
file that would indicate to a person who knew the ropes that
I was not bona fide.

Mr. Goldsmith. Would there be a personnel file on you
at the Central Intelligence Agency?

Mr. Shaw. Yes.

Mr. Goldsmith. As a matter of procédure, in terms of

how you get. paid, do you get paid by the Department of State?

Mr.:Shaw. No. Iam under, at the present time, nominal!

state cover. I actually, as. far as the Department of State
is concerned, resigned over there in 1973, I believe. At
the present time, I am paid by the Agency.

Mr.@Goldsmith. When you were working under cover, were
you being paid by State at that time?

Mr. Shaw. To a certain extent.
For example, I have never issued a visa. I have issued
a passport for another consular officer who accepted the i

application and I would be on the road in horthwestern Mexico

and issued the passport to the American citizen concerned.

Mr.. Goldsmith. Did any CIA person ever interview you
concerning Lee Harvey Oswald's activities in Mexico City and
the operations of the Mexico City station?

Mr. Shaw. I would have to qualify that. We discussed

the subject, of course, in Mexico City at the time of the

assassination, or immediately after the assassination. i

Mr. Goldsmith. Would you give us your assessment of

Mr. Shaw. Competence. It is difficult, because I was

' ability to remember numbers and he carried in his head the :
| file numbers of what we called P-files in Mexico City. P
stood, I think; for personality. A P number usually was four
digits or so, maybe five digits.

And he carried all these numbers in his head and he could
mark something for such and such a file in black ink -- he
always wrote in black ink -- putting the number down. He had
a very good memory for numbers.

Winn and I were friendly. We were not close. We were
not on the same level at all.

I considered him to be, from my standpoint, a competent, |

effective, Chief of Station.
Mr. Goldsmith. What type of file-keeping system did i
he have in effect, without asking you to describe it in detail?
By that, my question is directed towards his thoroughness and
comprehensiveness.
Mr. Shaw. I would say that he probably had one of the
most -~ let me see -- complete file systems in being in the
Agency. I think that he, my personal opinion is that he went
overboard, and we had so much stuff back in our files, it
was hard to believe the amount of paper we had in there.
His tendency was not to rely on cross-indexing. If

you have a document, this piece of paper means something to

you and you want to keep it and it has 15 names on it, he :
was quite capablé of setting up 15 files for the same piece
of paper. And we had a tremendous file room.

I often wondered if we needed that much paper. It was
very thorough. I am not a technician as far as managing
files, but I do know that the people who worked in the file

room were kept very, very busy.

Mr. Goldsmith. Who were Mr. Scott's chief deputies? }

Let me’rephrase the question. Upon which individuals did he

tend to rely the most?
Mr. Shaw. He had one Deputy who:was Allen White. As
far as reliance on other people, I would say he relied very

heavily on Annie Goodpasture -- not in any way in a command

| FBI agent named George Monroe.
Mr. Goldsmith. What about David Phillips?
Mr. Shaw. Yes. Dave Phillips ran the what we called the

|| CA side of the shop, covert action, mostly propaganda. I came

{up the Cuban shop. Very soon after I arrived there, Dave

| Phillips was tapped -- it was while we were still in the old
|| Embassy building.

He was tapped and named the new Cuban Office Chief.

Mr. Goldsmith. Did that happen in October '63?

Mr. Shaw. I don't know. I do not remember. But it was
|not too long after I was there, and I was asked, I think by

| pave; I don't remember -- if I had any objections to continuing
' to serve in Cuba.

I liked Dave, I respected him. I did not feel that I
jwas being hurt, hurt careerwise, to step back and I was very

interested in Cuban operations, so I did willingly, let us say,

relinquish command, if you want to, of Cuban Ops and I served
Dave as one more officer.

Later on, after Dave left, a year or two later, I once
again took over the Cuban Ops group.

Mr. Goldsmith. You were in charge of Cuban Operations at

(the beginning. Then Phillips took it over at some point and

to Mexico City with the understanding that I was going to head

Mr. Goldsmith. In 1963, did you manage to place any
penetration agents in the Cuban Embassy or consulate?

Mr. Shaw. Did I?

Mr. Goldsmith. Did the station?

Mrs Shaw. There were two. I did not place either one,

jand I think they both pre-dated 1963.

Mr. Goldsmith. Were those two penetration agents within

the Cuban consulate or Embassy at the time of the President's

assassination?

Mr. Shaw. Yes. One was in the consulate -- LITAMIL-7
was the cryptonym. L-I-T-A-M-I-L-7. And the other one was
in the Embassy -- L&I-T-A-M-I-L-9.

Mr. Goldsmith. What information did these people give

did handle, ~

Mr. Goldsmith. Who handled LITAMIL-7?
Mr. Shaw. I think that it was Ray Swider, but I am not

sure. I did not meet LITAMIL-7 until Ray Swider left the

of consequence that LITAMIL-7 produced, just like it would

have. been normal for any other case officer in the Cuban sec~

Mr. Goldsmith. In light of that, do you know what infor-
{

Mr. Shaw. I do not recall, and I do not recall the i

I do have the recollection of the sense of feeling on the
Leo ee of those people that there was no exultation or jubila-
| tion or happiness whatsoever inside the Cuban Embassy at the i
} assassination of President Kennedy.

Mr. Goldsmith. Did the penetration agents ever indicate i

Mx. Goldsmith. What were your primary responsibilities

Mr. Shaw. Go ahead.

: Mr. Goldsmith. You were not involved in the photo~

'tap operation, so,’ MY question is, what was your primary

responsibility?

Mr. Shaw. My primary responsibility was to try to

bit of time with Cubans of the non-Castro persuasion, attempt-
ing to identify Cubans of the Castro persuasion that we might
Igo after.

By "go after," I mean attempt to recruit.

I spent a lot of time collecting information from the

| reports on what was happening in Cuba.

| We had a system set. up in Mexico City under an agent

‘called AMSAIE who was the representative of the:exile commun-

“Mry Goldsmith. Who had reporting responsibility for

24

passing along the information that had been obtained from the

| photographs and the transcripts?

Mr. Shaw. ‘There was little reporting that came out of :

| the photographs. Usually, it yielded what we called operational’

information rather than intelligence information, to enable us

1
|
| |
to develop a better understanding of who was in the area, of
|
|
who was in the Cuban Embassy, and what they were up to. !

As far as reporting intelligence that came from those,

i

it probably was reported by the reports section of the Embassy.

next to that.-- I'm getting in the new embassy now. I don i

We had reports officers who actually repaired most of the!

yielded very! little reportable intelligence. It was mostly

|

operational intelligence. i

Mr. Goldsmith. Why do you make that distinction between

the Cuban had not acdepted that pitch and had reportéd it

Mr. Goldsmith. Of course, the Mexican government was

also taking a risk by being involved in the liaison operation

sor the Agency as well.

Mr. Shaw. One could assume that they had measured their

risk, yes, certainly. There is an element of risk in every

| operation. Do not get me wrong. I do not know whether they

had anything going or not. I would assume, just based on my

experience, that they would not have tried to pitch Cubans,

be able to-contact through an intermediary the photo bases

to warn them or indicate to them that someone is coming of

interest?

Mr. Shaw. It is my understanding that such a system did
not exist, and I do not believe that the guys monitoring the

| telephone tap intercept bases were made aware of photograph

' coverage.

However, I. would assume that a man running a technical
| operation, if he heard something exciting on the line, as

with Oswald.

Mr. Goldsmith. When was the first time that this trans-

that happened a day or two earlier, possibly Saturday, and
I wondered if Herb Minnell, when they were discussing this,

from the ‘Soviet Union, would it have been standard operating
procedure for the Agency to have interviewed him or debriefed
him in some way?

Mr. Shaw. No. I think that it would have been more
likely for the FBI to interview him.

Mr. Goldsmith. Why is that?

Mr. Shaw. Because he was an American citizen in the
United States. That was the FBI's territory.

Mr.<Goldsmith. Even though Oswald worked for several
years -- not for several years, but for sometime -- in a
radio factory while he was in Russia?

Mr. Shaw. I was not aware that he worked in a radio
factory, but the fact that he had been in the Soviet Union,

the fact that he had been in the United States Marine Corps,

would have been interviewed by the FBI.
Mr. Goldsmith. Does not the Agency have a Domestic
Contacts Division, or service, which customarily interviews

people who have been abroad in Communist countries?

Mr. Shaw. The Agency has the Domestic Contacts Division.!

somebody in the crowd yelled Spanish for Bob, and I went over
