a dentist| “Vedado. | Subject arrived
in Miami on PAA FIight 422 on°S May 1962, ~

2. Subjects'a and b are sisters and were questioned together... On|

the best reception was the. "Voz dé Tas Americas” which came ‘in strong.
and clear with rarely any interference jamming.. Program content was .
described as. generally good, gave a morale boost to the audience and ©
was” becoming popular. : :

i: 3. In commenting on Radio Las Americas, they: pointed out that
i; they. had not heard it or attempted to tune In ‘because they felf. the:
H quality was much the same as its predecessor, “Radio Swan" which lost
ji! its prestige prior to and /during the April 1961 invasion attempt. Both
: declared this was a general opinion among their acquaintances,

4, Subjects commented very favorably on programs heard over
station XEW, Mexico and WRUL, New York, describing reception and ‘con=
tent as good and with large audiences in. Cuba.

§. In referring to other programs, subjects reported that on
1 May, relatives in‘the Matanzas arca. telephoned ‘them: in Havana to tell)
them that the “students" (DRE) were.on again (TV intrusion). Also,
ater in the day, friends in the Vedado. area calicd to tell them to
tune into Channel, 2, that there was a program there(about. 2115. hours
local). Unfortunately, they had already ‘sold their’ TV.set since: they
were leaving s00n,. Both agreed that. the system of announcing the TV
intrusion broadcasts over CONTE Aguero's program.on WRUL a few minutes
prior to the intrusion was tle key. to large audiencés, - Almost all
GOC oppositionists upon hearing this announcement, Start télephoning.
their friends to tune into ‘the TV channel announced.

6. Concerning the DRE internal ‘organization, subjects reported”
that they had not been active recently and not witting to clandestine _
operations. ‘They. were aware, however, that. the DRE -internal net was~,
waiting for the infiltration of AMHINT-S3 or AMHINT-2.to brief them on
the Situation in exile and what support would be forthcoming. They
reiterated the reports on two bombs set off.in the university area by
the DRE and burning of cane and -hencquen fields in Matanzas and Lis
villas. :

7, When queried on disturbances in Las Villas and/or Matanzas on
or about 3 May, they replied thut they heard the persistent rumor that
a unit (company or regiment unknown) of militia had bolted and gone
up into the Escambray Mountains, -No further details: were known,

i 8. When’ questioned on written propaganda such as flysheets or
clandestine newsheets, both declared that the last: propaganda scen was
the:clandestine issue on “Trinchera” (DRE organ), that no other pro-

\\paganda sheets ‘had been. seen Since before the April invasion.

9. When asked their impression on anti-CASTRO propaganda in’
general they felt that it was too negative: that while the exiles and
opposition groups were busy. tearing down the imayze of CASTRO, he was
before the people with some proposal that was based either on truth,
had a, ring of truth in it, or al least appealed to the masses. , That
some of thet contacts with young girls who served as -“brigadistas”
(rural .tutors in the campaign for literacy) turned up interesting
remarks. These girls claimed that many of the country fo1k, would throw
vs their hands in dismay when Communism was mentioned to them, and

sothine to da with communism, and yet

the topic of receptton of. radio” programs in’Cuba, both, were agreed’ that}.

10, Subjects also felt that propaganda should be directed more
toward that sector of Cubans “that are not fanatic Fidelistas or
communists, and have not commited. themselves ‘to the opposition ovement
for,such reasons as indolence, lack of courage, or economic docibility:
Raquel remarked that our propaganda scemed to be divided “into two
broad categories, one directed at or attacking the hard-core Fidelistas
and the-other for opposition movement consumption.

11. Subject ¢ above. was debriefed for her report on reception of
A FALCON broadcast in Havana on 1 May 1962. She stated that she was
called by a friend at about 2100 hours.on 1 May and told that: the DRE
Trinchera.-program was being broadcast over Channel 2 at that moment.
Miriam turned on her. TV-and does not recall how high she had to turn. up|
the. volume, but to li@r-reeollection, not higher than normal. She. heard
very clearly, thé monologue rebuttal of the CASTRO speech carlier that
afternoon, She immediately called two of her friends and subsequently:
received calls from them and others ‘on reception of. the program, Her |
