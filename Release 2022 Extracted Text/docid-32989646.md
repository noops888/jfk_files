communities, He further alleged that Ratliff is the driving
force behind a program of racial agitation in Dallas County
and that his statements to staff members are antiwhite and
antipolice, He said it is his belief that Ratliff is trying
to create a crisis in Dallas in order to receive additional
antipoverty funds. .

The source of the above information also alleged
that in April of this year Ratliff was vigorously critical of
the Dallas Police Department regarding the arrest of a 15-year-
old Negro female on a charge of disturbing the peace and was in
the process of organizing a march on city hall to protest the
arrest when officials of the Office of Economic Opportunity
learned of his activity and told him to desist, He stated that
in another instance several months ago, Albert Lipscomb (phonetic),
staff member, learned of a plot by a group of Negro men who were
in possession of rifles and Molotov cocktails to initiate a riot.
He claimed that: Lipscomb personally prevented the riot by calming
the Negro group and personally collecting the rifles and Molotov
cocktails but that when Ratliff learned of Lipscomb's role in
preventing the riot, he officially took credit for. the action.
Our source stated that Ratliff unofficially considers Lipscomb
an "Uncle Tom,"

The above information is being made available to
Mrs, Stegall at the White House, Mr. Shriver of the Office of

Economic Opportunity, and the Attorney General by letters dated
9/18/67.

Dear Mre Hoovers

On ogcasion it has proved important in connection with United S
‘interests in and relations with the other American Republics to obtain
intelligence information on activities taking place within the United
Statese Specifically, it is important that the Department keep track of
the movements and contacts of selected Latin Americans while in this

and coordinated heree Such activities are against the national interests
of the United States in so far as they may result in developments which
could endanger United States lives, threaten United States business
interests and cause friction within the inter-American systems

In the past the FBI has always cooperated in furnishing the Department
in specific Latin American cases with information available from estab-
lished sources, but it has shown understandable reluctance to become in-
volved to the extent of conducting direct surveillance in cases where
there is no evidence of nor reason to suspect subversive activities
directed against the United States or violation of United States lawse
It is felt that while this information is helpful, it does not completely
fill the gap in the intelligence information important in the condtct of
foreign relationss It is understood that the CIA, while interested in
foreign intelligence, does not carry out surveillance operations within
the confines of the United Statese

} It would be most appreciated if you could express an opinion’as to
how surveillance of selected Latin American visitors to this country might
be arranged on an individual case bapise _ i

An identical letter is being sent to the CIA in the hope that a
coordinated approach can be mades- 7 7 :

OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR

i The Honorable Robert Murphy
Deputy Under Secretary for Political Affairs
Department of State
Washington, BD. C.

Dear Mr. Murphy:

Reference is made to your letter of 10 October 1955, xelative to

the problem of conducting surveillance of certain Latin American 7
nationals who might be suspected of carrying on subversive activities

e in the United States, directed against Latin American countries. In
this regard you are correct in your understanding that the CIA does
not conduct such surveillances within the confines of the United States,
Mr. Hoover has furnished me a copy of his reply to your inquiry setting
forth the FBI's jurisdiction and responsibilities in this matter.

We have been furnishing to the Department and to the FBI such
intelligence information as we have obtained through our operations
abroad bearing upon possible subversive activities of the type of per-
son you describe, as such information became available to us. | lt
would also be helpful if we could receive from time to time from the
Department, leads which you may receive and which we could possibly

+ follow up in the Latin American country against which subversive
activities are being carried on. :

In order to assist us in developing our coverage of this field, we
would suggest that you designate someone im the Department of State
who could confer with the appropriate persons in this Agency, and if
you will let me know whom you will designate for this purpose, I will
arrange to put him in touch with my representative. Also, if you see _
no objection, will mention thie matter to the members of the IAC

Sincerely, : °

I wish to thank you for your letter of October 14, 1955 in

which you’ stated that there is no reluctance on the part of the J Gi

FBI to conduct physical surveillance of selected Latin American ibe ae

visitors to this coutry where the circumstances warrant such
action. Your assurances that every effort will be made in these
eases to.develop those aspects which may be of particular inter~

*<. given to the utilization of a physical surveillance when requested \
by the Department of State where it is agreed that this type of
covercge is warranted and necessary, should prove helpful in Oy
handling these cases in the future.

Vhen the Department of State has reason to believe that visit-
ing Latin Americans may be engaged in planning and coordinating
subversive activities directed at other governments of this
hemisphere, such information will be: brought to the attention of
the FBI through established channels as heretofore, together
with an explanation of the Department's objectives and requirenents,

The continued cooperation of “the FBI is’ greatly appreciated.

At the IAC neeting on November 29, 1955, Mre sGeody

gotng tnto the Sovtet camp. During the disoussion, tt
.. appeared to be the optnion of the IAC group that the Sovi i
“government ts able to offer considerable advantages to
‘NO Afghantetan in the way of trade routes byprsatng Pakistan,
\ wtth whteh Afghanistan ts having difficulties, and through

was the feeling that there ts o strong possibility Afghanistan

BoEEPRE There were several changes suggested in the CIA :

paper, and Hro Kuhrtz will get @ copy of it for our benefit.

~—sS In line with our recent discussions, it ts suggested
that a memorandum be prepared, briefly posing the problem that
Afghantatan nay cone under Soviet control and then reflecting

control of country, we would have to consider giving comparable coverage
to Afghan diplomatic establishments and official personnel as now given to

OFK Act 5 (g) (2) (D)

Sound counterintelligence coverage requires sources to
produce not only investigative data but also intelligence data of
value to us and other agencies in guiding policy and making
decisions. Bureau is expected to produce intelligence data and
we can anticipate criticism as well as operational moves by other
agencies to fill vacuum if our operations do not produce necessary
data. Sound source programs are based on long-range planning and

require forward thinking to get results. Scrambling for sources
in reaction to problems is too late and ineffective.

ts ts recognized 9 echni que
countries where need for data exists with emphasis
on “trouble spot” countries that tend to drift toward, or are targets
of, Soviet Bloc and those countries involved in situations with inter-
national ramifications. This program has paid off in sound benefits

and existing sources represent effective outposts for gathering data
in event of emergency as well as for investigative purposes. .

Venezuela in January, 1958, the country has been ruled by a Junta. vx

SUBJECT:

RANA

It has become apparent from daily news stories that

Venezuela is presently in a state of political upheaval. Although
the leader of the Junta, Admiral Larrazabal, has stated he has no
political aspirations it has been pointed out by correspondents that
he has recently given indication of this by touring the country and
"wooing" the support of the communists. This reportedly has been
done by statements attributed to Larrazabal that he could not conceive
of a Venezuelan communist being controlled by the USSR since all
Venezuelans are inherently patriotic and loyal to Venezuela. It has
also been pointed out that the communists of Venezuela are being
Played up as the heroes of the recent revolution in that country.

{ Some correspondents have stated that it is felt there will possibly

i be a military coup if the politicians of Venezuela do not soon set up:

| @ government acceptable to the military leaders. Jt is further r

: noted that the Vice President and Mrs. Nixon experienced insults
| during their tour of Latin America, the most vicious of which

recently indicated a stronger stand in favor of the U 3.3 various ra
media have reported that politically powerful nationalist and leftist
\ groups do exist in Brazil and that until recently Brazil's President a
\ avoided offending such groups. as)

Anti-U. S. feelings and demonstrations were exhibited iw ne
during the South American trip of Vice President and Mrs. Nixon and
although the demonstrations did not attain the violence exhibited in some
of the other South American countries, the demonstrations indicated the
work of well-organized group or groups opposed to the WU &.

On 7-8-58, Wilson Velloso, Press Attache, Brazilian Embassy,
who admitted former membership in the Communist Party of Brazil, upon
interview at his request, stated that he had attempted to discuss }

Communist Party activities with Brazilian officials but they indice ved

.
indifference to such information in 1951. E
Velloso supposed the reason for the indifference was that Ais ae
information was common knowledge; however, another explanation would be %&
sanction of the Communist Party on the part of Brazilian officials, even ©
though the Communist Party has been outlawed there. Velloso stated he &
knew of no communist influence at the Brazilian Embassy but stated that 6
it was the tendency of Latin American countries at this time to play S
communist countries against noncommunist countries in an effort to ii
obtain all they could in the nature of aid and assistance, inferring si
that the Brazilian Embassy would also attempt this practice. °

Velloso
commented that he did not believe that such negotiations on the part of

Latin American countries necessarily indicated keine Phayawe nos = r7

JFK Act 5 (g)(2)(D)

In view of the above information, it would appear that Brazil
could easily align itself with the Soviet-bloc countries and thereby
create an international situation affecting the U. S. While there is
no apparent indication at this time of a political upheaval in Brazil,
Brazil's President's recent opposition to the nationalist and leftist
groups in Brazil might tend to develop internal strife in Brazil,
leading to such an upheaval.

Reference’ is made to information recently furnished to j

the Bureau by a highly sensitive source being handled by the DE
Washington Field Office (WFO) indicating that Soviet and satéllite
intelligence representatives have a keen interest in assistance being
rendered by our "friends." The were referring to attaches from
India, Indpnesia, and United Arab Republic who apparently have been
collecting certain types of information for the Soviet and satellite
representatives. S

The foregoing again confirms that the Soviets and the os,
satellites realize. that representatives of noncommunist diplomatic
establishments can be of tremendous value to them. Naturally, a #
representative of the Indian Embassy has access to U. S. institutions
and areas not usually accessiblé to the Soviets and satellites.
Furthermore, @ representative of such an embassy can mix in circles
and have access to Americans and others without being placed under
any particular suspicions. If such an individual is recruited by
the Soviets, he can operate with an excellent covera::. We previously
have seez instances where the Soviets have taken an terest in
representatives of Latin American countries apparently for the purpose
of recruiting them as agents.

The Bureau feels the above program is essential
in view of the strategie location of Thailand and its
proximity to Commmist China and Laos, the current area
of political unrest. ft is felt sources developed within
@iplomatic establishments of Thailand could furnish pertinent
information regarding political conditions and political
trends in Southeast asia which would be of considerable
interest to other U S. Government agencies.

in regard to Ruth Nuomi Burney, WFO should open
@ Separate 134 ivvestigation on her to develop additional
background information as required in Section 107 of the
Manual of Instructions to make certain she is type of person
we want to contact as a sourse. Lf the investigation is
favorable, submit your request to the Bureau for State
Department clearance to interview her. Bear in mind thai
when Burney is of no further interest to us, the Bureau
should so advise CIA,

Bufiles ‘fail to disclose any pertinent derogatory
information identifiable with Ruth Naomi Burney.

See pithin That land diplomatic establishments in the Us Ses
WBO and New York being so advised. State Department also
furnished clearance for very discreet investigations of
potential sources which we will select. In view of the

I. REVOLUTIONARY PROGRAM AND PoLiclss
AS EXPRESSED BY BPP LEADERS

A press conference was held in Grant Park,
Chicago, Illinois, on July 31, 196%, by memburs of the
BPP and the SDS. This press conference was recorded
by Special Agents (SA) GORDON S. BROOKS, JAMHS i. HANLON,
and RICHARD J. O!T and the following is a t serinption
of the remarks made by RUFUS WALLS, Deputy nister of
Information of the Illinois Chanter cf the BPP:

"Black Panther Party Illinois. This is 7 :
Field Marshal BOB LEE, this is the Denuty Min- i
ister of Defense BOBBY RUSH. I want to say the
pigs dropnec on our office this morning about
two otclock. They just jumped out of the car,
no reason at all. I think they were on a trin
or something or drunk and just starteu shating
up there in the office and (inaudibie) atairs,
but the veonle started snooting buck. we teil
all the veovle to arm themselves against these
facist pigs and it's a true indication by what
action hannened at the Pantner headquarters
that if those Panthers hadn't been armed they
would have been murcered cead, all of them.

They went u» there in that office, 3 money,.
took axes and chopoed up ull the machines,

voured gasoline on the floor, on the food we

had for the breakfast ror children program und
literally set it afire. This is what we're
dealing witn in this country. Wetve been telling
the veoole all along that wetre living in a
fascist state. We know it because we've been
under fascism for 4OC years and you can't tell

NW 65360 Docld:32989646 Page 115



us nothing else. And the neople who don't
know it will know soon, if they don't get
themselves some pieces also and augh wo
just gonna go and so and we ain't gonna
let these pigs stop us because we are Lhe
vanguarc and we're gonna continue to be
the vanguard as long as the people are op-

Questions (inaudible).

You said were there two men inside the
office with shotguns and I'm saying if there
were they were within their rights to nave
shotguns in that office, and I can imagine
what would have havpened during the pigs!
attack on the office, it was without any tyne
of vrovocation. I can imagine if those brothers
had not had the weapons to defend themselves.
This is the essence of the, of the actions
right there. Whether or not if they had not
been armed, whether the nigs would have onversl
fire not knowing that those brothers (insudible)
had the strategic weapons to resist them and
the proper technical equipment to defend them-
selves. No knowing, had those vigs been allowed
to enter the office, what would have hannened
to those brothers uv there.

This is the question right here.
‘Qrestions (inaudible).

The pigs had been building uv their courage
all day. They have been harassing veople all
day. They have arrested five of them across the
street in the parking lot. Earlier that day they
had been sitting out in front of the office getting

boozed up and insulting veonple walking along
the street. They have been building this un
all day ana I knew they would nrobubly come
down sometime sooner or later.

Questions (inaudible).

(Inaudible) no in the same car they
- were coming back and forth around the office.
They had a whole squadrol of pigs (inaudible)
earlier that afternoon (inaudible) on some
trumved un charge, it was just something that
was building up. You can judge when the pigs
are ready to make an attack, you can judge
by their actions cause they, they, you know got
to have courage and still within them they
have to build that un with booze and they have
to become very emotional and wild.

Questions. You say they were harassing
peonle on the street? .

Right, right, righto.

Questions. You mentioned before a great
deal about defense, what about retaliution?
You plan retaliatory action?

No, no. We're not trying (inaucible),.
Now what we're going to do as far as (inaudible) -
to insure that the occupation troops are with-

23 ~ 29, 196%, vaition of the chicago Deremier, a
Chicago, Illinois-newspaner:

"tWhile the buffoons are busy going to
the moon, we're down here on earth giving
free food and medical servies to ounressed
veople,! asserted Frec Hamcton, deouty
chairman of the [llincis Black Panther Party
in an interview with the baily befencer at
1 week's enc,

tBut Nixon,! Hamnton continued, tis an
international bully who can't fool anybody
no matter how many focls he sends to the
moon cause we're going to be dealing with
the problems on earth.!

slightly connected with the Chicago Police
Department ("fascist vigst), but he also got
in hardhitting jabs at ‘apathetic blacks,’
SCLC's Oneration Breadbasket and other sub-
dects.

| Not only did Hampton assail anyone

Accompanying Hampton in the interview
were Deputy Party Chairman ol! Defense Bobby
} Rush and Minister of Health Honald Sanchel,
who described plans for the onening the first
of Sentember of a free health center at 3852
_ W. 16th st.

NW 65360 Docld:32989646 Page 120



NW 65360 Docld:32989646 Page 121

‘what we're doing for the peonle just
heightens the contradictions of chargea made
against the Panther Purty,' said Sanchel, 4
slightly built youth of 19. a

According to Sanchel, a survey of the
Westside community indicated that residents
wanted the center to provide, in order of
imoortance, pediatrics, obstetrics, dentistry
and general medical care. 7

‘We're asking for donations from medi-
eal and drug companies and for doctors and
nurses to provide services free of charge,t
said the young director matter of factly.

‘So far, we have l2 doctors signed un
for the staff and we're in pretty good shane
for our beginning staff of nurses,! he said,
tbut we need lab and X-Ray technicians and
of course, money.' Members of the party are
also being trained as technicians, he said.

Free car service to and from the center
will also be provided, Sanchel udded. Plans
also call for exoansion of the center to in-
clude comorehsnsive medical care.

In addition to noney, building materials
for rehabilitation of ‘the center's quarters
are needed desverately, he said. 'This is one
obstacle that we faced in onening uv the cen-
ter earlier because the building that we
secured needed so much renair, and we've
been working on it daily,' Sanchel stated.

Hamoton and Rush looked on approvingly
as Sanchel enthusiastically discussed the health
center. Hamoton, 29, was recently released on
$10,900 bond vending an apreal of a two to five
year jail sentence on April 7 of a robbery of
an ice creain truck in Maywood.



__ NW 65360 ‘Docld:32989646 Page 122

Assailing the conviction, he launched
into an attack on the court system, prisons
and a tecanitulistic society full of fascist,
demagogue noliticians, avurizious business-
men and racist pig nolice.!

'My case shouldn't have even been trini
by Judge Sidney Jones,’ Hampton asserted.
tJones had just acquittea this guy Kamberos
whose car killed a kid.

tAnd everybody was talking about a
mistrial. Yet, Itm convicted of stealing
some ice cream and my appeal is to be answered
in two months, imagine that, two months. . .
robbery of some ice cream takes precedence over
any other case incluaing murder.!

During his three months in Menard state
orison, Hampton said he was kent in isolation,
denied eye glasses and medical care. tYou
should see how they treat us in nrison,!' he
said. Anyone who doesn't get any mail or any
visitors is kicked around and pretty seon you
don'ts see that -risoner anymore. And there
wasn't one black guard at Menard. Now check
that out.

Hampton was asked: What do you think
will curd the harassment of the Panthers.

'First we have to educate the veonle as
to who their enemy really is and it ain't us.
Next show them how to defend themselves against
the pig nower structure and then they'll.be
ready to defend us and themselves the next time
we're'attacked! Hampton answered.

What about the charges of Panther in-
timidation and threats made to black veople?
was another question posed to the Panther leader.



Rush answered this question. tYes,
we are arsed but this is our constitutional
right and it is only in self defensos.
don't believe in harassing anybody to niin
them join our party and we ourge Individual-
ists who are racists and don't want to ubide
by our vrogram. And it anyone has a complaint
about this kind of thing he or she should come
to the office and wet:? nunish the »erson in
front of the commlainant,t he said.

When asked about their feelings toward
SCLC's Orerution Breadbasket, Hampton said
that organization should have initiated the
free feeding program.

YJesse Jackson spoke at our convention : .
in California a few weeks ago anc he should : i
put into action what he said there because
he got two standing ovations when he snoke,
Hampton said.

tand Jesse should be telling the neople
about peorle like Hanruhan, Mayor Richard J.
Daley and Police Gang Inteiligence Unit head
(Edward) Buckney and the atrocities they're
verpetuating on black veonle.

tIn fact,' Hampton continued, 'Jesse
should get on the radio and make a (public
service) tape in direct onnoosition to what
Hanrahants telling the neonle to do about the
gangs.! (Hamaton was snnarently referring to
Hanrahan's public service announcements
which advise Chicago citizens to lodge com-
plaints with his office if they were intimt-
dated or harassed by gang memvpers.)

‘All these pigs do is label a gang and
then the people start believing that meas and

next thing, 412 the young warriors, the
youths who wil! fight the nowar structure
are thrown in jall, indicted and ob away
for good. . . these neopis had better get
hi- te whet's hagening ini ston going a-
round believing these t st rigs.

‘And the next tine the niga attack our
headquarters, there's goiny to be a lot of
dead vigs. We didn't tire back wnen the 1'BL
busted in ‘cause we wante? to show the neonle
who the eneny really is. But the next time,
the veonie will aefend us,' Hampton mclured.

‘One thing's for sure,' said Haaston
confidently, 'the Black Panther Party is not
Boing to be sunpressed no matter what the
pigs like Hanrahan, Daley, suckney, and (vook
County Jail Suxt.) Winston Moore do.

'Wetre the vanguard of the neonle and
we say more nower tn the neople and the neonle
are our first and most imnortant concern,'"*

On August 29, 1969, a rally was held in Grant
Park, Chicago, Illinois, to commemorate the confronta-
tions between the Chicago Police Devartment (PL) and
the demonstrators during the Democratic National Conven-
tion held during August, 1968. SA SAMUEL P. WALLACE
made a tapne recording of sneeches at the above rally on

purvorting to be members or sympathizers with the BPP,

the Young Lords and the Young Patriots, whose membership
is comprised of the Applachian poor on Chicago's near

CAMPBELL used the Jargin of 'pigs' and
‘mechanical fools! in referring to »olice.

The Constitution gives the right to
any person to bear arms and every member
‘Black Panthers! is required to have four
guns' he said.

| . In reponse to other questions, CAMPBELL
said the Black Panthers are opposed to Capital-
ism,Fascism and violence.

‘We plan to have breakfast ror children
because Capitalism cunnot feed #11 children’
CAMPBELL said.

Asked how the breakfast would be
financed, CAMPBSLL said, 'It would be done
through the sale of acwspapers and through

NW.65360 Docld:32989646 Page 129



CAMPBELL was not certuin where the
headquarters for the Joliet Black Panthers
would be located. But organizationally,
as is Panther procedure, local officers
would be under State Chapters and Section
Leader Direction.

Asked if the Black Panthers would try
to obtain their objectives to political
action, CAMPBELL answered that they did not
- intend to work at local levels but rather
aaa through top level political figures in achiev-

, ing their goals."

On October 16, 1969, the current issue of
"The Provisg Herald," a weekly newspaper, distributed
the Maywood, Illinois area, cerded an article en-
titled, "HAMPTON, GRAHAM, Blast Poverty Bias," which
3 reads as follows:

Paes spec eeer, "Thirty-nine years ago, the Melrose Park
i village board denied the request of a group
of black residents to build a church within
the village, claiming it would attract 'the
colored element from Maywood and Chicago.!

Last Tuesday, Proviso area blacks met in
the First Baptist Church of Melrose Park, a
Negro church, to discuss other ‘probleme of
black people in the suburbs.'

The small crowd (about 35 or 0) ranged
from intense Black Panthers with high and
wide Afro haircuts to middle aged suburban
couples. —

FRED HAMPTON, dairman of the Illinois
Black Panthers, was scheduled to appear along
yith the Rev. GEORGE CLEMENTS; Dr. CHARLES
“HURST, dean of Malcolm X college; and BILL
*GRAHAM of Maywood's Human Relations commission.

Nw 65360 Docld:32989646" Page 130



“HURST and CLEMENTS didn't show, so GRATAM
led off with a multi-pronged attack on what the
federal and local government is and is not
doing.

He blasted the oroposed family Nanning
‘program, saying that the pill, 'which is not
yet safe, is going to be shoved down our throats.!

‘When genocide can be forced upon us,
“there is some question as to the sanity of a
system that would allow this,' he said.

. on GRAHAM, calmly but angrily, called the
’ @lenentary schools in dist. 89 'a network of
failure factories,' and high school dist. 209
_tracist oriented.!

He also’ ‘oited poor housing for low and
middle: income families where 'rats play
hopscotch with a dead roach,' and 'a welfare
system where recipients have to storm the
wafare office to get what they're entitled
to on paper.'

RON SATCHEL, health minister of the
Illinois Blaci: Panthers, guve a brief talk on
the organization's free breakfast program
and free health care center.

He also scored family »Dlanning, saying
that ‘increasing population isn't tho pro-
plem,. but the maldistribution of food.!

7 But it was FRED HAMPTON who. dominated
‘the meeting. With the skill of a practiced
surgeon, he dissected mid-twentieth century
American society.



at we huve in thie country
Ty begra, ‘and thore ape

1 ts; the avaricious bu
gogic politiciun, ana the
pig dog policeman.'

HAMPTON, embattled in the courts on as-
sault charges, said one oi the worst dangers
for blacks is their belicf in the white power
‘structure's 'false values.

. ‘Athletics and entertainment are the |
biggest form of exploitation there is,' he
cried, blasting the likes of WILT CHAMBERLAIN
and singer JAMES BROWN as helping to perve-
tuate a dangerous myth.

'Hell, with all this work a be done, we
got no time for vlaying.'

The Panther chairman said that everyone
hag-the rignt to defend himself, so if people
don't want the Panthers to have guns, all
guns should be thrown in the ocean and not
turned in to Chicago police sup. JAMES CONLISK
‘so that he can sell theu.'

‘When you mix explosive chemicals and
put them in a keg,' he continued, ‘you can
march'around it, picket it, slap petitions

on it, but it's still explosive. You have
to get inside at the chemicals, the cause.!

: * HAMPTON said he knew his theories weren't
very popular.

1Bus look, I'n 21, if you think that it
has ‘all havvened in 21 years and that I did it,
then you should take me out and shoot me. But



you and I know these situetions have been
around for a long time, and the only peo le
who can change anything is us, the peovl.!

. He vleude! for unity among all poor
people of every color to unite against capi-
talism, 'we'vo had too miny wars on poverty,

On Seotember 17, 196%, there w
orientation class of the BPP helcé et the
Blood Church, Congress and Western Avenuc, Chicuso.
Approximately 12 to 15 people were in attendance. The
elass primarily concerned reading and discussion of a
pamphiet by HUZY NSWTON entitled "HUKY falks to the
People" or something to that effed. Some of the issues
discussed were the white revolutionary and the role
they should play, and working with whites and the biluck
revolutionary movement.

The esence of the discussion was that the
true role of the wnite revolutionary was to work with-
in the white comunity, which was referred to as tne
mother country, and give suovsort to the struggles
waged by the BPP and other black revolutionary prougs
within the black comunity, which is referred to as the :
eolony. It w also suggested that when the pevolu-
tionaries in e colony come unuer attack the volice
powers, that the correct thing ror the white revol
tionaies to do woulc be to c.uct trouble ia the mother
country s0 4s to the police forces ov divert

Saturday September 13 at 6:45 P.M. the fascist pig cops shot
dames Hoy (3314 W. Monroe St.) two times in the head while his
hands were up. James Hoy was murdered by a pig who hides behind
badge #3261} and drives car #70-30. James Hoy, 17, is another
‘example of murder, brutality, and torture of Black People in this
fascist capitalistic country: Pig Mayor Daley, Pig Chief Conlisk,
and Hammerhead states attorney Hanrahan are directly responsible
for the subhuman actions of these mad maniacs who occupy our com-
munities. There were witnesses who say the Pigs shot James Hoy
with his hands up. Charles Cox, 20, was beaten to death by the
pigs. in a cell at Fillmore Station; Linda Anderson, 17, was mur-
dered by a fool pig who shot blindly, threw her down for. no rea-
son ur cause. James Johnson, 18, was murdered by Daley's mad
pigs at 15th and Keeler, and Larry Roberson, a member of the Van-
guard, was killed as he was helping the people, but Larry Roberson

“was a Panther and ne shot two pigs before he was overcome:

We, the Black Panther Pary, will stand by the peovle to re-
moye these mad beasts! We say in #7 of the Ten Point Program:
paseu "We want an immediate end to police brutality and

‘ murder of black people."
The second ammendment of the Consitution gives us a right to bare
arms te protect ourselves when this government doesn't recognize
the Rights of the People. It is crystal clear that this filthy
government is killing off the black youth, and we will not go
without a fight! :

3 Deputy Chairman Fred Hampton says, "If you kill a few you
get a little satisfaction. If you kill some more, you get some
move satisfaction. But when you kil] them all, you get complete
satisfaction.” j

nani STOP FASCISM aay :

Fascism is the power of finance capital itself--- the greedy
businessman, the demagogic politician( one who leads the people
by appealing to prejudices and passions), and tha racist dog cop.
Each of which carries out the oppression and exploitation of the
working class people in the guise of democracy.

The BLACK PANTHER PARTY, THE VANGUARD PARTY, finds it our
daty to educate the poor and oppressed people to the form that
this. capitalistic, racist system is taking-~- FASCISM. Cold
blooded fascism is exemplified in the assaination of Malcolm X,
the :Amprisonment of Huey P. Newton for his political beleifs,
the agsajueiion of Martin Luther King, the occupation of ©
flmington, Delaware for one year aftcr the death of King, the
“24,000 throops at the Chicago Democratic Convention, the necessity
. ox “the exile of Eldrigde Cleaver, the national repression of the

Black Panther Party, the attack on the Republic of New Africa‘s
Convention, the brutal attack on the people of Berkley by 7,000
mndtional guardsmen, and the representatives of all progressive
elements that are struggling to wrest the power out of the hands

of the oppressor and return it to the people.

_.. We, the masses of the people, must unite around this commo.
enemy of fascism toregain the power of the people. We, as a people,
have been stripped of our power as a result of oopression and ex-
ploitation. Before we can regain that power and begin to control
our own cGestinies this system must suffer a revolutionary change
for the good of all the people.

" Power cocedes nothing without demand ". Without our dcmand
to neutralize oz surpress the power of this system, we will in turn
suffer defeat under fascism and lose our move for liberation to return
the power to the people. :

bers should come in daily and pick up vaners by at

On September 18, 1969, issue of the
Chicago Tribune, Chicago, Illinois, newspaper,
page 5, Column 1, contained the following article:

"Find Panthers Feed Only a Few Children

The Black Panther party's program to
feed breakfast to school children is almost non-
existent in Chicago, a Tribune investigation
disclosed yesterday.

Altho Fred Hampton, the party's Illinois
chairman, claims that 3,000 to 3,500 children are being
fed at three locations each week, it was found that
on some days the centers were never opened and
on others only a handful of children showed up.

Solicit Food and Cash 7

Local and federal law enforcement
agencies, which-“have been closely watching the
Panthers’ activities, have also discovered that
the Panthers continue to solicit food, milk, and
cash donations for the program from merchants and
other business men thruout the city.

One merchant, who regularly donates
large amounts of food for the program, recently told
investigators that when he visited one of the centers,
the few children present were being read excerpts from
what he said was the Communist Manifesto before the
breakfast was served.

List 3 Locations

The Panthers list their breakfast
centers in the Trinity Lutheran church, 4837 State
Street, the Jackson Boulevard Christian church, 2412
Jackson blvd., and the Better Boys Foundation club,
1512 S. Pulaskiird.
i All three of the feeding centers were
visited Tuesday and not one of them was open to
feed children.

At the Trinity church, two small boys
and six lecn-ayers waited outside for more than
an hour but nobody came with the key to open the
building. One of the boys finally went to a nearby
grocery and purchased a bag of potato chips which

he shared with his companion. .
“Children Walk By

Altho the church is located near DuSable
High school, 4934 Wabash Av., the Farren Elementary
school, 5055 State st., and across the street from
the Taylor homes housing project, hundreds of youngsters
walked past without even bothering to stop.

Other youngsters made brief stops in
the nearby grocery and a restaurant before going
on to school.

No Breakfasts Lately

At the Jackson boulevard, church the
door was locked. Investigators’ reports noted that
the church has been opened for the free breakfasts
only sporadically during the last month.

At 1512 S. Pulaski, there were no signs
of any feeding program in progress. A tven-age
youth sweeping the stairway said that “they haven't
been feeding kids here for several weeks."' He said
he had heard reports that the program would be
starting again soon.

Yesterday, 22 children of grade school
age were counted going into the Trinity church
for breakfast. On other occasions, investigators
noted children leaving the building with
half-eaten sandwiches and then throwing them in a
wastebasket on the sidewalk. Since the program was
begun at the church two months ago, detectives said
a high of 45 children (and on some days only four
or five) were fed there.

NW 65360 Docid:32989646 Page 161



Church Predicts Change

In the case of the Trinity church,
‘investigators learned that the Panthers took over
the building. The pastor Left in January and the
building is now open only for Sunday services.

‘The Rev. Kenneth Young, an official
of the Missouri synod's northern Illinois district
of the Lutheran church, refused to comment on reports
that the Panthers had been asked to vacate the building.
last Saturday. 7

{ have no comment at this time”, he
said. But there may be some developments concerning
the building next week.

The breakfast-for-children program
was started by the Panthers national headquarte
in Oakland last April, and several feeding centers
were established in the San Francisco bay arva.

However, authorities on the west coast
told The Tribune that only small numbers of children
are being fed there.”

This source advised on October 6, 1969,
that he had determined that FRED HAMPTON, Deputy
Chairman of the Illinois Chapter of the BPP,

Chicago, Illinois, had informed representatives of the
National Chapter of the BPP in California that th:
BPP in Chicago was encountering some problems in
@nnection with the establishment of their health
clinic. It was the sources understanding in that
regard that HAMPTON had remarked that the Vice

Lords, a Chicago West Side Youth Gang, had

disrupted activities at the health clinic that day

and in thatconnection had ordered the Minister of
Health of the Chicago BPP Chapter and an electrician
performing work at the clinic to leave the establishment
that afternoon. HAMPTON according to the

source, had indicated that the clinic was not open as
some work had to be done prior to its opening.

NW 65360 Docld:32989646 Page 162



—,
LE.

This source further advised that ut was
his understanding that HAMPTON had indicated that
the Vice Lords have a strong hold in the area of
the clinic, but despite this the BPP would
gO ahead and open it in order to make an impr
upon the people in the community. HAMPTON also
reportedly remarked that if need be the BPP would
execute executive mandate number 3. It was.not known
what that mandate meant.

sion

The source added that there were a number
of factors that HAMPTON had described which pertainec
to the situation concerning the situation among
which was an alleged war between the Blackstone
Rangers and other Chicago youth gangs and the Vice
Lords.

The source further advised that the
BPP in Chicago planned to have the clinic opened in

VII. EVIDENCE OF BLACK PANTHER PARTY

ATTEMPTS TO AFFILIATE OR FORM
COALITIONS WITH OTHER GROUPS

On September 8, 1969, STEPHANIE FISHER
of the Chicago BPP Headquarters contacted JUNE
HILLIARD of the BPP National Headquarters, and
informed HILLIARD that a brother from St. Paul,
Minnesota, named RONNIE REID, had been in contact
with Chicago BPP Headquarters claiming he had
received authorization from the National Office
to initiate a United Front Against Fascism Organization
and a Lunch for Children Program.

HILLIARD stated the name of REID was familiar and
the National BPP Headquarters had advised all
individuals calling in with requests that they
could establish a United Front Against

Fascism Organization and initiate organizations
in their communities. Once these programs are
initiated, they were instructed to report their
activities to the National Office of the BPP.
HILLIARD stated he did not recall authorizing any
one from St. Paul to initiate any program but as
long as they are doing it and not using the name
of the BPP, there was nothing the BPP could

do about it.

9/8/69)

On October 10, 1959, at about 11:00 a.m.,
CHARLENE MITCHELL, Field Secretary, National Black
Liberation Commission (NBLC), CP, USA, in company with
two leaders of the Illinois Communist Party (CP),
Met with several members of the BPP including
FRED HAMPTON, Deputy Chairman, Illinois BPP, at
BPP Headquarters, Chicago, Illinois, for the purpose
of exchanging ideas in the struggle for black
liberation as well as finalizing plans for
MITCHELL to be the main speaker at the "End the
War Now” Rally on October 12, 1969, in Chicago,
| Illinois, which affair is being sponsored by the African-
American Heritage Association (AAHA) (a characterization
of which is contained hereinafter). HAMPTON is also
to be one of the speakers at the above mentioned
vally.

General discussion at BPP Headquarters
in Chicago indicated that the BPP and CP have
a concurrent theory toward the anti-riot law
trial currently in process in Chicago, Illinois,
in that neither want to become involved in any
violence or possible arrest Situations.

NW 65360 Docld:32989646 Page 164



: e e
ae ~ '

FRED HAMPTON stated that the demonstrations
by the BPP at the Federal Building in Chicago during
the trial are for the purpose of telling the facts
to the people. He stated that BPP ds somewhat allied
with the faction of MIKE KLONSKY, current member of
the National Interim Committee (NIC) of the
SDS and current leader of the Revolutionary Youth
Movement II (RYM II) faction of SDS, but that the
current leadership of SDS, called the Weatherman
faction, are a "bunch of damn fools”.

HAMPTON claimed that the BPP is the
vanguard in this country whereupon CHARLENE MITCHELL
. questioned this statement stating that actually
the vanguard are those who work on the basis of a
Marxist-Leninist outlook. :

Further discussion brought out that
preparations are being made by the BPP to circulate
petitions for community control of the local police
departments and that a survey indicates that the
people in the ghetto are very enthusiastic over
this idea.

Concerning the establishment of a National
Defense Organization, CHARLENE MITCHELL stated that
prospects are good for calling a national conference
of such an organization where possibly branches of
the organization can be established in the major
cities in this country. In this connection, MITCHELL
spoke of ANGELA DAVIS, a California CP professor at
the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA)
where attempts had been made to dismiss her, but
that people rallied to her support and that such
broad defense support should also be established
for BOBBY SEALE, Chairman, National BPP, who is
one of the defendants in the anti-riot trial in
Chicago,

_no right to have BOBBY SEALE in jail or to try

HAMPTON felt that the BPP program should
appeal to the masses, including such projects as
breakfasts for school schildren and work toward the
establishment of health centers since the communities
cannot absorb large quantities of ideology, but must
be assisted where personal needs exist.

Another conclusion of this meeting is that
the CP and BPP are not “sticking their necks out for
anybody"’, particularly in connection with the antiriot
trial in Chicago.

On October 12, 1969, an "End the War Now"
Rally, sponsored by the AAHA was held at the Joe
Louis Theater, 35th and State Streets, Chicago,
Illinois.

Approximately 225 people attended. CP
and non-CP people were in attendance. .

: CHARLENE MITCHELL introduced FRED HAMPTON
as one of the speakers.

HAMPTON stated that the government has

him. The BPP is serving the people in the community
by feeding school children and soon plans ta complete
a medical center.

HAMPTON stated that the Chicago Police
Department has raided the Illinois BPP Headquarters
in Chicago so often that now it is almost becoming
a museum. People want to see how the building has
been shot up. The BPP, however, will continue to
grow since they are the vanguard.

HAMPTON stated that we must stop the war
in Vietnam. Women and children are being killed in
Vietnam while here the "pigs" are doing the same thing.

CHARLENE MITCHELL, the main speaker, first
déscribed herself as the first black woman to ever
run for president of the United States. She stated
that recently she had been in Africa where America is still

BLACK PANTHE

According to its official newspaper, the Black Panther
Party (BPP) was started during December, } 3, in Ouwkland,
California, to organize black people so they can take control
of the life, politics, and the destiny of the black community.
It was organized by BOBBY GEORGE SELALhL, BPP Chairman, and HUEY
P. NEWTON, BPP Minister of Defense. NEWTON is presently serving
a sentence of 2 to 15 years on a conviction of manslaughter in
connection with the killing of an Oakland police officer.

The official newspaper, "The Bluck Panther," which further
describes itself as the "Black Community News Service," states
that the BPP advocates the use of guns and guerrilla tactics
in its revolutionary program to end oppression of thé black
people. Residents of the black community wre urged to arm
themselves against the police who are consistently referred to
in the publication as "pigs" who should be killed.

"The Black Panther" issue of September 7, 1968, contains
an editorial by BPP Minister of Education, GLORGEK MASON MURRAY,
which ends. with the following:

“Black men. Black people, colored persons of America,
revolt everywhere, Arm yourselves. The only culture worth keeping
is a revolutionary culture. Change. Freedom everywhere.

Dynamite! Black Power. Use the gun. Kill the pigs everywhere."

Included in the introduction to an article appearing
in the October 5, 1968, edition of “The Black Panther’ is the
statement,".....we will not dissent from American Government,
we will overthrow it."

7 Issues of "The Black Panther" regularly contain
“ quotations from the writings of Chairman MAO Tse-tung of the
People's Republic of China and feature MAO's statement that
"political power grows out of the barrel of a gun."

~The national headquarters of the BPP is located at
3106 Shattuck Avenue, Berkeley, California. Branches have been
established at various lo¢ations throughout *he Unb'ec States.

Let me make it very clear that the Black Panther

Party supported the action of the RYM II faction

of SDS, of SDS. We don't support the people who’

are anarchistic, opportunistic, sovinistic and

most of all Custeristic. That's right, custeristic.
We don't dig people leading people ,............ eee
people are not prepared for...,(inaudible)..... aa

It doesn't make any differences because we ....... wae
we know that we are organized and if we are

educated all that we have to do is learn the political
line, learn those railraod tracks, that is what we
call the theory and no matter how hard it may seem,

it stays off those tracks, All we have to do is in
any given situation is to move from a basic ideology
that a revolution is an applied to use art and if we
are going to work we are going to work in that direction.
We have to understand that we have to move politically
and move organizationally and if we don't move that
way, we don't move anyway whatsoever, If you struggle,
you should struggle properly. You should stand up
struggling, stand up .... and if you don't stand up
stfuggling, you don't deserve to win. Anybody can

understand that.



Lot of people say that we shouldn't struggle, but

we did if we expect to win. In fact..the only way we

can win is if you struggle, but a lot of times you

could be just wasting your time, We have to spend
our time on revolution. We have got to spend our
time on the street, We are in the process now of
eliminating the states, we are in the process now

of eliminating the dictator and the pigs know this

is their last hope. They know it and they are

getting frantic, They are a bunch of frantic, facist

faggits, they know that. They know that because --
you know how a man is who is slipping off a mountely
and grabs on --~ grabs anything and holds on -----
you know why he does that----and the pigs see very

Clearly -~--right down here at the Federal Building.

They see very clearly that when the people get *
educated. (Some references to judges, ADOLF HITLER,

- MUSSOLINI, attorney general) ,..that the people are ines
to stop this (obscene), we are the ‘only ones that can
stop it, god dammit, we got to keep on educating,
organizing...........complaining that we are the that
have the power, We had the power, The power was

supposed to be ours.

assailant who was later identified as Spurgeon J.‘ Winters, Jr.,
Negro male, age 19, of 5647 South Perry, Chicago.

Another suspect in the shooting, Lance S. Bell,
Negro male, age 20, of 5809 South Indiana, Chicago, was shot
and captured in the alley behind the shooting incident. Bell
was wounded in the leg and right arm and has been charged
with murder. He is currently incarcerated at the Bridewell
Hospital, Chicago.

The police report on the incident reflects that
the incident was apparently the result of a previous per-
sonal altercation between Bell and one James Caldwell,
male Negro, 5804 South Calumet, who is a guard at the
Cook County Jail, Chicago.

As a result of this altercation, Bell, Winters,
and possibly others went to Caldwell's home looking for
him. He was not at home, and Caldwell's wife then called
the CPD. It was this call that the officers were responding _
to. : ’

The area outside the scene of the shooting remained
calm and no large crowds gathered.

A spokesman for the Deputy Superintendent's Office,
CPP, advised that the CPD is itn the process of attempting
to determine how many people actually took part in the shooting”
and is leoking for at least one and possibly two male Negroes,
details unknown, whom they believe took part in this shooting.
On November 23, 1969, a source, who has furnished
reliable information in the past, advised that Bell, although
carried as a member of the Illinois Chapter of the Black Panther
Party (BPP), is not a trusted membar of that Party inasmuch
as be is and was suspected of being an informant for the Biack
P Stone Rangers, a local Negro youth gang. Bell has been in-
active for’ several months, almost since joining the Party, due
to this suspicion, :
This source advised that Winters, also known as
Jake Winters, was a close associate of the BPP but was not a
member. He was very knowledgeable in weaponry and is sus—
pected of stealing several weapons from BPP headquarters,
ait Source advised, however, that the BPP is now claiming
that both Bell and Winters were upstanding BPP members and are
attempting to obtain their photographs and will publish the
story concerning captioned incident in the BPP newspaper in: the

near future.

‘ITI. TEACHING OF

advised on November 14, 1969,
he attended a political orientation class at the
Precious Blood Church, Western and Congress
“Streets, Chicago, on October 29, 1969. About
30 individuals were in attendance,

The major discussion centered on
arguments to counter the classic racist
doctrine that all whites are evil by nature
and cannot be saved except by extermination.

. The counter. argument was that a multiplicity

of reasons are responsible for the white race's
technological advantage over the non-white race,
but the white man's system of economics makes
bim the monster he is. It was also argued that
capitalism and imperialism by their very nature
causes the white man to act as he does. The
race or color of his skin has nothing to do with
his actions. Source was unable to identify

the leader of the above class.

also advised on November 14,
1969, a political orientation class of the BPP
was held on November 3, 1969, at the Precious
Blood Church, Western and Congress Streets,
Chicago, Illinois, with approximately 20-30
people present.

The class dealt with the last two
issues of the BPP newspaper, There was

letter’ to the BPP in which the Panthers were
criticized for their defense of "Fatch", an
Arab guerrilla movement.

“The Racist Dag Policeman must withdraw immediately from our

wgPASAUSE.Of thierwtatement made by Huey P. Newton, our minister
ope NS point 7 of the ten point proaram and platform
that says, " We want an immediate end to volice brutality and
- murder of black people”, wa must stand firm on the ten noint
program which was canvassed from the Black community bv the

eal,

JAKE WINTERS, a brother, a much beloved brother, a revolutionary,
a Black Panther made of red-hot niaqer steel,and the baddest
son of slaves that ever came from the womb of woman. I have
said these things about JAKE WINTERS, because they are already

a fact. It's objective reality, proven by words and actions

in defending the Black community.

On November 13, 1969, JAKE WINTERS stood face to face and toe te
toe; his shotgun in his hand, with Piq Daley's murderous task
force. He defined political power by blowing away racist pig
Frank Rappaport and racist pia John Gilhooley and retired 8 other
reactionary racist pigs before he was shot down. :



a,

It ig also a proven fact and reality that Dalev's task force makes
daiiy and weakly raids on the Black community. They murdered
little John Soto, 16 years old. They murdered Nichael Soto,

20 years old, and shot wildly and unconcerned through every |
window in one of the buildinas in the Henry Honer project, injurina
scores of children. They murdered Jimmy Tucker and untold others.

JAKE WINTERS understood’ that the only way to stop fascist pig 7
forces from invading and slaughtering Black people and people period
and that is by defendina yourself with arms in hand? He didn't
talk about Black Capitalism for surviving nor did he talk about
teachina “Pork Chop" culture Nationalism for surviving like Ron
Karenga's US organization in L.A. JAKE WINTERS was 18 vears old
and he made a far greater commitment than most men will ever
make in their entire life time. This brother was an honor
student, a graduate of Enqleworth High School who turned down
five scholarships to work for the People. He helped as much as
he possibly could at the Free Breakfast for Children Centers,

. plus he worked 7 days a week at the Post Office to bring in
money to keep the Centers operatina.

JAKE WINTERS is the highest personification of Huey P. Newton
and Halcolm X. The spirit of thege revolutionaries is
manifested in each member of the Black Panther Party and we
will always remember JAKE WINTERS. Because of JAKE WINTERS

we will Intensi?y the struggle; because of JAKE WINTERS we will
continue serving the poor oppressed people -- the Proletarfat.

JAIRMOAN |
FRED LIVES

At 5 a.m., December 4, Nixon and Daley's avaricious pigs
brutally slaughtered the Chairman of the IJlinois Chapter
of the Black Panther Party, and a member of the Peoria
branch, The pigs, with their usual tactics, attacked an *‘
apartment where 9 Panthers were sleeping. The result of
the raid: Fred Hampton and Mark Clark dead, four others
critically wounded, and three others arrested and charged
with attempted murder for defending themselves.

Chairman Fred was shot 7 times, Ronald "Doc" Sachel, Minister of Health and in charge of the

Free Medical Clinic, is in critical condition, shot 5 times, Deborah Johnson, an 8 1/2-month

pregnant sister, is in jail. The pigs won't let the lawyers see her or any of the other
political’ prisoners,

This is the second attack on a Panther apartment in 3 days. On December 2, 80 pigs attacked
and brutally beat 3 Panthers including another expectant mother, Lynn French. Tony Harris
was beaten so badly -that he was later unable to recognize his own wife. And just three weeks,
ago, Panther Jake Winters was gunned down defending the black community. i

These murders show clearly the fascist tactics that the yestapo Daleys, racist Hoffmans, war--

mongering Nixons and money-hungry Rorkefellers use against the Black Panther Party, progress-
ive people, and the poor, oppressed masses who are demanding their basic needs: land, bread,
housing, clothing, education, justice and peace.

The members of the Black Panther Party were right in defending themselves. Jake Winters’ re-~

volutionary actions were just and necessary. Any people whose constitutional rights are
trampled upon by the oinkiny pig: power structure have a right to pick up the gun.

He call upon all people to unite in stopping these monstrosities--the murders of Chairman
Fred, Mark Clark, Jake Winters, and all our Vietnamese brothers and sisters.

of so-called "law-n-order"?

A society that lives by the sword will be.torn apart
by the sword. The ancient law is still true: What-you sow, you
shall reap. Sure: members of the Black Panther Party have said
they have the right of armed self-defense. But how many of the
rest of us also keep guns around the house "just in case"?

Isn't it, then, hypocritical for white society to decry

APPENDIX

BLACK PANTHER PARTY

According to its official newspaper, the Black Panther
Party (BPP) was started during December, 1966, in Oakland,
California, to organize black people so they can take control
of the life, politics, and the destiny of the black community.
It was organized by BOBBY GEORGE SALE, BPP Chairman, and HUEY
P, NEWTON, BPP Minister of Defense, NEWTON is presently serving
a gentence of 2 to 15 years on a conviction of manslaughter in
connection with the killing of an Oakland police officer.

The official newspaper, "The Black Panther," which further
describes itself as the "Black Community News Service," states
that the BPP advocates the use of guns and guerrilla tactics
in its revolutionary program to end oppression of the black
| people. Residents of the black community are urged to arm
themselves against the police who are consistently referred to
in the publication as "pigs" who should be killed.

"The Black Panther" issue of September 7, 1968, contains
an editorial by BPP Minister of Education, GEORGE MASON. MURRAY,
‘which ends with the following:

"Black men. Black people, colored persons of America,
revolt everywhere; Arm yourselves, The only culture worth keeping
is a revolutionary culture. Change. Freedom everywhere.

Dynamite: Black Power. Use the gun, Kill the pigs everywhere."

Included in the introduction to an article appearing
in the Cctober 5, 1968, edition of "The Black Panther" is the
statement,”.....we will not dissent from American Government.
We will overthrow it."

Issues of "The Black Panther” regularly contain

| i quotations from the. writings of Chairman MAO Tse-tung of the
i People's Republic of China and feature MAO's statement that
: "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun,”

The national headquarters of the BPP is located at
3106 Shattuck Avenue, Berkeley, California, Branches have been
established at various loéations throughout the United States.

STUDENTS FOR A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY

A source has advised that the Students for a
Democratic Society (SDS), as it is known today, came into
being at a founding convention held at Port Huron, Michigan,
in June, 1962. From an initial ideological posture of
“participatory democracy," the current line of the national
leadership reveals an adherence to Marxism-Leninism.

MICHAEL KLONSKY, National Secretary, in March, 1969, called
for the building of a revolutionary Marxist-Leninist movement.
The program of SDS has moved from involvement in civil rights
struggles to an anti-Vietnam war position and finally to

its present advocacy of an anti-~imperialist line, linking

up the oppressed peoples of Asia, Africa and Latin America
with the black liberation movement in the United States.
China, Vietnam and Cuba are regarded as countries which are
leading the world-wide struggles against United States imperial-
ism. On the other hand, SDS regards the Soviet Union as

an imperialist power and does not support the polices of

that country.

SDS maintains a National Office in Room 206, 1608
West Madison Street, Chicago, Illinois. Its official paper
"New Left Notes" reflects the line of the national leadership
and program adopted at meetings of the National Council and
National Interim Committee (NIC). Three national officers
and a NiC of eleven members are elected each year during a
June National Convention.

SDS Regional Offices and university and college

‘chapters elect delegates to National Council meetings wherein

program and ideology are debated, but each Region and chapter
is autonomous in nature and is free to carry out independent
policy and programs reflective of local conditions.

There's a contradiction somewhere. The

So all of you out there who say, well I'll support the

getting killed, and don't think FRED HAMPTON was killed

“tsa8 a black man and any person like him who understands the

he’s out to systematically wipe out all. black people. He is
systematically out here tawipe out all the black people, Next
he'll wipe out the oppressed people. Then what will be left.

We look at the. JONES... We got a whole load of comedians here.

i remember a speech Chairman FRED gave once before at a rally.



Some fools in the audience wanted to make a joke at

RONALD SATCHEL; our Deputy Minister of Health. They ‘had

-a whole lot of little funny people in the audience that
“had to laugh. Chairman FRED reminded them that there's

_ nothing funny about the situations going on. We had a whole

lot of funny (no sound on tape for a couple of seconds).....

“This is what ye call cutural nationalism. We got a

along with “Doc”-worked to establisli a Eree Peo-

try to teach cach and every member of the Black
Panther Party and the masses what is to be done,
and the proper road towards liberation, freedom,
and strategic means of resisting the power structure.

Fred taught us so much and gave us everything, in-

power to determine our own dastiny and everything
in our Ten Point Program, our major political ob-

The Black Pantt® Party beaan as a resnons@@to reneated instances
of nolice violence in the black community. The narty was iaspired by
the Black Panther Party of Lowndes Countv Alabama (The Lowndes County
Freedom Oranization) which orqanized black heonle in the South to ob-
tain basic rights such as the ribht to vote. The symbol of the Lowndes
County Freedom Nraanization was the Black Panther.

The black nanther, as exnlainad bv Minister of Defense Huey P. New-
ton, ts an animal who will not attack. If attacked, the black nanther
backs un until fe has no more room to back. Then, the black nanther
will. strtke out at his assailant and wine him out. Newton says that the
Biack Panther Party will not attack unless nushed un against the wall-
where nothing else is possibile but to attack its assailants ~ in order
to live. This princinie of armed self-defense which 1s basic to the
Black Panther Party, will be exnlained in a document below.

The Black Panther Party, started by Huey Newton and Bobby Seale
while students at Merritt College in Qakland, set out ordainally to le-
gaily natrol the police. They carried weapons as nrovided by law and
stayed the lenal distance from the nolice whom they watched. The result
of this surveillance was a decrease in brutality against members of th:
black community and increased harrassment of the Black Panther Party

The leaders of the Black Panther Party (originally called the Black
Panther Party for Self Defense) soon realized that the police did not
make the ulfimate decisions as to whom they attacked and why. The no-
‘lie acted as the law enforcement aacncy for those who made the noliti-
cal decisions. Thus, the Black Panther Party evolved a nolitical proqy
to deal with the tyne of political decisions which allowed the nolice
to Barrass the black communities and which have resulted in the dreadfu\
living conditions of black neonle in this country. .(Details of thés
preqram may be found in a document below).

Huey Newton Aas said that the Black Panther Party is the vanauard
narty o? the mass of black peonle. The black community has not yet- beer
sufficiently educated to verbalize its demands and to act unon them in
a meaningful way, Bat beacause they know the nature of the onnression
under whteh they suffer, they identify with the Black Panther Party as
the spokesman which articulates their demands. The sunnort for the
Black Panther Party increases daily as the black community witnesses u*
hannens to thease who sneak for them- the intense brutality and harrass °
ment levied agatast the Black Panthers by the nolice- and the refusal
of tha nower structure even to heed the demands of the black community.

in addigion to sunnort for the Black Panther Party from the black
ganaunity lecally, crouns have been set un all over the country. In-

“" The nroqram is usually divided into one section of tan points
entitled "What We Want" and then ten naragranhs explaining these
points in a section entitled "Khat We Believe". For the sake of
clarity, we have put each one of the ten noints in "Nhat We Want" *
immediately above its corresponding naraqranh in "What We Believe":

1. We-want freedom. We want nower to determine the destiny of
our Black Community.

We believe that black peonle will not be free until we are able
| to determine cur destiny.

2, We want full employment for our neonle.

We-beTieve that the federal government is responsible aad obligate
to-qive every man emnloyment or a guaranteed ‘income. We beliege &gxk
that if the white American businessmen will not qive full employment,
then the means of nroduction should be taken from the businessmen

We believe that if the wnite Tandlords will not give decent
housing to our black community, then the housing and the land should
be made into cooneratives so that our community, with government aid,
can build and make decent housing for its neonle.

5. We want education for our neonie that exnoses the true nature’
of this decadent American soci fety. We want education that teaches us
our true history an and our role in tha nresent day “society.

We believe in an educational system that will aive to our neontle

.We believe that black neonle should not be forced to fight in the

+ POLITICS AND THE BLACK COMMUNITY

_The Black Panther Party nrogram and platform is a result of the an-
alysis that the Party, and esnecially its leader, Huey Newton, has made
of the nature of politics in America. i
The way to volitical chanae is through nower. This is the nature’
of the black nower movement exemnlified by Stokeley Carmichael in that
term. What does this meadn? Huev Newton has said that politics is-
war without bloodshed and that war is an extension of politics with
bloodshed, The reason that the Reconstruction attemnt to put blacks
into office from the South failed was because the black legislators,
intelligent, well-educated men, had no nowerful constituency behind
them. If you represent a powerless aroun in the legislature, then you
wield no nower. What is a nowerful aroun? According to Minister of
Defense, Newton, a nowerful groun is one which, if it doesn't get
what it wants, can deliver a consequence. There are several ways in
which this kind of power is obtained. ne way is to own the land.
This is feudal power. It is exercised by farmers who, when they do
not get what they want, can jet-the crops rot in the field, This is
the kind of consequence that rates attention and action. Yhe second
way of gaining power is economic: ownership of the businesses. In
America the slaves were freed with the promise, by the Freedmen's
Bureau, of forty acres and two mules. Had this nromise been fulfilled,
the black man would have had Jand power and the ability to inflict a-
a consequence. The promise, of course, was never fulfilled: :

What about businesses? The businesses in the black community are
owned by the white man, Thus, even the economic boycott is difficult
because there are not sufficient black-owned businesses to serve as
and alternative center for purchasing basic needed goods. ~ oa

To ask the blacks to redress their qrievances by running for
office does not pose a realistic solution. It is true that members .
of the Black Panther Party - Huey Newton for Congress in the 7th
Conaressional District - Bobby Seale for Assembly in the 17th As-
sembly District in Alameda County - and Kathleen LCleaver for As-
sembly in th 18th Assembly District in San Francisco - are running
for office on the Peace and Freedom Party ticket, but this is only
to have a forum to articulate the qrievances of the black community.
Why? Because as stated above-the black nolitician without a power-
ful constituency just warms a chair in the leoisTature.

If the black community cannot aain economic or Tand-nower, how
can they hone to have changes of their conditions? Hinister of
Defense Huey Newton says that the onlv ather source of power left is
that of the ability to inflict destruction as a consequence. , Thus,
the black neonle must arm in a political fashion. The black people
must be able to deal with the occunation nolice forces in their
communities when they are attacked. The alternative is to have the
police chosen by the black community, live in the black community,
and serve the needs of the black community as that community sees
them, This would mean that the police would no longer act merely to
defend the interests of the white businessman and siumlord.

However, the blacks do not Jimit themselves to discussion of power

- Tt would like.to see eWctad for.the benefit of BMMck neoplé. See

below for the program.

WHAT IS THE STATUS 9F THE BLACK MAN IN ANERICA TODAY?

Eldridge Cleavar, 8fack Panther: Hinister of Infurmation has stated
that the black man is a colonial subject and that black America is a
colony within white America. The fact that the colonial subjects are
disnersed throughout the country does not make their colonial sub~
jugation any the less real. Cleaver has stated that: "Black people
in North America have always been nlagues by a dual status. We were

both slave and Christian, we were both free and searegated, we are
both integrated and colonized. In the nast this duality has worked
to our disadvantage. It kent us running around in circles. Today
we propose to turn it to our advantage, in the manner that we have
turned our blackness from a disadvantage into a rallying ngint of
advantage." ,

Huey Newton has said that the black men in America today is a
man of confusion. He is of the lower socio-economic backqround. He
has withdrawn from his hostile enviroment which he daily faces and
danies his own ability. He has been taught that he is inferior and
he blames himself. He tries to change this image through his style
of life - his desire for flashy material nossessions. He is asked
to resnect a law which does not resnect him. Those who believe in
cultural nationalism try to answer his nroblem by turning him back
te the time of the eleventh century in Africa. However, his free-
dom cannot come from such an identification. His freedom will come
from identifying with the revolutionary struqqles-of neonle cf color
ali over the wortd, including Africa today. The black man, accord-
ing to’ Cleaver, has a common culture and a common history. All she
jacks to be a nation is land.

What is the History of the Black Man_in America?

The history of che present avcitude of the whites toward blacks
jin this country has deep psychological roots, according to Newton.

It dates to the time, hundreds of years ano, when the white Europeans
first came into contact with black Africans. It relates to cultural
differences. The Europeans whe came to Africa worshipped cre god -

a god who was all-good. This was his absolutism. Man was said to
have been created in the image of the all-qood godc and therefore could
do no evil. Man's instinctual sexual drives were deemed ungod-like
and were repressed. Such evil was deemed to come om cutside man-
the resuit cf demons, devils, and witches - who were burned at the
stake. -
On the other hand, the Africans below the Sahara, mostty black,
had.a differant form of worshin. Their aod was both good and bad.
They believed in dualism. Their god had two or more heads - one good
and one bad. The African had to avoid being like the-bad head and
must get into the Savor of the good head. However, he did not deny
part of hig being as comina from outside himself. Thus, his sexual
drives were part cf him - not evil demons from the outside.

When the Euroneans caine to Africa they enslaved the blacks south
of the Sahara who believed in dualism. They were told by the church
that the "“qood" Africans north of the Sahara, who believed in a single
qod, were more in iine with the. Burenean belief and should not be
enslaved. .

+. *. Newtion noints o that this sick mantalitygmoes deener than an
economic system.- It- a psychology that must bW rooted out of the white.
HBGALEXXXE race before the dlacks can live in a society with white
aponle. Thus, when Stok kely Carmichael said that socialism is not
meant for black neonle, he did not mean that he annroved of what the
capitalist system of economics was doing to the black communities,
What he was saying is that even with an’ economic system that provided
for all the neonle, if there were still racism, the back man would
not be able to live as aman,

The Europeans raned Africa economically and took the black men as
slaves to America. The black man has, to this day, not been treated
as an equal to the white man ~ in any way. As was nointed out above,
even after the Emancination Proclamation the black man was not given
his economic and nolitical rights. In fact, after Reconstruction,
the Southern noliticians convinced the Northern noliticians that the
Black legislators 9who bad insianificant rower anyway) vheutd not
maintain even that token status. And, as can be seen in the electoral
struaqdies qofn on in black communities in the South today - the no-
liticians stil] won't even allow the token renpresentationl

As dames Baldwin said, ".To be black and conscious in America is
to be in a constant state of rage." The whites cannot know what -
it is like to live as a black man in America - in white society. What
we can know is the nature of the conditions that must be changed to
give the black man his Tong overdue human rights.

: WHY FREE HUEY NEWTON?
1. The Political Reasons. Huey P. Newton is a political prisoner.
He is in jail today, accused of killing an Oakland noliceman, not
because he committed this crime, which he did not, but because he is
the Minister of Defense of the Black Panther Party. Since the incep-.
tion of the Party the Oakland police have tried to harrass it out
of existence. fs the Party became stronger, the nolice tactics became
more vicious. The police have long had the license numbers and des-
criptions of ali the cars driven by members of the Black Panther Party.
Gn the nignt of October 28, 1967, Police Officer Frey stinned

an automobile which he knew to be a car on the list of those driven :
by Black Panthers. He stopred the car for an alleged traffic violation,’
the nature of which has never been discloes. In his testimony before
the Grand Jury, Officer Heanes, the police officer who wast summoned
by. Frey to come to his assistance after he stonned the Panther car,
said that Newton DID HOT HAVE A GUN. Attorney Charles Garry has in-
dieated that the evidence noints to the real rossibility that both
officers fired at each other and the %fficer Heanes' bullets killed
Officer Frey.

- The nolice have aiways, in the black community, claimed the right
to exercise indiscriminate vidlence. It was for this reason that
the Black Panther Party was oriainally formed. Before October 28th
the Oakland nolice had harrassed Newton on numerous occasions and
had threatened his life. Qn October 28 Newton was arrested and shot
in the stomach because he stood for change in the black community.

_ Tne black community knows that Huey fiewton and the Panthers have
raised a crucdal issue - control of black communities by black
neonie. They recognize that ft is the hbolice who nernetrate violence
on a daily basis in order to maintain their illegitimate control over

stitute leqitimate sel@Pefense anainst apolice f@:e sore interested
jin nolitical renression and "keening the niaqers in their nmlace" than
in catching criminals. And they recognize the indictment of Huey
Newton as an attempt not only to wine out an heroic black resistance
Jeader, but to also intimidate and crush the movement for self-
determination for all black neonlo, If black nolitical leaders are
not actually assassinated, as were Nedaar Evers, Malcoim X, Martina
Luther Kina - then the covernment finds ways of confining and neué
tralizing them as in the cases af H.Ran Brown and Lexoi Jones. That
is'why the black community stands behind the concent FREE HUEY. They
mean that Huey Newton was harrassed and threatened and finally shot
because he is a nolitical leader: that he was arrested and thrown
in jail because he is a nolitical leader, that he faces the aas chamber
because he is a nolitical lea¢er. These are imnortant noints for the
white as well as the black community. The same tyne of harrassment
has taken nlace against whites whe have onnoeed this government: the
case of the Oakland 7 arrested on consniracy to commit a misdemeanor:

a felony. It has happened to those who very neacefully tried to nro--
test the nolicies renresented by Dean Rusk, when he anneared at éhe
Fairmount Hotel - demonstrators who were kicked, beaten and BACCO by
the S$. F. police while they were RUNNING AWAY - trying to follow orders
to disnerse. The list could go on endlessly. Protest the govarnment-
and risk your physical safety - that is the message to whites and
blacks alike. : :

11. The Legal Reasons. Huey Newton was indicted by the Alameda
County Grand Jury - a jury chosen by the 20 judges on the Alameda
County Superior Court, arbitrarily: Judge Dieden, and others, ‘have
admitted that Bhis system results in judges choosing their friends, ~--
oy nolitical camnaign contributors to serve on th$s “honorary”
oosition. Three volumes of hearings taken by the Assembly Committee
on Governmental Efficiency last year (1967) have naqes of testimony
to this effect. The nersons chosen to serve are, overwhelminaly,
white, over 50, retired, or still-active business and professional men
and their wives.

This method of selection is clearly contrary to many cases de-
cided by the United States Supreme Court, which cases indicated that---
a jury of one's neers had to consist of a CROSS-SECTION of the con- :
cunity and could not SYSTEMATICALLY EXCLUDE black neenle from serving.-
The Grand Jury vidlated both of these fundamental nrincinles. How-
ever, when Newton's attorneys nresented this evidence to the courts
af California, through the California Sunveme court, they’ were
dénied redress - WITHOUT EVEN SO MUCH AS A URITTEN OPTHION exnlaining
why. ua .

Furthermore, the method of indictment denied Newton fundamental
-vights which the California Supreme Cours has heid are required in
criminal cases and which are given in the Preliminary Hearing.

A district attorney in California may proceed in a felong case
“ither by thdictment or by information. Indictment is a procedure
whereby the D. A. asks the county grand jury to return an indictment ~__
on evidence presented to them by the D. A, The O. A. may nresent
whatever evé@dence he chooses at his sole ciscretion. The grand jury
may summon witnesses, but it only dees so very rarely. The defendant
$ not present except if he testifies - and this is usually undesir~
able bacause he waives his 5th amendment rights in doing so. Fur-
thermore, the defendant's attorney is not allowed to be nrasent at.

The way of nroceding - through the arand jury, or by way of
nreliminary hearing ~ is at the sole and arbitrary dis¢retion of the
district attorney. There are no quidelines set down either in the

California Constitution or in the Penal Code to quide his choice.

The district attorney of Alameda County has used the grand
jury very rarely, He used it only in a little over 1% of the cases
in 1966. He testified before the “ssembly Governmental Efficiency
Committee that he like to use it in complicated cases such as those
involving assessor frauds or in cases involving child molestation.
Neither was true in the ilewton case. Others at that hearipy testi-
fied that the arand jury was often used where the district attorney
had a noor case or didn't have enough facts to withstand exnosure to
the nreliminary hearing. This was true in the Newton case. To this
date the prosecution has released no information as ta its version

of the Hewten events. This runds counter to its usual procedure

of seeking maximum nublicity to nrejudice the defense case in a
serious criminal matter (cf. the Hutton case). The reason? They . .
haven't made un their story vet. They are honing that the defense
attorneys will let slin therir version of the case so that the D.A.

can then fit his version to counter that one. 7
7 The Grand Jury for the last five or more years has NOT ONCE re-
fused an indictment souaht by the District Attorney. How can any
defendant in a set-un like that have any chanae? .

The Grand Jury indictment also, serves to nrejudice the later
jury because they have the aura of unstandkina citizens. If they
felt the defendant was nrobably guilty, what will the petit jury nave
to think?

1i1. Treatment at Kaiser. When Huey Newton arrived at Kaiser Hos-
nital he was tn aqany from a bullet in his stomach. It took the
emergency room nurse FIFTEEN MINUTES before she would allow him to see
a docter. She.wanted forms filled out. She did not believe he was
really hurt. Finally, accordina to her testimony before the Grand
Jury, Newton threw his blood-soaked shirt at her to convince her of.
his nain.

While Newton was doubled over in nain, and before ahd would let
him see a doctor, the nurse call the police. “hen Newton was finally
allowed to see a doctor, the nolice arrived and nulled his hands over
his head - an agonizing nosition for a man with a bullet in his

stomach ~ and handcuffed him ta the gurney on which he was lying.
They shoved him and kicked the gurney.

When Newton.was transferred to Highland Hasnital, his nolice
auards kicked his bed and shoved him around in tha hopes that they
could nrevent his wound from healing.

HUEY NENTON BIOGRAPHY

ih 1945 and resided in kland Gn 8rush Street, @ attended the Santa
Fe and Lafayette elemencary schools in Oakland. He went to Yoodrow
Wilson Jr. High School and then attended Oakland Technical High.

His childhood was the same as that of most black youths. He was

never given the onnortunity to do skilled work but worked very
diligentiy as a seasonal cannery worker from his araduation from high
school onward. anaes

Huey Newton learned to read well at the ane of 16. This was
when his high school counselors told him he was not colleae material.
He set out to show them that no white man could tell him what he was
canable of doing.

Huey went to Oakland City Colleae and aot an AA degree with an
excellent oradenoint average. He snent one and one-half years in
San Francisco Law School. He left Taw schoo] to oraanize full-time
for black liberation. :

While Huey and Bobby Seales Chairman of the Black Panther Party,
were at Merritt Colleqe thev formec the Black Panther Party for
Self-Defense. Thev natrolled the back community to keep the nolice
from brutalizina the black neonle. Newton and Seale tauaht the blacks
on the block their leaal riahts. They felt that the Panther nro~
aram had to be imnlemented nractically. This meant starting with
Point No. 7 of the Black Panther Party »nroaram to work toward “an
immediase end to nolice brutality and murder of black neonle." 7

Shortly thereafter ysuna Bobby Hutton, inquired about what Bobby
and Huey were doina. They exnlained the idea of the Black Panther ,
Party and its onerations to Bobby Hutton, who then became the first
b¥ack youth to join the Party. He was annointed Party Treasurer.

He served the black community faithfully until his murder at the hands
of the Sakiand nolice on April 6, 1968, : :

: WHY SELF DEFENSE?

The Black Panther Party has advocated that everyone in the black
community have a qun to defend himself. It should be made very clear
that this does NOT mean that black neonle should have quns in order
to come into the white community and "shoot it un". In fact there
are NO reported incidents of Black Panthers coming into ANY community
and using their weapons other than to defend their own lives. ,

The nolice forces in the black community are comnosed of men who |
Jive in white communities. They are hired as occunation forces to
natrol the black community to nrotect white business and land intérests.
This is brought home very clearly by the fact that nolicemenk in the
shetto try to stay away from incidents in which only blacks are in-
yolvec. For examnle, if two black qanaa are rumored to be nlanning
a rumble, the nolice refuse te act to ston it. If black kids are
fjahtina amnna themselves, the nolice stav away. If a black woman
complains to the nolice that her husband has threatened violence
against her. the nolice tell her to call a lawver. When the lawyer
tries to & intervene, the nolice sav they do not like to aet involved
in domestic disnutes. The list noes on endlessly. Furthermore, the
splice are often involved in the local rackets - the numbers oaimes,
rake-offs from done and nrostitution and so forth. However, should
a black man fiaht a white man the nolice come in immediately, At
schools where black and white chiT¢ren fiaht in the schoolyards the
black children are taken off to snend days in Juvenile Hall while

cisco are numerous. In fact it is incidents such as these that have
been the trisaer in almest all the so-called "riots" that have occur-
red in this country since Watts.

The nosition of the Slack Panther Party was aranhically il-
Tustrated when after Martin Luther King's assassination, Bobby Seale,
chai *man of the Party, went around Nakiand in a sound truck urqina

b3ack neonle to stay home and not become involved in violence. hy?
Not because there was no reason for revatt, but because the Black

black reonle and no chanaes in their conditions of life. Such vio-
lence is snoradic, short-lived, and costly. ilowever, it is also very
clear that non-violent tactics have resulted in no channe either.

In fact, before his death, Martin Luther King indicated that the Poor
Peanles' March on Washinaton was his FINAL attemnt to sé non-violent
tactics to aet what his neonle have been deined for 400 years. After
that, Dr. Kina indicated, all he could see was fascism. And he

could not urae neonle to remain non-violent in the face of that.

Why do the Panthers Peléove the Black Community will be Annihilated?

The white community is nrenared for qenocide. Whites all over
this nation are arming themselves to nrotect their community from an -
invasion of blacks. This is so even thouah not one white community
“has yet been invaded or even threatened with such invasion. This is
true even though whites claim that even if there were-an invasion of
blacks they would be beaten almost immediately. Why are they armed?
Fear. Fear that stems from a lack of understandina of the Watts in-
cidents, fear that stems from a lack of understanding of what it is
like to be black in this country. Fear of militancy a% thaxhXaxksx
Khaxxdaxnakxehassexmhaxwkk that asks for chanae NOW, In nart the
fear comes because the whites know that they themselves are nower-
less to get change that would annease the militancy of the blacks,

* They have no more control over their aevernment than do black neonle.

They do not choose who will run for office - that is a back-room
nolitical decision. They know that when they vote for a candidate
they must rely. not on knowledae of bis nosition, but on faith that
he will sovern well. So when they are afraid they do not rety on
their sovernment - they buy guns.

: Not only the white man as an individual is armed. Police de-_
nartments all over this nation are stocknillina weanons which, in
their horror, are matched by those used by the army in Vietnam. Why
the stocknile? For the Second Clivil War. This is the way ‘Esquire
YMaqazine saw it in their March 1968 issue, in an article 6f that title
by Garry Wills. eanorter Wills visited nolice chiefs all over‘the
country to find out what they were nlainnina with reaard to nossible
violence.in the black communities. Remember when you read this’ that
the black neonle are armina for self-defense with auns.

A listing of the weanons being stockniled included: tanks, ar-
mored nersonnel carriers, jeens with hun mounts, command armored cars
built for Vietnam use,cas of all kinds including HACE, now felt by
the federal duu administration to be far more dangerous than tear
gas, bared bayonets, 4-1 rifYes, heliconters, tear gas arenades, shot-
guns, nolice dogs, shock batons, machine auns, assault quns which
shoot through walls. The list could qo on and on.” Some of the more
unusual weanons included “non-lethal” flame-throwers, shound devices

whith cause neonle to release their bowels: or lose their equilibrium,
adhesives which causé narts of the body to stick toaather which if
moved cause larne areas of flesh ta be torn away, foam, invisible
aases, axd odors detectible by dons, nlastic confetti, traquilizers,
electric sluices, hoses, . aaqing nases, and on and on.

This list of veanons is, far too lenathy ane horrifying to be a
mere reaction to black neonies' desire to defend their homes and lives.
This listing of weanons is such as ta wine cut entire areas of a non-t
ulation, such as is beina done in Vietnam. One cannot use tanks and
machine quns, sbund devices, and flame throwers, selectively aqainst
sniners. These weanns either wine out large areas of neonle or they
aren’t used at all.

During all the vast riots the National Guard and the local nolice
shot indiscriminataly at bick neonle. Innocent women and children
were injured as well as neonle only susnectec of lootina. Canital
punishment was extended to those who anneared at the wrona nlace at.
the wrong time. Ho crime at all was necessary. Further rio? con-
tinagency nlans included the request in Detroit for $9,009,000 for
riot equinment. Where sniners are susnected, the article indicated
that entire buildings wer razed to the around, These dead, the article
went on, ane not amonh those Jisted as casualties.

The nsychology of the police interviewed by Wills was that
notential riots must be squelched. This means that nolice patrol
the qhetto and look for "susnicious" activities. Who could blame
| the.nolice for using violence to squelch a notential riot? Anly
those who might question the nature of such activity’in the first
niace and who might question the rinht of an indivicual man with a
gun to nass judqment on another man without benefit for trial. In
Los Anaeles in July of 1967, za ghaz a Black Muslim temple was hk
nock-marked with machine guns. The nolice caaimed that they susnected
that the Temnle was the hiding nlace for ouns. Naturally, the shot
first and asked questions later. The result? No auns found.In this
case, because of widesnread nublicity, Major Yorty was forces to anolo-
nize nublicly for the outraqeous concuct of the nolice. However, such
raids continue reqularly in the black community by the rolice. ' The no-
lice are getting "tough". To quote Cook County Sheriff Wood (Chicago):
"When we had our Maywood riot, I went around telling my men on the
bullhorn, so all those on the street could hear, that any rioter who
raised his hands above his head would be quilty of aggravated assault,
and should be fire on. I also told my men to shoot carefully- we
| didn't have extra men to take wounded off to hosnitals." ‘Comnare this

with what hannened to Denzil Dowell, above, and Bobby Hutton (see below).
A further interesting comnarison was a statement made by Herr Goring,
who issued these “shoot first" orders: ". . .for failure to act is a
qrayver fault that errors made in action."
Ehen the Berkelgy .nolice broke into the home of Panther Chairman
- Bobby Sealé at 3:30 am on phoney charaes of conspiraey to commit
murder - charges that the nolice could never substantiate enough
even to nress - Huey P,. Newten issued Mandate No. 3:

Takina notice of the fact that (1) on danuary 16, 1968, at 3:30am,
members of tke San Francisco Pnlice Dent. kicked dewn the door
and made an illeaal entry, and search of the home of Eldridne
Cleaver, & Minister of Information. These Piss had no saarch
warrant, no arrest warrant, and were therefore not authorized to
enter. They were not invited in. Permission for them to enter
was exnlicityy denied by the Minister of Information. Present
were Sister Kathleen Cleaver, our €ommunications Secretary and
wife to our Minister of Information, anc Brother Emory Douglas,
_ our Revolutionary Artist. :

Taking further notice ef the fact that (2) on February 25, 1968,
several uniformed sestanos of the Berkeley Pia Denartment, ace
commanied by several other white men in nlainclathes, bearing an
assortment of shotauns, rifles, and service revolvers, mate a
forceful, unlawful entry and search of the home of Bobby Seale,
Chairman of our Party, and his wife, Sister Artie Béale. These
P9as had no warrant either to search ar to arrest. When asked
by Rhairman Sobbv. te nraduce a warrant, thev arroaantly stated
that ‘they did not need one. They had no authorttv te

enter - what they did have was the rower of the aun. Thus we
are confronted with a critical situation. Mur araanization has
received serious threats from certain racist elements of White
America, includina the Sakland, Berkeley, and San Francisco Pia
Denartments. Threats tc take our lives, to exterminate us.

We cannot determine when anv of these elements, or a combination
of them, may move to implement these threats. We must be alert.
to the dancer at all times. “e will not fall victim to a St.
Valentine's Massacre. Therefore those who arnroach cur doors in

unlawfully and in a rowdy fashion, those who kick eur doors down
with no authority and seek to ransack our homes in violation of
our HUMAN RIGHTS, will hencefcrth be treated as outlaws, as
qanasters, as evildoers. ‘We have no wav of determining that
aman in uniform involved in a forced outlaw entry into our

home is in fact a Guardian of the Law. He is acting like a
Jawbreaker and we must make an annronriate resnonse.

We draw the line at the threshold of our ccors. It is therefore
mandated as a.neneral order to all members of the LBlack Panther
Party for Self Defense that all members must acquire the tech-

the newsnaners can see what is hanneninn esnecially to the Black Panther
Part in this area (s below for details) must pclude that the very

»"teast that black neonPe must do to continue livine in this country is
to nrotect their persons from attack, As the Black Panthers have said,
it is the man behind the aun who is danmerous. Black Panthers do not
accidentlly shoot each other cr anyone else. If they use weanons it
is when thev are nersonally-attackec. If the whites have already de-
clared war on the black neonle and are forming huce million-dollar
arsenals, what kind of resnonse dco they exnect from the black community?
BaAs Stokeley Carmichael has said, the blacks are not soina to die the
wav the Jews in Eurane died. The Warsaw Chetto Unrisina will be the
examnic to follow - not the quict exodus to the furnaces.

Z Many »eonle object to the noticn of the qun sayina that there are
other wavs to ston violence - that the biacks should qain nolitical and
economic nower. However, as “ill be shovn,below, it makes rower te set
nower. If violence is to be »revented, the whites have the immediate
abliaation to ston the nolice from usina their array of weanans
adainst tha blacks. To ask the blacks to turn the other cheek and
net killed is a nlea that is immoral and fodlish.

THE SACRAMENTO INCIDENT

Because the Black Panther Party has exercised its constitutional
right to bear arms, Assemblyman Mufford deciced that this right
would have to be curbed. He introduced a bill ""rohibitinag instruc-
tion in the use of firearms for the murnose of rioting, and rrohibit- .
ina the carrying of loaded firearms on nublic streets and in nublic
nlaces by all excent neace officers, quards, and members of the armed
forces.” (S. ‘°F. Chronicle Story, 5/3/57). As most necnle know the
sacond amendment to the United States Constitution says that "A well
requlated militia, beina necessary to the security of a free State,
the rinht of the neonle to keen and bear arms shall not be infrinaed..”
The nurnose of this amendment was te nrevent the very thing that
Nulford’s bill tries to set un: the reaulation of the neonle's right
to be free. What is the nature of this riaht? Huey Newton stated it
very clearly when he said that if the neonle are unarmed, and if the
government has a reaular nolice force anc a mili#ary force, the neonle
are slaves to the sovernment or are subiect to slavery at any time.
Newton's conclusion’ se lona as the police are armed, the black neonle
should be armed. As Newton said: "Ninety nercent of the reason we
carried suns in the first lace was educational. We set the examnte.
We made black peonle aware that they have the risht to carry suns."

“hv fo to Sacramento with Cuns?

There is some historv to the Sacramento incident of which most

ngonie are unaware.

; Pn Anvil 1, 1967, a voune black man named Denzil Dowell, aaed

22 vears, was killed by a member of the Contra Costa Sheriff's de-
naytment. .Denzil Powell was killed with his hancs raised over his head,
His familv.was denied the rioht to mhotoaranh his bady and the riaht

to have his clothes returned to them. Denzil Dowell was unarmed.
Furthermore the sheriffs knew that he was sufferina from an unjured

hip which would orevent him from escanina from the scene of the crime.
WHY WAS HE KILLED? fs with the killing of Panther Bobby Hutton see
below) there is no reason - other than that he was black.

On Anvil 18, 1967, the Black Pahther renresentatives, bearina
arms, went to sec District Attorney Nejedly of Contra Costa County: to
ask for an investiaation of Denzil Dowell's death. The District
Attorney said that he would hold such an investisation and would re~

aa On Avril] 19, 1967, renresentatives of the Riack Panthers and some
other interested »ersons met with the sheriff. He refusee to allow the
Panthers to enter his office carrvina suns. Because Panther leader
Huey Newton felt the conference was sa é@mmrortant, he and the other
Panthers save un their ritht to wear a sun and removed the suns
before talkine to the sheriff, .The sheriff refusec to remave the
man who shot Dewell nencdina the investisation. further he refused
to instruct his men not to kill susnects in crimes involvina only
nronertv, {The situation in the Dowell killine). The undersheriff

_ instructed the Panthers that if thev wished chanaes made, the should

ao to Gacramento and sneak to the Lenrislaute. This same undersheriff
Ramsey went to the Assembly and snoke in favor of the Mulford bill -
and in doina so referred srecifically to the need for the bill to
deal with the Black Panthers.

Tn resmonse to this conference and to the Mulford bill itseTt,
Minister of Defense Huey Newton wrote 9 statement which Parither
Chairman Bobby Seale delivered on the stens of the canitol in Sacra-
mento on May 2, 1967. The statement is as follows:

The Black Panther Party for Sclf Defense calls unen the "merican

* neonle in qeneral and the black neonle in articular to take
careful note of the racist California Leaislature which is now
considerina leaislation aimed at keenina the black neonle dis-
armed and nowerless at the very same time that racist nolice
asencies throushout the country are intensifying the terror,
brutality, murder’and renression of black neonle.

At the same time that the American oovernment is waving a racist
war of aenocice in Vietnam, the concentration camrs in which
dananese Americans were interned during Yorld Yar Two are being
renovated and exnanded. Since *merica has historically reserved
the most barbaric treatment for non-white neonle, we are; forced

to conclude that these concentration camns are beina nrenared

for black neonle, who are determined to aain their freedam by

and means necessary. The enslavement of black neonle from the
very beainnina af this country, the aenocide nracticed on the
American Indians and the confinina af the survivors an reserv-
ations, the savase lynchinn of thousands of black men and women,
the dronndnt akxsaxanexkxngnxAaxAkX SAU SAAREXRAXERARKXMARXARH
NAMARAXEREXRRARRX SHR of atomic bombs on Hircshima and Naaasaki,
and now the cowardly massacre in Vietnam, all testify to the fact
that towards neonle of color the racist nower structure of America
has but one nolicy: repression, menocide, terror and the bia stick.

Black neonle have beaqed, nraved, retitioned, demonstrated and |
everythina else to set the racist nower structure of “merica to riaht
the-wronas which have historically been rernetrated aqainst black
neonle, All of these efforts have been answered by more re-
-nression, deceit, and hynocrisy. As the anression cf the
racisé American aovéernment escalates in Vietnam, the nolice
anencies of America escalate the renression of black neonle
throushout the shettos of Smerica. Vicious nolice deas, cattie
prods and increased natrols have beaome familiar siahts in
“black communities. City Hall turns a feaf ear to the nleas
of black peonle for relief from this increasing terror.

to nower in Germ2ny he started exterminatina his nelitical enemies

by nicking on the leacershin (as the Gakland nolice are nickina off
the Teadershin of the Black Ranther Party). He then, when this was
not ‘stonned by nonular outrane and action, went on to kill millions
and millions of those whom he defined as enemies. " government which
can exterminate one groun at will can exterminate many. When Stalin,
in the Soviet Union, felt it necessarv to exterminate enemies, he
tated on a smal] scale. When he found that he could continue this
technique, the nurces became wider and wider in scone, fithoush

Huey Newton feels the concentration camns will be filled with black
neople, those of us who are white and are autraqod at this nossibi-
lity feel that they can be enlarded te include whites, tool emem~
ber that the National Socialist definition of "Jew" was mretty all-
inclusive. IN the South , whites have been referred ta as "white Niager",

‘On Mav2, 1967, the Black Panthers went to Sacramento, carrvina auns
lenaliv. Thev went to the “ssemblg observaticon section led by a .
erew of television men and renorters. “hen they were directed to
the observer box, the Assembly members reauested that the suards re-
move the television cameras, not the suns. The canitol nolice were,
at all times, aware of the fact that the Black Pankhers were armed.

Had the Panthers entered the Assembly with ouns to do any shootine, they
had ammnle onnortunity. However, this was not their murnose. They

came to nrotest the 4Mulford bill, which was wxnlicitly directed anainst
tehm, and to deliver the above-aunted statement of Huey Newton on the
aenocidal nature cf the American csovernment.

Because the Panthers weee leaally carrving auns, they could hot
be arrested while at the canitol. However,.as they were leavina
Sacramento, the nolice duq un an old Fish and Game law that dealt
with loaded weanons in a vehicle. The law was enacted to nrevent
aceidents when hunters carried auns. The Panthers were havinn their
cars serviced ata gas station when the rolice arrested 23 of them
for violation of the Fish and LGame cnde. The Panthers dic not resist
arrest, evén though they were armed and were numerous: After being
arrested, the Panthers were thrown into the drunk tank of the jail
with neither becs nor blankets. They were treated just like the
-animals fer the killing of which reculations were made in the Fish
and Game law.

As Huey Newton nredicted, =the nress resnonse to the incident was
to distart what hannened and to raise the snectre of violence. The
nyess called the Panthers thuns anc indicated that thev came to
Sacramento onlv to disrunt the »raceecinas of the Assembly. How-
ever, as Newton nointed out, -the younn black neonle on the block at

shome -have been called @Boutuns anc thuas all the Drives. Thus, when
they heard what the naners. called the Pasthers they wanted to know

. what these "hoodlums" were un to, carrvina auns. Thus, the Panther

“ messane was snread in the black community almost becausé of the
nress distortions. :

As to nress accounts-calling the Panthers miliant and anti-

white, these were false charnes. he documents below indicate that
the Panthers are not a racist ornanization anc will form coalitions
with white arouns who are willina to sunnort the Panther nlatform
and who will work to end racism.
: The Nulford bill was enacted into law as a snecial bill and nas
been used, nredictably since then, to harrass members of the Black :
Panther Party. Attorneys feel that the bill is clearly unconstitution-
al. However, ‘as will be shown below, Tack of funds, as well as .
the nature of the ccurt system, nrevent the unconstitutionality from
beina adequately tested. Eiaht members of the Black Panther Party
served jail sentences on the nmhoney charse. The rest cid not serve
time because the district attorney indicated that if einht would
serve Z%maxk he would not nress charges against the rest. It should
be noted that this tyne of justice is not limited to the Black Panthers.
Everv dav black neonle are arrested on charnes which are false or
unsubstantiated, Recause of lack of funcs many of them serve jail
sentences, Many of those who can afford attorneys are found auilty
by all-white juries and judaes. Since Sacramento, the Pantbers have
been constantly harrassed. See below for further details.

THE MURDER OF BOCBY-HUTFOH-AND-7HE-ARREST-OF-THE~PANTHER-8

On Sunday, Anri? 7, the Slack Panther Party had olannéd a nicnic
barbecue to raise money for the defense of Huey P. Newton. Saturday
niqht Eldridne Cleaver, Bobby Hutton, and a number of other Panthers
were driving arounc Oakland to collect food that the sisters had
nrenared. Their mission was interrunted when sereral squad.cars of
Oakland nolice intercented and ambushed the Panthers in their own
community. Today, Eldridee Cleaver is behind bars, nossibly for life.
Bobby Hutton is dead - murdered by the Iaklane nins when he tried
to surredder from the sas-filled, burnina house. Seven other Panthers
nius Cleaver face Grand Jury indictments for attemntec murder, in-
dictments based on false information nrovéded bv the nias and ex-
torted confessions from the imnrisoned Panthers. :

The following information came out in an interview a San Francisco
Chronicle renorter had with Cleaver in jail: :
Bobby Hutton, aned 17, was killed by ndGlice bullets - he was
told to run for a squad car and, while his hands were raised and he

was unarmed, officers shot him down.

With one or two exentions, the arsanal of suns the alice claim
was taken from the scene of the shoot-cut was actually taken from a
narked Panther'’s car's locket trunk, miles away, and hours later.

. Following the nolice ambush of the Panthers, cons made nd attemnt
to: immediately allow Cleaver and Hutton out of the house they were
Bolted un in. Instead thev oured a fusillade of bullets in through
its walls. ~ ; :

Eldridae Cleaver was not carryina a sun. "TI was never armed", he
said, "because Huey P. MHewton had laid down orders that, as a naro-
Tee, I should not be armed.”

Although the nias and the racist nress reneatecly tried to call
the ambush a Panther se-un, within two minutes after the nolice had

stonned and mulled their weanons. at 2995 Union street, an entire two-

lice officers had (sunnosedly answering a call for reinfercements}
anneared on the scese, thornunhly equinned with riot helmets,
OVERKILL weanons, tear gas bombs, . .

Cleaver's account of the incident indicated that the trouble
beaan arcund 9:30 n,m. when a squad car nulled alonaside 3 Panther
cars marked on 28th Street. Cleaver saw a con set out of a squad car,
which had suddenlv nulled unr, "heard seme loud talk” from a con “and
suddenly a aun exnloded richt in my face.” Cleaver said he and Bobby
"Tit out" throuch an alleyway and through a side coor inte the basement
of a house that had no connection with the Panthers. "Me laid down
on our backs and the cons started firing. I could see their bullets
coming in throunh a beaverboard nartition abaut a foot above my face.

- concrete foundation of the buildina nartially nrotected them a
it was nrobably a ricochet that later wounded Cleaver. ‘ tear aas
cannister also hit him in the chest. "The cas was thick nsw and
Bobby took off my clothing to see where I was hit. I was bicedina
from my foot and coushina.

Finally a tear sas ee or something else fired by the
nolice set fire to the basement and the side of the house. “Ne couldn*t
stand it anymore and I yelled, "We're comina out".

Cleaver limned out of the house, with Bobby holding his arm to sunnort
him, Out in the alleyway,". . .we both fell down when they (the cans)
told us to and cons from the street (nerhans 15 yards away) an-
nroached us. They kicked us and cursed us for about-five minutes -
while we were lying on the ground." At this time Cleaver was wearina
onty his socks, all his other clothina havina been strinned off

by Bobby in a search for wounds. “Then the cons told us to aet un

and start runnina for the squad car. LCleaver was unable to because
of the lea wound, and he fell. "Bobby started running - he ran bbout”
170 yards - and thev started shoothin him. I heard 12 shots; it

was hard a to tell for sure. He had his hands hich in the air un-

til he died.”

Cleaver was taken to Hiahland Hosrital emeraency room, then
rushed off to San iMuentin, and then, as soon as his lawyer arrived,
was whisked off to Vacaville sunnosedlv for "medical attention",
althouch San IQuentin has seme of the finest medical facilities in
the State nrison system. ‘%t Vacaville, Cleaver has been kent;in
total isolation “maximum security", with his wife and lawyers stven
only curtailed visits, and no other visitors allowed. It was only
the nower of Establishment Press which finally aot the Chronicle
renorter an interview with him.

Exobitantly high bail was set for all the arrested Panthers -
$63,090 for Cleaver (which is irrelevant since his narole was re-
yoked thus automatically. confinina him for the next four years)
and $40,009 each for the other seven. Cleayer's narole was revoked
at 3 a.m. the niaht of fnrtl 7 and there was no hearina,

The L&rand Jury testimony anainst the 9 Panthers who were -
arrested that night, at the scene of the shoot-out, in homes near-
by, oy in their cars, includes alleaed "confessions" by them that they
had been out "lookina ta do some shooting” and other statements.

All such statements are difficult or imnossible te believe would
have been voluntarily qiven by any Black Panther arrested for shoot-
ina at cons. As in the fewton case, the frand Jury was blatantly
employed to deny the defendants their rioht to a nreliminary hear-

7 &ttornev LCharles 8. IGarrv has filed affidavits ef the Panthers
arrested in a suit anainst the Citv of Oakland, the Chief of Police
and the Mavor of Nakland, seekina to enioin the DA from any further
nrasecutions of the Panthers. The affidavits charaed brutalization of
the Panthers bv the nolice, Intimidation and lying. Some Panthers
did make brief statements to a man they were told was their lawver,
who had been brought in “because farrv-and other Panther attornevs

“had no interest in the case" (a commlere fabrication). The"lawyer”
turned out later to be a con. Another Panther was eaten on the soles
of his feet until he made a statement. ® third Panther said he

“had never made any statement to the nolice at all, and that it was
nure Ties on their nart when they attributed statements to him. The
commlete statements in the affidavits indicate that the can harrass-
ment and brutalization were desianed to(1) “confuse and deceive each
of the brothers and turn them against cach other and on Eldridae
Cleaver by blatantly lying to them: (2) to net statements from
them which would build un as much evidence aadinst Eldridae Cleaver
as nossibée." :

This actions of the nolice in attemmting to extort these con-
fessions makes it quite clear that their tarvet was the leacershin
of the Panthers - in this case, Eldridae Cleaver. Like most elements.
of ‘the nower structure they are workina on, the assummtion that if you gap
can destroy the leadershin you can crinnle the movement. As usual, .
they failed to see the extent to which the struaale in the black com-
munitv srows- out of the needs of that entire community. Q%nnression
in the black community is not coine to be sone or fornotten when
the leaders of the Black Panther Party are jailed or shot. The
neonle are not soina to ston finhtina.

On Sunday, Anril 7, several hundred neonle turned out in De-
Fremery Park at a the barbecue nicnic for the Huey P. Newton De=
fense Fund.

The Party School opens ttday and I wish

I would like to say something abcut the
syle of work,

Why must there be a revolutionary party? There must be a reve-
ationary party because the world contains enemies who oppress the
zople and the people want to throw off enemy oppression. #In the
va of capitalism and imperialism, just such a revolutionary party
s the Communist Party is needed, Without such a party it is simply
mpessigle fer the people to throw eff enemy oppression, We are
‘sumunists, we want to lead the people in overthrowing the enemy, ond
9 we must keep our ranks in gocd order, we must march in step, our
JvOOpS must be picked troops and our weapons gvod weapons,
itheut these conditions the enemy cannot be overthrown,

What is the problem now facing our Party? The general line of xi
“the Party is correct and presents no problem, and the Party‘s
work has been fruitful, The Party has several hundred thousand
mambers who are leading the people in extremely hard and bitter
struggles against the eneny, This is plain to everybody and
beyond all doubt,

Then is there or is there not any problem still facing our
Party? I say there is and, in a certain sense, the problem is
quite serious, : : OanBED

ZaWhat is the problem? It is the fact that there is some- .
thing in the minds ef @ number of our ccmraces which strikes ene
as not quite right, not quite proper,

In other words, there is still something wrong with sur style
of study, with our style in the Party's internal and external
relations and with cur style of writing. By something wrong with
the style of study we mean the malady of subjectivism, By scome-
thing wrong eats eur atyle in Party relations we mean the malady
of sectarianisi By something wrong with the style of writing
wez mean the palady of stereotyped Party writing, All these are
wrang, they are ill winds, but they are not like the wintry nerth
winds that sweep across the whele sky, Subjectivism, sectarianism
and stereotyped Party writing are no longer the dcinant styles,
but merely gusts of contrary wind, ill winds fron @ nir-raid
tunnels, It is bad, however, that such winds should still be
blowing in the Party. We must seal eff the passages which pro-
duce them. Our whole Party should undertake the job of sealing
off these passages, and so should the Party School. These three
ill winds, subjectivism, sectarianism and -stereo-typed Party
writing, have their historical crigins, Although no longer
dominant in the whsle Party, they still constantly create trouble
and assail us, Therefore, it is necessary to resist them and to
study, analyse, and elucidate them,

Fight Sub jectivism in order ts rectify the style of study,
fight sectarianism in order to rectify the style in Party rela-~
tions, and fight Party stereotypss in order to rectify the style
of writing--such is’ the task ‘before. us,

fo accomplish the task sf overthrowing the enemy, we must
accomplish the task of rectifying these styles within the Party,
The style of study and the style of weiting are also the Party's
‘style of work, Once our Party’s style of work is put cemyletely
right, the people a1] cver the country will learn from our exam-
ple,axui xxvxunx Thee outside the Party who have the samie kind of”
bad style will, if they are-goxod and honest pecvle. lesen fram ron

I cropose that we should reform the methed ari the system of study throughout
‘.e Party. The Feasons are. as f ollowss

I.

The twenty years of the Communist’ Party of China have been’twenty years in vhich
“he universa] truth of Marxism-Leninism has become more and more integrated with the
sonerete practice of the Chinese revolution. If we recall how’ superficial end meager
wr understanding of Marxism-Leninism and of the Chinese revolution was during our
arty?s infdney, we can pee how much deeper and richer it is now. For a hundred
ears, thé finest songs and daughters of the disaster~ridden Chinese nation fought”
wnd sacrificed their lifes, one stepping into the breach as another fell, in quest
f the truth that would save the country and the people. This moves us to song and
gars But it was only after World War I and the October Revolution in Russia that

‘nese shortcomings, we shall not, in my opinion, be able to take another step forwar.

nm our work and in our great cause of integrating the universal truth of Marxism-
2ninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution.

First, take the study of current conditionse We have achieved some success in
ur study of present demestic and international donditicns, Lut for such a large
litical party as ours, the material we have collected is fragmentary and our re-
‘earch work insystematic on each and every aspect of these subjects, whether it be
ae political, military, econcmic or cultural aspect. Generally speaking, in the
ast twenty years, we have not done systematic and therough work in collecting ‘and
-udying material on these aspects, and we are lacking in a climate of investigation
nd study of objective reality. To behave like “a blindfolded man c3’ ‘tching sParrows?
> a “blind mn groping for fish," to be érude and careless, to indulge in verbiage,
_> rest content with a smattering of knowledge-~such is the extremly bad styie of
cork, that stil? exists among many comrades in our Party, a style utterly opposed to
he fundamental. spirit of Marxism-Leninism. Marx, Engels, Lenin’and Stalin have
caught us that it is necessary to study conditions conscientiously ard to preceed
rom objective reality and not from subjective wishes; but many of cur comrades act
<n direct violatisn of this truth.

Secund, take the study of history. Although a few Party memboxs and sympathiz-
[ts have undertaken this work, it has not been done in an orgsut. ways Many Party
-embers are stil]. in a fog about: Chinese history, whether of the last hundred years
oe of ancient times. There are many Marxist~Leninist schtlars whe cannct open their
.ouths without citing ancient Greece; but.as for their own ancestcrs--sorry, they
ave been forgotten. ‘There is no climate of serious study either of current condi-
tons or of past historye

ina order to explain this idea fecthur, I sheeld like “o contrast two oppesite
Atudes. 7

First. there is the subjectivist attitude. With th's attitude, a person dees
xe a systematic ar ard thorough study of of the environment, but works by sheer sub~
enthusiasm and has a blurred picture of the face of China todays Wi
avbitude, he chops up history, knows only ancient Greece but not China and
fog abous the China of yesterday and the day before yesterday. With this attitude
a person studies Marxist-Leninist theory in the abstract and without any aim. He
goes to Marx, Eng2ls, Lenin and Stalin not to seek the stand, viewpoint and method
with witich to solve the theorstical and tactical problems of the Chinese re i
but to study theory purely for theory's sake. He does not shoot the arrow at the
targét but shoots at random. Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin have taught us that we
should proceed from objective realities and that we shoiild derive laws from them to
serve as our guideto actions For this purpese:we shou tld, as Marx has said,
pelate the matcrial. in detail and subject it to scientific analysis and syirthesis..
Many of our people do not act in this way but do the opposite. A good mmber of them
are doing research work but have no interest in studying either the China of today
or the China of yésterday and confine their interest t6 the study of- apty theories"
divorced from reality. Many others are doing practical ior’, byit they too pay no
attention to the study of objéctive conditions, often rely on sheer enthusiasm and
substitute their personal feelings for policy. Bdth kinds of people, relying on the
subjective, ignore the existence of objective resiities. When making speeches, they
iwige in a long strifig of headings, A, B, C, D, 1, 2, 3, 4, and when writing arti--
2108, they tuin out a lot of verbiage. They Have no intention of seeking truth from
facts, but onTy a desire té curry favour by claptrap. They are flashy without sub-
stance, brittle without solidity. ‘They are always right, they are the Mumer Oiie
anthority under Heaven, imperial envoys” who rush everywhere. Such is the Style of
work of some comrades in our ranks.e To govern one’s own conduct by this style is to,
“cneself, to teach it to others is to harm others; and to use it to direct the
olution is to harm the revolution. To sum up, this subjectivist method which * is
contrary to science and Marcism-Leninism is a formidable enemy of the Communic
Party, the working class, th opile and the nations it is a manifestation cf impur—
in Party spirit. A for le enemy stands before us, and we must overthrow
overthrewn can the truth of Marxism-Leninism prevail,

h

hime. Only when subjectivism
can Party spirit be strengthened, can the revolution be victorious. We mist assert
that the absence of a scientific attitude, that is, the absence of the Marxist-
Leninist approach of uniting theory end practice, means that Party spirit is eithor
absent or deficient.

Secondly, there is the Marxist-Leninist attitude. With this attitude, a person
applies the theory and method of Marxism-Leninism to the systematic and Ahorough
investigation and study of the environment. He does not work by enthusiasm alone,

and march in step, so long as our trocps are picked trosps and

our weapons are good weapons, any enemy, however powerful, car

Let me speak now about subjectivism.

Subjectivism is an improper style of study; it is opposed ts
Marxism-Leninism and is imcompatible with the Commmist Paxty,
What we want is the Marxist-Leninist syle of study. What we call

style of study means not just style of study in the schools but
in the wheld Party, It is a question of the method cf thinking
of comrades in our leading bodies, of all cadres and Party men-
bers, a question of our attitude towards Marxism-Lenigism, of
the attitude of all Party comrades in their work. As such, it
is a question of extraordinary, indeed of primary, importance,

Certain muddled ideas find currency among many pexple. There
are, for instance, muddled ideas about what is a theorist, what
is an intellectual and what is meant by linking theory and prac-
tice,

Let us first ask, is the theoretical level of our Party high
er low? Recently more Marxist Lenist works have been translated
and move people have been reading them, That is a very good
thing. But can we therefore a say that the theoretical level of
cur Party has been greatly raised? True, the level is now some-
what higher than before. But our theoretical front is very much
out of harmony with the rich-content of the Chinese revolutionary
movement, and a comparison of the twe shows that the theoretical
side is lagging far behind, Generally speaking, our theory can-
not as yet keep pace with our revolutionary practice, let alone
lead the way as it should, We have not yet raised our rich and
yaued practice to the preper theoretical plane. We have not, yet
exmined all the proplems of revalutionary practice--or even the
important ones--and raised them to a theoretical plane, Just
think, hew many of us have creatéd theories worthy of the name
on China’s economics, politics, military affairs or culture,

~ theories which can be regarded as: scientific and comprehensive,

and not crude and sxetchy? Especially in the field of economic
theory: Chinese capitalism has had a century of development
since the opium War, and yet not a single theoretical work haa
been preduced which accords. with the realities of China‘s econ~
onic problems, for instance, the theoretical level is already
‘high? Can we say that cur Pabty kus already has ecotiomic theort
ists werthy of the name? Certainly not. We have read a great.
many Marxist-Lenist books, but can we claim, then, thet we have
theorists? We cannot. For Marxism-Lenisism is the theery created

“by Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin on the basis of practice, their

general conclusion drawn from historical ané revolutionary reality,

-If we merely read their works but do not preceed to study the

-vealities of China's history and revolution in the Light of their
theory or do not make any effort th think through China’s revo—
lutionary practice carefully in terms of theory, we should not be
‘so presumptuous as‘to call ourselves Marxist theorists. Our ach-
ieverents om the theoretical front will be very poor indeed if,
as members of the Communist Party of China, we close cur eyes to
China’s preblems and can only.memorize isolated conclusions or
‘principles from Marxist writings, If all 2 person can do is ta
ccmmit Marxist economics or philosophy to memory, reciting glibly
from Chapter I to Chapter X, but is utterly unable to apply them,
can he be considered a Marxist theorist? No! tie cannot, What

sind of theorists do Pwant? We want theorists @. ean, in ace:
cordance with the Marxist-Leninist stand, viewpoint and method,
correctly interpret the practical problems arising in the course
of history and revolution and-give scientific explanations and
theoretical elucidations of China‘s economic, political, military,
cultural and other problems, Such are the theorists we want. To
be a theorist of this kind, a person must have a true grasp of
the essence of Marxism-Leninism, -of the Marxist-Leninist stand,
viewpoint. and method and of the theories of Lenin and Stalin on
the colonial revolution and the Chinese revolution, and he must be
able to apply them in a penetrating and scientific analysis of
China’s practical problems and discover the laws of development
of these problems, Such are the theorists we really need.

The Central Committee of our Party has now made a decision .
calling upon our comrades to learn how to apply the Marxist-
Leninist stand, viewpoint and method in the serious study of
Chinas history, and of China's economics, politics, military
affairs and culture, and to analyse every problem concretely on
the: basis of detailed material and then draw theoretical conclu-
sions, This is the responsitility we must shoulder,

Our comrades in the Party School should not regard Marxist
theory as lifeless dogma. It is necessary to master Marxist the-
ory and apply it, master it for the sole purpose of applying it.
If you can apply the Marxist-Leninist viewpoint. in elucidating
one or two practical problems, you shoule be commended and cre-
aited with some achievement, The more problems you elucidate and
the more comprehensively and profuondly you do so, the greater
will be your achievement, Our Party School should also lay dow
yhr xukx rule to grade students good or poor accoring to how
they look at China's problems after they have studied Marxisn-
Leninism, according to whether or not they see the problems clear-
ly and whether or not they see them at all, :

Next let us talk about the question of the "intellectuals",
Since China is a semi-colonial, semi-feudal country and her cult~
ure is not well developed, intellectuals are particularly treasured
On this question of the intellectuals, the Central Committee of
the. Party made the decision over two years ago that we should win
over the great numbers of intellectuals and, insofar as they are
revolutionary and willing to take part in the resistance to Javan,
welcome them one and all, It is entirely right for us to esteem -
intellectuals, for without revolutionary intellectuals the revo~
lution cannot triumph, But we all know there are many intellec-
tuals thx xx who fancy themselves very learned and assume airs of
evudition without realizing that such airs are bad and harmful
and ‘hinder their own progress, ‘They ought to be aware of the
trugh that actually many so-called intellectuals are, relatively
speaking, most ignorant an&z the workers and peasants sometimes
know more than they do. Here some will say, “Ha! You are turning |
things upside down and talking nonsense,” But, x»uy comrades
don't get excited; there is some sense in what I am saying.

What is Knowledge? Ever since class society came into being
The world has known only two kinds of Imowledge, knowledge of the
struggle for production and lmowledge of the class struggle, :
Natural science and social science are the crystalizations of °>
these two kinds of kneWledge, and philosophy is the « alization
and summation of the knowledge of nature and the know e of
society. Is there. any other kind of knowledge? No, Now let us

his knokledge is still incomplete, What then is relatively

in two stages: The first stage is perceptual knowledge, the

former to a higher level. What sort of knowledge is thw studa

perience, but consists of theories set down by thier precc.ess~
in summarizing experience of the struggle for production and of
the class struggle. It is entirely necessary that students
should acsuire this kind of knowledge, out it must be understood
that as far as they are concerned such knowledge is in a sense s
still one sided, something which has been verified by others but
not yet by themselves, What is most important is to be good at
applying this knowledge in life and in practice, Therefore, I
advise those wha have only booklearning but 2s yet no contact +1
with reality, and also those with little practical experience, to
realize their own short comings and becomé a little more modest,
How can those who have only booklaerning be turned into intel-
lectuals in the true sense? The only way is to get them to take
part in practical work and become practical werkers, to get thoge
engaged in theoretical work to study important practical prebioms,
In this way our wxx aim can be attained,
what I have said will probably make some people angry, They
will say, “According to your explanaticn, even Marx would not be
regarded as an intellectual." TI say they are wrong, Marx took
part in the practice of the revolutionary movement and alsa
created revelutionary theory, Beginning with the commodity, the
simplest element of capitalism, he made a thorough study of the
economic stricture of capitalist society, Millions of peopic saw
and handled commodities every day tat were so used to them that
they took no notice, Marx alone studied commodities sciéntifi-
cally. He carried out a tremendous work of research into their
actual development and derived a nature, history and proletarian
revolution and created dialéctical materialism, hostorical mater-
jalism and the theory of proletarian revolution, Thus Marx became
a most completely developed intellectual, representing the acme of
human"wisdom; he was fundamentally different from those who have
only -book-learning, Marx undertook detailed investigations and
studies in the course of practical struggles, formed generaliza-—
tions and then verified his conclusions by testing them in prac-
tical struggles--this is what we call theoretical work, Tur
Party needs a large number of comrades who will learn now t> do
such work, In eur Party there are many comrades who can learn to
do this kind of theoretical research; most of them are intelligent
ard promising and we should value them, But they must follow
correct principles and not repeat the mistake of the past, They
must discard dogmatisin and not confine themselves to ready-made

So astray, -

However, of the two kinds of subjectivi sm, dogmatism is still
the greater danger in our Party, For dogmatists can easily assume
a Marxist guiée to bluff, capture and make servitors of cadres of
working-class and peasant origin who cannot easily see through
them; they can also bluff and ensnare the naive youth. If we

“overcome dogmatism, cadres with book-learning will readily join

«with those who have experience and will take to the study of
practical things, and then many good cadres who integrate theory
with experience, as well as some real theorists, will oueseee If
we overcome dogmatism, the comrades with practical experie: enc

will have good teachers to help them raise their experience to the
level of theory and so avoid empiricist errors.

Besides muddled ideas about the “theorist” and the “iptellect-
ual”, there is a muddled idea among many comrades about "linking
theory and practice", a phrase they nave on their lips every day,
They talk, constantly about "linking", but actually they mean "se-
parating” » because they make no effort at linking. How is «
Marxis$-Leninist theory to be linked with the practice of ‘the
Chinese revolution? To use a common expression, it is by “shoot-
ing the arrow at the target", As the arrow is to the target, so
is Marxism-Leninism to the Chinese revolution. Some comrades,
however, are “Shooting without a target", shooting at random, and
such people are liable to harm the revolution. Others merely sk
stroke the arrow fondly, exclaiming, “What a fine arrow! What a
fine arrow!," but never want to shoot it, These people are only
connoisseurs of curios and have virtually nothing to do with the
revolution, The arrow of Marxism-Leninism must be used to shoot
at the target of the Chinese revolution, Unless this point is
made clear, the theoretical level of our Party can never be raised
and the Chinese revoltuion can never be victorious,

Onn comrades must understand that we study Marxism-Leninism
not for Gisplay, nor because there is any mystery about it, but
solely because it is the science which leads the revolntionary
Pas of the proletariat to victory, Even now, there are not a

‘aw people who still regard odd quotations from Marxist-Leninist
aes as a ready-made panacea which, once acquired, can easily
cure all maladies, These people show childish ignorance, and
we Should enlighten them, It is precisely such ignorant people
who take Marxism~Leninism as a religious dogma, To them we should
say bluntly, "Your dogma is worthless," Marx, Engels, Lenin and
Stalin have repeatedly stated that our theory is not a dogma but
a guide to action, But such people prefer to forget this ux state
ment which is of the greatest, indeed the utmost, “importance.
Chines? Communists can be regarded as linking theory with practice
only when they become good at applying the Marxist-Leninist stand,
viewpoint and method and the teachings of Lenin and Stalin con-
cerning the Chinese revolution and when, furthermore, through ser-
ious research into the realities of China's history and revolution
they do creative theoretical work to meet China's needs in dix¥fer-
ent spheres, ierely talking about linking theory and practice

“So much for today about combating cubjectivism in order to
rectify the style of study throug hout the party,

Let me now speak about the question of sectarianism,

Having been steeled for twenty years, our Party is no longer
dominated by sectarianism, Remnants of sectarianism, however,
are still found both in the Party’s internal relations and in its
external relations, Sectarian tendencies in internal relations
lead to exclusiveness towards people outside the Party and hinder
inner~Party unity and solidarity, while sectarian tendencies in
external relations lead to exclusivensss towards people outside
the Party and hinder the Party in its task of uniting the whole
people, Only by uprooting this evil in both its aspects can
the Party advance unimpeded in its great task of achieving unity
among all Party comrades and among all the people of our country.

What are the remnants of inner-Party sectarianism? They are
mainly as follows: i :

First, the assertion of “independence”, Some comrades see only °
the interests of the part and not the whole; they always put un-
due stress on that part of the work for which they themselves are
responsible and always wish to subordinate the interests of the
whole to the interests of their own part, They do not understand
the Partys system of democratic centralism; they do not realize
that the Communist Party not only needs democracy but needs cen=
tralization even more, They forget the system of democratic
centralism in which the minority is subordinate to the majokity,
the lower level to the higher level, the part to the whole and
the entire membership to the Central Committee, Chang Kuo-tao
asserted his "independence" of the Central Committee of the
Party and as a result “asserted” himself into betraying the Party
and became a Kuomintang agent, Although the sectarianism we are ©
now discuasing is not of this extremely serious kind, it must
still be guarded against and we must do away completely with all
manifestations of disunity. We should encourage comrades to
take the interests of the whole into account. Every Party mem-
ber, every. branch of work, every statement and every action must
proceed from the interests of the whole Party; it is absolutely
impermissible to ¥iolate this principle,

Those who assert this kind of "independence" are usually wedded
to the doctrine of "me first" and are generally wrong on the ques-
tion of the relationship between the individual and the Party, - Al
though in words they profess respect for the Party, in practice
they put themselves first and the Party second, What are these
people after? They are after fame and position and want to be in
the limelight. Whenever they are put in charge of a branch! of :
work, they assert their “independence”, With this aim, they draw
some people in, push others out and resort to boasting, flattery
and touting among the comrades, thus importing the vulgar style of
the bourgeois political parties into the Communist Party. It is
their dishonesty that causes them to come to grief. I believe
we should do things honestly, for without an honest attitude it is
absolutely impossible to accomplish anything in this world, Which
are the honest Beople? Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin are honest,
men of science are honest. Which are the dishonest people? Trot-
sky, Bukharin, Chen Tu-hsiu and Chang Kuo-tao are extremely dis-
honest; and those who assert "independence" out of personal or
sectional interest are dishonest too, All sly people, all those
who do not have a scientificsattitude in their work, fancy them-

combat sectarian tendencies. Ver; cyreful attention must be given t
the relations ‘between cutdide and local cadres because many anti~
Japanese base areas were established dnly efter the arrival ¢f the
Eighth Route Army or the New Fourth Army and much of the local work
Geveloped only after the arrival of outside cadres,,dur comrates
must unzerstand that in these conditions it 1s possible fcr cur
base aress to be Gén8olidated end for our Party t¢ take raot there
enly when the two kinds of cadres unite aS one and when a large nu
mumber cf local cadres develope and are promoted; otherwise it is
impossible: Both the outside and lecal cadréd have their strong and
weak points, and to make progress they must overcome their weak
points by learning from each others strong points, The cutsite cadx
®K are generally not up yo the lccal cadves in familiarity with loca
conditions and links with the masces., Take me for instance, Althcu
I have been in northern Shens@i 5 or 6 years, I am far behind the 1
local comrades in understanding local canéitions and in links with
the people here, Our comrades going to the anti-Japanese ase areas
in Shensi, Hopei,; Shantung and cther provinces must pay attention
to this, Moreover, even within the same base area,owing to the fact
thet some districts develcp earlier and others later, there is a
difference between the local cadres and xhose from outside it. Cad
res whe come from a more developed to a less develcped district
are also outside cadres in relayion to shat locality , and they,toe
should pay great attention to fostering and helping lccal cadres,
Generally speaking, in places where outside cadres are in charge,
it is they who should bear the main responsibility if their rela+
tions with the local cadres are not goed. And the chief comrades in
charge should bear greater responsiblilty, The ateentisn puid te th
this problem in some places is still very inadequate, Some, people
ioek down on the local cadre and ridicule them, saying “What do the
locals know? Clodhoppersi" Such people utterly fail to understand
the importance of local cadres; they know neither the latters strean ~
points nor their own weaknesses and adopt an incorrect, sectarian
attitude. All outside cadres must cherish the locel cadres and give
them constant help and must not be permitted to ridicule or attack
them, Of course, the local cadres on their part must learn from the
strong points of the outside cadres and rid themselvesK»f inappro-—
priate, nafrow viewsxso that they and the outside cadres becone as
one, with no distinction between “them‘ and 7us',and thus avoid
sectarian tendencies, cap

The same applies to the relationship between cadres in army ser
vice and other cadres working in the locality, They must be complet
completely united and must oppose sectarian tendencies, The army
ccadres must help the local cadres, and vice-versa, If there is
friction between them, each should make allowances for the other
and carry out peoper self-criticism. Generally speaking, iri places
where army“cadre are actually in position of leadership, it is they
who should bear the main responsibility if their relations with the
ieocal cadre are not good, Only when the army cadres understand
their ewn resposibility and are modest in their attitude towards
the lecal cadres can the conditions be created for smooth progress
of our war effort and our work~oft construction in the base areas,

“ The same applies to the relatuonship among different army
units, different localities and different departments,,,, We nust
oppose ghe tendency toward selfish departmentalism by which the
interest of one's own unit are looked after to the exclusion of

onsideration to other departments, localities and people
person is a selfish departmentalist who has entirely lost the spiri
oP communism, Lack of consideration for the whole and complete in-
difference to other departments, localitiesti people are the char
acteristics of aRish departmentalist, We must intensify our efforts
uo educate such people and to make them understand that selfish
cepartmentakism is a sectarian tendency which will become very dan-
gerous,if allowed to develop,
Another problem is the relation between old and new cadres.
Sinee the beginning of the War of Resistance, our Party has grown
enourmously, and large numbers of new cadres have emerged that is
@ very good thing, In his report to the Zighteenth Congress of the
Communist Party of the Soviet Union (B.) Comrade Stalin sSaid,"seuc:
there are never enough old cudres, there are far less than ©. 1+. ,
required, and they are partly going out of commission owing to the
operation of the laws of nature,” Here he was discussing the cadres
situation and not only the laws of nature. If our Party does not
have a great many new cadres working in unity And co-operation with
the old cadres, our cause will come to a stop, All oid cadres,there
fore, should welcome the new ones with the utmost enthusiasm and
show them the warmest solicitude, Trus, new cadres have their short
tomings,,.They have not been long in the revolution and lack experi~
ence, and unaxoidably some have brouhgt with them vestiges of the :
vnwholesome ideology of the old society, remnants of the ideology :
of petty~bourgeouis individualism, But such shortcomings can be
gradually eliminated through education and tempering in the revo~
Lutionk, The strong points of the new cadres, as Stalin said, is -
that they are acutely sensitive to what is new and are therefore -
enthusiastic and active to a high degree--the very quelitkes that
some of the old cadres lack,,Cadres, new and old, should respect
cach other, ,learn from cach other, and overcome their own shortcom
ings by learning from each others strong points, so as to unite as
one in the common cause and guard against sectarian tendencies,
Generally speaking, in places where the old cadres are mainly in
charge, it is they who should bear the chief responsibility if rele
tions with the new cadres are not good,
All the aboverelations between the part and the whole, rela
tions between the individual and the Party, relations between out

Tey RECTIFY oA@Derrcv's SCYLS CP WORK @ Pege. 12
The remnants of sectarianism must be éliminated fron the Party;s
external as well as its internal relations, The regscsa is this: -
we cannot defeat the enemy by merely uniting the comrades through-
cug the Party, we can defeat the enemy only by uniting the people
theroughout the.country. For twenty years the Communist Party
of China has done great and arduous work in the cause of uniting
the people of the whole country, and the achievements in this work
since the outbreak of the War of Resistance are even greater than
in the past, This does not mean, however, athat all our comrades
already have a correct style in dealing with the masses and are
free from sectarian tendencies, No. In fact, sectarian tendencies
still exist among a number of comrades, and in some cases to a
very strions degree, Many of our comrades, tend’ torbecoverbtaring
én their relations with non-Party people, lock down upon them,
despise or refuse to respect them or appreciate their strong points
This is indeed a sectarian tendency. After reading a few Marxist
‘bonks, such comrades become more arrogant instead of more modest,
and invariablg dismiss others as no good withougs realizing that in
fact their own knowledge is only half-baked, Our comrades must
realize the truth that Communist Party members are at all times a
minority as compared with non~Party people, Supposing one out of
every hundred persons were a Communist, then there would be #y¥2 7
4,500,000 Communists among China's population of 450,000,000, Yet i
even if our membership reached this huge figure, Communists would i 7
still form only one per cent of the whole populatizn, while 99%
would be non-Party peaple, What reason can we then have for not
co-eperating with non~Party people? As regards all those who wish
to xm2 xuQ co-operate with us, we have only the duty of co-oper~
ating and abselutely no right to shut them out, But seme Party
members do not understand this and look down upon, or even shut
out, those who wish to co-operate with.us, There are no grounds
‘whatseever for doing so, Have Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin a
given us any grounds? They have not.0n the contrary, they have
always earnestly enjoined us to form close ties with the masses
and not diverce ourselves from them, Or has thé Central Comnittee
ef the Communist Party of China given us any grounds? No, aAnong
all its resolutions there is not a single one that says we ma:
divorce surselves from the masses and so isolate ourselves, Gn
the contrary, the Central Committee has always told us ta form :
close ties with the masses and not to diverce ourselves from-them,
Thus any action divorcing us frem the masses has no justification
at all and is simply the mischievous result of the sectarian ideas
Some of our comrades have themselves concocted, As such sectari-
anism remains very Serious amorig some of our comrades and still
obstructs the application of the Party line, we should carry ant -
extensive education within the Party to moet this prsblem, Above
all, we sheuld make cur cadres really understand how siticus the
preblem is and how utterly impossible itis te overthrow. the 7

There is no “time today to talk about the question of stereo-
typed Party writing: I shall discu&s it at another meeting, . Ster-
edtyped Party writing is a vehicle for filth, a form 6f expression
for’ subjectivism and sectarianism, It does people harm and damages
the revolution, and we must get rid of it. completelyy
, to combat subjectivism we must propagate materialism and dia~
lectics; However, thére are many comrades in our Party who lay

"no stress on the propaganda either of materialism or of dialectics
Some tolerate subjéctivist propaganda and regard it with equanim—
ity... They think they believe in Marxism, but make no effort to
propagate materialism and do not give it a ences or express any
opinion when they hear or read subjectivist stuff, This is not
the attitude of a Communist, It allows many of our comrades to
be poisoned by subjectivist ideas, which numb their sensitivity.
He should therefore launch a campaign of enlightenment withing
the Party to free the minds of our comrades from the fog of sub-~
jectivism and dogmatism and should call upon them to boycott sub-
jéctivism, sectarianism and stereotyped Party writing, Such evils
are like Japanese goods, for only our enemy wishes us to preserve
them and-continue to befuddle “ourselves with thems so we should
advocate a boycott against them, just as we boycott Japanese
goods, We shauld boycott all the wares of subjectivism, sectar-
jianism, and stereotyped Party writing, make their sale difficult,
and not allow their purveyors to ply their trade by exploiting the
low theoretical level in the Party. Our comrades must develop
a‘good nose for this purpose; they should take a sniff at everthing
and disvinguish the good from the bad before they decide whether
to welcome it or boycott it. Communists must always go into the
whys and wherefores of anything, use their own heads and carefully
think over whether or not it corresponds to reality and is really
weil ‘founded; on no account should they follow blindly and encour~"
age ‘slavishness, i f
Finally; in opposing subjectivism,, sectarianism and stereotyped
Party writing we must have in mind two purposes! first, “learn
from past mistakes‘to avoid future ones", end second, "cure the :
Sickness to save the patient", The mistakes of the past must be ~
xposed without sparing anyone's sensitilities; it is necessary ta
analyse and criticize what was bad in the’ past with a scientiv¥ic
attitude’so that work in the future will be done more carefully. i
and'done better,’ This is what is meant by "learn from past mis-—
takes to avoid future ones", But our aim in exposing errors and
oritizing shortcomings, like that of a do¢tor curing a sickness,
is ‘solely to save the patient and not to doctor him to death. A
> person with appendicitis is saved when the surgeon removes ‘his ap-
pendix, So long as a person who has made mistakes joes not hlide
his sickness for fear of treatment or persist in his mistakes until
he ‘is beyond cure, so long as he honestly and sincerely wishes’ to
be cured and to’mend his ways, we should welcome him and cure his
sickness so that he-can become a good comrade, We can never succeed
if we just let ourselves go, one must never be rough and rash but
must adopt the approach of "curing the sickness to save the patient”

| BLACK PANTHER PARTY

According to its official newspaper, the Black Panther
: "party (BPP) was started during December, 1966, in Oakland,
* California, to organize black people su they can take control
.:0f the life, politics, and the destiny of the black community.
’ It was organized by BOBBY GEORGE SLALE, BPP Chairman, and HUEY
’ BP, NEWTON, BPP Minister of Defense, NEWTON is presently serving
a sentence of 2 to 15 years on a conviction of manslaughter in
connection with the killing of an Oakland police officer,

The official newspaper, “The Black Panther,” which further
deseribes liself as the "Black Community News Service," states
that the BPP advocates the use of guns and guerrilla tactics
in its revolutionary program.to end oppression of the black
people, Residents of the black community are urged to arm
themselves against the police who are consistently referred to
in the publication as "pigs" who should be killed.

“The Black Panther” issue of September 7, 1968, contains
an editorial by BPP Minister of kducation, GEORGE MASON MURRAY,
“which ends with the following:

“Black men, Black people, colored persons of America,
revolt everywhere! Arm yourselves. The only culture worth keeping
ig a revolutionary culture. Change, Freedom everywhere,

Dynamite! Black Power, Use the gun. Kill the pigs everywhere."

Included in the introduction to an article appearing

. in the Gctober 5, 1968, edition of "The Black Panther" is the

statement,".....we will not dissent from American Government.
WS will overthrow it."

Issues of "Tne Black Panther" regularly contain
. QUptations from the writings of Chairman MAO Tse-tung of the
People's Republic of China and feature MAQ's statement that
‘political power grows out of the barrel of a gun,”

| -_ The national headquarters of the BPP is located at
3105 Shattuck Avenue, Berkeley, California. Branches have been

Good evening. As uSual the two hours, the
Volare Taylor (phonetic) Trio standing by.
As our guests tonight we did a previous |
taping with the inimitable Mr. ALFRED
HITCHCOCK which we'll hope we’ll have time
to show you in a little while, and (garbled)
tonight we have Miss CARLA THOMAS (phonetic)
great soul singer. She's appearing over at
Mister Kelly's. And we have Mr. DAVE
HILLIARD who is the National Chairman of
the Black Panther Party, Chief of Staff,

Chief of Staff, okay. Chief of Staff. I

“just found out you were coming. Chief of

Staff. Okay. Black Panther Party. We
have Mr, CHARLES GARRY who is the attorney,
for the Panther Party. As you recall Mr.
GARRY was also the attorney for BOBBY SEALE
but unfortunately because of an operation
he couldn't make it into Chicago for Judge

HOFFMAN, and you know the rest of that story,



NW 65360 Docld:32989646 Page 342

but he's here tonight. We have Mr. BOBBY

RUSH who is the Illinois Chairman of the
Black Panther Party. Deputy Minister of
Defense. Okay. I got one out of three.

It's not bad. Miss ARLENE HUGHES (phonetic),
Chicago celebrated psychic. We have Mr.
GEORGE PENECOSTIN (phonetic) and DONALD
CLEMEN (phonetic) tonight who are the stars
of the play dn town called "The Boys in the ,
Band." Mr. MORRIS RENNEK (phonetic), author
of the new book called “Siam Miami" (phonetic)
and SONNY BROWN (phonetic) who represents the
Atlas Galleries and we'll show you too in a
little while some magnificant paintings that
you'll be able to buy in various stores that
are just out of this world and so reasonable.
That's the way the show's set for tonight.

As I said we'll] be here for two hours and

we hope that you'll enjoy, we'll try to make

it as enjoyable as possible for you.

Now then, I was just informed tonight that



NW 65360 Docld:32989646 Page 343

we were very fortunate in getting you to

come up and talk with us tonight.’ All over
the news, of poureete we have the commission
come in from Congress and how they ran up a
brick wall. But tell me this right now,
according to the man from the Yllinois. Civil
Liberties Union, he said that din his conversa-
tions with JERRIS LEONARD, which was summarily
denied, he said that it was Mr. JERRIS- ‘
LEONARD's conversation with him where Mr
LEONARD, I guess, said that they were going
to get the Black Panthers, hoodlums, 7
gangsters, or whatever he. called them,

Of course everything is out of context.

You tell me, would you please Mr. HILLIARD,
you're the Chief of Staff. of the Black
Panther Party. Do vcr believe that the
Justice Department, the United States
Government, its official arm, ‘its law

arm, is out to get the Black Panther Party -

“violently?



DAVE HILLIARD:

FAYE:

HILLIARD:

NW 65360 Docld:32989646 Page 344

How do you say this? We have a documentation

of harassments and murders of our Party
members. that date back to 1968, and the
harassments precedes the year of 1968.

So that with this physical evidence and
with the murders beginning with little
BOBBY HADDEN (phonetic) and some 26 members
of our Party that have been viciously
murdered in our communities, I think that -
this serves as a (garbled) indictment that
the United States Government with all] other
branches and agencies out to destroy the
Black Panther Party with violence.

I want to ask you this please. The Black
Panther Party, are your aims finally, your
final aims to overthrow the United States
Government in its present form?

Our final aim is to realize the system that
would guarantee employment, education, fair
housing, and to give the people the power

to control the so-called representatives



FAYE:

HILLIARD:

NW 65360 Docld:32989646 Page 345

of government and (garbled) system that

we're presently living under now. That's
our final aim. Of course to recognize
socialism as being the one syatem by which
people can control the means of production
in our communities and socialism as a weapon
to allow the people to give full (garbled)
their energies in all areas. But the
ultimacy of our program is all power to
the people--a democratic centralized govern-
ment as outlined in the (garbled) Constitution.
Are you comparing your particular credo
against anotber country or one that's brand
new, one that does not look like any other
country's form of socialism?

First you have to understand that the

ideology and the program of the Black

Panther Party is a program that was put
together from the historical experiences

of black people in this country. But our

situation in this country is a very particular



FAYE:

HILLIARD:

NW 65360 Docld:32989646 Page 346

situation because first of all we're subject
to the most inhumane hostilities up to this
point in history. I think that the Indians
are the only other nationality of people
that had been meted (phonetic) out such
atrocities so that it becomes very important
for people to recognize the Black Panther
Party's program and their legitimate demands
for justice as being the ultimacy of our
program.

Do you believe that the human race as a
whole is capable of warmth, understanding,
kindness, compassion, freedom, honesty to
all people, black, white, yellow, red, no
matter what color of their skin, do you
believe that the human race is capable of
such a society?

I think that with proper information that
the human race can be all those things that
you mentioned but the very fact that the
media, the television as one example, serves

as a tool to distort and to politically



deform individuals so the people cannot get
the right information that's necessary for
them to be the epitome of humanity as you
so describe.

FAYE: I'm smiling at that because here you are,
you're right in the same camp with AGNEW and
because AGNEW says the same thing, that the
media distorts and discolors and, you want

| all media, how you gonna stake (phonetic) — -

the media out, according to whose truths?»
HILLIARD: All that we say is that the service, the
ideological service, people like yourself,
the journalists, that these people should
record facts as they are and not to distort
them. All that we're saying is that the
television cameramen, the journalists,
that their critiques, that their political
essays, that their (garbled) essays for the
Nobel Peace Prize should project the very
realistic situation without distortion.
Now I do not see how you can possibly put

us in the same camp with AGNEW. AGNEW is

I put you in the same..... I disagreed with
what you're saying and if I disayree I'm
going to break in. ;

I think that the people have a vight and I
think that I have a right to say what I mean
without you breaking in. This is another tI
weapon that you use, :

Oh come now!

You don't give people a chance to explain .....
You don't give people a chance. You haven't
been here.

(garbled) make sense with you now (phonetic).
Well, the only reason that you're here, the
only reason that you're here is because we
allow these channels (phonetic) at all times
to be cpen to people with something to say.
And I think that without media the HADDEN
(phonetic) killing would never have been

played up as it was. Never. It would have



been just shoved under the carpet and
nobody would have known about it if not for
the newspapers, if not for radio or television.
HILLIARD: : Let's say this, Let's say that what the
media has projected in regards to FRED
HAMPTON, the Deputy Minister of our Party
here in Chicago has not béen (garbled)
indictment against the police officers
| here in Chicago that has only told the aaned
! people a part of what happened in that house
but still in all it gives. justifies, justifies
the murder’ that took place in that house so
that you cannot tell me that this media has
been in the service of the people, This
media is another tool for the system. It's
not in the service of the people.
FAYE: No. I disagree with you completely.- I'll
turn now to Mr.,GARRY. As an attorney, Mr.
GARRY, I'd like your opinion please, if you
believe if the media, if not for the media or,
a : do you think because of the media things have

been changed around because of this? ©

CHARLES GARRY:

NW 65360 Doctd:32989646 Page 350

Well I have tremendous faith and confidence
in a free press and a free press is exactly.
what it means. The difficulties that we've
had in the dissemination of information from
the Black Panther Party is being able to tell
the truth. It's true that since MARK CLARK
and FRED HAMPTON were murdered and the Los
Angeles police overstayed their police
authority that the press media has been
giving dissemination to the things that the
community has been aware of for a long long
time. The Black Panther Party has had a
program for almost three years. They have
projected humanness, qualities, genuineness
and the only time that the media has ever
been interested is if some particular member
of the Black Panther Party did something
that shocked the white racist community.
Then the media would be interested. But
when the Black Panther Party would ealla
precolconteronce and taik about breakfast

for children, talk about the health program,

sana By sane



they would talk about projection of a better
life in this world including the United
States, the media was silent. The reporters
were there but their bosses never printed
the story, the television cameras never
grinded out the project that the Black
Panthers were projecting. It's true that
today after the death of a valiant fighter
and a valiant leader like FRED HAMPTON and
MARK CLARK and others, they're interested
and they should be interested. The working
press is interested. You are interested.
But somehow or other we get sidetracked. ‘y
read today in the “United States News and
World Report" an account of the Black Panther
Party. That was not a bilateral article.
It's one-sided. It's lopsided. I'm sure

J. EDGAR HOOVER could have written the

same article and said amen "United States
News and World Report."' But these are the
things we're talking about. We don't want

to control press. DAVID HILLIARD and the

Black Panther Party is not advocating @

controlled press. But they are advocating
a free press. We don't care what’ you say
about the Black Panther Party ‘providing you
allow the Black Panther party to state its
position. You can make all the editorial
comments you want to. They don't care
because they understand the free expression
of ideas. This is the area we are talking
about when we talk about the free press is
not really a free press. Many of the press
have had to take stories away in the last’ |
three years because at the advertisers

didn't particularly appreciate the editorial

point of view or the news point of view. |
This is the area we're talking about. And
we're not in the same bag as the Vice

President of the United States.

Well I meant to say in the same bag he was

very critical of the media too, Saying that.
they were lopsided as well. And on the other

hand you say they are lopsided too. And so



GARRY:
FAYE:

GARRY:

NW 65360 Docld:32989646 Page 353 -

we have both ends of the spectrum saying

that the press, the media, is lopsided
(garbled) where the middle road is.

No. We're saying it differently.

That I appreciate of course.

We're saying that we are not permitted to.
get our story out unless there's something
that's shocking such as someone being killed
or someone making a nasty remark about .
somebody. We are saying that all we want :
is to be able to tell our side of the story.
AGNEW says that you should not criticize the
President of the United States as though he
has some particular halo hanging over his
head. We're not saying that. We don't

care how much you criticize the Black
Panther Party providing you give us an

equal opportunity to respond and be able

to tell our side of the story, to be able
to say that racism is here, that the Black
Panther Party is subjected to genocide by

the armed forces of the United States. When

- ld -



FAYE:

GARRY:

NW 65360 Docid:32989646 Page 354

I say the armed forces I'm talking about

the Department of Justice and the state

police authorities.

All right, Mr. GARRY, because you weren't
here I guess to defend BOBBY SEALE and that's
a whole rigamarole here with the conspiracy 8
which is now the conspiracy 7 and so on, that
BOBBY SEALE is now in jail serving a contempt
of court senteneell How are you going to
fight that action?

We intend to appeal that of course. We

think that the conduct of the court, when”
the facts -are known, are going to be shown

it was barbaric, atrocious and not in the
highest standards of American judicial
eoeenes When a judiciary forgets its

role and becomes a partisan, then we don't

‘have justice as we understand it in America.

While we're talking about justice, I have
some great criticisms to make of American
justice. I don’t want to compare it with

any other country because I've never been



in any other country.....
FAYE: Fair enough.
GARRY: +++-.88 far as justice is concerned. But
, I say that justice today in America, in
relationship to at least 50 million people,
that includes the blacks, the ghetto blacks,
the ghetto browns, the ghetto reds, the
ghetto yellows, and the ghetto whites do
not get justice in our American courts. 7
I wag indeed surprised that’ the Attorney
1 General of Canada, addressing a group of
judgés in their conference in San Francisco,
said practically the same thing that I'm
saying today. We have not upgraded our law
where it represents the contemporary needs

of the psople today.

i FAYE: Breaking it down you're saying that if a

man is poor and he goes before a judge for

any charge, chances are he'll go to jail.
GARRY: Yes. Not only will he go to jail, he will
“ ereate records on small matters so that

later on because of these small matters that

have been accumulated, doesn't make any
difference whether he's guilty or innocent.
Many of these men and women who plead guilty
are in fact innocent. We have what we call

a bargain day. A man is charged with a

crime. Say he's charged with petty theft.

He's completely innocent of it. He goes to
a-lawyer. The lawyer says I will defend you
but it will take three days of a jury trial.
I wouldn't trust a judge says the judge
because he has got fixed opinion. I would
suggest you get a jury trial. The jury
trial will take three days. The attorney
will say I will have to charge you at least
$300 a day. That's $900, ‘He, the client,
has already put up $150 to $200 in bail
premiums. The three days in court will

end it. The guy said fine, Expediency,
compromise, Is the man guilty? Has the

man had an opportunity for a fair trial?
Has he been properly represented? In the
HUEY NEWTON case, Minister of Defense of the
Black Panther Party, it took 13 weeks to

try that case. A battery of lawyers with
me as trial counsel worked day and night for
almost a year and a half in preparing that
casect Tremendous amount of invéstigation
was done. If the client was able to pay

for it, it would have cost a little over a
million dollars in legal time. Little over
a million dollars. And the verdict was a
compromise verdict. He was convicted of
manslaughter for killing a police officer.
If it costs a million dollars for a HUEY

a good result because the man was completely

militant to get a fair trial, then I say
our judicial system today is irrelevant to’
the needs of the people and it's about time
we change it. It's about time we realize

it and call a spade a spade when in fact

it is a spade.



MARTY FAYE Now J would like to ask you BOBBY, were you
with the group of Congressmen that were in
town? And, when they had the hearing, of
course, the Assistant United States Attorney
said that he couldn't talk, and Lhey were
after him pretty good, especially when he was
confronted by Congressman POWELL about the

fact that a statement was made to the

"Chicago Tribune", why couldn't it be made °

to your group. But he made a very interesting

point. The Assistant Attorney said this
particular group was not empowered by -
Congress to really be effective or to be
‘legal. And, if this is so, then I'd like to
know how, you know how, these Congressmen
got together to come in for the hearing in

the first place, Do you know?

BOBBY RUSH Well, I think that it would be, that what was
happening as far as the black people are
- concerned, it goes that the feeling ah, ah,

. the black people had expressed and they knew it

The black people, they are the cleeted officials

of their constituancy. And the constituancy,
which is primarily black, and they had moved
to come and to find, to investipate matters,
to find out what was really. poing on, I

think. (Garbled)

Do you think, ah, you know the whole thing
right now is almost like, if it weren't so
tragic, you See, it would be ludicrously
funny, if it weren't so tragic. It's

almost like Keystone Cops, you know, there's

MARTY FAYE

There's killings, the apartment is left open, and
now the coroner wants to close it, and now they reopen it.
And so many different groups are petting together trying to
investigate the thing. Mr. GARRY, do you know if anyone at
all is legally empowered to test this out?
CHARLES GARRY

Ah, let me answer the question in this way. We
demanded a Congressional body to investigate what happened
in Chicago and in Los Angeles, and what's happening to the
Black Panther Party throughout the United States. We cherish...
there's a concerted effort, a conspiracy, to commit genocide
on the Black Panther Party and we said we demanded the hearing
by Congress, but we Said that we wanted Congressmen and
Congresswomen who were not part of the House Committee on
Un-American Activities or the House Committee a Internal
Security or some other form of garbage that's been handout out
over a period of years. We said we wanted men of good-will,
women of good-will in Congress to do this. The black Congress-—
men came to our-call, We also stated we intended to file a
petition in the United Nations charging the United States as
a nation within a nation of committing concerted genocide on

the. Black Panther Party and particularly in recent months, and

we intend to file that petition. We told the committee today,



ae Beene,
this afternoon, that we intended to cooperate with them in
any way they wanted to. We've also indicated that we in-
tend to cooperate with the committee that was formed recently,
the Commission, they call themselves, where former Justice
GOLDBERG is at the head of it. With all of these committees,
we intend to cooperate one hundred percent, but we also intend
to have a caveat. We intend to have a caveat to this extent
so that there will not be a whitewash of what we know to be
the facts. And no one is going to change those facts.

MARTY FAYE

DAVE, do you think the Black Panthers would have

had any trouble at all if they hadn't said, ah, change the
system of government?

DAVE HILLIARD

I don't think that we would have had to suffer, ah,

the atrocities that have been heeded out to our party thus
far, I think that just like most of the black organizations
that have now become puppets, or other areas within the system,
we too, would have been endarked and possibly given some
grants, by the Federal government. But the very fact that

we are opposed to the system of capitalism, because of this
exploit of our nature, I think that this is the main reason
for all the repression against our party, and our ability to

organize across the racial ‘line.

- 24 -

NW 65360 Docld:32989646 Page 362



MARTY FAYE

Yes, but you see, the government doesn't fo through
a conSidered effort to wipe out the Soctalist Party in the
United States.
DAVE HILLIARD

That is because the Socialist Party in the new
United States is endorsed by the vovernment of the United
States. To make a very distinct difference between people
that advocate socialism-through theory and people that
practice it by the very example - our breakfast program,
the free health clinic, our very program, so that our de-
mands are historical demands that have been felt out and
that have been yearned for by a people in this country since
their embarkation. That's why I say that ideoloyical exper-
ience of blacks in this country. Nothing more than that.
MARTY FAYE

Mr. GARRY, what are you doing in Chicago?
CHARLES GARRY

I'm down here with Mr. HILLIARD to meet with the
members of the Central Committee of the Black Panther Party
this evening, which we've already met. Tomorrow morning we
intend to have a conference of warriors throughout the United
States, discussing this repression against the Black Panther

Party and also against white and brown people, and tomorrow

night DAVE and I ®AXXXBXKS are going to be speaking at a mass

meeting in Cleveland, Ohio.

MARTY FAYE

Can I ask you Sir, how your fees are paid?
CHARLES GARRY

Our fees are paid by gratitude, being able to
make a contribution to a better world. Until [ pot in-
volved with the Black Panther Party I was bring ing in between
$150 - 200,000 a year in fees to the firm I'm with, Since
October 27, 1968, I’ve brought in $34,000 and our costs
alone in the HUEY NEWTON case were over $70,000. I'm not
talking about expenses and the cost of defending and repre-
senting members of the Black Panther Party, ELDRIDGE CLEAVER,
BOBBY SEALE and all others, The firm I'm with is financially
being horribly drained. But, we are getting the gratitude,
the gratitude of being able to do something within yourselves,
to make a contribution, for the responsibilities that the
white society has had for 400 years and has failed. And it
is our responsibility, and I hope my fellow white citizens of
America, will join us and make some contributions, financially.
The Black Panther Party needs money. Our firm needs some, money
to be able to carry on. Other lawyers are in this fight. WILLIAM
XUNTSLER, LEONARD WEINGLASS, are in that courtroom before
Judge HOFFMAN day in and day out, and I'm satisfied that that
‘Judge, no matter what the verdict is, intends to send BILL

KUNTSLER. and LEONARD WERINGLASS to jail for contempt of court.

: XL APPENDIX

BLACK PANTHER PARTY

According to its official newspaper, the Black Panther
Party (BPP) was started during December, 1966, in Oakland,
California, to organize black people su they can take control
of the life, politics, and the destiny of the black community.
It was organized by BOBBY GEORGE SEALE, BPP Chairman, and HUEY
P, NLYTON, BPP Minister of Defense, NEWTON is presently serving
a sentence of 2 to 15 years on a conviction of manslaughter in
connection with the killing of an Oakland police officer,

The official newspaper, ‘The Black Panther," which furthe
-deseribes itself as the "Black Community News Service," states
that the BPP advocates the use of guns and guerrilla tactics
in its revolutionary program to cnd oppression of the black
people. Residents of the black community ure urged to arm
Ml themselves against the police who are consistently referred to
in the publication as “pigs” who should be killed

"The Black Panther" issue of September 7, 1968, contains
an editorial by BPP Minister of hkducation, GLORGE MASON MURRAY,
which ends with the following:

"Black men. Black people, colored persons of America,
revolt everywhere; Arm yourselves. The only culture worth keeping
is a revolutionary culture. Change. Freedom everywhere,
Dynamite! Black Power, Use the gun, Kill the pigs everywhere.”

Included in the introduction to an article appearing
in the October 5, 1968, edition of "'The Black Panther" is the
statement,".....we will not dissent from American Government.
We will overthrow it.”

. Issues of "The Black Panther” regularly contain
quotations from the writings of Chairman MAO Tse-tung of the
People's Republic of China and feature MAO's statement that
“political power grows out of the barrel of a gun.”

The national headquarters of the BPP is located at

3106 Shattuck Avenue, Berkeley, Culifornia, Branches have been
established at various, locations throughout the United States.

III, INFORMATION REGARDING VIOLENT ACTS,
"> “> “WEAPONS, PLANS AND AIMS OF BRP

At approximately 3:15 a.m,, November 13,
1969, a spokesman from the Deputy Superintendents
Office, Chicago PD, Chicago, Illinois, advised that
moments earlier officers responding to a report of
a "man with a shotgun" at 5802 Calumet, Chicago,
located in a south side Negro ghetto, were met with

gunfire from at least two male Negroes,

The ‘first three officers to arrive at the scene
were JOHN GILHOOLY, white male, age 21; MICHAEL BRADY,.
white male, age 26) and DANIEL COFFMAN, white male,
age 26. All three officers were shot, according to

_the Chicago PD spokesman, before they got their guns

NW 65360 Docld:32989646 Page 381 -

out of their holsters.

- 10 -



GILHOOLY and BRADY were approaching the building
from the front when a Negro male with a shotgun and a male
Negro with a carbine fired on them, GILHOOLY subsequently
died on November 14, 1969, from his wounds and BRADY
received a head wound for which he was treated at a
local hospital and released, COFFMAN received punshot
wounds in the lep, hand and chest and is hospitalized.

Scores of policemen then responded and firing
continued for almost one-half hour. Six other Chicazpo
PD officers received wounds as a result of this punfipht :

FRANK RAPPAPORT, white male, age 36, who
was killed by a shotgun blast in the face;

DONALD MILEY, white male, age unavailable,
shot in face and arm by a shotgun blast
and lost his right eye; :is hospitalized
and his condition is serious;

PHILIP PREROST, white male, age 27, who

Another suspect in the shooting, LANCE S,
BELL, Negro male, age 20, of 5809 South Indiana,
Chicago, was shot and captured in the alley behind the
shooting incident. BELL was wounded in the leg and
right arm and has been charged with murder. He is
currently incarcerated at the Bridewell Hospital,
Chicago, ieee

The police report on the incident reflects
that the incident was apparently the result of a
previous personal altercation between BELL and one
JAMES CALDWELL, male Negro, 5804 South Calumet, who
is a guard at the Cook County Jail, Chicago.

As a result of this altercation, BELL, WINTERS,
and possibly others went to CALDWELL’s home looking for
him. He was not at home, and CALDWELL's wife
then called the Chicago PD. It was this call that
officers of the PD were responding to.

The area outside the scene of the shooting
remained calm and no large crowds gathered,

A spokesman for the Deputy Superintendent's
Office, Chicago PD, advised that the Chicago PD is in
the process of attempting to determine how many
people actually took part. in the shooting and is
looking for at least one and possibly two male
Negroes, details unknown, whom they believe took part
in this shooting.

A source advised that BELL, although carried.
as a member of the Illinois Chapter of the BPP, is 7
not a trusted member of that Party inasmuch.as he is
and was suspected of being an informant for the Black
P Stone Rangers, a local Negro youth gang. BELL has
been inactive for several months, almost since joining
the Party, due to this suspicion.

a 7 This source advised that WINTERS, also known
as JAKE WINTERS, was a close associate of the BPP, but
was not a member. He was very knowledgeable in weaponry
and is’ suspected of stealing several weapons from BPP
headquarters,

The Black Panther Party benan as a resnonse to reneated instances
of molice violence in the black community. The narty was tsspired by
the Black Panther Party of Lowndes County Alabama (The Lowndes County
Freedom Oranization) which oraanized black peonle in the South to ob-
tain basic rights such as the ribht to vote. The symbol of the Lowndes
County Freedom Oraanization was the Black Panther.

‘The black nanther, as exniained by Minister of Defense Huey P. New-
ton, 1s an.animal who will not attack, If attacked, the black nanther
backs un until he has no more room ta back, Then, the black nanther

. wHT] stptke out at his assailant and wine him out. Newton says that the
- Black Panther Party will not attack unless nushed un against the wali-
where nothing else is possible but to attack its assailants - fn order
to live. This princinile of armed self-defense which is basic to the
Black Panther Party, will be exnlained in a document below.

The Black Panther Party, started by Huey Newton and Bobby Seale
while students at Merritt College in Qakland, set out oriainaliy to je-
gatlv-natro] the police. They carried wearons as nrovided by Taw and
stayed the lenal distance from the nolice whom they watched. . The result
ef this surveillance was a decrease in brutality aaainst mombers of th-
black community and increased harrassment of the Black Panther Part
by the police,

» The leaders of the Black Panther Party (originally called the Black
Fanther Party for Self Defense) soon realized that the police did not
siake the ultimate decisions as to whom they attacked and why. The no-

/ t#ee acted as the law enforcement aqency for those who made the politi-
eal decisions. Thus, the Black Panther Party evolved a nolitical proa

. €o deal with the tyne of political decisions which allowed the nolice
to harrass the black communities and which have resulted in the dreadfu
Tivine conditions of black neonte in this country. (Details of thés
frogram may be found in a document below). a : ‘7

. Huey Hewton has said that the Black Panther Party is the vanauard
narty of the mass of black-peonle. ‘The black community has not yet bee
sufficiently educated to verbalize its demands and to act unon them in
a meaningful way, Bat because thev know the nature of the onnression
under which they suffer, they identify with the Black Panther Party as
the snokesman which articulates their demands. The sunnort for the

- Black Panther Party increases daily as the black community witnesses rh
hanzens to ‘those who sneak for them- the intense brutality and harrass
ment levied aqainst the Black Panthers by the nolice~- and the refusal
of the nower structure even to heed the demands of the black community.

In addition to supnort for the Black, Panther Party from the black
community locally, qrouns have been set un all over the country. In-
ternationally, sunmort 43 evidenced by rallies in Tanzania, Africa,
and statements sunnorting the Black Panthers made by African leaders
such as Kwame Nkrumah and Sekou Toure, Both these men have publicly
Buhperted the demand that Huey Newton be set free.

: As ‘Minister of Communication, Kathleen Cleaver has said, since the
Murder of Black Panther treasurer, Bobby Hutton, and the jailing of
qanumerable Panthers, including Eldridge Cleaver, and , of course,
leader Nuay Hewton, supnort and membership in the Panther Party has
4ncraasad geomatrically, Numerous white qrouns such as the Medical
Committee for Human Rights, -the John Brown Society, The Peack anc

pRae Ld "OF THE BLACK PANTHER PARTY
(HEAT TE OAHT AND MAT WE WEL TRUE) —

The program is usually divided into one section of thn points
entitled "What We Want" and then ten naragranhs explaining these
- points in a section entitled "What We Balieve". For the sake of
clarity, we have put each one of the ten noints in “What We Want®
immediately above its corresponding naragranh in "Nhat We Believe":
We wart freedom, We want nower to determine the destiny of

We hetieve that black peonle will not be free until we are able
to determing cur destiny.

; 2, We want full emnloyment for our neonle.

MWe believe that the federal qovéernment Ts responsible and obligate
to aive every man emnloyment or a guaranteed income. We beligwe zyx
that if the white American busineasmen will not qive full employment,
then the means of nyoduction should be taken from the businessmen
and niaced in the communi ty so that the neonle of the community can
ae and emnloy al} of -its neonle and qive a high standard of

ving. :

3. We want an end to to_the robbery by tl the white man cf our Black”
community. —

We believe that this racist aovernment has robbed us and now we
are, démandina the overdue debt of forty acres and.two mules. Forty
acres and two mules was nromised 100 years aqo as restitution for
slave Jabor and mass murder of black neonte, We will accent the nay-
ment in currency which will be distributed to our many communities.
The Germans are now aiding the Jews in Israel for the aenocide of
the Jewish neonte. The Germans murdered six million Jews. The
American racist has taken mart in the slauahter of over fifty-million
pipe conise therefore, we feel that this is a modest demand that

. we make.

4. We want decent housing, fit for shelter of human beings.

We believe that If the white landlords wilt not give decent
housing to our black community, then tha housing and the Jand should
be made into cooneratives so that our community, with government aid,
‘can ‘build and make decent housing for its neonle. |

5. We want education-for aur neonte that exnoses the true nature
of this decadent American society. We want education that teaches us
‘our true history and our role in the nresent day soclety.

We betieve Tn an educattonaT system that will qive to our people

a knowledge of self, If a man does not have knowledge of himself and
his" nosition in society and the world, then he has little chance to
relate to anything else.

6. We want all black men to be exemnt from military service.

_ We believe that black neonle should not be forced to fight in the
military service to defend a racist acovernment that does not vrotect
us. We will not fight and kill other neonle of color in the world
who, Tike black neonle, ar& being victimized by the white racist
“government of America. We will nrotect ourselves foom the force and
violence of the racist nolice and the-recist military, by whatever

+ POLITICS AND THE BLACK COMMUNITY

The Black Panther Party program and platform ts a result of the an-
“alysis that the Party, and esnecially its leader, Huey Newton, has made
of the nature of politics in America. :

The way to volitical chanae is through nower. This is the nature
of the black nower movement exemnlified by Stokeley Carmichael in that
term. What does this meadn? Huev Newton has said that politics is
war without bloodshed and that war is an extension of nolitics with
‘bloodshed, The reason that the Reconstruction attempt to put blacks
into office from the South failed was because the black leaisfators,
intelligent, well-educated men, had no nowerful constituency behind
them. If you represent a noverless aroun in the legislature, then you
wield no nower. What is a nowerful aroun? According to Minister of
Defense, Newton, a powerful groun is one which, if it doesn't qet
what it wants, can deliver a consequence. There are several ways in
which this kind of power is obtained. ne way is to own the Tand.
This is feudal power. It is exercised by farmers who, when they do
not get what they want, can let-the crons rot in the field, This is
the kind of consequence that rates attention and action. Yhe second
way of gaining power i's econamic: ownershin of the businesses. In
America the slaves were freed with the promise, by the Freedmen's
Bureau, of forty acres and two mules. Had this nromise been fulfilled,
the black man would have had land power and the ability to inflict a
a consequence. The promise, of course, was never fulfilled.

What about businesses? The businesses in the black community ‘are
owned by the white man. Thus, even the economic boycott is difficult
because there are not sufficient black-owned businesses to serve as
ang alternative center for purchasing basic needed qoods.
rn To ask the blacks to redress their qrievances by running for
office does not pose a realistic solution. It is true that members
of the Black Panther Party - Huey Newton for Congress in the 7th
Conaressional District - Bobby Seale for Assembly in the 17th As-
sembly District in Alameda County - and Kathleen LCleaver for As-~
sembly in th 18th Assembly District in San Francisco - are running
for office on the Peace and Freedom Party ticket, but this is only
to have a forum to articulate the arievances of the black community.
Why? Because as stated above the black nolitician without a nower-

" ful constituency just warms a chair in the leoislature.

If the black community cannot aain economic or land-nower, how
can they hone to have chanaes of their conditions? Minister of
Defense Huey Newton says that the onlv other source of power left is
that of the ability to inflict destruction as a- consequence. , Thus,
the black neople must arm in a political fashfon. The black people
must be able to deal with the occunation volice forces in their
communities when they are attacked. The alternative is to have the
police chosew by the black community, live in the black community,
and serve the needs of the black community as that community sees

- them. This would mean that the nolice would no longer act merely to
defend the Interests of the white businessman and stumlord. |
" However, the blacks do not limit themselves to discussion of nower

_. from the qua. The Black Panther Party has a nolitical proaram which
ps Tk vould Tike to see enacted for the benefit of black neoplée. See
below for the nrogram.

WHAT IS THE STATUS OF THE BLACK MAN IN ANERICA TODAY?

Eldridge Cfeaver, Brack Panther: Minister of Infurmation has stated
that the black man is a colonial subject and that black America is a
colony within white America. The fact that the colonial subjects are
dispersed throughout the country does not make their colonial sub-
Jugation any the jess real. Cleaver has stated that: "Black people
.In North America have always been nlagues by a dual status. We were
both sjave and Christian, we were both free and segregated, we are
both integrated and colonized. In the+nast this duality has worked
to our disadvantage. It kept us running around in circles. Today
we propose to turn it to our advantage, in the manner that we have
turned our blackness from a disadvantage into a rallying noint of
advantage. uese
: : Huey Newton has said that the black men in America today is a
man“of confusion. He is of the lower socic-economic background, He
Has withdrawn from his hostile enviroment which he daily faces and
denies his own ability. He has been taught that he is inferior and
he blames himself. He tries to change this tmaqe through his style -”
of life - his desire for flashy material nossessions. He is asked
to resnect a law which does not resnect him. Those who believe in
. cultural nationalism try to answer his nroblem by turning him back
to the time of the eleventh century in Africa. However, his free-
dom cannot come from such an identification. His freedom will come
from identifying with the revolutionary struqqles.of neonle of color
ali over the world, including Africa today. The black man, accord-
- Inq to Cleaver, has a common culture and a common history. All she
jacks to be a nation is land.
What is the History of. the Black Man in America?
. The history of the areCEnt avtTtude of the whites toward blacks
in this country has deep psychological roots, according to Nawton.
It dates to the tine, hundreds of years aqo, when the white Europeans
first came into contact with black Africans, It relates to cultural
differences. The Curoneans whe came to Africa worshipped one god -
@ god who was all-qocd. This was his absolutism. Man was said to
have been created in the image of the all-qood goc and therefore could
do’no evil. Man's instinctual sexual drives were deemed ungod-like
and- were repressed, Such evil was deemed to come from cutside man~
othe result cf demons, devyits, and witches - who were burned at the
“stakes
: . " On the other hand, the Africans below the Sahara, ee black,
- fad a differant form of worshin. Their aod was both good and bad.
. They believed in.dualism. Their god had two or more heeds - one good
‘and one bad. The African had to avoid being like the had head and
must -qet into the Savor of the good head. However, he did not deny
. part of his being as comina from outside himseif. Thus, his sexual
drives were nart cf him - nog evil demons from the outside.
: -When the Euroneans ‘caine to Africa they enslaved the blacks south
“of the Sahara who beijeved in dualism. They were told by the church
that the "qood" Africans north of the Sahara, who believed in a single
“.qod, were more. in line with, the Eurane ,.n belief and shauld net be

Newtion  . that this foe mental 1 @., deener than an-

economic system. It is a psychology that must be reeted out of the white
RSEGWRSXXXE race before the blacks can live-in a society with white ©
asonle. «Thus, when Stokely Carmichael said that socialism is not.
meant for black neonle, he did not mean that he annroved of what the

capitalist. system of economics was doing.to the black communities.

What he was saying is that even with an economic system that provided
‘for all the neonle, if there were still racism, the baack man would

not be able to live as a man.

"The Euroneans raned Africa economically and took the black men as
slaves to America. The black man has, to this day, not been treated
as an equal to the white man ~ in any way. As was nointed out above,-
even aftér the Emancination Proclamation the black man was not given
his ecomomic and nolitical ‘rights. In Fact, after Reconstruction,
the. Southern noliticians convinced the Northern roliticians that the

ck" Teqislators Iwho bad insianificant: nower anyway) ehcutd not
seven that token status. And, as can be seen in the electeral
stritaqles -aoin on in black communities ‘in the South today - the po-
liticians still won't even allow the token representation!

As dames Baldwin said, " To be black and conscious in America is
“to be ina constant state of rage." The whites cannot know what :
it is like to live as a black man in America - in white society. What
.we can know is the nature of the conditions that must be changed to. -
give the black man his long overdue human rights. .

Eee : WHY FREE HUEY NEWTON? :
“1. The Political Reasons. Huey P. Newton is a nolitical prisoner.
He is in jail today, accused of killing an Oakland noliceman, not
because he committed this crime, which he did not, but because he ts
the Minister of Defense of the Black Panther Party. Since the incep-.
tion of the Party the Oakland police have tried to harrass it out
of existence. As the Party became stronger, the nolice tactics became
‘more vicious. The police haye long had the license numbers and des~
‘criptions of al? the cars driven by members of the Black Panther Party.
Gn the night of October 28, 1967, Police 4fficer Frey stinned
an automobile which he knew to be a car on the list of those driven j
by Black Panthers. He stopned the car for an alleged traffic violation,!
the nature of which has never been discloes. In his te stimony. before
the Grand Jury, Officer Heanes, the police officer who was’ summoned
by Frey to come to his assistance after he stonned ‘the Panther car,
said. that Newton. DID HOT HAVE A BUN. Attorney Charles Garry has in-
‘dicated that the evidence noints to the real nossibility that both
officers fired at each other and the %fficer Heanes' bullets killed
Officer Frey.
- The nolice have aiways, in the black community, claimed the right
te exercise indiscriminate vidlence. It was for this yeason that
the Black Panther: Party was oriqinally formed. Before October 28th
‘the Oakland nolice had harrassed Newton on numereus occasions and
had threatened his life. .Qn October 28 Newton was arrested and shot
in the stomach because-he stood for change in the black community.
The black community knows <that Huey fewton and the Panthers. have
“yaised a crucdal issue - control of. black communities by black
peonle.* They recognize that it is the holice who pernetrate violence
-on a daily basts in order to maintain their illegitimate control over

. Ddliack’ ghettoes, Thog@P cosnize that .the action,
“1 stitute legitimate sf defense ‘anainst apolice more interested
in velitical repression and "keaning the niggers in their place" than
in catching criminals. And they recognize the indictment of Huey
Newton as an attempt not only to wine out an haroic black resi stance
jeader, but to also intimidate and crush the movement for self-
determination far all black neonle. If black political leaders are
not: actually assassinated, as were Nedaar Eve ers, Nalcoim X, Nartia
Luther Kina -‘then the government finds ways of confining and neut
tralizing them as in the cases of H.Qan Brown and LeXoi Jones. That
is-why. the black community stands behind the concent FREE HUEY. They

because he is a nolitical leader: that he was arrested and thrown

case of the Oakland 7 arrested on consniracy to commit @ misdemeanor:

test the policies renresented by Dean Rusk, when he anneared at éhe
Fairmount Hotel - demonstrators who were kicked, beaten and MACEDO by
the S. F. nolice while they were RUNNING AWAY - trying to follow orders

blacks alike. ° 7
Ji. The Legal ‘Reasons. Huey Newton was indicted by the Alameda.
County Grand Jury - a jury chosen by the 20 judges on the Alamada
County Superior Court, arbitrarily. Judge Dieden, and-others, have
admitted that &Bhis system results in judges choosing their friends~
or nolitical camnaign contributors to serve on ths "honorary"
vosition. Three volumes of. hearings taken by the Ass oly Com e.
on Governmental Efficiency last year (1967) have naqe testimony
to this effect. The nersons chosen to serve are, overwhalminaly,
white, over 50, retired, or still-active business and professional men
and their wives. — :

. This method of selection is clearly contrary to many cases de- =e
cided by the United States Supreme Court, which cases indi cated that-~ - 7
a jury of one 's neers had to consist of a CROSS-SECTION of the con- i
munity and could not SYSTEMATICALLY EXCLUDE black neonle from serving.
The Grand dury vidlated both of these fundamental arincibles. How-
aver, when Newton's attorneys nresented this evidence to the courts
of California, through the California Sunreme court, they were
dénied redress - WITHOUT EVEN so MUCH AS A HRITTEN OP exniaining

why.

eal Furthermore, the method of indictment denied Newton fundamental
¥ights which the California Supreme Couré has heid are required in
criminal cases and which are given in the Preliminary Hearing.

- The way of nroceding - through the arand jury, or by way of
nreitminary hearing - is at the sole and arbitrary discretion of the
district attorney. There are no quidelines set down either in the
California Constitution or in the Penal Code to quide his choice.

. The district attorney of Alameda County has used the grand
jury very rarely. He used it only in a little over 1% of the cases
ix .1966, He testified before the “ssembly Governmental Efficiency
Committee that he Tike to use it in comnlicated cases such as those
involving assessor frauds or in cases invalving child molestation,
Neither was true in the Wewton case. Others at that hearinn testi-
fied that the arand jury was often used where the district attorney
had a noor case or didn't have enouch facts to withstand exnosure to
the nreliminary hearing. This was true in the Newton case. To this -
date the prosecution has released no information as to its version
of the Newton eyants. This runds counter to its usual procedure
of seeking maximum nublicity to nrejudice the defense case in a
serious criminal matter (cf, the Hutton case). The reason? They pea
havan't made un their story vet. They are honing that the defense
attorneys will let slin therir version of the case so that the D.A.
can then fit his version to counter that one.

“The Grand dury for the last five or more years has NOT ONCE re~
fused an indictment souaht by the District Attorney. How can any
defendant in a set-un like that have any chanae? .

The Arand Jury indictment also serves to nrejudice the later
jury, because they have the aura of unstandkina citizens. If they
felt the defendant was nrobably guilty, what will the petit jury have
to think? :

-,, Fe and Lafayette elementary schools in Oakland. went to Woodrow
2 Milson dr, High School and then attended Oakland Technical High.
His childhood was the same ‘as that of most black youths. He was
never given the onnartunity to do skilled work but worked very
. diligently as a seasonal cannery worker from his araduation from high
‘school onward. :
Huey Newton learned to read well at the ane of 16. This was
when his high school counselors told him he was not collede material.
i -He set out to show them that no white man could.tell him what he was
; canabdle of doing.
- Huey went to Oakland Ciity Colleqae and not an AA deqree with an
excellent aradenoint average, He snent one and one-half years in
* . San Francisco Law School. He left Jaw school to ornanize full-time
- for black liberation. i
- While Huey and Sobby Seales Chairman of the Black Panther Party,
were.at Merritt-Colleqe they formed the Black Panther Party for
Self-Defense, Thev natrolled the baack community to keep the nolice
from brutalizina the black neonle. Newton and Seale taught the blacks
_ on the block their leaal rinhts. They felt that the Panther nro- el
aram had to be imnliemented nractically. This meant starting with
Point No. 7 of the Black Panther Party nrogram to work toward "an
, ‘immediage end to nolice brutality and murder of black neonle." :
Shortly thereafter youna Bobby Hutton. inquired about what Bobby
‘and Huey were doing. They exnlained the idea of the Black Panther.
Payty and its onerations to Bobby Hutton, who then became the first
black youth to join the Party. He was annointed Party Treasurer.
He served the black community faithfully until his murder at the hands
of the Makland nolice on April 6, 1968.

WHY SELF DEFENSE?

: The Black Panther Party has advocated that everyone in the black
community have a qun to defend himself. It should be made very clear
that this does NOT mean that black neonle should have quns in order
to came into the white community and "shoot it un", In fact there
are-NO reported incidents of Black Panthers coming into ANY community
and using their weapons other than to defend their own lives.

The nolice forces in the black community are comnased of men who
Jive in white communities. They are hired as occupation forces to . .
natrol the black cammunity to nrotect white business and land interests.
‘This is brought home very clearly by the -fact that nolicemenk in the
_ thetto try to stay away from incidents in which only blacks are in-
volved. For examnle, if two black qanaa are rumored to be nlanning
a rumble, the nolice refuse te act to ston it. If black kids are
fiohtina_amona themselves, the nolice stav away. If a black woman
complains to the-nolice that her husband has threatened violence
against her, the nolice tell her to call a Jawver. “hen the lawyer
-tvies to & intervene, the. nolice sav they do not like to aet involved
tn domestic disnutes. The list aoes on endlessly. Furthermore, the
nolice are often involved in the local rackets - the numbers aaimes,
“ pake-offs fram done and nrastitution and so forth. However, should
-. a black man fisht a white mair the nolice come in immediately. At
schools where black and white children fight in the schoolyards the

-Tustrated when after Martin Luther King's assassination, Bobby Seale,
‘chairman of the Party, went around Oakland in a sound truck urging

“Not because there was no reason for revalt, but because the Slack

During all the nast riots tke National Guard and the local nolice
shot indiscriminatély at blek neonic. Innocent women and children
were injured as well as neonle only susnected of lootina. Canital
punishment was extended to thase who anneared at the wrong mlace at
the wrong time. No crime at all was necessary. Further riot con-
tinaency nlans included the request tn Detroit for $9,000,0GU for
riot equinment, Where snioers are susnected, the article indicated
that entire buildings wer razed to the around, These dead, the article

nock-marked with machine guns. The nolice caiaimed that they susnected
that the Temnle was the hiding nlace for auns. Naturally, the shot
first and asked questions later. The result? No auns found.In this
case,.because of widesnread nublicitv, Major Yorty was forces to anolo-

nize nublicly for the outrageous conduct of the rolice. However, such
raids continue reqularly in the black community by the rolice, The no-
lice are qetting "tough". To quote Cook County Sheriff Wood (Chicago):

"When we had our Maywood riot, I went around telling my men on the
bullhorn, so all those on the street could hear, that any rioter who
raised his hantls above his head would be quilty of aaqravated assault,
and should be fire on. I also told my mén’to shoot carefully- we
didn’t have extra men to take wounded off to hosnitals." Comnare this
with what hannpened to Denzil Dowell, above, and Bobby Hutton (see below)
A further interesting comnarison was a statement made by Herr Goring,
“who issued these “shoot first" orders: “. . .for failure to act is a
qraver fault that errors made in action,"

several uniformed nestanos of the Berkelev Pin Denartment, ac-
commanied by several other white men in nlainclothes, bearing an
assortment of shotauns, rifles, anc service revolvers, made a

are confronted with a critical situation. fur orcanization has
received serious threats from certain racist elements of White
America, including the Sakland, Berkeley, and San Francisco Piaq

Ye cannot determine when anv of these elements, or a combination

unlawfully and in a rowdy fashion, those who kick our doors down
with no authority and seek to ransack our homes in violation of

_ our HUMAN RIGHTS, will hencefcrth be treated as outlaws, as

white neonie should fear for their own sakes as well as. for the
welfare of the black race. Those of vou who are old enounh to re-
member the nre-Yorld War 11 history will recall that when Hitler came
to nower in Germany he started exterminating his sclitical enemies

“ by nicking on the leacershin (as the Makland rolice are nickina off

the. leacershin of the Black Panther Party). He then, when this was

not stonned by nonular outrane and action, went on to kill millions

and millions of those whom he defined as anemies. *% government which

can exterminate one sroun at will can exterminate many. “hen Stalin,

in the Soviet Union, felt it necessary to exterminate enemies, he

btated on a small scale. When he found that he could continue this

technique, the nurses became wider and wider in scone. Althoush ;

Huey Newton feels the concentration camns will be filled with black

fin Mav2, 1967, the Slack Panthers went to Sacramento, carrying auns

Jenallv. Thev went to the “ssemblg observation sectton Ted by a

eyew of television men and renorters. “lhen they were directed to

the observer box, the Assembly members reauested that the suards re-

move the television cameras, not the auns. The canitol nolice were,

- at all times, aware of the fact that the Slack Pankhers were armed.

Had the Panthers entered the fAssemblv with ouns to co any shooting, they
had amnle opnortunity. However, this was not their nurnose. They
came to nrotest the “ulford bill, which was wxnlicitly directed anainst
tehm, and to deliver the above-auoted statement of Huey Newten on the
qenocidal nature of the American scovernment. 7

Recause the Panthers weee leaally carrvina guns, they could not
be arrested while at the canitol. However, as they were leavinn
Sacramento, the nolice duq um an old Fish and Game law that dealt

with loaded weanons in a vehicle. The law was enacted to prevent

accidents when hunters carried suns. The Panthers were havina their -
cars serviced at a aas station when the nolice arrested 23 of them
for violation of the Fish and LGame code, The Panthers did not resist
arrest, even though they were armed and were numerous. After beina

-arrested, the Panthers were thrown into the drunk tank of the Jail

with neither beds nor blankets. They were treated just like the
animals for the killing of which reaulations were mace in the Fish

and Game law. . : zi
As. Huey Newton nredictéd,* the oress resnonse to the incident was

. ge ‘distort what hannenad and to ratse the snectre of violence. The

NW 6:

white, these were false charnes, he documents below indicate that
the Panthers are not a racist orsanization anc will form coalitions
with white arouns who are willina to sunnort the Panther nlatform
and who will work to end racism,

The Nulford bill was cnactec into Taw as a snecial bill and has
been used, nredictably since then, to harrass members of the Black
Panther Party. Attorneys feel that the bill is clearly ‘unconstitution-
al, However, as will be shown below, Tack of funds, as well as .
the nature of the court system, nrevent the unconstitutionality from

“serve &kmaxk he would not oress charses anainst the rest. It should
- be noted that this tyne of justice is not limited’ to the Black Panthers.

Every dav. black neonle are arrested on charnes which are false or
unsubstantiated. Recause of lack of funds many of them serve jail

been constantly harrassed. See below for further details.

THE MURDER NF DORBY-HUTTON-AND-THE-ARRESF-OF-THE~PANTHER-&

“On Sunday, Anvil 7, the Stack Panther Party had oTanned a nfcnic
‘barbecue to raise money for the defense of Huey P. Newton. Saturday
night Eldridae Cleaver, Bobby Hutton, and a number of other Panthers
were driving arounc Oakland to collect food that the sisters had
nrenared, Their mission was interrunted when screral squad.cars of
Oakland nolice intercented and ambushed the Panthers in their own

Robby Hutton, aged 17, was killed by nelice bullets - he was
tald to run for a squad car an’, while his hands were raised and he
was unarmed, officers shot him down.

od

The Party School cp¥ns crday and I wish it every success,

I would like to say something abcut the problem of cur Party's

style of work, ;

|. Why must there be a revolutiénary party? There must be a reve~
lutionary party because the world contains ‘enemies who oppress the
people and the people want to throw off enemy oppression, #In the
era of capitalism and imperialism, just such a revolutionary party
as the Communist Party is needed, Without such a party it is simply
impsssizlo fer the paople to throw off enemy oppression, We are
Cenmunists, wo want to lead the peoplo in overthrowing the enemy, and
80 we must keep our ranks in goed order, we must march in step, our
troops must be picked troops and our weapons gvod weapons,
Without these conditions the enemy cannot be overthrown.

.. What is the problem now facing our Party? The general line of #3
“the Partk is correct and presents no problem, and the Party's
work has been fruitful, The Party has several hundred thousand
Wanders who are leading the people in extremely hard and bitter

7 Struggles against the enemy, This is plain to everybody and

*, *beyond all doubt, :

Then is there or is there not any problem still facing our
Party? I say there is and, in a certain sense, the problem is
quite serious, ; :

ZuWnat is the problem? It is the fact that there is some-
thing in the minds ef a number of our ccmraces which strikes one
as not quite right, not quite proper, : :

In other werds, there is still something wrong with our style
of study, with our style in the Party’s internal and external
relations and with cur style of writing, By something wrong with
the style of study we mean the malady of subjectivism, By some~
thing wrong with cur style in Party relations we mean the malady
of,sectarianism, By something wrong with the style of writing
wen mean the malady of stereotyped Party writing, All these are
wreng, they are ill winds, but they are not like the wintry north
winds that sweey across the whole sky. Subjectivism, sectarianism
and stereotyped Party writing are no longer the dsminant styles,
but merely gusts of contrary wind, 4111 winds fron the air-raid
tunnels, It is bad, however, thnt such winds should still be
blowing in the Party, We must.seal eff the passages which pro-
duce them, Our whole Party should undertake the job of séaling

“off these passages, and so should the Party School, Thesd three
ill:winds, subjectivism, sectarianism and stereo-typed Panty
weiting, have their historical criging, Although no longsr
dominant in the whsle Party, they still constantly create trouble

_ and assail us, Therefore, it is necessary to resist them and to
study, analyse, and elucidate them,

- Fight subjectivism in order t+ rectify the style of study,
7 fight Sectarianism in order to rectify the style in Party rela~

- tions, and fight Party stereotypes in order to rectify the style
of writing--such is the task ‘before us, :

- *fo accomplish the task sf overthrowing the enemy, we must

. accomplish the task of rectifying these styles within the Party.
The style of study and the style of writing are also the Party's
style of work, Once our Party's style of work is put cenpletely
vight, the people all cver the country will learn from our exam—

‘ ; I gropose that we should reform the mothed and the system of study throughout
i’the Partys The reasons are as follows?

ra Ie n

The twenty years of the Commuriist’ Party of China have been’ twenty year’ in which
the universal) truth of Marxiem-Léniniism has become more and more integrated with the
eonersts practice of the Chinese revolution. If we recall how superficial and meager

‘our understanding ef Marxism-Leninism and of the Chinese revolution was during our
Party?s infancy, we can see how much deeper and richer 1t is now. For a hundred
years, ‘the finest soné and daughters of the disaster-ridden Chinese nation fovght
and sacrificed their lives, one stepping into the bredch as another fell, in quest
of tha truth that would save the country and ‘the peopie. This moves us to song and
tears. But it was only after World War I and the October Revolution in Russia that
we found Marxism-Leninism, the best of truths, the best ef weapons for libderat Sing
our nation And the Communist Party of China has ‘been the initiater, propagandist
and exganizer in the wielding ef this weapons As soon as it was linked with the
conorate practice of the Chinese revolution, the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism
gave an entirely new complexion te the Chinese revolution. Since the outbreak of -
the War of Reaistance Against Japan, our Party, hasing itself on the universal trith
of Marxism-Leninism, has taken a further step in its study of the concrete practice
of this war and in its study of China and the world today, and has also made a be~
ginning in the study of Chinese history, ‘These are all very good signs.

ile

However, we still have shertcomings, and very big ones tooo Unless we correct
‘these shortcomings, we shall not, in my opinion, be able to take another step.forwar
in our-work and in our great cause of integrating the universal truth of Marxism

Loninism with the conerete practice of the. Chinese revolutions

First, take the study of current conditionse We have achieved some success in
our study of present demestic and international comliticns, Lut for such a large
polltical party as ours, the material we have collected is fragmentary and our re~
search work tnsystematic on each and every aspect of these subjects, whether it be
tho political, military, econcmic or cultural aspect. Generally speaking, in the
last twenty years, wa have nob done syatematic and thorough work in collecting and
studying material on these aspects, and we are lacking in a climate of investigation -
and study of objective reality. To behave like "a blindfolded man c&tching sparrows:
or & “blind man groping for fish,” to be érude and careless, to indvige in verblage,
> 49 vast content with a smattering of ‘knowledge--such | is the extremely | bad styie of
verk that st417 exists among many comrades in our Party, a style utterly opposed te
the fundamental spirit of MarxismLeniniem. Marx, Engels, Lenin “and Stalin have
taught us that 1t is necessary to study ccnditions conscientiously and ta preceed
from objective reality ard not fran subjective wishes} but many of our comrades act
in diract vielation of this truth.

Sseund, ‘take the study of history. Although a few Party membexs and sympathiz-
arachave undertaken this work, it has not been’ done in an orgexntazed way. Many Party
members ane stil]. in a fog about Chinese history, whether of the last hundred years
or of ancient times. There are many Marxist-Leninist scholars whe cannct open their
nouths without citing ancient Greaco$, out as for their om ancestcrs—sorry, they
have been forgotten. There is no clinate of serious study either of cursent condi-
tiong or of past iesitiiekeht

kind of theorists Qi rents -We want theor@Qno ean, in ac-
cordance with the Marxist-Leninist stand, viewpoint and method,
correctly interpret the practical problems arising in the course
of history and revolution and give scientific explanations and
thecretical elucidations of China's economic, political, military,
cultural and other problems, Such are the theorists we want. To
be a theorist of this kind, a person must have a true grasp of
the essence of Marxism-Leninism, of the Marxist-Leninist stand,
viewpoint and method and of the theories of Lenin and Stalin on
the colonial revolution and the Chinese revolution, and he must be
able to apply them in a penetrating and scientific analysis of
China's practical problema and discover the laws ef development
of these problems, Such are the theorists we really need,

«fhe Central Committee of our Party has now made a decision .
ealling upon our comrades to learn how to apply the Marxist-
Leninist stand, viewpoint and method in the serious study sf
Chinas history, and of China's economics, politics, military
affairs and culture, and to analyse every problem concretely on
the basis of detailed material and then draw theoretical conclu-
sions, This is the responsitility we must shoulder,

Our comrades in the Party School should not regard Marxist
theory as lifeless dogma, It is necessary to master Marxist the-
ory and apply it, master it for the sole purpose of applying it.

one or two practical problems, you shoule be commended and cre-
dited with some achievement, The more problems you elucidate and
the more comprehensively and profuondly you do so, the greater
will be your achievement, Our Party School should also lay down
yhr zukx rule to grade students good or poor accoring to how
they look at China's problems after they have studied Marxism- ;
Leninism, according to whether or not they see the problems clear-
ly and whether or not they see them at all, i eeezeeh

- Next let us talk about the question of the "intellectuals",
Since China is a semi-colonial, semi~feudal country and her cult-
ure is not well developed, intellectuals are particularly treasured
On this question of the intellectuals, the Central Committee of
the, Party made the decision over two years ago that we should win
over the great numbers of intellectuals and, insofar as they are
revolutionary and willing to take part in the resistance to Jsyan,
welcome them one and all, It is entirely right for us to esteem
intellectuals, for without revolutionary intellectuals the revo-~
lution cannot triumph, But we all know there are many intellec~
tuals tux xa” who fancy themselves very learned and assume airs of
erudition without realizing that such airs are bad and harmful
and hinder their own progress, They ought to be aware of the
trugh that actually many so-called intellectuals are, relatively
speaking, most ignorant anéa@ the workers and peasants sometimes
know more than they do, Here some will say, "Hal You are turning
things upside down and talking nonsense,” But, sump comrades
don't get excited; there is some sense in what I am eaying.

What is Knowledge? Ever since class society came into being
The world has known only two kinds of kmowledge, knowlaige of the
struggle for production and Imowledge of the class struggle,
Natural science and social science are the erystalizations of °*
these two kinds of knoledge, and philosophy is the gencralization
and summation of the knowledge of nature and the know’: Ge of
society. Is there any other kind of knowledge? No. Now let ud = 68.=_

Let me speak now about subjectivism,

Subjectivism is an improper style of study; it is opposed to
Marxism-Leninism and is imcompatible with the Communist Party.
What we want is the Marxist-Leninist syle of study, What we call
style of study means not just style of study in the schools but
in the whold Party, It 18 a question of the method cf thinking
of comradea in our leading bodies, of all cadres and Party mem-
bers, a question of our attitude towards Marxism-Leninism, sf
the attitude of all Party comrades in their work, As such, it
dis a question of extraordinary, indeed of primary, importance,

‘ Certain muddled ideas find currency among many pe»ple. There
are, tor instance, muddled ideas about what is a theorist, what

is an intellectual and what is meant by linking theory and prac-
tice,

Let us first ask, is the ‘theoretical level of our Party high
er low? Recently more Marxist Lenist works have been translated
and more people have been reading then. That is a very good
thing, But can we therefore a say that the theoretical level of
cur Party has been greatly raised? True, the level is now some-
what higher than before, But our theoretical front is very much
out of harmony with the rich content of the Chinese revolutionary
movement, and a comparison of the twee shows that the theoretical ~
side is lagging far behind, Generally speaking, our theory can-
not a& yet keep pace with our revolutionary practice, let alend
lead the way ats it should, We have not yet raised our rich and
yauled practice to the proper theoretical plane, We have not yet
axmined all the proplems of revslutionary practice--or even ae
important ones-~and raised them to a theoretical plane, Jus
think, hew many of us have created theories worthy of the name

- on China's economics, politics, military affairs or culture,
* theories which can be regarded as scientific and comprehensive,

and not erude and sketchy? Esyecially in the field of economic
theory: Chinese capitalism has had a century of development

since the opium War, and yet not a single theoretical work had
been preduced which accords with the realities of China‘s econ~
onic problems, for instance, the theoretical level is already
high? Can we say that cur Patty kan already has economic theor’
ists werthy of the name? Certainly not. We have read a great
many Marxist~Lenist boske, but can we claim, then, that we have
theorists? We cannot. For Marxism-Leninism is the theery created
by Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin on the basis of practice, their

general conclusion drawn from historical and revolutionary reality,

If we merely read their works but do not prsceed to study the
realities.of China's history and revolution in the light of their
theory or-do not make any effort th think through China‘?s rev2~
lutionary practice carefully in terms of theory, we should not be
so presumptuous as to call ourselves Marxist theorists, Our ach-
ievernents m the theoretical front will be very poor indeed if,
ag members of the Communist Party of China, we clase cur eyes to
China’s preblems and can only-memorize isolated conclusions or
principles from Marxist writings, If all 2 person can do is 9
cimmit Marxist economics or philosop}y to memory, reciting glibly
from Chapter I to Chapter X, but is utterly unable to apply them,
ean he be considered a Marxist theorist? No! He cannot. What #4

snoiety, What about them? A person gues th ch a primary
school of this kind all the way through to a university of
the same kind, graduates and is reckoned to have a stock of
learning, But allche has is booklearning; he has not yet
part in any orantical activities ox applied what he has le
to any field of life, Can such a person be regarded usa co;
-ely developed intellectual? Hardly so, in my opinion, bec#
his knowledge is still incomplete, What then is re
complete knowleage? All relatively complete knowledge is f:1med
in two stages: The first stage is perceptual knowledge, the s
is rational knowledge, the latter being the develormert of ths
former to a higher level, What sort of knowledge is thw student's
booklearning? Even supposing all their knowledge is tru aaa
is still not kmowledge acquired through thier own pers:
perience, but consists of theories set down by thier pred: cs

in summarizing experience of the struggle for production and of

the class struggle. It is entirely necessery that students

should acquire this kind of knowledge, but it must be understcod
that_as far as they are concerned such knowledge is in a sense s
still one sided, something which has been verified by others but
not yet by themselves, What is most important is to be good at
applying this knowledge in life and in practice, Therefore, I 7
advise those who have only booklearning but 2s yet no con}act +2
‘with reality, and also those with little practical experience, to
realize their own short comings and become a little more modest,

How can those who have only booklaerning be turned into intel-
lectuals in the true sense? The only way is to get them to take
part in practicsl work and become practical werkers, to get those
engaged in theoretical work to study important practical prebloms,
In this way our wxxy aim can be attained,

What I have said will probably make some people angry, They
will say, “According to your explanatien, even Marx would not be
regarded as an intellectual," - I say they are wrong, Marx took
part in the practice of the revolutionary movement and also
created revelutionary theory, Beginning with the commodity, the
simplest element of capitalism, he made a thorough study of the
economic stricture of capitalist society, Millions of peo
and handled commodities avery day tut were so used to them
they took no notice. Marx alone studied commodities sciéntifi-~
.cally, He carried out a tremendous work of research intd their
actual development and derived a nature, history and proletarian
revolution and created dialéctical materialism, hostorical mater-
ialism and the theory of proletarian revolution. ‘Thus Marx became

-& most completely developed intellectual, representing the acme of
human wisdom; he was fundamentally different from those who have
only book-learning, Marx undertook detailed investigations and
studies in the course of practical struggles, formed generaliza~
tions and then verified his conclusions by testing them in prac-
tical struggles--this is what we call theoretical work, ‘ur

Partk needs a large number of comrades who will learn how to do
sich work, In our Party there are many comrades who can learn to
do this kind of theeretical research; most of them are intelligent
ard promising and we should value them, But they must follow
correct principles and not repeat the mistake of the past
must discard dogmatisin and not confine themselves to res

“.However, of the two kinds of subjectivism, dogmatism is still
the greater danger in our Party, For dogmatists can easily assume
a Warxist guide to bluff, capture and make servitors of cadres of
working-class and peasant. origin who cannot easily see through
them; they can also bluff and ensnare the naive youth. If we
overcome dogmatism, cadres with book-learning will readily join
whth those who have experience and will take to the study of
practical things, and then meny good cadres who integrate theory
with experience, as well as some real theorists, will emerge, If
we overcome dogmatism, the comrades with practical experience
will have good teachers to help them raise their experience tou the
level of theory and so avoid empiricist errors,

Besides muddled ideas about the "theorist" and the "intellect-
ual”, there is a muddled idea among many comrades about “linking
theory an@ practice”, a phrase they have on their lips every day,
They talk constantly about "linking*, but actually they mean "se-
parating”, because they make no effort at linking, How is x
Marxist-Leninist theory to be linked with the practice of the
Chinese revolution? To use a common expression, it is by “shoot-
ing the arrow at the target", As the arrow is to the target, go
is Marxism-Leninism to the Chinese revolution, Some comrades,
however, are "shooting without a target", shooting at random, and
such .people are liable to harm the revolution. Others merely sk
stroke the arrow fondly, exclaiming, "What a fine arrow! What a
’ fine arrow!,” but never want to shoot it. These people are only
connoisseurs of curios and have virtually nothing to do with the
revolution, The arrow of Marxism-Leninism must be used to shoot
at the target of the Chinese revolution. Unless this point is
made clear, the theoretical level of our Party can never be raised
and the Chinese revoltuion can never be victorious, Fe

Oon comrades must understand that we study Marxism-Leninism
not for Gisplay, nor because there issany mystery about it, but
solely because it is the science which leads the revolntionary
ei of the proletariat to victory. Even now, there are not a

aw. people who still regard odd quotations from Marxist-Leninist
aes ag a ready-made panacea which, once acquired, ean easily
cure ali maladies, These people show childish ignorance, and
we should enlighten them, It is precisely such ignorant people |
who take Marxism-Leninism as a religious dogma, To them we should
gay. bluntly, "Your dogma is worthless," Marx, Engels, Lenin and
Stalin have repeatedly stated that our theory is not a dogma put
a guide to action, But such people prefer to forget this sa ‘state
ment which is of the greatest, indeed the utmost, importance,|
Chines? Communists can be regarded as linking theory with practice
only when they become good at applying the Marxist-Leninist stand,
viewpoint and method and the teachings of Lenin and Stalin con~
cerning the Chinese revolution and when, furthermore, through ser-
ious research into the realities of China's history and revolution
they do creative theoretical work to meet China's needs in differ-
ent spheres. Merely talking about linking theory and practice
without actually doing anything about it is of no use, even if one
goes on talking for a hundred years, To oppose the subjectivist,
one-sided approach to problems, we must demolish dogmatist sub. 68a «
jectiveness and one-sidedness,.

Let me now speak about the question of sectarianism,

Having been steeled for twenty years, our Party is no longer
dominated by sectarianism, Remnants of sectarianism, however,
are still found both in the Party’s internal relations and in its
external relations, Sectarian tendencies in internal relations
“lead to exclusiveness towards people outside the Party and hinder
inner-Party unity and solidarity, while sectarian tendencies in~
external relations lead to exclusivenass towards people outsids
the Party and hinder the Party in its task of uniting the whole
people, Only by uprooting this evil in both its aspects can
the Party advance unimpeded in its great task of achieving unity
among all Party comrades and among all the people of our country.

What are the remnants of inner-Party sectarianism? They are
mainly as follows: . :

- First, the assertion of "independence", Some comrades see only -
the interests of the part and not the whole; they always put un-<
due stress on that part of the work for which they themselves are
responsible and always wish to subordinate the interests of the
whole to the interests of théir own part, They do not understand
the Party3s system of democratic centralism; they do not realize
that the Communist Party not only needs democracy but needs cen-
tralization even more, They forget the system of democratic.
eentralism in which the minority is subordinate to the majority,

| the lower level to the higher level, tne part to the whole and

| “the entire membership to the Central Committee, Chang Kuo-tao
asserted his "independence" of the Central Committee of the
Party and as a result "asserted" himself into betraying the Party
and became a Kuomintang agent, Although the sectarianism we are
now discu&sing is not of this extremely serious kind, it must
still be guarded against and we must do away completely with all
manifestations of disunity. We should encourage comrades to
take the interests of the whole imtq account. Every Party mem-
ber, every. branch of work, every statement and every action must
proceed from the interests of the whole Party; it is absolutely
impermissible to fiolate this principle,

Those who assert this kind of “independence” are usually weddeé
to the doctrine of "me first” and are gencrally wrong on the ques-
tion of the relationship between the individual and the Party, Al
though in words they profess respect for the Party, in practice
they put themselves first and the Party second, What are these
people after? They are after fame and position and want to be in
the limelight. Whenever they are put in charge of a branch! of
work, they assert their "independence", With this aim, they draw
‘some people in, push others out and resort to boasting, flattery
and touting among the comrades, thus importing the vulgar style of
‘whe bourgeois political parties into the Communist Party, It is
their dishonesty that causes them to come to grief. I believe
we should do things honestly, for without an honest attitude it is
absolutely impossible to accomplish anything in this world. Which
are the honest Beople? Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin are honest,
men of science are honest, Which are the dishonest people? Trot-
sky, Bukharin, Chen Tu~hsiu and Chang Kuo-tao are extremely dis-

! honest ;. and those who assert ““ihdependence” out of personal or
i sectional interest are dishonest too. All sly people, all those.
who do not have a scientific attitude in their work, fancy them» 67 =

to this, Moreover, even within the same base area,owing to the fact -°

that some districts develcp earlier and others later, there is a...
difference between the local cadres and ghose from outside hee Cad~ -
res who come from a more developed to a less developed district? ~

‘are also outside cadres in relafion to that locality , and they toe

should pay great attention to fostering and helping lccal cadres,
Generally speaking, in places where outside cadres are in charge,
it is they who should bear the main responsibility if their rela+
tions with the local cadres are not good, And the chief comrades 1m”
chaege should bear greater responsiblilty, The ateentisn puid toe th

. this problem in some places is still very inadequate, Some 2people

loek down on the local cadre and ridicule them, saying “What do the
locals know? Clodhoppersi” Such pecple utterly fail to understand

the importance of local cadres; they know neither the latiers stron oa

points nor their own weaknesses and adopt an incorrect; sectariar
attitude. All outside cadres must cherish the lacal cadres and give
them constant help end must not be permitted to ridicule or attack

. them, Of course, the local cadres on their part must learn from the

strong points of the outside cadres and rid themselves¥of inappro-
priate, nafrew viewsxso that they and the outside cadres become as
one, with no distinction between “them* and *us',and thus, avoid
sectarian tendencies, - ’ . nN =

The same applies to the relationship betweer. cadres in army-ser

soteristics of aish departmentalist, We must intensify our efforts
to educate such people and to make them understand that selfish i
cepartmentakism 1s a sectarian tendency which wild become very dan-
gerous,if allowed to develop,

. Another problem is the rolation between old and new cadres,
Since the beginning of the War of Resistance, our Party has grown
enournously, and large numbers of hew cadres have emerged; that is
& very good thing, In his report to the Eighteenth Congress of the
Communist Party of the Soviet Union (B,) Comrade Stalin’ said,"seuc:
there are never enough old cadres, there are far less than’. .+ ,
required, and they are partly geing out of commission owing to the
operation of the laws of nature,” Here he was discussing the cadres
situetion and not only the laws of nature. If our Party does not
have a great many new cadres working in unity And co-operation with
the old cadres, our cause will come to a stop, All old cadres,there
fore, should welcome the new ones with the utmost enthusiasm and
show them the warmest solicitude, True, new cadres have their short
‘comings,,They have not been long in the revolution and Lack experi~

re-

‘ ence; and unavoidably some have brouhgt with them vestiges of the

vunwhalesome ideology of the old society, remnants of the ideology
of petty—bourgeouls individualism, But such shortcomings can be
gradually eliminated through education and tempering in the reve
2utionx, The strong points of the new cadres, as Stalin sald, is -

an their relations with non-Party people, lock down upon them,
despise or refuse to respect them or appreciate their strong paints
This is indeed a sectarian tendency. After reading a few Marxist
bosks, such comrades become more arrogant instead of more modest,
and invariably dismiss others as no good withouds realising that in
fact their own knowledge is only half-baked, Our comrades must
realize the truth that Communist Party members are at all t S38

There is no time uay to talk about the q tion of stereo-
typed Party writing1 shall discu&s it at another meeting. Ster-
eotyped Party writing is a vehicle for filth, a form of expression
for subdjectivism and sectarianism, It dees people harm and damages
the revolution, and we must get rid of it. completely: .

To combat subjectivism we mus+ propagate materialism and dia-
leetics; However, there are many comrades in our Party.who lay
no stress on the propaganda either of materialism or of dialectics
Some tolerate subjectivist propaganda and regard it with equanim-
ity. They think they believe in Marxism, but make no effort to
propagate materialism and do not give it a thought or express any
opinion when they hear or read subjectivist stuff. This is not
the attitude of a Communist, It allows many of our comrades to
ve poisoned by subjectivist idens, which numb their sensitivity.
He should therefore launch a campaign of enlightenment withing
the Party to free the minds of our comrades from the fog’ of sub-
jectivism and dogmatism and should call upon them to boycott sub-
jectivism, sectarianism and stereotyped Party writing, Such evils
are like Japanese goods, for only our enemy wishes us to preserve
them and continue to befuddle ‘ourselves with thems; so we should
advocate a boycott against them, just as we boycott Japanese
goods, We should boycott all the wares of subjectivism, sectar-
ianism, and stereotyped Party writing, make their sale Gifficult,
and not allow their purveyors to ply their trade by exploiting the
low theoretical level in the Party. Our’ comrades must develop
a good nose for this purpose; they should take a sniff at everthing ~
and disvinguish the good from the bad before they decide whether
to welcome it or boycott it, Communists must always go into the
whys and wherefores of anything, use their own heads and carefully
think over whether or not it corresponds to reality and is really
well founded; on no account should they follow blindly and encour-
age slavishness, =

Finally, in opposing subjectivism, sectarianism and stereotyped
Party writing we must have in mind two purposes: first, "learn
from past mistakes to avoid future ones", and second, “cure the
sickness to save the patient”, The mistakes of the past must te
exposed without sparing anyone's sensitilities; it is necessary to
analyse and criticize what was bad in the past with a scientivic
attitude so that work in the future will be done more carefully
and done better, This is what is meant by "learn from past mis-_
takes to avoid future ones", But our aim in exposing errors and
critizing shortcomings, like that of a doctor curing a sickness,
is solely to save the patient and not tv doetor him to death, A
person with appendicitis is saved when the surgeon removes ‘his ap-
pendix. So long as a person who has made mistakes does not hide
his sickness for fear of treatment or persist in his mistakes until
he is beyond cure, so long as he honestly and sincerely wishes to
be cured and to mend his ways, we should welcome him and cure his
sickness so. that he can become a good comrade, We can never succeed
if we just “let ourselves go, one must never be rough and rash but
must adopt the approach of "curing the sickness to save the patient"
which is the only correct and eSfective method,

have said, 9



Ye who 1i@in Chicago, State of 11@bois, must face
an increasingly evident truth: we have no control over the-
institutions which govern our lives. For a survival and
the survival of our freedoms, wo must now demand control
of these forces, particularly that one which we confront
daily in our communities and which often makes the final

decision regarding our lives. . . or coaths: the POLICE

_ DEPARTMENT.

These racist nclice have been used as forces working
against the necnle and in cahoots with the corrupt political
figures. These lyina politicians and murdering, brutalizina
police, joined by the qreedy businessmen like Hunt and
DuPont, are in control of our destinies. .It is become an
"AMERICAN TRADITION" for police to prevent the American neaple
from protesting these intolerable conditions. This
WAMERICAN TRADITION" is reaching astronomical heiqhts and -
becoming an “AMERICAN NIGHTMARE" because the ‘three-in one'
described above neeas to sunnress the ever-arowing activity
of onnressed nennie to be free ence their eyes are cnenead to
the truth about why a Black youth is Shot in the back for
throwing rocks at the railroad tracks; why Black and onpressed
peanle work for $2.00 an hour, 10 hours a day and stil? not
make enough to nrovice for his family with enauqh Jeft over

necessities(color t.v.s and cadillacs) by the system's master

Brainwasher, the 8098 TUBE.



What cane do about it? “Ve act as if .

ecome immune to the
sight of police™Using violence to break up peaceful demonstrations, using
violence to break the heads and spirits of our people. We can't allow
these horror--ridden conditions to continue Lo exist, The police are
already moving for autonomous power in this country, That means they
won't have to answer to anybody not even the lying politician and the
greedy businessman (let alone oppredsed people) for their actions. They wi
be free to come in our corminitics on thelr daily search-and-destroy
missions unchecked to wipe us oub indiscriminately, coufidsnt that their
actions not only won't be condemned by their superiors but will in fact
be commended and praised by them! An exaggeration? Not by any means, a
fact made painfully clear when we look at the pre-dawn assassination of -
Chairman Fred Hampton and Mark Clark: the vicious murder of Michael and
John Soto, Charkes Jackson and countless others. ;

.For the people to have control over thesé police and their functions
the political asylem given the police by the political forces such as
Daley and Hanrahan (remember shoot-to-kill and the war on gangs) must
be destroyed and the police made sensitive to the needs of cach community.

-The COMMUNITY CONTROL OF POLICE PETIT£ON to be circulated soon is

designed to establish thet kind of control throush a complete reorganiza—
tion of the Police Department, All police officials will tle ‘clected
by the peopl all policemen will be required to live in the areas they

work in,

Ie

APPENDIX

According to its official newspaper, the Black Panther
Party (BPP) was started during December, 1966, in Oakland,

“| California, to organize black people so they can take control
“of the Life, politics, and the destiny of the black community,

It was organized by BOBBY GEORGE SEALE, BPP Chairman, and HUEY
P, NEWTON, BPP Minister of Defense, NEWTON is presently serving
a sentence of 2 to 15 years on a conviction of manslaughter in
connection with the killing of an Gakland police officer.

The official newspaper, "The Black Panther," which furth: -
describes itself as the "Black Community News Service," states
that the BPP advocates the use of guns and guerrilla tactics
in its revolutionary program to end oppression of the black
people. - Residents of the black community are urged to arm
themselves against the police who are consistently referred to
in the publication as "pigs" who should be killed.

"The Black Panther" issue of September 7,- 1968, contains
an editorial by BPP Minister of Education, GEORGE MASON MURRAY,
which ends with the following: :

"Black men. Black people, colered persons of America,
revolt everywhere: Arm yourselves. The only culture worth keeping
is a revolutionary culture. Change, Freedom everywhere,

Dynamite: Black Power. Use the gun. Kill the pigs everywhere."

Included in the introduction to an article appearing
in the October 5, 1968, edition of "The Black Panther" is the
statement,".....we will not dissent from American Government.
We will overthrow it.”

issues of "The Black Panther" regularly contain
quotations from the writings of Chairman MAO Tse-tung of the
People's Republic of China and feature MAO's statement that
“political power grows out of the barrel of a-gun."

The national headquarters of the BPP is lecated at
3106 Shattuck Avenue, Berkeley, California. Branches have been
established at various locations throughout the United States,

L ‘ — APPENDIX

STUDENTS FOR A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY

A source has advised that the Students for a Democratic
Society (SDS), as presently regarded, came into being at a
founding convention held June, 1962, at Port Huron, Michigan.
From an initial posture of "participatory democracy". the line
of the national leadership has revealed » growing Marxist—
Leninist adherence which currently calls for the building of
@ revolutionary youth movement. Concurrently, the program
of SDS has evolved from civil rights struggles to an anti-
Vietnam war stance to an advocacy of a militant anti-imperialist
position, China, Vietnam and Cuba are regarded as the leaders
of worldwide struggles against United States imperialism whereas
the Soviet Union is held to be revisionist and also imperialist.

At the June, 1969, SDS National Convention, Progressive *
Labor Party (PLP) ferces in the organization were expelled 7
As a result, the National Office (NO) group maintained its.
National Headquarters at 1608 West Madison Street, Chicago,
and the PLP Zaction set up headquarters in Cambridge,
Massachusetts. This headquarters subsequently moved to
Boston. Each group elected its own national officers, which
include three national secretaries and a National” Interim
Committee of eight, Both the NO forces and the PLP forces
claim to be the true SDS, Both groups also print their
versions of "New Left Notes" which sets forth the line and the
program of the particular faction. The NO version of "New
Left Notes" was recently printed under the title "The Fire
Next Time’ to achieve a broader mass uppeal,

Two major factions have developed internally within
_ the NO group, namely, the Weatherman or Revolutionary Youth
Movement (RYH) I faction, and the RYM II faction. Weatherman
is action-oriented upholding Castro's“position that the duty
of revolutionaries is to make revolution, Weatherman is
regarded by RYH II as an adventuristic, alitist faction which
denies the historical role of the working class as the base
Zor revolution, RYM II maintains that revolution, although
desired, is not possible under present conditions, hence

emphasizes organizing and raising the political consciousness
of the working. class upon whom they feel successful revolution
depends, Although disclaiming control and domination by the
Communist Party, USA, leaders in these two factions have in
the past preclaimed themselves to be communists and to follow
the precepts of a Marxist-Leninist philosophy, along Pro-
Chinese communist lines.

A second source has advised that the PLP Zaction which
is more commonly known as the Worker Student Alliance is dominate
an@ controlled by members of the PLP, who are required to
identify themselves with the pro-Chinese Marxist-Leninist
philosophy of the PLP. They advocate that an alliance between.
workers and students is vital to the bringing about of a
revolution in the United States.

SDS regions and university and college chapters,
although operating under the outlines of the SDS National
Constitution, are autonomous in nature and free to carry out
independent policy reflective of local conditions. Because
of this autenomy internal struggles reflecting the major factiona
interests of SDS have oceurred.at the chapter level since
the beginning of the 1969-70 school year.

PROGRESSIVE LABOR PARTY

The "New York Times" city edition, Tuesday, April 20,
1965, page 27, reported that a new party of “revolutionary
socialism" was tormally founded on \pril 18, 1965, under the
name of the Progressive Labor Party (PLP) which had been known
as the Progressive Labor Movemmnt,

According to the article, "The Progressive Labor
Movement was founded in 1962, by MILTON ROSEN and MORTIMER
SCHEER after they were expelled from the Cammunist Party of the
United States for assertedly following the Chinese Communist
line."

A source advised on June 3, 1968, that the PLP held
its Second National, Convention in New York City, May 31 to
‘dune 2,°1968, at which time the PLP rea erted its objective
of the establishment of uw militant working class movement
based on Marxism-Leninism. This is to be accomplished through
the Party's over-all revolutionary strategy of raising the
consciousness of the people and helping to provide ideological
leadership in the working class struggle for state ‘power.

The source also advised that at the Second National
Convention MILTON ROSEN was unanimously re-elected National
Chairman of the PLP and LEVI LAUB, FRED JEROME, JARED ISRAEL,
WILLIAM EPTON, JACOB ROSEN, JEFFREY GORDON, and WALTER LINDER
were elected as the National Comeittee to lead the PLP until
the next convention,

The PLP publishes "Progressive Labor," a bimonthly”
magazine; "World Revolution,” a quarterly periodical; and
"Challenge-Desufio,” a monthly newspaper.

The April, 1969, issue of "Challenge-Desafio" sets
forth that "Challenge is dedicated to the peoples fight for a
new way of life--where the working men and women control their
.-own homes and factories; where they themselves make up the entire
‘government. on every level und control the schools, courts, police
and all institutions which are now used to control them."

Source ‘advised’on May 8, 1969, that the PLP utilizes

‘an address of General Post Office Box 80%, Hrookiyn, New York,
and-also utilizes an ‘office in Room 617, i “nion Square West,

AFRICAN-AMBRICAN HERITAGE ASSOCIATION

A source advised on May 14, 1969, that the African-~
American Heritage Association (AAHA) was known as the
Afro-American Heritage Association until February, 1961.
It was founded by ISHMAEL FLORY around 1958 and incorporated
in the State of Illinois as a non-profit organization. I[t
was founded ostensibly for the purpose of teaching African
history and culture to American Negroes. AAHA is strongly
influenced by the Communist Party (CP) of Iilinois. It is
represented by both communist and non-communist members and
sone people with strong Negro nationalistic tendencies. This
organization xeflects CP policy on some issues and opposes CP-
policy on others; for example, the CP rejects the concept of —
Afro-American as a reference term to the American Negro and
rejects aspects of nationalism, both of which are reflected
in the AAHA program. FLORY its a member of the CP of [Yilinois
and theoretically under the discipline of the CP, He is the
guiding force in AAHA and controls policy and decisions in AAHS4.
CP representatives occasionally are featured at AAHA affairs.

A second source adviséd on May 14, 1969, that the
headquarters of AAHA are presently located at 416 West 63rd
Street, Chicago, Illinois.

The above source advised that the Afr'Am Book Store,
a branch of the Hodern Book Store, is ulso located at AAHA
and that this book store is managed by ISHMAEL FLORY.

A third source advised on Nay 8, 1969, that ISHMAEL
FLORY, a current CP member, continues«to be the leader of
“AAHA and as such makes policies and decisions fer AAHA. The
South Central Freedom of the Press Comittee, CP of Illinois,
also participates in foraulating the policies of AAHA,

ADMINISTRATIVE DIVISION

1, FEDERAL EMPLOYEES HEALTH BENEFITS ACT OF 1959 - FBI CANNOT
ABSORB ANY COSTS INCIDENT THERETO

The provisions of this new legislation, which was enacted by the
86th Congress, First Session, and approved by the President, become effective
July 1, 1960.

Its purpose is to provide health insurance for Federal employees,
annuitants, and their families. Employees will have the option of selecting from
four health plans. with a wide range of benefits. The legislation provides that the
Government will contribute 50% of the premium ree of the plan selected, subject
to stated minimum and maximum ranges.

We cannot accurately estimate the cost to the FBI of these new
benefits until the Civil Service Commission has dealt with the insuring groups
to determine the cost of the plans and until the employees have selected the
desired coverage. Preliminary estimates, however, indicate an added cost of
approximately $1,000,000 per year to the FBI as the employer's cost of these
new benefits, based on the Bureau's experience derived from the operation of its:
present health coverage plan.

The appropriation request of this Bureau represents an absolute
minimum figure. All avenues of possible savings were thoroughly explored in
arriving at the minimum figure requested. As a result, it will be impossible
for the FBI to absorb any part of the added cost resulting from the Federal
Employees Health Benefits Act of 1959,

2, ADMINISTRATION'S 2% SAVINGS PROGRAM, FISCAL YEAR 1960.
———E—————————————————

Budget Director Stans, in a letter dated September 21, 1959, to
the Attorney General, stated the President had asked him to request the continued
cooperation of thé Attorney General in reducing civilian employment in the Govern-
ment, The letter pointed out that during the fiscal year 1959 executive agencies
effected a 2% reduction in employment and that the President would like to effect
a similar reduction in the fiscal year 1960, and requests the Attorney General to
give personal direction to the program and to plan his operations so as to accomplish

NW 65360 Docld:32989646 Page 491



it. The reduction would be effected by not filling vacancies as they occur and:

by not establishing new positions. The letter further directs that agency plans
for personnel reductions or facts as to why an agency head believes the requested
2% reduction is impracticable be presented to the Budget Bureau with the
October financial plan.

In connection with the 2% savings program in effect during the fiscal
year 1959, the Bureau advised the Attorney General that ‘it would be impossible
to make any such reduction as the Bureau's operations were already on a "strict
austerity" basis. :

The Department cut our fiscal year 1961 budget request by $400, 000,
reducing it from $117, 500, 000 to $117, 100,000, thereby eliminating 45 employees
for the field (30 Special Agents and 15 clerks).

The Bureau is in no position to effect a 2% reduction in.personnel
during fiscal year 1960. Our work loads in all categories continue to be heavy
with no sign of any abatement. Legislation enacted in the closing days of Congress,
specifically the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959, will
further bolster our work volumes for which funds’ have not been provided and to
attempt to reduce our personnel by 2% would seriously impair this Bureau's
ability to discharge its responsibilities in all fields of work.

3. SALARY RETENTION ACT, PUBLIC LAW 85-737

This act provides a two-year period of salary retention for employees
demoted through no fault of their own if they have occupied a higher paying position
for two years or longer. This act has caused a most inequitable situation by
requiring employees who accepted temporary promotions to be paid more than
permanent employees who are doing identical work, By memorandum dated
July 17, 1959, we urged the Department to recommend Jegislation so as to change

. this situation ‘at the earliest possible time. To date no legislation has been
introduced which would effect the desired correction of this inequitable situation.

INVESTIGATIVE DIVISION

1, Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 (Public Law
86-257)

The new labor law, as above, became effective upon its signing
by the President on September 14, 1959.

The language in the Act conferred authority upon the Secretary of
Labor to conduct investigations of the majority of the provisions contained
in the law. Authority was also granted to the Secretary of Labor to enter
into agreements with other agencies to handle investigations.

The Criminal Division of the Department of Justice during September,
1959, has held conferences with officials. of the Department of Labor for the
purpose of arriving at an agreement to be signed by the Departments of Justice
and Labor specifying those criminal provisions of the law, as well as the
prohibition against a member of the Communist Party holding office in a
labor union, which the FBI will investigate.

Preliminary conferences indicate investigative jurisdiction of the
following violations will be conferred upon the Bureau _

Embezzlement of union funds; payment by an employer of a fine
imposed upon a labor union officer; prohibition against communists and
convicted felons holding union office; picketing for extortion purposes;
deprivation by force or violence of rights of union members; and retention by
FBI of an amendment in the Act broadening the Labor-Management Relations
Act of 1947.

The finalizing of the agreement between the Domaine of Justice
and Labor has not been effected. Untilitis, we are not initiating investi~
" gations without a specific request from the Department of Justice.

We have, however, received 85 specific'requests from the Criminal
Division to determine whether certain convicted felons are holding office at
this time in labor unions in violation of that section of the Act (Section 504).

We have also received 52 names of individuals who are reportedly
labor union officials, from the Department, requesting a check of Bureau and
Identification Division files. Eighteen such name checks have been completed.
These were highly placed Teamster officials and trustees. We are not
processing the remaining 34 names until the Department provides us with
further identifying data as to the individuals.

2, FEDERAL CLEARINGHOUSE OF CRIMINAL INFORMATION

. Various proposals have been brought forth in the past
by individuais such as Senator Kefauver, Chief William Parker of
the Los Angeles Police Department, Milton Wessel of the Department,
and Senator McClellan for the establishment of a central Federal
clearinghouse of information on crime. More recently New York
State Attorney General Louis J. Lefkowitz has proposed a clearing-
. house of information concerning frauds on the consumer and
* investor public.

Our position in the past has consistently been that there
is no need for such a clearinghouse and that the necessary and
desirable dissemination of criminal-type information is already
being accomplished within the framework of existing law enforcement
structures,

Some of the serious objections to such a proposed
clearinghouse are that it would be an unwarranted intrusion of
the Federal Government into local affairs. There is the possibility
that such a clearinghouse would provide an official medium for the
dissemination of unverified data consisting of rumor and gossip
and that corrupt and irresponsible individuals would be presented
with the opportunity to use such information for purposes of blackmail
or extortion. In addition to the foregoing, the establishment of such
a clearinghouse would constitute a costly superstructure on already
existing facilities and could result in the establishment of a "black
list" characterizing certain individuals as violators on the basis of
information not completely verified or authenticated.

The Bureau already disseminates on a daily basis
innumerable items of information to local, county, state and
Federal agencies, This information may ‘hot only relate to matters
over which we have jurisdiction but extends to any items which may
be of interest to other agencies. The channels for dissemination of
information are already established and the use of these.channels by
all agencies would appear to obviate the need for any central clearing -
house of information.

NW 65360 Docld:32989646 Page 494



¥

3, NEED FOR CRIMINAL-TYPE LEGISLATION

Since April 30, 1958, the Bureau has suggested certain items
of legislation relative to establishing some effective curbs on the activities of
racketeers, The most recent communication to the Department in this regard
was a memorandum to Deputy Attorney General Walsh dated September 2,
1959, captioned "Legislative Program, Eighty-sixth Congress, Second Session, "
These legislative suggestions are as follows:

L There appears to be a need for legislation to prohibit the
interstate transportation of certain gambling paraphernalia, such as number
slips and punch boards in addition to the present prohibition of interstate
transportation of slot machines,

2. It also appears the interstate transmission of gambling.
information should be restricted to prohibit the transmission of gambling
’ information in interstate or foreign commerce by any communication facility.
Such legislation should also encompass the transmission of information as to
the results of horse racing events until after a specified time had elapsed.
The inability to have current race results would discotirage the operations of
bookmaking establishments.

3. Inasmuch as under the present provisioris of the Internal
Revenue Code income derived from illegal businesses and from gambling
constitutes income which is taxable and assessed in the same manner as
legitimate income, it appears that if the income from such illicit sources were
taxed at vastly higher rates it might make such activities financially prohibitive.
Inasmuch as certain individuals would attempt to avoid such taxes, it might
be desirable to initiate legislation to provide substantial criminal penalties for
the failure to pay such taxes,

4, It also appears legislation may be desirable to amend the:
White Slave Traffic Act in order that the prostitute herself could be prosecuted,
There is considerable activity among those who are engaged in this livelihood
and who go from state to state in order to ply their trade,

5. As an added weapon against organized crime, it appears it
may be desirable to afford consideration to the. enactment of a Federal habitual
criminal act which would provide for mandatory sentences upon the commission
of offenses within Federal jurisdiction,

In addition, the Bureau is in agreement with the Administration's
theory of amending the Fugitive Felon Act to include damage by fire or-
explosives to religious or educational facilities. The House Judiciary Committee
has failed to approve this proposal and has adopted a bill (H.R. 8601) which would
prohibit damage to any building, structure, facility, vehicle or dwelling house.

NW 65360 Docld:32989646 Page 495 5:



7

It is our view that such legislation should be restricted to cover educational
and religious facilities only. This was called to the Department's attention
by the afore-mentioned memorandum dated September 2, 1959, captioned
"Legislative Program, Eighty~sixth Congress, Second Session. ”

BOMESTIC INTELLIGENCE DIVISION

On March 12, 1959, the Director attended a conference in the Attorney
General's office in connection with current security programs and matters
collateral thereto. The Director expressed the view that security programs
had been held in abeyance in the Department of Justice with the result that
other agencies of the Government were taking advantage of such delays and
offering as excuses for nonaction the fact that the Department of Justice
had not yet indicated what should be done or should not be done in view of
some decisions of the courts and anticipated decisions of the courts, The
Director urged that basic action should be taken on certain of these programs.
While some of these matters have been acted upon, others are still pending and

- ave set forth below for the Director's information.

(i) Industrial Security Program - At the time of the March conference it
was decided to wait until the Greene and Taylor cases had gone through the
Supreme Court. This has now occurred and the Supreme Court has indicated
that there was not proper authority for an Iustrial Security Program flowing
from the President or the Congress. The Court also strongly indicated that
even with such authority that there was a need for confrontation of witnesses
at such hearings. To meet this, the Administration is discouraging legislation
and approaching the matter through an Executive Order, two drafts of which
have been examined by the Department and the Bureau. The proposed Order
appears impractical in some respects and Yeagley of the Department has advised
us that the Attorney General and the Solicitor General do not like the Order as
drafted, particularly the "special counsel" concept and Deputy Attorney General
Walsh is being instructed to "bounce the Order back to the White House." By
letter dated September 30, 1959, to the Attorney Gneral, copies to Walsh and
Yeagley, the Bureau went on record that while we would attempt to live up to
any Order, the Department should carefully consider the position of the Department
and the Bureau under the proposed Order in that we would be forced to turn
down numerous requests to produce informants and sdurces for testimony or
interview in view of our overriding responsibility to protect their identities in
the interests of national security, This might open the Department and the
Bureau up to criticism that we were not living up to the spirit of the Executive
Order. ns
From the standpoint of the conference with the Attorney General on
October 6, we think the Bureau's position should be that the Industrial Security Pro-
gram problem should be settled either through Executive Order or legislation;



SEs

7 a .

Domestic Intelligence Division

that whichever means is used must be practical and not merely drawn up’ in
a visionary manner in an attempt to satisfy the Supreme Court but end up
by placing the investigative agencies in an untenable position because they-
cannot comply with the spirit of the Order.

(2) Port Security Program - There has been no change in the Port Security
Program with the exception that Treasury Department has drafted proposed :
legislation to enable the Coast Guard to subpoena and pay the travel expenses of
witnesses to appear at Coast Guard hearings, Treasury has indicated this
bill is in the Bureau of the Budget. At the March 12, 1959, conference the
Director pointed out that positive action should be taken toward getting such
legislation and the confrontation issue should not be used as an excuse to scrap
the program because the FBI had supplied a substantial number of witnesses
.who could appear and testify. The Bureau's position should be the same;
namely, that the wherewithal should be devised to carry forth the program instead
of scrapping it. It should be borne in mind that in Port Security hearings as
in many other security-type hearings the question of confrontation will continue
to. be an issue and the pattern set by the Executive Order in the Industrial
Security Program will probably be applied to the other types of security hearings.

(3) Air Crewmen Screening Program - The Air Crewmen Screening
Program is a program proposed by ICIS to screen crews of United States planes
engaged in international flights and to screen all holders of Airmen's Certificates.
The ICIS also proposed the Federal Communications Commission Radio Screening

_ Program which would require the screening of all operators of radio transmitters.
To our knowledge, nothing has been done on either of these programs since the
March, 1959, conference with the Attorney General, While the FBI originally
concurred that these programs would be helpful, we have not pushed them,
believing this is a proper function of ICIS. It is believed the Bureau's position
should be that a decision should be reached as to whether these programs should
be implemented and they should not be allowed to hang fire on the basis that
they might not be agreeable or acceptable to the Supreme Court. In other words,
security programs should not be left in a status of hiatus because of pending
judicial decisions.

(4) Persqnnel Security Program - The March, 1959 conference discussed

the Personnel Security Program, particularly whether there should be legislation
to provide for an over-all security program which would cover both sensitive

-8-

NW 65360 Doctd:32989646 Page 493



Domestic Intelligence Division

and nonsensitive areas. This is still an undecided issue although several bills
have been introduced into Congress to remove the distinction between sensitive
and nonsensitive areas of Federal employment. Undoubtedly, the Greene
decision in-the Supreme Court carrying the strong inference that confrontation
is necessary in security-type hearings has slowed up consideration of legislation
in this field by the Department. This is essentially a Departmental problem

and we feel the Bureau's position again should be that the Department should
meet these issues rather than coast along in a state of indecision.

(5) In the field of legislation involving security, by letter dated September 2,
1959, the Bureau proposed to Deputy Attorney General Walsh the following items,
“which the Director might wish to point out to the Attorney General. While bills
were introduced into Congress on some of these items, legislation has not been
completed as to any of them.

(a) Ibis desirable that Title 18, Section 791, United States Code, be
amended to extend the jurisdiction of the Federal courts over acts of espionage
against the United States wherever committed.

(b) Amendment of the Foreign Agents Registration Act to clarify
and make more specific the definition of a "Foreign Principal" and to further
clarify the exemption to registration afforded business representatives.

(c) Legislation is suggested which would permit the Secretary of
State to consider security factors in the granting of passports; however,
appropriate provisions should be made to protect FBI informants and sources
in this connection. This matter is mentioned in the Bureau's memorandum
to Walsh dated May 26, 1959, regarding H. R. 7006.

(a) Another suggestion is legislation to strengthen the Smith Act of
1940 by defining the word "organize" and the word "advocacy. "A definition
of "organize" was introduced as H. R. 2369 andas S. 1300. S. 1305 attempts
to define "advocacy."

(e) “Legislation is needed which would prohibit former Government
employees from disclosing to unauthorized individuals certain information
obtained by them in the course of their employment.

(f) Legislation is needed to amend the espionage laws so as to
provide punishment for persons who gather and correlate data from legitimate
sources for transmittal to foreign governments,

L-WW.65360-Docid:32089648 Page 499


Domestic Intelligence Division

(6) In addition to the above, the Director may wish to point out to the
Attorney General the tendency on the part of the Department of Justice, :
as well as Government departments in general, to shy away from pursuing

- logical courses of action in the security field rather than to implement necessary

security programs, this tendency apparently based on attempts to anticipate
decisions by the Supreme Court. The net effect of this is that the Supreme
Court is not required to meet these issues and render decisions and thus,
historically, to take responsibility for them. It is our feéling it is a far better
course of action to attempt to implement those programs necessary for our
national security and give ground grudgingly and only where forced to do so
so that the record will show that the Department and the FBI sought to

carry outtheir responsibilities in a proper manner.

This is the case in which a half million dollars
of Teamsters Union funds were transferred to a Florida bank
in 1956, which then made loans in a’ similar amount to Sun
Valley, Inc., a Florida real estate development in which
Hoffa had an option to purchase 45 per cent of the stock,
During the past week Hoffa furnished this option, which is
dated April 15, 1955, to the McClelian Committee, claiming
he had recently located it in his old records.

Teamsters Union records were subpoenaed for
production before the grand jury in Washington, D. C.
January 14, 1960. Some records were produced in response
to the subpoena and others are said to be in the possession
of the McClellan Committee, The Criminal Division will
obtain such records from the McClellan Committee. Our
Washington Field Office is making an accounting investigation
of the records that were produced before the grand jury and
will examine those the Criminal Division obtains from the
McClellan Committee,

The Criminal Division has arranged to have another

grand jury impanelled to take testimony in this case at
{ Orlando, Florida, beginning February 15, 1960. The Criminal
Division expects this grand jury will be in session at least

sixty days. i a

U. S. Attorney, John Strickler at Roanoke, Virginia,
insisted upon prosecution of all four for Theft of Government

This case was referred to us by the Attorney General
on 12/31/59. It relates to the association between John George
Ledes, a former legal advisor to Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) Commissioner James E. Sargent, and Joseph
Abrams, a New York promoter of unsavory reputation.

We have reviewed voluminous SEC files here and in
New York and have interviewed numerous persons in and out of
SEC who handledcases involving Abrams' firms. We determined
that Ledes endeavored to assist Abrams in several SEC matters
while Ledes was still with that agency, We are now engaged
in interviewing additional persons with possible pertinent
knowledge of the association and in the detailed job of tracing
Ledes' financial transactions through bank, realty and other
records to pin down specifics of loans from Abrams to Ledes
relative to financing properties purchased by Ledes. Abrams'
loans may constitute payment of compensation to Ledes and thus
bring their relationship within the scope of the Conflict of
Interest Statutes.

It is noted we have been told that both Ledes and
Abrams were associated with Tony Russo, ex-confidential
/assistant to former Attorney General Brownell. Russo has not
been alleged to be involvéd in any irregularities in this matter.

The case is being given top priority in handling both
in the field and at the Seat of Government.

ca CIVIL RIGHTS :

This is the case concerning which Acting Assistant
Attorney General Joseph iM. F. Ryan, Jr., Civil Rights Division,
made a press release on 1/14/60 stating that the FBI has been
a to investigate this matter.

By memorandum 1/14/60, Mr. Ryan requested a preliminary
investigation based upon a news article in the “Washington Post
and Times Herald," 1/12/60, and an editorial in the same paper,
1/13/60, regarding an incident in Montgomery County Peoples Court
wherein one Gordon L., Contee became violent when convicted of
rape. He was subdued by officers but Melvin Smith, Contee's
19-year-old half brother, rushed forward from the audience and
struck frank Griggs, an.officer who was subduing Contee. It was
alleged that Smith was beaten by the officers while being taken
to jail after his assault on Griggs.

Colonel James S. McAuliffe, superintendent, Montgomery
County Police, Melvin L. Reese, Montgomery Camty Manager, and
Luke Bennett, sheriff, have all been notified that the Bureau
has undertaken investigation of this-matter.

Pertinent court records were not available over the
week end but will be reviewed 1/18/60. The Montgomery County
Police Department reports have not yet been made available, but
State's Attorney Leonard T. Kardy is meeting with County Manager
Reese and County Police Superintendent McAuliffe 1/18/60 to discuss
making these records available.

Subjects’ attorneys have advised them to make no
statement except in attorneys' presence. Subjects Griggs, Bechtel
and Dovries have advised they are represented by Barnard T.

Welsh and will confer with him to determine whether they should
furnish statements. Ps

‘The victim has been interviewed and admits striking
subject Griggs in the eye while in court and then running from
the courtroom. He was caught in the hall and while being taken
up a narrow stairway by Devries and an unknown officer, they
met subjécts Griggs, Offutt and Bechtel. Griggs, who had a
night stick, allegedly said, "That's the one who hit me in the
nose."' As the victim passed Griggs, he was hit on the head with
a hard object but did not see who hit him. As he turned around,
Griggs hit him on the head with the night stick. Offutt then hit
him with his fist above the left eye and Bechtel kicked him on the
leg. Devries hit him on the back with his fist. The beta was not
handcuffed at the time et Sh he ottered any resistance.

Dr. William Frank treated the victim on 12/17/59 and
found two superficial lacerations at the back of the head which
were closed by two stitches each. No other injuries were noted
and Smith complained of no otherinjuries. Officer Devries told
Dr. Frank that the lacerations were caused by a night stick.

DAMAGE TO NUCLEAR SUBMARINE "NAUTILUS," NUCLEAR
CRUISER "LONG BEACH" AND GUIDZD NISSILZ FRIGATE "LUCE" -
SABOTAGE

The Boston Office is investigating three cases involving
possible sabotage in connection with the three captioned vessels of -
the United States Navy. :

Between 9-28-59 and 10-19-59 numerous cuts were found in
the electrical cables of the nuclear submarine "Nautilus," which was
being overhauled at Portsmouth, New Hampshire. On 11~12-59 foreign
material was found in a pump on the "Nautilus." The Boston Office
has interviewed the entire crew of the "Nautilus" and over 1,500 ship-
yard employees,submitted numerous cut cables for Laboratory examination
and used the polygraph in connection with pertinent interviews.

On 1-5-60 nine small cuts were discovered in the degaussing
cables (protection against magnetic mines) of the nuclear cruiser
"Long Beach;' which is being constructed at Quincy, Massachusetts.
These cuts contain no identifying marks for Laboratory comparison
with tools. As of 1-1h-60, 2,1) of over 5,000 employees having
access to this vessel had been interviewed.

On 12-28-59, 21 cuts were found in the fire control wiring
| of the guided missile frigate "Luce," which is also being constructed
| at Quincy, Massachusetts. This damage was not reported to us or to
the Office of Naval Intelligence until 1-11-60 as the damage was
originally considered probably inadvertent. In view of the other
two cases involving cut. cables, the Boston Office has opened an
investigation on this matter also.

The type of damage involved or the lack-of any attempt to
hide or disguise the damage may be indicative qf employees attempting
| to create more work or of disgruntled Navy personnel. The Boston
Office has been instructed to afford these cases vigorous intensive
investigation.

BERWARD J. GOLDFINE

Although we are not inuolved in the Goldfine matter,
this case ts currently the subject of a great deal of discussion
between the Lax Division and the Treasury Department.

The Goldfine tax fraud investigation, according to
our Treasury sources, ts scheduled to go before grand jury in
Boston next month. Goldfine and his nine New England companies
owe the Government approximately eight million dollars. This,
of course, includes interest, 6%3 delinquency penalties, 25%;
and fraud penalty, 50% You will recall that the approximate
JSigure appeared in the newspapers and the Goldfine defense
charged that-.this was an attempt on the part of the Governnent
to try its case in the newspapers. No action was taken by
Treasury to look into this alleged leak of information on the
request of the Tar Division of Justice since the total figure of
Goldfine's delinquency had been discussed with Goldfine and his
tax attorneys. It was felt that they could have planted the
story in the press. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has also
established a tax case on Goldfine's son, Horace, which approximates
$99,000 delinquency, and a similar case has been made on Mildred
Paperman, Goldfine'’s confidential assistant.

Of course, as previously reported, IPS has established
a failure to file criminal violation on Goldfine for the wars
1955, 1956, and 1957. However, since this is a nisdemeanor,
Justice had waited until the tax fraud investigation was developed
in order to go ahead with its prosecution. The one weakness in
the tax fraud case is proving knowledge and culpability directly
to Gohdfine., IRS feels that he will argue thet his taz ajifairs
‘were nandled by a competent tax jirm and he had every right to
feel that his tax affairs were being handle@ within the law.

In addition to the tax fraud investigation, the Inspection.

Service of IRS léoked into the Goldfine matter to determine the
extent of any trregularities or misconduct on the part of Revenue
employees., Ihe inuestigation has not developed any criminal
violations on the part of IRS employees. The reporé does rej‘lect
gross administrative fatlures and irregularities in the handling

of work tn the Boston Region. Much of this was due to the fact

that Goldfine assigned ell of his taz matters in the New England
area to Lawrence P, Harrington, a former IRS employee. Harrington

62 -Pils6 ~ f.

NW 65360 Docld:32989646 Page 510



r : e

knew the policy and procedure of I2S and avoided those procedures
which might detect Goldfinets delinquencies. In addition, he

used Goldfine's high-level connections in scaring off IRS
investigators whenever an inquiry was made ‘concerning Goldfine's
tax affairs. You will recall, the IRS investigation has developed
gifts and monies paid to Sherman Adams, Senators Payne, Cotton,
Bridges, Governor Furculo, and forner Governor Dever of
Massachusetts, as well as Congressman McCormack, and many other
New England local and state political figures.

INDUSTRIAL SECURITY PROGRAM

i Following the Supreme Court decision in the Greene

H case.on June 29, 1959, prolonged efforts to prepare a
Presidential Directive to establish a@ program under which

i private contractors may be granted access to classified data

] have culminated in a draft Order dated January 7, 1960.

Budget is circulating this draft to all interested agencies.
The more recent Bureau comments concerning this matter were
forwarded by memorandum to AAG Yeagley, December 30, 1959;
by menorandun to the Attorney General, with copies to
Messrs. Walsh and Yeagley, January 6, 1960; by memorandum,
January 11, 1960, to Mr. Yeagley; and by memorandum oj
January 14, 1960, to Assistant Attorney General Kramer, with
copy to ur. Yeagley. The last two of these communt cations
both concerned the same draft which is now being circulated
by Budget.

In brief, we have noted that under the proposed Order
agenctes may consider all of the pertinent information available
regardless of source. Under Section 4 A 1 protection is
afforded to regular confidential informants, Under Section 4 A 2
information from persons other than current informants may be
constdered if they cannot appear due to death, severe tillness,
or some such other good and sufficient cause. It is apparent
that information from casual informants who refuse to testify ~<
cannot be used under this section.

Section 5 B, according to Mr. Yeagley, would allow
use of data from wire taps, microphones, and other sensitive
techniques. Mr. Yeagley has indicated, however, that such
data would have to be produced in the form of actual quotations
from the conversations rather than the paraphrased form in
which we disseminate this information. Wet believe it will not
be possible for us to furnish other than paraphrased information
in most instances because of the absolute necessity of protecting
our sources. :

«fven though data from casual informants and sensitive
techniques may not be used as tndicated above, Section 9 of the
Order grants and affirms the department head concerned authority

NW 65360 Docld:32989646 Page 512



ar : e.

to exercise control over the Nation's military and defense
secrets and nothing in the rest of the Order is deemed to

limit or affect his responsibility and powers in this regard.

Use of such authority and power will permit the department

head to act in those instances in which derogatory data is
available but cannot be utilized under the procedures established
tn the balance of the Order. We have observed to the Department
that it has undoubtedly considered the public reaction should it
turn out that it is necessary to use this summary power ina
majority of cases.

We have several times reiterated that FBI will
respect the confidence placed in tt by both regular informants
or other persons and will not disclose their identity without
their specific permission. We have summarized by stating
that from our standpoint, the Order as drafted, will permit
us to furnish all avatlable data to appropriate agencies as in
the past and provides appropriate protection for our confidential
tnformants. Data from any casual informants and from highly
sensitive techniques will largely be usable only under Section 9.
We have stated that the Bureau’ does not object to the proposed
Order from an operational standpoint.

| On January 14, John Doherty of the Department informed
us of a very minor addition, Proposed by Philip Areeda of the

| White House,-:which was discussed in memorandum of January 15.
This addition would not affect the comments we have previously
made concerning thts Order.

PROTECTING IDENTITY OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMANTS
CONFRONTATION ISSUE

7 The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments on two
cases inuoluing hearings and the right of confrontation on
January 18, 1960. The cases involve Hannah us. Lareche and
Hannah us. Slawson. Solicitor General Rankin will argue the cases
: for the Government. :

The cases inuolve the President's Givil Rights Gommission
which was established by the Federal Civil Rights Act of 1957
to investigate charges of citizens being discriminatorily deprived
of the right to vote. The question raised for the Supreme Court
is whether the Civil Rights Act of 1957 authorizes the Civil Rights
: Commission to conduct hearings wherein state registrars and
| private citizens accused of depriving others. of the right to vote
are dented notice of charges against them and confrontation.

Although the hearings held by the Civil Rights
Commission are inuestigative rather than judicial or punitive
such as the normal Government hearing, the argument and the
Supreme Court decision in these cases could shed some light
on the issue of confrontation as well as the investigative agency's
right to protect the tdentity of confidential informants. This
ts particularly true in view of the current negotiations to
produce an Executive Order in relation to the Industrial Security
Program.

These are the two cases which the "Washington Post"
| commented upon editorially on December 14, 1959, supporting the
Civil Rights Commission's hearing procedures in that it was :
necessary that the Commission protect their confidential informants

from reprisals by segregationists. The "Washington Evening Star”

on January 11, 1960, in reporting the Attorney General's first

trip to argue a case before the Supreme Court on the constitutional ity
of the Federal Civil Rights Act commented that the above cases would
prove more difficult for the Government to argue and obtain a
favorable deciston. -

SEIZURE POWERS IN NEUTRALITY CASES

The Department for about a year has been
negotiating to obtain for us seizure powers under Title 22,
Section 401, United States Code,. which would enable us to
seize arms, munitions of war and other articles about
to be exported in violation of law and follow through
to final conclusion in the investigation of neutrality
cases, This was to be accomplished through the issuance
of an Executive Order conferring on the Attorney General

owers to seize under this statute which in turn would
e delegated to the FBI by the Attorney General.

On November 19, 1959, the Attorney General
advised that the Treasury Department had agreed to the
| bichdey Executive Order. The Department advised on

ecember 23, 1959, that the proposed Executive Order
‘had been sent by the Attorney General to the President
. through the director of the Bureau of the Budget for
approval by letter dated December 16, 1959.

On January 15, 1960, pursuant to our inquiry
concerning the current status of this matter, Assistant
Attorney General Walter Yeagley advised that the proposed
Executive Order is presently in the Bureau of the Budget
which has sent it to certain agencies for comment.
Yeagley advised that the Bureau of the Budget had heard
from the Treasury Department but had not received replies
from the Office of Civil and Defense Mobilization, Department of
Defense and the State Department. He advised that he

| could not understand why the Office of Civil and Defense
Mobilization or the Department of Defense would have any
comment on this and stated he was going to check with .

Commissioner James C. Sargent and Abrams, a New York promoter of
unsavory reputation. Ledes resigned from Reynolds and Company,
New York brokers, on 1-28-60.

that Ledes endeavored to-assist Abrams in several SEC matters
while Ledes.was still with that agency. Abrams made loans to
Ledes relative to financing properties purchased by Ledes. ‘These
loans may constitute payment of compensation to Ledes and thus
bring their relationship within the scope of Conflict of Interest
Statutes,

SEC Commissioner Sargent, who originally denied knowledge
as to any connection between Ledes and Abrams, has since improved
his memory considerably and now feels he may have been taken
advantage of by Ledes. Sargent finally furnished a signed state~
ment as to his recollection of these matters on 2=5-60. Sargent

arranged for former Attorney General Brownell to talk to Attorney
General Rogers in July, 1958, about Sargent!s ambition at the time
to become U. S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York.

CRASH OF NATIONAL AIRLINES FLIGHT 967
GULF OF MEXICO, NOVEMBER 16, 1959
DESTRUCTION GF AIRCRAFT OR MOTOR VEHICLES
INTERSTATE TRANSPORTATION GF CTOLEN MOTOR VEHICLE

On November 16, 1959, a plane with 42 persons aboard,
owned by Delta Air Lines but staffed with a National Airlines
crew, plunged into the Gulf of Mexico while on_a flight from
Tampa, Florida, to New Orleans, Louisiana. Only ten of the
victims were identified and the other bodies have not been
recovered,

On January 17, 1960, we initiated a full-scale
investigation in this matter. It had been alleg2d that
Dr. Robert V. Spears, an ex-convict with a long criminal - -
record who had been reported as a passenger on the plane, had
induced his friend and former partner in crime, William Allen
Taylor of Tampa, Florida, to board the plane in his place.’
Spears had over $100,000 worth of insurance with his wife as
beneficiary and Taylor: purchased $37,500 worth of flight
insurance just prior to the trip with his son as beneficiary.

From the first, our investigation was directed at
finding Spears or Taylor since this appeared to be a key point
-in our investigation. Spears was located by Bureau Agents in
Fhoenix, Arizona, on January 20, 1960, and. charged with the
Interstate Transportation of a Stolen Motor Vehicle (ETSMY).
Spears admitted Taylor took his place on the ill-fated plane
and that following the crash he, Spears, tried to conceal his
identity. He took Taylor's car, with his alleged permission,
but admitted he had no authority to take it to Arizona and
that he and his friend, Dr. William Turska, removed the
identification number from it and tried to get a fraudulent
title for the car. Spears, with Turska, contacted Kirs. Spears
in Dallas, Texas, about January 7, 1960, and Mrs. Spears
admitted that her husband persuaded her not; to reveal the
fact that he was alive so that the insurance policies could
be paid to her as beneficiary.

January 26, 1960, when Spears was arrested in :
Phoenix, Arizona, he was charged with the Interstate Transportation
| of a Stolen Motor Vehicle for taking Taylor's car from Florida to
| Arizona. Ue was taken to the U.S. Commissioner in Phoenix on
that date and held on $35,00¢ bond. Gn February 1, 1960, Spears
was brought before the U.S. District Judge in Phoenix and

at $35,000, and February 15, 1960, was set as the date for sentencing.

| Physical evidence from the crash is extremely sparse. Since the

examination of the limited physical material found did not indicate an
explosion or the reason for the crash, it was hoped that the plane could
be located in the Gulf. If the plane could be found and examined, it might
reveal some definite physical evidence of the cause of the crash, particularly
if a bomb was involved. On January 28, 1960, salvage operations were begun
by the Navy in the Gulf of Mexico after sonar contact had located an object
which was thought to be the plane. On February 5, 1960, however, the Navy
discontinued salvage operations without locating the downed aircraft.

Following an interview with an abortionist in Dallas, Texas, who
formerly associated with Dr. Spears, the Miami Office advanced the theory
that Spears might have been in Tampa on November 13 to 15, 1959, for
the purpose of preparing an abortion formula through a process which involves
the cooking of dynamite to obtain nitroglycerin, and that Spears might have
prevailed on Taylor to transport the formula to Dallas by plane in Spears’

| place. The explosion, if there was one, might have resulted from an
accidental explosion of the abortion formula. The Laboratory has considered
this theory and has advised that it knows of no instance of the use of
nitroglycerin in preparations utilized to produce abortions. In addition,
during a reinterview with the Dallas abortionist, he advised that all of

the ingredients used by Spears in his abortion formula were stable and not
volatile or explosive.

All persons contacted in this investigation have denied any knowledge
| of the wilful destruction of the plane. Nevertheless our investigation is being
pressed to determine full facts and to uncover any violations of Federal laws
which might have occurred. The United States Attorney at Phoenix has been
kept fully advised and has under consideration the question of whether a
: | prosecutable Federal case for mail fraud exists against Dr. Spears, his wife
and/or Dr. Turska.
As of February 8, 1960, twenty-five investigative reports in this case
lee been madé available to the Department and to the Civil Aeronautics Board.

DESTRUCTION OF AIRCRAFT OR MOTOR VEHICLES

On January 6, 1950, a Nattonal Airlines DC-6B plane crashed
at Bolivia, North Carolina, killing all 84 occupants. The body of one
passenger, Julian Andrew Frank, was found about 20 miles from the crash
scene. Frank, a New York attorney, carried insurance of $997,500
H and was reportedly engaged in fraudulent activities,

| Investigation at the scene oj -the crash, tncluding examination
| of available parts of the plane reassembled in a "mock up,” has deen
conducted by Civil Aeronautics Board investigators. They have been
lanenie to reach a definite conclusion as to the cause oj the crash.

Frank's body, which was found near Kure Beach, North Carolina,
bore only remnants of clothing. The vody was mangled and the lower
portton of the left arm and of both legs were missing. His luggage,

) water reportedly consisted of a zipper-type blue flight bag and a
brown leather attache case, has not been located.

FBI Laboratory examination of Frank's right hand and part

of his right arm, foreign material removed from his hand and arm and
portions of clothing found on his body revealed no explosive residue.
Pathologists who-examtined Frank's body have advised that his body

had the appearance of having been subjected to a severe force of unusual
nature and they believe his injuries resembled blast damage but they
cannot definitely identify them as such. According to the pathologists,
similar wounds have veen odserved on victims of land mine explosions.

DAMAGE TO NUCLEAR SUBMARINE ‘ives, " NUCLEAR
CRUISER "LONG BEACH" AND GUIDED MISSILE FRIGATE "LUCE"
i SABOTAGE

The Boston Office ts investigating three cases involving
| possible sabotage to three vessels of the United States Navy.

Between 9-28-59 and 10-19-59, 279 cuts were found tn the
electrical cables of the nuclear submarine "Nautilus," which was
being overhauled at Portsmouth, New Hampshire, It has been determined
that 42 of these cuts could have been made accidentally. On 11-12-59
foreign material was found in a pump on the "Nautilus." The Boston
Office has interviewed the entire crew of the "Nautilus" and over 1,500
shipyard employees. As many of the damaged cadles as could de made
available by the Navy have been submitted for Laboratory examtnatton
and additional specimens are being submitted when they can be made
available by the Navy. The polygraph has beer used in connectior with
the interviews of suspect individuals and additional interviews using
the polygraph are being arranged.

| On 1-15-60 nine small cuts were discovered tn the degaussing

cables (protection against magnetic mines) of the nuclear cruiser
"Long Beach," which is being constructed at Quincy, Massachusetts.
These cuts contain no identifying marks for Laboratory comparison
with suspect tools. An average of 2,700 employees worked on this
vessel daily and a total of approrimately 5,000 employees had access
to it. Over 3,100 individual employees have been tnterviewed and
tnterviews are continuing, :

On 128~28-59, 21 cut wires were found in the ftre control
wiring of the guided missile frigate "Luce", which is also under
construction at Quincy, Massachusetts. This. damage was not reported
to us or to the Office of Naval Intelligence until 1-11-60 as the
damage was originally considered inadvertent. Over 14,900 employees
hdd access to the vessel. The employees assigned to the area of the
danage have been identified and are being interviewed, Other employees
known to have worked in the area are also being interviewed, The
damaged wires have been forwarded to the FBI Laboratory for exanination,

supervisory employees have expressed the opinion that this danuge is
of the nuisan&e and malicious mischief type rather than sabotage as the
damage was not hidden and was readily apparent, The Boston Office has

' Investigation concerning the "Long Beach" and "Luce" has
been delayed by a strike at the shipyard where these vessels are

have been unable to enter the shipyard due to the picket line and
thus personnel is not available to furnish the names and addresses
of employees particularly those who worked aboard the "Long Beach"
and are sttll employed, The Boston Office has been able to secure
the names and cddresses of terminated employees assigned to work
on the "Long Beach" and ts interviewing them.

INDUSTRIAL SECURITY PROGRAM

On February 2, 1960, the House passed H.R. 8121,
tntroduced by Ur. Walter, which would authorize the Secretary
of Defense to establish a program for screening employees
of private contractors for access to classified information.

: The bill states that procedures prescribed by Defense shali

be designed to protect from disclosure all infornatton which,
in the opinion of the Secretary of Defense, would affect the
national security, safety, or public interest or would tend
to compromise investigative sources or investigative methods.
The bill has been referred to the Senate Committee on the
Judictary and, tf passed, would permit Defense to reinstitute
the same program which was in effect atthe time of the
Supreme Court decision in the Greene Case. Defense could,
however, institute a'new program offering a maximum of con-
frontation while protecting sources or techniques in accordance
with the terms ofthe bill. :

On February 5, 1960, Assistant Attorney General Yeagley
forwarded a new draft of the proposed Executive Order in this
matter and stated it was the result of meetings with the. Attorney
General and the White House and that he hoped that it would
be the final draft. This draft introduced four major changes.

The first of these would permit use of information
from a so-called "casual" informant without confrontation if the
informant could not.appear due to death, severe tliness, or
some other cause determined by the head of the department to

e000. sufficient. The underlined words have been added
and would considerably broaden the circumstances under which

_tnformation from such a source might be used.

A second change, however, would require that when
an exception to confrontation was granted in the case of death
or severe tiliness, as indicated above, the identity of the
source be disclosed to the applicant. This requirement would
apply only*in the case of death or severe iliness and would not
apply to the new exception discussed in the previous paragraph.
We have repeatedly told the Department that we must respect the

aw. t #8
LAS



confidence placed in us by persons who furnish us information
and that we will not disclose their identities without their
pernisston. In the case of death or severe illness, we will
be unable to secure that permission and we do not understand
why this requirement has been added.

A third change makes it possible for either the
Attorney General or the Director to certify that an individual
ts a current confidential informant and that his disclosure
would be detrimental to the national security. The previous
draft required that this certification be made. by the Attorney
General and we consider this preferable. If the head of the
investigative agency is permitted to furnish derogatory data
and, at the same time, to decide whether the applicant is to
have an opportunity to confront the source of that data, this
procedure may be criticized both by the public and the courts.
Phis matter was discussed with the Department by Mr. Belmont
at a meeting in the Deputy Attorney General's Office on
August 81, 1959, when it was agreed that both from a@ logical
standpoint and the standpoint of the Supreme Court, .
certification concerning the need to protect an informant's
identity should be made by the Attorney General in the case
of the FBI or the appropriate department head in the case of
other investigative agencies.

The fourth change clariftes the authority of the
department head to deny or revoke access to classified data
without regard to the balance of the Order. Although the
previous draft granted this authority, the new language is an
improvement as it removes all possible doubt as to its meaning.

Our observations concerning the four changes,-.as
summarized above, were forwarded to Assistant Attorney General
Yeagley by memorandum dated February 8, 1940.

SEIZURE POWERS IN NEUTRALITY CASE:

The Department has been attempting to have
issued_an Executive Order which would give us power
under Title 22, Section 401, United States Code, to
seize arms, munitions of war and other articles about
to be exported in violation of law and follow through
to final conclusion in the investigation of neutrality
cases, The Department advised on December 23, 1959,
that the proposed Executive Order had been sent by the
Attorney General to the President through the director
byeaiae Bureau of the Budget by letter dated December 16,

Pursuant to our inquiries, the Department
determined that the proposed Executive Order had been
sent by the Bureau of the Budget to the Defense, Commerce
and State Departments and to the Office of Civil and
Defense Mobilization. It had been previously cleared with
Treasury by the Department. This matter has been closely
followed with the Department and on February 3, 1960, we
ascertained that the Budget Bureau has received replies
from all these agencies offering no objection to the
issuance of the Grder, Commerce, however, in its letter
to the Budget Bureau on February 1, 1960, a copy of which
was furnished us by the Department on February 3, 1960,
asked for assurances from the Department and the FBI that
we understood Commerce has jurisdiction under the Export
Control Act of 1949 and would keep the Commerce Department
advised of any information developed of interest to that
agency. Fl

——

A letter was sent to the Department on February 5,
1960, suggesting that the Department serfd Commerce a
letter similar to the one it previously furnished Treasury
assuring that these seizure powers would be used only in
neutrality cases and that, of course, the FBI would
furnish Commerce any pertinent information developed.
| It is assumed that upon the receipt of that letter by

Commerce the matter will then be cleared for the Fresident's
signature. :

HENRY WINSTON ;
INTERNAL SECURITY - CCMMUNIS'
SMITH ACT OF 1940

Henry Winston was one of the eleven functionaries
of the Communist Party, USA, who were convicted on Gctober
14, 1949, on a charge of conspiracy to teach and advocate the
violent overthrow of the United States Government in violation
of the Smith Act of 1940. Sentenced to five years in prison
and’ fined $16,000, Winston failed to surrender on July 2, 1951
to begin serving his sentence. He surrendered on March 5, 1956,
and received an additional three-year contempt sentence, both
ae to be served in the U. S. Penitentiary at Terre Haute,
Indiana. :

Since that time, the Communist Farty, USA, has been
conducting a continuous campaign to effect Winston's release
either through parole, executive clemency or amnesty. -Recently,
this campaign was accelerated because Winston was alleged to be
suffering from a brain tumor. On January 22, 1960, Winston was
transferred to the U. S, Medical Center, Springfield, Missouri,
where the presence of the brain tumor was confirmed. On January
30, 1960, he was removed under guard to the Montefiore Hospital,
New York City, where he underwent surgery on February 2, 1960.
The tumor was removed but as yet there has been no statement
as to malignancy, The last hospital bulletin indicates. his
condition is satisfactory and his eyesight is improving. ~

Gn January 26, 1960, a parole hearing for Winston was
held before the U. S. Board of Parole in Washington, D. C., and
several known Communists and Communist sympathizers appeared at
this hearing in Winston's behalf. Since the attorney representing
Winston claimed that his briefcase containing petitions and
signatures had been stolen, the Parole Board agreed to postpone
the hearing for one week to enable him to dupiicate the petitions.

was Reverend Elder G. Hawkins of New York City, a strong
supporter of Communist front organizatiogs. Bureau files show
that since 19406, Rev. Hawkins has been affiliated with, or has
lent support to, ten organizations designated by the Attorney
General pursuant to Executive Order 10450, as well as three
other. Communist front organizations. Following Rev. Hawkins

determine what could be done for Winston. Bennett offered
Goldman no encouragement, pointing out that it was not within
his capacity to have Winston paroled, as this matter is within
the province of the Board of Parole. Marcus Goldman has a long
history of communist associations and is considered by the
Communist Party as a "financial angel." Goldman has indicated
that at an unspecified period in the past he had been on friendly
terms with Bennett and that they used to visit each other.
Goldman further stated that the last time he wrote to Bennett
he did not receive a reply and that Bennett now, has him, Goldman,

STUART SUTOR, ET AL., :
INTERSTATE TRANSPORTATION OF
STOLEN PROPERTY; THEFT OF
GOVERNMENT PROPERTY; FEDERAL
FIREARMS ACT; NEUTRALITY MATTERS;
CONSPIRACY

On October 14, 1958, 317 weapons were stolen from the
National Guard Armory at Canton, Ohio. Approximately one-half
of these weapons were seized by Federal Officers at Morgantown,
West Virginia, as they were being flown to Florida for eventual
sale to forces of Fidel Castro in Cuba. Investigation by Bureau
Agents revealed that this theft was plotted and engineered by
henchmen of Sam Mannarino, well-known racketeer in the bittsburgh,
Pennsylvania area. Two of his principal, lieutenants Joe Merola,
former jewel thief and Norman Rothman a front man for American
| gambling interests in Cuba, were indicted along with the pilot

—

of the plane, Stuart Sutor, and three other hoodlums from the
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania area. They were charged with violations
of Theft of Government Property, Interstate Transportation of
Stolen Property, and Conspiracy.

On January 12, 1960, trial convened in U. S. District
Court, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, before Visiting U. S. District
Judge Rodger T. Foley of Judicial District, Las Vegas, Nevada.
After a trial which involved the appearance of over 85 Government
witnesses, all subjects were found guilty by the jury and on
February 4, 1960, were sentenced by the court. Subjects Sutor,
Meroler act 5 igi i2)iodanna, and Carlucci received 5-year prison
terms. Joseph Giordano, one of the lesser figures received a
3-year term, In addition lengthy suspended sentences were
imposed by the court on Sutor, Hanna, Carlucci, and Giordano.

The court immediately ordered all subjects remanded
to the custody of the U. S. Marshal, refusing bail and all motions
-by the defense for new ‘trial. It is expected that the defense
will immediately appeal this case.

RE: HOWARD LEWIS RUNDQUIST
WILLIAM J. SHERGALIS, ET AL.
REGISTRATION ACL - CUBA

7 The case involves U. S. plane piloted by two Americans,
Rundquist and Shergalis, which was shot down March 21, 1960, while
trying to smuggle four Cubans out of that country with resulting
arrest of Rundquist and Shergalise. FBI source in Miami advised
Harch 22, 1960, that incident was staged by Castro agents to provide
Castro with basis for renewed attacks against U.S. for allowing
illegal flights to Cuba. On March 23, 1960, this hoax was exposed
when Shergalis gave statement to U S. Enbassy admitting role as
Gastro agent and implicating various Cubans in U. S. and Cuba. We
conducted intensive investigation in this matter and developed
substantial evidence showing that Rundquist-Shergalis flight was,
in fact, instigated by Castro agents. Miami reports of April 1, April 6,
April 15, and May 6, 1960, covering our investigation, have been
furnished to Department and other interested agencies.

On May 3s 1960, Federal Grand Jury at Miami, which was -
convened on April 6, 1960, returned indictments against Shergalis
and Hector Garcia Soto (Cuban Air Force employee at Miami who served
as intermediary between Shergalis and Cuban intelligence officials)
charging them with violations of Foreign Agents Registration Act of
1938, as amended. Indictments were also returned against Shergalis
and Rundquist chargimg violations of Federal Aviation Act, administered
by Federal Aviation Agency, for failure to file proper flight plan
Shergalis is still in custody of Cuban officials in that country,
Cuban Government having rejected % SS. request that Shergalis and
Rundquist be extradited to face charges in this country. At time
indictments were returned, Garcia was in Cuba and, therefore,
indictments were sealed and bench warrants were issued for arrest
of Shergalis and Garciae

Garcia returned to Miami on afternoon of May 4, 1960, and
was arrested by our Miami Office at Miami International Airport.
Press release was issued SAC, Miami, concerning arrest and subsequently
on same date-Department issued press release concerning indictments
of Shergalis, Garcia and Rundquist. Arraignment of Garcia was
originally s&heduled for Hay 6, 1960, but was postponed. until
May 20, at request of defense attorney. Bond for Garcia was set
at $10,000 and on afternoon of Kay 6, 1960, bo was posted with

a “mjor to indictments, Departmental Attorney William :
c Kenney con-identially advised Miami Office on May 2,5 1960, that
he had réevomnended that, in addition to indictments against
Shergalis and Garcia, indictments also be sought against four
other individuals involved in this matter; namely, Carlos Hernandez
Lopez (Cuban nat onal serving as assistant to Garcia as Cuban
Air Force purch sing agent in Miami), Armando Jose Asencio :
(American citiz n of Cuban extraction who admittedly met with
Shergalis on G rcia's behalf on several occasions prior to .
March 21 fligt ), Roberto Millares (Cuban national who was present
at several mee ings between Shergalis and Cuban representatives),
and Roberto Fe nandez Rodriguez (Cuban Army intelligence representative
who accompanied Shergalis to Cuba in February, 1960, and
introduced him to Cuban intelligence officiais).
\

I No information has been received by Bureau indicating

that State Department exerted any influence on Justice Department

to limit prosecutive action to Shergalis and Garcia. Ié

i appears Department concluded that evidence was insufficient to

i support prosecution of Hernandez Lopez, Millares and Fernandez

| Rodriguez. It appears there would be some substantial evidence
toncernin Asencio's involvement, inmeluding hic cum admissions:

| however, Department “nay have decided not to seek indictment against

Asencio on basis he will be utilized as Government witness
at any future trial held in this case. Asencio has been
cooperative and on one occasion agreed to technical coverage

II of a meeting he had with Garcia and Hernandez Lopez in his car.

On April 28, 1960, Carlos Hernandez Lopez was found
in criminal contempt in U. S. District Court in Miami for
failure to appear before Grand Jury on April 13, 1960, in response
to subpoena in connection with Grand Jury hearings in this matter,
- On the same day he was fined $100. On May 3, 1960, Hernandez
Lopez again failed to appear at a Grand Jury session and a warrant
| was issued for his arrest, Hernandez Lopez is reported to be
in Cuba at this time. We have not interjected ourselves in
efforts to locate him’ on contempt charges.

On May 20, 1960, Garcia was arraigned in U. 8. District
Court, Miami, and pled'not guilty. A request by his attorney
that Garcia be allowed to go to Cuba for the weekend and return
to Miami on May 23, 1960, was denied.

DESTRUCTION OF AIRCRAFT OR
MOTOR VEHICLES - FALSE REPORTS
SUMMARY OF PROSECUTIONS

The following is a summary of the prosecutions
\ under the talse report section of the Destruction of canine
or Motor Vehicles Statute.

Attached hereto is a thumbnail sketch of each
| of the cases which are pending prosecution at this time.

Since the U. S. Attorneys', conference early in
April, 1960, prosecution has been authorized in 16 of these
ceases, Arrests were made in 15 of these cases and in one
case, the subject Vincent Joseph Micel, Boston, Massachusetts,
was permitted to surrender following the return of a true
bill of indictment. The Micel violation actually occurred
on January 26, 1960, and he was arrested by local authorities.
The Assistant U. S. Attorney, Boston, Massachusetts, deferred
his prosecutive opinion pending the outcome of local charges.
When local prosecution was subsequently discontinued, the
case was presented to the Federal Grand Jury at Boston,
Massachusetts, on May 19, 1960.

There are also four cases pending in which

VOTER REGISTRATION CASES
UNDER CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF 1960

The Civil Rights Division has requested the
delivery of demand letters to registration officials and
subsequent inspections and copying of voter registration
records in eight counties and parishes in Alabama, Georgia,
South Carolina and Louisiana. The desired records were
made available in South Carolina and Georgia.

In Louisiana a suit has been filed in Federal
Court against the Attorney General, Mr. Joseph M. F. Ryan, Jr.,
and the Director of the FBI alleging Titles 2 and 6 of the
Civil Rights Act of 1960 are unconstitutional and requests
an injunction enjoining the Attorney General and the FBI
from proceeding under the Act. United States District
Judge Ben C. Dawkins, Shreveport, Louisiana, signed an order
on May 25, 1960, directing the Attorney General, Acting
Assistant Attorney General Ryan and the Director to show
cause at 9:30 a.m., June 20, 1960, why preliminary inter-
locutory injunction should not be granted. Judge Dawkins also
signed a temporary restraining order to be effective until
June 20, 1960.

In Alabama, in one instance, an injunction has been
issued by Judge James A, Hare of the Fourth Judicial Circuit
which covers Wilcox County, Alabama, This requires clarification
of the Act before granting permission to inspect and copy
voter registration recads. The Attorney General, Mr. Ryan,
plus the Special Agent in Charge of the Mobile Office and
the Assistant Special Agent in Charge, are named in the’
injunction. No reply has been received to the demand letter
in a second investigation eueneues one has been promised
on June 6, 1960.

RICHARD KENNETH KAUFMAN-VICTIN
EXTORTION, 5-26-60

Richard Kaufman, a student at Syracuse University,
New York and son of Federal Judge Irving Kaufman, who
presided during the trial of the Apalachin hoodlums, on
3-1-60, received an anonymous threatening phone call. The
unknown caller made reference to victim's father and threatened
"Just wait until we get hold of you." Kaufman received another ~
call of a similar nature on 4-4-60 and on 4-5-60 received the
first of 4 threatening letters, all postmarked Syracuse,
New York. The last of these communications bore an April 12,
1960, date. 7

AUSA Kenneth Ray of the Northern District of New York,
has indicated letters coupled with previous phone calls
constituted a violation of the Federal Extortion Statute and
his opinion was concurred in by the Department on April 8, 1960.

Extensive investigation has been conducted by our
Albany Office in an effort to identify and locate the extortion~
ist. To date, no positive information has been obtained, and
no suspects have been developed. Of interest, however, is the
fact that the rumors pervails among fellow students, faculty
members, and advisors of the victim that he prepared the
communications’ in question. While no direct evidence cor=
roborating these rumors has been uncovered, writing paper and
envelopes similar to that used in one of the communications
found in the victim's room.

The Department has requested copies of all investiga- a
tive reports. Judge Kaufman will be confidentially advised of the
‘| facts developed by our investigation, after which the reports will
be disseminated to the {peparemeaky

ADOLPH COORS, II - VICTIM
KIDNAPING; EXTORTION

Intensive investigation is being continued in this case
with two principal objectives—the location and apprehension of
Joseph Corbett, Jr., the prime suspect in this case who is carried
as one of our ten most wanted fugitives, and the development of
evidence to positively identify Corbett as Coors' abductor.

In our program acquainting the.public with our interest
in Corbett, material has been prepared and transmitted to the field
which will be furnished to all newspapers in the United States. In
our specialized circularization of persons and businesses with whom
Corbett would most likely have contact, we have sent letters and
Wanted Flyers to all individuals engaged in the prescribing and
dispensing of eyeglasses, including contact lenses, as Corbett's
eyesight requires that he wear glasses at all times.

The special squad in the Denver Division is currently
engaged in investigation in the mountain area to the west and north-
west of Denver with the objective of obtaining some information as
to the site of a planned hide-out where the abductor would have taken
Coors and indications as to where Coors' body could have been left.

Starus OF JOHN GEORGE LEDES, ET AL.
. FRAUD AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT --
CONFLICT OF INTEREST

. This case relates to the association between
Ledes, a former legal adviser to Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) Commissioner James C. Sargent and Joseph
Abrams, a New York promoter of unsavory reputation. We
completed an extensive investigation which determined ‘that
Ledes endeavored to assist Abrams with several SEC matters
while Ledes was still with that agency. Abrams made loans
to Ledes to finance properties which Ledes purchasedo

The attorney for subject Abrams advised his client
not to talk to us. The attorney for Ledes, James M. Me Inerney,
refused to make Ledes available for interview unless he,
Me Inerney, is present. We informed the Department and suggested
that they consider calling Ledes before a Federal Grand Jury or
interviewing him themselves in Mc Inerney's presence. -

On May 13, 1960, Roger Connor, Executive Assistant to
Assistant Attorney General Wilkey, advised that Joseph Abrams
had been brought down from Danbury, Connecticut, Federal
Corréctional Institution to Washington, .D. C., for appearance
before a Federal Grand Jury here. The Grand Jury presentation
by three Department attorneys started that date and is currently
continuing. Leads growing out of the Grand Jury hearings are
being received and are currently outstanding in Washington Field
Office, New York, Atlanta and Miami, These matters are being
given immediate and continuous attention.

advised the agreement had been reached between the Departments
of Labor and Justice as to this new labor law, 71 cases have
been referred to us by the Criminal Division for investigation
and 41 have been completed. Of the 3 cases received this week,
two had been forwarded to the Criminal Division by the
Department of Labor, which makes a total of 31 cases received
from the Criminal Division upon referral from the Department
of Labor.

These investigations involve (1) embezzlement of -
union funds, (2) convicted felons holding-union office and
(3) deprivation.of rights of union members by force or violence,
They are instituted only upon receipt of specific requests
from the Criminal Division. The Department will render decisions

ANTITRUST AND MONOPOLY SUBCOMMITTEE
COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY
ESTES KEFAUVER, CHAIRMAN

Recently Senator Kefauver's Committee requested
the Bureau to conduct name checks on 304 individuals
reportedly associated with the boxing industry. Several
of these names were duplicated on a prior request for a
name check by Senator Kefauver's Committee. It appeared
that the Committee might be conducting a fishing expedition.
_} by submitting such an extensive list. . Accordingly, the
| matter was referred to the Department to answer the Committee's
request. . i

On May 25, 1960, William G, Hundley, Chief,
Organized Crime and Racketeering Section, Criminal
Division, telephonically advised that following a contact
with the Kefauver Committee on that date the original
request for name checks on 304 individuais had been
reduced to a request for name checks on 30 individuals.
Of these 30, Mr. Hundley pointed out that where any
individual was the subject of pending prosecution, such
as Frankie Carbo, it would be unnecessary for the Bureau
to search its files concerning that individual. Mr. Hundley
also advised the Committee representatives that it would not
be possible in every instance to make name checks on an
expeditious basis while the hearings. were being conducted
inasmuch as the time factor in making the name checks would
depend upon the number of references involved. Mr. Hundley
is sending a memorandum to the Bureau in the immediate -
future listing the names which the Committe’ has now
requested be checked,

Upon receipt of Mr. Hundley's memorandum listing
the names, the names will be checked and appropriate summaries
prepared, >

FBI BUDGET REQUEST - FISCAL YEAR 1968

The Bureau's request for 1968 totals $186,574,000. It will
provide for a personnel staff totaling 15,780 (6,638 agents and 9,142
clerks). The request makes provision for an increase of 569 full-year
employees (106 agents and 463 clerks) when compared to 1967.

Of the additional émployees, 165 (100 agents and 65 clerks)
are for assignment to the field to assist in the handling of a heavy
volume of civil rights werk. (This is the second increment of a
total increase of 300 agents and attendant clerical staff and
equipment previously ordered by the President for civil rights
work over a three-year period to be implemented at the rate of 100 agents
a year.) The remaining 404 employees (6 agents and 398 clerks) are for
assignment at our headquarters, the bulk to be utilized to handle the
‘tremendous increase in name and fingerprint checks being received.

The request of $186,574,000 for 1968 is an increase of
$4,249,000 when compared to the total requirements for the current
fiscal year 1967 which includes $175,465,000 already appropriated
and by a supplemental request totaling $6,860,000 brought about
by costs growing out of new legislation increasing our payroll
costs ($5,250,000) and by new legislation increasing the costs we
must pay to transfer employees to meet the needs of the service
($1,610,000).

Most careful consideration was given to our request for
additional personnel in 1968, We are absorbing much work and will
endeavor to make further absorptions. When confronted with a
one-million increase in fingerprint receipts, a 43% increase in
name checks, a heavy amount of civil rights and other work, we
have no alternative but to ask for additional manpower if we are to
meet our responsibilities in thesé areas.

The Bureau's growing.work is not Limited to these particular
areas by any means. The work of the FBI Laboratory mounted to a new
all-time peak during the fiscal year 1966, numerous criminal classifi-
cations reached new highs, and our work in matters vital to the internal
security of tke country has continued to increase. We are going to
do our best to handle the mounting work in these areas with our
existing staff. In addition, new items of legislation continue to be
passed adding to our work.

NW 65360 Docid:32989646 Page 551



: et eest

Indicative of our heavy volume of work is the fact that as
of January 1, 1967, pending investigative matters throughout the

field totaled 150,189, with 5% in a delinquent status. At that time,
the average individual assignment in the field was nearly 26 matters as
compared with 20 at that time in 1961. :

’ SPECIAL INVESTIGATIVE DIVISION
CRIMINAL INTELLIGENCE AND ORGANIZED CRIME SECTION

During the past few months the Department has
launched into a program of review of past, current, and
contemplated prosecutions to determine if such cases have
been materially affected by the use of electronic listening
devices. This has required the establishment of special
microphone indices at Bureau Headquarters and voluminous
correspondence with various field divisions to determine if
individuals listed in the Department's inquiries wére covered
by FBI microphones. With regard to listed individuals on
whom we have had some form of microphone coverage, we are so
advising the Department and pertinent logs, together in
some cases with other supporting material, are being obtained
from the field for review by Departmental attorneys.

The Department made public the fact that such a
review was under way in the filing of a memorandum with the
Supreme Court by the Solicitor General in the Joseph Schipani
case, November 30, 1966.

Set forth as follows are the brief circumstances
regarding individual prosecutive situations in which, to
date, the Department has made disclosures to various courts
regarding the FBI's use of electronic listening devices of
pertinence to those prosecutions.

Joseph Frank Schipani

Schipani is a New York hoodlum and a member of
La Cosa Nostra who was convicted and sentenced to three years
imprisonment and fined $12,500 for violation of the income tax
laws for the years 1956 through 1960. In response to the
Department's request, they were provided with logs reporting
those instances where Schipani was covered& by an electronic
surveillance. This electronic surveillance was not directly
on Schipani but was in an office frequented by top La Cosa
Nostra racket figures. On November 30, 1966, the Solicitor
General requested the Supreme Court.to vacate the judgment
regarding Schipani of the Court of Appeals and remand the
case to the District Court for a new trial. On December 12,
1966, the Supreme Court complied with the request of the
Solicitor General. This was installed under the general
authority of the Attorney General, as were all of the
following unless otherwise specified,

NW 65360_Docld:32989646 Page 554 :



Louis J. Taglianetti

The Department on December 27, 1966, filed a motion
to remand in the United States Court of Appeals for the First
Circuit in the Louis J, Taglianetti appeal from the judgment
of the United States District Court for the District of
Rhode Isiand. Taglianetti, a member of the Raymond Patriarca
"family" of La Cosa Nostra, was indicted on February 26, 1963,
for income tax evasion for the years 1956, 1957, and 1958.

He was found guilty on September 16, 1966. Taglianetti
appealed but no brief had yet been filed.

The Department's motion indicated Taglianetti's
conversations had been monitored by microphone surveillance
at the place of business of a close associate (Raymond Patriarca)
where Taglianetti andohers met and that this establishment
was being utilized for purposes connected with organized crime.
On various occasions between March, 1962, when this microphone
was installed with trespass under general authority of the
Attorney General, until 1965, Taglianetti's conversations
related to his income tax indictment. None of the information
was used in evidence or was the source of leads to any evidence
in the case.

The Department's motion noted that Taglianetti's
case was within the ambit of the Supreme Court's decision in
the Black case, decided November 7, 1966. The distinguishing
feature between the two is the intrusion upon attorney-client
conversations in the Black casé, for which the Supreme Court
vacated the conviction and granted a new trial. The Department's
reasons for the motion to remand in Taglianetti was for the
limited purpose of enabling the District Court to examine the
facts and to determine whether Taglianetti' S conviction should
stand or a new trial be ordered. ioe

The defense has now filed a motion for new trial
claiming that, "The Government, having tasted the forbidden
fruit of its illegal bugging’ and having withheld all knowledge
thereof from the defendant, his counsel and the trial judge,
cannot now preserve the conviction thus obtained because such
forbidden fruit failed to produce a sweet taste." Hearings
on these motions have not yet been scheduled.

FRANK DE NIRO, JR.
MICHAEL DE NIRO
LOUIS DE NIRO

The De Niro brothers were convicted 8/23/65 of
conspiring to defraud the U. S. in evading estate taxes,
They have appealed to the U. S. Court of Appeals for the
Sixth Circuit. The Cleveland Office conducted a microphone
surveillance from 2/19/64 to 6/16/64 in the office of the
National Cigarette Service, Youngstown, Ohio, a vending
machine company, operated by the De Niros, In response to the
Department's request 10/14/66 we disclosed the circumstances
of this surveillance to them by letter'10/18/66, and made
available for review the surveillance logs. No information
from this source was disseminated outside the Bureau,

The Department subsequently disclosed to the
Court of Appeals by memorandum the existance of our
microphone surveillance. Considerable reluctance was
displayed by the Department to including in this
memorandum our general authority for installation of
electronic surveillances., They did not clearly record the
dates concerning the manner in which the Department requested
and was advised of our coverage. Our protests were clearly
outlined in correspondence to the Department before this
memorandum was filed. Uitimately our authority was recorded
as a footnote, This microphone’ was installed under the
general authority of the Attorney General.

Frank Peter Balistrieri

Balistrieri, the "boss" of Milwaukee's La Cosa
Nostra "family," and as such the leader of organized crime
in that area, was brought to trial in United States District
Court, Springfield, Illinois, during October, 1966, on
the basis of an indictment’ charging evasion of Federal
income taxes, An early issue in this action was our
microphone coverage of Balistrieri and certain of his
associates, Microphone coverage had been established on
Balistrieri's office, in an apartment maintained by his
paramour, and in the office of hoodlum attorney Dominic Frinzi,
all in Milwaukee, for various periods between 1961 and 1965,
These installations were all made in line with general
departmental authorization as outlined in the Department's
memorandum filed with the Supreme Court in the Black case.

NW 65360 Docld:32989646 Page 556 .



-The defense has made a motion to suppress, based
on this electronic coverage. After hearing testimony
regarding these: installations, including testimony of
Bureau personnel, and reviewing logs of the coverage in-.
question, the judge instructed that the trial should be
commenced, with the defense having the right to renew its
mortion after the trial, in the event evidence presented
warrants such a proceedings.

Trial was undertaken on 10/17/66. On 11/29/66
Defense Attorney Walsh suffered a heart attack and further
trial proceedings have been deferred until March 1, 1967.
None of the information produced by this microphone was
utilized in obtaining the indictment of Balistrieri.

Ronald David Carabbia

Carabbia was convicted 6/21/65 for violation of
wagering tax laws and has appealed to the U. S. Court of
Appeals, Sixth Circuit. The Cleveland Office conducted a
microphone surveillance at the Modern News Center and
Novelties Company, Youngstown, from 1/22/62 until 3/22/62.
Carabbia and his brothers operated a’gambling game at this
location. Activities covered by this surveillance included
gambling with numerous participants. The voices of the
individuals covered were never identified. It could not be
determined if the appellant was or was not present during
the operation of this source.

In response to the Department's inquiry, we
disclosed to them by lettef dated 11/1/66 the circumstances
of this surveillance and made available for review all
surveillance logs. By letter dated 1/9/67, the Department
indicated its intention to disclose this microphone
surveillance by memorandum to the U. S. Court of Appeals,
Sixth Circuit. In three letters we have advised the Department
of the brief operation of-this source and that the individuals
covered were never identified. The Department's proposed
memorandum to the court notes, "There is a substantial
question Whether any conversations in which appellant
participated were even monitored." In spite of this, the
Department apparently feels it must disclose this surveillance.
The Department failed to include our general authorization for
installation of electronic surveillances over our protests.
We feel that at the very least the general authorization of the
Department should be in all briefs going to courts so there can
be no accusation that the Bureau was operating in an uncontrolled
and unrestrained manner,

NW 65360 Docid:32989646 Page 557


Jack T. Rainwater

Jack T. Rainwater has conducted a large-scale
numbers operation in the Miami, Florida area. He and six
associates were convicted of state gambling violations in
Florida courts based upon evidence furnished by the
Internal Revenue Service and testimony of Internal Revenue
Service agents. ~

In response to the Department's request they
were provided with logs reporting those instances where
Rainwater and one of his associates who also was convicted
in state court, were monitored by an electronic surveillance.
Neither of these individuals were the direct subject of an
: electronic surveillance.

On January 11, 1967, the Solicitor General
disclosed to the Supreme Court that an electronic device
had been utilized by Federal agents in the Rainwater matter.

Our installation in this matter was made under
general authority of the Attorney General. Information from
this source was disseminated to Internal Revenue Service who

in turn disseminated to local authorities.

Charles Joseph Battaglia, Jr.

member who was closely affiliated with Joseph Bonanno a
former La Cosa Nostra "Commission" member. A microphone

for criminal intelligence purposes had been maintained on

him under general Departmental authority. He was arrested by
Bureau Agents for violation-of the Hobbs Act in March, 1965,
as a result of making threats in an effortyto force a Tucson
firm to utilize his vending machims, Following the granting
of several continuances the trial judge in Federal District
Court ordered Battaglia to appear for trial on the morning

of January~11, 1967, The Department advised that they intended i
to infomm the judge that Battaglia had been covered by microphone
surveillaitces, but that the coverage had no bearing on the
evidence to be produced in substantiation of the criminal

charges against Battaglia. The Department further advised

Battaglia is a Tucson, Arizona, La Cosa Nostra

NW 65360 Docld:32989646 Page 558 - .



they were going to.recommend that the judge proceed with

the trial and at the conclusion thereof, if the judge feels

it necessary, a hearing will be held to determine the validity
of the Department's claim regarding the microphone evidence.

A hearing on this motion is scheduled co Monday,
January 16, 1967, in Tucson, Arizona,

Edward L. Levinson, et. al., Civil Suit

On December 10, 1965, Edward Levinson, at that time
one of the owners of the Fremont Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada,
filed a $6,000,000 damage suit (later reduced to $4,200,000)
against four Bureau Agents, charging invasion of privacy and
asking injunctive relief against further invasion by use of
electronic listening devices. Levinson filed a similar suit
against the Central Telephone Company of Las Vegas and certain
of its employees,

: The case has recently been taken over personally by
Assistant Attorney General Barefoot Sanders who is presently

reviewing all of the material in connection with preparing

a@ response to plaintiff's motions. No date has been set for

trial in matter. The Bureau has been pressing the Department
to take depositions in this case from such major hoodlums as

Meyer Lansky and Gerardo Catena who have hidden interests in

the Fremont Hotel.

Fred B. Black, Jr.
Fred B. Black, Jr., named as being hired by front

men in Las Vegas to represent their interests in Washington,

D. C., where Black was alleged to have influence, was convicted

-on May 5, 1965, of evading income taxes for the period of

1956 through 1959, After a number of appeads he petitioned .the

Supreme Court for issuance pf a writ of certiorari which was

denied on May 4, 1966,

On May 24, 1966, Solicitor General Thurgood Marshall
filed a memorandum with the Supreme Court reporting a.listening
device had*been placed in Black's hotel suite in 1963, but

NW 65360 Docld:32989646 Page 559 oy
BA B9500 DOCHUTSLICS ON Pe a



none of the evidence used in Black's trial was obtained as
a result of the listening device. The Supreme Court on
June 13, 1966, ordered a response by the Department to
questions raised by the Court with regard to the initial
memorandum filed by the Department which was answered on
July 13, 1966, by supplemental memorandum.

This memorandum indicated the listening device,
installed with trespass under general Departmental authori-
zation had monitored conversations of Black and his attorney.

The United States Supreme Court on November 7,

1966, vacated the income tax conviction and granted a new
trial, which will not be set until after the Robert Baker trial.

| i To date, the Bureau has received over 1,000 names
i of individuals of prosecutive interest for a determination
| if such subjects have been covered by FBI microphones. A
number of problems have resulted.

One problem which has been encountered, and
which can be expected to be even more serious in the future,
is the lack of identifying data accompanying the names of
individuals on whom the Department has made inquiry in these
matters. For example, one list recently received included
475 names, in some cases With a minimum of identifying data

and in others with no identifying data a& all.

an accurate determination can be made whether an

in question has, in fact, been covered by one of

identifying data when submitting these names for

review.



An attendant problem has arisen in certain
inquiries in which the Department has made unreasonable
requests for such reviews on extremely short notice. One of
these involved a request for the results of the review later
the same day it was received. Thoroughness and accuracy, of
absolute necessity in this type review, make extremely rapid
checks such as this in most cases impossible, and at best,

a very dangerous procedure.

With regard to those situations in which the
Department has made disclosures to the various courts,
continuing reluctance has been evidenced on their part to
inform the court of the fact that the installation in question
has been utilized by the FBI under either specific authority
from the Attorney General, or under the general Departmental
authority which was granted. The Department has been repeatedly
reminded of their reluctance in these individual situations.

The volume involved in this project has caused
a decided strain on the Bureau in processing these numerous
inquiries to date, and these problems become magnified when
the enormity of the entire project is assessed, in view of
indications by the Department that the full review may
encompass as many as 30,000 rames,

FUGITIVE SECTION

Cassius Marcellus Clay

Cassius Clay, world's heavyweight boxing
champion and Black Muslim, earlier this year filed a
claim as a conscientious objector and more recently has
applied to his draft board at Louisville, Kentucky, for
a ministerial deferment as a minister of the Black Muslim
religion, After a very extensive investigation by the
Bureau, Clay's draft board denied his claim as a
conscientious objector and placed him in a 1-A classification,
Since the board's vote was unanimous, he has no further
appeal as a conscientious objector. His ministerial
deferment request will now have to be considered by his
local board which our sources indicate will meet in the
next few days. If the local board denies this request,
Clay has the right to appeal.

DOMINICAN SITUATION

The FBI was ordered into the Dominican Republic by
the President in May, 1965, to develop information to be used
‘in preventing communists from gaining control in that country.
We set up a staff of ten Agents. In August, 1966, at White
House instructions we established a permanent Legal Attache
office there, staffed with three Agents.

The six-moénth-old government under Joaquin Balaguer
has brought about a degree of stability. Nevertheless, there
continue to be strong undercurrents of dissension. The
rightists reportedly have considered plots to remove Balaguer.
Juan Bosch's political party, loser in the June, 1966, election,
has been most vocal in its opposition to Balaguer's programs.
The communist groups have suffered much internal dissension
but to accomplish a common cause could be expected to regroup
as they have in the past. In fact, a student strike in Santo
Domingo, which began January 9, 1967, has attracted strong
communist support and has served as a rallying point for the
extreme leftists. Within two days, seventy percent of the
students in secondary schools had joined the strike.

This is but one of numerous problems which beset

Balaguer, although to date he has been able to meet each one
head on.

General Investigative Division,


ROBERT G, BAKER
FRAUD AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT’ ©
CONFLICT OF INTEREST

The most recent development relative to the trial ©
of Baker is the disclosure in the afternoon edition of "The
Evening Star," 1/12/67, that the Narcotics Bureau of the
Treasury Department installed a "bug" in the Baker case. it
is reported that this installation relates to the Department's
admission during the trial that it had planted a microphone
and transmitter on Wayne Bromley, a prime Government witness,
in order to record the results of a meeting held on 3/26/65,
at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel, Los Angeles, California; which
was attended by Baker, Clifford Jones and Bromley. The
article points out that the FBI had refused a request of the
Department to cover this meeting. It also points out that
according to Edward Bennett Williams, Baker's attorney, that
in compliance with an order of Judge Gasch to turn over tapes
and transcripts, only notes made by two monitors were received
indicating the tape was not usable or available.

This meeting at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel is the
meeting which was arranged during telephone calls on 3/25/65,
between Bromley and Baker and Bromley and Jones which were
monitored and tape recorded by the Bureau at the request of
the Department, with the Department's assurance that such action™
was legal and with the written consent of Bromley. A complete
transcript of these recordings was made available to the
Department.

Although the Department did on 3/25/65, request that
we monitor the meeting in Los Angeles, we refused to do so.
Upon revelation during pretrial hearings that this meeting
was monitored, Acting Attorney General Ramsey Clark was questioned
as to who performed this monitoring. He stated that he had ascer-
tained that upon the FBI's refusal to comply with the departmental

request, the Department had then turned to wither the Immigration

and Naturalization Service-(INS) or the Bureau of Narcotics.
He was certain that it was the Bureau of Narcotics.

The only other coverage of any conversations by Baker
was accidental in nature and resulted from installations which
had been placed on Fred B. Black in Washington, D. C.; the
Fremont Hotel, Las Vegas, Nevada, Edward Siegelbaum, Miami,

-19-

NW 65360 Docld:32989646 Page 585 al



Florida, (all in connection with organized crime matters) and
the Dominican Embassy (in connection with security matters).
Details concerning these installations were set forth ina
Summary memorandum regarding the Bureau's involvement in the
prosecution of Baker, dated 1/10/67.

Logs relative to the electronic surveillances on
Black, the F rewont Hotel and Siegelbaum were furnished to
the Department and excerpts were furnished to the trial judge
who ordered that they be made available to the defense. These
logs were the subject of pretrial hearings during November, 1966,
following which the judge ruled that there was no causal
relationship between the information in the logs and the
charges in the indictment.

Logs concerning Baker's conversations intercepted
on the Dominican Embassy installation were similarly furnished
to the Department and to the trial judge who placed a
protective order thereon and has instructed that any dis~
cussions relative to them must be held only in his chambers.
Information as to the existence of these logs has been
leaked to the press, presumably by Edward Bennett Williams
to cause some action favorable to his client. His reporting
to the trial judge that the FBI was responsible for this leak
is absolutely ridiculous and is completely unfounded.

JAMES RIDDLE HOFFA; ET AL,
OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE

dames Riddle Hoffa and three others were convicted
-in Chattanooga Federal Court, 3/4/64, of obstruction of
justice related to their efforts to tamper with certain
members of the jury in a previous trial of Hoffa, These
convictions were upheld by the U. S, Supreme Court on 12/12/66,

In response to a request from Assistant Attorney
General Fred M, Vinson, Jr., we furnished a letter to the
Acting Attorney General on 12/29/66, of instances in which
the conversations of Hoffa and two other defendants were
overheard through the use of electronic devices. Hoffa, his
office, and his home were not the direct targets of any
electronic devices in the development of this case, and the
Acting Attorney General was so advised in our memorandum of
12/29/66. The instances in which he appeared to have been
present at conversations monitored occurred in Detroit,
Michigan, and Las Vegas, Nevada,

In 1961 and 1962 our Detroit office overheard
three conversations of Hoffa, These conversations were
proadcast to and from radio-telephones in automobiles
operated by Teamsters Union personnel in the Detroit area,
This was accomplished through the use of a tunable
commercial~type FM radio receiver which was in operation in
our Detroit office, No trespass was involved in this
connection,

In addition, between 2/1 and 8/12/63, Hoffa
appears to have participated in four telephone conversations
with two Las Vegas hoodlum figures who were being covered by
electronic eavesdropping devices (trespass involved).
Hoffats part of these conversations was not overheard,

Zeno Thomas Osborn, Jr., (Nashville lawyer and
former attorney for Hoffa) was convicted 6/29/64, in
Nashville Federal Court of obstruction of justice arising
from his attempts to influence a potential juror in a forth-
coming tnial of Hoffa, .In this investigation, a miniature
recorder was concealed on a cooperative Government witness
during » meeting with Osborn, This installation was made
at the request of the Department and with the prior approval
of the two Federal judges in Nashville. No trespass was
involved, and the use of this’ installation was brought out
fully during Osborn's trial. His conviction was affirmed by
the Supreme Court 12/12/66, The Department is fully aware of

NW 65360 Docld:32989645 Page 587 ~al- :



this installation and details of same were included in our
letter to the Acting Attorriey General 12/29/66,

: :
At the specific request of former Attorney General

Kennedy, a microphone surveillance (trespass required) was
conducted on the Washington, D. C., hotel room of James E,
Haggerty (former attorney for James Riddle Hoffa) during
period 8/7/61, through 8/11/61. This coverage was for the
specific purpose of identifying an alleged "contact" of
Hoffa's in the Justive Department, whom Kennedy thought
Haggerty would meet in Washington, Information concerning
this coverage was included in our letter to the Acting
Attorney General dated 12/29/66, In addition, in.response
to a letter from Vinson dated 12/29/66, we furnished the

Acting Attorney General copies of logs prepared in connection

with this coverage by memorandum dated 1/6/67.

JURY PANEL INVESTIGATIONS

On January 9, 1967, a letter was forwarded to
the Acting Attorney General advising him that in view of
the increasing sensitiveness to intrusion by the Federal
Government into the rights of defendants in criminal
trials and in order to assure that future requests for
jury panel investigations would be made only in truly
exceptional cases, investigations of this nature should
not be undertaken by the Bureau except upon the specific
written request of the Attorney General or the Deputy
Attorney General and that our field offices were being so
instructed,

| CIVIL RIGHTS MATTERS IN MISSISSIPPI

t
Two major civil rights cases are awaiting

. prosecutive action in Mississippi. One of these cases
involves the murder of three civil rights workers near
Philadelphia, Mississippi, in June, 1964, in which case
eighteen subjects were previously indicted on civil rights
charges by a Federal Grand Jury. The other case involves
the shooting and burning of the residence of Vernon Ferdinand
Dahmer, past president of the NAACP,near Hattiesburg,
Mississippi, in January, 1966, resulting in the death of
Dahmer. A Federal Grand Jury indicted fifteen members of
the White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan of Mississippi
relative to the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and Civil Rights
Statute.

In view of a court decision subsequent to the
above indictments, it was determined by the Government that
all of the indictments in these two cases are faulty because
certain minority groups including Negroes had been excluded
from the grand jury. The Department has been pushing for
early representations to a properly composed grand jury and
had contemplated that both of these cases would be given to
a Federal Grand Jury being empaneled 1/16/67.

On 1/3/67 U. S. District Judge Harold Cox advised
SAC Roy Moore that he had instructed the U. S. Attorney to
use the January grand jury for the purpose of checking into
possible misuse of funds in the Headstart project sponsored
by the Office of Economic Opportunity in Mississippi. The
Judge referred to press accounts stating that the Government
was providing additional money for this project although
it has been alleged that several hundred thousand dollars
of the initial appropriation was unaccounted for. Judge Cox
“ gaid that he felt "first things come first" and therefore
decided to use the grand jury to ferret out any possible
fraud in connection with the failure to account for these
funds. He stated he woyld advise SAC Mdore when he convenes
another grand jury to hear the civil rights cases. Judge Cox
added that this will be done sometime in the near future
but thaf no specific date has been-set. It has been
speculated in the press that if Judge Cox fails to promptly
call a “grand jury to hear the civil rights cases the
Government will seek mandamus from the U. S. Circvit Court
of Appeals for the purpose of forcing Judge Cox to call a
grand jury to hear these cases.

PROPOSED LEGISLATION REGARDING CRIMES
‘AGAINST BANKING INSTITUTIONS

By letter to the Attorney General 3/1/65, we called
attention to the rise in crimes against banking institutions and
recommended the Department propose legislation which would require
bank.supervisory agencies to establish minimum security requirements
for all banks under Fedéral Charter. A follow-up letter was sent on
3/29/65, and again on 3/1/66. The Department advised on 4/12/66,
that a legislative proposal was being developed. A proposed bill was
submitted for our review on 6/6/66, which we returned on 6/9/66,
recommending no changes. In reply to our inquiry on 7/25/66, the
Department, on 8/3/66, advised the Bill was under study by the
Office of the Deputy Attorney General.

fi We inquired again on 10/6/66, and on 10/26/66, were
advised that since the 89th Congress was So near an end, the legis-
lation would be included on program for 90th Congress. By letter
11/28/| 66, we were advised that the Bill had been returned to the
Criminal Division with certain observations and suggestions. . On
1/9/67, we again called attention to the increase in violations. Current
figures show that during calendar year 1966, violations increased to
1871, a new all-time high, surpassing the 1749 violations in calendar
year 1965.

WALTER BERYL CHIPMAN, ET AL.
CRIME ON HIGH SEAS

Alvin Junior Cupp, who had received a five-year
Federal term on 3/16/65, in Marquette, Michigan, furnished
information to Chicago Agents pinpointing officials and "goons"
of the Seamens International Union (SIU) responsible for the
1963 bombing of the Canadian freighter, eae L. Shaw't
in Chicago, Illinois.

Upon Cupp's parole from prison 12/23/66, he was
immediately contacted by union officials allegedly for the purpose
of paying him off a promised $8, 000 for maintaining his silence
relative to the "Howard L. Shaw' bombing while in prison.

The U. S. Attorney's office in Chicago requested that an
electronic device be attached to Cupp's person to record con-
versations with union officials, anticipating evidence would be
obtained whereby prosecution of these officials would be
forthcoming. SAC, Chicago advised the U. S. Attorney on
1/4/67, that the Bureau could not accede to his request since the
Solicitor General had publicly announced that all eavesdropping
is illegal.

At approximately 9 P.M., 1/5/67, the Acting Attorney
General called Mr. DeLoach relative to this case, indicating he
felt this was a legal device and he could see no reason why it
should not be used. Mr. DeLoach informed the Acting Attorney

’ General if he felt this way he should put these views in writing,

since the FBI could not afford to be criticized on one hand and then
on the other hand be directed by the Departmentrto enter into such
procedures. The Acting Attorney General, upon a moment's
reflection, stated that in view of the "psychological situation" he
probably would not put this request in writing and perhaps would
inform the Organized Crime Section of the Department not to
request the FBI to utilize this device. We have since received no
such request from the Acting Attorney General.

ATTORNEY GENERAL'S TESTIMONY
HOUSE JUDICIARY SUBCOMMITTEE
MARCH 15, 1967

The "Washington Post" reported on March 16, 1967, that
Attorney General Clark opened hearings before a House Judiciary sub-
committee on March 15th relative to the Administration's request for
50 million dollars next year and 300 million dollars the following year
to assist state and local governments in modernizing their law enforce-
ment and corrective systems. Clark said that a successful war on
crime depends not on making it easier for police to seek confessions
but on improving their training and methods.

The Attorney General also said he had seen no evidence
that court decisions limiting admission of confessions had hampered
efficient law enforcement. Clark is reported to have opposed action
reversing court orders that suspects be told of their rights and be
offered counsel before being questioned.

Attorney General Clark said that since 1948 the FBI has
followed generally the same interrogation procedures which the courts
have now ordered the states to follow. The FBI has maintained a very
high average of convictions, showing "what excellence in training and
standards can do," Clark said.

Clark also said he hoped Congress would not go "too far
on too little" until more evidence is in.on the effect of the Supreme
Court's decisions.

COMMENT

The Attorney General failed to consider the fact that FBI
investigations are not normally hot pursuit, on-the-street situations.
When the FBI interrogates a suspect or subject, usually considerable
investigation has already been conducted and corroborative facts have
been developed which greatly assist the course of the interrogation,
On the contrary, police are frequently faced with fast-moving,
developing situations on the street where there is no opportunity for
the orderly accumulation of facts to supplement interrogation. —

, Congress is currently investigating the effect of the
Miranda decision on law enforcement and public safety. Senator
Birch Bayh (Democrat ~ Indiana) has been holding hearings around
the country regarding Miranda; however, testimony he has received
has been conflicting. Generally law enforcement officials testify
that they have been handcuffed and defense lawyers and civil liber-
tarians take the opposite view. As Of this time, neither side has
demonstrable statistical proof to substantiate its contentions. The
absence of clear proof is due, at least partially, to the fact that
Miranda is a new decision, being handed down on June 13, 1966,
As of now there are few reported court decisions showing how trial
courts will interpret the requirements laid down in Miranda,

PRESS RELEASE OF MARCH 15, 1967
ISSUED BY REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMEN'S "WEDNESDAY CLUB"
ENTITLED "ARE WE ORGANIZED TO FIGHT CRIME?"

On March 15, -1967, a group of 21 generally liberal
Republican Congressmen, members of the 'Wednesday Club, " issued
a press release challenging the adequacy of the Federal Government's
organization to fight crime effectively and called for expansion of the
House Judiciary Committee's hearings considering crime legislation
to examine this aspect of the war oncrime. The gist of their argument -
is that a reorganization of Federal law enforcement and investigative
agencies is needed to effectively carry on the war against crime. The
press release suggests that there is "confusion, competition and dupli-
cation" among Federal law enforcement and investigative agencies which
is hindering the war against crime and that this can be eliminated only
through a complete reorganization of these agencies.

The entire argument of the 'Wednesday Club" is based on
afalse premise. Traditionally and historically, law enforcement in this
country has been the responsibility of local governments and states.

The Federal law enforcement agencies make only approximately 50, 000
arrests per year for Federal violations, while local and state police
make over six million arrests for criminal acts, not including traffic
offenses. Federal investigative agencies have very little jurisdictional
control over the more than three million serious crimes committed in
the United States in 1966. Reorganization of the Federal law
enforcement agencies is not the answer to the crime problem. The
real problem is at the local level where there are 40, 000 investigative
agencies, ranging from city constables to state police, and the problem
of multiplicity of jurisdiction is within the state. From the standpoint
of the FBI, there is daily liaison and exchange of information with all
Federal, state and local law enforcement agencies; our important

* cooperative services are made available to all laW enforcement agencies,

both on the state and Federal lével; and the FBI's National Crime Infor-
mation Center is an example of the cooperation which exists among law
enforcement agencies on all levels.

The press release of the ''Wednesday Club" states that
the FBI maintains an informal semi-autonomy from Administration

NW 65360 Docld:32989646 Page 601 ad

regulations, although organizationally responsible to the Department

of Justice, and cites as an example recent debates over wiretapping
procedures. This statement is without any basis in fact. The Director's
testimony before various legislative committees, as well as documenta-
tion produced by him in the recent "wiretapping" controversy, clearly
shows that the FBI's use of wiretaps was done with the specific knowledge
and approval of the Attorneys General and under strictly controlled
conditions. There is no exercise of autonomy whatsoever by the FBI

in this field. i
The press release also charges that the FBI's involvement
in the foreign intelligence field, such as the Dominican crisis in 1965,
could detract from its domestic law enforcement and crime detection
functions. This allegation also is factually unsupportable. FBI Agents.
were sent to the Dominican Republic in 1965 at the specific order of-the
President; only three Special Agents are presently there, functioning
solely in a liaison capacity; statistical accomplishments by the FBI during
this period have been at their highest levels. :

The action of the Wednesday Club" was an obvious
attempt to secure a headline, which they incorrectly feel they have
found in the question of Federal organization. :

MARCH 12, 1967

TELEVISION INTERVIEW
OF ATTORNEY GENERAL

Attorney General Ramsey Clark was the guest of CBS program
"Face the Nation" which was telecast in Washington over WTOP-TV, at
12:30 p.m., Eastern Standard Time, Sunday, March 12, 1967. This program
was moderated by CBS newscaster Martin Agronsky assisted by correspondents
George Herman of CBS and James Clayton of the ''Washington Post."

The principal topics discussed during this interview of the
Attorney General were: 1. The New Orleans investigation into the
assassination of former President Kennedy; 2. Wiretapping; 3. The
Supreme Court "Miranda" decision; 4. Congressman Adam Clayton Powell;
and 5. The death penalty.

Several references were made to the Director and the FBI
during this interview and all were favorable.

NEW ORLEANS INVESTIGATION

The Attorney General expressed his confidence in the
Warren Commission conclusion, based on FBI investigation, that assassin
Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone in killing former President Kennedy. He
commented that most--if not all--of the individuals mentioned in the New
Orleans investigation were known to the FBI, which developed no evidence
that they were involved in the assassination. Clark declined to comment
on the mysterious individual known as "Bertrand" since New Orleans
authorities were then holding court proceedings to determine his identity.

WIRETAPPING

Clark cornmented that there were 38 wiretaps presently
authorized by his department, and that all of these were in national
security-type cases. He emphasized that procedures for his authority
in the use of all such devices have been improved, and he was satisfied
that none would #i8 be used without his approval.

"MIRANDA" DECISION
declan heme enna

The Attorney General remarked that it was still too early
to determine what effect this decision would have on law enforcement
performance. He noted, however, that it has had no appreciable effect
on FBI investigations which have for many years informed suspects of
their constitutional rights prior to interrogation.

TELEVISION INTERVIEW
OF ATTORNEY GENERAL

POWELL

No decision has been reached by the Department concerning
possible Federal violations committed by Powell, according to Clark.
However, he expressed the hope that their determination might await any
further action against Powell by Congress.

DEATH PENALTY

The Attorney General stated he would recommend the
death penalty be abolished for certain Federal violations.

. UNIFORM CRIME REPORTS
1966 PRELIMINARY ANNUAL RELEASE

On Wednesday, p.m., March 15, 1967, the FBI's
preliminary crime reports for 1966 were released to the press.

. This report highlighted the fact that crimes of violence
were up 11%, There Was a 9% increase in murder, a 10% increase
in aggravated assault, a 10% increase in forcible rape, anda 14%
increase in robbery. As a group, crimes against property increased
11% during 1966. .

The sharpest crime increase was noted in the group of
cities having less than 10, 000 inhabitants, Crime in these cities
rose 14%, Large cities with over 100, 000 inhabitants had an average
increase of 10%, while crime in rural areas was up 7% and crime in
the suburbs rose 13%,

In the release dated March 15th the Director reiterated
the need for adequate firearms legislation, noting that there.was a
23% increase in 1966 in serious assaults where guns were used, The
Director also highlighted the fact that six out of every ten murders
were committed with the use of a firearm, 71% of these murders
were committed with handguns, 17% with shotguns and 12% with rifles
or other type firearm.

This crime report release also indicated that in 1966
police arrests of adults for all ‘criminal acts (excluding traffic
offenses) dropped 1%; however, arrests of persons under 18 years of
age increased 9%.

Our preliminary annual release also noted that nationally,
police solutions of crime index offenses averaged 25% and noted that
police solved 89% of murders, 72% of aggravated assaults, 65% of
forcible rapes, 35% of robberies and 21% of property offenses.

CRIME LEGISLATION

The Congress is presently holding hearings with
respect to the President's request for crime legislation entitled
"Safe Streets and Crime Control Act of 1967."" This Act has its
basis in many of the recommendations of the President's Com-
mission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice.
The report of the Commission entitled "The Challenge of Crime
in a Free Society" was released February 18, 1967, The pro-

“posed legislation would provide for a substantial financial aid
program to local and state law enforcement agencies for the
purpose of purchase of equipment, training, education and
research, It would also establish in the Department of Justice
an agency to administer the program headed by a Director of
Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice Assistance. Depending
on how this new legislation would be administered within the
Department ‘of Justice, it will have an impact and could conflict
with the FBI's long-standing cooperative services for local law
enforcement. :

NATIONAL CONFERENCE ON LAW ENFORCEMENT
AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE ;

By letter dated March 10, 1967, the Attorney

. General requested FBI participation in a national conference
of local and state law enforcement administrators to be held
in the State Department Auditorium on March 28-29, 1967.
This conference was called by the President and has as its
purpose a discussion on how to implement the proposed
crime legislation. Since this conference and any new crime
legislation would affect directly the long-standing FBI coopera-
tive services t6 local law enforcement, Assistant to the Director
DeLoach, Assistant Director Casper and Inspector Jerome J.
Daunt have been designated to attend. The Attorney General is
being advised by letter dated March 17, 1967.

NATIONAL CRIME INFORMATION CENTER (NCIC)

The National Crime Information Center (NCIC), a
computerized index of law enforcement information on crime and
criminals, successfully began its pilot test operation on January 27,
1967. At the present time the following police agencies are directly
on-line to the FBI computer:

Boston Police Department

Philadelphia Police Department

New York City Police Department

Washington, D. C., Metropolitan Police Department

Chicago Police Department

St. Louis Police Department

New Orleans Police Department

Maryland State Police

Virginia State Police

Georgia State Patrol

Texas Department of Public Safety, and

Wa Denver FBI Field Office

‘These agencies are entering records on wanted
persons, stolen motor vehicles, and identifiable stolen property.
They are receiving replies to-inquiries in a matter of seconds.
For example, a police officer on the street in New Orleans through
the use of his car radio is able to get information from the FBI
computer here in Washington within 1 1/2 minutes. The California
Department of Justice and the New York State Police are scheduled
to join the NCIC system on March 20, 1967, The system has had a
steady growth in building up the information that is stored in the
computer, increasing the number of hours that the computer is
"ton the air'' and in adding new participating police agencies.

INVESTIGATION OF THE ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY
BY NEW ORLEANS DISTRICT ATTORNEY JAMES C, GARRISON

In December, 1966, we received information that New Orleans
District Attorney James C, Garrison was conducting an investigation
of the assassination of the late President Kennedy. Garrison reported
ly was attempting to develop evidence showing that David William
Ferrie, a homosexual who was a former airlines pilot, and Lee Harvey
bakit conspired with anti-Castro Cubans to assassinate President
ennedy, - . :

We were informed by several sources-that Garrison was basing
much of his investigation upon information furnished to him by Jack S.
Martin and David Lewis, Martin is a private investigator in
New Orleans and Lewis is a baggage handler at a New Orleans bus
station, Both Martin and Lewis appear to be mental cases, During
our investigation of the assassination, we thoroughly investigated
allegations that Ferrie and Oswald were acquainted but we found

- no evidence to show this was true, :

Garrison has made one arrest in his case ~ Clay L. Shaw,
a homosexual who was former Director of the International Trade Mart
in New Orleans, Shaw's name did not come up during our investigation
of the assassination. Garrison claims Shaw is identical with one
Clay Bertrand, an alleged contact of New Orleans attorney Dean Andrews,
We never located Bertrand and Andrews' acquaintance with Bertrand
highly doubted. We developed no information indicating Oswald knew
Clay Shaw.

On March 14, 1967, during a preliminary hearing in New Or-
leans for Shaw, Garrison produced a mystery witness Perry Raymond
Russo who alleged that he was present at a meeting when Leon Oswald,
David Ferrie and Clay Shaw planned the assassination of President
Kennedy. Russo identified Leon Oswald as identical to Lee Harvey
Oswald, Russo admitted receiving psychiatric treatment since 1959
and his testimony at the preliminary hearing was highly contradictory
to information he previously furnished to news-media, Russo appears
to be lying and during our investigation ofthe assassination, we
developed no information indicating Oswald ever knew Russo,

dames C, Garrison is an egomaniac, is politically ambitious
and it appears his whole investigation was triggered by his desire
for publicity, The Director has instructed that we have no contact
with Garrison or any member of his staff and that we stay meticulously
out of Garrison's investigation. It appears Garrison is looking for
an attempt to dump his investigation on this Bureau and the Director |
has instructed that we should avoid such possibility "like a plague."

SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITIES ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES

The field of education has long been a major
target of the Communist Party. The communists’ emphasis
on students in the recent past was best expressed by
the Party's General Secretary, Gus Hall, when he stated
“Communism is big, really big, on college campuses now.
You've got to play the ball game where the players are and
the really good players are in college." Today there is
considerable unrest and agitation on college campuses
throughout the Nation. Subversive agitators constitute the
major source behind this unrest and, from a long-range
viewpoint, these campus subversives may well become seriously
damaging to our national security. In light of this, the
FBI will continue to carry out its defined responsibilities,
whether they be on the college campus or elsewhere, while
at the same time respect the spirit of academic freedom on
which our college system is based.

The two major student and campus groups in the
United States today are the communist-inspired W. E. B.
DuBois Clubs of America, with an approximate membership of
425 members, and the Students for a Democratic Society, with
approximately 5,000 members. The Students for a Democratic
Society has been described by Gus Hall as a new left group
which the Party has “going for us."

Today there is a concerted effort on the part of
student groups to "knock" the FBI and other Government
agencies off the college campuses and to prevent such
agencies from carrying out their assigned duties. For
example, in early March, 1967, a handful of Students for
a Democratic Society members at Duke University, Durham,
North Carolina, alleged that the FBI in conducting investi-
gations on that campus was infringing on academic freedom
by securing information from responsible campus officials
and students. While we have interviewed officials and students
at the University in matters within our jurisdiction the
charges that the FBI was infringing on academic freedom are
baseless?

* Another example involves allegations made by a
group of “liberal” faculty members at State University College,
Brockport, New York. This group alleged that the FBI was
having faculty members "spy" on other faculty members, again
raising the cry of infringement of academic freedom. These
charges also were baseless and without foundation.

TRAVEL OF THE PRESIDENT TO URUGUAY

At the request of the White House, a representative
‘of this Bureau recently traveled to Uruguay and participated
in briefings, surveys, and discussions relating to security to
be provided for the President when he attends the Summit
Conference of heads of American States to be held in Punta
Del Este, Uruguay, during the period 4/12-14/67, The same
Bureau representative is returning to Uruguay to assist a
White House group in the implementation of security measures
prior to the President's arrival, A general assessment of
the situation in Uruguay at the present time indicates that
adequate security can be provided to the President if he
restricts his travel to Punta Del Este. If he travels to
Montevideo proper, security problems could arise because of
a very militant Communist Party which already is manifesting
its protests to the President's visit. The Communist Party
in Uruguay practically controls the labor movement and
potentially is in a position to paralyze facilities such as
light, gas, water, and street transportation, Furthermore,
there is a good potential for committing sabotage and inciting
riots. Under the present plan, the President will not go
into Montevideo proper, Security problems at Punta Del Este
are greatly minimized because the geographic location and
the resort-type atmosphere do not present any serious
obstacles for instituting good security, The police and
security services in Montevideo are not efficient by our
standards, and it will take continuing prodding to make
certain that the necessary security measures are carried
out. The political stability of the Uruguayan Government is
not good. There is a new Government which is shaky and is
suffering economic problems. There have been a series of
strikes during the last several weeks. We have been told
that there will be between 1500 and 2500 newspapermen who
will attend the conference. There may be some commotion
among -them because of inadequate housing and communication
- facilities. Newspaper reporters may alsorfind it disappointing
to find any news of real gignificance at Punta Del Este if

WIRE TAPS AND OTHER COVERAGE UTILIZED IN THE

INTERNAL SECURITY FIELD

Wire taps are utilized only in the internal security
field and when absolutely essential to carrying out our
investigative responsibilities. Their number varies and as
of this date we have 42 wire taps in operation, In addition

The importance of utilizing wire taps in the internal
security field.cannot be overemphasized in viéw of the dangers
that exist in the internal security of the United States. The
intelligence data obtained from such ,coverage makes it: possible
to keep appropriate officials of our Government currently
aware of the activities, plans, stratégy, and tactics of
subversive organizations and individuals. Also, information
gathered from these sources is of immediate interest to the
United States intelligence agencies and officials of the Govern- \
ment in the formulation of plans in the foreign policy field. had

We are not utilizing any microphone surveillances,
mail covers, or trash covers in connection with our investiga-
tions. We are utilizing security informants and confidential
sources to provide us necessary coverage. Currently, we have

(326 lsecurity informants who are members of the Communist Party
and some of these are operating at the highest level. In view
of the valuable coverage these informants provide us, we place &
great deal of emphasis on their utilization, It may be
interesting to note that during (1965, 15 Jof our security infor-
mants became members of the Communist Party and this was ae
increased to[30\informants becoming members of the Party in eee)

_ In this connection, we noted that during those two years while
f453informants became members of the Party’, [39] discontinued
their association with the Party primarily due to personal
reasons, thus leaving us a total gain offsix informants in the
Party. |

COUNTERESPIONAGE WORK AGAINST THE SOVIETS.

The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR)
and its intelligence organs constitute the major counter-
espionage problem confronting the FBI. The United States
is the major target against which the Soviet espionage
apparatus is directed. All information received from
sources in a position to know confirms this. At this time
529 Soviet officials with 643 dependents are in the
United States, Of these officials, 225 are known and
suspected Soviet intelligence officers, There has been
a, steady annual increase in Soviet intelligence officers
to this country.

—_—

We have achieved substantial success in pene-
trating the Soviet espionage apparatus. We are currently
operating two Soviet intelligence officers as defectors-
in-place (FEDORA and SHAMROCK). They are furnishing
detailed information on Soviet intelligence operations and
on Soviet policies pertaining to this country.

: ~
Another Soviet intelligence officer (TOPHAT) who
} was eee operated by us, and who subsequently went
7 home, was posted to a country in the Far East (Burma).
{ Contact has been re-established with him and he continues
_ to. furnish information on Soviet moves and operations,

a Three Soviet officials who were successfully :
operated by us during their duty tour in the United States
are presently out. of touch in the Soviet Union (NICKNACK,
MITER, and KITTY HAWK), They constitute excellent potential

i for future exploitation if their government subsequently
Hf sends them on an assignment to another country.

CHINESE COMMUNIST INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

Communist China today has no diplomatic establishment in
the United States and its major intelligence efforts directed
against this country emanate’ from two major sources, [the United Nations
and the New China News Agency office in Ottawa, Canada

We have identified two ethnic Chinese employees of the
United Nations,Secretariat in New York as Chinese communist intelli-
gence agents, { The first, Paul You, is a Senior Interpreter engaged
in collecting sensitive United Nations documents which are transmitted
to Communist China through an accommodation address in Switzerland.
FAN Chia-ching, also employed as Interpreter at United Nations, has
been in close contact with the Chinese Communist Consulate in
Geneva, Switzerland, and during recent months with a member of the
U.S. military who has a "Top Secret" clearance and is knowledgeable
in the field of ballistic missiles. FAN has been positively identified
as a Chinese communist intelligence agent. | :

[through our liaison with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police,
we have learned that the Chinese communists are building a base in
Canada for intelligence operations directed against this country.
The New China News Agency (which is used as an arm of Chinese
intelligence) in mid 1966 sent an agent to New York City and
Washington, D. C., with the specific assignment of establishing a
cover for a resident illegal agent,

Ta Bureau informant who has been directed against the
Chinese communists since 1964 returned to the United States March 13,
1967, following a mission to mainland China in behalf of the FBI.
This informant had a series of conferences with Chinese communist
intelligence officials, has been recruited to operate in the

“United States in behalf of the Chinese communists, and was furnished

a clandestine communications address in Canton, China. We,
of course, will use this informant to uncover other Chinese communist
illegal activities in this country.

Inf anticipation of Red China's admission to the United
Nations, we, have greatly stepped up our efforts in the past two
years to build a solid base of quality informants to operate

COMMUNIST PARTY’, USA

The Communist Party, USA, is operating in an
atmosphere of optimism as a result of the March 3, 1967,
decision of the United States Court of Appeals, Washington, D.C.,
which stated that the Party could not be forced to register
under the provisions of the Internal Security Act ‘of 1950.
The feeling. throughout the Party is that it has won its fight
for existence and now must move to capitalize on-this: victory
by becoming an effective force on the American scene.

Within this week the Party adopted various programs
in an effort to move out of its isolation from the American
people. It is working toward the establishment of a daily
newspaper which is expected to be in operation in time to
have an effect on the national elections in 1968, Originally,
the Party planned to merge peace, labor, and civil rights
groups into a new political party which would nominate a
candidate for President of the United States in 1968. Now,
the Communist Party is seriously considering running its own
candidates for the offices of President and Vice President of
the United States in 1968.

May 1, 1967, is to mark the institution of a
massive recruiting drive by the Party to take advantage of
the favorable Court decision and each Party district is -being
instructed to start making plans for this recruiting drive
now. In addition, Party leaders have called for more infile
tration by Party members into the trade union movement in
an attempt to regain the power. the Party had in this movement
in the 1940's,

The Party believes that youth must be the central
concentration for its work in the future, In order to have
the most impact on the young generation and to gain recruits
quickly, the Party must make an effective appeal to youth,
Therefore, it is instituting a massive campaign against
United States policy in Vietnam, instituting resistance to
the military draft, and encouraging all types of demonstrations
by youth, The Party also will start a movement to have Congress
pass a bill guaranteeing full employment for all youth,

The Party considers recruiting of youth its most
important project in 1967. Current plans call for doubling
the number of youth in the Party during the Summer of 1967,
and the nationwide establishment of Party schools to fully
indoctrinate these youth recruits in the principles of
Marxism.

DEMONSTRATIONS PROTESTING UNITED STATES
INTERVENTION IN VIETNAM OQ

Since United States aircraft attacked selected
targets in North Vietnam folloying torpedo-boat assaults
against destroyers in the Guilty onkin in early August,
1964, there have been in the United States almost daily
demonstrations to protest United States intervention in
Vietnam. Many of these demonstrations have reached major
proportions, q

The Communist Party and other subversive groups
such as the W.E.B. DuBois Clubs of America, a communist-—
inspired Marxist-oriented youth group; the Socialist Workers
Party, which has been designated as subversive by the Attorney
General, and its. youth affiliate, the Young Socialist Alliance;
the Workers World Party, a communist splinter group and its
youth affiliate, Youth Against War and Fascism; and the
Progressive Labor Party, a pro-Chinese Marxist group,have
actively supported and participated in demonstrations along
with the Students for a Democratic Society, a militant youth
group which has been described by Gus Hall, General Secretary
of the Communist Party, USA, as a group which the Party has
"going for us." Pacifist groups such as Women Strike for
Peace, Women's International League for Peace and Freedom,
the Committee for Nonviolent Action, and the National Committee
for a Sane Nuclear Policy have also taken a leading role in
sponsoring such demonstrations, Summaries showing the
highlights of these demonstrations are furnished to the
White House and other Government officials two or three times
a week,

The Spring Mobilization Committee and the Student
Mobilization Committee, both of which include members of the
Communist Party and other subversive groups in their
membership, are sponsoring demonstrations throughout the
United States April 8-15, 1967, The focal point of the
week-long activity will be massive demonstrations at
New York City and San Francisco, California, on April 15,

The Reverend James Bevel is the National Director of the

Spring Mobilization Committee. Bevel is an official of the
Southern Ghristian Leadership Conference, a civil rights

group which is headed by the Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr.
The Student Mobilization Committee is the brainchild of

Bettina Aptheker, a student at the University of California

at Berkeley and a member of the Communist Party, USA, National
Committee. An attempt is being made to have 500 individuals
burn their draft cards at New York City during the demonstration
on April 15, 1967, as a mass protest against the war and the

draft.

DOMINICAN SITUATION

: The FBI was ordered into the Dominican Republic by
the President in May, 1965, to develop information to be
used in preventing. communists from gaining control in that
country. At the height of the Dominican Revolution, we had
a staff of 14 Agents. In August, 1966, at White House
instructions, we established a permanent Legal Attache office
there staffed with three Agents.

Since his inauguration July 1, 1966, Dominican
President Joaquin Balaguer has brought about a degree of
stability, however, there continues to be strong undercurrents
of dissension. . The rightists reportedly have considered
plots to remove Balaguer. Juan Bosch's political party, the
loser in the June, 1966, election, has been most vocal in
its opposition to Balaguer's programs and only recently
published a document which appears intended to set the
stage for a vast movement of resistance against Balaguer.
The communist groups have suffered much internal dissension
but to establish a common cause could be expected to regroup
as they have in the past. They possibly would be willing
to let Bosch's political party provide the overt leadership.

BOMBING OF YUGOSLAV
DIPLOMATIC ESTABLISHMENTS
IN THE UNITED STATES

JANUARY 29, 1967

Our investigation has developed a great deal of substantial
information implicating the following individuals in a conspiracy
to bomb Yugoslav diplomatic establishments in the United States and
Canada on 1/29/67:

Reverend Radomir Chkautovic Lebanon, Pennsylvania
Reverend Stojilko Kajevic : Youngstown, Ohio
Zivko Kajevic Youngstown, Ohio

Branislav Petrov * Toronto

Becir Rakocevic Toronto

We have evidence of theetings by the conspirators at

Chicago, Illinois, 6/26-28/66; Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania, 8/27-28/66;
Libertyville, Illinois, 9/30 - 10/2/66; and Perrysburg, Ohio, 1/24~-25/67. .

*  Borislav Kornic has admitted to two different individuals
that Kornic, Milan Nikolic, and Desimir Marj anovic bombed the
San Francisco Consulate with explosives Marjanovic transported to
Los Angeles from Cleveland, Ohio. One of the persons to whom Kornic
made these “admissions has testified at the. grand jury; the other is not
willing to testify at this time. :

Other evidence includes proof that Stojilko Kajevic's .
automobile was used prior to the bombings in an attempt to buy dynamite
and a pattern of long distance telephone calls between the suspects at
pertinent times.

Presentation to a Federal Grand Jury, Washington, D. C.,
commenced 3/10/67 but the grand jury is available to hear this case
only on Fridays. Additional witnesses are appearing 3/17/67 and it
is anticipated further testimony will be given the grand jury 3/24/67
and possibly 3/31/67.

. Brandon Alvey, the trial attorney handling this case, has
described the Bureau's investigation as outstanding and said he has
never before seen so mich good information gathered in such a short
time. Alvey states that if there was a statute making it a violation to
bomb diplomatic establishments in the United States, the evidence now
available would support a conspiracy conviction, There is no such
statute; however, the statute the Department considers most applicable
(Section 956, Title-18) makes it a violation to conspire in the United States
to damage property owned by a foreign government in a foreign country.

To successfully prosecute under Section 956, it must be
proven that the conspiracy originated in the United States. No violation
would exist if the conspiracy originated in Canada even if subsequent
discussions and other overt acts occurred in the United States. Itis
unlikely that this point can be established unless a confession is obtained
from one of the conspirators. Alvey is making every effort to develop

_ the necessary evidence on this point in examining witnesses before the
grand jury and has laid the groundwork for possibly forcing testimony
from one or more prime suspects by ‘offering immunity coupled with
a threat of contempt proceedings if testimony is withheld.

Trial attorney Alvey has indicated the grand jury is
enthusiastic but he does not expect to obtain a true bill unless additional
evidence is developed to prove the conspiracy to bomb the Canadian
establishments originated in the United States. We are vigorously
pursuing all logical possibilities to develop such information by
continuing investigation. -. : 7

JAMES RIDDLE HOFFA; ET AL,
OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE

Hoffa and three others are presently serving
prison terms as a result of their conviction in Chattanooga
Federal Court 3/4/64, on charges of obstruction of justice,
The only legal isstes presently pending are two motions in
the Circuit Court of Appeals, Cincinnati, on which
arguments were heard 2/7/67, and a motion for new trial
filed in U. S. District Court, Chattanooga, 2/28/67 alleging
the Government's use of wire tapping and electronic
eavesdropping against Hoffa, his attorneys, and others,
These charges, so far as the Bureau and its personnel are
concerned, are completely false and the Government filed
its response to this motion on 3/10/67. The Chattanooga
court is expected to rule on this motion in the near
future, Although Hoffa is now in prison, his attorneys
have continued unsuccessfully to shop around the U,. S.

release Hoffa on bail pending disposition of the pending
motions. 7 :



ROBERT EARL BARNES
INTERSTATE TRANSPORTAILON OF STOLEN PROPERTY

Robert Earl Barnes is the notorious burglar with
an extensive arrest.record who was the main witness at the
trial in District Court of 5 policemen charged with bribery
and conspiracy. Trial, which ended March 11, 1967, resulted
in the conviction of 3 District of Columbia police officers
and the acquittal of the other 2,

Barnes has admitted to our Agents the theft on
June 12, 1964, of a 34. 10 carat diamond ring (appraised at
$120, 000) from Mrs, John R. McLean, a guest at the
Lucayan Beach Hotel, Grand Bahamas Island, The diamond ring
was transported by Barnes and an associate to New York City
where it was sold. Some of the evidence has been presented
to a Special Federal Grand Jury, however, prosecution of
Barnes for the Interstate Transportation of Stolen Property
violation was held in abeyance pending completion of the trial
of the police officers,

On March 13, 1967, Assistant U. S, Attorney Harold T.
Sullivan who is handling this matter, advised that it was the
specific instruction of U. S. Attorney David Bress that prosecution
of Barnes in connection with the McLean diamond should be
pursued and pertinent witnesses are to be called before the
Grand Jury. : :

BOMBING DEATH OF Hp Ale 37, /¢43
WHARLEST JACKSON 4

AT NATCHEZ, MISSISSIPPI ~ ~

ON FEBRUARY 27, 1967 WN
CIVIL RIGHTS

BOMBING MATTERS ;

A full investigation is being conducted at the Depart-
ment's request concerning the death of Wharlest Jackson at Natchez,
Mississippi, as a result of a bomb exploding in his pickup truck as
he left work at the Armstrong Tire and Rubber Company in Natchez
shortly after 8 p.m. on February 27, 1967.

Jackson had been employed by the Armstrong Company
since June, 1955. On February 20, 1967, he began training for a new
job as a cement mixer, a type of position previously held only by white
men. His particular job was a new position and was based on seniority.
Jackson had held the position of treasurer in the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People in the Natchez branch and is
survived by his wife and five children, George Metcalf, a Negro fellow
employee, also active in the National Assocation for the Advancement
of Colored People, who previously customarily rode to work with
Jackson, was seriously injured ina similar type explosion in 1965,

On the scene examination by Laboratory experts
indicates that a high-order explosive was detonated under the cab portion
of Jackson's truck directly beneath the driver. Fragments of wire
recovered at the scene appear t6 be wire from an electric blasting
cap, indicating that such a cap may have been connected to and
activated by the electric wiring system of the truck, Portionsof the
wires to the brake light, tail light, and left rear turn indicator light,
which Were originally located on the inside of the left frame, are
missing as a result of the explosion; No additional physical evidence
has been disclosed to date.

Extensive investigation conducted under the on-the-scene
supervision of Inspector Joseph A, Sullivan indicates that a group known
as the Silver Dollar group is responsible for the bombing. The Silver
Dollar group is reportedly a secret group of Mississippi and Louisiana
Klansmen founded in June, 1965. One informant is presently a member
of the group but to date has been unable to establish the identity of °

persons responsible for the bombing. Intensive efforts are being
made to develop additional sources to furnish further penetration of
the group and to trace the electric blasting cap Probably used to
detonate the explosive,

CLIFFORD A. JONES
PERJURY

Clifford A. Jones, former Lieutenant Governor of .
Nevada who is closely allied with Nevada gambling interests,
was indicted January 5, 1966, on three counts of perjury
as a result of his having testified falsely before the
Bobby Baker grand jury. This testimony concerned payments
Jones arranged through one of his companies of $10,000 to
Baker through Wayne Bromley, a close associate of Baker.
U. S. District Court Judge Gasch presently has taken under
advisement pretrial motions of Jones for continuance of
trial and change of venue.

On March 25, 1965, in response to request of
Criminal Division, Bureau monitored telephone calls from
Bromley to Jones and Baker. Bromley and his attorney had
asked that this be done. Department held such monitoring
would be legal. On March 26, 1965, Department requested
we monitor meeting to be attended by Jones, Bromley, and
Baker at a hotel in Los Angeles. Purpose of meeting was
to get Bromley, a Government witness, to tailor his
testimony to agree with testimony Jones had given, Bureau
declined to monitor this meeting because of lack of security
of the premises involved which presented a risk of disclosure
of the coverage. Department then got Bureau of Narcotics
to assist in monitoring of the meeting.

Recently we have responded to Department's request
regarding Bureau electronic coverage of Jones. Such coverage
involved twenty conversations over four Las Vegas and one
Miami electronic device, All conversations were inconsequential
and have no bearing on perjury charges against Jones. This
coverage will be subject matter of future pretrial proceedings.

tion for the Advancement of Colored People, Forrest County,
Mississippi, was shot into and completely gutted by fire.
Dahmer died the afternoon of the same date in a Hattiesburg,
Mississippi, hospital,

Extensive around-the-clock investigation conducted
by the FBI resulted in the indictment of 15 members of the
White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan on June 22, 1966. ‘The
indictment charged these Klansmen with violation of the
Voting Rights Act of 1965 and Civil Rights Statutes, Those
indicted included Sam Holloway Bowers, Jr. imperial wizard
of the White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan of Mississippi.

A motion was filed on behalf of 13 of the defendants
to dismiss this indictment based upon an objection to the
array of the jurors, Based upon this action the facts were
re~presented to a Federal Grand Jury at Jackson, Mississippi,
which resulted in the indictment of 12 members of the White
Knights of the Ku Klux Klan-of Mississippi on February 27, 1967,
Lawrence Byrd, Sr., who was one of the original 15 indicted,
was named as a co-conspirator but not as a defendant by the
Federal Grand Jury on February 27, 1967.

This matter is presently. pending prosecutive action.

MURDERS OF THREE CIVIL RIGHTS WORKERS

Civil Rights workers Michael Henry Schwerner and
Andrew Goodman, both white, together with James Earl Chaney,
' Negro, were murdered near Philadelphia, Mississippi, on
dune 21-22, 1964.

On October 2, 1964, a Federal Grand Jury indicted
18 persons for Civil Rights violations pertaining to these
murders. These indictments were dismissed October 7, 1966,
on legal grounds on the basis that certain groups, including
Negroes, were excluded from the grand jury panel. This case
was re-presented to the Federal Grand Jury at Jackson,
Mississippi, and on February 27, 1967, indictments were
returned against 19 persons. They are presently free on
bond. No trial date has been set.

Of the 19 persons indicted, 17 are identical to those
previously indicted in this case. Jimmy Lee Townsend, who
was 17 years old at the time of the murders, was the one
who was previously indicted but not indicted at this time.
In addition to those previously indicted, this grand jury
indicted Ethel Glen "Hop" Barnett, former sheriff and present
candidate for sheriff of Neshoba County, Mississippi,
and Sam Holloway Bowers, Jr., Imperial Wizard, White Knights
of the Ku Klux Klan of Mississippi.

The following law enforcement officers were among
those indicted: Lawrence Andrew Rainey, Sheriff of Neshoba

REQUEST-OF ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL
VINSON, MARCH 14, 1967, RE LAKE COUNTY,
INDIANA, CRIME CONDITIONS

Assistant Attorney General Fred M. Vinson, Jr.,
Criminal Division, requested preparation of an extensive summary
crime condition report concerning Lake County, Indiana. He asked
for information on gambling, racketeering, counterfeiting, narcotics,
shoplifting and other such matters, By letter to the Attorney General
on March 16, 1967, we pointed out we no longer make such reports
and our commitments preclude the preparation of such a study, This
is apparently a "fishing expedition" type request for Vinson's and
Petersen's Task Force, We advised them they have reports in
gambling and racketeering-type cases in Lake County, Indiana, where
recent prosecutive action has been taken against hoodlums.

The Department has embarked on a Crime Task Force
Program which solicits the active participation of the various Federal
investigative agencies. We informed the Department that there are
inherent drawbacks to such a program and are not actively partici-
pating init. We have, however, advised the Department that if
matters within our jurisdiction arise during the Task Force Program,
we will handle such upon referral of these matters tous. We have
also agreed to conduct an indices and credit check of grand jury panel
in the Buffalo area, which is to be convened for the Task Force in
operation in that area,

Department attorney Peloquin advised a Canadian police
official that the FBI was participating in a "buy back" of United States
Postal Money Orders and we directed a letter to the Attorney General
on March 8, 1967, pointing out that Peloquin had misinformed the
Canadian authorities on our participation. Y

WIRETAPPING

The Attorney General testified before the House Judiciary
Subcommittee on March 15, 1967, that microphone and wiretapping
were unnecessary in connection with control of crime in the United
States. Various bills to outlaw wiretapping and eavesdropping or to
legalize such practices are pending in the Congress, We directed a
letter to the Department dated March 6, 1967, concerning legislation
proposed by Senator Eastland which would authorize wiretapping and
use of microphones with court approval in organized crime investiga-
tions. We informed the Attorney General that such legislation would
be very beneficial to our efforts in the field of organized crime and
would appear to provide a statutory basis for practices now being
followed in connection with use of such devices in national security
matters, Microphones were of inestimable value in determining
La Cosa Nostra weaknesses and day-to-day organizational moves,
and enabled us to develop excellent informants, disseminate informa-
tion to local authorities and to make counter moves to dry up La Cosa
Nostra sources of income,

In connection with Departmental disclosures of our prior
microphone coverage in cases presently before the trial and appeals
courts, there has been to date no complete reversal of any of such
cases which were actually brought to trial. In several cases, notably,
Kolod-Alderisio in Denver, Colorado; Robert G. Baker in Washington,
D. C.; Frank Peter Balistrieri in Springfield, Illinois; Charles :
Battaglia in Tucson, Arizona; and Gilbert Lee Beckley in Miami,
Florida, disclosures were made and hearings held, and in each
instance the court has ruled against the defendants and in favor of our
position that these cases were not tainted. In the Black case and in
the Schipani case in New York, the Supreme Court has remanded for
retrial and these are still under consideration. + -

of 78 convictions thus far this fiscal year, which represents 30 more
convictions than at a similar time last year. In addition, we have in
excess of 350 individuals arrested and/or indicted and awaiting trial
for violations of these-statutes. As a result of our dissemination
policies of gambling information to local authorities, we have directed
telling blows against La Cosa Nostra members active in this field by
virtue of numerous arrests made by local authorities,

During this fiscal year we have disseminated 159, 823

items of criminal information to local authorities, which is an increase
of 50, 000 items over this same period last year,

In early 1966 we conducted detailed -investigations
concerning six items of possible irregularities (Conflict
of Interest) on the part of Senator Dodd. These investi-
gations were conducted at the specific request of the
Department following its review of voluminous documents
made available by columnist Jack Anderson (Drew Pearson's
leg man), These matters have been under consideration

Standards and Conduct which is now holding hearings con-
cerning Senator Dodd. Vinson's letter is being analyzed

FBI NATIONAL ACADEMY
LAW ENFORCEMENT ASSISTANCE ACT OF 1965

The 79th Session of the FBI National Academy begins
Monday, March 20, 1967. There will be 100 law enforcement
officers in attendance with representatives from 45 states, the
District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and 7 foreign officers from
5 foreign countries (Australia, Canada, Colombia, Malaysia and
Thailand), (The Attorney General presented diplomas to the
graduating class of the 75th Session of the National Academy on
May 26, 1965, when he was Deputy Attorney General. )

On January 25, 1967, the Director sent a memorandum
to then Acting Attorney General Clark requesting that National
Academy representatives be included under the Law Enforcement
Assistance Act of 1965 as soon as possible for financial assistance
in helping to defray living expenses while attending the FBI
National Academy. We referred Mr. Clark to previous correspondence
on this same matter and a reply dated August 24, 1966, that
indicated that such support would be appropriate under the Law
Enforcement Assistance Act. The Director pointed out that while
we anticipate having a continuing demand and desire to attend this
Academy, we do not feel this factor should have a bearing on the
allocation of funds under the Law Enforcement Assistance Act.
It was assumed in the Attorney General's reply in August, 1966,
that in view of the current limited capacity of the Academy plus’
the ample demand and desire of local agencies to send candidates
it would be unnecessary at this time to be concerned about sub-
sistence aid.

It was estimated that Has ett $80, 000 for
subsistence and travel would be needed for the March class and
that it would vary somewhat for each class and that if the Acting
Attorney General approved this concept; the Director stated a
request for a grant would be submitted on proper documents to
the Office of Law Enforcement Assistance.

NW 65360 Docld:32989646 Page 634



We have never received a reply to this memorandum
even though we pointed out that several grants under the Law
Enforcement Assistance Act have been awarded for the conduct
of police seminars and have included funds for financial assistance
of the attendees. The Director may wish to point out to the
Attorney General that we are not asking for this money for the
FBI but that the funds would be helpful to the agency sending the
man to the National Academy. Although we have not conducted
a nation-wide survey, we are aware that many departments do
not submit applications to the National Academy because they
do not have the funds to pay the living expenses of their officers,
while they would be in Washington.

POLICE TRAINING

Assistance in training matters continues to be one of the
most sought after cooperative functions of the FBI. During calendar year
1966, the FBI assisted municipal, county and state law enforcement agencies
in 5478 training endeavors, attended by 163,302 people. Over 1200 Special
Agents of the FBI are trained as police instructors, and during 1966, they
contributed 45,383 hours of instruction time, free of charge, at police
training schools. Assistance is rendered in all types of schools, however,
special emphasis is being placed on police administration and management,
search and seizure, probable cause for arrest, due process in criminal
interrogation, laboratory matters, crime scene search, collection and .
preservation of evidence, human relations in police management, and
police-community relations. :

NEW FBI ACADEMY

In May, 1965, the Director submitted a proposal to the
Attorney General for tke building of a new FBI Academy on the
Marine Corps Base at Quantico, Virginia. This suggestion was
immediately endorsed by the President and the Attorney General.
The Director's proposal outlined that with the new facility, instead
of training 200 local law enforcement officers annually at the FBI
National Academy. we could train 1, 200 and up to 1, 000 local law
enforcement officers in specialized courses. The Congress has
appropriated funds for the construction of this new facility.

The planning and engineering work on the site is in
progress and it is anticipated that the contract for the construction
of the Academy will be let sometime during the summer of 1967. It
is believed that the new Academy will be ready for occupancy during
fiscal year 1969. :

EXECUTIVE ASSIGNMENT SYSTEM

Executive Order 11315 established an Executive
Assignment System for filling positions in Grades 16, 17, and

. 18 of the General Schedule. The FBI was specifically excluded.

The Director by statute has the authority to fill the 110 Super-
grade positions allotted to the FBI. An inventory of skills of
employees throughout the Government in Grades GS-15 through

18 is being established by the Civil Service Commission to fill
vacancies in other agencies and it proposes to include in this
inventory all such employees, including those in the FBI. This
would make our executives available for consideration by other
agencies although we are still exempt from having to consider
employees of other agencies in filling our vacancies. The
Department, therefore, was requested by letter dated December 21,
1966, to approve a letter to the Civil Service Commission request-
ing exclusion of FBI executives from the proposed inventory as
retention by the FBI of its executives is considered essential. We
have been following with the Department but the matter has not yet
been acted upon by the Attorney General.

FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 8, 1967 wh Weer

SYNOPSIS: ae Mel

Director has accepted Attorney General's luncheon invitation
for Friday, September 8. Pertinent items of possible interest for discussion
at luncheon include:

(1) The Attorney General (AG) called Mr. DeLoach on 9-5-67 concerning
FBI's pending requests for approval of electronic surveillances. AG said he
had contacted Clark Clifford and Walt Rostow at White House and also planned to
meet with Dick Helms of Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and General Carter
- of National Security Agency (NSA). AG said Clifford and Rostow were surprised
FBI had so little coverage--and they hinted that because of FBI reluctance to use
surveillances, it might be good idea to transfer FBI responsibilities in domestic
intelligence to CIA. AG said he was opposed to this idea; that it would take time
to. bring Clifford and Rostow around, but FBI would come out ahead and he (the. . we
AG) would have more liberal hand in approving FBI requests. VE fe

: Regarding above, Mr. DeLoach noted it would be premature to i
talk with Rostow or Clifford now; but after a decision has been reached, they 7
could be confidentially briefed on such FBI operations. Information confidentially
obtained reflects that Helms of CIA had a meeting scheduled with AG on 9-6-67--
the subject of which probably was clectronic eee es

(2) On'7- 19- 67, the House passed H.R, 421, which provides Federal.
penalties for intér state travel with intent to incite a ‘riot. Many persons question
its practical and legal usefulness due to difficulty inproying intent...Qur sources
on the Hill indicate there is a hope the bill may be bottled up in committee-~but™
that it will pass the Senate if it reaches the floor. We took rio stand on the bill
with the Department, but did cite examples of interstate travel to areas where

oO Stbst developed. The bill could increase our aideiteeantel responsibilities

RE: LUNCHEON WITH ATTORNEY GENERAL ~

(3) .On 8-8-67, the House passed H.R. 5037, the Law Enforcement and .
Criminal Justice Assistance Act of 1967 (originally the Administration's "Safe
Streets and Crime Control Act")--but with considerable changes, One amend-
ment to the original Act would empower regional institutes to engage in police
training--thus duplicating and competing with FBI police training. This matter
has been brought to attention of FBI friends on Senate Judiciary Committee.

Our Hill sources advise that Senators McClellan and Hruska plan to combine
their bills regarding controlled use of wiretaps and eavesdropping devices and
add this to H.R. 5037.

(4) AG has indicated desire to achieve about 400 convictions in organized
crime field during this fiscal year. As of 9-7-67, a total of 382 individuals in
this field were awaitin: sution. By le ee e called thi

esx attention toa situation wherein 23 persons arrested in New York for gambling

law violations in 1964 were still awaiting final prosecutive action, To date, no

reply has been received from AG.

(5) Latest two issues of "Life'' magazine contain articles by Sandy Smith,
former Chicago newsman, focusing attention on La Cosa Nostra leaders, as well
as their political affiliations, and the need for electronic surveillances to cope
with organized crime. Smith has extensive background and contacts qualifying
him to write on organized crime. It is obvious he obtained help from such persons
as Professor Robert Blakey of Notre Dame, formerly in the Organized Crime
Section of Department.

(6) The "task force" organized under direction of Organized Crime and
Racketeering Section of Department conducted an operation against bookmaker
Ernest Reinhart in Niagara Falls, New York, area and learned from the Customs
Service that the Niagara Falls Police Department was also interested in Reinhart's
activities. According to officials of Niagara Falls Police Department, attorneys
and others on the "task force" appeared at the police department and "took over’
entire investigation. "Task force'' was so inept that it "blew" the case against
Reinhart, and "task force" surveillances were discovered by Reinhart and

-Jassociates.- Although Reinhart's gambling activities were across state lines from
New York to Canada, our Buffalo Office was not notified. Pertinent details were
brought to AG's attention by letter of 9-5-67, and we requested that "task force”
be instructed to immediately advise FBI of matters within our jurisdiction.

RE: LUNCHEON WITH ATTORNEY GENERAL

(7) For first month (July) of new fiscal year, FBI convictions
decreased 189, or 22 percent. Decrease primarily due to: (a) shortage of
Judges and prosecutors, resulting in overcrowded court conditions, and (b)
policy enunciated by Department's Criminal Division to reduce Federal
prosecutions of juvenile offenders. In July, 1966, Assistant AG Vinson sent
jJetter instructing U. S. Attorneys regarding diversion of subjects under age
21 to local authorities--which has principally been felt in Interstate Trans-
portation of Stolen Motor Vehicle violations, where experience indicates
about 65 percent of violators are under 21 and where FBI convictions
decreased 109 in July, 1967, compared with July, 1966. For sometime,
we have been advising AG whenever shortages of Federal judges or shortages

in U. S. Attorneys Offices exist.

DETAILS:

The Director has accepted an invitation for a luncheon with the
Attorney General on Friday, September 8, 1967. There is contained in this
memorandum succinct data concerning pertinent items which might be of
interest for discussion on this occasion. The General Investigative, Special
Investigative and Domestic Intelligence Divisions have contributed salient
information for this memorandum.

ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCES:

On 9-5-67, the Attorney General called Mr. DeLoach ae
the Bureau's pending requests for approval of electronic surveillances. He
said he had finally made contact with Clark Clifford and Walt Rostow at the
White House on 8-31-67 and that he planned to meet with Dick Helms of the
Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and General Carter of the National Security
Agency (NSA) regarding this matter. The Attorney General said Clifford and
Rostow knew little about electronic surveillances and were very surprised that
the FBI had so little such coverage. He said that Clifford and Rostow, without
‘saying so, hinted that because of FBI reluctance to use surveillances, it might
be a good idea to transfer FBI responsibilities in domestic intelligence to CIA.

: The Attorney General said he was opposed to this idea. He
said it would take a little time to bring Clifford and Rostow around but that he
believed the Department and the FBI would come out ahead in the discussions
and that he, the Attorney General, will then have a more liberal hand in
approving requests from the FBI. In this connection, Mr. De Loach noted

- that it would be premature to talk with Clifford or Rostow at this point but
after a decision has been reached, these two individuals could be briefed on
a confidential basis regarding such FBI operations. * It was also noted that it
did not appear the Attorney General could adequately represent the FBI in his
discussions with Clifford and Rostow.

We have confidentially obtained the information that Richard

Helms, Diréctor of the CIA, had a meeting scheduled with the Attorney General
at 5p.m., on Wednesday, September 6, 1967, and that the subject of the
meeting was probably electronic surveillances.

This bill was passed by the House on 7-19-67. It provides for
Federal prosecution of persons who travel interstate with the intent to incite
ariot. Its practical and legal usefulness hag heen anegtioned by a number of
people, including many.Senators, due to the extreme difficulty in obtaining
evidence to prove intent. Our Hill sources have advised there was a hope the
Bill gould be bottled up in committee unless it could be changed to make it
more practical. These sources concede the Bill will pass the Senate without
difficulty if it reaches the floor because many Senators would consider it
politically unwise to vote against it. We took no stand on the Bill with the
Department, but did cite examples of interstate travel by militant Negroes
and hate group leaders to areas where strife developed. The Bill, if passed,
could substantially increase our investigative responsibilities, depending, of

_ course, on the policy established by the Department.

ACT OF 1967:

This is the Administration's bill, originally called the Safe.

Republican- sponsored amendments made when the House passed the bill on
8-8-67. One of these amendments by Congressman Robert McClory (R. -Ill.)
which changed Title 3 of the Bill, would empower the regional institutes to
engage in police training. This would duplicate and compete with the extensive
police training program we conduct on our own and in cooperation with local
and state agencies. This has been brought to the attention of our friends on
the Senate Judiciary Committee. Many of them have voiced agreement and
stated they will take the necessary action to correct this wrong. Our Hill

sources have advised that Senator John McClellan (D.-~Ark.) and Senator Roman
Hruska (R.-Neb.) plan to combine their bills authorizing controlled use of
wiretaps and eavesdropping devices and to add this to H.R. 5037 in Committee.
They feel wiretap legislation as a part of the Administration's crime bill will
have an excellent chance for passage and possible acceptance by the President.

ORGANIZED CRIME:

As of September 7, 1967, there were a total of 382 individuals,
involved in organized criminal activities, who have been arrested, indicted,
or awaiting further prosecutive action in connection with violations of
various Federal statutes.

By letter dated July 27, 1967, the Bureau called to the attention
of the Attorney General 2 situation where 23 individuals arrested in New York
for violations of the gambling laws in 1964 were still awaiting final prosecutive
action. It was called to the attention of the Attorney General that prosecutive
action taken at the earliest possible date with reference to these individuals
would greatly assist in increasing accomplishments in the organized crime
field during the present fiscal year. To date no response from the Attorney
General has been received to this communication.

The Attorney General has indicated that he is desirous of
achieving in the neighborhood of 400 convictions of individuals involved in
organized crime during this fiscal year. With 382 such subjects already
awaiting prosecution, the Attorney General's goal would appear to be readily
available if vigorous prosecutive action is taken of these individuals at the
earliest possible date by the Department.

"LIFE" MAGAZINE ARTICLE:

"Life" magazine has run articles for the last two weeks on
_La Cosa Nostra, which articles were written by Sandy Smith, former crime
reporter for the ''Chicago Tribune '"* Smith has done an excellent job in these
articles in focusing public attention on the Cosa Nostra leaders as well as
their politica] affiliations and the need for electronic surveillances in order
to cope with the menace of organized crime.

= Smith is an outstanding investigative reporter who has a
wealth of independent knowledge built up over the years on La Cosa Nostra.
He also has tremendous contacts among the local and state police intelligence
agencies throughout the country. In addition, it is obvious that he obtained
considerable help from such persons as Professor Robert Blakey of Notre
Dame, former Departmental Attorney in the Organized Crime Section, in

 kand "Chicago Sun-Times. "- (CONTINUED - OVER)

connection with this article. He also has used the information disclosed
from our microphones in court cases in such cases.as the Raymond
Patriarca matter, etc.

DEPARTMENT TASK FORCE, BUFFALO, NEW YORK:

In October, 1966, under the direction of the Organized Crime
and Racketeering Section of the Department, a "task force" was organized
as an-investigative operation, supervised by Department Attorneys, and to
which were assigned representatives from various Federal investigative
agencies.

On August 21 and 23, 1967, the "task force" conducted
investigative activity, including physical surveillances in the Niagara Falls,
New York, area. The subject of its investigation was one Ernest Reinhart,

a bookmaker from Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada, who was said to be
making trips daily to Niagara Falls, New York, to establish regular contacts
and gambling pickups from other known gamblers. The Niagara Falls, New
York, Police Department, which was also investigating the activities of
Reinhart, had requested the assistance of the United States Customs Service
to develop sufficient evidence to establish a violation of the local gambling
statute. A representative of the Customs Service notified the "task force"
representatives of the local police department's interest in this matter and
immediately thereafter, according to the officials of the Niagara Falls Police
Department, attorneys and other members of the 'task force" appeared at the
police department and "took over" the entire investigation.

SAC Neil J. Welch of our Buffalo Office has since determined
from representatives of the Niagara Falls Police Department and the Customs
Service that the investigative activity of the "task force" was so inept that the’
case against Reinhart was "blown." (In conducting a surveillance the task force ;
utilized a panel truck and their actions, while in the panel truck, were such that i
they caused the truck to rock back and forth revealing to the gamblers who were
watching, that people were inside the truck.) Surveillances conducted by the
"task force, ' including attorneys assigned thereto, were readily discovered by
Reinhart and his associates. Reinhart remarked to a customs agent at the
border crossing that he would give the investigators a good run around.

+ Although Reinhart's gambling activities were being carried on
between Canada and the United States, that is across state lines, in apparent
| violation of the Interstate Transportation in.Aid of Racketeering Statute , the
FBI Office at Buffalo was not notified. The FBI has a substantial investigative

M. A. Jones to Bishop
RE: LUNCHEON WITH ATTORNEY GENERAL

responsibility in the investigation of violations of this-statute. In this
instance, Customs Service, Internal Revenue Service, and the local
Niagara Falls, New York, Police Department also have investigative
responsibilities.

Pertinent details concerning this matter were brought to
the attention of the Attorney General by our letter dated September 5, 1967,
with the request that necessary instructions be issued to the "task force"
personnel that matters within FBI jurisdiction be immediately reported to
our Buffalo Office. : :

CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS - CONVICTIONS:

At the end of July, 1967, we had recorded 189 fewer con-
victions than were recorded during the first month of the prior fiscal year.
This represents a decrease of 22%, which is primarily the result of two
factors: (1) shortages of judges and prosecutors which result in over-
crowded court conditions and (2) the policy enunciated by the Criminal
Division of the Department to reduce prosecutions in Federal court relating
to juvenile offenders. :

In this connection, our potential for increasing conviction
statistics was decimated as a result of a letter sent during July, 1966, by
Assistant Attorney General Vinson instructing all U. S. Attorneys to give
primary consideration to the diversion of subjects under 21 years of age to
local authorities. These instructions are being followed by a majority of
U. S. Attorneys and have hurt us principally in Interstate Transportation of
Stolen Motor Vehicle violations where experience has shown that approximately
65% of all violators are under 21 years of age. At the end of July, 1967, we
recorded 109 less convictions in this category as compared to the first month
in the previous fiscal year. : :

We have for sometime been following the practice of advising

the Attorney General whenever shortages of Federal judges, U. S. Attorneys

or their assistants exist, For example, we recently sent the following letters
to the Attorney General’ bing to his attention shortages of judges or U. S.
Attorneys in the indicated areas: :

tetas

9-1-67, Southern District of Georgia;
8-16-67, Eastern District of Michigan;

8-17-67, District of Kansas;

8-3-67, District of New Jersey;

8-2-67, Southern and Northern Districts of Mississippi;
7-31-67, Western District of New York.

M. A. Jones to Bishop
RE: LUNCHEON WITH ATTORNEY GENERAL

In connection with the situation in the Western District of
New York, we originally called this to the Attorney General's attention on
3-30-67 and we have received no information indicating that an appointment
has been made for the vacant judgeship. Considerable newspaper publicity
has attended the failure to appoint a judge for this district.

With regard to the two vacant judgeships in the Eastern District

* of Michigan, it is noted that we first called this to the Attorney General's

attention on 3-16-67 and we have not received any current information
indicating these judgeships have been filled.

Each SAC has been instructed to keep the Bureau currently
advised of any shortages of judges or U. S. Attorneys and we will continue
to bring these matters to the attention of the Attorney General.

As an example of shortages which have been brought to the
Attorney General's attention, in connection with the shortage of judges in
the Southern District of Georgia, it is noted that as of September 1, 1967,
there was a total of 87 Bureau cases awaiting prosecution involving 121
defendants. Of these 22 representing 32 subjects have been pending prose-
cution for more than six months.

It is also noted that in the District of -New Jersey as of
July 1, 1967, there were approximately 200 Bureau cases awaiting prose-
cutive action involving approximately 392 defendants. Our New York Office
has also advised that it has 775 cases awaiting prosecution representing 874
subjects.

Washington, D, C.

Individuals affiliated with two organizations funded
in part by OEO were involved in the disturbance which occurred
in the House of Representatives on 8/7/67 in protest of the
shelving of the so-called "Rat Bill." The leader, Jesse Gray,
a former Communist Party organizer in Harlem and a militant black
nationalist, is the head of the Harlem Back Street Youth, Incor-
porated, which was the recipient of OEO funds. Such funds have
since been suspended, Gray and at least one othér member of the
above organization were arrested for their part in this disturbance.
Also involved in this disturbance and arrested was Robert Bailey
Ransom, an employee of Volunteers in Service to America (VISTA)
Associates, an OEO-funded organization.

Hate-type Schools

The New York City Police Department advised on 8/9/67
that the walls of a school handling a program entitled "Special
Training in Reading" for children 8 to 10 years of age contained
numerous hate slogans. Examples of the signs noted thereon were
"Don't love them to death, shoot them to death; make revolution
not war; burn, baby, burn; arm yourselves; Johnson is losing
sleep; Newark, '67; Chicago South Side, '66; Watts, '65, and
Harlem, '64,'' There was also a picture of President Johnson's
face superimposed on an Army sergeant carrying a rifle captioned
"Public Enemy Number One, Wanted for Murder."' The committee
handling this particular program was funded in part by OEO,

A somewhat similar situation occurred in Nashville,
Tennessee, in connection with a "Liberation School" which has
been in operation teaching 10-and 1l-year-olds, Antipoverty
funds from OEO had been earmarked for the school; however, the
funds were*withdrawn when national publicity resulted concerning
this matter. Meantime, however, certain services including the
rental of an automobile and school supplies had been furnished.

MISUSE OF FBI INFORMATION BY OEO

In connection with the recent arrest by Kentucky
authorities of Alan and Margaret McSurely, employees of the
Southern Conference Education Fund, and Joseph T. Mulloy, an
employee of an organization being funded by OEO, on a state
sedition charge, someone in OEO apparently leaked to the press”
a report’ prepared by an OEO investigator which contained state-
ments attributed to the FBI, An article concerning this matter
appeared in the 9/1/67 issue of "The Evening Star."

The Director approved the lodging of a vigorous
protest with OEO concerning the fact that information appearing
in an FBI memorandum subsequently was published in "The Evening
Star.'' In approving this action, he noted "Yes, and if they
can't or won't give us the necessary assurances against leaks,
we will cut off all investigative services to OKO,"

Such a protest was lodged through liaison with
Mr, Edgar May, Assistant Director, OEO, on 9/5/67 who advised
that steps had been taken to insure that such did not recur
in the future, A detailed memorandum is attached.

STATEMENTS AGAINST ESTABLISHED LAW AND ORDER

While no direct evidence has come to the Bureau's
attention of outright.seditious statements on the part of anti-
poverty workers, allegations have been received of statements
against established law and order and of statements tending to
incite the people. Examples follow:

Marion S, Barry, Jr., former Washington Director of
the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, joined the United
Planning Grganization, Washington, D, C., as a $50-a-day consultant
on 7/21/67. This organization is funded by OEO. On 6/30/67 Barry
reportedly conducted a press conference on the steps of the 13th
Precinct, Metropolitan Police Department, at which time he
denounced the Police Department and stated that Negroes would

continue to threaten the police until policemen are trained
properly in how to deal with Negroes, Captain Al Prezio of the
Troy, New York, Police Department, advised on 8/25/67 that
Freeman Robinson, an employee of an antipoverty organization
funded by OEO, uses the office of the antipoverty organization
as a headquarters to conduct militant civil rights work and to
recruit teen-agers to incite riots and arouse a Negro community
on any issue that would create racial unrest,

Willie Wright, a duly-elected board member of the
United Community Corporation, Newark, New Jersey, is alleged
‘to have made statements concerning Negro rioting such as "To
hell with President Johnson when he says something about not
tolerating riots. We've tolerated these conditions for more
than 400 years." He is also quoted as having said: "It is my
firm conviction that in order to overcome the white man's complete
human and legal jurisdiction over my black brothers and sisters,
we are going to defend ourselves against all kinds of aggressions
that are being perpetrated against us by the white man. I most
emphatically want to make sure the majority of my black brothers
and sisters have a piece of firepower in their home possessions
oo to protect themselves against the most brutal atrocities to be
seen anywhere committed by the New Jersey National Guard, the
Newark and State Police in the recent rebellion in the City of
Newark," The OEO has requested Wright's suspension pending its
investigation of statements attributed toWright.

"The Washington Post" of 9/13/67 ‘contained an article
by Columnist Roscoe Drummorid captioned "Mayors Say OEO Programs
Helped Suppress City Riots" in which he refers to a nationwide
survey conducted by OEO in 64 cities, ‘half of which had riots
this summer, In citing OEO figures he pointed out that of 30,000
Community Action employees only 16 were arrested during the course
of the riots and none were convicted. Poverty programs had 244
buildings in the hearts of the riot areas with none being burned
or destroyed, :

Ratliff instructed his staff members to give the FBI no informa-

want nothing but "stool pigeons." This individual further

communities, He further alleged that Ratliff is the driving
force behind a program of racial agitation in Dallas County:
and that his statements to staff members are antiwhite and
antipolice, He said it is his belief that Ratliff is trying
to create a crisis in Dallas in order to receive additional
antipoverty funds, :

The source of the above information also alleged
that in April of this year Ratliff was vigorously critical of
the Dallas Police Department regarding the arrest of a 15-year-
old Negro female on a charge of disturbing the peace and was in
the process of organizing a march on city hall to protest the
arrest when officials of the Office of Economic Opportunity
learned of his activity and told him to desist, He stated that

in another instance several months ago, Albert Lipscomb (phonetic),

staff member, learned of a plot by a group of Negro men who were
in possession.of rifles and Molotov cocktails to initiate a riot.
He claimed that Lipscomb personally prevented the riot by calming
the Negro group and personally collecting the rifles and Molotov
cocktails but that when Ratliff learned of Lipscomb's role in
preventing the riot, he officially took credit for the action.
Qur source stated that Ratliff unofficially considers Lipscomb
an "Uncle Tom."

: The above information is being made available to

Mrs, Stegall at the White House, Mr, Shriver of the Office of
Economic Opportunity, and the Attorney General by letters dated

Racial Unrest on College Campuses Campuses throughout U. S.
have been marked by racial unrest. Minority groups such as
Black Student Union becoming increaSingly militant and violent.
Demdnds unreasonable. Other militant groups have joined in
demonstrations and offer full support to minority groups.

‘Black Panther Party is most active, notorious and violence-prone

black extremist group. Branches in 25 cities. Will possibly go

underground. Minister of Education is George Mason Murray, a2
suspended instructor at San Francisco State College.

Soviet and Satellite Espionage The U. S. is the number one
espionage target of Soviet Union and satellites. Intelligence
operations coordinated by Soviet Union. Embassies and missions
are focal points. As of February, 1969, approximately 230 Soviet

Suggestions for the Reduction of Crime in the District of Columbia
Should be an Enabling Statute which would’allow juveniles to be
handled as they are throughout U. S. Mandatory sentences recom-
mended for crimes committed with the use of firearms.
Registration of all convicted felons should be considered.
Abolishment of capital punishment should be opposed until a life
sentence means "life!!’ Provisions of Bank Protection Act of 1968
should be accelerated. ;

Assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. Intensive FBI
investigation revealed killer of King on 4/4/68 to be James Earl
Ray. Ray arrested by Scotland Yard 6/8/68. Extradited to U. S.
and turned over to local authorities in Memphis, Tennessee, for
State prosecution. Local trial scheduled for 4/7/69.

Alleged Violations of Federal Corrupt Practices Act by 21 Political
Committees We were instructed by former Assistant Attorney
General Vinson to interview the Chairman and Treasurers of 20
Republican Committees and one Democratic Committee that filed
late reports with the Clerk of the House. White House staff mem-
bers réfused to be interviewed. Investigation going forward on
expeditious basis. Department being kept advised.

SPECIAL INVESTIGATIVE OPERATIONS

Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs (BNDD) Since the Bureau
of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs (BNDD) was-formed under the
jurisdiction of the Department, the-FBi has been conducting back-
ground investigations on its applicants and employees. This was
done pursuant to Departmental Order #175-59, dated 4-1-59.
However, the BNDD was discovered to be conducting some dupli-
cate investigation-of their clerical applicants. We objected to this
wasted effort and expressed our views to the Department which
countered with a proposal advanced by Associate BNDD Director
Giordano, that we share parts of these investigations with them.

By letter of 2-6-69, in reply to this proposal, we informed the
Department that no additional requests for BNDD applicant investiga-
tions would be accepted, except those submitted under the

provisions of the Federal Employee Security Program.

Martin Edward Underwood Underwood, an employee of the
Department of Commerce, who was detailed to the White House in
1966 to serve as an advance man for former President Johnson,
was removed from his office at the White House on 2-6-69, and the
Department of Commerce has been instructed to inform him that
his services are no longer required. Our investigation of Underwood,
which was furnished the White House on 2-12-69, disclose that he
had severe drinking problem until at least 1964,

°
Virginia Stanfill Savell We auucied a discreet inquiry of Savell
in September, 1966, at the request of former Senator Kuchel (R)
of Califernia, for whom she then worked in his Los Angeles office.
It had been alleged she was operating a bookie joint out of the
Senator's office but our inquiry developed no information to sub-
stantiate this. However, it was reported that she was an alcoholic.
Current investigation revealed Savel attempted to commit suicide
in July, 1967, by overdose of sleeping pills.

Donald Edward Ganoung We have investigated Ganoung as a
Departmental applicant for the position of consultant with the Law
Enforcement Administration at Washington, D. C., the position
he now holds. He has a degree in criminology and is a former
Episcopalian priest who has worked among deviate elements. He
has also been active in civil rights and antidraft demonstrations
and twice was arrested in this connection. Divorced by his wife
in 1967 aiter he had an affair with another woman, Ganoung also

The results of our investigation of him
‘were mished to the Attorney General on 2/11/69,

William Henry Rentschler Rentschler, a candy company operator,
has been extremely active in Illinois Republican Party politics. He
carried on a notorious adulterous relationship which led to a divorce
from a former wife. Our investigation of him revealed many
prominent persons who would not recommend Rentschler for a
position with the Government in view of his moral weaknesses and
reported lack of business acumen. Our- investigation not yet com-
plete but summary memo furnished the White House on 2/10/69.

Special Inquiry Investigations for the White House Security officers
of various Government agencies have expressed shock at the lack

of knowledge or the total disregard of the provisions of the Federal
Employee Security Program by the White House staff responsible
for filling top-level positions with the new Administration. Most
requests for investigation have been of persons already firmly estab- :
lished in their new jobs. When derogatory data is developed it is 6
simply requested that the investigation be continued. Only one person

is known to have been discharged as a result of derogatory information
developed during investigation. Don Virdin, Internal Revenue Service

(IRS), called Bureau 2/13/69 and indicated Bureau had checked through

IRS only 8 of last 25 publicly announced Presidential appointees.

Bureau has run checks of IRS on all requests received from White

House on Presidential appointees and it would appear White House

only asked for 8 of last 25 to be checked,

c .

Selective Service These cases in recent years have broadened in
scope with recurring schemes to obstruct the draft. We have 14, 000
pending investigations, up 5,000 from a year ago. Fiscal year 1968
produced 809 convictions and the first seven months of this fiscal
period have recorded 380 convictions, an increase over this period
ayear ago, An interesting case is summarized which involves an
18-year-old Californian whose mother, following his arraignment
for failure to register for the draft, attempted to get a Restraining
Order by contending that she was responsible for her son's actions

e

NW 65360 Docld:32989646 Page 669



and therefore should be punished rather than him. The Judge
rejected her appeal and her son's trial is scheduled for March,
1969.

Criminal Intelligence and Organized Crime While our

organized crime investigations are aimed at key members in the
power structure, they have also struck hard in the lower echelons
with progressively greater penetration into the heart of hoodlum
activities - gambling operations. Fiscal year 1968 capped four
consecutive record years in convictions of organized crime figures
with 281, There are now 789 other hoodlum figures awaiting trial
jn Federal court thus indicating a continuance of the upward trend
in convictions in fiscal year 1969, Recént major accomplishments
in the organized crime field include the arrest or conviction af
many top La Cosa Nostra leaders across the country. Our dissem-
ination of criminal intelligence data to other Federal and local law
enforcement agencies has broken the million mark in number of
items in the past five years. This shared FBI data enabled other
law enforcement agencies to conduct hundreds of raids, execute
thousands of arrests, and recover millions of dollars in gambling
funds or stolen property each year. Department Task Force
Operations (also called Strike Force) have been formed in Detroit,
Michigan; Brooklyn, New York; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania;
Chicago, Illinois; Miami, Florida; and Newark, New Jersey; since
the original group at Buffalo, New York. We now maintain liaison
with these Task Force groups and it has been recommended that
we expand our liaison arrangements with Task Force. There have
been La Cosa Nostra leadership changes in New York and Chicago.

Department's Manual for use of Electronic Surveillance Under Title

Til of Omnibus Crime Control Bill Attorney General has been fur-

nished our views regarding Department's draft manual for use of
electrical surveillance pursuant to Title II bf Omnibus Crime Control
Bill, the general provisions of which concern administrative regulations
not specifically required by the statute itself. The manual’s requirements
would impose tremendous administrative and procedural restrictions

on the FBI and other Federal agencies to the point that strictcompliance
might be self-defeating to the goal of maintaining discreet electronic

surveillance coverage under court supervision for the purpose of
obtaining admissible evidence against the leadership of organized
crime and in other major investigative categories. Included would
be requirements for review of an application for a court order ata
number of levels within the Department, and by the Attorney General,
before the application reached the judge, involving delay and the
spreading of information about our use of this technique among a
comparatively wide range of authorities. Included in our views

was our belief that for the Government's ultimate success in making
use of this evidence gathering procedure, restrictions must not apply
which will create more limitations on law enforcement than the statute
itself prescribes.

_ during the fiscal year 1968 totaled 3,845,461 hours, the equiva-
lent of 1,849 additional employees on a full-year basis. Taking
into consideration the limited extent to which this overtime was
compensated under fringe benefits regulations of the Civil Service
Commission, there was a cost-free saving to the Government of
over $14 million when compared to the value of the total overtime
performed. This is a tremendous voluntary contribution by our
investigative staff.

National Crime

While preliminary crime figures for calendar year
1968 are not yet available, for the period January through
September, 1968, over the same period in 1967, the Crime Index
nationwide recorded a 19 percent increase. The largest increases
were noted in cities 250,000 to 1 million population where a 22
percent rise was.recorded. Nationally, the violent crimes of
murder, forcible rape, robbery and aggravated assault as a group
increased 21 percent and the more voluminous property crimes of
burglary, larceny $50 and over and auto theft rose 19 percent. There
were an estimated 4.6 million serious crimes in the United States
in 1968 compared to 3.8 million in 1967.

National Crime Information Center (NCIC)

7 NCIC is a nationwide index of documented law
enforcement information on crime and criminals. Its objective
is to improve the effectiveness of law enforcement through the
more efficient handling and exchange of information. In January,
1967, a pilot operation was begun with terminals in 15 local and
state law enforcement agencies. NCIC now has 78 control termi-
nals in 47 states, the District of Columbia and Canada. North
Carolina and Wyoming will be added in the near future; however,
Alaska will be delayed due to very high communication circuit _
costs. The files consist of stolen motor vehicles, license plates,
firearms, other identifiable stolen property including securities,
and wanted persons. Over 780,000 records are in the system and
more than 33,000 messages are handled each day. Positive
responses to inquiries wherein a record is furnished now exceed.
220 each 24 hours. NCIC is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a
week.

New Left Movement

The New Left movement, an amorphous, undisciplined
collection of malcontents, has led a wave of extremism on our
college campuses which has been marked by growing violence and
lawlessness. During the past year a surge of bombings and
arsons, along lines advocated by New Left extremists, has.
accounted for over $2,000,000 in damages to property consisting
mostly of college facilities and U. S. Government property.
The New Left movement in this country is clearly an integral
part of a worldwide revolutionary movement of students and
young intellectuals, New Leftists from the United States have
played an important role in demonstrations which have taken
place in England, France, West Germany, Japan, and Mexico,
They have established and maintained contacts with representa-
tives of communist and other leftist organizations abroad
through meetings, conferences, and correspondence; traveling
to communist countries, such as Cuba, Czechoslovakia, Hungary,

Racial Unrest on College Campuses

Campuses throughout the United States have been
marked by racial unrest as exemplified by the current disrup-
‘tions at San Francisco State College, San Francisco, California;
and the University of California, Berkeley, California. Such
groups as the Third World Liberation Front, a coalition of
minority groups, and the Black Student Union are becoming
increasingly militant and violence prone in presenting their
demands to college authorities. Demands made by such groups
include the establishment of a separate college for minority
groups, particularly Negroes; the establishment of black
courses; the hiring of minority group professors and adminis=
trators; and the control of hiring and firing of faculty mem-
bers by, students. At San Francisco State College over 400
individuals have been arrested during a current wave of dis-
ruption and attempts are being made to force the College to
close, Students for a Democratic Society and other militant
groups have joined in these demonstrations and offer full
support to minority groups.

Black Panther Party

The Black Panther Party is the most active,
notorious, violence~prone black extremist organization, In
the past nine months it has established branches in 25 cities
across the country with a hard-core membership of at least 1,200.

- The latest development is the order from national
headquarters to stop recruiting for a time in order to weed
out informants and undesirables and concentrate on political
indoctrination based on the writings of MAO Tse-tung of Com-
munist China, There is also increasing discussion of the
necessity for going underground.

The Black Panther Party Minister of Education
George Mason Murray, a suspended instructor at San Francisco
State College, holds a position off the Central Committee of
the Black Student Union at that College. The Black Student
Union instigated the campus unrest which has plagued this
institution during the current school year,

Soviet and Satellite Espionage

The United States is the number one espionage
target of the Soviet Union and its European satellites
(Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, and Romania).
The intelligence operations of these satellites are coordinated

against the United States by the Soviets. The embassies of
these countries in Washington and their missions ‘to the

United Nations in New York are focal points for their espionage
activities. As of February, 1969, there were approximately
230 Soviet personnel and 117 satellite personnel with intel-
ligence assignments operating out of their respective official
inhiaatexan sai nnniaieas

This represents since’ February, 1959, a 210%
increase in Soviet intelligence personnel and a 100% increase
in satellite intelligence personnel,

A Consular Convention between the United States
and the Soviet Union became effective July 13, 1968. This
would grant diplomatic immunity from criminal jurisdiction
for Soviet Consular personnel in the United States and
United States Consular pergonnel in the Soviet Union, On
August 13, 1968, the Soviet Foreign Ministry proposed
establishment of a Soviet Consulate General at San Francisco,
California, in return for a United States Consulate General
in Leningrad, There has heen ne progress in negotisticns
regarding establishment of Consulates since last August.
Establishment of a Soviet Consulate in San Francisco will
increase Soviet capability for espionage,

the Central Intel

: of Justice.

‘Assassination of President John Fitzgerald Kennedy

The essence of the Clay Shaw trial in New Orleans
lies in the connection New Orleans District Attorney James C.
Garrison is attempting to establish between Lee Harvey Oswald,
David Ferrie (now deceased), and Clay Shaw. The principal
witness has been Perry Russo who has said Oswald, Ferrie,
and Shaw discussed assassinating President Kennedy at:a
meeting in Ferrie's apartment in New Orleans in September,
1963,

: Immediately following the assassination of President
Kennedy, the FBI received allegations of a connection between
Ferrie and Oswald. These allegations were thoroughly and
exhaustively investigated, No evidence was ever developed
that Oswald and Ferrie were acquainted. Clay Shaw's name
never came up in the investigation and the FBI never
investigated him.

: The FBI has held to a “hands-off" policy regarding
Garrison's investigation, Although we are closely following
Shaw's trial, we have no observers in the courtroom, It is
noted that the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice
has an unofficial observer in the courtroom.

Garrison's mental stability is questionable. He
received a medical discharge in October, 1951, from the U. S.
Army for an emotional problem. He admitted to Army authorities
that he had received psychiatric treatment, Garrison was a
Special Agent of the FBI for four months, resigning to
re-enter military service in July, 1951.

GENnRAL INVESTIGATIVE OPERATIONS
SUGGESTIONS FOR THE

REDUCTION OF CRIME IN
THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.

In connection with the juvenile problem in the District of
_Columbia, it is suggested that an Enabling Statute be passed which
would allow juveniles to be handled in the District of Columbia as they
are throughout the United States; publicize the names of the juveniles
involved in serious crimes and maintain and make available juvenile
records to law enforcement agencies. In areas of high crime,
improved street lighting should be installed. .

Mandatory sentences are recommended for crimes
‘committed with the use of firearms or involving threats, anda
habitual criminal statute might be effective. Consideration could be
given to the registration of all convicted felons in the District, as
well as a law requiring registration of firearms.

Authorities responsible for allowing prisoners to be
released under the ''Work Release Program" should thoroughly
consider their prior records so that vicious felons will not be returned
to the streets. In addition, prosecutors should not accept guilty pleas
on one count while dismissing other counts; and abolition of capital
punishment should be opposed until a life sentence means "life."

As a deterrent to bank robberies, District banks should
on a voluntary basis accelerate the implementation of the provisions
of the Bank Protection Act of 1968, and consideration should be given
to the deployment of one police officer and a bank guard to selected
institutions.

More stringent penalties should be invoked for violations
of gambling laws, and sentences should be made cloacal for second
offenders.

ASSASSINATION OF MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.

The entire facilities of the FBI were committed
to the investigation of the assassination of Martin Luther
King, Jr., in Memphis, Tennessée, on 4-4-68, and within
five days the man then known as Eric 8, Galt.was developed
as a prime suspect, From a check of latent fingerprints
against those of white male fugitives for whom "wanted"
notices had been placed in the files of the FBI Identification
Division, James Earl Ray was determined to be the true
identity of Eric S. Galt. At the request of the FBI, Canadian
authorities determined that a Canadian passport had been
issued to Ray in the name of Ramon George Sneyd, and on
June 8, 1968, Ray was arrested by Scotland Yard when he
presented the Sneyd passport to travel from London to
Brussels, At the conclusion of extradition proceedings,
Ray was returned to the United States in custody of FBI Agents
and was turned over to local authorities in Memphis, Tennessee,
for state prosecution, Local trial is scheduled for April 7,
1969,

BARBARA JANE MACKLE - VICTIM
KIDNAPING

On December 17, 1968, 20-year-old Barbara Jane Mackle
was ‘abducted from an Aulanta, Georgia, area.motel. A $500, 000
ransom demand was subsequently made of her father, Robert Mackle,
a Coral Gables, Florida, resident and business official. FBI
investigation resulted in the safe return of Miss Mackle, who had
been buried in a coffin-like box northeast of Atlanta, Georgia; the
recovery of most of the ransom money; and the apprehension of one
of the subjects, identified as.Gary Steven Krist. An all-out investi-
gation continues to locate Ruth Eisemann-Schier, the other subject
in this case. Federal charges were filed in Miami, Florida, against
subjects for violation of Extortion Statute, Interstate Transportation
in Aid of Racketeering Statute, and the Aiding and Abetting Statute.
The subjects were indicted in DeKalb County, Georgia, for kidnaping
on January 13, 1969. The Bureau has furnished results of its
investigations to local authorities and is cooperating in the state
trial which will be held in this matter, Krist was brought before the
circuit court in DeKalb County, Georgia, on February 7, 1969, at
which time the court appointed two attorneys to represent him. One
of the attorneys is James R, Venable, who has been for many years
Imperial Wizard for the National Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, Inc.
A three-week delay was requested by the attorneys, and the judge set
the next appearance for February 28, 1969.

DISCONTINUANCE OF BACKGROUND
INVESTIGATIONS ON CLERICAL
APPLICANTS FOR THE BUREAU OF
NARCOTICS AND DANGEROUS DRUGS
(BNDD)

The Bureau has been conducting background
investigations on applicants and employees of the BNDD
Since that agency came under the jurisdiction of the
Department, These investigations were conducted pursuant
to Departmental Order #175-59 dated April 1, 1959.

Our Chicago Division learned that BNDD had been
conducting preemployment checks to include credit and :
criminal investigation, interviews with former employers,
supervisors, and references. On January 21, 1969, both
Assistant Attorney General for Administration Pellerzi
and Associate Director Giordano, BNDD, agreed with the
Bureau's position that conducting duplicate investigations
of clerical applicants for BNDD was a waste of time and
money; however, on February 4, 1969, Mr. Giordano reversed
his position and stated he wanted to run credit and
criminal checks and contact the last two employers to
see if they had any further interest in the clerical applicant.
The Bureau would. then be asked to complete the investigation,
Mr. Giordano was told that BNDD should do their own clerical
applicant investigations entirely or the FBI should do
them entirely. The Director noted that he wanted no part
of divided responsibility and this position was confirmed
in our letter to Mr. Peklerzi dated February 6, 1969,
copy attached. This letter advised that effective
immediately we would not accept any additional requests for
investigations of clerical applicants and that, if during
the course of investigations of these people by BNDD,
they should find subversive derogatory information, then
the case should be referred to the Bureau for a full field
investigation under the provisions of the Federal Employee
Security Program.

Since February 6, 1969, we have not accepted
any “requests for investigation of clerical people for BNDD.

MARTIN EDWARD UNDERWOOD

Underwood, aged 54, was employed for a number of
years as a salesman in Illinois and Maryland. Since 1961 he
‘has been employed by the United States Government, for the
greater period by the Department of Commerce, and the Small
Business Administration. He was detailed to the White House
in 1966 as an advance man in connection with the travels of
former President Johnson,

| : “We conducted an investigation of Underwood for the
i White House in 1965 which revealed he had a serious drinking
problem prior to the investigation and was considered an
alcoholic at one time. He is unmarried and has had two divorces,
the first of which was precipitated by his drinking. Several
people interviewed in the 1965 investigation would not recon-
mend Underwood because of his drinking on the West Coast in

1964, After President Johnson's departure Underwood continued

to hold an office on the first floor of the Executive Office
Building, apparently gaining the favor of Vice President Agnew.
On February 6, 1969, Underwood was removed from his office

and his White House pass has been taken. The White House

has been in contact with the Department of Commerce, on whose
payroll Underwood has been while working at the White House,

and advised the Department of Commerce to inform Underwood

his services are no longer requiréd.

Persons interviewed during our current investigation
state Underwood apparently stopped drinking in 1964 and no
longer has the drinking problem. Results of current investigation
were furnished White House in memorandum dated February 12, 1969.
Several interviews and one agency check remain to be handled,

WILLIAM HENRY RENTSCHLER

William Henry Rentschler, aged 43, former news-
paper reporter, has been co-owner and/or President of a
candy company since 1956, He has been extremely active in
Republican Party politics in Illinois for the past several
years. He was involved in adulterous relationship with a
woman other than. his wife for approximately three years and
later married that woman, This was a well known fact by
those interviewed and Senator Dirksen said his involvement
in notorious divorce action presents serious question of
his suitability for employment by the Government. Senator
Percy indicated Attorney General Mitchell recently told
him Senator Dirksen had indicated Rentschler could not pass”
the rigid background investigation by the FBI. During the
investigation Rentschler was described as articulate and an
intelligent individual who is knowledgeable in the field of
politics. Several persons pointed out he lacks business ~
ability, fails to follow through on details and does not have
a feeling for finances. Some individuals did not recommend
him for a position of trust, some recommended him with reser-
vations, and some recommended him highly. A summary memorandum
containing the resuits of investigation to date was furnished
to the White House on February 10, 1969. Outstanding investi-
gation consisted of an interview of Maurice H, Stans, Secre-
tary of Commerce, and several other individuals who have
been unavailable for contact. Secretary Stans has been inter~
viewed and states he cannot recommend Rentschler due to un-
favorable hearsay information concerning his alleged financial
irresponsibility and his moral life. Additional investigation
is necessary based on information furnished by Secretary Stans.

SPECIAL INQUIRY INVESTIGATIONS FOR THE WHITE HOUSE

Conscientious security officers in various
governmental agencies, many of whom are former Special
Agents of the Bureau, have been shocked at the lack of
knowledge or the total disregard of the provisions of the
Federal Employee. Security Program by the eight or nine
individuals at the White House responsible for filling
top-level positions in the new Administration, This
first came to our attention shortly after November 6,
1968, when Franklin Benjamin Lincoln, Jr., and
William Rittenhouse Harman moved into the Pentagon
as the vanguard of the transition team, They had no
clearance for highiy classified information and when i
no request was forthcoming for a full field investiga-
tion of these persons, the security officer at the
Pentagon requested the investigation.

This matter came to a head on February 10, 1969,
when the Secretary of Commerce was told by the White House
to write a letter certifying that prospective Assistant
Secretaries were cleared politically and from a security
standpoint, When the Department of Commerce was told we
had received no request for a full field investigation,
that Department was informed by the White House the FBI
had done a “24-hour check." The Department of Commerce

_ would not accept this since the Federal Employee Security

Program requires that no critical sensitive jobs should be
filled unless a full field investigation is first conducted.

Most of the requests for investigations received
thus far from the White House are in connection with persons
who have been publicly announced and are already firmly
established in their jobsS.. As a result, instead of dis-
continuing investigation upon the development of derogatory
data the White House requests the investigation be continued
and at the present time we know of only one person the
Administration has discharged. This was a stenographer
in Mr. Ehrlichman's office by the name of Helen Galanoplos,
who had two brothers and a sister-in-law who were members
of the Communist Party.

In connection with White House investigations Don Virdin
of Internal Revenue Service (IRS) cailed the Bureau on February. 13,
1969, Virdin stated that IRS had checked their files in connection with



the last 25 persons publicly announced and confirmed by the Senate.
He stated that this check revealed that the Bureau had only asked for

’ IRS information in connection with about 8 of these 25 people. He
stated he felt this was strange because there was some rather inter-
esting information in connection with some of these people, such as
the fact that one of these individuals, whom he did not identify, had
not filed an income tax return for the past three years. (We have
run checks on all requests received from the White House on
Presidential appointees and it would appear from the above that the
White House only asked for us to conduct investigations on 8 of the
last 25 publicly announced appointees. )

SELECTIVE SERVICE

Selective Service investigations conducted by the
Federal Bureau of Investigation in recent years have
broadened to cope with recurring schemes to obstruct the
draft. At the present time, we have slightly over 14,000
pending investigations, compared to 9,000 a year ago.

In fiscal year 1968, 809 convictions were recorded
as compared to 763 convictions the previous fiscal year.
For the first seven months of fiscal year 1969, 380 convictions _
were recorded compared to 374 convictions recorded for a :
similar period in the preceding fiscal year. It appears
that such a trend will continue duririg the current fiscal
year.

There follows a brief summary of an investigation
of interest concerning a Selective Service inatter.

At San Francisco in October 1968, it was learned
Erik Alfred Whitehorn, aged 18, had not registered with
Selective Service because his mother, Evelyn Whitehorn,
had refused to grant permission. For his failing to register,
Whitehorn was indicted, on November 20, 1968,

Following arraignment and release on his own
recognizance, a Complaint and Petition for Injunction and
Temporary Restraining Order against registration for the
draft was filed in behalf of the subject. It claims if a person
under 21 years of age cannot vote, contro} or dispose of
his own property, serve on juries, marry, contract or litigate,
then he cannot register for the draft without his parents'
consent. Therefore, the mother, by teaching her son
principles of morality and by influencing him to follow his
own conseience, bears the main responsibility and should
be punished instead of her son. The Judge hearing this
case ruled that the son must stand trial for refusing to
register for the-draft and rejected the mother's appeals.

A date for the trial of Erik Whitehorn has been
scheduled for March 19, 1969.

CRIMINAL INTELLIGENCE
AND ORGANIZED CRIME

The main thrust of our investigations of organized
crime has been aimed at the key members in the power structure
of La Cosa Nostra in order to secure their imprisonment and
to disrupt leadership. We have also struck hard at the lower
working level who are the money producing figures for the
top echelon leaders. With progressively greater success, we
have made deeper penetration into the heart of the hoodlum
syndicate, the illegal gambling operations from which it
draws much of its vast resources.

Prosecutions of hoodiums, gamblers, and vice figures
for violating the laws within the Bureau's jurisdiction
have been steadily increasing. For the fourth consecutive
year, convictions have reached new highs, as evidenced by the
fact that during Fiscal Year 1968, our drive against organized
crime resulted in the conviction of 281 organized crime and
gambling figures, compared with the 197 convictions during
the preceding year. In addition, there are now 789 other
individuals awaiting trial in Federal court. The substantial
backlog of individuals. awaiting further prosecution indicates
that the upward trend of convictions will continue during
Fiscal Year 1969. However, it is apparent that if we are to
continue to be effective in our drive against the hoodlum

element, prosecutions of these matters must necessarily receive .

high priority.

Recent Major Accomplishments

Among our most recent major accomplishments are:
the conviction of Ernest Sansone, Chicago Hoodlum, and five
associates on February 12, 1969, in connection with a wide-
spread race wire dissemination service; the arrest of John
Philip Cerqne, current top leader of organized crime in the
Chicago area, along with two accomplices on February 7, 1969,
in connection with the operation of a large-scale gambling
organization; the conviction of West Coast hoodlum figure,
John Roselli, on February 3, 1969, for running an interstate
gambling operation; the conviction of William Daddano, des-
cribed as the Sth ranking mobster in Chicago, and four

Dissemination Program

As a result of our dissemination program, 287,004
items of criminal intelligence “type" informationwere dissem-
inated to other Federal, State,.and local law enforcement
agencies during Fiscal Year 1967, 300,244 such items were
disseminated in Fiscal Year 1968, and during the first six
months of the present Fiscal Year we have disseminated 153,214
items. Over one million such items Have been disseminated
during the past five years.

With respect to dissemination of information
concerning local gambling operations to other Federal,
State, and local law enforcement agencies throughout the
United States for Fiscal Year 1968, a total of 721 raids
took place; 3751 individuals were arrested of whom 1170 were
convicted; paraphernalia seized amounted to $ 1,395,069 and
United States currency confiscated amounted to $624,028. In
the first six months of the present Fiscal Year 329 raids
have taken place, 1787 individuals have been arrested, ‘of
whom 771 have been convicted; paraphernalia seized amounted
to $221,021, and United States currency confiscated amounted
to $273,701. :

Department of Justice Task Forces on Organized Crime

.

In the Fall of 1966, the Criminal Division of the
Department initiated the Task Force Operation (also called
Strike Force) and the first one began operation in Buffalo,
New York. These Task Forces consisted of a group comprised

NW 65360 Docld:32989646 Page 696



of Departmental attorneys and investigative personnel from
several different Federal investigative agencies, The FBI
was invited to assign personnel but declined because of its
overall commitments requiring utilization of all of its
Agents. However, we have extended complete cooperation in
the form of information in investigative reports and have
promptly handled all cases within our investigative juris-
diction that were referred to us from the Task Forces.

Since the initial Task Force at Buffalo, the Depart-
nent has formed such groups in Detroit, Michigan; Brooklyn,
New York; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Chicago, Illinois;
Miami, Florida; and Newark, New Jersey.

We now maintain liaison with the various Task
Forces but not on a full-time basis.

It has been recommended that (1) we continue to
cooperate on a full-time basis, from the standpoint of
furnishing information to the various Task Forces, (2) that
the Director indicate to the new Attorney General that we
will be happy to assign an FBI Inspector to serve as liaisen
with the Department Task Force office in Washington, D. Ca,
(3) that a supervisory employee would be assigned by each
SAC to a specific Task Force when such Task Force is established
within a given area where one of our field offices is located,
for liaison purposes.

La Cosa Nostra Leadership Changes

In ‘the New York City area where La Cosa Nostra
"Commission" member Thomas Luchese died during 1967, no
successor has been named to date, primarily because the FBI
was responsible for the arrest and/or conviction of the four
leading contenders, all "captains" or ranking members of the
Luchese "family." 7 :

In Chicago, John Philip Cerone, who was being groomed
as the top leader of La Cosa Nostra group in the Chicago area,
“was arrested on February 7,1969, for Interstate Gambling
Activities, Cerone was the interim Chicagd leader for Sam
Giancana, who fled to Latin America following his release from
Federal prison and his successor, Sam Battaglia, who is in
Federal prison for violating the Anti-Racketeering Act.

In New York, veteran New York hoodlum Paul Sciacca
presently is the “boss" of a New York City La Cosa Nostra
“family" once headed by the notorious, controversial Joseph
Bonanno.

S DEPARTMENT’S MANUAL FOR USE OF ELECTRONIC
SURVEILLANCE UNDER TITLE III OF OMNIBUS
CRIME CONTROL BILL

The Attorney General has been furnished our views
with regard to the Department's draft manual for use of electronic
surveillance pursuant to Title III. The general provisions of :
this. lengthy manual, much of which concerned administrative
regulations not specifically required by the statute itself,
would impose tremendous administrative and procedural restrictions
on the FBI and other Federal agencies to the point that strict
compliance might be self-defeating to the goal of maintaining
discreet electronic surveillance coverage under court supervision
for the purpose of obtaining admissible evidence against the
leadership of organized crime and in other major investigative
categories, These requirements involve an investigative agent's
application for intercept authority to be reviewed by a
comparatively wide range of authorities including the Organized
Crime and Racketeering Section of the Department, in many cases

_ the United States Attorney, the Assistant Attorney General,

Criminal Division, and finally the Attorney General before the
request even reached the court which, according to the provisions
of this statute, is the ultimate authority and control in the
use of this procedure. This process would, of necessity, be
time-consuming, cumbersome, and, at certain points, repetitious,
and would spread the knowledge of the use of this technique
among a number of different governmental offices,

We noted that the draft manual made repeated reference
to the problem of probable cause becoming "stale" and observed
that the sheer weight of the deliberative process at various
approving levels before it even reached the judge could alone
result in the probable cause becoming "stale." We also noted
that requirements involving daily memoranda to the United States

-Attorney concerning the progress of a court authorized surveillance

and other similar administrative requirements would. tend to place
burdens on investigating agents which could detract from the
ultimate purpose of our use of this technique.

In connection with the manual*s requirement that
an authorized surveillance be terminated when the subject of
the surveiilance departed the premises covered, we questioned
that such a requirement was called for in the statute and whether

-24-



Cr °@ @

Congress, in providing this important added tool in the
evidence gathering process, intended that such a restriction
applied. We also noted that the draft suggested that in all
cases when an application for an order is denied, those named
in the application would be informed that the Government
intended to subject them to electronic surveillance. With
regard to denied applications, we contend that this notice
requirement pertains only to those situations where emergency
intercepts have been made without court order, and thereafter
the court has denied the application and not to all applications
which might be denied in the normal course of buSiness pursuant
to the main body of regulations in Title III.

We concluded our observations to the Attorney
General that while it was appreciated that the drafting of
guidelines in this matter presents extremely sensitive problems,
it was believed that for the Government*s ultimate success in
making use of this evidence gathering procedure, restrictions
must not apply which will create more limitations on law
enforcement than the statute itself prescribes,

and operates a major loan-shark racket in the Buffalo area on
behalf of Joseph Fino, the "underboss" of the Magaddino family.
On 4/23/69, the Attorney General approved a recommendation for
microphone and technical surveillance at two of Billiteri's

Attorney General authorized a Department Attorney to handle
the filing of affidavits with the Federal court in Buffalo,
New York, to obtain the necessary court order for the
electronic surveillance sought, pursuant to Title 3 of the
Omnibus Crime Bill. The Department Attorney, in conjunction
with our Buffalo office, was to make application to the court

ANTIRIOT LAWS

Chicago Cases :

On March 20, 1969, the Federal Grand Jury at Chicago,
Illinois, based upon extensive Bureau investigations, returned
indictments against seven leaders of the New Left and one leader
of the Black Panther Party all of whom were charged with
Antiriot Laws violations in connection with the Chicago disturbances
at the time of the Democratic National Convention. Trial has been
set for September 24, 1969.

San Francisco Case

After extensive FBI investigation the Department commenced
grand jury proceedings on April 23, 1969, at San Francisco in i
connection with Antiriot Laws violations allegedly committed by
three Black Panthers who gave instructions in the use of firearms
and explosives during a conference held by the Black Panther Party
in San Francisco last November.

Philadelphia Case

We have conducted extensive investigation into Antiriot
Laws violations in connection with the Black Power Conference held
in Philadelphia in August and September, 1968, Approximately 3, 000 i
to 4, 000 Negroes from all over the country attended this conference i
during which five subjects provided instruction in the use of firearms
and explosives for a closed meeting of approximately 70 persons.

.

Inauguration Disturbances ee

.

On April 18, 1969, the Department requested investigation of
fifteen subjects who allegedly came to Washington, D. C., on inauguration
day for the purpose of creating disorders. This investigation is being :
conducted on an expedite basis. : i

Campus Disorders t

At the present time there are also a number of Antiriot Laws
investigations being conducted with regard to recent campus disorders,

NW 65360 Docld:32989646 Page 704 -4-



most notably at Brandeis University where two professors from San
Francisco State College allegedly contributed to the seizing of the
Administration Building on January 8, 1969, and American University,
Washington, D. C., where members of the Students for a Democratic
Society allegedly traveled to Washington, D. C., and participated in
seizing a building on the campus on April 23, 1969.

INTERSTATE TRANSPORTATION
OF-STOLEN MOTOR VEHICLE
INVESTIGATIONS (DYER ACT)

In the fall of 1967, the former Attorney General and his
staff held conferences with various United States Attorneys (USA)
here in Washington, D. C. Following these conferences, we learned
of a divergence of opinion among USAs concerning the Department's
views in prosecuting Interstate Transportation of Stolen Motor Vehicle
(ITSMV) cases. Some had the opinion that only automobile theft ring
cases should be prosecuted in Federal court while others were of the
opinion that only cases having commercial aspects should be considered
for such prosecution. Other USAs felt only cases possessing aggravated
circumstances should be considered. Some continue to consider each
ease on its individual merits. During the period October, 1967,
through May, 1968, we wrote four letters to the former Attorney
General requesting the Department's views concerning the prosecution
of these cases. Ina letter dated April 12, 1968, to the Department,
we set forth our views that prosecution of Dyer Act cases in-Federal
court should not be restricted to commercial matters and to adults,
but rather that each case should be considered on its individual merits.
None of these letters were answered. On March 5, 1969, we wrote the
present Attorney General informing him of the divergence of opinion among
USAs. This letter also requested the Attorney General furnish us his
views concerning this matter; however, an answer has not been received
to date. :

UNIVERSAL FIBREGLASS CORPORATION
FRAUD AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT

Following a partial audit by General Services
Administration, we instituted an investigation, at Depart--
ment's request, of alleged overcharges to the Government by
Universal Fibreglass Corporation (Universal) on a $13 million
contract to produce mail delivery trucks. All logical investi-
gation has been completed and reported except the review of the
Universal records. Access to the pertinent records was recently
achieved through court action and an extensive audit is now
being pressed. Criminal prosecution of several subjects is
now indicated.

Congressman H. R. Gross (R-Iowa) has’ publicized
this matter. Press items have indicated that the office of
then Senator Hubert H. Humphries may have been instrumental
in having the contract awarded to Universal.

YOUTH PRIDE, INC.
FRAUD AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT

In January, 1969, following administrative investi-
gations by General Accounting Office and Department of Labor,
the Department requested we review subpoenaed records of
Youth Pride, Inc., a Washington, D. C., organization funded
by Labor Department to help underprivileged youths, to
identify individuals participating in payroll padding in
violation of Fraud Against the Government Statutes. Grand
jury began hearing witnesses March 10, 1969.

CHROMCRAFT, CORPORATION; ET AL.
FRAUD AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT

We conducted an extensive investigation in this case

_ of a multimillion dollar fraud scheme in which “paper" corpora-

tions were formed to act as subcontractors in connection with
the production of rocket launchers for the U. S. Navy. Millions
of dollars in overcharges fo the Navy were channeled by subjects
into Swiss bank accounts. On August 7, 1968, two corporations
and four individuals, including Francis Rosenbaum, a Washington,
D. C., tax attorney, were indicted in Washington, D. C., on
charges of conspiring to defraud the Government of more than

$4 million. Trial date is set for September 8, 1969. On
January 29, 1969, civil suits were filed in Federal courts in

Washington, D. C., and St. Louis, Missouri, demanding judgment

for double damages arising from the fraud charges in the criminal
indictment.

. LOUIS WOLFSON
INFORMATION CONCERNING

7 At request of the Department, received April 17,
1969, we are ascertaining subscribers to some 400 telephone

the Florida farms of Louis Wolfson, who was recently

convicted in two Securities and Exchange Commission cases

in New York. Most gf these have been determined and furnished
Criminal Division. Remaining are being expedited and results

Administration Administrator (GSA), in return for obtaining
commitments from GSA for Government occupancy of office
buildings in Baltimore, Maryland, and Durham, North Carolina,

INTERSTATE TRANSPORTATION OF

STOLEN PROPERTY (ITSP)

THEFT FROM INTERSTATE SHIPMENT (FIs)
CONSPIRACY

Captioned investigation concerns theft ring operating at
John F. Kennedy International Airport, New York City. Special
Prosecutor Daniel P. Hollman, Department of Justice Task Force, is
presenting evidence to Federal Grand Jury wherein 15 to 17 indictments
anticipated probably April 30, 1969. Organized Crime Section of the
Department of Justice and Attorney General Mitchell particularly interested.

In October, 1968, four individuals, including Steinschreiber
and Mario Alessi, were arrested by the FBI in connection with theft of
drugs. Since that time, Alessi, a Pan American Airways cargo
supervisor, has been cooperating and named others in connection with
pharmaceutical thefts amounting to over $100,000, as well as a series of
general merchandise thefts, such as furs, jewelry, and firearms
probably in excess of $250,000 involved. Alessi has identified Raymond
Wood, U. S. Customs Examiner, as being involved. Wood has been
interviewed, but denies complicity. Customs Agency has been apprised
of Wood's alleged involvement.

This Bureau has long been aware of the serious problems of
thievery at airports in the New York metropolitan area, particularly at
John F. Kennedy International Airport. Special Agents of this Bureau are
assigned on the scene at that airport and are actively handling investigations
of violations within our jurisdiction. In performing our duties, we enjoy
close working cooperation with other law enforcement agencies, with
the airlines, and with the Airport Security Council formed in 1968 to
cope with these problems.

In accordance with the Director's instructions, I attended the
captioned briefing which was commenced at 5:03 p.m. by. the Attorney General who
introduced the Director and the Director thereafter briefed all attendees on the
work of the FBI. As the attendees arrived for the meeting I made available to each
individual the bound FBI exhibit to which they could refer in following the Director's
presentation. There were 29 departmental representatives present at this staff
meeting. They were very attentive to the Director's presentation as indicated by
the many questions following the Director's discussion. When the Director was
providing the conference with the number of Negroes employed by the FBI, including
Agent and clerical breakdown, Deputy Attorney General Kleindienst interrupted the
Director and asked the Director to repeat these figures in order that he might
record them.

At approximately 5:25 p.m. the Attorney General left the room to
receive atelephone-call. The Director questioned Deputy Attorney General
Kleindienst as to whether he should continue or wait for the Attorney General's 4
return. Mr. Kleindienst suggested the Director wait until the Attorney General’ \_
returned. a

Mr. Kleindienst asked the Director concerning his references to the
volume of civil rights work - whether this included both civil and criminal investiga-
tions handled by the FBI under the Civil Rights Statutes and the Director replied
in the affirmative.

-

Mr. Kleindienst then’ referred to the number of organized crime type
cases the Director said are pending prosecutive action. He said are these all
organized crimeindividuals. The Director replied they all have some connection
with the many facets of organized crime. The Director went on to say many of
these cases are’pending a year or two and he felt if we had swift prosecution and
substantial punishment a greater inroad could be made in removing the menace of
organized crime. Mr. Kleindienst then commented that he felt that some of the

problem here might be due to the resourcefulness of the organized crime subject's
attorneys. The Director replied that certainly this is true where such shysters

as Edward Bennett Williams represent these characters and he uses every technical
trick to avoid prosecution and conviction. The Director went on to say that Attorney
Kuntsler does the same thing in his field.

At this point, Wilson's Deputy, Petersen, of the Criminal Division,

took this opportunity to point out to Kleindienst that what is needed here are more

’ Assistant United States Attorneys, whereupon the Solicitor General added that
Federal judges were also needed. Kleindienst then asked Petersen if he had studied
these cases and the reason for delay that Mr. Hoover referred to and Petersen
stated he did not have these figures at the end of his tongué but he had a survey

| made and,as-he recalled it, there were 185 of these type cases delinquent six months
or more. The others were delayed because of some court motion or action. The
Solicitor General asked whether there was any concentration of these cases and
Petersen said the Southern District of New York. Kleindienst then asked Petersen
how many Assistant United States Attorneys he needed to do the job and Petersen
said he could not give him a figure; however, he said he felt the District of
Columbia's, for example, staff could be increased by half again as many at least
and other appropriate increases would be necessary in major metropolitan
centers. :

Mr. Hoover at this point, pointed out Senate Bill 30 is going to put
the FBI, if passed, into the local gambling picture and that we, in order to fulfill
our responsibility, will probably have to ask for an additional 600 Agents. He
pointed out that he hoped that the Criminal Division would draw up appropriate
guidelines to prevent local authorities from relinquishing their responsibilities
to also investigate local gambling.”

At approximately 5:35 p.m., Deputy Attorney General Kleindienst
advised the conference that the Attorney General was called to the White House
and requested the cine ina with the briefing. At approximately 5:55 p.m. ,
the Director completed his briefing and was congratulated by the Deputy Attorney
General for the excellent presentation and the Deputy then opened the floor for
questions. :

: Memorandum J. J. Casper to Mr. Mohr
Re: Attorney General's Staff Conference
Wednesday, April 8, 1970, 5:00 p.m.

Assistant Attorney General Leo M. Pellerzi, Administrative Division,

referred to the FBI exhibits and in particular Exhibit No. 25 and questioned
Mr. Hoover as to why the State of Virginia had such a high number of Laboratory
examinations. Mr. Hoover explained that Virginia had no Laboratory and that
that was the reason for the high usage of the FBI Laboratory. Mr. Hoover took
this opportunity to explain the FBI's policy in not making our experts available
when local experts have already examined the evidence or are going to testify as to
the evidence. He also explained there are many "phonies" who are traveling about
the country conducting examinations and testifying but we, in these cases, have

* briefed the prosecuting attorneys in advance. The Director explained that in such
places as New York State where they have their own Laboratories they only use
our Lab for the more sophisticated examinations.

Deputy Attorney General Kleindienst then questioned the Director as
to the basic qualifications for the position of Special Agent. The Director explained
that they all had to be either lawyers or accountants or college graduates majoring
in science or language. The Director emphasized again that we have no discrimina-
tion and that we have many fine Negro Agents in the FBI, pointing out that only last
week he gave a meritorious award to a Negro Agent from our Detroit Office who had
developed valuable informants in the Black Panthers and related organizations in
that area. Kleindienst then asked the Director approximately how many applicants
we turn down for each Agent that we accept. The Director explained that for every
100 applicants 90 of them are turned down. He said that we carefully interview
these men, investigate them, test them, and give them thorough physical examina-
tions to make sure they meet our high standards. The Director told the conference
that he has a standing rule that if any Agent in Charge recommends an Agent or
clerk who is a hippie type; that is, long hair, sideburns, etc., this Agent in Charge
is going to lose his office, and we are going to get rid of the applicant. He said he
‘would not tolerate any hippie types in the FBI and do not want our Agents going into
Federal court looking like hippies. 7

The Director pointed’ out that many of our young clerical employees
are going on to school to become Agents, and he demands the same discipline of
these young people. He also pointed out that some 6,000 people a day tour our
facilities and we don't want them getting the idea the FBI has any hippie types.

As a matter of fact, the Director said with a smile that he would like to declare
open season on these hippies just like you have open season on the deer and shoot
them. :

) Memorandum J. J. Casper to Mr. Mohr

Re: Attorney General's Staff Conference
Wednesday, April 8, 1970, 5:00 p.m.

Mr. Kleindienst was also interested in the scope of our work and in
this regard the Director took this opportunity to point out that he did not believe the
FBI should be investigating every bomb threat and that he hoped that if the new bomb
legislation as proposed by the President is passed the Department's Criminal
Division will set appropriate guidelines. The Director pointed out that many of.
these major cities have very_excellent bomb squads and they are fully equipped to
handle these complaints. He said why should the FBI be paralleling work done by
competent local authorities. He said, of course, in the local areas where they have
no people qualified, then this is a different matter. The Director said in all of these
cases we are always willing to make our FBI Laboratory facilities and Identification
facilities available as well as assist the local authorities by covering out-of-state
leads. .

Assistant Attorney General Johnnie M. Walters asked the Director
if he could see any lessening of the problems that he talked about in the foreseeable
future. The Director said in the organized crime field, if the steps he has
recommended are taken, he feels there will be a decrease. With regard to the
disorders in colleges and in the high schools and caused by the militants he said
this is another story. The Director cited the incident of one’ of the subjects in the
Chicago Seven trial appearance last night at American University and thereafter
going to Catholic University and then leaving town. He said that apparently these
university administrators will not call in the local police, and he said it was dis-
graceful how they threw rocks, destroyed property and set fires at American
University. He then also cited the incident wherein attorney Kuntsler after he went
out to Santa Barbara, California, gave a speech, and then left town, that Santa
Barbara was the victim of three days of looting and burning. The Director cited
the violence promised in New Haven when Bobby Seale is brought to trial whereupon
the Solicitor General commented that the judge who is going to try that case was his
law school roommate. The Director said that this is a very serious situation and
it is entirely possible that violence will occur when Seale is tried. The Director
pointed out that we have appropriately advised all local-authorities of this possibility.

—

The Director then cited the tremendous problems that Judge Hoffman
in Chicago had im handling the trial and said that one could hardly blame him for some
of his actions in view of the provocative acts on the part of the subjects and the
attorneys. TheDirector said he recalled that Judge Medina in New York, when he

\ttiea the Communist Party leaders, the experience was so trying that it actually
broke his health. Peterson at this point injected a comment tliat his people are

trying to find out whether in the New Haven Bobby Seale case the Panthers are
going to try to kidnap the Department's representative whose name is Lynch or
whether they are referring to the Attorney General of the State of California whose
name is also Lynch and the Director said he felt it was the Department of Justice
representative being referred to.

The Director took this opportunity speaking about retaliatory action
to point out that he was very concerned over the kidnapping of diplomatic officials
in South America and said he felt it would be repeated in this country. He hoped
the guard force for the embassies and chanceries in the Nation's Capital would be
promptly secured as the President is also very concerned about this.

In further reply to Mr. Walters question, the Director also pointed
out that he felt many of these college presidents needed to be more firm and take
drastic action by expelling these students from the school, not giving them amnesty,
and assisting the local prosecutors in prosecuting these people. phe Solicitor
General indicated that he also felt many of the faculty were also/€ontributing
factor to this problem. The Director agreed. The Director pointed out that these
student problems in the college or high school can be traced back to the parental
responsibility. The Director said that District of Columbia policemen have told
him that many young children are out on the street at all hours of the night and
their parents don't even know, and in some instances, care where they are. The
Director told them of the incident of where-four of our Identification people were
held up and a female employee raped and how the juvenile giant when arrested had
a juvenile court record of four appearances without a single sentence and how the
Director had requested the court to try him as an adult but they refused to do so.
The Director referred to the fact that we have too many bleeding heart judges

and told of the success Judge Loble has had in Montana in handling juvenile subjects.

Memo J. J. Casper to Mr. M_hr 4/8/70
Re: Attorney General's Staff Conference - 4/8/70 - 5 PM

George J. Reed, Chairman, Board of Parole, questioned Mr. Hoover
as to the extent of Communist influence in all of this New Left, Black Panther,
Students for a Democratic Society, and militant action that we are faced with.
The Director explained that the Communist Party will join anything that will
further its causes and that they get their orders directly from Moscow. He
said their influence in some organizations is complete control and in others
it is only one of participation but, te pointed out, they are always the most
vocal and, consequently, are very influential in those groups that they participate
in. He said the Black Panthers follow the philosophies of many international
revolutionary Communists. The Director then cited the incident of the young
girl who blew up her father's home in New York which she had turned into a
bomb factory. He stated she started to get out of control when at Bryn Mawr
she joined the Students for a Democratic Society, and now she has fled to
Canada and we are unable to extradite her.

At this point Deputy Attorney General Kleindienst thanked Mr. Hoover
for his outstanding presentation. He said he felt they all had a better knowledge
‘of the FBI and a greater appreciation of the many problems from a security and
crime standpoint facing our country. With that, the official part of the conference
was adjourned. Many of the conferees came up and personally congratulated Mr.
Hoover and thanked him for his presentation, including asking Mr. Hoover to
autograph the FBI exhibit folder which had been passed out to each participant.

I feel this outstanding presentation on the part of the Director brought
great credit and praise for our organization. Hopefully, it will act-as an incentive
to some of our counterparts in the Department to do a more aggressive job
in fulfilling théir duties in meeting their security and criminal responsibilities.

Submitted for information.

ATTORNEY GENERAL'S TESTIMONY
HOUSE JUDICIARY SUBCOMMITTEE
MARCH 15, 1967

The "Washington Post" reported on March 16, 1967, that
Attorney General Clark opened hearings before a House Judiciary sub-
committee on March 15th relative to the Administration's request for
50 million dollars next year and 300 million dollars the following year
to assist state and local governments in modernizing their law enforce-
ment and corrective systems, Clark said that a successful war on
crime depends not on making it easier for police to seek confessions
put on improving their training and methods.

The Attorney General also said he had seen no evidence
that court decisions limiting admission of confessions had hampered
efficient law enforcement. Clark is reported to have opposed action
reversing court orders that suspects be told of their rights and be
offered counsel before being questioned.

Attorney General Clark said that since 1948 the FBI has
followed generally the same interrogation procedures which the courts
have now ordered the states to follow. The FBI has maintained a very
high average of convictions, showing ."what excellence in training and
standards can do," Clark said.

Clark also said he hoped Congress would not go "too far
on too little" until more evidence is in on bind effect of the Supreme
Court's decisions.

COMMENT

The Attorney General failed to consider the fact that FBI
investigations are not normally hot pursuit, on-the-street situations.
When the FBI interrogates a suspect or subject, usually considerable
investigation has already been conducted and corroborative facts have
been developed which greatly assist the course of the interrogation,
On the contrary, police are frequently faced with fast-moving,
developing situations on the street where there is no opportunity for
the orderly accumulation of facts to supplement interrogation,

Congress is currently investigating the effect of the
Miranda decision on law enforcement and public safety. Senator
Birch Bayh (Democrat - Indiana) has been holding hearings around
the country regarding Miranda; however, testimony he has received
has been conflicting. Generally law enforcement officials testify
that they have been handcuffed and defense lawyers and civil liber-
tarians take the opposite view. As of this time, neither side has
demonstrable statistical proof to substantiate its contentions. The
absence of clear proof is due, at least partially, to the fact that
Miranda is a new decision, being handed down on June 13, 1966,
As of now there are few reported court decisions showing how trial
courts will interpret the requirements laid down in Miranda.

PRESS RELEASE OF MARCH 15, 1967
ISSUED BY REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMEN'S "WEDNESDAY CLUB"
ENTITLED "ARE WE ORGANIZED TO FIGHT CRIME?"

On March 15, 1967, a group of 21 generally liberal
Republican Congressmen, members of the ''Wednesday Club, '' issued
a press release challenging the adequacy of the Federal Government's
organization to fight crime effectively and called for expansion of the
House Judiciary Committee's hearings considering crime legislation
to examine this aspect of the war on crime. The gist of their argument
is that a reorganization of Federal law enforcement and investigative
agencies is needed to effectively carry on the war against crime. The
press release suggests that there is "confusion, competition and dupli-
cation" among Federal law enforcement and investigative agencies which
is hindering the war against crime and that this can be eliminated only
through a complete reorganization of these agencies.

The entire argument of the "Wednesday Club" is based on
afalse premise. Traditionally and historically, law enforcement in this
country has been the responsibility of local governments and states.

The Federal law enforcement agencies make only approximately 50, 000
arrests per year for Federal violations, while local and state police
make over six million arrests for criminal acts, not including traffic
offenses. Federal investigative agencies have very little jurisdictional
control over the more than three million serious crimes committed in
the United States in 1966. Reorganization of the Federal law
enforcement agencies is not the answer to the crime problem. The
real problem is at the local level where there are 40, 000 investigative
agencies, ranging from city constables to state police, and the problem
of multiplicity of jurisdiction is within the state. From the standpoint

_ of the FBI, there is daily liaison and exchange of information with all
Federal, state and local law enforcement agencies; our important
cooperative services are made available to all laW enforcement agencies,
both on the state and Federal lével; and the FBI's National Crime Infor-
mation Center is an example of the cooperation which exists among law
enforcement agencies on all levels.

The press release of the "Wednesday Club" states that
the FBI maintains an informal semi-autonomy from Administration

¢

NW 65360 Docld:32989646 Page 762 .



regulations, although organizationally responsible to the Department

of Justice, and cites as an example recent debates over wiretapping
procedures. This statement is without any basis in fact. The Director's
testimony before various legislative committees, as well as documenta-
tion produced by him in the recent "wiretapping" controversy, clearly .
shows that the FBI's use of wiretaps was done with the specific knowledge
and approval of the Attorneys General and under strictly controlled
conditions. There is no exercise of autonomy whatsoever. by the FBI

in this field. a
The press release also charges that the FBI's involvement
in the foreign intelligence field, such as the Dominican crisis in 1965,
could detract from its domestic law enforcement and crime detection
functions. This allegation also is factually unsupportable. FBI Agents
were sent to the Dominican Republic in 1965 at the specific order of the
President; only three Special Agents are presently there, functioning
solely in a liaison capacity; statistical accomplishments by the FBI during
this period have been at their highest levels.

: The action of the 'Wednesday Club" was an obvious
attempt to secure a headline, which they incorrectly feel they have
found in the question of Federal organization.

MARCH 12," 1967

TELEVISION INTERVIEW
OF ATTORNEY GENERAL

Attorney General Ramsey Clark was the guest of CBS program
"Face the Nation" which was telecast in Washington over WTOP-TV,, at
12:30 p.m., Eastern Standard Time, Sunday, March 12, 1967. This program
was moderated by CBS newscaster Martin Agronsky assisted by correspondents
George Herman of CBS and James Clayton of the ''Washington Post."

The principal topics discussed during this interview of the
Attorney General were: 1. The New Orleans investigation into the
assassination of former President Kennedy; 2. Wiretapping; 3. The
Supreme Court "Miranda" decision; 4. Congressman Adam Clayton Powell;
and 5. The death penalty.

Several references were made to the Director and the FBI
during this interview and all were favorable.

NEW ORLEANS INVESTIGATION

The Attorney General expressed his confidence in the
Warren Commission conclusion, based on FBI investigation, ‘that assassin
Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone in killing former President Kennedy. He
commented that most--if not all--of the individuals mentioned in the New
Orleans investigation were known to the FBI, which developed no evidence
that they were involved in the assassination. Clark declined to comment
on the mysterious individual known as "Bertrand" since New Orleans
authorities were then holding court proceedings to determine his identity.

WIRETAPPING

- Clark commented that there were 38 wiretaps presently
authorized by his department, and that all of these were in national
security-type cases. He emphasized that procedures for his authority
in the use of all such devices have been improved, and he was satisfied
that none would G8 be used without his approval.

"MIRANDA" DECISION
[oa e nee

The Attorney General remarked that it was still too early
to determine what effect this decision would have on law enforcement
performance. He noted, however, that it has had no appreciable effect
on FBI investigations which have for many years informed suspects of
their constitutional rights prior to interrogation.

MARCH 12, 1967
TELEVISION INTERVIEW
OF ATTORNEY GENERAL

POWELL

No decision has been reached by the Department concerning
possible Federal violations committed by Powell, according to Clark.
However, he expressed the hope that their determination might await any
further action against Powell by Congress.

DEATH PENALTY

The Attorney General stated he would recommend the
death penalty be abolished for certain Federal violations.

UNIFORM CRIME REPORTS
1966 PRELIMINARY ANNUAL RELEASE

On Wednesday, p.m., March 15, 1967, the FBI's
preliminary crime reports for 1966 were released to the press.

This report highlighted the fact that crimes of violence
were up 11%, There Was a 9% increase in murder, a 10% increase
in aggravated assault, a 10% increase in forcible rape, and a 14%
increase in robbery, Asa group, crimes against property increased
11% during 1966,

The sharpest crime increase was noted in the group of
cities having less than 10, 000 inhabitants, Crime in these cities *
rose 14%. Large cities with over 100, 000 inhabitants had an average
increase of 10%, while crime in rural areas was up 7% and crime in
the suburbs rose 13%.

In the release dated March 15th the Director reiterated
the need for adequate firearms legislation, noting that.there was a
23% increase in 1966 in serious assaults where guns were used, The
Director also highlighted the fact that six out of every ten murders
were committed with the use of a firearm, 71% of these murders
were committed with handguns, 17% with shotguns and 12% with rifles
or other type firearm. :

This crime report release also indicated that in 1966
police arrests of adults for all’criminal acts (excluding traffic
offenses) dropped 1%; however, arrests of persons under 18 years of
age increased 9%, .

7 Our preliminary annual release also noted that nationally,
police solutions of crime index offenses averaged 25% and noted that
police solved 89% of murders, 72% of aggravated assaults, 65% of
forcible rapes, 35% of robberies and 21% of property offenses.

CRIME LEGISLATION

The Congress is presently holding hearings with
respect to the President's request for crime legislation entitled
"Safe Streets and Crime Control Act of 1967,"" .This Act has its
basis in many of the recommendations of the President's Com-
mission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice.
The report of the Commission entitled "The Challenge of Crime
in a Free Society" was released February 18, 1967. The pro-
posed legislation would provide for a substantial financial aid
program to local and state law enforcement agencies for the
purpose of purchase of equipment, training, education and
research, It would also establish in the Department of Justice
an agency to administer the program headed by a Director of
Law Enforcement and Criminal Justicé Assistance. Depending
on how this new legislation would be administered within the
Department of Justice, it will have an impact and could conflict
with the FBI's long-standing cooperative services for local law
enforcement.

NATIONAL CONFERENCE ON LAW ENFORCEMENT
AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE

By letter dated March 10, 1967, the Attorney

General requested FBI participation in a national conference

of local and state law enforcement administrators to be held

in the State Department Auditorium on March 28-29, 1967.
This conference was called by the President and has as its _
purpose a discussion on how to implement the proposed

crime legislation. Since this conference and any new crime
legislation would affect directly the long-standing FBI coopera-
-tive services to local law enforcement, Assistant to the Director
DeLoach, Assistant Director Casper and Inspector Jerome J.
Daunt have been designated to attend. The Attorney General is
being advised by letter dated March 17, 1967.

NATIONAL CRIME INFORMATION CENTER (NCIC)

The National Crime Information Center (NCIC), a
computerized index of law enforcement information on crime and
criminals, successfully began its pilot test operation on January 27,
1967. At the present time the following police agencies are directly
on-line to the FBI computer:

Boston Police Department

Philadelphia Police Department

New York City Police Department

Washington, D. C., Metropolitan Police Department

Chicago Police Department

St. Louis Police Department’

New Orleans Police Department

Maryland State Police

Virginia State Police

Georgia State Patrol

Texas Department of Public Safety, and
Vi Denver FBI Field Office
These agencies are entering records on wanted
persons, stolen motor vehicles, and identifiable stolen property.
They are receiving replies to inquiries in a matter of seconds.
For example, a police officer on the street in New Orleans through
the use of his car radio is able to get information from the FBI
computer here in Washington within 11/2 minutes. The California
Department of Justice and the New York State Police are scheduled
to join the NCIC system on March 20, 1967. The system has hada
steady growth in building up the information that is stored in the
computer, increasing the number of hours that the computer is
"ton the air'' and in adding new participating police agencies.

INVESTIGATION OF THE ASSASSINATION OF .PRESIDENT JOHN F, KENNEDY
BY NEW ORLEANS DISTRICT ATTORNEY JAMES C, GARRISON

In December, 1966, we received information that New Orleans
District Attorney James C, Garrison was conducting an investigation
of the assassination of the late President Kennedy, .Garrison reported
ly was attempting to develop evidence showing that David William
Ferrie, a homosexual who was a former airlines pilot, and Lee Harvey
Oswald conspired with anti-Castro Cubans to assasSinate President
Kennedy. 7 7

We were informed by several sources that Garrison Was basing
| much of his investigation upon information furnished to him by Jack Be
Martin and David Lewis, Martin is a private investigator in
New Orleans and Lewis is a baggage handler at a New Orleans bus
| station. Both Martin and Lewis appear to be mental cases. During

. our investigation of the assassination, we thoroughly investigated
allegations that Ferrie and Oswald were acquainted but we found
no evidence to show this was true,

Garrison has made one arrest in his case - Clay L. Shaw,
a homosexual who was former Director of the International Trade Mart
in New Orleans. Shaw's name did not come up during our investigation
of the assassination. Garrison claims Shaw is identical with one
Clay Bertrand, an alleged contact of New Orleans attorney Dean Andrews,
We never located Bertrand and Andrews’ acquaintance with Bertrand
highly doubted, We developed no information indicating Oswald knew
Clay Shaw.

On March 14, 1967, during a preliminary hearing in New Or-
leans for Shaw, Garrison produced a mystery witness Perry Raymond
Russo who alleged that he was present at a meeting when Leon Oswald,
David Ferrie and Clay Shaw planned the assassination of President
Kennedy, Russo identified Leon Oswald as identical to Lee Harvey
Oswald, Russo admitted receiving psychiatric treatment since 1959

‘and his testimony at the preliminary hearing was highly contradictory
to information he previously-furnished to news media, Russo appears
to be lying and during our investigation ofthe assassination, we
developed no information indicating Oswald ever knew Russo.

James C, Garrison is an egomaniac, is politically ambitious
and it appears his whole investigation was triggered by his desire
for publicity, The Director has instructed that we have no contact
with Garrison or any member of his staff and that we stay meticulously
out of Garrison's investigation, It appears Garrison is looking for
an attempt to dump his investigation on this Bureau and the Director
has instructed that we should avoid such possibility "Like a plague."

SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITIES ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES

The field of education has long been a major
target of the Communist Party. The communists' emphasis
on students in the recent past was best expressed by
the Party's General Secretary, Gus Hall, when he stated
"Communism is big, really big, on college campuses now.
You've got to play the ball game where the players are and
the really good players are in college."' Today there is
considerable unrest and agitation on college campuses
throughout the Nation. Subversive agitators constitute the
major source behind this unrest and, from a long-range
viewpoint, these campus subversives may well become seriously
damaging to our national security. In light of this, the .
FBI will continue to carry out its defined responsibilities,
whether they be on the college campus or elsewhere, while
at the same time respect the spirit of academic freedom on
which our college system is based.

The two major student and campus groups in the
United States today are the communist-~inspired W. E. B.
DuBois Clubs of America, with an approximate membership of
425 members, and the Students for a Democratic Society, with
approximately 5,000 members. The Students for a Democratic
Society has been described by Gus Hall as a new left group
which the Party has "going for us."

Today there is a concerted effort on the part of

-Student groups to "knock" the FBI and other Government
agencies off the college campuses and’ to prevent such
agencies from carrying out their assigned duties. For
example, in early March, 1967, a handful of Students for
a Democratic Society members at Duke University, Durham,
North Carolina, alleged that the FBI in conducting investi-
gations on that campus was infringing on academic freedom
by securing information from responsible campus officials
and students. While we have interviewed officials and students
at the University in matters within our jurisdiction the
charges that the FBI was infringing on academic freedom are
baseless?

* Another example involves allegations made by a
group of "liberal" faculty members at State University College,
Brockport, New York. This group alleged that the FBI was
having faculty members "spy" on other faculty members, again
raising the cry of infringement of academic freedom. These
charges also were baseless and without foundation,

TRAVEL OF THE PRESIDENT TO URUGUAY

At the request of the White House, a representative
of this Bureaurecently traveled to Uruguay and participated
in briefings, surveys, and discussions relating to security to
be provided for the President when he attends the Summit
Conference of heads of American States to be held in Punta
Del Este, Uruguay, during the period 4/12-14/67. The same
Bureau representative is returning to Uruguay to assist a
White House group in the implementation of security measures
prior to the President's arrival. A general assessment of
the situation in Uruguay at the present time indicates that
adequate security can be provided to the President if he
restricts his travel to Punta Del Este. If he travels to
Montevideo proper, security problems could arise because of
a very militant Communist Party which already is manifesting
its protests to the President's visit. The Communist Party
in Uruguay practically controls the labor movement and
potentially is in a position to paralyze facilities such as
light, gas, water, and street transportation, Furthermore,
there is a good potential for committing sabotage and inciting
riots, Under the present plan, the President will not go
into Montevideo proper. Security problems at Punta-Del Este
are greatly minimized because the geographic location and
the resort-type atmosphere do not present any serious
obstacles for instituting good security. The police and
security services in Montevideo are not efficient by our
standards, and it will take continuing prodding to make
certain that the necessary security measures are carried
out. The political stability of the Uruguayan Government is
not good. There is a new Government which is shaky and is
suffering economic problems. There have been a series of
strikes during the last several weeks. We have been told
that there will be between 1500 and 2500 newspapermen who
will attend the conference, There may be some commotion
among -them because of inadequate housing and communication
facilities. Newspaper reporters may alsorfind it disappointing
to find any news of real significance at Punta Del Este if
there are no disturbing incidents.

WIRE TAPS AND OTHER COVERAGE UTILIZED IN THE

INTERNAL SECURITY FIELD

he ss

Wire taps are utilized only in the internal security
field and when absolutely essential to carrying out our
investigative responsibilities. Their number varies and as
of this date we have 42 wire taps in operation. In addition,

The importance of utilizing wire taps in the internal
security -field.cannot be overemphasized in view of the dangers
that exist in the internal security of the United States. The
intelligence data obtained from such coverage makes it possible
to keep appropriate officials of our Government currently
aware of the activities, plans, strategy, and tactics of
subversive organizations and individuals. Aiso, iniormation
gathered from these sources is of immediate interest to the
United States intelligence agencies and officials of the Govern-
ment in the formulation of plans in the foreign policy field.

We are not utilizing any microphone surveillances,
mail covers, or trash covers in connection with our investiga-
tions. We are utilizing security informants and confidential
sources to provide us necessary coverage. Currently, we have
Qs security informants who are members of the Communist Party
and some of these are operating at the highest level. In view
of the valuable coverage these informants provide us, we place #
great deal of emphasis on their utilization. It may be
interesting to note that during os Of our security infor-
mants became members of the Comminist Party and this was
increased to informants becoming members of the Party in S.
In this connection, we noted that during those two years while

informants became members of the Party, @ discontinued
their association with the Party primarily due to personal
reasons, thus leaving us a total gain of 2% informants in the
Party.

COMMUNIST PARTY, USA

The Communist Party, USA, is operating in an

atmosphere of optimism as a resuit of the March 3, 1967,

decision of the United States Court of Appeals, Washington, D.C.,
- which stated that the Party could not be forced to register

under the provisions of the Internal Security Act of 1950,

The feeling throughout the Party is that it has won its fight

for existence and now must move to capitalize on this victory

by becoming an effective force on the American scene.

Within this week the Party adopted various programs
in an effort to move out of its isolation from the American
people. It is working toward the establishment of a daily
newspaper which is expected to be in operation in time to
have an effect on the national elections in 1968, Originally,
the Party planned to merge peace, labor, and civil rights
groups into a new political party which would nominate a
candidate for President of the United States in 1968. Now,
the Communist Party is seriously considering running its own
candidates for the offices of President and Vice President of
the United States in 1968.

May 1, 1967, is to mark the institution of a
massive recruiting drive by the Party to take advantage of
the favorable Court decision and each Party district is being
instructed to start making plans for this recruiting drive
how. In addition, Party leaders have called for moré infil~
tration by Party members into the trade union movement in
an attempt to regain the power the Party had in this movement
in the 1940's,

The Party believes that youth must be the central
concentration for its work in the future, In order to have
the most impact on the young generation and to gain recruits
quickly, the Party must make an effective appeal to youth,
Therefore, it is instituting a massive campaign against
United States policy in Vietnam, instituting resistance to
the military draft, and encouraging all types of demonstrations
by youth. The Party also will start a movement to have Congress
pass a bill guaranteeing full employment for ali youth,

The Party considers recruiting of youth its most
important project in 1967, Current plans cali for doubling
the number of youth in the Party during the Summer of 1967,
and the nationwide establishment of Party schools to fully
indoctrinate these youth recruits in the principles of
Marxism.

DEMONSTRATIONS PROTESTING UNITED STATES
INTERVENTION IN VIETNAM

Since United States aircraft attacked selected
targets in North Vietnam follo; jne torpedo-boat assaults
against destroyers in the Gulz? ‘onkin in early August,
1964, there have been in the United States almost daily
demonstrations to protest United States intervention in
Vietnam. Many of these demonstrations have reached major
proportions, .

The Communist Party and other subversive groups
such as the W.E.B, DuBois Clubs of America, a communist-
inspired Marxist-oriented youth group; the Socialist Workers
Party, which has been designated as subversive by the Attorney
General, and its. youth affiliate, the Young Socialist Alliance;
the Workers World Party, a communist splinter group and its
youth affiliate, Youth Against War and Fascism; and the
Progressive Labor Party, a pro-~ChinesSe Marxist group,have
actively supported and participated in demonstrations along
with the Students for a Democratic Society, a militant youth
group which has been described by Gus Hall, General Secretary
of the Communist Party, USA, as a group which the Party has
“going for us. Pacifist groups such as Women Strike for
Peace, Women's International League for Peace and Freedom,
the Committee for Nonviolent Action, and the National Committee
for a Sane Nuclear Policy have also taken a leading role in
sponsoring such demonstrations. Summaries showing the
highlights of these demonstrations are furnished to the
White House and other Government officials two or three times
a week,

The Spring Mobilization Committee and the Student
Mobilization Committee, both of which include members of the
Communist Party and other subversive groups in their
membership, are sponsoring demonstrations throughout the
United States April 8-15, 1967. The focal point of the
week-long activity will be massive demonstrations at
New York City and San Francisco, California, on April 15.

The Reverend James Bevel is the National Director of the

Spring Mobilization Committee, Bevel is an official of the
Southern Ghristian Leadership Conference, a civil rights

The Student Mobilization Committee is the brainchild of

Bettina Aptheker, a student at the University of California

DOMINICAN SITUATION

The FBI was ordered into the Dominican Republic by
the President in May, 1965, to develop information to be
used in preventing communists from gaining control in that
country. At the height of the Dominican Revolution, we had
a staff of 14 Agents. In August, 1966, at White House
instructions, we established a permanent Legal Attache office
there staffed with three Agents.

Since his inauguration July 1, 1966, Dominican
President Joaquin Balaguer has brought about a degree of
stability, however, there continues to be strong undercurrents
of dissension. . The rightists reportedly have considered
plots to remove Balaguer. Juan Bosch's political party, the
loser in the June, 1966, election, has been most vocal in
its opposition to Balaguer's programs and only recently
published a document which appears intended to set the
stage for a vast movement of resistance against Balaguer.
The communist groups have suffered much internal dissension
but to establish a common cause could be expected to regroup
as they have in the past. They possibly would be willing
to let Bosch's political party provide the overt leadership.

BOMBING OF YUGOSLAV :

DIPLOMATIC ESTABLISHMENTS
_IN THE UNITED STATES

AND CANADA

JANUARY 29, 1967

Our investigation has developed a great deal of substantial
information implicating the following individuals in a conspiracy
to bomb Yugoslav diplomatic establishments in the United States and
Canada on 1/29/67:

Reverend Radomir Chkautovic Lebanon, Pennsylvania
Reverend Stojilko Kajevic Youngstown, Ohio
Zivko Kajevic Youngstown, Ohio.
Djordje Djelic Cleveland, Ohio

Milan Nikolic Cleveland, Ohio
Desimir Marjanovic Cleveland, Ohio
Miomir Radovanovic Chicago, Illinois
Dragisa Kasikovic Chicago, Illinois -
Borislav Kornic Los Angeles, California
Kosta Stanojevic Toronto

Branco Stanojevic : Toronto

Branislav Petrov : Toronto

Becir Rakocevic ’ Toronto

We have evidence of rheetings by the conspirators at
Chicago, Illinois, 6/26-28/66; Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania, 8/27-28/66;
Libertyville, Illinois, 9/30 - 10/2/66; and Perrysburg, Ohio, 1/24-25/67.

‘  Borislav Kornic has admitted to two different individuals

that Kornic, Milan Nikolic, and Desimir MarjanoVic bombed the

San Francisco Consulate with explosives Marjanovic transported to

Los Angeles from Cleveland, Ohio. One of the persons to whom Kornic
made these admissions has testified at the grand jury; the other is not
willing to testify at this time.

: Other evidence includes proof that Stojilko Kajevic's
automobile was used prior to the bombings in an attempt to buy dynamite
and a pattern of long distance telephone calls between the suspects at
pertinent times.

NW 65360 Docld:32989646 Page 781



; Presentation to a Federal Grand Jury, Washington, D. C.,
commenced 3/10/67 but the grand jury is available to hear this case
only on Fridays. Additional witnesses are appearing 3/17/67 and it
is anticipated further testimony will be given the grand jury 3/24/67 _
and possibly 3/31/67.

Brandon Alvey, the trial attorney handling this case, has
described the Bureau's investigation as outstanding and said he has
never before seen so mich good information gathered in such a short
time. Alvey states that if there was a statute making it a violation to
bomb diplomatic establishments in the United States, the evidence now
available would support a conspiracy conviction, There is no such
statute; however, the statute the Department considers.most applicable
(Section 956, Title-18) makes it a violation to conspire in the United States
to damage property owned by a foreign government in a foreign country.

To successfully prosecute under Section 956, it must be
proven that the conspiracy originated in the United States. No violation
would exist if the conspiracy originated in Canada even if subsequent
discussions and other overt acts occurred in the United States. It is
unlikely that this point can be established unless a confession-is obtained
from one of the conspirators. Alvey is making every effort to develop
the necessary evidence on this point in examining witnesses before the
grand jury and has laid the groundwork for possibly forcing testimony
from one or more prime suspects by offering immunity coupled with
a threat of contempt proceedings if testimony is withheld.

Trial attorney Alvey has indicated the grand jury is
enthusiastic but he does not expect to obtain a true bill unless additional
evidence is developed to prove the conspiracy to bomb the Canadian
establishments originated in the United States. We are vigorously

+ pursuing all logical possibilities to develop such information by
continuing investigation. y

Hoffa and three others are presently serving
prison terms as a result of their conviction in Chattanooga
Federal Court 3/4/64, on charges of obstruction of justice.
The only legal isstes presently pending are two motions in
the Circuit Court of Appeals, Cincinnati, on which

filed in U. S, District Court, Chattanooga, 2/28/67 alleging
the Government's use of wire tapping and electronic
eavesdropping against Hoffa, his attorneys, and others,
These charges, so far as the Bureau and its personnel are
concerned, are completely false and the Government filed
its response to this motion on 3/10/67. The Chattanooga
court is expected to rule on this motion in the near —
future, Although Hoffa is now in prison, his. attorneys
have continued unsuccessfully to shop around the U 8S.

ROBERT EARL BARNES
INTERSTATE TRANSPORTALON OF STOLEN PROPERTY

Robert Earl Barnes is the notorious burglar with
an extensive arrest.record who was the main witness at the
trial in District Court of 5 policemen charged with bribery
and conspiracy. Trial, which ended March 11, 1967, resulted
in the conviction of 3 District of Columbia police officers
and the acquittal of the other 2,

: Barnes has admitted to our Agents the theft on
June 12, 1964, of a 34.10 carat diamond ring (appraised at
$120,000) from Mrs, John R. McLean, a guest at the
Lucayan Beach Hotel, Grand Bahamas Island, The diamond ring
was transported by Barnes and an associate to New York City
where it was sold, Some of the evidence has been presented
to a Special Federal Grand Jury, however, prosecution of
Barnes for the Interstate Transportation of Stolen Property
violation was held in abeyance pending completion of the trial
of the police officers,

On March 13, 1967, Assistant U. S, Attorney Harold T,
Sullivan who is handling this matter, advised that it was the
specific instruction of U. 8S. Attorney David Bress that prosecution
of Barnes in connection with the McLean diamond should be
pursued and pertinent witnesses are to be called before the
Grand Jury.

This is being followed most closely.

BOMBING DEATH OF Mo Ale } 7, 144?

AT NATCHEZ, MISSISSIPPI
ON FEBRUARY 27, 1967
CIVIL RIGHTS

BOMBING MATTERS

A full investigation is being conducted at the Depart-
ment's request concerning the death of Wharlesi Jackson at Natchez,
Mississippi, as a result of a bomb exploding in his pickup truck as
he left work at the Armstrong Tire and Rubber iitenceead in Natchez
shortly after 8 p.m. on February 27, 1967. .

Jackson had been employed by the Armstrong Company
since June, 1955. On February 20, 1967, he began training for a new
job as a cement mixer, a type of position previously held only by white
men. His particular job was a new position and was based on seniority.
Jackson had held the position of treasurer in the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People in the Natchez branch and is
survived by his wife and five children. George Metcalf, a Negro fellow
employee, also active in the National Assocation for the Advancement
of Colored People, who previously customarily rode to work with
Jackson, was seriously injured in a similar type explosion in 1965,

On the scene examination by Laboratory experts

indicates that a high-order explosive was detonated under the cab portion
of Jackson's truck directly beneath the driver, Fragments of wire
recovered at the scene appear tO be wire from an electric blasting
cap, indicating that such a cap may have been connected to and
activated by the electric wiring system of the truck. Portionsof the

. Wires to the brake light, tail light, and left rear turn indicator light,
which Were originally located on the inside of the jeft frame, are
missing as a result of the explosion. No additional physical evidence
has been disclosed to date.

Extensive investigation conducted under the on-the-scene
supervision of Inspector Joseph A, Sullivan indicates that a group known
as the Silver Dollar group is responsible for the bombing. The Silver
Dollar group is reportedly a secret group of Mississippi and Louisiana
Klansmen founded in June, 1965. One informant is presently a member

* of the group but to date has been unable to establish the identity of

24

NW 65360 Docld:32989646 Page 785



persons responsible for the bombing. Intensive efforts are being
made to develop additional sources to furnish further penetration of
the group and to trace the electric blasting cap probably used to
detonate the explosive.

CLIFFORD A. JONES
PERJURY

Clifford A. Jones, former Lieutenant Governor of
Nevada who is closely allied with Nevada gambling interests,
was indicted January 5, 1966, on three counts of perjury
as a result of his having testified falsely before the
Bobby Baker grand jury. This testimony concerned payments
Jones arranged through one of his companies of $10,000 to
Baker through Wayne Bromley, a close associate of Baker.
U. S. District Court Judge Gasch presently has taken under
advisement pretrial motions of Jones for continuance of
trial and change of venue.

On March 25, 1965, in response to request of
Criminal Division, Bureau monitored telephone calls from
Bromley to Jones and Baker. Bromley and his attorney had
asked that this be done. Department held such monitoring
would be legal. On March 26, 1965, Department requested
we monitor meeting to be attended by Jones, Bromley, and
Baker at a hotel in Los Angeles. Purpose of meeting was
to get Bromley, a Government witness, to tailor his.
testimony to agree with testimony Jones had given, “Bureau
declined to monitor this meeting because of lack of security
of the premises involved which presented a risk of disclosure
of the coverage. Department then got Bureau of Narcotics
to assist in monitoring of the meeting.

Recently we have responded to Department's request
regarding Bureau electronic coverage of Jones. Such coverage
involved twenty conversations over four Las Vegas and one
Miami:electronic device. All conversations were inconsequential
and have no bearing on perjury charges against Jones. This
coverage will be subject matter of future pretrial proceedings.

At approximately 2 a.m, on January 10, 1966, the
residence and business of Vernon Ferdinand Dahmer, Sr., a
58-year-old Negro and past President of the National Associa-
tion for the Advancement of Colored People, Forrest County,
Mississippi, was shot into and completely gutted by fire.
Dahmer died’ the afternoon of -the same date in a Hattiesburg,
Mississippi, hospital.

Extensive around-the-clock investigation conducted
by the FBI resulted in the indictment of 15 members of the
White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan on June 22, 1966. The
indictment charged these Klansmen with violation of the
Voting Rights Act of 1965 and Civil Rights Statutes, Those
indicted included Sam Holloway Bowers, Jr. imperial wizard
of the White Knights of the Ku Kiux Klan of Mississippi.

A motion was filed on behalf of 13 of the defendants
to dismiss this indictment based upon an objection to the
array of the jurors. Based upon this action the facts were
represented to a Federal Grand Jury at Jackson, Mississippi,
which resulted in the indictment of 12 members of the White
Knights of the Ku Klux Klan’ of Mississippi on February 27, 1967,
Lawrence Byrd, Sr., who was one of the original 15 indicted,
was named as a co-conspirator but not as a defendant by the
Federal Grand Jury on February 27, 1967.

This matter is presently pending prosecutive action.

MURDERS .OF THREE CIVIL RIGHTS WORKERS

" Civil Rights workers Michael Henry Schwerner and
Andrew Goodman, both white, together with James Earl Chaney,
Negro, were murdered near Philadelphia, Mississippi, on
dune 21-22, 1964.

. On October 2, 1964, a Federal Grand Jury indicted
18, persons for Civil Rights violations pertaining to these
murders. These indictments were dismissed October 7, 1966,
on legal grounds on the basis that certain groups, including
Negroes, were excluded from the grand jury panel. This case
was re-presented to the Federal Grand Jury at Jackson,
Mississippi, and on February 27, 1967, indictments were
returned against 19 persons. They are presently free on
bonde No trial date has been set.

Of the 19 peysons indicted, 17 are identical to those
previously indicted in this case. Jimmy Lee Townsend, who
was 17 years old at the time of the murders, was the one
who was previously indicted but not indicted at this time.
In addition to those previously indicted, this grand jury
indicted Ethel Glen "Hop" Barnett, former sheriff and present
candidate for sheriff of Neshoba County, Mississippi,
and Sam Holloway Bowers, Jr., Imperial Wizard, White Knights

REQUEST OF ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL
VINSON, MARCH 14, 1967, RE LAKE COUNTY,
INDIANA, CRIME CONDITIONS

Assistant Attorney General Fred M. Vinson, Jr.,
Criminal Division, requested preparation of an extensive summary
erime condition report concerning Lake County, Indiana, He asked
for information on gambling, racketeering, counterfeiting, narcotics,
shoplifting and other such matters, By letter to the Attorney General
on March 16, 1967, we pointed out we no longer make such reports
and our commitments preclude the preparation of such a study, This
is apparently a "fishing expedition" type request for Vinson's and
Petersen's Task Force. We advised them they have reports in
gambling and racketeering-type cases in Lake County, Indiana, where
recent prosecutive action has been taken against hoodlums.

The Department has embarked on a Crime Task Force
Program which solicits the active participation of the various Federal
investigative agencies. We informed the Department that there are
inherent drawbacks to such a program and are not actively partici-
pating in it, We have, however, advised the Department that if
matters within our jurisdiction arise during the Task Force Program,
we will handle such upon referral of these matters tous. We have
also agreed to conduct an indices and credit check of grand jury panel
in the Buffalo area, which is to be convened for the Task Force in
operation in that area,

Department attorney Peloquin advised a Canadian police
official that the FBI was participating in-a "buy back" of United States

on March 8, 1967, pointing out that Peloquin had misinformed the
Canadian authorities on our participation, v

WIRETAPPING

The Attorney General testified before the House Judiciary
Subcommittee on March 15, 1967, that microphone and wiretapping
were unnecessary in connection with control of crime in the United
States. Various bills to outlaw wiretapping and eavesdropping or to
legalize such practices are pending in the Congress, We directed a
letter to the Department dated March 6, 1967, concerning legislation
proposed by Senator Eastland which would authorize wiretapping and
use of microphones with court approval in organized crime investiga-
tions. We informed the Attorney General that such legislation would
be very beneficial to our efforts in the field of organized crime and
would appear to. provide a statutory basis for practices now being .
followed in connection with use of such devices in national security
matters. Microphones were of inestimable value in determining
La Cosa Nostra weaknesses and day-to-day organizational moves, *
and enabled us to develop excellent informants, disseminate informa-~
tion to local authorities and to make counter moves to dry up La Cosa
Nostra sources of income,

In connection with Departmental disclosures of our prior
microphone coverage in cases presently before the trial and appeals
courts, there has been to date no complete reversal of any of such
cases which were actually brought to trial. In several casés, notably, ©
Kolod-Alderisio in Denver, Colorado; Robert G, Baker in Washington,
D. C.; Frank Peter Balistrieri in Springfield, Illinois; Charles
Battaglia in Tucson, Arizona; and Gilbert Lee Beckley in Miami,
Florida, disclosures were made and hearings held, and in each
instance the court has ruled against the defendants and in favor of our
position that these cases were not tainted. In the Black case and in
the Schipani case in New York; the Supreme Court has remanded for
retrial and these are still under consideration, +

convictions than at a similar time last year. In addition, we have in
excess of 350 individuals arrested and/or indicted and awaiting trial
for violations of these-statutes, As a result of our dissemination
policies of gambling information to local authorities, we have directed
telling blows against La Cosa Nostra members active in this field by
virtue of numerous arrests made by local authorities,

During this fiscal year we have disseminated 159, 823
items of criminal information to local authorities, which is an increase
of 50, 000 noms over this same period last year,

concerning six items of possible irregularities (Conflict

_ of Interest) on the part of Senator Dodd, These investi-
gations were conducted at the specific request of the

made available by columnist Jack Anderson (Drew Pearson's
leg man). These matters have been under consideration

‘FBI NATIONAL ACADEMY
LAW ENFORCEMENT ASSISTANCE ACT OF 1965

The 79th Session of the FBI National Academy begins
Monday, March 20, 1967. There will be 100 law enforcement
officers in attendance with representatives from 45 states, the
District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and 7 foreign officers from
5 foreign countries (Australia, Canada, Colombia, Malaysia and
Thailand), (The Attorney General presented diplomas to the
graduating class of the 75th Session of the National. Academy on
May 26, 1965, when he was Deputy Attorney General. )

On January 25, 1967, the Director sent a memorandum
to then Acting Attorney General Clark requesting that National
Academy representatives be included under the Law Enforcement
Assistance Act of 1965 as soon as possible for financial assistance
in helping to defray living expenses while attending the FBI
National Academy. We referred Mr. Clark to previous correspondence
on this same matter and a reply dated August 24, 1966, that
indicated that such support would be appropriate under the Law
Enforcement Assistance Act. The Director pointed out that while
we anticipate having a continuing demand and desire to attend this
Academy, we do not feel this factor should have a bearing on the
allocation of funds under the Law Enforcement Assistance Act,

It was assumed in the Attorney General's reply in August, 1966,
that in view of the current limited capacity of the Academy plus
the ample demand and desire of local agencies to send candidates
it would be unnecessary at this time to be concerned about sub-
sistence aid.

It was estimated that approximately $80, 000 for
subsistence and travel would be needed for the March class and
that it would vary somewhat for each class and that if the Acting
Attorney General approved this concept, the Director stated a
request for a grarit would be submitted on proper documents to
the Office of Law Enforcement Assistance.

NW 65360 Docld:32989646 Page 796



We have never received a reply to this memorandum
even though we pointed out that several grants under the Law
Enforcement Assistance Act have been awarded for the conduct

. of police seminars and have included funds for financial assistance

of the attendees. The Director may wish to point out to the
Attorney General that we are not asking for this money for the
FBI but that the funds would be helpful to the agency sending the
man to the National Academy. Although we have not conducted
a nation-wide survey, we are aware that many departments do
not submit applications to the National Academy because they
do not have the funds to pay the living expenses of their officers
while they would be in Washington.

POLICE TRAINING

Assistance in training matters continues to be one of the
most sought after cooperative functions of the FBI. During calendar year
1966, the FBI assisted municipal, county and state law enforcement agencies
in 5478 training endeavors, attended by 163,302 people. Over 1200 Special
Agents of the FBI are trained as police instructors, and during 1966, they
contributed 45,383 hours of instruction time, free of charge, at police
training schools. Assistance is rendered in all types of schools, however,
special emphasis is being placed on police administration and management,
search and seizure, probable cause for arrest, due process in criminal
interrogation, laboratory matters, crime scene search, collection and
preservation of evidence, human relations in police management, and
police-community relations. -

NEW FBI ACADEMY

In May, 1965, the Director submitted a proposal to the
Attorney General for tke building of a new FBI Academy on the
Marine Corps Base at Quantico, Virginia. This suggestion was
immediately endorsed by the President and the Attorney General.
The Director's proposal outlined that with the new facility, instead
of training 200 local law enforcement officers annually at the FBI
National Academy. we could train 1, 200 and up to 1, 000 local law
enforcement officers in specialized courses. The Congress has
appropriated funds for the construction of this new facility.

The planning and engineering work on the site is in
progress and it is anticipated that the contract for the construction
of the Academy will be let sometime during the summer of 1967. It
is believed that the new Academy will be ready for occupancy during
fiscal year 1969.

EXECUTIVE ASSIGNMENT SYSTEM

Executive Order 11315 established an Executive
Assignment System for filling positions in Grades 16, 17, and H
18 of the General Schedule. The FBI was specifically excluded. Fea
The Director by statute has the authority to fill the 110 Super- :
grade positions allotted to the FBI. An inventory of skills of ‘
employees throughout the Government in Grades GS-15 through :
18 is being established by the Civil Service Commission to fill
vacancies in other agencies and it proposes to include in this
inventory all such employees, including those in the FBI.. This
would make our executives available for consideration by other
agencies although we are still exempt from having to consider -
employees of other agencies in filling our vacancies. The
Department, therefore, was requested by letter dated December 21,

1966, to approve a letter to the Civil Service Commission request-
ing exclusion of FBI executives from the proposed inventory as
retention by the FBI of its executives is considered essential. We
have been following with the Department but the matter has not yet
been acted upon by the Attorney General.

RE: HOWARD LEWIS RUNDQUISL
WILLIAM J. SHERGALIS, EL AL.
REGISTRATION ACT ~ CUBA :

The case involves WU S. plane piloted by two Americans,
Rundquist and Shergalis, which was shot down arch 21, 1960, while
trying to smuggle four Cubans out of that country with resulting
arrest of Rundquist and Shergalis. F&I source in Miami advised
March 22, 1960, that incident was staged by Castro agents to provide
Castro with. basis for renewed attacks against U. S. for allowing
illegal flights to Cuba. On March 23, 7960, this hoax was exposed -
when Shergalis gave statement to UY S. Embassy admitting role as
Castro agent and implicating various Cubans in U. S. and Cuba. We
conducted intensive investigation in this matter and developed
substantial evidence showing that Rundquist-Shergalis flight was,
in fact, instigated by Castro agents. Miami reports of April 1, April 65
April 15, and tay 6, 1960, covering our investigation, have been 7
furnished to Department and other interested anencies.

Ny
On May 3, 1960, Federal Grand Jury at. Miami, which was
convened on April 6, 1960, returned indictments against Shergalis
Vhs Heator Gareia Sota (Mrhan Air Porae amployee at Miami who served
las intermediary between Shergalis and Cuban intelligence officials)
charging them with violations of Foreign Agents Registration Act of
7938, as amended. Indictments were also returned against Shergalis
and Rundquist chargimg violations of Federal Aviation Act, administered
by Federal Aviation Agency, for failure to file proper flight plans
Shergalis is still in custody of Cuban officials in that countrys

prior to indictments, Departmental Attorney Wil1iam

recommended that, in addition to indictments against

[energalis and Garcia, indictments also be sought against four

etner individuals involved in this matter; namely, Carlos Hernandez
Lopez: (Cuban national serving as assistant to Garcia as Cuban

Air Force purchasing agent in Miami), Armando Jose Asencio
(American citizen of Cuban extraction who admittedly met with
Shergalis on Garcia's behalf on several occasions prior to

arch 21 flight), Roberto Millares (Cuban national who was present
at several meetings between Snergalis and Cuban representatives),
and Roberto Fernandez Rodriguez (Cuban Army intelligence representative
who accompanied Shergalis to Cuba in February, 1960, and
introduced him to Cuban intelligence officials).

No information has been received by Bureau indicating
that State Department exerted any influence on Justice Department
to limit prosecutive action to Shergalis and Garcia. J¢ See
appears Department concluded that evidence was insufficient to
support prosecution oj Hernandez Lopez, Millares and Fernandez
Rodriguez, It appears there would be some substantial evidence
concerning Asencio's involvement, ineluding his own admissions;
however, Department may have decided not to seek indictment against
Asencto on basis he will be utilized as Government witness
at any future trial held in this case, Asencio has been

cooperative ana on one occasion agreed to tanhnical coi zrage
HI of a meeting he had with Garcia and Hernandez Lopez in nis car.

On April 28, 1960, Carlos Hernandez Lopez was found
in criminal contempt in U. S. District Court in Miami for :
failure to appear before Grand Jury on April 13, 1960, in response
to subpoena in connection with Grand Jury hearings in this matter.
On the same day he was fined #100. On May 3, 1960, Hernandez
Lopez again failed to appear at a Grand Jury session and a warrant
I was issued for his arrest, Hernandez Lopez is reported to be
in Cuba at this time. We have not interjected ou: 1elves in

DESTRUCTION OF AIRCRAFT OR
MOTOR VEHICLES - FALSE REPORTS
SUMMARY OF PROSECUTIONS

The following is a summary of the prosecutions
-under the talse report section of the Destruction of Aircraft
or Motor Vehicles Statute.

Attached hereto is a thumbnail sketch of each
of the cases which are pending prosecution at this time.

Since the U. S. Attorneys' conference early in

April, 1960, prosecution has been authorized in 16 of these
: cases. Arrests were made in 15 of these cases and in one
4 case, the subject Vincent Joseph Micel, Boston, Massachusetts,
was permitted to surrender following the return of a true
bill of indictment. The Micel violation actually occurred
on January 26, 1960, and he was arrested by local authorities.
The Assistant U. S. Attorney, Boston, Massachusetts, deferred
his prosecutive opinion pending the outcome of local charges.
When local prosecution was subsequently discontinued, the
case was presented to the Federal Grand Jury at Boston,
Massachusetts, on May 19, 1960.

There are also four cases pending in which
prosecution was authorized prior to April, 1960.

On May 19, 1960, Donald David Kitch, Portland,
Oregon, District Manager for Western Oil Company, who, on
May 12, 1960, made a false report while seeing his boss off
on a United Air Lines flight in Portland, Oregon, entered
a plea of guilty in U. S. District Court. Sentence was not
imposed pending the completion of a presentence investigation
and subject was released on his own recognizance. This
conviction brings the total number of coavictions to 17 since
the effective date of this statute, July 14, 1956. These
| convictions, with the exception of the Kitch conviction, in
which sentence is not yet imposed, have resulted in 6 years
actual sentences, 10 years probationary sentences and $2,750

in fines.
.

In summary, it is noted that convictions have been
obtained in 17 cases and prosecution is pending in 19 cases.

VOTER REGISTRATION CASES
UNDER CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF 1960

The Civil Rights Division has requested the
delivery of demand letters to registration officials and
subsequent inspections and copying of voter registration
records in eight counties and parishes in Alabama, Georgia,
South Carolina and Louisiana. The desired records were
made available in South Carolina and Georgia,

' In Louisiana a suit has been filed in Federal .
Court against the Attorney General, Mr. Joseph M. F. Ryan, Jr.,
and the Director of the FBI alleging Titles 3 and 6 of the
Civil Rights Act of 1960 are unconstitutional and requests

an injunction enjoining the Attorney General and the FBI

from proceeding under the Act. United States District

Judge Ben C. Dawkins, Shreveport, Louisiana, signed an order
on May 25, 1960, directing the Attorney General, Acting
Assistant Attorney General Ryan and the Director to show

cause at 9:30 a.m., June 20, 1960, why preliminary inter-
locutory injunction should not be granted. Judge Dawkins also
signed a temporary restraining order to be effective until
June 20, 1960.

In Alabama, in one instance, an injunction has been
issued by Judge James A. Hare of the Fourth Judicial Circuit’
which covers Wilcox County, Alabama. This requires clarification

ot the Act before granting permission to inspect and copy
voter registration recards, The Attorney General, Mr. Ryan,
plus the Special Agent in Charge of the Mobile Office and
“the Assistant Special Agent in Charge, are named in the
injunction. No reply has been received to the demand letter

UNKNOWN SUBJECT
RICHARD KENNETH KAUFMAN-VICTIM
EXTORTION, 5-26-60

Richard Kaufman, a student at Syracuse University,
New York and son of Federal Judge Irving Kaufman, who
presided during the trial of the Apalachin hoodlums, on
3-1-60, received an anonymous threatening phone call. The
unknown caller made reference to victim's father and threatened
"Just wait until we get hold of you." Kaufman received another
call of a similar nature on 4-4-60 and on 4-5-60 received the
first, of 4 threatening letters, all postmarked Syracuse,
New York. The last of these communications bore an April 12,
1960, date. ;

AUSA Kenneth Ray of the Northern District of New York,
has indicated letters coupled with previous phone calls
constituted a violation of the Federal Extortion Statute and
his opinion was concurred in by the Department on April 8, 1960.

Extensive investigation has been conducted by our
Albany Office in an effort to identify and locate the extortion-
ist. To date, no positive information has been obtained, and
no suspects have been developed. Of interest, however, is the
fact that the rumors pervails among fellow students, faculty
members, and‘advisors of the victim that he prepared the
communications in question. While no direct evidence cor-
roborating these rumors has been uncovered, writing paper and
envelopes similar to that used in one of the conmunications
found in the victim's room.

The Department has requested copies of all investiga-
tive reports. Judge Kaufman will be confidentially advised of the
| facts developed by our investigation, after which the reports will

be disseminated to the Department.

‘ADOLPH COORS, II - VICTIM
KIDNAPING; EXTORTION

Intensive investigation is being continued in this case
with two principal objectives—the location and apprehension of
Joseph Corbett, Jr., the prime suspect in this case who is carried
as one of our ten most wanted fugitives, and the development of
evidence to positively identify Corbett as Coors' abductor.

In our program acquainting the public with our interest
in Corbett, material has been prepared and transmitted to the field
which will be furnished to all newspapers in the United States. In
our specialized circularization of persons and businesses with whom
Corbett would most likely have contact, we have sent letters and
Wanted Flyers to all individuals engaged in the prescribing and
dispensing of eyeglasses, including contact lenses, as Corbett's
eyesight requires that he wear glasses at all times.

The special squad in the Denver Division is currently
engaged in investigation in the mountain area to the west and north-
west of Denver with the objective of obtaining some information as
to the site of a planned hide-out where the abductor would have taken
Coors and indications as to where Coors' body could have been left,

' CONFLICT OF INTEREST

This case relates to the association between

Ledes, a former legal adviser to Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) Commissioner James C. Sargent and Joseph
Abrams, a New York promoter of unsavory reputation. We
completed an extensive investigation which determined that
Ledes endeavored to assist Abrams with several SEC matters
while Ledes was still with that agency. Abrams made loans
to Ledes to finance properties which Ledes purchased.

The attorney for subject Abrams advised his client
not to talk to us. The attorney for Ledes, James M. Me Inerney,
refused to make Ledes available for interview unless he,
Mc Inerney, is present. We informed the.Depariment and suggested
that they consider calling Ledes before a Federal Grand Jury or
interviewing him themselves in Mc Inerney's presences

On May 13, 1960, Roger Connor, Executive Assistant to
Assistant Attorney General Wilkey, advised that Joseph Abrams
had been brought down from Danbury, Connecticut, Federal
Correctional Institution to Washington, D. C., for appearance
before a Federal Grand Jury here. The Grand Jury presentation
by three Department attorneys started that date and is currently
continuing. Leads growing out of the Grand Jury hearings are
being received and are currently outstanding in Washington Field
Office, New York, Atlanta and Miami. These matters are being
given immediate and continuous attentions

Since February 2, 1960, when the Attorney General
advised the agreement had been reached between the Departments
of Labor and Justice as to this new labor law, 71 cases have
peen referred to us by the Criminal Division for investigation
and 41 have been completed. Of the 3 cases received this week,
two had been forwarded to the Criminal Division by the
Department of Labor, which makes a total of 31 cases received
from the Criminal Division upon referral from the Department
of Labor. :

These investigations involve (1) embezzlement of
union funds, (2) convicted felons holding.union office and
(3) deprivation.of rights of union members by force or violence.
They are instituted only upon receipt of specific requests
from the Criminal Division. The Department will render decisions
as to prosecution. Top priority investigations have been
ordered and close deadlines have been set.

In addition, there are 170 cases under investigation
concerning the prohibition in the new law against communists >

holding union office. yA co akectues Os dbioas Cerotg '

: By memorandum dated May 24, 1960, the Criminal i

ANTITRUST AND MONOPOLY SUBCOMMITTEE
COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY
ESTES KEFAUVER, CHAIRMAN

Recently Senator Kefauver's Committee requested
the Bureau to conduct name checks on 304 individuals
reportedly associated with the boxing industry. Several
of these names were duplicated on a prior requést for a
name check by Senator Kefauver's Committee. It appeared
that the Committee might be conducting a fishing expedition
by submitting such an extensive list. Accordingly, the
matter was referred to the Department to answer the Conmittee' s
request.

On May 25, 1960, William G. Hundley, Chief,
Organized Crime and Racketeering Section, Criminal |
Division, telephonically advised that following a contact
with the Kefauver Committee on that date the original
request for name checks on 304 individuals had been
reduced to a request for name checks on 30 individuals.

Of these 30, Mr. Hundley pointed out that where any
individual was the subject of pending prosecution, such

as Frankie Carbo, it would be unnecessary for the Bureau

to search its files concerning that individual. Myr. Hundley
also advised the Committee representatives that it would not
be possible in every instance to make name checks on an
expeditious basis while the hearings were being conducted
inasmuch as the time factor in making the name checks would

. depend upon the number of references involved. Mr. Hundley

7 NW 65360 Docld:32989646 Page 816

is sending a memorandum to the Bureau in the immediate -
future listing the names which the Committeé has now
requested be checked.

Upon receipt of Mr. Hundley's memorandum listing
the names, the names will be checked and appropriate summaries

ADMINISTRATIVE DIVISION —

1. FEDERAL EMPLOYEES HEALTH BENEFITS ACT OF 1959 - FBI CANNOT
ABSORB ANY COSTS INCIDENT THERETO

The provisions of this new legislation, which was enacted by the
86th Congress, First Session, and approved by the President, become effective -
July 1, 1960. :

Its purpose is to provide health insurance for Federal employees,
annuitants, and their families. Employees will have the option of selecting from
four health plans with a wide range of benefits. The legislation provides that the -
Government will contribute 50% of the premium cost of the plan selected, subject
to stated minimum and maximum ranges.

We cannot accurately estimate the cost to the FBI of these new
benefits until the Civil Service Commission has dealt with the insuring groups
to determine the cost of the plans and until the employees have selected the
desired coverage. Preliminary estimates, however, indicate an added cost of
approximately $1,000,000 per year to the FBI as the employer's cost of these
new benefits, based on the Bureau's experience derived from the operation of its
present health coverage plan. :

The appropriation request of this Bureau represents an absolute
minimum figure. All avenues of possible savings were thoroughly explored in
arriving at the minimum figure requested. As a result, it will be impossible
for the FBI to absorb any part of the added cost resulting from the Federal
Employees Health Benefits Act of 1959.

2, ADMINISTRATION'S 2% SAVINGS PROGRAM, FISCAL YEAR 1960

Budget Director Stans, in a letter dated Sananee 21, 1959, to
the Attorney General, stated the President had asked him to request the’ continued
cooperation of the ‘Attorney General in reducing civilian employment in the Govern-
ment. The letter pointed out that during the fiscal year 1959 executive agencies
effected a 2% reduction in employment and that the President would like to effect
a similar reduction in the fiscal year 1960, and requests the Attorney General to
give personal direction to the program and to plan his operations so as to accomplish

NW 65360 Docld:32989646 Page 819



it. The reduction would be effected by not filling vacancies as they occur and

by not establishing new positions. The letter further directs that agency plans
for personnel reductions or facts as to why an agency head believes the requested
2% reduction is impracticable be presented to the Budget Bureau with the

October financial plan.

In connection with the 2% savings program in effect during the fiscal
year 1959, the Bureau advised the Attorney General that it would be impossible
to make any such reduction as the Bureau's operations were already on a "strict
austerity" basis.

The Department cut our fiscal year 1961 budget request by $400, 000,
reducing it from $117, 500,000 to $117, 100,000, thereby eliminating 45 employees
for the field (80 Special Agents and 15 clerks).

The Bureau is in no position to effect a 2% reduction in personnel
during fiscal year 1960. Our work loads in all categories continue to be heavy
with no sign of any abatement. Legislation enacted in the closing days of Congress,
specifically the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure.Act of 1959, will
further bolster our work volumes for which funds have not been provided and to
attempt to reduce our personnel by 2% would seriously impair this Bureau's
ability to discharge its responsibilities in all fields of work.

3. SALARY RETENTION ACT, PUBLIC LAW 85-737

This act provides a two-year period of salary retention for employees
demoted through no fault of their own if they have occupied a higher paying position
for two years or longer. This act has caused a most inequitable situation by
requiring employees who accepted temporary promotions to be paid more than
permanent employees who are doing identical work. By memorandum dated
July 17, 1959, we urged the Department to recommend Jegislation so as to Change
this situation at the earliest possible time. To date no ‘legislation has been
introduced which would effect the desired correction of this inequitable situation.

INVESTIGATIVE DIVISION

1, Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 (Public Law
86-257)

The new labor law, as above, became effective upon its signing
by the President on September 14, 1959.

The language in the Act conferred authority upon the Secretary of
Labor to conduct investigations of the majority of the provisions contained
in the law. Authority was also granted to the Secretary of Labor to enter
into agreements with other agencies to handle investigations.

The Criminal Division of the Department of Justice during September,.
1959, has held conferences with officials. of the Department of Labor for the
purpose of arriving at an agreement to be signed by the Departments of Justice
and Labor specifying those criminal provisions of the law, as well as the
prohibition against a member of the Communist Party holding office in a
labor union, which the FBI will investigate.

Preliminary conferences indicate investigative jurisdiction of the
following violations will be conferred upon the Bureau:

Embezzlement of union funds; payment by an employer of a fine
imposed upon a labor union officer; prohibition against communists and
convicted felons holding union office; picketing for extortion purposes;
deprivation by force or violence of rights of union members; and retention by
FBI of an amendment in the Act broadening the Labor-Management Relations
Act of 1947.

The finalizing of the agreement between the Departments of Justice
and Labor has not been effected. Until itis, we are not initiating investi-
gations without a specific request from the Department of Justice.

We have, however, received 85 specific'requests from the Criminal
Division to determine whether certain convicted felons are holding office at
this time in labor unions in violation of that section of the Act (Section 504).

We have also received 52 names of individuals who are reportedly
labor union officials, from the Department, requesting a check of Bureau and
Identification Division files. Eighteen such name checks have been completed.
These were highly placed Teamsier officials and trustees. We are not
processing the remaining 34 names until the Department provides us with
further identifying data as to the individuals.

2. FEDERAL CLEARINGHOUSE OF CRIMINAL INFORMATION

Various proposals have been brought forth in the past
by individuals such as Senator Kefauver, Chief William Parker of
the Los Angeles Police Department, Milton Wessel of the Department,
and Senator McClellan for the establishment of a central Federal
clearinghouse of information on crime. More recently New York
State Attorney General Louis J. Lefkowitz has proposed a clearing-
house. of information concerning frauds on the consumer and
investor public.

Our position in the past has consistently been that there

-is no need for such a clearinghouse and that the necessary and

desirable dissemination of criminal-type information is already
being accomplished within the framework of existing law enforcement
structures. ‘

Some of the serious objections to such a proposed
clearinghouse are that it would be an unwarranted intrusion of .
the Federal Government into local affairs. There is the possibility
that such a clearinghouse would provide an official medium for the
dissemination of unverified data consisting of rumor and gossip
and that corrupt and irresponsible individuals would be presented
with the opportunity to use such information for purposes of blackmail
or extortion. In addition to the foregoing, the establishment of such
a clearinghouse would constitute a costly superstructure on already
existing facilities and could result in the establishment of a “black
list" characterizing certain individuals as violators on the basis of
information not completely verified or authenticated.

The Bureau already disseminates on a daily basis
innumerable items of information to local, county, state and
Federal agencies. This information may not only relate to matters
over which we have jurisdiction but extends to any items which may
be of interest to other agencies. The channels for dissemination of
information are already established and the use of these.channels by
all agencies would appear to obviate the need for any central clearing-
house of information.

3. NEED FOR CRIMINAL-TYPE LEGISLATION

Since April 30, 1958, the Bureau has suggested certain items
of legislation relative to establishing some effective curbs on the activities of.
racketeers, The most recent communication to the Department in this regard
was a memorandum to Deputy Attorney General Walsh dated September 2,
1959, captioned "Legislative Program, Eighty-sixth Congress, Second Session."
These legislative suggestions are as follows:

1, There appears to be a need for legislation to prohibit the
interstate transportation of certain gambling paraphernalia, such as number
slips and punch boards in addition to the present prohibition of interstate
transportation of slot machines.

2, It also appears the interstate transmission of gambling
information should be restricted to prohibit the transmission of gambling
information in interstate or foreign commerce by any communication facility.

. Such legislation should also encompass the transmission of information as to
the results of horse racing events until after a specified time had elapsed.
The inability to have current race results would discourage the operations of
bookmaking establishments,

8. Inasmuch as under the present provisions of the Internal
Revenue Code income derived from illegal businesses and from gambling
constitutes income which is taxable and assessed in the same manner as
legitimate income, it appears that if the income from such illicit sources were
taxed at vastly higher rates it might make such activities financially prohibitive.
Inasmuch as certain individuals would attempt to avoid such taxes, it might
be desirable to initiate legislation to provide substantial criminal penalties for
the failure to pay such taxes,

4, It also appears legislation may be desirable to amend the
White Slave Traffic Act in order that the prostitute herself could be prosecuted.
There is considerable activity among those who are engaged in this livelihood
and who go from state to state in order to ply their trade,

5. As an added weapon against organized crime, it appears it
may be desirable to afford consideration to the enactment of a Federal habitual
criminal act which would provide for mandatory sentences upon the commission
of offenses within Federal jurisdiction,

In addition, the Bureau is in agreement with the Administration's
theory of amending the Fugitive Felon Act to include damage by fire or
explosives to religious or educational facilities. The House Judiciary Committee
has failed to approve this proposal and has adopted a bill (H,R. 8601) which would
prohibit damage to any building, structure, facility, vehicle or dwelling house,

NW 65360 Docld:32989646 Page 823 -5-



It is our view that such legislation should be restricted to cover educational
and religious facilities only. This was called-to the Department's attention
by the afore-mentioned memorandum dated September 2, 1959, captioned
"Legislative Program, Eighty~sixth Congress, Second Session. "

| NW 65360 Docld:32989646 Page 824



DOMESTIC INTELLIGENCE DIVISION

On March 12, 1959, the Director attended a conference in the Attorney
General's office in connection with current security programs and matters
collateral thereto. The Director expressed the view that security programs
had been held in abeyance in the Department of Justice with the result that
other agencies of the Government were taking advantage of such delays and
offering as excuses for nonaction the fact that the Department of Justice
had not yet indicated what should be done or should not be done in view of
some decisions of the courts and anticipated decisions of the courts. The
Director urged that basic action should be taken on certain of these programs,
While some of these matters have been acted upon, others are still pending and
are set forth below for the Director's information.

(i) Industrial Security Program - At the time of the March conference it

was decided to wait until the Greene and Taylor cases had gone through the

Supreme Court. This has now occurred and the Supreme Court has indicated

that there was not proper authority for an Industrial Security Program flowing

from the President or the Congress. The Court also strongly indicated that

even with such authority that there was a need for confrontation of witnesses

at such hearings. To meet this, the Administration is discouraging legislation

and approaching the matter through an Executive Order, two drafts of which

have been examined by the Department and the Bureau. The proposed Order

appears impractical in some respects and Yeagley of the Department has advised

us that the Attorney General and the Solicitor General do not like the Order as
’ drafted, particularly the "special counsel" concept and Deputy Attorney General

Walsh is being instructed to "bounce the Order back to the White House." By

letter dated September 30, 1959, to the Attorney Gneral, copies to Walsh and

Yeagley, the Bureau went on record that while we would attempt to live up to

any Order, the Department should carefully consider the position of the Department

and the Bureau under the proposed Order in that we would be forced to turn

down numerous requests to produce informants and séurces for testimony or

interview in view of our overriding responsibility to protect their identities in

the interests of national security. This might open the Department and the

Bureau up to cfiticism that we were not living up to the spirit of the Executive

Order. i
From the standpoint of the conference with the Attorney General on
October 6, we think the Bureau's position should be that the Industrial Security Pro-
gram problem should be settled either through Executive Order or legislation;

NW 65360 Docid:32989646 Page 825 tee



Domestic Intelligence Division

that whichever means is used must be practical and not merely drawn up in
a visionary manner in an attempt to satisfy the Supreme Court but end up
by placing the investigative agencies in an.untenable position because they
cannot comply with the spirit of the Order.

(2) Port Security Program - There has been no change in the Port Security
Program with the exception that Treasury Department has drafted proposed
legislation to enable the Coast Guard to subpoena and pay the travel expenses of
witnesses to appear at Coast Guard hearings. Treasury has indicated this
bill is in the Bureau of the Budget. At the March 12, 1959, conference the
Director pointed out that positive action should be taken toward getting such
legislation and the confrontation issue should not be used as an excuse to scrap

-the program because the FBI had supplied a substantial number of witnesses
who could appear and testify. The Bureau's position should be the same;

namely, that the wherewithal should be devised to carry forth the program instead
of scrapping it. It should be borne in mind that in Port Security hearings as

-in many other security-type hearings the question of confrontation will continue

to be an issue and the pattern set by the Executive Order in the Industrial
Security Program will probably be applied to the other types of security hearings.

(8) Air Crewmen Screening Program - The Air Crewmen Screening
Program is a program proposed by ICIS to screen crews of United States planes
engaged in international flights and to screen all holders of Airmen's Certificates.
The ICIS also proposed the Federal Communications Commission Radio Screening
Program which would require the screening of all operators of radio transmitters.
To our knowledge, nothing has been done on either of these programs since the
March, 1959, conference with the Attorney General. While the FBI originally
concurred that these programs would be helpful, we have not pushed them,
believing this is a proper function of ICIS. It is believed the Bureau's position
should be that a decision should be reached as to whether these programs should
be implemented and they should not be allowed to hang fire on the basis that
they might not be agreeable or acceptable to the Supreme Court. In other words,
security programs should not be left in a status of hiatus because of pending
judicial decisions.

(4) Persqnnel Security Program - The March, 1959 conference discussed
the Personnel Security Program, particularly whether there should be legislation
to provide for an over-all security program which would cover both sensitive

NW 65360 Docld:32989646 Page 826


Domestic Intelligence Division

and nonsensitive areas. This is still an undecided issue although several bills
have been introduced into Congress to remove the distinction between sensitive
and nonsensitive areas of Federal employment. Undoubtedly, the Greene
decision in the Supreme Court carrying the strong inference that confrontation
is necessary in security-type hearings has slowed up consideration of legislation
in this field by the Department. This is essentially a Departmental problem

and we feel the Bureau's position again should be that the Department should
meet these issues rather than coast along in a state of indecision. ~

(5) In the field of legislation involving security, by letter dated September 2,
1959, the Bureau proposed to Deputy Attorney General Walsh the following items,
which the Director might wish to point out to the Attorney General. While bills
were introduced into Congress on some of these items, legislation has not been
completed as to any of them.

(a) It is desirable that Title 18, Section 791, United States Code, be
amended to extend the jurisdiction of the Federal courts over acts of espionage
against the United States wherever committed.

{b) Amendment of the Foreign Agents Registration Act to clarify
and make more specific the definition of a "Foreign Principal" and to further
clarify the exemption to registration afforded business representatives.

(c) Legislation is suggested which would permit the Secretary of
State to consider security factors in the granting of passports; however,
appropriate provisions should be made to protect FBI informants and sources
in this connection. This matter is mentioned in the Bureau's memorandum
to Walsh dated May 26, 1959, regarding H. R. 7006.

(a) Another suggestion is legislation to strengthen the Smith Act of
1940 by defining the word "organize" and the word "advocacy." A definition
of "organize" was introduced as H. R. 2369 and as S. 1300. §&. 1305 attempts
to define "advocacy."

{e) Legislation is needed which would prohibit former Government
employees from disclosing to unauthorized individuals certain information
obtained by them in the course of their employment.

(f) Legislation is needed to amend the espionage laws so as to
provide punishment for persons who gather and correlate data from legitimate
-sources for ‘transmittal to foreign governments.

_nW.65360_Docld:32989646 Page 827



Domestic Intelligence Division

(6) In addition to the above, the Director may wish to point out to the
Attorney General the tendency on the part of the Department of Justice,
as well as Government departments in general, to shy away from pursuing

- logical courses of action in the security field rather. than to implement necessary

security programs, this tendency apparently based on attempts to anticipate
decisions by the Supreme Court. The net effect of this is that the Supreme
Court is not required to meet these issues and render decisions and thus,
historically, to take responsibility for them. It is our feeling itis a far better
course of action to attempt to implement those programs necessary for our
national security and give ground grudgingly and only where forced to do so
so that the record will show that the Department and the FBI sought to
carry out their responsibilities in a proper manner.

Miss Gandy has advised that in connection with ie
Mr. Hoover's luncheon meeting with the Acting Attorney General
tomorrow, it would be helpful if we could set forth for the Director's
information any items which might come up for discussion.

The attached data prepared by the various Divisions
throughout the Bureau may be helpful to Mr. Hoover in connection

FBI BUDGET REQUEST - FISCAL YEAR 1968

The Bureau's request for 1968 totals $186,574,000, It will
provide for a personnel staff totaling 15,780 (6,638 agents and 9,142
clerks). The request makes provision for an increase of 569 full-year
employees (106 agents and 463 clerks) when compared to 1967.

Of the additional employees, 165 (100 agents and 65 clerks)
are for assignment to the field to assist in the handling of a heavy
vobume of civil rights werk. (This is the second increment of a
total increase of 300 agents and attendant clerical staff and
equipment previously ordered by the President for civil rights
work over a three-year period to be implemented at the rate of 100 agents
a year.) The remaining 404 employees (6 agents and 398 clerks) are for
assignment at our headquarters, the bulk to be utilized to handle the
tremendous increase in name and fingerprint checks being received.

The request of $186,574,000 for 1968 is an increase of
$4,249,000 when compared to the total requirements for the current
fiscal year 1967 which includes $175,465,000 already appropriated
and by a supplemental request totaling $6,860,000 brought about
by costs growing out of new legislation increasing our payroll
costs ($5,250,000) and by new legislation increasing the costs we
must pay to transfer employees to meet the needs of the service
($1,610,000).

Most careful consideration was given to our request for
additional personnel in 1968. We are absorbing much work and will
endeavor to make further absorptions. When confronted. with a
one-million increase in fingerprint receipts, a 43% increase in
name checks, a heavy amount of civil rights and other work, we
have no alternative but to ask for additional manpower’ if we are to.
meet our responsibilities in these areas,

The Bureau's growing.work is not limited to these particular
areas by any means. The work of the FBI Laboratory mounted to a new
all-time peak during the fiscal year 1966, numerous criminal classifi-
cations reached new highs, and our work in matters vital to the internal
security of tke country has continued to increase, We are going to
do our best to handle the mounting work in these areas with our
existing staff. In addition, new items of legislation continue to be
passed adding to our work.

SPECIAL INVESTIGATIVE DIVISION
CRIMINAL INTELLIGENCE AND ORGANIZED CRIME SECTION

During the past few months the Department has
launched into a program of review of past, current, and
contemplated prosecutions to determine if such cases have
been materially affected by the use of electronic listening
devices. This has required the establishment of special
microphone indices at ‘Bureau Headquarters and voluminous
correspondence with various field divisions to determine if
individuals listed in the Department's inauiries wére covered
by FBI microphones. With regard to listed individuals on
whom we have had some form of microphone coverage, we are so
advising the Department and pertinent logs, together in
some cases with other supporting material, are being obtained
from the field for review by Departmental attorneys.

The Department made public the fact that such a™
review was under way in the filing of a memorandum with the
Supreme Court by the Solicitor General in the Joseph Schipani
case, November 30, 1966.

Set forth as follows are the brief circumstances
_ regarding individual prosecutive situations in which, to
date, the Department has made disclosures to various courts
regarding the FBI's use of electronic listening devices of
pertinence to those prosecutions.

Joseph Frank Schipani

Schipani is a New York hoodium and a member of
La Cosa Nostra who was convicted and sentenced to three years
imprisonment and fined $12,500 for violation of the income tax
laws for the years 1956 through 1960. In response to the
Department's request, they were provided with logs reporting
those instances where Schipani was covere&é by an electronic
surveillance. This electronic surveillance was not directly .
on Schipani but was in an office frequented by top La Cosa
Nostra racket figures. On November 30, 1966, the Solicitor
General requested the Supreme Court to vacate the judgment
regarding Schipani of the Court of Appeals and remand the
case to the District Court for a new trial. On December 12,
1966, the Supreme Court complied with the request of the
Solicitor General. This was installed under the general
authority of the Attorney General, as were all of the
following unless otherwise specified,

NW 65360 Docld:32989646 Page 843 .



Louis J. Taglianetti

The Department on December 27, 1966, filed a motion
to remand in the United States Court of Appeals for the First~
Circuit in the Louis J. Taglianetti appeal from the judgment

‘of the United States District Court for the District of

Rhode Island. Taglianetti, a member of the Raymond Patriarca
"family" of La Cosa Nostra, was indicted on February 26, 1963,
for income tax evasion for the years 1956, 1957, and 1958.

He was found guilty on September 16, 1966. Taglianetti
appealed but no brief had yet been filed.

The Department's motion indicated Taglianetti's
conversations had been monitored by microphone surveillance
at the place of business of a close associate (Raymond Patriarca)
where Taglianetti andothers met and that this establishment
was being utilized for purposes connected with organized crime.
On various occasions between March, 1962, when this microphone
was installed with trespass under general authority of the
Attorney General, until 1965, Taglianetti's conversations
related to his income tax indictment. None of the information
was used in evidence or was the source of leads to any evidence
in the case.

The Department's motion noted that Taglianetti's
case was within the ambit of the Supreme Court's decision in
the Black case, decided November 7, 1966. The distinguishing
feature between the two is the intrusion upon attorney-client
conversations in the Black case, for which the Supreme Court

vacated the conviction and granted a new trial. The Department's

reasons for the motion to remand in Taglianetti was for the
limited purpose of enabling the District Court to examine the
facts and to determine whether Taglianetti's conviction should
stand or a new trial be ordered.

The defense has now filed a motion for new trial
claiming that, “The Government, having tasted the forbidden
fruit of its illegal bugging and having withheld all knowledge
thereof from the defendant, his counsel and the trial judge,
cannot now preserve the conviction thus obtained because such
forbidden fruit failed to produce a sweet taste." Hearings
on these motions have not yet been scheduled,

FRANK DE NIRO, JR.
MICHAEL DE NIRO
LOUIS DE NIRO

The De Niro brothers were convicted 8/23/65 of
conspiring to defraud the U. S, in evading estate taxes.
They have appealed to the U. S. Court of Appeals for the
Sixth Circuit. The Cleveland Office conducted a microphone
surveillance from 2/19/64 to 6/16/64 in the office of the
National Cigarette Service, Youngstown, Ohio, a vending
machine company, operated by the De Niros, In response to the
Department's request 10/14/66 we disclosed the circumstances
of this surveillance to them by letter 10/18/66, and made
available for review the surveillance logs. No information
from this source was disseminated outside the Bureau.

The Department subsequently disclosed to the
Court of Appeals by memorandum the existance of our
microphone surveillance, Considerable reluctance was
displayed by the Department to including in this
memorandum our general authority for installation of
electronic surveillances. They did not clearly record the
dates concerning the manner in which the Department requested
and was advised of our coverage. Our protests were clearly
outlined in correspondence to the Department before this
memorandum was filed. Uitimately our authority was recorded
as a footnote, This microphone was installed under the
general authority of the Attorney General.

Frank Peter Balistrieri

Balistrieri, the "boss" of Milwaukee's La Cosa

Nostra "family," and as such the leader of organized crime

_ in that area, was brought to trial in United States District
Court, Springfield, Illinois, during October, 1966, on
the basis of an indictment’ charging evasion of Federal
income taxes, An early issue in this action was our
microphone coverage of Balistrieri and certain of his
associates, Microphone coverage had been established on
Balistrieri's office, in an apartment maintained by his
paramour, and in the office of hoodlum attorney Dominic Frinzi,
all in Milwaukee, for various periods between 1961 and 1965,
These installations were all made in line with general
departmental authorization as outlined in the Department's
memorandum filed with the Supreme Court in the Black case,

NW 65360 Docld:32989646 Page 845 ie 5 - .



NW 65360 Docld:32989646 Page 846 -6-

The defense has made a motion to suppress, based
on this electronic coverage. ‘After hearing testimony
regarding these installations, including testimony of
Bureau personnel, and reviewing logs of the coverage in
question, the judge instructed that the trial should be
commenced, with the defense having the right to renew its
mortion after the trial, in the event evidence presented
warrants such a proceedings.

Trial was undertaken on 10/17/66. On 11/29/66
Defense Attorney Walsh suffered a heart attack and further
trial proceedings have been deferred until March 1, 1967.
None of the information produced by this microphone was
utilized in obtaining the indictment of Balistrieri.

Ronald David Carabbia

Carabbia was convicted 6/21/65 for violation of
wagering tax laws and has appealed to the U. S. Court of
Appeals, Sixth Circuit. The Cleveland Office conducted a
microphone surveillance at the Modern News Center and
Novelties Company, Youngstown, from 1/22/62 until 3/22/62.
Carabbia and his brothers operated a gambling game at this
location. Activities covered by this surveillance included
gambling with numerous participants. The voices of the
individuals covered were never identified. It could not be
determined if -the appellant was or was not present during
the operation of this source.

In response to the Department's inquiry, we
disclosed to them by lette? dated 11/1/66 the circumstances
of this surveillance and made available for review all
surveillance logs. By letter dated 1/9/67, the Department
indicated its intention to disclose this microphone
surveillance by memorandum to the U. S. Court of Appeals,
Sixth Circuit. In three letters we have advised the Department
of the brief operation of-this source and that the individuals
covered were never identified. The Department's proposed
memorandum to the court notes, "There is a substantial
question Whether any conversations in which appellant
participated were even monitored.” In spite of this, the
Department apparently feels it must disclose this surveillance.
The Department failed to-include our general authorization for
installation of electronic surveililances over our protests.
We feel that at the very least the general authorization of the
Department should bein all briefs going to courts so there can
be no accusation that the Bureau was operating in an uncontrolled
and unrestrained manner,



Jack T. Rainwater

Jack T, Rainwater has conducted a large-scale
numbers operation in the Miami, Florida area. He and six
associates were convicted of state gambling violations in
Florida courts based upon evidence furnished by the
Internal Revenue Service and testimony of Internal Revenue
Service agents. =

In response to the Department's request they.
were provided with logs reporting those instances where
Rainwater and one of his associates who also was convicted
in state court, were monitored by an electronic surveillance.
Neither of these individuals were the direct subject of an
electronic surveillance.

On January 11, 1967, the Solicitor General
disclosed to the Supreme Court that an electronic device
had been utilized by Federal agents in the Rainwater matter.

Our installation in this matter was made under
general authority of the Attorney General. Information from
this source was disseminated to Internal Revenue Service who
in turn disseminated to local authorities.

Charles Joseph Battaglia, Jr.

Battaglia is a Tucson, Arizona, La Cosa Nostra
member who was closely affiliated with Joseph Bonanno a
former La Cosa Nostra "Commission" member. A microphone
for criminal intelligence purposes had been maintained on
him under general Departmental authority. He was arrested by
Bureau Agents for violation of the Hobbs Act in March, 1965,

. as a result of making threats in an effortyto force a Tucson
firm to utilize his vending machirs, Following the granting
of several continuances the trial judge in Federal District
Court ordered Battaglia to appear for trial on the morning
of January~11, 1967, The Department advised that they intended
to infonm the judge that Battaglia had been covered by microphone
surveillaitces, but that the coverage had no bearing on the
evidence to be produced in substantiation of the criminal
charges against Battaglia. The Department further advised

NW 65360 Docld:32989646 Page 847 .



they were going to recommend that the judge proceed with

the trial and at the conclusion thereof, if the judge feels

it necessary, a hearing will be held to determine the validity
of the Department's claim regarding the microphone evidence.

A hearing on this motion is scheduled for Monday,
January 16, 1967, in Tucson, Arizona,

Edward L. Levinson, et. al., Civil Suit

On December 10, 1965, Edward Levinson, at that time
one of the owners of the Fremont Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada,
filed a $6,000,000 damage suit (later reduced to $4,200,000)
against four Bureau Agents, charging invasion of privacy and
asking injunctive relief against further invasion by use of
electronic listening devices, Levinson filed a similar suit
against the Central Telephone Company of Las Vegas and certain
of its employees.

The case has recently been taken over personally by
Assistant Attorney General Barefoot Sanders who.is presently
reviewing all of the material in connection with preparing
a response to plaintiff's motions, No date has been set for
trial in matter. The Bureau has been pressing the Department
to take depositions in this case from such major hoodlums as
Meyer Lansky and Gerardo Catena who have hidden interests in
the Fremont Hotel.

Fred B. Black, Jr.

Fred B. Black, Jr., named as being hired by front
men in Las Vegas to represent their interests in Washington,
. D. C., where Black was alleged to have influence, was convicted
on May 5, 1965, of evading income taxes. for the period of
1956 through 1959, After a number of appeais he petitioned the
Supreme Court for issuance pf a writ of certiorari which was
denied on May 4, 1966.

Oh May 24, 1966, Solicitor General Thurgood Marshall

filed a memorandum with the Supreme Court reporting a listening
device had*been placed in Black's hotel suite in 1963, but

-8- :

NW 65360 Docid:32989646 Page 848

{
Hy



none of the evidence used in Black's trial was obtained as
‘a result of the listening device. The Supreme Court on
June 13, 1966, ordered a response by the Department to
questions raised by the Court with regard to the initial
memorandum filed by the Department which was answered on
July 13, 1966, by supplemental memorandum,

This memorandum indicated the listening device,
installed with trespass under general Departmental authori-~
zation had monitored conversations of Black and his attorney.

The United States Supreme Court on November 7, .
1966, vacated the income tax conviction and granted a new
trial, which will not be set until after the Robert Baker trial. |

Peer reer rere acces eceereesee rere rareresensoeeeeresseseresene

To date, the Bureau has received over 1,000 names
of individuals of prosecutive interest for a determination
if such.subjects have been covered by FBI microphones. A
number of problems have resulted.

One problem which has been encountered, and

which can be expected to be even more serious in the future,
is the lack of identifying data accompanying the names of
-individuals on whom the Department has made inquiry in these
matters. For example, one list recently received included
475 names, in some cases with a minimum of identifying data
and in others with no identifying data at all. In order that
an accurate determinatiom can be made whether an individual
in question has, in fact, been covered by one of our microphones,
it will be necessary that the Department provide adequate
identifying data when submitting these names for review.

.

—NWW"65360—Bocid:32989646—-Page-B49———



An attendant problem has arisen in certain
inquiries in which the Department has made unreasonable
requests for such reviews on extremely short notice. One of
these involved a request for the results of the review later
the same day it was received. Thoroughness and accuracy, of
absolute necessity in this type review, make extremely rapid
checks such as this in most cases impossible, and at best,

a very dangerous procedure.

With regard to those situations in which the
Department has made disclosures to the various courts,
continuing reluctance has been evidenced on their part to
inform the court of the fact that the installation in question
has been utilized by the FBI under either specific authority
from the Attorney General, or under the general Departmental
authority which was granted. The Department has been repeatedly
reminded of their reluctance in these individual situations.

‘The volume involved in this project has caused
“a decided strain on the Bureau in processing these numerous
inquiries to date, and these problems become magnified when
the enormity of the entire project is assessed, in view of
indications by the Department that the full review may
encompass as many as 30,000 mmes.

FUGITIVE SECTION
Cassius Marcellus Clay

Cassius Clay, world's heavyweight boxing

champion and Black Muslim, earlier this year filed a
claim as a conscientious objector and more recently has
applied to his draft board at Louisville, Kentucky, for
a@ ministerial deferment as a minister of the Black Muslim
religion, After a very extensive investigation by the
Bureau, Clay's draft board denied his claim as a
conscientious objector and placed him in a 1-A classification,
Since the board's vote was unanimous, he has no further
appeal as a.conscientious objector. His ministerial
deferment request will now have to be considered by his

. local board which our sources indicate will meet in the
next few days. If the local board denies this request,
Clay has the right to appeal,

ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCES

As of January 12, 1967, the Bureau has 17
domestic intelligence telephone Surveillances. These
provide coverage o, i

dom b organiza
and individuals.

All of the above electronic surveillances which
we have in operation were approved in writing by the
Acting Attorney General on December 29, 1966, for a period
through March 31, 1967. :

DOMINICAN SITUATION

‘The FBI was ordered into the Dominican Republic by
the President in May, 1965, to develop information to be used
in preventing communists from gaining control in that country.
We set up a staff of ten Agents. In August, 1966, at White
House instructions we established a permanent Legal Attache
office there, staffed with three Agents.

i The six~mdonth-old government under Joaquin Balaguer
has brought about a degree of stability. Nevertheless, there
continue to be strong undercurrents of dissension, The
rightists reportedly have considered plots to remove Balaguer.
Juan Bosch's political party, loser in the June, 1966, election,
has been most vocal in its opposition to Balaguer's programs.
The communist groups have suffered much internal dissension
but to accomplish a common cause could be expected to regroup
as they have in the past. In fact, a student strike in Santo
Domingo, which began January 9, 1967, has attracted strong
communist support and has served as a rallying point for the
extreme leftists. Within two days, seventy percent of the
students in secondary schools had joined the strike.

This is but one of numerous problems which beset
Balaguer, although to date he has been able to meet each one
head on.

MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR,

Martin Luther King, Jr., President, Southern Christian
Leadership Conference, is currently writing a book to be entitled
"Where Do We Go From Here" to be published in the spring. This-
book allegedly will deal with the resurgence of the "white back-
lash} "black power," and propose a course of action the Federal
Government should take concerning the civil rights movement.

King has been counseled by Stanley Levison, his principal advisor
and long-time communist, to run for President of the United States
in 1968. He has this suggestion under consideration and
reportedly has made no decision, We maintain a wire tap on
Stanley Levison to determine the degree of communist. influence

in the racial field.

STOKELY CARMICHAEL : -

Stokely Carmichael, Chairman, Student Nonviolent
Coordinating Committee, a highly militant civil rights

as well as urging Negroes not fight in Vietnam, At present,
Carmichael is facing charges of "inciting to riot" in Atlanta,
Georgia, and Selma, Alabama. He was convicted of these charges
in Selma, Alabama; however, the conviction is currently under
appeal by him, Carmichael recently underwent a physical re-
examination to determine his suitability for military service,
The results of this examination have not been made known.

_ ROBERT G. BAKER
FRAUD AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT
CONFLICT OF INTEREST -

The most recent development relative to the trial
of Baker is the disclosure in the afternoon edition of "The
Evening Star," 1/12/67, that the Narcotics Bureau of the
Treasury Department installed a "bug" in the Baker case. It
is reported that this installation relates to the Department's
admission during the trial that it had planted a microphone
and transmitter on Wayne Bromley, a prime Government witness,
in order to record the results of a meeting held on 3/26/65,
at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel, Los Angeles, California, which
was attended by Baker, Clifford Jones and Bromley. The
article points out that the FBI had refused a request of the
Department to cover this meeting. It also points out that
according to Edward Bennett Williams,. Baker's attorney, that
in compliance with an order of Judge Gasch to turn over tapes
and transcripts, only notes made by two monitors were received
indicating the tape was not usable or available.

This meeting at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel is the
meeting which was arranged during telephone calls on -3/25/65,
between Bromley and Baker and Bromley and Jones which were
monitored and tape recorded by the Bureau at the request of
the Department, with the Department's assurance that such action
was legal and with the written consent of Bromley. A complete
transcript of these recordings was made available to the
Department.

Although the Department did on 3/25/65, request that
we monitor the meeting in Los Angeles, we refused to do so.
Upon revelation during pretrial hearings that this meeting
was monitored, Acting Attorney General Ramsey Clark was questioned
as to who performed this monitoring. He stated that he had ascer-
‘tained that upon the FBI's refusal to comply with the departmental
request, the Department had then turned to wither the Immigration
and Naturalization Service*(INS) or the Bureau of Narcotics.
He was certain that it was the Bureau of Narcotics.

The only other coverage of-any conversations by Baker
was accidgntal in nature and resulted from installations which
had been placed on Fred B. Black in Washington, D. C.; the
Fremont Hotel, Las Vegas, Nevada, Edward Siegelbaum, Miami,

-19-
_ NW 65360 Docld:32989646 Page 874 .



Florida, (a11 in connection with organized crime matters) and
the Dominican Embassy (in connection with security matters).
Details concerning these installations were set forth ina
summary memorandum regarding the Bureau's involvement in the
prosecution of Baker. dated 1/10/67.

: Logs relative to the electronic surveillances on
Black, the Fremont Hotel and Siegelbaum were furnished to .
the Department and excerpts were furnished to the trial judge
who ordered that they be made available to the defense. These
logs were the subject of pretrial hearings during November, 1966,
following which the judge ruled that there was no causal
relationship between the information in the logs and the
charges in the indictment.

Logs concerning Baker's conversations intercepted
on the Dominican Embassy installation were similarly furnished
to the Department and to the trial judge who placed a
protective order thereon and has instructed that any dis-
cussions relative to them must be held only in his chambers.
Information as to the existence of these logs has been
leaked to the press, presumably by Edward Bennett Williams
to cause some action favorable to his.client. His reporting
to the trial judge that the FBI was responsible for this leak
is absolutely ridiculous and is completely unfounded.

SAMES RIDDLE HOFFA; ET AL.
OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE

dames Riddle Hoffa and three others were convicted
in Chattanooga Federal Court, 3/4/64, of obstruction of
justice related to their efforts to tamper with certain
members of the jury in a previous trial of Hoffa, These
convictions were upheld by the U. S. Supreme Court on 12/12/66,

In response to a request from Assistant Attorney
General Fred M, Vinson, Jr., we furnished a letter to the
Acting Attorney General on 12/29/66, of instances in which
the conversations of Hoffa and two other defendants were
overheard through the use of electronic devices, Hoffa, his
office, and his home were not the direct targets of any
electronic devices in the development of this case, and the
Acting Attorney General was so advised in our memorandum of.
12/29/66, The instances in which he appeared to have been
present at’ conversations monitored occurred in Detroit,
Michigan, and Las Vegas, Nevada,

In 1961 and 1962 our Detroit office overheard
three conversations of Hoffa, These conversations were
broadcast to and from radio-telephones in automobiles
operated by Teamsters Union personnei in the Detroit area.
This was accomplished through the use of a tunable
commercial~type FM radio receiver which was in operation in
our Detroit office, No trespass was involved in this
connection,

In addition, between 2/1 and 8/12/63, Hoffa
appears to have participated in four telephone conversations
with two Las Vegas hoodium figures who were being covered by
electronic eavesdropping devices (trespass involved).
Hoffa's part of these conversations was not overheard.

Zeno Thomas Osborn, Jr., (Nashville lawyer and
former attorney for Hoffa) was convicted 6/29/64,.in
Nashville Federal Court of obstruction of justice arising
from his attempts to influence a potential juror in a forth-
coming trial of Hoffa, In this investigation, a miniature
recorder was concealed on a cooperative Government witness
during ameeting with Osborn, This installation was made
at the request of the Department and with the prior approval
of the two Federal judges in Nashville. No trespass was
involved, and the use of this’ installation was brought out
fully during Osborn's trial. His conviction was affirmed by
the Supreme Court 12/12/66, The Department is fully aware of

NW 65360 Docld:32989646 Page 876 - al - .



this installation and details of same were included in our
jetter to the Acting Attorriey General (12/29/66.

At the specific request of former Attorney General
Kennedy, a microphone surveillance (trespass required) was
conducted on the Washington, D. C., hotel room of James E,
Haggerty (former attorney for James Riddle Hoffa) during
period 8/7/61, through 8/11/61. This coverage was for the
specific purpose of identifying an alleged "contact" of
Hoffa's in the Justive Department, whom Kennedy thought
Haggerty would meet in Washington, Information concerning
this coverage was included in our letter to the Acting
Attorney General dated 12/29/66, In addition, in response
to a letter from Vinson dated 12/29/66, we furnished the
Acting Attorney General copies of logs. prepared in connection
with this coverage by memorandum dated 1/6/67.

JURY PANEL INVESTIGATIONS

On January 9, 1967, a letter was forwarded to
the Acting Attorney General advising him that in view of
the increasing sensitiveness to intrusion by the Federal-
Government into the rights of defendants in criminal
trials and in order to assure that future requests for
jury panel investigations would be made only in truly
exceptional cases, investigations of this nature should
not be undertaken by the Bureau except upon the specific
written request of the Attorney General or the Deputy
Attorney General and that our field offices were being so
instructed,

CIVIL RIGHTS MATTERS IN MISSISSIPPI

Two major civil rights cases are awaiting
prosecutive action in Mississippi. One of these cases
involves the murder of three civil rights workers near
Philadelphia, Mississippi, in June, 1964, in which case
eighteen subjects were previously indicted on civil rights
charges by a Federal Grand Jury. The other case involves
the shooting and burning of the residence of Vernon Ferdinand
Dahmer, past president of the NAACP,near Hattiesburg,
Mississippi, in January, 1966, resulting in the death of
Dahmer. A Federal Grand Jury indicted fifteen members of
the White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan of Mississippi
relative to the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and Civil Rights
Statute.

In view of a, court decision subsequent to the
above indictments, it was determined by the Government that
all of the indictments in these two cases are faulty because
certain minority groups including Negroes had been excluded
from the grand jury. The Department has been pushing for
early representations to a properly composed grand jury and
had contemplated that both of these cases would be given to
a Federal Grand Jury being empaneled 1/16/67.

On 1/3/67 U. S. District Judge Harold Cox advised
SAC Roy Moore that he had instructed the U. 8. Attorney to
use the January grand jury for the purpose of checking into
possible misuse of funds in the Headstart project sponsored
by the Office of Economic Opportunity in Mississippi. The
Judge referred to press accounts stating that the Government
was providing additional money for this project although
it has been alleged that several hundred thousand dollars
of the initial appropriation was unaccounted for. Judge Cox
said that he felt "first things come first" and therefore
decided to use the grand jury to ferret out any possible
fraud in connection with the failure to account for these
funds. He stated he woyld advise SAC Mdore when he convenes
another grand jury to hear the civil rights cases. Judge Cox
added that this will be done sometime in the near future
put thaf no specific date has been set. It has been
speculated in the press that if Judge Cox fails to promptly
call a*grand jury to hear the civil rights cases the
Government will seek mandamus from the U. S. Circuit Court
of Appeals for the purpose of forcing Judge Cox to call a
grand jury to hear these cases.

PROPOSED LEGISLATION REGARDING CRIMES
. AGAINST BANKING INSTITUTIONS :

By letter to the Attorney General 3/1/65, we called
_ attention to the rise in crimes against banking institutions and
recommended the Department propose legislation which would require
bank supervisory agencies to establish minimum security requirements
for all banks under Fedéral Charter. A follow-up letter was sent on
3/29/65, and again on 3/1/66. The Department advised on 4/12/66,
that a legislative proposal was being developed, A proposed bill was
submitted for our review on 6/6/66, which we returned on 6/9/66,
recommending no changes, In reply to our inquiry on 7/25/66, the
Department, on 8/3/66, advised the Bill was under study by the
Office of the Deputy Attorney General.

We inquired again on 10/6/66, and on 10/26/66, were
advised that since the 89th Congress was so near an end, the legis-
lation would be included on program for 90th Congress. By letter
11/28/66, we were advised that the Bill had been returned to the
Criminal Division with certain observations and suggestions. On
1/9/67, we again called attention to the increase in violations. Current
figures show that during calendar year 1966, violations increased to
1871, a new all-time high, surpassing the 1749 violations in calendar
year 1965.

‘WALTER BERYL CHIPMAN, ET AL.
CRIME ON HIGH SEAS

Alvin Junior Cupp, who had received a five-year
Federal term on 3/16/65, in Marquette, Michigan, furnished
information to Chicago Agents pinpointing officials and "goons"
of the Seamens International Union (STU) responsible for the
1963 bombing of the Canadian freighter, -' "Howard L, ean
in Chicago, Illinois. -

Upon Cupp's parole from prison 12/23/66, he was
immediately contacted by union officials allegedly for the purpose
of paying him off a promised $8, 000 for maintaining his silence
relative to the "Howard L. Shaw" bombing while in prison.

The U. S. Attorney's office in Chicago requested that an
electronic device be attached to Cupp's person to record con-
versations with union officials, anticipating evidence would be
obtained whereby prosecution of these officials would be
forthcoming. SAC, Chicago advised the U. 8. Attorney on
1/4/67, that the Bureau could not accede to his request since the
Solicitor General had publicly announced that all eavesdropping
is illegal.

At approximately 9 P.M., 1/5/67, the Acting Attorney
General called Mr. DeLoach relative to this case, indicating he
felt this was a legal device and he could see no reason why it
should not be used. Mr. DeLoach informed the Acting Attorney
General if he felt this way he should put these views in writing,
since the FBI could not afford to be criticized on one hand and then
on the other hand be directed by the Departmentrto enter into such
procedures. The Acting Attorney General, upon a moment's
reflection, stated that in view of the "psychological situation" he
probably svould not put this request in writing and perhaps would
inform the Organized Crime Section of the Department not to
request the FBI to utilize this device. We have since received no
such request from the Acting Attorney General.

staff averages more than two-and one-half hours each workday
and during fiscal year 1968 totaled 3,845,461 hours, the equiva-
lent of 1,849 additional employees on a full-year basis. This was
a cosi-free saving to the Government of over $14 million,

revolutionary movement of students and young intellectuals.
New Leftists from U. S. have played important roles in demon-
strationsin foreign countries.

Racial Unrest on College Campuses Campuses throughout U. S.
have been marked by racial unrest. Minority groups such as
Black Student Union becoming increasingly militant and violent.
Demdnds unreasonable. Other militant groups have joined in
demonstrations and offer full support to minority groups.

‘Black Panther Party is most active, notorious and violence-prone
black extremist group. Branches in 25 cities. Will possibly go
underground. Minister of Education is George Mason Murray, 2
suspended instructor at San Francisco State College.

Soviet and Satellite Espionage The U. S. is the number one
espionage target of Soviet Union and satellites. Intelligence
operations coordinated by Soviet Union. Embassies and missions
are focal points. As of February, 1969, approximately 230 Soviet
and 117 satellite personnel operating. Consular Convention
between U. S. and Soviet Union became effective July 13, 1968,
and will probably increase capability for espionage.

SPECIAL INVESTIGATIVE OPERATIONS

Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs (BINDD) Since the Bureau
of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs (BNDD) was formed under the
jurisdiction of the Department, the-FBI has been conducting back-
ground investigations on its applicants and employees. This was
done pursuant to Departmental Order #175-59, dated 4-1-59.
However, the BNDD was discovered to be conducting some dupli-
cate investigation of their clerical applicants. We objected to this
wasted effort and expressed our views to the Department which ~
countered with a proposal advanced by Associate BNDD Director
Giordano, that we share parts of these investigations with them.

By letter of 2-6-69, in reply to this proposal, we informed the
Department that no additional requests for BNDD applicant investiga-
tions would be accepted, except those submitted under the :
provisions of the Federal Employee Security Program.

Martin Edward Underwood Underwood, an employee of the
Department of Commerce, who was detailed to the White House in
1966 to serve as an advance man for former President Johnson,
was removed from his office at the White House on 2-6-69, and the
Department of Commerce has been instructed to inform him that
his services are no longer required. Our investigation of Underwood,
which was furnished the White House on 2-12-69, disclose that he
had severe drinking problem until at least 1964.

- c
Virginia Stanfill Savell We conducted a discreet inquiry of Savell
in September, 1966, at the request of former Senator Kuchel (R)
of Califernia, for whom she then worked in his Los Angeles office.
It had been alleged she was operating a bookie joint out of the
Senator's office but our inquiry developed no information to sub-
stantiate this. However, it was reported that she was an alcoholic.
Current investigation revealed Savel attempted to commit suicide
in July, 1967, by overdose of sleeping pills.

Donald Edward Ganoung We have investigated Ganoung as a
Departmental applicant for the position of consultant with the Law
Enforcement Administration at Washington, D. C., the position
he now holds. He has a degree iti criminology and is a former
Episcopalian priest who has worked among deviate elements. He
has also been active in civil rights and antidraft demonstrations
and twice was arrested in this connection. Divorced by his wife
in 1967 after he had an affair with another woman, Ganoung also

[kiwi The results of our investigation of him
were furnished to the Attorney General on 2/11/69,

William Henry Rentschler Rentschler, a candy company operator,
has been extremely active in Illinois Republican Party politics. He
carried on a notorious adulterous relationship which led to a divorce
from a former wife. Our investigation of him revealed many
prominent persons who would not recommend Rentschler for a
position with the Government in view of his moral weaknesses and
reported lack of business acumen. Our investigation not yet com-
plete but summary memo furnished the White House on 2/10/69. -

Special Inquiry Investigations for the White House Security officers

of various Government agencies have expressed shock at the lack

of knowledge or the total disregard of the provisions of the Federal
Employee Security Program by the White House staff responsible

for filling top-level positions with the new Administration. Most
requests for investigation have been of persons already firmly estab-
lished in their new jobs. When derogatory data is developed it is
simply requested that the investigation be continued. Only one person
is known to have been discharged as a result of derogatory information
developed during investigation. Don Virdin, Internal Revenue Service
(IRS), called Bureau 2/13/69 and indicated Bureau had checked through
IRS only 8 of last 25 publicly announced Presidential appointees.
Bureau has run checks of IRS on all requests received from White
House on Presidential appointees and it would appear White House
only asked for 8 of last 25 to be checked. :

Selective Service These cases in recent years have broadened in
Scope with recurring schemes to obstruct the draft. We have 14, 000
pending investigations, up 5,000 from a year ago. Fiscal year 1968
produced 809 convictions and the first seven months of this fiscal
period have recorded 380 convictions, an increase over this period -
a year ago. An interesting case is summarized which involves an
18~year-old Californian whose mother, following his arraignment
for failure to register for the draft, attempted to get a Restraining
Order by contending that she was responsible for her son's actions

NW 65360_Docld:32989646 Page 893



and therefore should be punished rather than him. The Judge
rejected her appeal and her son's trial is scheduled for March,
1969.

Criminal Intelligence and Organized Crime While our

organized crime investigations are aimed at key members in the
power structure, they have also struck hard in the lower echelons
with progressively greater penetration into the heart of hoodlum
activities - gambling operations. Fiscal year 1968 capped four
consecutive record years in convictions of organized crime figures
with 281, There are now 789 other hoodlum figures awaiting trial
in Federal court thus indicating a continuance of the upward trend
in convictions in fiscal year 1969. Recent major accomplishments
in the organized crime field include the arrest or conviction of
many top La Cosa Nostra leaders across the country. Our dissem-
ination of criminal intelligence data to other Federal and local law
enforcement agencies has broken the million mark in number of
items in the past five years. This shared FBI data enabled other
law enforcement agencies to conduct hundreds of raids, execute
thousands of arrests, and recover millions of dollars in gambling
funds or stolen property each year. Department Task Force
Operations (also called Strike Force) have been formed in Detroit,
Michigan; Brooklyn, New York; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania;
Chicago, Illinois; Miami, Florida; and Newark, New Jersey; since
the original group at Buffalo, New York. We now maintain liaison
with these Task Force groups and it has been recommended that
we expand our liaison arrangements with Task Force. There have
been La Cosa Nostra leadership clanges in New York and Chicago.

Department's Manual for use of Electronic Surveillance Under Title

TH of Omnibus Crime Control Bill Attorney General has been fur-

nished our views regarding Department's draft manual for use of
electrical surveillance pursuant to Title I bf Omnibus Crime Control
Bill, the general provisions of which concern administrative regulations
not specifically required by the statute itself. The manual's requirements
would impose tremendous administrative and procedural restrictions

on the FBI and other Federal agencies to the point that strictcompliance
might be self-defeating to the goal of maintaining discreet electronic

Bbwvsszco_nocid:3200966 Page sod



surveillance coverage under court supervision for the purpose of
obtaining admissible evidence against the leadership of organized
crime and in other major investigative categories. Included would
be requirements for review of an application for a court order at a
number of levels within the Department, and by the Attorney General,
before the application reached the judge, involving delay and the
spreading of information about our use of this technique among a
comparatively wide range of authorities. Included in our views

was our belief that for the Government's ultimate success in making
use of this evidence gathering procedure, restrictions must not apply
which will create more limitations on law enforcement than the statute
itself prescribes.

The overtime service by our investigative staff
averages more than two and one-half hours each workday and
during the fiscal year 1968 totaled 3,845,461 hours, the equiva-
lent of 1,849 additional employees on a full-year basis. Taking
into consideration the limited extent to which this overtime was
compensated under fringe benefits regulations of the Civil Service
Commission, there was a cost-free saving to the Government of
over $14 million when compared to the value of the total overtime

_performed. This is a tremendous voluntary contribution by our
investigative staff.

National Crime

While preliminary crime figures for calendar year
1968 are not yet available, for the period January through
September, 1968, over the same period in 1967, the Crime Index
nationwide recorded a 19 percent increase. The largest increases

_ were noted in cities 250,000 to 1 million population where a 22

percent rise was recorded. Nationally, the violent crimes of
murder, forcible rape, robbery and aggravated assault as a group
increased 21 percent and the more voluminous property crimes of
burglary, larceny $50 and over and auto theft rose 19 percent. There
were an estimated 4.6 million serious crimes in the United States
in 1968 compared to 3.8 million in 1967,

National Crime Information Center (NCIC)

NCIC is a nationwide. index of documented law
enforcement information on crime and criminals. Its objective
is to improve the effectiveness of law enforcement through the
more efficient handling and exchange of information. In January,
1967, a pilot operation was begun with terminals in 15 local and
state law enforcement agencies. NCIC now has 78 control termi-
nals in 47 states, the District of Columbia and Canada. North
Carolina and Wyoming will be added in the near future; however,
Alaska will be delayed due to very high communication circuit
- costs. The files consist of stolen motor vehicles, license plates,
firearms, other identifiable stolen property including securities,
and wanted persons. Over 780,000 records are in the system and
more than 33,000 messages are handled each day. Positive
responses to inquiries wherein a record is furnished now exceed
220 each 24 hours. NCIC is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a
week. :

New Left Movement

The New Left movement, an amorphous, undisciplined
collection of malcontents, has led a.wave of aytramion on aes
college campuses which has been marked by growing violence and
lawlessness. During the past year a surge of bombings and
arsons, along lines advocated. by New Left extremists, has
accounted for over $2,000,000 in damages to property consisting
mostly of college facilities and.U. S. Government property...
The New Left movement in this country is clearly an integral :
part of a worldwide revolutionary movement of students and -
young intellectuals, New Leftists from the United States have Fy
played an important role in demonstrations Which have taken . |
place in England, France, West Germany, Japan,, and Mexico.
They have established and maintained contacts with representa-=
‘tives of communist and other leftist organizations abroad
through meetings, conferences, and correspondence}. traveling
to communist countries, such as Cuba, Czechoslovakia, Hungary,

- .North Vietnam, and the Soviet Union.

Racial Unrest on College Campuses

‘Campuses throughout the United States have been
marked by racial unrest as exemplified by the current disrup-
tions at San Francisco State College, San Francisco, California;
and the University of California, Berkeley, California. Such
groups as the Third World Liberation Front, a coalition of
minority groups, and the Black Student Union are becoming
increasingly militant and violence prone in presenting their
demands to college authorities, Demands made by such groups
include the establishment of a separate college for minority
groups, particularly Negroes; the establishment of black
courses; the hiring of minority group professors and adminis-
trators; and the control of hiring and firing of faculty mem~
bers by students. At San Francisco State College over 400
individuals have been arrested during a current wave of dis-
ruption and attempts are being made to force the College to
close, Students for a Democratic Society and other militant
groups have joined in these demonstrations and offer full
support to minority groups.

Black Panther Party

The Black Panther Party is the most active,
notorious, violence=prone black extremist organization, In
the past nine months it has established branches in 25 cities
across the country with a hard-core membership of at least 1,200.

The latest development is the order from national
headquarters to stop recruiting for a time in order to weed
out informants and undesirables and concentrate on political
indoctrination based on the writings of MAO Tse-tung of Com-
munist China, There is also increasing discussion of the
necessity for going underground.

: The Black Panther Party Minister of Education
George Mason Murray, a suspended instructor at San Francisco
State College, holds a position oti the Central Committee of:
the Black Student Union at that College. The Black Student 7
Union instigated the campus unrest which has iaihaiaal this i
institution during the current school year,

Soviet and Satellite Espionage

The United States is the number one espionage
target of the Soviet Union and its European satellites
(Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, and Romania). l
The intelligence operations of these satellites are coordinated ‘

against the United States by the Soviets, The embassies of
these countries in Washington and their missions ‘to the
United Hations in New York are focal points for their espionage
activities. /5 of February, 1969,- there were approximately
230 Soviet pe sonnel and 117 satellite personnel with intel~-
ligence assi: aments operating out of their respective official
establishmer ‘s. 7 eat
a {I .s represents since February, 1959, a 210%
increase in Joviet intelligence personnel and a 100% increase
in satellite intelligence personnel,

A Consular Convention between the United States
and the Soviet Union became effective July 13, 1968. This
would grant diplonatic immunity from criminal jurisdiction
for Soviet Consular personnel in the United States and
_United States Consular personnel in the Soviet Union. On
August 13, 1968, the Soviet Foreign Ministry proposed :
ectablircament cf a Ecviet Consulate Genersl at San Francisce,
California, in return for a United States Consulate General
in Leninerad. There has been no progress in negotiations
regarding .establishment of Consulates since last August.
Establishment of a Soviet Consulate in San Francisco will

Assassination of President John Fitzgerald Kennedy

The essence of the.Clay Shaw trial in New Orleans
lies in the connection New Orleans District Attovhey. James C.
Garrison is attempting to establish between Lee Harvey Oswald,
David Ferrie (now deceased), and Clay Shaw. The principal
witness has been Perry Russo who has said Oswaid, Ferrie,
and Shaw discussed assassinating President Kennedy at a
meeting in Ferrie's apartment in New Orleans in September,
1963,

Immediately following the assassination of President
Kennedy, the FBI received allegations of a connection between
Ferrie and Oswald. Th se allegations were thoroughly and
exhaustiveiy invesi. No evidence was ever develoved
that Oswald and Ferrie were acquainted. Clay Shaw's name
never came up in the investigation and the FBI never
investigated him, ;

: The FBI has held to a “hands-off" policy regarding
Garrison's investigation, Although we are closely following
Shaw's trial, we have no observers in the courtroom, It is
noted that the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice
has an unofficial observer in the courtroom,

Garrison's mental stability is questionable. He
received a medical discharge in October, 1951, from the U. 8,
Army for an emotional problem. He admitted to Army authorities
that he had received psychiatric treatment. Garrison was a
Special Agent of the FBI for four months, resigning to
Penwenter military Service in July, 1951,

‘ “ GEN RAL INVESTIGATIVE OPERATIONS
: SUGGESTIONS FOR THE
REDUCTION OF CRIME IN
THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA

In connection with the juvenile problem in the District of
Columbia, it is suggested that an Enabling Statute be passed which
would allow juveniles to be handled in the District of Columbia as they
are throughout the United States; publicize the names of the juveniles
involved in serious crimes and maintain and make available juvenile
records to law enforcement agencies. In areas of high crime,
improved street lighting should be installed.

Mandatory sentences are recommended for crimes
committed with the use of firearms or involving thréats, anda
habitual criminal statute might be effective. Consideration could be
given to the registration of all convicted felons in the District, as
well as a law requiring registration of firearms.

Authorities responsible for allowing prisoners to be
released under the "Work Release Program" should thoroughly
consider their prior records so that vicious felons will not be returned
to the streets. In addition, prosecutors should not accept guilty pleas
on one count while dismissing other counts; and abolition of capital
punishment should be opposed until a life sentence means "life."'

As.a deterrent to bank robberies, District banks should
on a voluntary basis accelerate the implementation of the provisions
of the Bank Protection Act of 1968, and consideration should be given
to the deployment of one police officer and a bank guard to selected
institutions.

More stringent penalties should be invoked for violations
of gambling laws, and sentences should be made stiffer for second
+ offenders. :

ASSASSINATION OF MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.

The entire facilities of the FBI were committed
to the investigation of the assassination of Martin Luther
King, Jr., in Memphis, Tennessee, on 4-4-68, and within
five days the man then known as Eric S, Galt was developed
as a prime suspect, From a check of latent fingerprints
against those of white male fugitives for whom "wanted"
notices had been placed in the files of the FBI Identification
Division, James Earl Ray was determined to be the true
identity of Eric S, Galt. At the request of the FBI, Canadian
authorities determined that a Canadian passport had been
issued to Ray in the name of Ramon George Sneyd, and on
June 8, 1968, Ray was arrested by Scotland yard when he
presented the Sneyd passport to travel from London to
Brussels, At the conclusion of extradition proceedings,
Ray was returned to the United States in custody of FBI Agents
and was turned over to local authorities in Memphis, Tennessee,
| for state prosecution, Local trial is scheduled for April 7,
1969,

We were instructed by former Assistant Attorney
General Vinson to interview the Chairmen and Treasurers of
20 Republican Committees and one Democratic Committee that
filed late reports with the Clerk of the House.of Represen-
tatives. There have been some delays in obtaining necessary |

RUTH EISEMANN-SCHIER;
BARBARA JANE MACKLE - VICTIM
KIDNAPING

On December 17, 1968, 20-year-old Barbara Jane Mackle
was abducted from an Atlanta, Georgia, area motel. A $500, 000
ransom demand was subsequently made of her father, Robert Mackle,
a Coral Gables, Florida, resident and business official. FBI
investigation resulted in the safe return of Miss Mackle, who had
been buried in a coffin-like box northeast of Atlanta, Georgia; the
recovery of most of the ransom money; and the apprehension of one-
of the subjects, identified as Gary Steven Krist. An all-out investi-
gation continues to locate Ruth Eisemann-Schier, the other subject ~
in this case. Federal charges were filed in Miami, Florida, against
subjects for violation of Extortion Statute, Interstate Transportation
in Aid of Racketeering Statute, and the Aiding and Abetting Statute.
The subjects were indicted in DeKalb County, Georgia, for kidnaping
on January 13, 1969. ‘The Bureau has furnished results of its
investigations to local authorities and is cooperating in the state
trial which will be held in this matter, Krist was brought before the
circuit court in DeKalb County, Georgia, on February 7, 1969, at
which time the court appointed two attorneys to represent him. One
of the attorneys is James R, Venable, who has been for many years
Imperial Wizard for the National Knights of.the Ku Klux Klan, Inc.
A three-week delay was requested by the attorneys, and the judge set
‘the next appearance for February 28, 1969. -

SPECIAL INVESTIGATIVE OPERATIONS
DISCONTINUANCE OF BACKGROUND
INVESTIGATIONS ON CLERICAL
APPLICANTS FOR THE BUREAU OF
NARCOTICS AND DANGEROUS DRUGS
(BNDD)

The Bureau has been conducting background
investigations on applicants and employees of the BNDD
since that agency came under the jurisdiction of the
Department. These investigations were conducted pursuant
to Departmental Order #175-59 dated April 1, 1959.

Our Chicago Division learned that BNDD had been
conducting preemployment checks to include credit and
criminal investigation, interviews with former employers,
supervisors, and references. On January 21, 1969, both
Assistant Attorney General for Administration Pellerzi
and Associate Director Giordano, BNDD, agreed with the
Bureau's position that conducting duplicate investigations
of clerical applicants for BNDD was a waste of time and
money; however, on February 4, 1969, Mr. Giordano reversed
his position and stated he wanted to run credit and
criminal checks and contact the last two employers to
see if they had any further interest in the clerical applicant.
| The Bureau would then be asked to complete the investigation, -
Mr. Giordano was told that BNDD should do their own clerical
applicant investigations entirely or the FBI should do
them entirely. The Director noted that he wanted no part
of divided responsibility and this positdon was confirmed
in our letter to Mr, Pellerzi dated February 6, 1969,
copy attached. This letter advised that effective
immediately we would not accept any additional requests for
investigations of clerical applicants and that, if during
the course of investigations of these people by BNDD, 7
they should find subversive derogatory information, then
the case should be referred to the Bureau for a full field
investigation under the provisions of the Federal Employee
Security Program.

Since February 6, 1969, we have not accepted
any requests for investigation of clerical people for BNDD.

MARTIN EDWARD UNDERWOOD

Underwood, aged 54, was employed for a number of
years as a salesman in Illinois and Maryland. Since 1961 he
has been employed by the United States Government, for the’
greater period by the Department of Commerce, and the Small
Business Administration. He was detailed to the White House
in 1966 as an advance man in connection with the travels of
former President Johnson,

“We conducted an investigation of Underwood for the
White House in 1965 which revealed he had a serious drinking
problem prior to the investigation and was considered an
alcoholic at one time. He is unmarried and has had two divorces,
the first of which was precipitated by his drinking. Several
people interviewed in the 1965 investigation would not recom-
mend Underwood because of his drinking on the West Coast in
1964, After President Johnson's departure Underwood continued
to hold an office on the first floor of the Executive Office
Building, apparently gaining the favor of Vice President Agnew.
On February 6, 1969, Underwood was removed from his office
and his White House pass has been taken. The White House
has been in contact with the Department of Commerce, ‘on whose
payroll Underwood has been while working at the White House,
and advised the Department of Commerce to inform Underwood
his services are no longer requiréd.

Persons interviewed during our current investigation
state Underwood apparently stopped drinking in 1964 and no
longer has the drinking problem. Results of current investigation
were furnished White House in memorandum dated February 12, 1969.
Several interviews and one agency check remain to be handled.



VIRGINIA STANFILL SAVELL

She was employed by former United States Senator
Thomas H. Kuchel of California in his Los Angeles, California,
office from August, 1961, to September, 1968. She is pres-
ently an assistant to Herbert G. Klein at the White House.

In September, 1966, at the request of
! Senator Kuchel, a very discreet inquiry was conducted
into an allegation Senator Kuchel had received that
Mrs. Savell was possibly operating a bookie joint out
of the Senator's Los Angeles, California, office. The
inquiry developed no information to substantiate the
allegation, The investigation did develop information
that Mrs. Savell reportedly was an alcoholic.

“The current investigation tc date has ascertained
that the South Pasadena, California, Police Department
records indicate Mrs. Savell attempted suicide on July 23,
1967. She reportedly took an overdose of sleeping capsules.

- WILLIAM HENRY RENTSCHLER

William Henry Rentschler, aged 43, former news~-
‘paper reporter, has been co-owner and/or President ofa
candy company since 1956, He has been extremely active in
Republican Party politics in Illinois for the past several
years. He was involved in adulterous relationship with a
woman other than. his wife for approximately three years and
later married that woman. This was a well known fact by
those interviewed and Senator Dirksen said his involvement
in notorious divorce action présents serious. question of
his suitability for employment by the Government. Senator
Percy indicated Attorney General Mitchell recently told
him Senator Dirksen had indicated Rentschler could not pass
the rigid background investigation by the FBI. During the
investigation Rentschler was described as articulate and an
intelligent individual who is knowledgeable in the field of
politics. Several persons pointed out he lacks business
ability, fails to follow through on details and does not have
a feeling for finances. Some individuals did not recommend
him for a position of trust, some recommended him with reser-
vations, and some recommended him highly. A summary memorandum
containing the results of investigation to date was furnished
to the White House on February 10, 1969, Outstanding investi-
gation consisted of an interview of Maurice H, Stans, Secre-
tary of Commerce, and several other individuals who have
been unavailable for contact. Secretary Stans has been inter~
viewed and states he cannot recommend Rentschler due to un-
favorable hearsay information concerning his alleged financial
irresponsibility and his moral life, Additional investigation
is necessary based on information furnished by Secretary Stans.

SPECIAL INQUIRY INVESTIGATIONS FOR THE WHITE HOUSE

Conscientious security officers in various
governmental agencies, many of whom are former Special
Agents of the Bureau, have been shocked at the lack of
knowledge or the total disregard of the provisions of the
Federal Employee. Security Program by the eight or nine
individuals at the White House responsible for filling
top-level positions in the new Administration, This
first came to our. attention shortly after November 6,
1968, when Franklin Benjamin Lincoln, Jr., and
William Rittenhouse Harman moved: into the Pentagon
as the vanguard of the transition team, They had no
clearance for highly classified information and when
no request was forthcoming for a full field investiga-
tion of these persons, the security officer at the
Pentagon requested the investigation.:

This matter came to a head on February 10, 1969,
when the Secretary of Commerce was told by the White House
to write a letter certifying that prospective Assistant
Secretaries were cleared politically and from a security
standpoint, When the Department of Commerce was told we
had received no request for a full field investigation,
that Department was informed by the White House the FBI

|. had done a “24-hour check," The Department of Commerce
would not accept this since the Federal Employee Security
Program requires that no critical sensitive jobs should be
filled unless a full field investigation is first conducted,

Most of the requests for investigations received

- thus far from the White House are in connection with persons
who have been publicly announced and are already firmly
established in their jobs, As a result, instead of dis-
continuing investigation upon the development of derogatory
data the White House requests the investigation be continued
and at the present time we know of only one person the
Administration has discharged. This was a stenographer
in Mr. Ehrlichman's office by the name of Helen Galanoplos,
who had two brothers and a sister-in-law who were members
of the Communist Party.

In connection with White House investigations Don Virdin
of Internal Revenue Service (IRS) called the Bureau on February 13,
1969. Virdin stated that IRS had checked their files in connection with

1g
Liwiss360_Nocld:3298966 Pagesis



it

pane

the last 25 persons publicly announced and confirmed by the Senate.
He stated that this check revealed that the Bureau had only asked for

- IRS information in connection with about 8 of these 25 people. He

stated he felt this was strange because there was some rather inter-
esting information in connection with some of these people, such as
the fact that one of these individuals, whom he did not identify, had
not filed an income tax return for the past three years. (We have
run checks on all requests received from the White House on
Presidential appointees and it would appear from the above that the
White House only asked for us to conduct investigations on 8 of the
last 25 publicly announced appointees. )

SELECTIVE SERVICE

Selective Service investigations conducted by the
Federal Bureau of Investigation in recent years have
broadened to cope with recurring schemes to obstruct the
draft. At the present time, we have slightly over 14,000
pending investigations, compared to 9,000 a year ago.

In fiscal.year 1968, 809 convictions were recorded
as compared to 763 convictions the previous fiscal year.
For the first seven months of fiscal year 1969, 380 convictions
were recorded compared to 374 convictions recorded for a
similar period in the preceding fiscal year. It appears
that such a trend will continue during the current fiscal
year.

There follows a brief summary of an investigation
of interest concerning a Selective Service matter. |

At San Francisco in October 1968, it was learned
Erik Alfred Whitehorn, aged 18, had not registered with
Selective Service because his mother, Evelyn Whitehorn,
had refused to grant permission. For his failing to register,
Whitehorn was indicted, on November 20, 1968,

Following arraignment and release on his own
recognizance, a Complaint and Petition for Injunction and
Temporary Restraining Order against registration for the
draft was filed in behalf of the subject. It claims if a person
under 21 years of age cannot vote, contro] or dispose of
his own property, serve on juries, marry, contract or litigate,
then he cannot register for the draft without his parents'
consent. Therefore, the mother, by teaching her son
principles of morality and by influencing him to follow his
own conseience, bears the main responsibility and should
be punished instead of her son. The Judge hearing this
case ruled that the son must stand trial for refusing -to
register for the draft and rejected the mother's appeals.

A date for the trial of Erik Whitehorn has been
scheduled for March 19, 1969.

CRIMINAL INTELLIGENCE
AND ORGANIZED CRIME

The main thrust of our investigations of organized
crime has been aimed at the key members in the power structure
of La Cosa Nostra in order to secure their imprisonment and
to disrupt leadership. We have also struck hard at the lower
working level who are the money producing figures for the
top echelon leaders. With progressively greater success, we
have made deeper penetration into the heart of the hoodlum
syndicate, the illegal gambling operations from which it
draws much of its vast resources.

Prosecutions of hoodlums, gamblers, and vice figures
for violating the laws within the Buréau's jurisdiction
have been steadily increasing. For the fourth consecutive
year, convictions have reached new highs, as evidenced by the
fact that during Fiscal Year 1968, our drive against organized
crime resulted in the conviction of 281 organized crime and
gambling figures, compared with the 197 convictions during
the preceding year. In addition, there are now 789 other
individuals awaiting trial in Federal court. The substantial
backlog of individuals awaiting further prosecution indicates
that the upward trend of convictions will continue during
Fiscal Year 1969. However, it is apparent that if we are to
continue to be effective in our drive against the hoodlum
element, prosecutions of these matters must necessarily receive
high priority.

Recent Major Accomplishments

Among our most recent major accomplishments are:

- the conviction of Ernest Sansone, Chicago Hoodlum, and five
associates on February 12, 1969, in connection with a wide-
spread race wire dissemination service; the arrest of John
Philip Cerone, current top leader of organized crime in the
Chicago area, along with two accomplices on February 7, 1969,
in connection with the operation of a large-scale gambling
organization; the conviction of West Coast hoodlum figure,
John Roselli, on February 3, 1969, for running an interstate
gambling operation; the conviction of William Daddano, des-
eribed as the 5th ranking mobster in Chicago, and four



accomplices on October 3, 1968, for bank robbery; the arrest

on November 26, 1968, of La CosaNostra “commission™ member
Stefano Magaddino, and eight associates.for Interstate Gambling
Activity; the arrest on December 5, 1968, of Pittston, Pa.,

La Cosa Nostra "Boss" Russell Bufalino and two associates for
conspiring to transport some $23,000 worth of stolen television
sets interstate; the September 12, 1968, conviction of

New Orleans La Cosa Nostra "boss" Carlos Marcello for attempting
to assault a Federal officer; the March 21, 1968, arrest of

New Jersey La Cosa Nostra “boss" Samuel Rizzo, Decavalcante and
two associates for conspiring to extort money from four gamblers,
and the conviction on March 8, 1968, of New England area

La Cosa Nostra chieftain Raymond Patriarca and one of his
“captains;' Henry Tameleo, for violating the Anti-~Racketeering
statute in connection with a gambling-murder case.

Dissemination Program :

As a result of our dissemination program, 287,004
items of criminal intelligence “type informationwere dissem-
inated to other Federal, State,.and local law enforcement
agencies during Fiscal Year 1967, 300,244 such items were
disseminated in Fiscal Year 1968, and during the first six
months of the present Fiscal Year we have disseminated 153,214
items. Over one million such items have been disseminated
during the past five years.

With respect to dissemination of information
concerning local gambling operations to other Federal,
State, and local law enforcement agencies throughout the
United States for Fiscal Year 1968, a total of 721 raids
took place; 3751 individuals were arrested of whom 1170 were
convicted; paraphernalia seized amounted to $1,395,069 and
United States currency confiscated amounted to $624,028. In
the first six months of the present Fiscal Year 329 raids
have taken place, 1787 individuals have been arrested, of
whom 771 have been convictéd; paraphernalia seized amounted
to $221,021, and United States currency confiscated amounted
to $273,701. eet

Department of Justice Task Forces on Organized Crime

.

In the Fall of 1966, the Criminal Division of the
Department initiated the: Task Force Operation (also called
Strike Force) and the first one began operation in Buffalo,
New York. These Task Forces consisted of a group comprised

NW 65360 Docld:32989646 Page 919



N'

of Departmental attorneys and investigative personnel from
several different Federal investigative agencies. The FBI
was invited to assign personnel but declined because of its
overall commitments requiring utilization of all of its
Agents, However, we have extended complete cooperation in
the form of information in investigative reports and have
promptly handled all cases within our investigative juris-
diction that were referred to us from the Task Forces.

Since the initial Task Force at Buffalo, the Depart-
ment has formed such groups in Detroit, Michigan; Brookiyn,
New York; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Chicago, Illinois;
Miami, Florida; and Newark, New Jersey.

We now maintain liaison with the various Task
Forces but not on a full-time basis.

It has been recommended that (1) we continue to
cooperate on a full-time basis, from the standpoint of
furnishing information to the various Task Forces, (2) that
the Director indicate to the new Attorney General that we-

Will be happy to assign an FBI Inspector to serve as liaison
with the Department Task Force office in Washington, D. C.,

(3) that a supervisory employee would be assigned by each

SAC to a specific Task Force when such Task Force is established
within a given area where one of our field offices is located,
for liaison purposes.

La Cosa Nostra Leadership Changes

In the New York City area where La Cosa Nostra
"Commission" member Thomas Luchese died during 1967, no
successor has been named to date, primarily because the FBI
was responsible for the arrest and/or conviction of the four
leading contenders, all "captains" or ranking members of the
Luchese "family." : i

In Chicago,. John Philip Cerone, who was being groomed
as the top leader of La Cosa Nostra group in the Chicago area,
was arrested on February 7, 1969, for Interstate Gambling
Activities, Cerone was the interim Chicagd leader for Sam
Giancana, who fled to Latin America following his release from
Federal prison and his successor, Sam Battaglia, who is in
Federal prison for violating the Anti-Racketeering Act.

In New York, veteran New York hoodlum Paul Sciacca
presently is the “boss" of a New York-.City La Cosa Nostra
"family" once headed by the notorious, controversial Joseph
Bonanno, .

DEPARTMENT'S MANUAL FOR USE OF ELECTRONIC
SURVEILLANCE UNDER TITLE III OF OMNIBUS
CRIME CONTROL BILL

“The Attorney General has been furnished our views

with regard to the Department's draft manual for use of electronic
surveillance pursuant to Title III, The general provisions of
this lengthy manual, much of which concerned administrative
regulations not specifically required by the statute itself,
would impose tremendous administrative and procedural restrictions
on the FBI and other Federal agencies to the point that strict
compliance might be self-defeating to the goal of maintaining
discreet electronic surveillance coverage under court supervision
for the purpose of obtaining admissible evidence against the
leadership of organized crime and in other major investigative
categories, These requirements involve an investigative agent's
application for intercept authority to be reviewed by a
comparatively wide range of authorities including the Organized
Crime and Racketeering Section of the Department, in many cases
the United States Attorney, the Assistant Attorney General,
Criminal Division, and finally the Attorney General before the
request even reached the court which, according.to the provisions
of this statute, is the ultimate authority and control in ‘the

use of this procedure. This process would, of necessity, be
. time-consuming, cumbersome, and, at certain points, repetitious,
and would spread the knowledge of the use of this technique

among a number of different governmental offices.

We noted that the draft manual made repeated reference

to the problem of probable cause becoming "stale" and observed
that the sheer weight of the deliberative process at various
approving levels before it even reached the judge could alone
result in the probable cause becoming "“stale.'' We also noted

. that requirements involving daily memoranda to the United States.
Attorney concerning the progress of a court authorized surveillance
and other similar administrative requirements would tend to place
burdens on investigating agents’ which could detract from the
ultimate purpose of our use of this technique.

In connection with the manual*s requirement that
an authorized surveillance be terminated when the subject of

the surveitlance departed the premises covered, we questioned
that such a requirement was called for in the statute and whether

~ 24 -

NW 65360 Docld:32989646, Page 921



Congress, in providing this important added tool in the
evidence gathering process, intended that such a restriction
applied. We also noted that the draft suggested that in all
cases when an application for an order is denied, those named
in the application would be informed that the Government
intended to subject them to electronic surveillance, With
regard to denied applications, we contend that this notice
requirement pertains only to those situations where emergency
intercepts have been made without court order, and thereafter
the court has denied the application and not. to all applications
which might be denied in the normal course of buSiness pursuant
to the main body of regulations in Title III..

We concluded our observations to the Attorney
General that while it was appreciated that the drafting of
guidelines in this matter presents extremely sensitive problems,
it was believed that for the Government*s ultimate success in
making use of this evidence gathering procedure, restrictions
must not apply which will create more limitations on law
enforcenent than the statute itself prescribes,

Source stated that the Soviet occupation has
split the peace movement, and WSP in particular, that it
might be better to postpone the invitation temporarily,

UTEKHINA told source that all expenses would
be paid while in the Soviet Union. However, the delegates
probably would have to arrange to pay their round trip air
fare from the United States to Moscow, USSR, and return,
The group would leave from New York City or Montreal,
Canada, UTEKHINA stated it may be possible to fl} the
group via Soviet commercial craft in which case the cost
of transportaiion might be borne by the Soviets,"

Source’ dis¢ussed UTEKHINA's proposed with WSP
leaders and it was agreed to bring this matter up at a
Regional Conference of WSP which is being held in early
October, 1968, with the idea of sending the delegation
to the Soviet Union late in October or early November.

Source advised UTEKHINA that SARAH
SHORESMAN en the West Coast, who is in charge of the WSP
International Clearing House, would be in charge of making
arrangements for the trip, She inquired of UTEKHINA what
the air fare would be, UTEKHINA later telephoned to advise
that a round trip ticket from New York to Moscow, Economy
Tourist Class, is $730. UTEKHINA stated that if the source
is interested, as an individual in going to the Soviet Union,
. she should contact RICHARD MORFORD at the Soviet-American
Friendship Society, 156 5th Avenue, New York City, because
there is a 21 day tour arranged by the National Council !

an invitation from the Committee to send a delegation to the

UTEKHINA, Soviet Embassy, concerning actual dates of travel
and visas. UTEKHINA has indicated that she will have arrange~
ments made and details from Moscow by early next week

leave New York City as soon after the.Presidential election |
as possible. The delegation will travel via Aeroflot or

Pan American World Airways and in either case the round trip
fare will be $548.00, which is the reduced off season rate.

It is recommended that this authority be granted
inasmuch as it is believed that source will learn about

This is another so-called peace conference similar

We sent one of our

New York informants to this conference and received extremely

valuable intelligence information regarding
Situation in South Vietnam as a result. It

equally valuable information. We currently

The attendance of the informant at this conference
can provide invaluable advanced intelligence data concerning
the forthcoming Soviet-directed world-wide peace offensive
against the United States. It will also afford us a live
informant in a behind-the-scenes situation involwing
individuals from all over the world intent upon destroying
the United States position as it pertains to Vietnam, It
will also enable the informant to solidify previous contacts
and to develop new ones among foreign leftist elements. We
should avail ourselves of this excellent opportunity to produce
positive intelligence information.

the advancement of $800 to (WE 1777-S} will be directed to the

(WCP). The SCV, since its inception, has been one of the 7,
major sounding boards for anti-American propaganda in connect ic
with the war in Vietnam. This group has also provided the
North Vietnamese with a propaganda outlet and has enhanced

the position of the North Vietnamese delegation to the Pari or

Memorandum to Mr. C. D. Brennan
Re: Stockholm Conference on Vietnam
100-453546

Washington Field Office has advised that informant
tentatively plans to depart on 11/26/70 in order to reach
Stockholm on 11/27/70 in order to attend a preparatory meeting.

airline schedules, Anticipated expenses are: round trip
air fare at $596.60; registration fee, $20; incidental expenses
including room and board at $158.40.

OBSERVATION:

The extent to which foreign groups, such as the

the United States and their continuing propaganda barrage
aimed at this country make it most desirable that we have
firsthand information regarding future plans of this group,
We will also be in a position to identify other United States
citizens in attendance. For these reasons it is felt we
should avail ourselves of the opportunity to utilize the
informant's services as noted above. An airtel to Washington
Field Office authorizing this informant to travel to Sweden
is attached. Washington Field Office is being instructed
to immediately debrief the informant upon her return and to
obtain an exact accounting of expenses incurred.

BRE Ree

- Mr. F. B. Griffith Bette

- This is to recommend the advancement of $800
over and above the existing expense authorization to
Inroguavt which will enable us to have the benefit of
informant's attendance at the above Congress.

We sent this informant to Moscow, USSR, .in 7 i

November, 1968, to attend a meeting between Women Strike
for Peace (WSP) and the Soviet Women's Committee (SWC).
At that time the SWC representatives siated tme above

. Congress was to be held and that the Vietnam situation
would be the main focus of attention. In the event
hostilities were still going on the SWC said that the
Congress would address itself to "all phases of work to
end the war." In addition, the informant's visit was
very fruitful and we continue to realize berefits from it
through material she receives from contacts made at the
conference.

Informant has been cleared by the steering
committee of the WSP to attend the above Congress and
ean do so without raising any question as to the source

- of funds. Informant has advised that this Congress is
to include delegates from all over the world including
North and South Vietnam, She anticipates traveling with
the leadership of the WSP and that she can renew contacts
previously made with the National Liberation Front, the
North Vietnamese and various Russian women, : oP?

Memorandum to Mr. W. C. Sullivan

RE: WORLD CONGRESS OF WOMEN te
HELSINKI, FINLAND : |
JUNE 14 ~ 17, 1969 ;

This is another so-called peace conference similar
to the one held in Sweden May 16 - 19, 1969. We sent one of our
New York informants to this conference and received extremely
valuable intelligence information regarding the current
situation in South Vietnam as a result. It is probable that
IneozmavT will be in a position through her contacts to furnish
‘equally valuable information. We currently pay ‘weoemar<
up to $200 per month for services and up to $75 per month for
expenses. He

The attendance of the informant at this conference
can provide invaluable advanced intelligence data concerning
the forthcoming Soviet-directed world-wide peace offensive
against the United States. It will also afford us a live
informant in a behind-the-scenes situation involwing
individuals from all over the world intent upon destroying
the United States position as it pertains to Vietnam, It
will also enable the informant to solidify previous contacts
and to develop new ones among foreign leftist elements. We
should avail ourselves of this excellent opportunity to produce
positive intelligence information.

ACTION:
With your approval, “the attached airtel. authorizing

the advancement’ of $800 to twroemanr Will be directed to the
Washington Field Office. oe

BACKGROUND :” ; : en
The SCV was organized in 1967 and is controlled to ee

(wcP). ‘The SCV, since its inception, has been one of the “ff

major sounding boards for anti-American propaganda in connection

North Vietnamese with a propaganda outlet and has enhanced

the position of the North Vietnamese delegation to the Bert i
Peace Talks. SL

7 The forthcoming conference in Stockholm will

propaganda against the United States' position in Vietnam,

It is, therefore,’most desirable we afford these meetings

live informant coverage. Iproetiasr is well established in
the peace movement on a national and international scale

United States and in the Soviet Union. This informant, in

tentatively plans to depart on 11/26/70 in order to reach 7
Stockholm on 11/27/70 in order to attend a preparatory meeting.

airline schedules. Anticipated expenses are: round trip
air fare at $596.60; registration fee, $20; incidental expenses

OBSERVATION:

‘The extent to which foreign groups, such as the
SCV and the WCP, have gone in the recent past to discredit
the United States and their continuing propaganda barrage
aimed at this country make it most desirable that we have
firsthand information regarding future plans of this gronn,
We will also be in a position to identify other United States
citizens in attendance. For these reasons it is felt we
should avail ourselves of the opportunity to utilize the
informant's services as noted above. An airtel to Washington
Field Office authorizing this informant to travel to Sweden
is attached. Washington Field Office is being instructed
to immediately debrief the informant upon her return and .to
obtain an exact accounting of expenses incurred.

‘SUBJECT: ATTORNEY GENERAL'S STAFF CONFERENCE eee
H WEDNESDAY, APRIL 8, 1970, 5:00 P.M. “4A

In accordance with the Director's instructions, I attended the
captioned briefing which was commenced at 5:03 p.m. by the Attorney General who
introduced the Director and the Director thereafter briefed all attendees on the

work of the FBI. As the attendees arrived for the meeting I made available to each
individual the bound FBI exhibit to which they could refer in following the Director's .
presentation. There were 29 departmental representatives present at this staff
meeting. They were very attentive to the Director's ‘presentation as indicated by

the many questions following the Director's discussion. When the Director was
providing the conference with the number of Negroes employed by the FBI, including
Agent and clerical breakdown, Deputy Attorney General Kleindienst interrupted the
Director and asked the Director to repeat these figures in order that he might

record them. i

At approximately 5:25 p.m. the Attorney General left the room to
receive a telephone call. The Director questioned Deputy Attorney General
Kleindienst as to whether he should continue or wait for the Attorney General's .
return. Mr. Kleindienst suggested the Director wait until the Attorney General’ -
returned. {

Mr. Kleindienst asked the Director concerning his references to the
volume of civil rights work - whether this included both civil and criminal investiga-
tions handled by the FBI under the Civil Rights Statutes and the Director replied i
in the affirmative.

.

Mr. Kleindienst then’ referred to the number of organized crime type
cases the Director said are pending prosecutive action. He said are these all
organized crimeindividuals. The Director replied they all have some connection
with the many facets of organized crime. The Director went on to say many of
these cases are pending a year or two and he felt if we had swift prosecution and
substantial punishment a greater inroad could be made in removing the menace of
organized crime. Mr. Kleindienst then commented, that he > felt t that some of the

problem here might be due to the resourcefulness of the organized crime subject's
attorneys. The Director replied that certainly this is true where such shysters

as Edward Bennett Williams represent these characters and he uses every technical
trick to avoid prosecution and conviction. The Director went on to say that Attorney
Kuntsler does the same thing in his field. : :

At this point, Wilson's Deputy, Petersen, of the Criminal Division,
took this opportunity to point out to Kleindienst that what is needed here are more
Assistant United States Attorneys, whereupon the Solicitor General added that
‘Federal judges were also needed. Kleindienst then asked Petersen if he had studied
these cases and the reason for delay that Mr. Hoover referred to and Petersen
stated he did not have these figures at the end of his tongue but he had a survey
made and,as he recalled it, there were 185 of these type cases delinquent six months
‘or more. The others were delayed because of some court motion or action, The
Solicitor General asked whether there was any concentration of these cases and
Petersen said the Southern District of New York. Kleindienst then asked Petersen
how many Assistant United States Attorneys he needed to do the job and Petersen
said he could not give him a figure; however, he said he felt the District of
Columbia's, for example, staff could be increased by half again as many at least
and other appropriate increases would be necessary in major metropolitan

“centers.

Mr. Hoover at this point, pointed out Senate Bill 30 is going to put
the FBI, if passed, into the local gambling picture and that we, in order to fulfill
our responsibility, will probably have to ask for an additional 600 Agents. He
pointed out that he hoped that the Criminal Division would draw up appropriate
guidelines to prevent local authorities from relinquishing their responsibilities
to also investigate local gambling.”

—

At approximately 5:35 p.m., Deputy Attorney General Kleindienst
advised the conference that the Attorney General was called to the White House
and requested ‘the Director/ oceed with the briefing. At approximately 5:55 p.m.,
the Director completed his briefing and was congratulated by the Deputy Attorney
General for the excellent presentation and the Deputy then opened the floor for
questions.

d Memorandum J. J. Casper to Mr. Mohr
Re: Attorney General's Staff Conference
Wednesday, April 8, 1970, 5:00 p.m.

Assistant Attorney General Leo M. Pellerzi, Administrative Division,

referred to the FBI exhibits and in particular Exhibit No. 25 and questioned
Mr. Hoover as to why the State of Virginia had such a high number of Laboratory
examinations. Mr. Hoover explained that Virginia had no Laboratory and that
that was the reason for the high usage of the FBI Laboratory. Mr. Hoover took
this opportunity to explain the FBI's policy in not making our experts available
when local experts have already examined the evidence or are going to testify as to
the evidence. He also explained there are many "phonies" who are traveling about
the country conducting examinations and testifying but we, in these cases, have

’ briefed the prosecuting attorneys in advance. The Director explained that in such
places as New York State where they have their own Laboratories they only: suse
our Lab for the more sophisticated examinations.

Deputy Attorney General Kleindienst then questioned the Director as
to the basic qualifications for the position of Special Agent. The Director explained .
that they all had to be either lawyers or accountants or college graduates majoring
in science or language. The Director emphasized again that we have no discrimina-
tion and that we have many fine Negro Agents in the FBI, pointing out that only last
week he gave a meritorious award to a Negro Agent from our Detroit Office who had
developed valuable informants in the Black Panthers and related organizations in
that area. Kleindienst then asked the Director approximately how many applicants
we turn down for each Agent that we accept. The Director explained that for every
100 applicants 90 of them are turned down: He said that we carefully interview
these men, investigate them, test them, and give them thorough physical examina-
tions to make sure they meet our high standards. The Director told the conference
that he has a standing rule that if any Agent in Charge recommends an Agent or
clerk who is a hippie type; that is, long hair, sideburns, etc., this Agent in Charge
is going to lose his office, and we are going to get rid of the applicant. He said he
would not tolerate any hippie types in the FBI and do not want our Agents going into
Federal court looking like hippies. .

The Director pointed’ out that many of our young clerical employees
are going on to school to become Agents, and he demands the same discipline of
these young people. He also pointed out that some 6,000 people a day tour our
facilities and we don't want them getting the idea the FBI has any hippie types.

As a matter of fact, the Director said with a smile that he would like to declare
open season on these hippies just like you have open season on the deer and shoot

-. them.

: Memorardum 3. J. Casper to Mr. Mohr
Re: Attorney General's Staff Conference
Wednesday, April 8, 1970, 5:00 p.m.

Mr. Kleindienst was also interested in the scope of our work and in
this regard the Director took this opportunity to point out that he did not believe the
FBI should be investigating every bomb threat and that he hoped that if the new bomb
legislation as proposed by the President is passed the Department's Criminal
Division will set appropriate guidelines. The Director pointed out that many of
these major cities have very_excellent bomb squads and they are fully equipped to
handle these complaints. He said why should the FBI be paralleling work done by
competent local authorities. He said, of course, in the local areas where they have
no people qualified, then this is a different matter. The Director said in all of these
cases we are always willing to make our FBI Laboratory facilities and Identification
facilities available as well as assist the local authorities by covering out-of-state
leads.

Assistant Attorney General Johnnie M. Walters asked the Director
if he could see any lessening of the problems that he talked about in the foreseeable
future. The Director said in the organized crime field,if the steps he has
recommended are taken, he feels there will be a decrease. With regard to the
disorders in colleges and in the high schools and caused by the militants he said
this is another story. The Director cited the incident of one of the subjects in the
Chicago Seven trial appearance last night at American University and thereafter
going to Catholic University and then leaving town. He said that apparently these
university administrators will not call in the local police, and he said it was dis-
graceful how they threw rocks, destroyed property and set fires at American
University. He then also cited the incident wherein attorney Kuntsler after he went
out to Santa Barbara, California, gave a speech, and then left town, that Santa
Barbara was the victim of three days of looting and burning. The Director cited
the violence promised in New Haven when Bobby Seale is brought to trial whereupon
the Solicitor General commented that the judge’ who is going to try that case was his
law school roommate. The Director said that this is a very serious situation and
it is entirely possible that violence will occur when Seale is tried. The Director
pointed out that we have appropriately advised all localauthorities of this possibility.

—

The Director then cited the tremendous problems that Judge Hoffman
in Chicago had im handling the trial and said that one could hardly blame him for some
of his actions in view of the provocative acts on the part of the subjects and the
attorneys. The*Director said he recalled that Judge Medina in New York, when he

|triea the Communist Party leaders, the experience was so trying that it actually
broke his health. Peterson at this point injected a comment that his people are

trying to find out whether in the New Haven Bobby Seale case the Panthers are
going to try to kidnap the Department's representative whose name is Lynch or
whether they are referring to the Attorney General of the State of California whose

[name is also Lynch and the Director said he felt it was the Department of Justice
representative being referred to.

The Director took this opportunity speaking about retaliatory action
to point out that he was very concerned over the kidnapping of diplomatic officials
)n South America and said he felt it would be repeated in this country. He hoped
the guard force for the embassies and chanceries in the Nation's Capital would be
promptly secured as the President is also very concerned about this.

In further reply to Mr. Walterg question, the Director also pointed
out that he felt many of these college presidents needed to be more firm and take
. drastic action by expelling these students from the school, not giving them amnesty,
and assisting the local prosecutors in prosecuting these people. ‘The Solicitor
General indicated that he also felt many of the faculty were also/éontributing
factor to this problem. The Director agreed. The Director pointed out that these
student problems in the college or high school can be traced back to the parental
responsibility. The Director said that District of Columbia policemen have told
him that many young children are out on the street at all hours of the night and
their parents don't even know, and in some instances, care where they are. The
Director told them of the incident of where four of our Identification people were
-held up and a female employee raped and how the juvenile giant when arrested had
a juvenile court record of four appearances without a single sentence and how the
Director had requested the court to try him as an adult but they refused to do so.
The Director referred to the fact that we have too many bleeding heart judges
and told of the success Judge Loble has had in Montana in handling juvenile subjects.

Memo J. J. Casper to Mr. M_hr 4/8/70

Re: Attorney General's Staff @onference - 4/8/70 - 5 PM

George J. Reed, Chairman, Board of Parole, questioned Mr. Hoover’

. as to the extent. of Communist influence in all of this New Left, Black Panther,

Students for a Democratic Society, and militant action that we are faced with.
The Director explained that the Communist Party will join anything that will
further its causes and that they get their orders directly from Moscow. He

said their influence in some organizations is complete control and in others

it is only one of participation but, he pointed out,. they are always the most

vocal and, consequently, are very influential in those groups that they participate
in. He said the Black Panthers follow the philosophies of many international ~
revolutionary Communists. The Director then cited the incident of the young
girl who blew up her father’s home in New York which she had turned into a
bomb factory. He stated she started to get out of control when at Bryn Mawr

. She joined the Students for a Democratic Society, and now she has fled to

Canada.and we are unable to extradite her.

At this point Deputy Attorney General Kleindienst thanked Mr. Hoover
for his outstanding presentation. He said he felt they all had a better knowledge
of the FBI and a greater appreciation of the many problems from a security and
crime standpoint facing our country. With that, the official part of the conference
was adjourned. Many of the conferees came up and personally congratulated Mr.
Hoover and thanked him for his presentation, including asking Mr. Hoover to

Tfeel this outstanding presentation on the part of the Director brought
great credit and praise for our organization. Hopefully, it will act as an incentive
to some of our counterparts in the Department to do a more aggressive job
in fulfilling their duties in meeting their security and criminal responsibilities.

\sugect: LUNCHEON WITH ATTORNEY GENERAL G
FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 8, 1967

SYNOPSIS:

Director has accepted Attorney General's luncheon invitation
for Friday, September 8. Pertinent items of possible interest for discussion
at luncheon include: .

(1) The Attorney General (AG) called Mr. DeLoach on 9-5-67 concerning
FBI's pending requests for approval of electronic surveillances. AG said he
had contacted Clark Clifford and Walt Rostow at White House and also planned to
meet with Dick Helms of Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and General Carter
of National Security Agency (NSA). AG said Clifford and Rostow were surprised
FBI had so little coverage--and they hinted that because of FBI reluctance to use
surveillances, it might be good idea to transfer FBI responsibilities in domestic
| | #intelligence to CIA. AG said he was opposed to this idea; that it would take time
to bring Clifford and Rostow around, but FBI would come out ahead andhe (the, .,
AG) would have more liberal hand in approving FBI requests. Lf . va
-- Regarding above, Mr. DelL.oach noted it would be premature to
talk with RostoW or Clifford now; but after a decision has been reached, they
could be confidentially briefed on such FBI operations. Information confidentially
obtained reflects that Helms of CIA had a meeting scheduled with AG on 9-6-67-- ‘
the subject of which probably was electronic surveillances. ; i

(2) On'7- 19+ 67, the House passed H.R. 421, which provides, Federal.
penalties for intdrstate travel with intent to incite a ’ riot. Many persons quéstion |
its practical and legal usefulness due to difficulty in proving intent...Qur sources
on the Hill indicate there is a hope the bill may be bottled up in committee--but™
\ that.it will pass the Senate if it reaches the floor. We took no stand on the bill

with the Department, but did cite examples of interstate travel to areas where

RE: LUNCHEON WITH ATTORNEY GENERAL

(3) .On 8-8-67, the House passed H.R. 5037, the Law Enforcement and:

- Criminal Justice Assistance Act of 1967 (originally the Administration's "Safe
Streets and Crime Control Act"}-but with considerable changes, One amend-
ment to the original Act would empower regional institutes to engage in police
training--thus duplicating and competing with FBI police training. This matter
has been brought to attention of FBI friends on Senate Judiciary Committee.
Our Hill sources advise that Senators McClellan and Hruska plan to combine
their bills regarding controlled use of wiretaps and eavesdropping devices and
add this toH.R, 5037.

(4) AG has indicated desire to achieve about 400 convictions in organized
crime field during this fiscal year. As of 9-7-67, a total of 382 individualsin

this field were awaitin: ution. By le = e called thi
AG's attention toa situation wherein 23 persons arrested in New York for gambling

Fs violations in 1964 were still awaiting final prosecutive action, To date, no

reply has been received from AG.

(5) Latest two issues of "Life" magazine contain articles by Sandy Smith,
former Chicago newsman, focusing attention on La Cosa Nostra leaders, as well
as their political affiliations, and the need for electronic surveillances to cope
with organized crime. Smith has extensive background and contacts qualifying
him to write on organized crime. It is obvious he obtained help from such persons
as Professor Robert Blakey of Notre Dame, formerly in the Organized Crime
Section of Department.

(6) The "task force" organized under direction of Organized Crime and
Racketeering Section of Department conducted an operation against bookmaker
‘Ernest Reinhart in Niagara Falls, New York, area and learned from the Customs
Service that the Niagara Falls Police Department was also interested in Reinhart's
activities, According to officials of Niagara Falls Police Department, attorneys
and others on the "task force" appeared at the police department and "took over"
entire investigation. ''Task force’ was so inept that it "blew" the case against
Reinhart, and "task force" surveillances were discovered by Reinhart and
associates. Although Reinhart'’s gambling activities were across state lines from
New York to Canada, our Buffalo Office was not notified. Pertinent details were
brought to AG's attention by letter of 9-5-67, and we requested that "task force"
be instructed to immediately advise FBI of matters within our jurisdiction.

M. A. Jones To Bishop Memo :
RE: LUNCHEON WITH ATTORNEY GENERAL

(7) For first month (July) of new fiscal year, FBI convictions
decreased 189, or 22 percent. Decrease primarily due to: (a) shortage o!
fudges and prosecutors, resulting in overcrowded court conditions, and (b)
policy enunciated by Department's Criminal Division to reduce Federal _
prosecutions of juvenile offenders. In July, 1966, Assistant AG Vinson sent
jetter instructing U. S. Attorneys regarding diversion of subjects under age
21 to local authorities--which has principally been felt in Interstate Trans-
portation of Stolen Motor Vehicle violations, where experience indicates

about 65 percent of violators are under 21 and where FBI convictions
decreased 109 in July, 1967, compared with July, 1966. For sometime,

we have been advising AG whenever shortages of Federal judges or shortages
in U. S. Attorneys Offices exist. 7

RE: LUNCHEON WITH ATTORNEY GENERAL

DETAILS:

The Director has accepted an invitation for a luncheon with the
Attorney General on Friday, September 8, 1967. There is contained in this
memorandum succinct data concerning pertinent items which might be of '
interest for discussion on this occasion. The General Investigative, Special
Investigative and Domestic Intelligence Divisions have contributed salient
information for this memorandum.

ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCES:

On 9-5-67, the Attorney General called Mr. De Loach regarding
the Bureau's pending requests for approval of electronic surveillances. He
said he had finally made contact with Clark Clifford and Walt Rostow at the
White House on 8-31-67 and that he planned to meet with Dick Helms of the
Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and General Carter of the National Security
Agency (NSA) regarding this matter. The Attorney General said Clifford and
Rostow knew little about electronic surveillances and were very surprised that
the FBI had so little such coverage. He said that Clifford and Rostow, without
saying so, hinted that because of FBI reluctance to use surveillances, it might
be a good idea to transfer FBI responsibilities in domestic intelligence to CIA.

The Attorney General said he was opposed to this idea. He
said it would take a little time to bring. Clifford and Rostow around but that he
believed the Department and the FBI would come out ahead in the discussions ©
and that he, the Attorney General, will then have a more liberal hand in
approving requests from the FBI. In this connection, Mr. De Loach noted
that it would be premature to talk with Clifford or Rostow at this point but
after a decision has been reached, these two individuals could be briefed on

‘a confidential basis regarding such FBI operations. * It was also noted that it

did not appear the Attorney General could adequately represent the FBI in his
discussions with Clifford and Rostow.

We have confidentially obtained the information that Richard
Helms, Director of the CIA, hada meeting scheduled with the Attorney General
at 5 p.m., on Wednesday, September 6, 1967, and that Shit subject of the
meeting was probably ele ctronic surveillances.

This bill was passed by the House on 7-19-67. It provides for

Federal prosecution of persons who travel interstate with the intent to incite

- 1 ariot. ts, practical and legal usefulness has been questioned by a number of
people, including many Senators, due to the extreme difficulty in obtaining
evidence to prdve intent. Our Hill sources have advised there was a hope the
Bill could be bottled up in committee unless it could be’changed to make it
more practical. These sources concede the Bill will pass the Senate without

, difficulty if it reaches the floor because many Senators would consider it
politically unwise to vote against it. We took no stand on the Bill with the
Department, but did cite examples of interstate travel by militant Negroes
and hate group leaders to areas where strife developed. The Bill, if passed,
could substantially increase our investigative responsibilities, depending, of
course, on the policy established by the Department.

H.R.

H.R. 5037, LAW ENFORCEMENT AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE ASSISTANCE
H ACT OF 1967:

This is the Administration's bill, originally called the Safe
Streets and Crime Control Act, although it has been changed considerably by
Republican-sponsored amendments made when the House passed the bill on
8-8-67. One of these amendments by Congressman Robert McClory (R.-DLY
which changed Title 3 of the Bill, would empower the regional institutes to
engage in police training. This would duplicate and compete with the extensive
police training program we conduct on our own and in cooperation with local
and state agencies. This has been brought to the attention of our friends on
the Senate Judiciary Committee. Many of them have voiced agreement and
stated they will take the necessary. action to correct this wrong. Our Hilt

sources have-advised that Senator John McClellan (D.-Ark.) and Senator Roman
Hruska (R.-Neb.) plan to combine their bills authorizing controlled use of
wiretaps and eavesdropping devices and to add this to H.R. 5037 in Committee.
They feel wiretap legislation as a part of the Administration's crime bill will
have an excellent chance for passage and possible acceptance by the President.

ORGANIZED CRIME:

- As of September 7, 1967, there were.a total of 382 individuals,
involved in organized criminal activities, who have been arrested, indicted,
or awaiting further prosecutive action in connection with violations of
various Federal statutes.

By letter dated July 27, 1967, the Bureau called to the attention
of the Attorney General 2 situation where 23 individuals arrested in New York
for violations of the gambling laws in 1964 were still awaiting final prosecutive
action. It was called to the attention of the Attorney General that prosecutive
action taken at the earliest possible date with reference to these individuals
would greatly assist in increasing accomplishments in the organized crime
field during the present fiscal year. To date no response from the Attorney
General has been received to this communication.

The Attorney General has indicated that he is desirous of
achieving in the neighborhood of 400 convictions of individuals involved in
organized crime during this fiscal year. With 382 such subjects already
awaiting prosecution, the Attorney General's goal would appear to be readily
available if vigorous prosecutive action is taken of these individuals at the
earliest possible date by the Department.

"LIFE" MAGAZINE ARTICLE:

. "Life" magazine has run articles for the last two weeks on

La Cosa Nostra, which articles were written by Sandy Smith,. former crime
reporter for the "Chicago Tribune '* Smith has done an excellent job in these
articles in focusing public attention on the Cosa Nostra leaders as well as
their politica] affiliations and the need for electronic surveillances in order
to cope with the menace of organized crime.

Smith is an outstanding investigative reporter who has a
wealth of independent knowledge built up over the years on La Cosa Nostra.
He also has tremendous contacts among the local and state police intelligence
agencies throughout the country. In addition, it is obvious that he obtained
considerable help from such persons as Professor Robert Blakey of Notre
Dame, former Departmental Attorney in the Organized Crime Section, in

*and "Chicago Sun-Times. " (CONTINUED - OVER)

RE: LUNCHEON WITH ATTORNEY GENERAL

connection with this article. He also has used the information disclosed
from our microphones in court cases in such cases as the Raymond
Patriarca matter, etc.

DEPARTMENT TASK FORCE, BUFFALO, NEW YORK:

: In October, 1966, under the direction of the Organized Crime
and Racketeering Section of the Department, a "task force” was organized
as an investigative operation, supervised by Department Attorneys, and to
which were assigned representatives from various Federal investigative
agencies.

On August 21 and 23, 1967, the "task force’ conducted
investigative activity, including physical surveillances in the Niagara Falls,
New York, area. The subject of its investigation was one Ernest Reinhart,

a bookmaker from Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada, who was said to be
making trips daily to Niagara Falls, New York, to establish regular contacts
and gambling pickups from other known gamblers. The Niagara Falls, New
York, Police Department, which was also investigating the activities of
Reinhart, had requested the assistance of the United States Customs Service
to develop sufficient evidence to establish a violation of the local gambling
statute. A representative of the Customs Service notified the "task force"
representatives of the local police department's interest in this matter and
immediately thereafter, according to the officials of the Niagara Falls Police
Department, attorneys and other members of the 'task force" appeared at the
police department.and "took over" the entire investigation.

SAC Neil J. Welch.of our Buffalo Office has since determined
from representatives of the Niagara Falls Police Department and the Customs
Service that the investigative activity of the "task force" was so inept that the
case against Reinhart was "blown." (In conducting a surveillance the task force

. utilized a panel truck and their actions, while in the panel truck, were such that
they caused the truck to rock back and forth revealing to the gamblers who were
watching, that people were inside the truck.) Surveillances conducted by the
"task force, ' including attorneys assigned thereto, were readily discovered by
Reinhart and his associates. Reinhart remarked to a customs agent at the
border crossing that he would give the investigators a good run around.

- responsibility in the investigation of violations of this statute. In this

instance, Customs Service, Internal Revenue Service, and the local,
Niagara Falls, New York, Police Department also have investigative
responsibilities.

Pertinent details concerning this matter were brought to
the attention of the Attorney General by our letter dated September 5, 1967,
with the request that necessary instructions be issued to the "task force”
personnel that matters within FBI jurisdiction be immediately reported to
our Buffalo Office.

CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS - CONVICTIONS:

At the end of July, 1967, we had recorded 189 fewer con-
victions than were recorded during the first month of the prior fiscal-year.
This represents a decrease of 22%, which is primarily the result of two
factors: (1) shortages of judges and prosecutors which result in over-
crowded court conditions and (2) the policy enunciated by the Criminal
Division of the Department to reduce prosecutions in Federal court relating
to juvenile offenders.

In this connection, our potential for increasing conviction

. statistics was decimated as a result of a letter sent during July, 1966, by

Assistant Attorney General Vinson instructing all U. S. Attorneys to give
primary consideration to the diversion of subjects under 21 years of age to
local authorities. These instructions are being followed by a majority of

U. S. Attorneys and have hurt us principally in Interstate Transportation of
Stolen Motor Vehicle violations where experience has shown that approximately
65% of all violators are under 21 years of age. At the end of July, 1967, we
recorded 109 less convictions in this category as compared to the first month

- in the previous fiscal year.

We have for sometime been following the practice of advising
the Attorney General whenever shortages of Federal judges, U. S. Attorneys
or their assistants exist, For example, we recently sent the following letters
to the Attorney General’ Ping to his attention shortages of judges or U. S.
Attorneys in. the indicated areas:

9-1-67, Southern District of Georgia;

8-16-67, Eastern District of rtarncias

8-17-67, District of Kansas;

8-3-67, District of New Jersey;

8-2-67, Southern and Northern Districts of Mississippi;
7-31-67, Western District of New York.

M. A. Jones to Bishop
RE: LUNCHEON WITH ATTORNEY GENERAL

2 In connection with the situation in the Western District of
New York, we originally called this to the Attorney General's attention on
3-30-67 and we have received no information indicating that an appointment
has been made for the vacant judgeship. Considerable newspaper publicity
has attended the ae to appoint a judge for this district.

With regard to the two vacant judgeships in the Eastern District
of Michigan, it is noted that we first called this to the Attorney General's
attention on 3-16-67 and we have not received any current information
indicating these judgeships have been filled,

Each SAC has been instructed to keep the Bureau currently
advised of any shortages of judges or U. S. Attorneys and we will continue
to bring these matters to the attention of the Attorney General.

As an example of shortages which have been brought to the
Attorney General's attention, in connection with the shortage of judges in
the Southern District of Georgia, it is noted that as of September 1, 1967,
there was a total of 87 Bureau cases awaiting prosecution involying 121
defendants. Of these 22 representing 32 subjects have been pending prose-
cution for more than six months.

It-is also noted that in the District of New Jersey as of
July 1, 1967, there were approximately 200 Bureau cases awaiting prose-
cutive action involving approximately 392 defendants. Our New York Office

has also advised that it has 775 cases eateae prosecution representing 874
subjects.

Washington, D, C.

Individuals affiliated with two organizations funded
in part by OEO were involved in the disturbance which occurred
in the House of Representatives on 8/7/67 in protest of the
shelving of the so-called "Rat Bill.'' The leader, Jesse Gray,
a former Communist Party organizer in Harlem and a militant black
nationalist, is the head of the Harlem Back Street Youth, Incor-
porated, which was the recipient of OEO funds. Such funds have
since been suspended, Gray and at least one other member of the
above organization were arrested for their part in this disturbance,
Also involved in this disturbance and arrested was Robert Bailey
Ransom, an employee of Volunteers in Service to America (VISTA)
Associates, an OEO-funded organization.

Hate-type Schools

The New York City Police Department advised on 8/9/67
that the walls of a school handling a program entitled "Special
Training in Reading" for children 8 to 10 years of age contained
numerous hate slogans. Examples.of the signs noted thereon were
"Don't love them to death, shoot them to death; make revolution
not war; burn, baby, burn; arm yourselves; Johnson is losing
sleep; Newark, '67; Chicago South Side, '66; Watts, '65, and
Harlem, '64,'' There was also a picture of President Johnson's
face superimposed on an Army sergeant carrying a rifle captioned

1 "Public Enemy Number One, Wanted for Murder." The committee
handling this particular program was funded in part by OEO,
~ iy

A somewhat similar situation occurred in Nashville,
Tennessee, in connection with a "Liberation School" which has
been in operation teaching 10-and ll-year-olds, Antipoverty
funds from OEO had been earmarked for the school; however, the
funds were*withdrawn when national publicity resulted concerning
this matter,. Meantime, however, certain services including the

ental of an automobile and school supplies had been furnished.

MISUSE OF FBI _ INFORMATION BY OEQ

In connection with the recent arrest by Kentucky
authorities of Alan and Margaret McSurely, employees of the
Southern Conference Education Fund, and Joseph T, Mulloy, an
employee of an organization being funded by OEO, on a state
sedition charge, someone in OEO apparently leaked to the press
a report prepared by an OEO investigator which contained state-
ments attributed to the FBI, An article concerning this matter
appeared in the 9/1/67 issue of "The Evening Star."

The Director approved the lodging of a vigorous
protest with OEO concerning the fact that information appearing
in an FBI memorandum subsequently was published in "The Evening
Star,.'' In approving this action, he noted "Yes, and if they
can't or won't give us the necessary assurances against leaks,
we will cut off all investigative services to OKO,"

Such a protest was lodged through liaison with
Mr, Edgar May, Assistant Director, OEO, on 9/5/67 who advised
that steps had been taken to insure that such did not recur
in the future, A detailed memorandum is attached.

STATEMENTS AGAINST ESTABLISHED LAW AND ORDER

While no direct evidence has come to the Bureau's
attention of outright seditious statements on the part of anti-
poverty workers, allegations have been received of statements

against established law and order and of statements tending to
incite the people. Examples follow:

Marion S, Barry, Jr., former Washington Director of
the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, joined the United
Planning Grganization, Washington, D, C., as a $50-a-day consultant
on 7/21/67, This organization is funded by OEO. On 6/30/67 Barry
reportedly conducted a press conference on the steps of the 13th
Precinct, Metropolitan Police Department, at which time he
denounced the Police Department and stated that Negroes would

continue to threaten the police until policemen are trained
properly in how to deal with Negroes, Captain Al Prezio of the
Troy, New York, Police Department, advised on 8/25/67 that
Freeman Robinson, an employee of an antipoverty organization
funded by OEO, uses the office of the antipoverty organization
las a headquarters to conduct militant civil rights work and to
recruit teen-agers to incite riots and arouse a Negro community
on any issue that would create racial unrest,

Willie Wright, a duly-elected board member of the

United Community Corporation, Newark, New Jersey, is alleged
‘to have made statements concerning Negro rioting such as "To

hell with President Johnson when he says something about not
| ’ | tolerating riots, We've tolerated these conditions for more
than 400 years,"'. He is also quoted as having said: "It is my
firm conviction that in order to overcome the white man's complete
human and legal jurisdiction over my black brothers and sisters,
we are going to defend ourselves against all kinds of aggressions
that are being perpetrated against us by the white man, I most
emphatically want to make sure the majority of my black brothers
and sisters have a piece of firepower in their home possessions
to protect themselves against the most brutal atrocities to be
seen anywhere committed by the New Jersey National Guard, the
Newark and State Police in-the recent rebellion in the City of
Newark," The OEO has requested Wright's suspension pending its
‘investigation of statements attributed toWright,

"The Washington Post" of 9/13/67 ‘contained an article
by Columnist Roscoe Drummond captioned "Mayors Say OEO Programs
Helped Suppress City Riots" in which he refers to a nationwide
survey conducted by OEO in 64 cities, half of which had riots
this summer, In citing OEO figures he pointed out that of 30,000
Community Action employees only 16 were arrested during the course
of the riots and none were convicted, Poverty programs had 244
buildings in the hearts of the riot ‘areas with none being burned
or destroyed.

In view of this matter béing a potential source of
embarrassment to both the Bureau and the Department, the facts

they had discussed this matter by telephone with U. S. Attorney
Strickler who reluctantly agreed to proceed against subjects by

manner in which Strickler released this information to the newspapers
and that Mr. Hayden Crawford of the Department was to separately

STATUS OF JOHN GEORGE LEDES;
JOSEPH ABRAMS
FRAUD AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT -
CONFLICT OF INTEREST

This case was referred to us by the Attorney General
on. 12/31/59, It relates to the association between John George
Ledes, a former legal advisor to Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) Commissioner James E. Sargent, and Joseph
Abrams, a New York promoter of unsavory reputation,,

We have reviewed voluminous SEC files here and in
New York and have interviewed numerous persons in and out of
SEC who handledcases involving Abrams' firms. We determined
that Ledes endeavored to assist Abrams in several SEC matters
while Ledes was still with that agency. We are now engaged
in interviewing additional persons with possible pertinent
knowledge of the association and in the detailed job of tracing
Ledes' financial transactions through bank, realty and other
records to pin down specifics of loans from Abrams to Ledes
relative to financing properties purchased by Ledes. Abrams'
loans may constitute payment of compensation to Ledes and thus
bring their relationship within the scope of the Conflict of
Interest Statutes.

It is noted we have been told that both Ledes and
Abrams were associated with Tony Russo, ex-confidential
assistant to former Attorney General Brownell. Russo has not
been alleged to be involved in any irregularities in this matter.

The case is being given top priority in handling both
in the field and at the Seat of Government. 5

MELVIN W. SMITH - VICTIM
CIVIL RIGHTS

This is the case concerning which Acting Assistant
Attorney General Joseph HM. F. Ryan, Jr., Civil Rights Division,
made a press release on 1/14/60 stating that the FBI has been
requested to investigate this matter.

By memorandum 1/14/60, Mr. Ryan requested a preliminary
investigation based upon a news article in the "Washington Post
and Times Herald," 1/12/60, and an editorial in the same ‘paper,
1/13/60, regarding an incident in Montgomery County Peoples Court
wherein one Gordon L. Contee became violent when convicted of
rape. He was subdued-.by officers but Melvin Smith, Contee's
19-year-old half brother, rushed forward from the audience and
struck Frank Griggs, an officer who was subduing Contee. It was
alleged that Smith was beaten by the officers while being taken
to jail after his assault on Griggs. 7

Colonel James S, McAuliffe, superintendent, Montgomery
County Police, Melvin L. Reese, Montgomery Caimty Manager, and
Luke Bennett, sheriff, have all been notified that the Bureau
has undertaken investigation of this matter.

Pertinent court records were not available over the
week end but will be reviewed 1/18/60. The Montgomery County
Police Department reports have not yet been made available, but
State's Attorney Leonard T. Kardy is meeting with County Manager
Reese and County Police Superintendent McAuliffe 18/60 to discuss
making these records available.

Subjects' attorneys have advised them to make no
statement except in attorneys! presence. Subjects Griggs, Bechtel
and Davries have advised they are represented by Barnard T.

Welsh and will confer with him to determine whether they should
furnish statements. 7

The victim has been interviewed and admits striking
subject Griggs in the eye while in court and then running from
the courttoom. We was caught in the hall and while being taken
up a narrow stairway by Devries and an unknown officer, they
met subjécts Griggs, Offutt and Bechtel. Griggs, who had a
night stick, allegedly said, "That's the one who hit me in the
nose." As the victin passed Griggs, he was hit on the head with
a hard object but did not see who hit him. As he turned around,
Griggs hit him on the head with the night stick, Offutt then hit
him with his fist above the left eye and Bechtel kicked him on the
leg. Devries hit him on the back with his fist. The victim was not
handcuffed at the time aaa that he offered any resistance.

DAMAGE TO NUCLEAR SUBMARINE "NAUTILUS," NUCLEAR
CRUISER "LONG BEACH" AND GUIDZD NISSILZ FRIGATE "LUCE"
: SABOTAGS

The Boston Office is investigating three cases involving
possible sabotage in connection with the three captioned vessels of
the United States Navy.

Between 9-28-59 and 10-19-59 numerous cuts were found in
the electrical cables of the nuclear submarine "Nautilus," which was
being overhauled at Portsmouth, New Hampshire. On 11~12-59 foreign
material was found in a pump on the "Nautilus." The Boston Office
has interviewed the entire crew of the "Nautilus" and over 1,500 ship-
yard employees,submitted numerous cut cables for Laboratory examination
and used the polygraph in connection with pertinent interviews.

On 1-5-60 nine small cuts were discovered in the degaussing
cables (protection against magnetic mines) of the nuclear cruiser
"Dong Beach}! which is being constructed at Quincy, Massachusetts.
These cuts contain no identifying marks for Laboratory comparison
with tools. As of 1-1h-60, 2,1) of over 5,000 employees having
access to this vessel had been interviewed.

On 12~28-59, 21 cuts were found in the fire control wiring
of the guided missile frigate "Luce," which is also being constructed
at Quincy, Massachusetts. This damage was not reported to us or to
the Office of Naval Intelligence until 1-11-60 as the damage was
originally considered probably inadvertent. In view of the other
two cases involving cut cables, the Boston Office has opened an
investigation on this matter also.

. The typs of damage involved or the lack of any attempt to
hide or disguise the damage may be indicative qf employees attempting
to create more work or of disgruntled Navy personnel. The Boston
Office has been instructed to afford these cases vigorous intensive
investigation.

BERNARD J. GOLDFINE

_ Although we are not involved in the Goldfine natter,
] his case is currently the subject of a great deal of discussion
between the Tax Division and the Treasury Department.

Ine Goldfine tar fraud investigation, according to
our Treasury sources, is scheduled to go before grand jury in
Boston next month. Goldfine and his nine New England companies
owe the Government approxrimately etght million dollars. This,
of course, includes interest, 6%; delinquency penalties, 25%;
and fraud penalty, 50% You will recall that the approximate
figure appeared in the newspapers and the Goldfine defense
charged that this was an attempt on the part of the Government
i to try its case in the newspapers, Wo action was taken by ©
| freasury to look into this alleged leak of information on the
1 request of the Tar Division of Justice since the total figure of
Goldfine's delinquency hed been discussed with Goldfine and his
tax attorneys. It was felt that they could have, planted the
story in the press. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has also
| established a tax case on Goldfinets son, Horace, which approximates
$99,000 delinquency, and a similar case has been made on Hildred
Papernan, Goldfine ts confidential assistant.

Of course, as previously reported, IPS has established
a fatlure to file criminal violation on Goldfine for the years
1955, 1956, and 1957, However, since this is a misdemeanor,
Justice had waited until the taz fraud investigation was developed
in order to go ahead with its prosecution. The one weakness in
the tax froud case is proving knowledge and culpability directly
- to Gohtdfine.' IRS feels that he will argue that his taz affairs
were handled by a competent tax firm and he had every right to
feel that his tax affairs were being handle@ within the law

In additton to the tax fraud inuestigation, the Inspection

Service of IRS ldoked into the Goldfine matter to determine the

which might detect Goldfine's delinquencies. In addition, he

used Goldfine's high-level connections in scaring ofj' IRS
investigators whenever an inquiry was made concerning Goldfine's

New England local and state political figures.

INDUSTRIAL SECURITY PROGRAM

Following the Supreme Court decision in the Greene
case.on June 29, 1959, prolonged efforts to prepare a
Presidential Directive to establish a program under which
private contractors may be granted access to classified data
have culminated in a draft Order dated January 7, 1960.
Budget is circulating this draft to all interested agencies.
The more recent Bureau comments concerning this matter were
forwarded by memorandum to AAG Yeagley, December 30, 1959;
by memorandum to the Attorney General, ‘with copies to
Hessrs. Walsh and Yeagley, January 6, 1960; by memorandum,
January 11, 1960, to Mr. Yeagley; and by memorandum of
January 14, 1960, to Assistant Attorney General Kramer, with
copy to Mr. Yeagley. The last two of these communications
both concerned the same draft which is now being circulated
by Budget.

In brief, we have noted that under the proposed Order
agencies may consider all of the pertinent information available
regardless of source. Under Section 4 A 1 protection is ©
afforded to regular confidential informants. Under Section 44.2
information from persons other than current informants may be
considered if they cannot appear due to death, severe tliness,
or some such other good and sufficient cause, It ts apparent
that information from casual informants who refuse to testify ~~
cannot be used under this section.

Section 5 B, according to Mr. Yeagley, would allow
use of data from wire taps, microphones, and other sensitive
techniques.. Mr. Yeagley has indicated, however, that such
data would have to be produced in the form of actual quotations
from. the conversations rather than the paraphrased form in
which we disseminate this information. Wet believe tt witli not
be possible for us to furnish other than paraphrased information
tn most instances because of the absolute necessity of protecting
our sources.

»Even though data from casual informants and sensitive
techniques may not be used as indicated above, Section 9 of the
Order grants and affirms the department head concerned authority

NW 65360 Docld:32989646 Page 1032 ase =



NW 65360 Docld:32989646 Page 1033

to exercise control over the Nation's military and defense
secrets and nothing in the rest of the Order is deemed. to

Limit or affect his responsibility and powers in this regard.

Use of such authority and power will permit the department ~

head to act in those instances in which derogatory data is
available but cannot be utilized under the procedures established
in the balance of the Order. We have observed to the Department
that it has undoubtedly considered the public reaction should it
turn out that it is necessary to use this summary Power ing :
majority of cases.

We have several times reiterated that FBI will
respect the confidence placed in tt by both regular informants
or.other persons and will not disclose their identity without
their specific permission. We have summarized by stating
that from our standpoint, the Order as drafted, will permit
us. to furnish all available data to appropriate agencies as in
the past and provides appropriate protection for our confidential
informants. Data from any casual informants and from highly
sensitive techniques will largely be usable only under Section 9.
We have stated that the Bureau dces not object to the proposed
Order from an operational standpoint.

On January 14, John Doherty of the Department tnformed
us of a very minor addition, Proposed by Philip Areeda of the
White House, which was discussed in memorandum of January 15.
This additton would not affect the comments we have previously
made concerning thts Order.

PROGRCTING IDENTITY OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMANTS
CONFRONTATION ISSUL

The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments on two
cases involving hearings and the right of confrontation on
January 18, 1960. The cases involve Hannan us. Larche and
Hannah vs. Slawson. Solicitor General Rankin will argue the cases ©
for the Government. i :

The cases involve the President's Civil Rights Commission
which was established by the Federal Ctutl Rights Act of 1957
to investigate charges oj citizens being discriminatorily deprived
of the right to vote. The question raised for the Supreme Court
is whether the Civil Rights Act of 1957 authorizes the Civil Rights
Commission to conduct hearings wherein state .registrars and
private citizens accused of depriving others of the right to vote
are denied notice of charges against them and confrontation.

Although the hearings held by the Givil Rights
Commisston are investigative rather than judicial or punitive
such as the normal Government hearing, the argument and the
Supreme Court decision in these cases could shed some light
on the issue of confrontation as well as the investigative agency's
right to protect the identity of confidential informants. This
is particularly true in view of the current negotiations to
produce an Executéve Order in relation to the Industrial Security
Program.

These are the two cases which the "Washington Post"
| commented upon editorially on December 14, 1959, supporting the

Civil Rights Commission's hearing procedures in that it was

necessary that the Commisston protect their confidential informants
from reprisals by segregationists., fhe "Washington Evening Star"

oa January 11, 1960, in reporting the Attorney General 4s first

trip to argue a case before the Supreme Court on the constitutional ity
of the Federal Civil Rights Act commented that the above cases would
prove more difficult for the Government to argue and obtain a
favorable decision.

SEIZURE POWERS IN NEUTRALITY CASES

“The Department for about a year has been
negotiating to obtain for us seizure powers under Title 22,
Section 401, United States Code, which would enable us to
seize arms, munitions of war and other articles about
_to be exported in violation of law and follow through
to final conclusion in the investigation of neutrality
cases, This was to be accomplished through the issuance
of an Executive Order conferring on the Attorney General
powers to seize under this statute which in turn would
be delegated to the FBI by the Attorney General.

On November 19, 1959, the Attorney General
advised that the Treasury Department had agreed to the
proposed Executive Order, The Department advised on
December 23, 1959, that the proposed Executive Order

- had been sent by the Attorney General to the President
\ through the director of the Bureau of the Budget for
approval by letter dated December 16, 1959.

On January 15, 1960, pursuant to our inquiry
concerning the current status of this matter, Assistant
Attorney General Walter Yeagley advised that the proposed
Executive Order is presently in the Bureau of the Budget
which has sent it to certain agencies for comment.
Yeagley advised that the Bureau of the Budget had heard
from the Treasury Department but had not received replies
from the Office of Civil and Defense Mabilization, Department of
Defense and the State Department. He advised that he

| could not understand why the Office of Civil and Defense
Mobilization or the Department of Defense would have any
comment on this and stated he was’ going to check with
Mr. Levy at the Bureau of the Budget who is handling
this flatter in an effort to have it expedited,

On January 28, 1960, approximately 10:30 p.m., an
explosion occurred in the front courtyard of the Kehilath-
Israel Synagogue, 800 East Meyer Boulevard, Kansas City,
Missouri. Property damage consisting of 51 plate-glass
windows shattered, broken stained glass window and dented
door amounting to approximately $5,000, Only occupants of
synagogue were the janitor andhis wife, neither of whom was
injured.. FBI Laboratory examination indicated characteristics
of a dynamite explosion, Laboratory examiner flown to Kansas
City to assist in examination of evidence.

Witnesses observed two automobiles leaving area
at high rate of speed immediately after explosion. Identifi-
cation made of occupants of automobile. Interviews being
conducted, Other witnesses saw four youths running from
vicinity of synagogue immediately after explosion... High
school student has made statement that he and another student
were responsible for the bombing; however, later denied that
they were involved. Students are being interviewed.
Approximately one month ago, several thousand blasting caps
were stolen from company in Kansas City. Half of stolen
caps recovered by Kansas City police in possession of teen-
agers who are being considered as suspects in bombing.

Investigation determined a number of high school
students in Kansas City area recently formed Nazi-type group.
Members of group identified and interviewed. Two juvenile
members are prime suspects. .

AFL - CIO :
ELECTION LAWS

This matter involves the reported contributions by
Local 688 to the political campaigns of Federal candidates. .
Most of the contributions involved were apparently made from
the political action committee account of Local 688,
Contributions from such accounts would not normally constitute
violations of Section 610, Title 18, U. S. Code; however,
with respect to this case, the Department by memorandum of
December 14, 1959, stated that it had been advised by the
E 5. Attorney in St. Louis that the political action conmittee

fund of Local 688was actually a general fund of the union's
which was raised from dues assessments and was not a fund derived
from voluntary contributions, Section 610, Title 18, U. 38. Code,
prohibits contributions by labor unions to the campaigns of
Federal candidates,

On November 2, 1959, the U. 3. Attorney in St. Louis,
Missouri, began subpoenaing a number of witnesses to appear
i before a Federal Grand dury in St. Louis which conducted an
inquiry concerning the captioned matter. In conjunction with
the Grand Jury's inquiry, the Bureau, at the specific requests
of the U. 5S. Attorney and of the Civil Rights Division,
conducted certain investigation for the assistance of the
U. 5S. Attorney in presenting this matter to the Grand Jury.
Our investigation included interviews with Senator Wayne
Morse (D.-Ore. ), Senator Thomas Hennings (D. - Mo.), 1
Congressman James Roosevelt (D. - Calif.) and Congressman
Henry 3. Reuss (9. - Wisc.).

On January 27, 1960, U. 8. Attorney Webster and
Assistant U. 5. Attorney Bigler, St, Louis, advised that. on
January 26, 1960, they had sent a proposed indictment, together
with a summary of the evidence, to the Depar {ment for its
approval. They advised that they would like, if possible, to
present the indictment to the Grand Jury in St. Louis on
February 3, 1960. ‘The U. S. Attorney said that the proposed
indictment does not include a charge against James R, Hoffa.
lle said the evidence connecting Hoffa with the check payable
to the Congressman Henry 5. Reuss campaign seemed insufficient
to support a charge against Hoffa. These officials mentioned
that the proposed indictment includes 21 counts, involving
10 political contributions,

STATUS OF JOHN GEORGE LEDES $
JOSEPH ABRAMS
FRAUD AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT -
CONFLICT OF INTEREST

This case was referred to us by the Attorney General
on 12-31-59, It relates to the association between Ledes, a
former legal adviser to Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
Commissioner James Ce Sargent and Abrams, a New York promoter of
unsavory reputation. Ledes resigned from Reynolds and Company,
New York brokers, on 1-28-60.

We have reviewed voluminous SEC files throughout
the, country and have interviewed numerous persons in and out
of SEC who handled cases involving Abrams' firms. We determined
that Ledes endeavored to assist Abrams in several SEC matters
while Ledes was still with that agency. Abrams made loans to
Ledes relative to financing properties purchased by Ledes.. These
loans may constitute payment of compensation to Ledes and thus
bring their relationship within the scope of Conflict of Interest
Statuteso

SEC Commissioner Sargent, who originally denied knowledge
as to any connection between Ledes and Abrams, has since improved
his memory considerably and now feels he may have been: taken
advantage of by Ledes. Sargent finally furnished a signed state-
ment as to his recollection of these matters on 2-5-60. Sargent
told us that Ledes had been in touch with Tony Russo who had
arranged for former fore General Brownell to talk to Attorney
General Rogers in July, 1958, about Sargent's ambition at the time
to become U. S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York.
We have been told that both Ledes and Abrams were associated with
Russo, ex-confidential assistant to Brownell. Russo has not been
alleged to be involved in any irregularities in this matter.

Arrangements are now being made to interview subject
Ledes in New York City. Arrangements are also being made to
interview subject Abrams who is serving a 30-mcnth sentence on
Fraud Against the Government charges, as well as Abrams! uncle,
Charles Gordon. These interviews, and subsequent record checks
to verify information furnished by the subjects, will complete
the investigation,

CRASH OF NATIONAL AIRLINES FLIGHT 967
“GULF OF MEXICO, NOVEMBER 16, 1959
DESTRUCTION GF AIRCRAFT OR MOTOR VEHICLES
INTERSTATE TRANSPORTATION OF STOLEN MOTOR VEHICLE

: On November 16, 1959, a plane with 42 persons aboard,
owned by Delta Air Lines but staffed with a National Airlines
crew; plunged into the Gulf of Mexico while on_a flight from
Tampa, Florida, to New Orleans, Louisiana. nly ten of the
victims ache identified and the other bodies have not been
recovered.

On January 17, 1960, we initiated a full-scale
investigation in this matter. It had been alleged that
Dr. Robert V. Spears, an ex-convict with a long criminal
record who had been reported as a passenger on the plane, had
induced his friend and former partner in crime, William Allen
Taylor of Tampa, Florida, to board the plane in his place.
Spears had over $100,000 worth of insurance with his wife as
beneficiary and Taylor purchased $37,500 worth of flight
insurance just prior to the trip with his son as beneficiary.

From the first, or investigation was directed at
finding Spears or Taylor since this appeared to be a key point
in our investigation. Spears was located by Bureau Agents in
Fhoenix, Arizona, on January 20, 1960, and charged with the
Interstate Transportation of a Stolen Motor Vehicle (iTV).
Spears admitted Taylor took his place on the ill-fated plane
and that following the crash he, Spears, tried to conceal his
identity. We took Taylor's car,with his alleged permission,
but admitted he had no authority to take it to Arizona and
that he and his friend, Dr. William Turska, removed the
identification number from it and tried to get a fraudulent
title for the car. Spears, with Turska, contacted lrs. Spears

‘in Dallas, Texas, about January 7, 1960, and Mrs. Spears
admitted that her husband persuaded her not, to reveal the
fact that he was alive so that the insurance policies could
be paid to her as beneficiary.

On January 20, 1960, when Spears was arrested in
Phoenix, Arizona, he was charged with the Interstate Transportation
of a Stolen Motor Vehicle for taking Taylor's car from Florida to
Arizona, He was taken to the U.S. Commissioner in Phoenix on
that date and held on $35,006 bond. . On February’ 1, 1960, Spears
was brought before the U.S. District Judge in Fhoenix and.

| NW 65360 Docld:32989646 Page 1043



charged by information with the interstate transportaion of Taylor's automobile.
| Spears waived indictment and entered a plea of guilty. His bond was continued
at $35,000, and February 15, 1960, was set as the date for sentencing.

| Physical evidence from the crash is extremely sparse. Since the ©
examination of the limited physical material found did not indicate an
explosion or the reason for the crash, it was hoped that the plane could
be located in the Gulf. If the plane could be found and examined, it might
reveal some definite physical evidence of the cause of the crash, particularly
if a bomb was involved. On January 28, 1960, salvage operations were begun
- by the Navy in the Gulf of Mexico after sonar contact had located an object
which was thought to be the plane. On February 5, 1960, however, the Navy
discontinued salvage operations without locating the downed aircrait.

—

Following an interview with an abortionist in Dallas, Texas, who
formerly associated with Dr. Spears, the Miami.Office advanced the theory
that Spears might have been in Tampa on November 18 to 15, 1959, for
the purpose of preparing an abortion formula through a process which involves
the cooking of dynamite to obtain nitroglycerin, and that Spears might have
prevailed on Taylor to transport the formula to Dallas by plane in Spears’

place. The explosion,- if there was one, might have resulted from an
accidental explosion of the abortion formula. The Laboratory has considered
this theory and has advised that it knows of no instance of the use of -
nitroglycerin in preparations utilized to produce abortions. In addition,
during a reinterview with the Dallas abortionist, he advised that all of

the ingredients used by Spears in his abortion formula were stable and not
volatile or explosive.

All persons contacted in this investigation have denied any knowledge
| of the wilful destruction of the plane. Nevertheless our investigation is being
pressed to determine full facts and to uncover any violations of Federal laws
which might have occurred. The United States Attorney at Phoenix has been
kept fully advised and has under consideration the question of whether a
prosecutable Federal case for mail fraud exists against Dr. Spears, his wife
and/or Dr. Turska.
As of February 8, 1960, twenty-five investigative reports in this case
have been madé available to the Department and to the Civil Aeronautics Board.

CRASH OF NATIONAL AIRLINES DC-SB
BOLIVIA, NORTH CAROLINA
JANUARY 6, 1960
DESTRUCTION OF AIRCRAFT OR MOTOR VEHICLES

On January 6, 1950, a’ National Airlines DC~6B plane crashed
at Boltvia, North Carolina, killing all 34 occupants. The body of one
passenger, Julian Andrew Frank, was found about 20 miles from the crash
scene. Frank, a New York attorney, carried insurance of fe 500
and was reportedly engaged in fraudulent activities.

Investigation at the scene oj the crash, including examination
of available parts of the plane reassembled in a "mock up," has been
conducted by Civil Aeronautics Board investigators. They have seen

) nadie to reach a definite conclusion as to the cause oj the crash.

Frank's body, which was found near Kure Beach, North Carolina,
bore only remnants of clothing. The dody was mangled and the lower
‘ portion of the left arm and of both legs were missing. His luggage,
| ) whicn reportedly consisted oj a zipper-type blue flight bag and a
! brown leather attache case, has not been located.
FBI Laboratory examination of Frank's right hand and part
of his right arm, foreign material removed from his hand and arm and
portions of clothing found on his body revealed no explosive residue.
Pathologists who examined Frank's body have advised that his- body
had the appearance of having been subjected to a severe force of unusual
nature and they believe his injurtes resembled blast damage but they
cannot definitely tdentify them as such. According to the pathologists,
simtlar wounds have deen observed on victims of land mine explosions.

on January 28, 1960, disclosed some nitrate present in a dirty smeared
deposi in an area of the jacket tn which were tmbedded metal fragments
Jrom a atpper and pteces of blue material. Wumerous small blue fragments
ST om the lige jacket and from unidentified cloghing found at the crash
scene were determined to be similar and appear to correspond to the
matertal whitch composes dlue flight bags sold by various airlines.

of a detonation of a high-order type oj explosive. These findings
are not conclusive and addittonal material from the scene oj' the crash
will be examined as received by the FBI Laboratory in an effort to
reach a definite conclusion.

Extensive investigation of the activities of Frank has failed
to develop any direct evidence to date that he was responsible for
the crash. The investigation of his activities and of the activities
of his associates ts continuing. Thirty-two investigative reports have
been dissemirated to the Department and to the Civil weronautics Board.

SABOTAGE

The Boston Office is investigating three cases involving
posstble sabotage to three vessels of the United States Navy.

. Between 9-28-59 and 10-19-59, 279 cuts were found in the
electrical cables of the nuclear submarine "Nautilus," which was
being overhauled at Portsmouth, New Hampshire, ‘It has been determined
that 42 of these cuts could have been made accidentally. On 21-12-59
foretgn material was found tn a pump on the "Nauttlus." The Boston
Office has tntervtewed the entire crew of the "Nautilus" and over 1,500
shipyard employees. As many of the damaged cables ‘as could be made
available by the Navy have been submitted for Laboratory examination
and additional specimens are being submitted when they can be made
available by the Wavy. The polygraph has beer usec in connecttor with
the interviews of suspect individuals and additional interviews using
the polygraph are being arranged,

| On 1-15-60 nine small cuts were discovered in the degaussing

cables (protection against magnetic mines) of the nuclear cruiser
"Long Beach," which ts being constructed at Quincy, Massachusetts.
These cuts contain no identifying marks for Laboratory comparison
with suspect tools. An average of 2,700 employees worked on this
vessel daily and a total of approximately 5,000 employees had access
to it. Over 3,100 individual employees have been interviewed and
interviews are continuing. ;

On 12~28-59, 21 cut wtres were found in the ftre control
wiring of the guided missile frigate "Luce", which ts also under
construction at Quincy, Massachusetts. This damage was not reported
to us or to the Office of Naval Intelligence until 1-11-50 as the
damage was originally considered inadvertent. Over 14,900 employees
hdd- access to the vessel. The employees asstgned to the area of the
damage have been identified and are being interviewed, Other employees
known to have worked in the area are also being interviewed, The
damaged wires have been forwarded to the FBI Laboratory for exanination,

In connection with the damage on the "Long Beach" and "Luce”
| supervisory employees have expressed the opinion that this danage is

of the nutsan&e and malicious mischief type rather than sabotage as the
danage was not hidden and was readily apparent, The Boston Office has

Investigation concerning the "Long Beach" and "Luce" has
been delayed by a strike at the shipyard where these vessels are
under construction which began 1-23-80, Management representatives
have been unable to enter the shipyard due to the picket line and
thus personnel ts not available to furnish the names and addresses

INDUSTRIAL SECURITY PROGRAM

On February 2, 1960, the House passed H.R, 8121,
introduced by Mr. Walter, which would authorize the Secretary
of Defense to establish a program for screening employees

- of private contractors for access to classified information.
The biil states that procedures prescribed by Defense shail
be designed to protect from disclosure all information which,
in the opinion of the Secretary of Defense, would affect the
nattonal security, safety, or public interest or would tend
to compromise investigative sources or investigative methods.
The bill has been referred to the Senate Committee on the
Judiciary and, if passed, would permit Defense to reinstitute
the same program which was in effect at the time of the
Supreme Court decision in the Greene Case. Defense could,
however, institute a new program offering a mazimun of con~
Srontation while protecting sources or peenmraies in accordance
with the terms ofthe bill.

On February 5, 1960, Assistant Attorney General “‘Yeagley
- forwarded a new draft of the proposed Executive Order in this
matter and stated it was the result of meetings with the Attorney
General and the. White House and that he hoped that it would
be the final draft. This draft introduced four major changes.

The first of these would permit use of information
from @ so-colled "casual" informant without confrontation if the
informant could not appear due to death, severe illness, or

2 oth cause determined by the head of the department to
be good and sufficient. The underlined words have been added
and would considerably broaden the circumstances under which
information from such a source might be used.

A second change, however, would require that when
an exception to confrontation was granted in the case of death
or severe tilness, as ‘tndicated above, the identity of the
source be disclosed to the applicant. Thts requirement would
apply only*in the case of death or severe illness and would not
apply to the new exception discussed in the previous paragraph.
We have repeatedly told the Department that we must respect the

NW 65360 Docld:32989646 Page 1048



NW 65360 Docld:32989646 Page 1049.

confidence placed in us by persons who furnish us information
and that we will not disclose their identities without their
permission. In the case of death or severe iliness, we will
be unable to secure that permission and we do not understand
why this requirement has been added.

A third change makes it possible for either the
Attorney General or the Director to certify that an individual
is @ current confidential informant and that his disclosure
would be detrimental to the national security. The previous
draft required that this certification be made by the Attorney
General and we consider this preferable. If the head of the
investigative agency is permitted to furnish derogatory data
and, at the same time, to decide whether the applicant is to
have an opportunity to confront the source of that data, this
-procedure may be criticized both by the: public and the courts.
This matter was discussed with the Department by Mr. Belmont
at a meeting in the Deputy Attorney General's Office on
August 31, 1959, when it was agreed that both from a logical
standpoint and the standpoint of the Supreme Court,
certification concerning the need to protect an informant's
identity should be made by the Attorney General in the case
of the FBI or the appropriate Geparenen’ head in the case of
other investigative agencies.

Lhe fourth change clarifies the authority of the
department head to deny or revoke access to classified data
without regard to the balance of the Order. Although the
previous draft granted this authority, the new language is an
tmprovement as tt removes all possible doubt as to its meaning.

: Our observations concerning the four changes, as
summarized above, were forwarded to Assistant: Attorney General
Yeagley by memorandum dated February 8, 1940.

SEIZURE POWERS IN NEUTRALITY CASES

The Department has been attempting to have
issued_an Executive Order which would give us power
under. Title 22, Section 401, United States Code, to
seize arms, munitions of war and other articles about
to be exported in violation of law and follow through
to final conclusion in the investigation of neutrality
cases, The Department advised on December 23, 1959,
that the proposed Executive Order had been sent by the
Attorney General to the fresident through the director
qoggte Bureau of the Budget by letter dated December 16,

Fursuant to our inquiries,.the Department
determined that the proposed Executive Order had been
sent by the Bureau of the Budget to the Defense, Commerce
and State Departments and to the Office of Civil and
Defense Mobilization, It had_been previously cleared with
Treasury by the Department. This matter has been closely
followed with the Department_and on February 3, 1960, we
ascertained that the Budget Bureau has received replies
from all these agencies offering no objection to the
issuance of the Order. Commerce, however, in its letter
to the Budget Bureau on February 1, 1960, a copy of which
was furnished us by the Department, on February 3, 1960
asked for assurances from the Department and the FBI that
we understood Commerce has jurisdiction under the Export
Control Act of 1949 and would keep the Commerce Department
advised of any information developed of interest to that

- agency.

——

A letter was sent to the Department on February 5,
1960, suggesting that the Department serid Commerce a
letter similar to the one it previously furnished Treasury
assuring that these seizure powers would be used only in
neutrality cases and that, of course, the FBI would
furnish Commerce any pertinent information developed.
It is assumed that upon the receipt of that letter by
Commerce the matter will then be cleared for the President's
signature.

; : HENRY WINSTON

INTERNAL SECURITY - COMMUNIST
- SMITH ACT OF 1940

Henry Winston was one of the eleven functionaries
of the Communist Party, USA, who were convicted on Gctober
14, 1949, on a charge of conspiracy to teach and advocate the
violent overthrow of the United States Government in violation
of the Smith Act of 1940. Sentenced to five years in prison
and fined $106,000, Winston failed to surrender on July 2, 1951
to begin serving his sentence. He surrendered on March 5, 1956,
and received an additional three-year contempt sentence, both
Eat psa to be served in the U. S. Penitentiary at Terre Haute,
ndiana.

Since that time, the Communist Farty, USA, has been
conducting a continuous campaign to effect Winston's release
either through parole, executive clemency or amnesty. Recently,
this campaign was accelerated because Winston was alleged to be
suffering from a brain tumor. On January 22, 1960, Winston was
transferred to the U. S. Medical Center, Springfield, Missouri,
where the presence of the brain tumor was confirmed. On January
30, 1960, he’ was removed under guard to the Montefiore Hospital,
New York City, where he underwent surgery on February 2, 1960.
The tumor was removed but as yet there has been no statement
as to malignancy, The last hospital bulletin indicates his
condition is satisfactory and his eyesight is improving.

On January 26, 1960, a parole hearing for Winston was
held before the U. S. Board of Parole in Washington, D. C., and
several known Communists and Communist sympathizers appeared at
this hearing in Winston's behalf. Since the attorney representing
Winston claimed that his briefcase containing petitions and
Signatures had been stolen, the Farole Board agreed to postpone
the hearing for one week to enable him to duplicate the petitions.

Among the individuals appearing at the Parole hearing
was Reverend Elder’ G. Hawkins of New York City, a strong
supporter of Communist front organizations. Bureau files show
that since 1940, Rev. Hawkins has been affiliated with, or has
lent support to, ten organizations designated by the Attorney
General pursuant to Sxecutive Order 10450, as weli as three
other Communist front organizations. Following Rev. Hawkins
return to New York, information was received that he plans to
contact»eReverend sdward L. R, Elson, the Fresident's minister,
to urge Rev. Ulson to talk with the Fresident regarding the
possibility of a full parolo for Winston. It was indicated that
although Rev. “lson may not want to yiéld, Rev. Hawkins will
"put the pressure on." (Liaison has been instructed to advise
Rev. Ulson of this possible contact by Rev. Hawkins and to
confidentially advisc him of Havkins' subversive background.)

member in the "family" of "Commission" member Steve Magaddino,
and operates a major loan-shark racket in the Buffalo area on
behalf of Joseph Fino, the “underboss" of the Magaddino family.
On 4/23/69, the Attorney General approved a recommendation for
microphone and technical surveillance at two of Billiteri's
key locations where this illegal activity is carried on. The
Attorney General authorized a Department Attorney to handle
the filing of affidavits with the Federal court.in Buffalo,
New York, to obtain the necessary court order for the
electronic surveillance sought, pursuant to Title 3 of the
Omnibus Crime Bill. The Department Attorney, in conjunction
with our Buffalo office, was to make application to the court

Agent. This is the first such application we have made
pursuant to the provisions of Title 3.

MANHATTAN JOINT STRIKE FORCE

The Department has proposed a strike force with the
stated objective of making a concentrated drive against
organized crime in the borough of Manhattan in New York City.
This apparently has been enlarged to include the Bronx in
view of the inclusion of the Bronx County District Attorney
on the Strike Force Council. This strike force is to be
composed of Department Attorneys, members of the staffs of
the District Attorneys of New York and Bronx Counties, members
of the New York City Police Department and investigators from

ANTIRIOT LAWS

Chicago Cases

On March 20, 1969, the Federal Grand Jury at Chicago,
Illinois, based upon extensive Bureau investigations, returned
indictments against seven leaders of the New Left and one leader
of the Black Panther Party all of whom were charged with
Antiriot Laws violations in connection with the Chicago disturbances
at the time of the Democratic National Convention, Trial has been
set for September 24, 1969.

San Francisco Case

After extensive FBI investigation the Department commenced
grand jury proceedings on April 23, 1969, at San Francisco in
connection with Antiriot Laws violations allegedly committed by
three Black Panthers who gave instructions in the use of firearms
and explosives during a conference held by the Black Panther Party
in San Francisco last November.

Philadelphia Case

We have conducted extensive investigation into Antiriot
Laws violations in connection with the Black Power Conference held
in Philadelphia in August and September, 1968. Approximately 3, 000
to 4, 000 Negroes from all over the country attended this conference
during which five subjects provided instruction in the use of firearms
and explosives for a closed mieeting of approximately 70 persons.

Inauguration Disturbances : is

On April 18, 1969, the Department requested investigation of
fifteen subjects who allegedly came to Washington, D. C., on inauguration
day for the purpose of creating disorders. This investigation is being
conducted on an expedite basis.

Campus Disorders

At the present time there are also a number of Antiriot Laws
‘investigations being conducted with regard to recent campus disorders,



most notably at Brandeis University where two professors from San
Francisco State College allegedly contributed to the seizing of the -
Administration Building on January 8, 1969, and American University,
Washington, D. C., where members of the Students for a Democratic
Society allegedly traveled to Washington, D. C., and participated in
seizing a building on the campus on April 23, 1969.

INTERSTATE TRANSPORTATION
OF-STOLEN MOTOR VEHICLE
INVESTIGATIONS (DYER ACT)

In the fall of 1967, the former Attorney General and his
staff held conferences with various United States Attorneys (USA)
here in Washington, D. C. Following these conferences, we learned
of a divergence of opinion among USAs concerning the Department's
views in prosecuting Interstate Transportation of Stolen Motor Vehicle
(ITSMV) cases. Some had the opinion that only automobile theft ring
cases should be prosecuted in Federal court while others were of the
opinion that only cases having commercial aspects should be considered
for such prosecution. Other USAs felt only cases possessing aggravated
circumstances should be considered. Some continue to consider -each
case on its individual merits. During the period October, 1967,
through May, 1968, we wrote four letters to the former Attorney
General requesting the Department's views concerning the prosecution
of these cases. Ina letter dated April 12, 1968, to the Department,
we set forth our views that prosecution of Dyer Act cases in Federal
court should not be restricted to commercial matters and to adults,
but rather that each case should be considered on its individual merits.
None of these letters were answered. On March 5, 1969, we wrote the
present Attorney General informing him of the divergence of opinion among
USAs. This letter also requested the Attorney General furnish us his
views concerning this matter; however, an answer has not been received
to date. :

UNIVERSAL FIBREGLASS CORPORATION
FRAUD AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT

Following a partial audit by General Services
Administration, we instituted an investigation, at Depart-
ment's request, of alleged overcharges to the Government by
Universal Fibreglass Corporation (Universal) on a $13 million
contract to produce mail delivery trucks. All logical investi-
gation has been completed and reported except the review of the
Universal records. Access to the pertinent records was recently
achieved through court action and an extensive audit is now
being pressed. Criminal prosecution of several subjects is
now indicated.

Congressman H. R. Gross (R-Idowa) has publicized
this matter. Press items have indicated that the office of
then Senator Hubert H. Humphries may have been instrumental
in having the contract awarded to Universal.

“ by Labor Department to help underprivileged youths, to
identify individuals participating in payroll padding in
violation of Fraud Against the Government Statutes. Grand

of dollars in overcharges fo the Navy were channeled by subjects
into Swiss bank accounts. On August 7, 1968, two corporations
and four individuals, including Francis Rosenbaum, a Washington,
D. C., tax attorney, were indicted in Washington, D. C., on
charges of conspiring to defraud the Government of more than
$4 million. Trial date is set for September 8, 1969. On

INTERSTATE TRANSPORTATION OF

STOLEN PROPERTY (ITSP)

THEFT FROM INTERSTATE SHIPMENT (TFIS)
CONSPIRACY

Captioned investigation concerns theft ring operating at
John F. Kennedy International Airport, New York City. Special
Prosecutor Daniel P. Hollman, Department of Justice Task Force, is
presenting evidence to Federal Grand Jury wherein 15 to 17 indictments
anticipated probably April 30, 1969. Organized Crime Section of the
Department of Justice and Attorney General Mitchell particularly interested.

In October, 1968, four individuals, including Steinschreiber
and Mario Alessi, were arrested by the FBI in connection with theft of
drugs. Since that time, Alessi, a Pan American Airways cargo
supervisor, has been cooperating and named others in connection with
pharmaceutical thefts amounting to over $100,000, as well as a series of
general merchandise thefts, such as furs, jewelry, and firearms
probably in excess of $250,000 involved. Alessi has identified Raymond
Wood, U. S. Customs Examiner, as being involved. Wood has been
interviewed, but denies complicity. Customs Agency has been apprised
of Wood's alleged involvement.

This Bureau has long been aware of the serious problems of
thievery at airports in the New York metropolitan area, particularly at
John F. Kennedy International Airport. Special Agents of this Bureau are
assigned on the scene at that airport and are actively handling investigations

* of violations within our jurisdiction. In performing our duties, we enjoy
close working cooperation with other law enforcement agencies, with
the airlines, and with the Airport Security Council formed in 1968 to
cope with these problems.

Recent newspaper publicity has indicated a definite interest

& of Africa, which at the present time are in the throes of various
nationalist moves. On 11-16-60 an article appeared in the Madrid
daily newspaper “A.B.C." which stated the Moroccan Government had
announced the acceptance of Soviet military aid. On 11-22-60 the .~
same newspaper reported a Moroccan military mission was departing ast
Morocco for Moscow on that date to discuss Soviet military aid. The}
same newspaper reported on the same date that a good-will mission ~ +>
from Morocco had been received by Khrushchev in Moscow. A United ,
Press International release dated 12-5-60 stated that Morocco may *x
soon demand removal of all United States and French military bases»

on her territory.

Madrid papers in October, 1960, related that Moroccan
labor unions, which are communist infiltrated, planned to send
representatives to Cuba and the same unions are urging the Moroccan
Government to disband the Royal Moroccan Army and set up Castro-type
militias.

JEK Act 5 (g) (2) (D)

The Republic of the Gongo obtained its freedom from Belgiun

_ tn 1960 and since that time has been involved in a political turmoil

«, between opposing factions. The procommunist - pro-Soviet faction was
represented by Patrice Lumumba who was killed in the Republic of the
Congo during February, 1961. As a result of his death, procommunist
and anti-Western demonstrations were held in the United States and in
many countries of the world. Lumunba's Lieutenant Antoine Gizengay,
who is pro-Soviet, has assumed Lumumba's position with the dissident
group. In view of critical political situation existing in the Republi
of the Congo and the fact that Soviet Russia and other pro-Soviet -
African countries (Ghana, Mali and Guinea) are supporting the

pro-Gizenga faction in the Republic of the Congo, it was believed

There is an additional factor here which warrants
consideration. Mr. U. lexis fonnson, with whom we discussed

this matter at State, has bee' extremely (ooper ate with the

Bureau from time to time. He was particularly helpful in connection
with the opening of the office of the Legal Attache in Manila. in
fact, on our behalf, he exerted pressure on the U.S, Ambassador
there in order to secure his approval of the establishing of the
office. He undoubtedly can be helpful in the future on ‘Such matters.

ADDENDUM BY MR, TOLSON 10/13/61

I am inclined to the view that we should not send the attached
communications to the Attorney General and Deputy Under Secretar:

of State Johnson concerning our proposal 5 (g) (2) 1D)
ith respect to countries in Central and

jouth America. Aiter all, we presented the matter to Mr. Johnson,
indicated what we could do and he, in turn, advised that the requested
clearances would not be granted. It is not the Bureau's basic
responsibility to develop information concerning these foreign countries.
It is obvious that someone in the State Department to whom Johnson has
talked is opposed to our doing this. We have been told that if there is
a specific country or individual involved and a request was made by the
Bureau, consideration would be given to such a request. I think that we
should let the matter stand on that basis.

tee Mr. Belmont does not agree. This matter presently rests on
: an oral basis only and he feels that we should be on record.

State Department "Secret" Research Memorandum RFE~36, dated
6-17-64 on "Communist China's Policy for Establishing Diplomatic Relations,"
reports that Peiping's interest in expanding its network of diplomatic

ties has significantly increased in past three years, Communist China now
has diplomatic relations with 48 countries and, because of its recent
successes and continued intensive efforts, it may soon overtake

Nationalist China which has recognized 60 countries, According to the
memorandum, this is liable to have immense effect on Chinese representation
in international organizations, particularly the United Nations (UN).
According to State Department, Japan is the number one target on!

Communist China's diplomatic horizon and an intensive step-by-step
cultivation of Japan is under way, CIA's “Secret" Special/Repoyt, "The
China Problem in Japanese Politics," dated 5-1-64, reports: th: in Japan
supporters of the Japanese Government feel that developmehty of Japan's ‘
informal relations will ripen into full-fledged diplomatyic relations with

Communist China. .
x

The fact that trade between Japan and Communist China is on the )\.

increase certainly can be expected to encourage establishment of Q

diplomatic relations between these countries in the not too far distant
future. In 1963, this trade increased 60 per cent over 1962 and it is
expected to take another big jump in 1964, Further, the Communist Party
of Japan (CPJ) is urging close ties with China. This organization of
approxim.tely 105,000 members has taken the side of Communist China te rae
ideological war with the USSR, arqpenanee “

According to articles in the 7/9 and 19/64 issues of "The

[new York Times," the Japanese Government is not as strong now as in
preceding years. Prestige of its Premier, Hayato Ikeda, re-elected
to a third term 7-10-64, has been damaged by inflationary trends that
have sent consumer prices up 20 per cent in past three years. His new
cabinet has been called “weak" and "lightweight" due to his attempts to

- achieve balance among feuding elements in his own Liberal Democratic
Party.

le Japan is also buffeted by pressures from the USSR with which

it has rather extensive trade relations, On 5-14-64, the USSR's First
Deputy Premier, Anastas Mikoyan, made a surprise "good will" visit to
Japan. He and members of his group met with Premier Ikeda and other

whighly placed Japanese officials. Real purpose behind his visit is
unknown, Some claim his aim was merely an expansion of trade. Others
believe USSR felt the trip was necessary so as to reinforce Russia's
position with Japan because of increased relations between Japan and China;

OBSERVATIONS ;

Industrially, Japan is the leading power in Asia and it wields
i considerable influence on lesser Asiatic countries. Capitulation by
Japan to pressures of Communist China could have significant effect on
such countries, possibly hastening their own recognition of Communist China
and also the ultimate admission of Communist China to UN. We should do
what we can to make available to State Department and other interested
agencies, any information which would enable them to take app
steps. It is, therefore, recommended

NATIONALITY GROUP COVERAGE ~ JAPAN
is - JAPAN — pate

This is to earase that there are reportedly five
thousand Japanese iti in the New
York City area,

it is felt that the Bureau, at this time,
wight consider authorizing the institution of nationality

.group coverage concerning Japan to further implement our

current coverage. It is felt that with recent overtures from

the Soviet Union regarding trade and cultural exchanges with
Japan and, more important, trade relations being further

extended between Japan and Red China that for these reasons
Japanese coverage should be extended,

In view of the above, it is requested that authority be granted-
_ to institute nationality group coverage concerning Japan.

At the present time, the Algerian Government, headed by ~O
Premier Ahmed Be ella, is receiving military aid and assistance from <*
the Sovicnloe tite, Algerian military personnel are also receiving
military training in those countries. The Algerian Communist Party,
| # which supported Ben Bella’s party in its fight against the French for
Algerian independence, is gaining in numbers and influence. It would
appear that intelligence information relating to Algerian activities SB
both in the United States and abroad is of definite interest to the U.S.
Government in view of Algeria’s rising influence in North African a
political and military matters.

Consul, Kingston, recently made an urgent request of Havana
for financial help to Ras Tafarians. In December, 1965, it
was reported that Jamaica had received offers of aid from
Soviet-bloc countries (not further defined) and recently
Jamaican business firms were said to be planning to circumvent
restrictions on trade with Cuba in connection with the
proposed sale of sugar refining machinery to Cuba.

Dear Mre Hoover:

On occasion it has proved important in connection with United S
interests in and relations with the other American Republics to obtain
intelligence information on activities taking place within the United
Statese Specifically, it is important that the Department keep track of
the movements-and contacts of selected Latin Americans while in this
country when there are reasons to believe that subversive activities
directed at the other Governments of ‘this Hemisphere are being planned
and coordinated heres Such activities are against the national interests
of the United States in so far as they may result in developments which
could endanger United States lives, threaten United States business
interests and cause friction within the inter-American systems

In the past the FBI has always cooperated in furnishing the Department
in specific Latin American cases with information available from estab-
lished sources, but it has shown understandable reluctance to become in-
volved to the extent of conducting direct surveillance in cases where
there is no evidence of nor reason to suspect subversive activities
directed against the United States or violation of United States lawse
It is felt that while this information is helpful, it does not completely
fill the gap in the intelligence information important in the condwst of
foreign relations. It is understood that the CIA, while interested in
foreign intelligence, does not carry out surveillence operations within
the confines of the United States

It would be most appreciated if you could express an opinion as to a
how surveillance of selected Latin American visitors to this country might {*
be arranged on an individual case basise =; :

fn identical letter is being sent to the CIA in the hope that a

coordinated approach can be madee-

~of manpower and in most cases more information can be obtained through i

Reference is made to ydur letter of Ocbober 10, 1955,
which notes that it is immortent for the Department of State to
keep track of the movemonts and contacts of selected Latin
Amsricans while in this country when there are reasons to believe
thet subversive activitios directed at the other jeovernments of
this hemisphere are beiny plasued and coordinated in this counury.
Your letter also notes that this Rureau has shown an understands
alle reluctance to conwuet direct surveillance of such Letin
Americans whore there is no evidence of nor reason to suspect
aubversive autivitios directed against the United States or
violation of United States laws. You requested an opinion os to
how surveillences of selected Latin American visitors to this
;eountry might be arranged on &) individual case basis.

when there is creditable information available indicating
that subversive activities directcd ot other governments of this
hemisphere are being planned and coordinated in the United States,
the FBI takes prempt investizative action in view of the probability
of violations of the registration or neubrality provisions of 7
United States laws. In conducting these investigations all Logical. |
investigative techniques are used, including physical survelliances
where circumstances would warrant. Full-time physical surveillances
require a tremendous expenditure of manpower, however, and are = *
practicable only in connection with some phases of highly important |
cases in the security or criminal fields. In the greater majority Pp oF]

Dear Mr. Murphy:

Reference is made to your letter of 10 October 1955, relative to
the problem of conducting surveillance of certain Latin American
nationals who might be suspected of carrying on subversive activities

b* in the United States, directed against Latin American countries. In
thie vegard you are correct in your understanding that the CIA does - ~
not conduct such surveiliances within the confines of the United States,
Mr. Hoover has furnished me a’copy of his veply to your inquiry setting
forth the FBI's jurisdiction and responsibilities in this matter,

We have been furnishing to the Department and to the FBI such
intelligence information as we have obtained through our operations
abroad bearing upon possible subversive activities of the type of per-
gon you describe, as such information became available tous. It
would also be helpful if we could receive from time to time from the
Department, leads which you mzy receive and which we could possibly

+ follow up in the Latin American country against which subversive
activities are being carried on. .

In order to assist ue in developing our coverage of this field, we
would suggest that you designate someone in the Department of State
who could confer with the appropriate persous in this Agency, and if
you will let me know whom you will designate for this purpose, I will
arrange to put him in touch with my representative. Also, if you see
no objection, I will mention this matter to the ‘members of 1 the IAC

to the ‘the Soc ént!

A copy of this reply is being sent to Mr, Hoover.

Sincerely, “6 ot

MEMORANDUM TO BOARDMAN FROM BELMONT

OBSERVATIONS (continued)

Ss Certainly, there are dangers involved in any attempt to
cover official establishments of "friendly" foreign countries.
Coverage would have to be most discreet. We could not even
attempt to. utilize the same type of extensive coverage we

| have on the Soviet bloce

G. If we went into a program df this nature, we would haye to
have funds. Regardless of how limited the coverage is,
will take money.

Zo A program of this nature should be run by and within the
| Scontrod of the Bureaus however, tt should have the bjessings
of high officials outside the Bureau and, particulayly, the
| endorsement of the State Deparimente

RECOMMENDATIONS ¢
de

fron
| eine an on @ highly restricted basis--nemely, by 71

wire taps and, where possible with full security,
coverage, on selected foreign establishments. Ine
these establishments would be embassies and consulates, and
delegations to the United Nations. The selection of the
countries to be covered will be based on those indicated by
the State Department to be "problem children" or the nost
fruitful potential sources of intelligence. Any further
coverage beyond technical and microphone coverage will depend
on what leads are developed through these sources and what
can be done on a most discreet basis. We will continue our
Anagram Program and will continue our efforts to develop
informants within these establishments when such action can
be done discreetlye

Dear Mr. Hoover:

I wish to thank you for your letter of October 14, 1955 in
which you’ stated that there is no reluctance on the part of the
-FBI to conduct physical surveillance of selected Latin American
visitors to this country where the circumstances warrant such
action. Your assurances that every effort will be made in these
cases to. develop those aspects which may be of particular inter-
~ est to the Departzent of State and that consideration will be
*. given to the utilization of a physical surveillance when requested
by the Department of State where it is agreed that this type of
coverage is warranted and necessary, should prove helpful in
handling these cases in the future,

Yhen the Department of State has reason to believe that visit-
ing Latin Americans may be engaged in plenning and coordinating
subversive’ activities directed at other governments of this
hemisphere, such information will be brought to the attention of
the FBI through established channels as heretofore, together 7
with an explanation of the Department*s objectives and requirements,

= order that an appropriate investigation may be initiated.

' The continued cooperation of “the FBI is’ greatly appreciated.

Afghanistan, about size of Texas, is landlocked country in
Middle East, surrounded by USSR (north), Pakistan (south and east) and
Tran (west). ‘Traditionally, she has advantageously played off one great
nation against another, At Intelligence Advisory Comittee (IAC) meetii
11/29/55, possibility of Afghanistan gredually falling into Soviet contro:
was discussed. IAC group of. opinion that Soviet Government able to offer
considerable edvantages to Afghanistan through trade routes bypassing
Pakigten, traditional rival ef Afghanistan with which Afghanistan is having
difficulties, and through possible financial and military suppert. As
result, it was felt there is strong possibility Afghanistan will gradually
fall within Sovies control, although ostensibly remaining sovereign state,

Afghanistan maintains Embascy in Washington, D. C., Consulate
in New York City, and honorary consul in Sen Francisco. No information
received Afghan officials in US engaged in political or subversive
activities. During last 4 years no information received any Afghan groups
in US engaged in subversive activities, No Afghan nationals on Security
Index, In event Soviet economic gains in Afghanistan lead to political
control of country, we would heve to consider giving comparable coverage
to Afghan diplematic establishments and official personnel as now given to
Soviet satellita official establishments.

7 Tf Afghenistan becomes openly pre-Soviet, we would have to =
consider dangerousness of Afghan nationals in US as regards internal security if

Sound counterintelligence coverage requires sources to
produce not only investigative data but also intelligence data of
value to us and other agencies in guiding policy and making
decisions. Bureau is expected to produce intelligence data and
we can anticipate criticism as well as operational moves by other
agencies to fill vacuum if our operations do not produce necessary
data. Sound source programs are based on long-range planning and
require foruard thinking to get results. Scrambling for sources
in reaction to problems is too late and ineffective.

UFO on 8-8-58 advised that since the revolution in rors)
Venezuela in January, 1958, the country has been ruled by a Junta. er
Newspaper media since the revolution have reported periodically that
individuals who were political exiles during the regime of liarcos Perez
Jimenez have been allowed to return to Venezuela and pursue their ™.,
former political activities. ~

It has become apparent from daily news stories that
Venezuela is presently in a state of political upheaval. Although
the leader of the Junta, Admiral Larrazabal, has stated he has no
political aspirations it has been pointed out by correspondents that
he has recently given indication of this by touring the country and
"wooing" the support of the communists. This reportedly has been
done by statements attributed to Larrazabal that he could not conceive
of @ Venezuelan communist being controlled by the USSR since all
Venezuelans are inherently patriotic and loyal to Venezuela. Jt has
also been pointed out that the comnaunists of Venezuela are being Bt
Dlayed up as the heroes of the recent revolution in that country.
Some correspondents have stated that it is felt there will possibly
be a military coup if the politicians of Venezuela do not soon set up
@ government acceptable to the military leadérs. It is further :
noted that the Vice President and Mrs. Nixon experienced insults
during their tour of Latin America, the most vicious of which
occurred in Venezuela.

ourselves in a position to obtain current intelligence data

concerning the Venezuelan political situation. It is pointed out
7 that there appears to be a possibility of the Venezuelan comnunists

gaining more and more influence and power in that country and, :
therefore, shifting Venezuela to alignment with the Soviet Bloc. WFO
noted that a confidential source has reported on several occasions

KO on 8-22-58 advised that although Brazil's President "has N

recently indicated a stronger stand in favor of the U 3., various news,
media have reported that politically powerful nationalist and leftist

groups do exist in Brazil and that until recently Brazil's President ad\
avoided offending such groups. \

Lager
Anti-t S. feelings and demonstrations were exhibited in Brazil
during the South American trip of Vice President and Mrs. Nixon and
although the demonstrations did not attain the violence exhibited in some
of the other South American countries, the demonstrations indicated tne
work of well-organized group or groups opposed to the U. Se

} JFK Act 5 (g) (2) (D)

On 7-8-58, Wilson Velloso, Press Attache, Brazilian Embassy,
who admitted former membership in the Communist Party of Brazil, upon
interview at his request, stated that he had attempted to discuss

Communist Party activities with Brazilian officials but they indie eq
indifference to such information in 1951.

‘Velloso supposed the reason for the indifference was thdt tis
information was common knowledge; however, another explanation would be
sanction of the Communist Party on the part of Brazilian officials, even
\ though the Communist Party has been outlawed there. Velloso stated he
knew of no communist influence at the Brazilian Embassy but stated that
tt was the tendency of Latin American countries at this time to play
communist countries against noncommunist countries in an effort to
obtain all they could in the nature of aid and assistance, inferring
that the Brazilian Embassy would also attempt ‘this practice. Velloso
commented that he did not believe that sueh negotiations on the part of

Latin American countries necessarily indicated hada Shayawenee ra

In view of the above information, it would appear that Brazil
loousa easily align itself with the Soviet-bloc countries and thereby
create an international situation affecting the U. S. While there is
no apparent indication at this time of a political upheaval in Brazil,
Brazil's President's recent opposition to the nationalist and leftist
groups in Brazil might tend to develop internal strife in Brazil,
leading to such an upheaval.

Reference is made to information recently furnished to
the Bureau by a highly sensitive source being handled by the me.

Washington Field Office (WFO) indicating that Soviet and sotillite
intelligence representatives have a keen. interest in assistance being
rendered by our "friends." The were referring to attaches from
India, Indonesia, and United Arab Republic who apparently have been
collecting certain types of information for the Soviet and satelli
representatives. SA
fe SY
The foregoing again confirms that the Soviets and the _ *. i
satellites realize that representatives of noncommunist diplomatic “Cat
establishments can be of tremendous value to them. Naturally, a ¢ os.
representative of the Indian Embassy has access to U. S. institutions
and areas not usually accessible to the Soutets and satellites.
Furthermore, a representative of such an embassy can miz in circles
and have access to Americans and others without being placed under
any particular suspicions. If such an indiutdual is recruited by
: the Soviets, he can operate with an excellent covers;:. We previously
' have seen instances where the Soviets have taken an interest in
: representatives of Latin American countries apparently for the purpose
of recruiting them as agents.

Yhe Bureau feels the above program is essential
in view of the strategie location of Fhailand and tits
proximity to Communist China and Laos, the current area
of political unrest. It is felt sources developed within
diplomatic establishments of Tnatland could furnish pertinent
information regarding political conditions and political
trends in Southeast «sia which would be of considerable
interest to other U. S. Government agencies.

in regard to Ruth Naomi Burney, #F0 should open
@ seperate 134 investigation on her to develop additional
background information as required in Section 107 of the
fienual of Instructions to make certain she is type of person
we went to contact as a source. If the investigation is
Fuvorable, submit your request to the Bureau for State
Department clearance to interview here Bear in mind that

when Burney is of no further tnterest to us, the Bureau
should so advise CIA, 7

Bufiles fail te discloge any pertinent derogatory
information identifiable with Ruth Naomi Burney.

ae Since State Department ache raeh Hapa lehihe pe ohtaine
ureau to institute a program in aeve y
Aaa ania Phailand diplomatic establishments in the Ue Ses
WO and New York being so advised. State Department also
furnished clearance for very discreet investigations of
potential sources which we will select. In view of the
information received from CIA via liaison regarding Burney,

There is an “Mexisito factor here which warrants

with the opening of the office of the Legal Attache in Manila. Ina
fact, on our behalf, he exerted pressure on the U.S. Ambassador
theré in order to secure his approval ef the establishing of the
office. He undoubtedly can be helpful in the future on such matters.

For the above reasons it is believed highly desirable to

ADDENDUM BY MR, TOLSON 10/13/61

Tam inclined to the view that we should not send the attached
communications to the Attorney General and Deputy Under Secretar’
of State Johnson concerning our proposal

JFK Act 5 (g) (2) (D) with respect to countries in Central and

South America. After all, we presented the matter to Mr. Johnson,
indicated what we could do and he, in turn, advised that the requested
clearances would not be granted. It is not the Bureau's basic
responsibility to develop information concerning x these foreign countries,
It is obvious that someone in the State Department to whom Johnson has
talked is opposed to our doing this. We have been told that if there is
a specific country or individual involved and a request was made by the
Bureau, consideration would be given to such a request. I think that we
should let the matter stand on that basis.

Mr. Belmont does not agree. This matter presently rests on
an 1 oral basis only and he feels that we should be on record. :

kd State Department "Secret" Research Memorandum RFE-36, dated
6-17-64 on "Communist China's Policy for Establishing Diplomatic Relations,"
reports that Peiping's interest in expanding its network of diplomatic

ties has significantly increased in past three years. Communist China now
has diplomatic relations with 48 countries and, because of its recent
successes and continued intensive efforts, it may soon overtake

Nationalist China which has recognized 60 countries. According to the
memorandum, this is liable to have immense effect on Chinese representation
in international organizations, particularly the United Nations (UN).
According to State Department, Japan. is the number one target on!

Communist China's diplomatic horizon and an intensive step-by-step
cultivation of Japan is under way. CIA's "Secret" Special/ Report, "The
China Problem in Japanese Politics," dated 5-1-64, reports: oh in Japan
supporters of the Japanese Government feel that developmehtyof Japan's
informal relations will ripen into full-fledged diplomatjic relations with
Communist China.

The fact that trade between Japan and Communist China is on the
increase certainly can be expected to encourage establishment of \
diplomatic relations between these countries in the not too far distant
future, In 1963, this trade increased 60 per cent over 1962 and it is ane
expected to take another big jump in 1964, Further, the Communist Party \
of Japan (CPJ) is urging close ties with China. This organization of
approximately 105,000 members has taken the side of Communist China in its
ideological war with the USSR, : eal

According to articles in the 7/9 and 19/64 issues of "The
New York Times," the Japanese Government is not as strong now as in
preceding years. Prestige of its Premier, Hayato Ikeda, re-elected
to a third term 7-10-64, has been damaged by inflationary trends that
have sent consumer prices up 20 per cent in past three years. His new
cabinet has been called "weak" and “lightweight" due to his attempts to
achieve balance among feuding elements in his own Liberal Democratic
Party.

dapan is also buffeted by pressures from the USSR with which
lat has rather extensive trade relations, On 5~14-64, the USSR's First
Deputy Premier, Anastas Mikoyan, made a surprise "good will" visit to
Japan. He and members of his group met with Premier Ikeda and other
wbighly placed Japanese officials, Real purpose behind his visit is
“unknown. Some claim his aim was merely an expansion of trade. Others
-believe USSR felt the trip was necessary so as to reinforce Russia's
position with Japan because of increased relations between Japan and China.

OBSERVATIONS:

Industrially, Japan is the leading power in Asia and it wields

considerable influence on lesser Asiatic countries, Capitulation by

Japan to pressures of Communist China could have significant effect on

such countries, possibly hastening their own recognition of Communist China
and also the ultimate admission of Communist China to UN, We should do
what we can to make available to State Department and other interested
agencies, any information which would enable them to take appropriate
steps. It is, therefore, recomm

disorders posing a substantial threat to the existing

Government. There has been significant strengthening of : aon
subversive, communist and anti-Government forces within the TF. jee
country. Increasing inability of Government and police to a

cope with severe unrest has precipitated urgent plea for

Consulate of Cuba in Kingston is focal point for procommunist i

receiving guidance and assistance from Cuban Consul, and is
preparing to become spearhead for sabotage and terrorism.
ycO has established training base in Jamaica and in mid-June
made unsuccessful attempt to dynamite a major Government

Consul, Kingston, recently made an urgent request of Havana
for financial help to Ras Tafarians. In December, 1965, it
was reported that Jamaica had received offers of aid from
Soviet-bloc countries (not further defined) and recently
Jamaican business firms were said to be planning to circumvent
restrictions on trade with Cuba in connection with the
proposed sale of sugar refining machinery to Cuba.
