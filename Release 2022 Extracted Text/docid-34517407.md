1. (0X Subject's name was brought to the attention of this Station by

Mr. John Lucy, CAS, on temporary duty with CAS Team, San Juan, P.R. Lucy

stated that recently he had interviewed subject in Washington, D.C. During

the course of the interview, subject withdrew a business card from his wallet

stating that the name on the business card was that of an OACSI representative

2. [S2 Lucy described subject as a Cuban refugee who posed a threat to

their operations because of his violence, and the possibility that subject might

attempt to cause a demonstration which would be embarrassing to their interests,

3. 86X Organt, 501, 502, and 504 state that name is familiar, but no

personal association with

subject is clained.

504 believes that subject was

associated with Autoboat. Organt recalls subject as a fund raiser for a Cuban

refugee organization who may have been associated with an OACSI project.

4. (8) Luey has been advised that we do not have contact with subject. He

has also been given the G2, Anton file on subject.

Lucy was specifically told

that we desired to know what the name of the individual was that subject alleged

was known to him as an OACSI representative under commercial cover in San Juan.

Luey promised to do this upon return to Washington, D.l.

5. Tc The purpose of this D/F is to advise you of the above, and to insure

that Lucy complies with our request at a later date.
