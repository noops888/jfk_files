secretary and Deputy Secretary of Defense, on 6/25/75!

On the late afternoon of 7/24/75, Mr. Benson

Buffham, Deputy Director, National Security Agency (NSA),

made available to Liaison Agent Brian Murphy a copy of a

"Top Secret" memorandum dated 4/20/71, written by Louis W.

Tordella, who was the then Deputy Director of NSA. This

Memorandum for the Record, Subject: Shamrock, copy of which

is attached, makes reference to a file entitled Shamrock

avaifable in the office of the Assistant Chief of Staff for

Intelligence, United States Army.

Pursuant to your instructions on the evening of

7/24/75, I personally contacted Mr. Latimer at approximately

8:00 a.m., 7/25/75. In my conversation with Mr. Latimer, I

noted that it was imperative that I see him as soon as

possible regarding the contents of the Shamrock file.

Mr. Latimer was informed that the Bureau was attempting to

establish the line of authority relative to the Bureau's

procurement of foreign government's cable traffic sent

through international cable companies in the United States.

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall

Re: Senstudy 75

62-116395

He advised me he would have somebody from the General Counsel's

office, Department of Defense, promptly contact me regarding

a review of this file by FBI personnel.

Not hearing from Mr. Latimer by the late morning

of 7/25/75, I telephonically contacted his office. He was

not available and I asked his secretary to have him return

my call. Shortly before noon, Mr. Latimer returned my call

and explained that he had discussed my request with

Mr. "Marty" Hoffman (phonetic) of the Department of Defense.

It was Latimer's understanding that Mr. Hoffman had gone to

the White House to discuss my request with Mr. Philip Buchen,

Counsel to the President. Latimer promised that he would

telephonically recontact me as soon as he could establish

contact with Hoffman.

I again reiterated to Latimer that it

was imperative the Bureau have access to the Shamrock file

in order that we could advise the Attorney General as to

its contents hoping to clearly demonstrate that both the

then Attorney General Thomas Clark and, in fact, President

Truman himself were aware of certain information contained

in the Shamrock file.

Mr. Latimer said he understood clearly

what was at issue here and that he would get back to me as

soon as possible.

At 1:50 p.m., 7/25/75, I again called Mr. Latimer's

office and his secretary informed me that Mr. Latimer had

stepped out of his office and that she would give him a

message to call me as soon as he returned. As of 4:00 p.M.,

7/25/75, I had not received a return call from Mr. Latimer.

ACTION:

For information and record purposes.

+2945780

Mr. Buffham and I had an opportunity this morning to read

the SHAMROCK file in ACSI. Major General Joe! McChristian gave

us permission to view it but

f, once we had read it, after careful con-

sideration he decided that he would not feel free to give NSA either

the file or a duplicate copy without personal permission from SecDef

inasmuch as SecDef had entrusted the file to ACSI in 1949. All of

us agreed that an approach to the Secretary would be unnecessary

and perhaps would generate too many questions. He did agree

after sealing the file again to limit access to the Secretary of Defense

on demand, the Director or the Deputy Director, NSA, on demand,

the o hide envelse.

and the Chief of the SSO, ACSI. This trowed le noted on

The file contained memoranda for record, one prepared after

a meeting in Forrestal's office attended by senior officials from ITT,

Western Union, and RCA plus Marks Leva (then Defense General

Counsel), Secretary Forrestal, and a representative from the Attorney

General's office. Colonel Carter Clark from ACSI, who was present,

prepared this memorandum. A subsequent meeting was held in Secre-

tary Louis Johnson's office attended by representatives. of the same

three companies and I believe the Attorney General himself. In Mr.

• Johnson's own handwriting is a note to the effect that he showed the

memorandum for record to President Truman and a note that TCC, ap-

parently Attorney General Thomas Clark, either was present or had

also discussed the matter with the President. Both memoranda indi-

cated that the companies were informed that the work they were doing

was of very great importance to the U.S. and every effort would be

made to protect knowledge of its existence as well as to protect the

companies in the event of exposure.

The material is filed under TS Control No. 516652-3-5 in the

SSO ACSI files.

ROJECT HOGKINGBIRD

Project Mockingbirt, a telephone intercept activity, was conducted

between 12 March 1963 and

15 June 1963, and targeted two Washington-

based newsmen who, at the time, had been publishing news articles

based on, and frequently quoting, classified materials of this Agency

and others, including Top Secret and Special Intelligence.

Telephone intercept connections were installed at the newmen's

office and at each of their homes, for a total of 3. The connections

were established with the assistance of a telephone company official

'who responded to a personal request by the Director of Security, Col.

Sheffield Edwards. Col. Edwards' authority for the activity was Mr.

John A. McCone, Director of Central Intelligence. The latter conducted

the activity in coordination with the Attorney General (Mr. Robert Kennedy),

the Secretary of Defense (Mr. Robert Mclamara), and the Director of

the Defense Intelligence Agency (Gen. Joseph Carroll). In addition to

Office of Security personnel directly involved in the intercepts and

• research of materials acquired therefrom, only 3 other Agency

officials are on record as witting of the activity: the Deputy Director

of Central Intelligence (General MarshallS. Carter), the Inspector

General (Lyman Kirkpatrick) and the General Counsel. (Mr. Lawrence

Houston).

The intercept activity was particularly productive in identifying con-

tacts of the newsmen, their method of operation and many of their sources

of information. For example, it was determined that during the period they

received data from 13 newsmen, 12 of whom were identified; 12 senators

and 6 members of Congress, all identified; 21 Congressional staff members,

of whom 11 were identified; lo government employees, including a staff

member of the White House, members of the Vice President's office, an

Assistant Attorney General, and other well-placed individuals. A number

of other sources were partially or tentatively identified, but the short span

of the activity precluded positive identification. It was observed that through

these contacts the newsmen actually received more classified and official

data than they could use, and passed some of the stories to other newsmen

for release, establishing that many "leaks" appearing under other by-lines

were actually from the sources of the target newsmen.

Since the termination of Project Mockimguird, those materials related

to it which were retained, have been maintained under strict security access

Service and he was brought to this country

After initial interrogation by

representatives of the SR Division,

he was moved to a safe-

house in

Maryland,

where he

was confined and interrogated until 13 August 1965 when

he was moved to a specially constructed "jail"' in a remote

wooded area at ISOLATION. The SR Division was convinced

that he was

a dispatched

agent but even after a long

period of hostile interrogation was unable to prove their

contention and he was confined at ISOLATION in an effort

to convince him to "confess."

This Office together with the Office of General

Counsel

became increasingly concerned with the illegality

of the Agency's position in handling a defector, under

these conditions for such a long period of time.

Strong

representations were made to the

Director (MI.

Helms)-by

this Office, the Office of General Counsel, and the

Legislative

Liaison Counsel, and

on 27 October 196., the

responsibility for his

further handling was transferred

to the Office of Security under the direction of the Députy

Director of Central Intelligence, then Admiral Rufus Taylor.

The Soviet defector

• was moved to a comfortable safehouse in

the Washington area and was interviewed under friendly,

sympathetic conditions by his Security Case Officer, Mr.

Bruce Solle, or more than a year.

In January 1971, the Director approved

a request

from the Director, Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous

Drugs, to provide covert recruitment and security

clearance support to BNDD. This has been accomplished

through the medium of a proprietary of the Office of

Security

operating in

Falls Church, Virginia. Support

includes covert recruitment,

investigation, polygraph,

medical clearance, and training.

It has been divided

into three phases:

(1) A CI operation to place indi-

viduals

in BNDD field offices to monitor any illegal

activities of other BNDD employees; (2) Recruitment

of Chinese or

Spanish speaking covert Agents; and (3)

Recruitment of an individual used as an Agent by BNDD

but actually employed by BNDD, although this fact is

only to the Director and Chief Inspector, BNDD.

In this case, arrangements were made for all pay and

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECI: General: Office of Security Survey

1. At the Director's instruction, and with the concurrence

of the then DD/P, the Office of Security developed informants in

. RID to report on the activities of RID employees on whom security

questions had arisen. This program, which included upwards of a

dozen informants at its peak, has declined to its present level of

three, only one of whom is reporting regularly on matters of current

interest.

2. The principal object of Security's interest through this

informant is

a female who was employed in RID for a number of years

until she resigned in 1969. Her resignation coincided with the initiation

of a security review on her by the Office of Security, but Security does

not know whether the employee was aware of this security review at

the time of her resignation.

3. Security's interest in this employee was occasioned by

reports that she had developed an increasingly intimate acquaintance

with a Cuban national. Reporting by one informant, who was also

being developed by the Cuban, suggested that the Cuban might have

an intelligence interest in the female. The same informant also sub-

sequently reported that the Cuban had numerous other contacts among

clerical and secretarial employees of the Agency. Among these

employees is one girl who works in a biographic section in SB Division.

4. Subsequent to her departure from the Agency, the ex-RID

employee entered into a common-law marital relationship with the

Cuban and joined him as partner in a photographic business. In this

capacity she solicited business among CIA employees, especially

those requiring passport photos. Recently, she and the Cuban sought

to employ Security's informant in this business on a part-time basis.

00053

_IMPSET CL BY_

-NW•65360 Docld:32989624 Page 24

## Page 25

5. Information on the background of the Cuban is fairly extensive,

. but it is inconclusive.

He is known to have been a member of anti-

Castro organizations

this country. There are al

reports that

his mother was imprisoned in Cuba at one time.

Intre are other

episodes in his life that suggest intelligence involvement on his part

with some hostile service, but this is not yet definitely established.

:6. The Office of Security has had at times a second informant

in this case. His reporting has tended to confirm reporting by the

principal informant.

7. There is conclusive evidence that the Cuban expressed

interest in certain 201 files in the Agency, and there are good grounds.

for believing that the RID female employee delivered at least one such

•file to the Cuban while she was still in RID. There is also evidence

that the female employee in SB Division has continued in frequent

contact with her friend, the ex-RID employee, and the Cuban. On

one occasion, she served as intermediary for contact instructions

from the Cuban to O/S's principal informant. The informant has no

knowledge, however, of any other requirements that may have been

levied on or satisfied by the SB employee. Neither does he know of

• the extent of contacts by this couple with other Agency employees

except social contacts.

8.

The Office of Security has been running this operation for

over two years, in an effort to obtain conclusive proof of its intelli-

gence nature.

CI Staff has been kept informed. The FBI, which

was informed of the case at an early stage, has declined to take re-

sponsibility for it, on grounds that it concerns CIA's internal security.

As a result, the Office ofSecurity has been inhibited in the actions

it can take against the Cuban suspect. On the other hand, Security

has not taken any action against Agency employees for fear of com-

promising the operation.

9. It would appear to me that the Office of Security has dallied

with this case long enough. Apparently unable through positive measures

to resolve doubts about the case, O/S has followed, the course of watch-

ful waiting, hoping the Cuban would take precipitant action himself that

would give us the evidence we seek. In the meantime, our knowledge

of the relationship between the Cuban and the several other current

Agency employees with whom he is known to have contact continues

- 2-

000G3

NW 65360 Docld:32989624 Page 25

---

## Page 26

to be quite limited. Neither the Cuban nor his girlfriend have made

any further approaches to Security's informant recently, although he

• continues to see them

ocially. Thus, there is slir

reason to believe

that further waiting will produce a break in the case.

10. There are two courses open to the Office of Security now.

It can attempt to have the Agency employees known to be in contact

with the Cuban transferred to nonsensitive positions. This might

alert the Cuban to our penetration of the operation, particularly

since a plausible reason ior transier would be difficult to develop

for some of the persons involved. Alternatively, Security could

move overtly and charge the Agency employees with violation of the

security regulation requiring reporting of contacts with foreign

nationals. This would, of course, terminate the Office of Security's

operation.

1l. One of these courses of action should be chosen promptly.

The possibility that the employee in SB Division may be passing

information on

1s too great to warrant further

delay in moving against her. Moreover, it is possible that the Cuban

has current productive penctrations of RID. Thus, the risk of damage

to the Agency seems clearly to outweigh any. possible gains from

continuing this Cl effort.

SUBJECT

, Press Allegations re Use of Agency

Polygraph

• 1.

:This memorandum is for your information only

and confirns a report I made to you by telephone earlier

today.

2. On 22 July 1971, an article was carried on

American proposals rclative

to the SALT talks in The New

York Times over the by-line of Iden 181.

It was

devastatingly accurate

and contained direct quotes from

a Presidential advisory memorandum the White House had

sent to Mr. Gerard Smith, Director, Arms Control and

Disarmament Agency, a

few days earlier.

The President

was alleged

to be furious with this unauthorized dis-

closure of classified information and directed a sweeping

investigation within the United States Government to

determine the source of the disclosure. Investigation

was conducted under the direction of Ni. Egil Krogh and •

Mr. David Young, Staff Assistants to Mr. John

Ehrlichman,

Counsel to the President for Domestic Affairs.

•3.

On the basis of investigations conducted by

State Security and Defense officials, four individuals -

one individual in the Department of Defense and three

• individuals in the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency--

were tabbed as leading suspects. Mr. Egil Krogh contacted

me on 26 July 1971 and requested that we arrange to polygraph

the three suspects in the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency

and volunteered the information that the Federal Bureau of

Investigation would be asked

to polygraph the one suspect

in the Department of Defense.

4. I informed Mr. Krogh that from time to time

in matters involving the national security the Agency had •

detailed to Mr. G. Marvin Gentile, Director of state

security, a polygraph operator and a polygraph machine for

his use

In polygraphing state department employees who

were recipients of allegations concerning their lojalty.

I emphasized that this procedure had the Director's

approval and that State clearly understood that the examin-

ation was their total responsiblity.

I further informed

him that this was the only way we could undertake to enter-

tain his request and that even

then it would require the

• specific approval of the Director. Mr. Krogh asked me to

obtain such approval and work out such arrangements with

Mr. Gentile.

5.

Later that same day, Mr. Krogh called Mr. Gentile

and inquired as

to whether the arrangements had been made.

Mr. Gentile indicated they had and

suggested that the same

polygraph operator be used to examine the Defense suspect.

Mr. Krogh informed Mr. Gentile that he considered this an

excellent idea and that he would instruct Defense officials

to make their man available to Mr. Gentile for a polygraph

examination.

6. The four individuals were Iden 182

of the Department of Defense and Iden 183

Iden 184

• and

Iden 185

• of

the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. The polygraph

examinations resulted in clearing the four men and the

results of the examinations were forwarded over my signature

to Mi. Gentile on 29 July 1971. A copy of my covering

memorandum is attached.

7. : Iden 186

a staff writer for The

Washington Post, in an article dated 3 September 1971

stated that a State Department spokesman had acknowledged

at a news briefing that agents of the Federal Bureau of

Investigation had

polygraphed State Department employees

suspected of leaking information on the SALT talks in

July. Mr. John Edgar Hoover, then Director of the Federal

letter to The hashinaten Post and said that the polygraph

examinations had been concuited by another agency. Specu-

press speculation in this resard died aray.

apparently has never been satisfied

and has been pressing dr. Charles Bray, state bepartment

spokesman, for confirmation of Agency involvement.

Nir.

Bray learned today that Iden 186

plans to use a press

conference to be held at 2:00 p.m. this atternoon to press

this point further. Mr. Bray has been given guidance by

Mr. Gentile to avoid confirmation but if this is impossible

he will indicate the examinations were conducted by State

Department Security officials utilizing an operator and

a machine detailed to the Department for this purpose.

Know winether or not the fact that the government-iide

investigation was directed by Mr. Egil Krogh is known to

reason why the matter has been raised again. Mr. David

Background:

For many years the Centrai intelligence Agency nas

office of the President such

as the Council on International

Economic Policy and the President's Foreign Intelligence

Advisory Board.

secretarios, clerical

employees and certain professional employees on a reimbursable

and non-reimbursable basis.

the present time, we

have no

clericals or professionals

assigned to the immediate White

House office, but we do have one young man detailed to their

Communications Section. There are detailees to PFIAB and CIEP.

I might point out that we had

detailed to the White House as

late as

the

fall of 1970 couriers,

telephone operators,

laborer

man who

PoIs. Recently, John Ha

We have even,

in rare. instances, detailed our

people to Congressional Staffs for short periods of time.

•3. Details to the White House and Government Agencies -

Discussion: Details to disC, the inite House, isa and the

National Har College are probably quite deforsible. On the other

hand, there may be those who would question igency employees

currently workirg at the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs

and Mr.

Peter Peterson having an Agency employee as his

secretary when he was the Secretary of Commerce (she also made

a trip with him to Moscow).

She is still with him in his

present assignment but we expect that she will redort to NSc for

a new detail sometime this month. Iden 112

served for

years as Director of the Office of. Public Safety for

AID. This information has been kept "close to the vest" during

that entire period of time. He has been approved for disability

retirement and is presently on sick leave and will retire

automatically at the expiration of this leave.

Each detail of an Agency employee to the White House or

other Government

agency has been carefully considered and

approval at a higher level obtained when professionals were

involved.

4. Project THOFOLD: I believe the support we are

providing to Project IrOFOLD is an activity that should be .

reported under your guidelines.

Since this is an extremely

sensitive Project and the Office of Security is reporting on

it, I will not repeat the details in my memorandum.

5.

Individuals Engaged in Domestic Activities: In a more

general sense, Contract Personnci Division prepares and executes

contracts with individuals engaged by the Agency to carry out

domestic activities. He also process Staff Agents who are

domestically assigned. None of these assignments are decided

in OP. I really have no way of knowing with any degree of

certainty what the specific duties of these individuals will be.

6. Arrangemerts with American Firms: In the interest of

reporting

"too nuch,

," I would remind you that Contract Personnel

Division writes "agreements" with

comestically based American

firms to provide cover for Agency

assets. The actual assign-

ments are overseas.

The arrangements, however, are backstopped,

in the main, in the United States.

In essence, this law makes it

almost impossible to procure electronic intelligence

equipment in a covert manner so that no tie or relationship

to the United States Government is made. In order for the

Agency to covertly obtain such equipment and hide any

Government interest, the Covert Procurement Staff of the

Procurement Division. has

relied

on an established working

relationship with a U.S. firm.

following items are pertinent:

a.

In February 1971, Colonel L. K. White, the then

Executive Director-Comptroller, called me to attend

meeting in his office,

also attended by Mr. William Colby.

Colonel White explained that the Technical Services

Division (TSD) had been requested to provide assistance

to the FBI for a sensitive project

Colonel White did not dis-

close

the purpose of the assistance being provided by ISD

but did instruct me to assist TSD on purely contractual

matters.

proximately s1 million, and

The

Bausch and Lomb.

No action is being taken on either of

these requirements pending further instructions which

will be sought from the Deputy Director for Management

and Services.

c. Over the years, this Agency has often supported

other Government agencies from a contractuai or materiel

standpoint. Upon

the submission of an officially approved

supported by a transfer of funds, the Agency

would either enter into "accommodation procurements"

for

the requesting agency or support the requesting agency by

the issuance of materiel tron stock. Such actions are

legally accomplished under the Economy Act of 1925. This

Act authorizes one agency to support the needs of, or pro-

vide a service for, another Government agency when such

action would be more economical and eliminate the need for

one agency of the Government to duplicate facilities

readily available from another. A typical example of this

procedure is

purchasing photointerpretation

gear for the

Defense Intelligence Agency element located

at NPIC. In

connection with the current reporting recuirement, however,

I have had

our records researched for the past 2 years and

Attachnent I reflects those transactions which appear to be

relevant to the subject of this menoranaum.

d.

In connection with the disclosures during the sum-

mer of 1971 that

the

Rand Corporation was not properly

sareguarding classifled documents, this Office undertook

two acts. I directed the Securitudeficer from our: West

Coast Procurement Office at the Iden 87

-.

to visit the Rand Corporation and satisfy

himself that classified material furnished them by the

Agency was

both properly sateguarded and accounted for.

His report was artirmative.

On 23 August 1971, the senior

Security. Officer assigned

to this Office forwarded a

letter to

the Rand Corporation stressing and reaffirming

the procedures Rand must follow in safeguarding classified

information furnished then by the Agency. Of residual

interest in this

matter, there is summarized

the contents

of a memorandun of 2 July 1971 to the Executive Director-

Comptroller from the DD/I which is in our possession.

This memorandum reports that FBIS regularly

disseminated reports to the Rand Corporation

but that instructions had been issued

to cease

• distribution of classified reports.

While no

other direct dissemination went to

Rand, other

USIB agencies, primarily USAF, were passing

"many" copies of DD/I products to Rand as au-

thorized under USIB regulations.

The memoran-

dum also states that Rand personnel had

requested searches and document retrieval from

the CRS facility.

5. In connection with action taken for the Office of

Security, there are three relevant items:

a.

The Printing Services Division, OL,'

was requested

by the Office of Security to print a book written by

Hary jo Harphy, Office of Security.

The book was pre-

pared by ta Hurly under a Brookings Institution Federal

Executive Fellowship. - The book is entitled "Where's

What -- Sources of Infornation for Federal Investigators."

It is

a full treatise on the existence of sources of in-

formation that may be useful to an investigator. The

The book is classified Confidential,

and it is our understanding that the distribution ras made

to appropriate agencies of the Federal Government.

A copy

of MI. Murphy's book can be made available for review if

desired.

sometime in 1972, a representative of the Law

Enforcement Assistance Administration (LEAt) requested

that the Agency give consiceration to our publishing, at

LEAA expense,

an unclassified version of this volume.

It

was the intent of LEiA to make broad-scale distribution

to Police Departments throughout the country.

The Director

of Security and I consulted on this matter and jointly

determined

that the Lead request should not be honored be-

cause the Agency should not put itself in the position of

publishing law enforcement material for general and un-

classified purposes, and it would be an abuse of oux print-

ing facilities.

b.. On 5 January 1971, the Director of Security re-

quested that I approve his leasing up to eleven motor

vehicles for use in connection with a special support

operation which would last approximately 5 months.

The

Director of security informed me, in his requesting memo-

randum of 5 January 1971, that "This support activity has

been undertaken at

the specific instruction of the Director

•and has his personal approval." The request was approved.

c. From 1968 to date, the Office of Security has

requisitioned from this Office a considerable amount of

materiel which we understand was to be given or loaned by

them to local Police Departments. In certain cases

soMe

of this materiel was issued from Agency stocks and, in

other cases, direct procurement of the materiel was made

by funds furnished by the Office of Security.

A complete

listing of such materiel is found in Attachment 2.

In connection with the responsibility held by this

Office

to obtain, manage, and dispose of safe sites for all

Agency operating

components, the following information is.

relevant.

A safe site, identified as "Safehouse 562" which

is Iden 88

was made available to General Cushman's

office on 25 July 1971.

The subject safe site was acquired on 15 June 1970

as a replacement

for a terminated OL standby safe site

and in keeping with the approved requirement for a com-

plement of five standby safehouses for all Agency use.

The apartment has one bedroom and is located in an older

high-rise

building along Iden 89.

The nominal

lessee is

Iden 90

a security-cleared

attorney with offices located at Iden 91

• The cover story utilized is that

meetings

apartment for business conferences,

overnight stays by his staff

The original lease term

was for a 1-year period, 15 June 1970 to 14 June 1971,

with month-to-month renewals thereafter. As an OL standby

safe site,

the apartment has

been used by various

Agency

components

to meet their short-term or crash requirements.

Control of the standby safe site and its

security is the

responsibility of this Office. A record is maintained of

each user,

component, and date of use; however, no record

is made of those persons being met at the site

nor for what

purpose the site Is being used (meetings, training, etc.).

Such information is maintained by the operating component

requesting the safe site.

Records maintained by this

Office disclose only that the apartment involved was made

available to General Cushman's office on 25 July 1971 in

answer to a telephonic request.

b. This Office is aware, although it had no cognizance

nor responsibility,

that an apartment was rented

in Miami

Beach, Florida, during the period of the Democratic National

Convention, 10-14 July 1972, and the Republican National

Convention, 21-24 August 1972. The apartment was used as

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Summary, Special Programs Division (SPD),

Office of Communications, Operational

Contacts with Other U.S. Government Agencies

1. Prior to 1969 the OC COMINT intercept unit,

which was then in Miami, had relatively frequent contact

with the Miani bureaus of the FBI and FCC, Miami Police

and the Miami

Beach Police.

The

staff provided support

to these activities in monitoring, identification and

DF of specific illegal agent transmissions conducted by

area.

Arrangements for this support were made

through the DDO's Chief, WH, Miami.

2. In late September 1972, NSA, through Division D/

DDO, requested that the Special

Programs Division initiate

a hearability survey of certain ht long-distance connercial

telephone

circuits between the U.S. and South America.

The circuits

carried drug related long-distance calls of

interest to the BiDD and other U.S. agencies.

Because of

the availability of personnel and technical capabilities,

the survey was conducted at the OC Relay Station

: D/PPB Memo to DD/M&S dated 23 May 1973,

Subject: Watergate Principals - Direct or

Indirect Involvement

1. The two notes of 13 and 20 January 1972 refer to approval

by the DCI (at that time Mr. Helms) for the expenditure of $30-32K

for a sensitive CS project. No further details were given, Mi. Colby

asked that DDO records be checked.

2. DDO records show that the funds went to the CI Staff for a

This is a joint operation with the Iden 100

service for the collection oi ELINT intelligence. The activity is

handled by the Special Intelligence Group of the CI Staff.

3. The funds cited in the notes was transferred to Cl on

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Conversation with Jac! Bauman

1. While on leave visiting Disney World in Florida, I

dropped in to see Jack Bauman who lives in Winterhaven, Florida.

Jack retired from the Agency about five years ago on disability due

• to a serious heart condition. He was with the Office of Security for

about 20 years prior to his retirement.

2. During a private conversation Jack told me that he had

been interviewed three of four times by the FBI in connection with

the McCord-Hunt affair. I asked him why he had been interviewed,

and he told me that in late 1971 he had been contacted by Howard

Hunt who suggested that he consider an assignment as Security

Officer for the Republican Party. Jack visited Washington in

January 1972 to discuss the proposed position with Howard Hunt

who apparently was acting on behalf of the Republican Party. Jack

furnished a resume to Hunt and discussed the position with him.

Ultimately, he decided not to accept the position because he felt

that his heart condition would not allow him to become intolved in

such activity.

3. According to Jack, during the meeting with Mr. Hunt

they discussed some of the requirements of the job. At that time

they discussed a need for both a positive and a counteraudio program

and a need for a good security system both before and during the

National Convention. Jack indicated that he sincerely believed that

the Republican Party did need a security officer and a good security

programmer but felt that he could not afiord to accept the job even.

though it was a very lucrative offer. Apparently, money was not a

problem.

4. When Jack declined, he indicated th

Mr. Hunt asked

for any other rec

mendations he might have.

iccording to Jack

he told Mi. Hunt that most of the people he knew were still in the

Agency, but he did furnish the name of

INEN-lus who might be

possibly ready to retire from the Agency.

5. Jack informed me that he assumed that the Bureau

obtained his name due to the resume he furnished MIr. Hunt. He

said that the Bugeau had talked to him on three or four occasions

and that he had written up about a 40 page statement concerning

his dealings with Mr. Hunt. When asked about

Mr. NicCord, Jack

said that he really did not know McCord that well and declined any

knowledge of Mi. McCord's technical capability.

• 6. Mr. Bauman indicated that he had not been in touch

with Mr. Hunt since the early part of 1972 and knew nothing of

the Watergate operation. He stated that he had gained the impres-

sion from the Bureau interview that the technical devices were being

removed at the time of the arrest and were not being installed as

originally reported.

7. All of the above information was volunteered by Mr.

Bauman, and I really did noi get involved in any discussion on the

matter other than to comment that I hated to see the Agency's name

connected with such an incident in any way. The above conversation

took place during a 10 or 15 minute period and no other discussion

relating to this incident was held. It is being reported for the record

and for information of the Director of Security.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director for Management and Services

SUBJECT

•: Contacts with Individuals Named in the Watergate Matter

1. I am addressing this to you instead of to the Director of Central

Intelligence since I doubt that the information contained hercin is of such

significance to warrant his interest and because it has been on record with

the Agency since July 1972. However, if you feel that the information is of

such interest that it should be forwarded to the Director I shall put it in the

proper format to do so.

2. My only contact with anyone named in connection with the

Watergate and related matters was through Vir. Jack Bauman a former

Agency employee now retired and living in Winterhaven, Florida. In

December 1971 ivir. Bauman called me from Florida and advised that he

wanted to get in touch with Howard Hunt. He said that he did not have Hunt's

home phone number and that it was probably unlisted but that since Hunt was a

former employee, could I contact Hunt and ask him to give Mr. Bauman a call.

I had only met Hunt once about 10 ycars before but I agreed to relay the message.

I called Howard Hunt at his home and told him that Mr. Bauman did not have his

home phone and requested he call Mir. Bauman. Mi. Hunt thanked me for

relaying the message and said that he would call Mr. Bauman. This seemed of

little consequence to me in December 1971 but in July 1972 Iden 17 of the

Office of Security contacted me in regard to the FBI investigation of the Watergate

situation. At that time I informed Iden 17 of the telephone call from

Mr. Bauman in December 1971. Attached is a copy of a Memorandum for the

Record prepared by. Iden 17

? as a result of our conversation.

3. In the summer of 1972 I took my family to Disney World in Florida

and took that occasion to drop in to see Jack Bauman. Mr. Bauman told me in

a private conversation that he had been interviewed three or four times by the

FBI in connection with the Watergate affair and he related to me his contact

SUBJECT

: Director of Current Intelligence

: Activity Related to Domestic Events

1. OCI began following Caribbean black radicalism

in earnest in 1968. The emphasis of our analysis was on

black nationalism as a political force in the Caribbean

and as a threat to the security of the Caribbean states.

Iwo DDI. memoranda were produced on the subject:

"Black

Radicalism in the Caribbean" (6 August 1969),

and "Black

Radicalisn in the Caribbean--Another Look" (12 June 1970).

In each a single paragraph was devoica to ties with the

Us black power movement; the discussion primarily concerned

visits of

Stokely Carmichael and other US black pover

activists to the Caribbean and othor overt contacts.

2. In June 1970, Archer Bush of OCI was

asked to

write a memorandum with special attention to links be-

tween black

radicalism

in the Caribbean and advocates

black power in the us.

The record is not clear where

this request originatca, but it came through channels

from

the DCI.

The paper was to be treated

as especially

sensitive and was to include material provided by the

Spacial Operations group of the CI Staff.

The CI Staff

material was voluminous but did not provide meaningful

evidence of important links between militant blacks in

the US and the Caribbean.

This, in fact, was one of

the conclusions of the paper.

The memorandum was produced

in typescript form and given

I. In late spring of 1968 Walt Rostow, then

Spocial Assistant to the President for National Security

Affairs, tasked the DCI with undertaking a survey of

worldwide student dissidence. Conironted by timult at

campuses like Columbia ond mindful of the violence

accompanying student outbursts at Berlin's Free Univorsity

and elsethere, Rostow sought io learn whether youthful.

dissidence was

interconnected: spawned by the

same causes;

financed and honce manipulated by forces or influences

hostil to the interests of the Us and its allies; or likely

to come under inimical sway to the detriment of US interests.

2. The paper was prepared by paul Corscadden of OCI

with the assistance of the CA and CI Staffs.

D/OCI, and Corscaddon met with Rostow to elicit the reasons

The DDI,

for his or the presidcht's concerns and to agree on the

sources

etc.

to be examined, the research methods to be followed,

3.

Written during the summer of 1968, the most

sensitive version of Restless Youth comprised two sections.

The first was

a philosophical treatment of student unrest,

its motivation, histor; and tactics.

This section drew

heavily on overt literature and FBI reporting on Students

for a Democratic Society and affiliated groups.

In a sense,

the survey of dissent emerged from a shorter (30 page)

typescript study of SDS and its foreign ties the same

author had done for Mr. Rostow at the DCI's request in

December 1967. (We no longer have a copy.)

1. Because of the paucity of information on foreign

student movements, it was necessary to focus on SDS which

then monopolized the field of student action here and

abroad.

A second section comprised 19 country chapters--

ranging from Argentina to yugoslavia--and stood by itself

as a review of foreign student dissidence.

5. Because SDS was a domestic organization, the

full paper Restless Youth, including the essay on world-

wide dissent went only to nine readers. A copy may be

in the Johnson Libraiy.

6. Following the paper's favorable reception by

the president and Mr. Rostow,

the DCI briefed the NSC

on student dissent. The sensitive version subsequently

was updated and sent to the White House in February 1969.

7. The less sensitive text was disseminated in

September 1968 and then updated and issued again in

: March 1969 and August 1970.

SUBJECT

.:Activity Related to Domestic Events :

In late 1967 OCI participated in the preparation

of several short intelligence memoranca dealing with the

foreign connections of US organizations and activists in-

volved in the anti-var movement. The main purpose of

these reports, prepared at the request of the linite House,

existed between inter-

national Communist elements or foreign governments and the

The conclusion reached was that

there was some evidence of ad hoc contacts between anti-

war activists at home and abroad but no evidence of

direction or formal coordination.

2.

In October 1967 President Johnson expressed

interest in this subject and ordered a high level inter-

departmental survey.

In response to his personal request

to the DCI, Mir. Helms asked the CI Staff to collect what-

ever information was available through our own sources

and

through liaison with the FBI and to pass it to OCI, which

was directed to prepare a memorandum from the DCI to the

President.

3.

A book message requirement was sent to all stations

to report whatever information was on hand relevant to this

subject. • Altholgh agent reports on Comnunist front opera-

tions overseas were :

information on the activities of US activists--and that was

quite limited--was

Involvement In Domestic Affairs

1:

This memorandun responds to the DdI's

request for a

listing of any questionable

involvements in domestic affairs. I do not believe

that CRS is doing anything that a

reasonable

man could construe as improper.

2.

Crs does, of course, have several programs

to acquire still pictures, novies, viceotapes

and books either privatoly, secretly or without

acknowledaoment that CIA is the actual end user.

JFK Act 5 (g) (2) (D)

3. CRS files do not generally bear on U.S.

citizens or organizations.

The biooraphic file-

building criteria specifically excludes U.s.

nationals unless the person has become of such

najor importance in the political life of a forcidi

country that the file is essential. (To my knowledge,

only 2 persons so qualify.

some persons who are now U.s. citizens but we

have

no way to separate

them; we have files on

U.S. defectors to. Cuba.)

SUBJECI: Involvement In Domestic Affairs

4. The CIA Library has several informal

snag

files intended to aid the librarians in

answering the kinds of questions that they know

they will get on a continuing basis. An

appointments file is a collation of clippings

on appointed federal officials: who holds what

job when and what is his backgrourd? The extremist

files are a collection of folders on a variety

of organizations and a few people with intricate

organizational links.

Any

sort of extremism

is grist for these particular files.

Anda

few

persons, c.g., Rip

Brown and Blurlage Cleaver,

have dossiers consisting almost exclusively of

clippings from public media.

These files are

unclassifica and consist nostly of clippings

from the public press:

U.s., forcign, underground,

scholarly.

I am not aware of any other kind of

involvement in domestic activities that is not

related to development of techniques or logistics

or legitimate training of CRS personnel.

MEMORANDUM FOR: ' DDI

SUBJECT

: Sensitive Activities

1. FBIS has been engaged in no activities related to the Ellsberg

and Watergate cases.

2. FBIS operations occasionally extend to the domestic arena. From

time to time, FBIS linguists are made available to DDO or Office of

Conmunications conponents for special operations (usually abroad) involving

close-support SIGINI work or translation of audio take. On one occasion

recently DDO, on behalf of the FBI, requested the services of several

FBIS linguists skilled in Arabic to work directly for tha FBI on a short-

term project here in Washington. The arrangements were made by Mr. Oberg

of the DJO CI Staff.

He said the project was very highly classified and

that FBIS participation

was approved by Mr. Colby and the Director. FBIS

participation nos. approved by the Director of FBIS after a check with

the ADDI.. Other examples of sensitive linguistic support work are help

in the handling and rcsettlement of defectors, the recent assignment of

an employee to the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs to transcribe

recordings in a rare Chinese dialect, and the detailing of another

Chinese linguist on two occasions to

assist in the U.S. military training

of Chinese Nationalist cadets.

3. Within its responsibility for monitoring press agency trans-

missions for intelligence information, FBIS publishes and distributes

some material which falls in a "gray" area of copyright protection, libei,

and privacy of international connunications. Press services controlled

by national governments and transmitted by radioteletype without

specific addressees, e.g. the Soviet TASS service and the PRC's WCNA,

are monitored by FBIS and the material is disseminated without restric-

tion.

The legality of this has been affirmed by decisions of the

JFK Act 5 (9) (2) (D)

JFK Act 5

4. The routine FBIS monitoring of foreign radio broadcasts often

involves statenents or speeches made by U.S. citizens using those radio

facilities. Examples are stateuents made or allegedly made by Amarican

POW's in Hanoi, by Jane Fonda in Hanoi and by Ransey Clark in Vietnam.

At the request of FBI and the Departnent of Justice, and with the

approval of

the CIA Office of General Counsel, we have on occasion sub-

mitted transcripts of such broadcasts

Department of Justice as

part of that Department's consideration of a possible trial. In such

cases, we have been required to submit names of FBIS monitors involved,

presumably because of the possivility they might be requiied as witnesses.

(In one case in 1971, an FBIS staff employce was directed to appear as

an expert witness in

the court-martial of a Marine enlisted man charged

with aiding the enemy in a broadcast fron Hanoi.) FBIS views all. this

with misgivings. Monitoring of such broadcasts

is incidental and

rue attribution of their news to FBIS, and we should not be considered

policemen maintaining surveillance of

traveling Americans.

5. FBIS is an overt organization, but one aspect of its operations

is under Depariment of Commerce cover.

The Joint Publications Rescarch

Service (JPRS) was established in 1957 to provide the means through which

great volumes of material from unclassified foreign publications could

be translated by large numbers of independent contractors in the United

States on a piece rate basis. Contractors are not witting of their CIA

employment.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director for Science & Technology

SUBJECT :

: ISD Support to Other Agencies

1. Technical Services Division's charter (CSI 1-8) requires

that it provide technical assistance to both CIA operations and

other activities as may be directed by the Deputy Director for

Operations.

2. Over the years the chief non-CIA recipients of this

support have been the Department of Defense, the Federal

Burcau of Investigation, Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous

Drugs, Immigration and Naturalization Service, Department

of State, Unitod States Postal Service, Secret Service, Agency

for International Development, and the White House.

3. While varying widely among the different recipients, these

services have included training and materials, and in a few in-

stances participation in the fields of audio and visual surveillance,

secret writing and related communications, personal protection,

disguise,

concealment devices, electronic beaconry, illicit narcotics detec-

tion, and counter-sabotage/terrorism.

4. In most instances requirements for this support are

received by TSD through higher echelons (Office of the Director

or Deputy Director for Operations). Unless the service involved

is a trivial or continuing one, the request is referred to the

Foreign Intelligence Staff Departmental Coordination Group for

coordination and approval at the appropriate Agency levels.

Approval within ISD by the Chief of Operations or Development

and Engineering and the Chief of ISD or his Deputy also is re-

quired.

5. The attachment lists the primary services provided to

the organizations named in Paragraph two.

• FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

TSD has had a close working relationship with the FBI over

the past few years. The FBI is the only organization that has

been fully briefed on ISD audio techniques and equipment. The

following are situations where ISI equipment and guidance were

involved in operations:

(A) Identity 59

- Four masked transmitters were

installed.

Two have failed and two remain workable.

(B) Identity 60

- A TSD built masked transmitter

was. installed to collect emanations from a crypto-

graphic machine. The system continues to function

when samples of the emanations are needed.

(C)

Identity 61

- Two transmitters have been

installed and are operating. One is specifically

designed to collect the sounds of typowriting, the

other is a

straight audio transmitter to colluct con-

versations. A FBI agent is manning the listening

post.

A third system

is not oper-

ating, probably due to battery expiration. The tape

made from

this room

was made by the National

Security Agency before failure.

(D) Identity 62

- TSD furnished equipment and con-

sultation covering Identity 62.

First masked switched trans-

mitters were used in two apartments used as tempor

ary quarters. Later masked switched transmitters

and microwave transmitters were installed in the

permanent quarters along with mic and wire installa-

tions, entirely furnished by the Bureau. This install-

ation is not fully operational because the full comple-

ment of personnel have not yet arrived.

(EL Iden

- This is an

operation with

additional

participation by National Security Agency. It is

designed in anticipation of the

Identity 64

in Washington. The listening post was

obtained by using the Agency covert mechanisms

for procuring the property. New systems are

being designed and produced by using ISD's covert

contractor mechanisms and TSD engineers.

(F) Identity 65

- Ten masked audio devices pur-

chased from TSD were installed in Identity 65

by the FBI. Part of the equipment was install-

ed in November and December 1971, the remaining

equipment was installed 17 - 25 March 1972. Tests

made by a TSD officer from a temporary FBI

listening post on 8 - 9 November 1972, proved that

the target equipment no longer functioned and was

believed discovered by the occupants.

(G) TSD has furnished equipment items which constitute

an on-the-shelf capability to engage in photo and

audio surveillance operations which might not be

known to the Agency. In one case it is known that a

relatively unsophisticated device was used against

a domestic target.

Contacts with Domestic Police Organizations

1. In December 1968, July 1969 and December 1970, SDB

provided basic countersabotage familiarization training for

selected members of the washington metropolitan area police

departments.

The training was given at the Fairfax County

police pistol and rifle range.

Authorization for the train-

ing came from DDP and Chief, Office of security.

2. On occasion during the past few years, under the

auspices of the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration of

the Department of Justice and with the approval of CI Staff

and Office of Security, SDB provided training and familiari-

zation to police officers of several domestic police

departments in the uses of the Explosives Residue Detection

rechnique and Trace Metals Detection Technique.

These tech-

niques had been declassified and are currently available to

the law enforcement community. The National Bomb Data Center

publishes periodic guidance in their uses.

3. In order to augment the SDB mission responsibilities

in the field of countersabotage and counterterior, SDB offi-

cers have in the past two years visited, under appropriate

covers, the explosives disposal units of the New York City

police department, Dade County (niami) Florida Dept. and the

Los Angeles Police Dept.

Also, in March 1973, two SDB offi-

cers attended the Explosives and Ordnance Disposal Conference

in Sacramento, California, sponsored by LEAA.

When the

recent letter bomb menace began in September 1972, our liaison

with the NYCPD bomb squad paid off in that we had complete in-

formation on letter bomb construction in hours, enabling the

Agency to make worldwide dissemination within a day.

DOMESTIC TESTS FOR

AGENCY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS

1.: As a normal part of ORD's efforts in the

research and development of equipment and

for Agency applications in foreign intelligence, we

conduct experiments and tests in the United States.

Clearly, the design and development of our intelli-

gence equipments can be done more cconomically and

more securely in this country. Although most of

the tests of our RaD equipments are performed in

closed laboratories or in secure arcas simulating

the foreign environment, some of the tests and experi-

ments, of necessity, reveal domestic information.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Executive Secretary, CIA Management

Committee

SUBJECT

: Reported Identity 61

• Burglary

1. Attached is a report summarizing what we know about the

reported break-in of Identity 61.

An investigative report

by an officer of the Exccutive Protective Service states that the

offices were ransacked and a number of personal items stolen.

2. The attached summary also describes a separate audio

operation conducted against Identity 61

by the FBI, at the

Agency's behest and with its technical support.

This presents a

related question that should be noted. James McCord's' testimony

indicates that he placed telephone calls to the Identity 75 and Identity

61.

He says he picked the numbers at random, hoping

that if his phone was tapped his attorneys would be able to challenge

the evidence as being tainted. Another witness, John Caulfield,

says McCord called the two named Iden 75 and Iden 61 because he "was sure"

they "were subjects of national security wirctaps."

3. In fact, there has been a long-standing telephone lap on the

Identity 75

, r'un by the FBI, about which CI Staff believes Mic Cord

knew. It is possible that he also had an inkling of some sort of operation

against Identity 61

', and assumed that it was also a telephone

tap. One must speculate that he played for double insurance, hoping

that both his lelephones and those of the Iden 75 and Iden 61 were tapped, and

that one way or another his case would be dismissed or dropped

because of tainted evidence or to avoid revealing the sensitive

operations. At this point, given the publicity of the

Iden 61 break-in,

and the testimony of NIcCord and Caulfield, the current investigations

may lead to exposure of the operations.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Inspector General

SUBJECT

: Reported Burglary of the Identity 61 •

1. The press reported a burglary of Identity 61

. 13-14

May 1973. An investigative report by an officer of the Executive

Protective Service states that the offices were ransacked and a

number of personal items were stolen. There were some latent

fingerprints, but no identitication was made. The FBI, which states

that the incident was on 15 May, did not investigate because it deter-

mined that it did not have jurisdiction. The Identity 61

registered a formal complaint and American regrets were expiessed,

Identity 61

making it clear that they suspected something other than

ordinary robbery. We have no additional information on the subject.

There had been an carlier intelligence opcration against the Identity 61

which is described below.

2. On 16 April 1971 the Agency. proposed to the FBI the instal-

lation of technical coverage of Identity 61

The opportunily

for such an installation came about when a domestic assel of Foreign

Resources Division reported that he had been asked to submit a bid

for a contract to renovate

Identity 61

Upon securing the

contract the asset was willing to augment his work force as appropriate

or install material which would be provided him. The Agency proposed

to turn this asset over to the FBI and to provide technical and logistic

support. The value of such an operation to the intelligence community

was cited.

3. On 23 April 1971 FBI Director John Edgar Hoover turned

down the Agency proposal. That same day CIA Director Richard Helms

sent a letter to Attorney-General John Mitchell requesting that the FBI

turndown be reversed, citing the importance of the Iden 61 target and

national intelligence needs to collect positive intelligence. On 24 April

the Attorncy-General reversed the FBI decision and the Washington

Field Office of the Bureau was instructed to proceed with the operation.

4. During the period from 26 April to 18 May all the

technical equipment from the Agency to the FBI was delivered,

installed and tested. Everything seemed to be working. No Agency.

personnel were involved in any way with actual installation of

equipment in Identity 61 From May to February Agency tech-

nicians helped calibrate, reset and do other repair work on occasions

of equipment failure in the FBI listening post. On no occasion did

they enter. Identity 61.

5. The Agency requested that coverage of Identity 61 • be

stopped on 3 February 1972 after FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover

advised that he was scheduled shortly to testify in Congress and

might have to advise them that the installation in Identity 61°

was initiated at CIA's request. The operation and equipment, to the

best of the Agency's knowledge, was dormant until 8 December 1972

when the FBI was asked by the Agency to reactivate coverage.

The

request at this time was occasioned by the knowledge that a Iden 76

delegation would be arriving in Washington for discussions on

nationalization of foreign holdings,

While the FBI was still

in the process of reactivating the equipment, the Department of

State on 20 December 1972 requested the FBI to institute all possible

coverage of Identity 61

and on 22 December 1972 coverage

was partially reinstituted with full coverage in effect by 26 December

1972.

6. A review of the take from the operation, weighed against

the risks involved, led the Agency to conclude that the activity was

not worth continuing. On 16 February 1973 CIA requested the EBI

tó discontinue the coverage. On 22 February 1973 the FBI advised

that microphone surveillance of Iden 61

was discontinued.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Identity 61

Break In on 15 May 1972

1. On 24 May 1973 I telephoned Mr. James Robinson,

General Crime Section, Department of Justice and asked if he

had any information as to criminal prosecution of porsons involved

in a break in at Identity 61

• in Washington, D.C. on

15 May 1972, Mr. Robinson stated he had no knowledge of this but

suggested that it would be better to check with Mr. G. Marvin Gentile,

Deputy Assistant Secretary for Security, Department of State, and

the Secret Service since they had responsibilities for the Executive

Protective Service (EPS). I telephoned Mi. Gentile and he identi-

fied to State Department cables relative to the incident; one from

the embassy in Santiago to the Department, No. 2450, dated

15 May 1972, Subjoct: Unauthorized Entry Outlining the Protest

of the Iden 76 Covernment presented to the American Embassy,

and the State Department reply to Santiago, No. 0S4655, dated

15 May 1972. Mr. Gentile also identified the EPS report of

investigation and suggested that I get a copy fror the Secret Service.

I then callad Mr. Iom Kelly at Secret Service and he had his liaison

man deliver me a copy of the EPS report of investigation.

2. On 25 May 1973 I received a call from FBI Agent

Ray Mullens on green phone No. 5303 stating that he had received

a telephone call from Mi. James Robinson relative to my inquiry

about prosecution. Mi. Mullens indicated that the FBI Washington

Field Office had recontacted the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD)

on 24 May and reviewed the report No. 218-424 filed with the 3rd

District, MPD which states that a break in occurred at Identity 61

between 5:00 and 8:00 a.m. on 15 May 1972.

Reported loss at tha

ime consisted of four am/fr

adios

and one electric razor. The police investigation identified

some latent fingerprints bui no identification of those prints

was made. Since the reported loss was under $5, 000 and there

was. no evidence of a crossing of state boundries, the FBI did

not make an investigation of the incident. The MPD reported

that there had been no prosecution and no suspect was identified.

MEMORANDUM FOR:

SUBJECT:

Mr. William E. Colby

Special Activities

1. Following our recent conversation, I have

searched

my memory and Mr. McCone's files for examples

of activitics which to hostile observors or to somconc

without complete knowlcage and with a spocial kind of

motivation could be interpreted as examples of activities

exceeding CIA's charter.

2. First, as we discussed, on 7 March 1962,

DCI McCone, under pressure from Attorney General Robert

F. Kennedy, agreed to tap the tolephones of columnists

Robert S. Allen and Paul Scott in an effort to identify

their sources for classified

information which was appeal-

ing in their columns.

Because the primary source appeared

to be in

the Department of

Defense, MeConc oidered me

personally to brief Gencral Joe Carroll, Director of DIA,

orally, which

I did. I understand nore

complete information

on this operation is available from the Director of security.

I, personally, managed to avoid

gaining any knowledge of

whät precise

actions

were taken, what information was gained,

what was done with it, and when the opcration was terminated.

3. As a rosult of a devcloping relationship with

IDEN-122

thelDEN-123rcpresentative in Washington,

and also as

a rosult of certain information convejed by

IDEN-124

, James Angleton, with the approval of

Dick Helms, agreed to mount a

counterespionage operation

against the

IDEN-95

Washington. This involved

breaking and entering and the removal of documents from

the

IDEN-126

On 18 June 1962, DCI McCone and

Helms briefed

Secretary of State Rusk generally.on the

operation without going into operational details: Later

on the same day, President John F. Kennedy was briefed.

Actual breaking and entering occurred somewhat later, and

on 15 April 1963: DCI McCone met with President Kennedy

alone and briefed the President on the dotails of this

new phase of the operation.

On the same day, the Attorney

General was briefed and he

agiced that he would not

mention it to the FBI unless the FBI therselves raised

it with him. On 3 February 1961, DCI NcCone met alone

with President Lyndon B. Johnson

and briefed him on the

opcration.

On 1 February McGeorge Bundy was briefed.

On 6 February 1964 in a

briefing

of Secretary of State

Rusk on the results

of the opcration, Rusk expressed

rescrvations about the propricty of such an operation.

He rnised this same concern in subsequent conversations

with McCone on 17 April 1961. 28 May 1961: and 14 June

1961. On 12 September 1961 Rusk continued to express

grave leservations and repeatedly suggested that the

IDEN-i3 be informed dirocrly that we know about their

espionage operations

in the

United States and ask them

to desist. In a meeting on 28 May 1961 Rusk expressed

these reservations in the presence of DCI McCone and

President Join F.. Kennedy. Secretary of Defense McNamara

was also

present, and thore is no record

that he had

previously been made aware of this operation.

• 4.

Although certain activities never got beyond

the planning stage, there are, I believe, three examples

of such planning which could be subject to misinterpretation.

One involved chemical warfare operations against the rice

i are on patron.

crops in both Cuba

and North Vietnam. A second involved

a paramilitary strike against the Chi-Com nucleai instal-

lations.

Outside the United States Government, General

Eisenhover was briefed on such planning.

A third, which

assumes a new significance today, involved a proposal by

Angleton and Helms for a greatly

increased intelligence

collection effort against foreign installations in this

country. This planning also involved a scheme for selected

exposure of KGB activities and counteractions against the

Soviet intelligence service.

The reasons are still unclear

to me as to why the FBI chose to brief the PFIAB to the

effect that CIA was planning to wiretap extensively and

indiscriminately in this country, to greatly increase

the Agency representation

JFK Act 5 (9) (2) (D)

generally to use KGB-type tactics, also extensively and

indiscriminately.

This led to a heated exchange between

DCI McCone and Mir. Belmont of the FBI, one such meeting

taking place in the presence of the Attorney General.

It is clear that the IBI was opposed to any such proposal

then, as now, and the plan never went forward..

5. During the period when Des FitzGerald was in

charge of the Cuban Task Force, DCI McCone's office

learned, quite by accident, that FitzGerald had secured

the cooperation of several

prominent US business firms

in denying

economic items to Cuba.

There was no question

but that the businessmen were glad to cooperate, but know-

ledge of this operation had to be rather widespicad.

6. On 17 April 1961. Mi. Robert B. Anderson came

to DCJ. McConc

on behalf of Ancrican business interests,

offering to inscrt some $300,000 to try to secure a

favorable result in the clections in Panama.

this

approach.

IDEN'-128

of

Shortly

IDEN-129

made a similar proposal to icCone in connection

with elections in Chile.

On 12 May 1964 at a meeting of

the 303 Connittce, it was decided that the offers of

American business

could not be accepted, it being neither

secure way not an honorable way of doing such business.

This declaration of policy at this time bears on the recent

ITT hearings, but I am not surprised that cCone has

forgotten that he helped to set the precedent of

refusing

to accopt such collaboration between the Agency's operations

and private business.

7.

At the direction of Attorney General Robert

Kennedy and with the explicit approval of President Konnedy,

McCone injected the Agency, and

into the US labor situation, and particularly to try

to ameliorate the quarrel between George Meany and

Walter Reuther. IDEN-36

stcered a very skillful

course in this connection, but the Agency could be

vulnerable to charges that we went behind leany's back,

or were somehow consorting with Reuther against leany's

wishes.

8. There are three examples of using Agency

funds which I know to be controversial. One was the

expenditure of money under Project MOSES in securing

the release of Cuban Brigade prisoners.

Details of

this operation are best known to Larry Houston, Mire

Miskovsky

IDEN-131

, and Jares Smith.

Second,

as you well know, when Lou

Concin received

his sumnons

to report to the Joint Gencral Staff Headquarters on

1 Novenber

1963 a large amount of

cash went with him.

My impression is that the accounting for this and its

use has never

been very frank or complete.

Third, at

one of

the

carly Special Group nectings attended by

McConc he tool strong exception to proposals to spond

Agency funds to improve the

economic viability of liest

Berlin, and for an investment program in Mali. His

gencral position was that such exponditures were not

within the Agency's charter, and that he would

allow

such spending only on the direct personal

request of

the Secretary of State or the Secretary of Defense, or

the White House.

9. I raise these issues of funding because I

severely criticized by the

for stamps in connection with a program to buy tractors

to secure the

release of prisoners from Cuba.

10. Under the heading of old business, I know that

any one who has worked in the Director's office has worried

about the fact that conversations within the offices

and

over the telephones were transcribed.

During McCone's

tenure, there were microphones in his regular office,

his inner offico, his dining room, his office in East

Building, and his study at his icsidence on white Raven

Street.

I do not know who would be willing to raise such

an issue, but knowledge of such operations tends to

spread, and certainly

the Agency is vulnerable on this

score.

YFK Act 5 (g)(2)(D)

I1. Also under the heading of old business,

well remember the hue and cry raised, especially by Carl

Kavsen in the White House, when

Shortly after the Cuban missile crisis, there

was

a disposition in Washington to reexamine the

Bay of Pigs,

and the fact that several Alabama National Air Guaid

officers lost their lives in the Bay of Pigs was surfaced

with surprisingly little excitement at the time.

12. During my stint on the 7th floor there was

a special arrangement with the Office of Communications

whereby the Director's office guined accoss to non-CIA

traffic.

This surfaced briefly at one point shortly after

Admiral

Rayborn became DCI.

He had visited the Signal

Center and removed a copy of a telegram from the Embassy

in the Dominican Republic for Undei Secretary Gorge Ball,

Eyes Only.

He roturned to his office and proccoded to

discuss this telegram with George Ball who vas naturally

quite curious as to how Rayborn knew about it, and also as

to how Rayborn had it in his possession before Ball did.

Ben Read in the Secretary of State's office and I spent

several weeks putting this one to rest.

13. Finally, DCI McCone, as you and

I well know,

operated on a very

lofty plane,

and I think certain of

his activities could be misunderstood: One example was

his decision in July of 1961 to have Aristotle Onassis and

Maria Callas

flown from Rome to. Athens

on Air Force KC 135.

Their arrival in Athens in this airplane attracted the

attention of the local press and in

due course sir. John

Hightower, Chief of the Associated Press Bureau for

Washington,

came to see me to ask about the propriety

of this action.

14. The use of

IDEN-132

aircraft

has been remarkably secure, but DCI !IcCone himself

foigot about the cover arrangement and became quite

exercised whon he saw Candidate Goldwater land in the

San Francisco airport for the Republican Sational Con-

vention in 1961 aboard the

IDE N-133

with

the highly visible tail number IDEN-134. This

was,1

explained

to him carefully, a perfectly logitimate

charter, but he didn't like it.

15.

McCone dealt quite extensively with newsmen

in Washington.

In fact; they gave him a gift and a

luncheon when he left Washington, which is perhaps

indicative of the press's relations with him. However,

in the case of the Ross

and lise book, The Invisiblc

Government, he did try to bring pressure on the publisher

and tie authors to change things.

They did not change

a comma, and

I I doubt that this old saw willever sing

again.

Finally, and this will reflect my Middle

Western Protestant upbringing, icCone's dealings with

the Vatican, including lope John XXIII

and Pope Paul

VI,

would and could raise eyebrows in certain quarters.

17. The above listing is uneven, but I have a

sinking feeling that discipline has broken down,

and

that

allegations from any quarter which cast these things in

• the wrong light would receive great publicity and

attention,

and no amount of denial would ever set the record

straight.

If I may be of any assistance in tracking down further

• details, I am of course at your disposal, but I would point

SUBJECT: PLMPLODESTAR

Project MPLODESTAR is a Headquarters initiated program

which has as its fundamental

objective the long term manipu-

lations of selected agent assets operating against EA Division

difficult targets in the leftist and communist milieu in various

parts of the world. Although targetted overseas these agents are

often exposed to and directed against American radical, loftist,

and communist targets to gain a practical knowledge of the leftring,

radical, communist world. There is a possibility that an asset

might become suspect and be accused of being an employee of the

Agency or the Bureau; or it might happen some asset would, for

some reason, become disenchanted with his role and expose his

Agency relationship and his activities, with resultant embar-

rassment. To minimize potential problems, therefore, each

case is cleared with the FBI and through CI/SO the Bureau is

DirectorL. Patrick Gray at this Agency's request. Our request

was prompted by a decision that the intelligence production of

this operation did not justify the risks involved in continuing

to run it in the sensitive political climate caused by the

mounting disclosures

about

JEK Act 5 (g) (2) (D)

in WEN-76 This

was especially so because of our

reservations about maintaining

proper security for the listening post which, as with other

operational aspects of the case, was under FBI management.

certain contexts could

be construed as delicate or inappropriate.

2.

At the request of the Director of Security,

from

approximately mid-october 1972 to mid-January

1973

safcsite

was made available to the

U.S. Marshal's Service for use as a secure rosidence

by an Assistant U.S. Attorney who reportedly was

under thrcat of assassination by organized criminal

elements.

SB Division over the past three months has

interviewed tour graduate students as prospective

candidates for assignments under American business

cover in the USSR.

They were encouraged to locate

cover jobs on their own.

For approximately two years the SB Division

has had the cooperation of the Commander of the

Morals Division of the Distriüt of Columbia Police

Department in training officers scheduled for

assignnent to the USSR and Eastern Europe in how to

2.

Some American participants at the Soviet-controlled

attempted

unsuccesstully to include a call for international

demonstrations to take place at the time

a specific call for international

support o1 activitzes against the Republican convention

in their proposal to the

Action Commission of the horld

Foreign Support for Activities Planned to Disrupt

or Harass the Republican National Convention

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION:

Indications. remain limited, thus far, of foreign efforts

to inspire, support or take advantage of activities designed

to disrupt or harass the National Convention of the Republican

-Party in San Diego, 21-23 August

1972.

The concept of coordinated

international support for domestic activities in the United

States was generally endorsed at the recent world Assembly for

Peace and Independence of the Peoples of Indochina; however, the

Conference issued no spocific call

for international support of

disruptive actions at the American national political conventions.

BACKGROUND:

At the Sovict-controlled World Assembly for Peace and

Independence of

the Peoples of Indochina, held In Versailles

arom 10-1s February 1972, there las mention of Ancrican plans

for demonstrations at both the Republican and Democratic

National Conventions. The final draft resolution from the

Conference's "Action Commission" contains an appendix submitted

by American delegates whose goal was to secure global coordination

for domestic actions in the United States. It calls for inter-

national support to six wecks of domestic antivar actions and

demonstrations, from 1 April to 15 May 1972, and concludes with

the statement:

"This

campaign will lead up

to the Democratic

Party. Convention at Miami

on July 9, 1972, and the Republican

Party Convention in San Diego on August 21, 1972."

The final "Resolution of the Paris World Assembly for the

Peacc"and Independence of the Indochinese People" of

13 February

1972; drafted by the "Political Commission" states:

"In the United States particularly, the protest against

the war is voiced more and more strongly, under various

even the

soldiers.

The Assembly

calls for support to these progressive and

the United States, and

asks

the

governments antiwar forces in

to grant asylum

to deserters and to support their right to repatriation.

All together, the peoples of the world will efficiently

hein

to inpose on

the U.S. Governnent the restoration of peacc

and independence and

• freedom

in Victnan, Laos, and Canbndía."

to Disrupt

the Republican National Convention

SUMMARY:

There is little new evidence of foreign plans

or efforts

to inspire, support, or take

advantage of actions designed

to

disrupt or

harass the Republican National Convention in San

Diego,

21 to 23. August 1972. The Students for a Democratic

society, in joining the ranks of domestic groups planning

actions

at the

Republican Convention, has

adopted a proposal

to cooperate with Mexican workers and

students in a demonstra-

tion in Tijuana, Mexico, during the Convention.

The San Diego

Convention Coûlition (SDCC), another domestic group targetting

on the Convention, has received a letter of solidarity froi

the North Vietnamese. The letter is of interest as an indica-

tion of North Vietnamese contact with the SDCC; such contact

will be required for the SDCC to implement its

carlier-rchorted

plans for broadcasts over public address systems during the

Convention of live telephone calls from the Vietnamese in

Paris.

DEVELOPMENTS:

At its recent convention in Cambridge, Massachusetts,

held 30 March to 2 April 1972, the Students for a Democratic

Socioty (SDS) adopted a proposal

to hold demonstrations at

the San Diego-Tijuana border during the Republican National

Convention. The proposal included

a call for SDS io coopernte

with Mexican workers

and students in an action to occur during

a fiesta in Tijuana, where Convention delegates will be

entertained.

The North Vietnamese have given thcir endorsement to

the San Diego Convention Coalition (SDCC)

in the form of a

letter from the Vietnam Committce for Solidarity with the

American People (VCSHAP), a quasi official organ of the

North Vietnamese Government.

The letter, which has been

circulated by the SDCC and is dated 27 January 1972,

SUMMARY:

The only new indication of foreign plans or efforts

to inspire, support, influence, or exploit actions designed

to disrupt or harass the Republican National Convention in

Miami, Florida, 21-23 August 1972, is an expression of

connection with the political conventions of both major

• parties.

DEVELOPMESTS:

In mid-May 1972, a member of the North Vietnamese

Delegation to the Paris Peace Talks invited a visitor to

the visitor the New York City addresses of the People's

Coalition for Peace and Justice (PCPJ) and

the National

Peace Action Coalition (NPAC), and asked the visitor to

inquire at their offices regarding their plans for demonstra-

tions during the coming summer.

The North Vietnamese

especially interested

• in plans

for actions in connection with the Democratic and

Republican

of the bombing in

ietnam are being organi:

by the "Repub-

lican Party National Convention Coalition" to occur on

21 August 1972.

In an apparent reference to the 21 August

actions, the PCPJ leader added that representatives of the

Stockholm Conference on Vietnam will speak on the subject of

the alleged American bombing of dikes in North Vietnam.

(Comment: We have no present information concerning plans of

Stockholn Conference representatives to travel to the United

States during the

Republican

National Convention; nor do we

have any additional information concerning plans of Stockholm

Conference representatives to participate in activities con-

nected with

the Republican Convention.)

The Anti-War Union (ANU), a domestic group engaged

in

organizing counter-activities

at the Republican National Con-

vention, has sponsored the travel of a delegation of activists

to paris, France, to meet with officials of the Denocratic

Republic of dorth Vietnam (DRV) and the Provisional Revolu-

itionary Governnent of South Vietnam (PRG). An advance party

has already met with DRV and PRG representatives

to discuss

the agenda for meetings with the full diU delegation. Although

no infornation is presently available indicating

that actions

at the Republican Convention have been discussed or are sched-

uled to be discussed at mectings between the At delcgation

and the DRY/PRG officials, it is Inown that menbors of the NU

advance party have astied for advice from the PRG officials

regarding the stance

the Ail should take on certain questions

relating

to the presidential elections. It is also known

that

the

DRV officials

have questioned

the ANU advance party

about the political mood in the United States.

One of the

AlU delegation members has

stated that upon their return to

the United States about 26 July 1972, some of the members

will spoak at rallies, over the radio, and on tolevision,

to "educate the American people about the consequences of

voting for Nixon, and the need to end the war and defeat

Nixon."

The delegation member added that the demonstrations

•at-the Republican Convention will be "unique."

Foreign Support för Activities Planned to Disrupt

or Harass the Republican National Convention

SUMMARY:

There are no new indications of specific foreign plans or efforts to

inspire, support, influence, or exploit activities designca to disrupt or

harass the Republican National Convention in Miami, Florida, 21-24 August

1972. Although mectings have becn held recently in Paris, France, between

Amcrican antiwar activists and representatives of the Democratic Republic

of North Victriam (DRV) and the Provisional Revolutionary Government of

South Victnam (PRG), currently available information indicates that the

DRV/PRG officials made no efforts to encourage or give guidance to the

American participants with respect to the upcoming Republican National

Convention. Private discussions, separate from the meetings with the entire

American delegation, were conducted by both the DRV and the PRG officials;

at present, we have no information regarding the substance of these private

exchanges. A sccond group of activists, considered more important than

the first delegation, is scheculed to travel to Paris on or about 1 august 1972

for further consultations with the PRG and DRV representatives.

DEVELOPMENTS:

In recent meetings in Paris, France, with members of an American

delagation sponsored by the Anti-War Union (AWU), representatives of

the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV) and the Provisional Revolutionary

Government of South Vietnam (PRG) were very guarded with respect to dis-

cussing activities at the Republican National Convention. Although the Vietnam-

ese repeatedly questioned the Americans concerning the mood of the antiwar

movement in the United States, they made no direct reference to the Repub-

lican Convention, except for one instance when PRG Deputy Chief Nguyen

Van TIEN accused President Nixon of using the private and public sessions

of the Paris peace talks as "propaganda for the Republican Convention."

TIEN then urged the Americans to promote and propagandize the Seven

Point Plan offered by the PRG. The Americans, too, for the most part,

refrained from discussing the Convention, other than to estimate that demon-

strators will number about 10,000 at the Convention.

COMMOLSO DISSIM

Following their meeting on 22 July 1972 with the AWU delegation,

the PRG officials held additional talks with sub-groups of the delegation.

Additionally, at least one of the American participants was invited by

the DRV officials to return for further discussions. At present, there

Is no information available concerning the substance of these private

exchanges.

A second, more important delegation of Americans connected with

the Anti-War Union is scheduled to travel to Paris circa 1 August 1972

for further consultation with DRV and PRG representatives. This second

group is scheduled to be led by Rennic DAVIS, founcier and leader of the

AWU. This will be DAVIS' second trip to Paris within recent months for

discussions with DRV and PRG representatives. Upon his return from

his first trip, DAVIS publicly stated that the AWU would demonstrate at

both the Democratic and the Republican Convention, but that the AWU's

chief target would be the Republican Convention.

Foreign Support for Activities Planned to Disrupt

Or Harass the Democratic National Convention

SUBMARY AND CONCLUSION:

There are no direct indications thus. far of toreign

extorts to insplre, support or take advantage oi

activities

lesigned to disrupt or harass the National Convention of

the Democratic Party in Miami, 10-13 July 1972. The concept

of coordinated

international support for domestic activities

in the United States was generally endorsed at the recent

World Assembly for Peace and Independence of the Peoples

of Indochina; however, the Conference issued no specific

call for international support of disruptive actions at the

American national political conventions.

BACKGROUND:

At- the Soviet-controlled World Assembly for Peace

and Independence of the Peoples' of Indochina, held in

Versailles from 10-13 February 1972, there was mention of

American plans for demonstrations at both the Republican

and Democratic lational

resolution from

Conventions.

The final draft

the conference's "Action Commission" con-

tains an appendix submitted

by Ancrican delegates whose

goal was to socure global coordination for domestic actions

in the United States.

It calls for international support

to six wecks of domestic antivar

actions and

demonstrations,

From 1 April to 15 May 1972, and concludes with the state-

ment: "This campaign will lead up to the Democratic Party

•Convention at Miami on July 9, 1972, and the Republican

Party Convention in. San Diego on August 21, 1972."

The final "Resolution of the Paris World Assembly

for the Peace and Independence of the Indochinese People"

of 13 February 1972, drafted by the "Political Conmission"

states:

"In the United States particularly, the protest

against the

war is voiced more and more strongly,

under. Various forms, such as draft

now affect even the soldiers.

The Assembly

calls for support to these progressive and

antiwar forces in the United States, and asks

the governments to grant asylum to deserters

and to support their right to repatriation.

All together, the peoples of the world will

•efficiently help to impose on the U.S. Govern-

ment the restoration of peace, independence

Foreign Support for Activities Planned to Disrupt

or Harass the Democratic National Convention

SUMMARY:

New indications of foreign efforts or plans to inspire,

support, influence, or exploit actions designed to disrupt

or harass the Democratic National Convention in Miami, 10-13

July 1972, are linited to a reiteration by a member of the

Secrctariat of the Stockholm Corference on Vietnam of a

statement previously issued by the World Assembly for Peace

and Independence of the Peoples of Indochina.

The Assembly's

pronounccment generally endorsed the concept of internationai

support to a

campaign of anti-Vietnam War activities

in the

United States Icading up to the Denocratic and Republican

Conventions, but made no specific call for support of dis-

ruptive actions at the conventions themselves.

DEVELOPMENTS:

In early April 1972 an

influential and well-informed

staff wonber of the Stockholm Conference on

Vietnam discussed,

in private, the international anti-Vietnam lar activities

conducted

on 1, 15, and 22 April.

The Stockholm Conference

member

stated

that

these actions were part of an international

campaign in support of domestic American

antiwar efforts

during

the period 1 April to 15 May 1972, and "will culminate

at the clection conventions in July and August."

The World Assembly for Peace and Independence of the

Peoples of Indochina, of which the Stockholm Conference was

a major organizer, had carlier enunciated a similar statement

in an appendix to

the final draft resolution of the Assembly's

•"Action Commission." The appendix called for international

support to six weeks of domestic antivar actions

and denon-

strations, from I April to 15 May 1972, and concluded with

•the statement:

"This campaign will lead up

to the Democratic

Party Convention at Miami

on July 9, 1972, and the Republican

Party Convention in San Diego on August 21, 1972."

SUNMARY:

Indications remain linited of foreign plans or attempts

to inspire, support, influence, or exploit actions designed

to disrupt or harass the Democratic National Convention in

Miani, Florida, 10-13 July 1972.

A member of the Swedish

Connittee for Vietnam, who is also a member of the secre-

tariat of the Stockholm Conference on Vietnam, has

stated

that the U.S. National Elections are playing a role in

the Swedish Committee's work.

The British-based Interna-

tional Confederation for Disarmament

and Peace (ICDP) has

distributed a "Spring Offensive Calendar" of activities

in the United States against the war based on a submission

by the

Peoples' Coalition

for Peace and Justice (PCPJ).

The calendar includes actions planned in connection with

the Democratic Convention.

DEVELOPMENTS:

In mid-April 1972, a member of the Swedish Committee

for Vietnam, who is also an influential and well-informed

staff wember of the Secretariat of the Stockholm Conference

on Vietnam, stated in a private discussion of the Swedish

Committee's unusually heavy work load that "things will be

hectic right until the elections in the U.s."

The International Confederation for Disarmament and

Peace, a British-based antivar organization and onc of the

more prominent member organizations of

the Stockholm Con-

ference, has attached a

"Spring Offensive Calendar" to the

April-May 1972 issue of its regular international publica-

tion Vietnam International. The calendar had been

furnished

by the People's Coalition

for Peace and Justice (PCPJ) and

included the following entry:

MEMORANDUM FOR : : Deputy Director for Operations

SUBJECT

:

Areas of Possible Embarrassment

to the Agency

1. Sometime in the spring or early summer of 1971, Mr. John

Dean levied the requirement on the Agency for information relating to

the Investors Overseas Service (IOS). The original request was

non-spocific but it gradually emerged that Dean was concerned with

the possible adverse publicily thai might develop regarding the

President's nephew, who was employed by IOs.

2. There were multiple channels from the White House to the

Agency on this subject:

a. Presumably Haldeman and/or Ehrlichman to Director

Helms.

b. Someone (unnamed) in the White House to the DDCI,

General Cushman (sce attached telephone conversation).

Note that Ehilichian is mentioned, and

c.

John Dean to the CI Staff. These various channels

were sorted out in time and six reports were passed by

the CI Staff to Mr. Fred Fielding for Mr. John Dean.

3. The telephone call of General Cushman's is of interest since

it gives the flavor of White House concern.

It took several days to

uncover the fact that the White House interest centered on the involve-

ment of the Picsident's nephew with IOS and possible adverse publicity.

• The reports submitted to Dean's office were routine in nature and were

coordinated with the DCI. After a few months, interest in this sub-,

ject died down and we did not pursue it further.

" 4. Please return the attachments when they have served your

purpose.

5. I also include a short note on the Intelligence Evaluation

Committee and Staff prepared by Richard Ober.

The original

meetings were held in the office of John Dean at the White House

and the principal sparkplug for this group activity was the then

Assistant Attorney General for Internal Security, Robert Mardian

and then later his assistant, William Olsen. It is noted that Mi.

Mardian is now appearing before the Grand Jury and it is always

possible that he might draw in the Agency. •

6. Before appointing Ober to the IES Staff as the Agency

representative, I had allended various inter-agency mectings pre-

sided over by Mardian. I expressed the view to Director Helms

that Mardian would require very careful handling due to his inex-

perience.

Furthermore, Mardian was deeply involved in the split

between Bill Sullivan and Mr. Hoover. On a confidential basis

one or two senior FBI officials stated that Sullivan was secretly

passing files to Mardian without Mr. Hoover's permission.

This

was one of the important reasons why Sullivan was dismissed from

the Bureau.

SUBJECT: The MHCHAOS Program

1. The MHCHAOS program is a worldwide program

for

clandestine collection abroad of information on foreign

efforts to support/encourage/exploit/manipulate domestic

U.S. extremism, especially by Cuba, Communist China,

North Vietnam,

the Soviet Union, North Korea and the

Arab fedayeen.

2. - The MHCHAOS program has not and is not conduct-

ing efforts domestically for internal domestic collection

purposes. Agency efforts arc foreign. Foreign-oriented

activity in the United States has been of tio types:

a .

Selected FBI domestic

sources who travel

abroad in connection with their extremist activity

and/or affiliations

make

contact with hostilc

foreign powers or with forcign cxtremist groups

have

been briefed

and debricfed by caiquartois

officers.

The

bricting has

included appropriate

operational guidance, including defensive advice.

b. Americans with existing

extremist creden-

tials have been assessed, recruited, tested and

dispatched abroad for PCS

assignnchts as contract

the F5i"

primarily sources offered

for

such use by

ilhen

abroad

they collect information re-

sponsive to MICHAOS program requirements,

as well

as other Agency icquirements.

They are

thus

used

prinarily for targeting against Cubans, Chinese Com-

munists, the North Vietnamese, otc., as their back-

ground and their particular access permits.

It

should be noted that the

MPTROIKI aspect of the

MPLODESTAR project of the

East Asia Division is

similar to the MICHAOS PROGRi•.

3. As indicated earlier, MCHAOS is a foreign pro-

gram, conducted overseas, except for the limited activity

described above. The program is and has been managed so

as to achieve the maximum

feasible utilization of exist-

ing resources of the Operations Dircctorate.

have been recuited and run exclusively for the MICHAOS

program.

Instead, emphasis has

been placed on the exploi-

tation of new and

old agency assets who have a by-product

capability or a concurrent capability for provision of

information responsive to the program's requirements.

This has involved the provision of custom-tailored collec-

tion requirements

and operational guidance.

This collec-

tion program is viewed as an

integral part of the recruit-

ment and collection programs of China Operations, Vietnam

Cuban Operations, Soviet Bloc Division opera-

tions and korean Branch operations. Agents who have an

American "Movement" background or who have known connec-

tions with the

American

agents to obtain biographic and personality

data, to dis-

cern possible vulncrabilities and suscoptibilitius; and

to develop operationally exploitable relationships with

recruitment targets of the abore programs.

These assets

are of interest

to our

targets because of their connec-

tions with and/or knowledge of the American "Movement."

Over

the course of the MHCHAOS program, there have been

approximately to important areas of

operational interest

which at the present time have

been reduced to about ton:

Paris, Stockholm,

Brussels, Dar Es Salaam, Conakry, Algiers,

Mexico City, Santiago, Ottawa and Hong Kong.

4. The MCHAOS program also utilizes audio opera-

tions,

two of which have

been implemented to cover

tar-

gets

of special interest.

Paragraph a. deleted because it reveals a sensitive

foreign operation.

Paragraph b. deleted because it reveals a sensitive

Agency foreign operation.

5. MHCHAOS reporting from abroad relating to the

program originates in two ways: Individuals who are noted

in contact with Cubans, the Chinese Communists, etc., and

who appear to have extremist connections, interests

sackground are reported upon. Other individuals are re-

ments received from the FBI because such individuals are

6.

All cable and dispatch traffic related to the

MHCHAOS program is

sent via

restricted channels.

It is

not processed by either the Cable Sccretariat or the In-

tormation Services Division.

The control and retriev-

ability of infornation obtained, including information

received from the FBI, is the responsibility of the Spe-

cial Opcrations Group.

7.

Information responsive to specific FBI require-

ments is disseminated to the fBl via spocial controlled

dissemination channels, 1.e., by restricted handling cablo

cratiic or via special pouch

memoranda.

and specially numbered blind

8. Information of particular significance, when col-

lected, has been disseminated by special memorandum over

the signature of the Director of Contral Intelligence to

the White liouse (Di. Kissinger and John Dean), as well as

to the Attorney General, the Sccrotary of State and the

The

answers

to your questions are as follows:

a.

Question: Do we recruit Americans?

Answer:

Yes, we recruit Americans to be

used as academic support assots and access agents.

These Americans are used for spotting and assess-

ment purposes only and do not perform any rccruit-

ments.

Paragraph 1. b. and l. c. are deleted

because they contain sensitive agency

operational methods and techniques.

d. Question: What is the arrangement re. recruiting

out of colleges? Any clearances or prohibitions?

Answer: As of now CSI 50-10 specifically

requires approval by the. ADDO or DDO for any

recruitment attempt made in the United States

against an American member of the academic

community or a foreign target attending an American

academic institution. This regulation is presently in

the process of revision in thai this approval authority

for academic recruitments in the United States is to

be delcgated to Chief, FR. The approval authority

for recruitment attempts against American students

outside the United States is to be delegated to the Chief

of the appropriate area division. The only prohibitions

at the present time are those precluding iccruitment

attempts against foreign students here in the United States

on grants from Ford Foundation, Rockcfeller or Fulbright.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director for Operations

SUBJECT:

Foreign Resources Division Operational

Activities with Possible Flap Potential

1. At thr risk of stating the obvious, almost all of the operational

activities carried on by FR Division in the United States run the risk

that unauthorized disclosure could create embarrassment to the Agency.

We have accepted this as a condition precedent and have proceeded with

our operational activities in the most professional manner possible under

the circumstances. There aïe cortain rather unusual activities in which

FR Division has participated and/or is participating that contain some-

what greater possibility for embarrassment if discovered. I have listed

these below, not necessarily in order of embarrassment potential:

a.

JFK Act 5 (g) (2) (D)

provides a fairly considerable

amount of support to Dr. Kissinger in his contacts with the

Chinesc. This support was authorized by Mr. Karamessines

and Mr.

Helms. Thus far there has been no problem other

than the inordinate amount of time spent by

JFK Act 5 (g) (2) (D)

personnel, not to mention the fairly sizeable amount of

money that has been expended in support of these efforts.

b. A CIA Officer

is to be assigned to FR Division.

The

CIA Officer is presently assigned overseas

under deep

cover;

JFK Act 5 (9) (2) (D)

In discussions between

NOCAD and the ADDO, it was decided that the Officei

would

be pulled out

and reassigned in the United States.

FR Division was directed to accept this officer for assignment.

We have concluded that the best solution is to have this

officer attend a university in the Midwest for at least

a year, working towards an advanced degice until there

has been time for the situation to clarify itself. We plan

to make no operational use of tie CIA Officer waïsoever,

during the period of time that he is attending the university.

Upon completion of his year's study, we will review the .

situation and decide the nesi course of action at that time.

Paragraph 1. c. is deleted because it contains sensitive

Agency operational methods and techniques.

VIII. Coordination

A.

Internal

In developing its cadre of general support assets

and access agents, the FR Division maintains close contact

with the Domestic Contact Service of the Directorate

for

Intelligence, using their assets wherever and

whenever

possible to support FR's operational activities.

To a

more linited degree, FR Bases maintain contacts with Office

of Security and Office of Personnel field representatives,

pursuing the occasional leads surfaced by these officers

and using their entre to specific individuals who can

provide access to targets of operational interest.

B.

External

FR officers

in the field maintain coordination with

their FBI counterparts. There is limited cooperation

with Bureau offices on internal security cases involving

Soviet and Bloc officials and the local FBI offices are

of occasional help in operations involving other nationals.

The local

field offices of the FBI are made aware of the

presence of FR officers in their jurisdictions and have

on

occasion provided backstopping on cases where there was.

some flap potential.

Coordination with the FBI of FR Division's agent

recruitment activity is governed by an agreement between

the Agency and the FBI dated 7 February 1966.

The Bases

also have contact with local Immigration

and Naturalization

Service offices although these contacts

are less frequent and less important than the contacts

with "the FBI offices.

Certain data in this file is

exempt from public disclosure pursuant to the provisions of

Title 5, United States Code, Section 552 (b) (2), (b) (5), and

these exemptions

allow cor the withholding of intormation related solely to the

internal personnel rules and practices of an agency; inter-

agency or intra-agency documents not available through discovery

proceedings during litigation; information which would constitute

an unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of another

individual; and information which would disclose the identity

of a confidential source.

The other file pertains to an invostigation concerning

a threat against your life.

Although your name is carried in

the title throughout the file as the "victin," only a minimal

amount of information refers to you.

The file indicates that

the Denver Police Department received information that a

particular individual

was in Denver to kill you if you were

elected as United States Senator from Colorado on November 5,

1974; that the polls indicated you would be elected; that you

and your Denver Office were aware of this threat; that the

Denver Police Department afforded protection for you until you

departed Denver the morning of Novenber 6, 1974, for vacation

in Mexico; and that an Agent of this Bureau attempted to see

you to display a phocograph of the suspect, but was advised

by your assistant that the Denver Police Department had

At the meeting between Mr. Kelley and the Attorney

General, along with their respective staffs on 7/21/75, the Attorney

General determined that there should be broad disclosure of material

in the files of those Senators on the Senate Select Committee requesting

access to same and that in the main the Bureau should only restrict

access to revelation of live informants or information which would

reveal the identity of live informants. In addition, he indicated that

in his review of the file on Senator Hart he noted certain derogatory

information on relatives which he felt Senator Hart should not see.

AlSO, there may be criminal investigations against one of the Senators

of such a nature that revelation should be restricted.

It was agreed that Deputy Assistant Attorney General

O'Connor and I should review the files in order to determine problem

areas and Mr. O'Connor would consult vite hase Tylor as sea

Files have been reviewed and there is general agreement

that almost all of the information can be revealed with certain limited

excisions taking care of problem areas. Mr. O'Connor advised On

7/24/75 that he has been in touch with the Committee and they will make

arrangements to come to my office and review their fifes Ahmy presence

along with Mr. O'Connor. Senator Goldwater has added his name to the

FBI INFORMATION-GATHERING PRACTICES

WITH RESPECT TO MEMBERS OF CONGRESS

There is a total of more than 6,500,000 files at

FBI Headquarters.

Most of these contain information gathered

during investigation of matters--including some 100 types of

criminal, security, and applicant-employee cases--assigned to

the FBI by laws of Congress, directives of the President, and

orders of the Attorney General.

" the Attorney benera:

The remainder of these more than 6,500,000 files

include:

(1) Personnel files regarding FBI applicants.and

employees;

(2)

General files regarding FBI contacts and

dealings with a variety of individuals and

organizations concerning matters that do

not require of involve FBI investigation; and

: (3)

Administrative-type files, such as those of a

policy nature, those containing statistical

reports, those detailing FBI cooperative

services, and the like.

An unknown, but extremely small, percentage of

these more than 6,500,000 FBI files contain information

regarding present or former Congressmen ana Senators which

mays have been accumulated prior to, during, or after their

tenure in Congress.

WHAT FBI FILES CONTAIN ON CONGRESSMEN:

FBI Files contain substantially the same types of

information regarding Senators and Congressmen as is contained

in them about other citizens.

Basically this information falls

into the following categories:

Violations of Law

(1)

Allegations that Congressmen or Senators have

violated Federal. laws within the FBI's jurisdiction.

The FBI investigates such allegations whether they

relate to Members of Congress or any other person.

The

results of these investigations are furnished to United States

Attorneys and/or other prosecutive officials of the Department

of Justice. The investigation may establish (a) that the

Congressnan or Senator has, in fact, violated a Federal law,

(b) that a Federal law has been violated, but that the involve-

ment of the Congressman or Senator in that violation cannot be

established, (c)

that a Federal law has been violated, but

that the Congressman or Senator clearly had no involvement

in its violation, or (d) that no violation of Federal law

was

committed.

Included among such allegations involving Congress-

men and Senators have been the following types of violations

within the FBI's jurisdiction: Bank Fraud and Embezzlement;

Conflict of Interest; Conspicacy to Obstruct Justice; Election

Laws; Fraud Against the Government; and Interstate Transporta-

tion

in Aid of Racketeering.

(2) Violations of Federal laws within the FBI's

jurisdiction involving Congressmen and Senators as victims.

The results of FBI investigations of such violations

are furnished to United States Attorneys and/or other prosecu-

tive officials of the Department of Justice.

the original complaint in these cases

In many instances,

is received from the law-

maker-victim himself; however, if the information originates

elsewhere, the FBI promptly notifies the Congressman or. Senator

involved of the threat which has been made.

In addition; other

law enforcement agencies which have a legitimate interest in

these cases are notified of the threat.

Violations of the Congressional Assassination, Kid-

naping and Assault Statute, Bomb Threats, and Extortion

are

among the crimes within the

FBI's jurisdiction which have

involved lawmakers as victims.

(3) Allegations that members of the staffs of

Congressmen or Senators have violated Federal laws within the

FBI'S

jurisdiction, or that these staff members have been

victims of such violations.

The FBI investigates such allegations and furnishes

the results to United States Attorneys and/or other prosecutive

officials of the Department of Justice. Where appropriate, the

Congressman or Senator involved is also advised of the investi-

gation.

NW 65360 Docld:32989624 Page 209

## Page 210

Congressmen and Senators may be interviewed by the

FBI in these cases involving Congressional aides--just as they

may be interviewed in connection with other types of FBI

investigations--and both the fact of, and the results of,

such interviews are noted in the file reflecting the FBI

investigation.

(4) Allegations that Senators or Congressmen have

violated laws within the jurisdiction of other investigative

agencies.

These allegations are brought to the attention of

the agency concerned--Federal, state, or local. Such allega-

tions are not investigated by the FBI. However, the coopera-

tive services of the FBI Laboratory, Identification Division,

and National Crime Information Center are available to other

law enforcement agencies in the investigation of these, as

well as other, crimes.

Applicant Investigations

(5)

Present and former Congressmen and Senators

often are considered for positions in the Executive or

Judicial Branches of the Federal Government which require

that the FBI conduct a thorough background investigation

of them.

Dependent, upon the nature of the position involved,

the results of these investigations are furnished to the White

House, the Department of Justice, and/or other appropriate

Government agencies.

• (6) Congressmen and Senators often are interviewed

in the course of applicant-type investigations regarding

other persons who are being considered for Executive or

Judicial positions--as well as during applicant-type investi-

gations conducted by the FBI (at the request of the Committee

chairman involved) concerning staff members of a limited

number of House and Senate Committees. Both the fact of, and

the results of, the interview of the Congressman or Senator

are noted in the file reflecting the FBI's investigation.

Security Cases

(7) Either prior to, during, or subsequent to their

tenure in Congress, there may be files pertaining to security-

type matters which

relate to members of the House and Senate,

or Congressmen may be identified in FBI files as actual or

intended victims of acts by subjects of security-type cases.

## Page 211

The Statutes covering such matters are Title 18, Section 2383

'(Rebellion and Insurrection), Title 18, Section 2384

(Seditious

Conspiracy), and Title 18, Section 2385 (Smith Act -

Advocating overthrow of Government by force).

Oral or Written Contact

(8) An unknown number of FBI files contain copies

of correspondence between the FBI and Congressmen and Senators

concerning a wide variety of matters which include bills

pending in, or passed by, Congress; personnel matters; the

Bureau's cooperative services; and

FBI policies, procedures,

and investigations. Many of these letters from Congressmen

anã Senators have been prompted by inquiries which these

lawmakers have received from constituents or other interested

citizens.

The FBI's files also contain memoranda regarding

telephone calls and personal contacts the FBI has had with

Congressmen and Senators regarding the above-cited variety

of matters.

Miscellaneous Information About Congressmen

(9) An unknown number of FBI files contain informa-

tion reflecting

favorably or unfavorably upon the character,

integrity, and loyalty of Senators and Congressmen--which

information does not require investigative action at the time

received on the part of the FBI or other law enforcement

• agencies. It consists of:

(a) Information contained in unsolicited letters

received by the FBI from persons and organi-

zations representing a variety of backgrounds,

viewpoints, and walks of life.

(b)

(c)

Information volunteered orally to FBI Agents by

the same broad range of individuals and organi.-

zations as cited directly above.

Newspaper clippings, as well as data from

magazines ana

other

news dissemination media.

(d)

Miscellaneous information received from FBI COn-

fidential informants and/or other sensitive sources.

Fingerprints of Congressmen

(10 )

The files of the Identification Division

contain the fingerprints of an unknown number of Senators

and Congressmen.

Some of these relate to their having been

arrested for violations of Federal, state, or local laws.

Others are noncriminal in origin and largely pertain to

their having served in the Asmed Forces or having been appli-

cants for various positions.

These fingerprint cards have

been submitted to

the FBI by Federal agencies, as well as by

local, county, and state criminal justice agencies, throughout

the United States.

Fingerprint records are maintained by the FBI's

Identification Division, and they are kept entirely separate

and apart from all other files and records of the FBI.

HOW INFORMATION ABOUT CONGRESSMEN REACHES FBI FILES:

There are two basic types of information regarding

Congressmen and

• Senators in FBI files:

(1) Information which the FBI has solicited during

investigations involving the Congressman or Senator as either

a subject or a victim.

This includes information of

pertinence to the case which the lawmaker himself has

furnished to the FBI.

(2) Unsolicited Information.

there are many sources of the unsolicited information

that is included in FBI files:

(a)

It is volunteered by citizens who are being

interviewed during investigations of matters

having no relationship to any of our Nation's

lawmakers.

(b)

It is volunteered in communications sent to the

FBI by individuals and organizations.

(c) It is included in news articles and

other reports

publicly disseminated by our Nation's news media

which come to the FBI's attention.

(2)

It is received from FBI confidential informants

and, very infrequently, from telephone taps not

directed at a Congressman which have been

installed with authority of a Federal Court

and/or authority of the Attorney General.

-"I"

NW 65360 Docld:32989624 Page 212

---

## Page 213

(e) In the case of information contained on finger-

print cards, it is sent to the FBI's Identifica-

tion Division by authorized contributors,

including criminal justice agencies throughout

the United States.

HOW AND WHERE INFORMATION ABOUT CONGRESSMEN IS MAINTAINED:

Information regarding Congressmen ana Senators is

included in the official FBI files--totaling more than

6,500, 000 in number--that are maintained by the Files and

Communications Division on an upper floor of the J. Edgar

Hoover FBI Building.

The area where these files are maintained is staffed

and supervised 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to assure

continuous security.

General Index

The essential key to the effective use of these FBI

files is the Bureau's General Index which consists of 58

million index cards and which is located on a different floor

from the files themselves in the J. Edgar Hoover FBI Building.

To determine what files (if any at all) contain information

regarding an individual Senator or Congressman, it is

necessary to search the name of that lawmaker in the General

Index.

The General Index is staffed and supervised 24 hours

a day, 7 days a week, to assure continuous security.

Rules Governing Use of Files

These official FBI files are available only to FBI

personnel--and they are available on a "need-to-know" basis

only.

The Files and Communications Division maintains a

record of files that have been charged out by Headquarters

personnel.

Such files must be returned to the Files and

Communications Division as

soon as possible; and during the

period that a file is charged out, it cannot be left even

momentarily in an unlocked room.

If retained overnight,

the file must be kept in a

• locked cabinet inside a locked

room.

NW 65360 Docld:32989624 Page 213

---

## Page 214

The charge-out record is temporary in nature and

is destroyed five days after the file has been returned to

the Files

and Communications Division.

WHY THE FBI RETAINS INFORMATION REGARDING CONGRESSMEN:

The information regarding Congressmen and Senators

that is maintained in FBI files can be divided into three

major categories:

(1) The results of investigations (criminal-,

security, and applicant-type) involving a Congressman or

Senator as a subject or victim;

(2) Information regarding a Congressman or Senator--

in addition to that gathered during investigation(s) of the

lawmaker involved--which the FBI has disseminated to other

Federal agencies (such as to the Internal Revenue Service if, for

example, the information involves a tax-related matter) and/or to

state and local law enforcement agencies (such as the police

department covering the lawmaker's home community if, for example,

the information involves an alleged threat against the lawmaker's

house or other property; and

(3) Other information that. the FBi receives from,

or receives about,

a Congressman or Senator that is included

in the FBI's files--without having been either investigated

or disseminated by the FBI.

The reasons this information is retained in FBI

files can be explained in legal and administrative terms,

as well as in practical terms.

Legal and Administrative Reasons

All investigative files and other records of the

FBI involving Congressmen.or Senators are within a class

of records which-under the FBI Records Retention Plan

developed in 1969 by the National Archives and Records

Service of the General Services

Administrationare con-

sidered of enduring archival value to ensure their preser-

vation.

This FBI Records Retention Plan was prepared under

the authority contained in the Federal Records Act of 1950,

which is contained in Title 44 of the United States Code.

- 7-

NW 65360 Docld:32989624 Page 214

---

## Page 215

Included among the FBI records to be retained

under the Records Retention Plan formulated by the National

Archives and Kecords Service are those which would have

historical value and would document policies, procedures,

functions, legislative and budget matters, and the like--

and reports of investigations of both civil and criminal

activities, including "crimes involving, and other records,

concerning, the Presidents and Vice Presidents of the

United States, members of and delegates elected to the

Congresses of

the United States, cabinet heads, judges and

other officials appointed by the President."

In "'stablishing the FBI Records Retention Plan,

the National Archives and Records Service noted, "Ordinarily

the records of a Federal agency that are worthy of permanent

retention amount to a cather small percentage of the total

volume of records generated.

Many of the records produced

by the Federal. Bureau of Investigation, however, relate to

a number of controversial if not important aspects of the

history of the United States, particularly to the role of

the Federal Government in its relation to its citizens.

To be sure,

many years will pass before these records can

be made available to the public for historical and other

sérious research. Nevertheless, the archival value of these

recoras will nut decrease nor will interest in them dissipate."

In addition, the FBI is also required by the

Federal Recorus Act to make records containing adequate and

proper documentation of its administration and operations

which, among lither things, are designed to furnish informa-

tion necessary to protect the legal and financial interest

of the Governient and of persons directly affected by FBI

activities.

Practlval Reasons for Retaining Information

Logic, reason, and lessons learned from more than

six decades o! law enforcement experience dictate that the

FBI should maintain records of investigations it has conducted

(category #1 cited at the top of page 7) and records of

information it has disseminated to other agencies (category #2

on page 7) .

Such records enable the FBI to answer questions or

challenges (incluäing those arising in judicial or administra-

tive proceedins) involving investigations FBI Agents have

conducted and,r information the FBI has disseminated io other

n8 c

NW 65360 Docld:32989624 Page 215

## Page 216

1

agencies.

Such records also enable the FBI to furnish additional

copies of investigative reports or other information that has

been disseminated-should additional copies be needed by the

original recipients or by other official agencies.

Furthermore,

the information contained in these files often proves of

assistance in future investigations.

Less obvious may be the reasons why the FBI retains

the third category of information about Congressmen and

Senators (data that has neither been investigated nor

disseminated by the FBI) cited on page 7.

If such information is of an administrative nature--

that is, if the information indicates the lawmaker is interested

in a specific FBI investigation, a specific area of the FBI'S

jurisdiction, or specific FBI policies, practices and procedures-

it is filed for:

(1) the information and advice of FBI employees in

connection with future contacts or correspondence with that

Congressman or Senator;

(2) consideration of FBI personnel in connection

with possible future changes in FBI policies, practices, and

procedures.

If the information is of a personal nature--that is,

if it reflects upon the loyalty, character, or integrity of a

lawmaker--it is included in FBI files for the following reasons:

(1) The information may prove of value when

present or former Congressman of Senator is considered for

a position in the Executive or Judicial Branch of Government

which requires that the FBI conduct a backgrouna investiga-

irog that the ive

tion of him.

(2) The information could prove of value in

solving future crimes committed against the Congressman or

Senator-or against members of that lawmaker's family.

(A person who berates and defames a lawmaker would be a

logical suspect if that Lawmaker-or another Congressman

or Senator whose views coincide with his--becomes the

target of actual or threatened violence.)

(3) The information could aid the FBI in solving

crimes committed against other persons. (For example, the

handwriting, typewriting, stationery, and/or distinctive

phraseology in a letter defaming a Congressman could assist

the FBI in linking the writer of that letter to a subsequent

ext meier note congrest-en bomb threat that, does not involve

(4) The information frequently provides valuable.

insight into the character, stability, and reliability of

the person who has furnished it to the FBI. Thereby, it is

of value and assistance to the FBI in future contacts

with,

contacts by, or inquiries regarding, this individual.

(5) The information provides a useful administra-

tive check on the performance of FBI field offices--

particularly with regard to the important consideration of

whether they are being fully responsive to the public needs.

Supervisory personnel regularly review complaints or

allegations received from the public to insure that the

appropriate action was taken--if, in fact, action was called

for.

WHAT IS REQUIRED TO DESTROY FILE INFORMATION:

Barring a new law of Congress and/or receipt of a

revised FBI Records

Retention Plan from the National Archives

and Records Service, the FBI cannot unilaterally undertake

the destruction of information regarding Congressmen and

Senators in its files.

This memorandum recommends that the Director raise the

question of privacy and source protection with Senators of the

Senate Select Committee (SSC) on the occasion of his anticipated

meeting in Executive Session with the SSC tentatively scheduled

for the week of 7/14/75.

By letter dated 7/9/75, Senators Frank Church and

John Tower of SSC requested the Attorney General and the

Director to appear before the Committee in Executive Session

during the week of 7/14/75.

The purpose of this meeting is

to

discuss the matter of concern to Mr. Kelley and steps which

might be taken to expedite the response to requests for documents!

expedite the

essential to the Committee inquiry.

The Senstudy staff of the Intelligence Division is

preparing for the Director's use copies of each of the written

requests received from SSC annotated with the dates of our

response to each request; the date it was delivered to the

Department; and the date it was delivered to the SSC staff.

There remains, however, a serious problem precipitated

by three recent written

requests

of the SSC dated 6/30/75 (received

by the Bureau on 7/7/75); 7/1/75 (received by the Bureau on

7/8/75); and 7/8/75 (received by the FBI on 7/9/75). All three

of these requests appear, in part,

to disregard the privacy of

certain individuals or requests

the identity of sources

cooperating with the FBI.

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall

RE:

SENSTUDY ' 75

In this regard, in an exchange of letters dated

3/11 and 12/75,

William Colby in his role as the Director

of Central Intelligence, wrote to Senator Church stating.

that "I am particularly appreciative of your recognition

that certain sensitive aspects of our intelligence activities

must receive special consideration and treatment by the Select

Committee in the course of your work.

As we discussed, such

matters as the identities oi our sensitive sources. . . •

should be protected not only from exposure, but indeed from

the risk of exposure. We should

also work

together to protect

certain other information which, if improperly disclosed,

might impair the privacy rights

of the individuals."

By letter dated 3/12/75, Senator Church stated as

follows, "It is the Committee's understanding that the members

of the Committee and designated staff will have access to any

or all information which the Committee deems necessary for its

inquiry.

We recognize, however,

that the Committee inquiry

may touch on sensitive

areas,

such as the identities of CIA

personnel, sources, or cooperating organizations whose

disclosure could place persons in actual jeopardy. In the

event that the Committee inquiry touches on such sensitive

areas, which matters we have already discussed in our meeting

of February 27, we should discuss jointly, and as you suggested

quickly, what procedures might be followed should the Committee

decide it requires more information in these specific areas."

The 6/30/75 SSC letter requests among other things,

a list of all police departments and personnel contacted

relative to a particular COINTELPRO operation; a list of all

media persons contacted in relation to this COINTELPRO and

the media affiliation.

The 7/1/75 SSC letter requests a list of all persons

contacted in relation to four persons who were subjects of

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall

RE:

SENSTUDY '75

COINTELPRO operations.

This same letter also notes that one

Morris Starsky, one of the four persons referred to above,

was made known

to the FBI during a conference on 6/12/75, as

a person who would be the subject of a case study by the SSc.

This is not so. Inquiry was made of those Bureau supervisors

who attended the conference and a review of the memorandum

written following the conference was made. Neither the

memorandum nor the recollection of Bureau

supervisors attending

the conferencé indicates the name Morris Starsky was mentioned

by SSC staff personnel.

The 7/8/75 SSC letter requests among other things:

(1) all memoranda and other materials which relate to a meeting

between the President and Roy Wilkins, A. Philip Randolph,

Whitney Young, Mrs. Dorothy Haight, James Farmer and Jack

Greenberg on

11/19/64; (2) a copy of a November, 1964, telegram

from Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., to Director Hoover and all

notes, memoranda, and any other materials reflecting the

disposition of, or actions taken as a result of the receipt

of, said telegram; (3) all memoranda and other materials which

relate to a meeting between the President and Dr. King on

2/9/65; (4) all other materials which relate to the transfer of

former Special Agent Robert C. Nichols to the Oklahoma Office of

the t'Bt in June, 1969; (5) all forms and attachments including

forms entitled "Performance Rating Guide For Investigative

Personnel," from 1959 until retirement for former Special

Agents Robert C. Nichols and Alan Sentinella.

OBSERVATION:

It would appear the above cited requests do, in fact,

violate the privacy of individuals and possibly place in jeopardy

the identity of persons who cooperated with the FBI. Consistent

with the agreement in the exchange of letters between Colby and

Church dated 3/11 and 12/75, it is believed the Director should

raise these questions with the sue and attempt to get reliel

from the requirement of revealing the names of FBI sources or

violating the privacy of individuals.

Certainly the request for

information on former Special Agents Nichols and Sentinella goes

to the heart of the privacy issue and appears to be a blatant

disregard for their privacy.

By letter dated July 9, 1975, Senators Frank Church

It is my intention to request the Committee to

relieve the FBI from the obligation of violating the

privacy rights. ot individuals or placing in jeopardy

TO STUDY GOVERNMENTAL OPERATIONS WITH

RESPECT TO INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

Reference is made to the Attorney General's letter,

July 16, 1975, captioned as above, requesting intormation

relating

• to the collection, analysis, use, and dissemination

of organized crime intelligence.

On June 25, 1974, the Director testified before

of the Senate Judiciary.

Committee that the Bureau has "no statutory authority to

collect intelligence per se" but that it operates under the

general umbrella of 28 U.S.C. 533 (3), which authorizes the

Attorney General to appoint

officials

"to conduct...investiga

tions regarding official matters...as may be directed by the

Attorney General." A listing of

any directives issued by

the Department or the Attorney General with respect to organized

crime should be available in the office of the Assistant

Attorney General, Criminal Division, Department of Justice.

With respect to the FBI, all our investigations in

the organized crime field are aimed at one ultimate objective:

prosecution.

458

hoodlums

During the course of our

and the various criminal syndicates operating through-

out the United States, we naturally acquire considerable data

regarding

the structure of the organized underworld, the

identities of its principal leaders, the extent of its in-

its primary sources of income, its payoffs to corrupt

officials, and the operations of its vast communteations networks.

Memorandum to Mr. Cleveland

Re:

United States Senate Select Committee

To Study Governmental Operations With

Respect to Intelligence Activities

Most of this information is obtained from paid

informants, from other law enforcement officers, from aler

citizens, and from court-approved electronic surveillances

installed under the provisions of Title III of the Omnibus

•Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968.

None of it, however, is intelligence for intelligence's

sake. The experience of the FBI over the years has shown that

criminal syndicates exist for the sole purpose of conducting

illegal operations and that anyone belonging to them may

reasonably be presumed to be engaged in one or more of these

activities. Therefore, our investigations of the organized

underworld

are not aimed at developing general nonspecific

data but at establishing which criminal violations its members

are engaged in and then proving these violations in a court

of law.

Obviously, not every case opened, every lead followed,

or every bit of information received is going to wind up in

Federal court.

On the contrary, much of this material relates

to offenses outside the investigative jurisdiction of the

FBI.

When such is the case, we immediately disseminate the

informatión to the appropriate Federal, state, or local agency.

As a result, information uncovered by the FBI during the past

five years

alone has enabled the recipient agencies to make

1151, 000, 000,000 organized crime arrests; confiscate over

worth of illicit drugs and narcotics, $9,000,000

worth of

cash, property, weapons, and wagering paraphernalia,

and: $6,000,000 worth of counterfeit bills; and assess tax

liens against $19,000,000 worth of property arising out of

Federal gambling

cases.

In addition, a considerable portion of the organized

crime intelligence information developed by the FBI is for-

warded to the various Federal Strike Forces coordinating

racket investigations throughout the country and to the

Criminal Division of the Department, which has entered this

information in its computerized data bank called "Racketéer

Profile."

Pursuant to a request from SA Thomas J. McNiff

SA Daly of this Division contacted Michael Shaheen, Deputy Special

Counsel for Intelligence Coordination for the Department, on 7-22-75

concerning the current policy regarding excisions which may properly

be made on documents being furnished to the Senate Select Committee

for their review in Bureau space and the policy concerning notes being

taken during the Committee staffers review of such materials.

Shaheen stated that there is no agreement currently in

operation concerning excisions, however, he telt that excisions should

be properly restricted to the protection of sources, sensitive techniques

or methods concerning sensitive ongoing operations. He noted that this -

is in general conformity with the proposed agreement concerning this matter

which was being reviewed at the White House. Regarding the question

raised concerning the taking of notes, Shaheen indicated that the proposed

new agreement allowed for the taking of notes on these documents which

notes may be taken to the Senate Select Committee offices. In fact,

Special Counsel for Intelligence Coordination, K. William O'Connor, who

was present during this discussion pointed out it was the intent of the

aforementioned proposed agreement that "screened documents" may be

removed by the Committee staff members to the Senate Select Committee

offices. With this in mind, Shaheen stated we should allow the statt

CIA item described as Project WESTPOINTER apparently

involved the examination of mail to the U.S. from Mainland

China during certain specific months of 1969, 1970 and 1971.

ClA indicated that Project WESTPOINTER was similar to Project

SRPOINTER.

EbIHE COMVENT: Our files contain no information

concerning Project WESTPOINTER.

Memorandum from Acting

assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, dated 4/1/75,

captioned "Jane Fonda v. I.

Patrick Gray, et al.; Civil Action

i 24 A03ion

No. 73-2442-MML (C.D. Cal.)," describes a CIA covert operation

known as SRPOINTER which involved examination of mail to and

from the Soviet Union which was discontinued in 2/73.

Apparently, CIA had examined certain mail addressed to Jane

Fonda in connection with its SPOINTER activity.

While we

were not aware of CIA's Project WESTPOINTER, it is noted that

this Bureau did periodically examine mail coming from the

People's Republic of China (PRC) and Hong Kong to the U.s.

and mail from the U.S. to the PRC and Hong Kong during the

period 1956-1966.

This activity, which was permanently dis-

continued 1/24/66, was carried under the code names CHIPROP

and CHICLET.

Public disclosure of the CIA item referred to

above as project WastPOINter might lead to a more detailed

public examination of this Bureau's periodic control of mail

in the CHIPROP and CHICLET operations.

In response to a Senate Select Committee request for

H. N. Bassett to W. R. Wannall dated 6/2/75, captioned as above,

noted there would be no objection to a review of the Handbooks

members provided the review was conducted in FBI space with an

Inspection Division representative present.

On 7/8/75 Mr. Mark Gitenstein of the Select Committee Staff

reviewed the FBIHQ Inspection Manual in the presence of SA

Fred B. Griffith. Mr. Gitenstein was specifically advised these

Manuals are used solely as guidelines for the Inspection Staff and

are not binding on anyone but staff members. They cannot be used

to document any deficiencies noted during an inspection. He was told

such action would have to be based on applicable provisions in either

the Manual of Instructions or the Manual of Rules and Regulations.

TTG

During the review it was noted Mr. Gitenstein made notes regarding

the following Sections:

1. Section 2 (Recording the Inspection Findings), pages 5 and 6

which deal with the assembly and distribution of inspection reports and

work papers.

2. Section 4 (Specific Division Operations), pages 4 and 5 which are

concerned with surveys and audits.

3. Section 8 (Inspector's Summaries), pages 1, 2 and 4 which deal

as to when the aforementioned summaries would be completed. He was

informed it was the Bureau's understanding the Department would prepare

the summaries. Mr. Shaheen, after consulting with K. William O'Connor,

Special Counsel for Intelligence Coordination, stated it was the Department's

desire that the Bureau prepare the summaries. He advised the Departmental

At 11:40 a.m. on July 18, 1975, K. William O'Connor,

Special Counsel in the Deputy Attorney General's Office, telephonically

advised me that his negotiations with the Committee concerning more

restrictive limitations on Committee access to witnesses were not

successful. He said that the Department has determined that the

procedure in effect previously whereby the FBI Director would receive

a request for the availability of FBI personnel for interview and would

determine whether such personnel should be released from applicable

secrecy agreements would be reinstituted.

I asked Mr. O'Connor whether this meant that the Department

no longer regarded all requests for interview of present or former employees

as "demand" situations requiring the specific authorization of the Department

as if a subpoena had been issued. Mr. O'Connor said that the Department

would not consider such requests in that manner and that the FBI should

make all determinations necessary for the appearance of witnesses for

interview.

SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON

INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

ALLEGATION BY JOHN/EN MFF CONCERNING

INTERFERENCE WITH COMMITTEE INVESTIGATION

At 5:14 p.m., on 6/27/75, K. William O'Connor, Special

Counsel for Intelligence Coordination, advised me that he had received

a call from John Elliff of the Senate Select Committee complaining of

what he described as an attempt to interferewith the Committee's investi-

gation by supplying information to the press that the Committee had been

furnished material which it had declined to use or to inquire into because

of its sensitive nature. O'Connor said that Elliff claimed that a journalist

who is friendly with the Committee had advised the Committee that he had

information from a Justice Department official that the Committee had been

furnished information originating in the FBI that Communist funds were

used to finance Martin Luther King; that King had been related to the CP, USA,

and that the Senate Select Committee had treated this matter as a "hot potato"

and that the information also indicated that "King laughed all the way to the

bank."

O'Connor said that Elliff protested the apparent disclosures

by the Justice Department bo the press and claimed that it appeared an

effort was being made to interferewith the Committee's work. O'Connor

told Elliff he had no knowledge of anyone in the Justice Department furnishing

any such information to the press and further, he told him that he did not

believe that information concerning CP funding of King had been furnished

to the Committee.

ST-101

REC=18

62.116515-

O'Connor said that he did not believe that the fBi had furnished

such information to the news media but he wanted us to«be aware of Elliff's

complaint. O'Connor said that it is possible that during interviews conducted

by staff of the Committee, they have received statements indicating that

Communist funds were used by King, but he does not believe that any docu-

mentation of that has been furnished to the Committee as yet.

ADDENDUM

INTELLIGENCE DIVISION

SFP:lhb

7/2/75

INTD has received no report. or has any information

concerning the alleged leak referred to in this memorandum.

Concerning t= the allegation in this memorandum

that information originated with the FBI that communist

funds were used to finance Martin Luther King, Jr., and that

King had been "related" to the CPUSA, the following is noted.

We have never had any information that communist tunds,

literally, were used to finance King. We did have reliable

reports that King was helped in a financial way, particularly

as to advice regarding fund raising, by a close advisor,

Stanley David Levison, who was a secret member of the CPUSA.

However, none of our reports are known to have claimed that

"communist funds" were financing King. King was never known

to have been a member of the CPUSA. It is true that he had

a number of close associates such as Levison who at the time

were either current or past CPUSA members.

INID is unable to pinpoint the report that "King

laughed all the way to the bank."
