"Top Secret" memorandum dated 4/20/71, written by Louis W.

Pursuant to your instructions on the evening of }§=£9=———~~
7/24/75, I personally contacted Mr. Latimer at approximately
8:00 a.m., 7/25/75. In my conversation with Mr. Latimer, I

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall
Re: Senstudy 75
62-116395

He advised me he would have somebody from the General Counsel's

office, Department of Defense, promptly contact me regarding
a review of this file by FBI personnel.

Not hearing from Mr, Latimer by the late morning
of 7/25/75, I telephonically contacted his office. He was
not available and I asked his secretary to have him return
my call. Shortly before noon, Mr. Latimer returned my call
and explained that he had discussed my request with
Mr. "Marty" Hoffman (phonetic) of the Department of Defense.
It was Latimer's understanding that Mr. Hoffman had gone to
the White House to discuss my request with Mr. Philip Buchen,
Counsel to the President, Latimer promised that he would
telephonically recontact me as soon as he could establish
contact with Hoffman. TI again reiterated to Latimer that it
was imperative the Bureau have aceess to the Shamrock file
in order that we could advise the Attorney General as to
its contents hoping to clearly- demonstrate that both the
then Attorney General Thomas Clark and, in fact, President
Truman himself were aware of certain information contained
in the Shamrock file, Mr, Latimer said he understood clearly
what was at issue here and that he would get back to me as
soon as possible,

At 1:50 p.m., 7/25/75, I again called Mr, Latimer's
office and his secretary informed me that Mr. Latimer had
stepped out of his office and that she would give hima
message to call me as soon as he returned.’ As of 4:00 p.m.,
7/25/75, I had not received a return call from Mr. Latimer.

MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD

SUBJECT: SHAMROCK

. Buffham and I had an opportunity this morning to read
the eoeE file in ACSI. Major General Joe! McChristian gave
us permission to view it but once we had read itjafter careful con-
sideration he decided that he would not feel free to give NSA either
the file or a duplicate copy without personal permission from SecDef
inasmuch as SecDef had entrusted the file to ACSI in 1949. All of
us agreed that an approach to the Secretary would be unnecessary
and perhaps would generate too many questions. He did agree
after sealing the file again to limit access to the Secretary of Defense
on demand, the Director or the Deputy Director, NSA, on demand,
Chief of ACSI, and the Chief of the SSO, ACSI. This wmtd be meted

>». OJECT MOCKINGBIRD- @

Project Meekingbird, a telephone intercept activity, was conducted
between 12 March 1963 and.15 June 1963, and targeted two Washington-
i based’ newsmen who, at the-time, had been publishing news articles
based on, and frequently quoting, classified materials of this Agency
and others, including Top Secret and Special Intelligence.

Telephone intercept connections were installed at the newmen's
office and at each of their homes, for a total of 3, The connections
were established with the assistance of a telephone company official
‘who responded to a personal request by the Director of Security, Col.
Sheffield Edwards. Col. Edwards' authority for the activity was Mr.
John A. McCone, Director of Central Intelligence. The latter conducted
the activity in coordination with the Attorney General (Mr. Robert Kennedy),
the Secretary of Defense (Mr. Robert McNamara), and the Director of
the Defense Intelligence Agency (Gen, Joseph Carroll). In addition to
Office of Security personnel directly involved in the intercepts and
‘ research of materials acquired therefrom, only 3 other Agency
“officials are on record as witting of the activity: the Deputy Director
of Central Intelligence (General Marshall S. Carter), the Inspector
: General (Lyman Kirkpatrick) and the General Counsel. (Mr. Lawrence
: Houston). : :
| : :

The intercept activity was particularly productive in identifying con-
tacts of the newsmen, their method of operation and many of their sources
of information. For example, it was determined that during the period they
received data from 13 newsmen, 12 of whom were identified; 12 senators
and 6 members of Congress, all identified; 21 Congressional staff members,
of whom 11 were identified; 16 government employees, including a staff
member of the White House, members of the Vice President's office, an
Assistant Attorney General, and other well-placed individuals. A number
vof other sources were partially or tentatively identified, but the short span
_of the activity precluded positive identification, It was observed that through
these contacts the newsmen actually received more classified and official
data than they could use, and passed some of the stories to other newsmen
for release, establishing that many "leaks" appearing under other by-lines
were actually from the sources of the target newsmen.

Since the termination of Project Moekimevird, those materials related
to it which were retained, have been maintained under strict security access

of two Office of Security professjonals. Bye | an

SUBJECT: Soviet Defector

“A Soviet defector,
defected to a representative of this Agency in
-1964, The responsibility for

his exploitation was assigned to the then SR Division of
the Clandestine Service and he was brought to this country

After initial interrogation by
representatives of the SR Division, he was moved to a safe-
house in Maryland, - where he
was confined and interrogated until 13 August 1965 when
he was moved to a specially constructed "jail" in a remote
wooded area at ESOLATION. The SR Division was convinced
that he was a dispatched agent but even after a long
period of hostile interrogation was unable to prove their
contention and he was confined at FSOEATION in an cffort
to convince him to "confess."

.This Office together with the Office of General
Counsel became increasingly concerned with the illegality
of the Agency's position in handling a defector, under
these conditions for such a long period of time. Strong
representations were made to the Director (Mr. Helms)-by
this Office, the Office of General Counsel, and the
Legislative Liaison Counsel, and on 27 October 19¢*, the
responsibility for his further handling was transferred
to the Office of Security under the direction of the Députy
Director of Central Intelligence, then Admiral Rufus Taylor.

At the direction of the DCI, surveillance was con-
ducted of Jack Anderson and at various times his "leg
men,"' Britt Hume, Leslie Whitten, and Joseph Spear,
from 15 February to 12 April 1972. In addition to the
physical surveillance, an observation post was main-
tained in the Statler Hilton Hotel directly opposite
Anderson's office. The purpose of this surveillance
was to attempt to determine Anderson's sources for
highly classified Agency information appearing in his
syndicated columns.

At the direction of the DCI, a surveillance was
conducted on Victor L. Marchetti from 23 March to
20 April 1972. The purpose of this surveillance was
to determine his activities and contacts both with
Agency employees and other individuals in regard to
his proposed book and published magazine articles ex-
posing Agency operations.

POLICE SUPPORT

A. During 1969, 1970, and 1971, on several occasions,
the Intelligence Division of the Metropotitan. Police
Department was provided a communications system to
monitor major anti-Vietnam war demonstrations in the

‘Washingtom area. This system consisted of a radio

receiver-and an Agent at the Intelligence Diyision
Headquarters and several automobiles from an Agency
Field Office equipped with radio receivers and trans-
mitters and manned bytwo Agency employees, as wéll asia
representative of the Intelligence Division, Metropolitan.
Police Department. The benefit to the Agency was that
the communications over this system were monitored at
the Headquarters Building to provide instant notice of
possible actions by the dissidents against Agency in-
Stallations. :

“+ A. SRPOINTER-

- Since 1953, this office has operated a mail inter-
cept program of incoming and outgoing Russian mail
and, at various times, other selective mail at Kennedy
Airport in New York City. This operation included not-
only the photographing of envelopes but also surrepti-
tious opening and photographing of selected items of

: mail. The bulk of the take involved matters of inter-
nal security interest which was disseminated to the
Federal Bureau of Investigation. This program is now
in a dormant state pending a decision as to whether
the operation will be continued or abolished.

any unauthorized classified information in his
possession. :

D. BUREAU OF NARCOTICS AND DANGEROUS DRUGS

In’ January 1971, the Director approved a request
from the Director, Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous
Drugs, to provide covert recruitment and security
Clearance support to BNDD. This has been accomplished
through the medium of a proprietary of the Office of’
Security operating in

7 Falls Church, Virginia. Support
includes covert recruitment, investigation, polygraph,
medical clearance, and training. It has been divided
into three phases: (1) A CI operation to place indi-
viduals in BNDD field offices to monitor any illegal
activities of other BNDD employees; (2) Recruitment
of Chinese or Spanish speaking covert Agents; and (3)
Recruitment of an individual used as an Agent by BNDD
but actually employed by BNDD, although this fact is
known only to the Director and Chief Inspector, BNDD.
In this case, arrangements were made for all pay and
other employee benefits to come from CIA on a reim-.
bursable basis.

As a resul £ a reque from the Department of

the financing of the protection and the detail to the
Department of State of six armed Agents of this office
who are documented as State Department Office of Security
employees.

dissident groups in the Washington area considered

this period, the Office of Security field offices
were tasked with collecting available intelligence
on dissident groups. All such information was in-

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: General: Office of Security Survey

2
1. At the Director's instruction, and with the concurrence
of the then DD/P, the Office of Security developed informants in
_RID to report on the activities of RID employees on whom security
questions had arisen. This program, which included upwards of a
dozen informants at its peak, has declined to its present level of
three, only one of whom is reporting regularly on matters of current
interest,

2. The principal object of Security's interest through this
informant is a female who was employed in RID for a number of years
until she resigned in 1969. Her resignation coincided with the initiation
of a security review on her by the Office of Security, but Security does
not know whether the employee was aware of this security review at
the time of her resignation.

3. Security's interest in this employee was occasioned by
reports that she had developed an increasingly intimate acquaintance
with a Cuban national. Reporting by one informant, who was also
being developed by the Cuban, suggested that the Cuban might have
an intelligence interest in the female. The same informant also sub-
sequently reported that the Cuban had numerous other contacts among
clerical and secretarial employees of the Agency. Among these
employees is one girl who works in a biographic section in SB Division.

4. Subsequent to her departure from the Agency, the ex-RID
employee entered into a common-law marital relationship with the
Cuban and joined him as partner in a photographic business. In this
capacity she solicited business among CIA employees, especially
those requiring passport photos. Recently, she and the Cuban sought
to'employ Security's informant in this business on a part-time basis.

/NW-65360 Docld:32989624 Page 24 : : ean e



5. Information on the background of the Cuban is fairly extensive,
but it is inconclusive, e is known to have been a nyember of anti-
“Castro organizations J this country. There are alMMfreports that
his mother was imprisoned in Cuba at one time. Tiere are other -
episodes in his life that suggest intelligence involvement on his part
with some hostile service, but this is not yet definitely established.

“.6. The Office of Security has had at times a second informant
in this case. His reporting has tended to confirm reporting by the
principal informant. :

a
7. There is conclusive evidence that the Cuban expressed :
interest in certain 201] files in the Agency, and there are good grounds,
for believing that the RID female ernployee delivered at least one such
‘file to the Cuban while she was still in RID. There is also evidence
that the female employee in SB Division has continued in frequent
contact with her friend,. the ex-RID employee, and the Cuban. On
one occasion, she served as intermediary for contact instructions
from the Cuban to O/S's principal informant. The informant has no
knowledge, however, of any other requirements that may have been
levied on or satisfied by the SB employee. Neither does he know of
. the extent of contacts by this couple with other Agency employees
except social contacts.

8. The Office of Security has been running this operation for
over two years, in an effort to obtain conclusive proof of its intelli-.
gence nature. CI Staff has been kept informed. The FBI, which
was informed of the case at an early stage, has declined to take re-
sponsibility for it, on grounds that it concerns CIA's internal security.
As a result, the Office ofSecurity has been inhibited in the actions
it can take against the Cuban suspect. On the other hand, Security
has not taken any action against Agency employees for fear of com-
promising the operation.

93. tt would appear to me that the Office of Security has dallied
with this case long enough. Apparently unable through positive measures
to resolve doubts about the case, O/S has followed, the course of watch-
ful waiting, hoping the Cuban would take precipitant action himself that
would give us the evidence we seek. In the meantime, our knowledge
of the relationship between the Cuban and the several other current
Agency employees with whom he is known to have contact continues

NW 65360 Docid:32989624 Page 25.” 7 Cottman



to be quite limited. Neither the Cuban nor his girlfriend have made
any further approaches to Security's informant recegtly, although he |

- continues to see then@pcialty. Thus, there is sli }eason to believe
that further waiting will produce a break in the case.

10. There are two courses open to the Office of Security now.

It can attempt to have the Agency employees known to be in contact
with the Cuban transferred to nonsensitive positions. This might
alert the Cuban to our penetration of the operation, particularly

since a plausible reason for transfer would be difficult to develop

for some of the persons involved. Alternatively, Security could
move overtly and charge the Agency employees with violation of the
security regulation requiring reporting of contacts with foreign
nationals. This would, of course, terminate the Office of Security's
_ operation. icin

ll, One of these courses of action should be chosen promptly.
The possibility that the employee in SB Division may be passing i
information on is too great to warrant further
delay in movjhg against her. Moreover, it is possible that the Cuban
has curren productive penetrations of RID. Thus, the risk of damage
to the Agéncy seems clearly to outweigh any. possible gains from
_continying this CI effort.

MEMGRANCDUM FOR: Deputy Director for Management §& Services

SUBJECT - 2 .Press Allegations re Use of Agency
Polygraph. :

*1.° This memorandum is for your information only
and confirms a report I made to you by telephone earlier
today. 7

2. On 22 July 1971, an article was carried on
American preposals relative to the SALT talks in The New
York Times over the by-line of Iden 181. It was
devastatingly accurate and contained direct quotes from
a Presidential advisory memorandum the White House had
sent to Mr, Gerard Smith, Director, Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency, a few days earlier. The President
was alleged to be furious with this unauthorized dis-
closure of classified information and directed a sweeping
investigation within the United States Government to
determine the source of the disclosure. Investigation
was conducted uncer the direction of Mr. Egil Krogh and
Mr. David Young, Staff Assistants to Mr. John Ehrlichman,
Counsel to the President for Domestic Affairs.

‘3. On the basis of investigations conducted by
State Security and Defense officials, four individuals--

‘one individual in the Department of Defense and three
. individuals in the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency--

were tabbed as leading suspects. Mr. Egil Krogh contacted
me on 26 July 1971 and requested that we arrange to polygraph
the three suspects in the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency
and volunteered the information that the Federal Bureau of
Investigation would be asked to polygraph the one suspect

in the Department of Defense.



4 ine Abn to binheiciticcnadl Udi oUF

4, I informed Mr. Krogh that from time to time
in matters involving the national security the Agency had -
detailed to Mr. G. Marvin Gentile, Director of State
Security, a polygraph eperator and a polygraph machine for
his use in polygraphing State Department employees who
were recipients of allegaticns concerning their loyalty.
I emphasized that this procedure had the Director's
approval and that State clearly understood that the examin-
ation was their total responsibiZzity. I further informed
him that this was the only way we could undertake to enter-
tain his request and that even then it would require the
specific approval of the Director. Mr. Krogh asked me to
obtain such approval and work out such arrangements with
Mr. Gentile.

5. Later that same day, Mr. Krogh called Mr. Gentile

and inquired as to whether the arrangements had been made

Mr. Gentile indicated they had and suggested that the same
polygraph operator be used to examine the Defense suspect.
Mr. Krogh informed Mr. Gentile that he considered this an
excellent idea and that he would instruct Defense officials
to make their man available to Mr. Gentile for a polygraph
examination.

6. The four individuals were Iden 182
of the Department of Defense and Iden 183
* Iden 184 » and Iden 185 - of

the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. The polygraph

examinations resulted in clearing the four men and the
hee results of the examinations were forwarded over my signature
i to Mr. Gentile on 29 July 1971. A copy of my covering
| Memorandum is attached.

7. ° Iden 186 “ , a staff writer for The
’Washinston Post, in an article dated 3 September 1971,
Stated that a State Department spokesman had acknowledged
at a news briefing that agents of the Federal Bureau of
Investigation had polygraphed State Department employees
suspected of leaking information on the SALT talks in

July. Mr. John Edgar Hoover, then Director of the Federal

o0tc6sS

pe rr : «

- Bureau of Investigation, denied this allegation in a ‘

letter to The Washingten Post and said that the polygraph
examinations peén concucted by another agency. -Specu-

lation centerec around the Agency, but after a day or so,
press speculation in this regard died away.

8. Iden 186 apparently has never been satisfied
and has been pressing Mr. Charles Bray, State Department
spokesman, for confirmation of Agency involvement. Mr.

Bray learned today that Iden 186 plans to use a press

: conference to be held at 2:00 p.m. this afternoon to press
this point further. Mr. Bray has been given guidance by
Mr. Gentile to avoid confirmation but if this is impossible
he will indicate the examinations were conducted by State 7
Department Security officials utilizing an operator and
a machine detailed to the Department for this purpose. I :
do not know whether or not the fact that the government-wide
investigation was directed by Mr. Egil Krogh is known to

Iden 186 but I suspect that it is and that this is the

reason why the mattcr has been raised again. Mr. David
Young was instrumental in pushing my office to conduct an
internal Agency investigation of this disclosure and the
White House was satisfied that no Agency employee was
the source.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director for Management and Services

SUBJECT «Special Report

1. This memorandum is in response to a request to
provide information on situations or associations that
might appear to be irregular on the surface.

2. Details to the White House and Government Agencies -
“Background: For many years the Centrai intelligence Agency nas
etailed employees to the immediate office of the White House

per se and to components associated intimately with the immediate
office of the President such as the Council on International
Economic Policy and the President's Foreign Intelligence
Advisory Beard. We have furnished secretaries, clerical
employees and certain professional employees on a reimbursable
and non-reimbursable basis. At the present time, we have no
clericals or professionals assigned to the immediate White
House office, but we do have one young man detailed to their
Communications Section. There are detailees to PFIAB and CIEP.
I might point out that we had detailed to the White House as
late as the fall of 1970 couriers, telephone operators, a
laborer assigned to the grounds and a graphics man who designed
invitations for State dinners. By October of 1970, more funds
were apparently available to run the White House and most of
our detailees were hired as bona fide White House employees.
CIA is not the only Agency furnishing the White House with
@etailees. Levies have been made by this Administration and
others on Defense and State and other Government entities

whose employees have Top Secret clearances.

Professional officers have been and are at the present
time assigned t the National Security Council and we have seven
clericals on detail to NSC on a reimbursable basis.

In addition to the above, we have technical specialists

detailed to NSA, an instructor at the National War College and
security officers detailed to the Department of State to

* to the Secretary o he Treasury along wit hr other Agency

employees. We have even, in rare. instances, “detailed our

people to Congressional Staffs for short periods of time.

ite House and Government Agencies -

-3. Details to the W

Discussio Details to NSU, the ivhite House, NSA and the
National War College are probably quite ¢efensible. On the other

hand, there may be those who would question Agency employees
currently working at the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs
and Mr. Peter Petérson having an Agency employee as his
secretary when he was the Secretary of Commerce (she also made

a trip with him to Moscow). She is still with him in his
present assignment but we expect that she will report to NSC for
a new detail sometime this month. Iden 112 served for
over ten years as Director of the Office of Public Safety for
AID. This information has been kept “close to the vest" during
that entire period of time. He has been approved for disability
retirement and is presently on sick leave and will retire
automatically at the expiration of this leave.

Each detail of an Agency employee to the White House or
other Government agency has been carefully considered and
approval at a higher level obtained when professionals were
involved.

4. Project TWOFOLD: I believe the support we are
providing to Project TOFCLD is an activity that should be
reported under your guidelines. Since this is an extremely

sensitive Project and the Office of Security is reporting on
it, I will not repeat the details in my memorandum.

$. Individuals Engaged in Domestic Activities: In a more
_general sense, Contract Personnel Division prepares and executes
contracts with individuals engaged by the Agency to carry out
domestic activities. We also process Staff Agents who are
domestically assigned. None of these assignments are decided
in OP. I really have no way of knowing with any degree of
certainty what the specific duties of these individuals will be.

6. Arrangements with American Firms: In the interest of
reporting "too much," i would remind you that Contract Personnel
Division writes "agreements" with domestically based American
firms to provide cover for Agency assets. The actual assign-
ments are overseas. The arrangements, however, are backstopped,
in the main, in the United States.

7. Contractu@HRelationship - USJPRS: @: Agency
organization, USJPRE, has a contractual assocwation with
approximately 1,500 independent contractors and 45 contract
employees. These individuais are unwitting of the fact that
they really work for CIA in the performance of their domestic
activities. USJPRS (United States Joint Publications Research
Service) is a part of FBIS. They perform a translation service
of unclassifiec documents for the Government. The independent
contractors work in their own homes and are given assignments

as the need arises. The contract employees are "integrated"

into the Bureau of Standards and are located in Washington, D. C.
They are paid and administered by the Bureau. CIA reimburses
the Bureau. Their basic contracts of employment are prepared

in Contract Personnel Division.

"8. Hunt Requests a Lockpicker: This is.a record of
External Employment Assistance Sranch's action on a request
from Howard Hunt for a lockpicker who might be retiring or
resigning from the Agency.

Sometime in the spring of 1972, Iden 38 of EEAB
received a call from ficward Hunt who asked tden 38 1f he had a
retiree or resignee who was accomplished at picking locks.
Iden 38 sent him _ a resume on Thomas_Amato who retired
31 July 1971. Iden 38 did not document his EEAB record
to show the date of this exchange, but Mr. Thomas-Hester (who
also works in EEAB) opines that it occurred sometime between
March and Nay 1972.

All of the above information was reported to the Office
of Security on 4 October 1972 following the FBI's contact with
the Agency regarding Howard Hunt.

9. Resume Sent to McCord: Ross Lambert, a contract
employee who retired in September 1971, was a client of the
External Employment Assistance Branch in his search for a job
after retirement. One of the leads given to Lambert was
James McCord's security business. EEAB sent a resume to
McCord, but Lambert was not hired.

In mid-summer 1972, Mr. Lambert télephoned EEAB from”
Chicago. (He had a.job there with the Halifax Security Co.,
a lead provided by EEAB, but until this telephone call he had



not notified EEAB that he had the job and had moved from
the D.C. area.) Heggjaid he had been Mees 4 a Special
Agent of the FBI whWtold Lambert that his réWume had been
found among NcCord's papers. The. Agent wanted to know if
Lambert had any connection with McCord. Lambert explained
how the resume got to McCord. After the Agent left him,
Lambert telephoned EEAB. Mr. Kennedy of OP and Iden 29
OS were notified immediately. : : +

proprietary.

: b. Under Title 18, Chapter 2512 of. the U. S. Code
- (1968), the sale of electronic intelligence equipment is
prohibited except to Federal agencies, and state and local
jaw enforcement agencies. In essence, this law makes it
almost impossible to procure electronic intelligence
equipment in a covert manner so that no tie or relationship
to the United States Government is made. In order for the
Agency to covertly obtain such eauipment and hide any
Government interest, the Covert Procurement Staff cf the
Procurement Division. has relied on an established working
relationship withaU.sS. firm. . This firm, a prominent
supplier located in- Maryland, deals in a wide
range of law enforcement, police supplies, and equipment
The Covert Procurement Staff has. had a relationship withan officer
“\. in the firm for over 1S years. The officer agreed to
allow us to place orders through his corporation to major
suppliers of this equipment with a billing to a7 Agency national
proprietary.There is an understanding that. if any. .inauiry
is raised by the Department cf Justice, the firm's officer would
immediately call the Chief of the Covert Procurement Staff
who would, through appropriate liaison channels, contact
the Department of Justice, identify the.Agencv's interest
in the procurement action, and clear the officer of any
responsibility... On 10 September 1971, there was an inquiry
about the proprietary ~£ToR_an FBI agent making a routine
investigation of. the officer's books. Through Office of
Security liaison with the Department of Justice and the FBI,
+.the agent was informed that it is an Agency
notional proprietary. This disclosure closed the inquiry
and, since that time, there has been no further inquiry.
-Most of the DD/O area divisions from time to time submit
requisitions to us to acquire surveillance equipment. The
majority of the transactions are on behalf of the intelli-
gence service with whom liaison is conducted in various
foreign countries. By agreement between this Office and

the DD/O, we will not honor any requisition fer surveil-
lance equipment unless it has been approved ty the CI
Staff of the DD/O. : : i

4, Within the area of contractual responsibilities, the
following items are pertinent:

a. In February 1971, Colonel L. K. White, the then
Executive Dire¢tor-Comptroller, called me to attend a
meeting in his office, also attended by Mr. William Colby.
-Colonel White explained that the Technical Services
Division (TSD) had been requested to provide assistance
to the FBI for a sensitive project a7
. z aueee «» Colonel White did not dis-
sy Close the purpose of the assistance being provided by TSD
but did instruct me to assist TSD on purely contractual
7 matters. Since the Office of Logistics has no information

stantive questions concerning the subject should be
addressed tc TSD. Other procurement actions accomplished
: for the .FBI_are..revorted below. Specific mention is made,
however, of the Project because of the dollar magnitude, ap-
proximately $1 million, and the complex technical equip-
.ment that has been involved in the undertaking.

b. The Procurement Division, OL, currently has two
requisitions in hand from TSD which would involve reim-
bursable sales to the FBI. One such requisition in the
amount of $36,900 is for two Westinghouse television
cameras. The second requisition in the amount of $11,200
is for two wide-angle surveillance probes manufactured by
Bausch and Lomb. No action is being taken on either of
these requirements pending further instructions which
will be sought from the Deputy Director for Management
and Services. :

: ce. Over the years, this Agency has often supported
other Government agencies from a contractual or materiel
standpoint. Upon the submission of an officially approved

“request, supported by a transfer of funds, the Agency
would either enter into "accommodation procurements" for
the requesting agency or support the requesting agency by
the issuance of materiel from stock. Such actions are
legally accomplished under the Economy Act of 1925. This
Act authorizes one agency to support the needs of, or pro-
Vide a service for, another Government agency when such

action would be more economical and eliminate the need for
one agency of the Government to’ duplicate facilities
readily available from another. A typical example of this
procedure is purchasing photointerpretation gear for the
Defense Intelligence Agency element located at NPIC. In
connection with the current reporting requirement, however,
I have had our records researched for the past 2 years and
Attachment 1 reflects those transactions which appear to be

relevant to the subject of this memorandum.

d. In connection with the disclosures during the sum-
mer of 1971 that the Rand Corporation was not properly
safeguarding classified documents, this Office undertook
two acts. I directed the Securitwidéficer from our! West
Coast Procurement Office at the Iden 87 _

to visit the Rand Corporation and satisfy
himself that classified material furnished then by the
Agency was both properly safeguarded and accounted for.
His report was affirmative. On 23 August 1971, the senior
Security. Officer assigned to this Office forwarded a
letter to the Rand Corporation stressing and reaffirming
the procedures Rand must follow in safeguarding classified
information furnished them by the Agency. Of residual
interest in this matter, there is summarized the contents
of a memorandum of 2 July 1971 to the Executive Director-
Comptroller from the DD/I which is in our possession.

This memorandum reports that FBIS regularly
disseminated reports to the Rand Corporation
but that instructions had been issued to cease

- distribution of classified reports. While no
other direct dissemination went to Rand, other
USIB agencies, primarily USAF, were passing
"many" copies of DD/I products to Rand as au-
thorized under USIB regulations. The memoran-
dum also states that Rand personnel had ~
requested searches and document retrieval from
the CRS facility.

5. In connection with action taken for the Office of

Security, there are three relevant items:

N
. a. The Printing Services Division, OL, was requested
by ‘the Office of Security to print a book written by
Harry-Sv—Merphy, Office of Security. The book was pre-
pared by Hetty Rd a Brookings Institution Federal

"99443



N'

SUBJECT: Sensitive Activities Performed by the Office of
: Logistics i:

Executive Fellowship.-- The book is entitled "Where's

What -- Sources of Information for Federal Investigators."
It is a full treatise on the existence of sources of in-
formation that may be useful to an investigator. The
book's first printing of 360 copies was made in June 1967.
Due to demand, a second printing of 600 copies was made

in September 1968 e title page of the book gives
attribution to Me %, Office of Security, Central
Intelligence Agency, and the Brookings Institution Federal
Executive Fellowship. The book is classified Confidential,
and it is our understanding that the distribution was made
to appropriate agencies of the Federal Government. A copy
of Mr. Murphy's book can be made available for review if
desired. :

Sometime in 1972, a representative of the Law
Enforcement Assistance Administration (LEAA) requested
that the Agency give consideraticn to ovr publishing, at
LEAA expense, an unclassified version of this volume. It
was the “intent of LEAA to make broad-scale distribution
to Police Departments throughout the country. The Director
of Security and I consulted on this matter and jointly
determined that the LEAA request should not be honored be-
cause the Agency should not put itself in the position of
publishing law enforcement material for general and un-
classified purposes, and it would be an abuse of our print-
ing facilities.

b. On S January 1971, the Director of Security re-
quested that I approve his leasing up to eleven:motor
vehicles for use in connection with a special support
operation which would last approximately 3 months. The
Director of Security informed me, in his requesting memo-
randum of S$ January 1971, that "This support activity has
been undertaken at the specific instruction of the Director
‘and has his personal approval.” The request was approved,

c. From 1968 to date, the Office of Security has

‘ requisitioned from this Office a considerable amount of
materiel which we understand was to be given or loaned by
them to local Police Departments. In certain cases some
of this materiel was issued from Agency stocks and, in
other cases, direct procurement of the materiel was made
by funds furnished by the Office of Security. A complete
listing of such materiel is found in Attachment 2.

6. In connection with the responsibility held by this

Office to obtain, manage, and dispose of safe sites for all

Agency operating components , the following information is
relevant. :

a. A safe Site, identified as "Safehouse $62" which
is Iden 88 :
: ‘was made available to General Cushman's
office on 25 July 1971. 7
The subject safe site was acquired on 15 June 1970
as a replacement for a terminated OL standby safe site
and in keeping with the approved requirement for a com-
plement of five standby safehouses for all: Agency use.
The apartment has one bedroom and is located in an older
high-rise building along Iden 89. The nominal
lessee is Iden 90 a security-cleared
attorney with offices located at Iden 9l
7 - The cover story utilized is that
Iden 90,. > rents the apartment for business conferences,
meetings, and occasional overnight ‘stays by his staff
and/or his out-of-town clients. The original lease term
was for a l-year period, 15 June 1970 to 14 June 1971,
with month-to-month renewals thereafter. As an OL standby
safe site, the apartment has been used by various Agency
components to meet their short-term or crash requirements.
Control of the standby safe site and its security is the
responsibility of this Office. A record is maintained of
each user, component, and date of use; however, no record
is made of those persons being met at the site nor for what
purpose the site is being uSed (meetings, training, etc.).
Such information is maintained by the operating component
requesting the safe site. Records maintained by this
Office disclose only that the apartment involved was made
available to General Cushman's office on 23 July 1971 in
_ answer to a telephonic request.

b. This Office is aware, although it had no cognizance
nor responsibility, that an apartment was rented in Miami
Beach, Florida, during the period of the Democratic National
Convention, 10-14 July 1972, and the Republican National
Convention, 21-24 August 1972. The

that were being held. WH Division is the cognizant

n The above recitation of facts represents, to the best
of my knowledge and memory, those matters which appear to be
relevant to subject tasking given by the Director.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD :

SUBJECT: Summary, Special Programs Division (SPD),
. Office of Communications, Operational
Contacts with Other U.S. Government Agencies

s .

1. Prior to 1969 the OC COMINT intercept unit,
which was then in Miami, had relatively frequent contact
with the Miami bureaus of the FBI and FCC, Miami Police
and the Miami Beach Police. The staff provided support
to these activities in monitoring, identification and
DF of specific illegal agent transmissions conducted by
foreign nationals and American citizens in the greater
Miami area. Arrangements for this support were made
through the DDO's Chief, WH, Miami.

2. In late September 1972, NSA, through Division D/
DDO, requested that the Special Programs Division initiate
a hearability survey of certain HF long-distance commercial
telephone circuits between the U.S. and South America.
The circuits carried drug related long-distance calls of
interest to the BNDD and other U.S. agencies. Because of
the availability of personnel and technical capabilities,
the survey was conducted at the OC Relay Station at Iden 92.
Virginia, where the circuits could be satisfactorily inter-
cepted. On 15 January 19735, formal NSA tasking of the
intercept was instituted. On 30 January 19735, all coverage
was terminated by Division D because of possible legal
complications.

3. The Chief and Deputy Chief, SPD and SPD/Special
Electronic Operations Branch have been engaged in informal

technical liaison with operating components of the FBI

for a number of years. Initial contacts and arrangements
for support of specific activities have been made by the
Division D/DDO. Support has been providéd in the form of

1. This memorandum responds to the Director's request for
a report of any involvement in any cepucity since ] January 1969
with Messrs. Hunt, McCord, Liddy, Young, or Krogh.

1 - 2. Ihave had none with Hunt, Liddy or Young.

3. My McCord contact was indirect and occurred sometime
during the late 1960's when J was Directer, Office of Computer
! ao. Services. I epposed plans for Technical Division, Office of
‘ Security (under Mr. McCord) to acquire a separate computer for
Iden 101. Ted Hines of DN/S2T (then ORD)
was the computer individual working with TD and, I think, would
have details.

4. The Krogh centact also was indirect and involved his
request, first through OMB, that CIA fund foreign travel on behalf
of the Cubinet Co:nmittee on Internationa] Nareectics Control. Indi-
vidual phone-discussions are noted in the atteched. The Agency

“focal points were Iden 32 and Iden 3; f understand aa

Iden 3 has forwarded relevant documentation. Copies of
memoranda from Messrs. Krogh, Iden 3 and Colby are attached

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Conversation with Jack Bauman

' 1. While on leave visiting Disney World in Florida, I
dropped in to see Jack Bauman who lives in Winterhaven, Florida.
Jack retired from the Agency about five years ego on disability due

. to a serious heart condition. He was with the Office of Security for
about 20 years prior to his retirement.

peeeeeeS 2. During a private conversation Jack told me that he had
been interviewed three or four times by the FBI in connection with -
the McCord-Hunt affair. I asked him why he had been interviewed,
and he told me that in late 1971 he had béen contacted by Howard
Hunt who suggested that he consider an assignment as Security
Officer for the Republican Party. Jack visited Washington in
January 1972 to discuss the proposed position with Howard Hunt
who apparently was acting on behalf of the Republican Party. Jack |
furnished a resume to Hunt and discussed the position with him.
Ultimately, he decided not to accept the position because he felt
that his heart condition would not allow him to become involved in
such activity.

3, According to Jack, during the meeting with Mr. Hunt
they discussed some of the requirements of the job. At that time
they discussed a need for both a positive and a counteraudio program
and a need for a good security system both before and during the

he told Mr. Hunt that most of the people he knew were still in the
Agency, but he did furnish the name of! [EN-lus who might be
possibly ready to retire from the Agency. 7

5. Jack informed me that he assumed that the Bureau
* obtained his name due to the resume he furnished Mr. Hunt. He
said that the Bureau had talked to him on three or four occasions
and that he had written up about a 40 page statement concerning
his dealings with Mr. Hunt. When asked about Mr. McCord, Jack
said that he really did not know McCord that well and declined any
knowledge of Mr. McCord's technical capability.

with Mr. Hunt since the early part of 1972 and knew aothing of
the Watergate operation. He stated that he had gained the impres-
sion from the Bureau interview that the technical devices were being
removed at the time of the arrest and were not being installed as
originally reported. B peEEREEEEEE eee

7. ‘All of the above information was volunteered by Mr.
Bauman, and I really did not get involved in any discussion on the
matter other than to comment that I hated to see the Agency's name
connected with such an incident in any way. The above conversation
took place during a 10 or 15 minute period and no other discussion
relating to this incident was held. It is being reported for the record

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director for Management and Services

SUBJECT : + : Contacts with Individuals Named in the Watergate Matter

.

1, Iam addressing this to you instead of to the Director of Central
Intelligence since I doubt that the information contained herein is of such
significance to warrant his interest and because it has been on record with
the Agency since July 1972. However, if you feel that the information is of
such interest that it should be forwarded to the Director I shall put it in the
proper format to do so.

2. My only contact with anyone named in connection with the
Watergate and related matters was through Mr. Jack Bauman a former
Agency employee now retired and living in Winterhaven, Florida. In
December 1971 Mr. Bauman called me from Florida and advised that he
wanted to get in touch with Howard Hunt. He said that he did not have Hunt's
home phone number and that it was probably unlisted but that since Hunt was a4
former employee, could I contact Hunt and ask him to give Mr. Bauman a call.
Ihad only met Hunt once about 10 years before but | agreed to relay the message.
Icalled Howard Hunt at his home and told him that Mr. Bauman did not have his
home phone and requested he call Mr. Bauman. Mr. Hunt thanked me for
relaying the message and said that he would call Mr. Bauman. This seemed of
little consequence to me in December 1971 but in July 1972 Iden 17 of the
Office of Security contacted me in regard to the FBI investigation of the Watergate
Situation. At that time linformed Iden 17 ‘of the telephone call from
Mr. Bauman in December 1971. Attached is a copy of a Memorandum for the
Record prepared by Iden 17 as a result of our conversation.

. 3. In the summer of 1972 I took my family to Disney World in Florida
and took that occasion to drop in to see Jack Bauman. Mr. Bauman told me in
a private conversation that he had been interviewed three or four times by the
FBI in connection with the Watergate affair and he related to me his contact

with Howard Hunt. On 19 July 1972 after my return from Florida I reported
this conversation to the Director of Security and made it a Memorandum for

the Record. This memorandum was sent to Mr. Colby and a copy of the
memorandum is attached.

4, Other than knowing Mr. McCord through his employment with
the Agency and meeting Howard Hunt once in about 1959, I do not know nor
have I had any contdct with any individuals named or knowledge of related
matters now receiving attention in the press. :

1. OCI began following Caribbean black radicalism
in earnest in 1968. The emphasis of our analysis was on
black nationalism as a political force in the Caribbean
and as a threat to the security of the Caribbean states.
f@wo DDI memoranda were produced on the subject: "Black

' Radicalism in the Caribbean" (6 August 1969), and "Black
* Radicalism in the Caribbean--Anotnexr Look" (12 June 1970).
“In each a single paragraph was devoted to ties with the
US black power movement; the discussion primarily concerned
visits of Stokely Carmichael and other US black power
activists to the Caribbean and other overt contacts.

2. In June 1970, Archer Bush of OCI was asked to
write a momorandum with special attention to links be-
tween black radicalism in the Caribbean and advocates of
black power in the US. The record is not clear where
this request originated, but it came through channels
from the DCI. The paper was to be treated as especially
sensitive and was to include material provided by the
Special Operations group of the CI Staff. The CI Staff
material was voluminous but did not provide meaningful
evidence of important links between militant blacks in
the US and the Caribbean. This, in fact, was one of
the conclusions of the paper. The memorandum was produced
in typescript form and given to the DCI.

Activity Related to Domestic Events

In late spring of 1968 Walt Rostow, then : a

Special Assistant to the President for National Security
Affairs, tasked the DCI with undertaking a survey of
worldwide student dissidence. Confronted. by timult at

ce Columbia and mindful of the violence
accompanying student outbursts at Berlin's Free University
and clsevhere, Rostow sought to learn whether youthful
dissidence was interconnected: spaywned by the same causes;
financed and hence manipulated by forces or influences
hostil: to the interests of the US and its allies; or likely
to cone under inimical sway to the detriment of US interests.

The paper waS prepared by Paul Corscadden of OCI

fuaeett with the assistance of the CA and CI Staffs. ‘he DDI,
D/ocI, and Corscadden met with Rostow to elicit the reasons
for his or the President's concerns and to agree on the
sources to be examined, the research methods to be followed,

Written during the summer of 1968, the most

sensitive version of Restless Youth comprised

its motivation, histor, and tactics. This section drew
heavily on overt literature and FBI reporting on Students
for a Democratic Society and affiliated groups. In a sense,
the survey of dissent emerged from a shorter (30 page)

SUBJECT _’ t Activity Related to Domestic Events

1. In late 1967 OCI participated in the preparation
of several short intelligence memoranda dealing with the
foreign connections of US organizations and activists in-
volved in the anti-war movement. The main purpose of
these reports, prepared at the request of the Wnite House,
was to determine whether any links existed between inter-
national Communist elements or foreign governments and the
American peace movement. ‘The conclusion reached was that
there was some evidence of ad hoc contacts between. anti-~
war activists at home and abroad but no evidence of
@irection or formal coordination.

2. In October 1967 President Johnson expressed
interest in this subject and ordered a high level inter-
departmental survey. In response to his personal request
to the DCI, Mr. Helms asked the CI Staff to collect what-
ever information was available through our own sources and
through liaison with the FBI and to pass it to OCI, which
was directed to prepare a memorandum from the DCI to the
President.

3. A book message requirement was sent to all stations
to report whatever information was on hand relevant to this
subject. * Although agent reports on Communist front opera-
tions overseas were of some value, the primary source of
information on the activities of US activists--and that was
quite limited--was sensitive intercepts produced by NSA,
which had been similarly tasked by the White House.

SUBJECT: Involvement In Domestic Affairs

4, The CIA Library has several informal
snag files intended to aid the librarians in
answering the kinds of questions that they know
they will get on a continuing basis. An
appointnents file is a colle.tion of clippings
on appointed federal officials: who holés what
job when and what is his background? The extremist
files are a collection of folders on a variety
of organizations and a few people with intricate
Organizational links. Any sort of extremism
is grist for these particular files. Anda few
persons, e.g., Rap Brown and Eldridge Cleaver,
have Gossiers consisting almost exclusively of
clippings from public media. These files are
unclassified and consist mostly of clippings
from the public press: U.S., foreign, u tnderground,
scholarly.

involvement in domestic activities that is not
related to development of techniaues or logistics
or legitimate training of CRS personnel.

SUBJECT :’ Sensitive Activities

1. FBIS has been engaged in no activities related to the ‘Elisberg
and Watergate cases. * eee

2. FBIS operations occasionally extend to the domestic arena. From
time to time, FBIS linguists are made available to DDO or Office of
Conmunications componeats for special operations (usually abroad) involving
close-support SIGINT work or translation of audio take. ‘On one occasion
recently DDO, on behalf of the FBI, requested the services of several
FBIS linguists skilled in Arabic to work directly for the FBI on a short- a
term project here in Washington. The arrangements were made by Mr. Oberg Re ‘
of the DDO CI Staff. He said the project was very highly classified and oan
that FBIS participation was approved by Nr. Colby and the Director. FBIS
participation was.approved by the Director of FBIS after a check with
the ADDI. Other examples of sensitive linguistic support work are help
in the handling and resettlement of defectors, the recent assignment of
an employee to the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs to transcribe
recordings in a rare Chinese dialect, and the detailing cf another
Chinese linguist on two occasions to assist in the U.S. military training
of Chinese Nationalist cadets.

3. Within its responsibility for monitoring press agency trans-
missions for intelligence information, FBIS publishes and distributes
some material which'falls in a "gray" area of copyright protection, libel,
and privacy of international communications. Press services controlled
by national governments and transmitted by radioteletype without
specific addressees, e.g. the Soviet TASS service and the PRC's HCNA,
are monitored by FRIS and the material is disseminated without restric-
tion. The legality of this _has been affirmed by decisions of the
Office of General Counsel.

4, The routine FBIS monitoring of foreign radio broadcasts often

involves statements or speeches made by U.S. citizens using those radio
facilities. Examples are statements made or allegedly made by American
POW's in Hanoi, by Jane Fonda in Henoi and by Ramsey Clark in Vietnan.

At the request of FBI and the Deparrment of Justice, and with the
approval of the CIA Office of General Counsel, we have on occasion sub-
mitted transcripts of such broadcasts to the Department of Justice as
part of that Department's consideration of a possible trial. In such
cases, ve have been required to sub: names of FBIS monitors involved,
presumably because of the possibility they might be required as witnesses.
(In one case in 1971, an FBIS staff omployee was directed to appear as

_ an expert witness in the court-martial of a Marine enlisted man charged
‘with aiding the enemy in a broadcast from Hanoi.) FBIS views al] this
with misgivings. Monitoring of such broadcasts is incidental and we

rue attribution of their news to FBIS, and we should not be considered
policemen maintaining surveillance of traveling Americans.

5. FBIS is an overt organization, but one aspect of its operations
is under Department of Commerce cover. The Joint Publications Rasearch
Service (JPRS) was established in 1957 to provide the means through which
great volumes of material from unclassified foreign publications could
be translated by large numbers of independent contractors in the United
States on a piece rate basis. Contractors are not witting of their CIA
employment.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director for Science & Technology

SUBJECT .- : TSD Support to Other Agencies

1. Technical Services Division's charter (CSI 1-8) requires
that it provide technical assistance to both CIA operations and
other activities as may be dir ected by the Deputy Dine ctor for
Operations.

2. Over the years the chief non-CIA recipients of this
support have been the Department of Defense, the Federal
Bureau of Investigation, Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous
Drugs, Immigration and Naturalization Service, Department
of State, United States Postal Service, Secret Service, Agency
for International Devclopment, and the White House.

3. While varying widely among the different recipients, these
services have included training and materials, and in a few in-
stances participation in the fields of audio and visual surveillance,
secret writing and related communications, personal protection,

; disguise,
concealment devices, electronic beaconry, illicit narcotics detec-
tion, and counter~sabotage/terrorism.

4, Inmost instances requirements for this support are
received by TSD through higher echelons (Office of the Director
or Deputy Director for Operations). Unless the service involved
is a trivial or continuing one, the request is referred to the
Foreign Intelligence Staff Departmental Coordination Group for
coordination and approval at the appropriate Agency levels.
Approval within TSD by the Chief of Operations or Development
and Engineering and the Chief of TSD or his Deputy also is re~
quired.

5. The attachment lists the primary services provided to
the organizations named in Paragraph two.

This information deleted because it reveals sensitive operational

techniques and methods,

8. Provision of forged documentation to non-DDO requesters,
whether they be CIA or other Agency requesters, always‘requires
approval of non-TSD offices. Support to the military for instance
would be validated by FI Staff/Departmental Coordination Group

t Headquarters or by the COS overseas having responsibility for
coordination of the operation. BNDD requests are coordinated
with DDO/NARCOG. Requests for documentation of Immigration
and Naturalization Service is coordinated via the Alien Affairs
Staff.

9. Authentication items are issued of a loan basis and must
be returned to TSD or accounted for. After any documentation has
been issued, TSD retains photographs and records of such support
until the documentation has been returned to TSD, If the material
is not returned after a reasonable time, the requester is reminded
of the outstanding documentation.

' FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

TSD has had a close working relationship with the FBI over
the past few years. The FBI is the only organization that has |
been fully briefed on TSD audio techniques and equipment. The
following are situations where TSD equipment and guidance were
involved in operations: :

(A) Identity 59 ~ Four masked transmitters were
installed. Two have failed and two remain workable.

(B) Identity 60 | - A TSD built masked transmitter
_ was-installed to collect emanations from a crypto-
_ graphic machine. The system continues to function
when samples of the emanations are needed.

(C) Identity 61 ~- Two transmitters have been
installed and are operating. One is specifically
designed to collect the sounds of typewriting, the
other is a straight audio transmitter to collect con-
versations. A FBI agent is manning the listening
post. A third system is not oper-
ating, probably due to battery expiration. The tape
made from this room was made’by the Nationa
Security Agency before failure. : 7

(D) Identity 62 - TSD furnished equipment and con-

sultation covering Identity 62
First masked switched trans-

mitters were used in two apartments used as tempor~°
“ary quarters. Later masked switched transmitters
and microwave transmitters were installed in the
permanent quarters along with mic and wire installa-
tions, entirely furnished by the Bureau. This install- .
ation is not fully operational because the full comple-
ment of personnel have not yet arrived.

00n22



eee SOEOTTE ts

(EL saws - This is an operation ee
participation by National Security Agency. It is
designed in anticipation of the Identity 64

. in Washington. The listening post was
obtained by using the Agency covert mechanisms
for procuring the property. New systems are
being designed and produced by using TSD's covert
contractor mechanisms and TSD engineers.

(F) Identity 65 - Ten masked audio devices pur-
chased from TSD were installed in Identity 65

by the FBI. Part of the equipment was install-
ed in November and December 1971, the remaining
equipment was installed 17 - 25 March 1972. Tests
made by a TSD officer from a temporary FBI
listening post on 8 - 9 November 1972, proved that
the target equipment no longer functioned and was
_ believed discovered by the occupants,

(G) TSD has furnished equipment items which constitute
an on-thé-shelf capability to engage in photo and
audio surveillance operations which might not be
known to the Agency. In one case it is known that a
relatively unsophisticated device was used against
a domestic target. :

7 "* @SD/SDB_ Memo $138-73

8 May 1973
MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, TSD
ATTENTION: Executive Officer
SUBJECT: Contacts with Domestic Police Organizations

1. In December 1968, July 1969 and December 1970, SDB
provided basic countersabotage familiarization training for
selected members of the Washington metropolitan area police

f departments. The training was given at the Fairfax County
police pistol and rifle range. Authorization for the train-
ing came from DDP and Chief, Office of Security.

2. On occasion during the past few years, under the
auspices of the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration of
the Department of Justice and with the approval of CI Staff
and Office of Security, SDB provided training and familiari-
zation to police officers of several domestic police
departments in the uses of the Explosives Residue Detection
Technique and Trace Hetals Detection Technique. These tech-
niques had been declassified and are currently available to

e law enforcement community. The National Bomb Data Center
publishes periodic guidance in their uses.

3. In order to augment the SDB mission responsibilities
in.the field of countersabotage and counterterror, SDB offi-
cers have in the past two years visited, under appropriate
covers, the explosives disposal units of the New York City
police department, Dade County (Hiami) Florida Dept. and the
Los Angeles Police Dept. Also, in March 1973, two SDB offi-
cers attended the Explosives and Ordnance Disposal Conference
in Sacramento, California, sponsored by LEAA. When the
recent letter bomb menace began in September 1972, our liaison
with the NYCPD bomb squad paid off in that we had complete in-
formation on letter bomb construction in hours, enabling the: V
Agency to make worldwide dissemination within a day.

i DOMESTIC TESTS FOR
AGENCY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS

1.°.As a normal part of ORD's efforts in the
research and development of equipment and techniques
for Agency applications in foreign intelligence, we
conduct experiments and tests in the United States.
Clearly,.the design and development of our intelli-
gence equipments can be done more economically and
more securely in this country. Although most of
the tests of our RGD equipments are performed in
closed laboratories or in secure areas simulating
the foreign environment, some of the tests and experi-
ments, of necessity, reveal domestic information.

2. A review of the surveillance equipment or
techniques which have at some time or other been
exposed to domestic testing is as follows:

a. Laser Probe - About 1967, the laser
probe developed by ORD was tested by TSD in
San Francisco under very closely controlled
conditions. The ORD Project Officer witnessed
portions of the test. Recordings that were
made of laser probe output were carefully
controlled as classified material and it is
believed tha, h s have long since been
destroyed.

My total contact with other agencies in terms of assistance
with domestic operations has’been in the field of audio sur-
veillance countermeasures, anti-hijacking, or drugs. Speci-
fically, I participated in TSCC and RED Subcommittee meetings
which included technology exchanges and some equipment ex-
changes on a temporary basis ostensibly for testing or trial.

“I also assisted in x-raying the office walls of the Chairman

. of the AEC (then Mr. Schlesinger) at the request of Mr. Richard
Cowan of AEC Security. The operation occurred one evening

MEMORANDUM FOR: Executive Secretary, CIA Management
: Committee

SUBJECT : Reported . Identity 61 _ Burglary

1. Attached is a report summarizing what we know about the
reported break-in of Identity 61. An investigative report
by an officer of the Executive Protective Service states that the
offices were ransacked and a number of personal items stolen.

2. The attached summary also describes a separate audio
operation conducted against Identity 61 . by the FBI, at the
Agency's behest and with its technical support. This presents a
related question that should be noted. James McCord's’ testimony
indicates that he placed telephone calls to the Identity 75 and Identity

61. - He says he picked the numbers at random, hoping

that if his phone was tapped his attorneys would be able to challenge
the evidence as being tainted. Another witness, John Caulfield,
says McCord called the two named Iden 75 and Iden 61 because he ''was sure"
they ''were subjects of national security wiretaps." 7

3. In fact, there has been a long-standing telephone tap on the
Identity 75 » run by the FBI, about which CI Staff believes McCord
knew. It is possible that he also had an inkling of some sort of operation
agdéinst Identity 61 *, and assumed that it was also a telephone
tap. One must speculate that he played for double insurance, hoping
that both his telephones and those of the Iden 75 and Iden 61 were tapped, and
that one way or another his case would be dismissed or dropped
because of tainted evidence or to avoid revealing the sensitive
operations. At this point, given the publicity of the Iden 61 break-in,
and the testimony of McCord and Caulfield, the current investigations
may lead to exposure of the operations. :

- 24 May 1973
MEMORANDUM FOR: Inspector General
SUBJECT : Reported Burglary of the Identity 61 -
1. The press reported a burglary of Identity 61 _ 13-14

May 1973. An investigative report by an officer of the Executive
Protective Service states that the offices were ransacked anda
number of personal items were stolen. There were some latent
fingerprints, but no identification was made. The FBI, which states
that the incident was on 15 May, did not investigate because it deter-
mined that it did not have jurisdiction, The Identity 61

registered a formal complaint and American regrets were expressed,
Identity 61 making it clear that they suspected something other than
ordinary robbery. We have no additional information on the subject.
There had been an carlicr intelligence operation against the Identity 61
which is déscribed below.

2. On 16 April 1971 the Agency-proposed to the FBI the instal-
lation of technical coverage of Identity 61 The opportunity
for such an installation came about when a domestic assel of Foreign
Resources Division reported that he had been asked to submit a bid
for a contract to renovate Identity 61 Upon securing the
contract the asset was willing to augment his work force as appropriate
or install material which would be provided him, The Agency proposed
to turn this asset over to the FBI and to provide technical and logistic
support. The value of such an operation to the intelligence community
was cited.

3. On 23 April 1971 FBI Director John Edgar Hoover turned
down the Agency proposal. That same day CIA Director Richard Helms
sent a letter to Attorney-General John Mitchell requesting that the FBI
turndown be reversed, citing the importance of the Iden 61 target and
national intelligence needs to collect positive intelligence. On 24 April
the Attorney-General reversed the FBI decision and the Washington
Field Office of the Bureau was instructed to proceed with the operation.

O0aSz .

i 4. During Ce from 26 April to 18 May all the
technical equipment from the Agency .to the FBI was delivered,
installed and tested. Everything seemed to be working. No Agency
personnel were involved:-in any way with actual installation of
equipment in Identity 61 From May to February Agency tech-
nicians helped calibrate, reset and do other repair work on occasions
of equipment failure in the FBI listening post. Onno occasion did
they enter Identity 61, :

5. The Agency requested that coverage of Identity 61 - be
stopped on 3 February 1972 after FBI Director J, Edgar Hoover
advised that he was scheduled shortly to testify in Congress and
might have to advise them that the installation in Identity 61°
was initiated at CIA's request. The operation and equipment, to the
best of the Agency's knowledge, was dormant until 8 December 1972
when the FBI was asked by the Agency to reactivate coverage. The
request at this time was occasioned by the knowledge that a Iden 76
delegation would be arriving in Washington for discussions on
nationalization of foreign holdings, While the FBI was still
in the process of reactivating the equipment, the Department of
State on 20 December 1972 requested the FBI to institute all possible

coverage of Identity 61 and on 22 December 1972 coverage
was partially reinstitutéd with full coverage in effect by 26 December
1972.

6. A review of the take from the operation, weighed against
the risks involved, led the Agency to conclude that the activity was
not worth continuing. On 16 February 1973 CIA requested the FBI
to discontinue the coverage. On 22 February 1973 the FBI advised
that microphone surveillance of Iden 61 was discontinued,

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD ae

SUBJECT: Identity 61 Break In on 15 May 1972

1, On 24 May 1973 I tclephoned Mr. James Robinson,

General Crime Section, Department of Justice and asked if he

had any information as to criminal prosecution of persons involved
“ina breakin at Identity 61 -in Washington, D.C. on

15 May 1972. Mr. Robinson stated he had no knowledge of this but

suggested that it would be better to check with Mr. G, Marvin Gentile,

Deputy Assistant Secretary for Security, Departnent of State, and

the Secret Service since they had responsibilities for the Executive

Protective Service (EPS), I telephoned Mr. Gentile and he identi-

fied two State Department cables relative to the incident; one from

the embassy in Santiago to the Department, No. 2450, dated

15 May 1972, Subject: Unauthorized Entry Outlining the Protest

of the Iden 76 Government presented to the American Embassy,

and the State Department reply to Santiago, No. 084655, dated

15 May 1972. Mr. Gentile also identified the EPS report of

investigation and suggested that I get a copy from the Secret Service.

I then called Mr. Tom Kelly at Secret Service and he had his liaison

man deliver me a copy of the EPS report of investigation.

7 2. On25 May 1973 I received a call from FBI Agent

Ray Mullens on green phone No. 5303 stating that he had received

a telephone call from Mr. James Robinson relative to my inquiry

about prosecution. Mr. Mullens indicated that the FBI Washington
Field Office had recontacted the Metropolitan Police Departmert (MPD)
on 24 May and reviewed the report No. 248-424 filed with the 3rd
District, MPD which states that a break in occurred at Identity 61

between 5:00 and 8:00 a.m. on 15 May 1972.

some latent fingerprints but no identification of those prints
was made. Since the reported loss was under $5,000 and there
was.no evidence of a crossing of state boundries, the FBI did
not make an investigation of the incident. The MPD reported

1. June 1973

i MEMORANDUM FOR: Mr. William E. Colby

SUBJECT: Special Activities

1. Following our recent conversation, I have
searched my memory and Mr. McCone's files for examples
of activities which to hostile observers or to someone
without complete knowledge and with a special kind of
motivation could be interpreted as examples of activities
exceeding CIA's charter.

2. First, as we discussed, on 7 March 1962,
DCI McCone, under pressure from Attorney General Robert
F. Kennedy, agreed to tap the telephones of columnis
Robert S. Allen and Paul Scott in an effort to identify
their sources for classified information which was appear -
ing in their columns. Because the primary source appeared
to be in the Department of Defense, McCone ordered me
personally to brief General Joe Carroll, Director of DIA,
orally, which I did. I understand more complete information
on this operation is available from the Director of Security.
I, personally, managed to avoid gaining any knowledge of
what precise actions were taken, what information was gaincd,
what was done with it, and when the operation was terminated.

3. As a result of a developing relationship with
IDEN-122 thelDEN-123representative in Washington,
and also as a result of certain information conveyed by
v IDEN-124 » James Angleton, with the approval of
Dick Helms, agreed to mount a counterespionage operation
against the IDEN-95 in Washington. This involved
breaking and entering and the removal of documents from

rura pe
Ring Gi

NW 65360 Docld:32989624 Page 123



the’ IDEN-126 | On 18 June 1962, DCI McCone and
Helms briefed Secretary of State Rusk generally.on the
operation without going into operational details. Later
on the same day, President John F. Kennedy was briefed.
Actual breaking and entering occurred. somewhat later, and
on 15 April 1963, DCI McCone met with President Kennedy
alone and briefed the President on the details of this
new phase of the operation. On the same day, the Attorney
General was briefed and he agreed that he would not
mention it to the FBI unless the FBI themselves raised

it with him. On 3 February 1964, DCI McCone met alone
with President Lyndon B. Johnson and briefed him on the
operation. On 4 February McGeorge Bundy was briefed.

On 6 February 1964 in a briefing of Secrefary of State
Rusk on the results of the operation, Rusk expressed
reservations about: the propriety of such an operation.

He raised this same concern in subsequent conversations
with McCone on 17 April 1964, 28 May 1964, and 14 June
1964. On 12 September 1964 Rusk continued to express
grave reservations and repeatedly suggested that the
IDEN-95 be iniormed directly that we knew about their
espionage operations in the United States and ask them

to desist. In a meeting on 28 May 1964 Rusk expressed
these reservations in the presence of DCI MeCone and
President Jonn F.. Kennedy.- Secretary of Defense McNamara
was also present, and there is no record that he had
previously been made aware of this operation.

’ 4. Although certain activities never got beyond
‘the planning stage, there are, I believe, three examples
of. such planning which could be subject to misinterpretation.
One involved chemical warfare operations against the rice
“erops in both Cuba and North Vietnam. A second involved
a paramilitary strike against the Chi-Com nuclear instal-
lations. Outside the United States Government, General
“Eisenhower was briefed on such planning. A third, which
assumes a new significance today, involved a proposal by
Angleton and Helms for a greatly increased intelligence
collection effort against foreign installations in this
country. This planning also involved a scheme for selected

Tig bsseal ce



exposure of KGB activities and counteractions against the
Soviet intelligence service. The reasons are still unclear
to me as to why the FBI chose to brief the PFIAB to the
effect that CIA was planning to wiretap extensively and
indiscriminately in this countr Eo. great i nerease

| the Agency representation[ —ureacsimi@ jana
generally to use KGB-type CROTICS, also Cxtensively and

| indiscriminately. This led to a heated exchange between
DCI McCone and Mr. Belmont of the FBI, one such meeting
taking place in the presence of the Attorney General.
It is clear that the TBI was opposed to any such proposal
then, as now, and the plan never went forward.

5. During the period when Des FitzGerald was in
charge of the Cuban Task Force, DCI McCone's office
learned, quite by accident, that FitzGerald had secured
the cooperation of several prominent US business firms
in denying economic items to Cuba. There was no question’
but that the businessmen were glad to cooperate, but know-
ledge of this operation had to be rather widespread.

6. On 17 April 1964, Mr. Robert B. Anderson came
to DCI MeCone on behalf of American business interests,
offering to insert some $300,000 to try to secure a
favorable result in the elections in Panama. Shortly
after this approach, IDEN-128 of IDEN-129

made a Similar proposal to McCone in connection
with elections “in Chile. On 12 May 1964 at a meeting of
the 303 Comittee, it was decided that the offers of
American business could not be accepted, it being neither
a secure way nor an honorable way of doing such business.
This declaration of policy at this time bears on the recent
ITT hearings, but I am not surprised that McCone has
‘forgotten thathe helped to set the precedent of refusing
to accept such collaboration between the > Agency’ s operations
and private business.

7. At the direction of Attorney General Robert
_ Kennedy and with the explicit approval of President Kennedy,
/ McCone injected the Agency, and particularly IDEN-36

00459



S76

into the US labor situation, and particularly to try
to ameliorate the quarrel between George Meany-and
Walter Reuther. [)EN-36 steered a very skillful
course in this connection, but the Agency could be.
vulnerable to charges that we went behind Meany'’s back,
or were somehow consorting with Reuther against Meany's
wishes.

8. There are three examples of using Agency
funds which I know to be controversial. One was the
expenditure of money under Project MOSES in securing
the release of Cuban Brigade prisoners. Details of
this operation are best known to Larry Houston, Mike
Miskovsky IDEN-131 » and James Smith. Second,
as you well know, when Lou Concin received his summons
to report to the Joint General Staff Headquarters on
1 November 1963 a large amount of cash went with hin.
My impression is that the accounting for this and its
use has never been very frank or complete. Third, at
one of the carly Special Group meetings attended by
McCone he took rong exception to proposals to spend
Agency funds to improve the economic viability of West
Berlin, and for an investment program in Mali. His
general position was that such expenditures were not
within the Agency's charter, and that he would allow
such spending-only on the direct personal request of
the Secretary of State or the Secretary of Defense, or
the White House.

9. I raise these issues of funding because I
remember the Agency's being severely criticized by the

House Appropriations Subcowmittee for having spent $3,000

for stamps in connection with a program to buy tractors
to secure the release of prisoners from Cuba.

10. Under the heading ‘of old business, I know that
any one who has worked in the Director's office has worried

about the fact that conversations within the offices and
over the telephones were transcribed. During McCone's

@

tenure, there were microphones in his regular office,

his inner office, his dining room, his office in East
Building, and his study at his residence on White Haven
Street. I do not know who would be willing to raise such
an issue, but knowledge of such operations tends to
spread, and certainly the Agency is vulnerable on this
score. : FK Act § (g)(2)(D)

11. Also under the heading of old business,
11 remember the hue and cry raised, especially by Carl
i aac ~ eal

we

hortly after the Cuban missile crisis, there was
a disposition in Washington to reexamine the Bay of Pigs,
and the fact that several Alabama National Air Guard
officers lost their lives in the Bay of Pigs was surfaced
with surprisingly little excitement at the time.

12. During my stint on the 7th floor there was
a special arrangement with the Office of Communications
whereby the Director's office gained access to non-CIA
traffic. This surfaced briefly at one point shortly after
Admiral Rayborn became DCI. He had visited the Signal
Center and removed a copy of a telegram from the Embassy
in the Dominican Republic for Under Secretary George Ball,
Byes Only. Wie returned to his office and proeceded to
discuss this telegram with George Ball who was naturally
quite curious as to how Rayborn knew about it, and also as

Ben Read in the Secretary of Stace's office and I spent
several weeks putting this one to rest.

13. Finally, DCI McCone, as you and I well know,
operated on a very lofty plane, and I think certain of
his activities could be misunderstood: One example was.
his decision in July of 1964 to have Aristotle Onassis and
Maria Callas flown from Rome to. Athens on Air Force KC 135.
Their arrival in Athens in this airplane attracted the
attention of the local press and in due course Mr. John

Hightower, Chief of the Associated Press Bureau for
Washington, came to see me to ask about the propriety
of this action.

14. ° The use of IDEN~-132 aircrait
has been remarkably secure, but DCI McCone himself
forgot about the cover arrangement and became quite
exercised when he saw Candidate Goldwater land in the
San Francisco airport for the Republican National Con-
vention in 1964 aboard the IDEN-133 with
the -highly visible tail nunber jp 134, This was, I
explained to him carefully, a perfectly legitimate
charter, but he didn't like it.

15. McCone dealt quite extensively with newsmen
in Washington. In fact, they gave hima gift anda
luncheon when he leit Washington, which is perhaps
indicative of the press's relations with him. However,
in the case of the Ross and Wise book, The Invisible
Government, he did try to bring pressure on the publisher
and the authors to change things They did not change
a comma, and I doubt that this old saw willever sing
again.

. 16. Finally, and this will reflect my Middle
Western Protestant upbringing, McCone's dealings with
the Vatican, including Pope John X XIII and Pope Paul

Vi, would and could raise eyebrows in certain quarters.

17. The above listing is uneven, but I have a
sinking feeling that discipline has broken down, and that
allegations from any quarter which cast these things in

- the wrong light would receive great publicity and attention,
and no amount of denial would ever set the record straight.
If I may be of any assistance in tracking down further

‘details, I am‘of course at your disposal, but I would point

out that I was very much in the position of the
enlisted man who knew that the commissioned officers
were aware of these activities and better able to
judge their propriety and possible impact or misinter-
pretation.

SUBJECT: PLMPLODESTAR

Project MPLODESTAR is a Headquarters initiated program
which has as its fundamental objective the long term manipu-
lations of selected agent assets operating against EA Division
difficult targets in the leftist and communist milieu in various
parts of the world. Although targetted overseas these: agents are
often exposed to and directed against American radical, leftist,
and communist targets to gain a practical knowledge of the leftwing,
radical, communist world. There is a possibility that an asset
“night become suspect and be accused of being an employee of the
Agency or the Bureau; or it might happen some asset would, for
some reason, become disenchanted with his role and expose his
Agency relationship and his activities, with resultant embar-
rassment. To minimize potential problems, therefore, each
case is cleared with the FBI and through CI/SO the Bureau is

kept.informed on a regular basis.

CORPORATE COVER

JFK Act 5 (g) (2) (D)

2. Currently, there are 191 integrees for whom cover
is provided by 140 companies; 179 integrees are located in
47 forcign countrics and 12 are located in the United States.
To maintain this placement level, GCS personnel are re-
searching and monitoring approximately 250 to 300 companies |
at any given time,

3. To minimize the adverse consequences to a cooperating
company, and to preserve the Agency's operational cauity in
the event of exposure of an individual under cover, it has
been established policy that no more than two individuals
would be furnished cover by the same company. At the present
time this ratio is confined to upproximately 25% of the total
number of companies now being used and efforts are unde
way to effect further reductions toward the goal of one
individual per company.

4. Jn addition to the primary corporate cover function
described in-paragraph 1. above, CCS maintains continuing
contact with two U.S, car rental firms and two U.S, .credit
card firms for the purpose of obtaining backstopped credit
cards in alias for operational use in the United States and
abroad by Agency personnel. 42 such cards are now being
used by 34 individuals.



DEVISED FACILITIES COVER

1. Central Cover Staff (CCS) maintains 311 back-
stopped notional facilities which were created to pro~
vide cover for Agency personnel in the United States
and abroad and to provide an attributable source for
Agency funds used in operations and requiring conceal-
ment of Agency or U.S, Government interest. The facilities
comprise 43 corporations providing personal status cover,
payrolling and tax attribution sources, and other miscel-
laneous support such as title to property,‘ funding, etc.;
61 sole-proprietorships providing status and operational
cover, including payrolling and tax attribution; and 207
non-registered companics providing support for high risk
operational requirements, agents abroad, corporate reim-
bursements, and proprietary funding.

2. 224 Agency personnel engaged in operational
activities are payrolled by the facilitics, an essential
procedure permitting the reporting of Agency salavics with~-
out documenting the Agency as the source. :

3. The facilities provide a capability for passing
Agency funds to 30 Agency proprictaries and 97 bona fide
companies on a continuing basis. 225 bank accounts
located in 36 banks throughout the United States provide
the mechanisms for transmittal of these funds.

SUBJECT: Foreign Support For Activities Planned to Disrupt

1. There are only limited indications thus far of
foreign efforts to inspire, support or take advantage of
activities designed to disrupt or harass the National
Convention of the Republican Party in San Diego, 21-23

; 2. Some American participants at the Soviet-controlled
World Assembly for Peace and Independence of the Peoples of
Indochina, held 11-13 February 1972 in Paris/Versailles,
attempted unsuccessfully to include a call for international
demonstrations to take place at the time of the Republican
National Convention. A representative of the San Diego

* Convention Coalition (SDCC), one of the domestic action

"groups targetting on the Republican Conventicn, requested

_ the Anerican Delegations' Steering Committee at the World
Assembly to include a specific call for international
support of activities against the Republican convention
in their proposal to the Action Commission of the, World
Assembly. This request, however, was droppec as. too

tions that the proposal would be taken. to the floor of
the Assembly. .

3. John LENNON, a British subject, has provided
financial support to Project "YES", which in turn paid
.the travel expenses to the World Assembly of a representa-
: tive of leading antiwar activist Rennie DAVIS. (DAVIS' repre-
i sentative is tentatively planning to assist in preparations
BEEEE, for disruptive actions at the San Diego Convention.)
Project "YES" is an adjunct to another LENNON-supported pro-
ject, the Election Year Strategy Information Center (EYSIC),
of which Rennie DAVIS is a key leader, which was set up to
direct New Left protest activities at the Republican
National Convention. In Paris Rennie DAVIS' representative
to the World Assembly met at least once with officials of
the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Vietnam;

Foreign Support for Activities Planned to Disrupt
no or Harass the Republican National Convention

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION:

___Indications. remain limited, thus far, of foreign efforts
to inspire, support or take advantage of activities designed
to disrupt or harass the National Convention of the Republican
..Party in San Diego, 21-23 August 1972. The concept of coordinated
international support for domestic activities in the United
States was generally endorsed at the recent World Assembly for
Peace and Independence of the Peoples of Indochina; however, the
Conference issued no specific call for international support of
disruptive actions at the American national political conventions.

BACKGROUN

At the Soviet-controlled World Assembly for Peace and
Independence of the Peoples of Indochina, held in Versailles
from 10-15 February 1972, there was mention of American plans
for demonstrations at both the Republican and Democratic
National Conventions. The final draft resolution from the
Conference's "Action Commission" contains an appendix submitted
by American delegates whose goal was to secure global coordination

. £or domestic actions in the United States. It calls for inter-
.° national support to six weeks of domestic antiwar actions and

_ demonstrations, from 1 April to 15 May 1972, and concludes with
| the statement: 'This campaign will lead up to the Democratic
|___Party.Convention at Miami on July 9, 1972, and the Republican
Party Convention in San Diego on August 21, 1972."

‘The final "Resolution of the Paris World Assembly for the
m—Pedte"and Independence of the Indochinese People" of 13 February
1972,;-drafted by the "Political Commission" states:

"In the United States particularly, the protest against
‘the war is voiced more and more strongly, under various
‘forms, such as draft evasions, desertions, resistance, denmon-
——Strations which now affect even the soldiers. The Assembly
: calls for support to thése progressive and antiwar forces in
aes _the United States, and asks the governments to grant asylun
to deserters and to support their right to repatriation.
All together, the peoples of the world will efficiently heip
to impose on the U.S. Government-the restoration of peacc,
and independencé and freedom in Vietnan, Laos, and Cambodia."

SUMMARY : PEEeEE oo a a : ;

There is little new evidence of foreign plans or efforts
to inspire, support, or take advantage of actions designed to
disrupt or harass the Republican National Convention in San
Diego, 21 to 23. August 1972. The Students for a Democratic
Society, in joining the ranks of domestic groups planning
actions at the Republican Convention, has adopted a proposal
to cooperate with Mexican workers and students in a demonsira-
tion in Tijuana, Mexico, during the Convention. The San Dieg
Convention Coalition (SDCC), another domestic group targettii
on the Convention, has received a letter of solidarity froin
the North Vietnamese. The letter is of interest as an indica-
tion of North Vietnamese contact’ with the SDCC; such contact
will be required for the SDCC to implement its earlier-renorted
plans for broadcasts over public address systems during the
ponyention of live telephone calls from the Vietnamese in

aris. 7

DEVELOPMENTS:

At its recent convention in Cambridge, Massachusetts,
held 30 March to 2 April 1972, the Students for a Democratic
Society (SDS) adopted a proposal to hold demonstrations at
the San Diego-Tijuana border during the Republican National
Convention. The proposal included a call for SDS to cooperate

. with Mexican workers and students in an action to occur during
a fiesta in Tijuana, where Convention delegates will be
entertained. is

The North Vietnamese have given their endorsement to
the San Diego Convention Coalition (SDCC) in the form of a
letter from the Vietnam Committee for Solidarity with the

‘American People (VCSWAP), a quasi-official organ of the

North Vietnamese Government. The letter, which has been

_circulated by the SDCC and is dated 27 January 1972

-expresses "great delight" with the formation of the SDCC,

and conveys the Committee's "best wishes of militant soii-
darity and friendship.'' The VCSWAP requests that the SDCC

| SUMMARY:

The only new indication of foreign plans or efforts
to inspire,. support, influence, or exploit actions. designed
to disrupt or harass the Republican National Convention in
Miami, Florida, 21-23 August 1972, is an expression of
interest by a member of the North Vietnamese Delegation to
the Paris Peace Talks in the plans of the major antiwar
organizations in the United States for demonstrations in
connection with the political conventions of both major
parties.

DEVELOPMENTS:

In mid-May 1972, a member of the North Vietnamese
Delegation to the Paris Peace Talks invited a visitor to
contact him again when the visitor returned from an imminent
trip to the United States. The North Vietnamese official
gave the visitor the New York City addresses of the People's
Coalition for Peace and Justice (PCPJ) and the National
Peace Action Coalition (NPAC), and asked the visitor to
inquire at their offices regarding their plans for demonstra-
tions during the coming summer. The North Vietnamese
official stated that he was especially interested in plans
for actions in connection with the Democratic and Republican

Foreign Support for Activities Planned to Disrupt

SUMMARY =
New indications of foreign plans or efforts to inspire,
support, influence, or exploit activities designed to dis-
xyupt or harass the Republican National Convention in Miami,
Florida, 21-24 August 1972, consist of the following: A
leader of the People's Coalition for Peace and Justice
(PCPJ) has stated that demonstrations will be organized to
take place at United States and allied military installa-
tions abroad during the period immediately before and during
the Republican Convention. The PCPJ leader also stated that
representatives of the Stockholm Conference on Vietnam will
‘“participate in activities in connection with the Convention.
*The Anti-War Union (ANU) , a domestic organization which has
been active in planning demonstrations in connection with the
Republican National Convention, has sent a delegation to
Paris, France, to meet with officials of the Democratic Repub-
lic of Vietnam (DRV) and the Provisional Revolutionary Govern-
ment of South Vietnam (PRG). No information is presently
available, however, indicating that actions at the Republican
Convention have been discussed at these meetings.

: . DEVELOPMENTS:
In an early July 1972 meeting with prominent members of

.. foreign antiwar .organizations, a representative of the People's

Coalition for Peace and Justice (PCPJ), v who occupies an impor-

tant position within that organization, discussed the plans

of the PCPJ in connection with the upcoming election campaign

in the United States. The PCPJ representative stated that

during the: period 14-23 August, a "Peoples Campaign Against

Bombing" would be waged in U.S. cities involved in the manu-

facture and shipping of materials for use in Vietnam, and

that similar actions will be organized at United States and

allied military installations abroad. The PCPJ representa-

tive further stated that "dramatic demonstrations" in protest

Of the bombing a pveee are being organ a by the "Repub-

21 August 1972. In an apparent reference to the 21 August
actions, the PCPJ leader added that representatives of the
Stockholm Conference on Vietnam will speak on the subject of
the alleged American bombing of dikes in North Vietnam.
(Comment: We have no-present information concerning plans of
Stockholm Conference representatives to travel’to the United
States during the Republican National Convention; nor do we

; have any additional information concerning plans of Stockholn
Conference representatives’ to participate in activities con-
nected with the Republican Convention.)

The Anti-War Union (ANU), a domestic group engaged in
organizing counter-activities at the Republican National Con-
vention, has sponsored the travel of a delegation of activists
to Paris, France, to meet with officials of the Democratic
Republic of North Vietnam (DRV) and the Provisional Revolu-

sptionary Government of South Vietnam (PRG). An advance party
+ has already met with DRV and PRG representatives to discuss
the agenda for meetings with the full ANU delegation. Alth
no information is presently available indicating that actions
at the Republican Convention have been discussed or are sched-
uled to be discussed at meetings between the AWU delegation
and the DRV/PRG officials, it is known that members of the At
advance party have asked for advice from the PRG officials
regarding the stance the ANU should take on certain questions
relating to the presidential elections. It is also known
that the DRV officials have questioned the AWU advance party
about the political mood in the United States. One of the
AWU delegation. members has stated that upon their return to
. the United States about 26 July 1972, some of the members
“will speak at rallies, over the radio, and on television,
to "educate the American people about the consequences of
‘voting for Nixon, and the need to end the war and defeat
Nixon." The delegation member added that the demonstrations
-at-the Republican Convention will be "unique."

Foreign Support for Activities Planned to Disrupt
or Harass the Republican National Convention

be i

SUMMARY: = i
There are no new indications of specific foreign plans or efforts to
inspire, support, influence, or exploit activities designed to disrupt or
harass the Republican National Convention in Miami, Florida, 21-24 August
1972. Although mectings have been held recently in Paris, France, between
American antiwar activists and representatives of the Democratic Republic
of North Victriam (DRV) and the Provisional Revolutionary Government of
South Victnam (PRG), currently available information indicates that the

. DRV/PRG officials made no efforts to encourage or give guidance to the

American participants with respect to the upcoming Republican National
Convention. Private discussions, separate from the meetings with the entire
American delegation, were conducted by both the DRV and the PRG officials;
,at present, we have no information regarding the substance of these private
exchanges. A second group of aclivists, considered more important than
the first delegation, is scheduled to travel to Paris on or about 1 August 1972
for further consultations with the PRG and DRV representatives.

In recent meetings in Paris, France, with members of an American
deligation sponsored by the Anti-War Union (AWU), representatives of
the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV) and the Provisional Revolutionary
Government of South Vietnam (PRG) were very guarded with respect to dis-
cussing activities at the Republican National Convention. Although the Vietnam-
ese repeatedly questioned the Americans concerning the mood of the antiwar
movement in the United States, they made no direct reference to the Repub-
lican Convention, except for one instance when PRG Deputy Chief Nguyen
Nan TIEN accused President Nixon of using the private and public sessions
of the Paris peace talks as "propaganda for the Republican Convention."
TIEN then urged the Americans to promote and propagandize the Seven
Point Plan offered by the PRG. The Americans, too, for the most part,
refrained from discussing the Convention, other than to estimate that demon~
strators will number about 10,000 at the Convention.



Following their meeting on 22 July 1972 with the AWU delegation,
the PRG officials held additional talks with sub-groups of the delegation.
Additionally, at least one of the American participants was invited by
the DRV officials to return for further discussions. At present, there
is no information available concerning the substance of these private
exchanges. :

A second, more important delegation of Americans connected with

the Anti-War Union is scheduled to travel to Paris circa 1 August 1972
for further consultation with DRV and PRG representatives. This second
group is scheduled to be led by Rennic DAVIS, founder and leader of the

. AWU. This will be DAVIS! second trip to Paris within recent months for
discussions with DRV and PRG representatives. Upon his return from
his first trip, DAVIS publicly stated that the AWU would demonstrate at
both the Democratic and the Republican Convention, but that the AWU's
chief target would be the Republican Convention.

Foreign Support for Activities Planned to. Disrupt
Or Harass the Democratic National Convention

There are no direct indications thus. far of foreign
efforts to inspire, support or take advantage of activities
designed to disrupt or harass the National Convention of
the Democratic Party in Miami; 10-13 July 1972. The concept
of coordinated international support for domestic activities
in the United States was generally endorsed at the recent
World Assembly for Peace and Independence of the Peoples
of.Indochina; however, the Conference issued no specific
call for international support of disruptive actions at the
American national political conventions.

: At-the Soviet-controlled World Assembly for Peace

Versailles from 10-13 February 1972, there was mention of
American plans for demonstrations at both the Republican
and Democratic National Conventions. The final draft

tains an appendix submitted by American delegates whose
goal was to secure global coordination for domestic actions

to six weeks of domestic antiwar actions and demonstrations,
from 1 April to 15 May 1972, and concludes with the state-
ment: “This campaign will lead up to the Democratic Party

Party Convention in.San Diego on August 21, 1972."

The final "Resolution of the Paris World Assembly
for the Peace and Independence of the Indochinese People"
of 13 February 1972, drafted by the "Political Commission"
states: :

"In the United ‘States particularly, the protest
against the war is voiced more and more strongly,

under. various forms, such as draft evasions,

calls for support to. these progressive and
antiwar forces in the United States, and asks
the governments to grant asylum to deserters
“\° and to support their right to repatriation.
“ - All together, the peoples of the world will

Foreign Support for Activities Planned to Disrupt |
* or Harass the Democratic National Convention

SUMMARY:

New indications of foreign efforts or plans to inspire,

support, influence, or exploit actions designed to disrupt

_or harass the Democratic National Convention in Miami, 10-15
July 1972, are limited to a reiteration by a member of the
Secretariat of the Stockholm Conference on Vietnam of a
statenent previously issued by the World Assembly for Peace
and Independence of the Peoples of Indochina. The Assembly's
" pronouncement generally endorsed the concept of international
support to a campaign of anti-Vietnam War activities in the
United States leading up to the Democratic and Republican
Conventions, but made no specific call for support of dis-
ruptive actions at the conventions themselves.

. BEE

” DEVELOPMENTS :

In early April 1972 an influential and well-informed
staff mber of the Stockholm Conference on Vietn discussed,
in private, the international anti-Vietnam War activities
conducted on 1, 15, and 22 April. The Stockholm Conference
member stated that these actions were part of an international
Campaign in support of domestic American antiwar efforts
during the period 1 April to 15 May 1972, and “will culminate
at the election conventions in July and August."

The World Assembly for Peace and Independence of the
Peoples of Indochina, of which the Stockholm Conference was
a.major organizer, had earlier enunciated a similar statement
in an appendix to the final draft resolution of the Assembly's

“-"Action Commission." The appendix called for international
support to six weeks of domestic antiwar actions and demon-
strations, from 1 April to 15 May 1972, and concluded with

““the statement: "This campaign will lead up to the Democratic

Party Convention at Miami on July 9, 1972, and the Republican

Party Convention in San Diego on August 21, 1972."

Foreign Support for Activities Planned to Disrupt
--or Harass the Democratic, National Convention

SUMMARY:

Indications remain Limited of foreign plans or attempts
. to inspire, support, infiuence, or exploit actions designed
to disrupt or harass the Democratic National Convention in
Miami, Florida, 10-13 July 1972. A member of the Swedish
Committee for Vietnam, who is also a member of the Secre-
tariat of the Stockholm Conference on Vietnam, has stated
that the U.S. National Elections. are playing a role in

the Swedish Committee's work. The British-based Interna-
tional Confederation for Disarmament and Peace (ICDP) has
distributed a "Spring Offensive Calendar" of activities

in the United States against the war based on a submission
by the Peoples' Coalition for Peace and Justice (PCPJ).

The calendar includes actions planned in connection with
the Democratic Convention.

DEVELOPMENTS:

In mid- -April 1972, a member of the Swedish Committee
for Vietnan, who is also an influential and well-informed
staff member of the Secretariat of the Steckholm Conference
on Vietnan, stated in a private discussion of the Swedish
Committee's unusually heavy work load that “things will be
hectic right until the elections in the U.S."

: The International Confederation for Disarmament and
Peace, a British-based antiwar organization and one of the
more prominent member organizations of the Stockholm Con-
ference, has attached a "Spring Offensive Calendar" to the
April-} ‘ay 1972 issue of its regular. international publica-
tion Vietnam International. The calendar had been furnished
by the People's Coalition for Peace and Justice (PCPJ) and
included the following entry:

July 9 - 12 Democratic Convention, Miami Beach.
= : Demonstrations organised by Florida
People's Coalition, Box 17521, Tampa,
Florida 33612.



The ICDP commentary on the PCPJ calendar urges demonstrations
sat in support of some of the dates listed but does not specifically
-call for actions in connection with the Democratic Convention.

SUMMARY: i j oan

The only new indication of foreign plans or efforts
- to inspire, support, influence, or exploit actions designed
to disrupt or harass the Democratic National Convention in
"Miami, Florida, 10-13 July 1972, is an expression of interest
by a member of the North Vietnamese Delegation to the Paris
Peace Talks in the plans of the major antiwar orgamizations
vin the United States for demonstrations in’ connection with
the political conventions of both major parties.

DEVELOPNENTS: esteecyetan
In mid-May 1972, a member of the North Vietnamese Dele-

. gation to the Paris Peace Talks invited a visitor to contact
him again when the visitor returned from an imminent trip
to the United States. The North Vietnamese official gave
the visitor the New York City addresses of the People's |
Coalition for Peace and Justice (PCPJ) and the National
Peace Action Coalition (NPAC), and asked the visitor to
inquire at their offices regarding their plans for denon-
strations during the coming summer. The North Vietnamese
-official stated that he was especially interested in plans
for actions in connection with the Democratic and National
Conventions.

MEMORANDUM FOR : Deputy Director for Operations i

SUBJECT 3 Areas of Possible Embarrassment
to the Agency i

.

:

1, Sometime in the spring or early summer of 1971, Mr. John
Dean levied the requirement on the Agency for information relating to
the Investors Overseas Service (IOS). The original request was
non-specific but it gradually emerged that Dean was concerned with
the possible adverse publicity that might develop regarding the
President's nephew, who was employed by IOS.

2. There were multiple channels from the White House to the
Agency on this subject:

a, Presumably Haldeman and/or Ehrlichman to Director
Helms,

b. Someone (unnamed) in the White House to the DDCI,
General Cushman (see attached telephone conversation).
Note that Ehrlichman is mentioned, and

¢c. John Dean to the CI Staff. These various channels
: were sorted out in time and six reports were passed by
the CI Staff to Mr, Fred Fielding for Mr, John Dean.

3, The telephone call of General Cushman's is of interest since
“it gives the flaver of White House concern, It took several days to
uncover the fact that the White House interest centered on the involve-
_ ment of the President's nephew with IOS and possible adverse publicity.
-The reports submitted to Dean's office were routine in nature and were
coordinated with the DCI, After a few months, interest in this sub-,
ject died down and we did not pursue it further,

5. LIalso include a short note on the Intelligence Evaluation
Committee and Staff prepared by Richard Ober, The original
meetings were held in the office of John Dean at the White House
and the principal sparkplug for this group activity was the then
Assistant Attorney General for Internal Security, Robert Mardian
and then later his assistant, William Olsen. It is noted that Mr. “—~\
Mardian is now appearing before the Grand Jury andvit is always
possible that he might draw in the Agency.

6. Before appointing Ober to the IES Staff as the Agency
representative, I had attended various inter-agency meetings pre-
sided over by Mardian. Iexpressed the view to Director Helms
that Mardian would require very careful handling due to his inex-
perience, Furthermore, Mardian was deeply involved in the split
between Bill Sullivan and Mr. Hoover, Ona confidential basis
one or two senior FBI officials stated that Sullivan was secretly
passing files to Mardian without Mr, Hoover's permission, This
was one of the important reasons why Sullivan was dismissed from
the Bureau.

SUBJECT: The MHCHAOS Program

1. The MHCHAOS program is a worldwide program for
clandestine collection abroad of information on foreign
efforts to support/encourage/exploit/manipulate domestic

. U.S. extremism, especially by Cuba, Communist China,
-,North Vietnam, the Soviet Union, North Korea and the
Arab fedayeen.

2. -The MHCHAOS program has not and is not conduct-
ing efforts domestically for internal domestic collection
purposes. Agency efforts are foreign. Foreign-oriented
activity in the United States has been of two types:

a. Selected FBI domestic sources who travel
abroad in connection with their extremist activity
and/or affiliations to make contact with hostile
foreign powers or with foreign cxtremist groups
have been briefed and debriefed by Headquarters
officers. The briefing has included appropriate
operational guidance, including defensive advice.

b. Americans with existing extremist creden-
tials have been assessed, recruited, tested and
dispatched abroad for PCS assignments as contract
agents, primarily sources offered for such use by
the FBI. When abroad they collect information re-

x sponsive to MICHAOS program requirements, as well
as other Agency requirements. They are thus used
primarily for targeting against Cubans, Chinese Con-
munists, the North Vietnamese, etc., as their back-
ground and their particular access permits. It
should be noted that the MPTROIKA aspect of the
MPLODESTAR project of the East Asia Division is
similar to the MHCIAOS PROGRAM.

3. As indicated earlier, MHCHAOS is a foreign pro-
gram, conducted overseas, except for the limited activity
described above. The program is and has been managed so
as to achieve the maximum feasible utilization of exist-
ing resources of the Operations Directorate. No assets

have been recuited and run exclusively for the MICHAOS
program. Instead, emphasis has been placed on the exploi-

- tation of new and old Agency assets who have a by-product

capability or a concurrent capability for provision of
information responsive to the program's requirements.

This has involved the provision of custom-tailored collec-
tion requirements and operational guidance. This collec-
tion program is viewed as an integral part of the recruit-
ment and collection programs of China Operations, Vietnam
Operations, Cuban Operations, Soviet Bloc Division opera-

‘tions and Korean Branch operations. Agents who have an

American "Movement" background.or who have known connec-
tions with the American "Movement" are useful as access
agents to obtain biographic and personality data, to dis-
cern possible vulnerabilities and susceptibilities, and
to develop operationally exploitable relationships with
recruitment targets of the above programs. These assets
are of interest to our targets because of their connec-
tions with and/or knowledge of the American "Movement."
Over the course of the MHCHAOS program, there have been
approximately 20 important areas of operational interest,
which at the present time have been reduced to about ten:
Paris, Stockholm, Brussels, Dar Es Salaam, Conakry, Algiers,
Mexico City, Santiago, Ottawa and Hong Kong.

4. The MHCHAOS program also utilizes audio opera-
tions, two of which have been implemented to cover tar-
gets of special interest.

foreign operation. PEELE

5. MHCHAOS reporting from abroad relating to the
program originates in two ways: Individuals who are noted
in contact with Cubans, the Chinese Communists, etc., and
who appear to have extremist connections, interests or
background are reported upon. Other individuals are re-
ported upon in response to. specific Headquarters require-
ments received from the FBI because such individuals. are
of active investigatory security interest to the FBI.

6. All cable and dispatch traffic related to the
MHCHAOS program is sent via reStricted channels. It is
not processed by either the Cable Secretariat or the In-
formation Services Division. The control and retriecv-
ability of information obtained, including information
received from the FBI, is the responsibility of the Spe-
cial Operations Group.

7. Information responsive to specific FBI require-
ments is disseminated to the FBI via special controlled
dissemination channels, i.e., by restricted handling cable
traffic or via special pouch and specially numbered blind
memoranda.

8. Information of particular significance, when col-
lected, has becn disseminated by special memorandum over
the signature of the Director of Central Intelligence to
the White liouse (Dr. Kissinger and John Dean), as well as
to the Attorney General, the Secretary of State and the
Director of the FBI.

a. Question: What is the arrangement re,recruiting
out of colleges? Any clearances or prohibitions?

Answer: As of now CSI 50-10 specifically

requires approval by the, ADDO or DDO for any

recruitment attempt made in the United States

against an American member of the academic
“community or a foreign target attending an American

academic institution. This regulation-is presently in

the process of revision in that this approval authority

for academic recruitments in the United States is to

be delegated to Chief, FR. The approval authority

for recruitment attempts against American students

outside the United States is to be delegated to the Chief

of the appropriate area division. The only prohibitions

at the present time are those precluding recruitment

attempts against foreign students here in the United States

on grants from Ford Foundation, Rockefeller or Fulbright.

If you have further questions, please let me know.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director for Operations
SUBJECT: Foreign Resources Division Operational
Activities with Possible Flap Potential

1, At thr risk of stating the obvious, almost all of the operational
activities carried on by FR Division in the United States run the risk
that unauthorized disclosure could create embarrassment to the Agency.
We have accepted this as a condition precedent and have proceeded with
our operational activities in the most professional manner possible under
the circumistances. There are certain rather unusual activities in which
FR Division has partic!pated and/or is participating that contain some
what greater possibility for embarrassment if discovered. I have listed
these below, not necessarily in order of embarrassment potential:

a. | reacts 20 — |provides a fairly considerable

amount of support to Dr. Kissinger in his contacts with the
Chinese. This support was authorized by Mr. Karamessines
and Mr. Helms. Thus far there has been no problem other
than the inordinate amount of time spent by[ seca s or]
personnel, not to mention the fairly sizeable amount of

money that has been expended in support of these efforts.

b. A CIA Officer is to be assigned to FR Division. The
CIA Officer, is presently assigned overseas under deep
cover;

In discussions between
NOCAD and the ADDO, it was decided that the Officer would
be pulled out and reassigned in the United States.
FR Division was directed to accept this officer for assignment,

NW 65360 Docld:32989624 Page 183

We have concluded that the best solution is to have this
officer attend a university in the Midwest for at least

a year, working towards an advanced degree until there
has been time for the situation to clarify itself. We plan

to make no operational use of the CIA Offi: Natsoever,,
during the period of time that he is attending the’ university.
Upon completion of his year's study, we will review the ,
situation and decide the next course of action at that time.

Paragraph l, c, is deleted because it contains sensitive

Agency operational methods and techniques.

Coordination
A, Internal

In developing its cadre of general support assets
and access agents, the FR Division maintains close contact
with the Domestic Contact Service of the Directorate for
Intelligence, using their assets wherever and whenever
possible to support FR's operational activities. Toa

more limited degree, FR Bases maintain contacts with Office

of Security and Office of Personnel field representatives,
pursuing the occasional leads surfaced by these officers
and using their entre to specific individuals who can
provide access to targets of operational interest.

B. External

FR officers in the field maintain coordination with
their FBI counterparts. There is limited cooperation
with Bureau offices on internal security cases involving
Soviet and Bloc officials and the local FBI offices are
of. occasional help in operations involving other nationals.
The local field offices of the FBI are made aware of the
presence of FR officers in their jurisdictions and have on
occasion provided backstopping on cases where there was.
some flap potential.

Coordination with the FBI of FR Division's agent
recruitment activity is governed by an agreement between
the Agency and the FBI dated 7 Fébruary 1966.

The Bases also have contact with local Immigration
and Naturalization Service offices although. these contacts
are less frequent and less important than the contacts :

with “the FBI offices.

A review of the central files of the FBI revealed
that a file pertaining to your application for employment
with the Department of Justice and a file which lists you as
the victim in a case involving the Congressional Assassination
Statute are maintained by this Bureau.

Enclosed herewith are pertinent documents from the
Departmental Applicant file. Certain data in this file is
exempt from public disclosure pursuant to the provisions of
Title 5, United States Code, Section 552 (b) (2), (b) (5), and
(b) (7) (C) and (D). As I am sure you are aware, these exemptions
allow for the withholding of information related solely to the
internal personnel rules and practices of an agency; inter-
agency or intra-agency documents not available through discovery
proceedings during litigation; information which would constitute
an unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of another
individual; and information which would disclose the identity
of a confidential source.

The other file pertains to an investigation concerning
a threat against your life. Although your name is carried in
the title throughout the file as the "victim," only a minimal
amount of information refers to you. The file indicates that
the Denver Police Department received information that a
particular individual was in Denver to kill you if you were
elected as United States Senator from Colorado on November 5,
1974; that the polls indicated you would be elected; that you
and your Denver Office were aware of this threat; that the
Denver Police Department afforded protection for you until you
departed Denver the morning of November 6, 1974, for vacation
in Mexico; and that an Agent of this Bureau attempted to see
you to display a photograph of the suspect, but was advised
by your assistant that the Denver Police Department had

provisions of the Freedom of Infermation Act, Title 5,
United States Code, Section 552 (b) (2), {b) (5) and (b) (7) (C)}

Also, our records contain two documents from the

By Senators Gary Hart, Walter D. Huddleston, Charles McC. Mathias,
Walter F. liondale and Robert Morgan, Members of the U. S. Senate
Select Committee on Intelligence Activities." DRW:mlh.

Senator Huddleston is identical with subject of
Bufiles 166-5980, 94-67291, and 94-1-676~-300. Huddleston
was contacted by Bureau liaison to offer any assistance
to the newly elected Senator, which is standard Bureau policy.
Huddleston's Executive Assistant called the Congressional
Service Office on 1/9/75, and requested a speaker from the
FBI to address the Kentucky Chamber of Commerce Convention.
Speaker granted. Huddleston was alleged to have taken a
bribe of $15,000 while he was a State Senator in Kentucky.
Several persons approached him to find out if they could
establish a bank charter. His supposed reply was that this
could be accomplished for a certain amount of money. The
bank charter was eventually established and one of the
individuals who originally approached him, hand-carried the
$15,000 in cash to him at his office. On 9/5/73, the
Department advised the FBI that it desired no wore invest-~
igation in this case at that time, Senator Huddleston was
never interviewed regarding this matter. Excised documents
taken from 94-67291~3,2,1; 94-1-676-300; and 166-5980-9,7,5,4,

THEIR FBI FILES

At the meeting between Mr. Kelley and the Attorney
General, along with their respective staffs on 7/21/75, the Attorney
General determined that there should be broad disclosure of material
in the files of those Senators on the Senate Select Committee requesting
access to same and that in the main the Bureau should only restrict p
access to revelation of live informants or information which would
reveal the identity of live informants. In addition, he indicated that i
in his review of the file on Senator Hart he noted certain der ogato; t
information on relatives which he felt Senator Hart should not see.
Also, there may be criminal investigations against one of the Senghors
of such a nature that revelation should be restricted.

It was agreed that Deputy Assistant Attorney General
O'Connor and I should review the files in order to determine problem
areas and Mr. O'Connor would consult with,Judge Tyler as,needed. j 7 5

Files have been reviewed and there is general agréement

’ FBI INFORMATION-GATHERING PRACTICES
‘ WITH RESPECT TO MEMBERS OF CONGRESS

There is a total of more than 6,500,000 files at
FBI Headquarters. Most of these contain information gathered
during investigation of matters-~including some 100 types of
criminal, security, and applicant-employee cases--assigned to
the FBI by laws of Congress, directives of the President, and
orders of the Attorney General. .

The remainder of these more than 6,500,000 files
include:

(1) Personnel files regarding FBI applicants .and
employees;

(2) General files regarding FBI contacts and
dealings with a variety of individuals and
organizations concerning matters that do
hot require or involve FBI investigation; and

; (3) Administrative-type files, such as those of a
policy nature, those containing statistical
reports, those detailing FBI cooperative
services, and the like.

‘ An unknown, but extremely small, percentage of
these more than 6,500,000 FBI files contain information
regarding present or former Congressmen and Senators which

may. have been accumulated prior to, during, or after their
tenure in Congress.

“WHAT FBI FILES CCNTAIN ON CONGRESSMEN :

FBI Files contain substantially the same types of
information regarding Senators and Congressmen as is contained
in them about other citizens. Basically this information falls
into the following categories:

Violations of Law

(1) Allegations that Congressmen or Senators have
violated Federal laws within the FBI's jurisdiction. SEE

4) |

S Femme yas |

| i 7 ae e ; | é

| “(he FBI investigates such allegations whether they
relate to Members of Congress or any other person. The
results of these investigations are furnished to United States
Attorneys and/or other prosecutive officials of the Department
of Justice. The investigation may establish (a} that the
Congressman or Senator has, in fact, violated a Federal law,
(b) that a Federal law has been violated, but that the involve-
ment of the Congressman or Senator in that violation cannot be
established, (c) that a Federal law has been violated, but
that the Congressman or Senator clearly had no involvement

in its violation, or (d) that no violation of Federal law

was committed.

Included among such allegations invclving Congress-
men and Senators have been the following types of violations
within the FBI's jurisdiction: Bank Fraud and Embezzlement;
Conflict of Interest; Conspiracy to Obstruct Justice; Election
H Laws; Fraud Against the Government; and Interstate Transporta-
tion in Aid of Racketeering.

(2) Violations of Federal laws within the FBI's
jurisdiction involving Congressmen and Senators as victims.

The results of FBI investigations of such violations
are furnished to United States Attorneys and/or other prosecu-
tive officials of the Department of Justice. In Many instances,
the original complaint in these cases is received from the law-~
maker-victim himself; however, if the information originates
elsewhere, the FBI promptly notifies the Congressman or, Senator
_involved of the threat which has been made. In addition; other
law enforcement agencies which have a legitimate interest in
E these cases are notified of the threat.

. ‘Violations of the Congressional Assassination, Kid-
naping and Assault Statute, Bomb Threats, and Extortion are
among the crimes within the FBI's jurisdiction which have
involved lawmakers as victims.

(3) Allegations that_members of the staffs of
Congressmen or Senators have vidlated Fedéral laws within the
FBI's jurisdiction, or that these staff members have been
victims of such violations.

The FBI investigates such allegations and furnishes
the results to United States Attorneys and/or other prosecutive
officials of the Department of Justice. Where appropriate, the
bare enn or Senator involved is also advised of the investi-
gation.

Congressmen and Senators may be interviewed by the
FBI in these cases involving Congressional aides--just as they
may be interviewed in connection with other types of FBI
investigations--and both the fact of, and the results of,
such interviews are noted in the file reflecting the FBI
investigation.

(4) Allegations that Senators cr Congressmen have
violated laws within the jurisdiction of other investigative
agencies.

These allegations are brought to the attention of
the agency concerned--Federal, state, or local. Such allega-
tions are not investigated by the FBI. However, the coopera-
tive services of the FBI Laboratory, Identification Division,
and National Crime Information Center are available to other
law enforcement agencies in the investigation of these, as
well as other, crimes.

Applicant Investigations

(5) Present and former Congressmen and Senators
often are considered for positions in the Executive or
Judicial Branches of the Federal Government which require:
that the FBI conduct a thorough background investigation
of them. 7

Dependent upon the nature of the position involved,
the results- of these investigations are furnished to the White
House, the Department of Justice, and/or other appropriate
Government agencies.

(6) Congressmen and Senators often are interviewed
in the course of applicant~type investigations regarding
other persons who are being considered for Executive or
Judicial positions--as well as during applicant-type investi-
gations conducted by the FBI (at the request of the Committee
chairman involved) concerning staff members of a limited
number of House and Senate Committees. Both the fact of, and
the results of, the interview of the Congressman or Senator
are noted in the file reflecting the FBI's investigation.

Security Cases

(7) Either prior to, during, or subsequent to their
tenure in Congress, there may be files pertaining to security-
type matters which relate to members of the House and Senate,
ox Congressmen may be identified in FBI files as actual or
intended victims of acts by subjects of security-type cases.

car i = 7 r) . e

The Statutes covering such matters are Title 18, Section 2383

5 ‘(Rebellion and Insurrection), Title 18, Section 2384 (Seditious
7 - Conspiracy), and Title 18, Section 2385 (Smith Act -

Advocating overthrow of Government by force).

\ Oral_or Written Contact

i (8) An unknown number of FBI files contain copies
of correspondence between the FBI and Congressmen and Senators
; concerning a wide variety of matters which include bills
pending in, or passed by, Congress; personnel matters; the
Bureau's cooperative services; and FBI policies, procedures,
and investigations. Many of these letters from Congressmen

iq and Senators have been prompted by inquiries which these

H lawmakers have received from constituents or other interested
citizens.

The FBI's files also contain memoranda regarding
telephone calls and personal contacts the PBI has had with
Congressmen and Senators regarding the above-cited variety
of matters.

"Miscellaneous Information About Congressmen

(9) An unknown number of FBI files contain informa-
tion reflecting favorably or unfavorably upon the. character,
integrity, and loyalty of Senators and Congressmen--which
information does not require investigative action at the time
received on the part of the FBI or other law enforcement

- agencies, It consists of:

(a) -Information contained in unsolicited letters
received by the FBI from persons and organi-
zations representing a variety of backgrounds,
viewpoints, and walks of life.

(b) Information volunteered orally to FBI Agents by
the same broad range of individuals and organi-
zations as cited directly above.

(c) Newspaper clippings, as well as data from
magazines and other news dissemination media.

(a) Miscellaneous information received from FBI con-
fidential informants and/or other sensitive sources.

. NW 65360_Docld:32989624 Page 211



‘ Fingerprints of Congressmen

(10) The files of. the Identification Division
contain the fingerprints of an unknown number of Senators
and Congressmen. Some of these relate to their having been
arrested for violations of Federal, state, or local laws.
Others are noncriminal in origin and largely pertain to
their having served in the Armed Forces or having been appli-
cants for various positions. These fingerprint cards have
been submitted to the FBI by Federal agencies, as well as‘by
iocal, county, and state criminal justice agencies, throughout
the United States.

co aime oa

Fingerprint records are maintained by the FBI's
Identification Division, and they are kept entirely separate
and_apart from all other files and records of the FBI.

HOW INFORMATION ABOUT CONGRESSMEN REACHES FBI FILES:

There are two basic types of information regarding ,
Congressmen and Senators in FBI files:

(1) Information which the FBI has solicited during
investigations involving the Congressman or Senator as either ~
a subject or a victim. This includes information of
pertinence to the case which the lawmaker himself has
furnished to the FBI.

(2) Unsolicited information,

fhere are many sources of the unsolicited information

that is included in FBI files:
ia x

ie peace iterate Sma mt

(a) It is volunteered by citizens who are being
interviewed during investigations of matters

having no relationship to any of our Nation's
lawmakers.

(b) It is volunteered in communications sent to the
FBI by individuals and organizations.

(c) It is included in news articles and other reports
publicly disseminated by our Nation's news media
which come to. the FBI's attention.

(a) It is received from FBI confidential informants
and, very infrequently, from telephone taps not
directed at a Congressman which have been
installed with authority of a Federal Court
and/or authority of the Attorney General.

(e) In the case of information contained on finger-
print cards, it is sent to the FBI's Identifica-
tion Division by authorized contributors,
including criminal justice agencies throughout
the United States.

‘HOW AND WHERE INFORMATION ABOUT CONGRESSMEN IS MAINTAINED:

Information regarding Congressmen and Senators is
included in the official FBI files--totaling more than
6,500,000 in number--that are maintained by the Files and
Communications Division on an upper floor of the J. Edgar

Hoover FBI Building.

: The area where these files are maintained is staffed
and supervised 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to assure
continuous security.

General Index

The essential key tg the effective use of these FBI
files is the Bureau's General Index which consists of 58
million index cards and which is located on a different floor
from the files themselves in the J.- Edgar Hoover FBI- Building.
To determine what files (if any at all) contain information
regarding an individual Senator or Congressman, it is
necessary to search the name of that lawmaker in the General
Index. if

The General Index is staffed and supervised 24 hours

“a fay, 7 days a week, to assure continuous security.

Rules Governing Use of Files
These official FBI files are available only to FBI
personnel-~and they are available on a."“need<to-know" basis
only.

The Files and Communications Division maintains a

" vecora of files that have been charged out by Headquarters

personnel. Such files must be returned to the Files and
Communications Division as soon as possible; and during the
period that a file is charged out, it cannot be left even
momentarily in an unlocked room, If retained overnight,

the file must be kept ih a locked cabinet inside a locked
room.

SG



.NW 65360 Docld:32989624 Page 214

: = rd

The charge-out record is temporary in nature and
is. destroyed five days after the file has been returned to
the Files and Communications Division.

WHY THE FBI RETAINS INFORMATION REGARDING CONGRESSMEN:

The information regarding Congressmen and Senators
that is maintained in FBI files can be divided into three
major categories:

(1) The results of investigations (criminal-,
security~, and applicant-type) involving a Congressman or
Senator as a subject or victim;

(2) Information regarding a Congressman or Senator--
in addition to that gathered during investigation(s) of the
lawmaker involved--which the FBI has disseminated to other
Federal agencies (such as to the Internal Revenue Service if, for
example, the information involves a tax-related matter) and/or to
state and local law enforcement agencies (such as the police
department covering the lawmaker's home community if, for example,
the information involves an alleged threat against the lawmaker 's
house or other property); and

(3) Other information that. the FBI receives from,
or receives about, a Congressman or Senator that is included
in the FBI's files:-without having been either investigated
or disseminated by the FBI.

The reasons this information is retained in FBI
files can be explained in legal and administrative terms,
as well as in practical terms.

Legal_and Administrative Reasons

All investigative files and other records of the
FBI involving Congressmen.or Senators are within a class
of records which--under the FBI Records Retention Plan
developed in 1969 by the National Archives and Records
Service of the General Services Administration+-are con-
sidered of enduring archival value to ensure their preser-
vation.

This FBI Records Retention Plan was prepared under

the authority contained in the Federal Records Act of 1950,
which is contained in Title 44 of the United States Code. °

-7F-

so sal



Included among the FBI records to be retained
under the Records Retention Plan formulated by the National
Archives and Records Service are those which would have
historical value and would document policies, procedures,
functions, legislative and budget matters, and the like--
and reports of investigations of both civil and criminal
activities, including "crimes involving, and other records,
concerning, the Presidents and Vice Presidents of the
United States, members of and delegates elected to the
Congresses of the United States, cabinet heads, judges and
other officials appointed by the President.”

In establishing the FBI Records Retention Plan,
the National Archives and Records Service noted, "Ordinarily
the records of a Federal agency that are worthy of permanent
retention amount to a rather small percentage of the total
volume of records generated. Many of the records produced
by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, however, relate to
a number of controversial if not important aspects of the
history of the United States, particularly to the role of
the Federal Government in its relation to its citizens.

To be sure, many years will pass before these records can

be made available to the public for historical and other
sériows research, Nevertheless, the archival value of these
records will not decrease nor will interest in them dissipate."

In addition, the FBI is also required by the
Federal Records Act to make records containing adequate and
proper documentation of its administration and operations
which, among ather things, are designed to furnish informa-
tion necessary to protect the legal and financial interest

of the Government and of persons directly affected by FBI
activities.

Practival Reasons for Retaining Information

Logic, reason, and lessons learned from more than
six decades of: law enforcement experience dictate that the
FBI should maintain records of investigations it has conducted
(category #1 cited at the top of page 7) and records of
information it has disseminated to other agencies (category #2
on page 7). : :

Such records enable the FBI to answer questions or
challenges (including those arising in judicial or administra-
tive proceedinyzs) involving investigations FBI Agents have
conducted and,or information the FBI has disseminated to other

-~8-

NW 65360 Docid:32989624 Page 215



|
H
i
}

NW .65360 Docld:32989624 Page 216

agencies. Such records also enable the FBI to furnish additional
copies of investigative reports or other information that has
been disseminated-~should additional copies be needed by the
original recipients or by other official agencies. Furthermore,
the information contained in these files often proves of
assistance in future investigations.

Less obvious may be the reasons why the FBI retains
the third category of information about Congressmen and
Senators (data that has neither been investigated nor
disseminated by the FBI) cited on page 7.

If such information is of an administrative nature--
that is, if the information indicates the [awmaker is interested
in a specific FBI investigation, a specific area of the FBI's
jurisdiction, or specific FBI policies, practices and procedures-~
it is filed for:

(1) the information and advice of FBI employees in
connection with future contacts or correspondence with that
Congressman or Senator;

(2) consideration“of FBI personnel in connection
with possible future changes in FBI policies, practices, and
procedures.

If the information is of a personal nature--that is,
if it reflects upon the loyalty, character; or integrity of a
lawmaker--it is included in FBI files for the following reasons:

(1) The information may prove of value when a

- present or former Congressman or Senator is considered for

a position in the Executive or Judicial Branch of Government
which requires that the PBI conduct a background investiga-

tion of him.

(2) The information could prove of value in
solving future crimes committed against the Congressman or
Senator--or against members of that lawmaker's family.

(A person who berates and defames a lawmaker would be a
logical suspect if that lawmaker~-or another Congressman
or Senator whose views coincide with his--becomes the
target of actual or threatened violence.)

(3) The information could aid the FBI in solving
erimes committed against other persons. (For example, the
handwriting, typewriting, stationery, and/or distinctive



ann

ama

phraseology in a letter defaming a Congressman could assist
the FBI in linking the writer of that letter to a subsequent
extortion note or written bomb threat that, does not involve
any member of Congress.)

(4) The information frequently provides valuable
insight into the character, stability, and reliability of
the person who has furnished it to the FBI. Thereby, it is
of value and assistance to the FBI in future contacts with,
contacts by, or inquiries regarding, this individual.

(5) The information provides a useful administra-
tive check on the performance of FBI field offices--
particularly with regard to the important consideration of
whether they are being fully responsive to the public needs.
Supervisory personnel regularly review complaints or
allegations received from the public to insure that the

appropriate action was taken--if, in fact, action was called
for. 7

WHAT IS REQUIRED TO DESTROY FILE INFORMATION:

Barring a new law of Congress and/or receipt of a
revised FBI Records Retention Plan from the National Archives
and Records Service, the FBI cannot unilaterally undertake

the destruction of information regarding Congressmen and
Senators in its files.

This memorandum recommends that the Director raise the
question of privacy and source protection with Senators of the
Senate Select Committee (SSC) on the occasion of his anticipated
meeting in Executive Session with the SSC tentatively scheduled
for the week of 7/14/75.

By letter dated 7/9/75, Senators Frank Church and
John Tower of SSC requested the Attorney General and the
Director to appear before the Committee in Executive Session
during the week of 7/14/75. The purpose of this meeting is
discuss the matter of concern to Mr. Kelley and steps which
might be taken to expedite the response to requests for documents
essential to the Committee inquiry.

The Senstudy staff of the Intelligence Division is
preparing for the Director's use copies of each of the writtea—
requests received from SSC annotated with the dates of ow:
response to each request; the date it was delivered to the
Department; and the date it was delivered to the SSC staff.

There remains, however, a serious problem precipitated
by three recent written requests of the SSC dated 6/30/75 (received
by the Bureau on 7/7/75); 7/1/75 (received by the Bureau on
7/8/75) ; and 7/8/75 (received by the FBI on 7/9/75). Ail three
of these requests appear,in part, to disregard the privacy of
certain individuals or requests the identity of sources H ; i

Memorandum to Mr. W. R, Wanna
RE: SENSTUDY '75

In this regard, in an exchange of letters dated
3/11 and 12/75, Willian Colby in his role as the Director
of Central Intelligence, wrote to Senator Church stating .
that "I am particularly appreciative of your recognition
that certain sensitive aspects of our intelligence activities
must receive special consideration and treatment by the Select
Committee in the course of your work. As we discussed, such
| matters as the identities of our sensitive sources. ..
Hl should be protected not only from exposure, but indeed from
the risk of exposure. -We should also work together to protect
certain other information which, if improperly disclosed,
might impair the privacy rights of the individuals.”

By letter dated 3/12/75, Senator Church stated as
follows, "It is the Committee's understanding that the members
of the Committee and designated staff will have access to any
or all information which the Committee deems necessary for its
inquiry. We recognize, however, that the Committee inquiry
may touch on sensitive areas, such as the identities of CIA
personnel, sources, or cooperating organizations whose
disclosure could place persons in actual jeopardy. in the

' event that the Committee inquiry touches on such sensitive
areas, which matters we have already discussed in our meeting
of February 27, we should discuss jointly, and as you suggested
quickly, what procedures might be followed should the Committee
decide it requires more information in these specific areas."

The 6/30/75 SSC letter requests among other things,
a list of all police departments and personnel contacted
relative to a particular COINTELPRO operation; a list of all
media persons contacted in relation to this COINTELPRO and
the media affiliation.

The 7/1/75 SSC letter requests a list of all persons
outside the FBI (including, but not limited to, employees'
relatives, friendly media personnel, members of clergy,
federal, state and local law enforcement and other officials)
H contacted in relation to four persons who were subjects of

RE: SENSTUDY '75

COINTELPRO opérations. This same letter also notes that one
Morris Starsky, one of the four persons referred to above,

was made known to the FBI during a conference on 6/12/75, as

a person who would be the subject of a case study by the SSC,
This is not so. Inquiry was made of those Bureau supervisors
who attended the conference and a review of the memorandum
written following the conference was made. Neither the
memorandum nor the recollection of Bureau supervisors attending
the conferencé indicates the name Morris Starsky was mentioned
by SSC staff personnel.

The 7/8/75 SSC letter requests among other things:
(1) all memoranda and other materials which relate to a meeting
between the President and Roy Wilkins, A. Philip Randolph,
Whitney Young, Mrs. Dorothy Haight, James Farmer and Jack
Greenberg on 11/19/64; (2) a copy of a November, 1964, telegram
from Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., to Director Hoover and all
notes, memoranda, and any other materials reflecting the
disposition of, or actions taken as a result of the receipt
of, said telegram; (3) all memoranda and other materials which
relate to a meeting between the President and Dr. King on
2/9/65; (4) all other materials which relate to the transfer of
former Special Agent Robert C. Nichols to the Oklahoma Office of
the FBI in June, 1969; (5) all forms and attachments including
forms entitled "Performance Rating Guide For Investigative
Personnel," from 1959 until retirement for former Special
Agents Robert C, Nichols and Alan Sentinella.

OBSERVATION :

It would appear the above-cited requests do, in fact,
violate the privacy of individuals and possibly place in jeopardy
the identity of persons who cooperated with the FBI. Consistent
with the agreement in the exchange of letters between Colby and
Church dated 3/11 and 12/75, it is believed the Director should
raise these questions with the SSC and attempt to get relief
from the requirement of revealing the names of FBI sources or
violating the privacy of individuals. Certainly the request for .
information on former Special Agents Nichols and Sentinella goes
to the heart of the privacy issue and appears to be a blatant
disregard for their privacy.

p SUBJECT: ae

Reference is made to the Attorney General's letter, ahs
July 16, 1975, captioned as above, requesting information i
relating to the collection, analysis, use, and dissemination Lf
of organized crime intelligence.

On June 25, 1974, the Director testified before
the FBI Oversight Subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary -
Committee that the Bureau has "no statutory authority to
collect intelligence per se" but that it operates under the
general umbrella of 28 U.S.C. 533 (3), which authorizes the
Attorney General to appoint officials “to conduct...investiga~
tions regarding official matters...as may be directed by the
Attorney General." A listing of any directives issued by
the Department or the Attorney General with respect to organized
erime should be available in the office of the Assistant
Attorney General, Criminal Division, Department of Justice.

With respect to the FBI, all our investigations in
the organized crime field are aimed at one ultimate objective:

prosecution. & Pal
A Whe GI

During the course of our westigation of individual
hoodiums and the various criminal syndicates operating through-
out the United States, we naturally acquire considerable data
regarding the structure of the organized underworld, the
identities of its principal leaders, the extent of its in-
fluence, its primary sources of income, its payoffs to corrupt
officials, and the operations of its vast commenteations—networks.

Memorandum to Mr. Cleveland

Re: United States Senate Select Committee
To Study Governmental Operations With
Respect to Intelligence Activities

Most of this information is obtained from paid
informants, from other law enforcement officers, from alert
citizens, and from court-approved electronic surveillances
installed under the provisions of Title III of the Omnibus
‘Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968.

None of it, however, is intelligence for intelligence's
sake. The experience of the FBI over the years has shown that
criminal syndicates exist for the sole purpose of conducting
illegal operations and that anyone belonging to them may
reasonably be presumed to be engaged in one or more of these
activities. Therefore, our investigations of the organized
underworld are not aimed at developing general nonspecific
data but at establishing which criminal violations its members
are engaged in and then proving these violations in a court
of law.

Obviousiy, not every case opened, every lead followed,
or every bit of information received is going to wind up in
Federal court. On the contrary, much of this material relates
to offenses outside the investigative jurisdiction of the
FBI. When such is the case, we immediately disseminate the
inférmation. to the appropriate Federal, state, or local agency.
As a result, information uncovered by the FBI during the past
five years alone has enabled the recipient agencies to make
more than 17,000 organized crime arrests; confiscate over
$151,000,000 worth of illicit drugs and narcotics, $9,000,000
worth of cash, property, weapons, and wagering paraphernalia,
and $6,000,000 worth of counterfeit bills; and assess tax
liens against $19,000,000 worth of property arising out of
Federal gambling cases.

In addition, a considerable portion of the organized
crime intelligence information developed by the FBI is for-
warded to thé various Federal Strike Forces coordinating
racket investigations throughout the country and to the
Criminal Division of the Department, which has entered this
information in its computerized data bank called “Racketéer
Profile.*

is in general conformity. with the proposed agreement concerning this matter

new agreement allowed for the taking of notes on these documents which

notes may be taken to the Senate Select Committee offices. In fact,

RE: SENSTUDY 75
62~116395

CIA item described as Project WESTPOINTER apparently
involved the examination of mail to the U.S, from Mainland
China during certain specific months of 1969, 1970 and 1971.
CIA indicated that Project WESTPOINTER was similar to Project
SRPOINTER. FBIHQ COMMENT: Our files contain no information
concerning Project WESTPOINTER. Memorandum from Acting
Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, dated 4/1/75,
captioned "Jane Fonda v. L. Patrick Gray, et al.; Civil Action
No. 73-2442-MML (C.D. Cal.)," describes a CIA covert operation
known as SRPOINTER which involved examination of mail to and
from the Soviet Union which was discontinued in 2/73.
Apparently, CIA had examined certain mail addressed to Jane
Fonda in connection with its SRPOINTER activity. While we
were not aware of CIA's Project WESTPOINTER, it is noted that
this Bureau did periodically examine mail coming from the
People's Republic of China (PRC) and Hong Kong to the U.S.
and mail from the U.S. to the PRC and Hong Kong during the
period 1956-1966. This activity, which was permanently dis-
continued 1/24/66, was carried under the code names CHIPROP
and CHICLET, Public disclosure of the CIA item referred to
above as Project WESTPOINTER might lead to a more detailed
public examination of this Bureau's periodic control of mail
in the CHIPROP and CHICLET operations.

ACTION:
For information in connection with Senstudy 75.

ACCESS TO WITNESSES ~~

At 11:40 a.m. on July 18, 1975, K. William O’Connor,
Special Counsel in the Deputy Attorney General’s Office, telephonically
advised me that his negotiations with the Committee concerning more
restrictive limitations on Committee agcess to witnesses were not
successful. He said that the Department has determined that the
procedure in effect previously whereby the FBI Director would receive
a request for the availability of FBI personnel for interview and would
determine whether such personnel should be released from applicable AA.
secrecy agreements would be reinstituted. =<

| NN I asked Mr. O’Connor whether this meant that the Department
no longer regarded all requests for interview of present or former employees
as “demand” situations requiring the specific authorization of the Department
as if a subpoena had been issued. Mr. O’Connor said that the Department
‘would not consider such requests in that manner and that the FBI should
[ake all determinations necessary for the appearance of witnesses for

interview.

For information. We will continue to discuss requests for
interview with individuals named by the Committee.in their requests,
and authorize waivers of the secrecy agreements of a case-by-case

ALLEGATION BY JOnNEEEEF CONCERNING

Telephone Rm. —
Ditactor Sac'y —_

At 5:14 p.m., on 6/27/75, K. William O'Connor, Special
Counsel for Intelligence Coordination, advised me that he had received
a call from John Elliff of the Senate Select Committee complaining of
what he described as an attempt to interferewith the Committee's investi-
gation by supplying information to the press that the Committee had been
furnished material which it had declined to use or to inquire into because
of its sensitive nature. O'Connor said that Elliff claimed that a journalist
who is friendly with the Committee had advised the Committee that he had
information from a Justice Department official that the Committee had been aaa
furnished information originating in the FBI that Communist funds were aa
used to financé Martin Luther King; that King had been related to the CP, USA
and that the Senate Select Committee had treated this matter as a "hot potato”
and that the information also indicdted that "King laughed ali the way to the
bank."

O'Connor said that Elliff protested the apparent disclosures
by the Justice Department bt the press and claimed that it appeared an
effort was being made to interferewith the Committee's work. O'Connor
told Elliff he had no knowledge of anyone in the Justice Department furnishing
any such information to the press and further, he told him that he did not
believe that information concerning CP funding of King had been furnished

to the Committee. ee At erate GQ. 16 846- / \

O'Connor said that he did not believe that ¢ ak t eer ea furnished
such information to the news media but he wanted us«tesbe-aware-ofsElliff's
complaint. O'Connor said that it is possible that during interviews conducted
by staff of the Committee, they have received statements indicating that
Communist funds were used by King, but he does not believe that any docu-
mentation of that has been furnished to the Committee as yet. ] |

ADDENDUM ca INTELLIGENCE DIVISION SFP:lhb 7/2175

INID has received no report .or has any information
concerning the alleged leak referred to in this memorandum,

Concerning #2 the allegation in this memorandum
that information originated with the FBI that communist
funds were used to finance Martin Luther King, Jr., and that
King had been "related" to the CPUSA, the following is noted. 4
We have never had any information that communist furids, :
{ literally, were used to finance King. We did have reliable
| reports that King was helped in a financial way, particularly
as to advice regarding fund raising, by a close advisor,
Stanley David Levison, who was a secret member of the CPUSA.
However, none of our reports are known to have claimed that
| "communist funds" were financing King. King was: never known
to have been a member of the CPUSA. It is true that he had
| a number of close associates such as Levison who at the time
| were either current or past CPUSA members.

INID is unable to pinpoint the report that "King |
laughed all the way to the bank." |
