2 Information Received from AM3IDDY=1
i CAA - TERNS ™

REFERENCE: (A) HNMA-U315, 17 April 1969
(B) HNMA+U32, 1 May 1969

ls Attached (USC) for the information of Headquarters is a
sory of a memorandum prepared for the LNPURE Chief on 12 May 1963.
This mezorandum sets forth information rece: ved that day by the
COS from AMBIDDY-1 who is considering going into a dry dock venture
in Corinto with Jose Maria ZELAYA, private secretary to President
Somoza. ZELAYA has cabinet rank. He is believed by many to
pro-Communist. although, as in the caze of similar reports about
Francisco J. LAINEZ, no real proof of these allegations seems to
be produced.

2. When shown this memorandum, the LNPURE Chief said he
thought it quite likely that ZELAYA is strongly anti-American
as reported by AMBIDDY.

3. AMBIDDY says that for the first time he recently heard
Somoza utter unfavorable words about the United States and
AMBIDDY “wondered” to the COS if ZELAYA could be exerting some
evil influence on Somoza.

&, ‘The Station will seek to draw AMBIDDY out at length.on
this matter at anqpportune.time. E

The Ambassador 12 May 1969

Political Attaché
Statements of Jose Maria “Chema” ZELAYA

1, % 12 May I was contacted by a close friend of mine
who is engagec in negotiations with "Chema" ZELAYA which :
way lead to the twe forming a business partnership. ‘hile ig
source is not nurmally a source of intelligence informa-
tion, I found him to be a good observer and to be
reliable. told me that ZELAYA told him the following
_ at a meeting on 9 May. : 7

+ 2. The ROCKEFCLLER visit is merely a political maneuver :
_ on the part of President NIXON to furnish an excuse if :
anything goes wrong in Latin America. It is preposterous . as

to expect Governor ROCKEFELIER to learn anything about a Z 7
count: in twenty four hours. ROCKEFELLER will go back to i
the United States, make his report to NIXON, and then go about :
his.normal duties, NIXON will adopt those recommendations
vegarding U.S. policy for Latin America that are agreeable

| to him, paying no attention to the rest. If anything goes

| wrong, NIXON can pin the blame on ROCKEFELLER. In this way
he has a scapegoat and also has an opportunity to lessen the
prestige of a potential political rival. wo possible good can
come from this mission.

3. ZELAYA said that he has managed to obtain the blessing
(bendicién) of the Catholic Church. Now he is working on
the blessing of the American Ambassador. In this respect he.
' has proposed setting up youth centers around the country--
places where youngsters can go to read pood books, play
. ping pong, etc. -- and the American Ambassador is interested.

4. My friend is: of ths opinion that ZELAYA is strongly
anti-American. |

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD :
SUBJECT: Manuel ARTIME Buesa i

le On 18 April I saw Subject again briefly and

told him that I would appreciate an opportunity to talk

to him alone. As he about to ve town, he

promised to contact me again on his next trip to Managuae
jo phoned me on 28 April. I picked him up that night

and drove him up to my house where we hada long conversa-"
tion over a couple of steaks and a good bottle of wine.

2. .I told Subject that I had heard his. name mentioned
in connection with such unsavory activity as fomenting
revolution in Panama and ‘coties trafficking--from people |
wo don't know him. My reply to any such dirty-mouthing

z is that Subject is a hype: tive type who keeps in contact

- with all sorts of peopl 8 of whom may be involved in
unsavory activity. This does not. mean Subject is involved: ~
Indeed, I was sure he was not.

3, The provocation yielded desired results and in.
the ensuing conversation Subject g: me a detailed
explanation of his. present activities and financial eituaticr,

&. His business dealings are carried on under his .

company, known as Central. South International, Inc. He is:
sident and his wife is secretary. His business activity
Nicaragua consists of ¢ : :

a. Sales of equipment to the National Guard

i oe 7 ®, Sales of Livestock (cows) to Nicaragua. These

: vt dealings are handled ghoough Celene) Guillermo
NOGUERA, the buys: at this end, Subject
expects to expand this business to inelude sales’
to INFONAC--tne Naticral Development Commission.

Subject obtaine the livestock from thi
Montura Ranch of Florida. .
ec. Sales of Florida realestate.
Subject is not licensed to nake such sales
in the U.S. but can sell to persons abroad.
(About two years ago he was selling lots
‘west of Miami near where a new airport is
to be built.)

S$. Subject is now involved--on thie tripe-in a deal
with President SOMOZA to furnish well drilling and pumping
equipment for an agricultural irrigation syatem., SOMOZA
was approached. by a British firm which somehow wangled a U.S.-

nteed § 1/2 percent loan.to underwrite the same scheme.
inte tow interest was better than Sudject's contacts could
obtain initially and it appeared that the contract would
go to the British outfit. However, Subject's stateside
partner, a South Carolina legislator (atate leval), who

rates a business known as INTERGROW, managed to swing

e same deal ard was due in town on 28 April to talk with
SOMOZA. SOMOZA told Subject he would give the business to
Subject if he and his ZNTERGROW friend could equal the British
offer. As of 28 April prospects for conaumation of a deal

6. Subject is also trying to work out a deal with
SOMOZA regarding export of Nicaraguan meat, Previous
dealings with a man from S6&W fell through when thie chap
tried to "go around" Subject by dealing direct with Nicaraguan
meat exporters. At present Subject ia dealing with SOMOZA
to buy meat from CARNIC and IFAGAN to 9@11 in Miami to
the Northwestern Meat Company, owned by Elpidio NUNEZ. In
his cooperation in the meat business, SOMOZA is
38% slice of the profita, The remainder would
be split up as follows: 16% to Edgarda BUTTARI, 13% to
CONDOM, and 334 to Subject. SOMOZA is trying to
figure ouc some way to get his bite without paying U.S.
income taxes so the matter of spreacing the profits is still
i up in the air. Central South International ine. has an
| account at the Capital National Bank of Miami; Subject showed
i" | 7 ma an irrevocable letter of credit in the amount of $48,000

iseued by this bank to be used for the meat export deal.

7. As for possible sales of cattle to INFONAC,
Subject is working on a deal with SOMOZA which may
involve as much as a million and a half dollars.

8. Subject lives on commissions. He is now in
debt to the tune of $9,500 of which he owes $1,600 to
American Express and $3,9C0 to SOMOZA. When he has been
down and out three persons have helped him with handouts
of money to tide him over. These are Sixto MESA, in
the construction business in Miami; Jose Luis GONZALEZ,
in the lumber business; and "Tacho" SOMOZA. Subject plans
to pay back all three every cent they have given him.
considers these handouts as loans. He is now trying
to consolidate his debts through a loan from Diners Club.
He is paying on his home mortgage at a rate of 5S 3/4 percent,
quite low by present-day standards. Two Cuban Negro friends
of many-years standing live with him his home. . They
are taxi drivers and each pays $25 a week to help defray

ld costs. One of these loyal retainers fired the

hot during the Pilon s' iy mill raid pulled off by
Subject's followers several years ago.

9. Contrary to popular belief, Subject does not own
@ piece of the Vizcaya restaurant in Miami although he
could een a partner had he made a $500 investment
when the enterprise began. The owners are Oscar VILA,
Aramis PINON, and the cook, named Tom&s (lnu). VILA
and PINON were with Subject in the Bay of Pigs invasion
and both are old friends. VILA has been rumored involved
in narcotics but Subject doesn't think he is. Some time
ago the Miami Herald sent its lady gourmet reporter to do a
story on the Vizcaya. She found it to her liking and wrote
a favorable story But some unidentified character at the
Herald told her that narcotics were pushed at the Vizcaya
and that Subject was one of the-owners. Publisher KNIGHT
of the Herald had an investigation run before allowing the
gourmet reporter's story to be printed. The restaurant
was given a clean bill of health and the story was run.

26. One of the persons most prominently involved in
baackening Subject's name is Rolando MASFERRER. Subject
classifies him as the scum of Batista's Cuba. One gets the
impression that Subject would be unhappy if MASFERRER, who
Subject says has been involvad in narcotics trafficking,
were to say anything good about him.

\

ewe mes



ll. Subject's. only other possible connection with
narcotics involves a report he gave to Mr. DREW of the
FBI. This was as follows: Subject has a friend naned

petom :
SECRET :

ohn

—.

Carlos ARMAS who is skipper of a shrimp boat the “Sea
Cat". ARMAS lives at 1800 NW 34th Street, Miami. At sea
in British waters (around some British island or cay in the

Caribbean).

ARMAS ‘has "fraternized” with a Cuban shrinver

“El Costero” captained by Antonio LOPEZ. LOPEZ has told
ARMAS that his boat,"E£l Costero", often carries aboard a
emall, very fast speedboat. while anchored in 5ritish waters
this speedboat, with a crew of 3, is put overboard with a
“package" on board. It disappears only to return sometime
later minus the package but with large quantities of monay.
It then refuels from "El Costero" and heads for Cuba on its
own power. Subject and ARMAS think it probable that the |
package contains narcotics and that Fidel CASTRO is raising
Money this way. Mr. DREW of the FBI told Subject to tell
his story to the Coast Guard, Subject did but the CG said
they were not interested because the smuggling was taking
place in British waters. As far as Subject knows nothing has 1
ever been done about this. matter.

22. Subject says that "politically" his program breaks
to:

be

Keeping’ about 200° men ("my action men") ready
fer action in case of a sudden change in Cuba
or a “go ahead” on raids against Cuba.

Keeping on good terms with Edgardo. BUTTARI and-
Frank CONDOM who are both on good terms with
“Bebe” REBOZO who is in turn, an intimate
friend of President NIXON. (Subject asked me
not to discuss or report this owing to its
political sensitivity. It would seem prudent
not to accentuzte this matter).

Keeping good relations with Nicaragua and
peed for possisle future operations against
ae

13, I asked Subject if he had any dealings with Scicnoi
Angel ARAUZ of Panama in connection with efforts to cverthrow
the government of Panama, He said that ARAUZ had tried to
get him, Subject, to furnish arms, support, and influential



=5e

friends in the Miami area, Subject successfully avoided
ARAUZ when he showed up in Miami, ARAUZ, ig now. in Venezuela
where his wife's family is well co:

nected with the COPEL
Subject is not in contact with ARAUZ

Throughout our conversation Subject appeared
sincere and anxious to wake the facts known. He. repeatedly
stressed his respect for our organization as he has in the
past. I believe he was being forthright and honest. He
Promised to keep in touch. .

REFERENCE: FBI Report of 30 January 1969

The Station has seen a copy of an FBI report of 30 January
1969, concerning AMBIDDY-1, which indicates, among other
things, that AMBIDDY reportedly claimed to have arranged an.
interview with Mr. Richard NIXON at the time the latter was a
presidential candidate. Since the content 2nd tone of this

FBI report differ somewhat from what the COS, Managua, has
learned in direct talks with AMBIDDY-1, there is attached

(USC) a memorandum from the COS setting forth observations
resulting from meetings with AMBIDDY in Managua.

17 April 1969

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Manuel ARTIME Buesa

1. ARTIME comes to Managua frequently, always using
LANICA Airliner and frequently flying over Cuba. He is
aware of the pugsibility of a highjacxing and says that he
would never make it out of the Havana airport alive if
the CASTRO Government were to get hold of him.

2.° He explains his trips as legitimate business.
One of his enterprises lies in obtaining fatigue uniforms,
eanteens, web gear, and similar equipment and supplies
for the Nicaraguan National Guard. Another enterprise,
in which he was involved a year or so ago, involved lumber
and cabinet woods which he hoped to export from Nicaragua
to the States. He dealt with a Nicaraguan businessman
named MOLINA in this matter. It seems to have fallen through.
At one point last year (1968) I heard that ARTIME was trying
to serve as middleman for investments by KRUPP interests in
Germany here, I have heard no more about this. A more
recent line is Nicaraguan beef. for export to the States.
He says that he has made contact with the top man of the
8 & W restaurants in the States, This man, after checking
samples of Nicaraguan beef, says he will buy ali-he can get.
The supplier at thi end would be CARNIC, a meat- packing
enterprise owned. by President SOMOZA. . (There is. no doubt
ARTIME could find a ready market in the States but he may
be stymied by the import quotas, especially since Nicaragua
ever-exported to the States in 1968 and had troubles as a
result. 7

a. ARTIME drops by to see me at ny home often although
“ not on every trip. His vidits to me hava basa less frequent

He is usually accompanied by Jose FERNANDEZ de la Torre,
Manager of Distribuidora Inter-Americana, S. A. “Pepe” i
is a Cuban and a close friend of nine. ‘ie is ARTIHE's . i
elesest friend in Nicaragua. ARTIME often stays at his
home. On a couple of occasions APTIME has been by to
see me with another mutual Cuban friend, Primitivo :
ABLANEDO,who used to live at £1 Bluff on the Last Coast. }
"El Gallego" ABLANEDO new lives in Managua'and makes his :
living renting out dump trucks and construction and hauling t
equipment. On one occasion ARTIME came by with a Cuban I
believe was named, VILA. Mirta PADRON, another mutual i
Cuban friend (she teaches Spanish at the American Embassy) |
i

tells me that VILA owns a restaurant in Miami but that
ARTIME has no. connection with this enterprise. A couple
of times ARTIME.has come by with Frank CONDOM, @& short,
uiet, red-faced Cuban who owns some jewelry stores in
Riani? CONDOM is now pretty well-off financially and is
a@ good friend and business associate of "Bebe" REBOZO,
who, in turn, is a close friend of President NIXON. - I

believe CONDOM and, perhaps REBOZO, may be involved in the
meat deal.

%.. ARTIME always comes with sorsone when he visits
Menenot because he feels need for a bodyguard as some
suspect, but simply because he still doesn't know how to
drive a car and I live some distance out of town. Our
‘visite are pleasant, involve a scotch or two at most.

The last two times ARTIME.has not had anything. to drink.

We talk no operations or other such business. My‘ personal
views on dealing with CASTRO, especially on howwe should
have dealt with him in the pagat, are rather hawkish and I
think ARTIME finds these views pleasant to his ear although
he is well aware that they are not "policy," i

&. ARTIME told me some months ago--before the elections--
of meeting with "Bebe" REBOZO, The meeting was arranged
through CONDOM, ARTIME has not claimed to me to have met with
Mr, NIXON either before or after he assumed the presidency.
He has made it known a6 is already well known, that REBCZO
is close to the President. ile nas aiso speculated that

to we more hard-line out has-not specifically said that
RE30Z0 has said this would be so. He recently told me

that ome of my ideas on enforcing the economic blockade
had been passed on to REBOZO.

6. In response to my queries as to what direction
the new Cuba policy might take, ARTIME said in Marcn 1969
that he did not expect the NIXON administration to address
itself to the Cuban problem before ‘ay of this year.
Then he expects a concerted effort to make the economic
blockade work. If that does not yield results, he expects
that a go-ahead will be given for the resumption of Cuban
exile raids against Cuba from non-U.S. bases. He hope? to
be the man chosen to lead in this endeavor. Again, in
response to my questions, he said that exiles could be
trained in Nicaragua. le favors using Haiti_as the actual
base of operations, i.e., the paiding parties would lea
from there. He mentioned having talked with President
DUVALIER and indicated that he has DUVALIER's approval for

such operations.

: 7. ARTIME said that operations against Cuba would be
@esigned to knock out shipping and port facilities. .He

has not recently referred to his earlier invasion plan

as outlined in MANAGUA 6752 of 23 October 1968.

8. ARTIME is still as charming ao ever, lot's of fun
‘to ‘be around socially--full of jokes, anecdotes, etc.
Be has not lost faith, is one of the few of what have been.
termed slsewhere "the old exile hacks" who have not given
up. He really does seem determined to play a leading role
in unseating CASTRO. he is beginning to. go to fat a bit.
I saw him in a bathing suit not long ago-and thought that
hhe would do well 'to get into trim if he hopes to lead in

any military operation.

. ARTIME has never made any discernable efforts to
secrets from.me; indeed, he sewiss to have taken special
not to do so. He is mature and quite objective--car |

gee various facets to just about any problem. I believe

it is well worthwhile Maintaining occasional contact with

© Current Rumors in PBRUMEN Exile Community
J ACTION REQUIRED - REFERENCES

1. As usual the first month of 1969 featured a large number of rumors
making the rounds in the PBRUMEN exile commmity. While we normally tend
to ignore such rumors, we are forwarding a couple of tidbits because they
Felate to GPVALIANT.

2. The first of these rumors deals with a_new group which has pre-
sumably been formed for the purpose of trying to dea) through GPVALIANT,
Among those in the group are Carlos Prio, Lincoln Rodon, Juan J. Remos,
Sergio Carbo, and Edgardo Butari. This group reportedly meets every Thurs-
day at different houses: The last meeting in January was held at the home
of Lincoln Rodon. At this meeting Prio presumably stated that Butari was
a better contact to GPVALIANT than is Emilio Nunez Portuando. The general
consensus was that Butari is a better contact because he is a business
partner of Bebe Roboso and everyone knows Reboso's influence with GPVALIANT..
The rumor mill has it that the group intends to pretend that it Savors
political and democratic. solutions to the PBRUMEN problem but that they
really seck armed intervention. In this same connection Father 0'Farril
has recently told AMPALM-4 that AMBIDDY-1 is once more connected with WOFIRM
and that AMCORE-2 has joined him.. The rumor mill says. further that AMBIDDY-1
‘and AMCORE-2 are planning to open training camps once again with the tacit

+ encouragement of the-above group. According to AMPALM-4 O'Farril himself
does not agree with the version of AMBIDDY-2 and AMCORE-2 wanting to estab-
lish training camps. O'Farril feels that the solution AMBIDDY-1 is looking
for is through agreements between LNFORT (GPVALIANT) and the Soviet Union.

3. WIBALDA has picked up information quite similar to that learned ~
through AMPALM-4. He also has reported the existence of this group and
said that they are collecting money from the refugees in order to buy arms
‘and equipment to ovezitrow AMTHUG-1. According to WIBALDA important mem~
bers of Aipha-66, Segundo Frente, DRE, Autenticor, and Ortodoxos are in-
volved even though these organizations themselves are not participating

+ gs groups in the movewnt. en

4. Another rumor has it that AMOTEK-59 is also conspiring in
plans for future arned action against PBRUMEN.

S. The sbove information is being forwarded strictly as unfounded
and unconfirmed rumors. he are passing it along only because it represeats
another indication of what the exiles are expecting from GPVALIAST. We
find the rumor concerning AMBIDOY-1 particularly interesting and suspect
that it may be an outgrowth of the recent report we. have received froa
AMCHALK-1 that AMBIDDY-1 has been contacted by ACSI.

3. Both ZABOTH and the Chief of Station have discussed
with AMBIDDY-1 the “intelligence net" mentioned by the reference.
The stated Station position was "we are happy to maintain con-
tact with you and to discuss this matter from time te.time on an
informal and personal basis, but the policy of our organization
ds that we do not engage in intelligence activities in a friendly
country except in coordination with the local government.
Therefore, even though you aseure us that General SONOZA knowa
and approves this activity, we would have to have a direct re-
quest from him before we could cooperate with you in any kind
of an official mpacity." ‘This appears to. have sufficied to keep
our lines open to those involved without committing ua to de
anything more than listen,

MIAMI, 24 April 1967-

Dear Jin,

Pardoa ay lateiess in writing to you but I have had to face
many problems and I wanted to be cals when I wrote to you,

Twas at Luis Somoza’s funeral and I think that I made a good
dmpression, I am at present nore worried than I was before, but not
for my future, because Tacho is a very good friend of mine end Luis
Was not. I am worried about Nicaragua's destiny, Let us tut
forget that Nicaragua is the most solid pillar of Central america.
JeLaines grev closer to Tacho during the funeral, Laines took
Practically all the loadd@ the funeral arrangements upon himself,
S-Many of the good men who gave the Somoza's advice were intimate

“friends of Luis and they are afraid of coming to Tacho in order to

Give him advice.

3-The Communists are aware of this and they are also aware of the
fact that Tacho ts even scre violent than Luis, therefore, they take
pavantage of the situation to provoke Tacho, thereby hoping that

Without Luis's advisors and possibly with the "bad advice" of "an
he will begin

“ gugaitrator™ in Tacho's circle of friends/to rule his government

with an iron hand, which is just what tho Communists want from hia.
So ee

eythiag gossibic tc ese that b Fo Cale: it
S-There is no doubt about the fact that the ts have brocght
in a great quantity ‘of weapons into Nicaragua, The Weapons have
not been found, in spite cf the investigations by the Security Corpa;
even General Montiel recognizes this.

G-Ithink that there is discontent in the young cfficer's ranks

" because of the low salaries which the officia)s, sub-officisls and
"| (UMGXXHXE enlisted men receive. This is Rot a problem at tho present



but it could develop into a problem, if the Communists exploit

it skillfully.

T-I also think that the Security Corps which continues to function
under the orders of Montiel, who is also chief of Staff and also
® merchant, loses all its efficiency because of the fect that Montiel
Cannot dedicate sufficient time to the Corps and as a result leaves
its direction to Captain Willop, who I think is entirely incompetent i ‘
for the job. AHA

8-1 think that the only good thing that panorama has is the loyalty
of General Sonoza'es military troops, for I honestly do not trust
gone of the high officials.

t

S-Jose Fernandes made the contact with the Nicaraguan gir) who

received the proposition to study on a scholarship in Russia, at 7

the Patricio Lumumba University, and she is willing to collaborate

with us. I gave the contact to Carlos.

Le-according ‘to reports from Pepe Fernandes the "comrades" are

going to try to intensify their '"infiltrative job" in the Kicaraguan ~~
departmenteEXX of Education and Agrarian reform.

The following is expected after 2 May, the day on which Tacho is

sworn in: sabotage, terrorism, and kidnappings. Provocations!
1l-I sincerely think, and excuse ue, that the United States should

rate ee OBE EDR CRIN a oe ==

now, due i. the psychological state in which Tacho is in, demonstrate
+ that they have confidence in him XXHH and in the success of his

Government, He is grateful to the United States for the help
which the United States sent to nim fo that he could save his :
brother, therefore take advantage of thia. i
12-According to the comments which I heurd in Tacho's close circles
(Col, Sanchez from Lanicn,. Gen, Camilo Gonzalez, eto), Sevilla Sacasa i
ia not in very good standing with ‘acho. I think that Washington
should become friendly with Tacho in a dirsot manner.

1g-Caintlo Gonzalez's son spoke to me and told me that, he had to sce
me later (I do not know when) in order to inform me about a group of
Guatemalan Officials who are planning a coup d'etat against Mendez i
Montenegro and they want my help. When I know something concrete
about this I will tell you. I have also heard rumors from Teo : ,
"Carrasco (a painter, who is the brother YEXX of General Peralta’s 5
paramour) that Peralta is “in something also." When I find out

MIAMI; 3 April 1967 +

Dear Jin,

Pardon wy lateness in writing, but I have had to run around

a lot, The fundamental subjects which I wished to discuss
are

1. I was displeased when our Nicaraguan friend discussed
the subject of the implements which we had in Blueffield

with General Somoza before I had discussed anything with

him (Genral Somoza); above all without even consulting
with me before he went ahead and did it, this put me in
a difficult. position with the Government. This is what I
discussed with Carlos: .

(a) ‘The com bo ida oer OEE () Iwill
tell Somoza eehy We te (c) I move them to
enother place which is less accessible. - le agreed with
me on consulting with the company, and the answer he gave
to (b) wi
Somoza, and nothing else was said, Thank God tmt I did

only thing that worries me is the extraordinary influence

that "Che Lainez" has on him in economics. There are

diverse conentaries about this individual on whether he is

(I know him Personally) that he is a social outcast,

Furthermore, when

5. I think that we can expect violent revolts in Nicaragua,

I do not think that Almeida has the control nor the .

influence over the Army that Raul had, and therefore a i
conspiracy and revolt of the Armed Forces is easier, f
There is no doubt ti.at Fidel is assigning key posts to
men and women who are his personal friends, without
regard to whethsr they are good or bad Communists. This
is going to bring ab:ut problems with the old guard of the

Communist Party and with the people in the new guard who have

been hastily taught Fidel's doctrine but have received
AGommunist indoctrination (many of them sympathize with Raul).
It seems that Russia is very displeased with Fidel and
it would not surprise me if Russia would try to cause an
attack on him; we should inaiauate this in the propaganda
against Castro for we know that his paranoic mentality and
his @isgust for Russia would wost emphatical ly make him :

Dear Jim:
wie Just a few lines to report the following:

73, U believe that Communism will concentrate on Nicaragua as

@ point of attack.
7 2. The men who have returned-to Nicaragua after receiving
i training ‘in Cuba only acted indirectly in the bloody events
of the 22nd, because according to information gathered in
Micaragua through “Pepe Fernandez," the “gandinistaa” couzunists
(aho follow the Castro line) were avaiting the assassination
“= --" 9@ the Somcza in Leon and this was never realized (carried
cut). These men were expecting an outbreak before-Tacho
Bomoza took over the Preside:y of the Republic.
ts z a structuring (butlding) an anticommunist intelligence ~
net in Nicaragua, which I have begun to instruct (train).
This net is composed of: Jose Ferndndez ("Pepe" Ferndndez)
Manager of Casa Hook. Rodolfo Jerez, Owner of casa "Venus."
Capitalist of various enterprises. ; :
Orlando Castrillo - Studies law, 5th year (5?) year of age
He has a grocery (foodstuffs) business.
Duilio Cabrera - Studies law, 4th year. Works in the Ministry
of Agriculture, in the Department of Live Stock. He is 25

years old.



Roberto Arellano ~ Studies law, 5th year, He works in the
National Palace. Department of (Providad?). It is a position

related to employees and workers. He is 26 years of a

Roberto Arias - Studies law, 6th year. Owner of an auto~
mobile spare parts business.

{These individuals are going to create an anticommun'st
intelligence net. I have already given them one week of
conferences.

4. According to reports received by Pepe, a Nicaraguan named
Gustavo Gomez Mesa, acquired through various subjects (persons),
about $5,000.00 in arms in Miami, from the Tamiami Gun Shop.
‘The money was contributed by Aguirre, the owner of "Diario

de las Americas" (and director), through an individual named
Germén Arellano. These arms were going to be infiltrated into
Bicaragua in emall quantities at a time.

"§. Teday I received from Adolfo Jiménez (old chief of the

Camp “Francisco” of communications, of Costa Rica) the pro-

i‘ position to ask Nicaragua for permision to launch: the invasion
_' from there to Haiti. Accord:.ag-to him thers is a-grouz of

-, Capitalists in New York who are willing to send from Europe

* gbout $80,000.00 in arms, to any designated locxtion in

‘Wicaregua. I am attempting to find out the names of these
capitalists so that I can report it. I have. replied that 1

seating it te Nicaragua. Of course, I will not get involved

in thie adventure unless you desire the contrary.

SUBJECT: O Termination of Manuel Artine Buesa a
- pallaomaow
© of ba }

1 On the night of i3 dJqanuary 1967 the writer using
the operational alias James ilson met with Artime in a
room in the Hotel Columbus in Miami, Florida. The purpose
of the meeting was to formally terminate Artime's association
with the Agency, This involved the obtaining of termination
Secrecy Oath and Quit Claim, the payment of $3,000 to cover

the final periodical payment through 31 December 1966 and
obtaining outstanding receipts,

2. The meetin; cordial and all paper work involved
in the proceedings was accomplished without incident. There
was of course the expected lengthy discussion on what he had
done (or tried to do) for the Agency in the past and an un-
doubtedly sincere effort to impress upon me that he was ready

and willing for any task he might be called upon to do in
the future.

3. Artime made only one request--a rather passionate
one--for financial assistance for the immediate family members
of two Movement for the Recuperation of the Revolution (MRR)
members who were executed #s the result of operational missions
to Cuba and the wife of anviher who is serving a 30-year
sentence. (It will be recalled that Artime has been furnishing
receipts for the $3,000 he has been receiving in. recent months 2
claiming that the money goes to the families of MRR members FE
who have lost their lives or been imprisoned while on MRR
missions.) We are examining these. three c:
will arrange for financial benefits under t!
martyrs" section of the AMBUD activity.

and a P.O. box address in Weaht

7: maintaining a lecss contact

y teiephone or correspondence
f he had any items of interest to pass along and was assured

that if ho ever haa any “new" ideas, if he put them in writing,
. they would be studied. It was, however, made very clear to
him that his formal association with the Agency was terminated :

and that there was no prospect of any financial assistance i:

2. AMBIDDY-1 gave the following infornation to James De.
ZABOTH! in Managua on 15 December 1966 and was told to pass
it on to his ileadquarters contact for proper handling and
distribution. This report is forwarded as a follow-up in
case the information failed to ret into proper channels, as
it has a direct connection with Reference A and is a sequel
to Reference 3.

. 2. Between 7 and 13 December 1966, AMBIDDY-1 talked
three times with Frank MARSHALL, at the latter's request.
MARSHALL first called AMSINDY-1 and-asked if they could meet
at MARSHALL's office to talk about the possibility of MARSHALL
investing in the business proposition in which AMSIDDY-1 was.
involved. (A concession for a commercial record player with
a@ television type screen on which scenes are displayed which
are supposed to be synchronized with the music.) After two '
Such meetings, which AMHIDDY-1 described az “get-acquainted®
and "feeling-out" sessions (the two men had never met in per~ i
ton previously), MARSHALL asked if he could visit AMSIDDY-1 :
privately in his hotel room, They met on 12 December 1966 at
AMBIDDY-1's suite in the Gran ilotel in San Jose. i

3.. HAKSHALL said he knew AMSIDDY-1 had some waapons.
AMBIDDY-1 replied that tne weapons in ‘iicarazua had been
given tc. the “icaraguan Governzent, Dut MARSHALL continued
to press the point, saying he knew there were otners.
AMBIDDY-1 at last reluctantly adsitted that he dic have 2.6
few more scattered around under tight security (ne says this
is not true, in fact), but indicated that he had other plans
for their use. MAXSHAL! sais he aid nor care where they
were or what they cost, he would buy them. AMBIDDY-1 asked
him why he wanted weapons so badly, and! MARSHALL replied that
he was always in the sarket for weapons, _AMBIDDY-1 said he
was aware of that fact, but this did not sound like just
another routine business deal. He went on to say that he
would not even consider releasing any of his arms without
knowing where they were going and for what use, and that he
had heard that MARSHALL had sold weapons previously to the
Communists. He would have nothing to do with su-h an opera=
tion, regardless of any possible profit in it. He tried to
elicit as much information as possible, but got very little.
MARSHALL said they had a common friend in General SOMOZA, to |

which AMBIDDY-1 replied that this was fairly recent as SONOZA
and MARSHALL had been bitter enemies up until about the last
- three years. AMBIDDY-1 said he had to know how many arms
were wanted, when, where, and for what purpose. MARSHALL said
he wanted all he could get, as soon as possible, in Costa Rica,
and the reason was that he knew a coup was being prepared and
he wanted to get hia own people ready in time. ‘AMBIDDY-1 said
he would have to think about the proposition and would give
him an answer in about three weeks. (He intends to stall and
make no commitments, hoping to draw out more information. He “:
will not agree to sell any arms.)

&. On 7 December 1966, AMBIDDY-1 talked with Daniel
ODUBER at the latter's office. ODUBER said he was worried
about all the talk of coup plotting, weapons and other indica:
tors of posaible violence. ODUSER again mentioned to AMBIDDY<1
that he had a finca on the Pacific Coast near the Nicaraguan
border which has an airstrip adequate for a C-%6 or Cah7
type aircraft, and made an effort to feel out AMBIDDY-1 about
the possibility of landing arms on that airstrip. AMBIDD¥-1
was noncommital and ODUBER did not press the point.

&. AMBIDDY-1 said (as his opinion) that he had gotten
the impression from talking with MARSHALL and ODUBER that.
ODUBER is pushing MARSHALL to stage a coup attempt in the hope

| that he, ODUBER, can step in at the right tine and clgia, the

Presidency, ODUDER considers Jose “Pepe” FIGUERES to be ‘his.
\ | main rival in such a plan, however. fie seema to think the

SUBJECT : Bubversive and Political Activities in
Central America

Source of the following information is a promiacny
Cuban exile who is a fairly reliable reporter. He has a
large number of direct and indirect contacts with
Anfluontial Latin Awerican nationals. Source acquired the
information from discussions held with the individuals
mentioned, during the month of Deceaber 1966,

During a conversation with Frark Marshall in early
Decenber 1966, source learned that Marshall wanted to buy
arms and asked source to supply them. Marshall said that
he needed then for what he called "an expected revolutionary
*,.. @utburat from one moment to the next in Costa Rica", aad he
6id not want his “private arsenal" to be sualler than the
arsenals of the Calderon Guardia group, Pepe Figueres'
group, Oduber's group and the Communist group. Source
asked Marshall when he needed the arms and Marshall
° gnevered NOW. Source replied that he would need at leant
thrve weeka to think about Marshall's request and then be
would give Marshall an answer. After considering what
source had said, Marshall replied, “okay, I can give you
one month to give me an answer but no more." Source
believes Marshall is in a plot to cverthrow the Costa
. Rican Government. In source's opinion "the situation in
* Costa Rica is very bad because the president does not tave
“> @ definite political group to sursert hin and therefore is
i» fig the hands of diverse groups; Calderon Guardia, Ulate.
= Sohandi, Frank Marshall etc., who respond to their own
fectesion interests and not to ta Rica, and who respond
gush tees to President Trejos. xno Partido Liberecion
Wacional, (PLM) is expecting a coup d’otat and plan to
Countereattack and stay in power."

In @ conversation with Daniel Oduber in early
 Desenber 1966, source states that Oduber “spoke badly #covt
* Don Pepe Figueres and "Chico Orlich”. Oduper cadd toast

“thoy wanted to clininate his presidential aspirations for
) the ccuing campaign and postulas Don Pepe ageio."
Oduber seid that "they (Don Pepe and Orlich) ware the
