{GOTTLIEB is believed to be Sanford GOTTITE 38, 12102 Brandywine
St., Kensington, Md. who was formerly an “employee of the
National Committee on Sane Nuclear Policy". ‘A pretext call to
the Washington bureau of the New York Times verified. that one
"Sandy" Gottlieb was employed there.) OOTTLIEB asked VIERA
what people in Miami were saying about the Watergate’ case and
what participation the Cubans had in it. He specifically
asked about the activities of Reinaldo PICO (former 2506
Brigade member), Orlando PIEDRA (former Chief of Cuban Bureau
of Investigation in Batista Government), and Rolando MASFRRRER
(former Cuban Senator and self-admitted former Communist).

was amicably terminated in 1972) and Juan A. PAULA (former
WH/Miami proprietary employee and former Controller of
Revolutionary Democratic Pront-FRD-and currently employed by

about 45 minutes and GOTTLIEB told VIERA that if he. came to
Miami they would have lunch together.
