The Pittsburgh "Sun-Telegraph" Blue Streak Edition, dated

July 15, 1958, carried an article on Page 3 regarding the

failure of LA

ROCCA to answer the Government's invitation

to his preliminary naturalization hearing.

The article

described LA ROCCA as the one-time boss of the East Liberty

numbers racket.

A similar article appeared in the Final Edition of the Pittsburgh

"Post-Gazette" on July 16, 1958, and described LA ROCCA

as one of the few who escaped a round-up of sixty ganglords

at a rural retreat in upstate New York last fall.

Before United States

Senate Labor Rackets Committee

of Pennsylvania

at Pittsburgh, advised SA VOEGE on July 1,

1958, that he had received a subpoena to serve to SEBASTIAN

JOHN LA ROCCA to appear before the Senate Select Committee

on Improper Activities in the Labor Management Field.

He stated further that LA ROCCAs close associate, MIKE

GENOVESE, had already been served with a subpoena to appear

before that committee and that he had been contacted in this

regard at Archie's Automatic Car Wash, 8050 Bennett Street,

Pittsburgh, by a Deputy United States

Marshal on June 20,

1958.

He explained that both subpoenas advise the recipients

or their lawyers to contact telephone number Capitol 4-3121

at Washington, D. C., for further advice as to when to appear

before this committee.

DI MEOLO was recontacted on August 25, 1958, and August 26,

1958, by SA VOEGE at which time he advised that he had

learned nothing new concerning the present whereabouts of

LA ROCCA and that he was still interested in learning the

- present whereabouts of GABRIEL MANNARINO, a close associate

Of LA ROCCA and a Pittsburgh top hoodlum, who has also

"disappeared" from the Pittsburgh vicinity.

It was observed by DI MEOLO at this time a subpoena is still
