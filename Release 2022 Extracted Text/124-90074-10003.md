talked with ANITA AIZCORBE DE CARBO. She stated she had

very high hopes for the successful outcome of the efforts

of DE. GUILLERMO/ALONSO PUJOL, who had gone to Cuba to

further discuss the exchange of tractors for prisoners

under the pretext of going to see his son, who was F(A

among those ill with hepatitis. An epidemic of hepatitis

was repoxted among the prisoners from the Bay of Pigs invasion.

Mrs. CARBO stated some firm, informant believed it was

Fiat, had given two million dollars, and it was going to

be possible to secure the twenty-eight million dollars

worth of tractors to be sent to Cuba according to CASTRO's

specifications; however, if this failed, she understood

that DI. ALONSO PUJOL intended to blackmail the U. S.

Government; that is, if the U. S. did not want to give

the money which was necessary, a document could be turned

over to some person who would read same at the assembly

in Punta Del Este, and the U. S. would be obliged to

furnish the money

"for the tractors-E@(Ul

Informant noted, of course, that no such

document was read at Punta Del Este, but he stated

DI. ALONSO PUJOL did go from Miami to Panama,

from Panama

to Cuba, and from Cuba back to Panama. MM 791-S stated

he thought DI. PUJOL might have made the above statements

to Mrs. CARBO, perhaps to encourage her or to make her

believe that the tractors for prisoners exchange is not a

dead issue. L

ULISES/CARBO is the husband of ANITAsIZCORBE, DE.

CARBO, and is one of the prisoners taken during the 4/17/61

Invasion effort. EKW

Subsequent to the conversation with ANITA A LI

CARBO, and after having received several reports regarding

the developing anti-American feelings of DI. ALONSO PUJOL,

informant saw the document, which is enclosd herewith, and

thought there might be some connection between the

conversation of DI. ALONSO PUJOL and Mrs. CARBO

on the one

hand, and instant document on the other. I (U)

CRET

MM 105-5147

Informant noted that only a very intelligent

person could have written the report; the person who furnished

the memorandum or information

about Mr. BENDER of the CIA

is someone who was in contact with important persons in

FLA

MM 191-S stated that DI. JOSE MANUEL CORTINA Is

a very good friend of pujol, and he and puJol have the same H

opinion regarding the role played by

the U. S. in the

entices

Bay of Pigs invasive effort.L

Informant stated DE. GUSTAVO/CUERVO RUBIO was not

involved in the preparation of this document;

a's. he is a

personal friend of PUJOL, but he is also a real friend of

the U. S., and would have had no part in prearing this

document. He further stated that Dr. SUAREZ RIVAS,

former Cuban Senator, would have had no part in the

preparation of this document, as he is not interested in

antagonizing or slandering the U. S., and further, has been

very occupied with

personal family problems for the past

three months.

Mr. FRANCISCO JAVIER CABALLERO, co-owner of the C. 4

Pasajero Funeral Home, and a well-known person, arrived in't

Havana about 2/3/62.

He is acquainted with the activities

of ALONSO PUJOL in Havana. He stated ALONSO PUJOL was seen

several times in the same

car with BIAS ROCA, well-known

Cuban Communist Party leader. The son of ALONSO PUJOL was

out of prison, and spent at least two days and two nights

going around with ALONSO PUJOL, and he also visited BIAS

POCA.

Further, the son, whose name is JORGE ALONSO RUJOL,

was allowed to go to the aiport to

father when he departed from Cuba.

MM 105-5147

Informant concluded there is some direct and

indirect evidence that Dr. ALONSO PUJOL is the author of

the document Ce

SA GEORGE E. DAVIS, JR., contacted WILLIAM NC CIARE](5)

local representative of CIA, and was advised CIA learned

of the document and its contents prior to its release,

sometime in 11/61. CIA investigated after its rebase, and

ascertained it was written by the purported signer, Dr. PEDRO

MARTINEZ FRAGA, who was

a member of the liban Revolutionary

Council. Mr. (MC CLARE Stated at first about 90 copies of

the document were released to a limited list of persons,

upon authrity of Dr. JOSE MIRO CARDONA, head of the Cuban

Revolutionary Council. Mr. MC CARE stated it is now

estimated that about 150 copies have been released.

It

is noted that the copy furnished by MM 791-S to the Miami

Office is mimeographed and would, of course, therefore, be

indicative that other copies were made, and

that as a

matter of fact, a stencil

was

cut with

the intention of

running off more copies.

CIA believes this document may possibly have

been prepared as a political power play designed to

promote the formation of a Cuban Government in Exile;

however, if this was the original intention, the idea is not

now being pushed.

и)

Since CIA is already aware of this document, and

of its circulation and contents, no copy is being furnished

CIA locally, nor is any designated for them on a circulation

basis; however, three copies of the translation of the

document are enclosed herewith, in the event the Bureau

should desire to furnish a copy to any other agency of

the government. E
