SEGREL

Mrs. CARBO stated some firm, informant believed it was
Fiat, had given two million dollars, and it was going to
be possible to secure the twenty-eight million dollars
worth of tractors to be gent to Cuba according to CASTRO'S
specifications; however, if this failed, she understood
that Dr. ALONSO PUJOL intended to blackmail the U. S.
Government; that is, if the U. S. did not want to give
the money which was necessary, 4 document could be turned
over to some person who would read same at the assembly
in Punta Del Este, and the U. S. would be obliged to
furnish the money for the tractors. (~@ (ub

Informant noted, of course, that no such
document was read at Punta Del Este, but he stated
Dr. ALONSO PUJOL did go from Miami to Panama, from Panama
to Cuba, and from Cuba back to Panama. MM 791-S stated
he thought Dr. PUJOL might have made the above statements
to Mrs. CARBO, perhaps to encourage her or to make her
believe that the tractors for prisoners exchange is not a
dead issue. C_ wu

Subsequent to the conversation with ANITA 4-+—+—~
CARBO, and after having received several reports regarding
the developing anti-American feelings of Dr. ALONSO PUJOL,
informant saw the document, which is enclosd herewith, and
thought there might be some connection between the
conversation of Dr. ALONSO PUJOL and Mrs. CARBO on the one
hand, and instant document on the other BGK)

Informant stated Dr.. custavd\cuERu UBIO was not ) FOF
involved in the preparation of this doctment, as, he is a feeee
personal friend of PUJOL, but he is also a real friend of

the U. S., and would have had no part in prearing this C aber
document. He further stated that_Dr. SUARE: IVAS, a —_—
former Cuban Senator, would have had no part in the

preparation of this document, as he is not interested in
antagonizing or slandering the U. S., and further, has been

very occupied with ersonal family problems for the past

three nonths-£G3(\)

Informant concluded there is somedirect and
indirect evidence that Dr. ALONSO PUJOL is the author of
the document XC

SA GEORGE E. DAVIS, JR. contacted (WILLIAM MC CLARE (6)
Local representative of CIA, and was advised CIA learndd
of the document and its contents prior to its release,
sometime in 11/61. CIA investigated after its rekase, and
ascertained it was written by the purported signer, Dr. PEDRO
MARTINEZ FRAGA, who was member of the Giban Revolutionary
Council. Mr.{MC CLARE. ated at first about 90 copies of
the document were released to a limited list of persons,
upon authrity of Dr. JOSE MIRO CARDONA, head of the Cuban
Revolutionary Council. Mr. {MC CAA! tated it is now
estimated that about 150 copies have been released. It
is noted that the copy furnished by MM 791-S to the Miami
office is mimeographed and would, of course, therefore, be
indicative that other copies were made, and that as a
matter of fact, a stencil was cut with the intention of
running off more copies.

CIA believes this document may possibly have
been prepared as a political power play designed to
promote the formation of a Cuban Government in Exile;
tpwever, if this was the original intention, the idea is not
now being pushed. CBS 4)

~ Since CIA is already aware of this document, and
of its circulation and contents, no copy is being furnished
CIA locally, nor is any designated for them on a circulation
- basis; however, three copies of the translation of the
: document are enclosed herewith, in the event the Bureau
should desire to furnish a copy to any other agency of

the government. cyape 4)
