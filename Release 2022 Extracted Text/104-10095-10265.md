. MEMO FOR FILE

SUBJECT : LA Division File Search

1. Inet with Bill Sturbitts and Chris Hopkins for about an
hour this afternoon to review the statua of the La task force on the
Cuban ops files. Essentially the original 900 files have been reviewed,
pa plus some 300 files to which the material in the 900 files led. Chris
was reminded in the course of this of a sensitive operation that de
never had access to at the time she was in Cuban ops, ZRKNICK. It was
an intercept of a Cuhan OWVL and provides names of a variety of CUIS
types and what they were reporting, Some 12 box~s of this material
have bien searched, and there remain two large boxes df carded yaterial
that requires meticulous review; based on the earlier search referebces
in this maternal sugg:sts other materials to be checked,
2. Items found to date add but marginally to what is known
already. We talled about how to present it for the final report. I~
envishoned separate 7ackages covered with a brief description or explanation,
which would be used for writing a final report with some attachments, but
the first set of packages or bundles being held for the record of the
research, Documents with any referebce to assassination were pulled;
they may contain condolences, but nothing operational. Some few itens
are intrig ing but not of substantive meaning that can yet be identified,
Samples of problems, not all stemming from these materials:
ae Reference was made to a latter in 1962 from a Cuban requesting
the addressee in the US about assassinations. &h.atteppt ‘is-béing:made
be Adentifyethe persons; nut at present it is an intriguing but not

very meaningful item.



bs. There are some gaps in the files at the "critical
perood," which they think reflects documents taken from the
file to serve other resear-h purposes at fhe time of the Warren
Comazssion inquiry; the transcripts, for instance, are not there,
though known to exist elsewhere.

ce I mentioned the speculation in 0/S about Frank Sturgis”
making mention of Juan Orta's role prior to ow having released
anything on this outside the agency, and what it might mean
about who knew what re Trafficante, etc, Sturbitts said that
Orta's daughter has asked the Agency for the mss. of a book or diary
done by Orta during his taking haven in the Mexican embassy in
Havana, Orta came ow; of Havana and someone itet-hitih:and::tobk the
ubsyesendingtitito Miami, where the CA people took poosessions
A search for the mss has been fruitless to sae (Don fleath:: 293
remembers its existence, but noti-its contents. Cerits “arkcifl) may
Know, but he has retired. The diary may contain very significant
mayerial, but Sturbitts recalls large burnings of paper when the
station changed from a large to small one; it ‘could have gone up in
the flames then. A search for the mss continues.

3. By and large, the projest is moving to a conclusion. When

LA finishes, we can assemble what has been found, which seems not to be all
that much, and a final swmary can be undertaken. In terms of what has
Yuen found to date it would seem that we have little to add to what ue

already lmows
