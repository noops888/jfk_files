contact with Mr, VEGIANA, Alpha 66 representative.

2, US) VECTANA has previously provided this organizatien (USA0SD)
intelligence information obtained aa a by-product. of the Alpha 66 harase-
ment raids, He also was instrumental in obtaining several Soviet weapons
and a small quentity of emmnition captured in an Alpha 66 raid on Cuba
for USAOSD in connection with Project TREASURE HUNT.

enhanes rapport between the Cuban group and USAOSD and could be effectively
exploited for support of existing USAOSD intelligence collection operations
against Guba.

of action are recommended for your consideration:

a, ACSI initiate steps te obtain the release of the impounded
poat and cargo to Alpha 66 in coordination with the Bureau of Customs.

AIN 8274 from Project AUTOBOAT (S} reported that VECIANA was coming
to Washington to talk to someone about getting an impounded boat released
from authorities in Miami. This matter discussed by Col Boyt and Col

Rolfe with Cols Albro and Boucher, Col DePuy of Special Warfaré and
Generals Lansdale and Leonard. See Memo prepared by Lt Col Rolfe. Contact
made with Veciana on 22 and 23 January in Washington by Lt Col Drashpil

and Capt Arms indicates that there is some possibility of exploiting Alpha
66 if they can successfully run raids into Cuba and infiltrate agents into
the island. Approval for such action must be obtained and mst be in line
with National Policy. Should approval be granted this unit for exploitation
of Alpha 66, the next step will be to develop further rapport,

carefully investigate the group's potential, learn more about the group,
i.e., leadership, plans, locations, capabilities, requirements and willingness
to cooperate with US agencies (military). No committments should be made
until these things are determined. Should approval be given for

US support of Alpha 66 raids, etc., complete coordination with DCSOPS should
be effected to assure maximum intelligence collection and operational
application.
