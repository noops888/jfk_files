Payments to Dependents of “Heroes and Mirtzra”

TE ap eH TCA
See Paragraph 3

DIR 06846

1. Forwarded under separate cover {5 a Ifeting of nll payments
presently being made by ANIRON to dependents of heroes and martyrs. In addition
to the AMIRON payments JMWAVE to directly payiny the widow of AMGLAD-1 (seo
reference) and #0 per month to the widow of AHCUSP-L.

2, It 1s Considered most inadvisable to terminate benefits to these
dependents: aspectally so long as subsistence payments are continued to dependento
of captured, missing and-deceased strike force personnel. If these fow payments
were discontiriued while the large group remained in a “pay” status the local
repercussions would-be loud and most’ embarrassing.

3. In any event it is difficult to arrive at a dollar figure that
would constitute an equitable lump-sum settlement in such cases. ° Instead it
1s suggested that these payments be continued until such time as a decision
reached on dependents of deceased strike force personnel and final scttlementa
be patterned after those decided on: for the strike force group.
