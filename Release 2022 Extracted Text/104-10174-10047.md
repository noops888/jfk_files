vere prepared to go ahead; that they hoped that Mehbora could be 2
available for briefing in Washington on 13 January. ‘They envisaged i
thie briefing as being-very cursory, ‘The main briefing will be given :
by, station personnel folloving Tichborn's arrival in Havana.

Mf>Goonep called my attention to IN A760 in vhich it was stated
that the Havana Station vould brief Tichvorn, introduce him to a fev
contacts -- I hope they von't introduce bin in a manner which vill
completely dlov bin before he starts -- ani that they suggested that
he represent hinself as an attorney engared by unidentified American

4. on 7 January I contacted Tichborn who suid that he could be in:
Washington on 14. January and that he vould have to return to Los Angeles
by 3 February. I asked him vhat his fee vould be and he said that it -
ves his understanding that he hea previously talked in the neighborhood
of $1,500 to $1,600. I countered by saying that in view.of the shortness
af this trip I did not feel I could do any better than $1,300, which he :
accepted. I asked him if he desired that we advance him any money at
this time or if he could buy his ticket on the cuff and that we would
make sone. sort of arrangements while he vas in Washington, and he
said he woult buy his ticket and that he would abide by whatever i
procedures v2 nomally follow. I told him at this tine that IT would = |
prefer that he bought a round trip ticket Los Angeles ~ New York = ‘
Havana and that he proceed that vay. I also instructed him upon arrival |
in New York to buy a ticket Washington ~ New York and return, I did
this aa I feel it-4s preferable fron a security standpoint that he not
have any indication on the ticket be will use in entering Cuba that he
has been in Washington immediately prior to the trip or that he intends

to return there following the trip.

5. The substance of the above was commuiicated to Mr. Dahlgren,
C/WI/3, who egreed that in view oy the time factor it would be
preferable for Tichborn to come on the llth rather than ‘18th and that -
the price was right, etc. I confirmed the date with Mr, Cooney) ona will «
contact Tichborn again, advising him to call me upon ni? erri in
Washington on 14 January.
