ves his understanding that he has previously talked in the neighborbood

al 5i, 500 to 81,600.

I countered by saying that in view of the shortnes

of this trip I did not feel I could do any better than $1,300, wbich he

this time or 1f he could buy his ticket on the cuff and that we vould

make some. sort of arrangements while he vas In Washington, und he

sald he would buy his ticket and that he sould abide by whatever

procedures wr, normally follow. I told him at this time that I would

prefer

Havans and that he proced that vay. I also Instructed him upon arrival

In New York to buy a ticket Washlagton - New York and return.
