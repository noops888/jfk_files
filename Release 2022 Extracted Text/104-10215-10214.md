SUBJECT: Arthur G, VAIVADA - Request for Promotion
p-imidandiaas

1, -It is requested that Arthur G, Vaivada, a Career Agent, be promoted
from GS-11 to grade GS-12 for hie outstanding performance in carrying out a
precarious mission in line with the objectives of Project AMPHODARCH, in
which he 4s the Principal Agent.

2. In early Jantary 1958, Vaivada volunteered to undertake a mission to
contact Cuban rebel lecder Fidel Castro Ruz in the Sierra Maestra mountains
in south-eastern Cuba, He arrenged for his free passage into the Sierras
through contacts within the 26 July Movement which he and the Station.
developed earlier. After the necessary arrangements, Vaivada left La Habana
on 5 April 1958’ for Santiago de Cuba, from where he left for the Sierras
under the escort of rebel guides. In: the course of approximately twenty
days! stay at the mountain hideout of Castro's headquartere, during which
time he was exposed to many hardships and great personal risks, he accompanied
Castro and a force of about, 200 rebels on their dawn attack on the town of
Manzanillo on 26 March 1958. At Hanzanillo, Vaiveda broke off contact with
the Cuban rebels and returned to his base in Habana.

3. During bis relatively short stay in the Sierra Haestra mountains,
Vaivada was able to gather considerable intelligence and operational
information of noteworthy value, together with an excellent photographic
coverage of his trip.

4. This exploit is another achievenent to be added to the impressive
past performances of Arthur G, Vaivada, who has always shown a deep devotion.
to his work and to the Agency.

5. Vaivada was born on 20 June 1922, and has been with CIA since 1949.
He has been a career agent since 1 June 1957, ana was promoted to the grade

of GS-11 on 1 June 1957... His tour of duty in Cuba was from August 1954 until
32 March 1958,

MEMORANDUM :

Arthas Walvadae

SUBJECT: oubject of our letter miiber 4U25; interest in Assignment
in U. 5.

Re Sagatt
1. In recent conversations with both JRP and DS, Subject has
broachea tne prospect of a possible assignment within tne Us-S, follow- H
ing completion of nis Habana assignment. He says he would not wat his H
Statements re reassignment which wore recently forwarded to Headquarters {
to be interpreted to mean tnat he is not interested in au, S, tour. ile : if
Says that ne nas been giving mich thougnt to his future career, as well
i as to the needs of nis family, He points out that ne personally nas now
: Spent approximately 16 years, excepting vacations and short training
i Perioas, living ma working outside tne U. S., that nis two cnilaren
! have never lived tnere, and tnat voth hé and his wife are concerned
: that too mich time will elajse before they can provide their children ;
i wita a period in the U.S, during their foruative years. :

2. It is the opinion of both KDS and JkP that Subject is at a
Point in his career development wnere a tour at Heaiquarters would
be extremly beneficial, The Station lacks knowledge conceming the
Specific deaaquarters jobs to which a person of Subjects status might
be assigned; but it is our understanding that OTR soretimes employs
these persons as instructors. ie believe that a tour with OTK would
not only remedy in great measure deficiencies in Sudject’s background
caused by lack of iieaiquarters experience, but would at the same tine
i afford Uik excellent instructor material,

3. In view of Subject’s own interest in sucn am assignment, and
Lopes gar estimate of tas potential value to nim and to the Organization
i that would accrue from it, we recommend tnat Hgaiquarters arrange such
i am assignment if at all possiole,

4. In view of the likelihood of Subject’s transfer in the near
future, a prompt decision is requested.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, FI

SUBJECT + Request for Conversion cf arthur G. VATVADA From
Contract to Staff Status

REFERENCE, + HXH-A-2577

1. Referenced dispatch fron the field recomends the conversion
of contract, agent arthur G. VATVADA to staff status, and presents
& strong case for such conversion. VAIVADA has served GUA in a cons
tract capacity since 1949, wita a continuous high level of perzor-
mance; first in Costa Rica, later in Guatemala and Cuba. iia is cure
rently assigned to Cuba and is expoctr’ to remain there indefinitely.
VAIVADA 1s 3h years old and was promoted recently to the equivalent
of & GS-10 rating. His expressed career interests lie in contimed
employment by CIA, more especially in the area ofunofficial cover
assignments, for which he is highly suited, _

2. Unfortunately Subject's spouse (since 1945) 4s a Costa Rican
citizen, a eituation which complicates his proposed conversion som=
what. She has expressed a desire to acquire U.S. citizenship, however,
and it has been determined that this can be arranged within the next
several months, barring unforeseen developaents. She will be required

“to spend most of this period in the U.S. and 41s currently ming

plans, to do.so.

3. In view of VAIVADAts oatstanding record as a contract agent,
his strong overall qualifications, and his exvressed desire for @.
career with CIA, it is recomended that he be granted staff status
at grade GS-11, contingent uron his wife's first becoming a U.S.
citizen, and providing he can meet Security and-other requirements,
There is available in #H Division a stafl. position (BAF-L09) to
which VAIV4DA can be assigned.

4, WH Division contemplates bringing VAIVADA to the U.S. for
covert training in the near futare.

5. Approval for the conversion ‘of VAIVADA from contract to
staff status, as indicated above, is hereby requested,

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

“SUBJECT: Arthur G. VAIVADA; Staff status
. ;

1. The undersigned discussed dase this date with Mr. Mrere:
(2709 "I"; telephone extension 2551-2552) and with Mr.,:Penniagton
(20hL sr") both of Security Division. Mr.-Hyers was shown the con-\ 1" \f 9
tent of HKH-A- (recomendation for staff status for VAIVADA)\ (isd

and apprised of the problem of Mra. VAIVADA not being a U.S. citi- Trak Ts |
zen. Myers stated that, while cases like tiis vere usually very ‘dl i
difficult, he felt this particular one might be Justified in view _\ \uaxill le i
of VAIVADA's long and excellent record with the Agency and the réla- Cplegmalhy !
tively long tine during vhich ha has beea married. Myers indicated ars i
that the procedure would be as follows: Queens i

Presentation of a formal request for waiver on citizenship Trl it
requirements for spouse and granting of staff status to Subject. eid boo
‘The memorandum would be prepared for Personnel, would then go

to Security, and subsequantly, with recomendations of both~ Wud ont |
fo Deputy Director, who would have the final decision im thin | (tectitehe — |
case. 4g Cec i
Myers was to discuss the matter further with other elements of = - | 6% |

Security and advise within the next several days as to what the next
step should be.

2. Considering the possibility that such a request might be
turned down, the uadersigned discussed with Pexnington the proc : 3
dures for acquisition of citizeaship for Mrs. VAIVADA, and detar- ii aseaat
mined that this should be relatively simple. The requirements were: nieces
Presence in the U.S. (vicinity of. Washington) for approxinately
forty-five days with sone additional time to.acquire passport: . So’. ~-
long as we have nothing that would make her inadmissable to the U.S.
the basic requirensnts would ber ability to speak. English and to
pass @ relatively simple test based on pamphlet which would be gives
to her for study. Security would Presumably handle her case wher

she arrives in -the States.

3. It bas occurred to the umdersigned that perhaps, if it is
mecessary for ras VAIVADA to acquire citizenship, VAIVADA hinsélf
could be brought to the Washington vicinity for trainiag’ purposes
in order to facilitate the visit of his wife, expenses, etc. This
would at the same tine afford an opportunity to provide VATVADA
with formal Headquarters or PBPRIME trainiag

i 1. Referenced dispatch from the field recomeends the conversion

H good case for such conversion. VAIVADA has served CIA in a contract

H capacity since 1949 with a continuous high level of performance; first

2. Unfortunately Subject's spouse (since 19h5) is a Costa:
Rican citizen, Prelininsry investigation at Headquarters bas revealed
that Subject's conversion to staff status is virtually out of the
question so long as his wife remains an alien. It has also been de~
termined, however, that the wife can acquire U.S. citizenstip withia
@ span of h5 days if she so desires and ig willing to come to the
U.S. for that period of tine, This would remove the major. stumbling

7 4, It is further reccomended that WH Division consider bring-
ing VAIVADA to the U.S. for covert training to coincide with his wife's
stay (at Headquarters! convenience). This would. facilitate acqiisi-
tion of citizenship for the wife and at the same time afford VAIVADA : fie

Memo on Cover Status - Arthur G, Vaivada

1. Enclosed herewith is the outline of an idea in xeering with the
nature of this notional cover plan/of a temporary nature, Careful
consideration has been given to a number of tdezsy all of which were
rejected because possible local conflicts. This idea is still general j
enough (and I hope convineing) to leave opportunity for enanges and/or H
improvexent at Headquarters, The idea, and the terminology, was i
gleaned from the pages of "Investrent in Cuba", a July 1956 study :
published by the U.S. Department of Comerce,

2, As I understand this cover arrangement, the P3I shevld mail me
a directive somewhat along the lines of the enclosed infornetion. This
should "hold us" for a couple of ronths, with rossibly some queries from :
me occasionally. Then when our operational picture requires investigation
in some particular field, PSI can be notified through the Station to
request a survey or poll in that field,

3. On the basis of the enclosed "directive" (plus stationary and
allied materials) I can consult a local lawyer as to the registration . i
of this "Agency" and then advise PSI as to the legal requirenent, i

MELORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Vaivada

1. During the morning of 30 April Mr. Millard of Cover tele=
phoned regarding Subject, citing IN 35508. lr, Millard said that
he would be meeting. with Vaivada at 1600 hours today and proposed
providing him with a teazorary rather than pormanent cover with
the new cover company which was being contemplated for long-range
davelopnent. Yr, Millard's reasoning ¥as that he did not wish
to place Vaivada under the new company with the chance that the
trial period approved for. the Station might cause Vaivada to be
pulled out from that.cover in short order. li, Millard said that
the temporary cover he intended offering Vaivada would be adequate.

2. I concurred with the above proposal.

1. Reference is made to your memorandum dated 28 February 1957,
wherein a provisicnal covert security approval and a covert security
approval were requested to enable the Subject's conversion to career
agent status for use as Principal Agent for Zroject AKPHOUARCH in
Cuba, under non-official cover.

2. In accordance with the provisions set forth in Clandestine
Services Instruction No. 10-5 and Field Regulation 10-215, a pro-
visional covert security approzal is granted for the use of the
Subject, as described in your request as set forth in paragraph gl,
above. ie

3. It should be noted that the provisional covert security
approval herein granted is based on linited investigative coverege
and should not be in any way construed as a final security deter-
mination relative to a full covert security approval. Upon coa-
pletion of additional investigation now pending, you will be ap-
propriately advised as to our decision with recard to the issuance
of a full covert security approval.

4. Subjects of provisicnal covert security approvals are not
to represent themselves as, nar are they to be represented as,
employees of CIA.

5. Your attention is called to the fact that a provisional
covert security approval does not constitute complete compliance
with the provisions of CIA Regulation 10-210. Therefore, if you should
desire at a later date to change the status or use of this individual,
a request for approval to cover eny prepesed change should be subaitted
to this office, 7

6. This approval becones invalid in the ovent the Subject's
services are not utilized within 60 days of the date of this meno-
randun.
