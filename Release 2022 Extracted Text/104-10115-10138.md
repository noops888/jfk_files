Memorandum of Conversation with Ann/Goodpasture a

SS
Subject: JMYAK--Agee's plan to resign and the kidnapping
of his children

1. One Saturday afternoon (presumably in July of
1968) Ann Goodpasture received a telephone call from
Henry Dearborn, counselor of Embassy, who had either
heard a local radio broadcast--or received a call from
a reporter to inquire--about a report of a U.S. diplomat
in Mexico being sought for kidnapping his two children
from their mother. Dearborn was looking for COS Wynn :
Scott to ask if the diplomat might be one of the Station

personnel.

2 This was the first notice the Station had of

the niatter and not until they received a query from Head-
quarters did they know that Agee was the kidnapper (Ann
thinks Mrs. Agee had complained to Headquarters about

the kidnapping). Dearborn, incidentally, is retired now
and residing in Chevy Chase.

3. Regarding Agee's plans to resign, Ann said she
had been told by Charlotte Bustos on the Mexican Branch
in 1967 that Agee intended to ship some used dry cleaning
equipment to Mexico City, resign and set up a dry clean-
ing shop there at the end of his tour. She said he hoped
that the assignment as Olympic Attache would lead to an
additional regular tour at the Station, but it didn't
work out that way. He was not allowed a full shipment of
effects for the short assignment to the Olympics, so his
plan to ship the dry cleaning equipment was foiled.

4. When I asked Ann if she was aware of the cause
of the Agee divorce she said not but suggested we talk to
Sally Jameson (Branch-7 reports officer) who she thinks
