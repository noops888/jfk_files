Departmental Attorney JOHNSON further recommended

that LUIS POSADA be contacted in regard to the present

address of ALBERTO LARRAIN-MAESTRE, who

fugitive.

is a Narcotics

This meet between source and MAESTRE would be

covered by Bureau Agents and Agents of the Federal Bureau

of Narcotics. The purpose of coverage would be to establish

the present whereabouts of the fugitive so that his arrest

no that he a19o120h

could be effectuated.

It is the opinion of Departmental

Attorney JOHNSON that MAESTRE could possibly be used as

a witness against FRANK ROSENTHAL and NORMAN ROTHMAN

garding their involvement in bombing matters.

On July 7, 1967, a conference was held at the

request of Departmental Attorney JOHNSON.

In attendance

at this conference were JAMES DURANT and DAVE GOODHART

of the State's Attorney's Office, Dade County, Florida,

and SAs. SWINNEY and WELSH of the

FBI.

The above mentioned

course of action recommended

by Departmental Attorney JOHNSON was fully explained to

state authorities

insofar as the involvement of ROSENTHAl.

Although the general plan involving ROSENTHAL was explained

to the local authorities, at no time was the source or the

employer of source mentioned to local authorities.

Assistant States Attorney DURANT, when apprised

of the sensitive source of information and

the chance of

requesting dismissal of indictment against ROSENTHAL, rE-

quested time in order that this proposal could be fully

discussed with States Attorney GERSTEIN.
