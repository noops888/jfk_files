HEXOR4KDIM FOR THE PECOSD

SUBJDCT: Harcos DIAZ Lans

1. It would appear that subject left the U.S. for Mexico some months ago

on the adrice of a lawyer, that be went to Medco, thereby violatina his parole,

and then couldn't pet a risa to get back into tbe

U.3.

He was a little upset

about this sinco he says he was just trying to legalize his status in the U.s.

After a couple of so: hs, it was finally agreed that he noald te ailored to re-

enter the U.S. on parole.

It is very confusing ho advised what, wo was pushing

who, of why, but Illis seesed to think CIA was yuaning the hardest, but now has

changed its aind. Be that as it nay, they seer to have set up two inter lens for

subject it the Bebassy, at the first of which he was told all the bad aspects

of his situation, but--failed to tell him they had agreed to let hi= back in the

U.S. on parole.

So sabject took off on his own with the aid of sare Catholic

organizztion, shan tie river and sade his way to lashington where he contacted

an unstited Congressionai, probably Senate, concittee, who passed his on to Isis,

apparently General Srirg hirself. The General vas not pleared, because abricuel

no nad a tot potato. In short there vere objections to every possibie solution.

Subjoct has a wife and tho children legelly resident in Florida and one of the

children is an Anerican citizen, and owns a home there, so paroling the subject

anthere else might cause some bed publicity.

and Mr. Pennington and another person said they had talked to Shel Edbards and it

had been agreed that the new policy on parolas would probably be the hest thing

as that night keep bin out of our hair in Florica.

Hr. Henessey reviewed a lot

of the legal situation and said in practice it rouldn't work, and he hanted an 1o

sodiate decision as to netter CIh would say that it was in the rational interest,

After consultation with

and nine that anted are old cat a fe 16 alte on likely

that CHl would express in uriting such of any destres of wishes about subject.

Kr. Henessey. then brought subjoct in and gave hin a storn talk about his obligations

and conduct under parole.
