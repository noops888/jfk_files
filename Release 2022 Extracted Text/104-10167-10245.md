2. | Jt would appear that subject left the U.S. for Mexico same menths ago
on the advice of a lawyer, that be went to Mexico, thereby violating his parole,
and then couldn't ret a visa to get back into the U.3, He was a little upset
about this since he says he was Just trying to legalize his status in the U.S.
After a couple of mo: chs, it was finally agreed that he would te allowed to re=
enter the U.S. on parole. It 4s very confusing “ho advised what,

who, or why, but I&NS seemed to think CIA was rushing the hardest, but now has
changed its sind. Be that as it may, they seen to have set up two interviews for
subject st the Eebassy, at the first of which he was told all tne tad aspects
of his situation, but-“failed to tell him they had agreed to let hin back in the
U.S, on parole, So subject took off on his own with the aid of scce Catholic :
organizeticn, swom the river and made his way to Washington where He contacted :
en unsteted Congressicnai, probably Senate, comtittee, who passed hin on to Iexs, ae
apparently Generel Svirg hizself. The General vas not pleased, :
be had & rot potato. In short there were objections to every Se solution.
Subject has.a wife and two children legelly resident in Florids and one of the
children is an American citizen, and owns a hone there, so paroling the subject
anywhere else might catse some bed publicity. eu
