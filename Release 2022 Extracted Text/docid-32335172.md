The only assignment given at the meeting was to
have Negro cemeteries checked as hiding places for concealed
arms. HART advised he had steel rods made to probe graves’
of Negroes as the arms and ammunition are reportedly buried
approximately eighteen inches deep. HART said the Minute
Men must have arms and waa in favor of a crossbow as it does
not make any noise.

HART informed AT 1655-C (RAC) on 8/14/61 that the
Minute Men are a group of men willing and able to do things.
He claimed the Minute Men had stopped integration in Miami,
Florida. He stated the Minute Men operate only in small
groups, never more than four men in a group, and the members
only knew the other members of his group. He claimed the
Minute ‘Men hold no meetings and have no meeting place. He
mentioned a retired General or Colonel by the name of
and said he was ere of the directors, He sald the organization
was nation-wide and their purpose is to fight Communism. He
claimed any members of the Minute Men who betrayed the organi- i
gation would be killed, Initiation fee is $25.00 and dues are ‘
$12.00 per year.

On August 23, 1961, HART advised AT 1655-C (RAC) :
that the Minute Men had helped BUFORD SUTTON, former police H
officer, Macon, Ga., escape prosecution in Macon, Georgia. i
HART stated the hard core of this organization is the "Minute ;
Men" and that"Minute Men Associates"are subordinate to them. }
The address putting out the literature concerning the Minute
Men Associates is Minute Men Associates, 2850 East 117th Street, "

Since this time, HART has been interested in Learning
all he can concerning the people who l#e and work in the area
where this cemetery is located, On 9/25/61 HART advised he had
le&rned from HENDERSON that about six men in @ car with a
Tennessee Tag and a pickup truck had brought one of the bodies to
the cemetery, . HART claimed this made sense, since he had learned
from a member of the Minute Men that the burial of the arms was
supervised from Mount Eagle, Tennessee. J, T, HENDERSON has
since indicated a desire to join the Minute Men and has furnished
his $25.00 initiation fee, but as of this date has not been sworn
in, | HART has indicated he would like AT 1655-c (RAC) to be his
deputy. HART furnished AT 1655-c (RAC) a letter with letterhead
entitled "Minute Men Associates" 11808 Buckeye Road, Cleveland
20, Ohio. The letter was dated July 27, 1961, and addressed to
Mr. KENT CURTNEY, Post Office Box 4a54, New Orleans 18, Louisiana.
The letter was reportedly sent by LOUIS G. MARTON and makes
reference to a meeting held in Washington, D. C., on the 13th,
month not named, and sets forthihis reactions concerning the
meeting. The letter alleges ali actions of the Supreme Court of
the U. S. have been null and void since 10/24/45 and the U. S.
has had no legal Government of any kind since that time. The
letter urges the establishment of a "mighty, patriotic Army of
Minute Men" to restore to the U. S. its lost constitutional
liberties and its national independence.

On 10/12/61 HART advised AT 1655-C (RAC) that he now
had in the Atlanta area approximately 57 groups. HART has told
the informant that a group of five men make up &@ unit but at
one time told the informant that they had as many as 25 men in
&@ group but that no more than five of these men met together.
HART claimed he felt he would soon get some sealed orders from
headquarters and claimed he had been given another state and would
have more to do. HART claimed he had not received any money for
expenses and hoped they would soon send him some as he was not a
rich man. HART indicated that they would soon have 20,000 to
30,000 inen.

HAROLD ATKINSON has advised that he had been designated
to work with Dr. COMPTON in searching grave yards for arms which
had been reportedly buried by the Negroes. He advised Dr, COMPTON
has always found excuses not to go and he doubts COMPTON is
serlous, He stated HART told him the Minute Men were made up of
groups never over four or five present at a meeting and these
meetings are being held all over the United States.

HART advised ATKINSON he was expecting a man from
Orlando, Florida, to bring instructions. He stated the head
of the organization is-a retired General from the U. S.

Army and ail members carry .410 gas guns. HART told him
they were to get a little club to carry that costs $25.00
and this club had a .410 ghell in each end. HARD has talked
to him about killing some judges and prominent people using
the crossbow as this could not be traced,

On 9/11/61 HART told AT 1655-C (RAC) that the Minute
Men Associates of Cleveland, Ohio, are a front for the Minute
Men and this organizations activities are not secret. He
said Minute Men Associates are fot the Hard core which is
a secret oganization. He indicated the purpose of the Minute
Men is to eliminate certain leaders or anyone, in fact, who
is standing in the way of returning this government to
constitutional government. He claimed the Minute Men had
&@ man who has been in the "rackets" and he has been selected
to fly to South America’: and bring back a rare deadly poison,
more deadly than curare, This poison will be used to eliminate
enemies of the Minute Men leaving no trace in the blood.
HAROLD A. ATKINSON advised HART has contacted him coneerning
@ meeting which was to be held sometime during the week of
11f6/l. He stated HART told him that he was being
considered as the person to be delegated te do away with one
of the palitical leaders in the Atlanta area, HART told him
it would either he him or another member to do the job. He
claimed ATKINSON would be well-paid for this task by the
Mayflower organization. HARD did not expand any further .
concerning this activity but stated he was not a member of the
Mayflower organization, It is noted the indices of the Atlanta
Division fails to reflect any reference for the Mayflower
organization, ATKINSON is associated with HART in attempting
to sell subscriptions to the Metropolitan Newspaper, Inc.,
a newspaper HART is allegedly attempting to organize.
ATKINSON states HART does not have any presses and has been
using the money obtained through subscriptions and the sale of
debentures to pay his personal bills. ATKINSON is of the
opinion the Metropolitan Newspaper, Inc., will never go
to press. He feels the Minute ten Organization may just
be another scheme of HART's to gain money for his personal
benefit and that no such organization actually exists.

a The Atlanta Division does not feel that it is in
& position at this time to make a recommendation concernig
opening a case under the Racial Matters caption soncerning
the Minute Men. It is felt that additional information will
be developed at the next meeting of the Minute Men or in the
