MAJOR THEFT Do RsS0 ff fn
This is to advise of a complaint made to the United States
Attorney's (USA) Office, Miami, by O. B. Cline, a former Assistant |
United States Attorney now in practice of criminal law in Miami, that
the FBI had intimidated Joseph Merola by insisting that he become a st
pigeon or his probation would be revoked and people would be advised hi
was an informant. The SAC, Miami, obtained an affidavit from
SA H. Wayne Swinney who interviewed Merola and the action of
SA Swinney indicates he used poor judgment in the interview.

BACKGROUND:

Victims Edith and Fritz Werner Dorigo who own and operate
the Hofbrau Haus restaurant, Hallandale, Florida, on the evening of
i 3/20/61 were robbed by two armed white bandits who wore gloves and had
' stockings over their faces.

4 Miami Informant Chester Gray advised he believed

; (Joseph Merola's "two boys" had committed this robbery. He based this
the fact that immediately following the robbery Merola had in his

H possession expensive jewelry. Merola has a gun equipped with a

| ilencer and this type weapon was used in the robbery. f

7 Merola has an extensive criminal record dating back to

4 1947. He is now serving a two-year probationary sentence in
connection with an Immigration and Naturalization Service matter.
Merola until recently was an informant of the Miami Office and has

in the past furnished information,primarily concernjng ille;
