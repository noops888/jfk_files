SF T-1 furnished the following information on
January 7, 1963, and on previous contacts, concerning the
Italian-Sicilian organization (La Causa Nostra) of which he
allegedly 1s a member at San Jose, California, and has been
for several years:

Qrigin

The organization to which SF T-1 belongs was ex-
plained to him as being an old organization started by people
of Sicily to protect themselves from land barons and others
of autocratic rule. When these people came to this country,
they:naturally remained closely knit and continued their
specific organization in this country to make money.

Structure
SF T-1 stated that the group to which he belongs “is

nationally organized. He has received no information indicating

that it is controlled by or affiliated with any similar or-
ganization in Sicily. He has asked JOHN MISURACA, during the
time he was being indoctrinated, whether this organization

was the "Mafia", and MISURACA told him it was. He was told
that they do not use this term now but use the term "Cosa
Nost(r)a", which means "Qur Thing". The informant does not
seem to pronounce the letter "R" in Nost(r)a and indicates that
the use of the letter "R" in pronunciation is used more among
main-land Italians than Sicilians. He stated he has not heard
this organization called La Causa Nost(r)a.

The informant advised that the smallest organized
unit to his understanding is a "Circle." When the informant
entered, he was initiated with two others, ALEX CAMARATA and
PETE MISURACA, The informant and ALEX CAMARATA were assigned
to a "Circle" having ANGELO MARINO as the head, while PETE
MISURACA was assigned to a "Circle" having MANNY FIGLIA as the
head, or Capo.

The informant advised that the basic group in the
lower organization next to a "Circle" is called the Nost(r)a
Brigada, which the informant said is a "Group" headed by one
man called a "capo", This "Group" is frequently called a
"Family," and may be the same as a "Circle."

The Nost(r)a Brigada may be comprised of several

Initiation and Oath

SF T-1 recalled that when he was about to enter
"the organization", JOHN MISURACA called him to see him at
the home of ALEX CAMARATA, At that time, MISURACA explained
to him how he entered the organization. He told him that
Someone would take a needle and draw blood from a finger.
He stated that anything could happen and that someone might
create an incident to see how he would react. He recalled
Someone saying that they might even throw a gun to him to see
what he would do. The informant talked over these matters
subsequently with ALEX CAMARATA and PETE MISURACA who were
also entering the organization and who seemd to know more of
what was going on than the informant.

When they were actually taken into the organization,
they went to the cheese factory in San Jose. There were
several members from the San Jose area as well as from the
Modesto area. The informant, ALEX CAMARATA and PETE MISURACA
remained outside and were taken in one at a time for their
initiation. This was in 1956.

The initiation consisted of words delivered to the
informant by two different people, to his recollection. He
stated these people were MANNY FIGLIA and CHARLIE CARBONE.
They were hard to understand. They did not explain the
organization at that time but the details came out from these
two as well as several others a little at a time over the
succeeding ‘years.

At the initiation, he was told that whoever "pinches"
him would be his godfather. JOE CUSENZA turned out to be the
godfather of the informant. The informant had never met this
individual before.

During the proceedings, a picture of a saint was
burned. Those giving the statements to him would read or
utter a sentence and require him to repeat it. He recalled
the word baptised being used. He recalled that the words
included statements to the effect that they were never to
contact law enforcement officials personally or otherwise,
that they were to have nothing to do with such a man, regardless
of consequence, that they would uphold the organization over
everythingelse and would do all in their power for the
organization.

He recalled them also saying that the organization
would do all possible for the "Family," and that no member
could take action against another member without the okay of

the "Council."

The proceeding was similar to the reading in a
wedding ceremony in that a sentence would be stated and the
person initiated repeated the sentence given. The climax of
the ceremony was the pricking of a finger by the godfather
using a needle or a Imife.

Discipline

Immediately after entry into the organization, the
informant learned that the person they should go to at all
times was the "Capo." They were told never to go above him
without his approval. This directive has since been changed
and they now can go to higher authority without seeing their
"Capo" first. He did not recall any suggestions or orders
to use other than their true names. He himself used the name
AL COSTA on a trip to Reno but did not know the reason for
this. He learned that a "Don" could.not go back east unless
he got the permission of BONANNO, which makes him believe that
the headquarters of this organization would be in the east.
Since the original orders of never cooperating with the law
enforcement officials, a change has been instituted allowing
them to talk to law enforcement agents where practical. They
have been told that even though this can be done, they still-
"make their. own law."

When the informant was taken in, it was explained
that he may be called upon to commit crime. It was further
explained that he would be told why a crime must be committed
and assured of the complete backing of the organization. :
The initiation itself is an oath, and the final thing stated
is words to the effect that the person initiated can never
leave the organization except through death. He has been
told that although the organization may order them to commit
crime, they cannot commit crime on their own without the
approval of the organization. Each member is often called a
"Soldato", meaning "Soldier", within the organization.

Dues
When he first came in, he learned that they were
expected to give $5 per month to the organization. This was

dropped two years ago, He himself was not required to give
often because no one told him to whom to give his money. He
has been told that contributions originally depended upon the
ability to pay, and ROSE CAMARATA recently told him that her
"father-in-law" had to put $100,000.00 into the Apalachien
meeting. When he was told that he could even be called upon
to commit a crime but could never commit a crime without the
okay of the organization, he was also told that they should
try to do good work and that if any crimes were committed, they
were expected to pay 10 per cent of any "take" to the
organization,

Records

The informant advised that he has never heard or
seen any indication that records for this organization are
maintained . He has never seen any written instructions
and has heard that they should never keep notes or things
such as phone numbers or addresses on their person since
these could be picked up and used against them.

He has never seen any such thing as an insignia for
the organization. The only introduction he has heard that
would specifically mean that the person being introduced as
a member is by introducing the person as a "friend of ours"
or "amigo Nost(r)a.”

Attitude Toward United States Government

SF T-1 advised he has never heard any member say
anything about service in the armed forces, holding one
country above another, or any organization above the organi-
zation in this country located elsewhere. The only thing
that he feels could refer to any such thing of this nature is
the statement that they would pledge themselves to uphold
this organization over everything.

ORGANIZATIONAL LEADERSHIP

On October 26, 1962, SF T-1 advised that the Mayor
of Palermo, Italy, had recently been a house guest at the home
of SALVATORE MARINO, former "capo" of La Causa Nostra in
San Jose, California. According to SF T-1, ANGELO MARINO is
reported to have made the statement to other members of
"the organization" in San Jose, California, that the Mayor of
