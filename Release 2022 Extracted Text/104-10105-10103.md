As written, passage in first full para-
graph could endanger a particular source,
according to NE Division, which suggests
the following modification:

«-.unexpected development. From sur-
veilling the group's movements it. was
established that the intention was to
travel to an adjoining area, where a
major energy installation, we assumed,
might be their target. CIA, through
liaison, warned the authorities of that
country and appropriate defense measures

Pages 38-41:

LA Division recommends that the passage on the ter-

rorist kidnapping in the Dominican Republic be deleted
for the following reasons:

1) This incident is still fresh in the minds
of most Dominicans and it is unrealistic to assume
that it will not be picked up and published in the
local press. Barbara Hutchison, USIA, one of the
people kidnapped, is still in the Dominican Republic
and, according to two recent reports, is again being
considered as a target for kidnapping. The potential
for terrorist acts against US citizens continues;
three leaders of terrorist-oriented groups are in
prison and publication of this item could propel the
terrorists into action.

2) The close link between the ambassador and
the station, as portrayed in the book could be pre-
judicial to his public image and might even provoke
the terrorists to target against him.

tee
3) The station has renewed a (liaison relation-
ship and much effort is being directed toward deve-

lopin: utual confidence. Revelation of details of
a ne sncren, a former division, chief might
le @ increasingly friendly (liaison contact) to

wonder whether we can maintain confidence on future
operations and thereby throw the new relationship
into jeopardy.

4) Although the bugging of the thermos was
discovered and appeared in the press, the use of
the Coca Cola case was not exposed and. therefore
continues to be an operational possibility, at. least
as far as the Dominican Republic is concerned.
Revelation of the technique by Agee should not be
a criterion for further disclosure.
