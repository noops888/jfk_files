DETAILS:

In June 1962 Frank BARTES reported to our New Orleans DCS
office that Lawrence Joseph LABORDE, Gerald P. HEMMING, Jr., and
Howard Kenneth DAVIS called on him and said they wanted to train
Cuban refugees as guerrilla fighters and demolition experts for
use in Cuba. BARTES reached an agreement with LABORDE who, he said,
was anti-CIA. : :

Subject was head of the New Orleans Cuban Revolutionary
Council. A "“States-Item" article for 21 July 1962 reported that
Gerald P. HEMMING, aka Jerry PATRICK, "showed up in New Orleans
apparently at the invitation of local Cuban Revolutionary Council
leaders and other Cubans who wanted to take direct action against
CASTRO." The article related how "PATRICK" made regular trips in and
out of New Orleans and was supplied with machine guns, explosives and
other military supplies. HEMMING, aka PATRICK, agreed to set up a
training base at Lake Ponchartrain but the Miami CRC headquarters
nixed this base for undisclosed reasons in July 1962, according to
the "STATES-ITEM" account.
