Civil Action No. 81-2543 TAF

v.

DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, et al..

Defendants.

DECLARATION OF JOHN F. PEREIRA

CHIEF, HISTORICAL REVIEW GROUP

CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY

I, JOHN F. PEREIRA, hereby declare and say:

1. I am the Chief of the Historical Review Group (HRG) of

the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA of Agency) • I have held

this position since the HRG was established in April, 1992. My

responsibilities include management of the Historical Review

Program, supervising the staff of the HRG, and directing

coordination of the review process with both Agency components

and other agencies.

2. I make the following statements based upon my personal

knowledge, and upon information made available to me in my

official capacity. I submit this declaration in response to

the Plaintiff's Motion To Compel Defendants To Reprocess All'

Records At Issue In This Case.

3. The Agency's Historical Review Program was established

by the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) to make

---

## Page 5

13-00000

significant historical information available to the public

without damage to the national.security interests of the United

States.

The Program operates pursuant to the policies and

procedures approved by the DCI on April 28, 1992 and to be

published in Agency regulation. HR 70-14. Pursuant to these

policies and procedures, the Agency will transfer records

declassified and approved for release under the Program to the

National Archives and Records Administration for public use.

4. The HRG is responsible for the declassification review

of records under the Program in accordance with the policies

and procedures approved by the DCI and additional guidelines

that may be promulgated by the Director, Center for the Study

of Intelligence, with the approval of the DCI. The HRG is

required to consult with the Agency Archivist and responsible

directorate and DCI area Information Review Officers during the

declassification review process. The policies and procedures

prescribe an intra-agency appellate procedure by which Agency

components may appeal determinations by the HRG that certain

records or portions of records qualify for declassification

under the Program. The final appellate authority regarding

declassification decisions under the Program is the DCI.

5. Under the Historical Review Program, individual

documents will be released in full, withheld in full, or

released in part.. When a document cannot be released in full,

the HRG will make an effort to sanitize the document by

deleting those portions that may not be declassified, or that

---

## Page 6

13-00000

may not be made public for other lawful reasons. However,

under the policies and procedures approved by the DCI, efforts

to sanitize documents

will be made only when the effort will

not unduly slow the pace of the review, will not obscure the

record's essential significance, and will not distort the

document's bibliographical identity. Documents that cannot be

sanitized according to these criteria will be withheld in full

under the Program.

6. The first" group of records to be reviewed under the

Program has been selected by the DCI. He has directed the HRG

to review for declassification under the Program all CIA

records related to the assassination of President John F.

Kennedy. The HRG is presently reviewing these materials as a

priority matter. However, the HRG is also reviewing materials

relating to other matters of historical interest. The

materials relating to the assassination of President Kennedy

comprise approximately 63 boxes of documents and one box

containing 72 or 73 reels of microfilmed documents. We

estimate that the total number of pages involved to be

approximately 250,000 to 300,000. We estimate that

approximately 27 percent are documents originated by other

government agencies with which the HRG will need to coordinate

before declassifying or sanitizing these documents.

7. I currently estimate that the HRG will take

approximately six to twelve months to review the documents

related to the assassination of President Kennedy. This time

3

period does not include the time it will take to coordinate

other-agency documents with their originating agencies.

My

estimate

also does not include the time period for any appeals

that Agency components may initiate regarding decisions by the

HRG to declassify documents.

I declare, under penalty of perjury, that the foregoing is true

and correct.

Executed this 13th day of July 1992.

Dear Mr. Judge:

This is to acknowledge receipt of your 14 August 1992

letter wherein you requested an amendment of your earlier

request (F92-1267) by adding to the original query the

following:

"I)[l]ists or indexes of all materials concerning

Lee Harvey Oswald

and the assassination of President Kennedy

that have been released under the provisions of the fola...

2) Illocation and hours and terms of public access to the

FOIA-reguired reading room for such documents.

3) [a] copy of all documents on the topics mentioned above

that have been declassified under the Historical Review Program

but not transferred to NARA for public availability" [with the

exception of the 124 pages of material in the Oswald

pre-assassination file which you indicated that you have

obtained].

4) [a]n annual list of all documents declassified under

the Historical Review Program and transferred to the NARA when

such a list is compiled."

This request for additional information has been assigned

a separate reference number, F92-1724, and all future

correspondence with respect

to the additional information

requested will be addressed accordingly.

With respect to Item l of your request, enclosed are

machine printouts listing previously released documents on the

subjects of John F. Kennedy and Lee Harvey Oswald. Please

us,

and we will gladly reproduce the items you choose for a

cost of

ten cents per page less the first 100 pages to which

you are entitled free of charge.

A copy of our schedule of

fees is also enclosed for your information.

With respect to Item 2 of your request, this agency offers

its reading room in those instances where documents have been

released but have yet to be indexed in our system of previously

released material.

The material you have requested has been

indexed and the printouts are enclosed for your personal use.

For your information, however, the reading room is located in

Rosslyn and is open Monday through Friday from 7:30 a.m. to

5 p.m.

We do request that appointments be made at least two

weeks in advance.

With respect to Item 3 of your reguest, other than the 124

pages of material which you have received, no additional

information has been declassified under the Historical Review

Program at this time.

However, this office has been informed

that it is expected that the review of six linear feet of

material from the Oswald file will be complete and subsequently

transferred to the National Archives and Records Administration

(NARA) within a month for availability to the public.

We are unable to assist you with Item 4 of your request as :

we are unable to accept a request for material which does not

exist.

As we advised you on 29 June 1992 with respect to your

F92-1267 request, we have been advised that no such lists have

ave chat the da ena

been compiled to date, but that the Agency does intend to

publish

an annual index through the Historical Review Program

which will identify CIA documents released in whole or in part

during the preceding year and which were subseguently

request at this time.

With respect to your request for a fee waiver, since the

material listed on

the enclosed printouts has been previously

released

to numerous requesters and is already in the public

domain, its re-release would not contribute significantly to

the public understanding of the operations and activities of

the United States

Government.

Therefore, your request for a

fee waiver is denied and you will be required to pay copying

costs as described above.

This

is a follow-up to our discussion of 25 September,

in connection with

the Cahn case, regarding the need for prior

coordination between OGC and CSI

when materials under

historical review are also the subject of ongoing litigation.

There seems to have been some confusion over the release of

material to the National Archives last week, and I agree that

we should ensure a mutual understanding about how the process

will work in the future.

2.

As I indicated, it is essential that OGC review, prior

to release.

the Agency's

determination to withhold material

reviewed

under the Historical Review Program (HRP) if the

material is the subject of ongoing litigation.. I understand

your concern that the HRP material be reviewed and, if

declassified, released as quickly as possible in order to

implement the DCI's mandate.

My objective is to ensure the

legal sufficiency of the Agency/HRP position, as well as to

address any inconsistencies in the positions

taken by other

components on material involved in the litigation.

It is clear that there will need to be further

discussion about coordinating releases under FOIA and the HRP

to sort out how the process should work.

For example, it has

been Agency policy in connection with FOIA requests and related

litigation to avoid piece-meal releases whereby some material

is released before the remaining information that is subject tr

try to establish some ground

rules for the future.

FROM:

SUBJECT:

James i. Lesar v. CIA, NO. 92-2215 (D.D.C.) .

Case Dismissed Without Prejudice, F91-1334

1. During a status call today to discuss the subject

Freedom of Information Act case, the judge, unexpectedly,

dismissed the case without prejudice.

Plaintiff may orally

reinstate the case within 90 days. The judge dismissed the case

after the parties, at his direction, had met outside his chambers

to discuss a way to resolve the case.

2.

Despite the dismissal, and because it is without

prejudice, the parties

agreed to attempt to resolve the FOIA

request as follows.

Mr. Lesar will provide the Agency with a

letter that specifically defines what he means by "any executive

conference of CIA officials" and that narrows the time frame of

his request.

CIA will then review the letter and determine

whether and how it can respond.

3.

Mr. Lesar said he used the term "executive conference"

From the discussions, it sounds like Mr. Lesar is looking for

minutes of Executive Committee meetings. He also indicated that

he is most interested in the period late-1963 until 1980.

HOwever,

we will wait until Mr.

Lesar provides us with his

letter.

For now, no

Dear Rich:

Thank you for your letter of December 23, 1992, outlining de-

fendants' counter-proposal for settlement of

the above case.

In general, the settlement terms you have set forth are ac-

ceptable to my client.

There are, however, two additional matters

which must be included in any settlement agreement. The first con-

cerns attorney's fees. My client insists that he will not settle

this case without an acceptable provision for payment of attorney's

The amount of attorney's fees at issue is not great, a

little over 56,000, so I hope that this issue will not be an ob-

consent and request that the cIA not process the draft study en-

Section 5, (c) (1), of the "President John F. Kennedy

Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992", signed into law by

former President George Bush on October 26, 1992, reads "not

later than 300 days after the date enactment of this Act, each

Government office shall review, identify and organize each

assassination record in its custody or possession for disclosure

review by the Review Board, and transmission to

the Archivist."

Additionally, subsection (2) (A) directs "in carrying

out paragraph (1), a Government office

shall determine which of

its records are assassination records."

subsection (G) (2), requires this Bureau to "give

priority to the identification, review, and transmission, under

the standards for postponement set forth in this Act, of

assassination records that on the date of enactment of this Act

are the subject of litigation under Section 552 of Title 5,

United

States Code."

Mark A. Allen, on April 6, 1981, requested all records

concerning the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA)

investigation into the assassination of President John F.

Kennedy.

•Allen initiated his law suit in U.s.D.C., D.C. on May

22,1981, demanding the release to him of the requested records.

The Allen litigation clearly falls within the

guidelines of subsection (G) (2) of the JFK Act, therefore, it is

our goal to determine which records fall within the JFK Act

definition of "assassination records". Set forth below are the

criteria which should be utilized to

make a determination:

1.) Any mention of JFK and/or any Kennedy surname;

2 .)

Any document captioned "Assassination of President

John F. Kennedy, Dallas, Texas, November 22,

1963";

3.1

Any information regarding assassination threats

and/or allegations against any State or Federal

Government official;

4.)

. 5.)

Castro;

Information concerning the. Cuban "Bay of Pigs

operation," which

was sanctioned by the Kennedy

Administration;

6.)

being examined by the JFK Task Force.

Assistant General Counsel

Litigation Division, OGC

SUBJECT:

1. Today, I spoke with Rich Brown (DOJ) and Mary Rownan

(NARA) about the Agency's need to get copies of the JFK materials

it had sent to NARA in August/September 1992.

•I advised

Ms. Rownan that the Agency did not retain copies of records that

it had released to NARA in full (such as third-agency material).

Ms. Rownan stated that NARA would not want to return the

documents to CIA, however, CIA could come to NARA and make copies

at 10 cents per page. In order to avoid the costs, I asked

whether the Agency could bring its own copier or own paper.

said we could.

She will try to find space for us to make the

copies. She said she would call John Pereira Monday afternoon.

Ms. Rownan also advised that NARA had not prepared identification

aids for any of this material.

Ms. Rownan advised us that Diane Dimkoff of her office

had received a copy of a letter from Charlie Howell of the House

Administration Conmittee to David Gries demanding that House-

originated materials be turned over to NARA immediately.

Mr. Brown and I stated that the Agency would have to notify the

court before the Agency transferred possession of those

documents.

4.

Ms. Rownan stated that if CIA transferred the House-

originated materials to NARA, NARA would prepare identification

aids and then refer the records containing CIA information back

to CIA for processing under the Assassination Records Collection

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Central Intelligence

FROM:

Elizabeth R. Rindskopf DpH

General Counsel

SUBJECT:

Lesar v. CIA, Request for Determination Whether

to Defend FOIA Litigation on Unreasonableness of

Search

1.

Issue. This memorandum seeks your determination whether

to resist a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) litigation because

the required search would be unreasonable, or, as a matter within

your discretion, to undertake the search.

an ee the

We bring this issue to

your attention because the information sought relates to the

assassination of President Kennedy--a topic that was at the

forefront of DCI Robert Gates announced policy of openness.

2. Recommendation. We recommend you waive the objection

and direct the search be undertaken.

We request your

determination by 2 April 1993, because the Agency must respond to

the complaint by 5 April 1993.

3. Background.

The subject litigation challenges the

Agency's refusal to search the minutes of DCI Morning Meetings

from 22 November 1963 through 31 December 1979 for information

pertaining either to the assassination of President John F.

Kennedy, or any investigation into that assassination. The

minutes of DCI Morning Meetings are not indexed, but only filed

in chronological order.

Therefore, the Agency would have to read

every page of all minutes for a 16 year period. Until the mid-

1970s, DCI Morning Meetings were held every morning.

After that

time they were held weekly.

The DCI/IRO estimates that the

minutes for this period of time will amount to eight linear feet

of paper and that it would take one person 72 uninterrupted

workhours to review this amount of material. There is no

guarantee that much, if any, responsive information will be found

if the material is searched. If responsive information is

identified, additional time would be necessary to process the

responsive

pages.

4.

The Agency attempted to resolve this dispute informally

by offering to search any 36 months during the 16 year period

identified by plaintiff.

The DCI/IRO believed a search limited

to 36 months would not be unreasonable. However, plaintiff

rejected this offer.

SUBJECT: Lesar v. CIA, Request for Determination Whether to

Defend FOIA Litigation on Unreasonableness of Search

The Law. Under the FOIA, a request must be sufficiently

specific to permit a professional

agency employee familiar with

the subject area to locate the record with a reasonable amount of

effort.

The Department of Justice is prepared to file a motion

to dismiss the lawsuit on the grounds the effort required to

locate the responsive records is unreasonable because there is no

index for the minutes of DCI Morning Meetings.

thus, Agency

employees would have to read eight feet of paper for

information

that may not even be there. However, Judge Richey has this case

and he could decide either that the burden is not unreasonable,

or that any unreasonable burden is caused by the Agency's failure

to index these records.

Policy.

As a matter of discretion, you can accept the

burden of an unreasonable search. Former DCI Gates recognized

the public interest in any Agency holdings on the assassination.

Further, the Congress passed, and President Bush signed, the

President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of

1992 (ARCA). Under the ARCA, the Agency must process for release

to the National Archives all records pertaining to the

assassination of President Kennedy.

The Historical Review Group

(HRG) is currently reviewing assassination material collected as

part of the House Assassination Committee's investigation.

appears that the Agency did not search the minutes of DCI Morning

Meetings as part of the House's investigation, and the HRG does

not currently plan to search those records.

However, the ARCA

directs the establishment of a Review Board that can

subpoena

records from government agencies.

It is foreseeable that the

Review Board (not yet established) may subpoena the minutes,

possibly at the suggestion of the plaintiff if the Agency

successfully defends this litigation.

If a subpoena were issued,

the Agency would have to conduct the search. Further, the

plaintiff could send the Agency another FOIA request for the

minutes of DCI Morning Meetings without regard to subject matter.

Such a request would clearly be proper and obviously more

burdensome to process.

7: If you agree that the Agency should search this material

for information related to the assassination of President

Kennedy, a future FOIA requester might argue that the Agency can

no longer claim that a search of the minutes for other subject

matters would be unreasonable.

The Agency could respond to this

indument on the basis the ARCA created an duty to search

independent of the FOIA.

Dear Ms. Moreau:

This letter advises you that the Director of Central -

„Intelligence has determined, as a matter of policy, to direct the

Agency to search the minutes of DCI Morning Meetings for

information responsive to the Freedom of Information Act request

underlying the referenced litigation.

Pursuant to our conversation with James Lesar, the search

will be limited to the minutes for meetings occurring on or

between the dates 22 November 1963 and 31 December 1979.

may constitute

Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992, (ARCA) , Pub. I. No.

102-526, 106 Stat. 3443 (October 27, 1992) •

Therefore,

responsive portions probably will be transferred to the Agency's

Historical Review Group (HRG) for processing under the standards

of the ARCA.

_The ARG, already fully engaged processing the

records at issue in the Allen v. DOD and AARC V. CIA cases:

probably will not be able to address this information until late

summer or early fall 1993.

Under the ARCA, the Agency has until

22 August 1993 to complete its review of identified assassination

records. The HRG is making its best possible effort to meet that

deadline.

In light of the Director's decision, I see our options for

responding to this litigation as:

(1) moving to dismiss the case for failure to exhaust

administrative remedies--no administrative appeal. It

successiul, this would remove plaintiff's argument that he

is entitled to some expedited treatment under the ARCA.

(2) moving for an Open America stay on a first-in,

first-out basis.

There are a number of FOIA requests that

predate the one at issue in this case.

For instance, the

Allen request predates this one and,

therefore, should be

processed first, even if the litigation is settled.

provide him with free copies of whatever responsive portions

of the minutes are located and released under the ARCA. In

litigation with prejudice.

Each option has its own merits. Please call me so we may

discuss these courses of action.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT:

Allen v. DOD, AARC v. CIA, and Lesar v. CIA, Meeting

with Jim Lesar

The

purpose of the meeting was to discuss settling the three subject

with ri a the met ing

with Richard Brown and Pamela Moreau of DOJ and Jim Lesar.

FOIA litigations.

DoJ will begin drafting settlement agreements

to dismiss all three cases with prejudice.

2. With respect to the Allen/AARC cases, Mr. Brown informed

Mr. Lesar of the meeting with NARA,and the House.

Charles

Howell, Chief Counsel to the Housé Committee on Administration,

had promised to propose to his principals that the House send

NARA a letter.

That letter would authorize NARA to permit CIA to

process House-originated materials before sending them to NARA

and would direct that the entire segregated collection be stored

together.

Mr. Brown advised Mr. Lesar that upon NARA's receipt

of this letter, the Agency would be in a position to agree to the

following settlement terms:

Within 30 days' of signing the settlement agreement,

CIA will provide Mr. Lesar with copies of the materials

already sent to NARA last summer, minus the one box of

third-agency material that needs

to be processed.

With respect to the remaining Executive branch material

in the collection:

A copy of documents to be released with no

redactions will be provided to Mr. Lesar, with a copy

of the documents' identification aids, within five

working days after it is transmitted to NARA.

A copy of documents to be released with redactions

will be provided to Mr. Lesar, with a copy of the

documents' identification aid, within five working days

after it is transmitted to the Review Board. If the

SUBJECT: Allen v. DOD, AARC v. CIA, and Lesar v. CIA, Meeting

with Jim Lesar

Review Board orders additional information released,

and no appeal is taken to the President, a copy of the

new version of the document will be provided to

Mr. Lesar within five working days after it is

transmitted to NARA.

If a document is withheld in its entirety, a copy

of the identification aid, if possible, will be

provided to Mr. Lesar within five working days after

the documents is transmitted to the review board.

With respect to House-originated material in the

collection, CIA will obtain a copy of the version of the

document to be made available to the public at NARA and

provide that copy to Mr. Lesar, free of charge, within five

working days after it is made publicly available by NARA.

In consideration of the above, Mr. Lesar will dismiss

both the Allen case and the AARC /case with prejudice.

However,

DOJ will permit him to litigate his entitlement to attorney's

Mr. Lesar agreed to the above.

He

did, however, want some commitment from the House that it would

direct NARA to give priority processing to all House-originated

materials in CIA's segregated collection. I explained to

Mr. Lesar that the House material was not segregated and

therefore, NARA could not process the documents until it received

them from us. Further, CIA would send the materials to NARA by

the box and would not segregate House materials to ship

separately.

I advised Mr. Lesar that the archival integrity of

the collection was

of particular importance to the House.

seemed satisfied with this explanation and, I think, will drop

this new demand for expeditious processing by NARA of all the

House documents.

4.

Mr. Lesar asked how the Agency was coming with its

processing.

I advised him that we were still trying to work out

technical problems with the software NARA sent us to prepare the

identification aids.

Rich Brown then joked that we probably

would not have a Review Board appointed until 1995 anyway.

5. With respect to the Lesar v. CIA case, Mr. Lesar agreed

to settle that case on the following terms:

the minutes of DCI Morning Meetings that pertain to the

assassination of President Kennedy or to investigations into that

Act and any instructions given to agency employees on

implementation of the Act."

We can search for information responsive to your request.

With respect to your request for a fee waiver, we have reviewed

your request and have determined that the information you seek

Accordingly, we have accepted your request

which will be

processed in accordance with the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. § 552, as

amended, and the CIA Information Act, 50 U.S.C. § 431.

Our

search will be for documents in existence as of and through the

date of this acceptance letter.

The heavy volume of FOIA requests received by the Agency

has created delays in processing.

Since we cannot respond

within the 10 working days stipulated by the Act, you have the

right to consider this as a denial and may appeal to the CIA

Information Review Committee.

however, to have us continue processing your request and respond

continue processin,

It would seem more reasonable,

as soon as we can.

You can appeal any denial of records

time.

Unless we hear from you otherwise, we will assume

that

you agree, and we will proceed on this basis.

Our records show that we conducted a thorough search

• under the FOIA for records pertaining to the subject of your

request on behalf of a previous requester.

We located

materiäl which was reviewed and denied in its entirety.

However.

since your letter mentions allegations of an

association of the subject of your request with the

assassination of President Kennedy, you should know that this

Agency's records on the assassination of President Kennedy

have been re-reviewed under the narrower nondisclosure

provisions of the President John F. Kennedy Assassination

These re-reviewed records

have been transferred to the National Archives and Records

of these records you should submit your request to NARA at

the following address:

Archives Review Branch

Records Declassification Division

Room 18W

Also in accordance with the Act, those records whose

public disclosure in whole or in part has been recommended

for postponement are now undergoing further re-review by the

Presidentially appointed Assassination Records Review Board

(ARRB) .

The ARRB process is likely to result in more public
