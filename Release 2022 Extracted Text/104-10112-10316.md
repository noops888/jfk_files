4. Reference is also made to a 24 March 1975 memorandum

in the file of the above mentioned former Agency employee,

Walter

Josef MACKEM, specifically suggesting MACKEM's recent involve-

ment in paramilitary activities--which would appear to coincide with

the activities of "Friends of Abaco"--at a place in Georgia, not far

from Atlanta. This memorandum also relates that MACKEM is cur-

rently employed as a private investigator in the Washington, D. C. area.

5. All of the foregoing would suggest that Walter Josef MACKEM

and Jokn Patrick MULDOON are employed by Security Consultants,

International, a subsidiary of the Atlanta based Central Investigative

Agendy, Inc., and that Central Investigative Agency, Inc., is involved

in the activities of "Friends of Abaco" and AIM.

6. The Central Investigative Agency, Inc., file also contains

a copy of a cable (IN 304568), dated 11 July 1974, from the Atlanta) 10

DDO/FR Base reporting in substance that information had been received

through the FBI originating with Howard GIBSON (believed identical with

the aforementioned Howard R. GIBSON), that the Washington, D.C. office

of the Central Investigative Agency, Inc., had been sub-leased to the

Drug Enforcement Administration and was being used by the Central

Intelligence Agency as an electronic surveillance listening post. GIBSON

claimed that this activity was headed by a Central Intelligence Agency

officer, one CONEEN (phonetic).

CQNEEN is believed identical with former Staff employee

Lucien

CONEIN Who was last known to be working with the Drug

Enforcement Administration. The file of the aforementioned Walter

Josef MACKEM reflects that he was detailed by the Agency to the Drug

Enforcement Administration from February 1972 to October 1973; and

that as of September 1973, CONEIN was an associate of MACKEM.

8. It is believed that the employment of former Agency employees

by "CIA" and the backing of "CIA" of the Abaco Independence Movement

could cause future concern for this Agency.
