MEMORANDUM

SUBJECT : (Thomas L, Roberts)

| 1, Mr. Papich communicated by telephone at 10:00 a.m.;

The New York office of the FBI has learned
informally from an Assistant District Attorney
(unidentified) on Hogan's staff that the New York
District Attorney has received a complaint
against Subject for absconding with funds received
from negligence cases. The allegation is that
Subject converted the settlements to his own use,

i did not pay them--less his own fees--to the cHents
concerned, The complainant or complainants and
the lawyer or spokesman for them are not identified.
It is added, however, that whoever made the com-
plaint to the New York District Attorney alec
specified that there was reason to believe that
Subject wes connected with a U.S. Agency. If this
was so, it was further indicated, complainants
would be willing to discuss the situation.

{ 2, These are all of the details that Sam has received over the
telephone from New York, I asked him specifically for the identification--
if the FBI could make it--of the attorney or attorneys who made the
complaint to the New York District Attorney's office.

3, There was nothing in this communication to relate Subject's
case with the Itkin matter, However, it is clear that the allegation made
against Subject is identical with a large number that have been of interest
to the New York District Attorney in connection with Itkin,
