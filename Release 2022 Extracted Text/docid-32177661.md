Findings of the Select Committee on
Assassinations in the Assassination

of President John F. Kennedy in Dallas,
Texas, November 22, 1963

A. Lee Harvey Oswald fired three
shots at President John F.
Kennedy. The second and third
shots he fired struck the President.
The third shot he fired killed the
President.

1.

President Kennedy was struck
by two rifle shots fired from
behind him.

The shots that struck President
Kennedy from behind him were fired
from the sixth floor window of the
southeast corner of the Texas
School Book Depository building.

Lee Harvey Oswald owned the rifle
that was used to fire the shots
from the sixth floor window of the
southeast corner of the Texas
School Book Depository building.

Lee Harvey Oswald, shortly before
the assassination, had access to
and was present on the sixth floor
of the Texas School Book Depository
building.

Lee Harvey Oswald's other actions
tend to support the conclusion
that he assassinated President
Kennedy.


B. Scientific acoustical evidence
establishes a high probability
that two gunmen fired at President
John F. Kennedy. Other scientific
evidence does not preclude the
Possibility of two gunmen firing
at the President. Scientific
evidence negates some specific
conspiracy allegations.

C. The Committee believes, on the
basis of the evidence available
to it, that President John F.
Kennedy was probably assassinated
as a result of a conspiracy. The
Committee is unable to identify
the other gunman or the extent of
the conspiracy.

1. The Committee believes, on the
basis of the evidence available
to it, that the Soviet Government
was not involved in the assassina-
tion of President Kennedy.

2. The Committee believes, on the
basis of the evidence available
to it, that the Cuban Govern-
ment was not involved in the
assassination of President
Kennedy.

3. The Committee believes, on the

+ basis of the evidence available
to it, that anti-Castro Cuban
groups, as groups, were not
involved in the assassination
of President Kennedy, but that the
available evidence does not
preclude the possibility that
individual members may have been
involved.

4. The Committee believes, on the
basis of the evidence available
to it, that the national
syndicate of organized crime,
as a group, was not involved in
the assassination of President
Kennedy, but that the available evidence
does not preclude the possibility
that individual members may have
been involved.

5. The Secret Service, Federal Bureau
of Investigation and Central
Intelligence Agency were not
involved in the assassination of
President Kennedy.

NW 68262 Docld:32177661 Page 11

So

Agencies and departments of the

United States Government performed
with varying degrees of competency

in the fulfillment of their duties.
President John F. Kennedy did not
receive adequate protection. A
thorough and reliable investigation
into the responsibility of Lee Harvey
Oswald for the assassination of
President John F. Kennedy was conducted.
The investigation into the possibility
of conspiracy in the assassination was
inadequate. The conclusions of the
investigations were arrived at in good
faith, but presented in a fashion that
was too definitive.

1. The Secret Service was deficient
in the performance of its duties.

(a) The Secret Service possessed
information that was not
properly analyzed, investi-
gated or used by the Secret
Service in connection with
the President's trip to
Dallas; in addition, Secret
Service agents in the motor-
cade were inadequately pre-
pared to protect the President
from a sniper.

(b) The responsibility of the
Secret Service to investigate
the assassination was terminated
when the Federal Bureau of
Investigation assumed primary
investigative responsibility.

2. The Department of Justice failed to
exercise initiative in supervising
and directing the investigation by
the Federal Bureau of Investigation
of the assassination.


The Federal: Bureau of Investigation
performed with varying degrees of
competency in the fulfillment of its
duties.

(a) The Federal Bureau of Investigation
adequately investigated Lee Harvey
Oswald prior to the assassination
and properly evaluated the evidence
it possessed to assess his potential
to endanger the public safety in
a national emergency.

(b) The Federal Bureau of Investigation
conducted a thorough and professional
investigation into the responsibility
of Lee Harvey Oswald for the assassina-
tion.

(c) The Federal Bureau of Investigation
failed to investigate adequately
the possibility of a conspiracy to
assassinate the President.

(4) The Federal Bureau of Investigation
was deficient in its sharing of in-
formation with other agencies and
departments.

. 4. The Central Intelligence Agency was
deficient in its collection and sharing
of information both prior to and subsequent
to the assassination.

5. The Warren Commission performed with
varying degrees of competency in the
fulfillment of its duties.

(a) The Warren Commission conducted
a thorough and professional investi-
gation into the responsibility of
Lee Harvey Oswald for the assassination.



(b)

(c)

(a)

-9-

The Warren Commission failed to
investigate adequately the possi-
bility of a conspiracy to assassi-
nate the President. This deficiency
was attributable in part to the
failure of the Commission to receive
all the relevant information that
was in the possession of other
agencies and departments of the
government.

The Warren Commission arrived at
its conclusions, based on the
evidence available to it, in
good faith.

The Warren Commission presented
the conclusions in its report
in a fashion that was too
definitive.

Recommendations of the
Select Committee on Assassinations

Legislative Recommendations

on Issues Involving the
Prohibition, Prevention and
Prosecution of Assassinations

and Federally Cognizable
fomerdes

A. Prohibition and Prevention

1.

The Judiciary Committee should process

for early consideration by the House
legislation that would make the assassina-
tion of a Chief of State of any country,
or his political equivalent, a federal
offense, if the offender is an American
citizen or acts on behalf of an American _
citizen, or if the offender can be located
in the United States.

The Judiciary Committee should process for
early consideration by the House compre-
hensive legislation that would codify,
revise and reform the federal law of
homicide, paying special attention to
vassassinations. The Judiciary Committee
should give appropriate attention to the
related offenses of conspiracy, attempt,
assault and kidnapping in the context of
assassinations. Such legislation should be
processed independently of the general pro-
posals for the codification, revision or
reform of the Federal criminal law. The
Committee should address the following
issues in considering the legislation:

(a) Distinguishing between those persons
who should receive the protection of
federal law because of the official
positions they occupy and those
persons who should receive protection
of federal law only in the performance
of their official duties,

(b) Extending the protection of federal
law to. persons who occupy high
judicial and executive positions,
including Justices of the Supreme
Court and Cabinet officers,

(c) The applicability of these laws to
private individuals in the exercise
Of constitutional rights,

(4) The penalty to be provided for
homicide and the related offenses,
including the applicability and
the constitutionality of the death
penalty,

The basis for the exercise of federal
jurisdiction, including domestic
and extraterritorial reach,

The pre-emption of state jurisdiction
without the necessity of any action
on the part of the Attorney General
where the President is assassinated,

The circumstances under which
federal jurisdiction should pre-
empt state jurisdiction in other
cases,

The power of federal investigative
agencies to require autopsies to be
performed,

The ability of federal investigative
agencies to secure the assistance

of other federal or state agencies,
including the military, other laws
notwithstanding,

The authority to offer rewards
to apprehend the perpetrators of
the crime,

A requirement of forfeiture of the
instrumentalities of the crime,

The condemnation of personal or
ether effects of historical interest,

The advisability of providing,
consistent with the first amendment,
legal trust devices to hold for the
benefit of victims, their families,

or the general treasury, the profits
realized from books, movie rights,

or public appearances by the perpetrator
of the crime, and

The applicability of threat and physical
zone of protection legislation to
persons under the physical protection

of federal investigative or law
enforcement agencies.

The appropriate Committees of the House
should process for early consideration by
the House charter legislation for the
Central Intelligence Agency and Federal
Bureau of Investigation. The Committees
should address the following issues in
considering the charter legislation:

(a) The proper foreign and domestic
intelligence functions of the
intelligence and investigative
agencies of the United States,


-14-

(b) The relationship between the
domestic intelligence functions
and the interference with the
exercise of individual constitutional
rights,

e) The delineation of proper law .
enforcement functions and techniques
including:

(i) the use of informants and
electronic surveillance,

(ii) guidelines to circumscribe
the use of informants or electronic
surveillance to gather intelligence
on, or investigate, groups that
may be exercising first amendment
freedoms, and

(iii) the proper response of intelligence
or investigative agencies where
information is developed that an
dnformant has committed a crime.

(d) Guidelines to consider the circum-
stances, if any, when an investigative
agency or a component of that agency
should be disqualified from taking an

: active role in an investigation because
of an appearance of impropriety growing
out of a particular intelligence or
investigative action,

(e) Definitions of the legislative scope
and extent of “sources and methods”
and the "informant privilege” as a
rationale for the executive branch
withholding information in response
to Congressional or judicial process
or other demand for information,

(£) Institutionalizing efforts to co-

: ordinate the gathering, sharing,
and analysis of intelligence informa-
tion,

(g) Insuring those agencies that primarily
gather intelligence perform their
function so as to serve the needs of
other agencies that primarily engage
in physical protection, and

(h) Implementing mechanisms that would
permit interagency tasking of |
particular functions.

Administrative Recommendations to

-15-

Prosecution

1. The Judiciary Committee should
consider the impact of the provisions
of law dealing with third-party records,
bail and speedy trial as it applies to
both the investigation and prosecution
of federally cognizable homicides.

2. The Judiciary Committee should examine .

recently passed special prosecutor
legislation to determine if its provisions
should be modified to extend them to
presidential assassinations and the
circumstances, if any, under which they
should be applicable to other federally
cognizable homicides.

the Executive

The Department of Justice should re-examine
its contingency plans for the handling of
assassinations and federally cognizable homi-
cides in light of the record and findings of
the Committee. Such an examination should
consider the following issues:

A.

Insuring that its response takes full
advantage of inter and intraagency «

task forces and the strike force approach
to investigations and prosecutions,

Insuring that its response takes full
advantage of the advances of science and
technology, and determining when it should
secure independent panels of scientists

to review or perform necessary scientific
tasks, or secure qualified independent
forensic pathologists to perform a forensic
autopsy,

Insuring that its fair trial/free press
guidelines, consistent with an alleged
offender's right to a fair trial, allow
information about the facts and circum-
stances surrounding an assassination
promptly be made public, and promptly
be corrected when erroneous information
46 mistakenly released, and

Entering at the current time into negotiations
with representatives of the media to secure
voluntary agreements providing that photographs,
audio tapes, television tapes and related
matters, made in and around the site of
assassinations, be made available to the
government by consent immediately following

an assassination.



-16-

III. General Recommendations for
Congressional investigations

aA.

The appropriate Committees of the House
should consider amending the Rules of the
House to provide for a right to appointive
counsel in investigative hearings where a
witness is unable to provide counsel from
private funds.

The appropriate Committees of the House

should examine the Rules of the House governing
the conduct of counsel in legislative and
investigative hearings and consider delineating
guidelines for professional conduct and ethics,
including guidelines to deal with conflicts

of interest in the representation of multiple
witnesses before a Committee.

The Judiciary Committee should examine the
adequacy of federal law as it provides. for

the production of federal and state prisoners
before legislative or investigative committees
under a writ of habeas corpus ad testificandum.

The appropriate Committees of the House should
examine and:clarify the applicability to
Congressional subpoenas of recently enacted
legislative restrictions on access to records
and other documents.

The appropriate Committees of the House should
consider legislation that would authorize

the establishment of a legislative counsel

to conduct litigation on behalf of committees
of the House incident to the investigative

or legislative activities and confer jurisdic-
tion on the United States District Court for
the District of Columbia to hear such lawsuits.

The appropriate committees of the House

should consider if Rule 11 of the House

should be amended, so as to restrict the
current access by all Members of the House

to the classified information in the possession
of any committee.

Iv. Recommendations for Further
Investigation

A.

NW 68262 Docld:32177661 Page 19

The Department of Justice should contract for
the examination of a film taken by Charles

L. Bronson to determine its significance, if
any, to the assassination of President Kennedy.

The National Institute of Law Enforcement

and Criminal Justice of the Department of
Justice and the National Science Foundation
should make a study of the theory and application
of the principles of acoustics to forensic
questions, using the materials available in

the assassination of President John F. Kennedy

as a case study.


NW 68262 Docld:32177661 Page 20

-17-

The Department of Justice should
review the Committee's findings

and report in the assassinations

of President John F. Kennedy and
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and
after completion of the recommended
investigation enumerated in Sections
A and B,.analyze whether further
official investigation is warranted
in either case. The Department of
Justice should report its analysis
to the Judiciary Committee.

Summary of Findings | National Archives

Findings of the Select Committee on Assassinations in the Assassination of Dr. Martin Luther
King, Jr. in Memphis, Tenn. April 4, 1968
A. James Earl Ray fired one shot at Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. The shot killed Dr. King,

1
2

Dr. King was killed by one rifle shot fired from in front of him.

The shot that killed Dr. King was fired from the bathroom window at the rear of a
roominghouse at 422 1/2 South Main Street, Memphis, Tenn.

James Earl Ray purchased the rifle that was used to shoot Dr. King and transported it
from Birmingham, Ala. to Memphis, Tenn., where he rented a room at 422 1/2 South
Main Street, and moments after the assassination, he dropped it near 424 South Main
Street.

It is highly probable that James Earl Ray stalked Dr. King for a period immediately
preceding the assassination.

James Earl Ray fled the scene of the crime immediately after the assassination.
James Earl Ray's alibi for the time of the assassination, his story of "Raoul", and other
allegedly exculpatory evidence are not worthy of belief.

James Earl Ray knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily pleaded guilty to the first
degree murder of Dr. King.

there is a likelihood that James Earl Ray assassinated Dr. Martin Luther King as a result of a
conspiracy.

C. The committee believed on the basis of the evidence available to it, that no private
organizations or individuals, other than those discussed under section B, were involved in
the assassination of Dr. King.

No Federal, State or local government agency was involved in the assassination of Dr. King.

E. The Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation performed with varying
degrees of competency and legality in the fulfillment of their duties.

The Department of Justice failed to supervise adequately the Domestic Intelligence
Division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. In addition, the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, in the Domestic Intelligence Division's COINTELPRO campaign against Dr.
King, grossly abused and exceeded its legal authority and failed to consider the
possibility that actions threatening bodily harm to Dr. King might be encouraged by the
program.

The Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of investigation performed a thorough
investigation into the responsibility of James Earl Ray for the assassination of Dr. King,
and conducted a thorough fugitive investigation, but failed to investigate adequately
the possibility of conspiracy in the assassination. The Federal Bureau of Investigation
manifested a lack of concern for constitutional rights in the manner in which it
conducted parts of the investigation.

|. Legislative recommendations on issues involving the prohibition, prevention and prosecution of
assassinations and federally cognizable homicides
a. Prohibition and prevention--

1. The Judiciary Committee should process for early consideration by the House
legislation that would make the assassination of a Chief of State of any country, or his
political equivalent, a Federal offense, if the offender is an American citizen or acts on
behalf of an American citizen, or if the offender can be located in the United States.

2. The Judiciary Committee should process for early consideration by the House
comprehensive legislation that would codify, revise and reform the Federal law of
homicide, paying special attention to assassinations. The Judiciary Committee should
give appropriate attention to the related offenses of conspiracy, attempt, assault and
kidnaping in the context of assassinations. Such legislation should be processed
independently of the general proposals for the codification, revision or reform of the
Federal criminal law. The committee should address the following issues in considering
the legislation:

a. Distinguishing between those persons who should receive the protection of Federal
law because of the official positions they occupy and those persons who should
receive protection of Federal law only in the performance of their official duties,

b. Extending the protection of Federal law to persons who occupy high judicial and
executive positions, including Justices of the Supreme Court and Cabinet officers,

c. The applicability of these laws to private individuals the exercise of constitutional
rights,

d. The penalty to be provided for homicide and the related offenses, including the
applicability and the constitutionality of the death penalty,

e. The basis for the exercise of Federal jurisdiction, including domestic and
extraterritorial reach,

f. The preemption of State jurisdiction without the necessity of any action on the part
of the Attorney General where the President is assassinated,

g. The circumstances under which Federal jurisdiction should preempt State
jurisdiction in other cases,

h. The power of Federal investigative agencies to require autopsies to be performed,

he ability of Federal investigative agencies to secure the assistance of other
ederal or State agencies, including the military, other laws notwithstanding,

he authority to offer rewards to apprehend the perpetrators of the crime,
requirement of forfeiture of the instrumentalities of the crime,
he condemnation of personal or other effects of historical interest,

m. The advisability of providing, consistent with the first amendment, legal trust
devices to hold for the benefit of victims, their families, or the general treasury, the
profits realized from books, movie rights, or public appearances by the perpetrator
of the crime, and

n. The applicability of threat and physical zone of protection legislation to persons
under the physical protection of Federal investigative or law enforcement agencies.

Investigation. The committees should address the following issues in considering the
charter legislation:

a. The proper foreign and domestic intelligence functions of the intelligence and
investigative agencies of the United States,

b. The relationship between the domestic intelligence functions and the interference
with the exercise of individual constitutional rights,

c. The delineation of proper law enforcement functions and techniques including:
i, The use of informants and electronic surveillance,

ii. guidelines to circumscribe the use of informants or electronic surveillance to
gather intelligence on, or investigate, groups that may be exercising first
amendment freedoms, and

iii. the proper response of intelligence or investigative agencies where information
is developed that an informant has committed a crime,

d, Guidelines to consider the circumstances, if any, when an investigative agency ora
component of that agency should be disqualified from taking an active role in an
investigation because of an appearance of impropriety growing out of a particular
intelligence or investigative action,

e. Definitions of the legislative scope and extent of "sources and methods" and the
"informant privilege" as a rationale for the executive branch withholding
information in response to congressional or judicial process or other demand for
information,

f. Institutionalizing efforts to coordinate the gathering, sharing, and analysis of
intelligence information,

g. Insuring those agencies that primarily gather intelligence perform their function so
as to serve the needs of other agencies that primarily engage in physical protection,
and

h. Implementing mechanisms that would permit inter-agency tasking of particular
functions.

b. Prosecution--

1. The Judiciary Committee should consider the impact of the provisions of law dealing
with third-party records, bail and speedy trial as it applies to both the investigation and
prosecution of federally cognizable homicides.

2. The Judiciary Committee should examine recently passed special prosecutor legislation
to determine if its provisions should be modified to extend them to Presidential
assassinations and the circumstances, if any, under which they should be applicable to
other federally cognizable homicides.

Il. Administrative recommendations to the Executive

The Department of Justice should reexamine its contingency plans for the handling of
assassinations and federally cognizable homicides in light of the record and findings of the
committee. Such an examination should consider the following issues:

a. Insuring that its response takes full advantage of inter- and intra-agency task forces and the
strike force approach to investigations and prosecutions,

b. Insuring that its response takes full advantage of the advances of science and technology,
and determining when it should secure independent panels of scientists to review or
perform necessary scientific tasks, or secure qualified independent forensic pathologists to
perform a forensic autopsy,

c. Insuring that its fair trial/free press guidelines consistent with an alleged offender's right to
a fair trial, allow information about the facts and circumstances surrounding an
assassination promptly be made public, and promptly be corrected when erroneous
information is mistakenly released, and

d. Entering at the current time into negotiations with representatives of the media to secure
voluntary agreements providing that photographs, audio tapes, television tapes, and
related matters, made in and around the site of assassinations, be made available to the
Government by consent immediately following an assassination.

Ill, General recommendations for congressional investigations

A. The appropriate committees of the House should consider amending the rules of the House
to provide for a right to appointive counsel in investigative hearings where a witness is
unable to provide counsel from private funds.

B. The appropriate committees of the House should examine the rules of the House governing
the conduct of counsel in legislative and investigative hearings and consider delineating
guidelines for professional conduct and ethics, including guidelines to deal with conflicts of
interest in the representation of multiple witnesses before a committee.

C. The Judiciary Committee should examine the adequacy of Federal law as it provides for the
production of Federal and State prisoners before legislative or investigative committees
under a writ of habeas corpus ad testificandum.

D. The appropriate committees of the House should examine and clarify the applicability to
congressional subpoenas of recently enacted legislative restrictions on access to records
and other documents.

E. The appropriate committees of the House should consider legislation that would authorize
the establishment of a legislative counsel to conduct litigation on behalf of committees of
the House incident to the investigative or legislative activities and confer jurisdiction on the
U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to hear such lawsuits.

F. The appropriate committees of the House should consider if rule 11 of the House should be
amended, so as to restrict the current access by all Members of the House to the classified
information in the possession of any committee.

IV. Recommendations for further investigation

A. The Department of Justice should contract for the examination of a film taken by Charles L.
Bronson to determine its significance if any, to the assassination of President Kennedy.

B. The National Institute of Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice of the Department of
Justice and the National Science Foundation should make a study of the theory and
application of the principles of acoustics to forensic questions, using the materials available
in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy as a case study.

C. The Department of Justice should review the committee's findings and report in the
assassinations of President John F. Kennedy and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and after
completion of the recommended investigation enumerated in sections A and B, analyze
whether further official investigation is warranted in either case. The Department of Justice
should report its analyses to the Judiciary Committee.
