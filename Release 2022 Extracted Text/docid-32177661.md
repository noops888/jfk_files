Recommendations of the

Select Committee on Assassinations

I.

Legislative Recommendations

on Issues Involving

the

Prohibition,

Prevention and

Prosecution of Assassinations

and Federally Cognizable

Homicides

A. Prohibition and Prevention

1. The Judiciary Committee should process

for early consideration by the House

legislation that would make the assassina-

tion of a Chief of State of any country,.

or his political equivalent, a federal

offense, if the offender is

an American

or acts on behalf of an American

citizen, or if the offender can be located

in the United States.

2.

The Judiciary Committee should process for

early consideration by the House compre-

hensive legislation that would codify,

revise and reform the federal law of

homicide, paying special attention to

,assassinations.

The Judiciary Comnittee

should give appropriate attention to the

related offenses of conspiracy, attempt,

assault and kidnapping in the context of

assassinations.

Such legislation should be

processed independently of the general pro-

posals for the codification, revision or

reform of the Federal criminal law.

The

Committee should address the following

issues in considering the legislation:

(a)

(0)

Distinguishing between those persons

who should receive the protection of

federal law because of the official

positions they occupy and those

persons who should receive protection

of federal law only in the performance

of their official duties,

Extending the protection of federal

law to persons who occupy high

judicial and executive positions,

including Justices of the Supreme

Court and Cabinet officers,

(c)

The applicability of these laws to

private

individuals in the exercise

of constitutional rights,

(d)

The penalty to be provided for

homicide and the related offenses,.

including the applicability and

the constitutionality of the death

penalty,

and extraterritorial reach,

(f)

there the President is assassinated.

(g)

The circumstances under which

cases,

(h)

the power of federal investigativ

gencies to require autopsies to b

(i)

The ability of federal investigative

agencies to secure the assistance

of other federal or state agencies,

including the military, other laws

notwithstanding,

(j)

The authority to offer rewards

to apprehend the perpetrators of

the crime,

(k)

A requirement of forfeiture of the

instrumentalities of the crime,

(1)

The condemnation of personal or

other effects of historical interest,

(m) The advisability of providing,

consistent with the first amendment,

legal trust devices to hold for the

benefit of victims, their families,

or the general treasury, the profits

realized from books, movie rights,

or public appearances by the perpetrator

of the crime, and

(n)

The applicability of threat and physical

zone of protection legislation to

persons under the physical protection

of federal investigative or law

enforcement agencies.

The appropriate Committees of the House

should process for early consideration by

the House charter legislation for the

Central Intelligence Agency and Federal

Bureau of Investigation.

The Committees

should address the following issues in

considering the charter legislation:

(a)

The proper foreign and domestic

intelligence functions of the

intelligence and investigative

agencies of the United States,

B.

Prosecution

The Judiciary Committee should

consider the impact of the provisions

of law dealing with third-party records.

bail and speedy trial as it applies to

both the investigation and prosecution

of federally cognizable homicides.

2. The Judiciary Committee should examine .

passed special prosecutor

legislation to determine if its provisions

should be modified to extend them to

presidential assassinations and the

circumstances,

if any, under which they

should be applicable to other federally

cognizable homicides.

Administrative Recommendations to

the Executive

The Department of Justice should re-examine

its contingency plans for the handling of

assassinations and federally cognizable homi-

cides in light of the record and findings of

the Committee.

Such an examination should

consider the following issues:

A. Insuring that its response takes full

advantage of inter

and intraagency'

task forces and the strike force approach

to investigations and prosecutions,

B.

Insuring that its response takes full

advantage of the advances of science and

technology, and determining when it should

secure independent panels of scientists

to review or perform necessary scientific

or secure qualified independent

forensic pathologists to perform a forensic

autopsy.

C.

Insuring that its fair trial/free press

guidelines,

consistent with an alleged

offender's right to a fair trial,

allow

Information about the facts and circum-

stances surrounding an assassination

promptly be made public, and promptly

be corrected when erroneous information

Is mistakenly released, and

government by

consent immediately following

an assassination.

III.

General Recommendations for

Congressional Investigations

A.

The appropriate Committees of the House

should consider amending

the Rules of the

House to provide for a right to appointive

counsel in investigative hearings where a

witness is unable to provide counsel from

private funds.

в.

The appropriate Committees of the House

should examine the Rules of the House governing

the conduct of counsel in legislative and

investigative hearings and consider delineating

guidelines for professional conduct and ethics,

including

guidelines to deal with conflicts

of interest in the representation of multiple

witnesses before a Comnittee.

c. .

The Judiciary Committee should examine the

adequacy of federal law as it provides. for

the production of federal and state prisoners

before legislative or investigative committees

under a writ of habeas corpus ad testificandum.

D.

The appropriate Committees of the House should

examine

and: clarify

the applicability to

Congressional subpoenas of recently enacted

legislative restrictions on access to records

and other documents.

E.

The appropriate Comnittees of the House should

consider legislation that would authorize

the establishment of a legislative counsel

to conduct litigation on behalf of committees

of the House incident to the investigative

or legislative activities and confer jurisdic-

tion on the United States District Court for

the District of Columbia to hear such lawsuits.

F.

The appropriate committees of the House

should consider if Rule ll of the House

should be amended, so as to restrict the

current access by all Members of the House

to the classified information in the possession

of any committee.

IV.

Recommendations for Further

Investigation

A. The Department of Justice should contract for

the examination of a

film taken by Charles

I. Bronson to determine its significance, if

any, to the assassination of President Kennedy.

B.

The National Institute of Law Enforcement

and Criminal Justice of the

Department of

Justice and the National Science Foundation

should make a study of the theory and

application

of the principles of

acoustics to forensic

questions,

using the materials available in

the assassination of President John F. Kennedv

as a case study.

NW 68262 Docld:32177661 Page 19

## Page 20

- 17 -

c.

The Department of Justice should

review the Committee's findings

and report in the assassinations

of President John F. Kennedy and

DI. Martin Luther King, JI., and

after completion of the recommended

investigation enumerated in Sections

A and B, analyze whether further

official investigation is warranted

in either case.

The Department of

Justice should report its analysis

to the Judiciary Committee.

Findings of the Select Committee on Assassinations in the Assassination of Dr. Martin Luther

King, Jr. in Memphis, Tenn. April 4, 1968

A. James Earl Ray fired one shot at Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. The shot killed Dr. King.

1. Dr. King was killed by one rifle shot fired from in front of him.

2. The shot that killed Dr. King was fired from the bathroom window at the rear of a

roominghouse at 422 1/2 South Main Street, Memphis, Tenn.

3. James Earl Ray purchased the rifle that was used to shoot Dr. King and transported it

from Birmingham, Ala. to Memphis, Tenn., where he rented a room at 422 1/2 South

Main Street, and moments atter the assassination, he dropped it near 424 South Main

Street.

4. It is highly probable that James Earl Ray stalked Dr. King for a period immediately

preceding the assassination.

5. James Earl Ray fled the scene of the crime immediately after the assassination.

6. James Earl Ray's alibi for the time of the assassination, his story of "Raoul", and other

allegedly exculpatory evidence are not worthy of belief.

7. James Earl Ray knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily pleaded guilty to the first

degree murder of Dr. King.

B. The committee believes, on the basis of the circumstantial evidence available to it, that

there is a likelihood that James Earl Ray assassinated Dr. Martin Luther King as a result of a

conspiracy.

C. The committee believed on the basis of the evidence available to it, that no private

organizations or individuals, other than those discussed under section B, were involved in

the assassination of Dr. King.

D. No Federal, State or local government agency was involved in the assassination of Dr. King.

E. The Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation performed with varying

degrees of competency and legality in the fulfillment of their duties.

1. The Department of Justice failed to supervise adequately the Domestic Intelligence

Division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. In addition, the Federal Bureau of

Investigation, in the Domestic Intelligence Division's COINTELPRO campaign against Dr.

King, grossly abused and exceeded its legal authority and failed to consider the

possibility that actions threatening bodily harm to Dr. King might be encouraged by the

program.

The Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation performed a thorough

investigation into the responsibility of James Earl Ray for the assassination of Dr. King,

and conducted a thorough fugitive investigation, but failed to investigate adequately

the possibility of conspiracy in the assassination. The Federal Bureau of Investigation

manifested a lack of concern for constitutional rights in the manner in which it

conducted parts of the investigation.

Summary of Findings | National Archives

I. Legislative recommendations on issues involving the prohibition, prevention and prosecution of

assassinations and federally cognizable homicides

a. Prohibition and prevention--

1. The Judiciary Committee should process for early consideration by the House

legislation that would make the assassination of a Chief of State of any country, or his

political equivalent, a Federal offense, if the offender is an American citizen or acts on

behalf of an American citizen, or if the offender can be located in the United States.

2. The Judiciary Committee should process for early consideration by the House

comprehensive legislation that would codify, revise and reform the Federal law of

homicide, paying special attention to assassinations. The Judiciary Committee should

give appropriate attention to the related offenses of conspiracy, attempt, assault and

kidnaping in the context of assassinations. Such legislation should be processed

independently of the general proposals for the codification, revision or reform of the

Federal criminal law. The committee should address the following issues in considering

the legislation:

a. Distinguishing between those persons who should receive the protection of Federal

law because of the official positions they occupy and those persons who should

receive protection of Federal law only in the performance of their official duties,

b. Extending the protection of Federal law to persons who occupy high judicial and

executive positions, including Justices of the Supreme Court and Cabinet officers,

c. The applicability of these laws to private individuals the exercise of constitutional

rights,

d. The penalty to be provided for homicide and the related offenses, including the

applicability and the constitutionality of the death penalty,

e. The basis for the exercise of Federal jurisdiction, including domestic and

extraterritorial reach,

f. The preemption of State jurisdiction without the necessity of any action on the part

of the Attorney General where the President is assassinated,

g. The circumstances under which Federal jurisdiction should preempt State

jurisdiction in other cases,

h. The power of Federal investigative agencies to require autopsies to be performed,

i. The ability of Federal investigative agencies to secure the assistance of other

Federal or State agencies, including the military, other laws notwithstanding,

j. The authority to offer rewards to apprehend the perpetrators of the crime,

k. A requirement of forfeiture of the instrumentalities of the crime,

I. The condemnation of personal or other effects of historical interest,

m. The advisability of providing, consistent with the first amendment, legal trust

devices to hold for the benefit of victims, their families, or the general treasury, the

profits realized from books, movie rights, or public appearances by the perpetrator

of the crime, and

n. The applicability of threat and physical zone of protection legislation to persons

under the physical protection of Federal investigative or law enforcement agencies.

3. The appropriate committees of the House should process for early consideration by the

House charter legislation for the Central Intelligence Agency and Federal Bureau of

Summary of Findings | National Archives

Investigation. The committees should address the following issues in considering the

charter legislation:

a. The proper foreign and domestic intelligence functions of the intelligence and

investigative agencies of the United States,

b. The relationship between the domestic intelligence functions and the interference

with the exercise of individual constitutional rights,

c. The delineation of proper law enforcement functions and techniques including:

i. The use of informants and electronic surveillance,

ii. guidelines to circumscribe the use of informants or electronic surveillance to

gather intelligence on, or investigate, groups that may be exercising first

amendment freedoms, and

ill. the proper response of intelligence or investigative agencies where information

is developed that an informant has committed a crime,

a. Guidelines to consider the circumstances, if any, when an investigative agency or a

component of that agency should be disqualified from taking an active role in an

investigation because of an appearance of impropriety growing out of a particular

intelligence or investigative action,

e.

Definitions of the legislative scope and extent of "sources and methods" and the

"informant privilege" as a rationale for the executive branch withholding

information in response to congressional or judicial process or other demand for

information,

f. Institutionalizing efforts to coordinate the gathering, sharing, and analysis of

intelligence information,

g. Insuring those agencies that primarily gather intelligence perform their function so

as to serve the needs of other agencies that primarily engage in physical protection,

and

h. Implementing mechanisms that would permit inter-agency tasking of particular

functions.

b. Prosecution--

1. The Judiciary Committee should consider the impact of the provisions of law dealing

with third-party records, bail and speedy trial as it applies to both the investigation and

prosecution of federally cognizable homicides.

2.

The Judiciary Committee should examine recently passed special prosecutor legislation

to determine if its provisions should be modified to extend them to Presidential

assassinations and the circumstances, if any, under which they should be applicable to

other federally cognizable homicides.

Il. Administrative recommendations to the Executive

The Department of Justice should reexamine its contingency plans for the handling of

assassinations and federally cognizable homicides in light of the record and findings of the

committee. Such an examination should consider the following issues:

a. Insuring that its response takes full advantage of inter- and intra-agency task forces and the

strike force approach to investigations and prosecutions,

b. Insuring that its response takes full advantage of the advances of science and technology,

and determining when it should secure independent panels of scientists to review or

perform necessary scientific tasks, or secure qualified independent forensic pathologists to

perform a forensic autopsy,

c. Insuring that its fair trial/free press guidelines consistent with an alleged offender's right to

a fair trial, allow information about the facts and circumstances surrounding an

assassination promptly be made public, and promptly be corrected when erroneous

information is mistakenlv released, ans

d. Entering at the current time into negotiations with representatives of the media to secure

voluntary agreements providing that photographs, audio tapes, television tapes, and

related matters, made in and around the site of assassinations, be made available to the

Government by consent immediately following an assassination.

IlI. General recommendations for congressional investigations

A. The appropriate committees of the House should consider amending the rules of the House

to provide for a right to appointive counsel in investigative hearings where a witness is

unable to provide counsel from private funds.

The appropriate committees of the House should examine the rules of the House governing

the conduct of counsel in legislative and investigative hearings and consider delineating

guidelines for professional conduct and ethics, including guidelines to deal with conflicts of

interest in the representation of multiple witnesses before a committee.

C. The Judiciary Committee should examine the adequacy of Federal law as it provides for the

production of Federal and State prisoners before legislative or investigative committees

under a writ of habeas corpus ad testificandum.

D. The appropriate committees of the House should examine and clarify the applicability to

congressional subpoenas of recently enacted legislative restrictions on access to records

and other documents.

E. The appropriate committees of the House should consider legislation that would authorize

the establishment of a legislative counsel to conduct litigation on behalf of committees of

the House incident to the investigative or legislative activities and confer jurisdiction on the

U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to hear such lawsuits.

F. The appropriate committees of the House should consider if rule 11 of the House should be

amended, so as to restrict the current access by all Members of the House to the classified

information in the possession of any committee.

IV. Recommendations for further investigation

A. The Department of Justice should contract for the examination of a film taken by Charles L.

Bronson to determine its significance if any, to the assassination of President Kennedy.

B. The National Institute of Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice of the Department of

Justice and the National Science Foundation should make a study of the theory and

application of the principles of acoustics to forensic questions, using the materials available

in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy as a case study.

C. The Department of Justice should review the committee's findings and report in the

assassinations of President John F. Kennedy and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and after

completion of the recommended investigation enumerated in sections A and B, analyze

whether further official investigation is warranted in either case. The Department of Justice

should report its analyses to the Judiciary Committee.
