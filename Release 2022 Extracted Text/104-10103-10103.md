Tadeusz SZULC i

t

The Station copies of the original reports on SZULC have

been destroyed, I attach, however, a memorandum consisting of

selected entries from his card, B
2. All the information is fron the sane source, a Polish emigre .
who knew SZULC personally and also had, informants in the Polish Embassy.
3. There is little doubt that SZULC was pro-communist at the time,
and that he co-operated with Ignacy SACHS, @ cousin who was employed 3
by the Press Section’of the Polish Bubassy, and provided him with -

"information". .. It would, however, be unwise. to jump to the conclusion
that: this collaboration took the form of espionage, since SZULCs does
not seem to have made any secret of the relationship,

he z I can find no evidence that Ignacy SACHS was an intelligence

officer, but he seems to have been an active propagandist, He returned
to Poland in 1954. A report from the same source’, dated June 1956,
stated that he then occupied the Brazilian desk at the Polish Institute

for International Affairs.
