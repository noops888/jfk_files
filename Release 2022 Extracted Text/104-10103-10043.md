3. A review of the circumstances surrounding Mr.

Hunt's conversion to Contract Type A employment and

assignment was then undertaken by Messrs. Yale, Caufield,

Hudson] and the undersigned.

The contract and payroll.

Files of MI. Hunt were reviewed for possible indications

of the nature of the operational activity undertaken in

Madrid.

A review of traval vouchers indicated that Mr.

Hunt and his family made accountings indicating departure

from Washington, D. C.,

on 5 August 1965 with an arrival

in Madrid, Spain, on 16 August 1965.

The costs of this

travel ware charged to the budget of the Western Hami-

sphere Division, Deputy Directorate for Plans, Madrid

Station Support account.. A subsequent accounting sum-

marized PCS travel expenses and included a payment for.

apartment rental for 16, 17 and 18 August 1965 with a

payment in tha amount of $125 to Mr.

for

this purpose.

4.

It was detormined that an allottes bank account

in Mr. Hunt's name had been established at the Riggs

National Bank of Washington. All salary and other non-

operational reimbursements were made to Mr. Hunt through

sterile check to this account.

An operational account

was established for Mr. Hunt with the. Chase Manhattan

Bank of New York City.

A review of all payments made to

Mr. Hunt through the Chase bank account through Mr. Hunt's

operational advance subsidiary account, or 1442 account,

had been made.

There was no record of any operational

accounts of advances being processed through this channel.

Mr. Yals statod that this fact defined his concern.: He

felt that it was inconceivable that Mr. Hunt could have

undertaken operational activity without sone transfer of

or accounting for funds.

To date, no such records have

been developed.

No reference to a project or project

digraph or operational FAN number has been located. Al

expenses connected with vt. Hunt identified to date were

Charged to the Madrid Station Support.

A review made of

Madria Station records has not indicated any "Developmental

and Target of Opportunity (DITO)" funds or "Other Opera-.

tional Activizy (D0A)" funds expended by or on behalf of

MI. Hunt.

These two accounts would normally be tha source

of operational funding not charged against a specific pro-

ject activizy.

5. A reyier of all of tha travel vouchers on record

for MI. Hunt during this period also failed to identify

a project.

In addition to the PCS and return vouchers,

two other accountings are on record.

the renewal of visas."

A second voucher covered a TDY

trip fron Madrid to Hashingion with return to Madrid

voucher states in the space providad for the citation of

the travel order number - "no travel order."

ing was approved and signed by Mr. Thomas Taranessines,

then Deputy Director for Plans. No justification or

statement of purpose for this TDY was given on the account

ing.

6. Nr. Yale deterained that further toview of passible

sources or identification of operational funding was in

order.

NI. Yala gava instiuctions that the entiro 1442

advance account of Mi. Hunt be revieved for other possiblo

channels of funding outsido of the Ney York Chase accout.

After discussion, it was agreed that particular attention.

be taken to any itons connected with publishing or book

royalties. MI. Yals noted that the royalty offset waivas

provision amended to M5. Hunt's contract was, in his ex-

perience, sonewhat unusual.

7.

NI. Yale was informed by the undorsigned of the

intention to interview MI. Edward Ryan, currently Chief,

Division D, who was at the time of Mr. Hunt's Madrid assign-

sent, Deputy Chiaf of the Western Henisphere Division.

MI.

The undarsigned informed MI.. Yale that this had been dono

and briefed MI. Yala on the generally jogative rosulis of

tas intervian.

Ms.. Yale then racormended that Mr. Saw

Halyern be interplaned.

Mr. Yale noted that yr. Halparn

companied MI. Fitzgerald when he became Deputy Diractor for

MT. Yalo recalled that subsequent to Mr. Fitzgerald's

stated that from his experience, Mi. Karamessinas would

hays dolegated all the arranging of "details" surrounding

un assignment such as Mr. Hunt's to Mr. Halparn. 'Nt. Yalo

offered the parenthetical observation of his surpriso at

what he interpreted to be reticence to data to interver
